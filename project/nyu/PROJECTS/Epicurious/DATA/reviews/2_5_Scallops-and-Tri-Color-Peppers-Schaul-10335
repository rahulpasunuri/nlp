I had fun with this after reading reviews that it was bland: cut back on peppers, added fresh thyme & lots of fresh sliced garlic. After cooking scallops & removing, I added calamata olives (pitted), sun-dried tomatoes, mushrooms & capers. Absolutely delicious!!!

I was really excited to try this recipe, but it wasn't that great. It had a sort of metallic taste when I made it. Had envisioned serving it on a bed of baby spinach so it would get all wilty and tasty, but unfortunately that was the day of the big spinach recall! Perhaps part of the disappointment was the lack of spinach-

It was an easy basic recipe. I did add chopped garlic to the peppers as I sauteed them and then a splash of lemon and a dash of salt at the end just before I took the completed dish off of the heat it was very tasty indeed. My daughter ate it and she is 7 1/2.

While the fundamentals of the recipe are good there are a few things that seemd off. 6 peppers for a 1/2 pound of scallops is way too much. Use one of each and that will be plenty, or adda whole lot more scallops. While it tasted good the seasoning was a little bland not sure what you could add but it needs a little kick.
