I used ordinary wheat bran, from the bulk bins, instead of miller's bran, and they were wonderful. The toasted sunflowers (I bought raw hulled & unsalted seeds & toasted them myself) really added a great nutty flavor, and there were plenty of blueberries to jazz it up. I always worry that muffin recipes will be too sweet, but this was fine. I'm still going to experiment to reduce the sugar though.

Anybody have any comment on the double acting baking powder?? Will regular baking powder work? Thanks!

I agree, much better the next day??? Very yummy and am making them again. Experimenting with these would be easy!

I would like to revise my review of last week. After letting the muffins sit and eating one the next day, I discovered it was absolutely delicious. I froze them and have eaten one each day this week, and they are continually good. In fact I am making them again tonight to take to a breakfast meeting at work tomorrow!

I thought these were good but not great. Subbed 1/2 wheat flour for 1/2 cup white flour, maybe that was a mistake. Also used flax seeds rather than sunflower, as that's what I had. Good texture, great crunchy top. They are quite a mouthful, next time I would make them as minis.

D E L I C I O U S ! ! ! The Blueberries at Costco are incredible right now, so I've been making a lot of blueberry desserts. These muffins are incredible. I halved the butter and added 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce. Added walnuts in lieu of sunflowers seeds, because that's what I had on hand.. and added about 1/4 Cup brown flax seeds. I baked them for about 15-18 minutes...as the tops were golden. My boyfriend is raving about my muffins!!

I impulse bought five pounds of blueberries two weeks in a row at the farmer's market, so I've been making every blueberry recipe I can get my hands on, and so far this is the best muffin recipe. There's good blueberry flavour, but not so many that the muffins don't hold together, and the sunflower seeds add a nice nutty crunchiness. These are also one of the few muffin recipes out there that really rises and makes a nice muffin top, instead of being flat-topped.

I thought they were just okay, but people at work loved them.

These are fabulous. I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup apple sauce to reduce the fat. The berry and seed contrast is excellent, and they were moist and tasty. Very nice with cream cheese and honey.

These are the best bran muffins I've ever had. My husband loved them! Made them with soymillk, wheat bran, frozen blueberries (rinsed and patted dry)and flaxseed instead of sunflowers. Loved how the blueberries added flavor and color! Making them again tomorrow...

Super muffins -- I interchanged spelt flour and spelt bran for wheat flour/bran and they worked great!

I like these muffins, especially when you add more blueberries. The sunflowers add a special touch, and will try the pumpkin seeds next. I always sprinkle a bit of sugar on top of the muffins when they come out of the oven to give them a hint of sweetness.

Very nice and very easy muffin recipe. I used regular bran as my local grocery store doesn't carry miller's bran, and I was pleased with the results.

Excellent muffins - beautiful visually and taste wise. Golden tops, a nice balance of sweetness and crunchiness. I made my first batch this morning with the following modifications: - substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for the all purpose flour, - Substituted buttermilk with the addition of 1/2 tsp baking soda, - Substituted roasted pumpkin seeds (I prefer these to sunflower seeds)and sprinkled tops with pumpkin seeds. My three kids ages 3 - 10 and husband devoured them.

I followed Melvin's advice and made a batch. And voila, super delicious muffins without changing a thing.

Loved these muffins, and so did my family! Used fresh bluberries, 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour in place of 1/2 cup of the white flour. I loved the taste and crunch that the sunflower seeds gave, and felt a little less guilty eating several of these. Pretty low carb and chock full of good for you stuff! Will be doing again.

Well, I'm writing this review for my wife. She is on another one of her health kicks, and when she told me that she was making bran muffins...I said, "oh god". Then I told her that I would go to the woodlot and just eat some sawdust, and I advised her to stock up on t.p. Well, I was wrong. These are the best dang muffins that she has ever cooked. We have had other bran muffins that give terrible side effects, but these were great and I had several of them before going to work....with no worries at all! I think you ladies should make these for your husband and you family all the time. I love you Kallie, and you make a damn good muffin. Love, Melvin

These muffins are rather dry, especially when raisins are substituted for blueberries. Next time I will add extra liquid as suggested by others. I will also reduce the baking time or the oven temp as they were slightly overdone after 20 minutes.

Very yummy. Most bran muffins I've made contain molasses. This was a delicious change. I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour in place of 1/2 cup of the all- purpose flour and used raisins instead of the blueberries. They turned out perfect. Slightly sweet and hearty tasing. I will make these again many times. Happy baking!

I had to make adjustments but the recipe turned out well. I ran out of all purpose flour and used 3/4c all purpose white and 3/4c whole wheat. I took the suggestion below and chopped the sunflower seeds, although I did use the amount recommended. I added brown sugar, used frozen wild blueberries and added a splash of freshly squeezed apple juice and a tsp of pure vanilla extract. These muffins had a great texture & taste and everyone who enjoyed them today wants the recipe. These will definitely become a standard in my kitchen.

These were tasty and moist and had a great texture. I cut the sugar down to 1/2 a cup and added a splash of vanilla extract, a splash of lemon extract and a generous splash of orange juice - delicious!

Really tasty, but I suggest these minor changes. When using frozen berries, rinse in water and dry on paper towel. Especially with frozen berries, put a spoonful of batter without berries in the tin before adding the rest; it keeps the berries from sticking. I'm going to use fewer sunflower seeds and chop them coarsely.

These were good, but I found them to be rather dry. I did not overbake them and might make these again, but probably not.

The muffins were so good that it was as if they were purchased from a bakery. I added a tbs of vanilla to the recipe and I used raw sugar.
