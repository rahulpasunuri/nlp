Fantastic recipe, and the result was quite colorful as well! Personally I made a couple changes: -Along with the chorizo I added some garlic and a chopped bell pepper -Had brown rice so I cooked it as normal in a small pot before I started for about 30-35 minutes (usually would be 40-45), then added the rice as it says -Frozen peas and tomatoes were plain (we didn't have either with onions) -Marjoram was in a shaker, not fresh With these, it was still really good. I didn't have much grease from the chorizo myself. Would recommend it and absolutely would make it again.

Yum! I used brown rice (cooked for longer of course) & added veges (diced carrots & cauliflower). Cilantro/Coriander (by my back door) was used instead of Marjoram (all the way in vege patch), which worked really well. Very Tasty! Great easy weeknight meal.

This was pretty tasty. YOU WILL NOT NEED THE OLIVE OIL. Sauteeing the chorizo alone will produce enough oil for the remainder of the recipe. I used frozen corn (that's all I had). However, I will drain the tomatoes next time as I thought that the rice came out too wet. Will definitely put into my rotation.

Wonderful easy everyday hearty meal. My boyfriend gave an unprompted and enthusiastic "YUM!!". Tweaked recipe as follows, making an even more delicious meal: Substitute fresh sweetcorn kernels for peas, adding with tomatos. Substitute La Vallee canned tomatos, and omit olives (too salty when with the chorizo).

I used Mexican Chorizo instead. But don't add any oil at all since it has no need for it. Be patient when heating the Mexican Chorizo, med. heat; don't preheat with a gas stove.But you will need to break aprt the chorizo and keep evening it out until it is completely broken apart. Then add the rice and so on... If it's too hot some of the rice may turn out a little crunchy. This is a great recipe.

I made this and all loved it, incl. the kids. Instead of using the tomatoes with peppers, I used a can of ROTEL tomatoes with chilies (incl the juice). To add something saucy, I served it my our family-recipe German style cucumber salad. Delicious !

My sister made this for me and I went straight to this website to find the recipe. Deelish!

As written the recipe is too oily. I poured off the oil from the chorizo (as much as possible) before adding the rice. I too made the spanish rice with sauted onions.

This dish was good but nothing to brag about. It is an easy weeknight main dish, though.

Okay, it was all right. Certainly better than its most dreaded namesake in our high school cafeteria. I used spicy chorizo (rather than mild) which added some heat. They don't have "peas with pearl onions" here so I used fresh chopped onion and think it was an improvement (pearl onions are not a common Spanish ingredient). Also added some saffron. No one complained, but no one raved, either.

I left out the tablespoon of olive oil and I didn't have fresh marjoram, and this was still delicious. It took less than 45 minutes to throw together. I will definitely make it again!
