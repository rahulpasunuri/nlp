This was OUTSTANDING! I did not have watercress and could not find any so I just took another reviewers advice and used a sring green mix. I also used a combination of scallions, leeks, green onions and red onions for the scallions AND I doubled the amount of onion. I used a shot of vegetable concentrate and 2 different kinds of vegetable broth (it was what I had on hand) and used Earth Balance in place of butter. It was very rich. I also added some Chicago Seasoning (I can't remember who makes it but we use it for a lot of things) and added a squirt of Braggs Amino's. This is by far one the best soups I have ever had. The next day I warmed up a grilled soy "chicken" patty and just threw it in when I heated up the soup and had my protein. I HIGHLY recommend this and will make this again many times. This is my new comfort food.

Used olive oil and onion to replace scallion and butter. All spinach instead of spinach, lettuce and watercress. Plan to make as written except for the butter once I get the ingredients. Loved the soup.

A really tasty soup very smooth and creamy hard to believe it has no cream, Very healthy with plenty of vitamins. I added a 1/4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg after blending.

This is one of my favorite things to make for friends on the mend, new moms or anyone who needs some nourishing comfort food. My kids love it, too - but my kids aren't scared by green things and will pretty much eat any pureed soup I make so your mileage may vary on that one.

I've been making this soup for a few years now--a favorite for fall. One can easily use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, and olive oil instead of butter (1/3 c. butter = 1/4 c. olive oil). Consider doubling so you have more on hand. The recipe as-is serves more like two than four.

This is my favorite winter soup this year, by far. My BF thought it was a bit salty, but I love salt. I often double the recipe for leftovers. Fan-tastic.

This was absolutely delicious. I didn't have watercress and substituted a spring mix. I garnished it with shaved pecorino-romano. The potage is a great base that you can add diferent spices and garnishes too. I will be making it again for sure.

Soooo simple and quick to make and was an excellent hearty soup! Everyone had 2nd's including my 3 & 5 year olds. However I subsituted the watercress and simply used more spinach. The sour cream and chives were the perfect compliment. Highly recommend!!

Nice to serve on a cold, rainy night. Authentic potage must be made with consomme'. Makes a big difference.

Easy and tasty recipe. It's great for us since we grow all of the green ingredients in our garden. Would definitely make again

This dish belies its simple ingredients- hearty and filling. Use only good potatoes- a flavorful, creamy potato makes the dish. We used arugula (three cheers for arugula!) - missed the watercress, but this substitute worked well. Pair with a cheap red wine and cold night and you're set. Yahoo.

Wonderful 'green' soup. No need for sour cream. Not too bitter - the spinach & watercress are mellowed by the lettuce. A hand blender makes it even easier. Can top with parmesan curls for a change. Have made it several times.
