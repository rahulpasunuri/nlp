Delicious - just a bit too sweet for my taste. My family has begged me to make it two times already!

I would give this dessert all 4 stars in the sense that it is a wonderfully light and tasty dessert. It's also not as difficult as you think to make.

I'm making this for a dinner party, and I didn't have enough ramekins/custard cups to make 12, so I used foil cupcake liners. I did not double the recipe--kept as is. So far things seem fine. I will bake at the host's place while we have dinner, so I'll update this review later. But to substitute for the ceramic dishes, I flattened the liners, rubbed butter with my fingers, then reshaped the liners inside the cupcake tray. This is why you need foil, as they can create a new shape better. Then I coated the inside with sugar as instructed. I filled each to the rim, but I couldn't get enough room to run my thumb around, so I hope this is alright. In the future, anyone have ideas for disposable souffle cups? I'd hate to invest in 12-20 ramekin dishes that I have to take with me to each event.

The recipe is good except for an important error. The half-cup ramekin has to be a mistake. It works for six one cup ramekins, cooked no more than 28 minutes, or for twelve half cups, cooked no more than 20 minutes.
