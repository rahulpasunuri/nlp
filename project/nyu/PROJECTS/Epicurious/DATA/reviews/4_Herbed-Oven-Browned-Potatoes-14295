Just a question? Should the potaoes be covered or uncovered. I think they would brown better uncovered but might be moister covered. I made it uncovered and used Italian at the end because it was the only fresh herb in the house. I miss summer

It is DELICIOUS! I used the potoato medley from Trader Joe's and followed the recipe as is. No complaints, the house smells incredible and it's one of my new favorites now. The fresh herbs make a huge difference, this recipe is a keeper.

This is a recipe that every cook should have in his or her repertoire. Vary the herbs to suit the main course. Not sure why someone doesn't think rosemary is right here--it's a classic pairing with potatoes. I, too, used olive oil in place of butter.

very easy,and very quick if you use the microwave to 1st cook the potatoes instead of parboiling them. Fresh oregano and fresh basil and thyme work well, but too much rosemary will overwhelm the dish

I prepare this dish at least once a week during wintertime. The roasting herbs make the kitchen smell so nice. I always substitute 1 T. olive oil for the butter. Very tasty and a versatile side dish.

Fantastic! I doubled the recipe and went heavy on the herbs. I also stirred it after about 20 minutes and let it bake for another 15-20 minutes, until the edges were very brown and crispy. I served this under the "MIXED-PEPPERCORN STEAKS WITH SHERRY-MARJORAM PAN SAUCE" recipe, accompanied by a spinach, cherry tomato, blue cheese & vinaigrette salad and followed it with the "FLOURLESS CHOCOLATE CAKE" recipe. The whole thing took 2 hours start to finish and was a restaurant quality showstopper!

So simple and so good, these potatoes made the house smell wonderfully of rosemary. Parboiling the potatoes made the baking time short. I used Yukon gold potatoes. I'm sure to make these often.

this is a delicious, easy to make recipe - with the boiling, the potatoes get creamy-soft on the inside with a slightly crisp, buttery-herb crust!

This dish is awesome. It's really easy to make and it is now one of my husbands favorite. You can use any fresh or dried herbs you have on hand. I sometimes combine olive oil and butter for an extra treat!

I love this recipe and make it all the time. You can skip the boiling of the potatoes in water altogether and just cook them longer too. I often sub olive oil for butter too. You can't go wrong here!

This is quite good. I used a tsp of Herbs de Provence that I had bought for another recipe. I'd make again the same way.
