Very nice, used triple sec instead of grand marnier. Very tasty with strawberry preserves or nutella inside.

Yummy! Simply scrumptious! Extremely easy to make...I just throw all the ingredients in the blender and mix...storing it in a plastic container in the fridge. Easy crepes, and these are really more crepes than pancakes, anytime that is effortless to prepare. Very delicious, this is a mainstay in my fridge!

First, these are crepes, not pancakes. Second, they're really tasty, and easy to prepare. I ate them with a homemade apricot jam and orange slices and grapefruit. (On a side note, I always keep a bottle of Grand Marnier around for breakfast/brunch recipes. I find a lot of recipes that call for just a little, including my favorite for Grand Marnier French Toast at williams-sonoma.com)

These are a big hit in my family! Great taste and texture! This is one recipe I'll make over and over.
