Love this mousse. Really delightful and easy to make. The pink is the reflection of the pink tray, rasberries and the pink table. Or, you can simply add a drop of red coloring to get that look. Not sure about the look of the pound cake, it's not stable looking. But, I have made the desert atleast 4 times and everyone loves it everytime.

Its definitely not pink! It was very tasty, but a touch rich for me. First, I will divulge where I strayed from the recipe-I used store-bought madelines instead of pound cake and I thought I had sweet marsala and didn't so I read that I could sub bourbon in, which worked fine. If I had to make it again, I would mash up some berries to try to get some color into the mousse, and I would cut back on the wine/bourbon and maybe add a little more cream to lighten up the flavor. Also, the store was out of raspberries so I made 2 servings with blackberries and 2 servings with strawberries (I definitely do not think the recipe makes 6 servings). The blackberries were too tart but the strawberries worked very nicely with the flavor of the mousse

I am passionate about cooking food-- not dessert. However, most people love dessert, and that has brought me to this jewel. It is one of my top go- to desserts for simplicity and taste. Dont change the recipe because the flavors will not improve with improvisation.

Didn't love the flavor.

I was having friends over for dinner (both very fussy about food so I was REALLY nervous) and as usual, I wasn't managing cleaning the house and cooking a big dinner all in the same day. This recipe saved my life!! It was easy to make, very impressive and best of all, our company raved about it, my husband loved it and I have never forgotten how pleased I was with it. It was everything I want in a dessert--memorable, elegant and delicious! Did I mention how impresive it looks? It is a real show-stopper, both for presentation and for taste!

This is a terrific summer dessert. I've made it with once w/marsala, once w/grand marnier (either works), and have used both homemade pound cake and store bought (again, either's fine!). One thing: the mousse is not pink, as the picture shows. It's delicious, though, and is very impressive-looking even though it's pretty much a cinch to make!

I thought the Marsala was overpowering even after chilling. Further, the picture shows this pretty pink-colored mousse but mine was brownish colored from the vanilla because unless you mash some berries into it, nothing in the recipe as it is, would make it pink colored- even with the mashed berries it had an odd color. I chose to spread the mixture on some vanilla-almond biscotti topped with raspberries instead.

Made this for a 4th of July party but used strawberries and blueberries. Thought the marsala might be overpowering but not at all after it was chilled. It was a hit. Will definitely make it again using the rasberries.

My girlfriend and I saw the "pretty in pink" comment and made this with some measure of irony for a Lesbian Avenger's picnic this weekend, but the gals loved it! It's a keeper!

With four forks from all three reviewers, why is the %age rating as low as 75%?

The ingredients aren't cheap and the preparation is pretty involved, but the end result is well worth it. Served this for company & everyone raved about how good it was. If I were to make the recipe again, I would probably use less Marsala and would not chill before serving.

Fantastic! A lighter version of zabaglione with a pleasant hint of cinnamon. The recipe for the zabaglione alone is a hit, and this is a wonderful use for it!

A big hit. Very rich and tasty and not at all difficult to make
