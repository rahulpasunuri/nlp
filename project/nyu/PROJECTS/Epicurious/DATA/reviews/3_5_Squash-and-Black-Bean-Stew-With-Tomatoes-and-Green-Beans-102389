I really liked this, the balance of sweet and spicy was great. I too roasted the squash, which ende up a bit smushy in the end but that was ok. Great suggestion to add corn. Had to add a bit of chicken stock too.

Delicious! Ends up being more like a sweet chili than a stew -- really thick and hearty. I roasted the butternut squash before adding it to the stew. I doubled the black beans (as per other reviewers' recommendations), doubled the jalapeno too, and used corn instead of green beans. I also added a cup of water and let it simmer for about twice as long as it called for. My first time making soup or chili of any kind, and it turned out great! Next time I would add another (14oz.) can of tomatoes, I think... or half the amount of squash and just follow the recipe. (There was just so much squash!) I also cubed the squash into fairly large chunks, and I think next time I'd make them smaller, to match the size of the corn and black beans. I love that this recipe is so tasty, so filling, and so healthy!

The kabocha squash adds to the richness of this stew's gravy. Also, you do not need to peel Kabocha, just cut off stems parts and scoop out seeds. Instead of jalapeno, this is also great with roasted green chiles (anaheim, poblano or pasilla, to your liking). Fresh roasted is best... that adds another kick of flavor interest.Yum!

This was a really good meatless stew. Although, I think I would have called this a vegi. chili instead of a stew. The squash takes the place of meat nicely (I didn't miss that there was no meat). I sauteed the onions in a pan first then realized I wasn't going to have enough room for everything, so I moved it into a pot and added in the squash and beans, and then simmered it for a half hour covered. Oh, and I didn't add any salt or pepper and it was perfect for my taste.

This was good, but made MUCH better with the addition of chopped fresh avocados and a dollop of low-fat sour cream on the stew after it was completed. I also squeezed fresh lime juice on top. Delicious!!!

This was good. Didn't WOW me, but it is easy, filling, inexpensive, and a great way to get your veggies. This dish definately needs some depth of flavor, which you will get if you roast the squash (or saute) just until it starts to brown, really brown the onions, add a bit of broth (chicken or vegetable), and a bit of salt or soy sauce. I followed he advice of other reviewers and did the above as well doubling the amount of green beans and using Glen Muir Fire Roasted diced tomatoes. Cooking time ended up being twice as long as recipe indicates. Will make again and maybe even alter by substituting the black beans with garbanzos and going for more of a Moroccan theme using cinnamon and corriander instead of chili powder. Maybe some zucchini, meyer lemon wedges, and red bell pepper,too

Love this recipe. Great flavor and so healthy. Next time I make this I'll probably cut back on the squash and add some more beans. Would go great with corn bread.

I found this recipe to be quite good. Used 1 pkg of dried black beans instead of canned ones. Added beans after tomatoes with 4 cups of water. Brought to a boil, then simmered for 1 hour before adding the rest of the ingredients. Served with sour creme. Very delicious and healthful. Brought leftovers to work for next day's lunch.

This was a great weeknight fall dish -- easy to prepare and adapt. It tastes like your basic chili with butternut squash. The recipe makes enough for 3 or 4 (I omitted the green beans) but I doubled it so we could have leftovers. Doubled the recipe filled half our large crock pot.I found it mild, so I added more of each spice and served with extra jalapenos on the side. My 1 year old said "mmm mmm." I think next time I'll shortcut: use diced tomatoes with garlic and olive oil and frozen cubed butternut. Might even add some other squash like zuchinni.

My whole family enjoyed this, to my great surprise, even the youngest child. I omitted the jalapeno and cilantro, since I didn't have them, and used soaked, dry black beans. And, I went easy on the chili powder so that my pickiest eater would eat it.

I recently rediscovered this recipe and I think it is one of the best vegetarian dishes ever! Everyone enjoys the unique blend of flavors and textures.

Mmmm, mmm. I made this with a few modifications and I loved it. I omitted the green beans because i didn't have any, but I added some scalions and increased the amount of cumin and chili powder (and used high quality ancho chili). I threw in 2 tbs butter (because why not), and topped it with sour cream, cheddar and even more chili powder. It was delicious and hearty.

This was amazing, I ate three servings in a row upon making it for the first time! Really delicious and healthy. I tossed the butternut squash with cumin, salt, and pepper and then baked for 15 minutes prior to adding to the pot. The texture was perfect. I also added some vegetable broth as others have recommended. I will definitely make again, I may add an additional half can of beans. I serve with fresh avocado slices on top.

I love this recipe. But I cook the squash first, sauteing it first in the pot with more olive oil than noted, as much as needed, until it starts getting soft. I add a little salt, garlic powder, and fresh ground cumin. Once its cooked down somewhat, I add tons of fresh garlic and onions. I let that almost brown, then I add two big cans of tomatoes. Last step is the green beans and black beans, and then cover for 10-15 min, till beans are desired softness.

This makes a ton! Really delicious, and super easy once the chopping is done -- recommend doubling the black beans and adding chicken broth, as other reviewers have.

very tasty. add corn as others recommended. also added some smoked pork. had to leave out jalepenos bc of 3 yr old, but added jarred to my bowl and was yummy. would recommend more chili powder and cumin.

This is an excellent stew - the colors would be great if it hadn't cooked down so long. Next time I will bake the squash, and throw things together closer to finishing time so they retain some aesthetic. We used more beans and less squash, and added apple juice as suggested. Overall, very delicious and easy.

Delicious and healthy! I garnished with sour cream and tabasco chipotle hot sauce. Next time I may add 2 cans of black beans. I think it would also be tasty with black-eyed peas.

Making this stew with the last green beans and tomatoes from the garden has become a tradition for us. We add a chopped bell pepper, corn, and quadruple the green beans to get a balance we like with the sweet, dense squash. I'm grateful for the idea to par- bake the squash before peeling, and I take advantage of the hot oven to make a quick buttermilk cornbread to pair with the stew. Don't give up on this if it's too "veggie" for you; try adding browned ground turkey with the squash. I made it that way one year, and it's tasty and still very healthy.

This was great - better than expected for such a healthy, vegetarian dinner - I used more grean beans, a little chicken stock, and the chilli sauce with a rooster on the jar instead of the jalapeno - perfect with brown rice - also I didn't peel the assortment of squashes I used

This was really quick and easy, and delicious as well. I had a nearly four-pound squash, so I upped the spices a bit and added two ladlefuls of homemade chicken stock. It was especially good with a small dollop of sour cream on top.

Definitely will make again! Easy, healthy and most importantly delicious. I followed the recipe pretty closely except used fresh tomatoes instead of canned and roasted squash just for 10 minutes to make peeling easier. Made corn bread to go with it. Yum!

I sauteed the onion, garlic and jalapeno together for a few minutes, added spices and added the squash and sauteed for a few minutes. Also used frozen beans which had some carrots in the package and they were a nice addition. Cooked on a low heat for quite a while until the butternut squash was tender. My three year old liked it a lot!

I added chicken,(blackened & sauted w/garlic), an extra can of black beans; next time I will add potatoes to cut the heavy sweetness of the squash- it was great but will be better with one more "neutral" veggie.

I made this with pumpkin and it was delicious. I must say it's better by an order of magnitude a couple of days after you've made it, reheated. It's got just the right amount of sublimity and fire and it's quite hearty.

I substituted ground dried chipotles for the jalapenos (1 tbsp in a half batch, added with the garlic, made for a hot chili). Per pervious reviews partially roasted the squash and increased simmer time. I also added some veg. broth to keep it from drying out. The squash adds a neat texture and it's easy; will make again.

I agree this recipe takes longer than advertized. I also roasted the squash first, which also makes it easier to cut. I used butternut and spaghetti squash and it was a good combo.

I roasted the cubed squash for 30 minutes thanks to other reviews. The longer you simmer this the better it gets. I kept tasting it and after an hour it was really yummy. My husband flipped over it.

Nice but nothing spectacular. It's just like plain old chili but with squash substituted for beef or pork. Not bad though, I might make it again.

The squash took forever to cook (and I cut it into v. small pieces) but otherwise this was great. The next time I make it, I'll pre-cook the squash a little and I think I also might add some greens.

Excellent!!!! I used frozen green beans & added some corn. I also added chicken broth as I felt there wasn't enough liquid. This is a keeper, plus it was even better the next day for lunch. Added 6 cloves of garlic, chopped not minced. Squash took longer than 12 minutes & I cut my smaller than an inch.

DELICIOUS AND ADDICTIVE! One of the most unique soups using butternut squash I've ever tasted. It's like a really flavorful veggie chili with the sweetness of the squash added in. It would definitely be good with a variety of other vegetables added in -- especially corn. It would also be good with couscous, rice or tortillas, or, my favorite -- cornbread!! Make this tonite.

This was a great recipe. The squash did take about twice the time to cook as the recipe said it would, but it was worth the wait. Will definitely cook again, especially for vegan company.

Muir Glen makes "Fire Roasted" canned organic tomatoes. They are a MUST for this dish to impart a smoky flavor without adding any heat. Don't forget the fresh jalapeno though because a tiny touch of heat helps this dish and my 2 year old still didn't think it was very spicy. I prebaked the squash & made this stew in the afternoon and it was ok. By evening when I served it, it was really yummy. I'm looking forward to tomorrow's leftovers. Next time I'll double the garlic or add 1/2 a roasted garlic.

I also baked the squash in advance and made this dish the night before we were planning to eat it because of scheduling issues. I was really concerned at the "squishy" texture of the stew at first and feared that the kids wouldn't eat it. However, it got rave reviews. It's very filling and has a rich taste. Next time, I'll try the chipotle peppers mentioned by another reviewer. It does need a "smokey" flavor to counterbalance the sweetness of the squash.

A great recipe, my husband and I both loved it. The only negative--I thought it looked "quick," and it was, although it took a lot longer than I had expected to peel, seed, and dice the squash. Great winter recipe. You don't even miss the meat in this stew!

divinely different!!! This really is an outstanding recipe because not only does it taste wonderful, but also,it is uncomplicated and healthy (without having that "good for you taste"). I followed the previous reviewer's suggestion and baked the squash first, which was quite delectable since the squash caramelized. I doubled the garlic. Instead of the jalepeno and chili powder, I used one chipotle chili in adobo sauce. This provided a lovely smoky depth , and it complimented the smoked chedder that I tossed into each bowl at the end. A harmony of spice, sweet, and smoke, awesome!Even my chronically choosy soon-to-be six-year-old enjoyed it.

This is a delicious, flexible, and uncomplicated stew! As others have said, you'll need to either bake the squash ahead of time or be prepared to let the stew simmer for MUCH longer than the recipe states. I also had to thin the stew with vegetable broth. I omitted the green beens and jalapenos, adding potatoes and a dash of crushed red pepper instead. The end result was a delicious, satisfying and nutritious dinner with plenty of leftovers for lunch for the next day.

Very, very good. It does need a bit more simmering to get the squash nice and tender. I added more cilantro at the end...love the sweetness it lends to the dish! I serve it with warm, organic, whole wheat tortillas and occasionally a little low fat chedder cheese sprinkled on top. Great leftovers.

Good healthy fare and easy to make but no rave reviews from family members. However, the leftovers make a fantastic pureed soup that is worth four forks. I pureed the leftovers in the food processor, thinned with chicken stock, added hot chili sauce and garnished with yogurt and cilantro. Delicious!

I love this recipe for a variety of reasons. One is that it it makes enough soup for my wife and I for several days... The other reason is that it can be simply modified to be a chili recipe instead of a soup. To do this, simply put the squash in a food processor. This will give your soup a very thick consistancy. It's actually quite good that way. I always make this the day before we are going to eat it as it is MUCH better after it chills overnight.

Great recipe, but it needs to simmer longer than suggested. We used some of the hints from others and added corn and served over rice. In addition, we felt there wasn't enough liquid, so we added a small amount of apple cider ...yummy!
