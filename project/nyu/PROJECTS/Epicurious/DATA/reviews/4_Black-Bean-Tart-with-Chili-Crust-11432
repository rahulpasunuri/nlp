My husband loved this recipe! He thanked me for dinner several times that night. I can only imagine what I would've gotten if I had cilantro to put in it. I didn't bother with using a tart pan, but it slid out of my pie plate without any problems. I also followed the advice of others and put some cheese on the bottom before adding the black bean mixture. I have a chili lime seasoning, so I mixed that with some sour cream to have on the side.

I loved this recipe. I found a copy of it in my old recipe binder and made it for a South American themed dinner party. It was beautiful and delicious. I don't think this will be a regular weeknight kind of thing...too long to make, but it's an impressive dinner party appetizer.

This recipe is VERY good. I followed the recommendation of one of the other reviewers and placed about 1/4 cup of the reduced-fat cheese along the bottom of the crust, before adding the pureed bean-sour cream mixture. Thus, my cheese amount was 1/4 cup more than the recipe called for. GOOD CALL! PERFECT amount of ingredients for a beautiful mound in the center. I used a 10-inch springform pan since I did not have a fluted tart pan. Worked well, but the "lip" of the springform pan made it difficult to slide the "cake" server beneath the crust to remove the first piece of tart. Any Weight Watchers? Based on preparation as I did, using light sour cream and Sargento brand reduced-fat Mexican 4-cheese blend renders the points total for 1/8 of a tart at 10 Points. With a salad and a healthfully prepared low-carb, lowfat Quesadilla (using corn and portabella mushrooms) of only 4 points, this is a hearty meal!

Well I see that this is a popular recipe, but I didn't like it, and do not plan to make it again. I found the filling really crumbly and think maybe an egg would hold it together better. That said, the filling made enough for two pies, and with the extra filling I made a crustless fritatta and again, very crumbly. I just don't think it was all that tasty or worth the work.

Added a healthy dash of cayenne pepper to the filling becauce my jalepenos were mild. Used a pie crust I'd already prepared; pressed the spices called for into the crust after pricking it with a fork. Worked like a charm! Very tasty but too laborious for the end result. Next time I'll shortcut some steps and forgo the lime-sour cream mixture for straight sour cream.

Rating: 1
I really thought this was just okay - didn't care for the crust at all, and the filling was pretty bland and didn't stay together well at all. Though we ate this (half for dinner one night, cold for lunch the next day), I wouldn't make it again.

this absolutely rocked. The only change I made was that I used spelt flour instead of all-purpose (and green pepper instead of red...but that's not a big change). This was phenomenal. Yummy Yummy!!!

Really delicious. Didn't use as much butter in the pastry, but next time I will because it seemed very dry - great flavour though. Used Chipotles in Adobe instead of the chilli and it was outstanding. Well definitely make it again.

Rating: 3
The rating is for the way I made it, not the original recipe. I was in a hurry and also had a refrigerated commercial pie crust I needed to get rid of so I used that. I mixed up the spices and sprinkled/rubbed them on the pre-made crust before baking and it worked really well. I think probably as well as putting them inside the crust. Anyway, it was very good and the family enjoyed it.

Was a little disappointed in the flavor of the filling, I felt it was missing something and added some salt and cumin but still felt it needed something. It was beautiful, and the crust was perfect. I may make again but will probably play with the filling a bit.

What can I say? Fantastic, rich, tasty very different. I made the crust exactly as per the recipe it was beautiful, buttery tasty light and tender. The filling is full of flavour and beautiful, I can't wait to try this out on guests!

This was delicious. What a beautiful presentation! The only mods I made were to add some chopped cilantro to the lime/sour cream. I didn't use the jalapenos because DH doesn't like them. I took previous reviewers' advice and decreased the butter and increased the ice water. I'll make this often because my kids are vegetarians.

Rating: 4
this was a fantastic alternative to the traditional rice and black beans i usually serve along with a tex-mex flank steak. i, too, cut back on the butter in the crust to 6T and had to bake it a little longer than directed, and took the foil and weights off to fully bake it. i also reserved part of the cheese for sprinkling on top. truly a winner.

This is one of those recipes that my husband keeps asking me to make. I first found it in the original Gourmet magazine and was thrilled to find it online - since I'd lost it. It is nice to read that others like it as much. The filling makes a lot, so I use a larger pan rather than having the leftovers. Though others have suggested making it into a dip which is a great idea!

This was delicious. I cut the butter back to 6 tbl and it worked fine. I used to habanero peppers instead of the jalapeno, and they were perfect.

Rating: 4
This recipe has been a long-time favorite in my househould. I use canned, low fat, refried black beans for the creamy bean base. For the remainder of the bean portion, I use canned black beans that are drained and washed. This recipe is so easy to make and encourages creativity in changing the filling by adding or substituting black olives, chipotles, hominy, cheddar cheese or some type of Mexican cheese. It's fantastic as an appetizer!

Rating: 4
This recipe was a definite '10'! The flavors blend well yet hold their own. I did add extra lime juice to the sour cream and also squirted extra lime juice all over the tart before serving. Sliced avocados served on the side of the tart were also a nice extra. I make this when I need an out of the ordinary 'WOW'.

Rating: 3
This was quite good. The crust was wonderful. The creamy bean layer was a bit soupy so I would drain my beans more the next time or refry them a bit. Used less cheese than required. Also made it in a 9" pan...kept some excess filling since the pan was smaller and reheated it next day for lunch and it was equally as good with chips. Definitely will make again...trying to think of something else to use the crust with....did use 3 T water with the crust.

Rating: 3
The filling is GREAT, the crust is problematic. Half a cup of butter is too much for 1-1/4 cups flour; it's greasy, though the spices are a terrific idea and make it more interesting to eat and even more beautiful to look at--it's a lovely dish. Next time I'd use my standard pie crust (half butter, half shortening) with the spices as suggested (the crust recipe as written is also not enough for a 10-inch tart tin). The filling is absolutely delicious, and makes more than enough for a 10-inch tart. I used two cans of black beans and simmered them with the onion and bay leaf, as people suggested. It goes together very quickly, and the dish can be made early in the day and re-heated (or served at room temp.). I served it to a vegetarian dinner guest with the chopped salad w/salsa verde dressing from this site, and she loved it. You can use low-fat sour cream for the lime cream, works just fine; more lime zest is even better (and it needs a dash of salt). All in all, a big success.

My family and I really like this dish, I prepare it often. If you have leftover filling, it is really good as a "dip" with chips.

Rating: 3
This was GREAT. Despite the previous reviews, I tried the crust and it was really good. I did, however, make it more like a caserole in a deep sided caserole dish with the crust pretty much only on the bottom. It was a Monday night dinner hit. The lime sour cream was amazing. Served it with a spicy gaspacho from the Moosewood Sundays book. Great accompanyment.

Rating: 4
The fork # in this review is really only for the filling, because I was scared away by previous crust reviews. I used mixed mexican cheeses and added 1/2 of a chipotle in adobo and 2 cloves of garlic (I made a double recipe). It was incredible and the 8 of us almost went through both pans worth. I just took my favorite pie crust recipe (3 C flour), sans sugar, and added the spices. Rolled each ball out, one for the tart pan, and one for the 8" deep dish stoneware (I don't have two tart pans...). I kind of guessed at that, but it worked perfectly and the filling was just the right amount! That worked great for the crust -- no crumbling and a texture I can rely on. Just my $0.02. Treat yourself, and make this soon!

Rating: 4
This is one of my favorites and I make it not only as one large tart but often prepare it using individual-size tart pans, just do 1 1/2 recipes of the crust and there is enough to do 6 tartlet pans. The lime sour cream really takes this dish over the top!

Rating: 3
Excellent appetizer when cut into squares. I used to saute the corn in the oil, but have dropped that step without any loss of flavor or consistency, which makes this much easier to put together at the last minute.

Rating: 3
This is one of my absolute go-to recipes; I make it time and time again. The ingredients are cheap and often already in the pantry, and the preparation is time-consuming but easy. I always just use two cans of black beans instead of soaking overnight, and I add plenty of fresh-ground pepper to the lime-sour cream accompaniment. This always gets raves, even from the unadventurous.

Have made several times. A rich and hearty vegetarian main course, which at the same time is not at all heavy. The cilantro gives it a delightful zest and fresh taste. Great to serve to meat eating guests at our mostly veggie home.

I rarely make a recipe twice (life is too short), but this was so interesting and makes a nice presentation, I had to make it again for my sister. She also loved it.

For a slightly lighter crust, I halved the butter, and substituted an extra tablespoon of ice water, plus two tablespoons of lowfat sour cream (an adaptation from Sally Schneider's book A New Way to Cook, which is a fantastic resource). The crust turned out great--not too spicy. Could work for almost any bean-salad-type filling.

I made this last night and my husband and I both thought it was absolutely delicious!Although there are quite a few steps, they are all easy ones. I think that the crust is well worth the effort. I used a 10" tart pan and the amount of filling was perfect for it. Making the crust in the food processor is a snap. This recipe is pretty forgiving and can withstand lots of substitutions and additions. I used a little extra corn which I made sure to brown- giving it more of a roasted taste- and substituted chipotle peppers in adobo for the red and jalepeno peppers. I also substituted a red onion for the scallions. This is a very attractive dish which I will certainly make again including for a buffet dinner party we're having a in a couple of weeks.

I wanted to make something pretty for a vegetarian dining with us. My husband who can take or leave black beans loved this dish. The crust is particularly inventive. As for the vegetarian, she had to cancel which pleased my husband. He had the leftovers for lunch.

Not worth the effort in my opinion. Crust was way too dry, spices just not enough to justify the work. Only minor adjustments were made in proportions of veggies (not enough corn, sub. some green pepper). Filling was good, but pretty standard combination. Will use as quesadilla filling, skip the crust alltogether.

Rating: 4
A great hit with everyone who's tried it, lots requesting the recipe. Definitely go with 8 oz of cheese, sprinkle extra on top. I also like using sliced pickled jalapeno -- always in the cupboard -- for extra flavor. Try using a polenta crust (chili flavored) a la Moosewood Cookbook.

To the cook looking for info on vegan-izing the recipe: pie crusts will do quite well with margarine or vegetable shortening (crisco). (If you want butter-flavor, butter-flavored margarine is available.) Cheese substitutes can be somewhat bland, but Jack cheese isn't strong anyways, and there are recipes out there for mock sour cream using silken tofu. (As a vegetarian, not a vegan, I haven't tried them, but I have read about them. Do ask your vegan friend or look online for the "hidden non-vegan ingredients" like casein often found in soy cheeses, etc. These products were developed more for the lactose-intolerant, who can tolerate casein (a milk derivative), and not for vegans.

Right off the bat, I made 3 substitutions in this recipe: whole wheat flour for all-purpose yogurt for sour cream Eidam cheese spiced with red pepper flakes and cumin for Montery Jack (because MJ isn't avaliable here) If I make this again, I will tweak it some more: make more of the yogurt/bean paste to put on the bottom of the tart and less of the veggie mix that went on top (there was a significant amount left over) I won't fry the corn, because it was a nasty mess spitting oil all over the stove area, and it didn't bring any appreciable gain in flavor (just fat) I'll add more cheese, and layer it on top

Delicious. The combination of a pastry crust with the beans was wonderful. I made it two days in a row and it disappeared quickly. I topped it with some extra cheese and did not include the jalapeno, as I did not have any on hand. I also added some hamburger, which tasted great with the other ingredients.

Rating: 4
I have made this several times now and have always had rave reviews. To make this even quicker I use rinsed canned beans and preshredded cheese with the jalapenos already mixed in. Instead of pie weights (not everybody has) I just prick the crust with a fork several times, works great. This is good hot or room temp, all by itself or as part of a meal. A definate favorite in our house.

This dish is repeatable with one major change: cutting the amount of butter in half, if possible. Although the crust smelled fantastic and baked well, the butter flavor was exceedingly overpowering. YUCK. We just ate the filling sans crust. Does anyone have a good substitute for holding the crust together with less butter?

I do a lot of cooking for a vegan friend, and I am frustrated with (what I see as) the lack of options. 2nd Question: has anyone had any luck baking vegan-friendly?

This recipe has become one of my signature dishes for entertaining. Its great for buffets- easy for people to serve themselves, looks great -- all the colors, its a good vegetarian dish as well. I find it works well at room temperature, so that I can prepare it in advance. Sometimes I add chopped cilantro. I add more jalepeno that indicated ( we like it spicy) and usually roast them first. And I often just omit the lime sour cream completely.

This was a great success. Made it for a dinner party and the veggies as well as the carnivores loved it. Could not get canned black beans so used pinto. Also, one friend has an aversion to sweet corn (Hey, don't ask me. I'm just the cook!), so I used peas instead. It looks beautiful and tasted delicious. Served with mixed roasted vegetables and mushrooms stuffed with roasted pine nuts and sundried tomatoes.

This was delicious, and I will definitely use this recipe again. However it was a large tart and very filling, and since there were only two of us I'll be freezing quite a bit of what's left. I used canned black beans, and did not use the bay leaf. I also mixed some tomatos in the filling. I had no problems with the crust, and would love to find other breads in which to use that spice combination. I'm bringing a leftover piece to work tomorrow for lunch

This is a great recipe, and doesn't take long to put together. I usually make two and slice up the second one and freeze it for lunches or nights when we don't have much time to put dinner together. I took previous reviewers' advice and really took the time to simmer the beans with the bay leaves...it makes a difference

Being vegetarian, I'm always looking for new and interesting recipes. I definitely found a winner in this recipe! I make this dish for special occasions and have won over a few meat eaters! It is time consuming, so I suggest making the crust and chopping the vegetables ahead of time. I also use canned black beans but still allow them to simmer for awhile (even though they are already cooked) to allow the bay leaf taste to come through.

I personally thought that there was a lot of filling left over, so I just refrigerated it and put it into quesadillas the next day. Otherwise, I loved it.

The flavors in this recipe are perfectly balanced. It's spicy and filling, with a superb range of flavors in each bite. It's ideal for potluck since it's safe at room temperature for hours. It's a little time-consuming, but if you have the beans already cooked and on hand, and you use a food processor for the crust, you can have it on the table in an hour.

This tart is beautiful to look at. The next time I make it, I would add more chili powder (or at least replace my supply of powder) for zing in the crust.
