This is a very good recipe, but I changed it a bit. I used Canadian bacon instead of chorizo (less fat) and added a little sherry wine to deglaze the pan after I browned the bacon. Also, I served it with Trader Joe's double roasted salsa and the tomato salsa made the meal.

I'm not sure who can cook beans in an uncovered pot for 1 1/2 - 2 hours and they are tender..this was my first fatal flaw when attempting the recipe. My planning was throw off because the beans weren't done. After a solid 4 hours I realized I should put the top on. After that the magic happened and the recipe was DELISH! I used this recipe to fill empanadas, and they were a winner! I modified the dip though, added lime, garlic powder, pepper and cilantro.

Wonderful recipe! A previous reviewer's suggestion to add a fried egg (sunny side up) and pico was truly inspired. Can't imagine this dish being quite as good without it. Can add a few sprigs of cilantro for good measure. With the egg and chorizo, almost enough to make a meal unto itself, though we have served it twice as a side with chicken enchiladas verde and watermelon salad. Oh, and said reviewer is also correct--I don't see any reason to use dried beans. Canned works just as well, and makes this much easier in prep and cook time. Overall, scrumptious.

Pretty good, but a little bland. I added a good amount of salt and gave it more zip with hot sauce and some cayenne. There are some recipes where dried beans are better, but I see no reason why you couldn't use canned for this. I recommend adding a fried egg and some pico de gallo to really send this over the top into flavor town.

I quadrupled the recipe for a Mexican themed potluck party. I added a can of green chilis instead of the jalapeno, 30 big cloves of garlic, 2 cups chicken stock, and put it into a slow cooker on low for 12 hours. My chorizo was REALLY spicy, so I left the sour cream alone. Served with cerveza and lime - YUM!

Like many others, I used canned beans and would continue to use that as part of what I like about this recipe is that it is a quick, weeknight meal. I added the bay leaf when I added the water in the last step, so it only cooked about 10 minutes but that was OK. I am not sure what chipotle hot sauce is but since I didn't have any I used the adobo sauce that canned chipotles are packed in. It is VERY spicy, so I left out the jalapenos. All in all, delicious, quick and satisfying!

Really goo. I made a few substitutions, I had to used canned black beans (I can imagine dried ones are better), didn't have a chile but I had canned chipotles so I used one of those. Next time I'll serve with cooked rice and make a burrito with it, loved the chipotle cream sauce, (again I used chipotle sauce from the can) I'll be using that on other things from now on.

Very good recipe. #1 I use BUFFALO brand chipotle sauce (Fred Meyer and/or Safeway on the west coast, or www.mexgrocer.com). This sauce is awesome and cheap! #2 I used Soy-rizo and Tofutti sour cream (Whole Foods) and then substituted Trader Joe's Cuban-style canned black beans because well, I'm one of those Moms that has very little time during the week! Please forgive me. At any rate, my changes still produced a fabulous dish that my family enjoyed. Oh, and I added more veggies too, like fire-roasted corn and red peppers.

this recipe is even better with the chorizo!! i doubled the recipe yesterday so we would have some for lunch the next day. the taste and texture of many dried beans is so superior to canned that you will have a hard time buying the tins once you try this. definitely a keeper.

this recipe is delicious!!! i couldn't find chorizo so i used medium hot italian sausage. i agree that the chipotle cream is a must. i used 2% greek yogurt and the adobo sauce from a can of chipotles which is what i had on hand. i am excited to try it with the chorizo.

Yummmm! I made this as a side for a make-your-own chicken taco buffet. Now I'm stuck figuring out what to do with all the leftover chicken since most people filled their tortillas with this instead. Next time I'll give it the central billing it deserves! Made as written except used canned beans. The Chipotle cream should not be missed.

I had high hopes for this after all of the very positive reviews. Sadly, it was a great disappointment. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't all that flavorful, despite the ingredients. The chipotle cream was very good and saved the dish from a 1 fork review.

LOVE the Chipotle Cream! I almost halved the amount since it was for two but am so glad I didn't. There wasn't a drop left. This was delicious, and I'll definitely make again and often.

Phenomenal! My new favorite black bean recipe.

LOVE the technique of cooking the beans with onion & herbs. I cook 2lb beans and freeze in 2C quantities. Used pinto beans & served with Spanish rice. It's the Mexican version of Louisiana Red Beans & Rice! Goes well with sauteed zucchinni OR chopped salad (cuke, avocado, tomato, red onion, orange, oregano vinaigrette). Would be good for a crowd.

So delish! A new favorite. My mom made this recipe for the 4th of July and it was a hit. I've scaled it down for last minute weeknight dinners using the soy chorizo and refried black beans from Trader Joe's with a little onion and garlic and the listed seasonings...still so good and ready in about 15 minutes. The Chipotle cream makes it extra yummy and leftovers are great the next day...loves it!

This was a terrific side to fish tacos. Even my 11-year olds gobbled them up.

I should have read the reviews before I made this. I tried making it with dried black beans, soaked overnight of course, and was quite disappointed. It's just lacking in flavor. I may try it again with the canned beans like everyone else did. The chipotle cream, however, is wonderful.

Absolutely delicious! I used canned beans as well and wrapped everything in whole wheat tortillas. I may go vegetarian next time! I highly recommend it.

These beans were really tasty. It's hard to find decent chorizo around here so I used linguica instead and I would highly recommend doing that. The sour cream topping really added something to it.

Wonderful. Couldn't find chorizo, so used a spicy Italian sausage and combined with bacon. Let flavors develop overnight. A great hit for a casual supper.

I also did this with canned beans to save time. I did not use the jalapeno so that my kids would eat it (the chorizo was already spicy) and I used the green tabasco instead of red. Big hit with kids and grownups. Good recipe to double or triple and serve to guests...

Amazing! Used canned beans. I served it with the spinach salad with apples and avocado. Easy weeknight meal. My family loved it.

This was really easy and amazing! I used canned beans and vegetarian chorizo and thought it made a terrific and fairly quick dinner.

These beans are so good! I used canned beans because I didn't have time to soak the beans. I will continue to make it this way.

This made a really excellent weeknight meal! Next time I'll try a different brand of chorizo sausage as mine completely broke down...almost like mush, but tasted good. I used canned beans instead of dried because I saw the recipe and wanted it for dinner tonight. Worked out well and saved a substantial amount of time. LOVED the chipotle cream and will use that in different applications!

What a chore to make, but what a result! The black beans take forever and a day (literally) to make, both with the soaking and then the subsequent cooking. But it is soooo worth it at the end. And the chipolte cream is an absolute MUST in this recipe. I didn't have hot sauce infused with chipoltes, but I did have chipoltes in adobo sauce, and I used the liquid from that plus some regular hot sauce and it turned out amazingly. For what it's worth, I made this with Adobo Chicken in Parchment (meh - it was ok) and Spanish Baked Rice on this site. The beans and rice stole the show by far.
