I've made this several times now, sometimes with kale, sometimes with collard greens. I love this dish. The last time I made it, I added red pepper flakes and paprika to the potatoes as they cooked. Like many other reviewers, I only use 1/2 c. oil. It is PLENTY for the recipe. And with a nonstick pan, you still have a little oil left over if you want to use it in something else. It is labor-intensive for a week night, and generates lots of dish washing. In the future, I'll try frozen greens to see if that speeds it up without sacrificing flavor.

I had a bowl of onions and potatoes staring at me on the counter today which led to an intense craving for Spanish Tortilla. I found this recipe and luckily, I also had a bunch of kale wilting in the fridge. Superyum! Even the kids loved it! Mods: Used 1/2 cup of olive oil to poach potatoes and onions, used a little less salt than is called for. After I cooked the omelet for 12 minutes covered - I put it under the broiler for 3 minutes to finish it off. Perfection! Great recipe to have in the vegetarian repertoire!

Turned out very well, though I failed to add enough salt.

An American who also lived in Spain for awhile, I found this to really authentic in flavor to the traditional spanish tortilla. I used only a 1/2 cup of oil and didn't change anything else. Slightly less salt next time, but excellent dish and worth the wait.

I love this recipe. I follow the instructions almost exactly, with these slight modifications: I only use a 1/2 cup of oil, I keep the lid on the pan for at least half of the first 20 minutes while the potatoes & onions cook, and I add some black pepper. It's simple, cheap, and always delicious. The only drawback is that, at almost 2 hours, it's pretty time-consuming for a weekday. But the results are worth it.

I made this recipe with purple potatoes and red chard from the farmers market that I had on hand. I also mixed in some fresh chives, the result was colorful and delicious...a big hit at dinner. I didn't think it was oily at all and in fact saved the oil to cook with tomorrow!

I was worried that the tortilla wouldn't cook through so I kept the heat just above low heat on my gas range. It was a bit overdone, my mistake, but the flavor was unreal. This is one of the first egg dishes I have tried that doesn't need cheese to be wonderful. I used a seasoned cast iron skillet and had no problems with it sticking. This is a luxe vegetarian dish to add to your skill base.

I thought this was a great idea. I've been make the traditional Spanish tortilla for many, many years. Of course it's not going to taste like the traditional Spanish tortilla, with the addition of the kale, but it's a very healthy change. I don't find it labor intensive at all, and the leftovers are even better than the first time it's served. We loved this variation, and while it won't replace the traditional version, we will certainly have it again!

Being an American living in Spain I can say this, there are too many lazy Americans who seek immediate gratification. Spanish tortillas are very economical and delicious. I'm off to make one right now!!! Thanks for the recipe!

proscuizo, did you read the introduction to the review? Poaching the potatoes and onion in the oil over low heat is a key element to this recipe -- it's a big part of what makes it "Spanish". If you do it right, the vegetables shouldn't be oily at all. I laugh at the notion that this recipe is "involved." In fact, it's so simple, I don't know why it was posted at all.

Do we really need a recipe for a bleeding omelette? D#@n!

First of all, it didn't taste like the real thing (the real thing being the actual Spanish Tortilla). In addition, it's way too involved. Boiling, and preparing potatoes, then cooling the mixture, then making the actual omelet... Just doesn't seem worth it, though it did taste good in the end. One tip for those who want to make it: don't bother with flipping the tortilla, just put it under the broiler for 5 minutes.

I bought a bad of frozen chopped kale. Thaw at room temperature, press out the excess water and add to the potato mixture. Lots of time save and as delicious.

Good weeknight recipe. A bit labor intensive, but the leftovers were great as well.

Divine! To cut back on the oil, I microwaved the potatoes 3 mins then added them to the onions. I used enough olive oil to slightly carmalize the onions and brown the potatoes to give it a richer flavor. Followed the rest verbatim. Used dino kale and the outcome was fabulous.

Yummy! Perfect one-dish meal for brunch or supper. Only addition was a bit of garlic and black pepper.

I much prefer tortilla without kale.

this was really good. taking the time to poach the pots, kale, onions and garlic in oil was worth it. i thought there may be too much oil in the whole thing, but it all turned out beyond my expectations. i did it in a cast iron skillet, took longer than expected to cook the sides but i just kept cooking it. then i let it sit as directed, and broiled the top. very well received.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish. I was in a hurry so I diced the potatoes and put them in the microwave for a minute. I did eveything else according to the recipe but I added a little garlic. I have cast iron tapas dishes so I made individual servings. We will make again. Very easy

Fab. I omitted the kale (yeah yeah it makes it interesting but what do I care? Didn't feel like buying kale.) and it was just like the tortillas that I had when I was in Spain. For a non-authentic, but frugal, way to make this, par-boil the potatoes beforehand and then add them and the onions and cook until the onions are translucent. I don't notice any difference in the flavour and it saves some oil. However, you really ought to use the oil again because it doesn't go bad and it tastes wonderful. Very simple and easy to make, as well as delicious.

Very good. I needed something simple to compliment the other dishes I made. I diced the potatoes and fried with onions and garlic as if I were making homestyle potatoes with the skin on (didn't use all of the oil) and added the kale. Flipped once to show browned bottom. Not difficult, just make sure to use a knife around the edge before flipping and a platter only slightly larger than the pan.

I use a mandolin to slice the onion and potatoes; after these are sauteed, I add them to the eggs and let the mixture rest 15 minutes before putting everything back into the pan to finish. Red potatoes work great, especially if slicing very thin. If you don't have a boiler proof pan, oiling a plate the size of the pan, flipping the tortilla upside down, then sliding it back into the pan is way less messy then you would think. I also add LOTS of garlic!

I parboiled the potato cubes just slightly, and added the kale to the same pot to blanch. Drained them both, and then cooked as directed with the onion in the oil. (I always seem to have trouble getting my potatoes to cook in a decent amount of time when I put them raw into oil). Used my cast iron skillet for the whole thing; just cleaned it out before adding back in the oil and the egg mixture. I used the broiler technique suggested by others, as well as saving the oil for dipping bread. Admittedly it's not the most rapid recipe, but it's not bad for a weeknight, and the flavor was wonderful. I'll definitely make this again.

Very good. Served with the Peppers, Sausage and Seafood Paella from this site at a dinner party. I prepared the potatoes as described and they were not oily at all.

This tastes just like tortillas that I enjoyed in Spain many years ago. I have tried many other recipes that have never come close. I served it with a nice tart salad, crusty bread and red wine. I was transported to sunny Spain. I used the full amount of oil and most of it drained right out of the veggies. This oil is dark green from the kale and is delicious for dipping crusty bread in.

This is pretty good, but uses too many dishes and too much oil, and nutrients are reduced by peeling the potatoes and boiling the kale. So here's what works better for me: * heat 3 Tb oil in pan. add potatoes, onion and salt, and cook until tender * remove center ribs from kale and chop * add kale to potato mixture along with 3 Tb water, cover and cook * beat eggs in a large bowl with 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper (I added extra salt and pepper because it was a little too bland for me) * add veggie mixture to egg and stir * grease skillet (I used olive oil Pam), and cook as directed

Good standard tortilla recipe. One note: don't bother with the gflipping exercise. Cheat the way Spanish cooks do: run it under the broiler for 3-5 mins to set the top. Save yourself trouble!

This was very good. I found that the kale absorbed quite a bit of the oil. After using an entire cup I hoped that more would be poured off but only about 1/3 of a cup drained out of the mixture. I had some trouble with the flipping so it didnt look *quite* like the picture but it was still delicious.

There's a similar dish that we always order at the tapas restaurant down the street. This recipe has exceeded my expectations and I think I'll be making it at home from now on! I cheated on the poaching-potatoes-in-cup-of-oil part...all of that oil made me nervous. Also, I didn't have the almost two hours required to make this dish according to the exact directions, so I microwaved the potatoes first (I know the purists are thinking, "Travesty!") and then doused them with a liberal amount (about 2 tbsp) of olive oil and sauteed them with the onions...for the remainder, I followed the directions though. I did not think that this method (as opposed to the poaching) affected the taste in any way. It still tasted remarkably similar to the 'authentic' version we've had before.

A very satisfying dish; exactly what we were craving. I made a few adjustments that seem to have served us well. I was spooked by the reference to a whole cup of oil in this recipe, and so I subbed a half-cup instead. There was nothing to drain off, and we didn't miss that extra half-cup of fat in this sumptuous delicacy at all. I also used 7 extra-large eggs, cause that was what the store had, and this also turned out fine. This tortilla is exquisite to look at...I can't believe how "professional" it looks as I admire it on our counter. My sister lives in Spain, and this looks exactly like the country fare that she prepares (even though I don't think that she adds any greens). Only other revisions I made were to add a generous grating of fresh black pepper to the egg mixture, and a very generous sprinkling of salt once this lovely dish reached the plate.

Good base recipe from which to make many interesting variations. I ended up altering the cooking method a bit due to time constraint. After the initial cook time which set the bottom and sides of the tortilla, I put it straight under a preheated broiler (uncovered) for approximately 6 minutes until the center was set. This saved me 20 minutes. It came out perfectly cooked, lacking no moisture. One thing I would definitely change is to add much fresh ground pepper to the egg.

Actually, I grew up with a variation on this dish. In my mother's home it was made with spinach. It can be served hot or cold. Cut it into wedges, and it is an excellent afterschool snack or appetizer
