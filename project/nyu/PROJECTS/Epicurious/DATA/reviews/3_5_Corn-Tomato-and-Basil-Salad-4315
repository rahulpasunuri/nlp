I have been wanting to make this recipe for years - I had noted it in the original magazine in 1997 and hadn't gotten around to trying it. Given all the stellar reviews over the years, I was expecting a great summer salad. Boy was I disappointed. I made it exactly as stated. The salad was just okay. I felt the fresh basil got overwhelmed by the other ingredients and you really didn't taste it. Oh well . . . !

I made this for a picnic and only one person commented on it. I thought it was just OK as well. Nothing spectacular. There are better corn/tomato recipes on this site.

I combined the suggestions of two other reviewers and used a bag of frozen corn and heated it with the garlic and oil(didn't notice that the oil amount was split) and then put it in the bowl with the tomatoes and basil and vinegar. Just before serving I added some cubed avocado. A great summer salad and a great side for fish tacos( used the Food Network and Emeril as inspiration for those.

I've been making this recipe since it was first published in 1997. It was a huge hit then...it was a huge hit last night at dinner. It's so fresh tasting. Today it's going to be spectacular now that it's had a chance to "blend".

I've made this summer salad numerous times; I also like using grape tomatoes, especially yellow ones I find in the farmer's market.

My new favorite summer side. I use these grape tomatoes (about a pint) that grow like crazy in my garden. Today I tried frozen corn and it was good. Delicious!

Fabulous. I made this for a large crowd, substituted with frozen corn, decreased the oil & vinegar and added avacados and red pepper. Lots of requests for the recipe.

I've made this salad for years. It's so simple I don't even have a copy of it. I make it easier by using a bag of frozen white corn and heat it up in a skillet with olive oil and garlic. Once it's no longer frozen I put it in a bowl and and the tomatoes, basil, and dressing.

I am crazy about this salad. I have been making it for 8 years and every summer I look forward to making it again. The description is right, it's the "essence of summer." I think it's even better on day 2. I have never even been tempted to modify the recipe - in my opinion it's perfect as is. It's my standard dish to bring to summer parties and it's always the first thing to go on the buffet.

A wonderful summer salad and easy, too. I made the recipe exactly as written and will continue to do so. I may like it even better before it is chilled.

This recipe was good, but lacked something. I added a little bit of finely diced red onion, which helped, but didn't make it 'great'.

I blended the dressing and it added a touch of brown sugar. delicious! I even used frozen corn(trader Joe's brand....the best!)

This is delicious, earning rave reviews at a recent dinner party. I didn't see the earlier notes about reducing the oil and vinegar, but I will definitely do that next time. It was so soupy that I poured off much of the liquid before serving the dish.

I made this for a dinner party, and it got rave reviews. Next time I might reduce the oil and vinegar by a tablespoon each; it was a little soupy and I poured off some of the liquid before serving the dish.

I have made this many times and am making it tonight for the first time this season with fresh corn and home grown tomatoes and basil. I almost always steam the corn and then cut it off the cob. It's just so much easier and it still tastes fresh and summery. It's one of our favorites.

Used fresh white corn from the farmers market which was very sweet. It wasn't fun cutting the kernels off the cob but the end result was well worth it.

We just didn't care for this as much as we expected. Look at all the flavors..corn, tomato, basil, what's not to like? I think it would have been much better without the balsamic vinegar.

Super easy and delicious. Like some other reviewers I used frozen corn (Trader Joe's white corn) and thought it was almost as good as fresh and 10 times easier. I used a combo of small plum tomatoes and heirlooms and added about 1/2 tbsp of salt. Brought it to a BBQ where it received raves.

I have been making this recipe religiously since 1997 when it showed up in Bon Appetit..Every time I make it I get rave reviews and requests for the recipe...This is so quick to make. I buy frozen white corn and just keep it in the freezer for that impromptu dinner or bbq that always seems to pop up on your way home from work.

Very good. I added some butter to the olive oil when I was cooking the corn -- just to gild the lily!

This was simple and delicious. I cut the olive oil and balsamic by 1 T each, as suggested previously. I also added the garlic along with the corn, since I didn't want to take a chance on it burning. Perfect summer recipe!

Made this dish for a very large gathering, it practically dissappeared. It was cool and refreshing. I used grape tomatoes and extra basil, very delicious!

I think this recipe is great. I've changed a few things slightly, taking many suggestions from the other reviewers - thank you all! Decrease the olive oil and balsamic vinegar (5 tablespoons olive oil to 4, and 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar to 2). Use the white balsamic for the nicer color. Add extra garlic (I sautee it with the oil as the recipe indicates - haven't had any trouble with burning it as a few reviewers mentioned). Wait to add all the basil until after cooking. Plus, add some good cayenne pepper at the end to taste, which I think is the extra secret ingredient - I love that touch of spiciness. I've also tried adding a bit of cumin, which is nice too. I always use the fresh corn - it's so wonderful! seems like you can't go wrong with fresh corn in anything. Though haven't figured out how to cut the corn off the cob without make a bit of a mess (all part of the fun).

The ultimate, easy summer salad. I've made it several times for different gatherings and it's always been a hit. As said below, it's even good with frozen corn, but nothing beats fresh silver queen.

Great as a "relish" with grilled chicken breasts. I must admit I reduced the amount of oil to make it slightly more low-cal and increased the garlic to make it more pungent!

I've made this dish many times. It is wonderful! I usually don't bother cutting the corn from the cob. Frozen sweet corn works wonderfully and makes this dish quick and easy!

This is one of my favorite summer salads. It is so wonderful, refreshing and bursting w/flavor. I only use a good quality white balsamic vinegar and I wait till the salad is cooled before adding fresh chopped summer tomatoes, cherry or grape tomatoes. The quantity of sliced basil makes it very pretty. It keeps 2-3 days in refrigerator. Great w/any summer entre.

This was ok but I thought the balsamic vinegar was a bit overpowering. Maybe I'm just tired of recipes with the tomato/basil/balsamic combo. While the presentation is good I thought the flavor was more interesting before I added the vinegar. Next time I'll try one of the many other corn salad recipes on this site

Delicious & simple to make! As soon as people see corn in the grocery store, I start getting requests for this salad. It's even better the next day, by the way! If your skillet is big enough, this is a simple recipe to double!

Everyone loved this dish! I, too, threw the garlic in with the corn at the end to prevent the garlic from burning. I did not add the extra oil, so the only oil in the salad was what was used to sautee the corn. The entire amount of basil was added an hour before serving; the color and flavor remained bright. Will definitely make again and again.

I have made this recipe year after year. People love it, I love it. This year I made it with tomatos from my garden & it was even more satisfying.

This is a really easy, tasty, and colorful salad. We served it in a blue bowl with a red towel underneath to hide the cold packs and took it to a 4th of July party. It received very good comments. Make this salad ahead it is best after chilling for a few hours so the flavors can blend. The most work involved is cutting the corn so a nice heavy knife is important. I used a bi-color corn which worked fine. I handled the dressing like many vinigarettes and halved the vinegar to the oil then whisked it before dressing the salad. Next time I will up the vinegar a bit.(I used 10 ears of corn and dressed it with 4 Tbls oil & 2 Tbls vinegar.

I doubled the recipe, using 2 bags of frozen white corn. The corn didn't have much taste and the vinegar overpowered the whole dish. Everyone loved it, but I will make it with fresh corn and less vinegar next time.

I served this with grilled marinated flank steak and potato gratin with goat cheese and garlic (both also from this site) I did use frozen corn, but still sauteed it with the garlic, as well as some chopped onion that was extra from making the marinade. I substituted cilantro for the basil, mainly because it's too early for my basil here in Wisconsin, but the cilantro is already trying to take over my herb garden!! It was great. I'll definitely make this again, and probably continue to vary the herbs to match the meal. With red onions and some black beans (perhaps a touch of cumin with the sauteed stuff, and keep the cilantro).........

This is a "tried and true" recipe I've been making it regularly since it's publication. I agree with the garlic tip - don't add it until the corn is almost done. I usually roast the corn on the BBQ and then finish in the pan with garlic. I also add all the basil at the end to prevent browning.

For those who use frozen or canned corn, 6 ears is equivalent to 3 cups of corn. This was a great recipe; I've used it several times, always to rave reviews. I agree with the earlier comment, cook the garlic with the corn. Otherwise, it will brown. I also added red onion, salt and pepper to the finished dish and only used 2/3 of the balsamic vinegar. I used drained, canned diced tomatoes; the Red Gold brand is great. Also, the basil will darken if added to the heated dish. I waited until it had cooled so that the basil would keep its green color which I find more attractive.

Couldn't find white corn, so used bicolor(not wanting to use canned or frozen). Excellent recipe. Have made three times for barbecues since first printed and it is always a hit. This recipe is great as is.

I made this for a group of my girlfriends over the weekend, and we loved it. It was easy to prepare. My grocery store for some strange reason did not have corn-on-the-cob in July, so I used frozen white corn. It worked perfectly! I added extra garlic to the corn saute and added in one zucchini, two cucumbers, two celery stalks and two extra tomatoes. I also upped the vinegar content. It could have used something else -- was slighty bland; salt & pepper worked fine this time, maybe a few jalapenos.

This is a good recipe but next time I make this I would saute the corn for 4 mins & then add the garlic for 1 min so it doesn't burn. Also, I thougt the vinegar was a little too much. Next time I would add the vinegar to the pan & cook the excess off.

To make this quicker to put together, I used canned white corn and skipped sauteeing it with garlic. I also added finely diced red onion. It was wonderful and raved about at the BBQ.
