A very simple, lovely treat! The pear is a very mild and mellow flavor which is a perfect match for the cardamom. I used the seeds from 2 cardamom pods and it was perfect. Consistency was much better on day 1--it got a little too icy in my freezer overnight. Still delicious though.

This benefits from making the base at least 24 hours in advance and letting the cardamom really infuse the nectar. Served it after Thanksgiving dinner for a palate refresher. It's great other time with ginger cookies.

This was a refreshing sorbet. However, it wasn't unique enough that I would make it again. I thought it was perfect for what is was though; I omitted extra sugar and doubled the cardamom (which was still pleasantly subtle). Perfect amount of sweetness and spice. Was a quick, light midday dessert.

This recipe was easy to make and absolutely delicious. A gourmet cook and a teenager swooned over it.

This dish was pleasant-but not tasty enough for me to make again.

This was so easy to make but makes such a big impression when served in between courses or at the end of a meal. Great flavor and very refreshing. I pre-scooped the sorbet and put the scoops in muffin tins in the freezer ahead of time so serving time was quick and easy and looked really nice.

This was excellent. It is a simple recipe, but produces a very nice sorbet with a unique taste. The finished product received many compliments from my guests.

OK, this recipe is a gem. So easy and absolutely delicious. I would make it for any dinner, casual or formal. We just returned from a 14 day cruise where we ate lots of interesting sorbet on board. This one is far superior to any we tasted.

Delicious and easy! What could be better? I served a pear trio for Christmas dessert using this sorbet, Pear Spice Cake (without the Pecan Praline Topping) and Pears Poached in Red Wine , Cardamon and Orange-all from Epicurious. It was a hit with everyone, especially my lactose intolerant sister-in-law.

This turned out really well (and it was the first time I used an ice cream maker as well). I used confectioner's sugar (wasn't sure if that was what was called for, but it worked well) and used about 3/4 of the amount called for. Also, I almost doubled the cardamom (I love cardamom!). This was a very easy and fairly healthy dessert that I highly recommend.
