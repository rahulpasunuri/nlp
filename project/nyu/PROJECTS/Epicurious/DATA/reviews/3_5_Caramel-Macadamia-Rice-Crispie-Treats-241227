Delicious. I love salted caramel and this was on the verge of too salty. . . next time I'll aim for under-salting by a pinch. I had no issues with the caramel - it did appear to seize up when I added the cream, but with half a minute of heat and stirring it smoothed out. I also don't find this to be a small recipe in the least. A 1.5" x 2.5" piece is plenty and the recipe made a plateful of those.

this is so odd...I've made caramel many, many times and never had any problems. But I tried the recipe twice and the cream curdled. The first time I thought it was because the cream I used was a little old, but when it happened a second time with fresh cream, I was shocked. Any thoughts?

I must have done something wrong with the recipe.When I poured the cream into the caramel,it turn into curds. I had to dump the whole thing. Can people who have made this give some advice?

This recipe is absolutely delicious, and much more sophisticated than most sweets. The salty/sweet combination is great, no need to change the recipe one bit. If you're making for a crowd, make a double batch -- one recipe is quite small. I skipped the chocolate drizzle and like it better that way.

I made these without any salt or macadmaia nuts and they were a hit at a friend's 40th birthday party. Also, I forgot to pick up cream so just used full fat milk and the caramel was fine too.

These are a great spin on an old treat. Use a little less salt especially if your nuts are salty and make sure you grease the parchment very well. Unlike previous reviewer, the carmel turned out beautifully.

This recipe tasted horrible. Too salty and the caramel didn't turn out sweet.

Pardon me Chef English, perhaps there was an error in copying if not, 2 tsps salt with salted nuts is WAAAY too salty to be tasty or healthy.

I sprinkled with Fleur de sel salt after mixing the cereal with the caramel. A great sweet,salty treat! When making the caramel, dark amber should be the color of Cracker jacks. And no matter what, don't stir the sugar/water mixture when you are making the caramel!

After 6 attempts at this recipe, I still have not found the results satisfactory. Too bad! Was hoping for more. Maybe something in the instructions or ingredients was missing.

Cook from NY - Caramel is the sugar, butter, cream mixture - I wonder if you could save time melting a bag of caramels? Sorry for the post here, epicurious needs a better feature to allow specific forums. :)

the caramel part isn't missing. when you cook sugar and water together (and then add cream and butter), you're making caramel. this does sound a little more like "rice crispie and macadamia-nut brittle" rather than anything resembling a traditional rice krispie treat, though.

Doesn't it seem like the caramel part of the recipe is missing from the ingredients?
