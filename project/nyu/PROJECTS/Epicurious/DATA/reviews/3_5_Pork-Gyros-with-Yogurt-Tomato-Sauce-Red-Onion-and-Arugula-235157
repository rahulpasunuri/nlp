I only used the marinade for the pork as I wanted to make a traditional Gyros having just come back from Athens and Crete. The marinade was immense and the choice of pork cut made for a swanky change from the fattier crispier cuts we had in Greece. Next time I will use pork shoulder, grill it slower and longer, and sprinkle dried oregano lightly over the cooked product like they did in most of the cafes we ate at. The marinade itself is spot on.

Pork didn't have much zing. I marinated it for 2 days, but perhaps ought to have cut it up first. It was fine, but didn't have that gyros taste that I wanted.

Yum!!! This is my favorite gyro recipe. The pork was so flavorful! We did pork and flank steak with this marinade, both were excellent, but I did prefer the pork. I did not use this yogurt sauce because I have a favorite recipe already. Will be making again and again.

This was wonderful! Marinated for 48 hrs because of unexpected sports events - so good! Based on other reviews I served thinly sliced tomato on a platter with thinly sliced red onions, arugula, and a pile of chopped up feta. I bought flat bread from Trader Joe's and had my husband grill it alongside the pork. I hate dill, so I used oregano in the sauce and it was wonderful. Served with a greek salad (also from this site) and loved it!

This recipe is fabulous! I never make things according to recipe, but this I did and was not sorry. (alright, I may have added an additional garlic, but that doesn't count.) This is so great, my girlfriend, who I gave a sample, hates to cook, but is coming over now for a cooking lesson, just so she can make it on her own.

I am notorious for "slightly modifying" recipes, and this recipe is fabulous as is - worthy of being offered to weekend guests, and fast enough to serve to your family on a weeknight packed with activities! I didn't have fresh oregano, so I substituted dried - no problem! My family loves greek food, and always devours tzatzki... this sauce was proclaimed "better than tzatzki" by my 15 and 11 year olds! Served up with some boiled "greek potatoes", and had a fabulous meal!

To the Canadian cook below: in the magazine, this recipe is presented as part of a large buffet-- which is why the yield is 12. Hope this clears up any confusion.

Made this for supper last night. I had 1 1/2 lbs. of pork tenderloin (2 meals for 2 people) and we'll get 4 meals total from it. Considering that the recipe calls for a total of 2 lbs. of tenderloin, I hardly doubt it would feed 12. In any case, it was all very, very easy to make. I really liked the sauce and next time, will put fresh tomato into the pita. I also soaked the red onion in cold water for 1/2 an hour to take some of the sharpness out of it. This doesn't affect the flavour. Served it with the Cheese, Herb and Sundried Tomato Phyllo Rolls and green and yellow beans with almonds. I'll definitely make this again.

This was an excellent recipe. I used a paring knife to make some holes in the Pork Loin then added some slivers of Garlic while it marinaded over night. This recipe is definitely a keeper

I only made the marinade for the pork, and I used pork loin, and they were great. I also made the green bean and cherry tomato salad from this site , and Greek rice pulaf from recipezaar to go with this. I will make again and use the pitas. Outstanding meal.

This was the most tender pork I've ever had. We will make the pork again. The sauce was good, too, but what I love most about this recipe is the marinade for the pork.

Easy and delicious. The pork was very flavorful and the sauce was out of this world!

This was terrific. I did the sauce just as called for, but also added fresh tomatoes to the serving platter. It was a big hit. Easy, fun and delicious.

Surprisingly tasty. Easy. Perfect summer meal. I followed others in serving sliced tomatoes rather than putting in sauce.

The pork and sauce were delicious. I think we grilled the pitas too long so they were more crispy rather than soft and pliable. I agree with the reviewer who would stuff some tomatoes in the sandwich also. We will definitely try this again!!!

A nice alternative with the pork. The garlic is pretty heavy in the sauce, I may cut back a little and let the dill shine. Tomatoes go unnoticed in the sauce, maybe serve them fresh on the gyro or cut them out entirely. I couldn't find flatbread anywhere for some reason -- which was frustrating because the pitas fall apart and are really uncapable of containing anything. Otherwise good flavors happening.

Stir with the other 6 ingredients in a medium bowl.

What does one do with the 7th ingredient for the sauce?

I love gyros and only make them from turkey meat. Also, I only use Greek yoghurt for making the sauce. This sauce is good though.
