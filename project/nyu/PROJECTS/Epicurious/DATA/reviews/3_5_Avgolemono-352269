My husband and I just had this for lunch and found it delicious. My husband can't have gluten so I used rice rather than orzo and followed another poster's suggestion to increase it to 1/3 cup. After adding the eggs I also stirred in ~1 cup shredded chicken. If you are serving this as the main course there is probably only enough for 2-3 people. Four servings would be a starter.

This soup couldn't be more easy or fast. The only changes I made were that I increased the orzo to 1/3 cup since I prefer a bit more... and after tasting I added more lemon juice. It is a fairly thin soup and it does not make a lot (a small serving for 3 people at most)... but I plan to add a little shredded rotisserie chicken and have with a big salad to stretch it and round it out and it should be perfect. Very pleased. This is one of my favorite simple soups and I'm certain I'll make it again and again.

I thought this soup was excellent for a quickie. I waited to add lemon to egg until right before I added to soup. I added two ladles, (one at a time), of hot soup while mixing continuously. This will keep it from curdling (or getting stringy). Then I added the egg-lemon-soup mixture back into the pot still mixing until all combined. It worked well for the right consistency.

I am a total simple soup lover but this recipe was very eggy and I could taste too much lemon. I also think 1/4th cup too little orzo, would have been better with 3/4 cup. I would love to get the real thing at a restaurant and then compare.

This is awesome! My boyfriend asked me to make it again!!! This time, I will double it. I also added the chicken - made it double the yummy!!!

Great, easy, delicious. I suspect the reviewer woes eggs curdled skipped step 4 (tempering the eggs with hot broth). Even our kids loved it! Will go into the weeknight rotation.

I have been dining at this greek restaurant for a long time now JUST to eat the Avgolemono soup. I finally decided to make it at home and found this glorious recipe. I say glorious because this soup turned out 5 times better than what I was having at my greek restaurant. I cannot say one negative comment, this soup is PERFECT! Although, it doesn't make a ton, I can almost eat it all by myself.

I would give this 2.5 forks. It was definitely good, but not amazing or foolproof. When I stirred the eggs into the soup, I got stringy/clumpy egg whites (I was stirring them in with a whisk). I switched the whisk for a spoon and they mostly disappeared. I'm surprised no other reviewers mentioned this. I left the soup on the stove for a while (after I ate my first bowl) and it seemed to get a thicker, creamier, better texture. I brought it in for lunch today and am looking forward to the leftovers. Will make again and try to fix the egg white issue.

I just made and ate this a few minutes ago. It was amazing. It tastes just like the local authentic greek restaurant in my city. So easy to make, however, it doesn't make a whole lot, it served 3 but barely! We were scraping the pot :)

This is my favorite soup at Greek restaurants, I had no idea it was so simple to make. Next time I will use rice in place of orzo, I like the texture better. Also, I added in a bit more lemon juice to really bring out the flavor.

Very easy. My husband and daughter love this soup. I was also able to make it for myself with a few modifications being that i am a vegetarian. I used vege broth and, instead of the roast chicken i used for my husbands soup, i used quorn brand fake chicken. Its great!

I just made this for the first time and it's absolutely delicious! I was a bit nervous because I remember hearing stories from my mother about her Greek parents making avgolemono sauce. They would argue over the stove about when to add the eggs, each believing they knew just the right moment to add and stir. Luckily, it was super easy. My soup looked exactly like it should, creamy yellow and smooth. I tweaked it a bit, adding more lemon and shredded chicken from a lemon and oregano chicken I'd baked the night before. I can tell this will be a staple in the house. Great recipe!

This soup is wonderful. Instead of lemon for the lemon/egg mixture I use yogurt. The proportion is 3 tablespoons of yogurt to one egg. If a creamier consistency is preferred, double the yogurt/egg mixture. Add some lemon for serving :)

Easy winter soup - added chicken and little extra lemon.

Delicious and easy. Yum. Added roasted chicken, too. Also works for jaw surgey liquid diet with some good blenderizing, but do adjust to increase flavor with additional lemon juice and salt if you blender in some chicken as it dilutes the flavor.

I didn't like this. I don't know if it was the chicken broth I used or what, but all I could taste was lemon.

So good. So easy. I ate three bowls of it.

Excellent soup. I used more lemon. First time I made it, I made the mistake of overcooking the eggs and not stirring enough. It was tasty but didn't look good because the eggs weren't smooth. But it is delicious!

Eating this now - lovely. For those who find it bland - it is supposed to be simple flavors of chicken broth and lemon and it is. It is a little on the thin side for me. I saw another reviewer say to add more eggs for thicker soup, so I'll try that next time. Would be great with a tangy salad.

This soup didn't turn out for me at all. The flavour was bland. Perhaps the difference lies in making home made broth, but I just used Pacific organic chicken broth, and it was nothing like what I have had in restaurants.

I tempered the eggs correctly and everything and this had a weird eggy flavor to it. Added way more lemon then it calls for and it still couldn't drown out the egg taste.

Mmmmm, super easy, I added pepper. Prefect comfort food.

I loved how simple, healthy and very flavorful this is. I used rice which of course needs to simmer longer than orzo. My picky sister was visiting and loved it, and said she was impressed with what a good cook I am. She has no idea how simple it is. It tases rich, as if there is a touch of cream in it. Husband loved it too.

Just like our favorite Greek restaurant here in San Antonio!!! INCREDIBLY EASY TO MAKE.

This is a great go-to recipe when you crave smth warm and easy-to-make but are sick of chicken noodle soup! I followed the recipe but made it with rice. The only modification I made was that I let a ladle of broth cool a little bit and then added it to the egg and lemon mixture. I then added it to the broth wisking quickly. I love this soup and will make it again!

The first time I made this soup, I added the lemon juice and eggs directly into the saucepan with the rice and broth. The consistency was perfect and we raved about how it tasted better than at any restaurant. Tonight, I followed the directions and the egg turned stringy before I even added my egg, lemon, 1c broth mixture back into the main sauce pan. All in all, a fantastic recipe and wonderful paired with a fresh greek salad and baked chicken breasts with greek seasoning.

This is my favorite soup!! I used to find it at my favorite greek restaurant in Seattle. The basic recipe is best, with more lemon. I weouldn't add anything to it! Good served with warm crusty drop-biscuits with garlic butter; roasted chicken -- Then follow it with some Arugula with pignolias and minces red onion with a dressing of fresh-squeezed lemon and grapeseed oil dressing and Pacific Rim Reisling.

Thanks, Victoria! Nice, classic recipe. A few suggestions: Try adding fresh parsley or fresh dill in the last few minutes of preparation, and lots of freshly ground black pepper. An alternative to orzo or rice is wide egg noodles broken up in to smallish pieces. Trader Joe's in the U.S. markets lemon-pepper pappardelle, which provide a non-traditional but flavorful twist if you're feeling adventurous. As for the proportion of lemon, most Greek cooks would use the juice of about 2 lemons for that quantity of broth. I use 3 lemons for 6 cups of broth.

I come from a greek household, and recently my mother, who was ill, asked me to make this soup. As I didn't have her "old world" recipe, I used this one. She was skeptical at first, but very pleasantly surprised that is tasted exactly like her recipe. Use more eggs for a thicker soup, and my suggestion is to cook the rice separately in chicken broth, then serve it in the bottom of the bowl.

I love Greek egg lemon soup and this recipe was absolutely delicious (and super easy). I made for my boyfriend as well who was a bit turned off by the concept of "egg soup," but once he tried it, he loved it as well. Added pulled roast chicken and used rice since I prefer it over orzo in this soup.

Made again with orzo. Liked the fusilli pasta better than the orzo. More texture. A bit tricky for me to keep the egg from separating, but it doesn't affect the taste, so no biggie. This is a delicate creamy soup for those who appreciate subtle flavors. The typical American palate mind find it underwhelming.

Easy and delicious. I cooked about 1 c small rotini-like pasta in the broth instead of orzo. I can see this being a regular meal. Would taste amazing with chicken.

I have to say that it is pretty tasteless. I added some chicken, extra lemon, and artichokes and I still thought it to be bland. I bet, if you grew up on it, it has a special place in your heart but I just found it incredibly bland.

Very delicious! This is now my new favorite soup. I didn't have enough chicken broth on hand, so used a can of cream of chicken soup, 1/2 can water, along with one can of broth. It worked great. I also added in some ground broiled chicken breast. Was even better today after chilling overnight.

Not increadibly flavorable, but hey, it takes like ten minutes to make! A good side dish espically if you're having picky eaters over and a great use of pantry staples!

So delicious! This is a childhood favorite of mine from the local Greek deli and this recipe was perfect. I added shredded roast chicken and also halved, canned artichokes to make it a little heartier. I think this will become a staple. The whole process took under 25 minutes.

I love this soup!! I always add extra lemon to my own bowl too... delicious and easy on a weekday night!!
