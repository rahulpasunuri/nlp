Terrific recipe. Served it to two foodies who promptly raved. I agree with the reviewer who mentioned that the quality and quantity of the parmesan is critical.

Certainly healthy, but similar to eating lawn. With lemon juice. It lacks some oomph- I thought the pumpkin seeds and cheese would give it a nice richness, but no. I love this recipe on paper, just not in my mouth.

we loved this salad (except for the littlest "we's")! It was so fresh and crunchy. I made it more or less as described and brought it to a dinner party where I the host promptly requested the recipe. We thought the toasted pumpkin seeds added a nice earthy counterpoint to the lemon. Don't skip the shaved parmesan- use a good quality one- it wouldn't be the same without it. Mmmm!

I seem to be the only one to review this salad so far that didn't enjoy it. You can read my full review on my blog and get other recipe ideas and reviews: http://justinliew.com/tonightsdinner/?p=142

This salad is really nice. I added radicchio for color variety, and skipped the cheese b/c we were having pizza. You could skip the pumpkin seeds too if you wanted a veggie-only salad. Definitely not a kid-friendly salad! Even the adults said maybe add something sweeter, like orange instead of lemon, or maybe I would add honey to the dressing, though I prefer the tangy lemon as it was. I used a mandolin to slice the celery and fennel.

This was a pretty good salad. Skipped the pumpkin seeds and used salted pecans. Quite tasty.

This is a great recipe. I used a little more lemon and used meyers because I had them around. I served it with a spicy, stewy chicken with capers, olives, etc... and a nice crunchy baguette. The cool freshness of the salad was an excellent compliment to the reduced flavors of the chicken. We'll definitely make it again.

Fabulous fresh flavours and crunch - just what we like in a salad. Though it was described as kid-friendly, our little visitors weren't impressed. Maybe just as well though - the adults devoured it all!
