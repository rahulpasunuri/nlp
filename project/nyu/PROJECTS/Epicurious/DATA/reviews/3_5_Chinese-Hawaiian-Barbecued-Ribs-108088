Instead of marinating the ribs, I BBQ'd them on the grill. I took the original recipe but added Red Pepper flakes, pineapple juice and honey, oh what a difference. Reduced it down to a thick glaze. WOW what a BBQ Sauce..

I never make this recipe with ribs but instead with boneless chicken. Simmer it slowly in either the crock pot or the oven and then shred the meat and serve the sauce all around it with rice and mac salad (Hawaiian style). For a little extra zing I sometimes add a small amount of sriracha sauce. This one is always a hit.

This recipe is part of my regular rotation. The only changes I make are to use a pork tenderloin and cook it on the grill. It's good on ribs and chicken too. My kids (2 1/2 & 5) clean their plates. Don't bother to discard garlic and ginger, you don't need to. Sometimes I serve it with chinese fried rice, but my favorite is with mac or potato salad and fresh summer corn on the cob. Yummy!

This was relatively easy to make and I replaced the Sherry with Shaoxing wine to great effect. I also forgot to discard the garlic and ginger and it made little difference during the roasting process.

We first made this recipe while in Hawaii over Xmas 2007. We made it for Xmas eve and it was wonderful. What a memorable recipe

As soon as a corner was cooked enough taste I wiped off the glaze and coated the ribs with my favorite bottled sauce. It was just nasty.

I also made this with Jack Daniel and brown sugar, but added some crushed pineapple and some of the syrup as well. Turned out amazing. The key to keeping ribs moist/fall off the bone tender is not to rush the cooking process - I cooked it for about 5 hrs at around 275 - 300 degrees. Also, for those of you complaining about lack of flavor, try this: Take the marinating/bbq sauce and cook it stove-top and let it reduce and become a thick sauce. Then use a mop or basting brush and thoroughly and generously bast the ribs every so often to get that nice sticky glaze. You can reserve some on the side for dipping as well. Hope y'all enjoy it!

I also used dark brown sugar and Jack Daniel. The ribs were fantastic. I doubled the recipe for four racks of ribs and allowed them to marinate overnight. Everyone couldn't get enough!

After all the great reviews I expected more. I had the butcher cut the ribs done the middle to make riblets. I had really meaty ribs and they were dry and not real flavorful. I marinated for 1 day. A lot of reviewers varied the oven temp, etc. and that may be the trick but these were not "falling of the bone" tender!

did the jack daniels and brown sugar too...still didn't have much taste. very juicy though.

This tasted fine but there just isn't enough meat on baby back ribs to make this worth while again. It was just me dining and I did 2 racks.

Followed previous suggestions and used brown sugar and Jack Daniels. Baked at 300 for 3 hours - the ribs were fall-off-the-bone. The sauce was a nice balance of heat and sweet . . . definitely a keeper.

Everyone I know loves this recipe. Definitely use brown sugar instead of regular sugar and Jack Daniel's instead of sherry. This sauce is especially good on salmon, also. Marinate the salmon, cook it on the grill, and serve topped with grilled pineapple slices, ontop of your choice of greens. Awesome light meal.

Tastes terrible. Made it for my daughter's birthday dinner as she loves ribs. She took one bite and had potatoes for dinner. My husband preferred leftover tuna salad from breakfast. I valiantly ate a few ribs, had to throw out rest.

These ribs are SUPER easy, very tender and surprisingly good for oven roasted. A keeper.

Great flavor. I substituted 1/4 cup apple juice and 1/2 tsp apple cider vinegar for the sherry. I used ground ginger. I wish I made more of the sauce to warm and serve with the ribs for dipping.

These are fantastic and I followed previous suggestions- adding ginger, chili paste, lowering the heat but cooking longer.

I'm originally a good ol southern boy who likes his ribs. I also love asian cuisine, so this recipe is one of the best. I have made these over and over and over again. The only problem is that these ribs are SOOOO good that my wife won't let me make ribs any other way again. The flavor is incredible and different. Spice 'em up with cayenne if you want. I've done on the grill at 225 or in the oven. Normally, I follow the recipe and then just throw them on the grill for a few minutes at the end....they are ribs after all. Couldn't be easier to make. Great for company...just let them cook for a couple of hours while drinking beer/wine/cocktails and everybody salivating.

This recipe was ok, but I prefer saucier, more flavorfull ribbs, and these were really mild. They looked good, but the taste I was looking for was just not there.

What an amazing recipe!! The ribs came out delicious. I will repeat this many times. I used jack daniels instead of sherry as suggested by some reviews. To make it even easier, instead of fresh garlic and ginger, I added 1/2 tsp ginger paste and 1 tsp garlic paste to the marinade.

This recipe was amazing, the ribs were gone in less than 10 minutes. I only wish I had made more than just a 3lb rack! I did leave the Sherry out, had the sauce turned out just fine.

Made this for Labor Day BBQ. Substituted Mirin for sherry, otherwise followed the ingredients to a T. We only marinated for 2 hours then mesquite smoked slowly off heat on the grill for 3-4 hours. Wrapped the uneaten in foil and now they, too are gone. They would have all been gone, but we feasted on veggies and great prawns while waiting. This was fantastic and am eager to try the marinade with brown sugar and Jack Daniels. The ribs looked just like the picture! Served with Epicurious Black-eyed peas and ham salad. Not very Hawaiian, but perfectly light and refreshing with the ribs.

This recipe is deserving of the rave reviews. I made 10 racks of spareribs for a party last night. The catered food sat untouched, but the ribs were devoured! Since I used spareribs (instead of baby backs) and was cooking such a large quantity, I lowered the temp to 300 and cooked for 3 1/2 hours. As suggested, I substituted brown sugar (for white), Jack Daniels (for sherry) and omitted the salt. Also added some Chinese chili paste with garlic, for some kick. Cooked the ribs in the oven, finished them on the grill. Delish!

Wow. So easy and extremely delicious; I made three racks and didn't have any leftovers. I also substituted brown sugar and Jack Daniels and marinated overnight. Then, I baked them at 250 for 3 hours and then threw them on the grill for about 10 minutes. Everyone loved them and I will keep this recipe for sure!

Made this for a party while on vacation and it was a hit--everyone liked it even the kids--made 10 lbs and there was not a one left over. We were at the beach and didn't have the time to bake them in the oven so we grilled them carefully and they were delicious . I'm making them again this weekend for my friends at home!!

Big Hit! Definitely marinate overnight. I baked for 3-1/2 hrs at 300 the night before my dinner party. Before serving, I heated for 1 hr at 300, with foil over the pan. I removed the foil and let them sit in a warm oven (200) until I was ready to slice & serve. They got a thumbs up from the crowd!

I've made ribs from several recipes searching for the best balance of relative ease with taste. This was extremely easy (as ribs go) and absolutely the best ribs we've ever had. I substituted Jack Daniels for Sherry and cooked at 250 for approximately 3 1/2 hours.

Wow! was this great. Forget about making this for an hors d'oeuvre, I made the recipe exactly as written (only I cooked it on the grill)and used it for an entree for two. We ate every bite, licking our fingers and rolling our eyes with delight. I never make ribs at home but this was so easy. I would use this marinade for chicken too. So simple but very delicious!!!

I've made this twice, once on grill, once in oven. Both times added more garlic and less sugar. It was a hit both times and is very good cold the next day. It's easier in oven, but tastier on grill---with smokier flavor. Either way a hit!

Excellent! I slow baked them the day before and warmed them up in the oven prior to serving. They were a big hit.

Fantastic, next time I will omit the salt, the soy sauce makes it salty enough. I baked them at 300 degrees for three hours and then finished them off on the bb for a nice crispy outside. They were outstanding.

I made this for a 4th of July party. I made 6 whole racks and only about 10 people showed up to the party. I figured I'd be taking home about 3 racks, but they were gobbled up. Really great recipe.

These ribs were a hit at my Hawaiian party. The kids devoured them and so did the adults. Although I had numerous appetizers, and made 4 racks of ribs, these were gone in no time along with the crab wontons. My son is asking when I will make some more of them! They are perfect for a party since they can be made ahead of time. I cooked them the day before, then reheated them for about 1/2 hour and cut them into individual ribs. Next time I will try finishing them on the grill for a little more carmelized glaze.

Marinated overnight...and used Jack Daniels b/c I didn't have any sherry. I cooked them on the BBQ and they were yummy. My husband said they were delicious, the only problem with them was that there weren't enough!

This was a very good rib recipe. My husband, who is dutch, loved them. I did make a couple of easy changes to the recipe. First I omitted the salt. I find soy sauce to have enough salt content. I added more garlic cloves. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar. And lastly, I added about 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper. It turned out just lovely. It was very tasty and had an elegant presentation. Judging from my husband's comments at dinner I am sure it will be requested again soon.

Damn these ribs are good! Marinated in a large ziplock for 24 hours and put the garlic through a press rather than just smash the clove up. And the marinade recipe is so basic! The best part is they taste just as good cold as they do warm:0

This is the best all round barbecued rib recipe I've ever made. I made it first for a going away party for a co-worker. Everyone loved it. The second time I made it for my family and they loved it too. I think marinating is the key. It's a recipe suitable for convservative eaters, but tasty enough for the more adventurous.

We increased the cooking time to 2 1/2 hours and it was more tender (can prepare the day ahead and heat through about 3/4 or 1 hours with the same results). Freezes very well.

I have tried many and varied recipes looking for that perfect one. Well this is it. I threw the others away. By far the tastiest, juicest, mouthwatering ribs I have EVER had. My husband says better than any restaurant ribs he's had. I boiled them for two hours first, then did the slow baking method, marinated in the sauce for about an hour then grilled them to perfection for a couple of minutes on the Barbie. YUMMMMM. You won't be dissapointed. Cheers!

OK Epicurions-no need to read any other recipes if you are seeking great oven made ribs. 4 pounds of Baby Backs were consumed by our family of four including two small children who rarely eat anything my wife and I make. Thanks to Queenie for the great suggestion: cook it slow, cook it low. I did not tent ribs nor did I turn them. I did marinate for 24 hours and basted every thirty in the oven. Simply wonderful!

Tasty recipe - its a keeper! Marinating seems to be overkill when most of a baby back rib is bone. Take each rack & slice 3/4 of the way down between each rib. Lightly season both sides of each rack with your favorite seasoned salt, pepper & garlic powder. Place them on a rack in a large rectangular roast pan & bake for 2 hours at 300 degrees, flipping each rack after an hour. Once flipped, tent them with foil. This makes the meat fall off the bone. Smear both sides of each rack with sauce & throw on the BBQ for a few minutes each side. Why call them BBQ ribs if they never see the BBQ? I promise this doesn't take 5 hours & you will still get rave reviews from your guests!

just wondering if it took anyone else's ribs over 4 hours to finally get tender?? beside the fact that we did not eat until almost 9:30 (at which point everybody was starving and would have eaten anything!!) these were pretty good.

Wow - my Texas husband raved about these. And he's a rib conoisseur! The sherry and ginger add a nice touch - the long, slow, oven basting keeps the pork sealed and moist. Yummy.
