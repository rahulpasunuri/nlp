The parfait is fantastic (fluffy and creamy)...not difficult to make and receive rave reviews from everyone at dinner parties - particularly from the guys - a definite winner! The fruit compote is good too, but the parfait outdoes it. I use this recipe for the parfait with the molten chocolate cake recipe (Bon Appetit Jan 2000 I think) and other desserts, or just with fresh berries. A definite keeper.

I hate to be the reviewer who pans a dish, but when I made it, the parfait was UNBERABLY sugary. The berries were great, but the parfait was inedible.

This is delicious. It's easy to make and it can all be done ahead of time. The parfait is very cool and light. It's a lovely dessert for a warm summer when fresh fruit is in season. But it could be made any time of the year.

I love the recipe, but I'm one that has to see what she's making. A picture would help.
