terrible - the cottage cheese and yogurt just don't work with it.

This is just plain YUCK!! Save your time and money, go for another stroganoff recipe, any one, that is sure to taste better.

I was definately not impressed. Yes, the color was *very* off-putting. I added quite a bit of worchestershire sauce, and used fat free sour cream instead of the substitutes. It was better the second day, but still very blah.

Yuck!!! This was disgusting. Did not even remotely resemble stroganoff. It had an ugly gray color and no matter how I spiced it I couldn't save it. I use ground turkey in everything but believe me, I'll never use it in this terrible dish again.

This was okay. It was bland, but good enough for a low fat dish. I might make it again to get rid of the massive amounts of ground turkey I have frozen.

My husband and I try to eat low fat foods and while this one is low in fat, it's also high in flavor and definitely tastes like stroganoff. I left out the mushrooms since I didn't have any but I think that made quite a difference in the outcome. While I still thought it was great, I'll make sure to add them next time. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and I didn't have a separation problem like other reviewers did

I to made a few alterations: Low fat sour cream instead of cottage cheese for a smoother texture, the (cottage cheese causes the sauce to separtate out) I also used a variety of mushrooms, shitake, brown, and white,lots of black pepper, nutmeg, and a dash of cayenne. And finally, I did a garlic and onion flavour base, rather that just onions. I served it with a big salad and over soya pasta and it was fabulous. Next it will probably show us as a lovely, quick and casual dinner for some friends. Trust me when I say DON'T use the cottage cheese, I have tried it in many other "low fat" dishes and it separates out in all of them. Low fat sour cream and yoghurt gives the dish tang and flavour while giving a fabulous consistancy.

My husband and I try to eat healthy most of the time and we thought this was great. We served it over whole wheat pasta with a big salad. I don't think I'll make it for guests- no "wow" factor but we enjoyed it.

I made this twice. The first time I didn't have all the ingredients so I had to improvise. I guess that in the end it wasn't lowfat, but it was very good and I got my children to eat vegetables that they normally wouldn't even look at and beg me to make it again. I substituded lowfat sour cream for the cottage cheese, half and half for the plain lowfat yogurt, omitted the lemon juice, used brown rice instead of pasta, added chopped fresh anise, portabella mushrooms, and at the end threw in a bag of fresh baby spinach! Wow! They loved it, not a drop leftover. Have made it again since then and they can't get enough, this is a keeper!

Although the idea of low-fat stroganoff was appealing, there must be a better way to make it. Even after carefully following suggestions of others, the sauce seemed to disappear.It also lacked flavor. Maybe using sourcream instead of the yoghurt? Maybe I'll just go for the real thing, and save the calories on another dish.

A bland dish, but on a busy night this is a great low-fat meal that can be mindlessly prepared in no time. We will keep in the recipes files, but we will HAVE to add more spices to liven up this recipe. We did have a little bit of the separation in the sauce that other chefs mentioned. However, since we were the only ones eating the dish, who cares? It did not change the flavor, it just stuck to the noodles a bit more. All in all, a decent recipe that serves its purpose: fast and low-fat.

Keep the temperature low and the sauce won't separate. I used nonfat sour cream instead of yogurt, since that's what I had onhand. The dish was good but I'm not a huge fan of stroganoff.

Mine curdled too. But it tastes so light and wonderful, I would make it again but just serve to my husband and myself. It doesn't affect the taste.

I made this last night and my rather picky room-mate immediately identified it as stroganoff. It's much lighter than the traditional version but delicious just the same. Add the meat mixture a little at a time to the sauce in order to lessen the chance of the sauce separating.

My sauce separated as well. Good thing Pizza Hut delivers.

I had the same disastrous result of the sauce separating, even though I was very careful not to let it overheat.

This recipe was a disaster! The sauce separated leaving the turkey sitting in water.
