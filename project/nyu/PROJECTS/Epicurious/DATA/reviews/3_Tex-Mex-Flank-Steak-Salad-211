this was ok, but sort of lackluster with very little taste. if i ever made it again(which i don't plan on doing) i would add some stronger flavors to the marinade.

This was a very good recipe. I agree that it is better served over mixed greens. I also added avocados, black beans, and put a dollop of sour cream on top of each salad.

This recipe is similar to one I do all the time. I would suggest substituting at least half of the broth with balsamic vinegar; the acid helps to tenderize the beef and adds great depth to the dish.

A terrific and lowfat main course. I used roasted red pepper and thought a mixed green salad base was much better. Beautiful presentation.
