I served this salsa with shrimp cocktail at a dinner party and it was delicious. It might go better over warm seafood though.

I've served this with grilled salmon and tuna that I had marinated in Tequila Mockingbird Marinade (recipe available through Epicurious). The salsa is excellent with seafood and is very easy to prepare.

Take out the coconut, add a dash of allspice, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Killer topping for chicken.
