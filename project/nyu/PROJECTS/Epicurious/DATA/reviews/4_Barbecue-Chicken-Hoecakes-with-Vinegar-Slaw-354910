It was amazingly delicious! I didn´t make the recipe quite as it was... instead of fennel bulb, I used cabbage and bell pepper... I left the cabbage some time in boiling water, without letting it become to soft. Instead of coffee in the barbecue, because I like more classy flavors, I used some Worcestershire sauce and a little bit of ketchup... the flavor was amazing!! and I added some more flour and milk to the batter, because, suddenly, I had more guests! it was delicious anyway! It was a great idea for a tasty, different and fun supper!

Where is the recipe for the coffee barbecue sauce and the vinegar slaw? Hard to make this without all the recipes.

Sadly, I do not share the other reviewers' enthusiasm for this recipe. It was by no means a bad dish, but I found the sauce unremarkable and the combination too heavy. We shredded the chicken into small pieces but found it did not take well to this preparation. The slaw was time-consuming to make-- even with a mandolin--but it was good.

Super yummy recipe and not as time consuming as I expected it to be. I used apple wood chips for smoking the chicken and would recommend apple over hickory for a mellower, sweeter flavor. Served with grilled corn and peach pie for dessert. A great summer meal; lots of steps you can do ahead of time that make it easy to serve to company if you don't want to spend the entire evening in the kitchen. Delicious.

This was wonderful and fairly easy with a few short cuts. I was looking for something different to whip up for a summer, family meal and everyone everyone enjoyed this. I grilled the chicken in the oven with bottled BBQ sauce with the addition of the strong coffee (interesting. not too much because it could be bitter). The hoecakes where easy to make and surprisingly yummy. For the slaw I simply used grated cabbage, red onion and --because it's growing so well this summer--fresh basil instead of parsley with the oil, vinegar and sugar per the recipe. I will make this again, possibly for company.

Unlike the previous reviewer from AZ I actually made the whole recipe as written! And it was delicious, especially the barbecue sauce which I did blend in the food processor at the end since I prefer a smoother sauce. Grating the cheese on the hoecakes was a great touch as was serving the slaw on top. I did find, however, that the batter only made 10 not 12 cakes for me.

This dish was excellent. I made it for my dad and husband, and both really liked it. I did cheat on putting it together so that I could have it on a week night after work. I used a rotisserie chicken and my favorite bottled BBQ sauce. I also used julienned broccoli stems for the slaw instead of fennel (only because I didn't have any fennel on hand), which was actually really good with carrots and red onion. The hoecakes were the best part. The whole dish comes together very nicely in taste and presentation.

Excellent recipe. It does take time to prepare, but so well worth it. I didn't do the smoking of the thighs, but just grilled them. The complex flavors of the sauce combined with the vinegar slaw make this a very tasty meal. Next time, the only thing I'll do differently is make the Hoecakes thinner. Fortunately, I have enough chicken, sauce, & slaw left over for another great dinner. Susan in Portland, Or.
