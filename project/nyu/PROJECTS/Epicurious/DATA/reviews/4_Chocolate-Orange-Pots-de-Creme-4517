Rave reviews by guests. One exclaimed that this was the best dessert she had ever tasted! You can't go wrong with orange and chocolate together. I drizzled the chocolate on top of the pots de creme (I ended up not using all of the sauce, but it made for a nicer presentation), and made the candied orange peel(from the Feb 05 chocolate pots de creme recipe)as the garnish, with some whipped cream.

We thought that there was a little too much chocolate (this coming from a chocolate loving family) and are going to prepare it with about half the chocolate next time and about 30% more orange. It was still amazingly delicious though!

I made this dish for Valentine's day and thought the flavor was incredible. I was a little annoyed with the texture, though. When I make this again, I would use a chocolate mousse, rather than the hard ganache called for. (I like my custard to be very creamy.)

Wow! What an impressive dish, and embarrasingly easy to make. It's as good as desserts I've had in four-star restaurants. You'll be asked how on earth you got a strip of chocolate on the top and bottom without it getting mixed in to the custard in the middle. Definitely don't skimp on the chocolate or on the vanilla beans; you get what you pay for. Also, in case you're inclined to second-guess yourself on when the custard is "set" (I was, since I'm intimidated by any desserts with French names and was convinced I'd screw this one up), here's a good test: Tap the surface of the custard 3 times with your finger. If it goes "boing boing boing," it's done. If you end up getting creamy stuff on your finger, bake them another 5 minutes or so. But don't try to bake the custard solid past that thin surface skin--the middle is supposed to stay creamy and soft. It's a "pot of cream," not a flan. All you really want is a surface skin that is capable of holding up the tablespoon of chocolate you spoon on top. I recommend thinly sliced, curled orange peel as a garnish for the top. The one down side of this dessert is that it's not terribly showy; the chocolate on top hardens into a solid block. But boy, one bit of this stuff and no one's going to care what it looks like.

Made this for a New Year's Eve dinner party. It was a huge success. I agree with others, reduce the size of the servings and just drizzle a little chocolate over the top. Decadent!!

I made this a few days ago and offer the following advice: The suggested serving size is too big! No one can finish it. I use 2 oz cups. These will appear small to your guests until they finish it. I highly recommend this size. No matter what size you use, these are truly wonderful.

Very rich and very delicious!! Had a lot of chocolate Sause left over so we will be having chocolate sauce on a lot of things this week. The flavour is fabulous and very intense and 1 TBSP of chocolate on top is more than enough. I put 2 TBSPS thinking it looked a little spare and it is too much for me. Next time will probably just drizzle some across the top in a decorative manner.

Fabulous! Very easy to prepare. Couldn't find vanilla beans, so I substituted vanilla extract, and it turned out fine. Everyone loved it!!! Made it a day ahead, and I don't think it compromised the flavors at all.

This dessert was very delicious but also very rich. I would probably make it for 10, rather than 8 people. My husband and I shared one, and we couldn't finish it! Really easy to make and great when having company 'cause it can be made the day before.

I found the flavors too intense for my taste. I used the valrhona chocolate and it was very strong. It was a LOT of chocolate flavor and a LOT of orange flavor which I can see appeals to many people but didn't work for me.

Wow! What a great recipe. Everyone raved about this dessert. I had one woman that I barely knew come over to me and give me a hug and said that it was the best thing she had ever tasted.

Yummie. My comments are exactly the same as the cook from Silver Spring except we didn't have the port wine. A definate do again recipe. I wonder how often I can make this and not have clogged arteries. Any heart specialists out there?

This was an incredible dessert. I halved the recipe and used Ghirrardehli chocolate as the base for the ganache. The procedures are actually quite simple with a double boiler, and the dessert flies along once you get everything assembled, and I used Grand Marnier as the liqueur for the custard. Decadent, delicious, and impressive. . . and, as another cook noted, yummy with a glass of port. Definitely one I will make again for holiday meals. And this was my very first shot at a creme brulee/custard dessert, too.

This was an instant favorite!! My guests loved it, because although the chocolate made it rich it wasn't overpowering because the orange balanced it out. I have made many, many Creme Brulee, Pots de Creme recipes and this one created the biggest reaction by far. EVERYONE loved it!!

This dessert is very rich.. it goes great with a glass of port! I would advise not to mix the egg-sugar mixture too much.. you will get air bubbles in the custard. I like the custard velvety smooth...

This dessert is time consuming but incredibly good. Follow directions carefully; the secret to this recipe is technique.
