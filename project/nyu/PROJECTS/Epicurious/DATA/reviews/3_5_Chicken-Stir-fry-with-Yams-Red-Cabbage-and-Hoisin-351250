This was pretty easy to make and was tasty. It is also very healthy. Not that interesting, though, even though I added chili flakes. I'd probably increase the chicken next time and add something more acidic.

Delicious! Great flavors. I'm guessing that most people will also use sweet potatoes in place of the "yams" I removed the yams/sweet potato and onion from the pan after they were nearly cooked. Then I cooked the chicken in the same pan. I put the yam/sweet potato and onions back in the pan just to reheat at the point after stirring in the hoisin sauce.

Most people either love or hate the dark mysterious flavor of hoisin sauce, so I'm thinking that those who rated this only one or two forks don't like the sauce. If you know hoisin and love it, you can't fail to like this dish. I'm a lover, so I added extra sauce at the end and it was DELIGHTFUL! The sesame oil heightens the Asian flavor. I'll be making this again very soon. The presentation was beautifully colorful.

We really enjoyed this stir-fry, and would definitely make again. Next time I would double amount of chicken, and stir-fry the chicken separately before adding to wok as it was hard to make sure the chicken adequately cooked among all the other ingredients.

I thought this dish was horrible! It smelled great, but after adding the hoisin, it was ruined. All you could tast was the hoisin, the ginger was lost. We tasted it and then threw the whole dish out.

Very Good. The sesame oil and ginger are key. I added a few pinches of red pepper flakes and used an extra clove of garlic. Relatively quick to make as well. Finished with a couple dashes of soy sauce.

Loved this! I didn't have chicken on hand so I made it with extra firm tofu instead. I tossed the tofu with the ginger and garlic and a little soy sauce and let it stand while I chopped the vegetables. I also added just a few red pepper flakes to the dish (maybe a 1/4 tsp.). Then, no additional salt/pepper needed at the end. Colorful and tasty.

i forgot to mention that i also used firm tofu instead of the chicken.

I made this recipe without the chicken or cilantro and it was still quite good. I also suggest adding a tablespoon of red wine vinegar with the hoisin sauce to give it a little kick. This is an inexpensive and easy weeknight dinner recipe.

This was only okay. It packed a nutritional punch but just tasted kind of weird, like the flavors weren't meant to be together.

OK if not spectacular. I was glad I added the extra hoisin sauce as others suggested. Nice, relatively eash, lowfat / high fiber meal though I agree extra chicken would be a good idea. I wound up doubling the recipe and using my big wok. As it was, there was barely room in the wok for all the ingredients. I cooked it longer after adding the chicken, as I knew it would be hard to make sure the chicken was cooked after adding the cabbage. Also wound up setting the lid on the wok and letting the full mixture steam for 2 minutes to finish cooking the cabbage. I doubt that would have been necessary with a single recipe but it was helpful with the doubled recipe. Husband and kids loved it. Me, not so much - it was perfectly edible. So for me I'd give it 2 forks, for the family I'd give it 4. Not sure I'll bother making it again.

This was a good stir fry and a nice change from my usual. I made a few changes: used canola oil instead of sesame for the stir fry, adding sesame oil at the end for taste. Used "broccoli slaw" from Trader Joes because it is heartier and tastier than cabbage. Finally, I added a healthy squirt or two of siracha (hot) sauce for spice. Overall, a nice and easy weekday meal.

This is a delicious surprise - at first the combination of ingredients didn't appeal to me, but I had both yams and cabbage to use up so trusted the other reviews. We totally enjoyed this recipe. The only addition I made was a sprinkle of sesame seeds at serving time.

My daughter loved this recipe. I cooked everything as directed but added more hoisin sauce & broccoli. I waited till we were ready to eat to put the cabbage in so it wouldn't get overcooked.

This recipe was just 'ok' for me. I made it tonight and had all the ingredients. I found the consistency of the sweet potato a bit too soft. That said, it was certainly a break from the norm - though I'll wait a while before I make it again.

This was a great recipe - very simple. I followed amounts and instructions, except that I substituted package cole slaw veg for the cabbage. Worked great and saved time! Perfect for lunch the next day as well.

I loved this ... easy to prepare and very tasty. I added more hoisin sauce than suggested and the potatoes, although did not require water, took a little longer. Trick is to have everything all ready chopped before starting. Perfect one dish meal with a small salad.

Really tasty and different. Followed the recipe exactly, except that I used regular green cabbage rather than red. The yams were really nice in it, though I added about 1/2 cup of water 1-2 tbsps at a time while sauteeing them. Highly recommended.

I completely wonked this recipe up because I thought I had most of the ingredients and didn't. I had to substitute plum sauce for hoisin sauce, yellow onion for red, and parsely for cilantro. That being said, it was delish and I had no problems with it being dry or with the sesame oil burning. I highly recommend it and say don't worry about swapping out ingredients!

Oh my Gosh!! I think cilantro tastes like soap too! I always substitute Italian parsley.

Managed to keep the sesame oil from burning, got the yams tender and had all the great taste. The only complaint was not enough sauce, and I could have avoided that if I had read the other reviews first. Other than that it would have been 4 forks. As far as the ginger and garlic, they never get measured here, just added in large quantities!

I made this as written, and it was quite tasty and enjoyed by all. Not my favorite recipe, but good for something different. It should definitely be cooked in a large wok if possible - trying to stir fry such a large amount of bulky items in my fry pan was comical and frustrating. No problems with the sesame oil burning - just keep adding water a little at a time as previously suggested.

This turned out great tonight. I followed the recipe as specified, sans cilantro, because we think it tastes like soap. I used my largest frying pan (and it's a big one) -- however, I think that this recipe would be more appropriate for a large wok. The vegetables were overflowing. Be sure to cut the veggies down to size. I like egg noodle sized cabbage. The sesame oil was exactly what was needed. I disagree with the other reviewers that peanut or vegetable oil would have been better. I did not have any smoking, because the temperature was just right. Enjoy!

This was suprisingly good! Not only was it tasty, but colorful as well. I pretty much followed the recipe as written with a few changes. As others have suggested, add an additional tablespoon of Hoisin sauce and make sure to keep adding water, a little bit at a time, to the vegetables as you're stir-frying them. The sesame oil will burn very quickly if you don't. Also, I only used one large yam and it was plenty. Unless you have a very large pan, brown the chicken in a second pan. There won't be enough room for everything to be in the same pan to be cooked thoroughly. Lastly, for an extra kick, I added about a teaspoon of Mongolian Fire Oil. The recipe, as it's written, lacks spice. All in all, it was a great recipe; it's already been added to our "usual" list!

I have reviewed this already but I think it';s important to note that you really need to add some water during the stir frying so the wondeful sesame oil doesn't burn and the yams and cabbage get soft enough. I think it's crucial to the outcome, which i loved.

We made this recipe as written and it was delicious. The textures were great and it tasted just as good on day 2.

I think the recipe is misleading. Sesame oil is not suitable for cooking - it smokes too easily. Use peanut oil, sunflower oil, or even vegetable oil instead. Flavor the chicken or veggies with sesame oil, but do not cook with it. That worked out much better for me.

Very tasty! I used a little sesame oil, about a tsp, and the rest peanut oil. The saute of the sweet potatoes was very dry, and I added a little rice vinegar, then water and chicken broth a number of times. The rest of it was a snap.

Very good! I read the other reviews and added lost of extra ginger and hoisin sauce and the dish was very flavorful. Everyone liked it and it was full of veggies so I'll make it again.

In short...pass on this one. Actually threw most of it away...and I don't throw ANYTHING away!!

I was really excited about trying this recipe. For the first time my husband and I were very disappointed with a Bon Appetit recipe. There was nothing about it we liked. The potatoes and cabbage took longer to cook and we should have used peanut oil instead of sesame oil to cook with. If we do try it again we would definitely cut the vegetables a little smaller.

This was AMAZING! My whole family loved it, 8 year olds, teens, wow! I followed it exactly, adding a little water during the stirfry process with the yams and later on with the chicken and it was perfect. I used a cover every few minutes or so to help with the cooking as I am at a high altitude. I also served with jasmine rice and some snow peas on the side. I will absolutely make this again and again.

Well, I followed this recipe exactly and I was disappointed. It smelled like it should taste exquisite, but while the flavor was good, it wasn't anything to write home about. Next time I'd probably add more ginger, garlic, hoisin, and some red pepper or chili oil..

this was really good, i'll definitely make it again. super super easy. we ate it over brown rice. i think the sweet potatoes needed to cook a bit longer than the recipe says before the addition of chicken and then cabbage. i probably added more cilantro and a bit more ginger and garlic than the recipe said, but didn't have to add anything outlandish. it would perhaps have benefited from a bit more sauce (it's a bit dry, though the flavors are all there and good). we heated it up for leftovers the next day and i made a pan sauce with the key ingredients (sesame oil, ginger and garlic, and water) to drizzle over the rice we ate it on. better the second day.

Very good. A bit more than 40 minutes for me, though.

I was looking for something simple for dinner tonight and came across this new recipe. I had almost everything so a quick trip to the store was all it took. Easy, one skillet, lots of colour, healthy - a great "What do you want for dinner?" kind of meal! Just a few changes - cut the cabbage a bit thinner so it softens in time, a few more dollops of Hoisin and I also added a tsp. or so of red chilie sauce for some extra heat. Not gourmet but very good!
