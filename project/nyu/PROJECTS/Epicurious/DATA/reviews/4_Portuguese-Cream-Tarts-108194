I was so disappointed with the results. These tarts are a fair bit of work and they tasted NOTHING like any cream tart I've had either here or in Portugal. Mind you, they taste nice, but if you're expecting the traditional tart, this isn't even close. Like an earlier reviewer said, the lemon should be scaled WAYYYyyy back. I will try this again but will experiment with the flavouring.

Pleasant but underwhelming. Proportions off? I made the recipe as written, had the correct size of muffin cups, and still ended up with twice as much custard as I needed. Didn't know what else to do w/custard or how long it would keep, so ended up making a filo dough version as well as a puff pastry version. Overall, I thought that using the triple-layer puff pastry dough as described made for a rather thick and gummy pastry. Maybe would be better using single layer (in a bigger piece, not twisted into swirl and flattened)? Also, pastry did not keep well. Made and ate what we could the same day, but the next day was unpleasantly gluey and inedible. I was sorry to have to throw it out. The custard was easy to make and nice enough, but nothing spectacular.

Please ignore my other review! It turns out I'm an idiot and was using filo, instead of puff pastry dough. The good news is it still came out great. I may try using puff pastry dough some day, just so I can experience the recipe as written.

I made this last night and the crust just simply did not work. When I tried to flatten the rolls of dough I got a hideous squashed mess. Instead, I laid out 3 sheets of the dough, cut it into squares approximately 2.5 inches on each side, and layered a couple of squares in each dish, to make sure that the custard was contained. I'm sure my guests won't mind (unfortunately this is for a pot luck so they won't be fresh out of the oven!).

Simple but lovely. We made these tarts as written (although rolled and sliced our puff pastry, pressing flattened pinwheels into the muffin tins - short nails required!) and the two of us polished off the whole dozen in one day. Next time I will dial down the lemon zest and dial up the vanilla to better replicate our local source of these tarts in Vancouver, the T&T Market! Theirs are nice and brown on top; I had to use the broiler for a few minutes to achieve the same finish. This recipe definitely goes into the "make again" file.

to the Canadian cooks...the puff pastry comes in two formats here in Canada. It is either in two portions that you thaw and roll out, or two sheets that are rolled, which you can unroll and use as is, roll out to enlarge, or even join together, if not large enough.

I can't find the recommended 1/3 cup capacity mini muffin pans the recipe called for. The site the recipe recommended is walk-in only & is inaccessible for info. Would anyone happen to know where to get mini-muffin pans with the prescribed 1/3 cup capacity ? Have searched various websites but they give only the dimensions (width, length, depth) -not the capacity of the cups.

I found the recipe a bit confusing. My puff pastry came rolled, not folded in thirds. But it all worked out and the custard was delicious.

Yum! I made my special "Strawberry Chocolate Oasis pie" using the custard from this recipe baked into a pie shell washed with semi-sweet chocolate and topped with fresh strawberries. Got the thumbs up from my tasters.

This recipe is wonderful and simple! Everyone devours them whenever we make them. We usually make them with little bite size tart shells, and they work just as well and make a pretty little dessert for a tri-server with other desserts. This is one of our favorites now.

To the cook from Toronto: Puff pastry comes in two sheets that are folded into thirds, so once it thaws a bit, you are able to unfold it. Once you buy it, and read the recipe instructions, you will better understand.........Good luck!

I haven't made this yet...but I'm confused. what do they mean 'unfold sheets' I thought you just roll out the square block of puff pastry??

I have had success making lower-fat custards by just substituting 2% milk and using whole eggs (instead of just the yolks). I've also used buttermilk in the past with great success.

The fifteenth time I made this recipe we were trying to eat healthier. I used skim milk instead of cream and added some cornstarch. It still tastes really good and has most of the flavor - just not quite as creamy and thick, but still very good. I'm serving it over the poppy seed/lemon angel food cake.

I use this custard all the time for various desserts - Always devoured!

These tarts are simply decadent. How can we lower the fat content and still make a great custard filling?

These tarts are wonderful!! My boss is Portugese and when I brought them to work he knew what they were right away and said they were delicious and just like he remembered. Make sure to sprinkle plenty of cinnamon on top.

These Portuguese Cream Tarts are wonderful and very similar to the traditional ones made in Lisbon at Pastelaria de Belem. I served them for dessert as part of a Portuguese meal I cooked for my friends and they were a great success.
