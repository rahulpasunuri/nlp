This is an excellent recipe! The sweet, salty, and spicy are perfectly balanced and there is so much that can be done with this lovely picadillo. My family absolutely loves it and I make this about once a week. I have had great success making this with ground beef and ground turkey.

I won't rate this either since I didn't make it, but as another Latino here I have to agree with other posters. 1. I add in some chopped red/green pepper along with the onion, 2. Drain off some of the excess fat after browning the beef, 3. I prefer dried currants instead of raisins and also use 1 T chopped capers, 4. Go easy on the tomato paste (I use 1/4 cup of tomato sauce instead paste ), 5. Lastly. . . if it's Cuban we're after, then use 1 tsp. of cumin instead of chili powder or cayenne (which are more Mexican). Although this particular recipe doesn't sound purist Cuban to me, I bet it's still pretty tasty and gives you one take on picadillo. But most of all, enjoy Latin flavors whenever you can!

I agree with several reviewers -- this isn't very traditional. My 2nd mother-in-law made this often. I added cumin, oregano, capers canned diced tomatoes and used zante currants instead of raisins -- They're not as sweet. I did add a little tomato paste a little at a time until I got the slightest hint of tomato.

great recipe, similar to how my grandmother made it,,, i took out the bay leaves and put in some mango chunks for a special flavor.. .made it even more tropical

Based on other comments, past servings of picadillo and my fanatical LOVE of capers, I added 1T capers, 1/2 C dry sherry, 2t cumin and 1/2C green peppers, and I omitted the tomato paste, vinegar, chili powder and cayenne pepper. My guests were literally fighting over the leftovers. I also found that frozen plantains are MUCH easier than fresh, and I was able to get the ripe consistency in the frozen plantains that are hit-or-miss if you buy fresh.

This was okay, but I'm not sure how authentic it is. I've had Picadillo in a few different cuban resturants and it wasn't this tomato-ey and not as sweet. I wouldn't make again.

My husband grew up in Tampa, FL, and his family had piccadillo all the time. Being a New Englander without much experience cooking Cuban food, I was nervous about trying to recreate one of his childhood favorites! This was fantastic, though. I omitted the raisins, used ground bison, and served it over brown rice (not authentic, but much healthier!). My husband loved it. Our picky 4-yr-old loved it. I loved it, too! My mother-in-law uses lots of Goya red cooking wine in her version, but I wanted to avoid that... I was happy to find a recipe that just called for a little red wine vinegar instead! Maybe this isn't totally authentic Cuban, but it's delicious nonetheless!

I'm not rating it, as I haven't made it, I have a fabulous picadillo recipe I've been making for years. I was just browsing some Cuban recipes, and no Cuban recipe is going to include Chili powder. I would suggest adding the cumin, also diced green peppers and instead of tomato paste, try ketchup. I know, I know, ketchup? But it gives the tomato taste, with a bit of spice and some sweetness too. I'm originally from Florida, I do know Cuban food.

I agree with "votresante" that the addition of red wine vinegar is overkill. You get plenty of that flavor element from the olives and capers, if you use them. The first time I made this recipe, I added the red wine vinegar and it was too much. I have since omitted the vinegar and like the result much better. I also add 2 teaspoons of cumin and 1/2 cup dry sherry or dry red wine and leave out the chili powder and cayenne. As mentioned previously, these are not traditional Cuban ingredients.

Absolutley needs some cumin to be authentic. For a special treat-try making a "canoe". Take whole very ripe plantains-fry in a little olive oil until browned-split down the center & place in a shallow baking dish-fill your "canoes" w/cooked picadillo & top w/ shredded mozzarella place under broiler until cheese is how you like it. Serve on a bed of yellow rice & you will agree that this is THE BOMB!!!

My aunt introduced me to this culinary delight when we were in Florida last month. It was so good that it reminded her of her childhood in Miami. It was so good I had to look for a recipe online. It was very good but I probably could have added more chili powder. Paired it with cheese empanadas.

Made this for my Cuban boss, on "Boss day" last month. He had told me his mom used to add diced potatos. He also said it was better without a lot of tomato paste. So I added a diced medium size potato, used only 1 tbl of tomato paste and one can of diced tomatoes. He said it tasted just like he remembered. Efi Nichols

This recipe is fabulous and as traditional as you can get with Cuban food. The only thing I did was add 2 tsp. of cumin and 2 tsp of capers to make it more like the Cubans do in Tampa, FL. Great, great, great! Served it with traditional black beans and yellow rice, yucca cooked in onion, garlic, butter, and lemon, and plantains. Yummy! Thanks for sharing!!!

Wasn't sure what we were going to have for dinner tonight. And I came across this recipe. I went over to publix and picked up the ingredients. The only thing that i didn't have was red wine vinegar. So I used balsamic vinegar instead. Either way the food was delicious. Great recipe and easy to prepare. I recommend this to everyone.

Delicious! I made it exactly as written, but cut in half since I only had a pound of meat and it fed 4 of us with yellow rice and black beans on the side. An easy, super quick (20 minutes including rice from scratch and cuban style beans from a can) dinner for the family.

I have been making this exact same recipe for the past year and my wife and kids LOVE it! Getting them to all like the same thing is very hard. Thanks!!

Loved this recipe. It goes great with tortillas or on top of white rice. I didn't need to use all that red wine vinegar just enough to give it a good taste (use your discretion) nor did I use the raisins. I added black olives instead of green.

I love this recipe! I skip the raisins (hate raisins), add black olives in addition to the green (love olives), and also add toasted pine nuts at the end. GREAT over rice on a cold day.

Hi. Because I did not make this specific recipe, I can't give it any forks, and probably people will say I shouldn't comment at all. I looked for this as a more authentic version of a different recipe from elsewhere, which probably I should not call "picadillo" at all. But that other recipe called for cooking in two cups of beef broth/stock and two cups of small shells. About 8 minutes before taking off the heat, I added peas. Again this other version may be totally fake, but I liked it and others have asked me for the recipe.

I have tried many picadillo recipes, this is what I consider authentic. My only modification was to drain the meat/garlic/ onion mixture before the adition of the remaining ingredients and add 1 tbs. capers to the dish. Bon Appetit!

Tasty and easy. Make sure to drain the grease a bit before serving.

This was excellent. I used chipotle chile powder and also added a bit of cumin. Just the right amount of burn. I also drained off all the fat after browning the meat. I used a can of tomato puree instead of the diced tomatoes.

I have not made this particular recipe as I have my own recipe for picadillo. However, I did want to say that I agree with the psoter below about the chili pepper. Food in the Spanish speaking Caribbean is not hot, so I would also omit the chili pepper and sub in some cumin. Also, I would suggest using this filling to make empanadas. You can buy the frozen discs of dough, fill it up with the meat, and fry them up. They disppear quickly when I bring them to parties.

This is a good base recipe - I always modify it. I generally add more spice, toasted pine nuts, and drop the raisins. It's the kind of dish where you can get creative with what you have on hand.

I agree that this is an easy, tasty, satisfying weekday recipe. Everyone in my family likes it especially my son who is a very picky eater. We usually have it with rice and a veggie.

I agree with the other poster - everyone's recipes will be slighly different but never has my Cuban family made traditional Cuban cuisine with chili or pepper. My mother did also add 1/4 teaspoon cumin to this recipe.

I don't know why recipes that are called "cuban" have as ingredients chili or cayenne pepper. Cuban food is not mexican food. It's not hot, it is spicy. Picadillo cubano without cumin or vino seco needs another name. I did not cook this so I will not rate it. But I do suggest changing the chili and cayenne to 1/2 teaspoon of cumin. If you can't find vino seco use some pale dry sherry.

What a delightful change to a traditional chili! This recipe is different enough that my husband wouldn't call it "chili" but ate it up like it was. Must have been the spanish olives that gave it the new twist. The kids loved it too.

This is a great weeknight recipe. I substituted veggie crumbles for the ground beef as we are vegetarian, and served over brown rice. I will definitely serve it w/ tostadas per the other suggestions. I did find that it needed a bit more "kick" so added a couple of dashes of hot sauce for more spice and vinegar tang (I thought the 1.5 tsp of red wine vinegar was paltry). I may try that wine cooking tip next time, too.

I've been searching for the perfect picadillo recipe. I never expected the recipe to come from Mr. Gorelick of Livingston HS! Kathy Riker

YUM, I use cumin also instead of chili powder. sliced almonds can be added for a little texture. And if served with tostones it is really quite a good combo.

I always add some vegetables to this dish, like carrots, potatoes, bell pepper, green beans and even a tart apple tastes delicious. I finish it off with sliced almonds roasted in olive oil, which I learned from 'Havana Moon Chili' also on this site. (I slightly prefer that recipe)

Fast and tasty. I don't know if I'd serve it to company, but it made for a good quick meal after work. The red wine suggestion seemed to add a lot of flavor. I also used cumin instead of chili powder.

I can't give forks because I haven't tried the recipe yet but in response to the one cook whose tried this, I'm Cuban and I haven't met a picdillo (or too many other Cuban dishes for that matter) that was not made with vino seco. You can sub red wine if you can't find vino seco in your grocery store. Use about 1/2 cup and simmer roughly 20 mins with the other ingredients until the alcohol is cooked off. I bet that would improve this dish greatly. I'm planning on trying that tonight and will report.

This was good, but definitely not great. I expected it to be more flavorful- I used more than the amount of garlic specified and added a bit more spice, but still found this uninspiring. It was decent, but there are many better recipes on this site. I wouldn't make it again.
