This is SO tasty! I am happy to find a corn "fritter" that isn't drowned in batter. As to anyone who felt it needed something - try this: double the recipe to serve as a main course, serve with bacon and syrup as written, then add sliced avocado, some arugula and tomato chutney. It will become a favorite! Every time I serve this, plates are cleaned. And fresh corn is a must from the cob (I've tried cheating and it's just not as good).

This is the easiest recipe and can be put together in just a few minutes....exactly what I was looking for as a side dish. We had them "as is" and we loved them. I would double the recipe next time because I too only ended up with 7 fritters

This recipe was decent but left an odd chalky aftertaste in my mouth, like when you eat raw, mature spinach. Perhaps I need to decrease the amount of baking powder? Also, I cut down the sugar by half (the corn was already sweet), the bacon by 1/3 and added NO salt since I added the crumbled bacon to the fritter batter and it was salty enough.

Not strange at all NY. I grew up in the south and that's how my family always served our fritters. Maybe it's a Southern thing. These fritters aren't as good as my Moms were but still good.

I don't understand the rave reviews for this recipe!! I love corn but this recipe was very boring - it felt like it needed a little something. And eating it with syrup??? urgh!!! Strange, strange, strange!!!

Too sweet. Will cut sugar in half next time. Added bacon as suggested by NY cook and will maybe added grated onion.

I only wish I would have doubled the recipe. It only made seven smallish sized pancakes. The taste was wonderful and I think we'll try it for breakfast next time. Fresh corn is a must. These fritters have a wonderful sweet smooth taste.

The only thing I did differently was to add the crumbled bacon to the recipe before cooking. Delicious !

Great with the tomatoes, a bit too sweet with syrup. Used sweet Italian sausage instead of bacon, worked well.

These fritters are great, better than any other recipe i've tried. I don't use the bacon and they're fab, especially with a fresh tomato salsa.

Absolutely delicious and easy to make, even for a lazy cook like myself. I tried making them once without the bacon fat, but they weren't nearly as tasty. The bacon is key!

Pretty tasty--though I prefer them with a little butter and some homemade jalapeno jelly.
