This was very easy to prepare and tasted great, even the next day (although the color was off as someone else mentioned). I'd say it makes much more than ten servings (three pounds of beans is a lot), so I cut the recipe into quarters and ended up using a bit more prosciutto than called for. Served it with grill-roasted chicken and it was very tasty. I'd definitely make it again.

Fantastic!! As another reviewer suggested, I blanched for 7 min prior to putting in ice water and the beans were the perfect tender-crisp. I made 1/3 the recipe and it was good for a starter salad for 3. I substituted fresh basil for rosemary and it was still fab.

Extremely delicious and hearty enough for a light lunch. I would make this again and again. It really does get better the longer it marinates, although the second day the green beans are more of an olive color instead of the beautiful bright green on the day its made.

This was such an easy, delicious side, I served it with the tomato basil salad from this site and the chicken al mattone from the 9/09 issue of Bon Appétit. Great summer meal... The leftovers were even better at lunch today.

I made this for a family picnic and everyone loved it. The prosciutto is important to round out the flavor (it also soaks up some of the dressing, which is nice). I recommend this recipe and probably wouldn't change anything.

I feel obligated to post this review. I'm a good cook, and I wanted to serve this at a dinner party (last night) that included Moroccan Chicken with Eggplant, Lamb with Figs, Couscous with Apricots and Almonds, and a salad of Pear/goat/cheese and dried cherries. I thought it looked good and the texture was nice but it was really limp tasting, just bland. Maybe you need to be very careful to dry the beans overnight in the refrigerator after blanching and shocking them. I found the lemon dressing was really insufficient--compared to my usual vinaigrette for green beans--even though I ended up using garlic and preserved lemon peel in it to give it some kick. I guess what I'm saying is that you should be prepared to do a lot of doctoring of this to get it to have a robust, interesting, flavor. aimai

For lack of time did not chill before serving. Texture & flavor were still good. Healthy, tasty, pretty. More dressing than I personally need but not a problem.

Tasty even without the prosciutto. Pairs nicely with Red Snapper, Veracruz Style, elsewhere on this site.

I love a cold fresh, crunchy salad with just a little substance - particularly in the heat of summer here! I added a scattering of marinated black olives and shaved preserved lemon on top for presentation, but it doesn't need anything. First, an appetiser of fresh shucked Sydney rock oysters and a bloody mary, then I served this salad for lunch as a side to flathead fish fillets (quick hot non-stick panfry, black pepper, sprig of thyme, squeeze of lemon), and a chilled sauvignon blank. A great side dish, but I'll definitely be making this salad on it's own (well, maybe with a bloody mary) for lunch or dinner when it's just me. Friends wouldn't go home!

Made this last night for a dinner party and everyone loved it. Not to mention it looks beautiful & colorful on a plate. Will keep it on my list of great and easy side dishes that please a crowd. Crisp and fresh beans are terrific with the salt of the proscuito and tang of the lemon and onion. You could do so many things with this - switch up with other fresh herbs, flavored oils, pine nuts etc. I will use this as a starting point next time but don't hesitate to make exactly as directed. I did blanch the green beans for about 6 minutes in almost boiling water. I might blanch even longer next time. Fabulous!
