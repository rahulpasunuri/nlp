This recipe really takes some time, although its my fault for having to crack the walnuts from our own trees first. The almonds do take a long time to chop as well. However, this turned into a WOW dessert and I will certainly make it again for a dinner party coming up. I served it with a small dollop of my homemade Greek yogurt. It was a nice contrast to the sweet and syrupy dessert.

Too much citrus, not our favorite

This was fantastic! After spending a few hours making the stuff i swore I would never make it again. But after trying it, I decided I must make it again. It was that good. The sugar and honey syrup with the whole lemon and orange and the cinnamon sticks is a work of art all by itself. And I am generally not even that big on sweets. Go figure. This is a must do at least a few times a year. I have a question: instead of unevenly drizzling 2 Tbs of butter on each nut layer why not mix the 8 Tbs of melted butter in with the nut mixture before putting it in the 4 separate layers? Would this harm the receipe? My hunch is that it would not, especially if the ingredients are assemblee immediately.

Oh my goodness...I had baklava for the first time in Santorini Greece last year and have craved it rver since. This amazing recipe took me back. Followed it to a T and when it had cooled I melted some semisweet chocolate and drizzled it on top. Everyone was blown away. Decadent and now demanded by all my rrelatives.

Amazing. first time making it, was very time consuming but well worth it. I think i over boiled the syrup, so it went a bit hard when it cooled, but still delicious. I used a combination of pistachios, almonds, and walnuts. Beautiful

This was the first time I had ever made baklava, though I've made other Middle Eastern pastries and certainly eaten plenty. I thought this was lovely, though more complicated than I'd imagined. I'm surprised though that no one mentioned the enormous amount of syrup. We were making it for a school project so we didn't want it to be too gooey so we stopped after pouring on probably a third of the syrup, about 3/4 of a cup. The test piece we ate was delicious and seemed as "soaked" as the baklava I've eaten elsewhere, but was still pleasantly crisp and not overwhelmingly sweet. The scent of this baking was one of the most delicious smells I've had wafting through my kitchen in a long time.

I used this recipe to create an "apple baklava" due to my extensive amount of apples. I followed the recipe (and did use my food processer to chop the nuts) but for the syrup, i only used 1C sugar and then used 1/4C fresh apple juice. In the filling, i used 10oz of Almonds and 10oz of walnuts. I then chopped up 2 apples in my food processor, drained the juice out to get them as try as i could, and added it to the filling. The end result was a little less citrusy, with a subtle hint of apple. Very delicious and very fall:)

Absolutely delicious, used the food processor on the nuts, I recommend short burst chopping. The main thing that I altered was that I added 1/2 tsp freshly ground cardamom, it was a great addition. Everyone loved the baklava, although I felt it could use a little more syrup.

Needs more salt to bring out the flavors. It actually felt off to me to add only 1/4 tsp, but I religiously followed the recipe for the first time. Other review recommended grinding your own spices to make the spices pop a little more. I ground my own clove and nutmeg and it still could have been stronger and more complex. It was too cinnamon-y. Next time I'll use less cinnamon and more nutmeg and clove. Other reviews also recommended going ahead with the food processor. This recipe will never happen again without one in this household. Hand chopping nuts is very time consuming. I think I'll keep this as my based recipe and experiment from here. Next time no almonds. I'll try walnut/pistacio or pine nut.

Very, very tasty... I'm a bit of a purist, so although the citrus taste was nice, I wish it weren't as strong. That said, everyone else raved about it, and I had several immediate requests for the recipe. I found the instructions to be a bit confusing, and my phyllo dough did not come in the same size or quantity so I amended the instructions slightly; the one pound box had two packages of 20 sheets each. Each sheet was just larger than the 8x13 baking dish, so I simply used one sheet at a time, buttering between each sheet, and made each phyllo layer out of 8 sheets with 1/4 of the nut filling in between each. It turned out exquisitely beautiful, and it was indeed very delicious. The only other alteration I made was to put a little bit of salt in with the butter.

This is the first time I made baklava and it was delicious. My friends raved and raved about it.

Even though it was very tedious chopping the nuts, I eventually gave in and used the food processor, I thought it was a great recipe! This baklava had much more flavor than any others that I have had. It was worth the time spent making it.

Delicious! Turned out exactly as I had hoped (if not a little hard to cut)...I would definitely make this again. Also, I went ahead and chopped the nuts in my food processor, because I didn't have three hours to chop nuts in batches. I didn't find my baklava to be "too heavy", nor did they seem to release any more oil. Just watch them carefully.

Even if it doesn't turn out (not uncommon, phyllo is a pain to work with), you'll appreciate how great your house will smell. T accommodate a friend with a walnut allergy, I substituted pecans. Still tasted great.

This is an excellent recipe. It seems to be more of the North African/Tunisian/Moroccan style with the citrus as opposed to a classic Greek or Turkish variety. My only recommendation would be to count your phylo sheets before you start. At least in my experience the number of phylo sheets found in one pound varies from 16-28 depending on manufacturer. Aside from that I have made this recipe over 20 times and have had no problems. It is a simple, though time consuming recipe. However, every baklava recipe is time consuming. The flavor is great. I try to always use fresh spices and grind them myself, otherwise it can taste a little underspiced.

This was wonderful, and easier than I expected. Quite time consuming, but simple enough. The citrus is a really nice touch, and I can't imagine Baklava without it now. Used sliced almonds as a shortcut. Have made it twice, and will do it again!

Very good, but could've done things a little differently: the nutmeg and cloves were a little over-powering. there was way too much of the nut mixture. It too was over-powering. might try pistachios instead of walnuts a little too citrus-y so I'd only add half the fruit But it was a very flavorful baklava.

I really liked this recipe. The orange adds a nice twist to it. I make it without the lemon since I am allergic. Every person I've given this to has said it is the best baklava they have ever tried.

This recipe looks overly complicated. My Greek mother-in-law's recipe looks identical to the 2000 recipe on this site and is simpler. The note about not chopping the nuts in a food processor is priceless; the total amount of oil in nuts is the same no matter how you chop them!

This is Baklava like you've never had it. The lemon and orange added a nice citrusy flavor that isn't common. I actually served this to friends who had lived in Cyprus, who said it was the best they had ever eaten.

What a fantastic recipe. This was my first attempt at baklava, and I am exceptionally pleased at the result. Like another reviewer, I also used sliced almonds and it worked out perfectly. It was quite labor-intensive, though my phyllo came in approx. 10 x 14" sheets, so that made things quite a bit easier. I ended up using more butter for brushing than the recipe calls for, but I think I may have let it cool too much during assembly and ended up globbing it on a bit. Regardless, it turned out great. My guests raved and said it was the best baklava they have ever tasted. The fact that it was not overly syrupy and wet was a total bonus. The citrus flavor was wonderful, and if I make it again I would probably use the same recipe since it turned out so well.

Great, easy recipe! I used pistachios in lieu of walnuts, and also used sliced almonds in lieu of the whole. Was a big hit at Christmas dessert!

Excellent! The only change is that I made the syrup the way my mom does (next time will try this syrup). The baklava was made exactly as written and turned out beautifully.

I made this recipe exactly as written and found the syrup to be "the best". Wonderful recipe.

I made this recipe using half-pistachio-half-walnut, and cut the ingredient amounts in half for a smaller dish. I also cut the bake times by nearly 25% to compensate. The result was flaky, delicious, and acclaimed by my co-workers and dinner party guests. I would try this recipe again with pecan instead of walnut. The pistachios tasted a little strange to my expectations, but others were more than satisfied. The syrup tasted delicious, even with an accidental overdose of squeezed orange pulp and juice.

I used 1/2 cup orange juice instead of the fresh orange. Because I don't typically like Baklava because it's too sweet, I cut back the sugar by 1/4 cup in both the syrup and the filling. I also only used about 2/3 of the syrup over the baked pastry....the rest I used on pork chops. I couldn't stop eating this stuff!!! YUM!

I make this dish three times per year I learned to make this as a child and have kept making it thro the years. There is other greek dishes that I have made in my life and still make them until today. They are delicious

I found the syrup had too much of a citrus flavor, but perhaps I shouldn't have squeezed all of the juice out of the lemon and orange. My box of phyllo, which was pre-cut into pieces the size of the baking dish, did not contain 50 sheets, so we had to short-change layers at the top. I would make the recipe again, but make the syrup differently and use fewer phyllo sheets.

Rating: 3
This recipe did require more time than I thought it would and I lost count with the number of sheets and layers, but I did use more than 50. Adding the lemon and orange to the syrup added a nice citrusy flavor to the baklava that isn't common. I thought it was a nice, subtle twist.

This was my first attempt at baklava, and we were extraordinarily pleased with the results. The citrus flavor of the syrup makes it extra special. The last couple of pieces were not eaten until two weeks later, and they were still fantastic.

This is identical to my mother's recipe - which is a Greek recipe. For the phyllo to come out flaky the butter needs to be clarified. And you should wait for baklava to cool completely before adding syrup.

I am a novice cook, and while this recipe turned out well, it was a lot o effort. Also, I misunderstood the directions and removed the uncooked pieces after I had cut them and ended up baking them separately. Don't think it turned out as well as it could have if I didn't do that.

Rating: 3
Actually, the recipe is correct with its amount of phyllo. The directions say to cut the dough in half crossways and then you will have the 50 sheets you need (with 6 left over to be precise).

The clasic baklava which is a Turkish desert, requires 2 boxes of philo dough. The syrup should be prepared with sugar only. Addition of honey makes it very sweet and gouey. You can add few almonds but the essential nut is walnuts.

I made Baklava for the first time last weekend, it was both hard and rewarding! I loved the flavor of this recipe, but there is one error. It says to purchase 1 pound of phyllo dough, about 28 sheets. I wasn't paying attention, and just grabbed 1 pound. Turns out that there were only 18 sheets in the package. Later in the recipe, it states that you should use 50 sheets! I was in the middle of making the Baklava when I discovered this, so I only used 18 sheets. Other than that, it was a great recipe and it was a big hit at my cooking club!
