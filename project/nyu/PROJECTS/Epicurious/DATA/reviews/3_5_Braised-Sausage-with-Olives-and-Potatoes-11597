Of course I had to give this 4 forks. Growing up in an old fashioned italian family this was a standby which we always called italian "hash". I was wondering about regional variations of the dish when contemplating dinner this evening and came upon this recipe. I happened to have all the ingredients on hand and we loved it.

This was easy and yummy! I used one pound each of sweet italian and smoked chorizo sausages as that's what was in my freezer. I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil as it seemed more Mediterranean. Finally, I would suggest par-boiling the potatoes before adding them. I cooked this much longer than stated (1.5 hours) which really enhanced the flavors but the potatoes were still a bit firm. Finally, I added a handful of chopped parsley for color and flavor. I had a dish like this in an Italian restaurant many years ago and have tried a number of recipes to recreate that delicious version; this is the closest I came. I served with warm country bread and a green salad -- perfect winter dinner.

Amazing flavors for such a simple dish! Will definitely make again and again.

Simple as can be. I agree with the previous reviewer that it's stuff you have on hand - and with a couple little ones at home, that is a lifesaver. Besides, (cholesterol counting aside) I just love Italian sausage in all its incarnations. This is one to make over and over again.

I can't believe that this dish hasn't been reviewed in the past 13 years! It was DELICIOUS as well as QUICK and EASY! I was looking for something simple using what I had in the house. So I searched for "sausage and potato" and this one turned up. I have several favorite recipes that used sausage with sauerkraut and/or lentils, but just felt in the mood for potatoes. This recipe was delicious and SIMPLE. I substituted stewed tomatoes since I had no peppers on hand and also added some herbs (thyme and sage) to taste. Good as is, but you might want to add a starch (noddles or rice) or even a vegetable (green beans, brussel sprouts, or whatever) for a more substantial meal.
