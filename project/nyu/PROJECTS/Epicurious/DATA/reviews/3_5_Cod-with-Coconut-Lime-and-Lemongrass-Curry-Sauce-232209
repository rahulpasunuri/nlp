This was amazingly easy and delicious! I followed the advice from some other reviewers and only used one cup of chicken stock. I'm sure it would have been good with the three cups of stock, but I didn't have that much. I also used fish sauce instead of salt I served it over rice. This is a definite keeper.

I think this recipe is okay. For west coast sensibilities, or for anyone accustomed to fairly authentic asian cooking, it's a bit disappointing. Flavors are pretty mild, but certainly pleasant. The "sauce" as written does not become thicker than a relatively thin soup, so definitely follow the suggestion to serve in a bowl instead of on a plate. The cod takes considerably longer to become "golden brown" than 2-1/2 minutes, which you probably already suspected. The half-pound of butter in the water for the bok choy has got to be a typo, don't do it. A couple of tablespoons is all you need. Saute the curry powder in the butter (or ghee) for a minute or so before adding the rest of the ingredients, to bring out the flavor and avoid a disappointing taste. You will need at least another tablespoon of butter in the saute pan for the veggie stage of the preparation. The business of chilling the bok choy is a red herring: if you time things correctly the bok choy is done at the end of the oven time and you can drain and serve it directly. Many here have given good ideas about how to amend the recipe. If you choose to make it [mostly] as written, this review gives you my experience and point of view.

I did this recipe in a smaller batch, using the same amount of shallots, garlic and lemongrass, using lime zest in place of kafir leaves. I used only one 13 oz. can of chicken broth which reduced nicely before adding the coconut milk. I had only a jar of Thai red curry paste, which I heartily recommend. I used 3 tsp. of the paste which gave a divine kick and worked perfectly with the other Thai flavors.

Blech. Perhaps the dish would have been transformed with the lime leaves (I could not find any) but I did not care for that curry powder taste in this dish.

This recipe is very easy to make if you have frozen ginger and lemongrass in a tube. It can be put together quickly and the combination of flavors is exotic and very satisfying. I have used small potions as an appetizer or eaten a couple bowls as a complete dinner. A couple times used kale instead of bok choy because the garden was producing prodigious amounts of kale. I probably prefer the bok choy but the purple/green kale was also beautiful in the bowl. Straining the broth makes it very classy. I just use a fine mesh metal strainer which works fine. Better Than Bullion chicken broth has been a fine ingredient and is quick also. I am sure homemade chicken broth would take this to an even higher level. Cod is excellent and I have also used frozen wahoo (ono) from Trader Joes successfully.

fantastic dish! The flavors are great! Nice twist on classic Thai flavors. I'd highly recommend using fish sauce instead of plain salt. Truly makes the sauce better. I used about 2tsp of fish sauce....but it should be to your taste. Also, as a nice garnish, chiffonade some additional kaffir leaves and place on top of the fish before serving.

Been making this for years. Love it, as do my guests. I keep the sauce and use it again the next day to marinate, then poach shrimp. Kaffir lime leaves are essential to the wonderful flavour.

I was excited to find this recipe... but honestly was VERY confused by the Madras Curry. I went with it, thinking they used it for a reason, but I really think that it needs to be a Thai curry to go well with all the other ingredients. I'll try it again with a Green Thai Curry paste. I won't make it again with Madras curry. Oh, and I read about not using the Light Coconut milk, too late... I had already bought it. So I added a couple tablespoons flour to the sweated spices, used only two cups of stock, reduced the broth a bit and then added the entire can of coconut milk. Sauce had a lovely texture and taste - before adding madras curry anyways.

Tasty - the sauce complemented the cod very well. However, wonder if the effort of homemade curry is worth it. I think you could get similar results with a store-bought Thai curry paste and coconut milk (as another reviewer suggested). Also, the 2 sticks of butter in the bok choy cooking water doesn't seem necessary - didn't come out tasting buttery at all.

I followed the recipe almost to the letter (no fresh cilantro so had to use dried) and really liked it. I wasn't sure how the cod would hold up to a really spicy sauce, so I used a mild curry. Next time I would be comfortable using a hot curry and would even subsititute galangal for the ginger. I served it over brown basmati rice with broccoli on the side.

Not sure what I missed here. The sauce was thin, the bok choy overwhelming. Nothing at all special. For the labor... will not make again.

Yum, yum, YUM. Only changed two things, no cod so I used grouper. No kaffir lime leaves, used lime zest. Topped it over brown basmati. This is a do over, a keeper, one of my all time favs.

Made this last night and it was great! I made rice noodles and put them at the bottom of the bowl and topped them off with the fish, bok choy and sauce which I thickened a bit with some corn starch. I am planning on having the left overs for lunch YUM!

I used lime zest instead of kaffir lime leaves, and some yellow onion instead of shallots. Didn't put any butter in with the bok choy, and used tofu in place of cod and vegetable stock instead of chicken stock as I wanted this a vegetarian dish. I put this over soba noodles, reduced the sauce first to thicken it. Absolutely delicious!

This was really delicious! I made it close to the recipe, with lime zest instead of kaffir. Served the fish over a bed of spinach leaves and rice noodles which I had soaked and then simmered in the sauce.

I made this pretty close to the recipe except I used Thai Red curry paste as per suggestions from some of the reviewers. I also served it was rice on the side. My husband and son loved it and ended up dumping the rice right into the bowl with everything else. I will probably try to thicken the sauce up a bit more next time but otherwise just great.

Delicious! Perfect for those who are on a low carb diet. I substituted lime zest for Kaffir lime leaves and lemon zest for lemongrass. This is on my "keeper" list!

Well I don't get it ... Very bland and boring. I LOVE curry and have made many other simpler curry dishes. I really REALLY had to doctor this up - added some Fish Sauce as well as a little bit of red pepper flakes. There's a much simpler approach to a good curry sauce for the fish -- just take a can of yellow or green curry paste, add some coconut milk, fish sauce, and some pepper flakes for additonal heat if you want along wish a little basil ... very basic and very good. This recipe, not so much.

I did not add curry as my husband doesn't care for it, but otherwise obeyed the recipe. It was absolutely delicious!

I made some simple refinements to really elevate this dish. I marinated halibut in the sauce (adding turmeric for color, and cutting the lemon juice and coconut from this state)for a couple hours. Then removed the fish from the marinade, boiled the marinade andran it through a seive. Then added coconut milk and a touch of sambal and fresh cilantro for added color. Gorgeous color! Pooled it around the grilled halibut.

For days when I feel like I'm forcing myself to eat fish, this is perfect. Lots of fun flavours. I had all the ingredients on hand and didn't change a thing. I'm not a big fan of fish, but this is one that I'll be making again.

I really had to substitute using what was on hand - Onions for shallots, scallions for kaffir lime leaves, ginger powder for fresh, ground coriander for fresh cilantro, dried lemongrass for fresh, chicken broth for stock, spinach and celery for bok choy. The end result? Absolutely delicious. I can't even imagine what it would taste like if I made it using the exact ingredients. I cooked the sauce base for a little longer to intensify the flavors. Remember to add additional butter if doing this. Otherwise you'll burn it. It made a lot more sauce than I expected. So I thew it back in the pan and added a little flour to thicken it up. Next time (oh yes there will be a next time!)I'll take one of the other reviewers suggestions and serve with glass noodles to absorb some of the yummy sauce.

Cannot believe this is the first time I came across this delicious recipe. Neighbors are always giving us fresh caught fish, and with some of your suggestions, came out with the best dinner ever. I intend to make a triple batch of sauce base(minus the coconut milk) and keep it in the freezer for the next time the catch comes in.

Great recipe!! I just made this for dinner tonight. I substituted Thai Red curry for Madras and used Galanga instead of regular ginger. The recipe is simple to make; but delivers complex layers of flavor and a beautiful presentation to boot.

YUM! Great call on the food processor approach, Carlsbad! I also recommend: 1. adding tofu, red peppers and tomato (or those mushrooms) to the sauce post-processor; 2. Pair this meal with Gewurztraminer wine. We had a really nice one from Anderson Valley's Lazy Creek Vineyards, 2006. Cheers!

This was excellent and easy to make; although, since I made it on the fly, I did not have Madras curry or bok choy. I used a spicy Thai red curry instead and fresh spinach for the bok choy. I cooked everything in my wok, even the fish, and served it with bean thread noodles in a bowl, but the whole family thought it would have been better next to rice.

Rating: 4
Excellent flavor - instead of straining all the ginger, garlic, shallots, etc. out of the sauce and discarding, I put them into food processor and then back into sauce which made for very intense flavors. Probably increased the ginger, garlic, lemongrass, shallots by about 30%. Also, pan sauteed baby bokchoy with king trumpet mushrooms in ginger and lemongrass.

Delicious. I made glassy noodles with garlic, ginger, tomatoes and bell peppers as a garnish and this went well with the rich fish. I also thought the broth (before the coconut milk is put in) smelled delicious and would make a great base for a soup. One note: I had thinner cod filets and I wondered if I need to flip them earlier (a minute and a half), but 2-2 1/2 minutes is right. (After a minute, mine were still sticking to the pan and fell apart).

This was very good--my family really enjoyed it--but I wish the sauce had been more intensely flavored. I did the recipe as written with the exception of the madras curry, which I couldn't find, so I used Thai red curry paste instead. I look forward to trying this again, but perhaps using home-made chicken stock, and cooking the sauce longer (before adding the coconut milk) to intensify the flavors a bit more.

I agree with a previous reviewer: Do not be tempted to use light coconut milk here! You will end up with a soup instead of a sauce. This otherwise is an easy and delicious recipe.

I made this for dinner tonight using talapia and it was excellent! The sauce was rich in flavor with just enough ginger and citrus elements. Thanks for the suggestion to use lemon zest in place of lemongrass, which I couldn't get either. I also used chinese celery in place of bok choy, ditto above. Presentation was lovely and will make for guests next time.

We made this tonight with some Barramundi I'd picked up. The sauce has nice flavor but I used light coconut milk which was a mistake. It definitely needed the richer flavor and texture of the regular coconut milk so don't be tempted to use light for this recipe.

Fantastic recipe. Added lime zest and chili flakes to broth before straining. Delicious, highly recommended.

I thought this dish was delicious (and quick to make too).I used extra coconut milk and chicken broth to make extra sauce. I also cooked the rice in sauce so that it took on the flavour, a bit like a stew. Then i quickly fried the cod to get some texture, and added it to the stew. finally i served it in soup bowls as a hot hearty winter dish. delicious

Wow, this was good. I used 1/2 cup more broth than called for so I wouldn't have to put any in the frig, and cooked the sauce a few minutes more. Then, after adding the coconut milk, I looked at the volume of sauce, and added the rest of the can. There wasn't one drop of sauce left! This was a hit with 2 of my three teenaged boys, and even the picky third one liked everything well enough to eat it. We will definitely make this again, with the changes I mentioned.

An excellent way to make cod! Served it over lemongrass rice with the bok choy and lots of sauce. Delicious!

The sauce is out of this world. I used grated lemon peel and the juice of 1/2 lemon to make up for the lemongrass ( none avail the day I made this). I put the slices of 2 carrots and 5 small potatoes quartered in the pan. Then instead of searing the cod I just layed it over the top and poached it with the sauce. I served in the bowls as suggested with bok choy. It was delicious. Heidi Abele-Ralston,

This sauce is delicious! My 23 yr old daughter and I made the sauce from this recipe, which we poured over broiled black cod on a bed of stir-fried rice noodles, baby bok choy, sliced mushrooms, onion and garlic, seasoned with thai chili sauce, and moistened with leftover chicken stock from making the sauce. We were stretching 1-1/4 lb of fish into dinner for 4. Just a little more fish would have been better, but it was pretty close to the right amount as is. (Couldn't find the lime leaves so we left them out.)

For this tasty Asian-type dish, I used haddock , light coconut juice, and cauliflower instead of bok choy, as that's what I had on hand. The flavor was more delicate than I expected. I generously peppered the fish and served it and the sauce over rice flanked by steamed cauliflower. Next time I'd add more ginger and cilantro and a different curry powder than the Madras hot I pulled from the rack. I think coconut milk instead of the light juice I used would give it more body and improve the results.
