One of the best mango chutneys I have made (the other one is my aunt's recipe but I never seem to have it handy when I need it!) My best friend is Pilipina and her mom taught me how to eat mangoes their way. Cut both mango "cheeks", that is, along either side of the pit, then slice the meat in a grid pattern, then use a spoon to remove the cubes from the skin. I have found this is the easiest way to "cube" mangoes without slicing my skin off, which almost happend when I tried peeling them first.

Best chutney ever! I used only half the seeds in the jalapeno, and I'm glad. It was quite spicy, without going over the top. If I were going to make for company I would probably make two chutneys, one with seeds and one milder version without the seeds. My husband said "You could bottle this!" I think that's a good compliment :)

Excellent chutney recipe! Easy to make, too. I only used one mango and scaled it down. Now I wish I had made the whole thing! Made for chicken tikka recipe. Used the leftovers of both to make a killer "curried chicken" sandwich! Definitely a keeper!

Gluttonous. Everyone loves this dish. I'm convinced that I will never find a soul who can criticize this dish... maybe it's the 1/3 cup of brown sugar. Expect complements.

This is a truly delicious mango chutney. I find that it freezes (and then thaws) quite well. Yum! Highly recommended!

Excellent and easy chutney. I used minced crystallized ginger instead of fresh, for a bit more sweetness. Did 2/3's of the recipe with 2 mangos, which yields a liter of chutney. Had it as a side dish with grilled chicken, and then husband spread some on his sandwich of leftover chicken the next day. Still plenty left to enjoy over the next couple of weeks.

This was delicious! I only had 2 mangoes so I roughly 2/3-rds the rest of the ingredients too and it was fine, very forgiving. Highly recommend with the Chicken Tikka. Mangoes are kind of weird to cut up though.. I don't eat them so it was a first. Must find out how to do that more efficiently..

A standard in my summer kitchen, this chutney goes with chicken, shrimp, or just plain rice. I usually leave out the raisins, making it more versatile.

Goes great with chicken tikka, but can see using for other meats as well.

Served this with Chicken Tikka & Spicy Indian Orzo. Very delicious! Got rave reviews. Made it a day in advance & the flavors melded wonderfully.

It's the reason I make Chicken Tikka.

Neither my husband nor I eat mangoes. I tried this with the Chicken Tikka and we both loved it. A flavorful accompaniment. Will definately make again.

I was looking for something to liven up the holiday turkey breast. This was wonderful, prepared per directions. Today I tried some on a turkey sandwich and it was great this way too.

Made this with balsamic rather than white vinegar, it made it look a bit unappetizing but it tasted phenomenal. My family completely ignored the chicken tikka except as an excuse for more chutney.

I loved the taste of this but I would suggest putting the mango mixture in the food processor prior to cooking it. I think it would improve the texture.

This is an excellent accompaniment to the chicken tikka. We only used one mango and it was reasonably easy to reduce the other ingredients.

This is super! Really adds to the chicken. It would be good served as an appetizer with crip pita chips. Make sure it's at room temp.
