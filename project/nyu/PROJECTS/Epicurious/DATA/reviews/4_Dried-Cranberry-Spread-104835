I loved this, and I usually don't care for goat cheese.I used what I had around; cherry flavored craisins, an 8 oz block of cream cheese at room temperature,omitted the yogurt, and used a Tablespoon of honey right off. I used the Safeway brand of goat cheese and gave it a test squeeze for softness. Yum!

Some fridge substitutions: Full fat cream cheese, no goat cheese, 3 T. nonfat yogurt, 1 T clover honey and 1 T. buckwheat from the farmer's market. I made this with my electric mixer instead of the cuisinart. Creamy, light, delicious on sweet potato zucchini bread (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Sweet-Potato-and-Zucchini-Bread-2674) with added cranberries and dried apples.

This is a great cream cheese spread. I actually forgot to get the goat cheese so i added some full fat cream cheese in its place, along with the fat free cream cheese. I used it to make turkey pin wheels (tortilla type bread, turkey breast, this spread and lettuce, rolled up and cut into 2 inch slices) for my mom for her mother's day lunch. it was a big hit! will definitely make it again.

Made this to take to work with bagels. Everyone liked it, and asked for recipe. It is so easy to throw together. Would be a nice addition to any breakfast or brunch. Will keep this one.

Yummy - worth the extra $$ for low-fat deli cream cheese and Montrachet (French goat cheese).

I wish I could find a way to ask Bon Appetit to include the count for sodium on its nutrition lists.

Very easy to make and always well received. A nice alternative to plain cream cheese for bagels.

This is really good stuff. Everybody loved it and I have made it 3 or 4 times for company. It is good on bagel chips or water crackers. I did use regular cream cheese as I do not like non-fat. Everyone likes the sweetness of the honey cranberry mix.
