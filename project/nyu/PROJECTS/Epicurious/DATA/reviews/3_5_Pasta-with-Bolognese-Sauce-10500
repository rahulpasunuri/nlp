I've made this so many times, it's become a household staple. And it keeps getting better. My thoughts: 1. Use fresh farmer's market tomatoes instead of canned. Throw em in a food processor and puree; then add to the pot. Makes the sweetest sauce ever. 2. Switch meat ratio to 3 parts pork to 1 part beef. Yum. 3. I use salt and (often white) pepper twice; a few pinches when I add the tomatoes, and then again before serving, if needed. Gives this hearty sauce a bit more zest.

Good enough,but two points. First, what fire of Hades is needed to brown a pound of meat in roughly two minutes? Try ten. Second, I like others thought this needed a bit more tomato -- whether more whole tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, or extra pasta sauce, it appeared a bit dreary as written.

I tried this again without changing anything, and it was just as good as the first time I had made it. One thing I may do next time I make it, tomorrow, is to blend the tomato sauce to smooth it out a bit. Definitely a keeper though, as I use this sauce for a lasagna base, over polenta, etc...

We thought this was just okay. A bit bland. we added some balsamic vinagrette and also some beef broth and grated parm to liven it up a bit. that definitely helped.

Very very good. I used whatever I had on hand to make this: I didn't have carrot, but I added crimini mushrooms, and subbed turkey for the meat. I also roasted my own tomatoes in the over, then blended them and added them to the veggie/meat/milk/wine mixture. Also subbed red wine for white. Simmered for the 1h15 min, and it turned out really nice. I would love to try this again without having to change anything.

I make this recipe a lot for my family, and it's always a hit. Even though it takes some time, it's very simple to prepare. Instead of using ground pork and ground chuck, I use a blend of ground beef and ground veal.

A good Bolognese. I browned the meat separately and poured off the fat before mixing with the sauteed veggies. I used half and half instead of milk and cut the white wine in half. But at the end I added a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar to brighten up the flavor. Next time I will try the recommended amount of wine. I also bubbled the pureed tomatoes separately to reduce a bit before stirring everything together to get a jump start on reducing the sauce.

good, but just tasted like a standard meat sauce...nothing outstanding. maybe this is exactly what its supposed to be. i guess i was looking for something more like ragu that you get in good italian restaurants. i did add some dried thyme, used red wine instead of white, and drained a lot of the fat. ok, but will probably keep looking for a good bolognese.

Quick, easy and wonderfully tasty. I've tried many more complicated bolognese sauces and never found one as good. Yum.

Awesome recipe, modified a little: just used ground beef (draining excess juices while frying - cooked beef first with clove of garlic, then took out and did the veg also with clove of garlic), changed the white wine for red and added 1 tblsp tomato paste + 1 cup chicken stock, when adding the tinned tomatos...best one yet - my son even wants it for breakfast!!

I made this with ground chicken. It was incredible. I threw red pepper flakes in with the nutmeg, used an entire can of tomato paste at the end (didn't have enough time to let it sit and simmer to reduce) and threw in a splash of red wine with the tomatoes. Next time I'll add an extra carrot and celery rib... delicious.

I love this dish. I used it to woo my girlfriend, then again, months later, to win over her family. Be sure to use the freshly grated whole nutmeg, it makes a big difference and you'll be glad to have some on the spice rack.

i cooked the sauce according to directions. i'm a 'taster' so i'm constantly tasting during the process. it seemed bland, but i thought i should just wait. well, it was still bland after two hours. the milk and nutmeg made me think of lasagne, which made me think of bechemel--so i added about 1/2 cup bechemel sauce. it made it creamier and generally improved the sauce. not outstanding, but not bad! lots of work for just 'not bad' though.

Rating: 3
This recipe came out tasting quite authentic. Bolognese always falls a little to the bland side for my taste, but this was well-balanced and elegantly mild. I added a couple of garlic cloves to the vegetables as well as a half-can of tomato paste and two chicken livers to the tomatoes before blending to make it a touch zestier and creamier. Will make it again, but definitely in the winter next time!

This is my go-to pasta sauce. I make quadruple batches and freeze it in many small tupperwares for easy weeknight dinners. I've made this sauce as-is, but I've also made it with other meats I've had on hand. I'm trying to use up a bunch of venison so my last several batches have been an equal combination of ground chuck and ground venison. This recipe is simply a standout.

I make this as written, but I add a can of tomato sauce. I find it too meaty otherwise. My six-year-old INHALES it. I prefer something creamier... richer... but... my six-year-old INHALES it. I have a double-batch sitting in my freezer.

I just made this and here are my tweaks: 1) I added about 1/2 a can of tomato paste that I had in the fridge to the meat after browning. 2) I seasoned with nutmeg, salt, pepper, a bay leaf and some dried oregano. I added all these seasonings to the meat and tomato paste mixture before adding any liquids. 3) I used red wine, and added it before the milk. It turned out hearty, flavourful and delicious -- a definite keeper recipe. It looks like the kind of thing that will freeze really well and will work great as a lasagna sauce.

Rating: 3
I've made this 3 times. Decent recipe, although I made a few changes based on other comments: 1) Used meatloaf mix (veal+pork+beef). 2) Added a few cloves of garlic. 3) A bit before the pasta is al dente, drain and add some sauce so that the sauce cooks into the pasta. 4) Cook this on bare simmer as long as you can manage, 3-4 hours is not too long.

Very flavourful sauce. Used all lean meat and added a couple of minced garlic cloves. Had no celery so had to omit that. Only skim milk and light creme in the fridge so I used 1/2 cup each. Flexible recipe and still tasted great.

Rating: 4
this is simly delicious! My only suggestion would be this: a minute or two before the pasta reaches the al dente point (so, still fairly undercooked), drain it, leaving about an inch or two of pasta water in the bottom of the pot with the pasta. Add several large scoops of the pasta sauch (probably about a cup or two) and stir. Cook the pasta to completion in this mixture. The flavour saturates the pasta, and you don't have the problem of a wonderful sauce trying to mask the bland, mealy flavour of plain pasta. Trust me - this really makes a difference.

I thought this recipe was delicious. My piece of advice would be to cook the meal separately from the veggies. I forgot to do this and was therefore unable to remove the excess fat. I found the final product to be greasier than I would have liked. I served it over papardelle with roasted garlic bread and caesar salad. yum!

Made this for my husband and our ski buddies on a cold night in VT. Paired with some crusty roasted garlic bread and some blanched broccolini dressed with Olive Oil, Lemon, sea salt and a bit of sauteed garlic. A tremendous hit! Made enough for 8 ppl and it went!! Perfect with Pinot Noir or Merlot so the wine doesnt compete with this full bodied sauce. I will definitely make this again!

I doubled the recipe, used red wine since it was open, whole milk, and served over peppardelle with fresh slices of parmesan.

I love this recipe! I had been trying to find a good italian bolognese sauce that the whole family likes and this is it! I have made it a few times since I found it, but have tweaked the recipe just a bit... now I add 1 clove of garlic and some fresh parsley to it. Its the perfect sauce.

I inadvertently skipped over the part about cooking down the wine and had to throw it in after the tomatoes. I was sure the sauce was ruined but actually it was fine, and we really enjoyed it as a Saturday dinner on a chilly spring night. We couldn't find tagliatelle but used another wide flat pasta that turned out just right.

fantastic! made with fresh papardelle, and was quite extraordinary! also, made with red wine rather than white; and as much as i like to save calories if possible, made with whole milk.. i'm sure 2% could be okay as well. also, i'm a sauce fan, so i consider one batch per recipe to serve 4, not 6 like recipe states. boil pasta, drain, and take a few scoops of sauce and toss. then serve on preheated plates, topped with this divine sauce; along with shavings of good parmesan-not grated... don't skimp on the quality of the cheese. enjoy!

Agree with Clove - to each his own with Bolognese sauce. Stick with the recipe the first time, then start tweaking when you make it again. I did need longer to boil wine and milk, and red wine substituted just fine, since I drink more of that anyway. :) DO NOT short the prep/simmer time on this - it takes every bit of time, but is well worth it.

My husband (who is a tough customer when it comes to food) proclaimed this the best Bolognese he's ever had! Have to admit it was delicious, but not being an expert in Italian cuisine, I'm not quite ready to give it top honors. That said, though, I loved the layering of flavors. Such simple ingredients layered upon one another and yielding such a complex sauce. Don't skimp on the ingredients and definitely follow the steps exactly.

This recipe was GREAT! My boyfriend and brother are professional chefs...and they LOVED it! I have made it almost 3 times in the last month. It took me a little longer to boil down the milk and wine than 10 mins, and I was definately concerned with the flavor after just adding the tomatoes...but after 1 - 1 1/2 hours of simmering, all the flavors came together beautifully! Its recipes like this that are easy and taste great that get me excited about learning how to cook!

I thought this recipe was excellent. I used ground veal instead of ground chuck and added 200g chopped pancetta in the onion phase. Grated LOTS of nutmeg. After everything was browned & reduced I put it in the slow cooker for the day - because any excuse to use my slow cooker is a good one. I've frozen 3/4 of a double batch...yum.

I made this dish last night, my first time making Bolognese sauce. As per some suggestions from the reviews I added 4 cloves of chopped garlic and some beef broth. In addition I had a bottle of red wine opened so used that instead of white and only used ground beef. The sauce came out excellent! My fiancé on the second round ate it like chili, sans pasta, so I guess it was good :) . Also, I made a double batch and froze some for another night.

This has been a favorite recipe in our house since the first time I made it. I always double the recipe to allow enough to freeze for another meal. I agree that all steps take a longer cooking time but this sauce is thick, rich and great every time. I usually add two cloves of crushed garlic with the onion and omit the nutmeg. I have also used mild pork sausage in place of the ground pork and was even more delighted with the flavor.

I made this from the 'Gourmet' Cookbook without reading the reviews on this web site first. I thought it was lacking a little something.

This is a very good sauce. For the purists you may like to try the following. I was in Bologna in 1969 and this was the recipe for bolognese from one of the oldest, family owned restaurants. Use flank or skirt from the belly of the cow for flavour. Mince it yourself. It should look minced but not too fine. Two cooks knives & a wooden chopping board works well. For EVERY 300g of meat use the following. 50g of finely chopped pancetta. 30g [by weight] of good quality olive oil, 30g ea. of very f. chopped onion, carrot & celery. 1 cup of white wine. Lots of freshly ground nutmeg [ essential & not discernable in the finished sauce], freshly gr. black pepper & a little salt. 2 tbls of good tomato paste and one cup of water [fresh or tinned tomatoes can be too acidic for this sauce]. Follow the same cooking methods. This sauce relies on the finest ingredients and very, very long and careful cooking. Tagliatelle is traditional but any FRESH pasta is essential for this rich and very thick meat sauce.

Just about to make this again tonight. A wonderful sauce! I followed the suggestions of others in the past and added 4 oz procuitto and 1.5 c beef broth. It certainly adds to the cooking time, but the idea is the layering of all the different flavors... and what wonderful flavors! As with most sauces, cook for a long time, low heat and it is even better the 2nd day. I can't wait until tonight when I will make it again.

This is a really meaty and hearty recipe. Definitely for cold weather. I really liked it. It is not what I had thought bolognese sauce was until I traveled throughout Europe. I cooked my sauce for 3 hours. I added a little sugar. This is a thick sauce which goes well with freshly grated cheese.

I use tomato sauce, insted of tomatoes as it will give it more of a sauce consistency then dense. I also add fresh nutmeg (and lots of it). Cooking it for 3-5 hours is critical. This is my husband's favorite and he has tried Bolognese at each Italian restaurant we go to and still says this is the best one

This recipe wasn't to our taste. I think we were looking for something with more tomato to top our pasta. I have a standard meat sauce recipe that I prefer to this.

Okay! So who's Mom has THE "authentic" meatloaf recipe?? Raise your hands. Hmm! I see millions of hands out there. Oh--your mom doesn't use bread crumbs? Huh! Mine used oatmeal! Yours must not be authentic! sigh This sauce is as authentic as you want it to be. With the changes I made, (lots of thyme, beef broth, etc) it's as authentic as I need. And yes--it is condensed. More meat than sauce. That's what bolognese is. If you want spaghetti SAUCE, make spaghetti sauce. That can be done in 20 minutes. This takes hours of simmering & love. I know! I know! Some sauce takes simmering. But bolognese takes HOURS to become the REAL thing. No matter what recipe you use.

This is the genuine article! We have been using this recipe for quite some time and adjust it to what's available in the house. We also lean on the wine and milk to adjust the "meatiness". We've also experimented with ways to shorten the cook time, with reasonable success. A mainstay in our house.

I agree with the reviewer from PA who thought there was a lot of meat and not enough sauce. But I won't rate this because I don't know what real Bolognese is like and don't want to corrupt the rating system in my ignorance. It had a good flavor and really was easy (though it took a while). I enjoyed it, but will make a lighter sauce next time.

OK. I tried this recipe recently after being disappointed by the Bon Appetite Bolognese recipe (Sept. 2002). Carefully read the reviews and the ratings for Mario Batali's version and was discouraged from trying it for two reasons. It included garlic and it did not include nutmeg. After trying this recipe, I think I made the right decision. I used this recipe as a starting point and added a few ingredients and used techniques that I culled from other recipes (Lidia Bastianich, for one) and reviews. I used ground beef pork and veal. I also used about a half pound of chicken livers. I sauteed these in a separate pan while I was sauteeing the veggies. I also included some leftover diced slab prociutto in the veggie saute. Poured of the fat (lots of it) and added the browned choppped meat to the sauteed vegatbles.Tripled the reduction times on the milk and wine , partly because I doubled the recipe. When I added the tomatoes, I also added some fresh thyme, a cup of leftover canned beef stock , 2 Tbs. of concentrated tomato paste and 3 bay leaves. I also increased the simmering time to nearly four hours. The result? Fantastic! Thick , rich, beautiful color and complex flavor.Didn't miss the garlic at all and the chicken livers were totally undetectable. (I know this because my kids ate it.) I will definitely keep this one as my standard recipe for Bolognese sauce. P.S. Thanks Marina from Cincinatti for your post. I relied heavily on your input for my attempt at this classic comfort food.

Thie is the REAL DEAL. Forget Babbo's so called "bolognese" elsewhere on this site. (Garlic? I don't think so!) Make exactly as directed, don't add or fiddle and you get the genuine article. It's worth the hours of simmering. One exception: I used pappardelle, which is traditional (any wide long noodle is optimal here).

Rating: 0
The secret ingredient to a good Bolognese is chicken livers. I know this scares Americans, but you won't taste the livers, and will get the flavor depth and color that you're looking for. Use about half the amount of the other meats. Also, use veal, so: 1 lb beef, 1/2 lb veal, l/b pork, 1/4 lb chicken livers. (Adjust other amounts as sensible.) Beef stock is very important, you can replace some of the tomato juice. Garlic doesn't help if you follow these suggestions, it will conflict with the livers - but then again not every Italian recipe needs garlic :-)

Rating: 3
This is a good start,some things that I change/add to my recipe are:change milk to heavy cream, skip the canned tomatoes, replace with 1 sm can tomatoe paste and 8oz. of beef stock, add equal part of ground veal with other meats. No garlic or spices other than s&p and the essential ingredient...nutmeg. This is a darker, richer version of this "best of them all" meat sauce.

This recipe is close to the real thing. Add 2 cloves of minced garlic to the saute. Add cooking time to the milk and wine. Buy 28-29 oz. tomato puree for the last step. Slow simmer for 2 hours or more. When serving, use Romano.

In an ongoing search for "my" bolognese recipe, this is the best so far,though I yearn for something still darker/richer, like the sauces I had in Bologna, Italy. I wonder if more wine or a red wine would make the difference. I added about 8 oz. of beef stock because I was determined to cook it for five hours, based on people's comments.

Rating: 3
Ok - it's VERY close to a traditional bolognese sauce EXCEPT it should have beef/meat stock (1.5 C) added over the course of the cooking, should start with about 4T of chopped mortadella (or proscuitto) added after the veggies, before the meat, and should DEFINITELY be cooked for approximately 5 hours. I also add veal to the pork/beef mixture. For those of you who left out the nutmeg, it's crucial. It doesn't taste like nutmeg, but is necessary for flavor depth. Also, bolognese almost NEVER has garlic, basil, etc. in it - that just makes it an excellent meat ragu! For those of you who ended up with hamburger soup, that's lack of cooking I think (per the instructions) - and I PROMISE the nutmeg makes a difference!

I have been looking for a good bolognese recipe for years and I love this one! I added nearly a pound of each meat (which really helped with the amount of liquids in the recipe - I did not have to reduce much longer than the recipe calls for), some garlic, and didn't add the nutmeg, and I really enjoyed the texture and the flavor. I froze some to eat later and will definitely be making it again.

I consider this Bolognese recipe very authentic --the same you would get at any fine italian retaurant. It's meaty and tasty, the way it should be. The only changes I would make is to drain some of the fat after cooking the meat (Leave a small amount of fat for flavor) and cook longer at each step than the recipe calls for. Make sure all liquid is absorbed/evaporated before moving on. This recipe is a definite keeper!

I make this all the time with rave reviews. BUT, it must be cooked much longer at every step to be really delicious. The recipe says to cook for 10 mins (each time) to evaporate the milk and wine. I cook it for 45 mins(ish) for each. The recipe says to cook for 1 hr. 15 mins to thicken as the last step. I cook it for at least 2 hours. This sauce must be very thick to be great...and it is if you take the time to cook it.

I was afraid to make this after all of the poor reviews, however I was desparate to try and recreate a yummy bolognese sauce I had a local restaurant. It ended up tasting great and not at all the meat/tomato soup that everyone else mentioned. I made a few tweaks: I doubled the recipe, I added 3/4 lb of ground veal, 3/4 lb of ground chuck, I kept the fat to add to the taste, instead of milk I added cream, I added an entire bunch of fresh basil, added a tiny amout of garlic and cut down on the white wine by one half (I think this recipe would taste terrible with red wine because of the cream). I shaved pecorino romano and threw some chopped, fresh basil on top and thought it tasted pretty good. I'll definitely make it again.

This recipe is very similar to Marcella Hazan's recipe for Bolognese sauce, other than the fact that she uses only 12 oz of beef, no pork & simmers the ragu for a minimum of three, & preferably five, hours. These changes make a huge difference & her Bolognese sauce is 'to die for'. I've never made it without guests groaning with delight.

Certainly the best Bolognese sauce I've ever had. It is very important to reduce the liquid very slowly: 2 or more hours. The taste is complex and subtle. Based on other reader comments, I also used italian sausage instead of ground pork.

This recipe was just what I was expecting and was a perfect Sunday afternoon cooking project. I was surprised that the recipe called for no seasoning beyond the nutmeg, but I was very pleased with the results. I doubled the recipe and will enjoy thawing and eating the saved portions this winter. My revisions included using hot italian sausage instead of ground pork and tomato puree instead of canned tomatoes. Adding the puree made for a very thick sauce and eliminated waiting for the sauce to reduce at all. I used my hand blender to smooth out the sauce, and voila! A perfect pasta accompaniment. I had mine over gnocchi with green beans on the side and presented a plate with the colors of the Italian flag!

I took this recipe, bearing in mind that bolognese is SUPPOSED to be a relatively mild meat ragu, and added a few things according to some of the previous reviewers comments. First, I started with more aromatics than the recipe called for, all chopped very fine. Then I added a little lemon zest, fresh rosemary and fresh thyme, salt, pepper, and 1 tsp. sugar. Next I included some ground lamb in the meat mixture. Then I deglazed with 1.5 cups of red wine, before adding pureed tomatoes and a little beef broth. Reduce for 1.5 hours, add 3/4 cup cream, reduce 20-30 minutes further, stir in a handful of parmesean or peccorino and serve. It was good, but next time I'll use even more ground lamb in the recipe, but most importantly, I will make the sauce a day ahead.

Very good. I used ground beef and added chopped bacon to this sauce. I also added tsp. dried oregano and fresh garlic.

My husband said this is one of his favorites and I love it too. I've made it several times combining some of the other suggestions along with one of my own. The changes I make are substituting half and half for the milk, draining after cooking the meat and using red wine (Cabernet) instead of white.

I've had more flavorful bolognese sauce so this was a little dissapointing. Big on filling comfort food over gnocchi but lacking in taste...needs ALOT of spicing up.

Delicious. I improvised by adding mushrooms, garlic, a little sugar and threw a small jar of Prego into the sauce to help thicken it. I also drained the grease from the meat before the step of adding the milk to the sauce.

I was disappointed in the recipe. My suggestions for the future: Cut down the fat that you cook the meat in by at least half - the sauce got way too greasy. I used red wine and thought it really overpowered the whole taste - I would cut down on the wine, or eliminate it all together next time.

This is a great winter sauce. Perfect for cold evenings when you want something hearty. Great with a big glass of red wine! I used Italian sausage insteads of the pork and used half and half instead of milk. I would definitely make it again!

This sauce is wonderful! It has become the sauce I use with my lasagna rolls. It is also economical.

A little too bland.

As far as Bolognese recipes go, this is one of my two favorites. I substitue red wine for the white and used only beef but left everything else alone. Fantastic recipe.

WE THOUGHT THIS WAS DELICIOUS!!! THE ONLY THING I WOULD SUGGEST IS TO POUR OFF A BIT OF THE FAT AFTER YOU ADD AND COOK THE BEEF AND PORK. YUMMY THOUGH!!

Wonderful combination of flavors. Serve with crispy salad and crusty garlic bread.

The sauce is outstanding. Serve over a gnocci style macaroni. Pour a good Italian wine (e.g. chianti classico or a sangiovese. Enjoy!!
