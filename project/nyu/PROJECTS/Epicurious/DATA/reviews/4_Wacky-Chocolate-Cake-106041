I have grown up making this cake and it is a hit everytime I take it to a party. When my son would have his pre- teen friends over I would pull them into the kitchen to make a cake in the same pan you bake it in and they thought it was very cool thing to do. To make the chocolate flavor stronger we changed from 6 TBL reg cocoa to 3 TBL reg cocoa and 3 TBL dutch cocoa. This recipe works well at high altitude.

I make this cake about every 6-8 weeks. I love it because its easy and requires only cupboard ingredients. As someone who keeps kosher its great to find a pareve dessert recipe for meals that feature meat/chicken. On the healthy side its relatively low fat for a dessert but not low calorie--it is dessert after all! I followed other reviewers' suggestions and I make it with instant coffee to give it a richer flavour and some cinnamon to give it some zing. One reviewer complained that its not a recipe for chocolate lovers and I'd agree that its not a rich chocolate cake say like a German chocolate cake, but it is nice to have something sweet and chocolatey at the end of a meal and not feel guilty about all of the fat. Of all the recipes I have in my recipe box this is the one I go back to again and again.

The recipe is fine. It's not as chocolatey as other types of chocolate cake but it's wacky cake. it's easy, economical, and fast. it's great for vegans or kids with egg allergies. it's great when you just want to whip up cake last minute with a few pantry items. I usually sub the water with coffee and that seems to intensify the chocolate flavor. oh, and one more thing. i put the cocoa in the warm coffee instead of dumping it in the dry mixture. that really intensifies the chocolate flavor. everything is fine BUT, the recommended 35-40 minutes was way too long for the cake hence the 2 forks. i have a fairly new electric oven and bake all the time. luckily since i like to turn the cake at half time i set the timer 25 minutes. when i went to turn the cake it was completely done. almost too done. as i said, i don't have a particularly hot running oven or anything but the cake was done in 25.

I am quite amazed that this recipe has received 4 forks. Wacky it is. Chocolate it is definitely not. This is not a recipe for chocolate lovers.

I love this cake!!! It is the BEST chocolate cake EVER!!! Its moist and not too sweet! I didn't mix this in the baking pan because it sticks to the pan that way! I mixed it in a mixing bowl and poured it into a greased baking pan! I baked it, but removed it from the pan while it was still warm...once it cools, it will stick to the pan! I know, its the opposite rules for a regular cake! lol! This is a 'must try' recipe!!!

I normally would not make an eggless cake but since my in-laws were visiting us I had to bake one which did not have eggs. At first I thought the cake would not be so tasty but later when we cut it everyone enjoyed it. Took some suggestions from the other viewers & added coffee & chocolate chips.

This was my first foray into vegan cooking and I am MUCH pleased with the results. I'm putting a spin on it by cutting the cake in half lengthwise, lightly soaking half of it in Kahlua, and frosting the layers with vegan coconut-milk ice cream. Call it a Dark White Russian Cake, if you will. Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/reviews/Wacky-Chocolate-Cake-106041?cached=F&savedReview=true#ixzz1NhpzxeCB

When I was a pastry chef, this is the chocolate cake I would make for vegans. I am really happy to see it on Epicurious! I lost my recipe book a few years ago and was googling it to make with my daughter! I like making egg-less things so she can dip her fingers in the batter ;) This cake has been in my family for 60 years! I was really sad to have lost it... hopefully this tastes just as good as my Grammas :)

This recipe is AWESOME!!! My mom is allergic to eggs and by brother has a lactose intolerance and they both loved it! Even my dad, who is not a chocolate person, loved it! This recipe is definitely going in my recipe box.

So I am a novice who loves baking. As much as I consider baking an art, it is no less a science too. I followed the recipe to the T like in a science lab, accurately measuring every bit of the ingredients and I must agree that though the sweetness in the cake was a little less, over all the cake was a big hit. I did not follow the 'three holes' part though. Instead I mixed the dry ingredients first and made a well in between and poured all the separately mixed wet ingredients in there and thoroughly mixed all of it with a table fork and poured it into my loaf pan [as I had nothing else] after greasing with butter and powdering with cocoa powder. I needed a few more minutes than 40 for the cake to be done, but all in all, it was very good. I might follow other reviewers' ideas next time and of course I am making this cake many more times in my life. BTW, did I mention how simple it was-I did not even have to take out my hand-mixer, it is that WOW! Next time I will use chocolate chips and may be even brewed coffee. Whoever is reading this, trust me, you gotta try it at least once. Enjoy! :)

I made this with my 5 year old cousin who is allergic to eggs, dairy, and many other things. Turns out he's also allergic to cocoa, so I omitted the cocoa powder and added a touch extra vanilla. It needs more salt when you do this, because without the bitterness of the cocoa powder, it is sickingly sweet. I made a simple "buttercream frosting" with powdered sugar, vanilla soy milk, sunflower margerine, and made two colors red and blue because at the moment he is Spiderman. He mixed the ingredients (with my help) and frosted it. It was a perfect vegan Spiderman Cake. He was so happy that he could eat cake for the first time in his life and we froze the cake so each time for the next two weeks he wanted cake we took a piece out. It was still delicious two weeks later out of the freezer. Highly recommended!!!

Best simple, classic chocolate cake ever. Bonus that it's vegan so everyone can enjoy it. I like it either drizzled with warm ganache or frosted with vanilla buttercream. Serve with vanilla ice cream...yum!

Wow...this is great! I expected it only to be so-so because there wasn't butter or eggs. But it was REALLY good. Served with a sprinkle of confectioner's sugar and a sprig of mint. YUM!

I made this cake a couple of months ago and was so surprised at how delicious it was. I used pure chocolate melted with butter as frosting just on the top. The cake actually took on a deeper flavor the next day. I also added a little brewed Starbucks columbian coffee to the water--which I think made a big difference. My husband could not tell the difference from other chocolate cake recipes.

This cake is really delicious! It has that "store-bought" soft texture and moistness that I always search for in a homemade cake recipe! I substituted about 3/4 c. brewed coffee and 1/4 c. water instead of a whole cup of water, and it turned out wonderfully!(the coffee flavor was very muted) I also mixed the ingredients in a large bowl then immediately transferred the batter to the prepared pan. Delicious!

Liked the fact that this cake tastes as simple as it was to make. Not overly sweet or excessively chocolate. Good basis for the addition of ice cream or fruit or whatever your preference,

Ahh Wacky Cake... In my family we add sour cream for a denser texture and always make a simple white frosting. We also used to make bowls of it and stuck in the freezer and eat it like frozen fudge - no eggs, no danger - when my brothers were ravenous/lazy teenagers.

I nearly divorced my significant other for tossing out an ancient, semi-filthy cookbook from the 60s with THIS recipe in it. It saw me through my incredibly impoverished student days when eggs or butter might conceivably be unaffordable for the moment. We always ate well anyway and this cake was one of the joys of truly desperate times.

I tried this recipe for my daughters' class party because one of the kids has an egg allergy. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. It made 12 cupcakes, cooked at 350 for 25 minutes. The cake was tender & moist; the tops had a slightly crispy texture. They would be good if you sprinkled with sugar before you baked, unless you plan to frost.

This was SOOO EASY, and I can't believe how moist it came out. I think mixing it all together is probably better than poking the holes...just lets everything get better mixed together. I will DEFINITELY be making this one again!

I use this recipe whenever I'm making a cake for my vegan daughter. I omit the cocoa and use the recipe for pineapple upside down cake, or omit the cocoa and add blueberries in season. Very adaptable.

Who knew a cake without eggs and milk could be so moist and rich? I especially loved that it doesn't tear up the kitchen to make it. (I also used coffee instead of water and increased the cocoa to 1/3 cup.)

I needed a vegan cake recipe for my son's birthday and everything I found was hopelessly complicated, using ingredients not found in my cupboard. This was it! It was easy and turned out delicious.I mixed all the ingredients in a bowl and sustituted fresh dark coffee for the water and added a handful of dark vegan chocolate chips.The result was a dense delicious chocolate cake. I also added a simple chocolate glaze. A definate make again.

I would certainly make this cake again. My godson cannot eat eggs and loved it (as did the adults who ate it and can eat eggs). One thing that I would certainly change is that I would mix all of the ingedients in bowl to ensure that the flour is correctly mixed and not have to worry about my baking pan. Grease the baking pan and then pour in the cake.

The trick to making this superb is to sprinkle about 2 tablespoons cinnamon sugar on top before baking. It forms a lovely, crunchy sheet of a topping that counters the moist, rather plain cake just beautifully! It is a very old recipe & is also called Cowboy Cake. It was our son's favorite cake when he was little.

I made it in the same dish that I baked it in, and the only thing I changed was to put in less sugar. It turned out great for how easy it was. A little dry but some chocolate glaze fixed that.

This is soo easy and fun. I took ideas from others and used coffee instead of water and threw in some chocolate chips and used store bought sour cream frosting. This is great cake!

We needed a dairy and soy free chocolate cake for my daughter's first birthday so we made this one. After reading the previous reviews, we decided to add chocolate chips. Making the holes etc. is unnecessary, though I see how it would make it more fun if you were making this cake with a child. We made 2 9" round cakes, and iced it, and it was delicious. I'm not sure that I would choose it over other cakes with milk, but if you need a non-dairy and non-soy cake, this is a GREAT option.

This cake is great for our almost 3 year old who is allergic to eggs. He loves to help make it. We tried it the first time straight from the recipe. Next time we'll try some additions like chocolate or other kinds of chips to make it more interesting. We also liked it because it was a pretty small recipe. We could finish it in a few days without being total pigs

Perfect cake for people with dairy and egg allergies too! And it's actually delicious. Especially with a few dark chocolate chips thrown into the batter.

I have been making this quick and simple cake for years. Not the most glamourous chocolate cake, but great for a last minute dessert. I don't poke the holes in the pan as I find all the ingredients don't mix well and the cake is overmixed before everything is incorpoated. Rather I mix all the dry ingredients in a bowl, make a well in the center. In a measuring cup, measure the oil, add the vinegar and vanilla and stir and pour in the well in the dry ingredients. Pour the cup of water (I also use coffee instead of water for a great mocha cake) over all this and then mix. Put in an ungreased pan and bake. Excellent, tasty and EASY cake!! Great with ice cream.

I was very excited to find such a quick and easy cake recipe. As a cake addict, this satisfies the urge for cake quickly and simply. It was also very good with some strawberries cut up and added to the batter before baking.

Simply the best easy chocolate cake recipe ever. This recipe has been in my family for years -- the recipe card says it originated in the 60s. We no longer bother with making the holes in the dry ingredients, etc., we just mix the dry ingred in the bowl then add the wet and stir. I double this recipe and bake in a bundt pan (bake at 350 for 35-45 min). I could only give this recipe 3 stars because it's missing the most important element -- the fudge frosting that is cooked on the stovetop and then poured over top. I'm making this cake with my 7-yr-old daughter today for my birthday -- we can't wait. YUM!)

I saw this recipe in the March 2004 BA issue and have made it several times since. It is so simple that I serve it for week-night desserts with some whipped creme nearly once a week. Can't pass up the easy-- one pan!

I've seen this recipe in at least three other cookbooks besides the one reviewed here. It's one I've made many times, and the cake is dense, rich, and not too sweet--I haven't noticed any lack of flavor. The ingredients can be doubled for a 9x13 pan (the oil comes out to 2/3 cup). The pan doesn't have to be greased. I usually use a spatula for stirring, mix the sugar with the rest of the dry ingredients, and bake at 350F.
