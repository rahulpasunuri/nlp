I made this for Easter dinner using the colored eggs. It's a nice presentation, and though some reviewers poo-pooed it for being "only egg salad" people like egg salad.

High marks for the presentation - good idea for many fillings. But this is egg salad, folks.

This is so simple, and a true crowd pleaser.

This was a big hit at a cocktail party. Everyone wanted the recipe.

This is a good basic recipe. Rather than sprinkling with paprika as the Chef did on the show, I sauteed the shrimp in a little butter and curry powder and it added a real flavor bite to the appetizer. I took the advise from another reviewer and added chopped shallots and instead of using mayo and dijon mustard, I used Durkee's. I always use Durkee's for some extra zip. The presentation of this appetizer is beautiful. Thanks! I really love the show as well, as does my 5 year old son!

Well, I tried this for the second time using the sieve for the egg as I said I would and kicked it up with some red pepper and shallots. I was still a little disappointed-it wasn't outstanding. Its a great presentation and black caviar was a nice garnish, but I think its time to move on. Only half of my guests raved about it.
