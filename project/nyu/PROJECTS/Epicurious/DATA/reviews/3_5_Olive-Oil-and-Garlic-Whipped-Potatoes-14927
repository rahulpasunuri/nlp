Unfortunately, I just didn't care for these. I followed the recipe, and liked the idea of these ingredients together, but the oil flavor was just not right in the dish.

Truly exceptional! I followed directions exactly, as far as steps to recipe, ingredient amounts etc but made it easier by just roasting whole head of garlic and squeezing entire contents in to the potatoes. Absolutely delicious with raves from all who tried them. Freshly ground nutmeg is essential as there are so few ingredients. Use best quality olive oil for the same reason as the taste of it will be very evident.

We loved these potatoes, as a great variation on the "butter" flavor I usually make. We had 5 lbs of potatoes instead of 3 lbs, so we used all of them. I used the same proportions for the olive oil, and increased the milk for the extra potatoes. They came out perfectly, so I wonder if the original recipe would have been too heavy on the olive oil...3/4 cup is quite a bit. Great potatoes; would make them for a special occasion but not for a regular dinner - peeling the potatoes is already time consuming; roasting the garlic was essential for this recipe, but makes them too high maintenance unless I have someone helping me cook.

lovely side dish! leaving the skins on, and using the electric beaters sent it over the top!

Perhaps the best mashed potato recipe ever. I've been making these since the recipe was originally published in 1998, and can't even count the number of times I've been asked for the recipe. Don't bother with the final 1/4 c. of olive oil for drizzling, it's unnecessary.
