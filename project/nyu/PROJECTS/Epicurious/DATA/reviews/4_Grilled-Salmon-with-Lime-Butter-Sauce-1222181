Simple & Spectacular! I served this with black rice & stir-fried veggies! My husband said it was the best Salmon I've ever made...I've tried many. Will make it a regular! I think it could work over Seared Scallops or Halibut. Loved the simplicity & complex flavor.

Wow. Truly delicious and so easy. So happy with this recipe. Will make it again many times over. I did two sides which were nice complements - roasted sweet potato and black bean salad, and quinoa with corn, scallion and mint (links below). My husband's a chef and called this one of my best meals ever. The next night we were thrilled to have extra lime butter sauce - we put it on pork and rice and it was delicious! Would be great on chicken, other kinds of fish, beef - you just can't go wrong with lime and butter!

This was fantastic. I served it with this: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Spaghetti-with-Olive-and-Pine-Nut-Salsa-236966 and two vegetable side dishes: cauliflower and broccoli au gratin. My mother and husband were raving about the food, and I myself enjoyed it immensely. I grilled it on a ridged pan on the stove, but even though I did not go over the recommended time the fish became very flaky and was falling apart... that didn't stop it from being delicious though.

I've been making salmon once a week for years and this was hands down the best salmon I've ever made! I modified the lime butter sauce a bit: used 1/2 the butter, added olive oil and a little cilantro. It was absolutely amazing...perfect for the salmon and roasted asparagus! I've never seen my husband eat salmon so fast!!

Cooked this last night and even my wife (who normally doesn't enjoy fish) loved it. For the salmon 4min on each side plus a rest is all it needed. We also used sweet yellow lime and a nice olive oil instead of butter for the sauce and it was very delicious. The Salmon was served on a bed of Fettuccine, julienne of ham and capsicum that had been seared off in a hot non-stick pan.

We just tried this recipe and LOVED IT!! I seasoned the (skinless) salmon piece with lemon/pepper salt/seasoning before grilling. I also added smoked paprika to the FABULOUS sauce recipe. I could have eaten another piece! Awesome!

Incredibly easy to make and even more delicious. My 17 year old daughter would have this every day for dinner if she had her way. The lime butter is also great over veggies and on potatoes. Yummmm!

Easy & fast & yummy. I broiled the salmon & it was great with the sauce. Don't skimp on the salt or omit it - you should salt & pepper the salmon too. Using the blender is key so that it emulsifies - it's creamy & looks nice on the plate. Just melting it with the lime juice will result in a greasy-looking sauce.

Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum! The first time I made this I used lemon juice and dill but missed the step in the butter sauce where you add it slowly so the sauce didn't look nice but it was delicious.

Delicious! I didn't cook these on the BBQ because I don't like to operate it, so cooked these in a grill pan on the stove. I cooked the fillets 4 minutes a side and they turned out perfectly.

Me and my boyfriend were looking for the perfect anniversary meal to cook at our apartment since we're college kids on a budget, we didn't want to go out. So to save money, and to eat healthy, we opted for this recipe. This was fantastic! I added a little more seasoning to the salmon other than salt and pepper (I added a little Steak Montreal seasoning and Garlic and Onion seasoning, both by McCormick, and it was amazing. And the lime butter sauce complemented the fish so well, I drowned my salmon in it, lol. Very good, very inexpensive, and a bonus-ITS HEALTHY!

This is an absolutely perfect recipe - we use cedar planks (williams sonoma) instead of directly on grill, which will prevent the sticking problem - the lime butter is fabulous.

We started by drizzling it on our salmon, then proceeded to drizzle on the peas and biscuits we were having with the salmon. Absolutely delicious. I did not use the lime zest on the salmon - that is the only change I made. You will not be sorry when you try this recipe! Enjoy!

this recipe was quick and easy - perfect for a weeknight. i tasted the lime butter and thought it might be too salty/sour for my 4yo and almost 2yo, but it was the perfect blend once spooned over the fish. it's hard for me to get my little ones to eat salmon because of the fishiness, so the fact that they ate it all makes it a winner in my book.

I was looking for a slightly different variation on my butter-with-lemon slices-salmon that I have often. This recipe was better and easier than I had expected. I had some Mexican limes from my uncle's tree and they tasted great in this recipe. I usually make my salmon in the oven due to the messiness of the butter but this was tons easier. Especially the clean up since my grill pan is non-stick. I will definitely make this again.

This was the first I had even cooked salmon, and it turned out amazing! I don't have a grill, so I seared and cooked it in a pan with EVOO. The seasonings and sauce are very simple and economical. I made this for my boyfriend's birthday and now he wants it to be a weekly dinner dish! Definitely making it again!

I would say 31/2 forks for this one. I made some changes...put the fish on foil, skin side down. Also, didn't melt the butter down, but had it softened. 2 minutes before taking the filet off the BBQ, I put the softened butter on then topped with a good amount of parmesan and put the lid down to make a crust. Boyfriend loved it that night, and used the leftovers in a pesto pasta the next day. Very good!

Rating: 4
With a well cooked filet, this is just perfect! I actually used the Sharp SuperSteam to cook 3 filets (with steam!) that were done to perfection. I made the lime butter, which couldn't be easier. I put just a heaping teaspoon on each filet and that was more than enough. The flavor combination is sublime. When making this again, I am going to halve the lime butter recipe, as I had a lot left over. You don't need to drown the filets and I'd say that this is easily enough to service 8-10 .5lb filets. Fast, easy and very, very tasty.

Rating: 4
I did this in the oven at 415 and it turned out perfectly. The lime butter was fantastic, definately restaurant quailty. I'm going to keep this as a favorite. I imagine the lime butter would be great on a mild white fish too (talipia). mmm mmm good.

I thought the lime butter was excellent and also the sprinkle of lime zest on the salmon.

This simple dish is possibly the best salmon I've ever had. We used Copper River salmon, which costs a fortune here in New England, but was well worth it. The sauce is sublime, like a beurre blanc but without all that stirring. I did add a little zest to the sauce to increase the lime flavor and it was perfect. This will be our "go to" summer salmon recipe from now on.

This sounded so simple I couldn't imagine there would be much to it. But it was really delicious. I love recipes that are company good with so few ingredients.

This is a straightforward recipe that is perfect for high quality seafood. The Lime Butter sauce is complementary and does not overpower the fish.

This is such a simple recipe, and yet it yeilds excellent results. The key to any good seafood dish is to keep it simple- and this is perfect. The lime butter sauce is so easy to make, and the essential oils in the lime zest when sprinkled over the salmon really enhance the flavor of the dish. The lime butter sauce is quite versatile and would be great over scallops, shrimp or chicken, and would be just as good if made with lemon or pink grapefruit.

My fiance didn't like it as much (he said he wasn't a fan of the lime-y flavour) although, admittedly, I think I went a little heavy on the lime zest (in error).

Looking to reduce the calories I changed the lime-butter sauce, into more of a dressing. I doubled the lime juice and 1/2'd the butter. The sauce was a bit runny, but I served the grilled salmon on a bed of field greens (and some chives from my garden) which I tossed with some of my altered lime butter sauce and a dash of white wine vinegar. I topped with more sauce and the lime zest (next time I'll spinkle even more lime zest) Yummmy!!! and lite.

Overall, this seems to be turning into and east coast vs. west coast lime sauce debate. Haven't we learned anything from the rap/hip hop whippersnappers?

All this bickering in one day?? The lime butter sauce link is easy, as is the lime butter sauce. Made it in five minutes, went great on salmon, corn, and fresh pasta Wicked easy, wicked good. I'll be making this a lot.

I would like to see more reviews of the actual dish than all these explanations of how to clink the link. I think one would have been sufficient. Has anyone actually made this dish yet? I will as the Lime Butter Sauce sounds like it will be delicious over the salmon.
