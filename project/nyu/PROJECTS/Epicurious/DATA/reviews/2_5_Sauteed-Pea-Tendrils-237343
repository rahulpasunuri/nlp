Good, but not spectacular. I felt like the pea shoots seemed a bit overly oily, and the flavours from the oil, butter, and garlic were extremely subtle.

I hadn't prepared pea shoots before and this recipe was an easy entry point: simple and tasty! I didn't measure my ingredients, but I think that I used a bit more garlic relative to the rest than the recipe called for. I didn't discard it either; I thought it made the dish a bit better to have the soft cloves strewn among the pea shoots.
