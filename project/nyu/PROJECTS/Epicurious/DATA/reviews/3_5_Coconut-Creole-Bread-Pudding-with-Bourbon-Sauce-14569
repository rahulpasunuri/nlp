This was fantastic, plain and simple. Everyone at the table loved it. I loved it. I'm guessing that those who are complaining that it was too mushy did not dry their bread enough. I also left it in the oven quite a bit longer than the directions specified -- I just wasn't satisfied with the way it looked and probably left it in there close to an hour. The bourbon sauce was not at all cloying or too strong. It was ambrosial. I did use a very good quality bourbon so maybe that helped. Honestly, this is one of the best dessert recipes I have come across in some time, and I am not particularly a fan of bread puddings as a rule. This is a definite keeper!

This was cloyingly sweet in a bad way. It looked amazing but I dumped it all after dinner. Is the trick to successful bread puddings to have bread that's super dry? I had a texture issue with the pudding part of this dessert when cooked and it was one mush in my mouth. No thanks.

This was a really good bread pudding, except the bourbon was a little strong, I'll use a good spiced rum in the sauce next time

Served for my Cooking Club friends at our Mardi Gras themed brunch. As one other rater has said it is deceptively light considering all of the milk and cream used. I made up the pudding the night before, added just a bit of cream in the morning to further soften things up, and cooked the pudding before leaving my house. We served at room temp with the sauce on the side. The sauce doesn't add much, in my opinion, and the pudding is very tasty all on its own. Not the most interesting thing I've ever made but very good...for to die for bread pudding see the white and dark chocolate with bailey's sauce on this site...that is my St. Pats Day standard.

For a large crowd at our New Year's Eve party that was a salute to New Orleans, I quadrupled this recipe. I also baked my own challah to use instead of the baquette. It definitely needed to be made a day ahead. I served it at room temperature with the warm sauce. It was a great hit. I will certainly make this again.

this was yummy! I served it with the Luisiana Jambalaya also from this site. Definitely prepare the bread the night before because cutting of the crusts is time consuming. I used two long baguettes to get the recommended 3 cups. I think it is extra yummy if served warm. The bourbon sauce was delicious too. I'm considering adding golden raisins next time.

Served this dessert for a Mardi Gras party and everyone inhaled it. We left out the coconut and noone missed it. I will definately make this again and again

I used candied walnuts instead of the pecans and it was excellent. Also, I spread the coconut on top instead of dallops and it was great.

I have made this recipe several times and each time, I am pleased with it. My family and friends constantly beg me to make it. I use various types of bread to make this and once, I used cinnamon rolls. The sauce is ok - personally, the pudding does not need it.

This just didn't do it for us. I've made this twice now (with a total of twelve tasters), and both times I recieved complaints that the bourbon sauce was too strong (and some of these folks REALLY like booze...), and that the pudding itself wasn't very "pudding-ish". In fact, it was relatively dry. At any rate, I'm not giving up. I'm going to combine this recipe with another bread pudding recipe with hopes of improving it. Wish me luck!

I have never liked bread pudding, but this one is great! I think drying the bread made the difference. A hint: after decrusting and slicing bread, I tore the slices and saved a lot of time. The sauce is something else also. This was served to a bread pudding lover and another who doesn't eat bread pudding and both gave it two thumbs up.

This bread pudding was delicious. Being from south Louisiana, I can tell you I've had many bread puddings, but this one reminds me of my grandmother's.

DECEPTIVELY LIGHT......JUST DON'T THINK ABOUT ALL OF THE CREAM USED IN THIS RECIPE. IT WAS A HIT AT OUR DINNER CLUB. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
