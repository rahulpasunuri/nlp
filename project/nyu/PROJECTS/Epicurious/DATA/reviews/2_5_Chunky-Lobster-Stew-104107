Forget this lobster stew, it is as much like lobster stew as NY clam chowder is like the New England version. Lobster Stew is lobster, its broth, butter, cream and a dash of sherry. S&P to taste, and definitely white pepper. Any other additions are blasphemy. The tomalley croutons, however, are worth doing!

Classic lobster stew- the question for most cooks is if your willing to go through the labor intensive process of dissecting multiple lobster. For most amateur cooks, this is a time consuming and messy process. The second issue for any lobster recipe is if the subtle taste of lobster is overcome in the recipe. I recommend a little less leek for this reason.

I'm not wild about tomatoes and lobster together either, but liked the idea of the tomalley croutons. I was surprised at the instruction to "be sure to remove the intestinal tract from the tail" of the lobster without mentioning removing the stomach sac from behind the eyes. Here, we call this "the old woman" because, if you really use your imagination, the bit of cartilage resembles a female figure in a rocking chair. It's the only part of the lobster other than the shell that truly is inedible. Also there's no mention of the lovely coral (or roe, if you have female lobsters). Don't discard it. It's delicious and adds not only flavour, but also colour to a lobster stew or bisque.

Was glad I read the reviews from the New England cooks before making this as my contribution to a hugh Thanksgiving gathering of my husband's relatives (all from Maine to Mass). I will do somthing else, but I wonder why cooks who don't think lobster & tomatoes go together would make it in the first place.

I have had tomato (in part of a sauce) with lobster over pasta, and that seems to work!

I found this receipe to be overly involved for the result. I thought the tomato comments in the other reviews to be overblown, they don't add or detract that much and could easily be removed. It was a tasty dish dish overall.

People keep giving me Jasper White cookbooks, PLEASE STOP! As usual he shoots himself in the foot in making a wonderful New England standard despicable. Tomatoes and lobster do not go together. End of story.

The problem with this for me is that I do not like tomatoes with lobster. Lobster should have creamy, smooth, buttery soup sauce to play in. I like very subtle herbs and nothing to take away at all from the lobster. But, it is just a personal opinion and I am sure it is great for some.
