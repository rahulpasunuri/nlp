This was truly a wonderful recipe but I added too much of the blue and it was way to rich. Next time I will stick with the recipe. I did add bacon bits which I really liked :)

Since I was doubling my recipe and using potatoes out of a 10 lb. bag and had no idea of the weight of each potato ( a bit on the small side ) it was tough to gauge the exact total weight of potatoes I was using. Suffice it to say that I used the entire container of sour cream as I thought the mashed potatoes were on the dry side. I substituted roquefort for gorgonzola cheese per a recommendation from a friend. Next time I also will sparingly apply the parmesan cheese on top of the potatoes as I went a little overboard. The final product was a creamy delicious potato. These were small so one didn't feel obligated to have to finish a big one if I had made them larger. This is a nice change instead of mashed potatoes or regular baked potatoes. *** 3 1/2 stars *** .

I thought this was good but I think I might try other recipes before making this again. I made this for two but cut the amount of cheese, sour cream, parmesan and in half and I still found the flavors a tad bland or muddled. The added green onions to the parsley was the most interesting dimension. This was good - don't get me wrong - it just fell short of expectations based on all of the positive reviews. Not sure I would make this again...but maybe with some changes.

Really tasty potatoes. I added more sour cream than the recipe said and used gorgonzola. I'm thinking chives would be good, too, and will add them next time, because there will surely be a next time!

These are delicious. I wondered about substituting blue cheese for roquefort because the blue cheese was lots cheaper. Glad I decided against that - the roquefort is much creamier than blue and definitely added to the character of the combination. I would add a bit more "liquid" in the final product as it seemed a bit too dry - perhaps a bit more sour cream or even butter might have done it. Definitely making this again with Prime Rib for Christmas.

Wow -- these were really, really delicious. They have a fair amount of good ol' baked potato character, unlike most twice-baked potatoes which seem like vehicles for cheese dip and not much else. FYI, you don't have to do the whole hour and 15 in the oven -- I find 6-8 minutes in the microwave and then 8-10 in the oven does fine. And it helps to wrap them in foil before you scoop them out, so the skins don't tear.

The potatoes tasted great but the skins got very hard and dry. Also, I let the potatoes cool too much before adding the cheese and sour cream, so they didn't blend very well. Next time I will know better.

Very good potatoes. I added fresh, chopped chives and would suggest maybe a tad more blue cheese. For a little more "umph", try the "Double-baked potatoes w/ mushrooms & cheese" on this site.

I made this as a side dish for the Beef Wellingtons with gorgonzola, and it was a great combination. I've done several other double-baked potato recipes, and this is the best one I've tried--all the others now seem so bland compared with this one. Creamy and rich with just a little sharpness, this is a great side dish for either a simple dinner or a special occasion (though for the latter it might be dressed up by piping the mix through a pastry bag). Wonderful and simple!

Wonderful! Perfect for special company fare, but certainly easy enough for a nice dinner for the family. Everyone loves them.

Great flavor - a nice twist on twice baked potatoes. Guests requested the recipe. I made them two days ahead and they turned out great.

These are amazing! My hubby & friends loved it. I made this recipe twice in one weekend as guests requested it! An easy to make, impressive dish. Also good for entertaining as you can make them up to the last step ahead of time.

Made this with gorgonzola cheese - was absolutely delicious! Served it with steak and a tomato salad - a great transitional season dish, we'll be munching on these throughout the fall, and I'll be putting them on the table with a spice-rubbed pork loin for CHristmas dinner, too. Didn't have the time to bake the potatoes, so microwaved them - no difference that I could see, except maybe the skins were not as crunchy as they would have been oven-baked.

These are excellent. I took them to a father's day cookout. they were a hit. ( i'm a little late on reviewing - oops ) I made them the day before and just popped them into their oven. they looked and tasted very impressive. they were the first things gone from the buffet... could have used some more !!

Very simple but impressive. Even the children loved them.

My fiancee and I couldn't stop exclaiming about how good these were! I used Stella blue cheese instead of Roquefort and they were unforgettable.

These are very good--served them with filet mignon in a merlot sauce. Nice combination.

We had this, along with your Prime Rib Au Poivre, last Christmas for dinner. We all loved it and are planning to make it again. I had lost the recipe when my computer crashed and when I found my book it seemed the page with the recipe had been torn out and apparently disposed of. Thank you for having this page so I could retrieve it. I fix a recipe every month from your magazine. Last month Choucroute Garni for Gourmet Club and this month (Sunday) the Orange Cake with Cranberries from Nov. issue.

For blue-cheese lovers. I made it with rack of lamb and a nice Bordeaux. My brother-in-law ate three and could of ate more.

These went perfectly with prime rib and a strong cabernet! They were a big wit at our wine tasting dinner party. It's great to be able to prepare them ahead and just heat and serve.
