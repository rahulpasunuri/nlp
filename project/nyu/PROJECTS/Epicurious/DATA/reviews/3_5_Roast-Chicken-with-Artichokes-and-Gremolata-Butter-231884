P.S. To accompany this, I made Weird Potato Salad: sour cream-mayo dressing, celery, cucumbers, scallion, red potatoes, tarragon, black pepper. It was a really good foil to the artichokes and chicken.

I made this for my parents and it was a huge hit. I used canned artichoke hearts and put them in at the beginning of the cooking time along with a half cup of pearl onions. I basted once after 20 minutes, and again after another 20...and then added two cups of quartered criminis and another quarter cup of chopped parsley. I let the entire ensemble cook together another half hour, and it was luscious. If you have company coming over, get another can of artichoke hearts and cook a second bird, as this is worth hoarding an entire bird for one's self. *slurp*

This recipe is a real find. Yummy to the max. We followed the recipe exactly. The chickens (we made 2) were moist as can be and the artichokes were caramelized to perfection. I wouldn't make this on a weekday due to the prep time. It's great for a dinner party. We served it with couscous - I mixed toasted pine nuts into couscous made with chicken stock. I can't wait to make this for my book club.

Forget 4 forks, can I give it 5 forks? My kids inhaled it, artichokes and all! I baked at 425 degrees the entire time, but my bird hadn't cooked through. Perhaps it's because I stuffed several leftover Italian parsley sprigs and 2 lemon halves inside cavity. I added 15 extra minutes to the 2nd phase of baking. The meat was still moist. I'm concerned the bird would dry-out if I used the "roast" setting on the convection oven. Thumbs up for canned artichokes & be sure to baste them when you baste the bird.

I skipped the artichokes, but this chicken is outstanding!!! Just the right flavors and so moist. I followed other reviewers' advice and turned down the temp.... I did a 7 lb chicken at 425 for first 45 mins and then 45 mins at 375. PERFECT!

I made this recipe one day; I had a bird and some free time. It was incredible. My girlfriend and I ate everything, and I mean everything. We have made it a few times since, and I even made it for my parents. We all loved it. I highly recommend.

Delicious and simple. I used canned artichoke hearts because I had them on hand and they worked well. I wouldn't make any ingredient changes - it's very good the way it is. The chicken was very moist and flavorful. I reduced the cooking temperature to 375 after the first 45 minutes.

Great Taste. I agree with others about the start temp then reduce to 375. Very moist. I increased the butter and herb mix a little.

Good, but definitely not on such a high heat as others noted & was not in love with the frozen artichokes

Things I changed: 375 for 1:20 Things I will change next time: More butter, garlic and spices, Stuff chicken with something, Wrap chicken for first 30 minutes, Serve with a better side dish (Spanish Rice is what I served with)

Simple. Delicious. Moist chicken with great flavors. I wouldn't use garlic pepper or try to "doctor" this recipe in any way. Sometimes it's nice just to taste chicken with a simple herb flavoring.

Great and really easy. Started with the high heat setting but reduced to 375 after 30 minutes. Using this method, add the artichokes a little earlier. Use plenty of salt and substitute garlic pepper for black pepper.

Like the cook from Miami, I would also not roast at such a high temperature for so long. I roasted it a high temperature initially to brown the chicken & seal in the juices, then I reduced the oven temperature and the chicken came out tender & moist. I would also use more gremolata butter next time so that the flavorings reached all parts of the chicken. I disagree about the artichokes -- I loved them! I used canned, quartered chokes instead of frozen, however.

This recipe was good for as easy as it was,but I would make a couple of changes. I didnt cook on such high heat, I choose to cook mine at 375 degrees for about 30 min. longer and I added extra butter and garlic. The only thing I did'nt like about this recipe were the artichokes, and I LOVE artichokes. I would leave them out next time. The seasoned chicken alone makes an easy and inexpensive main entree, but it is nothing special.
