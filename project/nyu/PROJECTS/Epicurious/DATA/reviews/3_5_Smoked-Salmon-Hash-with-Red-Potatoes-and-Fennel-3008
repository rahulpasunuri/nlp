Well received at Christmas brunch. I doubled the smoked salmon to 12 ounces, and used 4 ounces each of the tarragon, dill and parsley. I agree with the previous reviewer who said the potatoes pieces were too big...I cut them much smaller.

I had to change a few things, using what I had on hand, but it was very good. I used lox, not smoked, and really wished I had used a smoked salmon, which would have stood out more. Definitely cut the potatoes smaller- looks more like a hash, and they cook faster too. s

In an effort to reduce cholesterol and satisfy non-meat eaters, I substituted olive oil for the bacon dripings. The result, made with top quality cold smoked salmon, was excellent. Everyone wanted the recipe.

I made this dish for Christmas brunch and simply felt that okay, but not great. My guests felt the same. The potato piece were too big. I think that the small red potatos cut in eighths would have been tastier and I too felt that the salmon was lost - perhaps a piece of fresh poached salmon topped by the fennel, onions, etc. (no potatos) would be an interesting adjustment.

Good, but unfortunately i think the salmon got lost in this dish. Made it as part of a Christmas brunch. It got compliments but didn't seem to be the dish of choice.

We always have a large out-of-town gathering at our house for Thanksgiving. This is the favorite breakfast dish we serve our guest every year. It is loved by all and the one recipe every asks for a copy. Pretty easy to make, especially if you have bacon grease already set aside.

I made this for my family on Christmas morning and everyone raved about it. Pretty quick and easy too. The roasted potatoes were the real winning part. The fennel flavor was delicate, but a wonderful combination with the smoked salmon
