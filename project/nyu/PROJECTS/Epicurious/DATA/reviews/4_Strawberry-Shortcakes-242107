I'm adding this review because I used room temperature sour cream instead of cream cheese. This works so well I will continue to do so. This sugar glazed cake is fabulous - even when baked in the mountains where I've had my share of baking issues.

this was a fantastic cake dressed up with strawberries (freshly picked from a local farm, i left them unadulterated). moist and fluffy, but just a tad too sweet for me. i doubled the recipe, and substituted all purpose flour (replacing two tablespoons per cup of flour with cornstarch as recommended from other sites). this is a keeper - i'll probably use it as my go-to white cake recipe!

Love, love, love it! The cake alone is delicious and the full recipe is amazing! Friends and family still remembers it as the best they've ever ate. One day I surprised my son & friends... and substitute the Strawberries for a can of Spanish "Guava Paste" (21 Once). For the center I used chunks of the paste mixed with creamy paste (I pureed some with water), and for topping I decorated it with chunks of the paste over whipped cream. Phenomenal! No matter what you do, this recipe is great!

31/2 forks for the cake...awesome! Light, moist, tasty...paired with strawberries soaked in honey and grand marnier. Sorry, did not make the sauce.

I only made the shortcake but I got rave reviews. Everyone said it was the best shortcake they had ever had. It wasn't overly dry like shortcake can be sometimes. Amazing!

Just used the cake recipe. It was wonderful! Will use it again. Simple, moist and delicious!

The cake was outstanding and the sauce made our early season strawberries taste scrumptious! I skipped the whipped cream and substituted greek yoghurt sweetened with powdered sugar and vanilla. Way better than whipped cream (and healthy). My guests raved about this dessert. Yum!

This was yummy. Made it by dividing batter into two 8-inch round pans lined with parchment. I made everything in advance and threw it together at the last minute. Served it up as a whole cake, then sliced to serve. It was beautiful and easy. The cake has a nice crumb-similar to a genoise, but without the fuss, and firm enough to handle the sauce. I've made it with the sauce, then again just with berries sprinkled with sugar and sherry. Both work great, but I would use the sauce if the cake has to sit a while as it is thicker and less likely to make the cake soggy. Then again, this cake never does sit for long, so...

We tried this recipe twice and followed it closely, except we used all purpose flour instead of cake flour. On both occasions they turned out horribly: the cakes began to deflate immediately when removed from the oven; and the results were inedible- thick, gooey consistency. On the second attempt we had left the cake in about 5 mins. longer than recommended because we thought the cause may be under-cooking. (We are not newcomers to cake baking.) Can someone explain what we did wrong? Would elevation make a difference as we live at sea level? Thanks .

This is a truly wonderful shortcake. I used demerra sugar to coat the cake pan and to sprinkle on top of the cake before it went into the oven. I served it with native berries and white chocolate whipped cream. Truly delicious.

Agree completely with the reviewer from Minneapolis (but worry if the lfiske is for lutefisk). This is what shortcake should be. I baked it twice this week, once in a 9 inch pan per original and then in two 8" pans and both came out beautifully golden brown and moist, the perfect foil for fresh sliced strawberries tossed with a bit of sugar a splash of orange liqueur and a dollop of real whipped cream. Summer dessert just doesn't get much better. The only adaptation I made was to line the bottom of the pans with parchment paper to insure good release from the pans. Next time I may try baking in ramekins for a different presentation.

First of all, I am a strawberry shortCAKE type of gal. Don't get me wrong - the biscuit type shortcakes are good, but my all time favorite baked goodness peeking out from under a pool of strawberries is a moist, dense, rich CAKE. That said, this, if you are like me, is THE CAKE for strawberry shortcake. Moist, dense (but tender), gently sweet with a satisfying sugar crunch on the outside thanks to the dusting of sugar in the pan. Oh, and did I mention how cute it looks pulled out of the oven? All shortcakey, pale golden and rustic. Just begging to be taken along on a picnic. Followed the recipe for the cake, but opted for fresh sliced strawberries with a little sugar (to make their own juice) instead of the sauce (I'm more of a purist in that way). The perfect end to any spring/summer dinner. This one goes down in the books!

Great and simple to make... A hit with adults and 5 year olds. I WILL make this again.

This is an excellent recipe. Everyone loved it (from a 3 year old to adults). I divided the batter in half and used two spring form pans. Then I spread the strawberry sauce, topped it with 2/3 of the whipped cream, and placed the second layer of the cake on top. I then spread the remaining whip cream on the top of the cake to give it more of a cake look.

I'm only reviewing the cake, as I just served it with sliced strawberries and fresh whipped cream. The cake, however, was FANTASTIC even without the sauce. Moist, just sweet enough, perfect with the strawberries, and not that hard to make. Will definitely make again.

Agreed - best cake for strawberry shortcake ever! I could do without the sauce though... rather, I quartered fresh strawberries added a little sugar and gave them time to develop their own syrup. Much easier than the sauce in this recipe and I thought it even tasted better that way. Served with fresh whipped cream - perfection!

Hands down the BEST cake recipe ever. I just topped with plain sliced strawberries and whip cream and had people licking the bowl, no joke. The cake is so moist and flavorful - not at all cardboard like like so many shortcake recipes. The cream cheese is the key.

I made this for a large dinner party and it was a huge hit. The strawberry sauce is exceptional, and can make end-of- season, sourish strawberries taste sweet. I made it with traditional shortcakes which was probably more time consuming than this cake recipe. This is a keeper recipe!

This dessert was delicious and so simple to make. I give it 3 forks instead of 4 because I prefer a biscuit to a cake for strawberry shortcake. However the cake was so outstanding - extremely moist and flavorful, but not too rich - that I would make it as a stand-alone cake in addition to serving it with the strawberries. I highly recommend this recipe. Great party dessert!

Absolutely genius! Made it for guests who went nuts for it. Rich, but light and most important, not too sweet.

Awesome! Made is just as written. The only thing I'd change was the sprinkling of sugar on the cake and pan--didn't seem necessary to add more sweetness. I'm planning to use the cake recipe as a staple for other kinds of fruits and sauce. Yumm!!

This was absolutely scrumptious! It was light and the cake was incredibly moist! I didn't even use cake flour; instead, I used a substitution I found from Land O' Lakes. For every 1 cup of cake flour, you can use 1 cup of all- purpose flour, but subtract two tablespoons. I also ran out of vanilla extract, and used some maple syrup instead (more than the amont of extract the recipe demanded). I divided it into little ramekins, and made serving the shortcakes incredibly easy and pretty!

Awesome recipe. The next time I would forgo straining the sauce and add a tad more sugar.

Delicious! Perfect for a summer lunch and really easy to make. I made everything in advance and just quickly assembled before serving.

This was a big hit at dinner last night! The cake was much better than the shortcake biscuits I've made in the past. The cake was delicious on its own. The presentation was beautiful too. Will definitely make again.

The cake is fabulous - firm texture but still light. Recipe easily doubles - brought leftover cake (no strawberries or whipped cream were leftover) to work, my co-workers loved the cake plain. Strawberries were also delicious.

The cake would be good with the rhubarb strawberry mint compote in the same issue.

This was very good. I loved the way the strawberries were prepared. Excellent. The cake was tasty and moist. Secretly I was hoping that I would taste more of the cream cheese, but honestly I did not detect any. Overall it was very good and wonderful at my dinner party.

this was hands down the best shortcake I have ever had. would recomend to everyone. very fast and easy to make.

To call this strawberry shortcake is somewhat of a misnomer. It is more of a sweet cake with a strawberry sauce. Technicalities aside, this was a delicious dessert that the whole family loved. The cake was very easy to make and would be delicious with ANY type of berry sauce. The strawberry sauce was good and imagine would be even better when strawberries are really in season. I thought it needed just a little added punch...maybe some framboise liqueur or something. Definitely a crowd pleaser that I will be making again. My children were BEGGING for some of the leftover cake this morning!
