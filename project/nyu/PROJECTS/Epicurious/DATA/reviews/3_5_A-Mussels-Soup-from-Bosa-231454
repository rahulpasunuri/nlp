Only as I was making this soup did I realize that the only broth involved is wine. The soup has strong (bold?) flavors. The bread on the bottom is key. I put more grated cheese on top of the bread before pouring the soup over. Couldn't find pecorino, used freshly grated parmesan, a bit more than called for, and it was fine. Put the wine in before the grated cheese to avoid the cheese sticking to the mussels. I would be tempted next time to serve this not as a soup but over pasta in a shallow bowl. It's good; try it.

I was hesitant to make this for some reason-But I am really glad I did. It was delicious! The SanMarzano tomatoes are a bit pricey but worth it. Follow the directions and be sure to buy good cheese. The bread at the bottom of the bowl seemed strange - but tasted great! Everyone loved it!

At firs, we were skeptics, but lost all our fears. Pecorino makes the difference.

yum! a tasty change to my usual way of preparing mussels. The cheese was a nice touch but I found a lot of it stuck to the shells, so i'll probably grate it more finely next time
