Really, really not good. I don't know what I was thinking. I guess the idea of the reduced sherry seduced me.

A fairly plain recipe. It would be a nice dish alongside something bold. I would suggest the addition of toasted nuts and maybe something sweet such as orange juice, maple syrup, or a little sugar.
