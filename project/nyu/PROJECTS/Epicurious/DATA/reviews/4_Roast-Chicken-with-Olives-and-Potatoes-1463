This is easy - 30 minutes prep time if you move quickly - and very good. I recommend a salad or something else with some tang to offset the oil/density of the rest of the meal. Also, next time i will cut the potatoes a bit larger...they ended up too soft. overall, very nice and easy.

I had never made roast chicken before (hard to believe, I know!) and decided to start with this recipe - actually I combined this recipe with another one (which I customarily do) "Roast Chicken with Spicy Herbed Olivada" Bon Appetit, March 2003 (also found on Epicurious) and it turned out amazing! My husband loved it and I will definitely make it again. It was easy to make (although, a little time consuming to prepare - but maybe it's just me). Also, I used a pre-made olive paste to save time and it turned out perfectly. I served it with sauted asparagus.

I hate to be the one to say I won't make it again . . . but really, what a waste of wonderful tapenade. The potatoes and olives were divine, but go with the old standby lemons/rosemary/garlic in the cavity of the chicken and combine it with the potatoes and olives at table. Much better and far less oily.

Wonderful and easy way to prepare chicken. My dinner guests loved it. My friend called it resturant quality. YUM. I made a sauce with a rue and white wine. I couldn't find olive paste so I made my own by pureeing Kalamata olives with a little olive oil

I have made this dish several times over the past few months. I love it and so do my guests. I would suggest being prepared to cook the chicken a little longer than described and allow at least 15 minutes for the meat to set before serving. Olives with chicken may seem strange to some American palates, but I have tried it with both the kalamata olives and with green olives, with and without pimento. I have also used a mixture of the black and green brined olives. It has been delicious every time. As for the olivado, I found an online recipe and made my own because there was no readily available local source. I usually add extra olives and potatoes so that I have enough for leftovers. Unfortunately, when there are guests, there are no leftovers from this dish.

The Potatoes & olives were delicious, the chicken was just ok, a little bland. My husband asked for bbq sauce or something to flavor it. I'm going to make it once more, just to see if it's a keeper.

Great easy recipe. The chicken was tasty and flavorful! I would definitely make this again. It needed to cook more than the time indicated in the recipe.

I used chicken parts, instead of a whole chicken. Something about the olive paste made the chicken succulent and tender and perfect. A huge hit.

We eat roast chicken regularly and I'm always trying new variations on favorite themes. The combinations in this recipe are delicious. The potatoes were exceptional; not light on calories, but fabulous flavor! I added garlic cloves and a whole lemon sliced to the cavity. Will make this one a staple in my recipe file.

Even my father-in-law, who hates olives, devoured two helpings.

This was a very simple and easy recipe. I used a smaller chicken and added thyme sprigs inside the cavity of the chicken. I made an olive paste with a can of olives, a dash of olive oil and a clove of garlic. Very flavourful.

Great dish! Try it, it's hard to wreck. I added garlic in the cavity and shallots with the potato's.

This is a wonderful dish - easy to prepare and beautiful to serve. It has become a staple in our house - I bet we make this at least once every two weeks during the fall and the winter. I add more garlic cloves and more olives than the recipe calls for, and it has turned out great every time!

This dish was excellent. I took it one step further and roasted the bird with 10 whole shallots. Once they began to carmelize they were wonderful with the potatoes and olives.

My husband, a self-proclaimed connisseur of potatoes, said these were the best he'd ever eaten. Of course, you could die young if you ate too many of them.

I've made hundreds of roasted chickens, but this one was absolutely superb. I served it at a dinner part last night and one guest wanted to take some of his chicken home in a doggie bag! I also appreciated the low "hassel factor" of the recipe. While the chicken was roasting, I had time to put together the hors'doeuvres and whip up a green salad! Delicious!

I agree with everyone below. Absolutely outstanding! I'll definitely make it again.

This recipe was the best roast chicken I have ever tasted. I made it with a 3 1/2 pound chicken and had to adjust the cooking time accordingly. The chicken picks up the flavour of the kalamata olives. Adding olives in the last fifteen minutes of cooking really makes for a pleasant alternative to plain roasted potatoes! Just where in the world do you people get such big birds is what I want to know!

This was the first roast chicken I've ever made and it was perfect! I used two small roasting chickens and had leftovers.

Easy to make--delightful to eat--I did not use potatoes as described--used roast potatoes with thyme and Kosher salt--great.

My very favorite roast chicken recipe of all time!!! This is the best. Have served it countless times to guests--always with rave reviews. The potatoes that go with it are phenomenal. The recipe is extremely easy to make. I serve w/green beans or asparagus. Salad that goes with it in the menu is also outstanding!!!
