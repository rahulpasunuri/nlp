I made this 14 years ago & evidently wasn't impressed. I stumbled on it again when I wasn't in the mood to make dinner but had the ingredients last night. I've made grilled chicken with rosemary, olive oil, & squished garlic glopped on it on the grill pan forever and it's delicious. The "sauce" which is more like a topping, tastes great without having any contact with the chicken so they can be prepared simultaneously. Not sure this is making sense but you can marinate the chicken (I like boneless skinless thighs)in the rosemary, olive oil, and garlic and prep everything in advance and then make dinner in 15 mintes with house guests staring at you while you cook!!! Also you can add capers and a chiffonade of fresh basil or whatever you're in the mood for. I just realized that the recipe doesn't specify what color the peppers are but I would only use orange, red, or yellow in that order. Green bell peppers would be yucky in this recipe. I used the full 3 Tbsp of rosemary even though the recipe has an error we love the flavor of it and my husband went crazy on this recipe.

Delicious. I picked this recipe at random because I had some rosemary to use and someone at home who doesn't eat lamb...we both loved the sweetness/salt of the peppers and olives.

Quick & easy. Almost no way to screw this up. I added more garlic, extra virgin olive oil, white wine & more balsamic vinegar but still didn't get too much sauce. My husband loved this dish. For me it was just good.

Oops! OK, I've ruined my credibility completely. But I meant green Spanish olives, not greed Spanish onions. sorry!

I'm sorry to do this because I tend to roll my eyes when others do... but with the following SIMPLE ALTERATIONS to the above recipe, this becomes a simply sublime entree...unbelievable given how easy it is. First, substitute large greed Spanish onions for the Kalamata. MUCH better. Second, make sure you use a pan which will form a fond when you cook the chicken. Get the chicken nice and brown on both sides, and get a good fond in the pan. Then, before you add the red peppers, deglaze the fond with white wine (I use soave)and saute the peppers in this until the wine has evaporated and the peppers are browning. Then continue the recipe as written. I guarantee it'll bowl you over this way!

I followed the recipe, with detail...but didn't love it. Perhaps, I prefer more plain foods, but it seemed to have too much going on. Sure, the rosemary & the chicken were good complements...but the sauce was just a bit too strong for my fiance & me.

I thought this dish was especially great given how quick and easy it is to prepare. I personally would like more sauce next time so I will double the recipe. Really excellent flavor.

The sauce made this dish delicious and the recipe made just the right amount. The black olives gave the dish an exotic, unique flavor. We served over lemon/rosemary orzo. Very nice for our Sunday family meal.

This is a terrific summer-y dish. The lemon orzo is fantastic. I plan to use pre-pitted olives next time though.

Perfectly fine, but not very interesting.

This was great! I actually followed the recipe to the letter. Served it with baby green salad & lemon vinaigrette as suggested, also rosemary/lemon orzo and grilled bread with goat cheese, arugula, and olives (all recipes on this site). Honeydew for dessert. I will definitely make this again.

This was very easy and tasty. The olives were a wonderful compliment. We followed the suggestion and used red and green peppers, and served it with saffron rice.

Great recipe - smells delicious while you're making it and tastes delicious once made. Don't forget to make rice to accompany it, and I absolutely agree with one of the other cooks that you should use red, green, and yellow peppers (some of each).

I really enjoyed this recipe. My fiance liked it too and he can be a bit picky. I used dried rosemary and ground it up in my mortar. Came out great!!!

This was a great dish and very easy for my inexperience hands. I used the 3 teaspoons called for the text of the recipe and it was wonderful. Great with garlic mashed potatoes.

Always wonder what to do with chicken breasts after I defrost them. Today I tried this recipe and we all loved it. I like to prepare meals early in the day and then reheat. This worked out well. I used 3 whole chicken breasts halved, fresh rosemary and lemon pepper to freshen the flavor. Added about 3 T Rhine wine to deglaze the pan and allow the dish to be better reheated later. Also used a sweet Texas onion, sliced lengthwise instead of the peppers. The aroma was wonderful, the flavor tasty and a real hit with all.
