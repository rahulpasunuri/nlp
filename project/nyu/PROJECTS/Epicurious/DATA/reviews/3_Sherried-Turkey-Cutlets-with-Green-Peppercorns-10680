gave this 4 forks for flavor and ease.I wrapped the cutlets in proscutto and then floured.I heated the sherry and peppercorns as directed and added softened butter and flour and stirred till smooth, then added chicken broth and approx 1/4 c lt cream. Excellent flavor

This was a great starting point for an easy recipe. We used bacon wrapped "turkey fillets" instead of cutlets, but that's close enough. We also used home-made chicken-foot stock which really helps, and I added a dash of flour to pan juices, more butter, skipped the honey, and added some cream. I also goosed the sauce at the end with more oloroso sherry. It was quite good. This is very simple and easy to experiment with.

The only thing done differently was using individually wrapped turkey mignons wrapped in bacon... Worked beautifully and the sauce is delicious! KIMBER

Easy and delicious. I did add a little flour to thicken sauce and spun in food processor to slightly break up peppercorns.
