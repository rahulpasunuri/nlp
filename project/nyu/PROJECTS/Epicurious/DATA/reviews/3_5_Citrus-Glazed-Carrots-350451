These were amazing! I used less sugar than recommended and they were sweet enough. It took longer to reduce the sauce to glaze than I expected, but it was SO worth it. My guests couldn't stop eating these and neither could I. They were delicious.

Since I have made other carrot recipes with citrus to good reviews I tried this for Thanksgiving dinner. We all (young and middle aged adults) enjoyed them. I avoided the "too much liquid and non glazing" problem sort of by accident. I made them the night before and warmed the juice as directed. But the turkey wasn't ready when I expected so the juice cooked longer than I planned. By the time I added the carrots the juice had cooked down more so the carrots got warm and glazed just right. I also substituted the honey for the sugar as other suggested. Very nice carrot recipe.

Not bad, but a lot of work for a carrot side dish. The carrots also weren't soft enough. Not a fan of lime juice with carrots.

All recipes are a matter of taste. I am glad I was not put off by some negative reviews. Everyone at my Thanksgiving table enjoyed these. And yes I will make them again. Only change I made was to sub 1/4 cup of honey for the 1/2 cup of sugar as some otheres have done.

I was very disappointed in this dish. It was a lot of work, and was a two day process, and not worth the trouble. The flavor was bad and they weren't cooked enough. I shared them with others and was embarrased to have done so.

and only used 1/2 Tb.

For me, this is a very good idea but it's out of balance. It is so citrusy & sweet that it's like a lime candy without the delicate trace of carrots! I replaced the sugar with 1/4 cup honey, omitted the grated lime peel and used 1/4 tsp orange peel. I also reduced the lime juice

I'm usually not a fan of cooked carrots, but these were phenomenal! I subbed the reduced honey amount for the sugar, and found it the perfect level of sweetness. I also had a bit of trouble getting it to reduce enough (I wanted to make sure not to overcook the carrots), so I just took out some of the liquid and the rest glazed the carrots quite nicely. I agree that getting a glaze is crucial, as I had tasted them before the glazing and after. Definitely a keeper recipe!

Great carrot recipe. Served this with ham, green beans, and scalloped potatoes for Easter dinner. Used the suggestion of 1/4 c. honey instead of 1/2 c. sugar. Wonderful! The lime definitely gave it brightness and brought out a wonderfully fresh flavor in the carrots. Will be using this again, and again in the future.

These carrots were a hit last year at Thanksgiving, because of their unusual citrus flavor. I wasn't a huge fan though (thought they were overly sweet) and likely won't make them again.

Nice review Hawkster. Thanks.

While my carrots never officially "glazed," they were still fabulous! I've made this dish twice now, and each time the flavor has been spot on, but very soupy. I serve them with a slotted spoon so guests can just pull out the carrots. Still delicious!

I made this dish to go with a Thanksgiving dinner, found it to be a little too sweet. I will try it again with less sugar, and maybe less orange. I didn't get the lime to come through.

I love this recipe - it's terrific. Fresh and tangy, and the carrots have a wonderful consistency. Guests have raved about it.

I gave it three forks, though my family argued it was a four-fork recipe! I enjoyed the carrots, but it was a little to "tangy" for me. Perhaps next time I will omit the zest.

If the sauce is reduced correctly, these carrots have an intensity of flavor not predicted by a simple reading of the ingredients. When preparing, if in doubt, go with less rather than more. I also used honey instead of sugar, which I thought was a worthy substitute. I enjoy the inherent sweetness of carrots (as well as corn) so less sweetener was appropriate here for me: 1/4C [at most] honey instead of 1/2C sugar. I served this with tea-infused smoked duck breasts. Just Like Downtown. My highest rating.

Not a big carrot fan, but these were quite good. Used small slender carrots with stems (prepackaged) and only cooked for 6 minutes. I would make them again.

Great carrot recipe, I just do it all in one step though...

Made for Easter dinner; everyone raved about them being the best carrots they ever had. Part of the key is to make sure all ingredients are fresh (OJ, Lime, herbs). Also, make sure the first part of the prep is done the day before to allow adequate marination (even though they are kept in separate containers)!

Good new way to cook carrots. Be careful with the sugar, and a bit more liberal with the lime juice. Easy to make.

Made them as instructed, and they were perfectly cooked and really delicious. The flavor and presentation are bright and cheerful.

I cooked these quite a longer time than directed to become more tender. They turned out nicely, although too bold for Thanksgiving turkey and all the sides. Maybe with a simpler light chicken breast and salad next time...

I made this exactly as directed except cooked the carrots a couple minutes less as we like them crisp. Wow! All our guests raved and devoured them and my husband and I agreed this was 'the' carrot recipe to go to. Making it again for our neighborhood Christmas progressive dinner!

This was a great dish for Thanksgiving. I made the scalloped yukon gold and sweet potaot dish from this site and I wanted the rest of the veggies to not be heavy. The carrots was very tasty. The citrus came throughwell. They did take a bit longer to cook then the recipe indicated. I did the make ahead so they cooked twice which helped the liquid thicken. In the universe of meals these area wonderful supporting dish not the star, but they really are very good.

These were a hit at the sort-of potluck Thanksgiving I was at. Even people who don't usually eat cooked carrots ate them up.

Excellent - added great flavor. Served with the Roast turkey with chipotle glaze and catamelized-onion gravy. Everyone asked for the recipe.

I made this for T-giving and I thought it was very fresh tasting. A wonderful addition to the rest of the butter laden options at the table!

Excellent Recipe. Must say, this one is definitely going into my "must-have" thanksgiving menu. We tried to leave the whole carrots (organic) and added few potato wedges. I LOVE this recipe!

Very good update. And loved that I could make it before Thanksgiving.

Lovely. I used honey instead of sugar, and omitted lime juice/peel. Turned out delicious. Not all the water absorbed so I just drained them and it was fine.

Normally I make a carrot side dish for its colour more than anything else. This dish was interesting because there wasn't a single carrot left in the bowl by the time dinner was over. I love citrus but I found the flavours very bold and overpowering. Husband really enjoyed it though as did the other diners. Will make it again but with less zest just to see if I like it any better.

I made the dish according to the recipe for a dinner party, and there was a lot left over at the end of the night. It was certainly edible, but not at all enjoyable to my taste (or the tastes of my friends)

Great recipe - really enjoyed the lime. We made it according to recipe, but used splenda rather than sugar.

A fresh and flavorful way to make carrots! I didn't use sugar or butter and did not feel that anything was lacking in taste.
