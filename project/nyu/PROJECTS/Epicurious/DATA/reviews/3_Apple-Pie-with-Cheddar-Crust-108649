excellent, excellent, excellent. used extra sharp white cheddar, a bit more cornstarch than mentioned per previous reviews, ALL butter (no shortening) and 5 Pink Lady variety apples. fantastic flavor, perfect amount of cheese, not too much sugar - wonderful for those who appreciate the savory/sweet juxtaposition in flavor.

Tasty, wanted to try something different than the standard apple pie. The cheese was interesting but not sure it's worth the added calories. Crust was flavorful and flaky. Filling needed additional cornstarch. Didn't need the deep dish pan, used regular 9" and had no problems.

Will have to modify this recipe some for the future. The crust was beautiful, rolled easily, very elastic, but became somewhat leathery the second day. Used organic Granny Smith apples and they were a bit too juicy, will add more corn starch or flour next time. It could use a bit of spice, my boyfriend suggested cinnamon, I might also try a touch of cayenne in the future.

The crust was excellent, however, I didn't add the cornstarch, used granny and gala apples and I also had to add in cinnamon.

The crust was incredibly yummy; I used a good quality sharp white cheddar. Several here felt the filling needed a kick and I agree that the filling in the November 1996 recipe is superior. I omitted the raisins, macerated the apples in lemon juice, and used cornstarch, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. The edge of my crust burned a bit in spite of covering with aluminum foil - any tips on this? I figure the cheese factor as well as my imperfect rolling out of the pate brisee were at fault. Nevertheless, delicious!

I pureed this pie with some vanilla ice cream to the consistency of salad dressing and used it for a dipping sauce for Jalapeno Poppers -- delicious!

Eh, would be my description of this pie. I used sharp cheddar and could still hardly taste it. The filling was a little bland. I had no trouble with the crust. It was really flaky but the whole pie took much longer to cook than the recipe stated. I think I will go back to my usual pie. This was too much work for a less than stellar product.

Yummy. Cheddar and apple are so nice together. I've made it dozens of times and it's always a crowd pleaser.

I really shouldn't have given this four forks cos' I'm really only judging the crust, but it really is the most incredible crust. In case anyone wants to know what works in the filling for me (and I'm the official apple pie baker for my family's apple trees) it is just a load of brown sugar (I like dark), cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, a little ginger and a handful or two of flour. Make sure you don't let the apple mixture sit before filling the crust or it will get soupy! Sooo good. x

I have never met a crust that I didn't struggle with and this was no different. I know it's me, but there are too many really good apple pie recipes and we didn't find that the filling was that terrific.

My father, who has 50 plus years of apple pie testing loved it, as did everyone else who tried it. I will make it again.

This recipe is fabulous! I've made it twice. Once with salted butter, and the second with light margarine. Both times it worked out great. I also used Empire apples (upon reccommendation of the grocer.) They were really good. I add juice from an entire lemon and a little cinnamon for spice. The extra tart is great. Very simple recipe as well.

While I, too, have mixed feelings about the reviews posted here, it seems like the underlying sentiment is that there is a good idea lurking behind it. There is! There's a much better recipe for this concept in Bon Appetit, November 1996 - Deep Dish Apple Pie with Cheddar Crust. The reviews there reveal the secret of using 1 t. pepper in lieu of the more traditional pie spices, which really wakes up the whole pie (and the crust gets raves!)So there's my two cents - take it for what you paid for it, and Happy Thanksgiving to all!

I am "The passionate Patissiere"I I ran a french cafe for 14 yrs in a little town just out side Montreal which was writeen up in the gazette several times..I smiled empathetically at the cook who had problems with his crust..so here are a few tips for perfect pie crust(non sweet) known as pate brise..first of all you should have enough fat in proportion to the flour and the fat should be firm NOT soft.I like 40 t0 50%..add 5% salt(les if fat is salted) then cut the fat into little squares before adding .this keeps you from over mixing..the fat should remain in little balls in the mixture..now add slowly cold water approx 1/3 of amount of flour..mix with a fork or your mixer on slow JUST enough to hold it together ..then finish job with hands..put in plastic bag and let rest for at least and hour..when rolling out take just enough for what you need..rub JUST a tad of flour on rolling surface and rolling pin.. and roll to about 1/8in and use on lightly floured pie mold..repeat if you need top crust.good for quiches, tortieres..if you need a sweet dough let me know,,good luck!!!!

The crust came out well, but I had tons left over, and I used Extra sharp chedder which is good, because you still barely tasted it. The apple part of the pie was a disaster, and if I make it again, I will use my own recipe since there wasn't much flavoring to it. I was hoping for more, so tweeking it with your own ideas may make it a lot better.

Arlington, thank you for the best bday present I got this year. You would definitely receive an A+ in my Creative Writing class! Blanche, lighten up! Remove the splintered two by four from your hind quarters and enjoy your fellow man! I'm deliberately giving this recipe 3 forks just for you before I make it which will be this weekend. Shall I alert the media?

This was an OK pie- I added more sugar and cinnamon to the filling which was definitly a wise move. The crust was bit disappointing- a little tough (maybe I added too much water?)- wished the flavor of the cheese was more evident. The crust would be great for pot pie or appetizers as one of the other reviewers mentioned.

A GREAT combination

Wow, I thought this recipie would be better. I did get a kick out of the reviews though so I thought I would stick my two-cents in there. Use apples that stay firm and use cheddar that you can taste. I used mild and you could barely tell there was cheese in the crust. Next time, I will use the Sharp.

This is the first time that I actually read the reviews in this reciepe section........what fun! I didn't make this because I am pie-crust handicapped.You can hammer nails with my crust! Do the apples in this pie stay a bit crisp? I love pie that has fruit that is still a bit crisp.

This is a great recipe if you like a dessert that is not too sweet. The taste of cheddar with the Granny Smith apples is a nice combination. You can eat any leftovers for breakfast, too. Unless of course, you have used moldy gorgonzola in it, in which case you probably will have chucked any leftovers in the trash... :)

This recipe was very yummy, however next time I would cut back the sugar. Also the baking time is very sensitive to which type of apple you use, I did not use Granny Smith (but a mixture of varietals), and cut the baking time by 10, and 15 minutes respectively. It's a perfect fall pie!

Rating: 3
Cheddar cheese complements apples so well, it amazes me every time I taste the combination... This was a quite yummy dish, although I would have preferred to have had some spices in the filling. Maybe I've just been conditioned to expect some cinnamon and cardamom, but I felt that it lacked that special "kick" that I have come to love from apple pie.

to the cook from arlington va... shame on you for using food that has been in your refrigerator for 6 mos to make something, and then serve it to your neighbors... you desserve whatever opinion they have of you...!!!! and how can u rate this recipe with 3 forks, when u didnt even make it??? i just dont get u... but it has been humorous reading all the comments u have made people send in...

If you're interested in making a main dish style pie, try making a tourtiere, which is a Canadian savoury ground meat pie (traditionally pork, but I use ground turkey). I saute the meat with onions and sliced granny smith apples, add cinnamon, allspice, sage, fennel and garlic, add one egg and pour into a pie crust and top with a bunch of sharp cheddar. Bake for about 40 min. Also good with gruyere. Haven't tried it with gorgonzola, although I am also from Arlington VA.

Cook from Brooklyn..I, like Elizabeth, like where you're going with this recipe. Perhaps a quiche recipe could be altered to suit the taste you're going for. It would probably take a few tries? If I get a chance I'm going to give it a whirl. I must say..reading all the review has had me in stitches and made my weekend... and it's only Saturday morning.

Cook from Brooklyn....I really like where you are going with this recipe. I think adding onions, bacon, etc. is a great idea for a brunch or light dinner. Let us know how it turns out if you make it. Blanche....geez.....I don't know why you feel you are the one to set the rules for what is posted here but you obviously are very needy. I agree, this should pretty much be for rating the recipe and making suggestions. I just jumped in with my hard-to-control-at-times sense of humor and responded to the comments that were already posted. Perhaps you need to lighten up a bit???? Aside from all that, I like the recipe and also like the idea of adding the chilis as the cook from Texas suggested. I really like the tang of the cheese against the apples.

I've just moved to Texas from New Mexico where I learned to make apple with green chilie, topped off with a slice of cheddar cheese. This recipe needs about 1/4 cup of green chilie and it will be perfect! BTW I love reading all the drama, you guys crack me up!

Rating: 0
While I am not so interested in all of the drama, I am interested in this recipe... does anyone have any good ideas as to how to convert this from a dessert style pie to a main dish type pie? I think it sounds like a good start to maybe cut back on the sugar, throw some ham or bacon into, a bit of onion, and perhaps, add some cheese to the filling as well as the crust. Maybe maple syrup instead of sugar, to provide the sweetness the apples need to lessen the acidity? Seriously, I would like to hear what others think on this one. I am a mediocre cook, admittedly, but this one inspires me. I am just worried that changing things up might cause problems... you know, moisture content, cook time... maybe somebody more experienced than me can help me master this little inspiration into brunch, instead of just an idea?

Hi Blanche - seems your English has improved since your last post. Good work. BTW, your complaints about other people merely announcing their intention to make something is just as useless to the rest of us as the person's annoucement of said intentions. Also, did someone appoint you "moderator" of this forum? We don't give a "hang" what you think about substituting. Oh, and the rotten gorgonzola substitution was a joke to begin with - besides, apples and gorgonzola are an excellent combination, IMO. What it boils down to Blanche, is that you are a food snob, and my bet is that you don't have the culinary skills to back it up, either.

1. I don't give a hang if someone has read the recipe and announces to others interested in a REVIEW that she has an INTENTION to try it. Intentions don't count. 2. Please don't announce that the "recipe" didn't taste good. Recipes are dead things that come to life (whether useful or not) in the hands and skills of the cook.If you have to announce that what you did with the recipe didn't taste good, then say why. Otherwise don't publish your opinion. 3. When you substite, think beforehand of the alterations in taste that may ensue. Emmenthal for Cheddar seems reasonable. Gorgonzol? I wonder....

This recipe is okay. I like the traditional style crust better so I can have apple pie a-la-mode. But.....I used the cheddar cheese crust to make various appetizers and it is great!

I'm not an"apple pie w/ a slice of cheese" gal in the first place, so I wasn't holding my breath that this pie would knock my socks off or anything. However, my father has always loved the combination so I made it for him....and my husband who likes anything weird. They loved it! I thought it was okay. I can imagine that anyone who has a taste for savory w/ sweet will really appreciate this recipe. I wouldn't be experimenting with different cheeses, though!! Good luck!

Usually I do not comment on what other reviewers write, but I had to in this instance after reading Arlington's review. Why in the world would anyone think that substituting gargonzola for cheddar cheese would be a good idea? WHY would one keep food when it is obviously too old to be servable in any shape or form? WHY would you invite people over for dinner that you do not enjoy the company of, let alone serve them rotten cheese? Finally, WHY did this reviewer give the recipe a 3 fork, delicious, rating?! Strange...
