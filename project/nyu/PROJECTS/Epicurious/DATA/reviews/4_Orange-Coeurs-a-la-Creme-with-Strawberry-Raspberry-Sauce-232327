Excellent! This fulfilled my craving for ice cream in the evening and I think a little better for me too. I didn't have an orange so I used lime zest and I didn't have raspberries so it was strawberry only. Oh and I couldn't find Neufchatel cheese, had to use cream cheese. But really enjoyed it and will definitely make again.

Absolutely delicious, and so simple. I used Knudsen's 2% cottage cheese, 2% Greek yogurt, and Philadelphia Neufchatel. Used the called-for quantity of sugar and threw in 2 tsp. Cointreau for a little extra orange kick. Bought the heart molds at Sur La Table. My honey dislikes all berries, so I made the blood orange syrup from Epicurious instead. A perfect little Valentine's Day dessert.

I've never had "real" coeurs a la creme but these were delicious. Nice and light, not too rich. I couldn't find molds in time, so I drilled some holes in the bottoms of small plastic ziploc containers. When I first checked on them, the plastic wrap covering them was pretty wet, so I put a paper towel over the top instead. It seemed to absorbed a lot of moisture, so I'd suggest that over plastic wrap.

I just recently saw a similiar recipe that uses chocolate strips, (pour melted chocolate onto parchment, smooth and let cool, cut into strips using an exacto knife,) and created a double layer of the chocolate to create a "crack" or broken heart, and then have the sauce coming out of the crack. You must set the double layers of chocolate strips in the mold to create the effect.

A great light dessert for company dinners, particularly since you make ahead. Have made it several times. I use frozen raspberries to make the sauce and then use fresh berries for garnish along with slivers of orange peel.
