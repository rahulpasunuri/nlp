I added a dash of nutmeg for more nutty aroma and sweetness and served as a spread.

I made this with my roomate last night after we got home late from work. It was quick, easy and delicious! It also gave me a great excuse to use my new food processor! My roomate doesnt like walnuts so we substituted the traditonal pesto, pine nuts, which were fabulous in it. We also sauteed up some chicken and threw that in for protein. tack on a side salad and you have a great meal! We were also surpirsed with the creaminess of the sauce, nice and creamy with out the extra fat of cream (we thinned it with the cooking water) WONDERFUL! I look forward to make this again with walnuts!

I made this last night with my roomate and LOVED IT! Thes uncooked herbs gave it a very fresh taste. We were surpirsed that the sauce turned out surpirsingly creamy even though we thinned it as told with the cooking water (which is a wonderful thing, creamy without the fatty cream!!) My roommate does not like walnuts so we subtituted the traditional pesto nut, pine nuts, this was a great substitution. We also sauteed up some chicken and threw that in there too for some protein. tack on a side salad and you have a great meal! I look forward to making this again and this time trying it with walnuts!

This was super easy and tasted wonderful. Didn't find 4 tbsp sage to be too much. Also added some leftover chicken/spinach/feta chopped bratwurst. Wunderbar!

I would say this is a 2-3 fork recipe. It's pretty good, repeatable for a during-the-week quick dinner, especially during the summer, when there's tons of fresh sage around. I used coriander, since that is what I had on hand. Might be nice with a little lemon. Got good reviews from the kids. They are taking the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

I am always looking for interesting alternative pestos -- this was fantastic. Mind you, I've only just zipped it up in the food processor and having finger tastes. I can't wait for this on hot pasta, on cold pasta, on a slice of bread or cracker, or to dip veggies, all of the above! Great!

I did not like the flavors of this dish. The sauce was pasty and the pesto had a very strong flavor- may be ok for a side dish, but definitely wouldn't make again as a main course.

Loved this recipe as a way to use my herbs before the frost killed them. I didn't measure anything but eyballed it -- quick & delicious. Next time I may serve this as a tapenade with crackers,

Good, but very thick. Used more oil and sage. Used spinach fettucine

This was good, but the recipe calls for waaaay to many walnuts. They completely overpowered the sage. It's much better when you cut the amount of walnuts in half.

Just terrific. A nice change from the usual basil pesto; I like the sage even better! Also, makes a much lighter, non-oily pesto which is nice. Made mine with thin spaghetti, dried parsley (1/2 the amount of fresh) and 2 garlic cloves. Recommend using the full 4T of sage; its wonderful pine-like flavor goes so well with the toasted walnuts. Wonderful.

This was excellent. We, too, used the full amount of sage, and maybe a bit more, and found it very good. I highly recommend this dish, and would make it for guests.

This was a great way to use up extra sage. I added about 4 tbls and still found the sage to be sublte but pleasing. I Tossed some roast chicken into the pasta to make a heartier meal and my guests ate it up.

I was a little worried when I blended the sage and garlic together, it smelled bad. But the walnuts and cheese mellowed it out wonderfully. It was toasty, savory, rich and delicious. Even my 15-month daughter loved it! Very easy makes it a four fork - great weekday vegetarian recipe.

This was a nice twist on traditional basil pesto. The full cup of walnuts makes it very thick in texture, so you definitely do need to add the pasta's cooking water to get a nice consistency. I added one rather large garlic clove to the recipe but will add even more garlic the next time I make this dish.
