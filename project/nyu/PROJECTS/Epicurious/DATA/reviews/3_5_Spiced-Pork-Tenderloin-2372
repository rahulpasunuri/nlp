I just made this for dinner and am giving it 4 forks-it was delicious and very easy to make. I browned the tenderloin in my cast iron skillet, baked for 30 minutes on convection roast and it came out just right. It was not pink, but still moist and tender. I used a cherry bourbon for the sauce (doubled it!) and it was very tasty- added salt and pepper to the sauce also. I almost didn't make this because of the most recent reviews, but am very glad that I did.

Quite blah. Let it marinate overnight and flavor didn't really develop as i hoped. Sauce did nothing for me. There are better things to do with pork t-loin.

I was underwhelmed with this recipe. I used less salt because a previous reviewer felt it was waaaaay to salty. Perhaps they used table salt. I used the course salt and wished I added the whole tsp as called for. The recipe title was spiced pork so i thought it was going to have more of a "kick". I found it to be rather bland. The sauce was good, but not great, again, a bit bland. If I were to make it again, I would double the spice rub for more flavor. I did the the sauce as other reviewers recommended and my kids enjoyed pouring it over rice. I think there are more interesting recipes on this site, although this recipe was easy to make.

Waaayyy too salty and we like some salt. I wish I had read the reviews before making the rub. Definitely use half the salt. I used fresh thyme which was good, but again overpowered by the salt

I only had an hour before cooking and still put the rub on and put it in the fridge. It came out with a great tasting crust and was really easy to prepare.

This was easy and good. Marinated for four hours, and it had good flavor. Also doubled the sauce.

I had high hopes for this b/c the reviews were so great. I found the marinade flavors were just way too much and overwhelmed the whole thing (as well as my side dishes). Maybe better if marinate for just an hour? Also think would be better on a grill. I tried using gran marnier as some suggested, but with cream -- the result was reminiscent of a creamsicle. So I tossed it, and made a new sauce to resemble the one the original recipe called for. Used cream, brandy, and demi glace. It was ok. Weird to add sauce to something that's already over-the-top garlicky. Probably no suace would be better. I make pork tenderloin often, and hoped this would be a great one (esp. as it's so easy). But I have to say, I really didn't like it. My guests seemed underwhelmed as well. Politely said they liked it, but no one raved or said much of anything else. Oh well.

made it twice, delicious! Sauce much much better with 15% cream...milk after boiling became weird looking.

This is great! Almost too easy; I didn't try it at first because I thought as simple as it was, the taste might be boring. Just the opposite; it is the best pork tenderloin I have ever had! I make the sauce with brandy and heavy cream and it is lovely.

Excellent recipe! Made for my husband's birthday dinner and he loved it! Took other reviewers suggestions and cut salt in half. Agree with doubling sauce. I used half and half but next time will probably stick with whole milk for a creamier sauce (it quickly got thick on sitting)--it was still very good. Used Grand Marnier instead of brandy as one cook suggested and it turned out very flavorful. Highly recommended recipe!

I've made this several times the meat is great but I didn't care for the sauce as the recipe written so I've tweeked it. I deglaze the pan with dry sherry, add a packet of McCormick's pork gravy mix (tacky, I know, but this turns out very nicely), a can of cream of mushroom soup, and a bit of milk or cream. This sauce is delicious. Even my 7-year-old nephew, the world's pickiest eater, has 3rds or 4ths. And every time I talk to my sister, she says "I have a pork tenderloin - can you come over and cook?" I strongly recommend this twist on the sauce. It's much better than the orginial recipe.

This was good, but not great or a "Company" dish. The pork was very tender, the sauce was okay, and my family enjoyed it. I will make it again because it is a good weeknight meal due to its simplicity. I wish I didn't have to use whole milk.

Easy and so delicious! The meat had a wonderful flavor, and was so tender you could cut it with a fork.

This pork tenderloin recipe is simple to prepare but the end result makes it seem like it is way more complicated - delicious! It is quickly becoming a frequently requested recipe.

I was leary as it looked too simple - my wife could probably even make this! Smallest package of tenderloin I could find today was over two pounds so I cooked it all. The two of us wolfed it down, and right about now I feel as pregnant as she is. In other words it was great. I probably shouldn't mention my rookie mistakes (or more accurately, my Jack Daniels-inspired mistakes) but....the handles of the skillet get hot in the oven (yup four - count it, FOUR - times...) and milk boils over easily, especially when you quadruple the sauce (double as everyone is saying, plus I made a double recipe.) Ok, enough about that; make it and like it!

The recipe was quick and easy. Everyone raved about it. The tenderloin was juicy and very tasty so good in fact that I've sent a copy to my mom.

Very simple and delicious. I doubled the sauce as suggested by another cook. All my friends and family love this.

Made this for a dinner party and it went over really well. Question: Has anyone substituted red wine for the brandy? I thought that might be better.... I am going to make it again and thought about making that change

I read all of the reviews and thought, yeah right, something this easy can't be that good. Well, all of you were right! This was sensational! I did take the advice to double the sauce and was glad I did. I think this is good enough for company, but easy enough for every day. My teenaged son enjoyed it as well. I will certainly make this again!

In a word, FABULOUS! I highly recommend doubling the sauce. This dish is great served with rice pilaf, as the sauce tastes amazing on the rice, too! Enjoy!

Have served this several time for family and friends - a consistent winner. The only change I'd suggest is to double-up on the sauce. A wonderful dish!

I agree, it was a bit salty, but not bad, actually. I'll cut the salt in half and add more spice, I think. I used non fat half and half, and the sauce was wonderful. Try it, use sea salt, not as much as called for and lovelovelove the results for almost zero work!

Absolutely delicious and so simple to make. I used black pepper and 2% milk; don't think either changes the dish much. Terrific recipe. A definate keeper!

This is very flavorful and easy to prepare. I used marsala instead of brandy & it was fine. Make sure you sear the ends of the tenderloins as well as the sides. BEWARE - don't overcook it and don't do like I did and waste a bottle of chardonnay with it - it needs a full bodied merlot, at very least.

This is the simplest. most delicious way to serve pork for yor you and your guests. Not only can you serve it as suggested in the recipe, but you can get creative: wraps, sandwiches, with coulis... (yuuuuummy!!) Finally! you can serve pork to your kids and make it "cool"!

This couldn't be easier, and it's very tasty. Next time I'd probably use half cream and half milk. I took another reviewer's suggestion and used less salt in the spice rub. Then, when I tasted the reduced sauce, I felt it needed salting; unfortunately, I used too heavy a hand. My fault, certainly not that of the recipe. I used white pepper as recommended, but if it wasn't on hand, I see no reason not to use regular black pepper. I suspect the white was called for to avoid black specks in the sauce, but that's of no major importance. Will definitely make this again.

The rub seemed very salty; will cut in half the next time. The meat was very tender, though - good way to cook tenderloin. Also, I made the sauce with half & half, and it reduced in less than 4 minutes - watch closely!

I've been preparing this dish for ten years now, and it never fails. The sauce seems too heavy for summer, so instead I'll often pair the tenderloin with mango chutney. The technique of searing the meat, then cooking for about 30 minutes, has become my stand-by manner of preparing pork tenderloin, with a variety of marinades/rubs.

A wonderful, simple, and tasty dish. It has quickly become one of my entertaining favorites.

I doubled all the spices for extra "oomph" on flavor and used Grand Marnier. It was way too salty. Next time I will double it all again, except for the salt. It was great! I am a new cook and it was simple and impressed my husband! At least that's what he SAID.

This was absolutely delicious. I used heavy cream instead of milk for a wonderfull sauce. I can't wait to make it again.

Wonderful quick recipe. In fact, when I last went to make the sauce for the pork, I was in such a hurry I accidentally grabbed cognac instead of brandy. It worked and was delicious.

This has been one of my standby recipes for the past several years -- it's consistently good. A wonderful dish for company ... displays nicely on the plate and interesting flavors--tastes great. The other huge bonus -- a snap to prepare and your kitchen isn't a wreck!!! I agree -- sauce can be doubled. Give this one a try--you'll like it.

The tenderloin was outstanding and the sauce was too. I also recommend increasing the sauce as the buckeye from Ada, Ohio, wrote by doubling the milk and brandy. I also tried it once with sherry with good results.

Even without letting the rub sit for four hours (I only had time for 1/2 an hour), this recipe was excellent. I made it with honey glazed butternut squash, and the two comlimented each other wonderfully.

This was so delicious and so very easy to make. I served a classic Caesar Salad before with Basmati Brown rice and mixed vegetables. All was a hit surrounding the very nice tenderloin. Bananas Foster rounded out the meal. The ease of the tenderloin recipe gave me time to make everything.

Ultra-simple to make, and it came out moist and delicious. I served it with a pumpkin-kale risotto (which was time-consuming, so it was nice not to have to worry about the pork)and a field greens salad.

This recipe is a real winner. The tenderloin is so delicious with this combination of spices and the sauce is yummy too. I've used this recipe for dinner parties and have recieved rave reviews. It's easy to double, or even triple. The only suggestion I would make is if you like more sauce, increase the milk and brandy proportionately.
