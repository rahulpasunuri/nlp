This tart was delicious and would great in a bowl with ice cream, too. The crust was super easy and tasted perfect - like a shortbread cookie. I didn't roll it out completely. Patting it in will do just fine. I will say - make sure your peaches aren't too ripe. Mine were quite soft and I felt the tart wasn't as firmed up as I would have wanted. The mascarpone cream was amazing and a great pairing with the peaches.

I followed this recipe exactly but used an 11-inch pan. Everyone liked it very much, but I would make two small changes: 1. Grease the bottom of the pan (half of the bottom crust stuck to it); 2. The double-thick sides of the crust didn't seem necessary. I tasted the peaches as I cut them. They weren't too sweet, so I didn't bother to reduce the sugar (as some reviewers suggested).

Lovely dessert for entertaining! Just a few minor modifications - I did not roll out the pastry just padded it in. Marscapone cream- I did not add any sugar and used a vanilla bean. When I make it again I will use an additional peach.

I made this for a friend, and made myself a mini version from some leftover crust dough and peaches. I haven't heard his reaction but my mini tart was delicious! This recipe is simple and straightforward. The tart comes out looking superb.

Ptooey. This tart was rather flat in flavor...and I used farmstand peaches and local wildflower honey. It looked pretty enough, and considering that plus the quality of the ingredients I used, I had high expectations... Yet somehow it reminded me of baby food in a pie crust. The almonds were intrusive, providing an unwelcome crunch that interrupted the otherwise smooth texture, but which wasn't crunchy enough to appear intentional; in other words, the almonds taste like a garnish (if you catch my drift...):-(

The crust was probably the best tasting and easiest handling of any tart crust. I made 2 minor changes: deleted the honey, added 1/4ish t.cardamon to the filing. My husband asked for peach pie for 60th dinner party, but this was ever so much more elegant. The cardamon is a nice switch from nutmeg & cinnamon used in pies. Guests loved it, esp. the spice they couldn't quite place. Loved the topping, which was multi-purpose as it went nicely with the chocolate cake also served. Used very fragrant, ripe peaches, all the butter called for & then the fabulous topping. Can't really miss.

This was OK. The filling was nothing special, but not bad. The crust though was great and super easy to make. Next time I bake a tart I will use this crust with a different filling or least spice this filling up a bit.

Absolutely loved this! And it doesn't take a true 6 hours as much of that time is in the freezer. I would make it again! the lemon zest and the mascarpone made it special. My peaches ended up mounded in the center and still worked well. Next time I won't cook the crust quite as long the first time.

I'm about to prepare this tarte for the third time this summer. My most discriminating foodie friends were impressed. I added extra marscapone, indulged with Provence honey, and garnished with fresh mint. Definitely use the recommended 9" removable tarte pan and no bigger to get the height Thank you Bon Appetit!

Delicious, easy, gorgeous! It does take some time to make, but that's mostly waiting for the crust to chill in the fridge. Will definitely make this again.

My crust had the texture and crunchiness of a cookie almost, wondering if I did something wrong. It was a little to cookie like for the pie. Will try again today. The filling was in a word AMAZING. So fast, so easy, the cream is a MUST. Did not have honey, substituted agave. Threw in a handful of fresh blueberries. Very good.

I followed this recipe exactly and I wouldn't change a thing. Although the tart crust did take a long time, it was very tasty. A nice and juicy summer desert. If I was to make it again I would make the crust in advance first.

Good - but not amazing. I had a heck of a time with the crust - probably not cold enough - and it seemed like a lot of time (as is to be expected when you make your own pastry, but still). I didn't love the almonds on top, and didn't really notice the honey. I will just make a plain old peach cobbler from here out.

I've made this recipe three times and each time it has been picture perfect and received rave reviews. The crust is light and buttery and the peach mixture delicious. The marcapone and cream topping is a must!

Yummy and fairly easy, if a bit time-consuming. I didn't have almonds on hand, so used dry roasted hazelnuts from the local farmers market instead. I also used a glass pie dish rather than a tart pan and it came out great. Definitely will make again.

I loved this, did not think it was hard to make. I served it with the perfect wine, Saracco Moscato D'Asti, 2004.

Delicious and gorgeous. The crust is delicate and buttery-licious. The honey, peaches and almonds are a beautiful combination. I gave this recipe to one of our guests to make for our dinner group. She made it slightly larger and said she didn't think she adjusted the flour in the filling accordingly, so it was a little runny but still delicious. The mascarpone cream is a perfect accompaniment.

I gave this recipe three forks because though it was delicious it was very time consuming and in the end it tasted like my mom's peach cobbler, which is good, but I expected more from three and a half hours worth of work. I will probably make this recipe again, though. It is a great presentation for company.

This was so very good. I used fresh, but still slightly firm peaches from the farmer's market. The crust was excellent, and easy (I used a pastry cutter and did it by hand), and I did not have a tart pan so I made it in a 9" cake round with no trouble. The crust was buttery and delicious, and I spiced up the peaches just a tad by adding a bit of ground ginger and cardamom. I also had fresh blackberries from the farmer's market and put those on top when I served this, which went excellent with the blackberry honey I used and the marscapone cream. This is not difficult, but it is time consuming. However, the end is highly worth it and everybody cleaned their plates!

YUM!! the honey and peaches and mascarpone cream! Most excellent! my boyfriend and I loved it. I used the sweeter white peaches, I bet saturn peaches would be out of this world too!

A winner. The tart crust is lovely and subtle. This recipe is best followed only if you have the freshest, tastiest peaches of the season--it really lets the peaches take the lead. Will definitely make this in the future.

This tart was delicious. The mascarpone cream was a terrific addition and it will be used on many other desserts. What a flavor. I used very little honey on the tart and drizzled carmel sauce over it. It's a keeper.

This is a delicious alternative to peach pie! I was in a rush when I made it so didn't follow the recipe to a tee - still had a most wonderful dessert that wow-ed the company. Tasty tart crust, and the marscapone whipped cream will be used for loads of other desserts. I do agree with other raters, the honey is over the top - I only used 1 Tablespoon of good honey and it was still a tad too much.

I had big trouble with the cream. I did as directed but it came out all crumbly and the cream separated from the cheese. It was a milky mess. Maybe I beat too long-- be careful.

Absolutely delicious!!! I didn't make the mascarpone cream since I wanted a "lighter" dessert and it was still wonderful. Pretty easy to make too. It was the perfect dessert for a backyard BBQ!

Easy to make, looked great, loved the mascarpone cream. The honey was just a little too overpowering and cloying. Perhaps we're too tied to the taste of traditional peach pie, but even my husband, who isn't too picky about desserts, gave it a "borderline" rating.

Though this recipe was less than successful(by my own doing) I gave it 3 forks because the flavor was great and had I followed the directions it would have been wonderful. My mistake; In my effort to save time and avoid making a pie crust I substituted a graham crust (I know, I know, bad idea...)and when left at room temp overnight, the juices soaked the crust giving it a very mushy, oatmeal texture. Let me rave about the mascarpone cream, it was out of this world delicious and light.

Like many of the previous reviewers, I am not a baker and my friends were very surprised that I attempted to make the crust. The crust filling and topping, while a bit time consuming, was definitely worth the little bit of effort. The mascarpone cheese was a delightful accompaniement I did not have a tart pan, but it worked fine in a glass pie plate

For a gourmet recipe, it was very easy. Cream was wonderful. I would suggest a little more sugar if peaches are not really sweet. Guest loved it!

Made the recipe the first time for company and it turned out to be delicious beyond expectation. The guests couldn't stop commenting; it was the perfect ending to a summer barbeque. One tip: try to use the sweetest peaches (and not mealy) that you can find. It makes all the difference!

A beautiful, rustic presentation perfect for summer. We've already added it to our recipe box to make again.

Like the previous reviewer, we are NOT bakers. Although, it took a bit of time to prepare, it is not overly time consuming. Our guests could not believe it when we told them it was homemade. They were certain it was purchased from from a gourment bake shop. The marscapone cream is the perfect accompaniment to this dessert. It is outstanding. My only disappointment - that there were no leftovers when all the clean-up was done and the guests had left! I should have made two like the previous reviewer.

This was fantastic and relatively easy (we are not bakers). We used pretty ripe peaches from our tree and were worried they would be too ripe, but it came out great. We make 2 at a time (one to share, one for us).
