This recipe provides a good base, but you can tweak it a bit to make it perfect. Instead of using maple syrup, try maple extract-can find at King Arthur Flour. That way, there's less liquid to contend with. So, 2 pkg. cream cheese, salt same, butter same, 1/2 tsp. maple extract, 4 cups powdered sugar, 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla, and a dash of cinnamon. Was perfect consistency for frosting pumpkin- apple cupcakes; no need for meringue powder, since the basic shape of the piping held, but was soft enough to still be considered a cream cheese frosting.

Delicious. Increased maple syrup.

Yum..used this on pumpkin bars. I cut back on the maple syrup...used only about 2 tablespoons. I also sprinkled in a little cinnamon. It was the perfect frosting for the pumpkin bars.

I made this for a Pumpkin Spice Cake and it was delicious! I only had 1/4 cup of syrup left so I added a teaspoon of maple extract. Perfect. No problem with consistency, maybe due to the fact that I used less syrup. Topped cake with chopped candied pecans and some carmel sauce. Yummy!

Made the recipe exactly as described (with Grade B for my maple syrup - I like the richer taste). Delicious! Don't know why people are complaining about it not being sweet enough. It's smooth and sweet, and I'm looking forward to spreading it on my carrot cake.

I decided to go light on the icing. I used non-fat cream cheese instead and half the butter. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract. Despise the fat, it still turned out delicious! Refrigerate for an hour and let cake cool before icing.

This recipe makes 24 cup cakes (~20 min. cooking time). Tested with great reviews by a church group, friends (who are very picky), and a birthday boy. They tasted awesome and even healthy after adding 4 cups of carrots. I made the frosting by whipping 8oz. low fat cream cheese with a dash of milk, tsp vanilla extract, pure maple syrup, and 3 TB of sugar until the right consistency.

This was a very good frosting. The butter seemed like it would be too much so I only used about 2 tablespoons. After reading other reviews, I left the frosting in the refrigerator for about half an hour before spreading. Although delicious on the first day, I preferred the frosting better the second day; the flavors had time to meld.

Loved it, kids loved it! I used one brick of cream cheese and half a stick of butter, increased sugar to 2 cups, and had a fairly thin icing which was perfect for a bundt cake.

This was a delicious icing, but I did have to make several changes to get it to work: 1) I added LOTS more 10-X sugar. There was no way 1-1/2 cups would've been enough. 2) I added 2 T. meringue powder near the end of beating, for stability for my still-droopy frosting. 3) I added a few drops of maple flavor, since I only had a Grade A maple syrup on hand, and that doesn't have near the maple flavor a Grade B does. 4) I added 1/2 tsp. salt and about 1 T. fresh lemon juice, to perk up the flavor a bit, especially since I had to add so much more sugar. But...great taste! Very "fall."

I agree that the consistency of this icing was greatly improved after being chilled. I also needed to add some additional powdered sugar to the recipe to stiffen it up. This icing complimented the carrot cake perfectly. Delicious!

Good consistency when chilled...little too sweet.. I reduced the sugar.

Another way to make this icing stiffen (without adding tons of sugar, which I don't think is a good idea) is to refrigerate it briefly, and then add in about 1/2-3/4 cup of VERY heavy cream (i used double cream, which is available in the UK, not sure if you can get it in the states) and beat into icing at a high speed until peaks form.

Could be refridgerated before applying and if still too soft add more powdered sugar. I found it necessary and the taste was more subtle.

I get RAVE reviews every time I make this cake. Easy to make and absolutely delicious!

This was one of the best tasting cream cheese frostings I've made. Even my dear husband agreed.

I've made this recipes several times. I love making miniature bundt cakes and placing a large dollop of the frosting in the center (instaed of spreading it on) & sprinkling with a few walnuts! Guests absolutley rave over these! Not only do they taste excellent but they look fabulous for entertaining!

Although this frosting tasted great, it was not suitable for 'frosting' a cake, as it drooped off the sides of my cake to make a really pathetic looking visual(on Thanksgiving of all times!). The Carrot Walnut Cake it was paired with tasted great, just next time I will use a different, stiffer frosting.

This is the best frosting I have ever made but it does make a big batch!

Excellent on top of the cinnamon streusel buns recipe! I piped it over them right out of the oven just before serving and they were amazing!

I actually used this recipe for icing on some cinnamon buns. I left out the maple syrup because I just wanted plane icing. The icing turned out great, but the cinnamon buns were horrible!

I cut the butter in half, only added about 1/2 c. confectioner's sugar and probably exceeded the 1/2 c. maple syrup (the *real* stuff, not artificially flavored corn syrup) and it came out great. My husband finds confectioner's sugar has a chemical taste when overused and I figured why add that much more grease to the cream cheese. The maple syrup flavor came through strong and true, paired with the slight sour note of the cream cheese.

Had to adjust the recipe a little, add 1/2 extra stick unsalted butter and use regular maple syrup, the pure makes it too thin. Fantastic frosting.

The frosting was a disaster because it was too thin to spread. It would have made a nice glaze, the flavor was wonderful. It did not work for a layer cake. I doubled the sugar and even used alittle flour to cut the sweetness from the extra sugar. The cake was great but I don't think I'd chance this particular frosting again. Since most things I make usually look like the magazine everyone had a good laugh over this horrible looking cake. PS I'll say again, the carrot cake was delicious!!

The flavor was fabulous, but I added at least 2 1/2 extra cups of powedered sugar in order to get a spreadable consistency. Yummy with that tinkering. :)
