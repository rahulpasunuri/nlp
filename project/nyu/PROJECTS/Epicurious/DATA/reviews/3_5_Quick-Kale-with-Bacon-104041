Yum! Nice alternative for salad. I made a lighter version for a simple weeknight supper. I used only one piece on very good thick cut bacon, subbed onion (for convenience only... shallot would be nice if you have it) & added a touch of fresh lemon juice at the end. It would go with almost anything on a cold day, but is exceptional paired with butternut soup.

Loved the smokey taste from the bacon as it goes well with the robust taste of the kale. It also looks good on the plate.

Very good recipe - what a great way to use kale. I cannot believe I am going to say this but I think next time I will use less bacon.

Great Kale recipe. I have never tasted not cooked Kale before but I just started the Atkins diet and Kale is one of the things recommended. I looked up the recipe on Epicurious and both my husband and I loved it. I didn't have any chicken broth so I used vegetable broth - it was great. I also cut the recipe in half for two people but I am sorry because the little that was left over the next day, we fought for it.

Fairly tasty soup. But, not enough to keep the recipe. Must be a big fan of Kale.

It was my belief that kale's only purpose on this earth was to be a salad bar garnish. BUT, when I received a bunch of it in my farmer's co-op box, I came to the conclusion that it was also for eating. Thank you Epicurious! This recipe was delicious! As a testimony of faith, I tell you that both my four and six year old ate their portion! IF I ever get kale again, this is the recipe I will make!

I served this on Christmas day, and it was a hit with all the family. Everyone had extra helpings of everything, but the dish they reached for first was this one. It's a definite keeper!

I thought I hated kale. I was stuck with a bunch of it and didn't know what to do. Both husband and I really liked this recipe. I no longer fear and loathe kale. And that says something.

I had some kale in my garden that I thought had gotten too tough, but with this recipe it was excellent. In fact, I am having guests for dinner and they are getting the last of my "too tough" fresh kale.
