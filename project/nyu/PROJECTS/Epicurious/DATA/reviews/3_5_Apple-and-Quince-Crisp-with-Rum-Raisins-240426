I've made this recipe with the quince & apple combo, and also just with apples. In both cases, excellent!

I had never cooked anything with quince before and tried this recipe as my first adventure with quince from the farmers market. I did change up the topping for the crisp substituting old fashioned oatmeal for 1/2 the flour and brown sugar for 1/2 of the white sugar in the topping. I also omitted the extra sugar in the filling based on other reviews that said it was too sweet. It came out amazingly wonderful, with the best aroma! I served it warm with whipped cream to which I had added a tablespoon or so of dark rum. It was so good that I went back to this recipe for Thanksgiving and used this as the filling for a pie with some pears added as well. Once again it was outstanding! I just mixed the fruit with 2 tbls. fresh lemon juice and then tossed it with 1 cup sugar, 1/4 cup cornstarch and 1 tsp. cinnamon (next time I would add some nutmeg too). I followed the instructions for the raisins exactly both times. The pie was fantastic and got lots of compliments. This recipe has absolutely made me a quince lover.

Uses bosc pears instead of quince, and added rolled oats to topping which everyone liked

I really enjoy quince, but was unable to find them for this recipe. I substituted pears that I did not precook. By doing this you have to also cut back on most of the sugar or it overwhelmingly sweet. I also practically doubled the amount of fruit to make the proportion of fruit to crisp more balanced.

I made this following the recipe exactly. On the first night it was only all right but I felt I had wasted my time. On the second night the flavors had come together and it was delicious. On the third night it was even better although, unfortunately, there was little left to eat. This is definitely a desert that improves with are so the flavors can meld.

This is a fabulous crisp recipe. If you have lots of quinces and you poach them for other uses it is very simple to put together. The rum raisins add a special touch.

This recipe deserves 5 forks. I love crisps, and anything with quince, so I was quite excited to make this recipe. Quinces are a bit of work to peel, but well worth the effort, acquiring a honey flavor when poached. I thought the proportions of fruit and sugar were fine; I always use slightly more fruit than suggested in recipes - 6 quinces in this instance - to avoid skimping. I loved the topping because of the nutmeg and melted butter. The rum raisins are a subtle addition to the mellow and sweet flavors of the quince and apples. I accompanied this with homemade honey vanilla ice cream. My brothers gave me an A+.

I followed the recipe exactly. I thought it was quite good. Never worked with quince before and glad I did.

I'd have to say I didn't really follow this recipe. Used pears instead of quince, never boiled them, but used 3/4 c. brown sugar in fruit mix. I never boiled the rum out of the raisins or used the soaking syrup in the crumble topping. It turned out fantastic. I was a bit freaked out when I put it in the oven and though, I just made something with apples and no cinnamon, but the nutmeg flavor was great. And I don't think you can serve it without ice cream.

I followed the recipe as written and found this to be "okay". It was too dry (would add more fruit next time), and the flavors were quite bland. The rum raisens were my favorite part!

This is a good way to use quince, but not the best crisp recipe out there. I didn't want to use the rum, so I instead soaked the raisins in water with vanilla and a cinammon stick. It was still a nice touch. I would omit the sugar in the fruit mix as the crisp seemed overly sweet to me. Also, the fruit mix was a bit scant in my opinion, barely covering the bottom of my baking dish. I would increase the fruit next time.
