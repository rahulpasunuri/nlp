These are terrific. Sweeter than I expected, but people loved them (except the kids).

These were fantastic. I served them plain in the Thanksgiving breadbasket and warm from the oven Thanksgiving morning filled with greek yogurt and spiced pears/pomegranates. Amazing!

I made 24 biscuits per recipe and baked them in the oven for 9 minutes. I made 3 batches for guests and they were coming back for 4ths and 5ths of these biscuits. Needless to say, they're quite good. Make sure you use fresh cardamom. My cardamom was maybe 4 years old and everyone agreed that they couldn't taste the spice in the biscuit. So, even without cardamom-ey flavor, this biscuit is good. With the cardamom flavor, this biscuit will probably be super good. I served it with the Moroccan Chickpea Soup on this website.

These were excellent! We served them with a beef stew and then with a curry soup and the cardamom complimented them both. Yum.

I have made these biscuits as the recipe states (except I never have buttermilk, so add 2 tsp vinegar to 1% milk), and they are wonderful-- they have a perfect, subtle sweetness, and their texture is part scone, part biscuit. I stopped using white stuff, so I've been making them with whole wheat flour and raw sugar, instead of brown, and they're still great. *A serving suggestion-- butter and chestnut jam on these biscuits tastes divine!!

O-M-G! Exquisite! I have made many a biscuit recipe, but thot I'd try this one b/c I had buttermilk to use up ... will never make another recipe again! Soo exceptionally light with such a delicately crisp exterior. I am a fan of cardamom but may try with cinnamon (both in & on top) next time. THANKS to the reviewer that pointed out the correct way to measure the buttermilk (add eggs first then top up with buttermilk) and the other who reminded me not to overwork the dough. I had a couple left the next day that I reheated in a 350F oven to re-crisp and they were just as excellent as the day before.

Wow, these are fantastic! Just the right amount of sugar to balance the cardamom. Definitely a keeper! I didn't make any changes and they were perfect.

Just a little messy. Otherwise, they are great.

I added 1/2 c raisins - delicious. I found these nice and light, but big. I actually made 13 biscuits, because one of my "3 equal pieces" was bigger than the rest. Next time I might make 4 equal pieces and cut them each into 4. I loved them with strawberry jam, and did not find the cardamom flavour overwhelming at all.

I made these on their own; they are basically a cardamom scone. They tasted fantastic warm with a dollop of whip cream, but I liked them even better the next day with jam. One caution--the cardamom flavor is distinctive, so I would only recommend to people fond of this spice.

loved the cardamom! brushed with olive oil and sugar instead of butter on top. i made 10 large round biscuits instead of the quarters. also didn't really knead the dough - just took a big dollop and dropped it on the cookie sheet. i can't see how the other steps would have improved the texture or appearance as they were lovely this way. served them split in half with vanilla ice cream, blueberries, and some amarene cherry syrup. delicious.

This was the first thing I made from Epicurious. They smelled, looked and tasted delicious, flavourful with some butter and a sprinkle of vanillasugar but... very filling. I made them in triangels and my family said they were really good but after a week I had to throw them away because they were to filling for a snack or dessert. I really had heartache about it. What can I do to lighten them up or are biscuits always so filling?

I made these for the peach/blueberry shortcake dessert for a dinner party and got rave reviews. Guests all said these biscuits are tasty all by themselves. Note to the cooks who commented on too much buttermilk: Make sure you're not simply adding the full 1/2 cup in the ingredients list. Make sure you instead are pouring your beaten eggs into your measuring cup & then adding just enough buttermilk to total 9 oz. Also, I think it's supposed to be a fairly wet batter -- just need a well-floured countertop & floured hands. I followed the instructions exactly & they turned out beautifully -- tasty, light and wonderful texture. Another comment: If you have a spice/coffee grinder & can grind fresh cardamom for this, it makes them even better.

What a great taste! I was skeptical at first because I'd never used cardamom before, but these turned out tasty and beautiful. I used half the amount of buttermilk, but dough was still too wet. I added lots of extra flour (1-2 cups). I didn't use the food processor -just my hands. Before baking, I let the dough sit for about 20-30 minutes. This allowed the dough to expand a bit so the biscuits were more plump.

These biscuits (more like scones) are awesome, love that cardamon flavor! This is the 3rd time I've made them and bec quick breads like biscuits could be a little tricky, it pays to do some research on how to bake them successfully (www.baking911.com). On my subsequent attempts, I put much less than the required buttermilk so as not to make them too wet. I also substituted the butter with 1/2 cup + 1 T pure olive oil (not extra virgin). Eating it side by side with the batch I made with butter, the texture and flavor is hardly sacrificed. Now I can have my cake (I mean biscuit) and eat it too.

These biscuits were fantastic. There was not a crumb left. I did all of the mixing in the food processor, so easy. I cannot wait to serve these again.

8/25/02: 3.5 forks. The cardamom makes these fluffy muffin-like biscuits exquisite. The one problem I had was that the dough was so wet and gooky that I had to add tons of flour after "pouring" it out of the bowl. Maybe the butter was not cold enough or something. I was afraid the biscuits would come out dry and tough, but the texture actually seemed perfectly fine. Next time, I will try sprinkling brown turbinado sugar instead of white granulated sugar. BTW, these biscuits were HUGE. They more than doubled in volume. I'd recommend making them into 24 biscuits on 2 baking sheets. 9/1/02: This time, I reduced the buttermilk by 1 oz, but it was still quite wet. I made drop biscuits, which were actually easier. I also made 24 smaller biscuits, which is a bettter size.

WOW--these are wonderful! I made them for the blueberry/peach shortcakes, and the whole dessert knocked our socks off. A great make-ahead dessert that I'll used again and again, I'm sure.

Very easy to make and very easy to eat. I couldn't get any buttermilk so substituted maple syrup (!?!?!?!) and it gave them a lovely edge. Will definitely be making them again. A big hit in our house.

note to self: do not overwork dough, and use half freshly grated nutmeg(or all), and half cardamom. Everyone loves them under mascerated berries and softly whipped lightly sweetened heavy cream. Serve biscuits warm and crisp, with everything else chilled. Next morning can be toasted for breakfast.

I have made this several times, and have been delighted each time. They are delicious as a shortcake or simply with butter and jam! Easy to make- Love a receipe in the food processor- and they keep for several days. I am addicted.

You won't be disappointed. This is like a light, flavorful scone.

A new take on fruit shortcakes; cardamom makes the difference. And biscuits are good enough to eat w/o fruit!
