This was an amazing recipe for a Valentines Dinner last night! A few comments: The sauce was amazing but I did not have enough of it. I usually double the sauce on recipes, but by the time the mushroom water had reduced and the creme fraiche was added, there was barely enough sauce for the couple chops. I think next time I will augment with some beef broth or demi glace. I found I needed to add a little more butter to the pan to have enough to baste. Also, I used big 2" thick veal t-bone chops, which I basted for several minutes on either side then roasted for abt 5 mins at 420. Internal temp next to bone was 130 and ended up with a perfect medium rare after resting. One of the best pan sauces I've made! The tarragon is really a great unique taste. This is impresssive and delicious.

I used dried thyme so did not discard it or the garlic as called for but wow, this was so yummy and easy. I served it with broccolini.

Great. Since other reviewers commented that it was overcooked I just stuck with the stovetop. Seared chops 3 minutes, then flipped, basted till done (I like medium rare). Cut back to 1/2 cup creme fraiche. Overall not as rich as I'd feared and the best veal chop ever. Will definately repeat!

The sauce is a 4. However, even at 10 minutes my chops were overcooked. I will make again but will simply sear the chops then finish them in the sauce at the end.

We have made this recipe twice - once in 2009 and again tonight. Both times it is exceptional. On both occasions we used a mixed exotic mushroom mix from costco that we reconstituted using the recipe. The sauce is wonderful.

I doubled the recipe - turned out well, but need to cook the chops longer overall.

The shallots are listed in the ingredients, but are not mentioned at all in the instructions. Do you just put the shallots in with the garlic?

It calls for 2/3 creme fraiche. It is on the recipe when you print it.

I'm not a great cook, but this receipe was divine...If I can cook it, anyone can. The memory has stayed with us (my huband) for two weeks so far - and I don't like food that much!
