I was really pleased with how this recipe turned out; the only change I made was adding a bit more cheese than it suggested. The vegetables were delicious and the risotto was great, especially since it was so little work. Maybe starting the risotto immediately after putting the veggies into the oven, and letting it sit with the lid on for 20 minutes before I popped it into the oven helped with making it almost as creamy as "real" risotto? This might be my new winter comfort food go-to.

This was certainly easy to make, but it lacked any flavor. Even after I grated lots more cheese than the recipe called for I couldn't taste anything more than creamy rice. The vegetables definitely add something, but if you're going to make risotto I think it's best to stick to the real thing.

This is a quite tasty recipe! It doesn't compare to traditional risotto, but I wasn't expecting it to. It doesn't cook long enough to really break down the arborio like a risotto should. It comes out pretty creamy, but I made a mistake in not covering it when putting it in the oven, so I added another cup of water and cooked it covered another 15 minutes, so I can't testify as to how it turns out when following the recipe! I served this with some roasted eggplant, zucchini, onion and garlic I got from the farmer's market and it was very satisfying.
