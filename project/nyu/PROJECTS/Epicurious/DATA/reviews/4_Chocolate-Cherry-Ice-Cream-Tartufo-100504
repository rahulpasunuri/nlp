This was DeLiCiouS! I used Bluebell cherry bordeaux (sp?) ice cream and almond-flavored cookies- I couldn't find the kind the recipe calls for. But it was still a hit! The chocolate layer in the cake was awesome. I may even try to add another chocolate layer next time. I can't wait to try different ice cream/cookie combos.

This is a fabulous and very impressive dessert,but not easy to prepare. Firstly, I've made it twice and my experiences have been the same. I prefer to use simple choc ice cream, rather than choc choc chip. It is very chocolately already and that would be overkill. Another point worth mentioning is that there is way too much ganache, half of recipe is adequate. Lastly, I think I would make the last step into 2 parts since it is very very difficult to get the top and sides frosted with the ganache and sprinkled with nuts before the ganache hardens. It is definitely worth the effort to make this, but you need patience.

This was a fabulous dessert! I used Ben and Jerry's "Cherry Garcia" and "Chocolate Fudge Brownie". It's very rich but great for a dinner party. Try it!

This is an excellent make-ahead dessert for a fairly decent sized dinner party. I had 16 people over the other night, and I had to make 2 of these. I did plate the tartufo with a raspberry coulis, which not only looked outstanding, but, it tasted outstanding as well. I followed the directions as is. I always print up a dinner menu, and then place one at both ends of the table. Everyone wanted to know what tartufo was...nobody had every tasted or heard of it before. This was a very good finale.

Excellent dessert especially for company because it is make ahead and somewhat on the light side - as far as desserts go. It has multiple steps so start several days ahead and then you'll serve it thinking how easy it was to make. I didn't put a 1/4" thick layer of ganache as suggested. I put a nice thick layer which worked our great. You don't need as much ganache as it calls for. Maybe 1/2 - 2/3 the recipe. If you put the almonds on right after the ganache the stick just fine.

Very impressive-looking ... very easy ... ... very tasty! I'm making it again for a child's birthday party. I had a hard time trying to get the toasted almonds on the exterior of the tartufo but what did stick looked nice. Anyone have suggestions on how to put the nuts on easily?

Everyone loved this. Use good quality ice cream, or suffer from frostbite which you will get when you have to knead the ice cream in to the pan. I didn't make enough of the ganache, but mini chocolate chips made a great bottom instead (just pour the chips out on to the baking sheet, and flip the dessert on to it). Also, the maraschino cherries looked kind of weird next to the black cherries in the ice cream, but that's okay...

This is a terrific desert!!! Its elegant, and easy!!! I just served it at a dinner party which included young children. To make the dessert a bit more kid-friendly, I subbed Oreo cookie crumbs for the cherries. To reduce the fat content, I used Edy's Grand Light French Silk and Cookies & Cream (for the kids) with great results. The ganache is amazing. I used toasted almond slivers on the outside rather than chopped nuts. I would definitely make again, but next time want to try with Mocha Chip & French Silk.

I substituted vanilla bean icecream for the cherry-vanilla and did not add the maraschino cherries either. I used Starbucks Java Chip ice cream in place of the chocolate-chocolate chip. It was delicious and, as promised, visually stunning!
