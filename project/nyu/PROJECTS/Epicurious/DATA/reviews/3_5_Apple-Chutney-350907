What a pleasant surprise, so full of flavor and really brings out the taste of the pork. I used extra ginger and it was great. Shame it only keeps a few weeks

i liked this recipe. it does have a pronounced vinegar flavor though... and the flavors are extremely bold. i made it to go with a pork roast and it was a nice compliment, but almost overpowered the meat.
