Just made a big batch of this to use up our plentiful cuke harvest and it looks like a winner. I didn't have any Ricard so I threw in some Pimm's (which I thought might go well since people put cuke slices in a Pimm's Cup). I also added a bit of orange rind to the syrup mixture to add a little more flavor. Looking forward to trying it tonight.

I am a student chef at EPCC in the culinary arts. We have a restaurant that is open to the public once a week. Each week, we serve an intermizzo. This one, by far, was voted the best of the best by our patrons. It is cool and refreshing with an interesting combination of flavors. WONDERFUL!
