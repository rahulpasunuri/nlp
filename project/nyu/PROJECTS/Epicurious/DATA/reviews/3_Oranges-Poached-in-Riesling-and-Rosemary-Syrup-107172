Didn't have a riesling, so I used a red dessert wine. The syrup (though not really thick enough to call syrup) was amazing. But the oranges (cut smaller, per previous reviewers) were too tough to enjoy -- did I overcook? We poured the "syrup" over ice cream, and that was heavenly.

I've made this twice. The first time just cutting the oranges in half as per the recipe - this made for a difficult eating experience. The second time I sliced the oranges into 1/2 rounds - pretty and much more manageable. You MUST used a decent reisling - a 2 buck chuck with ruin it. I have food allergies and this is a really nice and low-fat dish for anyone cooking for gf-cf and egg-free eaters. I found it refreshing, light and tasty. My mother did think it was a bit "different". But she had the 1st go.

Looking for good, fresh end to a meal with people's allergies, diets, nutrition in mind, this is a great finale. Can use less wine and more rosemary. I worried about the oranges falling apart the first time (Valencias, in season, in FL) -- but it didn;t matter at all. Didn't worry about trying it with navels, in April, they stayed in tact, and in a way, it was nicer to have the smaller pieces than full halves. But either way, it is a great (easy, do-ahead) end to a meal. A plain cooky goes well -- thin ginger cookies, or sand cookies. Nothing complex, just a little something to chew on with the oranges. It's a keeper.

This was just strange. I made it for Christmas dinner where it was in direct competition with pumpkin pie. It just didn't seem very special, and we had a lot of leftovers.

What a dissapointment! The oranges did not retain their shape and had fallen apart in the liquid which was never a syrup (too thin) by the following day. Would suggest using whole clementines and less wine and definitely more rosemary...including placing some fresh rosemary in the jar in the end.

This was very refreshing after a heavy meal. I really liked the subtle flavor the rosemary imparted. I served it with vanilla ice cream, which was probably overkill. A sherbert or citrusice might have been a better choice. If I'd had any around I would have topped with shaved chocolate.
