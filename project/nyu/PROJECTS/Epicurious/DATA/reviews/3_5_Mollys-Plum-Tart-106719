My family liked it very much, I will definitely make it again. I used more sugar for the plums as they were a little on the sour side. Also sprinkled brown sugar on top of plums.

No one in my family was very impressed with the results of this recipe: they said it was too sour. Maybe the plums were sour from the beginning, but they tasted good raw.

This was a big hit. However, do NOT bake for an hour, it was way too well done. Or you may want to cover it with foil and uncover for the last 15 min. I also sprinkled the tart with fresh raspberries before baking and dusted the finished tart with powdered sugar.

this recipe was great, not too sweet, a great mix of flavors and textures. didn't have enough almonds, so i used a mix of almonds, hazelnuts, and walnuts. i think the hour of baking time was a little too long for my tart--but that didn't stop my father from breaking off the pieces of crust to enjoy by itself!i'm going to try making the crust with half whole wheat-all-purpose flour, and regular plums instead of italian which is what's in the kitchen right now...
