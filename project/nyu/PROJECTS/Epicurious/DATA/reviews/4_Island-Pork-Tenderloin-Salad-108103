Delicious. Skipped the raisins. Spent at least an hour in the kitchen, but it was well worth it.

The wife and I are pretty big salad eaters, having it as a main course at least twice a week. The pork is the star of this show, and the vinaigrette was a nice tangy counterpoint. The changes I made were (1) used savoy cabbage since the napa at the market was in sad shape. (2) Added some thinly sliced red onions to the salad. (3) Added a touch of agave nectar to the vinaigrette to offst the tartness. Will make this again!

Great, healthy recipe. I tried two different pork tenderloin recipes: this one and the fennel rubbed pork tenderloin (also on epicurious website). The consensus was that the fennel pork tenderloin was better, though they both were good. Check out the fennel recipe.

I added dry garlic and cinnamon to the dry rub. I omitted the brown sugar and glazed with sirachi. I added grated ginger to the vinaigrette and a bit of honey. Added fresh cilantro and scallions to the salad mix. A regular favorite of mine and I don't tend to make things on a regular basis.

One of the best recipes on this site! Made it for a Hollywood Bowl concert.......great do ahead dish with fabulous spicy/sweet flavors. I segmented the oranges instead of slicing them as I don't like the membrane. Maybe (as other reviewers suggested) a bit more orange juice in the vinaigrette for sweetness. This is a keeper!

I made this recipe for a professional catering. We served the defense secretary and several other military brass. It was a huge hit. Not only did i use Pork tenderloin, i also used chicken breast. For the dressing i added a little more orange juice and a little sugar to help offset the sourness of the lime juice. Other than that i followed it exactly as written.

Delicious. Cooked on top of stove and then roasted in oven with the glaze and it was great. Followed recipe for the first two steps and ommitted the "vinaigrette" and "salad" items. Served it with Mango Salsa (Gourmet 1996) from this site. Not even one piece left!

I had to join just to place my review of this recipe, actually P90X has this same recipe in their Nutrition Plan. That should tell you it must be healthy. The only difference between the two recipes is P90X omits the avocado. This is an outstanding salad, full of flavor, sweet and spicy. Add everything it calls for, the raisins do make a difference. For those that write a bad review after leaving out half the ingredients, serious what is the point. That is like test driving a wrecked Porsche and saying Porsche isn't worth the money.

I tasted the dressing before tossing the salad and was a bit apprehensive about whether there would be enough flavour. There was and it was heavenly! Once the dish comes together, the flavours are perfectly balanced.

Rating: 4
Considering the long ingredient list and five-part recipe, this is actually very quick and simple to put together. Great, unique flavor combination. I didn't toast the curry powder (just lazy) but it was still good. Omitted the golden raisins too, (don't care for raisins) but added a touch of honey to the viniagrette to add back in a little sweetness.

Rating: 4
I followed the recipe exactly (except for the Napa cabbage, which I couldn't find), and it was terrific! The presentation was beautiful. My husband was SO impressed--both with the plating and the taste. He thought it was superb, as did my father. This is a knock-your-socks-off meal. If you want to impress your family or friends, you can't go wrong with this recipe. The pork was tender and juicy, with a nice sweet and spicy crust,perfectly balanced by the tart, citrus-y taste of the vinaigrette. Don't leave out the raisins unless you hate them--they really enhanced the salad. Wonderful recipe!

Rating: 4
Lick-the-plate-clean-deliciousness. I didn't brown it in the skillet, but I did rub the olive oil and spices on and broil it in the oven for about 4 minutes before adding the glaze and roasting it and that seemed to work just as well. I also used less sugar (about 1/2 cup) and it was still plenty. Absolutely a repeater! Oh, and I didn't have enough limes on hand so I inverted the lime and orange (3 tbs fresh orange juice, 1 tbs lime) and I made the salad with what I had (tomatoes, baby spinach, tender romaine lettuce, red lettuce, bell peppers, oranges.) I think the avocado would have added a lot to it but it was still scrumptious with those modifications :).

Rating: 4
Very tasty. I substituted Ponzo Sauce for the dressing (I used the dressing as a dipping sauce - and put the main ingredents into to a spring roll. Toss the cabbage or spinich in the Ponzu sauce and drizzle the drippings from the pan over the contents of the spring roll before rolling. You could easily substitute Tofu for the Pork with little modification. I also suspect you could substitute Pineapple for the orange. You could also substitute hiccama for the avocado.

Made this last night and it was a tad too overwhelming (all the spices). The pork tenderloin was yummy though (by itself) as it was very tender and had a good flavor. But the curry vinaigrette added too much flavor and spices. Maybe my curry was too potent. It was okay but probably won't make it again.

This is truly a Blue Ribbon Recipe! Notwithstanding your aversion to any of the ingredients in the recipe, don't hesitate! Just make it! This recipe makes me glad that Im not a vegetarian. Although I dont like foods with sugar or Tabasco sauce, I love this dish. The combination of flavors in this recipe is unique and absolutely delicious. It has become my favorite recipe for company, because it can be prepared ahead of time, except for placing the pork in the oven. I have served it with vegetables and a starch  either rice or potatoes. Its great hot or cold. I will be making it with rice and beans, as part of a Puerto Rican meal, although, Puerto Rican dishes, different from Mexican dishes, do not include Tabasco sauce or any other spicy ingredient. I have not yet made the cabbage salad, but it sounds interesting and nutritious.

I made this for a Caribbean themed summer party and it was perfect. I took other reviewers suggestions and served it as a main course meat dish rather than as a salad. I made a salsa of sweet onions, pineapple, oranges, red pepper and avocado with a generous squeeze of lime on it in place of the salad. I sliced the pork and placed it in rows on a red platter with the salsa between the rows of pork and the pitcher of vinaigrette on the side. It was a huge hit and the most requested recipe of the party. The meat was exceptionally moist and tender and all the flavors of the spices, vinaigrette and salsa melded perfectly.

Rating: 4
The pork tenderloin turned out perfectly at the time and temp suggested! I halved the brown sugar, and added some maple syrup to the vinaigrette. I omitted the raisins and oranges and used yellow peppers instead, but it was still delicious and actually made for a simpler, fresher salad, allowing the complex flavours in the tenderloin to shine through (I've had this salad made as per recipe, it was phenomenal too; but if you're serving other side dishes that are very flavourful, it can be overwhelming). Don't forget to drizzle some of the pan sauce over salad too, the sweet spiciness really adds to the curry lime dressing.

Rating: 4
A huge hit for this family on a beautiful summer night! Only a few adjustments-- I added a bit of honey to the vinaigrette (the pork wasn't nearly as sweet as I was anticipating considering the glaze). And I also toasted sliced almonds and added to the salad. A great addition. I plan to use this recipe in the fall and serve with roasted root vegetables or mashed potatoes. Enjoy!

It's hard to find a "different" tenderloin recipe, but this is really great! Usually skip the salad, although we like it and find the pork works with a variety of sides. Leftover pork makes for some great fried rice!

I Made this as written but omitted raisins as I didn't have them. It was pretty,the salad was fresh tasting but the seasoning on the pork was over the top. The dish has a lot of strong flavors, but we felt they were pulling against each other in a way we didn't find appealing.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious. I thought it would be a tedious, long cooking endeavor but all the parts can be done simultaneously so didn't take long at all! I cooked the pork only 15 min and it was 155* inside so I'd recommend checking it earlier than 20 min. Also, I didn't have curry powder or raisins but substituted coriander (untoasted) and onions/tomatoes in the salad. Will totally make this again and again.

Best pork recipe out there. Easy, delicious and can be served with anything! I will never make another pork tenderloin recipe.

OMG, this is fantastic! This was on my list to make for years and I'm sorry I waited so long. My husband just loved it. I made it exactly as stated except I omitted the red pepper (don't like), and instead of golden raisins (couldn't find them) I used Sun-Maid FruitBits (mix of raisins, golden raisins, dried apricots, dried apples, peaches, plums & cherries), which added a lot of extra color to the lettuce mix for an even better presentation. This is a great summer recipe that I can't wait to make for guests.

Absolutely fantastic, but I made a few changes though. I used my own spice mix, which comes pretty close to the original mix. Did not make the glaze, used grapefruit instead of oranges, arugula instead of spinach, romaine lettuce instead of cabbage, no bell pepper, dried cranberries instead of the raisins and I also did not use the dijon mustard and curry powder with the vinaigrette, but added a bit of honey and slivers of fresh mint.

This is my 2nd review of this recipe; I LOVE this recipe. It's delicious, beautiful and aromatic. There is a lot of prep to the dish but most of it you can do beforehand. This time I followed another reviewer's advice and served it with the yellow rice and black bean salad found on this website. The appetizer was the mango pomegranite guacamole and desert the mango pineapple lime cheesecake all from this site. My guests thought I was "Martha". :) If you haven't tired this recipe - do so - you won't be disappointed. Thanks Epicurious for a delicious dinner party.

I've made this so many times; both on the grill & in the oven. Only changes I've made to the basic recipe is to use a head of roasted garlic in the glaze & not toast the curry powder for the vinaigrette. The salad is another story - whatever is in season; tonight, instead of oranges & avocado, I used regional strawberries, blueberries, & ground cherries. Such a beautiful dish. Always add almonds & Vidalia onions to the salad to give it extra texture. I also double the vinaigrette. So easy & amazing results.

As a previous reviewer mentioned, everything can be prepped ahead of time up to browning the pork; just pop in the oven before serving and toss the salad together. I also serve this with a side of black beans and rice for a more substantial meal. Great meal for a dinner party, everyone loves it.

I first added this to my favorites in 2005, and have made it many times since. It is absolutely delicious. My husband always says he doesn't want "just salad" for dinner, but he LOVES this, and says it is not "just salad"! It is a great company meal, because it is so beautiful. My guests have raved about it. Plus, you can have the salad and dressing (separately) all ready to go, the oranges cut up, the meat browned, and then all you have to do at the last minute is roast the meat, mix up the salad, cut the avocado (so it doesn't brown) put on a platter, and you're ready to serve with some nice bread or rolls. I also wanted to add that at first I was concerned that it might be spicy with the curry and the tobasco, but it really is not at all. Even my daughter (now 4) has eaten it since she was at least 2 with no problem. On one more note, I've never bothered to toast my curry. I'm sure it would be even better if I did, but it is really, really good without it.

I've had this recipe bookmarked for at least a year and Im sorry I've waited so long to try it. It was excellent. Definitely one of the best new recipes I've tried in awhile. The pork was tender and a good mix of sweet and spicy. I made the salad following the recipe and it too was excellent. I found the dressing to be a bit too tangy but it was perfect once you poured some of the glaze over the salad. It also looks beautiful when you put it all together. The bright colors from the oranges, avocado, spinach and red pepper make it look as fantastic as it tastes.

changed this up for winter and served it instead warm. sauteed veggies, served w/ basmati rice. omit the oil from vinagrette and use a bit of cornstarch or arrowroot to thicken for sauce. you may have to add some sweetener to sauce if serving pork on the side or reserve the brown sugar mix from the pork and add to vinagrette (sauce). finally. no advocado, but baby bok choy and spinach. and slice mandarins thinly - include rind. yum...

I made this for Halloween, and cut out roasted red pepper bats and layered them along with the oranges and avocado in between the sliced pieces of meat to make a snake!

Note: I used Tabasco chipotle instead of regular Tabasco, and it gave it that nice smoky flavor!

Love the tenderloin. But, the glaze was VERY SWEET, needed more spice to offset sweetness. Next time, I will follow one of the reviewers and use half the brown sugar. I would even make the tenderloin without the glaze and just use the spice rub. the fruit from the salad adds a nice sweet contrast

This was absolutely delicious and best of all....very easy. My husband, 13 year old son and 19 year old daughter all loved the pork. I followed the recipe for the rub and the glaze and skipped the dressing because I didn't have the ingredients for the vinagrette. Instead we used Ken's Asian Sesame dressing for the salad and it was perfect. I followed the recipe for the rub and the glaze to a 'T' and when it was done everyone agreed that there were a ton of flavors but they all came together to make the pork absolutely delicious. We improvised with the salad and adapted to the ingredients I had on hand: spinach, cabbage, craisins, toasted almonds and mandarin oranges. YUMMY!!

Beautiful and delicious! I put the salad together about an hour ahead of time, and then presented it to rave reviews.

Great recipe! Love how versatile the salad ingredients can be. Only change was added some acidulated shallots to the dressing and reduced salt 1/4 tsp.

This recipe is a revelation! Because pork tenderloin has so little fat, most recipes call for braising to add flavor. That works flavor-wise but leaves you with a pile of mush that's impossible to present nicely and takes hours. This recipe takes the opposite approach, using a rub for flavor and just enough roasting to ensure the meat is cooked. The result is quick, carve-able, and just delicious! Make it just the way it is once, then adjust the salt and Tabasco down if you like.

This is a fabulous way to make pork tenderloin and a new favorite in our house. The easy and quick recipe yields tender and juicy meat bursting with flavor. So many recipes for pork tenderloin are asian-inspired (e.g. soy or teriyaki based marinade) so this was a welcome change from that. While preparing the dish and tasting the brown sugar glaze, I realized that I really wanted to serve this over sweet potato puree rather than salad. I'm sure the meat is great on salad too, and one day I will try that. However, I wanted a warm and hearty dish, and serving with the sweet potatoes accomplished that. This dish, at least the pork and glaze, is appropriate for a quick family dinner as well as for company. Kudos to Gourmet for coming up with this dish!

I brought this to a pot-luck for 6 women, and guess what dish was gobbled up?? Everyone had two helpings as the rest of the food sat around. I made it exactly as written. I don't know why others used only half the curry...all of it was great. The sweet-garlicy crust on the top of the pork is to- die-for and makes the pork special. I sectioned the oranges instead of slicing only because I didn't pay attention to the directions. And I discovered fabulous sweet navel oranges in August...from Australia! I used a large round platter and filled it with the salad. I laid two rows of sliced pork down the middle, and had two rows on each side of alternating avocado and orange sections. The sectioned oranges (instead of sliced) actually looked good with the avocados because they're about the same shape. I can't wait to make this again. Everyone wants the recipe. Oh I did add just a couple drops of Tabasco to give the dressing a teeny tiny zip. If I remember correctly, one avocado was enough. Be sure to drizzle the meat juice on the slices just before serving as stated in the recipe.

I have made this several times, but last night only had chicken breast and and browned them in a iron skillet then put the skillet on the grill for 10 min and the results were as fantastic as the pork tenderloin. Followed direction excatly. WOW!

This is a wonderful recipe! The vinaigrette was too tart for my taste so I added 2 Tbsp of light brown sugar to the vinaigrette... it was perfect! I also only used 1/2 of the curry powder as others had suggested. Definitely a keeper!

Wow - great recipe, fun to make and beautiful presentation. I wondered what type of side dish to serve with this and finally settled on grilled corn on the cob with lemon herb butter. I thought that it was a great addition to the dinner and added even more color to the presentation. I followed the recipe with very few changes: halved the curry amount; 1 large avocado seemed sufficient, mango instead of oranges, craisins instead of raisins. I would've used pomegranate seeds but they weren't in season. I'll make this dinner again!

Used one tenderloin - so halved recipe and also the following - RUB - used only 1/4 tsp salt and half of everything else. Did not pre- brown, rather - put on rub about 2 hours before (though if having a party etc wouldn't hesitate doinga number of hrs before). Took out of fridge 30 min or so before cooking. Then applied some olive oil to tenderloin then rubbed/patted on the brown sugar mixture. Put on rack on broiler pan. Used probe on the oven and set to convection roast and set probe t internal temp of 140 degrees. Once done, loosely tented with foil for about 15 min - absolutely perfect doneness. Changes here for GLAZE - used Frank's instead of tabasco - great. VINEGAIRETTE - made the following adjustments - reduced to 2T of lime juice (given previous reviewers saying too tart), 1/4 tsp salt and the rest as written. No problem making this in advance. SALAD - reduced to 2 mandarins,used green leaf lettuce, one avocado, added toasted pine nuts (fab add), omitted the raisins, cabbage. Absolutely fabulous. Whole family loved it. Served also with mango salsa (made as a hedge in case salad/dressing didn't turn out) - it was good but not necessary given how delicious the salad is. I wasn't going to make the salad/dressing given previous reviews but so glad I did - it made the meal and complemented the pork flavours. Wouldn't do one without the other.

Rating: 4
This was outstanding! Made the tenderloin alone first, then used the leftovers (chilled overnight in the fabulous glaze) to make the salad the second day. I make my DH 'grade' meals so I know whether to make them again, and this received a rare A+!! Also very easy and quick - this will go in the 'company' file.

Because I was making this for the first time, I followed the recipe to the letter. I loved the vinaigrette, but might add a little brown sugar or honey to sweeten it just a tad. We had our favorite "taste and tell" friend for dinner and she was in love with it. We will definately make this again.

Rating: 4
I've been making this salad since it first was published. It's one of my husband's favorites. One thing I've always been a little confused about is the time given for making this. I make it according to the recipe and am able to do so within an hour and I am not what you would call a quick cook!

Rating: 4
as in other reviews, I would say the pork is outstanding. I did everything on the grill, doing the last part in a pan lined with alum. foil to avoid sticky mess. The only thing I would change is the vinaigrette. Needs to be sweeter-added honey, but have much tastier recipes.

Made this for my Japanese daughter-in- law last Sunday (she gave me my first grandson 9lbs 13 oz, 22 1/2 inches long on previous Monday). She loved it. I substituted dried cherries for the raisins. My son and 3 year old granddaughter loved it, too. Great flavors, textures - delicious!

Made this for the second time last night. Only changes I made this time were to sub "Newman's Own Light Raspberry & Walnut Dressing" for the vinaigrette and bagged fresh Italian Blend Salad (from W/M) for the Napa cabbage. Again, this is an EXCEPTIONAL recipe. Do try it--the flavors blend wonderfully. Served it with fresh baguette bread. YUMMY meal.

I made the pork only. It was delicious and easy. Since it is winter, I served it with applesauce, which was a great accompaniment. I halved the amount of sugar and would lessen the salt next time. I will try it with the salad in the summer. I gave it three forks because it was delicious, but didn't knock me out.

I saw that this recipe had a record number of comments, and tried it out of curiosity. Wow, everyone I've served it to LOVES it! I don't rate too many recipes 4 forks. I made absolutely no changes. I agree with a previous reviewer that this contains lots of sugar, and the greens of the salad are important in cutting that sweet taste. I didn't pack down the brown sugar, so i may have used less than the recipe called for.

Phenominal recipe. I serve the tenderloin on its own without the salad. My family and co-workers can't get enough. They always request it for special occassions.

This is one of the all-time best recipes. The pork also freezes well. Coat the pork with the spice rub, brown it and then let it cool before putting it in a freezer bag. Mix together the glaze and add to the pork. When ready to cook, just let the pork defrost in the fridge for about a day, pour everything into a roasting dish and carry on with the rest of the recipe.

Excellent and refreshing entree salad. Visually beautiful. The salt/cumin/chili/cinnam on rub recipe has become a pre-mixed staple on my spice shelf, as it works well on both pork and chicken. Regarding the salad dressing, I use Rajah's Tandori Masala mix for the 'curry' as I enjoy it's foenugreek forward flavor.

As others had mentioned, the rub is excellent on pork chops. However, cut way back on the salt. As it, it's too salty for pork chops. Best to mix all the rub ingredients except for the salt, and then sprinkle each piece with salt to taste after the rub is on. Serve with mango salsa on this site from Bon Appetit 97. Excellent!

Rating: 4
This was a little more prep and prepare work than I thought it might be.. but it was worth the effort! Very good entree salad! Next time I will make the vinaigrette the day before, and double or triple the batch as we really liked the flavor of citrus and the mustard curry which was very good! Using tenderloins was a great choice due to the tenderness and flavor.. I would love to try this will a firm fish or even chicken. It is really very, very good!

Rating: 4
We have made this several times. We discovered that, although it can be made in advance, cooking and slicing the pork just before serving is preferable. We have also successfully served the pork on spinach and avocado slices with vinaigrette, accompanied by Peach Salsa which we purchase at Cosco - delicious!

This is an exceptional dish! I read some of the reviews before I made it, and craisins are a phenomenal switch. I also stick with papaya and overlay pork, papaya and avacado to give it quite the aestetic appeal. If you're looking for a dish to impress family or friends with flavor and appearance, look no further. One of my friends doesn't eat pork, so i made theirs with chicken and it was incredible that way too!

I do not know why this is so good but it is. I thought the brown sugar coating was too sweet but somehow it blended with the other flavors. I do think the salad is necessary to cut some of the pork's sweetness.

I have served this salad several times to a multicultural crowd so used chicken breast instead of pork t-loin. Turned out BEAUTIFULLY. Still pan-fried for 2 mins/side, then roasted for 15 mins and let stand for 10 mins. Chicken was juicy and the pan juices were a perfect syrupy consistency. Otherwise, followed the recipe (minus the red peppers - not fans). It was stunning. It is a staple in our showstopper summer salad collection which includes Grilled Cajun Chicken Salad with Spicy Ranch Dressing.

I'm amazed to see any negative reviews of this salad, as it is one of my husband's and my favorite dishes. The sweetness of the sugary pork crust is delicious with the citrus ingredients in the salad. The avocado adds a wonderful texture and a nice contrast in taste to the other very flavorful ingredients. The dressing has a wonderful indian-like flavor to it - we lick our plates it's so good!

I've had this one saved in my recipe box for a long time, waiting for the opportunity to try it. After all the rave reviews, I was so disappointed in the results. Quite simply, it didn't blow my dress up! In my humble opinion, there are so many other pork tenderloin recipes on this site that are way better. Since I cook from this site several times a week, and always appreciate the reviews, it only seemed fair to throw in my comments. Usually, we love everything that other reviewers have given 3 or 4 forks, but this one certainly didn't measure up in our standards. Oh well, you can't always get a winner.

I have NEVER made the salad since my husband is a "meat and potatoes" type of individual. I have been making this for a few years as it has become a staple in my house. My husband begs me to make this. Don't make the salad, serve it with mashed potatoes for the perfect meal!

This is an exceptional pork tenderloin recipe. My 13 year old son said it was the best meat I have ever made. The only thing I did differently was put a small amount of water in the bottom of the pan when I placed it in the oven The salad and dressing were very good too but you could just make the pork and serve it with other sides.

Rating: 4
I've made this twice. The first time I made it exactly according to the recipe and the second time I left out the raisins and used spring greens instead of cabbage. Both were phenomenal as the real hit of this dish is the pork itself. The method used in this recipe to cook pork tenderloin produces the most juicy and tender pork ever! Its easy for company in the summer and guarantees no leftovers.

Rating: 3
This was an excellent light but elegant summer dinner for guests. Everyone cleaned their plates and had seconds. I made it several hours before serving and refrigerated it until about 45 minutes before, so that the meat would not be stone cold. I enjoy making meals for company that don't require that I be busy in the kitchen when the guests are arriving. I did not deviate from the recipe except that I found that I was out of Tabasco sauce at the last moment, so I substituted a tablepoon of ketchup, a dash of vinegar and a pinch of cayenne pepper. This didn't seem to affect the recipe, and I will certainly make this meal again.

Rating: 3
I cleaned my plate in a jiff. Either I was really hungry or the pork was delicious. Maybe a little bit of both. I loved it, and so easy to prepare. I like using the combination of a dry rub for depth in flavour, and a glaze for sauciness. The salad dressing was so-so, but still good nonetheless.

Rating: 4
This pork is extremely delicious. EVERY time I make this recipe for new people they rave about it and ask for the recipe. I generally make just the pork recipe and serve it with couscous. I didn't care for the taste of the salad dressing. It does make for a beautiful presentation to serve it with the salad. I place the sliced pork in the center of a large platter and arrange the salad around it. Then I use a citrus vinaigrette.

Honestly....this is one of the most incredible pork recipes I've ever had. I do a lot of cooking, and lately my thing has been trying to find the perfect pork recipe. This is by far it. The pork was so moist, tender, and juicy. The salad was wonderful too, but you really could do the pork by itself. Making it with the salad was almost an overburst of flavors, (and I love flavor!). I did try the vinaigrette, and thought that it needed a little something extra, so I followed another reviewers advice and added maple syrup. Only do 1 Tbsp though b/c anything more and it will be too sweet. The pork is sweet enough. Unbelievable recipe. My fiancee and roomate said it is by far the best pork dish I've made. Two BIG thumbs up.

We were invited to the neighbors for a cookout last week and I said I'd bring the meat. I put the rub on 2 tenderloins and brought the glaze, patting it on with a fork when the pork was on the grill. I put a sheet of tinfoil under the meat to keep the neighbors grill clean and it turned out delicious. My husband thought I was bringing way too much meat for 4 adults ("do we really need both tenderloins?" ) and there was not one speck of meat left.

This recipe was delicious. I took another reviewers suggestion and used Mango's in place of the Oranges and Craisen's in place of the Raisen's. I would do the same again. I served it with Sweet Potato Fries (seasoned with Cumin, Chili Powder, Salt & Pepper), and Hawaian Rolls. It was a huge hit and great leftovers. It was a bit on the spicy side for one young child (I may have been too liberal with the Tabasco Sauce). An excellent summer dinner with a beautiful presentation for company and unusual flavors.

This recipe inspired me to write my first epicurious review. Absolutely Scrumptious! It makes an impressive and colorful plate.

The combination of sweet and savory is just wonderful. I have served it with the Coconut Bread (but do add the Buttermilk suggested by one of the reviewers). For the "gunk on the grill" complainers, I suggest searing the tenderloin in a heavy pan on the top of the stove and then cooking in the oven in that same pan. You can really acheive the same affect as grilling if you can get a good high gas heat, AND you save all of that wonderful sweet sauce to be part of the dish and drizzle when you serve. All I can say is UMMMMMMMMMMMM....

This really turned out well. I didn't follow the recipe exactly - I used a homemade honey balsalmic dressing for the salad and peaches and apricots instead of oranges. A great combination and a perfect alternative to apples and onions.

this is a great recipe! i swiched the oranges for mangos and the raisins for pinenuts and it worked out really well.

Looked very pretty, and I liked the pork. I didn't care for the vinaigrette (and neither did my guests, unfortunately), and that marred an otherwise okay (not extraordinary) dish.

Just made the pork on the BBQ. A bit messy, yes, but really good. Although I fussed around with it this time, next time I will do the following: sear the tenderloin on all sides, place some of the sugar mix on top, grill for a few minutes, turn the meat and place more mix on the other side and let it cook. That way the sugar coats most of the tenderloin and you don't have a big blob of sugar mix dripping in your grill. Pork came out very tender and slightly crunchy on the outside. Will certainly make again!

It was just o.k. I thought. I'm a little surprised that it had so many great reviews. I made it on the grill and about 3/4 of the way through put foil underneath the meat and then put the glaze on so it didn't just melt away. I thought the dressing was too sour and the meat was just so-so.

I made this salad for my girlfriend, who has a healthy appetite as a rugby player. She was floored! I made a few little additions which worked out great: I used dried cranberries instead of raisins in the salad for a bolder taste, as well as some crumbled goat cheese and shredded carrot for color. The goat cheese really complimented the curry in the dressing. This is the best tasting salad I've ever made. Next time, I will try using less oil in the vinaigrette, and add some coconut milk for a nice tropical variation. Pine nuts would also add to the texture.

I have been hesitating to make this dish because it just didn't sound good to me, despite the outstanding reviews. Well, I'm so glad I finally did becauses the dry rub and glaze are out of this world. I did not love the dressing and would probably use different salad ingredients next time (although I liked the oranges, raisins and spinach), but the pork itself is a keeper. The spicy and sweet flavors work perfectly together. We grilled it instead of using the oven. I am going to try the spice rub and glaze on other meats as well.

Good recipe. Made it on the grill; and after searing with the rub placed with glaze on aluminum foil at, to avoid a mess. Did not care so much for the red peppers and will leave them out in the future. Also used dried cranberries instead of raisins.

This was a wonderful dish! Made it as part of a Father's Day meal for my husband. He loved it. (We started with the chilled asparagus soup with timable of caviar, crab, and avacado and ended with the flourless chocholate cake -- both recipes on this site too). The Pork was wonderful. The rub and glaze were perfect. Use the best and freshest ingredients you can --- good, high quality spices -- and good quality pork. Of course, don't overcook the pork! You will be very pleased!

I am a fourteen year old aspiring chef. I loved this recipe! It was so easy and yet very full of flavor. I got rave reviews from both my parents. HINT: Also, I left out the curry (my mom isn't a big curry fan), and it enhanced the flavor of the pork even more. It was great!

Perfect. I made it for a dinner party, to rave reviews from all, esp. my husband. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I didn't toast the curry and cooked the tenderloins about 15 extra minutes after the temperature didn't seem to rise after taking it out.

I brought this to a memorial day picnic and people are still raving! I did the tenderloins on the grill. I found the glaze a little awkward to work with at first, but once it started to melt it was perfect. The flavors are wonderful. I chilled the pork after cooking and sliced it thinly and placed it over the tossed salad. The only thing I had to tinker with was the dressing (I think the lime I used was too sour). Try this recipe!

Did not really care for either the pork or the salad. I made everything just like the recipe said - this just wasn't a hit for me or for my husband and kids. The salad dressing needed something to sweeten it up. Would not make this again.

I made this on the grill. First I applied the dry rub and seared the meat directly over the coals. I then moved it to the indirect-heat part of the grill, applied the brown sugar mixture, and cooked to 140. It was delicious and grilling it makes it a perfect summer dish. I have to say, I didn't really see the point in "toasting" the curry powder. It just adds a step, smells a little bad, and, to me, tastes exactly the same.

Served this to a dinner party to rave reviews. I started with a vichyssoise as a first course, paired the pork salad with a black bean and rice salad on this website, and served with a dry reisling.

I made this again last night, as usual to rave reviews from all (even my hard-to-please sister-in-law). I did make a few changes due to what I had available. I subbed red leaf lettuce for the napa cabbage, tangerines for the oranges, dried sweetened cranberries for the raisins, and I added thinly sliced red onion. I missed the napa cabbage, both for the look and the crunchy texture, but much prefer the dried cranberries to the raisins, they were great! I used dried cranberries from the natural foods store NOT "Craisins" which I find too sweet. Both hubby and I agree next time we will go back to the cabbage but stick with the craisins and the addition of the red onion. This is one of my favorite recipes. I have used the spice rub and glaze with chicken breasts with equal success.

This was FANTASTIC!!! Due to items on hand, my salad consisted of fresh spinach, brown raisins, jarred roasted red peppers, avocados, mandarin oranges, and Wish-Bone red wine vinaigrette (It was good, but next time I will use some Napa cabbage, as I think the crunch would make it even better.). Followed the pork portion of the recipe as written. However, I must have over-browned the tenderloins on top of the stove because after 20 minutes in the oven, the thermometer read 162+ degrees F. I really thought I had wrecked dinner, but the loins were still very moist and juicy. Needless to say, we did not tent them and let them sit--we just ate!!! Served this with Ore-Ida Golden Crinkles, and it was a very satisfying meal.

STUNNING! I took the recipie as is for the dressing, rub & glaze, but modified it as such and am absolutely blown away... 1) Skipped the cabbage, used red leaf and more spinach 2) Skipped the raisins and orange and subbed in fresh papaya, guava and strawberry, gave it more of a tropical feel 3) Served over Jasmine rice, poured meat juices over meat (on rice) when served 4) Marinated pork before rubbing in soy, white vinegar & garlic Turned out PERFECT... Served with Savioun Blanc and called it a nite... cant wait to do this again!

Have made this dish a few times now and we love it more every time. I love to eat the glaze that drips off the pork and hardens into spicy rock-candy. We even had leftover pork which went into sandwiches today with baby spinach, tomato, and horseradish mustard on wheat bread. Delicious!

Not that this needs another review but...the pork is incredible. Made it twice, the last time for company. I thought there would be leftovers, but everyone sat around the platter after we were "done" and continued to take "just one more piece", dipped in the juices, until it was gone! For the salad I simply used mixed baby greens with the dressing for asian spinach salad(on this site). Huge hit.

I have made this recipe several times - with and without the salad. The pork is always delicious, but sometimes the dressing for the salad can be a tad bit bitter, so recently I tried another reviewer's suggestion (1/2c white wine vinegar, 2/3 c salad oil, 2-3 T Major Grey's chutney, 1+ t curry, 1 t dry mustard, 1 t salt, 1 t hot pepper sauce - combine/shake and let stand a room temp for 2 hrs). Thank you for that recipe - it is PERFECT for this salad!!!

Yum! I halved this recipe for me and my husband and it was very good! I substituted arugula for the baby spinach and after we pulled the tenderloin out of the oven, we deglazed the pan on the stovetop with some brandy (Madeira wine would probably work too) and made a bowl of dipping sauce for the pork. It was great -- give it a try!

Absolutely fantastic recipie. I made this dinner for my boyfriend and my parents, and everyone loves it. I cut the tabasco down to about a teaspoon, and didn't use any garlic - but I don't think the dish missed it. I also used mandarin oranges instead for a little extra sweetness. I would absolutely make this again, and I may try the spice rub on chicken or pork ribs on the grill this summer.

This was absolutely delicious. Based on the other reviewer's opinions that the vinaigrette was too tart, I added about a tablespoon of honey and the vinaigrette was wonderful. We loved this salad, it was interesting and the pork tenderloin was incredible (I can see making the pork without the salad). Although my husband thought this was great, I'm not sure his appetite was quenched which I think is because the overall salad was slightly sweet -- I'll try another reviewer's idea of a curried ranch dressing instead of the vinaigrette next time which may make this a bit more savory. As is, it is a definite keeper.

Rating: 2
I wanted to like this recipe after reading the other reviews but I think this salad has so many competing flavors it just tastes muddled. The spice rub is good, and this is a great way to cook a tenderloin, but the glaze is extremely sweet. Maybe with much less sugar, and a simpler salad, and mangos instead of oranges....

My 13 year old son and I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe, although I've only made the pork not the whole salad as it's not really salad weather here. The only change I made was to use use chipotle tabasco sauce and did not toast the curry. Otherwise excellent!!

Every time we make this dish it is a HIT! We decrease the tabasco sauce to 1/4 tsp since our daughter is not fond of spicy foods and it is still delicious. Also we frequently make the pork rub & glaze without the salad. With sweet potatoes and asparagus, it is pretty good.

This was OK. Like others, it just didn't live up to all the hype. If I try this again, I will not use Lean Generations pork tenderloin, it made the meat too salty even though I omitted the salt in the spice rub.

Liked the pork a lot. Yes, it is sweet, but I thought that was balanced out by the saltiness and spiciness of the first layer. I only used half the sugar since other people found it so sweet. Didn't care for the salad dressing -- too mustardy, and the lime and orange juice didn't come through. If I were to do it as a salad again, I'd do a citrus vinaigrette, maybe including the curry. But I'd probably just make the pork as a main dish and abandon the salad concept.

This was good, but it didn't live up to the hype of all the fabulous reviews. It's very distinctive tasting--not my favorite and neither was it my husband's and we're both very adventurous eaters. I guess if I was expecting an ok dish I may have been wowed.

This was really great, though I omitted the avocado (didn't have any) and the raisins (forgot them!). Also used mango instead of orange (fantastic!). My husband usually doesn't eat main dish salads or meat w/ fruit, but he loved this dish. I served his salad to the side of the meat, but when he saw me eat mine as a composed salad, he tried it that way, too...and loved it! The meat was wonderfully juicy and spicy...I didn't find it too sweet or candy-like...then again, I didn't use all the glaze. Great flavors...if you don't have all the salad ingredients, go with what you've got or just make the meat on its own.

Don't leave out the raisins as their sweetness adds a nice touch. I will use the rub & glaze on a pork loin sometime and serve it with rice.

EXCELLENT SUMMER SALAD!!! I made it for my father-in-law who is into low carb, and he raved about it. Even my 2 year old loved the salad part. I made the glaze and rub in advance and used them for two different dinner parties. Now I keep the rub spices in their own container.

Oh. My. Gosh. Hands down the best reaction I've ever had from company. I LOVED this salad. The rub and glaze for the pork is wonderful - I will make that again separately. But I loved the salad with it, too. I had everything prepped and so the salad came together easily while the prok was cooking. Presentation on a platter was beautiful. I did make the coconut bread but made it less sweet than the recipe calls for by using unsweetened coconut - and it was a great accompaniment. Overall, a wonderful dinner and I can't wait to eat the leftover pork! I will make this again and again. Minor notes - I reduced the brown sugar in the glaze to about 2/3 cup and I didn't toast the curry because I forgot. I also didn't read ahead and tossed the salad with all of the vinaigrette - but it turned out to be fine (I probably used more spinach and cabbage than the recipe calls for so it wasn't overdressed). Then I just poured the pan drippings over the pork slices and that was perfect. I did soak the raisins in light rum - that was a nice kick.

A must-try recipe. Next time I might use a chutney vinaigrette from another recipe; a bit of sweetness in the dressing would be good in my opinion (in blender: 2 Tbsp. lemon juice, 1 Tbsp. red wine vinegar, 2 Tbsp. mango chutney, 1/2 tsp curry powder, pinch cayenne, 1/8 tsp. turmeric, 1/4 tsp. sugar, 1/4 tsp. salt, 6 Tbsp. oil). I cooked the pork outside on the grill, browning it first then placing it on a piece of oiled foil before adding brown sugar glaze. Shut off the burner directly under the pork and rolled it around in the brown sugar mixture as it cooked. Wonderful. Rave reviews from guests.

I used leftover pork loin chops that I had already grilled, encrusted with cumin and coriander seed. It worked well. I found the vinaigrette a bit too mild so I used 50% more curry. THat worked just fine. I used a bottled blend curry (Fauchon Medium). I would also use more oranges next time. We'll do this again but not for several months. We liked it but it's not the sort of things that I'd want to eat regularly.

Wonderful!! The pork is so flavorful and moist and most of the ingredients are a pantry staple. An excellent elegant dish that would be great for a dinner party. The only slight change I may make is to cut down a tad on the Tabasco sauce. The pork was a little on the hot side, however, I'm pretty much a wimp when it comes to heat - other than that, this was fairly simple, and delicious. This is certainly in my top ten of favorite recipes.

What's great about this recipe is that it can be prepped way ahead, has no odd ingredients that a guest might not like, is not high fat/carbs (again for your unkown guests) and is gorgeous on the plate.

Great dish, substituted mango for oranges with delicious results - only change I would make is that we thought the flavor of the avocados was lost amongst the other very strong flavors so wouldn't waste a good avocado next time -

I finally decided to make this after all of the reviews. My only change would be to add a bit of sugar to the dressing, as I thought it was a bit acidic. Other than that, great combo, perfect for a summer dinner.

This salad is wonderful! I didn't have cabbage and used baby greens, and while they tasted fine, they didn't hold up to the dressing as well as cabbage would. Guests raved about this. I had a hard time keeping the men out of the kitchen long enough to plate the pork without them eating it off the cutting board! Definately make it, and do it as is!

Excellent recipe. I followed recipe exactly, with the exception of toasting the curry. A big hit with all.

Yet another recipe that allows me to break free of the saying 'Never try a new dish when having company'. I scoff at that! Because of Epicurious' rating system, I almost always try new recipes when having guests for dinner. This dish received great reviews from all. Most of us decided it was better than Roast Pork Calypso Style, which is one of my all time favorite pork tenderloin recipes. This is a no muss, no fuss recipe that will garner compliments all night long. All of the ingredients are easy to find if they're not already in your pantry or refrigerator.

I have made this recipe twice for bridal shower luncheons for 30 women each time to rave reviews. I used mesclun salad mix as well as the spinach and napa cabbage. I substituted strawberries for the avocados and served it with the coconut bread. Everyone loved the salad, the pork tenderloin and the coconut bread, even those that didn't like curry. Toasting the curry is important. I gave out many copies of the recipe. I will make this many, many more times.

Made this recipe for about the twentieth time last Saturday - again to rave reviews. It is the perfect company dish. Still haven't gotten around to making the coconut bread to go with it, but I'll do that next time. It is, to date, my most requested repeat recipe from my regular guests. It's the perfect company meal - enough do-ahead that you can enjoy your guests, and a fast enough cook and beautiful presentation to impress. What else could you ask for?

OK, yes, this recipe IS worth making - for no other reason than the pork - what a great way to prepare tenderloin. Would be a good dish for guests - it's beautiful on the platter. Next time I'll add some toasted almonds for a little crunch.

Delicious! I cooked the pork to med rare a day before and took the makings to a friend's house for a girls' night in. We all loved it. Followed recipe except I roasted the red peppers, added more lemon and a little honey to the dressing, and for the greens used a mixture of Napa cabbage, romaine and spinach. Can't wait to make again!

I highly recommend this recipe. I have made several pork tenderloin dishes, and this one of the best. You can't get enough of the sauce!! Keep in mind that the dressing for the salad is different, but it goes really well with the pork. I will definitely make this again.

Wow! This was the perfect hot weather dinner! I used one reviewer's suggestion and soaked the raisins (regular, not golden) in rum before adding to the dish - yum! I did use romaine instead of cabbage and there were no leftovers. The flavors were fantastic. Absolutely delicious!

I just made this dish and it is amazing!!! Now I would like to get the other dishes that were recommended if it was in fact part of a gourmet menu. I searched on MAY 2003 Gourmet, but I can't really tell what dishes were suppose to "go" with this outstanding salad. SO far I have deduced coconut bread, shrimp/mango wraps, bbq ribs and maybe the key lime pie. Does anyone know for sure what the menu was? Thanks sooooo much. This dish is amazing! CW

After watching the reviews for this recipe for 2 years, I finally made it; it was even better than I thought it would be. I followed the recipe exactly (except didn't add salt). Husband, who hates curry, said it was a keeper. Nappa cabbage was hard to find but I think cabbage would fare better than romaine in the leftovers. The only reason there are leftovers is because I am dieting!

Rating: 4
Are you all crazy? I was a chef for years and this recipe is almost perfect as is. I used Romaine instead of the cabbage. It was more moist. I also mascerated the raisins in rum before using, to add more Island taste. Otherwise, if you leave out any of the ingredients, they don't compliment each other...the sweet oranges and raisins against the acidity of the dressing. The dressing takes away the heat of the pork. This was an absolutely fabulous recipe...but only for the adventurous of palate.It's also important to serve the pork warm and medium to medium rare. I only wish that I had thought of it. PS...If you like strange but good combos check out the mint, cucumber, curry and onion appetizer. It's delicious.

Rating: 3
I know, I know, I changed almost all the ingredients, but I still have to rate this recipe, because it is a great take-off (and ending!) point for any summer entree salad. I started with leftover shredded orange-chipotle pork that had been slowcooked. Since the flavorings were a little different than called for in the recipe, I added cumin, chili powder and cinnamon to the existing dressing recipe. For the salad, I used what I already had: red leaf lettuce, green bell pepper, avocado, mango, and cantaloupe, tossed with dressing, topped with the shredded pork and drizzle of dressing. Delicious and still close to the original inspiration.

Rating: 4
Have made this salad 3 or 4 times now-- is wonderful company dish- always gets raves... I use a dressing that someone put in their review below a few pages...it uses chutney and it really is good with this salad. I use mandarin oranges just to reduce less prep time and add almond slices..

Rating: 3
I have made this 3 times now. Once as a main dish no salad and 2 times with the salad. I didn't care for the vinagarette, so used my own. Everything else is great. I have a diabetic friend so I used the Sugar Twin Brown Sugar. It works just fine. For a party, I make the tender early in the day, under cook slightly, and reheat in micro just before serving. Also have the salad prepped and ready to go. This has been a hit wiht everyone and it goes together so easily. Made the coconut bread and it was good too.

Rating: 4
This dish has many layers of flavor, that meld perfectly. Don't be afraid to experiment with the salad, this recipe is very forgiving. I replaced the raisins and peppers with red onions. The raisins took away from the pork glaze. A must though is to toast the curry powder, it gives an incredible nutty flavor to the dressing. I would suggest though, if possible, to toast more than needed for another time and seal in a jar. The aroma is VERY strong when heated and lingers for awhile. Not a bad thing but scary the first time.

Rating: 4
This really is as good as everyone says, and it takes far less work than first appears. I also do not use curry powder in the dressing, and I use thai chili garlic sauce in place of tobasco (cut back a bit on the chopped garlic to compensate) works beautifully. Perfect summer dish, and can even be made after a full day at work.

Rating: 4
This was a good as everyone says. We put pork over mesculin salad and used only one organge because that is all we had. Definitely dress the salad with the dressing, place pork over salad and then drizzle glaze on top. I was not sure about the vinagarette when I tasted it separately, but when it was all put together it was amazing. My husband and guests thought it was terrific.

I am making the dish again tonight! It was absolutely divine! I used red cabbage instead of green and no red pepper and the resulting play of colors was quite lovely. I also probably will make less of the salad, the first time, the amount of veggies compared to the meat was a little out of proportion. Just delightful, enjoy!

Rating: 3
This recipe always seems to be in the Constant Comment section, so I finally tried it out to see what the hooplah was about. I followed the recipe to the letter except that I used radicchio instead of cabbage & unintentionally omitted the raisins. The pork was delicious--my favorite part was the spicy candied garlic bits--but the salad dressing was just OK. As another reader mentioned, it could be the quality of the curry powder used. I still have 1/2 a tenderloin for leftovers and I will tinker with the dressing--probably some vinegar is needed. I would also omit the avocado. On the other hand, I'm not a fan of bell peppers in salad but they work perfectly with this one. I think because their flavor usually dominates but here it is matched with other strong flavors.

It's the first time I give a recipe 4 forks! Fantastic! I was worried that it would be too sweet (1c. brown sugar). So I just drizzled a little of the glaze on the pork when I served it and it was perfect.

This was excellent! I made the pork by the recipe and it was perfect. The salad I made differently. Basically my favorite salad - greens, grape tomatoes, crumbled blue, avocado, cucumbers and diced red peppers. For the dressing I just made balsamic vinegar, olive oil and a little orange juice. It was perfect! Very light and summery. I will absolutely make this again. Even just the pork alone.

I make a similar recipe that I received from an Ontario Liquor Control Board Cookbook and its very good too. To this recipe I added poppyseeds (2 tsps), mango, cucumber and papaya with a small amount of red onion and 1 tbsp honey. Try this combination for the dressing. Don't use the cabbage and spinach. Now that I have almost totally changed this recipe its a hit. Fabulous!

I made this tonight and got rave reviews. I added a sliced mango to the salad. I made the plates individually, rather than one large platter. On each plate, I served the pork slices on top of a hockey-puck sized piece of fried polenta in the middle of the plate, surrounded by the salad. This is a great recipe. Give yourself more than 1 1/4 hours, though; there's a lot to do.

This is the second time I have made this dish. This time I omited the raisins, because I am not crazy about them. We had guests over for a late lunch so for timing sake I made the pork tenderloin in the morning, a bit underdone and put it in the slow cooker on "warm" until it was time to eat. This was a great way to do it! When the guests arrived all I had to do was assemble the salad and slice the meat. In the excitement of it all though I totally forgot to drizzle the meat with the sauce. No one seemed to miss it though. I will continue to make this for a hearty lunch for us and our guests. Its absolutely delicious!

We love this dish. I cut down the brown sugar so to get a spicy syrup to pour over the pork after it sliced and on the salad. If you reduce the olive oil in the dressing, it is very health.

If eating the pork w/o the salad, the pork is a bit too sweet. However, the sourness of the vinagrette and the flavors of the veggies cut the sweetness perfectly. A really, really tasty, flavorful dish.

I decided to grill the tenderloins. I used the rub on them, seared the outside, and then left it on the gril at medium for about 25 min. For an easier dinner, (and trying to make a 3yr old and my non-sugar eating husband happy), I didn't put the brown sugar on in the grill (or make the salad). Instead, after it sat for the 10 min, i took those juices, heated them with the brown sugar, and poured over for those who wanted it. It was Still very tasty.

I don't usually give four fork reviews, but this was very good. The pork was moist and the spice/glaze mix gave it exceptional flavor. I only had an orange, mango, and avocado to add to the salad (no pepper or raisins), but it turned out great. Oh-I didn't use cabbage or spinach for the salad, but a bag of fancy salad greens and then halved the dressing. Great.

After reading all the great reviews, I was quite disappointed after making this. While the pork was quite nice, if a bit overwhelmed by the spices, the salad was not great and the olive oil in the dressing was too strong for the lime/orange juices.Wouldn't bother with it again.

This is a fantasic dish. The whole assemblage of wonderful, succulent spicy-sweet pork and the beautiful, Christmasy-looking salad is gorgeous. Heed this advice: You need a humongous platter to put this all on, if you put it on just one platter (you could use two or three, really). Unlike one reviewer, I poured all the pork glaze on top of the pork on the salad and loved it, but it does add a lot of sweetness, as that reviewer pointed out. This is a terribly pretty and delectable dish -- and is tremendously impressive.

The flavours in the dish are extremely exotic - something we very much enjoyed. However, when I served this, I poured the rest of the glaze over top of the pork.

This being said, the salad dressing was amazing and the spice rub was great; the pork turned out very moist.

As many others said, this recipe is fabulous. I followed the directions exactly with the exception of the golden raisins -- I used regular ol' brown ones, plumped first in the microwave using the extra oj. I served this with the coconut rice from this site, which was a great compliment. Next time I won't bother with baby spinach. I think mature spinach with its heavier texture and darker color will work better with the napa cabbage. A fabulous recipe.

I have enjoyed this recipe many times now and have only one comment. No need to make quite so much glaze for the pork. A bit wastefull. Ok, two comments. I skipped the cabbage and used all spinach. I have served it for two up to eight. Worked just as well in numbers.

I made the pork loin as a main dish two weeks ago for my parents and they loved it so much they asked me to make it for the whole family on Labor Day (today).

My whole family (sisters, brothers, neices and nephews, etc.) loved it both ways. The salad really does have an impressive and attractive presentation.

This was a great way to serve a salad and some protein for dinner. Great color and a wonderful mix of flavors. Something must be wrong with my pork roasting technique, however. In all pork tenderloin recipes I've tried, I've had to just about double the cooking time to have fully cooked meat. That aside, this was great!

The tenderloin smelled bad before I made this so a quick run to the store netted us some pork medallions instead. Still was fantastic. Added a lot more tabasco then called for, but it worked out very well (if you like it spicy.) Don't let the long recipe scare you off, this is a very simple dish. Segmenting the oranges was the only thing I considered laborous at all. The salad is now a staple at our house.

Delicious! I added lime and orange zest to the dressing and doubled the dressing recipe, added mango to the salad, and used sriracha instead of tabasco in the glaze, but everything else I did per the recipe and it was great. One of my guests is notoriously picky, and even she loved it.

This dish had my friend licking the plate, literally. I made a fairly major modification though. I used Beef Tenderloin (filet mignon) about 1 to 1.5 inches thick. Cook them in a pan 3 minutes per side, glaze it and put it in 450 degree oven for 6 to 8 minutes (for medium rare to medium). Kept rest of recipe the same. Very, very delicious.

This recipe was a magnificent centerpiece and showstopper at a dinner party this weekend at the beach. The flavor of the dish was simply remarkable. I used my electric rotisserie on the grill, cooking a 3.5 lb center loin on hi for about 10-15 minutes and low for the remainder until meat thermometer reached 140. I basted every 15 minutes with the brown sugar glaze. After the meat rested, I cut and drizzled a generous amount of the dressing over the meat, accompanied with grilled corn on the cob and a rough diced tomato/avocado mixture side tossed in the same vinagrette. Not a scrap of meat remained. I'll make this again before end of summer!

Rarely do I give a four forks review, but this one is definitely worthy of one. Presentation was beautiful; taste was outstanding. Served it to guests and everyone went back for seconds. Served with black beans from Cooks Illustrated and baked polenta cakes from Barefoot Contessa. Great make-ahead dinner. I agree with previous reviewers about the roasting time---I pulled mine out at 15 mins and it was perfect---used both, an oven and meat thermometer. Also reduced brown sugar to 3/4 cups. Didn't bother toasting the curry. Will make this one again and again.

I don't do too much commenting but this is super!Don't waste your time on the salad. This great for a main course with coconut rice with black beans and sauteed asparagus with ginger and tangerine juice. I used the new chipotle tobasco and only 2/3 cup brown sugar and it was fantastic.

Rating: 4
Delicious! Definite keeper. Flavors are marvelous and the "sear-roasting" technique makes for moist and tender results. Not nearly as difficult as the length of the recipe implies. I thought the 1 cup of brown sugar called for was far too much and used perhaps 1/3 cup, which turned out great. I'm not a huge fan of cumin so decreased the cumin to 1/2 tsp. I think the reader who added ground ginger has a good idea and will try that next time. Also, I think the 20 minutes of roasting time in the recipe would be far too long. I roasted mine for 12 minutes, basted with pan glaze after removing from oven, and after standing was done to perfection (slightly pink inside). I love lime, so increased the lime juice to 4 TB and didn't toast the curry powder. I served this with jasmine rice cakes (leftover rice formed into cakes with a little beaten egg, salt and pepper, and sauteed to brown). Before serving, I brushed the rice cakes with some of the glaze from the pan. I think a wonderful dish for company on a summer's day.

WOW, What a recipe! I made this last night for my family, and it was a hit, although my two little ones just ate the pork. I didn't have any oranges, so I used strawberries, and left out the red bell pepper because I knew my kids would not eat it. Wonderful recipe, can't wait to cook it again.

Mde this last night and agree that it is a fantastic meld of flavour and texture and oh so pretty to look at!. Only change I made was cutting down the brown sugar to about 1/4 cup.( I prefer more it more spicy than sweet) Great recipe for a crowd...looking forward to making it again.

I brought this to a pot luck meeting last night. I had to go straight from work, so I roasted the pork and made the vinaigrette the night before. I carried all the ingredients in separate containers and stored them in my office refrigerator. I assembled the salad at the meeting. All of this was not much trouble. I got compliments on the salad. It was a little too sweet for me. I am going to try it without the glaze next time.

I would not toast the curry powder again. The smell is still lingering in my house! Very good, but very sweet.

Very good. Problem was that this is so filling that my guests didn't save enough room for the jerk chicken (great!recipe on this site) and the black beans and rice I made to complete my Carribbean dinner. This salad does make a beautiful presentation. Omitted the raisins,ICKY. The guests did ask for the salad recipe.

I am sorry I didn't double the recipe for leftovers! As everyone said, this is excellent. I added 1 tsp. ground ginger to the spice rub, which we all enjoyed. Simply outstanding.

My friends and I made this and it was one of the easiest and most delicious entrees we have made in a long time. We had mixed greens with the dressing instead of the cabbage, but it was still good. I will definitely be making this in the near future!

You are right, this recipe doesn't need any more praise. Words alone can not describe the tastes and pleasures this dish brings to your mouth! I doubled the meat and sauces so I would have leftovers for sandwiches, I served 8 as a main course and barely had enough leftover for ONE sandwich! Served with rosemary focaccia and a Shiraz. Dessert was a rum/chocolate layered custard with carmelized bananas from this month's Choclatier magazine. FAB!

Not much to say that others haven't already. Wonderful recipe. Very easy for larger groups. Wouldn't change a thing.

Followed the recipe exactly(which is so hard for me to do) and was pleased with the results. I was actually afraid of the raisins but they definitely complimented the flavors as did the oranges and would be sorely missed if omitted. Next time I will add red onion to the dressing and double it as I like lots of cabbage and would need more dressing. My husband moaned and said the pork was excellent.He had the raisin phobia as well but thought they really added to it. I was hoping it would not be such an attractive and elegant looking recipe as I made a huge mess in my kitchen. Thinking of making it for 30 on Friday.

Rating: 4
This is wonderful. Made the recipe exactly as written only halved the recipe for the two of us, and had to use mixed baby greens instead of spinach and cabbage, just what was on hand. The tart dressing is a nice compliment to the sweetness of the oranges and the complex flavors of the pork, which is not as sweet as the amount of brown sugar may indicate. Thanks to the reviewer who mentioned adding purple onion to the dressing, equally good both with and without. Don't let the length of the recipe fool you, this is simple and quick to prepare. Restaurant quality meal.

Wonderful meal! I didn't use as much olive oil as the recipe asked, used a 3 lb. loin, and lettuces instead of cabbage or spinach. Served it with the coconut bread, black bean/corn/rice salad and key lime parfaits. Guests raved and NOTHING was left.

Very good recipe and easy for entertaining. I did almost ecerything the day before, even made the rub and put it on the meat right in the roasting pan and put it in the fridge. One question...I cooked the meat until it reached a temp of 155 degrees...but it was still a bit pink inside. Is it safe to serve pork that is cooked a it on the medium/rare side?

The seasoning and flavor of this pork is outstanding. The salad itself is good, but the pork is wonderful. An excellent mixture of spices and flavors. I will definitely make the pork again, with or without the salad.

I made this dish when it first came on the site. My husband is my crash-test dummy. He survived and begged for more. The next day I doled the little bit of leftovers out in small portions to my co-workers. They, too, begged for more. I'm trying to learn to like curry. There is just enough in this dish to get your toes in the water. Absolutely fantastic! I've been dreaming about it ever since I first made it.

To previous reviewer - Thanks for a response to my question. I'm kind of new at cooking. I thought about it more and agree with your advice. I think I'll save the mac & blue cheese recipe as a side dish when I am just serving steak. Instead, I opted to serve asian flank steak as another main dish (for non-pork eaters) and serve a caribbean rice/bean salad that would go well with both. Thanks for your input!

To Alaska: Macaroni with Blue Cheese is not something I would serve with a light, lovely salad like this one. However, if you think the two dishes pair well, hey, why not? Differences of opinion are what make food such a fun, interesting experience.

Possibly one of the very best dishes I have ever made! Husband loved it and we both had the leftovers for lunch the next day. It turned us back onto pork.

My wife liked this alot. I couldn't get passed the sweetness. I left out the raisins as I don't like them, and I left out the avocado as I couldn't find a ripe one. Instead, I added a sprinkling of rinsed black beans and chopped hearts of palm which I thought went very well.

I served this at an island theme dinner party along with jerk chicken, coconut curry shrimp and pineapple salsa. I doubled the pork because I wanted leftovers - used just over 4 lbs of pork and STILL do not have leftovers, even with all of the other food I served. It's delicious - my favorite out of all the food I made. It's perfect. Can't wait to make it again!

This was FANTASTIC!! A fantastic summer salad, served with rosemary-oregano pan bread and a glass of Merlot. My guests said it was "TO DIE FOR..." Try it!

Absolutely Delicious! I followed the recipe except for the following changes. I used a cast-iron pan to brown and roast the pork and used the carmalized juices both in the dressing and to drizzle around the edge of the plate. The flavors in this dish are superb - I wouldn't change a thing. I made the coconut bread but added 2 tablespoons more butter, toasted macadamia nuts and 1/4 cup of dried orange-flavored cranberries and cream of coconut instead of the water - wonderful with the salad!

After an initial test with my husband, I made this recipe for a baby shower - a party of 40 women. I was a little nervous with the mingling of flavors for a very mixed group of ladies but it was a a huge hit. A nice meal that can be prepared in advance that makes a great presentation. Rather than coconut bread, I made coconut muffins that complimented the meal. A little extra work but I couldn't find another type of muffin or bread that worked quite as well. It's a keeper for a party of 2 or a party of 40.

This is a very good recipe. I made it for a group of six along with a black bean and rice salad. There was very little leftover. I put the rub on the pork the night before and cooked the pork in the morning - brought back to room temp. before slicing and serving. I added sliced red onion and left out the raisins. I will make this again very soon!

Delicious! I am not a pork fan, but found it to be tender, juicy, and just wonderful! The flavors went well together (the only thing we did differently was leave out the raisins) and we enjoyed the salad dressing as the recipie is written. My husband, a huge pork fan, has declared this is top pork recipie!

This is a really great summer dish. I followed the recipe except replaced golden raisins with currants soaked in orange juice. After tasting the salad dressing I also added a little more orange juice. It's beautiful and delicious - you can't ask for anything more.

This is a great summer meal. I was a little skeptical of the cinnamon on meat, but it was perfect. We're not fans of curry, so I did leave that out. I thought the dressing needed a little sweetening, so I put about 1-2 tsp. brown sugar in it. My husband was very impressed and said it was one of the best things I've cooked.

Not that this recipe needs another feather in its cap, but I'll give it one anyway. The first time I made it I didn't have any Tabasco sauce so I did without - still delicious. The second time I made it 4 days later I had Tabasco which made it even better. I seriously am tyring to come up with an excuse for a dinner party so I can make this again just for the accolades (we all need a little self-esteem boost now and again!). It is so good.

The layered flavors in this recipe make for a diverse palate; tangy, sweet, cool and spicy. It can all be made ahead of time except for cooking the pork which took all but 15 minutes -- and I used the grill instead of browning and baking. Fab!

I prepared this meal for a summer day at the beach for four people. I wanted plenty so that there would be seconds. It was extremely tasty,with just the right of spice and sweetness to compliment the salad. My friends absolutely loved this meal! I was really proud considering I didn't prep anything the night before. I used everything just as ordered and it was perfect! Oh I brought along some spicy, wonton chips and we sprinkled them on top for even more kick!

My Husband who is not crazy about pork loved this. All my kids liked it, even though 2 of them slathered ranch dressing on it. I thought the flavors were wonderful. Seared it in the skillet as directed, then we placed it in a pan with the brown sugar glaze and grilled it. Left out the curry (not a fan) and I could not get enough of the avacados with the vinigarette.

The pork was wonderful but I did not care for the salad dressing at all. Perhaps it was my curry powder but I find that hard to believe as it was recently purchased. I definitely would opt for a different dressing next time.

I kind of did my own thing with this recipe...used a regular (cheap) pork roast and cooked it in the crock pot. the meat was tender and moist. Because I used the crock pot the glaze was thin. I drizzled some of the glaze on the cut meat. Delicious! With the salad I made the dressing exactly but tossed it all together instead of laying the avacado and orange slices in little rows. Next time I will cut down on the amount of lime and increase the amount of orange juice in the dressing--it was a bit too tangy for me (the husband liked it fine). This dish makes a beautiful presentation.

Recipe was great...cooked pork tenderloin on the grill as I prefer this to be a definite summer menu. May lose something with this method, but it is still wonderful. Only suggestion is to add salt to the vinaigrette to taste after combining other ingredients. I felt the amount listed was too much. Beautiful to look at...and wonderful to eat. Can't beat this combination.

I made this for the second time yesterday. Put the spice rub on early in the day and made the brown sugar {using only three quarters of a cup) garlic and tabasco glaze sothat the tenderloin could be put in the oven when my guests arrived. A thicker tenderloin required more time in oven. This time I served a grapefruit/avocado salad and the brown rice, mango salad from this site with some diced red pepper added for color. Good hot weather fare. I forgot to take the remaining 2 small loves of the coconut bread out of the freezer that I made the first time..darn it. The mango salad is really good and can be made early as it's served at room temperature.

Rating: 4
This was so good that I had to try it on the grill. It's good, REAL GOOD, but you sacrifice the syrupy jus unless you make it some other way. (I tried just heating half the glaze in a pan with a little oil, but ended up with garlic brittle.) I used the other half of the glaze as I would use bbq sauce. I pressed it on the pork just a minute or two before it was done and it worked nicely. The pork retained enough spicy sweetness to stand up to the dressing.

Made this for weekend guests a couple of weeks ago, and it was simply great. I especially liked being able to do almost everything ahead of time. Didn't change a thing except to cut back on brown sugar a little. I've made again today for bridge friends, but this time I've also made the coconut bread to accompany.

Really really good! The brown sugar/hot sauce glaze was fantastic, and paired well with the tender, juicy, spice-dusted pork. I didn't make the salad, just served the pork with rice and fried plantains...excellent meal. Also, I had a regular pork loin, used that instead of the smaller tenderloin, just doubled the roasting time (just watch the meat thermometer).

This was a great salad. I substituted mango for orange (hand a mango on hand) and omited the cabbage because didn't have any just used 2 bags of the spinach salad. The tast was great.

I've made this dish twice now, the pork is excellent. We didn't care for the dressing on the salad, maybe it was my Indian curry powder, but we thought it was too bitter. The second time I made it, I left out the curry but served it with bismanti rice cooked with jarred curry paste and peas. We also liked the coconut bread.

This dish is delicious. I added pine nuts to the salad to give it some extra crunch and used mandarin oranges instead of fresh oranges.

This was great! It was much more spicy than I anticipated. I did make one slight change, to lighten the dressing. I added on extra TBSP of OJ and reduced the oil to 2 tsp. This made enough dressing for 3 servings. I also served this with the coconut bread. It was a perfect accompaniment. Yes, it was crumbly (I served soon after cooking) but still very good. It had a fluffy cake like quality, and was quite sweet although not too sweet. Next time I think I will cook as two smaller loaves because I really enjoyed the crusty edge pieces. Additionally this combo would be great for entertaining as it can be almost entirely prepped ahead.

Very good, and enjoyed by entire family. I agree with the cook who found the dressing not especially tasty, especially for the time it took.

I will make it again, but I will cut the olive oil by half, will make half the dressing, and will cut the glaze ingredients by half.

I have made this twice. My husband loves it. I actually just made the pork and sauce the second time. I like the idea of the salad but the dressing for the salad wasn't that great (in my opinion). But the flavor of the pork is wonderful if just a bit sweet for me.

This is incredible! The pork comes out tender and delicious-- I even cooked it longer than suggested because I tend to be a bit paranoid about germs. The dressing was a perfect compliment. My husband, who rarely enjoys salad, asked as he was eating it, "So, when are we having this again?" I was told by the others present that it was the "best pork" they'd ever had. I used dried chili flakes from homegrown peppers instead of chili powder (we were out) and it was nice and spicy.

To Cook on 6/4: Trichinosis is not common in the US due to changes in pork feed etc. In any event it is killed at temps below medium well. Pink is fine. In addition, hookworm is NOT contracted from eating pork, but...the life cycle of the hookworm is a different story....(hint: keep your shoes on in warm climates)

Terrific salad! I agree with other reviewers that the pork was a bit overdone. Next time, I will take meat out at 132-35 degrees. I took this to a birthday luncheon and it was a huge hit. The flavors are incredible and I only wish I had had time to prepare the coconut bread.

My family enjoyed this meal immensely! The tenderloin was delicious- I did skip the browning, however, which led to trouble with cooking times so I left it in the oven extra long. Also, doubled the fresh orange juice in the salad dressing which worked very well, I thought. A great summer meal- I wish it had been warmer so we could have eaten outside!

This was lovely, my only gripe would be that the pork was a bit overdone (still juicy, but I prefer it lightly pink on the inside). I didn't have brown sugar for the glaze so I used honey, which worked fine. I didn't think the dressing for the salad needed sweetening, the sour flavour went well with the sweet pork. Wonderful flavour on the pork (the coconut bread ended up a bit sweet, everyone ate it after the salad instead of with it :)

Great Recipe!! The roast pork would be great on its own although combined with the salad it is outstanding in taste and presentation. I do think the dressing needs a little sweetness to bring out the flavor. I added about 1 tsp. of sugar and it was much improved. Honey would also be a good option.

I made this recipe for Mother's Day 2003 and everyone loved it! Then for my boyfriend's birthday party I made just the pork tenderloins (4) and they were the hit of the party, and I had a lot of wonderful food. I have been asked for the recipe by everyone at the party and by co-workers I told about the recipe. It is easy and so flavorful. The men told their wives "You've got to get this recipe." Everyone said it was the best pork tenderloin they've ever had. I will make it again and again. I forgot to say - I added some honey to the dressing because it was a little flat tasting. Much better.

To Cook from TriBeCa - why do you discredit the other things the reviewer said? (To clarify: I'm referring to the reviewer just before yours that used the term "rave reviews"). She gave insight on the flavor achieved by toasting the curry and she indicated that it's a kid-friendly dish. Those are useful comments - who cares if she also threw in "rave reviews" to emphasize how great the recipe was? And I didn't realize we were judging ANYONE on this site ("we have nothing else to judge you by other than your words"), I thought we were judging RECIPES... (And yes, I realize that I'm not actually judging the recipe here either...)

I feel compelled to rave about this recipe, which I followed to the letter. Two bites into the meal, I was already dreaming about when I could make this again.

I love sweet and spicy food and this is a perfect dish in my opinion.

Wow! We loved this. I followed the advice of others and cut the sugar significantly, but kept the garlic and tabasco the same. I also increased the amount of chili powder in the rub and tossed some in the glaze. I'd made the coconut bread the day before (with unsweetened coconut, and it was delicious). The two recipes compliment each other so well. My husband claims this was his favorite dish that I'd ever made.

This was so great! I too was afraid of the dressing - but it really became a wonderful background note within the medley of flavors. Also, instead of scaling back the glaze, I just piled it all on the pork. It ran off of course, but my boyfriend scraped it off the roasting pan & reheated it - it made the most wonderful & addictive glaze that we added on top of the pork upon serving. Yum.

Have already made this twice. Two important notes: (1) Use about 2/3 cup brown sugar, 1 cup is more than necessary; and (2) Only good the first day, so unless you are serving a crowd scale back accordingly! The coconut bread was average at best, don't waste your time/

I tried this recipe out a couple of nights ago. Impressive salad all in all. I agree with past reviewers on the facts that the dressing was a bit "flat" tasting. Also agree that the glaze was a bit much next time I prepare this plan on cutting brown sugar to 1/2 c. My 3 kids also enjoyed this salad (12, 8 and 5) but subbed different dressing versus the curry vinegrette. When I make the vinegrette again I think I will try it without the curry.

Coconut bread was good, too.

This was fabulous - taste & presentation were great! However, the vinaigrette didn't quite do it for me ... Next time I'll try my fav dressing for spinach salad which I think will make this perfect! (1/2c white wine vinegar, 2/3 c salad oil, 2-3 T Major Grey's chutney, 1+ t curry, 1 t dry mustard, 1 t salt, 1 t hot pepper sauce - combine/shake and let stand a room temp for 2 hrs).

This is my first time I've written! I'm a HUGE fan of this site & have tried many recipes. I made this last night for guests and I have to say that I was leary about it after making the dressing....I wasn't impressed with the taste, but went ahead after reading all the great reviews. I used the mandrin oranges as suggested {to make it easeir} and it came together NICELY! The pork is GREAT! An A+ for that, the salad an overall strong B+. The coconut bread is fantastic...will be toasting it up this am! Absolutely will make again.

Very nice combination of flavors and a pretty presentation. I served it with the coconut bread suggested in the Gourmet magazine article--a good accompaniment. The recipe states that it serves 6-8, but I used one-half recipe for two people as a main course, and used a whole alvocado and all three oranges. We ate only half the tenderloin, but we are not big meat-eaters. This is an excellent hot summertime entree.

Cyn2307, you are not alone. I made this last night and followed the recipe exactly. We thought there was too much cinnamon flavor in the pork, too much brown sugar in the glaze and too much curry in the salad dressing. The timing of browning and roasting the tenderloins however, was perfect and I will keep those instructions in my permanent file.

Rating: 2
This recipe was beautiful to look at and the pork was delicious! But... The curry dressing was sharp and seemed like it needed to be balanced out with ?Something! All 5 of us thought the same thing. I am so puzzled that I am the ONLY one who so far thinks this. Usually I tend to agree with all of you great food reviewers. I followed the recipe exactally and read over it again after dinner. Oh well, I think I will try it next time with another dressing perhaps. Maybe the Maple dressing found on this site. It sure was lovely though.

I've made this twice now, once exactly as written and once without the salad - just made the loin. Excellent! I think this is the best pork tenderloin recipe I've tried yet, and I've tried them all.

This dish was absolutely excellent. It is also beautiful to look at. My husband ( a very finicky eater) came into the kitchen several times to watch while I cooked. He was skeptical when he saw the combination then ate everything on his plate.

I have already made this dish twice, and it has been a "wipe out", nothing left on the dish. I am planning to use it for summer pot luck. It can be prepared, then assemble later.

You have to admit, it is kind of weird comment. Why would you serve something to your guests that you didn't think they would like? You know, that's always my goal, to serve food I think everyone will hate. How bizarre.

Rating: 4
wow! the only reason that i prepared this dish was because it fit perfectly with my "tropical menu" i wasn't expecting them to eat it, or even like it. i was completely wrong - everyone totally loved this dish. they ate all of it (and i doubled the recipe) - i used the garlic tabasco, they kept asking what type of meat. thanks to the chef that suggested rubbing the meat and letting it sit overnight. the dish was colorful, flavorful and the meat was so tender. delicious! you must try this, at least once!

We had this for dinner this evening and really enjoyed the unique flavors. My husband thought it was wonderful and wants it again on the weekend. Make half of the recipe for two people. Don't change anything but it is perfect as is.

This is the first recipe to which I have assigned a four-star rating. Next time I will put the red pepper on top with the orange and avocado slices to add even more to the presentation. The flavors are spectacular!I used chipotle tabasco sauce in the glaze and I think it added an even better "zing" to it.

Rating: 4
I think this is one of the best recipes ever published in Gourmet. Along with the Cocunut bread recipe that accompanies it,was a great summer meal.

I just *loved* this recipe. My husband thought it was very good, but was perhaps a bit less enamored than I. I do most of the cooking in our house though -- so he can definitely expect to see it on the menu again! I added a can of mandarin segments in place of the oranges, and used a salad greens mix instead of spinach. I also cut the tabasco in half because I'm not crazy about really hot food. I will make this the next time we have company for dinner. We didn't try the coconut bread, but I will make that next time as well.

Rating: 4
Excellent. After getting all the ingredients together, this came together in a flash and all the elements play off each other extremely well. I added some slivered vidalia onion and used dried cherries instead of raisins. Other than that, we followed the recipe exactly.

Rating: 4
Wow! I actually made this over two days (because of a delayed flight.....), so I put the rub on the pork, browned it and put the glaze on yesterday, and then put it in the fridge. I also made the vinaigrette yesterday, and baked the coconut bread. Today I took the meat out and popped it into the oven, and made the rest of the salad. I really don't like bell peppers, so after much debate, I substituted fresh asparagus from our garden for that, but otherwise made exactly as written. We ate way too much, but it's just that good. I wanted leftovers for lunch tomorrow, but since I had halved the recipe for our family of 4, there aren't any! This would be a great dish for company, as I now know I can do it ahead of time. Incredible flavor, and a beautiful visual presentation. What more can you ask? I'm stuffed, and still craving more.

This recipe is great! I used mandarin oranges rather than peeling and slicing (lazy),and dried cranberries in place of raisins (husband wont eat raisins). I also used some slaw cabbage because I couldn't find Napa. It was fantastic!

To those looking for wine suggestions, I served two different reds. One was an old vine zin (Marietta), which worked really well. The other was a meritage (Bookwalter) (a blend of cab, cab franc and merlot). We liked the old vine zin better. I also read that a simple cabernet franc would work well.

Rating: 4
My husband didn't want salad and I wanted to try the recipe so I served the pork over rice with the oranges, raisins, red pepper, and avocados surrounding the sliced pork. I made the salad dressing and added a bit of a drizzle over the pan juices that had been poured over the pork to balance the sweetness. Country Dijon substituted well since I had no regular Dijon. Definitely one to do again for company -it looked lovely and tasted out of this world!

Rating: 4
This is really a wonderful meal. The tenderloin was so tender and spiced just perfectly. And, although I did not have napa cabbage, the spinach stood well on it's own to make a beautiful and tasty salad. Loved the vinagrette and the coconut bread is to die for!!

Rating: 4
This dish has so many layers of flavor! Next time I would slice the tenderloin much thinner. I also used dried bing cherries since I prefer them to raisins and added candied pecans. I can't wait to try this on a summer afternoon for a luncheon by the pool. Also next time I will make the coconut bread.

A fantastic dish. I plan to make again, even though I never do recipes twice. My family loved it. Looks great too!

A great success on all 3 occasions I have made it - my son snuck over for seconds the next day! If you have delicate palettes present, the Tabasco and garlic is not shy. Perfect salad accompaniment. Am taking to next picnic.

This recipe is four forks full of flavor, texture and color. Inspired! And, it's easy to make. Treat your tastebuds and try it. Caveats: It's aromatic -- you might want to open a window, put out some bowls of vinegar or simmer some potpourri while/after cooking; and it's so flavorful, it will overwhelm a wine. We liked it with white wine spritzers (and also offered beer). But if anyone has a good wine to pair with it, let me know!

To the cook from BC-- Napa cabbage is also labeled Chinese cabbage. It is available in BC, and throughout Canada, and kind of looks like a head of Romain lettuce. If you really can't find it, substitute: bok choy OR regular cabbage (stronger flavor, takes longer to cook) OR savoy cabbage (stronger flavor, takes longer to cook).

Rating: 4
This was absolutely delicious! I made it for Mother's Day and there wasn't a bit left. I cut back on the Tabasco(child in the house), and didn't use all the vinaigrette on the salad. Some diners didn't care much for the vinaigrette so I guess it's a matter of personal taste. As stated the coconut bread does taste better the next day. I would also like to try this with chicken. Yummy!

This recipe will be my summer favorite this year. I am not much of a cook but I found the recipe straight forward and logical. Great flavors. The coconut bread is a must. My family loved it and suggested the addition of sugared nuts as a plus.

I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe. All the flavors marry beautifully. I was worried it would be too spicy for my family, but the spices mellowed with cooking. Everyone LOVED it. I spent very little time in the kitchen, considering how great this was! Big bang for your buck. Next time I'll make the coconut bread too.

I LOVED this pork tenderloin .... and so did my family, which is key! The only thing i found was that it was a little heavy on the salt, so i would cut back on that, and also the tabasco. I also added a little extra brown sugar : ) It was so tender and delicious, cooked perfectly, and the combination of the golden raisins and the oranges in the salad was wonderful! i will make this a few times over the summer ...

There really is nothing left to say about this dish that hasn't already been said. I made half the recipe and left out the raisins (because I don't like them) and the oranges (because I thought they might not go with wine). I didn't miss either although, next time I'll probably try the oranges. The coconut bread is a must!

My son & husband made this for Mother's Day, and it was FANTASTIC. The flavors harmonize wonderfully, resulting in an amazing dish. Everyone, including our little picky eater just loved it. As the BDJ's on Iron Chef say, "I didn't want to stop eating it!" They made the recommended coconut bread as well,and they went together beautifully.

It's all been said, my only problem was that some of the sugar glaze in the skillet carmelized instead of staying liquid. Perhaps because it was a cast-iron skillet. Must say, it was the best garlic toffee you can imagine! As far as needing something crunchy, we found the napa cabbage provided plenty of crunch.

I am presently a culinary student, and pride my self on good presentation and great tasting dishes. My fiance is Jamaican (used to spicy food) and my biggest critic, and his main complaint about my food is that it is not "seasoned" enough. My sister e-mailed me this recipe, and I made it for my fiance and some of our neighbors last night. I placed the salad on a large platter and arranged the pork tenderloin attractively on top of the salad...WHAT A HIT. The meat was so tender and so well seasoned (I spiced rubbed it the night before and then glazed it the next day after it was seared) that my neighbors were in heaven. As one neighbor put it; "My mouth is so not-used to these different flavors that it gets happier with every bite!" I coupled it with parsley/chive mashed potatoes and asparagus sauted in butter and minced shallots. All in all one of the best dinners I have ever made!!!!!

Devine!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I added so sugared nuts to the salad, everything stayed the same.

Can't adequately convey just how GREAT this salad is. It's pretty kicky, so cut back on the Tabasco if you like things a little more tame. I skipped the cabbage and used only spinach, cut back on the olive oil in the dressing (used 1/4 c.) and did use golden raisins (despite my husband's complaints). Both of us loved it! My only addition would be something crunchy, maybe toasted pecans and/or thinly sliced Bermuda onion. Wouldn't serve 6-8 as a main dish; at best it would serve 4 (with a few delicious scraps for leftovers). Yes, 2 tenderloins for 4 people. It's that good.

While I greatly enjoyed the crust atop the tenderloin and the thought of avocadoes and oranges paired, I did not enjoy the amount of time and dishes that seemed to stack up in my kitchen. The end flavor was not near grand enough to overcome those issues for me.

I made the pork tenderloin portion this time, but I'm very anxious to try the whole recipe. It was awesome! I used Tabasco Chipolte sauce, but I might not next time, because the smokiness made it taste a bit like ham.

This will be dinner party fare for all my future dinner. Make it Tonight!!!

A wonderful, easy recipe with complex flavors that dance on your tongue. For quick dinner preparation, I made the rub & vinaigrette the day before. I also made the coconut bread the day before. For the bread, I replaced 2 tablespoons of the flour with 2 tablespoons baking powder, since I didn't have self-rising flour on hand. It worked perfectly. Add fresh strawberry daquries and you have the perfect summer meal.

This recipe was so good, I couldn't find pork tenderloin that wasn't already marinated in the store so I used swordfish instead, probably even better for our taste then the pork. I did the same thing, pan seared then finished in a 350 oven. I would use this for any meaty fish, and can't wait to try it with pork.

Yum, Yum, Yum! Truly outstanding. Halved the recipie for my husband and I and it still turned out great. Loved the vinegarette, but my hubby thought it was too acidic. I cut down on the oil, so probably will add more next time. I omitted the raisins, but added dried cherries and sliced almonds. I loved the flavor of the cherries with the dressing, and the almonds added a nice crunch. Be sure and save the pan juices - you will want to lick the pan. I am going to make this for a dinner party next week. Fabulous summer dish!

Believe it, this salad really IS as good as the people here are saying it is. My brother and his wife made this for us, along with the coconut bread on this site (also great), and we went cross-eyed with delight from the first bite. Wonderfully unusual flavors. Since he made extra pork tenderloin (a good idea!), we tried the recipe ourselves with the leftovers. Quality ingredients count here...the freshest baby spinach, heavy juicy oranges...Perfect for warm summer night, and just calls out for a fruity rum punch!

Fantastic. I made only the pork, and I added to the dry rub 1/4 tsp. allspice and 1/4 tsp. ground ginger. Used Frank's Red Hot (no Tabasco on hand). Used all the rub on 1 1.4 pound tenderloin. My husband, who doesn't like pork, loved this. This was so easy and very tasty.

TOO GOOD FOR WORDS! This recipe is superb. The pork was so tender, the sauce divine (my husband and I put the extra sauce in ramekins for dipping the pork.) The only thing I changed was the dressing. I added two more tablespoons for orange juice and 1 tablespoon of honey. Next time, I'll cut back on the oil as others suggested. This recipe is fast, simple and perfect for summer.
