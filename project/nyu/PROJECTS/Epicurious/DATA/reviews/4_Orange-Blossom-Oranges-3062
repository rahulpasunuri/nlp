One of my all-time favorite recipes that I have been making for years! I usually keep a glass bowl of this syrup in my refrigerator and just spoon it over whatever fruit I have available. It's delicious! I used to buy Monteux orange blossom flower water which was exquisite, but it is now discontinued. The Malandel brand is very good and available on Amazon. Do NOT buy the Nielsen-Massey product- horrible odor! I ruined a whole batch of syrup with it and returned the rest to the store.

Lovely, flexible, refreshing. Have made with oranges, grapefruit, and look forward to experimenting with rosewater. The simple syrup keeps - over time the anise becomes more pronounced. This has gots to make for a great cocktail aromatic/sweetner... hm...

This a great accompaniment to any brunch, and I use any opportunity for a brunch to make this dish! It's so easy! Yes, there is a little more syrup than needed to drizzle on the fruit, but as other reviewers have mentioned, I serve the rest of the syrup in a pretty gravy boat with the star anise in it as garnish. So good!

I made this with navel, cara cara and blood oranges and the three different colors looked very striking. I agree with the comment about the syrup - half the quantity is plenty.

What an unuusual dish! Everybody asked for seconds! More syrup that you need for this receipe, but the syrup is what makes it so special. I left the star anise in for decoration.

This was wonderful-- gorgeous and delicious. I substituted Grand Manier for the orange water and it was great.

This is a delicious and beautiful recipe with lots of flexibility. I followed the advice of previous reviewers by drizzling just a few tablespoons of the syrup over the fruit, then serving the rest in a clear server. I did not discard the anise because it looked beautiful floating around in the syrup. Finally, I used both regular and blood oranges, and kiwi. It was a dazzling dish--both in looks and taste!

This was easy and refreshing. Served it to ten people and even so did not use all the syrup, so no wonder some other reviews called this too sweet. Just drizzle a little syrup over each serving and don't feel obliged to use it all! I also added sliced kiwi fruit which made a prettier presentation and went well with the other flavors. Great after a rich main course.

Fantastic! I substituted rose water for the orange flower water and added some dried rosebuds to the simple syrup. The anise added terrific flavor.

A little too sweet, maybe use some mint instead of the anise. It helps to be able to find good oranges, too, which I couldn't do here. I did it with blood oranges and it was beautiful and quite good.
