I made this marinade for grilled chicken and shrimp and it was amazing! It added lots of flavor even though I was only able to marinate for about 20 minutes. I'll definitely use this over and over!

I recently used this recipe for grilled shrimp and also for sirloin kebababs. Everyone loved it! It's also a fairly easy marinade to make, not too many ingredients. I followed another reviewer's adviced and used the mortar & pestle; perfect!

Used it on shrimp and thought it was great. Think it would be good on beef and chicken too as others recommend.

Agree this recipe doesn't need as much as salt as called for. I am lazy and don't want to juice all those lemons, so I make this with bottled lemon juice. I throw all the ingredients in a blender, peeled garlic and all (I pull the rosemary off the stems, but I don't bother to chop the thyme). I then blend it - voila! I have made the recipe the time consuming way and my "quick" way - I nor my victims (guests) can tell the difference. Everyone loves chicken marinated this way. I slow cook on a smoker @ 180F for 1 hour, then bring the chicken up to temp at 325F for 45 min - chicken is juicy, flavorful and well cooked every time.

Used or Shrimp and Onion Kebabs, made too much and a bit too oily but very flavorful. Will try leftover on chicken breast.

I use this with the Beef & Shrimp Kebabs recipe. The last time I made it I added a about a tablespoon of brown sugar, everyone enjoyed them. I used the idea of another reviewer to grind the herbs in a mortar. I think that works well and will continue to use that method.

Made this with flank steak...DELISH!! This will definitely be my go-to marinade. I chopped up and herbs and then pounded everything in a mortar and pestle....easier than mincing everything.

This one was a smash hit at our house. We had spur of the moment dinner guests and I made this as a main course with some roasted veggies. The biggest perk? It fit in with the South Beach diet that everyone was on. A definite keeper!

I made this for guests during the summer, and they raved. It's quick, easy, tasty and can be used on shrimp, lamb, chicken, etc.

I did this using red wine vinegar instead of lemon juice, which gave it more spirit. It is great for shish-kebabs, and I find the lamb needs only about an hour in the marinade before grilling.

If you like very mild marinades, you will enjoy this one. There was nothing fantastic about it, even though it was good.
