I am giving this a one. I misread the directions for the milk. The total amount was at the top of the recipe and did not indicate that it was to be divided. I made fresh bread crumbs, whisked the egg and the TOTAL AMOUNT OF MILK and got so exasperated that we ordered out. I put the veal mixture in the refrigeration overnight to see if it firmed up, but it was still loose. Then I added a punch of panko so I will make the balls and see what happens. If I try it again I will be sure to follow this defective recipe.

My children and husband beg me to make this. The meatballs are soft and delicate. Despite not being a dill fan the sauce is delicious. I serve it over noodles and we fight over the last ball. Never any left overs.

Made this the other night but substituted ground turkey because that's what I had in the freezer. I was skeptical, but it turned out great. I also had to substitute half and half for part of the cream because I didn't have enough, and the sauce was still delicious. Will definitely make this again.

I keep a kosher home, and made the recipe with non-dairy products. It was an absolutely amazing success!

if you like the flavors in this recipe, try putting them into the meatballs, sauteed onions, a whole bunch of dill, a generous spoonfull of your favorite mustard, a pinch each of paprika and cumin and some cooked basmati rice...for the sauce, take out the meatballs after browning and put in some sliced onions with a meagre handful of flour to coat, splash in some red wine and reduce to a syrupy couple of spoonfuls, add tomato paste, beefstock and cream and viola...meatballs to DIE FOR! p.s. don't forget an egg in the meatball mix to hold them together (and of course season to taste)

I wasnt crazy about the sauce- it was just ok. The meatballs seem to take longer to cook than what the recipe calls for.

I like to make batches of meatballs and freeze some, then thaw a certain quantity with any sauce/gravy I choose. These meatballs don't taste much of anything, even though I mixed 3 portions of veal with one portion of lean ground pork. But the accompanying sauce amply makes up for the lackluster meatballs. It is flavorful and unctuous and I'm sure such a sauce could be used with other dishes, such as lamb meatloaf for instance. I sauteed mushrooms and boiled baby carrots and added both to the sauce. I made mashed potatoes with that and I bet that small, boiled, new potatoes would also be delicious with this dish.

I thought that the meatballs were very tasty. I would definitely make them again, but I wasn't so sure about the sauce. It was too bland, and the noodles made it even more bland. I thought the carrots were good. This might work better with a different sauce,but I don't know what kind that woud be.

I've been making this for years: I use all ground veal or 1/2 veal, 1/2 ground turkey. Instead of frying, put the meatballs on a greased baking sheet at 375 degrees for 20+ minutes - much easier. I also use 1% milk and light cream. Don't change the the caraway noodles: it just wouldn't be the same. A big buttery Chardonnay really caps the meal!

GREAT RECIPE!!!!!I also used mushrooms instead of carrots--served with buttered caraway noodles--will definitely save to my recipe box--one of the best recipes I've tried lately--also try the Pork Tenderloin with Caramelized Pears

Great recipe. I substituted the mushrooms for the carrots. Served over mashed potatoes. The only problem I had was that the meatballs kept falling apart when frying them. I finally had to add about double the amount of crumbs. I don't know what I did wrong.

Excellent recipe. Very tasty! I have made this recipe several times and have only used very lean ground beef. Will have to try the veal some day, but the beef works very well. I have made this dish with the carrots and have also tried substituting mushrooms as the other reviewers mentioned. Both come out great. I think the sauce is absolutely wonderful, and even though I am not partial to dill, I find it works very well in this recipe. I serve this dish with noodles.

This may seem like sacrilege and I'm almost ashamed to admit it ... but here's what I did. I was looking for something different to do with some frozen store-bought beef meatballs I had in the freezer and came up with this. It was terrific! I can't wait to try it from scratch with the veal. Yum! Very versatile recipe, obviously... :)

Very tasty! I did not have ground veal on hand, so I used ground sirloin instead which worked just fine. Next time, I will mix ground veal, ground beef, and ground pork. The sauteed onions give the meatballs a great flavor. Definately use fresh dill if you have it; yum. I served it over noodles, but will probably serve over mashed potatoes the next time. I will follow another reviewers suggestion and add mushrooms and serve the carrots on the side. You will not be disappointed by this recipe if you are in the mood for comfort food!

I have made this recipe several times and it is always a treat. It is old fashioned comfort food, but very rich and flavorful and not boring. I, like another reviewer, make the meatballs smaller, but otherwise, stick to the recipe. Give it a try.

The first time I made the recipe, I was a purist and followed it exactly. Now I don't. I make the meatballs smaller and use neither carrots nor dilll Instead, I substitute about one pound sauteed mushrooms with their juice and serve the carrots on the side. Everyone raves about these meatballs!

This recipe is very good. I added ground chicken and ground pork to the veal to add a little better flavor. My family enjoyed it and I was told that I could make it again. So it was a definete hit.
