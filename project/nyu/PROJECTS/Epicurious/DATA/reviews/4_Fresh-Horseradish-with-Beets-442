This recipe is fabulous. The horseradish sauce alone could be used as a dip. I made it with the beets for a large dinner party, and even the non- beet lovers gobled it up!

I used a 2T horsradish cream instead of the horsradish. The sauce by itself was extremly strong but the sweetness of the beets balances it nicely. I also add a touch of lemon juice. Very tasty. Will make again and again.

I'm surprised to see there are no reviews for this recipe. I have been making this since 1995! It is always great, following the exact recipe and it can be made a few days ahead.
