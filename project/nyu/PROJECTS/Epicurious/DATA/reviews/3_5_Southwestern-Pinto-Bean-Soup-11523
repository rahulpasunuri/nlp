we are big soup/chili fans -and was encouraged by the reviews however - this was just terrible - it looked gross, smelled gross and despite the chorizo and the seasonings tasted awful - recipe went right in the garbage

O.K. but not great. I love just about any kind of bean, but found this soup to be one dimensional, which was a surprise due to the amount of ingredients and spice.

These were so flavorful! I was searching for a basic Southern pinto beans with ham hock recipe, but after making this one decided it was even better. I cooked it the day before, and froze the leftovers.

This was pretty tasty. We halved the recipe and it served 5 people as a main course.

Great soup. Would definatly make again. Followed the recipe as written with one exception, I used ham steak which I happen to already have. Next time I will use the chorizo. Pretty mild soup, for more kick add a jalapeno or two.

I love this recipe and will definitley be making it over and over for years. The red bell peppers were an interesting addition. I'm a vegetarian so I substituted the chorizo for "soyrizo" and vegetable broth for the chicken broth. It was great and it made a ton!

I didn't really like this. Not horrible, but not great. I know I lost some "kick" by substituting spicy turkey sausage instead of the chorizo, but I didn't expect it to taste SO bland. I had to doctor it up with more spices & enchilada sauce quite a bit before it was worth eating.

I used a whole cup of enchilada sauce (Old El Paso mild), diced ham instead of chorizo and provided lime slices & chopped cilantro on the side. Plus the obligatory cornbread. Got wows from everyone. This recipe even converted my bean-hating husband.

The cornbread suggestion was right on! Even my two kids (under 6) liked this soup/stew. Lots of ways to vary it, too -- add corn, different meat, chiles, cilantro, etc.

Good recipe. I serve with warm flour tortillas.

In my quest for low fat, high fiber, easy to prepare meals this is a winner.
