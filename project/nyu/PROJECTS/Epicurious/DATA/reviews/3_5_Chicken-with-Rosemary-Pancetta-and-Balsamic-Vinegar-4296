Based on the reviews, I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and prosciutto. Baked at 350 for 30 min covered and 20 minutes uncovered. Chicken was overdone and sauce was too mild and not flavorful enough. I don't think I'd make again but, for those who try this, I suggest using significantly more rosemary and I would salt the chicken. Also, as many reviewers have noted, the pancetta/prosciutto is not critical to the recipe.

I have made this many times. I bake it covered for only 30 minutes and then the rest of the time I bake it uncovered and just baste it a couple of times by spooning the sauce over it. The sauce in the pan reduces and the pancetta (or bacon slices if I must) gets crispy on top. Delicious and easy.

This was just okay. I use epicurious as my main source for recipes, so I've become adept at finding great food. This is one of the first, since 2002, that fell short for me. The pancetta had little effect on the flavor, the rosemary, vinegar, and garlic were good, but there was seemingly no reason to cut the chicken and lay it flat. I pushed the temperature up to 350 but the dish was so, so.

Used boneless chicken and baked at 350 for 50 minutes as other reviewers had stated and that worked well. Pancetta didn't add too much flavor, not sure I would use that again. The balsamic/white wine sauce was great. Reducing the sauce really intensified the flavor, which I would highly recommend. I made the meal with roasted green beans, a salad, and some bread for a really healthy meal.

Excellent! I served it over rosemary sprigs from my bush.

This was really delicious with chicken breasts (50 minutes on 350) and salad for dinner. I think it's more of a winter/fall meal though. Would also try cooking the pancetta separately to maintain crispness

Forgot to say....if you use chx breasts, only need about 50-60 min. at 350, or until 175 degrees internally.

Fantastic! I used boneless, skinless breasts....used 8 large half-breasts & still had tons of sauce. I didn't bother reducing the sauce, etc., just poured it off and served it with a simple rice pilaf w/a little rosemary in it. Note, I cut down on garlic slightly so rosemary would predominate. Everyone loved this, and it's actually very simple to make!!!

This turned out scrumptious. The chicken was perfect and the sauce complemented it perfectly. I threw the chicken in the oven right after work and did some chores while it baked. Once it was done I tented chicken and put it back in the oven to keep warm while I reduced the sauce. The sauce did take over an hour to reduce, but we had a glass of wine or two while we waited. I would say lots of fresh rosemary (used about 2-3 TB) and the pancetta are necessary ingredients. My husband loved it.

Really juice and just delicious!

This is really one of my favorites. If you don't have balsamic, use red wine vinegar. Can substitute bacon for pancetta, and any chicken part with a bone for the whole chicken mentioned in the recipe. Be careful though, sometimes the chicken tastes more "boiled" than "baked" if there is too much liquid. Either way this is really, really tasty!

I rarely give 4 forks but this was amazing, the only thing I changed was that I used about 1/2 cup balsamic and 1/2 cup vermouth for one really large chicken breast, it's just my husband and I and I only had a really nice bottle of wine I didn't want to waste for cooking. For sides I made asparagus and a salad that went SO WELL together with the chicken! It was basically Romaine lettuce with a grilled portobello on top with a dressing I made of 2 ozs of gorgonzola, 1/2 cup sour cream, 1 tablespoon of (low fat) mayonaise 1 tablespoon of balsamic, 1 clove garlic and salt and pepper (this made way too much dressing as it was for two). I honestly think one of the reasons I loved this so much was because the whole meal worked really well together. But even so the chicken was wonderful! Also, all together the whole meal was only about 400-500 calories and we couldn't finish our chicken. I think I'll use it tomorrow in some spaghetti squash.

I used thinly sliced procutto instead and also used frozen from the bag, skinnless chix breast. I also used vermouth instead of wine and it was great. Use more garlic than what they say.

I had just got home from work & put a cut-up chicken in the oven spiced with Creole seasoning and was browsing under baked chicken when I saw this recipe. I jumped up, threw half a cup of balsamic vinegar on it,about a cup of white wine(French)and broiled once cooked. Great! I didn/t even add anything to the sauce-just reduced it. Wonderful with the creole seasoning. Quick and easy. I'd like to try it with Cornish Hens and add the Rosemary.

I left out the pancetta, but it was great. A very different flavor. Very tender and easy.

I substituted about 3 lbs of boneless chx breasts (for ease of serving)in this recipe. I cooked the chx for 90 min at 350 degrees, and found the chx to be a bit overcooked after the final broiling. For future reference, I'd recommend cooking the chx for only 75 min at 350 degrees. After 30 minutes, the reduced sauce had the consistency of a thick plum-sauce and was absolutely savory! Make sure to serve the sauce *hot* , as it practically melts on the chx. Overall, this dish, topped with fresh rosemary sprigs, presents very well when cooking for company.

Although this dish is time-consuming to prepare, the rave reviews it receives from my husband make it well worth the effort.

The wine mixture has terrific flavor but I reduced it for 45 minutes and it still had a long way to go. It was too thin so I was forced to thicken it with flour/water mixture. Omitted the pancetta still with good results. Chicken became too cool after such a long wait for the sauce to reduce.

I made this for a group by using 6 chicken breast halves (with bone, without skin) and baking them in a 9x13 pan at 350 for 1 hour. I forgot the oil, and instead of chopping the garlic, I threw 3 smashed cloves in the wine mixture. The chicken was nicely browned from the baking, so I skipped the broiling step. And I couldn't wait for the sauce to reduce, so I thickened it with a little cornstarch. I was very pleased with the results - even without the skin or the oil, it was moist and delicious.

Although it takes a long time to make, it is well worth the wait. The chicken was very moist and tasty. The sauce made it an excellent entre.
