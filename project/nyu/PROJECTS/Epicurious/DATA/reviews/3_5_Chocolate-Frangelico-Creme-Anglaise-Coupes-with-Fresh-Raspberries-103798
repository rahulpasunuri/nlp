This is an outstanding recipe. I chose it to end a wonderful dinner of roast pork loin, parmesan and mushroom risotto, green beans with sherry and almonds and every single person (of the 15 guests) loved it!!!!

This was ok, but not spectacular. It was very thin in consistency. The day I made this I also made the VANILLA PANNA COTTA WITH MIXED-BERRY COMPOTE from this web site (same type of dish) and I found that the panna cotta was both easier and tastier, so I would not bother making this again.

I'm glad i read the reviews before I tried this, because the picture in the magazine was very unrealistic -- there is no way it was thick enough (at least not til the 3rd day in the fridge!) to be served this way... Needs more frangelico---maybe a dollop of whipped cream flavored w/ it poured on top of the berries. Delicious, tho. We're still licking the bowl!

Delicious and impressive!

I served this several times to my in-laws. They licked the cup! I tried it with Grand Manier also but prefer the Frangelica. Delicious and fairly easy to make!

Very tasty! I was glad there was a notation about the consistancy, because I thought it would have been more custard-like. All of my guests scraped their wine goblets clean.

This made an elegant, light dessert for a dinner party I had. The chocoholics devoured it. I liked it so much that I plan to purchase special dessert type cups just for this recipe.

I think this is a bang up "creme" anglaise recipe. I truly love hazelnut so it really appealed to me. And, since it is not a custard or not supposed to be thick, the viscosity was perfect as all "cremes" should be. I will definitely make it again, and also improvise with other liquers using this recipe.

The result was thinner than I expected. Next time I will make it with the intent of pouring it on fruit, rather topping it with berries.

This recipe was good but not fantastic. I thought it was a little bland. I was looking for a great dessert recipe I could make in pretty martini glasses and this was perfect for that, but needed more flavor. I want to try this with grand marnier.

I was worried that the consistency was too thin - but if you refrigerate it overnight, it becomes much thicker, but still not as firm as a pudding or mousse. Flavor was good, but couldn't taste much of the Frangelico. I recommend a dallop of fresh whipped cream on top.

This recipe tasted delicious and did not take long to make. I took it to friends' house for dessert, and they raved about it. My husband thought the consistency was too thin. Also added sliced almonds as a garnish.
