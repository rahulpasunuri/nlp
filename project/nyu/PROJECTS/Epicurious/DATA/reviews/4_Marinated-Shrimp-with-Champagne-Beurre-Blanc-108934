Excellent first course! I used prosecco instead of Champagne and the sauce was spectacular. Recommend straining the sauce base (not mentioned in the method). As noted by other reviewers, 3/4 cup butter is sufficient and bread was requested by guests to finish the sauce on the their plates!

Absolutely delicious with no modifications whatsoever. I have served this multiple times with guests literally wanting to lick the plates. I've also followed the same recipe but with white wine and white wine vinegar as substitutes for the champagne and champagne vinegar respectively, as a sauce for petrale sole, with equally great results.

Served this for Christmas Eve before Beef Wellington. The reduction and marinade linked the food to the sauce perfectly. Everyone loved this dish - Served with some great French Champagne and the result was AMAZING. Doing this again.

Just fabulous! Made this as an appetizer for a Christmas dinner serving the beurre blanc on the side. Made the recipe almost exactly. I did soften the shallots in butter first for the sauce and then put through a sieve at the end prior to adding the butter. I agree that one stick of butter could suffice. And I did add cream at the end to hold the sauce. The shrimp was so good prepared as is. Some guests didn't think you needed the sauce with them. Will do again.

Really nice recipe. Stands up nicely on the platter and is a snap to make. I had a roast in the oven , so I cooked them in a skillet, no oil needed in the pan. I would prepare after my guests arrive next time, they get cold quickly. Nice presentation. I did only use one stick of butter.

Oh, my - what a wonderful sauce for shrimp - or anything else you'd like to eat. I used this recipe as an hor d'oerve so served it in a "chip" style dish with the sauce in the middle with the shrimp all around. It was a hit - totally gone in 5 minutes. Since I only had 1 pound of shrimp, I had left over sauce and served it over the asparagus with dinner. Finger-licking good!

I made this as the first course for Christmas Eve - it was fabulous. I sauteed the shrimp instead of broiling and added a couple of tablespoons of cream to the sauce at the end. I followed a how-to video for buerre blanc I found on another site. According to that chef, a classic buerre blanc does not have cream but it is often added to help keep the sauce from breaking.

Fantastic! Got rave reviews, everyone wanted the recipe! I made it twice, once broiling the second frying, found frying was easier as I was in more control of the cooking. I made a couple small changes to the recipe...I did not use Tarragon to garnish simply chives and parsley. I also increased the amount of champagne in the marinade to ensure the shrimp were coverd, so I used in total an entire bottle. I did not use peppercorns in the sauce but rather seasoned with salt and pepper. I also removed the tails as they blackened upon cooking under the broiler and found the presentation was better with them removed. (I did have a difficult time with them standing up on the plate too) The first time I used less butter than the second so just ensure you keep tasting vs adding the whole lot. Will for sure make again!

Rating: 2
I'm thinking that I messed up this recipe somehow, because I just wasn't umpressed. The presentation was nice and my family liked it, but I wasn't wowed. Maybe it's because only the night before I had made a Spanish garlic shrimp recipe from Cook's illustrated that was incredible (and less expensive). Plus, maybe I'm missing something, but doesn't a buerre blanc normally have cream? I think that maybe I'll try this again before writing it off, but I might stick with other shrimp recipes in the future.

Excellent! I used smaller shrimp but followed the same metnod for grilling. Could only use chives for onion flavor in the marinade, but it worked. I also used taragon in the sauce in place of the shallots. I did follow the tip from a piror chef of adding only 3/4 c. butter, and it was wonderful.

made a half recipe last night with med-lg shrimp and yeasty, dry saint-germain brut, which is a bargain at $9, as a main course (champagne thursday, you know?). must agree that it's a bit heavy on the butter, will use 3/4 next time. since the shrimp i used were smaller, i cooked them in a grill pan instead of the broiler. after removing the cooked shrimp from the pan i poured the remaining marinade in and steamed some asparagus in it. i plated the shrimp and asparagus over mixed baby greens that had been tossed in a tiny bit of evoo, champagne vinegar, and s&p, then drizzled (who am i kidding? poured) the buerre blanc over. delish! as many other reviewers suggested, have a baguette on hand and serve it with the same champagne used in the recipe.

Was the first to review this recipe when it came out in 2003. Did not think I could improve it, but made it camping and grilled the prawns over the fire. Hate to quote a TV personality, but it did kick it up several notches. Had planned it as a starter, but my friends brought extra large prawns to use and they were a whole meal.

I made this for Valentine's Day as the main entree and it was delicious! My fiancee said this was the best dinner I ever made (I served it with two other recipes from Epicurious - mushroom and goat cheese tart, and a spinach salad - as well as my own asiago mashed potatoes). I used cheap Cook's Brut champagne and found the sauce to be a bit strong, but still good. I might use the sweet kind next time. This is a very easy dish to make with a beautiful presentation and delicious results.

I made this as a starter course for Valentines Day for my husband and me, and it was great! I had a very cheap bottle of sweet sparkling wine in the fridge so I used that.

Love this recipe! It is very impressive to serve to guests and pretty easy to make. I made it once with one and half sticks of butter, then next time with the full 2 the recipe calls for. Liked it better with less -- the other flavors came through more strongly. Nice to serve some arugula as a garnish -- the sauce goes nicely with it too. If you are serving salad, you can a little of this to the dressing too! For best presentation, get jumbo shrimp (little ones shrink and don't stand as well). Don't marinate for over an hour -- it gives the shrimp a tougher consistency. If you make the sauce base ahead, you can whip up the sauce while the shrimp are cooking. Very impressive dish!

Divinely decadent. I opted to reduce the the champagne based to about 2.5 tbsp., as suggested by others. And reduced the amount of butter by 1/2 (It did not take away from the dish at all). I used cheap champagne, and served it with really good champagne . . and people were commenting on how wonderful the pairing was . . served it as a first course. Next time I'll try jumbo shrimp instead of just large, making for a more spectucular presentation.

I didn't even complete this dish. While cooking the sauce, I noticed the odor and did not like it at all.

The smell was truly awful.

Excellent! I made this once as is but following the advice in the reviews to reduce the wine further than 1/4 cup. I also made it this week-end but I marinated a grouper fillet and 1/2 pound of shrimp. Then I baked the grouper and sauted the shrimp in the marinade. To serve I put the shrimp on top of the grouper fillet and then the sauce...WOW. Just remember as with any Buerre Blanc sauce - keep the temp low when adding the butter and go slow.

This recipe has great potential but the sauce is too watery. The reduction needs to continue 1 or 2 tablespoons only and the butter added very slowly or the sauce will break.

I can't wait to make this again. I had a part bag of left over deveined large tiger prawns in my freezer. I did not have time to even marinade the prawns, nor did I broil them. I just cooked them in the sauce and simply served them on plates (not even tails up) and it was great! Next time I will make it according to the recipe to see if it is possible to be even better. Note, that I would not bother with undeveined shrimp when you can easily buy them already clean.

This was a big suprise hit. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used half the butter in the sauce. I had thought the sauce might be a bit sharp/bitter at first, but everyone loved it. Be sure to serve it with bread because the sauce was so good people were unexpectedly asking for some to sop it up with.

I made for Xmas eve last year. Awesome and easy to do. elegant

Rating: 4
the extra dry champagne is fine. The extra bit of sweetness is a nice compliment to the sweetness of the shrimp. The sauce must be made with the minimum of liquid (champagne/wine)...1/4 cup is too much, for the desired consistency. For family, I do not strain the base (before butter}. For company, I would press it through a stainer with a spatula, then incorporate the butter. The butter must be ice cold and swirled in one piece at a time over loooow heat...take your tiiimmme...this makes it sauce consistency. Use a wisk to incorporate air into the sauce.

I don't know what "prof chef" did with her/his sauce but it was a perfect recipe for me. I followed thr directions to the letter (including the tip to not let it boil when adding and melting the butter piece by piece. I used a cheap brut champagne ($4.99) and the whole thing came out light and sweet and totally satisfying. I would, in the future, strain off the shallots, because there are already enough of them left on the marinated shrimp if you want a little texture in each bite. I hope "prof chef" gets to try this one again before totally writing it off. Raves from my family!

Rating: 1
i was so excited about this one, and what a letdown. the champagne didn't do anything that cheap, dry white wine couldn't do (to my surprise) and the shallots were too sweet in combination. too much butter and the end sauce was WAY too thin, but not right to reduce. strange! stick to your classic white wine reduction with only a little shallot, and just enough butter and fresh herb stirred in.

Rating: 4
Oh my! What a fabulous recipe! I fell across this recipe at the last minute and couldn't have been happier. It's one of the best shrimp dishes I've had in a long time. I served it on a large platter with toothpicks and small plates nearby. I wish I had time to read the reviews before I made it. Now that I have read them, I concur with cutting the sauce in half, especially if you purchase shrimp smaller than large or extra large. (I used large shrimp and I recommend not changing that part of the recipe.) I understand why some want to skip the herbs, but if presentation is a big part of your repetoire, leave the herbs in the recipe. Otherwise, it may look a little bland.

This is a fantastic recipe! I used Jonathan R's recommendations - reduced sauce to 1/2 cup before adding only 1 stick of butter (only 18 days into a new year's resolution, I couldn't bear to add 2!). I also used a peppercorn mix - red, black, and green. I served it with the blue cheese crusted filet recipe on this site and it was the perfect surf and turf!

This is hands down the absolute best dish I have ever prepared. Simple, elegant, and full of flavor. Don't let the 2 sticks of unsalted REAL butter frighten you - it is a delicious recipe. I will however use two bottles of champagne next time to have a lot of extra sauce. Eat it the first night - if you reheat it the next day the butter separates from the champagne - still tastes great - but loses some of its visual appeal. I'll be preparing this dish for my Father's 80th birthday & friends.

Very nice recipe..didn't suffer at all from the cheap bubbly. I added whole pink as well as black peppercorns to the champagne reduction, which I think worked wonderfully. I also used only one stick of butter, and there was plenty of a still-very-rich sauce left over after the meal. I reduced sauce to 1/2 cup instead of 1/4 cup before the butter, and this too seemed fine. In the future, perhaps even a little less butter (not for health, really, it just isn't necessary), a bit more peppercorn, and lots more fresh herb to sprinkle. I ran out, and it complemented marvelously.

Also made this for New Year's Eve dinner, and it was probably one of the best items on the menu. Used jumbo shrimp from Costco and took it out of broiler when it looked still a touch undone in the center. Elegant and delicious!

Made it for the first time for company on New Year's Eve -- everyone loved it. I even screwed up and put the herbs into the marinade, but you never would have known the difference.
