Instead of broiling this, I chopped the eggplant up and sauteed it with some chopped onions in the olive oil, then added the other ingredients. I think it worked quite well that way, and turned out to be more like what I expect from an indian dish - something I can put over rice and top with yogurt sauce. I already have plans to make it again!

It was definitely quick, but it didn't taste good enough for me to want to prepare it again. It's probably my broiler, but the eggplant slices ended up either almost-raw or afire.

Very quick and yummy. Whatever you do, don't marinate the eggplant slices in the mixture, even for a few minutes - this made the flavors far too strong. I will just brush it on from now on.
