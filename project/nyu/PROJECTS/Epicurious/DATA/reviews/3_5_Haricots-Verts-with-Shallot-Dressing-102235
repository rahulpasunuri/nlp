I ran out of shallots and had no time to buy more, 15 minutes before my guests arrived, so I used balsamic vinegar and a touch of pepper instead- there were no leftovers.

I thought this was good, and it certainly was easy. I'd definitely make again. I didn't have too much dressing as others have commented.

Easy and quick. The shallot sauce also makes a good salad dressing if you have any left over.

This recipe was SO easy and SO flavorful! I used regular green beans instead of harticots verts -- it was a perfect combination. You definitely have to like the taste of shallots though.

Excellent dish. I liked this so much I made it twice over the weekend: first with shallots and the second time with garlic. I actually liked the garlic version better. I didn't toss the haricots verts with the dressing, and instead drizzled the dressing over the beans. It made a nice presentation.

This was great, very good served warm or as a salad.

I found the combination of mustard and vinegar in the dressing too overpowering for such delicate vegetables.

I've made this many times - a real pleaser. I serve the beans "room temp" and use it as a buffet salad. Any left over dressing is excellent on other "room temp" steamed vegetables - brussels sprouts for instance. Use your imagination.

I served this with the Honey Glazed Salmon recipe. Terrific!
