Well, Yankee me... This was pretty good baked off in an 8x8x2 pyrex baking dish sprayed with Baker's Joy. It's slightly sweet, as we like it, and came out nice and moist. Might just be my goto cornbread. I was out of buttermilk, so used the 1 T lemon juice in 1 C milk (let it set for 10 min.) as a sub.

This is a good, basic cornbread recipe. I've made it a couple of times, and it holds up well to tinkering. And on the stuffing/dressing question--with apologies to my fellow Yankee--Kentucky's got it right...

Now, now Kentucky. Even this Yankee knows that stuffing and dressing are not the same thing. Dressing is baked outside of the turkey while stuffing is cooked INSIDE the turkey.

Only a Yankee would bake corn bread in anything but a cast iron skillet. It makes a good bread for dressing (stuffing for Ya'll) and also good for foundation of creamed meat entrees.
