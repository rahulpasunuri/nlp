Great recipe. I also made some modifications. Added red potatoes and blended them with the chicken stock and about half the sautéed onions and celery. I skipped the reux. Only used one teaspoon sugar. Was very happy with how it turned out.

This recipe is a good start, but I did some things differently. Namely, I used 8 ears of fresh corn (instead of the canned/frozen), roasted the kernels and used the cobs to make a stock. I also roasted/peeled the poblano peppers. I omitted the flour and the sugar, and added two diced red-skin potatoes. I also used lobster base instead of chicken stock. And subbed half and half for heavy cream. I increased the shrimp to 1.5 lbs, which I would recommend. Overall, this dish was awesome! The lime and cilantro added at the end brighten everything up. Very delicious! Restaurant quality!

I really enjoyed this chowder. Next time I will leave out the sugar; I used fresh corn and it provided all the sweetness required. Also, I'll add more shrimp next time. Otherwise, great recipe. Really nice with a crusty bread for a cold, rainy day.

This recipe, used as a base, is super fantastic. Changes: fried bacon lardon (1/4 lb) crisped, and removed. Sweated onions and celery in bacon drippings. 3 poblano + 1 jalapeno - roasted, peeled and chopped (seeds removed) added to onion and celery mix. Use fish stock or shrimp stock instead of chicken broth. Use 8 - 10 fresh corn cobs, some removed from cob using knife and some removed from cob using Box grater (some whole kernels, some creamed corn....) skim milk instead of cream and two russet potatoes added to ensure "chowder". Per another review - made a roux with melted butter and flour before adding to soup mixture.... the result was fabulous - on more than one occasion. LOVE LOVE LOVE this as a summer dinner. Fresh and delightful.

I liked this a lot but felt weird using frozen and cream corn since the markets are bursting with fresh corn right now. The best fresh corn chowder recipe I've tried in ages is on notesfromjudieskitchen.com. Great fresh, summery chowder..yum

Amazing, amazing, amazing! I always read reviews first before I try a recipe, so thanks for all the tips here. Make sure forget about the cream corn and to use fresh corn (I used 6 medium cobs) and grill the cobs first on the bbq. I also roasted the poblanos, and grilled the shrimp. I also added two large yukon gold potatoes, cubed. Finally a tsp of chipotle chili pwder and two tsps of smoked paprika; add more chipotle if you like things really spicy, but I was going for a gentle heat. Got rave reviews and this is my corn chowder recipe for the summer!!!!

This recipe is JUST OK. Maybe it has something to do with the brand of cream corn that I used? Del Monte? But this was just not as great as every other review would have you believe. Its too sweet (don't add the sugar!) its not thick enough, and it is corn overload. In the past I've avoided recipes that call for canned ingredients and now I realize why I've followed the rule for so long. Skip this one.

Wonderful chowder. I roasted the peppers and put in a couple of diced russet potatoes. No need for thickener. I used shrimp as called for but will be trying crab next time. I also think bacon would be a great addition.

This recipe was delicious and has a pretty good kick to it. Used crab instead of shrimp and didn't add the butter and flour combination. I thought it was plenty thick without it. It turned out great and a bit less fattening!

This is the first 4-star recipe I haven't liked. I think I don't like creamed corn and will use fresh next time and puree half the soup. It was too sweet (and I didn't use any sugar). I roasted the poblanos, added lots of black pepper, 2 sm. cans of diced green chilis and about 8 oz grated cheese, then it was ok.

Too bad the fork ratings don't do 1/2 marks. This is a 3-1/2. Terrific flavor and great on its own or as a course meal. Added the red potatoes too and roasted the poblanos before adding. Extra time in prep, but worth the flavor. Taking leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

Everyone was impressed with this recipe. I made some slight changes by adding 4 ounces more of broth rather than have it go to waste, used kernels off of a fresh corn on the cob and bought 1 1/4 lbs of shrimp. Minor changes in the scheme of things. Since I didn't have a food processor I used a blender for the celery and onion. Served this dish with fresh baguettes. This is a soup worth making again !!

I made this last night. I omitted the sugar & added 1 clove of garlic to the veggie saute mix. Otherwise, I made it as is. I loved it. My husband didn't like the shrimp in it, he's not a seafood fan. Next time I make it for him, I'll try it with chicken or sausage.

my family loves this recipe. I made it the 1st time using only 1 can of creamed corn because that's all i had. The 2nd time using 2 cans. We all thought it was better with just one can of creamed corn and i added a cup of diced cooked potatoes the 3rd time. It was really the best combo for us.

I agree that this is a good base for the original chowder from Sundown Cafe (now Taqueria del Sol in Atlanta). Even when making this as printed, it's good but not nearly as good as the version at the restaurant. I also roasted the poblanos, along with a red pepper, cooked bacon and set aside, then cooked the onion/celery mixture in the bacon fat. Made a roux with the butter/flour (it just clumps up in the soup when doing it as printed), then slowly added the broth to the roux, stirring frequently. I used Better than Bouillon Lobster base and mixed with the chicken broth, for added depth. Left the other ingredients the same. Used half and half and added at the end, since it made more sense. I've made this multiple times, and it's delicious!! (Something's still missing, though it's closer to the restaurant version, except for the bacon)

This is an excellent, easy recipe that leaves a lot of room for creativity. I've made it twice now, and I'll be making it again and again in the future, I'm sure. I added red potatoes to the pot and an extra poblano pepper. (I also roasted the peppers and removed their skins before adding to the mix.) Instead of cream, I use milk in this recipe. Also, I use less of the butter-flour mixture to thicken the soup. Instead, just before I add the shrimp and cilantro, I puree it a little bit. I like to finish this dish with some fresh lime juice to give it an extra zing.

I made this after a terribly expensive botch of shrimp etouffee for my sister's birthday party. My sister in law found this recipe and we put it together for 30 people! Raves, and nothing left. I've made it since substituting the shrimp with chicken, sweet sausage, adding bacon and potatos. Fabulous and diverse recipe!

Delicious. I doubled the amount of poblano peppers as I was using a surplus from my garden. I skipped the shrimp although I'm sure they'd be delicious in the soup. Yummy.

This was great! I had to use pre-cooked shrimp, and a different variety of mild chilies from our garden along with single cream, but it was still very good. I too roasted and peeled the peppers, and instead of the roux added some diced potato to the vegetables. Result; Chowder! I agree, it would work very well with Crab.

Three stars to me is a definately make again dish, but not yet the best thing I have ever had. However, I did make a few changes. I substituted the celery for an orange pepper. I also used canned corn in place of the frozen bag. I also roasted 3 pablanos then left the seeds in for spice. Next time I might add carrots.

Rating: 4
WOW! What a hit! I used Farmers Market Fresh corn, with the 'cream' pulled off the cobb with the back of my knife. I used 5 ears. This was magnificent! I will add potatos the leftovers. I froze 2 quarts. I used the sugar and the spice, and it was SO NICE- they even each other out. Thank you for our new favorite soup! Jen

I used all of the additions suggested, except for the bacon, which I will definitely add when I make it again. One thing I did differently was to add the cream after bringing to a boil, because it seemed to make more sense. The next time I make it, I will peel the red potatoes, because their skins slipped off anyway and were hard to eat. Excellent recipe!

Easy to make and the flavors are terrific. All my guests enjoyed the soup and asked for the recipe.

This is a great starter for a winter evening. I did however make my own stock by using the shrimp shells instead of just broth to give the soup a bit more depth. I also pan roasted the frozen corn to give the soup a bit more flavor. Some chipotle powder and smoked paprika and a twist of lime at the end were also a good addition.

I've made this soup more times than I can count. I think it's absolutely delicious, and my boyfriend can't get enough of it - even in midsummer. I even took this to a potluck, and it was gone in seconds. The funniest part was that someone asked me where I got the ingredients because in her words, she could taste true quality. I lied because the truth was primarily Costco. It's such a good recipe, it apparently covered up my not- so-quality ingredients.

Loved this chowder! Added 1 red pepper chopped & 3 medium red potatoes diced to saute mixture. Half & half instead of whipping cream provides enough of a creamy texture. Sugar is absolutely unnecessary. Parsley is a great substitute for those who dislike cilantro. Loved the richness, depth of flavor & fresh spiciness from fresh poblanos. Defintely a keeper recipe!

Rating: 4
I agree with many of the suggested modifications. I also roasted the chiles, used three of them and only 1/4 tsp cayenne (preferring the heat of the chile to the fire of the cayenne), and subbed half and half. It was plenty sweet with the corn alone, so no sugar needed. Excellent! Will make again and again.

I loved this recipe, I made it many times all winter and will probably make it all year. After the first time I have not added shrimp however. It may be my personal taste but I didn't like the mix with shrimp. My boyfriend liked the shrimp though. I didn't find it necessary for the recipe and distracted me from the wonderful flavor!

This is a fabulous recipe. Omitted the sugar. The first time I made it I substituted a store-bought roasted chicken, which I deboned, cubed and added. Made it very quick and easy and super hearty. The next time I substituted the shrimp with lump crabmeat which made it very special and delicious. Next time I might even try with the shrimp.

This soup is so awesome! I brought it to National Soup Swap Day, and I felt myself wishing I didn't have to swap it! Everyone keeps telling me that it was the best soup they got that night. I also omitted the sugar and doubled the cilantro. I rosted the pepers and fresh corn to give it a smokier flavor. Instead of cyanne pepper, I used 2 1/2 Tbs of Mexican-style chili powder. It had just the right amount of kick. This is my new favorite soup!!

Its very good- not a dish beyond compare, though. fairly easy to whip up on a weeknight (just dont do what I did and buy unpeeled shrimp). I actually added two pieces of bacon and sauteed the onion mixture in that. Added the crumble bacon with the creamed corn. Also added 1/2 C chopped roasted red peppers. YUM!

Rating: 3
this was super easy....i did roast the pepper as others suggested (it takes just a couple of minutes to do this if you lay the pepper directly on the gas burner and flip it while you are chopping the veggies)....the cilantro is great, and i ended up adding quite a bit extra to my bowl......

Wow! This is wonderful. I did make a few modifications. Used non fat half and half instead of whipping cream-still very flavorful and less calories!

Also added some diced new potatoes and finely grated sharp cheddar cheese. A little Tex-Mex flair! Yummy

This is a great recipe and very easy. My husband is not a fan of cilantro so I substituted Italian parsley which added nice color but doesn't have such a strong taste. I will definitely make this again.

Anaheim chilies proved to be a good substitute for poblanos. I also added 1/4 lb of fresh Dungeness crab to the recipe, and reduced the flour and butter mixture to one tablespoon each. Because my husband isn't keen on large amounts of cilantro, I only added 1 tablespoon to the chowder directly, and allowed my guests to add more chopped cilantro to their bowls as they preferred. I served the chowder with crusty bread, and, because of its sweetness and mild heat, imported Mexican beer. The dinner was perfect for a cool autumn day.

Rating: 4
This recipe is very good. I made a couple of changes because I used ingedients that I had on hand. I used two cans of niblet corn for the frozen corn and used 4 cups lobster broth instead of chicken broth. I also used half shrimp, half crab meat.The lobster broth complemented the seafood.My husband loved it. I just gave some to my co-worker who said it tasted better than a restaurant. I will make it again for sure!

Rating: 4
Easy to make and it got rave reviews from all my guests! Colorful, healthy, and delicious. I made it with 8 ears of fresh corn + one can of whole kernel corn, left out the celery and sugar (the latter was definitely unnecessary with the sweet end-of-summer corn!). It was very thick with corn kernels and shrimp - could have been partially pureed to give a soupier texture, but was wonderful as is. A red bell pepper (roasted, peeled, and chopped) would add even more color, but the yellow corn and deep green poblano chiles make a dramatic presentation.

Rating: 3
Outstanding! Much like what I have had at Sundown/Taqueria del Sol in Atlanta, as a previous reviewer noted. I did add about a cup of diced potatoes (more chowdery) and used half & half, but would probably use cream next time.

So delicious. We have corn soup at a restaurant called La Cabinita in Glendale, CA and I've always thought it was the best... until I tried this recipe. The only things I did differently was that I warmed the broth with some corn cobs to infuse the flavor. I used fresh corn that I roasted first over open flame. Can't say enough about this one.

I was so happy to find this recipe because I used to go to Sundown Cafe in Atlanta before I moved and it was my favorite item on a menu where EVERYTHING was exceptional. I think this recipe is delicious. I do, however, think what I had at the restaurant was better. At dinner there once, I asked my waiter what was in it. I recall him saying lobster of some sort - like a base. So, I'm guessing substituting the chicken for lobster broth might make it even better. Based on reviews, I also used half & half instead of heavy cream, roasted the poblanos, and left a few chunks of shrimp in rather than chopping all of them up too much. It tasted great! I'll definitely make this one a lot.

Rating: 4
I planned to make a half batch, but the chowder seemed quite thick so I added a second can of broth. Also added red bell pepper and potato. Omitting the shrimp and using vegetabe broth makes it a fine vegetarian chowder as well. It's a great recipe.

I made this last night and it was even better than I had expected (also a bit spicier than I might have expected). Based on reviews I roasted the poblano first - its actually pretty fun and easy to do and I think it helped make the dish even better. I did forget celery which was no big deal. Next time I would add in potatos to make it more of a chowder. I think it also would work really well with crab in place of the shrimp. Loved it!

Both my husband and myself enjoyed this soup. I found it to be plenty spicey. I did sub the frozen corn for fresh, but still used the canned corn.

This is very good! I did make some adjustments. I roasted the pablanos as well as one red, orange, and yellow bell pepper under the broiler until charred. Then I put in a paper sack for 10 to 15 min and peeled them. I sauteed the celery and onion in bacon fat and added that to the soup. It gives it very nice depth of flavor. I then added the crisp, chopped bacon to the soup when I added the shrimp. This soup got rave reviews at my last dinner party. Will definitely make again!!!

This sounds wonderful, but while poblanos may be known as pasillas in some places, they are _not_ pasillas. A pasilla is a dried chilaca chile, and using pasilla peppers in this recipe would change it considerably. Generally a dried chile does not make a good substitute for a fresh one and vice-versa.

This soup was delicious and a big hit at my dinner party. It was surprising how good it was considering I accidentally used fat free half and half. Originally I thought I had just accidentally misplaced the whipping cream with the half and half but realized a week later it was actually fat free. Considering the accidental substitutions I think it's fair to say it was a great recipe and could be even better in it's original state.

Is this good! I've made this several times since the recipe was first printed and my guests have requested the recipe every time. It was a particularly big hit on a recent ski trip.

I've made this many times with perfect success. (If the Santa Monica cook found it bland, perhaps the chiles used weren't very fresh -- that will do it.) I'm a seasoned cook and I hate peeling & deveining shrimp, so I buy the jumbo frozen shrimp in a a bag at Costco, then thaw it before adding it to the recipe. Pair this chowder with a fresh green salad and it's a real winner.

I thought this recipe was very good but not quite as spectacular as I expected. It needed a little something more even though we added fresh crab and pancetta. I would adivse adding a bit of garlic and maybe a bit more cilantro. I would skip the sugar next time as well because the creamed corn has enough sweetness. We also roasted the pasillas which gave a nice flavor. Overall, it was a nice hearty soup.

I made this recipe as directed and it really fell flat. I probably won't make it again, but would highly recommend some of the past reviewer's suggestions. Definitely roast and skin the poblanos. Some gold potatoes would add a nice heartiness that this sorely lacked. I'd also recommend using fresh roasted corn in place of the frozen bag. Don't skimp on the cayenne or cilantro, as you'll need every bit of flavor you can get. And finally, think about cooking it with a piece of salted pork for added body.

A fabulous winter soup. Roasting the poblanos (at least three) is a simple step and adds great flavor. I recently altered if for a weight conscience crowd, and used the Land-0-Lakes fat-free cream product. An oxymoron I know, but it subsituted nicely.

I thought this was quite good but not that easy. I find peeling shrimp a chore, and my market was out of cooked shrimp. I took some of the suggestions below, roasted the peppers and added potatoes, and did not find it too much broth. Maybe a little too sweet, with creamed corn; perhaps omit sugar. Everyone enjoyed this, but I wouldn't put it in my top 10 favorite soups.

This soup was a gigantic hit! I did add cuitlacoche,which is available through earthy.com, and 2 more poblanos to it. Probably one of the top 3 soups I've ever made. I successfully froze half the soup without the cream and shrimp. Just so you know: the chiles should be roasted and peeled before adding to the soup. The skin of a poblano chile is very bitter and tough. The soup will come out even better if they're peeled. Jalapeños are NOT a substitute for poblano chiles. There is no comparison in flavor or mildness. You could MAYBE get away with New Mexico chiles, but even then the flavor will be affected. But jalapeños for poblano? That's like substituting cabbage for carrots and saying it's ok because they're both cruciferous vegetables.

I made this dish for a supper club event and it was a hit! I substituted 4 jalapenos for the poblano chilies and lightened it up a bit by substituting 3/4 c 1% milk plus 1/4 c half and half for the 1 c whipping cream. I also added cubed red potatoes to truly make it a chowder. Everyone loved it! I'll definitely make this again.

Fantastic and easy. I added a chopped red pepper in place of some of the corn and used fat free half and half. Amazingly, I didn't miss the butterfat at all.

This was soooo good and sooooo easy!!! I used Tono & Beto's granulated Mole Verde in this and it was outstanding and soooo easy to make.

A tip - the skin on the peppers comes across a bit tough in the soup. Next time I make this I'll roast the poblano pepper and skin it.

Supurb, I made this as written but appreciate the comments for reduced fat, will do next time. Maybe it's my Irish/Norweigen ancestory but I, as well as my guests thought the flavors were well balanced and saw no need to increase the "heat".

Outstanding!!! This soup is now my husband's all-time favorite. I substituted no-fat half & half for the whipping cream and it worked just fine. Recipe was easy to follow; finished product looked exactly like the photo in B.A. We loved it; yum!
