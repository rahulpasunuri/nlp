I didn't really know how these cookies were supposed to turn out, but they weren't as good as I had hoped. They were difficult to roll, and I ended up with about ten after messing up. If I made them again, I would try baking them on parchement paper. They tasted ok, but the effort I put in wasn't worth the result.
