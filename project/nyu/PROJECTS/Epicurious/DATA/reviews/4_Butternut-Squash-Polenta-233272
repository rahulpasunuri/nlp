Much more than the sum of its parts (though admittedly its parts include a lot of butter). I roasted a butternut squash for a double recipe, which seemed about right. 2% milk was fine. For those flummoxed by where to find instant polenta, I found it in the rice and beans section of Whole Foods. Served this with salmon and a mustard cream sauce.

I made this for a dinner party last night and it was a huge hit! My Italian friend had seconds, which was a big compliment! I used chicken broth rather than water and grated extra aged cheddar, about 1/2 cup at the end. Also, I cooked it for far longer than 5 min. more like 25-30! It seemed to take forever to get the right thickness. I will be making this for Thanksgiving next week and will use less liquid.

Delicious - as per other reviewers, it was a little bland. I used 1/2 chicken broth with milk. I also added some garlic and a dash of sage.

All I had was the pre-cooked, plastic-wrapped polenta. I used this by cutting it up, adding milk and blending it with an immersion blender. It worked perfectly.

As my 2-year old daughter would say, its "nummy bites!" This was really good although took an hour because I made the puree myself. I cut down on some of the butter and used 1 cup of chicken stock vs. water. Great for sweet tooth types. Thanks for the tips!

i roasted garlic and onions with fresh butternut squash and combined it all with indian spices. one batch used half-milk half-water to cook the grits, and butter for flavoring. the other batch used water and olive oil. neither batch took cheese. the vegan grits were good, but the creaminess of the milk and butter made the non-vegan grits OUTSTANDING. brought it to a dinner party where a man visiting from china raved about it, although i'm not sure what he pictured when i said "butternut." highly recommended.

I found this bland. I reduced the butter, and added a bit more cheese, a little wine (the acidity helps pick up the flavor), and a lot more salt. It's good, but not great. I think I might have liked it better with chicken broth instead of milk.

I've used soy milk and it's turned out perfectly.

Loved this recipe! No need for frozen puree--just make the real thing. Just slice a butternut squash vertically into thirds (to get about one-inch thickness), and poke skin with a fork. Bake at 400 degrees for about 30 minutes. Scoop out the squash, smash and, voila, better puree.

An after-note from me. The next morning, this polenta is still soft and creamy, due to the squash, it does not set like more basic polenta recipes, and to my mind, that's a good thing. Before I though it was just still soft from being in the oven, but I was mistaken. A keeper!

I used Bob's Red Mill polenta because that's what I had. I just cooked the polenta longer, maybe 30 minutes. Then I poured the finished recipe into a casserole, put the lid on and kept it warm in a 170 degree Fahrenheit oven for two hours. When I removed it from the oven for the dinner party, the top looked set, but underneath, it was still soft and creamy inside!!! I looked all over the internet for a trick to keep it from setting, but everything just said to serve immediately, so I consider this a valuable discovery. I would use more squash next time, but it was delicious.

I was slightly skeptical, but since we were out of oatmeal and cold cereal at our house, I figured it might make a good breakfast. And oh my gosh. It was AMAZING. We are vegan, so I tweaked the recipe a tad. I left out the onions and thus, too, the butter because onions at breakfast doesn't work for my family unless it's in a hash or scrambled tofu. I also subbed So Delicious brand coconut milk for the whole milk, and I used 1 tsp Better Than Bouillon's No Chicken Chicken Base mixed with the 2-1/2 cups of water to make a chicken-like stock. Lastly, I used freshly roasted butternut from the previous day, and we left out the parmesan. IT WAS SO GOOD!!!! I thought I had instant polenta, but discovered that it was most definitely not instant when it required nearly an hour of constant stirring to achieve the correct texture. However, it was well worth it. The mouth feel was velvety, and the taste was SOOOO GOOD! My 18 month old had two bowls of the stuff!! This is going to be a regular item in our house, but next time, I'll make sure I use instant polenta :)

Suprisingly simple and seriously good. I used a little brown sugar... was fantastic!

Oops. I forgot to mention, I also used some ground sage on the butternut squash when roasting it & served the polenta with parmesan on top as well as the butternut squash seeds which I had toasted in clarified butter and a mixture of spices (salt, pepper, cayenne, brown sugar)

I made this dish for my culinary class & everyone loved it. I roasted the butternut squash myself brushing it with clarified butter & sprinkling brown sugar, salt, pepper, & cinnamon on it. Once it was roasted, I pureed it & set it aside. When making the polenta, I used chicken stock instead of water, and once it was ready, I finished it with a little finely minced fresh sage, a pinch of ground cardamom, whole butter and parmesan. This was a true comfort food!

Loved this - great comfort food. Used veggie broth for water and 2% milk with great results. Added dried sage to the onion squash mixture. Yum - will definitely make it again.

My family really liked this. Even my 10 yr old that abhors vegetables ate all of hers instead of the turkey with gravy that she usually loves. Some of my family have dietary restrictions and couldn't have the cheese or milk. But even with unsweetened rice milk substituted and the cheese left out this is still a keeper for us. I used steamed fresh squash and then used the steam water for some of the water. Was very satisfying. I'll try using the leftovers tomorrow for breakfast as someone else suggested. Will definitely make again.

great fall/winter comfort food. i plan to add it to my thanksgiving menu. I only had access to canned organic butternut Squash, and it tasted fine to me. next time i'll try the real thing. at the end, i added a dash of nutmeg, a tablespoon of honey, and some chopped thyme leaves. it added more depth of flavor to the dish. very yummy.

Delicious! I couldn't stop eating it. I strongly agree with the recommendations of other reviewers: use fresh sage. This makes all the difference. I sauted 2T chopped fresh sage with the onion and a dash of red pepper. Fantastic. I also used less butter--only 1/2T and it was great. I used half the suggested amount of cheese because I found as I was adding it that it overwhelmed the other flavors. Will definitely make again.

Everyone in my family enjoyed this recipe. When I make it again I will use about twice as much butternut squash and skip the butter as the dish has more then enough richness without it.

I used fresh butternut squash instead of the pureed and it was fabulous. Definitely worth repeating.

Followed others note and microwaved squash, but left some chunks to add some texture to the polenta. Paired with roasted chicken and veggies. Great color and enjoyed by all. My changes: i added some extra spice with hot red pepper paste and crushed red pepper. Also used lowfat milk and buttermilk instead of regular milk.

I was looking for a butternut squash dish to accompany salmon for a dinner party, and I stumbled upon this. I was worried about lumpiness, but it came out perfectly! My guests loved it and were impressed. It was just enough flavor, so it didn't compete with the salmon. Good.

My husband and 1 1/2 year old son loved it! I would use less onion next time or maybe a sweeter onion like a Vidalia. I cooked a fresh butternut squash in the microwave and mashed it with a fork. I didn't add the last 2 Tbsp. of butter and it still tasted great.

I thought this, although subtle, had a wonderful flavor and a great texture. It was a delicious side and I would be tempted to add some sage and maybe even a little brown sugar next time. Definitely worthwhile.

A little bland for my taste, but still better than plain polenta. I baked fresh butternut squash (couldn't find frozen). My husband loves polenta, tho, so I'll probably make it again.

I never thought to put butternut squash and polenta together, but the combination turned out very well. We tried it once with freshly cooked squash and once with the Williams-Sonoma jarred butternut squash puree. Both were excellent.

Despite the relative ease of this dish, the taste is incredible. Since I can't find frozen pureed squah, I steam my own and the recipe is still delicious. I also add a bit of thyme and more cheese. For the amount of time it takes, this recipe is a real winner. I've made it 4 times.

grew my own squash, froze the puree, this is easy, delish, and so good for you..by adding cinnamon, clove, a bit of brown sugar, it doubles as a great hot breakfast...gourmet=creativity +simplicity

It's really easy to just microwave the squash to get puree, and it's a lot quicker than roasting. and you know, i don't think i've ever seen frozen squash puree, although i've never looked, either.

I wasn't planning to review after making this, but since it has been given such a bad rap I decided to add my opinion. The frozen squash is a great time saver and the flavor is no different than if I had roasted my own. The overall taste was exactly what I was hoping for when I read the recipe and decided it sounded like something I would love. It paired perfectly with the sea scallop with mushroom saute recipe. I have already made it twice, which I seldom do with any recipe.

You people are ridiculous. You use milk to make polenta (the creamy, rich kind my family makes) and what's wrong with frozen squash - it's the holidays - save time where you can and spend it with yor family. If you so object, just roast the squash, it's your perogative. Does everything "gourmet" have to be time consuming and over involved? It's only a side dish, after all. I think it sounds yummy!

Just weighing in-- I think its great to have recipes that are easy yet delicious and sophisticated in their taste. Its the working persons dream! For those who are more ambitious, one can modify the recipe to be more "authentic."

I don't mind the "instant" ingredients (let's face it, most of us don't have time to roast a squash everyday, no matter how simple it is), it's the 2 cups of milk that bother me the most, which sounds pretty revolting in combination with the squash and polenta to me. p.s. Rating a recipe you haven't even made is pretty annoying too.

What is this? A recipe from "Gourmet" that just dumps together "frozent butternut squash puree" and "instant polenta"? Making real polenta is dead simple, and roasting squash is not much more difficult. How about a recipe that uses real ingredients?
