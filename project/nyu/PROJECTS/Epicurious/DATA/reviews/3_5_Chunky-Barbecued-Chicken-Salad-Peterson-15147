To the person who complained about opening a whole can of chipotle chiles and only using one. This is the case for most recipes calling for these chiles. So when I open a can, I then wrap each chile individually in plastic wrap, along with a little adobo sauce, and put all the little packets into a plastic bag and keep them in the freezer. Then each time you need just one or two chiles you thaw out just what you need. This way you are not wasting the rest of the can. I've done this for years. It works great.

I give it 4 stars because it is so easy to make and very adaptable. I have made it 3 times in the past month, either in a sandwich or chopped salad. very good.

We happened to have some leftover grilled onions and red bell pepper, and I tossed them in w/ the chicken. Very yummy way to use up leftovers -- love the other add-in suggestions here!

Great! Good spice and a great way to get rid of the extra BBQ chicken (the ribs always go faster). Cut the peppers pretty large so there is some crunch Watch the cilantro so you don't overdo it.

I have used made this exactly according to the directions (great) and as essentially a way to use a variety of leftovers from BBQ chicken night/cookouts. I've added potato salad, grilled corn, leftover chopped crudite, asian slaw, even green bean salad. The BBQ/mayo sauce pairs well with lots of things. It has never failed to be a hit.

This is really good! I used Quorn naked cutlets instead of chicken and soy mayo - for a delicious vegetarian dinner! Definitely add corn and black beans if you have them!

A great solution to left over bbq chicken. Scallions, parsley, corn, and black beans are all good additions as well.

TO THE COOK from Houston... puree the can of chipotle and freeze it... add a little when you need a kick to mexican dishes etc! I plan to make this with leftover chicken, my husband always bbq's way too much chicken and we always have leftovers!

yum! a nice change from plain chicken salad. chipotles are spicy, but it mellowed out a bit after being in the fridge overnight. i added corn and black beans, served over a bed of greens.

Nice and easy way to use leftover chicken. Taste good too! Had it last week and my husband won't leave me alone until I make it again! He really loved it!

What a great dish!! I used Hickory Smoke flavor BBQ sauce, so the whole salad is quite consistent with the smoky taste. It's also a pretty quick dish, what a great way to use up the left-over chicken. I served the salad on a bed of shredded iceberg lettuce. The only problem I have is I have almost a whole can of chipotle peppers unusued after taking one out of a can.

Yum! I used leftover chicken from epicurious' chili-rubbed chicken with barbecue table mop. An easy, pleasing meal. I served the chicken salad on a bed of mixed greens.

This is a great use of left over chicken. We used 1/2 K.C. masterpiece, and 1/2 Thai barbecue sauce (from Bristol Farms), because it's what we had on hand. Served on mixed baby greens with black beans, feta, and grape tomatoes. Was bummed we ate all of the roasted corn from the barbecue as it would have been excellent on the salad as well. We did find we liked the flavors better when it was first made before they had all blended into one bbq taste.

Loved this recipe! I did not use as much cilantro as called for, because it is not one of my favorite flavors. Also used a honey barbecue sauce. Made great lunches for a week. I will definitely keep this recipe handy.

This is great! It is also versatile -- we've used other barbecue type ingedients (leftover corn, potatoes, even green beans) and it always has turned out well. It has even converted chicken-salad haters.

I love this chicken salad. It's zesty and delicious. I didn't have barbecue sauce so just started with a little vinegar (cider), a little brown sugar, some ketchup and worchestire sauce, and a dash of lemon. I didn't have a green pepper either, but once I'd tasted the chicken salad I ran out and got one because the crunch really adds to it.

Wow! what a wonderful way to use leftovers. I've even been known to buy a rotisserie chicken in the store to use in the salad when the craving for it struck. Yumm. Yumm.

Substituted a sweet Vidalia onion, and used a yellow bell pepper. Also used left over roasted turkey from Christmas dinner. Absolutely delicious. Great left over helper.
