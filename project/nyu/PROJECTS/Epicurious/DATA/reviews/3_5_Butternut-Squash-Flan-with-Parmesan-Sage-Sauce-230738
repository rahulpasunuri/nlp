I made this dish twice last year, once for a test and once for Thanksgiving, we all loved it! I added some roasted garlic to the dish on the second try and we preferred it that way. I'm going to make it again this year for an October get together, but I'm going to hand blend it and make it into ravioli sauteed in brown butter and topped with the parmesan-sage sauce. I'm sure it will be killer!

The taste is great, but the texture is a little too smooth for me. Maybe I don't like flan? I might try this in a tart shell as someone else suggested, that sounds like it will add just the structure it needs in the mouth.

This was absolutely delicious and simple! I served it with a roasted rack of lamb, broccoli and spinach puree, red wine, and good friends!I also cooked in a springform pan - soo much easier! My biggest problem was preventing myself from consuming the sauce BEFORE serving this. I didn't strain the sauce as I like my sauces with a bit of "heft" to them. You'll LOVE this recipe!

any ideas on how to reheat this?

As previous reviewers suggested, I added extra parm cheese to the flan and also to the sauce to punch up the flavor. Served it with BBQ Chicken and Pork and sauteed spinach and baby chard. The mild taste of the flan was perfect with the strong flavors of the other dishes. It was a hit with my family and an unusual way to serve squash.

My husband loved this!! It is very good but on the rich side. I reduced the recipe for the 2 of us and it was a very difficult process with many of the ingredients being divided. But it worked. I added a little more half and half to the final sauce as it got pretty thick. Also, if you read the tip on the parmesan, the ounces/quantity in the recipe don't correspond. I always use 1 ounce/per quarter cup as a guide. So I used 2 1/2 ounces. The flan is great by itself but I highly recommend the sauce - very gourmet!!

I made this dish to serve with a pork tenderloin for Christmas Eve dinner. This is such a different way to serve squash and everyone loved it. It does have a very light and fluffy texture, so it is nice to have serve with some extra parmesan on top.

This is a fairly easy recipe, BUT you must like butternut squash and the soft texture of flan. This is a very very light appetizer, to be served with a heavier entree. The cheese sauce has very complex flavors and, without some TLC, can get ruined quickly. Try it, you may like it.

I have made this twice to rave reviews. Very gourmet. The sauce has very strong flavors, but it nicely compliments the flan and truly makes the dish. I had some troulbe getting the parmesan to melt, too, and might try the microwave technique next time. BTW, half and half is half whole milk and half light (or table)cream, not whipping (or heavy) cream, which has almost twice the calories and fat.

Apologetically slapping my forehead. I am very, very sorry, but I make TWO mistakes with this recipe. First, I put all of the cheese in to the flan, the full 1 and 1/8 ounces and for some reason I only put in 1 cup of half and half. I don't know how I made the mistake. Well, the two mistakes must have been complimentary, but, I thought the result was so good that I will do exactly the same thing again. Also, I used a food processor to get a very smooth butternut squash puree before adding it to the cheese, eggs and half and half. Anyway, I am sorry for the mistakes, but, try this recipe anyway, it is really beautiful to look at.

Excellent!!! I just finished testing the flan itself. I have not made the sauce. The color is simply gorgeous, a bright but delicate golden yellow. The texture was creamy and smooth. I did make one "mistake" I didn't realize that the cheese was divided between the flan and the sauce. I put all of the cheese (1 and 1/8 ounces) in the flan. I don't think that that was too much. I think that the cheese blended nicely with the other ingredients and when I make this again I will keep the same amount of cheese. I cooked it for 54 minutes and it still came out quite soft, but, not too soft to cut and serve properly. Some people have said that the dish was like "baby food." Some lucky baby. Yes, it has a very creamy and smooth mouth feel, it feels as if you have put a lot more dairy fat in the flan than you actually have. The flavor is mild and delicate, but, that is the charm of the dish. Food is always served and appreciated in a context. This would be a perfect first course OR a perfect side dish for a main course with very assertive flavors. If my main course had a strong, intense flavor, this would be a beautiful creamy smooth compliment. Perhaps others have already thought of this, but, I used an 8 inch springform pan that I originally bought to make cheesecake in. It worked beautifully. My springform pan has a non-stick coating and I didn't need to use the parchment paper noted in the recipe. If you haven't tried this in a springform I would strongly recommend it as it makes unmolding very easy. I love the dish as is, but, I have to wonder what would happen if I added some ginger or tumeric or lemongrass or sage or some other spice or herb to the flan. Hmm, will have to try it to see. Again, I can't wait to serve this to my next set of guests.

I don't know what I did wrong, because I was prepared to love this. It has everything I love in it. Did I overblend the squash? It was like baby food and the flavors are very subtle. Undercooked? Maybe a crust would help, so might try it as a tart next time? Maybe advance prep is a good idea?

I would describe the taste as delicate and savory. I made it for the first time for company and the lovely presentation drew praise. There was nothing left - only 3 people and a kid ate it all.

We had this as a Thanksgiving side dish (without the sauce) and everyone really liked it, except me, the cook. I found it pretty bland and would spice it up next time. Nice presentation, though.

I made this two days in advance for Thanksgiving--it was the first course. In the rush, I failed to add the cheese to the sauce, but the half and half warmed with the fresh sage was wonderful and not at all overpowering. My 18-month-old son devoured this.... The recipe is so simple, it can be made for an everyday meal. I do have to say that I used a vita-mix blender, which really smoothed out the squash. The smoother you can get the squash, the more delicate the dish will be. Lovely.

I made this dish as part of a buffet dinner for 24 people, most of whom I did not know. No fewer than three of them asked me for the recipe and many others of them commented particularly on the dish. I disagree strongly with the person who found the sauce either too strong or unnecessary. It is light yet very flavourful and "makes" the flan.

This dish is excellent, with or without the sauce. We had it with pork roast and sauteed garlicky kale and it was a splendid combination. Everyone who ate it plans to make it again, particularly at Thanksgiving.

Delicious flan, the sauce was a little overpowering though.

This was superb. A definite gourmet dish. I disagree with those who said that the sauce is not needed. It is a must! It raises the dish to high standards.

I seasoned the flan base with some salt and pepper so the finished product wouldn't be so bland. I also added a pinch of nutmeg. The butternut squash can be replaced with equal parts of cooked parsnip and carrot puree. Instead of a cake pan I used a 4 oz disposable muffin tin sprayed with release. It fits better on the plate with the entree than a slice.

Made this for Sunday dinner as a side to grilled steak. Instead of 1 large flan, cut the receipe and cooking time in half and baked in 4" ramikins. Felt the individual flans made a nicer presentation. I thought that the flan without the sage sauce was bland and it was a necessary compliment for flavor and presentation.

Dish is easy, delicious and attractive to serve. Have made it twice now. Served with red-wine-braised duck for dinner party. Both times, served it wthout sauce. Wonderful without it.

This was easy, quick and delicious. I had all the ingredients for the sauce but after tasting the flan, decided it didn't need any enhancement, so I served it plain. It was great.

To the person who asked the question about half and half. It is more similar to single cream. Half and Half is half heavy cream and half milk.

Can't wait to try this recipe as it sounds gorgeous but can someone tell me.....is 'half & half' the equivalent of english 'single' cream or 'double'?

The flan is easy to make and tastes wonderful with or without the sauce. The sauce gives the dish a very "gourmet" flavor with the unusual combination of tastes, like something you would get at a fine restaurant. I made it as a side dish, but it would make a good first course. Had a little trouble getting the parmesan to melt...perhaps it was grated too coarsely. I microwaved it at 1/2 power in 15 second intervals for about 90 seconds to finally get the cheese mixed in. Otherwise, very simple and reheated well. Will make this for my next gourmet dinner party. (My son and my in-laws didn't seem to enjoy this, but they are used to much plainer tasting food. My husband thought it was great.)

since we are living a low carb lifestyle, I am constantly looking for a substitute to potatoes, pasta and rice. squash is low in carbs and this is a outstanding recipe. I made this with texas barbeque brisket and the parmesan sage sauce was a nice complement to the brisket. again I served it for a sunday brunch with baked ham and the reheating worked well. this is definately a keeper.
