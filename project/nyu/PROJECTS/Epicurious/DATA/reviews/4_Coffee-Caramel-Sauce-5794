Truly delicious, I ate it plain, with a spoon, when it was done! I would have liked a slightly more intense coffee flavor, but the powder I used was old and may have lost some of its potency.

Very delicious! I was trying to get that "deep amber" color when boiling the sugar and water and ended up ruining that mixture. I then repeated that process and stuck to the directions of not stirring it and boiled 8-10 min. I don't think it was "deep amber", still light in color for me. Super flavor! I know it will make a great gift.

Awesome! This is so easy, tastes great over vanilla or coffee ice cream, and keeps well in the 'fridge.

I've been making this sauce since it was first published in Bon Appetit. I pack it up with a small loaf of homemade pound cake to give as a gift for the holidays. Most of my friends tell me that if I gave them anything else they'd be disappointed. The Chocolate Almond sauce is another requested gift from my friends.

I gave this sauce out as Christmas gifts last year, and I am still receiving compliments. A big hit!

This is very very good. Nice for an easy dessert over vanilla bean ice cream.

My two most favourtie sweet-flavours: Coffee and Caramel. This sauce was a delicious flavour, and proved to be favoured amongst most of the family. The best thing was that it didn't have to be made right before use, so I had time to make it.
