I was very excited to make this recipe yet more disappointed with the result. Although I took care to follow the instructions I cannot help but wonder if I made a mistake. I found it to be bland and unremarkable. It was moist and not too sweet (both qualities I appreciate), but I would not spend the time and ingredients to make it again.

Very moist. I made this as cupcakes instead of a cake and they were yummy. Only needed around 30 minutes to cook too! I also added about a half a cup of sweet potato to the mix and left out the walnuts. Needless to say, they disappeared quick!

Excellent cake. Better in bunt pan. Not quite enough for 2 loaf pans.

Great recipe! Used a powered sugar and cream icing with a little vanilla and it tasted wonderful. It lasted about 20 minutes at my house!

Wonderful choclaty treat. Ghiardelli's 60% cocoa bits really add a lot. My daughter and I used 2-1/4 cups flour and 3/4 cup cocoa. Very moist and good.

i thought this was a very good cake once i tried it. but i added more vanilla chocolate chip and did a mixture of milk and semi-sweet chips and a sugar glaze on top which Topped it off!!!!!!!!!

This was a great way to make use of the giant zucchini taking over our garden. The recipe is easy and forgiving--I didn't have enough butter and had to substitute 6 tablespoons of vegetable oil to make up for it. Also, in my house, if there's an option between nuts and chocolate chips, chocolate always wins. Lastly, I thought the batter was a little bland, so I added some cinnamon. I'll definitely keep this recipe on hand as long as the zucchini keeps growing.

needed a good recipe for a baby shower lunch at work. my coworkers have discriminating taste so i am always under a bit of pressure to find something yummy. everyone loved this cake. it held its own against some of the famous store bought italian pastries and cakes also vying for some spotlight at the food table stage. highly recommend this recipe. very simple recipe for someone who is not yet a seasoned cook who wants to look great!

Made this in mini bundts (muffin size) and served with brunch. Received compliments on them and gave out the recipe to 2 people. My husband even ate one knowing there was a vegetable hiding inside - he thought the chocolate made it worth the effort. I did not peal the zucchini, but will the next time as you could see the green skin. I think this will make it easier to sneak the veggie in.

I am so lucky to have found this recipe on the website. My Favorite Aunty makes this cake, which she has for the last 28 years, and I have never been able to duplicate it, and now I can. I do however leave out the nuts and the chocolate chips, it is to "foo-foo" for my liking.

This cake/bread is delicious. It is very moist. I added twice the amount of walnuts and it was great. I can't wait to make it again for the holidays.

I decided to make muffins So.. I put them in 24cups for 20-25 minutes. I cut down on the chocolate chips by 1/4, and I added more zucchini. These are VERY moist and delicious. I also used whole wheat flour because its better for you. Don't forget to fill empty muffin cups with water!

Yuck. This cake had no flavor other than that of the chocolate chips. Emeril has a good warm zucchini bread on foodtv.com, which is head and shoulders above this one.

This is the absolute best cake I have ever made. Moist and delicous! Everyone raved, and asked for the recipe.

Excellent and easy. I made a few changes based on reviews, I added 1/4 cup of cocoa in place of flour, used only 1.5 sticks of butter, increased the amount of zucchini by 1/2 cup, baked it 20 minutes longer at 300 degrees and added a chocolate glaze for presentation. Will make again!

This recipe is so addicting. I couldn't eat just one piece. I kept coming back for another sliver. I can't wait to make it again.

In comparison to the other zucchini bread/cake recipes I've tried, this one's a winner. It reminds me of pudding cake it's so moist. The only thing I'd do is add a little instant espresso powder next time to enhance the flavor to be a bit more dramatic. Overall it was dandy!

I have made this cake four times now and it always gets great reviews from those who eat it! I have made it both without and with nuts and it tastes much beter with the extra "crunch" of the nuts.

I brought this cake to the office and it received mixed reviews. Some said it was very moist and interesting, the others thought is was so-so. I liked the idea that it was made with zucchini. Don't think I will make it again.
