I made these as directed and they were delicious, but when I make them again, I will use less coarse kosher salt. The grains did not "melt" in baking and every few bites was a shot of salt.

These are my new favorite cookies! Hope I don't eat them all before my husband gets home. Substituted 4 T. brown sugar + 2 T. maple syrup for maple sugar and spread over parchment paper in a 7x11 rectangular pan and cut into 1 1/2" squares. Used about 1/2 cup chocolate chips. Otherwise followed recipe. Maple flavor was subtle, but great. Might try 3/3 next time. Try these, you'll love them.

Make the recipe without any changes. Excellent taste and texture. Baked for 55 minutes but maybe could have used a little longer.

I made this recipe with the maple sugar and a little extra maple syrup. My guests loved it and so did I. I found 55 minutes in my oven was perfect.

I made this exactly as written. At 45 minutes it was over cooked, so I will try again at maybe a lower temp.It is still delicious just not ready for company yet.!

This easy-to-make shortbread is great for fall. I substituted a combination of white sugar and artificial maple extract for the maple sugar, which I was unable to find. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

This recipe was delicious! I have to confess that I didn't exactly make it according to the recipe, though. I couldn't find maple sugar on short notice so I substituted brown sugar and replaced one of the tablespoons of sugar with two tablespoons of maple syrup. So that was fine; I just used brown sugar and the maple syrup on the top. The big problem, however, was that I unintentionally added 2 sticks of unsalted butter instead of 1 1/2! I only realized this once I had finished creaming the butter and sugar, so there was nothing I could do! I added an extra 1/2 cup of flour and tablespoon of sugar and the cookies turned out great. If I made it again, though, I would probably stick to the recipe! The maple syrup on top was a nice touch. I didn't have anything to brush it with, so I just drizzled it. It creates a nice crunchy sweet topping. I also found that I needed less than 1/4 cup of chocolate chip cookies. Oh and I used a 9" cake pan instead of a tart pan, which worked fine. Bottom line: this recipe isn't as fussy as it might appear!
