I used this recipe as the basis for a desperation dinner. I had sugar snap peas and radishes in the fridge and ravioli in the freezer. I added carrots and scaled the recipe down to the small amounts I had. Cooked the carrots with the radishes and otherwise followed the general scheme. I did reduce the butter. This cooked up in muted jewel tones and made a very pretty topping for our chicken herb ravioli. I knew that cooking radishes makes them almost unrecognizable which was just the thing as my husband really dislikes radishes. A good way to stitch together a Thursday night dinner.

The radishes were a nice addition to the peas (which I thankfully didn't have to de-string). I will make this again, but without so much butter.

I made this dish because I really like radishes and I had never seen a recipe where they are cooked. I won't make this again. The amount of butter was way over the top - made a huge oil slick with the radishes and peas swimming. Cooking the radishes made their unique flavor disappear. Overall a bland oily mistake.

FILL THE BOWL OF YOUR PALM WITH CHOPPED FRESH GARLIC AND SCHLEPH IT IN JUST AFTER THE BUTTER SIZZLES, ADD THE SLICED RADISHES IMMED. ADD CRISPY PEAS, S & P, TOSS. DON`T OVERCOOK RADISHES; THEY LOSE THEIR COLOR. BEAUTIFUL, TASTY, NOT EASY TO TAKE TIME TO STRING THE FRESH PEAS, BUT WORTH IT FOR SURE,IF YOU HAVE TIME.

This is a good combination to go with Asian food. I used a spiced asian oil instead of the butter. I found it somewhat bland but would make it again maybe with the addition of some herbs like cilantro.

I made this for easter dinner to serve with Sprial Ham and potatos gratin. It was a hit. The snap peas are sweet and the radishes are really outstanding. None of my guests had ever had radishes served like this. My one suggestion is that you really don't need all that butter, especially if you plan to serve another rich dish like my potatos, cream and cheese dish. Instead I just sauteed them in 1 tablespoon of canola oil with salt and pepper. I like butter, but this just doesn't need it.

You know your veggie is a success when it's the most talked about part of the meal. Every single guest had at least 2 helpings, some people had more. They all raved. My mom kept saying "I don't like peas, but this is wonderful!". Very pretty dish, very very very tasty. You gotta try it.

Not only is this a delicious dish, but it's a stunningly beautiful one too. The radishes become irredecent (sp?) with a beautiful fuschia color against the bright green of the snap peas. Also, when you saute the radishes, they lose their bitter flavor.
