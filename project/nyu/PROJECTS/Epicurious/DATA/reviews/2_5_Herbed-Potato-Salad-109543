My Dad recently had a heart attack so I was looking for low-fat recipes for a family dinner. This one was great and everyone raved about how fresh tasting it was!

Dill *and* cilantro worked for me =) We love it

I'm sorry folks, but I thought this was AWFUL. I've never been disappointed in a recipe from this site until now..... I would say that the combination of the potatoes, peas, carrrots, etc. was good, but the choice of herbs for the dressing was not. If I made it again, I would use dill and/or tarragon instead of cilantro. It might be worth trying again that way....I don't want to give up too easily!

Although a couple of people at a Memorial Day function asked for the recipe, but I had to really doctor it up. I recommend adding onion and garlic, and extra lemon juice. I added garlic and extra lemon juice and extra cider vinegar (but we were on a boat and ran out--could have used more...).

Very nice indeed. You can try another variation of the potato-salad (Cypriot style). Boil and peel potatoes. Cut into small pieces (the size of a wallnut). Chop green onions on top.Dress with virgin olive oil and wine vinegar (lemon juice will do as well). Finally decorate with fresh or dried mint leaves. We usually accompany this light summer dish with a can of tuna or sardines.
