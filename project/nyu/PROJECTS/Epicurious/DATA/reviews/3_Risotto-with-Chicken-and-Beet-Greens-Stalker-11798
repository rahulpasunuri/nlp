While roasting the beet bulbs, I made this dish. A great way to hide the veggies & use the entire beet. Don't forget the red wine vinegar at the end - it truly tied the dish together.

My husband and I both enjoyed this, much to his surprise since he read the recipe while I was cooking! It was a nice change of pace. I only made a half batch for the 2 of us, but had to use more than 1/2 the liquid to get the right consistency.

The lovely color that everyone talks about in association with beet risottos---is that supposed to be Florida-seaside-hotel coral? My husband and I found it rather off-putting.

My guests could not stop raving how good this recipe was. Just before serving, I did put a little black truffle oil on the top of each individual portion.

It's really, really, really important to get all of the grit off of the beet greens! That's the only trouble I had with this recipe. Otherwise, everything was great! The beet stalk imparted a lovely color to the dish, and I found that the mix of textures was really satisfying. Considering how little oil you use, this risotto tastes wonderfully rich.

Enjoyed the recipe but think the addition of chicken is unnecessary and detracts from the creaminess of the rice. Drained the excess water from the greens rather than waiting for it to evaporate. Tasty!
