This was a fantastic way to use eggplant! We only had two tomatoes, so added some chopped up roasted red pepper. Also subbed red wine vinegar for the wwv, and used mozzarella and sourdough bread. I sliced the eggplant about 1/3 inch thick because I don't like it too thick. Just wonderful!

I loved this recipe. I followed the recipe as is with 2 small exceptions. I added a couple Tbsp of chopped fresh thyme (just because I had some) and used white balsamic vinigar to the tomato mixture. Oh yeah, and I used my indoor grill. This one is going on the house menu!

This recipe is tremendous! I had white eggplant from my CSA and was trying to figure out how to eat it all. This will be a go-to recipe from now on that I will specifically buy eggplant to make. I simply followed the recipe but substituted basil for parsley since my plants were huge and it was easy. Double bonus that I could make the entire meal on the grill.

Using fresh ingredients from my local organic CSA. Subbed basil for parsley, red wine vinegar for white. Added a glove of garlic in with basil and mashed both with mortar and pestle. Reduced EVOO by using spray olive oil for grilling. Grilled everything, brought to table and served open faced. Made "seconds" closed in the panini press (added other cheese but smoked gouda was still on eggplant.) Both were great and received raves from whole family.

This recipe is a prime example of using great ingredients to get a fabulous result. Tomatoes IN SEASON, a really wonderful dense crusty bread, the finest olive oil and great smoked cheese (to me, eggplant is eggplant) and you have a most delicious sandwich. You can play with the vinegar (white balsamic?) and herbs (garden fresh basil--yum!) to adjust to your own taste. We have some really fun smoked salt that added that special touch, too. SO GOOD!

Delicious. The tomato-parsley salsa adds the perfect touch. Even the non-eggplant lovers in my family loved this!

Super simple and SO delicious! I've been making variations of this for years but I like the addition of white-wine vinegar and may even experiment with other vinegars next time I make this

Changes: added a shallot to the tomatoes. Grubalisious!

I'm not the world's biggest eggplant fan, so it's a bit of a struggle to find great things to do with them when I get them in my CSA. Despite my hesitation about eggplant, this sandwich was delicious! I loved the tastes of the grilled bread, eggplant, smoked cheese, and tomatoes mixing together. It was also extremely easy to make.

This recipe was very tasty and not too hard to make. I don't have a grill so I made it on the stove. I reviewed it in detail on my blog http://misschefy.wordpress.com.

This was excellent! I added bell pepper, basil and cumber in addition to the tomatoe. I also used Fresh Mozz.

Eggplant is an iffy vegetable for me depending on how it's cooked... and this recipe is DELICIOUS. I ended up with smoked provolone on top, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Very easy and quick, too. Shot right up to my list of favorites upon first taste!

i'm writing again because i love this sandwich so much. if you just add garlic to the tomatoes and grill the eggplant so its a little charred but very mushy inside, the flavor is sublimely delicious. i just made it again (at least 4 times since mag came out) and it was better than ever. vegetarians will love it - anyone. i think i might make canapes out of it for parties. anyway, i highly recommend.

Excellent. Was looking for a brightly coloured dish as an option for a vegetarian friend who would be at dinner. I used smoked Ardrahan cheese because that was the smoked vegetarian cheese available in the shop, and it was a huge hit! Everyone loved it, when I thought it wouldn't be as popular as the meat dish. There were no leftovers, and I made a huge amount!

this was great. fresh, easy - loved the tomato mixture for sandwiches. i used great crusty bread and didn't make them open faced, which was easier to eat. i've made them two more times in the last 2 weeks.

Completely underwhelming. The smokey gouda was overpowering and unpleasant- maybe just use a different cheese.

This was very good and very easy to prepare. I added 1 crushed garlic clove to the tomato mixture. I also used la brea bakery whole grain bread and i only had plain gouda (very high quality though). very, very good. served with a barley/veggie salad. i will definitely make again.
