This cake was good but needed some help. This is a great basic cherry cake and with a few additions of more cherry and folding the cherries into the batter makes it a whole step up.

I liked the flavors in this cake, but it came out too heavy for my taste and cooked unevenly because of all the moisture in the cherries, as other reviewers have commented.

Don't you love it when reviewers rave about a cake, and then confess to all the changes they made to the recipe? Well, here's another one: I thought I had enough cherries, but I didn't, so I made it with blueberries instead. I reduced the flour to 1 cup (wasn't sure whether the add'l 2 TB were for the cake itself or for flouring the pan, anyway). To make up for the lack of cherry juice, I put in about 1/4 cup milk. I was also short of almonds and put in a few walnuts to make up the difference. Result was a very tasty cake with excellent flavor and appearance. I bake a lot of cakes that are OK but I won't bother saving the recipe to make again. This one is a saver.

I baked this cake using jarred sour cherries and although the baking time increased it was a major success. Folks at a dinner party raved about the flavor. Also, due to dairy alergy I used dairy free margerine and also added a topping of julienned, blanched almonds which toasted and tasted wonderful. Can't wait to wow another party crowd!

As it reads now, this is a terrible recipe, not even one fork. It does not take into account for the moisture from the cherries, and the fact that they are only on top, which makes the timing and checking for doneness impossible. By the time the top is done, the rest of the cake is overdone and excessively dry, and unedible. HOWEVER, with one minor revision, the recipe goes from a one fork to a three fork. Instead of putting the cherries on top of the batter, and pressing them into the batter slightly, simply fold them into the batter BEFORE you fold in the stiffened egg whites. Bake at the 375 as recommended, and check for doneness at 35 to 40 minutes. By the third time I made this recipe, I also ended up using about 1 1/8 pounds of cherries, instead of 1 pound for a little added moistness, without going overboard.

Works great with canned cherries, sour packed in water. Looks beautiful and tastes great. Make sure cake is done. Cherries give off moisture and sometimes center of cake is not cooked as soon as you wopuld think
