A delicious and unusual beef stir fry. We used sirloin instead of flank steak, and took another reviewer's fabulous suggestion of adding sliced tomatoes towards the end of the cooking time. This is definitely one we'll make again.

Great recipe as written. I've also done the following. Instead of scallions, I used quartered small onions. I also let the meat marinate for a couple of hours in the soy sauce, cornstarch, rice wine, garlic, ginger, sugar mixture. For additional sweet flavors to complement the spicy, I used quartered firm small tomatoes. The onions and peppers are stir fried together and add the tomatoes later so as to not soften them too much. In both cases, even though I've tripled the quantities, there are no leftovers from serving five! ------- I also agree with other reviewers that no salt is needed since the soy sauce and chili garlic paste already has salt.

With no other substitutions besides sirloin steak I had delicious results!

I, and everybody I served this to, LOVED this recipe. I don't do too much asian inspired cooking, but I was seriously impressed with the flavors in this dish. The only thing I altered was to use sherry cooking wine, from the grocery store instead of the Chinese rice wine and I still think it came out fabulously. So easy, and so delicious! My friend has since asked for the recipe, which solidifies that it's a keeper.

Wow, I'm impressed. It's so simple, but full bodied thanks to the ketchup and hoisin sauce. Hard to mess up. I let the beef sit at room temperature for an hour (we experienced some delays with arrivals) and the beef was so very tender. I will definitely make it again.

I've been making stir-fry beef & peppers for years and this version is one of the best. I used London broil for the beef and, if cut thinly on the bias, it will be super tender. I also added some chopped fresh cilantro when plating.

Thanks for this recipe! I love the fact that it's quick and not too expensive if you use sirloin which I did. The key is to cut everything up ahead of time which really makes it easier with the instructions. I quadrup[ed the recipe for our family. I would suggest using a little less of the ketchup/hoisin sauce, and I used sriracha sauce instead of the garlic chile paste. Of that I used about half the amount suggested. Our whole family loved it and we're not a huge stir-fry loving family! f

Good meal and very easy for a weeknight. I doubled the recipe and added shrimp, mushrooms, brocolli,and a whole lot more hot chili sauce.

This sauce is so good and you can't mess it up - believe me I tried! By mistake I put the cornstarch mixture and the ketchup mixture all in one bowl but it still turned out great. I multiplied the recipe by 4 times and was pretty loose with the multiplication so this seems failproof all around. I only used about 1/3 of the salt because of the soy etc. I used boneless chicken pieces and broccoli instead of beef and peppers. If you like it spicy then the sugar helps balance it but if you like it milder then maybe reduce the sugar.

I made this last night and it was fabulous. I doubled the recipe as it wouldn't have been much for 2 people and the smallest piece of flank steak I could find was a little over 1 lb. I added some broccoli with the red peppers, and added a splash of sesame oil. Great!

I made this last night and my husband and I LOVED it. I doubled the marinade and sauce since I had a larger piece of flank steak and added Broccoli and mushrooms. I will be making this again! Might be good with chicken or shrimp too.

Wonderful dish! It is also a staple for us. The beef is tender and full of flavor. Serve this with steamed jasmine rice and you'll be in heaven.

I'm not sure what it is about this recipe, but I just didn't like it much. I feel like the beef coating doesn't work with the stir fry sauce at all. I think it would be a great coating with another sauce. I guess the sauce tasted like it was concentrated, even though I cooked it for the recommended time.

This is one of our staples as it is my husbands favorite. I change up the veggies depending on what I have on hand.

This was fantastic. I used ribeye instead of flank steak and I used asparagus, bean sprouts, red peppers, onions and water chestnuts as my veggies. I will be making this many times in the future

I agree with cook who said this is a great recipe for those who like to 'tweak' a good basic. I didn't measure the ingredients exactly, but I know I used more chili garlic sauce than in recipe. I'll probably omit sugar next time, too. Make sure to double recipe for 4, triple for 6, etc. I didn't have scallions so I used leek. I'll have scallion next time.

This was really easy and very tasty, though the recipe seems like a small portion. I used 1.5 lbs of flank steak (cut across the grain) and added broccoli as other suggested. Also, we prefer with brown rice - healthier as well. Very nice sweet and salty flavor!

This my favorite stir-fry recipe yet  very flavorful and easy to make. I like lots of sauce so I doubled the hoisin/ketchup sauce and also added broccoli.

This is a great recipe and easy to make. I tripled it to feed our family of 5. Rather than use several red peppers however, I used one large red pepper and a good sized head of broccoli cut into florets. I stir fried the broccoli and red pepper together. I used 6+ tsp of garlic chili sauce and served it over brown rice. Great! Even my children loved it. A definite keeper!

Decent for a week night dinner. Very easy. I tripled the recipe, used 7 tsp. of the chili garlic sauce and it was perfect (and we like spice, you could taste all other flavors), used mushrooms instead of the bell pepper plus the scallions and everyone liked it - served with jasmine rice. Tasty!

THIS IS A GREAT RECIPE! I SOMETIMES ADD PEANUTS, WATERCHESTNUTS, OR ASPARAGUS. EVERYONE LOVES IT.

Yummy! This has so much flavor. The meat is so tender. The only thing I changed was that I doubled the marinade and the chili paste sauce. Next time I will add some snow peas, just because we like them. One of the best stir fry recipies I have ever made!!

I made this for dinner last night. The recipe calls for 1/2 pound of flank steak, but I used 2 pounds and invited several more people to join us. Because I quadrupled the amount of steak, I also quadrupled everything else -- or so I thought! I inadvertently only doubled the amount of chili-garlic sauce. Well, everyone loved it! My son did request that I use the CORRECT amount of chili-garlic sauce next time, but he it enjoyed it none the less. The steak was melt-in-your-mouth tender. This will definitely be a repeat at our house!

Made this enitre menu. It was very good. The beef was flavorful and tender. The bak choi made a good compliment with jasmine rice. Super quick too.

Very flavourful. I was skeptical of adding the ketchup, but it was fine. Next time I will definitely omit/or reduce the salt and sugar as there is plenty both flavours without these ingredients. The recipe is a good departure point for anyone who likes to "play" and tweak recipes to get just what they're looking for.
