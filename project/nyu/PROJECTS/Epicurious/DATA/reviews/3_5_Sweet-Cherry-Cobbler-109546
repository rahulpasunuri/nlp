Considering the small amount of fat and sugar in the batter, this was fabulous(also with some changes suggested by others). I added the fresh rosemary and 1 full tablespoon sugar to batter, added lemon juice to cherries and topped it with maybe 2 tsp sugar. It is delicious --addition of lowfat plain yogurt on top is nice too.

LOVE to eat this dessert and LOVE to make it. It's easy, can be partially prepared ahead of time and it is always a crowd-pleaser. Like others have said, I add quite a bit of lemon zest to the dry ingredients before adding in the butter. I also sprinkle the sugar over the top much more generously than it says in the recipe. It's great with frozen blackberries too!

I am gluten free and the topping for this recipe is very easy to convert. I use an all purpose baking flour for most of the flour and then some xanthan gum or arrowroot as a binder. I also like vanilla instead of cinnamon for flavoring

I added an an extra 1/2 tsp. of sugar, 1/2 tsp. of fresh rosemary and 1/2 tsp. of lemon zest to the dough and it was so good I wished there was more of it. I loved this - a perfect not-too-sweet fruit dessert, lovely with fresh whipped cream. It got rave reviews from me and my friends!

Based on other reviews, I made some additions of my own. To the cherries, I added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. In the biscuit mix, I added a little chopped fresh rosemary and some lemon zest. Everyone loved it and I'll definitely make this again.

I also thought this was just O.K. I even added a little extra sugar per other reviewers' comments. My 6 year old daughter loved it, but maybe that was due to the ice cream on top?

I doubled the recipe and put it in a deep dish pie pan. It was delicious1

I found this to be easy and very good. I was making it for 5 people so I dropped the dough into 5 mounds. With some vanilla ice cream I thought it was plenty for 5 people.

The topping was very average. Not very tasty at all. Quick but not memorable

A followup to the review that said there wasn't enough fruit for a 9x9 pan... well, of course not. The recipe calls for a 9 inch ROUND dish. The difference between the area of the round dish (approx. 64 sq. in.) is substantially less than the area of a 9x9 dish (81 sq. in.). Now I feel like a math geek.

This was a very nice, small dessert that would make a great summer treat for a small family. I used fresh pitted sweet cherries from a local orchard, but used 15 oz. because some of the reviews indicated that 14 oz. was a little light. This was a fine amount, but cherry lovers might add 2-3 oz. more. I also apparently can't read, as I added ALL of the sugar to the whisked mixture (instead of reserving some for the topping). In fact, some reviews indicated that they found the topping bland, so I added even more -- 1.5 Tbsp of sugar -- right into the mix and still topped it with .5 Tbsp of sugar at the end. I also substituted 1/2 cu milk and a generous 3/4 tsp cream of tartar (whisked briskly) into the mix since I did not have any buttermilk. The result? Yummy! Two adults polished off 3/4 of the cobbler in one sitting!

Waste of good cherries. Not enough fruit for a 9x9 pan. Won't make this again.

I used fresh cherries instead of frozen, but I still enjoyed it immensely. I ate this as a breakfast food rather than a dessert!

The picture was perfect, mine turned out exactly the same, but I found the topping to have no flavor, no sweet, no salt. It wasn't biscuity or cobbler-like, just hunks of dry bread on top of a great filling. I'll use the recipe for the cherries, but with a different topping. Very disappointing.

I made this for dinner guests and everyone LOVED it. None of us found it too sweet at all--it was just right. Easy, delicious, healthy--I know I'll be making this one again and again.

I made this recipe several times and I haven't met a person yet who didn't love it. Delicious. I used fresh cherries instead of frozen.

Loved it because of the speed and taste. My family loved it and I will make it again.

Very quick and easy. I found it a little too sweet, so next time I will cut back a bit on the sugar and maybe add a little lemon or lime zest.

I liked this recipe, but prefer sour cherries for pies and cobblers. The topping was wonderful and I will use it again for other cobblers. I liked the size of this recipe--it made just enough! In response to the previous poster who found the juice too thin, I used a little more cornstarch and a little flour. The consistency was great.

This was quick to put together and tasty for being 'light'! A little runnier than I would have thought, but still good. Small serving but it was sweet enough that it hit the spot!
