what is this recipe even doing on this site? wouldn't it be more appropriate on sites for people who like to pretend they can cook?

I made this over the weekend for my father-in-laws 70th b.day. And I quote, "If I have ever tasted a better cake than this, I don't know when it was". So glad to have made the perfect cake for his celebration!

delicious. I used 1 1/3 c of water and next time would used a thicker layer of frosting and jam between the layers

I wish that I had read these reviews before making this cake for my daughter's birthday! When I made the cake, I suspected that there was far too little water, but I didn't adjust. The cake was VERY dry and disappointing. The frosting was too sweet, but it might have been OK if the cake hadn't been so dry.

This would be better if you didn't use cake mix. Why use cake mix if you can put some effort in to it?

This was delicious and easy, which are both good qualities in a birthday cake since there are a lot of birthdays in the world. I thought the chocolate frosting was especially good.

I made this cake for Father's Day and everyone loved it. It was easy to make and came out rich and moist. (I increased the water to 1 1/3 cup)

This cake was a dissappointment. The cake was very dry. I'm wondering if there was a typo in the recipe. It called for 1/3 cup water. The recipe on the box of cake mix called for 1 and 1/3 cups water. The batter was very sticky and hard to work with. The cake ended up like a big brownie. I thought it would be good, but it was not moist and chewy. The frosting and filling was great, but the cake needs to be moister.
