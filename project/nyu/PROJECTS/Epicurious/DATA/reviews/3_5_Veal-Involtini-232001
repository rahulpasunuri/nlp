This dish was delicious. I took the advice of a previous comment and baked for 30 with foil and took foil off after 10 minutes. Perfect. I will definitely make this again, however, I will use less pecorino. Perhaps with a nice side of pasta.

This is so simple but the flavor is fabulous!

Fantastic. Even with supermarket veal this came out great. It's much faster to do if you skip the bread crumb toasting and just use the packaged kind. I think I did this in about 1/2 hour from pounding to serving. The cheese and olive oil hold the rolls together and keep them moist,

Husband claims this is now in the top five dishes I make. I made it in the broiler as recommended and added orange pepper pieces to the skewers. Reminded us of dinners out in Rome this past spring.

We really enjoyed this dish. We grilled it on our gas grill and although it was very good we felt we could have grilled it longer than the 6 minutes suggested in the recipe. We added red and orange bell peppers to the skewers. All in all, my husband and I enjoyed it.

My first time to cook with veal. This recipe was very easy. I put it on a bed of marinara to make it a meal.

This was excellent! I baked them in the oven at 350 rather than grilling them. Somehow, the idea of grilling something that's breaded seems kinda strange. Baking then - covered with foil for 30 min and then uncovered for another 10 min - resulted in succulent, crispy rolls that were a huge hit. Will definitely do this again.

I made this for my Memorial Day BBQ, everyone loved it. I saved some time by using store bought Italian bread crumbs. Vidalia onions were in season so I used them for their sweetness. The final result looked just like the picture in the magazine.I will definitely be making this again

This recipe was a real treat - very delicious, attractive and a novel way to prep/cook/serve that was quick and easy. A note to all the dissenters: My husband has worked in the meat industry for more than 30 yrs. and you can be assured that almost no veal calves from reputable sources are raised today in dark, cramped pens. Thankfully, that is becoming a practice of the past. If you object to veal, why even bother clicking on this recipe when you know it is sure to upset you. Assuage your conscience by making something else and please leave the rest of us in peace. Thanks!

This dish was great - AND very easy and quick to make, with minimal clean up required afterwards. I definitley plan to make it again.

A filet, pounded, would cook in about the same time and give a similar result; a chicken breast, again pounded, would probably take longer; I'd probably brine the chix breast a little so it wouldn't dry out. However, I not sure that the flavor of the paste (garlic/parsley) wouldn't be masked too much by the beef. Mangia bene.

I have yet to make this recipe but i was wondering if you could subsitute a good cut of beef insted of using veal. i don't eat veal for my own reasons that don't need to be decussed but this recipe looks like it would be pretty good.

This dish reminds me very much of a veal scallopini recipe from my old copy of Helen Corbitt's cookbook (former head of Neiman Marcus restaurant back in the 60's). That recipe calls for the cutlets to be lightly browned, then braised in white wine. I think these would work very well like that too. There is some fantastic veal available at a local supermarket that will run you $19.00 a pound...well worth it. P.S. At our wedding, we served veal marsala. My father-in-law is a long-standing vegetarian for ethical and moral reasons, and his separate dish was mistakenly given to my brother-in-law. My father-in-law ate every bite of the veal with nary a complaint. Amazing what a few bourbons and good company will do....

This recipe was good but not great. Make sure that you are liberal when you season the veal. I used panko instead of making my own bread crumbs. It adds a lot of crunch and texture without the extra work.

Reminds me of a way my Mom made "Spadini"...with garlic and lemon sauce. I made it this way and served it with the garlic/lemon sauce. To the reviewer who made the comment earlier...remember...there's plenty of room for all of God's creatures...right next to the mashed potatoes!

Great recipe. I knew I would be having some finnicky guest who shun veal, so I made 1/2 with veal, 1/2 with chicken. Both turned out great and cooked the same. You wouldn't think you could "grill" with breaded food, but it works just fine. Adding extra vegetables (red or green pepper, grape tomatoes) wouldn't be bad either. Try this recipe out.

I can't get veal at my local market (yes, I LOVE veal) so I used chicken breast that I pounded thin. The valalia onions are available now so I grilled some extra along side the meat. This had amazing fresh flavor. Will certainly make again - WITH veal.

Now to review. I believe it needs more than just onion and veal. Not only for flavor but to give it more color as well. Yellow peppers would work here I think.
