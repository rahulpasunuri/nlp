Then, Redmond, why did you make a pancake that called for Sour Cream and no eggs?!? It's rather obvious that this isn't a latke recipe.

Was too thick and not fluffy enough - I like them thin and light with an apple sauce topping.

Although this is work to make (it's not easy draining the water from the potatoes), it is very good.

I tried frying a batch in olive oil and a batch in the bacon fat. The bacon fat made a difference! They were delicious. I will not use oil.

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but I'd bet it would be marvelous fried in bacon fat.

Potato Pancakes should always be fried in shortening not in oil....
