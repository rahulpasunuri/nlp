I thought was fantastic. I made it with the grill pork loin and fire-roasted salsa and it was a big hit. I'm going to try the left-over spread on BLTs, for better or worse.

this is a great start to a grilled meal. we served it with fresh vegetables in addition to the bread. we didn't think it was too hot as written, but i'm sure the heat of the peppers you use can vary.

I am surprised to see the other reviews that thought this was tasteless and/or unpleasant. We loved it! Made it for a difficult to please crowd and had people asking for the recipe. I do agree that one jalapeno might be too much heat (we ended up adding some white vinegar to take care of the heat) but the pepper and creamy combination is terrific.

Maybe it was the feta I used, but this had a very unpleasant flavour. Would not make it again.

I often use epicurious.com for recipe ideas. I joined today just to review this FABULOUS, tasty appetizer. Great for a Mexican dinner. Though the jalapeno I used was not hot, the poblanos still gave this recipe plenty of heat on their own! Consider leaving the jalapeno out if you are spice-sensitive. We loved it!

This was the all around favorite when I made the dinner "all on the grill". This spread made enough to have plenty and left overs which were fought over the next day for a sandwich spread and appetizer. Even tho I don't love peeling roasted peppers, for this I will do it. It's worth it. So while the grill is going trow on those poblanos and jalapenos. is going.

This was very easy and flavorful. I like how the heat doesn't hit you right away. It was even better the next day. will make again!

This was rather tasteless. I made it first as the recipe states. Then I tried adding extra dill and extra cheese but only a little flavor. I tried refrigerating overnight but still not that great. I was disappointed.
