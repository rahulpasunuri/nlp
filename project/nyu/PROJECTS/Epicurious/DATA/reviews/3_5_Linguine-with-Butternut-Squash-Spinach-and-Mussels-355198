This recipe had too many steps so I simplified it, & incorporated previous suggestions. I roasted the squash until it browned a bit, perhaps 15 minutes longer than called for. I doubled the shallots & garlic, a bit more red peppers, and added about 3/4 c. each of wine & clam juice to create more sauce. I added 1 lb. each of mussels and shelled shrimp. But forget cooking the mussels, taking them out of the shells & adding the juice back to the pot - put a shell bowl on the table instead. At the very end, I added the spinach directly on top of the sauce & let it steam briefly. Forget cooking it in the pasta water. Finally, I added the linguini into the sauce & stirred everything together. The mussel shells, the seafoods, squash & spinach made an excellent presentation, & the dish got great reviews.

Definitely a keeper recipe for the fall when squash is bountiful. I agree with the previous reader about adding 2-3 times more garlic and shallots. We substituted Delicata squash for the Butternut squash and it turned out beautifully too. Roasting the squash for 5-7 minutes longer brings out more caramelization but watch it carefully in the oven so it doesn't burn. We find that sauvignon blanc is a good choice to use for the white wine. Good leftovers for lunch.

Refreshing dish for the Fall. I added 2-3 times more garlic, shallots and a lot more red pepper, and it turned out to be an excellent dish. The olive oil at the end is a must, as it really brings out the flavors of the dish.

Thought the final product visually wonderful but a little bland in the eating dept. Would bump up the garlic and shallots and add more red pepper to give it a kick next time. the mussels were lost in the orange squash too but it was a nice fall touch as the evenings are getting cooler.

This was a great dish. I thought the flavors came together very well. I made is exactly as written except to cut it half (there are only two of us). Paired it with a dry Riesling as suggested and had a fantastic meal. I had to talk my husband into this one, but he said (completely unprompted) that this is a keeper recipe. I thought it was pretty easy to make, too.

This just didn't come together. All the ingredients are delicious, but did not form a dish. I did leave out the clam juice - maybe this is required to make a good dish

This dish was interesting because squash, spinach, and mussels are not usually eaten together, but it is a great combination. The linguine ties it all together well. I really like garlic and shallots, so I think when I make this again I will make more of the "sauce," or perhaps less pasta. Overall, it's a great main course, and is pretty easy to make.

I actually had to make tons of substitutions as I couldn't find all the ingredients, and it was still great! My boyfriend said it was his favorite thing I had ever made (and I have tried a lot of different things!). I had to use zucchini instead of squash, no clam juice and a mix of frozen shellfish (mostly mussels, calamari) instead of just mussels, but it was still great!

An excellent main course for a fall dinner. I caramelized the squash more than the recipe calls for in order to bring out its sweetness a bit more. Other than that, didn't change a thing.
