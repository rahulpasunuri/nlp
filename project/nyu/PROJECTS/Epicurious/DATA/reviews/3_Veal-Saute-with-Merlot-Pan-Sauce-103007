Should have followed my instincts and used white wine, which would have complemented the other flavors, instead of overpowering them.

This is a very quick, easy weeknight meal with vegetables we had on hand. I added rosemary with the sage. My husband really liked the flavor a lot, but I don't really like veal (it was on sale). I'll follow other suggestions in the future and make it with pork.

This was fine as a plain, weekday entree. I wouldn't serve for guests though. I agree with the previous reviewer who said it lacked pizazz.

This came together so quickly and really was a very nice weeknight meal. I don't know if I'd serve it to company, but it will definitely be in my bag of tricks for the two of us.

This was a quick meal to put together when you want something different. I would not serve this to company because it lacks pizazz, but we had it as a family for dinner tonight and the flavor was wonderful! I made this with fresh kale. My finky 12 year old ate it all up without complaint.

This recipe was so tasty! I dredged the veal with some flour first before adding it to the skillet, this is just so the veal doesn't get too dry. I added some mushrooms and flour to the sauce, it was so fabulous and full of flavor!

I used veal scallopini cut (already thin, tender and takes just minutes to cook) and thought it was great. Don't skimp on the wine-use something you want to drink! I add a bit more butter at end to 'finish' the sauce. This sauce also works well with Albacore tuna filets.

My kids liked it but my husband and I thought it was lacking interest.

I was a little dissapointed in this recipe. Theh veal was very tough. I am not sure if I browned it to much or if it was the meat. I would try it again and maybe have the veal a little thinner.

Very easy and very tastie! I warmed the veal back up by putting the cutlets back into the pan with the sauce once we were ready to eat. The veal was covered on both sides with the sauce and it was great! Perfect with a side of steamed artichokes and some red wine.

I made this for my husband and we both loved it! Would definitely make it again, as it was one of the fastest recipes I've ever made. Can't wait to have it again soon.

I've never made veal before, but I must have overcooked it (3 min/side). The texture and taste was like tender pork. If I did this again, I would use pork instead to save some $$$ and add mushrooms to the sauce.

I agree with the others - this was awesome! Very easy for a weeknight, I too sauteed sliced mushrooms and threw in at the end. I used a little more of both the butter and wine to get extra sauce. Veal got luke warm during sauce prep, next time I might nuke the veal a few seconds just before pouring sauce over. My boyfriend loves veal and thought this was great too. Served with sliced tomatoes & blue cheese salad, and field greens salad.

This was a delicious recipe. My husband raved and said it was probably the best meat dish I've ever made. Definately a keeper! Served this along with herb-roasted potatoes, fresh green beans, carrots, and crusty bread.

This was pretty good. I will keep it in mind for a quick weekday meal. Mashed potatoes would have been a wonderful side.

We followed the recipe exactly. It was great with the suggested broccoli florets, but we substituted the mashed potatoes with carrots and parsnips mashed together (1 large parsnip per 3 carrots, the same size as the parsnip). A glass of Pinot Noir was a beautiful complement.
