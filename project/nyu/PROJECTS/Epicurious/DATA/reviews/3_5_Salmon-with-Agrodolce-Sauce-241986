Very disappointed. Sauce was was too much for the delicate flavor of salmon. I'm glad I didn't make it for guests.

Great flavor and easy. The intensity of the balsamic has to do with the quality of the vinegar-William Sonoma's balsamic is much stronger than grocery store version... Sauce would be great for chicken, too.

This was a very interesting flavor combination. I'd definitely make it again.

This was a fabulous recipe - easy and delicious. I made it exactly as printed for a Mother's Day party and everyone raved. A real keeper.

We loved this recipe. You have to like onions and balsamic vinegar. You don't have to like salmon necessarily, but this recipe will have you craving more salmon. I will add the cous cous next time as suggested by another fan of this recipe. It would be a perfect accompanient. I served it with just a salad of mozzarella, radicchio, and mango with balsamic vinaigrette. It was yummy too but it might be too much balsamic for some people. The only thing that baffles me about the recipe is the instructions say to cook skin side up for 12 to 15 minutes and then skin side down for 3 minutes. I started out with the panko crust side down and skin side up and after 3 minutes the panko crust was perfect, so I abandoned their instructions of another 12 minutes. My panko would have been burnt to a crisp by then. I flipped the salmon over skin side down and cooked for another 12 minutes. This gave me a perfect crust on top and the salmon was cooked to flaky perfection but still just the right amount of glistening moisture. If anyone can explain the instructions to cook the skin side up for 12 to 15 minutes without burning up the panko crust, please do so!

Excellent! My husband, who doesnt like cooked salmon (only raw in sushi), loves this dish. The sauce adds a nice flavor to the salmon. I serve it with some cous-cous. Yum!

Only fair- the vinegar overwhelmed the delicate salmon.

I really loved this recipe. The sharpness of the vinegar provided a great contrast to the richness of the salmon. I'll definitely make it again.

Very easy annd very tasty. The vinegar is probably a matter of taste. I used the full amount and thought it was fine. My husband is an onion lover and he was overjoyed!

Sauce is great and easy. However, I wouldn't pan cook the salmon. I prefer grilled salmon done w/indirect heat. At $25 plus per pound for wild salmon, I don't want a fake golden pan crust to hide great fish.

Nice, quick version of agrodulce. I modified this recipe as follows: brush salmon lightly with olive oil. Mix panko breadcrumbs, dried dill, pepper, and salt on plate. Lay slamon skin-side up on plate. Raise, and shake off excess crumbs. Proceed as directed. Very yummy. I used walla walla sweets instead of red onions, and a yellow pepper mised in. Also, I softend the onions a bot longer.

easy, simple, and delicious. the sauce can easily complement steamed vegetables or rice.

I liked this. I'd probably grill the fish next time to add complexity but, overall, it was a nice simple dish and quite tasty.

Yuck. Can't understand why folks thought this was any good. There is a much better recipe on this site for london broil that is made with red onions and balsamic. I don't think this combo works with salmon at all.

This dish is so delicious that after a night of amore, he was still complimenting me on the salmon!

I agree with the cook from Scotland. I liked the recipe but found the vinegar a bit overwhelming. My partner loves balsamic so loved it, but I think in the future I'll shoot for a happy medium. I served it with wild rice and it complemented well.

I agree with the reviewer from Scotland. It was good, but the vinegar was overpowering to me. Even though my partner loves balsamic, I think next time I'll use a bit less.

An excellent and original receipe. Provides great opportunity for interesting presentation. The receipe quotes to use 2/3 cup balsamic vinegar. I used significantly less - a very good glug, but i don't think as much as 2/3 cup. Too much vinegar and i think the taste would be over powering.

Very good, even without the onions (b/c the wife doesn't eat them)to soak up some of the sauce. I will absolutely make it again.

This dish was pretty good, tasty and fast. A bit too sweet for fish for my taste, even though it was only a teaspoon of sugar. I liked the red onions and vinegar, though. Would make this again with even less sugar or none at all.

What a waste of time and ingredients. It was so overwhelming and resinous, it totally killed everything else on the table. Hours later I still felt like my tongue has been painted with turpentine. Had the onions been chopped finer, it might have made an ok but one-note chutney, I guess. My husband eats everything, but he wouldn't eat this. I threw it away.

Yum! We loved this. Since it was just for two, I only used 2 pieces of fish and had tons of onions left over which I used to sauce a cheese souffle. I love it.

The sauce is delicious! I overcooked my salmon (not the recipe's fault, I grilled it instead of cooking it as directed because I didn't want the house to smell like salmon), so the overall result wasn't as good as it should have been. I think this sauce would also go well with roasted chicken...or I could just eat it by itself!

Outstanding. Definitely a keeper. I paired it with Cauliflower Steak with Puree and the blending of the flavors is heavenly.

Do not even think ofadding garlic to this recipe. It would kill the wonderful sweetness. This is an easy every day meal but would also work well for a small dinner group

This is a 4-forker because it is sooo easy and sooo delicious. Would not change a thing. Served with rice and asaparagus. Would go nicely with polenta or orzo - anthing.
