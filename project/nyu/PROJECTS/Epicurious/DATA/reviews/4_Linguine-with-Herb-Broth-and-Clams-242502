Solid recipe. Put in too much pasta for broth after not realizing it only called for 1/2 lb. But rich in flavor, added extra garlic, clam juice and lemon at the end.

Great dish. Easy to make, but looks very fancy when served. Here are the changes I make to the recipe: - 3 medium sized tomatoes - 2.5 medium onions - double the amount of red pepper flakes - a whole head of garlic - an entire 750 ml bottle of white wine. - clam juice instead of water - add a can of clams (I like to use whole rather than chopped) per other reviewers' suggestions. - 16 oz box of linguini fini. - instead of adding salt to the pot, I let diners add salt to taste at the table bc it doesn't really need a lot.

This is an absolutely delicious recipe. I substituted thyme for the parsley, as I'm not a fan and added Italian eggplant fresh from the garden. I used only 1/2 an onion after reading prior reviews and found this quantity to be enough for flavor without overpowering. Consider this my go to clam sauce!

Really delicious. I substituted one can of low sodium chicken broth for the water and I used a summer mixture of grape and cherry tomatoes. My family loved it.

I was disappointed with this recipe. Iv'e read all the reviews and used clam juice, both fresh clams and jarred clams for extra clam meat, fresh pasta, fresh herbs, etc...my disappointment was not lack of flavor but that it was too sweet! No it was not the wine...I believe there was way too many onions and not enough garlic. If I were to make this dish again, I would used shallots and onions BUT only 1/2 medium onion, one large shallot, and garlic cloves chopped (more garlic than 6 cloves if you like a good garlicky flavor!) This is a good base recipe. Also, I would not cook the pasta in the broth the whole time. I would par cook the pasta and add to broth once reduced to desired flavor...if broth still needs starch from pasta to thicken it, just reserve some of the pasta water and add that at the end with the pasta to reheat clams and pasta. A squeeze of fresh lemon juice and a pinch of the chopped fresh herbs right before serving would keep this dish bright.

Oh my goodness, I made this yesterday and it was AMAZING!!! I will definitely make this again and again! I also used clam juice in place of the water as mentioned by others and I added a can of chopped clams along with the fresh clams as well. This turned out exactly as I had hoped, maybe even better!

Just loved this, notably the wonderful flavor of the linguine from being cooked in the broth. I used clam juice in place of water as well since it seemed so popular in the reviews, and an Italian pinot grigio. Thought I had fresh oregano in the garden but was wrong, so I had to do with just parsley and basil. It was amazingly good regardless.

AMAZING!!!! Made this for my mom for Mothers Day supper. She is not a huge clam fan so I used 1lb. each of clams, scallops and shrimp, also substitued clam juice for the water as others suggested. This will be my go to dish when I want to impress company.

I am not a pasta eater, but I love this dish as it is quite tasty. I omitted butter to make it less fat, used clam juice instead of water, add 1/2 tsp of chicken flavor granulate & ground black peppers, and added shrimp. I will definitely make this dish again and again. Serve with toasted rustic bread & nicoise salad.

Wonderful, versatile recipe. I use shallots to give extra flavor. I have seen others say here that it tastes bland, but the recipe clearly states salt and pepper to taste - just add more! With larger clams, I remove the shells.

This recipe is amazing. It may not seem any different from other Linguine with Clams recipe, but it is.. the reduction of the broth is key. It'll give you an awesome concentrated flavor. The only change I made was to use clam juice in place of the water, as another reviewer suggested. I also added a few jumbo shrimp when I cooked the clams, and they were a nice addition. You can really use any type of shellfish in this dish. DONT FORGET THE BREAD! You're really going to want that when all the pasta is gone!!

YUM!!! I agree with harrissc, this recipe doesn't even call for ANY salt and pepper until the end. If your version is salty, don't blame the recipe, it's either your crumby ingredients or your heavy hand. I put a small amount of salt and pepper in the broth before the clams so that seasoning would be there for the clam meat and linguini then made my final adjustment at the end. I usually make multiple changes to recipes. The only other change I made to this one is that I used clam juice in place of the water. Make sure you have a good crusty bread to help you soak up the yummy broth. VERY GOOD RECIPE!!!

Okay. I rarely review recipes and actually have never reviewed one on this site even though I'm a loyal subscriber to Bon Appetit. I chose to review this one because I'm so frustrated by people who choose to waste their time to review. This is such a great "base" recipe to work with and build and and has amazing flavor as is but can be even better. My problem is reading through all the reviews (not only this one) and I keep seeing "bland". Are you kidding me? You can use that to critique a meal prepared by others but no recipe in and of itself can be "bland" without your mistake. If you are the type that measures salt or pepper out for a non-dessert then you shouldn't be qualified to review a savory recipe. The only way that a recipe can be "bland" is because of your misuse of seasoning. I actually wish that all savory recipes said "season to taste" because everyone's palate is different. Guess what else....different ingredients have different salt values based on where they were raised. Guess what else.....different sizes of salt don't measure out the same. I'm not trying to be a grump, but before you waste your time reviewing a recipe please make sure that you are qualified to do so. No recipe EVER should be in and of itself considered bland. When I read that I skip the review because I know that person knows nothing about food and cooking. I hope this review helps because this is a fantastic dish and can be improved by a few additions. I mean come on....do you really think your palate is better than the staff at Bon Appetit? Wow!

I thought it was great. Always use unsalted butter when baking or cooking, that's a given. Also, I always use "more" wine than recommended. All in all...was very good. Perfect summer dish..and we're having a LATE summer here in the great NW!! :) Bon Appetit!

I made this pretty much as written and thought it was quite blah, but wound up with quite a bit of broth after cooking the pasta. I then added the juice of a lime and more garlic, reduced the remaining liquid and added a little more butter almost like a buerre blanc. This made all the difference and it turned out great.

I made this recipe for my wife and I last week and it was delicious. I would absolutely make it again. Here's some advice, get a loaf of fresh baked Italian bread and add bay scallops to the recipe! Not sea scallops, the smaller bay ones.

I'm a real "steamed clam connoisseur" and this is probably the best recipe I've ever had. I tasted the broth when the pasta was cooking and added a little salt and pepper. The pepper was a good idea, but once I put the clams back in, the dish became slightly too salty. The only adjustment I made to the recipe was adding a can of each: chopped clams and minced clams. I think using good wine is important for this dish.

I always find that adding a little lemon juice or zest to linquine with clams really perks up the dish.

Good recipe. I added extra red pepper flakes, and also stirred 1/3 stick of butter into the pasta at the end, before putting the clams back in, to make it richer. Requires a fair amount of salt in the pasta as well. Will definitely make again.

Rating: 2
Not as good as I thought it would be. Actually kind of bland-I added a lot more red pepper flakes, and needed to add quite a bit of pepper & salt to build the flavor up. 20min of simmering the broth reduced the flavor of the wine too much-I'd definitely shorten that time if I made this again.

Rating: 4
Outstanding! Great flavors. Only addition I made was to add some chopped clams. Was a big hit!

I'll try this again. I was feeling lazy, so made substitutions and didn't measure carefully. Used a smaller amount of clams than called for, canned tomatoes. Didn't measure the herbs. Baked the clams in the oven instead of in the pot. Added the red pepper flakes after everything finished cooking. Used fresh linguine instead of dried, which is maybe why I had so much broth. Used a French oaked chardonnay that I didn't want to drink. Added Parmesan to a few bites, and it was NOT an improvement. **Next time, measure. Use fresh tomatoes. Use clam juice instead of water. Use cooking wine and dried linguine, maybe. This might be ok with canned clams, for cost and simplicity reasons.

Rating: 4
Restaurant quality and easy to make! This is one of my favorite seafood recipies, always a crowd pleaser. Even my 4 y.o. daughter can't get enough. Only changes made were doubled sauce and tripled garlic. Don't use a heavy chardonnay, use a light crisp white whether it's chard, sauv. blanc, or pinot grigio.

I made this recipe exactly as written (used red onion as it didn't specify) and it was absolutely outstanding and easy to make. This one is a keeper and I will be making frequently.

I made this tonight for dinner and it is truly a wonderful dish, . As others stated, I followed the recipe exactly, except I added a can of chopped clams with all the juices and used an 8 oz. bottle of clam juice for the water. I also recommend using angel hair pasta, instead of linquine. I can see the recipe would lose all the liquid with such a heavy pasta. We enjoyed it very much and will definitely make this again.

I'm going to make this recipe a second time before rating it. Just made it last night and although it wasn't bad, I've had and made better. I will try it again though because I really like cooking the pasta in the broth (soaks up the flavor & only 1 pot!) and because I think the right wine will make all the difference. I wish I would have used a better quality wine since the recipe has just about a whole bottle in it. My broth was a bit tangy, so I have a great buttery white in mind for this recipe next time. Also, I bought 3/4 lb of fresh clams and used 1 can chopped / 1 can minced clam. I think the texture of minced/chopped adds an important texture to linguini w/clam suace.

This is one of the Top 10 dishes in my repertoire, which is high praise, since I'm an avid cook. Like another reviwer, I took a chance and followed the recipe to the letter: and I was not disappointed. The broth and linguine were incredibly flavourful, and it took most of my willpower to stop myself eating it straight from the pot!

This turned out to be a very flavorful and attractive dish. I did make a few substitutions since I didn't have tomato or fresh clams, and used bowtie pasta. I used two cans chopped clams with juice instead of the added water, and dried spices. Looks like I must have used a little more pasta than called for but adding a little water fixed that easily. I would definitely will try this again with fresh clams, spices and tomato.

Rating: 4
Absolutely loved it. Only change was to use canned instead of fresh clams as they didn't have fresh at my grocery store. I added three cans chopped clams with liquid. I can't figure out why some people had too much broth. Maybe they used fresh linguine instead of dried? That would probably not work if you are cooking the linguine in the broth. Or maybe they cooked with the lid on the pan. This was very easy and we will make this again!

I usually always change recipes up but this one does not need any changing! One of the most easy recipes I've made and so yummy too! Plus, who doesn't like a recipe where all the cooking is done in one pot?!?! One suggestion, try doing without the salt. I'm a salt lover and even I didn't need it. Even though I washed the clams thoroughly, the little salt that was left on them was just enough.

What can I say? This is perfection in a pot. Olive oil instead of butter still produces a magnificent dish. And,as this is my husband's favorite last minute dish, time can be saved by steaming the clams above the pot with the pasta already added. Pasta and clams finish in about the same time and the clams stand around less. Lemon basil is my prefered herb here.

This was enjoyed very much by two dinner guests, who ate every last drop. Couple things: used clam juice instead of the water, then added vegetable stock for additional liquid. If you use a tall, narrow pot, it should be enough to cook the linguine in. Also, unless this is an appetizer, a half pound of pasta is not enough for four people. It was barely enough for three, and we're not giant eaters. Used four pounds of clams, and it wasn't too much.

The pasta cooked in the sauce added alot of favor to the pasta and will be a new way for me to cook pasta dishes. It made the broth much more thicker. Overall, the pasta dish was good but not excellent.

Delicious!! A restaurant quality meal!! We made this last night and loved it. The only thing I will change next time is to use fresh linguini rather than dried. It took forever to cook the pasta in the small amt of broth. (Had to add additional water). A nice light meal for a warm summer night.

The broth was so flavorful and cooking the linguine in it infused the pasta with an umami goodness. I used shrimp instead of clams. I boiled them in the broth for just a few minutes as the recipe instructs for clams then removed them to a bowl and cooked the pasta. I added probably 1/4 c. more water by the tablespoon. Delicious.

This recipe was excellent. I actually made it with chicken instead of clams, and it still turned out amazing. It does tend to get dry at the very end when you're cooking the noodles, but I just added water and it was fine. Cooking the noodles in the broth defintely gave them a great flavor.
