Don't worry about these falling. You serve them upside down. I, too, used muffin tins with cupcake liners. The batter filled a dozen and spilled out a bit, so it was a bit of a chore to remove the paper liners. (Better than digging them out of the tins, though.) Tip to avoid sugar explosion: use near-boiling water. You'll have less hardened hot sugar to re-melt, too.

PS-by baking them in muffin tins, the bake time reduces. I did mine for around 20 min instead of 30. I used a cookie scoop and used a little less than a 1/4 Cup. And, I used a deep saucepan rather than a lg skillet, which seems a bit dicey and awkward. I put the batter in the tins the night before for their 12-24 frig time and had that much less to do day of party.

The poached tangerines gave the perfect tangy touch! The whole combination--cake, caramel sauce, tangerine slices--was excellent!

I followed the advice of another reviewer and used a medium saucepan when making the caramel sauce and put it in the sink while I added the water (thank you). I followed the recipe exactly and luckily, my cakes didn't fall. They turned out beautifully and were moist and delicious! I served them with vanilla bean ice cream.

I'm only halfway done with the recipe but I wanted to warn everyone that they're not kidding when they tell you that the caramel sauce might splatter when you add the cup of water. I will be scraping caramel drops off my kitchen for the next 5 years. I should have used a deeper saucepan instead of a shallow skillet as this may have contained some of the splatter. Also, might have been good to add the water over the sink so I only had one surface to clean.

Really good although I was a bit disappointed the way they looked before I cut them out of the ramekins. Kinda fell in on the top but presented nicely once turned out. Served with butter pecan ice cream really good and had tons of caramel left so I used it on a plain vanilla cheesecake. Heaven......... Also I poured the batter into ramekins and then refrigerated this way I was able to clean up right away....

These cakes are delicious. I followed the recipe, except I used a large-size muffin tin instead of ramekins, and putting 1/3C batter into each well turned out perfectly. I was worried that they fell a little, it's possible that I bumped them while I was taking a peek. This may account for the not-quite-perfect texture, but the flavor was so amazing it didn't matter. Served with the caramel and vanilla ice cream they were delicious! I will definitely make these again!

I don't know what the deal is with the negative reviews. I followed the recipe exactly (but didn't use the accompaniments, just the caramel sauce) and they were FABULOUS! All 7 guests eating them agreed and almost licked their plates clean.

Wow! We thought this dish was phenomenal! I have made it for two different dinner parties and it got rave reviews from everyone. I didn't make the ice cream but found that a small scoop of french vanilla was an easy substitute.

Wow! Easy, delicious, wonderful flavor and texture. I made a batch with the batter refrigerated for two hours, and another refrigerated overnight and couldn't see a big difference. Give this one a shot, you won't be disappointed.

This was delicious. I didn't have that many ramekins, so I baked them in a muffin tin, using cupcake papers, when cooled the cake slipped away from the paper. I found it very rich even without the sauce.

This recipe was really disappointing. I was surprised to see the recipe call for refrigerating the dough as the baking soda's leavening action started the minute it came in contact with the moist dough, but I did as suggested and chilled the dough overnight. Sure enough, the cakes, even after adjusting oven temperatures, etc., fell in the center and were not very pretty. Flavor's ok, but nothing special. If I were to make these again, I would bake them as soon as I prepared the batter.

I made this and was surprised at how good the syrup is with the cake. The cakes had a good texture and I enjoyed the flavors. That being said, my family thought there was nothing special about this dessert and I actually threw some out. However I did not make the ice cream etc and that may have made a difference.

Very good dessert! The cakes were really a great texture and the caramel was a nice addition. I ended up making them with walnuts, as I didn't have pecans. It almost had a pumpkin like flavor and was very yummy!

I didn't think this was really worth the effort. I would make this again with some modifications like adding more pecans and maybe some cinnamon. I don't have an ice cream maker so no 5-spice ice cream; perhaps this would be better with the ice cream (which does sound really delicious). Will try again but probably not any time soon.

I use EnerG Egg Replacer. Works very well in recipes made from scratch, especially when you only need 1-2 eggs. Mixed results with box mixes.

This looks fabulous but what changes would I make to have it in 1 large pan. What size pan would I use (8 inch?) and how long would I bake it?

You can find a powdered "egg replacement" in most health food stores...it is added to the dry ingredients, and then you add the appropriate amount of liquid to replace the egg's mositure. It works find for almost all baking.

My husband made these yesterday and they were absolutely delicious! The outside was slightly cripsy yet chewy and the inside moist and delicious. Great, rich taste.
