I have to confess I was pretty disappointed with these. I went full fat and used butter for my phyllo, and made a traditional chocolate sauce, but it was still not great. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but somehow the leftovers were better the next night. I'd definitely serve with whipped cream, or at least a tall glass of milk, they're not the moistest things going. I think I'll try some other banana/phyllo recipes before I did these again.

This is delicious!!! It tastes like it's 400 calories, not 155... and it's one of the easiest desserts I've ever made. For guests, try topping it off with a little light whipped cream and a drizzle of light chocolate syrup.

Fabulous, low-cal desert.
