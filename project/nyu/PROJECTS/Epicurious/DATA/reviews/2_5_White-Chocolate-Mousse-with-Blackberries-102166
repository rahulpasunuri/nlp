I've made this several times and each time it has been affectionaly termed "the chocolate mousse soup course". It does thicken up a bit the second day, but definitely not a thick mousse. Very good flavor but not thick.

Having read the complaints from other cooks about this recipe being too heavy, I reserved the egg whites and did decide to whip and fold them in at the end. The result was a light, but still rich mousse that got rave reviews.

I also found the texture to be more like pudding and less like mousse. I tried to freeze this as others have suggested but it quickly became a runny mess.

A close friend of mine is a white chocolate mousse junky, and I have long endevoured to find a recipe for it that rivals that of the favorite, at Escoffier in Ann Arbor Michigan. This failed miserably. Two attempts each ended in a runny, dense, airless mixture that was good frozen but was not the fluffy rich treat that I was looking for. Keep looking if you are searching for a white chocolate mousse recipe.

I must have done something wrong, but my so called mousse was runny and pudding like. Despite that, the flavor was far too intense. There should have been another cup of whipping cream to offset the overbearing white chocolate taste. I also went really easy on the liquer. Be warned this is nothing like regular chocolate mousse.

Just an outstanding dish. I selected this for a PBS show, Masterchef USA. I had made this many times now and it is just divine. I am blessed to have relatives that love to pick and store blackberries. Even more devine in the winter when no blackberries are to be had. Be sure to strain the seeds and practice garnishing this dish. I finally found a good use for my dessert glasses.

Very rich, but very good...
