Born Danish, now Canadian, this must definitely be our best.

Super easy and delicious. To make it easier just drain the herring and keep all the onions and everything it comes with -- don't pat dry. I omitted the chives and used smooth dijon mustard instead of whole grain for a smoother sauce. Also, be careful about pre-making the rye toasts because they get stale very quickly! Better to just use untoasted rye (you can use that mini sliced cocktail rye bread).

This is delicious (!) once you get used to the idea. It's a staple on the danish christmas-lunch menu. Serve it as "smørrebrød": open-faced sandwich on rye bread, garnished with fresh dill & chopped red onions. Fantastisk!

hard to find seedless rye so seeded dill rye worked. Was good on Finn Crisp too.
