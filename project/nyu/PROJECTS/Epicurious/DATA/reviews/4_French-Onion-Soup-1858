I dont really understand the 4 fork rating on this recipe... It's just onions and broth. No real flavor in my opinion. Needs less chicken broth, probably just only beef broth, and some herbs of some sort, like pinch of cloves or something. Not my favorite, but we might try again with some major modifications.

Rating: 4
I made the same modifications as previous reviewers, with excellent results! Added worcestershire, more mustard, thyme, balsamic vinegar, and subbed the white with red wine. I used raclette for the top, happened to be what I had on hand. I imagine it would be bland without those additions!

Rating: 4
This is the stuff. The chicken and beef broth adds depth, and the mustard and wine go even further. I used hot English mustard and an additional trick of cayenne pepper, and this soup soared for my last dinner party.

Rating: 4
Not sure how to do a 3 1/2 star rating, but agree with many of my pre-reviewers. I like the foundation, but added a few additional touches. 1 Tbs of Worcester Sauce, 1 Tbs of Balsamic Vinegar, 1/2 tsp of Cayenne powder, and tsp of Fleur de Sel. I also substituted the Swiss cheese, although I love Swiss cheese, but opted to go with Gruyere.

Rating: 2
Ok, but not great. I used a good beef broth, but that was not enough. I like my soup a but stronger. I added in more mustard, balsamic, thyme and used red wine as others suggested. If not for that, I think the result would have been super boring. I'm still looking for the perfect French Onion Soup recipe.

Rating: 3
Three forks because I followed the suggestions of others: 2 Bay leaves and 1 tsp. dried Thyme added with butter; 2/3 tsp. Worcestershire sauce and 2/3 tsp. Balsamic vinegar added once the onions had reduced a bit; 1/2 tbs. Dijon Mustard with herbs de Provence and Red Wine. Otherwise followed the recipe. Seriously delicious soup...

There's lots of good advice in these reviews for making a soup completely different from the recipe here. My review is about the actual recipe, unchanged, followed pretty much to the to the letter (except I use home made stock). It's delicious. I've made it many times and people love the mild softness of the long-cooked onions. The chicken stock and white wine make a subtler soup than one all stoked up on beef stock and red wine. And that's OK. One guest I served this to - formerly a manager of a five star restaurant in Paris - said this was the best onion soup he had ever tasted. So stoke it up or make as is, you'll make a good batch of soup.

Rating: 4
Wow! Yum! I combined all the suggestions - added 1T balsamic and 1T worcestershire, upped mustard to 3t, used red wine instead of white. Accidentally used 4 cans of double concentrate beef broth so cut it with 3C of water. Delicious! This will be my go to recipe.

I've made this soup several times, and the only thing it lacks is a herbal component. I add a few sprigs of fresh thyme to the onions along with a bay leaf. Makes all the difference in the world.

I've never made French Onion Soup before, but this was so easy and so delicious on this rainy spring day! I didn't read any reviews before I made it, so I pretty much made it as is and it was still great. Next time I'll try the red wine and I'll try cooking the onions longer as I didn't have that much time today. But it's awesome and I'll definitely make it again!

Rating: 4
After reading other reviews, I also altered the recipe by sub'ing a) (very dry) red for white wine and b) gruyere for generic swiss. The result was delicious and Incredibly easy to prepare. The flavors improve if you cook the soup a day ahead before reheating and broiling w/ the crouton and gruyere.

Rating: 3
Made this tonight and it was amazing! I followed others advice, used red wine, beef broth, and a little extra mustard. I also added portobello and oyster mushrooms. I didn't give it more than 3 stars because of the changes that I made. Absolutely recommend it, though!

Rating: 3
This soup is delicious, however I am giving it 3 forks because I had to make a number of changes. I used red wine, gruyere cheese, and regular bread instead of what was written into the recipe. I also omitted the Dijon mustard. I am French and the flavor I ended up with having made these changes yielded a soup that tasted absolutely authentic. Will definitely make again.

Rating: 4
I have prepared this twice now, and made all the recommended changes the 2nd time: all beef broth, red wine, dash of Worcestershire and balsamic with the onions, more mustard, bay leaf, and Emmental...holy cow. Best french onion soup I, or my mother (who's a chef) have ever had.

Rating: 4
I made the soup a day ahead, reheated it, then poured into 15 ramekins that were set on a baking sheet & put in oven to stay warm. When my company arrived, I topped with day old bread (which I pre-cut) and deli swiss, which I had sliced very thick, put back in oven and baked the soup. This gave me time to greet my company, then served the soup buffet style. Everyone loved it.

Rating: 4
Delicious. Added a little extra beef broth (1 cup), and extra mustard (1 teaspoon). Also added about a tablespoon of balsamic and Worcestorshire (sp?). Also used Gruyere cheese.

Rating: 2
I thought the soup was okay, not great. It was too sweet for my taste. I took the suggestions of other reviewers and used only beef stock, substituted red wine for the white and added fresh thyme and 3 tsp Dijon. I forgot the balsamic, which might have helped cut the sweetness. Next time I'll add bay leaf and some Worcherstershire for body (or maybe try the Gourmet recipe on this site). Interesting note: I cooked half the onions in a Le Cruset cast iron pot and half in a large frying pan. The onions in the frying pan browned nicely in about 50 minutes while the batch in the cast iron pot just softened (ended up adding them to the frying pan). Also, best use a spatula to scrape up the browned bits.

Rating: 4
Made this tonight and it was AWESOME! Cooked the onions slowly - about an hour. Used red wine instead of white as others have done. Set the broiler on low and used chunks of stale panini bread - also awesome! Overall this was a wonderful soup, better than I've had in most restaurants!

Rating: 4
Seriously delicious! I added balsamic and thyme, like the other reviewers (added them after the onions were carmelized). I used 3tbsp butter rather than 4, and used beer rather than wine since that's what was handy. I'm looking forward to leftovers!

Rating: 4
I've made this recipe a number of times and each time I am extremely pleased with the results. Basically, I follow most of the advice of other reviewer (thyme, bay leaf, a bit of balsamic and sugar in with the onions, red wine not white, and MOST importantly, cooking the onions low and long, at least 1.5 hours. My boyfriend says it's the best onion soup he's ever had.

Rating: 4
This was so delicious and while takes times, not a lot of labor. I too used red wine, beef broth and added thyme. Also used Guyere cheese (didn't have swiss on hand). Perfect for a cold winter night. Paired it up with chicken/apple panini. YUM!

this soup is perfect, so easy, and people always beg me to make it. amazing.

Rating: 4
I read through the reviews before making, as I usually do and made a few of the recommended changes. I used all beef broth, red wine, not white and a splash of balsamic. I agree that the onions took WWWAAAYYY longer to cook, more like 1 1/2 hours, but I felt it was soooo worth it. I've never had better french onion soup and a restaurant would be smart to steal this recipe, though now that I make it, who needs to order it out? I did serve them in ramekins as it was part of an all appetizer dinner party and that worked fine if anyone has need of appetizer sized portions.

Rating: 4
Had to add to my last review. I remade this and used the oven, on HI broil..the soup kind of covered the bread/cheese layer so I took it out and dumped some remaining swiss cheese I had left over onto the top and let it sit to cool. LET ME TELL YOU...when I tasted it....AMAZING....I'm telling you, French Onion Soup is my favorite type of soup and mine is better than most I've tasted in restaurants. PS...remember Onions are salty to begin with so be care when adding salt to taste.

Rating: 3
The soup itself was absolute great. HOwever, do not try to make this in a toaster over. That was my first try and the broiler setting burn the top so it was hard. the second time I tried it in the oven but I didn't keep my eye on it so before I knew it it was ready. Also, the recipe doesn't say whether to broil on high or low. The answer is LOW. And watch it like a hawk. All in all, it was great.

Rating: 4
I love this recipe. I too share it with people. My husband thinks my onion soup is better than most restaurants (I agree). I use all beef stock and red wine. The secret is not rushing the onions. I love when it gets to be fall and I can make the soup.

Amazing and easy. This is a staple! I have shared it with everyone I know who has ever asked for a french onion soup recipe, and always get a call or email about how wonderful it is, bar none. It's too good to save for just yourself. The only comment I have is it has always taken me much longer to cook down the onions until they are truly tender.

I have done this for a christmas dinner for 12 with duck and beef stock. parmeggiano reggiano and emmental on top. turned out great. Have done it a bunch of times, i use more dijon, some balsamic and sugar while cooking the onions (90minutes cooking) a little worcestershire when i add the dijon. also add some bay and thyme in the onions. turns out great. just cooked it for 30 at a company party.

Absolutely one of the best recipes for French Onion Soup!!

Rating: 4
Onion soup recipes do not vary that much -- butter, onions, beef and/or chicken stock and herbs. The trick is getting the onions right. If you get them right, your soup will be great. Sometimes my onions turn out and sometimes they don't. So I enjoyed reading everyone's tips on caramelizing the onions, and think I now have it down. I doubled the recipe so it gave me a chance to compare pans. I used a cast iron frying pan and a le creuset enameled cast iron french oven. I started out with medium heat and added a pinch of sugar and a pinch of salt, and then turned them down a bit after they started to brown. The onions in the cast iron pan caramelized quicker at first, but then the onions in the le creuset pan caught up with them at about 40 minutes. I deglazed a couple times and I think that helped. In total I had them caramelized in about 50 minutes. Once the onions were caramelized in both pans, I combined them in the le creuset. I used a touch more beef than chicken stock and added bay leaf, thyme and a splash of balsamic vinegar as others suggested. I finished with Gruyere cheese. I make extra and freeze portions in plastic bags for quick meals. Thanks for all the tips. I think I will try the versions with meat and shitake mushrooms.

thanks for the thyme sprigs suggestion, Dallas. What a simple and notable addition that really works. also agree with the red wine vs white wine people. go with red.

Rating: 0
A question, not a review. By the time I had caramelized the onions - a little over 45 minutes, they had turned to mush. The flavor of the soup was OK but I would prefer the onions to have held more texture. What did I do wrong?

Rating: 4
Really good! What onion soup should be. I added tons of onions and deglazed the pan like 5 times to get them really caramelized and flavorful. Added red wine instead of white, no flour, and accidentaly used smoked gouda instead of gureye cheese. I had a flighty moment where I got the two confused, but it wound up being very delicious!

Rating: 4
Made with the following changes: all beef broth, used red wine, cooked onions with 2 thyme sprigs for about 1 1/2 hours, used 3 t. mustard and 1 T. balsamic vinegar. It was amazing and my husband said better than he'd ever had at any restaurant! Will most certainly make again! Highly recommend!

Rating: 4
I made this for New Years Eve 2008. I used roasted garlic, mixed gruyere and emmentaler cheese. I'll try using red wine next time instead of white. It took 90 minutes to cook the onions. Also check out the best methods for making onion soup at Cooks Illustrated.com

I made this over the weekend for a dinner for 10 people (tripled the recipe) and I received 10 rave reviews by Monday morning with requests for the recipe (NOT KIDDING). I did the mustard, balsamic, thyme, red wine and beef broth suggestions... read though the reviews, and youll get the idea. Indeed I also believe a very slow caramelizing process is the key. Have fun with the recipe& play around with the amount of broth& I think I used a bit less that the recipe called for& its all a matter of taste of whether you want a thicker soup or a thinner soup.

Rating: 4
This was wonderful soup. I made a few changes based on other reviews and being a vegetarian. I added a twig of thyme and a tsp balsamic vinegar and didn't use the mustard. I used the better than bullion to make vegetable stock. I used 1 rounded Tbsp for 6 cups water.

This was a great recipe. I modified based on some of the comments made: added 2 sprigs of fresh English Thyme, 2 Bay Leaves, a dash of good balsamic vinegar, used a great White Burgundy (never cook with wine you wouldn't drink!) and served with a local ciabatta roll, cut very thin, with Gruyere and Parmesan. Will definitely make again.

Excellentand easy. A few small tweaks and a thank you to other reviewers who suggested them: two bayleaves and a bit of thyme with the onions, which I carmelized slowly for close to two hours. Added the garlic toward the end, also used a spoon or two of balsamic vinegar for depth since I used all chicken broth. Kids just loved this, the who pot was gone in one sitting. A definite keeper.

This soup was amazing. I doubled the recipe, and used 3/4 beef broth and 1/4 chicken, but found that it lacked some depth so I added an additional tablespoon of dijon mustard and more concentrated beef flavoring. Next time I will use all beef broth. I had no trouble carmelizing the onions with my non-stick skillet. A very low heat and stirring only occassionally is all you need. Everyone loved it.

This was great - followed the recommendations and caramelized with thyme, a bay leaf and a pinch of sugar & balsamic; cooked the onions for 90 minutes; used a mixture of red and white wine and only beef broth. The only thing that I would not necessarily recommend is putting brandy in the bottom of the bowl before you add the soup, like several commenters suggested. IMaybe I added too much, but I felt it overwhelmed the flavor of the onions. If you do go with the brandy, at least stir the contents of the bowl a little before adding the bread slices. I found the brandy seeped up the sides and soaked into the slices, which made each bite with bread VERY brandy heavy.

Ohh so good. I applied many other readers' suggestions: Used a cast iron skillet, added garlic towards the end of the onion cooking for fresher garlic flavor, deglazed with burbon, then red wine, added a little fresh thyme to the garlic/onion mixture, used all beef broth. This sounds crazy but I work in a tiny town of less than 2,000 so good Swiss, Guyere or Fontina is not available. I used pepper jack cheese instead...I know, crazy and not the "original" but it worked. I'll go to the "city" next time and get the right cheese. This is such a good basic recipie that probably any tasty good-melting cheese would work in a pinch...it did for me. This is a delicious onion soup on its own.

Rating: 4
this recipe is excellent and easy to make. I took the suggestion of another reviewer that sauteing the onions in cast iron works best, and it sure did. I did it in 2 pans, one a stainless stockpot, and the other in cast iron, and the cast iron really browned them well. The stainless, not so much. After I sauted them in the cast iron, I just moved them into the other pot to finish the dish. The mustard really adds to it. I also added some worsteshire. I used red wine. I reccomend this highly!

Rating: 4
This soup is amazing! After an hour, my onions were not brown, but they were very tender and sweet, so I went on to the next step. I added a pinch of thyme and a bay leaf when cooking the onions. Used an herb bread for the toast... and topped with gruyere cheese. Also added just a dash of bourbon and worstershire to complement the sweetness of the the onion. Can't wait to use some of the leftovers for french dip sandwiches tomorrow. SO good!

This soup was great. A real hit. The only thing is that you may need more than 6 cups of broth.

I think this recipe worked well. The trick is getting the onions to carmelize - which takes time. Other reviews suggested using more beef broth to get the deep color. I used a variety of pans to carmelize and found that using a non-stick pan does not work well. It prevents being able to deglaze the pan, which gives the color and flavor. Of the 3 pans I used, the cast iron skillet was best, providing beautiful color and carmelizing in under 45 minutes. I added the garlic well into the cooking process - so it wasn't too mild. I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil in recommended quantities. This was delicious - I seldom give 4 forks.

Rating: 4
The key to this soup and any other is using both chicken AND beef stock. The addition of gruyere cheese in french onion soup is so much better than parmesan or swiss! Really good receipe!

Made this last night and it was unbelieveably delicious. I have several recipes for french onion soup and this one is by far the best. I used all beef broth and red wine as some had suggested and it made a nice rich, deep, flavourful broth. It took me about 90 minutes or so to carmelize the onion as well, not 45 minutes.

Great Soup. Like previous reviewers I use gruyer and beef stock only. I would have to say take your time with Caramelizing the onions though. 45 minutes is pushing it. Slower is better, with less risk of burning therefore you don't need to watch it as closely.

Wow, this recipe was wonderful! I'll be making it for the holidays. I made a few changes, and it came out perfect, that I could have eaten soup for the whole meal! I used red wine, instead of white. No chicken broth, just beef broth. I added 1 tsp Thyme and used Gruyere cheese (reviewer suggested these changes, and it was an excellent suggestion). Also, I made the soup ahead of time, and then refridgerated it. Then the soup was too thick, so I added some more beef broth during the reheating, and it was fine. Otherwise, this was the best French Onion Soup I've ever had.

I made this to use leftover beef broth with red wine from a short rib dish and homemade chicken broth that wouldn't fit in the freezer. The dish went together in a flash. I liked the Swiss and Parmesan combination. I set the toast in the soup and immersed it and added the cheese on top till it melted. I also used Vidalia onions. So easy and so good!

Wonderful and easy recipe! I used an 11" diameter saute pan that was 4" deep and had no problems caramelizing the onions. I used all beef stock, red wine and gruyere cheese and it tasted even better than most restaurants.

I make this soup at least once a week during the fall and winter months. The only thing I add is a tsp of thyme. It's so comforting. To kshalvo, I use a very large fry pan to carmelize my onions because it has a much larger cooking area, after I transfer the onions to my pot, I deglaze the pan with a little broth and pour that into the pot with the rest of the ingredients. Try this recipe everyone, it's awesome!

HELP! I always have trouble with French Onion because of carmelizing the onions. I do have a large sauce pot, but since this recipe calls for 6 onions, they seem to steam rather than carmelize...even a half hour into it. I use the biggest diameter pot I have. Any suggestions? Greatly appreciated!!!

This soup is out of this world with the changes recommended. I also used all beef broth, and red wine. I also added a dash of worcestershire and sherry. Didn't even make it to a bowl I just stood at the cooker and ate it out the pan with crusty bread!! Will do it properly tonight though with gruyere toasts. Fantastic recipe I'll be making this again and again!

yummy, i used all beef broth. It was actually the liquid leftover from our St Patty's corned beef dinner. That broth was flavored with a beer, bay, peppercorns. I added Sherry to the soup and Worcestershire but no white wine. It was a great soup and felt like I had put all that leftover broth to good use!

This dish is great. The key to getting the onions carmelized is patience and a big pan. I use the largest Caphalon pan available which is 12 inches in diameter and 3 inches deep. I also use red wine and only beef stock rather than white wine and chicken stock for a bolder/richer flavor.

Rating: 4
I like this recipe, its chief contribution all that sweet garlic! But I would peel it, then softly mash it, to avoid the fusile oils. Often, we make too much of the caramelization routine. For 40 years, I have used Julia Childs' method, with the addition of a little salt and sugar at the high end of a mere half-hour saute in olive oil. The oven method seems to me excessive, and I wonder if those poor rural French who long ago concocted this dish would have had the time, laborers as they were. Apart from that, it is simple. If we make this dish too complicated, we'll enjoy it less often. By all means, do some excellent brandy, just a quarter cup or so, but add it to the end of the sugar and salt saute, and dry it up so as to create a little smoky taste. French onion soup, of course, always tastes best the next day. But who can wait? So make it in large quantity to savour today, and to revel in tomorrow. And it can't hurt to go to a really stinky cheese for the gratinee. I have even used Maytag Blue! Be creative! For the bread, find a nice whole wheat baguette. Just a final thought, if you want, put a mere teaspoon of the leftover brandy into each bowl for the browning of the cheese, and you'll get some nice burning. I am an old guy, and I assure you my method really works for a fine stinky dish.

I was able to make this VEGETARIAN with great success. It was just as tasty as I remembered the authentic to be. I used a full box/container of vegetable stock, and also added two "beef" bouillon cubes. I also sprinkled some fresh thyme in to the caramelizing onions. It was wonderfully flavorful!

Turned out much better than I expected it to. A few changes I made... Definately keep the mustard, adds a good flavor, I added about a tbsp. of sugar to the onions while they were sauteeing with the wine(I used red wine-merlot) and added a 1/4 cup of sherry cooking wine as well. Also- i used all beef broth, no chicken. Little bit of salt and fresh ground pepper- Excellent!

I halved this recipe (dinner for one tonight!) and also made some modifications - used all beef broth, no garlic, part port and part sherry for the glaze, added some sugar as suggested to the onions to help the carmelizing process along and used a 4 cheese Italian blend instead of the suggested swiss/gruyere. Excellent soup - will definitely make again! Would have paired great with a glass of wine, but since I'm pregnant, I'll have to wait til next time to test out that theory!

Rating: 4
With modifications this is the best french onion soup I've had. Use shallots in addition to the onions, it adds depth, and when you cook the onions add a few tablespoons sugar to bring out the flavor of the onions (don't worry the salt from the broth will overpower the sweetness and just leave extra flavor). Also, add another 1/4 cup sherry on top of the dry white wine for more dimension. As the other reviews suggest, don't leave out the mustard, its adds depth.

Rating: 4
The soup was delicious. I was so proud of myself and my boyfriend loved it. Dijon mustard is my new favourite ingredient. Canned stock is way too salty, so I used my own... and for lack of white wine, I used a little Black Seal rum. It was soooo good. I will definitely make it again.

Rating: 4
This is the best French Onion Soup recipe I have ever tasted when modifications are made. I use a non-stick pot, and carmelization occurs around an hour and a half. I also use red wine, a heaping teaspoon of Dijon mustard and beef and chicken stock (4 cups and 2 cups, respectively). You can't taste the mustard, but it adds depth that you don't get without it. Try it with the mustard first before omitting it completely, you will be glad you did.

this is an excellent soup! again, used red wine instead of white. used gruyere and 3 different types of onions (roasted whole for at least one hour in the oven prior to sauteeing). i would recommend making the soup part one day in advance (aside from the broiling part, of course). it allows the onion and the broth flavors to marry nicely.

Rating: 4
Combining the advice of various reviewers, I made this using red wine instead of white, a 2:1 ratio of beef to chicken broth, and four kinds of onions: spanish, vidalia, white, and red (mostly vidalia). I also used gruyere for the swiss cheese portion. It was delicious and rich, but not too rich if eaten in a small portion--a great first course.

Very good. I took others advice from this and other reviews, and I baked the onion and garlic, whole, at 375 for an hour, then peeled and sliced. gave the onion a wonderful sweet flavor. made a double batch, and even after baking the onion, I carmelized for an hour, and this wasnt enough. patience is the name of the game here, take your time carmelizing the onions, and keep the heat low, or risk burning (which I did). I didnt add the mustard, and I dont think you will need it. I would also add more beef broth, I like my onion soup with more broth and less onion, this worked out, as I ended up adding more, which made more soup. Also used a good red wine (merlot), which gave the soup a nice kick.

This recipe is absolutely fabulous - better than any onion soup I've had in a restaurant. It's deep flavoured - and yet subtle. You can taste the wine without it being overpowering. I modified the recipe somewhat in that I used a vegetable stock instead of the two meat stocks - but I used this fabulous roasted vegetable stock recipe that I also found in Epicurious. The roasted vegetable stock is rich and dark coloured like a beef broth - and also happens to be wine based - so it likely added to the depth of flavour of the soup. The soup was absolutely incredible!

Because I'm vegetarian I made this soup with vegetable broth and It was really good! I also took the advice of others and added more mustard and more wine. I used white wine but then added a splash of red! I think that this added another layer of flavour. I think next time I will add more garlic because I didn't really taste it in the dish. Really worth the work!

With the modifications I made, this was easily the best onion soup I ever tasted. First, I used seven different kinds of onion (red, white, yellow, vidalia, texas, leek, and scallions), for interest and taste depth, and caramelized long and slow (Martha Stewart's advice). The folks who recommended red wine sounded right, so I went even further and used Port. I had made fresh beef broth for this soup, so I cut up the london broil meet I used for that right into the soup in small pieces, and since I had made a rich turkey broth recently, substituted that for the chicken broth. Then as it all simmered I kept adding white pepper until it felt right on the tonguemaybe as much as a teaspoon? Even with low-fat cheese, and even without cheese, it was yummy!!

As far as French Onion Soups go, this one was way to mild for my taste. I think if it was entirely beef broth based and called for red wine, it would be much better

I'm a novice cook who is slowly beginning to navigate my kitchen. The onions smelled and tasted gorgeous, but I was a little disappointed by how tart and acidic this soup was. I assume this was because of the white wine. I'd love some feedback- is this because I used an inexpensive bottle? Is white wine supposed to be very tart? I have an aversion to alcohol (both taste-wise and chemically) but I assumed that the alcohol content would suffuse out of the soup during cooking, leaving only its flavor.

I honestly do not know why everyone was saying this soup was delicious because it was not. I love French onion soup but this was a big disappointment. This is not worthy of adding to my recipe book. I will not make this again.

Comedy of errors. I got a deal on Walla Walla onions. They were huge and I had more onions than my soup pot could handle. They wouldn't brown and turned to mush by the time I gave up. The finished product, thanks to the onions, was too sweet to eat. Yes I will try again using normal onions!

The soup was very good. However, these are the changes I made to this recipe which made it excellent. added two tablespoons of honey, 1 tablespoon of steak sauce while cooking the onions, I also added 1 can of vegetable broth.

A really excellent french onion soup. Like many reviewers before me, I carmelized the onions for about an hour and a half, used red wine, toasted my bread before broiling, and heaped on plenty of quality guyere cheese. Next time, I might cut back on the onions a bit (or increase the stock). Perhaps my vidalias were larger than anticipated. At any rate, this one's a winner and will certainly become a staple at our house.

Rating: 3
Have made this soup several times with different variations. I think either red or white wine is fine, brandy or cognac (even sherry) at the end. The 2 things that are key to this recipe are, as others have stated, spend a lot of time carmelizing the onions and invest in a good strong gruyere-it will hold up to the soup. Montery Jack, Mozzarella and even a cheap grueyere are too mild in my opinion.

I tried a number of recipes...but used this with a few variations. Biggest tip I got from the chefs association on NYC.. is to roast the onions with the skins on..375 for about an hour..peel the skins and then slice.. they retain their sweetness, then glaze in the butter and wine. Just before serving, add a tsp of cognac, and use smoked gruyere cheese..omit the mustard..it was awesome.. my boyfriend wants me to make it again!!!

Excellent recipe for a basic French Onion Soup. I was looking for a different version of one of my favorite soups, and the addition of mustard caught my eye. I did make a few changes; I watch my calories, so I only used 1 tablespoon of butter and lots of Pam to saute the onions in. I sauteed them over a lower heat for a longer time. I also only had homemade beef broth, so I did not use any chicken broth. But this was a great variation on a old standby. I highly recommend this recipe.

Rating: 4
Fantastic recipe. 40 minutes is definitely not long enough to cook the onions. At least an hour, hour and 15, but if you have the time, that's what makes this recipe so good. Also gotta use good beef stock, and use 4-2 with the chicken. With the extra time, though, it's definitely worth the wait.

Rating: 3
I used 2 cans beef/one can chicken broth. I also added a little worsteshire sauce before adding the wine (marsala was all I had, which added a sweet flavor). I wish I would have browned the onions a bit more. 1 hour was not enough, but I was on a time limit. The mustard added an interesting flavor, but it might have overpowered it too much. I'll make this again, but only with a lot of time to do so.

Rating: 3
I had to doctor this one up a bit. More beef stock like the other recommendations and I only used 3 good-sized onions, I guess we prefer more broth than onions. I also suggest broiling only the bread topped with cheese then put them in the soup. Other wise it turns in to a soppy mess when the bread absorbs too much of the broth.

Rating: 3
Great recipe. Used red wine instead and pre-toasted the bread. Excellent taste and easy to prepare. Thanks.

Rating: 3
This rates a 3.5 forks for me. I followed the reviewers' suggestions -- use the 4-2 cup ratio of beef to chicken broth, take a full hour to carmelize the onions and use red wine (I used a Cabernet). Like another reviewer below, I kind of missed the nutty flavor a sherry imparts, but apart from that it was really good. My husband said it was better than the onion soup at our favorite restaurant. Delicious!!

Rating: 3
I made this the day ahead (used a cast iron pan for better flavor of onions). Go easy on the mustard, but don't forget red wine/garlic. Did not have french onion soup bowls.. so the next day, I made croutons and then put the cheese over the soup/croutons, which melted nicely. 1st time making this and it was a big hit!

Made the recipe with red wine instead of white, but otherwise as written. Not the worst French Onion soup I have ever had, but I would not make it again.The onion flavor came through as harsh,had a bowl for lunch and tossed the rest, and we love french onion soup. I have made the cooks illustrated version many times, and feel it yields a much better soup, with better depth of flavor,for about the same amount of effort and that is the recipe I will continue to use.

Rating: 4
Great Onion Soup! I followed the suggestions from many previous reviewers (red wine, more beef stock, mustard) -- thanks for the tips. I made enough for 20 as we were hosting a large crowd. The tips on doing the croutons in the oven ahead of time worked out great, I may even do that in the future for a smaller group as I don't like the soup too hot. I cooked about 1/3 of the onions in the crockpot as a previous reviewer suggested and it turned out as good as the ones I did on the stove.

Rating: 4
Great recipe. I cooked the onion for almost an hour. Added more mustard. Used Gruyere cheese, yum. Also used a little more beef stock than chicken. Didn't have any red wine, but had a little port left. Worked fine. It helps to have that touch of some kind of red wine. Loved it!

Rating: 4
Best french onion soup ever! Made the recipe with the 2:1 beef to chicken stock ratio suggested by others, used a heaping tablespoon of mustard, gruyere cheese, red wine, and used two bay leaves. I suggest letting the bread soak in the soup and then putting the soup under the broiler toasting it then putting the cheese on top and toasting again. It gives the surface a crisp consistency letting your spoon crack through the surface without pushing the toast to the bottom of the cup. Even though the Gruyere cheese is expensive use it, it makes the difference.

Rating: 2
I used red wine instead of white, a lot more mustard, a dash of finely chopped celery, and cooked a little extra red wine and a bay leaf into the stock before adding it to the carmelized onions. It was so rich and wonderful that I almost want to use even less beef stock than recommended next time I make it. Mmm.

This is a very good soup although I agree that red wine is better. Save time by cooking the onions in a crockpot. Slice, add 1/2 cup butter and cook on low for 12 to 14 hours. It is almost impossible to overcook them and the juice left in the pot makes a delicious addition to the soup. Refridgerate the juice and take off the onion flavored butter before using. The butter is wonderful for sautes and stir fries.

This is a very good starting point for french onion soup..Personally for me red wine and gruyere cheese are a must. Using chicken stock as well as beef lightens it up a little which is nice. We made it last night and it was a perfect meal after coming in and shovelling all the snow that we were blessed with last night. Comfort food at it's best!

I took the other reviewers suggestions and used 4 cans of beef broth and 1/2 can of chicken, red wine instead of white and Gruyere and Swiss cheese. This turned out superb. My husband said it was better than any French Onion Soup he'd ever had plus it was easy to make. Instead of grating the cheese, I just sliced it and it worked fine. I'd recommend this.

I doubled the recipe and it was excellent, though it increased the entire preparation and cooking time to 3 hours. Important: Don't rush the onions or the result will be bitter. Sauté slowly just until the liquid evaporates. Your onions may not brown, but should smell sweet. I used 4 cups beef broth and 2 of chicken, and used a dry cabernet sauvignon and dried thyme. We were using plastic bowls at a party, so I shredded gruyere and some parmesan on sourdough toast, broiled until the cheese melted, and added them to the bowls of soup for the final touch. Outstanding!

Tastes better on the second day. Cheese choices limited so I used Montery Jack. Agree with the changes of increased beef broth.

I followed the recipe EXACTLY as written with pleasing results. However, the previous posters are astute in recommending increasing the beef broth ratio (4 cups to 2 cups would be better to give it a little more flavor). I will also increase the dijon slightly and include a bay leaf or fresh thyme next time. I thought the soup needed a little more flavor. I did use the gruyere cheese though which I would definitelu do again. Additionally, I used HUGE sweet onions, so for ease of cutting I chopped them in half and then into slices. By the time they were brown, they had dessicated slightly, so I think it would be better to leave them in whole, thin rings.

I took the advice of some of the other raters and made a few changes: 3 cans of beef broth, 1 of chicken, upped the wine a bit and used Gruyère cheese.

After a lifelong love affair with French Onion soup, I finally broke down and bought bowls and decided to try making it myself, and I must say I was delighted with the results.

Of the French Onion Soups on this site, this is perhaps the best. I follow this but like to toss in a few Bay Leaves and I prefer Gruyère cheese. The mustard and wine are great additions. Any serious cook has their own twist on onion soup, but this is a pretty good starting point.

This recipe has become the gold standard for french onion soup in our home. Absolutely wonderful! We do, however brown the onions a little longer (adding an additional 1/4 cup wine during the last 10 min. of onion browning) and add a little more mustard to the soup. I also think it works well with Melba toast and mozzarella. Definately one to try!

I made this the other night using Vidalia onions. I doubled the onions and broth, kept the butter the same but added a couple of tbl. olive oil. Great recipe and flavour, onions took almost 1 1/2 to caremelize due to the amount. Froze most of the soup, am hoping it is as good reheated!

Got raves for this recipe . . . notable since it was my first ever French onion soup. Use smaller onions if you're doing 6, and I found myself adjusting to taste with maybe 5 tsps of mustard, as opposed to the recipe's one. As my littler guests said, "it's yummy in the tummy!".

Scrumptious! I make exactly as written but add 1/2 cup of brandy - gives it more depth of flavour. Makes a lot, so I usually freeze the remainder. So nice to have on hand for a quick supper.

My husband, not a huge fan of French Onion soup (once a year is enough for him) gave this recipe three forks. I used Gruyere, since that was what was in the frig, along with the Parmesean with excellent results.

I would recommend this dish for company as well as family.

This is a tasty soup but next time I would make changes. Needs more beef flavour so I would only use 2 cups chicken broth and 4 cups beef broth. Also, next time I think I'll try red wine as it seems this would complement the beef and onions better. Caramelizing the onions is key to this soup, so, be patient. I also spread baguette slices with olive oil, sprinkled with thyme, salt and pepper and toasted in 400 deg. oven for 10 minutes, then sprinkled on swiss and parmesan cheese and baked the slices alone for 10 minutes and then topped the soup with the slices. No need to put soup in bowls under broiler.
