This recipe needs spice added to it, otherwise it's TERRIBLE. I'm about to chuck my bundt cake result in the trash. I followed the recipe closely and I should've known better that it needed spices. Be warned--before you waste a whole bunch of ingredients.

Hmmm...the batter didn't even fill half the bundt pan, and after 40 min. the whole thing was way too baked. It smells burnt and looks like a brick. I went through all the effort to give this cake to a friend as a gift, but I think it will go in the trash. What did I do wrong? I followed the recipe to a tee.

I gave this a trial run last week because I need to prepare an egg-free cake for a special occasion. It passed with flying colors and I have high standards for cake! My husband declared it "Delicious!!" I did add an extra 1/2 cup of unmelted chocolate chips to the batter. I also noticed that I could taste the beets a bit while the cake was warm but not at all when it was chilled.

Wonderful and surprisingly good! Definitely buy more beets just to be on the safe side. Have made this 2x with fresh beets but will try to canned to see if it also works. I also added some chocolate chips to the batter to make it extra chocolaty.

Maybe I'm an exception, but I thought this was divine. I used two cans of drained, pureed beets, replaced the chocolate chips with 3TB oil, 9TB cocoa, reduced the sugar to a bit less than a cup, and made this as cupcakes, to save baking time. The result was wonderfully moist and dark, sort of earthy, and reminded me a bit of the result espresso powder gives when added to chocolate. I added a chocolate/coconut oil icing, which was more like milk chocolate, and a nice contrast, and my picky husband and adventurous toddler enjoyed these, too. Will definitely make these again.

Good for disguising veggies for toddlers, but I doubt it would fool any adult. This is "moist" in the same way those fat-free applesauce-laden cakes are -- kind of leaden and goopy at the same time. Definitely no crumb to speak of. Tastes okay if you close your eyes (& I *like* beets). The only change I made was to add a touch of cocoa powder as recommended by others, but overall, still pretty meh. I guess I should've lowered my expectations since it's vegan cake.

When I steamed 5 medium-small/medium beets, I ended up with only 1 cup puree so I halved the recipe. Also, halfway into making it I discovered I had run out of brown sugar so I substituted with white after reducing the amount. The color is incredible. When I tasted the batter, I was skeptical that it wasn't quite ..."there"... so when I poured the batter (I used cupcake tins) I buried a few chocolate chips in each cupcake. I also whipped up a buttercream icing for the cupcakes, destroying their vegan status but it went very well. The cake was very moist, tasted good, beautifully colored, and I could tell the brown sugar would really make it. I will make again, if only for the reaction when I tell people that these beautiful cakes were made from fresh garden beets.

How is this cake anything like a beet bundt cake when you leave out the beets and use applesauce instead? It is so funny how some people leave comments about a recipe that they have changed so much it is no longer close to the recipe posted.

im not fond of beets. but i did not want to waste them. This was perfect. Looks very rich, and what a beautiful color. Didn't rise very high but looked nice. I dusted it with a blend of powdered sugar and candy cane, which was a remarkable finishing touch.

exceptional way to get kids to eat beets. I had 3 extra 13 yo boys and I couldn't even sprinkle XXX sugar on before it was ssnarfed down. So the official name is red velvet cake, what i'll do when they eat real red velvet cake......I ussed fresh beets and addded 1 egg, 1/2 t vanilla and 1/4 C mini choc.chips. Very good,definate keeper.

This recipe proved to be a great solution to the abundance of beets I have received from my CSA. I am still trying to learn to like them and baking them into a cake is a brilliant idea! I also used an egg, like another reviewer, because I keep chickens and usually have a lot of eggs too. The cake was extremely moist and delicious. I used chioggia beets, which are milder in flavor. I think this helped tone down the beet flavor that some reviewers didn't like. Everyone loved this cake and I am definitely making it again!

Meh... I love beets and I've had plenty of tasty vegan deserts but this one is simply lackluster. The only change I made was adding 3T of coco powder and still chocolate was not the dominant flavor of this thing. Actually, all I can taste is canola oil with a slight hint of beets. Chocolate? Nope. So, my recommendations is to use Earth Balance (or, blasphemy, butter) instead of canola oil and double up on chocolate. Heck, triple it.

My family thought it was brownies! Because I have two picky toddlers and no one in my family will eat the 70 pounds of beets our CSA delivered, I did add the cocoa powder according to the reviewer below, almost entirely to disguise the color. My 3 yo has been begging for it ever since. This recipe will stay in the front of my recipe book for a long time.

This turned out SO well! And looks so beautiful - like a garnet. Moist and delicious. Only a very slight hint of beet. When I asked my friend to guess what the main ingredient was, he said, "chocolate!" I think I actually prefer this to zucchini cake. A few adjustments I made: I added a 1/4-1/2 cup of chocolate chunks, which worked well. I added one beaten egg since I'm not vegan, and that added a lovely extra lightness to the already fluffy cake. I made a glace for the top, out of a bit of the reserved beet liquid, a bit of oil (or butter if you prefer), leftover chocolate pieces, and powedered sugar. Came out very nicely. Also, I didn't have a bundt cake pan on hand so I used a spring-form, which worked well.

Eh. It tastes like beets...which I love...just not in a cake

I added a 1/2 c chocolate chips to the batter in an effort to better coax a couple unadventurous eaters. They sunk to the bottom :P Either way I liked the cake. You can taste the beets just a little every now and then, but if you didn't know they were there you wouldn't recognize the flavor. I referred to it as "purple chocolate chip cake" so my picky eaters wouldn't immediately turn their noses up. Great recipe! Next time I'll drop my modification of adding extra chocolate chips or use the mini chips.

FINALLY, a delicious solution for the problem of too many beets at harvest time! I added an extra 1/2 t. of vanilla, an extra 1/4 c. of chocolate chips, and 1 T. of cocoa powder to reduce the beety taste. To make a gluten free cake, I used Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free flour + 1t. xanthan gum. It was moist and delicious. I drizzled lemon icing over the top for extra tang. My husband guessed "Raspberry?" when asked. My 7-year-old boys asked for seconds. The true sign of a great recipe.

This cake was dark, moist and delicious. I used dark chocolate dairy chips and topped with butterscotch. Looking forward to eating it with vanilla ice cream.

I love beets, but I have to admit, this tasted a little weird to me at first. The flavor of the beets seemed too present and distracting the first couple of bites but I soon got over that and really got into the cake-ness of it. It was really moist and the flavors blended more smoothly once my pallet adjusted. Plus, I love the fact that I am getting so many nutrients while eating cake! I was excited by the idea of the whipped beet topping in theory but couldn't bring myself to do it once I'd sampled the cake. I didn't want to over accentuate the beet flavor. So instead I made a chocolate glaze to drizzle over and this brought it all together for me. I might try the whipped beet frosting for something else though. I will definitely make this cake again. Some of the guest that I served it to even requested the recipe. I was afraid my friends might think it was a bit too weird but it was a hit!
