If you make these right they will be better than any cracker. The trick is to use a quality, thin pita that has a consistent thickness. Bake them a bit lower than 375 if you are burning the Parmesan cheese. Been doing this for years and they are huge hit every year.

I don't understand a brain that registers a "weird kick" from parmesano and olive oil. But then again, this was the brain that got the bright idea to make it with raisins. This recipe is simple and is great with a variety of vegetable dips. Definitely a superior option to potato chips!

Such a waste of money to try this dish with good parmesan. You bake the crisps in the oven and the exceptional quality and taste of good parmesan instantly dissapears. I'm not even gonna try the crisps with a less expensive cheese. The thing didn't even turn out presentable.

These are so good. My 12yr. old son loves these to dip in hummus (his favorite snack). He likes when I add garlic and parsley to them. Also add chile powder and cheddar cheese. NACHO-LICIOUS

This is also great with some chopped herbs mixed into the olive oil. I used parsley, garlic, kosher salt and some fresh basil.

Hmmm. Raisins. Interesting combination. I've made these so many times. Just did again the other night. Those who had not had them before were wowed!! Reminded me to get my 2 cents in. So little effort for a superior product compared to potato chips.

Raisins...wow, that is weird. I've been making variations on this for years. A really good one is to skip the oil, mix the cheese with a bit of mayo and chopped green onions and bake til bubbly. YUM! (DON'T add raisins...LOL--can't get over that one)

To the Cook From San Francisco (below): How on earth could olive oil and Parmesan cheese produce a "weird kick??" And to counteract that, you added raisins? (I'm assuming that's the word you meant to use...) Wow, I'm speechless, really. BTW, this is a great do-ahead recipe that's totally versatile to boot. Try adding some freshly ground pepper for a little zest. No weird kick, I promise.

I've made these several times and they've always been a huge hit. I brought them for Easter dinner and people were asking where they could buy them. They are great with artichoke dip or the sun-dried tomato and pesto torte.

Super! My guests couldn't stop eating these. I baked them just 12 min at 350 and that worked well; I also sprinkled them lightly with freshly ground black pepper after the cheese. I also made some plain, with olive oil and salt only, at the same time, and actually I personally liked the plain more. All of them were nice and crispy just after baked--then I stored them in a large tupperware container and they stayed great and crispy for 4 days. They were very good for scooping up dips and didn't break, as I'd feared they might. Next time I'll try this with wheat pitas for variety, and I will definitely make these again for any party--they are far superior to store-bought crackers for very little effort.

I served this with a Seasme and Eggplant salsa (Dec. 99 Bon Appetit) For a cocktail party. They were very good for that purpose. I baked them a half hour before the party started and they were crispy and a nice change from the norm. Also very easy to make!

Terrific not only to serve with dips but great as a snack! Try adding garlic powder with the cheese for an added zip. I also found that it needed more oil. Delicious!!

This is a great alternative to plain pita or crackers. Be sure to keep an eye on them in the oven. They're perfect when lightly browned. Very crispy.

I made these crisps to accompany a garlic, chickpea and parsley dip and got rave reviews for both. (Mine weren't chewy either.) The Misto worked much better than brushing on oil. A good tip! Thanks.

These weren't chewy for me. They are absolutely delicious and I've gotten rave reviews. More olive oil was required since it was difficult to sparingly brush the pita. Maybe a Misto to mist it on would work better. Tip: The pita rounds are usually thicker on one side which requires more time in the oven. I found that keeping the thin and thick rounds on separate baking sheets eliminated inconsistent browning.

This recipe is o.k. Pita crips were a bit chewy on the day made and after that were quite hard.
