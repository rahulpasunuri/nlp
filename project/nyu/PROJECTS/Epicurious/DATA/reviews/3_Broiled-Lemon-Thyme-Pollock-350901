Delicious, quick, and much more flexible than it might first appear to be -- e.g. I often end up subbing fish sauce or sage in, and often add a dash of cayenne or a touch of minced garlic, all to delightful effect.

Wonderful! But I think it has everything to do with the quality of the fish. We used Trout. You have to be careful about contaminants and environmental damage with fish any more! From what I understand, Alaskan Pollock is both healthy and well-managed.

Meh. This is like cafeteria food from a recipe pulled off the back of a Kraft label. Looked tres unappetizing on my plate. I used low fat mayo which could have made the difference.

I'm not rating this because I didn't follow the recipe to a T. However, I don't think I deviated from it all that much and we liked it; I would make it again. I used trout instead of pollock because I already had trout on hand. Also, I grow lemon thyme in my garden so I used that in place of the thyme. Because it is lemon thyme, I just skipped the lemon zest and lemon juice. I imagine it still tasted very much similar to the original recipe. It did seem that some oil might have separated out or something and was left behind in the pan. Still, the topping got golden brown. For how quick and easy this was, with few ingredients I usually have on hand, were I to rate it I would say 3 stars. Nothing gourmet but easy and tasty and everyone in the hosue liked it.

The topping never crusted but it did brown. The dish wasn't "wow" enough to get me over the idea of having mayonnaise on top of my fish. It was fine, but not stellar.

Very tasty but the topping separated out the oil from the mayo leaving just a very thin layer of topping which never really became crunchy or crisp as the recipe intro suggests. Very fast to put together.

We live in Mexico in the winter where fresh fish is abundant. This recipe is quick and delicious! We even tried baking it in a hot oven (400 degrees) until fork tender, depending on the type of fish...yum!

I substituted turbot and absolutely loved it. The flavors came together beautifully and it really didn't taste like "mayonnaise". My 3 year old even ate it (I didn't tell her it had mayo on it). I ended up only broiling it for a few minutes because it looked like it was going to burn. Turned the oven to 350 and let it cook a little more. I will definitely be making this on a regular basis.

Made it with halibut, and it was delicious. Easy and fast to prepare.
