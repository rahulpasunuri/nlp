As written, I think the sauce is a bit tart and salty. It's not horrible, just not ...sublime... I have a problem with authority, so I used a bottle of zinfandel and regular (non-low sodium) broth. The reduction was quite tart, so I added a full cup of dried figs/cherries I had lying around, and stewed them in the broth. This was quite tasty. I finished it with a bunch of drippings and a bit extra butter, and it really was quite quite good. I had read a lot of reviews, and most were raves, but there was one woman who said, "sorry, people, but this sauce is too tart." I thought she was a sourpus, but in retrospect, I think that even with merlot, it would have been a little tart. I think it may be better with a port or something, and definitely use low sodium broth.

I have reviewed this recipe before but I am still amazed at this sauce whenever I make it. I reverse the quantities of the broths, 900ml carton beef and 1/2 carton chicken. I don't set aside 1/2 cup for later use, just increase the proportions of butter/flour and freeze whatever I don't use for another fantastic meal. Also I cook the filets 4 minutes per side for a perfect medium rare Bon Appetit! P.S. Try not to drink all the sauce before serving.

I bought a whole tenderloin and used the middle for the filet mignon. I substituted Smart Balance for the butter, used the onions I had, and forgot the thyme. Still delicious. Served with broccoli (that was steamed and then sauteed with olive oil and garlic and fresh squeezed lemon), and a spinach salad. Went with 5 ounces instead of 6. Wonderful meal.

Excellent. I used a $7 bottle of Merlot, and it was amazing. I cook my filets on a George Foreman grill, so I saved some of the liquid and poured it over the plates to "deglaze" them and capture the best of the drippings and then added to the sauce. Had no problems with the sauce being too thin.....I actually think I might have made it a little thicker than the recipe calls for. I also used salted butter since I'd forgotten to take the unsalted out to soften - no issues. Drizzled over the steaks and some garlic and white cheddar mashed potatoes and it was a huge hit....put a small dish of sauce by the man I cook for and he dipped every single bit in it. Will absolutely make again.

Not bad. My family enjoyed this recipe.

Rating: 4
Mmmmm...soooo good. I used an $11 bottle of a Penfold's Cabernet, which worked beautifully. Like one reviewer alluded to, I actually DID eat the rest of the sauce with a spoon. The meat took longer (almost twice as long) than 4 minutes per side, as they were thicker than an inch. I'm not usually a big beef lover, but this was heavenly.

Rating: 4
This was absolutely Fabulous! I made it as a test recipe for my husband and I last night. I looked at all the reviews and some people seemed to have a problem with the sauce, so I was skeptical. I took to heart the reviews that mentioned it was critical to use a good wine. I did not have a "good" Merlot st home, but did have a Sirah that was very good, so I used this instead. I also sauteed the Shallots, garlic and thyme with fresh button mushrooms and butter. Make sure you cook the filets in a good pan, it is critical to the sauce to get the drippings. I the filet's I used needed more time cooking in the pan as they were thicker, you may have to cut into one to check the progress. Mine took a tad over 18 minutes to cook to Medium Rare. The menu consisted of a Sirah Sauce over the Filet's, and Egg Noodles. The side dish I chose was baby green beans with bacon, shallots and mushrooms - seasoned with black pepper. It is one we have earmarked to make for company. It was excellent.

Made this sauce this weekend and it was delicious. Everyone found the sauce to compliment the meat perfectly. I will definately be making this again.

I just made this tonight, and my parents and I loved it. I used a locally made cabernet- sauvignon, and it worked to great effect. The sauce is rich, but not so much so that it is heavy and filling in the stomach. I ended up steam cooking some broccoli and string beans to serve with the sauce as well. Next time I think I'll add some potatoes to the mix, I think that would really balance out the dish.

I learned a long time ago tha the wine quality that you are using for recipes will affect the recipe. Do not purchase cooking wine or cheap wine when making a wine sauce. This will be noticeable on your sauce. Buy a nice wine that you would drink with any good meal. It does not need to be a really expensive wine, just a good wine that you like. You will be amazed with the results. Yes, the wine makes a difference!

I always check reviews before I try a new recipe. So I was very enthusiastic in trying this one out (simple, tasty) for special dinner guests. I followed the recipe to the "T", but what I got was an acidic tasting sauce. Needlass to say I was embarassed, thankfully the filet mignon was cooked to perfection, so at least that saved the day. My husband asked me never to make this sauce again ! I'm wondering if the type of merlot makes a difference: i.e. price, which country it comes from etc. Because the overwhelming majority has rated this recipe highly (and to redeem my cooking vanity!), I may just give it another go (sans guests as guinea pigs this time around), with another type of wine.

Rating: 4
This recipe is now the family favorite for birthdays and any time we cook steaks. I prefer to grill my steaks, so I sear one small piece to get some bits for the sauce. Also, I add about 1/2 TB balsamic vinegar to the shallots at the end of the saute cycle. It gives the sauce much more depth. My daughter requestes this sauce at every family occasion, and she just gave her first dinner party last week, with this sauce, and it was a hit.

This dish was delicious! Finally, a recipe that makes me feel like I prepared restaurant quality filet with a delicious sauce. This has become a favorite recipe. Make sure to use a good Merlot, one that you would drink on it's own, the quality will really boost the flavor.

Very good. Used ribeyes instead of filet mignon with excellent results. Substituted onion for the shallot. Used leftover wine (500mL Cab. Sauv and 250 mL Pinot Gris) in place of a bottle of merlot. It tasted absolutely divine, in spite of taking some cost-cutting measures.

Rating: 3
Really great, rich flavor. I also substituted a different wine (cabernet) and had great results; I'm sure you could use any red wine on hand that you'd want to drink. When making a partial recipe, though, the sauce needs much, much less time to reduce -- I didn't keep a close eye on my first batch, and it burnt right up.

Exceptionally good. I didn't have merlot so I substituted with a pinot noir. I found the sauce to be simply delicious and a nice compliment to the filet mignon. I will prepare this dish again.

This recipe deserves 5 stars! I have made this several times now and always for company! I have left a review before however I wanted to add that reducing the wine/broth the day before made it even MORE devine, if that is possible, also I always add sauteed mushrooms.. my company lastnight were literally wowed and thought It was better than restaurant quality. Best Filet EVER....I served with double stuffed potatoes with mushrooms and cheese (epicurious) and cobb salad (williams sanoma) Incredible.

Of the countless recipes I've made from this site, this might be my absolute favorite!

I made this dish today for Easter. I thought it turned out really well. My guests seemed to like it.

My guests ignored the butter and dipped the bread in the sauce. This dish is well accompanied with the Rosemary mashed potatoes and Asparagus amadine (both from Epicurious). Well done, Epicurious, for giving me a recipe that made an excellent piece of beef even better! This will be made time and time again!

Absolutely perfect dish, I've made it twice now. Roasted potatoes with Rosemary and Garlic are a perfect side dish for the meal. I'll warn those trying a wine sauce for the first time. If it smells horrible when the wine first begins to boil, open a window and give it a while to improve... I promise you, it WILL get better!

Rating: 4
This dish was fabulous...I also had problems with the sauce thickening (I let it cook down for about an hour until it was just over 2 cups and then pulled it aside as we weren't ready to eat). I also added sliced crimini mushrooms to the sauce when I sauteed the shallots and would definitely repeat this part. I served this meal with ciabatta and a spinach salad with chevre and an orange-juice/lemon vinaigrette. Very tasty and light enough not to compete with the merlot sauce. Next time I might make mashed potatos because the sauce was SO good, it would be one more thing to sop it all up.

Rating: 4
Anyone who thought this dish was horrible must be kidding!!! I have made this dish dozens of times and everyone just raves about it. I do add some sauteed mushrooms to the sauce just before serving it because my husband loves mushrooms. I like to serve it with really good french bread, garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed zucchini, yellow squash, turnips and carrots. YUM,YUM!!!

Simply excellent. What a great sauce if you want to have something else besides "gravy" or butter for your other sides. Distinct taste sets it apart and makes it memorable. I have made this three times and always serve a heavy green type veggie with it. I have mashed potatos with this as well. Sauce and potatos go extremely well together. I noticed one cook who said this was an "embarassment." Definetely made some mistakes. I have noticed 50 or more reviews on this dish and 99% of them have 4 forks. I suspect that the majority is correct. I loved this dish and so has everyone who has tried it.

Wonderful sauce. I was practically eating it with a spoon! I did use low sodium broth. The flavors of the sauce take the filet to a whole new level. Yum! Too bad the last reviewer found it too salty and "wine-y"-- perhaps they did not reduce the wine and broth enough? My reduction took more than an hour-- other reviewers mentioned 45 minutes. My sauce did not taste overwhelmingly of wine at all. I think each individual cook will have to watch the reduction as it cooks down to get it right. I will definitely make this for company. Excellent!

Valentine's Day, 2004: I went online to find a filet, having never made one in my entire 50 years. This was the first one listed, and any recipe that requires a bottle of wine is good by us! I made it for my sweetheart and it was so good, we were eating the sauce out of the pan before the meal was even made! It was devoured within minutes and when I asked her when she'd like this made again, she replied, "How about Monday? We could celebrate it 'being' Monday?!" I'd make this again in an instant. Watch the sauces cooking time, however, as it went from 5 cups to 1 in a blink of the eye!

I followed the recipe exactly for the sauce. Patience paid off-it was incredible! The key difference for me is always the filet. 2 inches thick, trimmed, pounded and tied around outside to create a tight,even circle. Generous pepper,sprinkle of celery salt and seer in 1 TBS each butter and oil for just 30 seconds each side. Put in 500 degree oven for 15-20 minutes (rare,med rare).

This recipe is fantastic. I have made it twice, and the second time was even better than the first when I followed another reviewer's suggestions and added 1/8 c. of sugar to the wine mixture while it was boiling down to take out some of the tartness.

Excellent recipe. The tart/sweet of the merlot sauce blended very well with the mellow beef flavor. The alterations I'd make are: Add the butter and flour to the pan before adding the reduction. Mix butter and flour and cook for 30 seconds (make a roux). Then, add the reduction. Strain the sauce before serving to get rid of the chunks of shallots and garlic.

Quite delicious. At first, before marrying the sauce with the spectacular and expensive filets, it seemed a tad bitter, but when the two came together, all was well. Very nice flavour. I did use low-salt broth; this is obviously necessary. Also, because i wanted to grill the filets, I purchased a pound of short ribs to brown in a sauté pan, in order to provide the brown "bits" on the bottom of the pan. Then I continued with the sauce as the instructions state, but I simmered the short ribs in the sauce for about an hour and a half. This provided the benefit of a second tasty meal. This is a dynamic recipe. Try it. You'll like it, if you like robust food.

We made this for Christmas Eve dinner and would definitely make it again. Cooking six tenderloins on the stove during the salad course was a bit hectic, but the pan drippings are a must for the sauce. We used all two cups of the sauce and added sauteed mushrooms which added to the flavor and presentation. Very impressive. Got two more filets the next day so we could use up the sauce -- too good to throw away!

I fixed this on Christmas Eve for my husband, daughter and in-laws. Everyone raved! My husband, who does not usually care for sauces, absolutely loved this sauce. When we were half way through, they took a vote and requested the same menu for next year! Along with the filet mignon, I fixed twice-baked horseradish potatoes, a simple green bean casserole and crusty french bread. Today when we were shopping, my husband asked if I could fix "that sauce" again. I'll most definitely be fixing this one again soon.

I had a dinner party and served this, unfortunatly they were not the gourmet types. No one liked this except me, and no one would even TRY this sauce. However, I thought it was GREAT.

I made it for the two of us, but used the amounts of sauce for four people, and I'm so glad! We ate a whole baguette between us just to soak up the rest of the sauce.

This is one of my favorite filet recipes. We usual grill the steaks, but we ran out of propane and found that the sauce actually tasted a little bit better when made in the pan that the steaks were cooked in. Must have been the steak juices and browned bits. Either way - a winner.

I made this for my parent's 30th Anniversary for 40 people. I thought it would be difficult, but turned out great, the key is to really reduce the wine. I also made this with twice baked potatoes and asparagus...yummy. I reduced the sauce the night before and instead of searing the filet, barbequed it. Finished the sauce when the filets were on grill to keep it bubbly, sauce should be gravy like, will definately make again.

I made this for a fancy Father's Day dinner and it was excellent! Great food for a romantic dinner or celebration. I made the merlot and broth mixture the night before and then the rest of it when I was doing the steaks. Definitely stick to low-sodium because it is just enough salt;anymore would be too much. I also simmered my sauce for 30-40 minutes after bringing it to a final boil to get the syrup-like consistancy. The thicker the better. Which worked because it took 30 minutes to grill the steaks just right (as opposed to searing them). Next time I will do all of the sauce the night before in order to get it thicker. Excellent taste!

A local gourmet restaurant makes this exact dish topped with a bit of crumbed Gorgonzola cheese and a side of Fetticine Alfredo. Of the dozens of plates on his menu (including many gourmet veal and seafood dishes), I would estimate that 75-80% of the patrons who come in order this dish over anything else. This Filet is absolutely incredible if prepared correctly.

I'm with all of you. This recipie is fantastic! I've made this three times now in the past 2 months (it's becoming an expensive habit!)and my husband is always delighted when I prepare this. Depending on how well done you like your filet, it can take considerably longer to cook it. Personally I like mine done medium and I cooked each side 10-12 minutes in my grandmothers very old (1920's) cast iron dutch oven on the stove. This pan was perfect! Be sure to cook the merlot sauce a long time. It is heavenly. The last time I made this I added fresh sliced brown mushrooms during the last 10 minutes of cook time. YUM!! I also served quartered red roasted potatoes with minced garlic and crushed rosemary and brioche rolls with the filet. Are you hungry now?

Good dish! The onion garnishes were unique -- my guests liked them, but I'm not sure they were worth the trouble. The potatoes are a new and wonderfully simple way to create a lovely presentation. Be sure not to undercook the sauce. i think next time I will forego the onions and serve a different veggie.

OH MY GOODNESS!!!! This recipe is fabulous! I have been reading the reviews for about 2 months, and finally decided to make it tonight for just my husband and myself. He was sopping up the sauce with bread. I can honestly say this was one of the BEST sauces I have ever tasted. A definate keeper!

Made this for New Year's Eve dinner for myself and my boyfriend. Couldn't find or afford filet mignon, so we used a pair of ribeye steaks. It was heavenly! The sauce was absolutely fabulous -- I could have eaten it by itself! And to think I only used a $8 bottle of Merlot...

After all the rave reviews, I was prepared to love this recipe---especially because we've been to Henrietta's Table and found it to be a delightful restaurant. So we were rather disappointed in the end result. Made the recipe exactly as stated (except we grilled the filets, so we missed out on the brown bits from the meat). It was good---but not great, and I wouldn't go to the trouble of making this sauce again. Have another red wine sauce favorite that is far easier and less costly.

According to my husband, the only thing wrong with this was that we couldn't have it again for dessert. I used a very good Merlot but will try higher quality broths next time. And there will definitely be a next time!

was satisfied with the sause and didnt find the saltiness too overt; however, my husband (who did the marketing for the meal) said the filets, "didn't look good" so he got sirloin instead, and they turned out to be tough so i was a bit dissapointed after the length of time it took to make the sauce.

This is by far the "strangest" recipe I've tried off of Epicurious. For the record, I used a relatively inexpensive Merlot (Corbett Canyon) because another reviewer had said they used the same brand with no problems. I don't know if I should have used a different brand of Merlot, because when I first tasted the finished sauce, it was quite tart! Then again, I'm no wine connoisseur, so I don't know if Merlot is supposed to be tart to begin with. I guess it just wasn't a taste I was expecting. Also, because nearly all the other reviewers warned about this recipe's saltiness, I used low-sodium chicken and beef broths (even though the recipe only calls for low-sodium chicken broth), and found that I had to ADD salt to the sauce to make it offset the tartness! Anyways, I served the sauce to my guests, and they actually seemed to enjoy it. Sure enough, when I paired the sauce with the filet mignon, it did taste better (with a few added shakes of salt), but not quite the ecstasy I was hoping for. Oh well, at least my guests told me they enjoyed it, and the meal didn't turn out to be a complete disaster!

Scrumptious! I did broil my filets instead of pan frying and it worked well. I did add a bit of unsalted butter and a few tablespoons of cream at the end of the sauce. It really added a nice flavor and cut a bit of the saltiness. Definately a must make dish!

I've never had luck making gravies/sauces, but that wasn't the case with this recipie! I made it for my husband's birthday, and he raved! He can't wait for me to make it again! I just cooked the filets a bit longer to get them closer to medium well! Yummy!

Way too salty...even when using low/no salt broths. And, watch the sauce while it reduces. I checked the pot after about 45 minutes and it had boiled down to nothing. Had to add more wine. Overall, without the salt it would be very good.

Excellent! I have made this recipe for company served with garlic mashed potatos and a ceasar salad I don't know how many times and it never fails to get rave reviews. The sauce can be made a day ahead except for adding the butter at the end as can the potatoes which leaves more time to visit with your company. I also use a filet roast and slice it and serve it with the sauce on top of the slices. This also saves time. This recipe is a definate keeper!

I made this for a dinner party, and it was a great hit! It was just perfect, not too salty since I had followed others' advice. I served it with red potatoes and parsley, asparagus, and Ceasar salad.

My favorite recipe to really impress guests. I always add thin slices of gorgonzola cheese on top of the steak immediatly after grilling then pour the sauce over the cheese and top it off with sauteed mushrooms...It is out of this world decadent!

I don't think I have ever given out a recipe as much as this one to our dinner guests who always ask for it. Be sure to print extra copies!

I couldn't get low-sodium broths so as I was boiling the wine mixture I threw in a potato for about 20-25 min to try and soak up some of the salt. It was delicious.

I guess I'm just wondering why I wasn't in love with this recipe. I must admit I have a great Madeira sauce and peppercorn sauce which I have used for years and they always get rave reviews.

I have made this recipe a couple of times and, I must say, it's one of my favorites. The taste of the merlot sauce is outstanding!! After boiling the sauce for one hour, I reduced the sauce to 3 cups...just enough for two filet mingnon dinners.

I served this meal on New Years Eve to a finicky group of 10, self-described "meat & potatoes Irish Bostonians" - they loved it!

I prepared this dish especially for my husband. We are both meat lovers but I wanted him to try something different.

I followed directions, didn't change anything, as one must do when trying a recipe for the first time. cooked the fillets in a cast iron, a little longer than recomended only because my family likes everything almost well-done, but otherwise, it was great.

Made this for a progressive dinner for New Year's Eve and the guests raved. Next time I might strain the shallots and garlic out for a more elegant presentation. I made the reduction the day before, prepared the aromatics and butter/flour paste in the afternoon, then merely returned home 10 minutes before the rest of the diners to saute the filets. Easy and delicious, my only question is--did anyone else think that it made a LOT of sauce--as in I could have easily made 8 or even 10 filets and had ample sauce for all?

I made this for a dinner party and only got so-so reviews (I even used a low sodium broth from the start). I thought that I had done something wrong because everyone else on this website has given it such rave reviews that I decided to try it again. Although everyone was impressed, once again, by the presentation at my next dinner party they were not overly impressed by the merlot sauce (as neither were my wife or I) as the saltiness of the sauce seemed to over-power the delicate texture of the filets. However other then a simple bernaise sauce to compliment a filet mignon, via the members of epicurious, it seems that this merlot sauce is the next best concoction since sliced bread and so I am convinced that I am doing something wrong and am determined to one day get it right. Good luck to anyone trying this for the first or even second time and I envy and would like to congratulate everybody who was has already experienced bliss with this recipe. Happy New Year!

This is a wonderful recipe. We had it for Christmas dinner and everyone was so impressed. I did not use lo-salt broth in the Merlot sauce and I wished that I had. It was just a little to salty but no one else mentioned it. We sliced about a pound of whole mushroom, sauted' them in butter and garlic then poured the remainder of Merlot sauce over them. When we were ready to serve, we drained the mushrooms. We sauted' the steaks and they were perfect.

I made this for dinner on Christmas day and, as I poured an entire bottle of my favorite Merlot into the saucepan, I thought: this had better be good. It was. Everyone loved it.

After reading the many reviews for this recipe, I knew I had to try it! Unfortunately, I did not have low salt broth so I found it a little salty. I thought this might be the case so I did not put salt on the steaks themselves. The sauce was very tasty however and with a lower sodium broth, I'm sure it would be fantastic. Next time I make this, I will grill the steaks instead of sauting them. I will also try the wild mushroom suggestion as the last person did. Bon Apetit from Toronto!

Very easy and elegant. After cooking the filets, I added another tablespoon of oil and sauteed 4 oz of wild mushrooms for a minute and put them on a plate. I made the sauce and added the mushrooms to the sauce after adding the roux.

The Merlot sauce was unbelievable. I had had many restaurant filets in my day and no other sauce compares!

This was a wonderful recipe that allowed for the natural, heavenly flavor of the filet mignon to be enhanced by the Merlot sauce. I would and will make this recipe again!!!

Wonderful! Really wowed my guests, and it was so easy to make! I agree, use low salt broths, or (as I did), use your own. The idea about gorgonzola on top sounds like heady decadence, will definitely try that next time. This is a real keeper! Every time I make it, someone asks for the recipe!

I made this wonderful steak last night for dinner and it's certainly like dining in a 5 star restaurant - excellent! My husband prefers a steak alone without sauce but loves this one! Can't wait to make it for guests because it's a hit! Will always be one of my favorites!

My husband made the sauce. It was out of this world!! I'm glad to see that it works with pork and also we are going to try the portabellas with gorgonzola!!!

Excellent. melted a small amount of gorgonzola on top, as suggested by another reviewer, and served with portabella mushrooms.

The sauce was delicious! I served it with mashed potatoes & leeks. I followed the low-salt instructions and didn't find the sauce to be too salty.

this was great!! Have lots of bread on hand. Definitely one of my company dishes.

Another Winner! Hubby, two daughters (20 months & 3yr old) and myself loved this one. Make sure to have enough bread to soak up the delicious sauce!!! Rice was our (perfect) side dish. I love the "constant comment" recipes, it really motivates me to try new dishes weekly (well. ...Emeril motivates me too!)

Outstanding! My children loved it. It was very salty but I still would make it again. I used a tenderloin roast, not steaks. My son used the left over sauce for hot roast beef sandwiches on toast.

Oh this takes red meat to a whole new plateau. The sauce is borderline salty, but I compensated by under-seasoning the side dish (potato and spinach galette) so the meal was just right. I used canned broths, next time I'll use home made. An observation, I did the reduction the day before, using a young full-bodied Merlot, and when I took it out of the fridge the next day, there was a LOT of sediment.

Delicious! This is a terrific recipe for a special dinner. The sauce is out of this world (be sure to follow the salt-free instructions, otherwise it is too salty). I also found that using the filet makes a tremendous difference, a lesser cut of meat just doesn't do the sauce justice. Because I wanted to prepare the meal a little ahead of time, I simply placed the sauteed meat in a glass serving dish with the sauce, covered, and put it in the oven on warm for an hour.

Absolutely wonderful! I read the reviews prior to making this dish, so I had a concern about the salt, and used low sodium broth. I'm glad I did. I condensed the sauce first, then cooked a small pork shoulder roast with about 1/3 cup of the sauce in a cooking bag. After the roast was done I used a baster to remove the drippings from the bag, leaving the fat. I cooked the drippings down for about 5 minutes then added the sauce, heated through, then thickened. Oh My Word!! This is one of those hearty, full-flavored, yummy dishes. I served baked potatoes and used the sauce as a dressing. My husband raved.

very tasty sauce. the only change i made was i reduced the mixture to 1 1/2 cups instead of the suggested 2 cups. turned out great. serve with homemade french bread(perfect for dunking). will definitely make this sauce again. and i'm going to try it with other beef dishes besides steak.

Excellent

This merlot sauce is fantastic. I will definately make this dish again. I did notice when boiling/reducing the sauce a dark syrupy film developed on the side of my pot. I lowered the heat which seemed to help and also strained it when I finished reducing. I'm not sure if I was boiling at too high a heat or if it was the merlot. Neverless the resulting sauce was great!

I enjoyed the filet mignon. It was so tender, but I too had a problem with the sauce being too salty. I used a Lindeman's Merlot, and halved the recipe on all sauce ingredients. Any suggestions?

Rating: 4
Fabulous recipe! I've never made a steak in my life, but this was incredibly easy and one of the best recipes I've ever tried. I used a cheap Merlot (Corbett Canyon) and canned broth and it tasted great. Served with garlic smashed potatoes and brussell sprouts. Wow! This is my new company recipe.

Rating: 4
This recipe was wonderful! I added a little bit more herbs as well as some pepper to the sauce which made less salty. I also used a great Merlot and reduced it longer than the recipe suggested. I'm looking forward to trying this sauce with game meats. I made this dish with Herb Oven Roasted Tomatoes and some steamed asparagus.

I thought this recipe was fantastic! My husband raved about it. I used 1 can of low sodium chicken broth, instead of 2, and I used a little more than half of a bottle of Merlot. It came out perfect.

I used Fetzer merlot and found the taste to be tart and almost salty. Not worth the hassle of reducing it down. Having leftover sauce, nobody opted for it, they all wanted commercial steak sauce (Bulls-Eye). It tasted OK but I've had better.

Rating: 3
Help! My sauce was way too salty (and I LIKE salty), despite using low sodium chicken broth - in fact, the salt overwhelmed all the other flavors. I need to try this again because of all the great reviews and I would appreciate any feedback on where i may have gone wrong. I used Chianti instead of Merlot - would that make a difference?

This gourmet entree was delicious! The rich sauce had a divine flavor and went well with garlic mashed potatoes! I would definitely make this again!

this was really great, it was a race to the kitchen to see who would get to lick the pan with a piece of bread! could not justify using a $10.00 btl. of merlot so used Gallo hearty burgundy ( our everyday red) ( don't knock it if you haven"t tried it) This recipe makes more than enough for 6 , more like 9 or 10 . I cut in in 1/4's and stillhad plenty unless you think sauce is gravy

Isn't merlot wonderful? Try adding a tablespoon of gorgonzola on top of each suacced steak. Surprise!! Nice, eh?!

Rating: 4
Absolutely, a phenomenal wine sauce. Cut the amount of wine & stock in 1/2 for 2 people ??? You've got to be kidding. It's too good. And it just begs to soak into the center of a baked potato or be mopped up in some French or Italian bread. Instead of a filet, we used 2 really good rib-eyes. 4 minutes per side on the stove was not enough. We finished on the grill, while the sauce was finishing, and it worked just fine. Steamed some asparagus (no parmesan). Great meal, and can't want to prepare for our friends.

I too was impressed by the number of rave reviews. The sauce really is superb, relatively healthful, and great on mashed potatoes, and any good steak (not just filets). Also I used all the wine mixture (what would I do with the rest?) and it worked fine.

I have never read so many raving reviews, so I had to try this one. It is true, this dish is delicious. The sauce goes perfectly with garlic mashed potatoes and plenty of croissants to soak up the good flavor. This is simple to prepare and will surely impress your next guests.

A+!!! I had even reduced the sauce too much - it was a little too thick, but it was still wonderful!

I took the advise of two others when making the sauce: substituted Chianti for Merlot, and cut the recipe in half (was only cooking for 2). Served over bow pasta .... really good!

I make this about once a week. It is easy and tastes great! I substitute rump steak cut 1 1/2" thick, and tend to use more stock then wine, and more garlic and shallots. This is a must try.

Fabooo!!! The sauce is divine ( see everyone elses review) And I prepared this for my parents anniversary, served it with spinach gorgonzola gnocchi, A nice lite salad, and a divine little pomegranite dish for desert... They loved it..So did I. I used the leftover sauce with some herbed garlic mashed and had friends begging for the recipe.. Also found that a nice Chianti works very well instead of a merlot.

I took Steve's advice (below-ha!) and served this recipe w/garlic mashed potatoes and parmesan asparagus. The sauce was DEVINE and when it ran from the steak to the potatoes-that was even better! Guests loved it. I could eat the sauce all by itself!

An excellent way to impress dinner guests. I find that using the whole bottle of wine and broth to be wasted perhaps cut it in half. I serve with garlic mash potatoes and asparagus.
