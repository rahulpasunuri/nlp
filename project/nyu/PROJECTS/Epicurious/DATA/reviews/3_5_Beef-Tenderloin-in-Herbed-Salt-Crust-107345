Never made beef tenderloin before, and this one's a keeper. Absolutely wonderful Christmas Eve main course!

Easy to prepare and very good. I served this with pesto penne and fresh tomatoes.

Those who say the meat comes out juicy and tender are right. An easy suggestion for removing excess salt: rinse the cooked tenderloin briefly in running water! Pat it dry, and you are good to go.

This was the hit of our Christmas Eve get-together. I believe the recipe fails to recommend roasting this on a rack. Others commented that it is too salty and it would have been if roasted in the bottom of a pan surrounded by salt crust

I made this for Christmas, and it was very good. Some bites were still a bit salty, but everyone enjoyed it. But if I were to have another tenderloin roast, I would choose a different way to prepare it.

I was skeptical about the salted crust on this wonderful and expensive cut of beef, but it turned out absolutely wonderful and so tender, one did not need a fork to cut it! I am making this for Christmas Eve.

The name is not lying...it is very salty.

This is one of the easiest, best-tasting recipes I have ever tried. The meat turns our incredibly juicy and flavorful. I didn't find it too salty nor was the crust difficult to remove. In fact, I've made this twice and each time the salt crust split during cooking and was easily removed afterward.

We served this at a family event and everyone commented that it was wonderful. Based on other reviews, I was careful to scrape as much salt crust of as I could and nobody had a salty bite.

My family loves this. It is very easy to make and you can vary the spices, too.

I have made this twice because the meat tasted wonderful the first time but it was too salty - the second time I added more water to the salt to make it more like a paste. This made it a crust around the meat that came off easily. There was still salt on the meat, but much less than the first time.

The beef was definitely juicy, but it's difficult to get all the salt off. This results in some very salty bites...unfortunate. Tenderloin can lack flavor --not the case with this preparation. Just be careful to scrape as much salt off as you possibly can!

Absolutely incredible. The meat was so succulent and melted in our mouths. VERY easy to prepare.
