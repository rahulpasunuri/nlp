I made this for Thanksgiving. It was a lot for our family of four, so I separated it into two baking dishes and froze one for a few days until I took it to work for a potluck. Everyone enjoyed it. It was delicious!

Decided to try this instead of making my usual Thanksgiving stuffing recipe, and I loved it! Absolutely the best stuffing I've made. Toasting the bread is a great tip. I made a few changes for personal Thanksgiving preferences, which were to add pecans for crunch, cranberries instead of raisins and throwing in some chopped rosemary. Delicious!

the flavor was great but I made a mistake, followed another's advice and "cooked it in the crockpot" came out mooshy. I will have to try it again in the oven next time. So much for short cuts on Thanksgiving.

I used regular sourdough in a loaf and not the arisanal bread it calls for, all three nearby stores were out. So I used the crust from the loafs. I made this for a kosher meat meal and substituted pork sausage with chicken sausage and the butter with Earth's Balance. Very simple to make and tastes wonderful. Make sure your bowl is large enough to mix without spilling bits of bread over the rim.

Loved this! My son has never been a stuffing fan requested this for thanksgiving. Definitely will make again.

I halved the recipe and cooked it in the crockpot for 4-5 hours on high while the turkey cooked. Needed a bit more broth toward the end, delicious!

Delicious, easy to make and perfect for Thanksgiving. My husband made this and forgot the raisins, but it was still great. I'd add fresh cranberries to offset the sweet of the apples and to add color, dried cranberries would also work but would add another sugar which isn't needed with the wonderful sweet apples. We used two round sourdough loaves so upped the recipe a bit, just estimated measurements for apples, celery and bread - it was great and made two 13x9 pans. We'll definitely make this again, and again.

I loved this stuffing. I made it with the cranberry sourdough from Cobs bread, which was fantastic. I cooked the stuffing inside a turkey so I omitted the chicken stock. All my friends requested the recipe and there was sadly no stuffing left by the end of the night

This stuffing is exceptional, even if I DID mess up and use my artisanal sourdough for the french toast I made for Christmas morning and had to use regular french bread in the dressing. I can't wait to make it again and see how it turns out with sourdough bread.

A HUGE crowd pleaser. My family has required I make this every year from now on... did not add raisins (due to a majority food preference) and made a sage brown butter at the end before mixing in broth and eggs. Wonderful!

Didn't have the sage flavor that says stuffing to me so when I make it again I'll add a lot more raisins and sage -- both got lost in the finished dsh. And with our smaller group for Thanksgiving we've got a ridiculous amount of leftovers so next time I'll halve the recipe. I'd never put sausage in stuffing before and liked it.

I made this stuffing last year and again this year--it tastes like Thanksgiving to me. I made a note in my copy of the magazine to maybe add nuts (pecans?) next year for some more crunch. The apples, sausage and raisins go so well together-delicious!

yummy recipe. I omitted eggs (and added a little extra broth) due to an egg allergy but it still cameout great. Love the apples and raisins.

Just made this for our annual 'Friendsgiving' It was a huuuuge it! I just finished off the last of the leftovers... I used chicken breakfast sausage bc we had a non-pork eater in the crowd, and I did 1/2 cup dried cranberries, 1/4 cup raisins. It all went together very nicely.

Yes. 1 (one) 1 1/2 loaf. Not 11 (eleven). Read the recipe.

Please tell me that there is a typo and this recipe doesn't really call for eleven and a half pounds of sourdough bread! I am hoping it meant to say one and a half?

Love this recipe! Instead of golden raisins, I use chopped dried apricots.

I substituted turkey sausage but the flavor was still great. The stuffing had great flavor and was a crowd pleaser.

This is the first stuffing I've ever really liked--maybe because I made it myself and other people's stuffing can have creepy ingredients. Make it a day ahead because it does take a bit of time, then do the broth and egg bit just before you're ready to bake it. It's very good!

I made this for a family gathering yesterday. It won rave reviews from the men at the table. It is a nice blend of flavors though a little time consuming. People liked the sausage; unexpected and really good. I'd consider making it as a stand alone dish. I'm sending the link to the recipe on to family members.

My husband loved it. I liked it. Very nice, but, somehow, sausage seems a bit heavy if you're making it will all of the trimmings for Thanksgiving. Nice blend of flavors, though.

This recipe is very much like the stuffing I make, but I put in lots of celery and onion, sauteed in the sausage drippings. And being a good Southern gal, I substitute about half the bread with dried out (crispy) cornbread.

I made this stuffing for the first time for Thanksgiving dinner last weekend. It was a great success - easy to make thought took a bit of time. This will be my new go to stuffing.
