Used the marinade with wild salmon steaks on the grill. Yum! Next time I might be a little more liberal with the fresh dill.

I'm just beginning to cook and this recipe turned out great and was really easy. I'm really health conscious and this was perfect. I added some lemon zest to the marinade and marinated the salmon a little earlier than the veggies.

This recipe was cooked for a new friend that says today was one of the reasons she fell in love with me. Give it a shot with your best friend. Frank

Delicious. I added some lemon to the marinade and extended the marinade time. Delicious.

OK not great - there are so many BETTER grilled salmon recipes - this was somewhat mediocre. I did add mushrooms which we LOVED - the tomatoes were tasty - the zucchini was just ok - the salmon itself was nice - if I ever do make it again, I will probably use the recipe to marinate salmon steaks and grill whole as "steaks" instead of kebabs and serve with grilled vegies on the side.

This recipe worked very well with the addition of half a lemon's worth of juice. I also used cubed tuna rather than salmon, since it seemed fresher that day...

I am not a great cook and I have made this recipe several times and it always turns out delicious (it's so EASY yet tastes like I slaved over it). I've made it for a couple summer bbq's and people go nuts over it. (The first time I made it my husband told all HIS friends about it for weeks. )I subsitute different vegatables depending upon what is in season and fresh. Great with yellow squash, zucchini, mushrooms and grape tomatoes (wonderful colors). Once I added the extra vegatables, I have found the recipe to make quite a bit more than for two people. It's a staple in our family!

The salmon in this recipe was just okay. After reading the reviews I was expecting a perennial favorite, but with so many great ways to make salmon, this recipe just doesn't cut it will get deleted from my recipe box.

I made the salmon part of this recipe as part of a 'surf and turf' menu. Easy to make and the flavor is great. As always, I used extra garlic.

Made this last night and it was simple, elegant and delicious. We had 4 people for dinner -- but no need to double the marinade recipe, just use a Ziploc bag to make sure it's all coated. I also let it marinade for about 2 hours (not by design) and it was perfect. Best salmon in 2 years. We are lucky enough to live in Seattle and dropped by Pike Place Market (the flying fish store) for great salmon steaks. The steaks cubed well and held together well over the grill.

This was a hit at our party. I'll definitely make it again and again.

Very good recipe -- I took the previous reviewer's suggestion and added mushrooms. Delicious!!

The veggies tasted better than the tuna. Good idea, but maybe a lighter fish wold be worth a try. We added mushrooms, with great results! We didn't have skewers, so we placed the mixture over a double layer of foil with holes punched in it. I think this may be better since it helps keep the sauce on the food instead of on the flames.

I am making this again less than 1 week from the first time I made it. It is very good, and my dill is wonderful with it.
