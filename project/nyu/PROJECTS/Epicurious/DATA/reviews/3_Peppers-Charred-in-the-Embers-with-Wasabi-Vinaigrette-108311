Only made the vinaigrette for a grilled salmon on brown rice dish. I topped the brown rice with grilled salmon, followed with sliced radishes and avocado, then finally a scatter of minced scallions, nori seaweed strips, and toasted sesame seeds. For the vinaigrette I used equal amounts of sesame, and canola oil, and substituted half of the water with soy sauce. Also adjusted wasabi to personal taste. Excellent dinner on a warm coastal night. Elevated to 4 forks after adjustments.

I agree with the cook from Canada. The peppers by themselves are fabulous....the dressing by itself is fabulous.....but together the taste is just bizarre, something that is not at all attributable to using rancid sesame oil! It's just plain weird to top a smoky, grilled veggie with a very Asian-tasting dressing. That said, it was really fun to char the peppers. I cooked them on the embers in my wood stove, and I would do it that way again....I just wouldn't serve them with the Asian dressing.

This was delicious! I roasted the peppers over my gas burner because we were in the midst of an ice storm, and had to sub a little finely chopped sweet onion for the green onion, but loved the vinagrette. Served it with soy ginger salmon & steamed sugar snap peas.

I would hate to sound presumptous to the cook below, but a potential problem could have been the seasame oil. It goes rancid extremely quickly, which is why it is sold in such small bottles. One I crack the seal on a new bottle, I figure I have a month or less to use the whole thing or I pitch it. I thought the recipe was good as it was, without the seasame flavor being overpowering.

Gee, can't understand why this recipe was given such a high rating. Honestly, I found the flavour combinations just plain old bizarre! The vinaigrette itself is quite pleasant, and the peppers fab (how could anyone want to eat peppers any other way than roasted?)but together they were just...icky. The bitter/intensely sesame wasabi/sesame vinaigrette clashed terribly with the sweet/smokey peppers. Perhaps I should have used a more mild sesame oil? Who know? My advice - dunk a bit of pepper in the vinaigrette before you desecrate them with it.

nice flavor! i just roasted peppers in oven, put in bag to steam, and peeled. i put a little less than 2 tsp. wasabi paste and felt it was enough.

EXCELLENT. I didn't char the peppers in the grill - I cut them in half, seeded them and put them under the oven broiler until charred. I grow a wide variety of peppers and this is the best recipe I've found yet. I also added about 1/2 teaspoon sugar to the dressing (I can't make any recipe the way its originally written.)

This dish is really fabulous. I made it one night for my in-laws and they requested it again the next time I saw them. I must admit that I just threw the peppers on the grill -- didn't really bother sticking them 'in the embers'. The dressing is awesome -- watch out for the wasabi. Yum.
