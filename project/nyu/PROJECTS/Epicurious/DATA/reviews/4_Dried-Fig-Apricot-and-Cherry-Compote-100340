Four Forks for my version: Used Grand Marnier instead of brandy. No ginger. Took fruit out, then boiled down to about 1 cup of syrup. and ladled syrup back over fruit. Next day at a brunch, served room temperature with greek yogurt sweetened with honey. Fabulous winter alternative to fresh fruit and went excellently with champagne.

This is great and easy. I also added a handful of mission figs along w/the Calimyrnas. Cut Calimyrnas in quarters--half is too big. I used about 1/4 C. apricot brandy and 1/2 C. cognac.

Very easy and incredibly tasty. Next time I will cook the fruit a tad longer, they were still a bit firmer than I'd like. The Brandy gave this dish a wonderful flavor. I also added a slight bit of cornstarch which helped the sauce obtain a more syrupy consistency. I will also experiement with other spices, the cinnamon was very good but I think maybe a bit of vanilla and a star anise as another reviewer suggested would give it a real depth of flavor.

Help. My idea of a compote is something thick, this seems to have a lot of liquid, will it get thicker when it cools? It smells and tastes delicious, should I thicken it with cornstarch?

Love this compote. I used orange juice and just a splash of brandy and it was delicious. You could probably omit the brandy altogether if you needed to. I served this over the Italian rice pudding cake on this site and it was a perfect dessert moment.

A wonderful compote! Goes wonderfully with the gingerbread and looks beautiful.

This is a beautiful as well as delicious accompaniment to the ginger cake or anything else. It would be delicious with ice cream, pound cake, or even with a brunch menu. I am thinking that when Passover comes around I should make this to go with a Passover sponge cake. Served in a cut glass bowl it looks gorgeous.
