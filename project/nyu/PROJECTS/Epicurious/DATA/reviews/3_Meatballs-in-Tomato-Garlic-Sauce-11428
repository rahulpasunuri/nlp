I was not impressed with this. It seemed like a lot of work for a recipe that wasn't anything special. I think purchasing meatballs and a jar of spaghetti sauce might be a more interesting and flavorful alternative to this messipe.

Since the reviews of the meatballs themselves were lukewarm, I just used frozen meatballs. I tried turkey meatballs, and beef cocktail meatballs. Both worked great. Just threw them in frozen and let them cook for 30-35 minutes. The sauce by itself makes for a super easy and satisfying appetizer.

Really not so good. Found these to be rather flavorless. They smelled great when cooking, but they were a huge disappointment.

This recipe is great due to the fresh parsley and use of everything organic. Also, I recommend adding in some red table wine while cooking the sauce, letting it reduce.

I made this for a tapas party I catered, and while the guests approved, I thought the texture of the meatballs was lacking(maybe I should have heeded previous reviewers advice to add an egg white to bind). Overall the dish lacked a kick

We made this as part of a tapas party. Made them the night before. Browned them in the oven and warmed them in the sauce. We used more pork and less beef (the beef was lean and the pork was not, we reversed them). We covered them for the night. Come party time, we heated the whole thing up again.

My family really likes these meatballs. I also don't brown them first. Instead I cook them in the microwave. This saves time & mess & draws out some of the fat. Making half a recipe, I nuke them for about 10 minutes, then with a slotted spoon transfer the balls to the sauce to simmer till done. Delish!

A huge hit at my most recent dinner party. I too skipped using the fying pan and put the meatballs straight into the sauce for about 1.5 hrs.

not a bad recipe thanks to much of the advice from below. i used really lean ground turkey and an egg white to bind the mixture and lightly baked the meatballs. afterwards, i let the meatballs cook longer in the sauce. i actually omitted the oil from the sauce and used the liquid that was in with the whole canned tomatoes, added some fresh chopped tomatoes and a little bit of tomato paste. turned out really well. i'd keep this recipe on hand.

I replicated the entire tapas menu as featured in Gourmet for a friend's birthday party. This, and the potato frittata were huge hits, although an awful lot of work. I used two pans at the same time to brown the meatballs and refrigerated them. An hour before dinner time, I combined the ingredients for the sauce and added the meatballs. They are fragrant and juicy.

For this or any meatball recipe, save time by browning/cooking meatballs on a baking sheet in a hot to moderate oven.

A basic recipe that can defitely be expanded upon. I agree with the other reviewer to add an egg to help bond the ingredients together. I added some fresh oregano and that really brought the flavor out. Definitely worth a try as the basics of this recipe are pretty good.

you will find that if you mix one egg with the ground meat it will hold together better. also do not fry up the meatballs but place them in the sauce and allow to cook with the sauce for 2 to 3 hours. your sauce will taste more flavorful and the meatballs will be tender and juicy.
