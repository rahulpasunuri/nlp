Very tasty, but the top browned quickly, so I covered loosely with tinfoil and the ganache never hardened to piping consistency for me so I poured it over top.I used half the ground coffee and omitted the molasses. I added a tablespoon of Kahlua to the cheesecake batter. It was a hit, even though it wasn't as pretty as the photo. I would make it again with modifications to the icing.

exceptional! I love coffee-flavoured desserts and this one is supurb! Okay, I substituted 3 pkgs of Starbuck's Via instant coffee (Italian Roast) for the espresso, but other than that, no ingredient changes. Also, I divide the ganache ingredients in 2 and make 2 batches. I found by the time the cake was ready for decorating, the ganache had hardened. MUCH easier just to make the second half when needed!

I've been making this about twice every year for the past few years, and have received various feedback-- mostly very good. Dessert connoisseurs and those with a strong sweet tooth tend to love it more-- generally people who detect more flavor within rich sweetness. My Asian and vegetarian friends thought it was too sweet-- varying palettes. That said, I would strongly recommend this to those who enjoy rich desserts. Oreos (filling scraped out) work well for the crust.

Followed as written. Perfection. Use good quality chocolate. Very rich and a bit time consuming to make. I had enough ganache to coat the sides of the cheesecake as well which really added to the presentation. East to make and looks exactly like the photo! Flavors are subtle but a unique intermingling.

This is my favorite cheesecake recipe! I've made it several times and always get compliments. A few steps to make, but well worth the effort.

Additional Notes: For the crust, I used cream-filled chocolate sandwich cookies and only half of the butter (the cream filling helps bind the crumbs). When adding the ganache layer, I poured in just enough to coat the bottom and sides of the crust (I left the remaining ganache in a covered bowl at room temperature, overnight, until the cheesecake was completely chilled). For the filling, I used light rum because I didn't have dark (worked fine). I also omitted the ground espresso beans in the filling (I didn't add more espresso powder, but certainly will next time). For the topping, I doubled everything. Just before serving, unmold the cheesecake from the pan. I had a little trouble getting the springform pan to release at first, but it came right off after letting the cheesecake sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes. For the ganache lattice, I piped the lattice design onto my completely chilled cheesecake, added the chocolate covered coffee beans, then popped the whole thing back into the fridge to firm the ganache before serving. If you pipe the ganache before removing the sides of the pan, the ganache will firm up against the cold pan and glue the springform to the cheesecake.

I am amused by the wide range of tastes reflected in the reviews. I have made this twice now, first in 2002 and again in 2012. Both times the dessert was met with overwhelming approval. I absolutely adore the flavor combination of coffee and chocolate. Try it!

Rating: 1
Too many steps and a lot of work for what is an overly rich and unnecessarily complex dessert. The ganache layer especially is redundant as it chilled into such a firm layer that I had trouble sawing into it. The cheesecake is better with just the biscuit base, the cheesecake layer and the sour cream topping. I also left out all the sugar in the base and used Oreos for the base, and it was perfect. Save yourself some time and lots of unnecessary calories and make something simpler.

This dessert was absolutely delicious! I had no problems making this. I did make a few changes though. I used dark molasses and only 1 tablespoon of finely ground espresso beans. The filling had plenty of coffee flavor. I filled a 9X13 pan with about an inch of water and placed that on the bottom rack of the oven to simulate a steam bath. I only had one small crack on the top. One tip is to use the ganache at room temp. Any warmer is too soft and any cooler is too hard to push through the pastry tip. Very good recipe. I will definitely be making this again!

Being a chocoholic and a coffee lover, I had high hopes for this, but I have to admit, I was underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong, it's a very enjoyable eat, but I felt it wasn't fudgy enough given the copious amounts of chocolate, and the coffee flavour wasn't anything like pronounced enough. It was rich and it was sweet in parts, but it wasn't until after 6 days in the fridge that it finally melded together some, but even then the flavours still didn't balance. It just didn't justify the time and expense. So I'll give it Three forks, but not Four. I pretty much followed the recipe, using semi-sweet choc in the crust (I'd strongly suggest less in the future, and less sugar there too), bittersweet in the ganache, with finely ground espresso beans and regular instant coffee in the filling, no texture problems. My crust didn't stretch high enough up the sides, so I made another, 8" cocoa-graham crust and poured the remaining filling, sans ganache, into that and made 1/3 more topping for it as well. I'll freeze that and see how it ages... I too used a steam bath (thanks knkrueger), baked at 425 for 15 mins, then 225 for 1 hr 45 m. And for piping the ganache, I chilled, then rested it at room temp. It'll be a while before I think about making this one again.

This cheesecake was a huge hit with the 18 guests at our holiday dinner party. Many thanks to "a cook from Ashland Ohio" as her tips for preparing the ganache made decorating the cake much more easy. I used both MEDAGLIA D'ORO Instant Espresso Coffee and I ground some fresh espresso beans as called for in the filling recipe. The latter did not dissolve all the way with the liquids, but did during the baking because the filling turned out smooth and delicious. The texture and flavor of this cheesecake was wonderful and due to its richness it served more than 12 people.

I know, I know, everybody is going to think I'm crazy but this cheesecake is way too heavy and the coffee overpowers the cheesecake so badly that it can't be tasted. If all you want to do is to taste chocolate then why go to all the trouble of making this ... just eat it by it's self.

I made this after seeing it on smittenkitchen.com and I just loved it. It was my first recipe made with my new stand mixer and it was a great choice. It freezes really well too which is great if you, like me, can only eat so much of this super indulgent cheesecake at a time. If you are familiar with all the techniques, it is not so difficult to make--only time consuming. And if you use a springform pan and cannot use a waterbath to help eliminate a burned and cracked crust, try putting a few ovensafe bowls or pans of water in the oven while it preheats and leave them in there during cooking. You will get the same effect as a water bath (i.e. steam circulating during cooking) without running the risk of water seeping into your springform. Try it! It is like, my only great idea when it comes to cooking.

I've made a lot of cheesecakes, and after seeing the initial 94% approval rating, I decided to add this masterpiece to my list. Like others, I encountered a couple of problems, but I should have gone with my gut feeling from the beginning, and those problems would have been eliminated. Cooking in a water bath will eliminate problems with the crust sticking, scorching or cracking, and will also help to eliminate some of the deep sinking and any cracks when the filling cools. Otherwise, even with the initial imperfections, the birthday girl (grown woman) recipient was ga ga over it.

Great! I follow the original recipe except I did not use the ground coffee beans because I like a smooth texture.

This is my standard cheesecake recipe, althought I have modified it a lot. I dont use rum, or espresso beans or rum. I do add double strenght espresso instead of the rum, with added vanilla. I use have bittersweet and 1/2 extra dark chocolate with AND my crust is a blend of the chocolate wafers and almond biscotti. I have added ground almonts and served with a cherry topping instead of the chocolate latice top and that was good as well. This is what my granddaughter always requests for her birthday dessert. At least since she became an adult. Its a grown up dessert.

THE best chocolate/coffee cheesecake dessert I've ever had! If you're not an extreme fan of these flavors, then don't bother, but if you are - it's WORTH IT!!! Make sure you read reviews from others who have experimented with it before trying - everything from crust sticking to bottom of pan, filling rising too high, sour cream topping "melting" and running off, etc., can ALL be overcome w/ some common sense and experience. Ganache should always be made fresh and if you follow directions exactly, should have no problem getting right consistency to pipe. Serves 20 or more, heat knife or use hot water when slicing, so you don't destroy the beautiful top. A show stopper!

There is a certain satisfaction one gets after completing a work of art. This is one of those momments. This was my first cheesecake and I am beyond delighted with the results. Thankfully I used the recommendation from a previous reviewer to bake the cheesecake in a water bath. It was perfect on the inside and not one crack on the outside. I decided to use only 2 tablespoons of instant espresso powder and to not use the ground beans. I also went with half bittersweet and half semisweet chocolate. A must is the lattice top, it is worth every bit of time and effort. Don't be intimidated with the ganache. Just take your time and let it sit at room temperature, stirring often to cool it evenly. Pop it in the fridge for a short bit until it feels right to work with. Above all else, just have fun! Bon Appetit!!

It was a lot of work but the end result was amazing. Go ahead and pop the ganache into the fridge to get it the right consistency (you can always reheat it if it gets to hard.) But the lattice top got many raves. I also omitted the ground coffee beans as I didn't have any and like a smoother cake. Instead, I added a little extra espresso powder. I didn't have any problems with the crust being too hard to cut through. Next time when I make it, I may substitute one of the bricks of cream cheese with sour cream. It is beyond rich!!! Lastly, I don't know how people can fit that much batter into a springform without having it rise way above the edge. I may just not fill it as full next time since it rose, fell, and cracked miserably around the edge. Luckily the decoration covers all that. People loved it.

This cake is truly exceptional! It has a wonderfully complex, yet approachable flavor. The only gliches I found were that the cake took about an hour and 20 minutes (or more) to bake and the ganache for the latice was very difficult to get to the right consistency. This may have been my fault since I couldn't finish the cake in one day and had to refrigerate the ganache overnight, then put it in a double boiler. After a few tries, I did get it to work--but phew. I highly recommend making this cake. It is a bit time consuming--but easy-- and oh, so so good!

Update: Do not chill the ganache as previously suggested. Only by not chilling was I finally able to do the latticework on my fourth cheesecake. Also, a friend suggested adding peanut butter, so I spread a very thin layer of peanut butter on top of the ganache right after removing from the freezer. The result was a subtle hint of peanut butter that added depth of flavor to this wonderful cheesecake.

Best,and I mean BEST cheesecake I have ever had in my life! I am a chocoholic and the espresso flavor just made it even better! It is extremely rich and it makes many more than 12 servings, even for a chocoholic like me! I ate 3 or 4 approx. 1" slices over the course of a day, and I was having blood work done the next day for a knee replacement. The morning of my knee replacement, they told me that I was "pre- diabetic." Not what I wanted to hear before major surgery but after surgery we realized that the increase in my blood sugar was probably from all the sugar I consumed in that cheesecake I ate that day! Subsequent tests have found my blood sugar to be ok, but what a surprise that was. The decorating on the top of this cheesecake (the lattice design) is very forgiving so don't worry about it having to be perfect. The cheesecake tastes so PHENOMENAL, I don't think anyone is going to be worrying about straight or perfectly spaced lines of ganache on the top! ENJOY!!!

Wonderful cheesecake! The best thing to do with the ganache, instead of hassling with the pastry bag, is just to spread it over the top of the cheesecake, leaving about 1/2 inch edge around the cake. The combination of coffee, chocolate, and cream cheese is just amazing.

I made this to great aclaim. I made it following the recipe. I had problems with each stage which had to be overcome. The crust initially was too moist and kept sliding down the sides of the springform pan. It took a while for the butter to cool before it became more managable. The cake was pretty shakey after the suggested time so I let it cook another 20 minutes. It puffed up, but then sank in the center but not at the sides. The sour cream topping all flowed to the center so I had to spread it a couple of times to get it to cover the whole cake. I baked it an extra 20 minutes and was concerned that it would be over done. This was my first try with a pastry bag so working with the ganache was a challange. Once I got it to the right consistancy it flowed fine, but then it began to solidify and become harder to work with. I ended up covered with chocolate. The only place I missed was the ceiling. Rosettes were out of the question. Having said all this, the cake was received with more enthusiam than I have experienced. So my point is, don't get put off by the effort or problems along the way. The end result will wow forlks.

This cheesecake is amazing! It is time consuming, but what amazing dessert isn't? I saw that some reviewers had trouble...thought I could help you out. I've made 16 of these, so I think I've got it down. Cheesecakes need to be baked in a water bath. Wrap the sides and bottom of the pan with foil, place it in a deep pan, and add hot water (only about 1 inch deep) just before putting it in the oven. This adds moisture and prevents the top from browning too quickly and cracking (note - the cake will take a little longer to bake). Next, use INSTANT ESPRESSO POWDER, not espresso grounds, they will not dissolve completely. For the ganache, it will not pipe at room temp. Put it in the fridge to firm up. Then, instead of the microwave (this can scorch or possibly heat too much) set it out to come to room temp. Then whip it on medium speed until just smooth with the paddle attachment of a standmixer. With these tips, your cheesecake will be flawless!

It was time-consuming but delicious. I used white rum instead of dark rum, but it did not change the flavor. Be careful with piping the ganache because as it melts it does not hold its shape. I found that heating the knife before cutting through the cheesecake made a cleaner cut and went through the cold ganache very easy (we actually broke a knife trying to cut it the first time.) I will definitely make this again.

I made this cheesecake as the grand finale for a 4 course luncheon I did for my daughter's high school teachers one cold winter day. Even tho this cheesecake is very time consuming, it is by far worth every minute of time. There was cheesecake left over (it is very rich!) and I ate quite a bit of it over the next 36 hours. I had to have blood work drawn the next day for knee replacement surgery, and imagine my surprise when the doctor told me that I was pre-diabetic!! They redid the test and I was not pre-diabetic; it was from all of the sugar in the cheesecake that I greedily consumed!

Well, I'm not even a coffee drinker, but this cheesecake was amazing! The crust is really spectacular: I added some extra nutmeg and a little cinnamon...it tasted almost like candy. I used the ganache layer on top of the crust and enjoyed the taste and consistency. I omitted the coffee/espresso from the filling; instead, I just increased the rum slightly. Then just added the sour cream topping with a few chocolate chips. The flavor combinations were great. Served with some fresh raspberries on the side, soaked in some Kahlua of course! Delicious!

Lets face it, 2 pounds of chocolate, 2 pounds of cream cheese, some liquor, coffee, cream, and sugar and I believe you will have decadence. Large wedges went home with everyone who tasted it. I'll have to make another just to keep some to eat for breakfast. The ganache at room temp clearly was not working for me and chilling it and nuking it made it a bit lumpy and got stuck often in the piping tip, but tasted fabulous all the same. Definitely waiting a day before eating just about completely dissolved the ground coffee into the filling. In sum, puts anything from the Cheesecake Factory to shame.

Two others couldn't believe that I made it - thought I had gone out and purchased it. The taste was incredibly wonderful. It was easy to decorate. Had to refrigerate the ganache - then microwave on low for a few seconds to get the right decorating consistency. Decorated with chocolate covered espresso beans. This is a real keeper.

The marriage of chocolate, coffee, and creaminess of the cheescake was heavenly. The presentation was professional and amazingly simple to do. I was reluctant to put all the coffee grounds in the batter so I strained them out. Then I tasted the batter and decided to put back half of the strained coffee grounds back in the batter. I'm glad I did. Next time I will keep all the coffee in the recipe and will use chocolate covered espresso beans as part of the decoration of the cake. Will make this one a regular on my short baking list.

This cake was so amazing! My sister and I made this together as a gift for a family friend, but we were so upset at not being able to try it, that we made another one that night. The coffee grinds really give it a nice strong coffee flavor, but the ganache was not thick enough at room temperature to really do anything fancy with, so we just poured it on top of the cake. IT's really beautiful when it comes together, and tastes AMAZING.

I made this to be the highlight of a Christmas Eve dinner, and it really wowed the crowd. It fell together beautifully, i was talking to it like Golem to his ring while I was making it ("My precious! My precious!") so I was pretty pleased with myself. There are two things previous people have said that I agree with. First, it is indeed hard to cut into it once the ganache layer underneath firms up after refrigeration. If there is a way to make that part creamier (add more whipping cream I guess) then I would do that. Second, there is no way leaving the ganache at room temperature will render it hard enough to pipe onto the cake successfully. I took one woman's advice on here and fully refrigerated the ganache, then nuked it on defrost until it was just the right temperature for the pastry bag. This was my first time using one and it looked a little funky but the overall impression was really attractive. I also want to say that you can really taste the coffee in this. Overall though, for "fancy" cheesecakes, I'm going to stay with the Sunshine Cake on this site.

Wow! This was AWESOME! Can't believe I made it. The presentation was outstanding. I used a 9' pan. I couldn't find chocolate wafers, so I used the tops and bottoms of oreos. Left out the chocolate and sugar in the crust - didn't need it. Felt like I could've done without the ganache layer - it was a little too much chocolate with the crust. Used kahlua in the filling. The topping was great for covering up cracks. I refrigerated the ganache and it was too hard, so I heated it up in the microwave a little and it was perfect piping consistency. This will make you look like a star!!

This is incredibly rich and delicious, and a real coffee lover's cake. The espresso powder and the gound espresso beans might even be a little much together-next time I may leave out one or the other. I also think the entire package of chocolate cookies may make a bit too much crust. That said, I followed the recipe exactly and was delighted with the results. I had no trouble with premature browning and did not find that the ganache layer made the cake hard to cut. Could be this is one that should be underbaked slightly, which is often a good idea with cheesecakes. I did have a little trouble piping the ganache for the topping because I refrigerated it overnight and it probably wassn't soft enough yet to get through the small star tip. Instead of regular coffee beans I garnished the cake with chocolate covered ones, and it was probably the prettiest cheesecake I've ever made. Lots of steps, time consuming, but not difficult. Don't rush, read the recipe carefully, do not overbake,and it'll come out fine.

I had a number of problems with this time-consuming and very expensive cheesecake. Even though the recipe states that the espresso beans should dissolve in the liquids, they never do. The cheesecake was VERY brown after only 20 mins. of baking, yet was raw. And the sour cream topping ran off the cake onto the pan. I made this for guests, but won't serve this to them.

What did I do wrong? The cheesecake was VERY brown only 20 minutes into the baking time, the espresso never dissolved into the liquid (how could it when the liquid was not hot?) so I had bits of espresso in my batter, and the sour cream topping was so runny, it slid off the cheesecake? I'm so disappointed, because I made this especially for guests, and now I'm unwilling to serve it.

Okay - the way the reviewers RAVED about this recipe I was expecting greatness. I was making dinner for my boyfriends mom for the first time & was really looking to impress her. I spent a LOT of time making this cake and don't know if it was worth it in the end. The ganache was too runny to pipe in an icing bag (which I bought especially for this recipe). so I just poured it on top - which was fine. It tasted good, but not AMAZING which is what I was hoping for. I made it 2 days in advance, but the leftovers 4 days later were much better. This is also a pretty fattening cheesecake (4 packages of creamcheese!) I'm still working this one off at the gym!

This cheesecake does have quite a few steps, but is really easy to make and worth the effort. I usually have to bake it 20-30 mintues longer than the recipe states (before adding the sour cream topping), but it always turns out great! Please do make it at least one day in advance to allow the flavors to come together, and slice it thin, because it is so rich.

I added the ganache to the crust and it did make it very difficult to cut through, but the taste of it all together was worth the work. I can't wait to make this again!

This was a fantastic cheesecake! Not only did it taste fabulous but it looked fabulous too! As the other reviews suggested I didn't put a layer of ganache on the crust - next time will try. If you are looking for a cheesecake recipe that is a sure bet - this is it.

This was very rich! I made exactly like recipe specified. Next time, I would leave the ganache out on the bottom of the crust. The crust was to die for. This kind've reminded me of Tiramisu. Do eat small pieces.

This is one of the best non-traditional cheesecakes I've ever made. Every that tasted it agreed as well. I don't know if it was my oven, but I had to bake it longer (1hr 20min) for it to set. Enjoy!

EXCELLENT!! The only change I made in the recipe was to make half the ganache and not pour any over the crust. I was afraid it would be too hard to cut. After eating it, I think it would have been chocolate-sweet overkill anyway. People just raved about this cheesecake.

This cheesecake is hands down the best I've ever made or eaten anywhere. I didn't have a 10" pan so I pressed the crust into 2-9" pans on the bottom only. I accidently used the whole pint of whipping cream for the ganache but that allowed me to spread 1.5 cups over each crust and still have plenty for decorating. I used an extra T. of coffee crystals figuring expresso is stronger than coffee and I increased the topping ingredients by one third to have enough for both pans. They only needed 45 minutes to bake. I served them at a fellowship meal at church, cutting at least 12 pieces from each cake. I'd like to say there wasn't a dry eye in the house, but that might be stretching it just a bit. I can say it was wonderful.

Made this recipe according to the directions and loved the result. The cake unmolded well, kept it's shape and looked beautiful. Taste was outstanding. I loved the sour cream topping on woud not omit, as I thought it really added to the cake. The ganache did not get to a piping consistancy at room temperature in my case, so I just spread it on. Looked good anyway! Had ganache leftover, which I used to cover a chocolate cake with. Some subtle cahnges I made: skipped the chocolate in the crust ( didn't need it), used all Kahlua instead of rum because it was what I had on hand and skipped the coffee beans, just used espresso instant coffee. Wonderful result, will definately make again.

Rating: 4
I have made this several times and it never fails to please, even when my piping skills are off. My pan is only 9", so I make two 4" cheesecakes as well. It freezes well and the little ones make really special gifts. Give the pastry bag a try. Most people are easily impressed by the effort. As a variation to make the capuccino effect more subtle, I have used just a few teaspoons of coffee dust from my grinder instead of coarse ground expresso. This must be made at least a day ahead to let the flavors blend properly.

I FOLLOWED THE RECIPE EXACTLY (NOT TOO GOOD AT THE DECORATIONS SO I JUST SPREAD IT ON THE TOP EDGES AROUND THE CAKE) WOW!!!!!!!!

Phenominal! My husband said it was the best cheesecake he ever ate. I agree. I read all of the reviews and used a crust of just chocolate graham crackers, butter, and 1 t. cinnamon. I only had kahlua, so I used that in place of the rum and used 2 1/2 T of instant coffee and no ground coffee. It was SO good and SO rich. The combination of flavors is incredible. Gotta try this one! I didn't have too much ganache, unlike other reviewers, but I ended up spreading some over the top since my skills with a pastry bag are marginal at best.

I make this cheesecake for my husband to take to the office on his birthday. Everyone loved it and my platter came back with nary a crumb, plus a small piece that was set aside for me to taste, since I hadn't cut it prior to sending. I found it fairly easy to make. I cut the ganache in half after reading the reviews but then had to make more to put on top of the cake. I had no trouble with the topping because it was made fresh and was very pliable to apply to the top of the cake. That might be the secret, to make it in two steps. The first time I made the ganache, I cooked it on top of the stove until it simmered; the second time I heated the cream in the microwave until it just started to bubble and it made a very spreadable topping which was much easier. I wouldnm't change anything about the recipe unless you want to cut down on calories and then you could eliminate the chocolate and brown sugar from the crust. I made zigzag lines, crisscross on top with the ganache and it looked wonderful. I made it exactly as the recipe stated. It is rich and chocolately but that enhances such a beautiful looking piece of artwork. It's definitely a keeper.

Rating: 4
This cheesecake was a hit! I simplified the crust by just using crumbled pre-made shortbread crust (the kind you buy in the tin shell) and added about 2 tbsp butter. (Also cuts down on some calories). I also found that 1/2'ing the ganache recipe still provided ample chocolate. Overall a wonderful recipe and I highly recommend it for special occasions.

This cheesecake was delicious, but VERY sweet. Although I would consider making it again, it took me over 4 hours to finish. I brought it to a party and everyone thought it was very good, but I noticed that most people couldn't finish an entire piece. It is extremely rich. If you have half a day to spare and you don't mind spending it in the kitchen than this is the recipe for you.

This was a truly terrific cheesecake. Thanks for the reviewers' advise! I used just chocolate graham cracker crumbs and butter for the crust, and omitted the coffee from the cake. I used only half the ganache layer on the crust and it was PLENTY rich. It's very easy, rather quick assemble. I put the remaining ganache in a ziplock baggie and let it chill until the cheesecake was ready to decorate. I kneaded it until it was slightly warmed and pliable and snipped a small hole in the corner of the bag to make the lines. I merely made layers of curly swirls around the edge and it looked just lovely. I think the coffee beans are a perfect touch.

This was a huge hit!! I modified the crust the second time around-no need for the chocolate, too hard, oreo crust works just fine. Eliminated the sour cream topping, too many extra calories and it was still excellent, served it with a bit of whipped cream instead.

OH MY. I've made many cheesecakes in my day, and this is definitely one of the best! It is sinfully rich....but you live only once, right? I ended up having to refrigerate the ganache to make it firm enough to pipe, but that's really no bother. We ended up with extra (there were only four of us at dinner), so I froze the individual slices. Great for a quick "chocolate moment" fix!

This is by far the best dessert I've ever made, and I've made quite a few! I am known for my cakes, but this one got the best reviews ever! It was served at a friend's housewarming party. The whole cake was gone in no time, my husband couldn't cut it fast enough, even though there were other yummy things served. Some people could not believe it is not from a bakery, even though it wasn't one of my prettiest cakes (I smudged the top accidentaly when decorating it). One change: for the crust, I used Oreo crumbs with butter, nutmeg, and a little surgar, and even then it was very hard to cut right out of the fridge, because of the chocolate ganache layer. If you are thinking about making a cheesecake, this is it!

A cheesecake that tastes as good as it looks. Delicious...decadent...especially for coffee and Kahlua lovers. Very rich, could easily get more than 20 slices out of this one. I made the crust without the brown sugar or the chocolate, and it turned out great, as I didn't want the crust to be too hard. Chocolate Teddy Grahams are recommended.

I've made this cheesecake twice already this month. Friends keep asking for it because they say it looks like it came from a bakery. I did have to cook it for about 15 min longer but other than that it is a great recipe that i will use again. Warning this cheesecake is very RICH, cut your slices thin! I got about 20 slices out of it.

This is the best looking desert we have ever made. The tast was out of this world. I also had to cook this cake for an extra 10-15 minutes. I also used more wafer cookies, prabably 1.5 times as many. There is no doubt that this is a four fork recipe.

All cheesecakes are delicious, this one is beautiful, too. I baked mine an extra 10 minutes because it didn't seem firm enough. I figured that it didn't matter if it cracked because I was going to cover the top in sour cream and ganache. (It didn't crack, after all.) When my ganache seemed too runny to pipe, I put in the refrigerator until it firmed to the right consistency. It was so rich I served 18 people (you know all those wussys who just want a tiny sliver?!)!

I made this for an office birthday celebration and agree that it was a showstopper. I made it exactly as directed, except I did not use the sour cream topping. Instead, I spread the remaining ganache over the top of the cooled cheesecake, and then piped coffee-flavored whipped cream decoratively over the top. I decorated the whipped cream with chocolate-covered coffee beans. People were blown away.

I'm famous in my office for my desserts, particularly cheesecakes, and this was a show-stopper. I made the crust using only chocolate wafers and butter (simple, classic and foolproof), left the kahlua out of the ganache (only because I didn't have any) and added extra instant espresso powder instead of the ground coffee beans to the filling to avoid grittiness. I found the baking times to be just about right. The cheesecake was more jiggly than the recipe suggests, which is typical, but it firmed up beautifully as it cooled. I refrigerated the leftover ganache to decorate the cake the next day and it was too solid to pipe, so I warmed it over simmering water, cooled it to room temperature and it was perfect. I had the right amount of filling and just a little ganache left over after I decorated the cake to look like the picture. This cake looked and tasted fabulous.

Rating: 4
About two inches into my first line across the top, my pastry bag exploded and made the cake less than attractive. But luckily all of the guests I was serving were close friends so it wasn't a complete disaster. To the cook who had a problem firming it up, mine didn't seem nearly firm enough but after a night in the fridge it was the perfect cheesecake consistancy, maybe you should just let it be. Incredible recipe.

Rating: 3
HELP! I followed all the directions very carefully, but couldn't get the cheesecake to firm up as directed. Recipe said to cook until middle 2" moved slightly when shaken, but that never happened. Therefore, I cooked it longer, and burned it slightly. Any suggestions? Want to try again, as the flavors were wonderful.

Beautiful and delicious-- what else could you ask for? I followed the advice of a couple of reviewers and left out the chocolate from the crust, which turned out delicious without it. I also left out the espresso beans from the filling and the decoration and didn't miss them at all. This makes a HUGE cheesecake and I had a ton of ganache left over (but I'm not complaining!) I even piped it on just like the picture and my guests could not believe it was homemade: they made me show them the recipe to prove I made it! Surprisingly easy, though make sure you leave yourself adequate time for the steps. This is a no-brainer-- all the accolades are true (except for the one odd-ball who didn't like it; what was he thinking??)

(I'm updating my comments, I just found some information which might answer why some folk's ganache was runny. In the latest issue of Cook's Illustrated; it seems you should use Heavy Cream, Whipping Cream has less fat, and thus doesn't firm up as much when whipped. I had no problem with my ganache, I checked my fridge and sure enough it was Heavy Cream I used). This is a wonderful recipe, my friends thought I bought it at a bakery, it looked so good. I was a bit on the fence about adding the coffee beans to the cheese cake portion of the cake (I thought it would be like eating coffee grounds), but they are not noticeable in texture, only in taste, the cheese cake tastes like coffee ice cream! My two tips are: use a serrated knife for cutting (helps when you get to the crust), and run a knife around the cake to loosen it from the sides of the pan right after you take it out of the oven (this stops the cake from cracking).

I made this for some friends who are real coffee afficionados and they couldn't get enough of it! Nobody believed I made it--they thought it was bakery-bought. I froze the remainder in slices and they defrosted well weeks later. This is stellar!!

I won kudos all round at the 2 parties I took this to - they were sure it was store bought. I made a 3/4 recipe in a 10" pan for one and a 1/2 recipe in an 8" pan and both worked well. I also used regular graham cracker crust after reading other reviews and it worked well. The 3/4 recipe reduces some of the ingredients down to only 1 C which works better.

Rating: 4
The cake was a great hit at my Easter dinner. I also found the baking time to be about 35-40 minutes more than the recipe instructed. The room temperature ganache was too thin to use for decorating so I resorted to just spreading it across the top. The cake was still beautiful. I followed another cook's tip of omitting the chocolate from the crust. It was definitely still chocolatey enough for any chocolate lover.

I have made this cheesecake now three times. It was perfect from the first time. I tested it for a dinner party and then served it at the party. The guests just loved it. The last time I experimented and made it in a 5" and 8 1/2" springform because I wanted to use it for two separate occasions. I froze them both. Freezing did not affect the flavor or texture but on the larger one the sour cream topping did have little cracks in it. Both groups who ate the frozen one never knew the difference. Make this it's great!

Made this for Easter and got rave reviews. Used only 4 oz of chocolate in the crust, and it sliced easily.

This was a fabulous, extremely rich cheesecake. I omitted the kahlua and rum because I didn't have any on hand and the result was still delicious.

I would not make this again by the given recipe. I wish I had read the reviews first because I thought it was a lot of work and it needs changes for my taste. The crust is too rich for the rest of the cake; the wafers and butter would suffice. I would also leave out the ground beans. Although I cooked longer than suggested, the cake was not completely done in the center and was extremely brown and cracked. I will make this cake again with changes.

Rating: 4
A real winner for Easter supper. My only problem was the baking time -- I don't think my oven is off because everything else bakes fine within the specified time but this cheesecake took a good 20-30 minutes longer. I am not sure what the sour cream topping really does for it. As for the lattice work -- fine if you are into that but I had plenty of ganache left and just put it all on top, like icing. I did omit the beans in the cake because I, too, like a smooth cheesecake.

Rating: 3
I haven't served this yet but all bowl swipes are promising. I don't understand why the reserved ganache is supposed to be kept at room temp -- I tried that and it came out a latticed mess. For the rosettese, I let it sit in the frigo over night with much better success. If this is a hit and I decide to make it again, I will be sure to refrigerate the reserve ganache before attempting decorative touches.

Absolutely wonderful. I made this for a dinner party last night and every last piece was gone!

Excellent and a big hit with all, especially chocolate lovers. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips from those larges bags at Costco and saved a lot of work cutting the bakers chocolate into chunks. Also, instead of Kahlua in the ganache, I used a chocolate-mint liquor. Turned out great!

Terrific and easy. Mine took quite a bit longer to cook then the recipe said. The top was getting brown, but still with too much jiggle. Not sure what I did wrong, so just kept cooking it.

I'm a bit of a cheesecake snob, and I have to say this is one of the best I've ever made or eaten. I used chocolate-flavored Nilla wafers instead of the usual chocolate wafers, and the crust was tender, even directly from the refrigerator. The "Serves 12" advice is way off - I brought it into work for a celebration and about 25 people ate from of it, and about 1/4 of it was left for the next day. I also used chocolate-covered espresso beans instead of plain ones on top of the cake, because I had them "just lying around" in my pantry. Final word: Don't be intimidated by the apparent complexity of the recipe, it's a snap.

This is a beautiful cheesecake, definately impressive. Be warned, this is very, very rich. A sliver of this cake is enough. The crust is extremely sweet.

This was wonderful! Don't worry about the small amount of molasses, Hilda, it is just fine. I used "light" molasses, which is dark brown in color and strong, but it was GREAT. I also left out the ground coffee beans, and, based on other comments, am glad I did. It was creamy and wonderful. I only had a 9 inch springform, which I used. So, I cooked it a little longer. It was tall, beautiful and delicious.

This was great! It took a bit of time (and effort), but it turned out beautifully and everyone was impressed. Next time, I don't think I'll add the whole ground expresso beans, because I think I would prefer the smoother texture. Maybe add a little more of the instant expresso instead. But all in all, a great, impressive cheesecake that's worth the effort.

It sounds wonderful. I adore cheesecake that's creamy and heavy. I know I'm going to love this recipe, but I question the mild-flavored light molasses.

I modified this recipe by only adding a shot of espresso instead of using rum, espresso powder, espresso coffee beans, and molasses and it turned out wonderfully. My crust burned a little so next time I would put foil around the edges half way through baking. Otherwise, the cheesecake was fabulous and can look quite professional if you use a pastry bag to make rosettes around the edges.

I made this for a Valentines Day party. It was pronounced the "Best Dessert Ever". My only comment echoes one of the previous ones regarding the crust. I didn't press the crust evenly in the "corner", where the base meets the ring of the spring tin, and i believe because it was too thick, it baked to hard. Otherwise, as far as cheesecakes go, this one is one of the best. And easy too!
