Good, but it's not going to wow anyone.

I used this recipe as a room-temperature salad on a buffet with other salads: traditional potato salad, a beet and feta salad, and a lettuce salad, along with grilled tenderloin sandwiches, grilled chicken and grilled balsamic peppers. The sugar snap pea/potato dish was one of the first to disappear.

I thought this was a good side dish for the nut and fish recipe suggested in the menu. It didn't overpower the fish.

This dish sounds good but it just doesn't blend together. It is like eating boiled potatoes and snap peas in the same bowl. Perhaps a longer saute for the potatoes would improve this dish?
