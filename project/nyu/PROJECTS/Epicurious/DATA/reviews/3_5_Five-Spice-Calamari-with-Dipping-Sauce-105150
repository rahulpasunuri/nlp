The cooking method for calamari is okay, however, I would never recommend the dipping sauce - nothing short of dreadful.

Sorry to rain on the parade... The flour/fry portion of the recipe was good (I own a deep fryer), and I would probably add some more crunch to the flour mixture with panko or breadcrumbs, etc., but I guess I'm a traditionalist when it comes to calamari as I much preferred to use the satziki that I happened to have around. I found the dipping sauce to be on the sweet side and lacking a kick, so I put some chili garlic in it which helped, but it still didn't leave me wanting more. I was pre-testing this recipe for a dinner party next Saturday, and I think I'll do something else...

I've been looking for an awesome squid recipe since visiting China a few years ago. Though this one is different than the spectacular local version , it is awesome in its own right. My s/other and I love it (but his boys won't touch the stuff - hoping they'll come around!).

I've made this a half dozen times now, and find myself more in love w/it every time I make it. Better than any restaurant calamari...and I'm an enthusiast. Don't skimp on the 5 spice...if it's not your fave then this recipe is not for you...if you love it like I do...this is orgasmic. For a great variant to the LOVELY dipping sauce (do both...very impressive) a homemade green goddess is amazing. Dipping is fundamental. Deelish!

Dipping sauce fabulous. Used the rest as a salad dressing. Awesome! Calamari - Tasty!!

I doubled the garlic in the sauce, as well as adding a handful of chopped cilantro and zest of one lime to the calamari as it was served. I also squeezed the juice of one lime over the calamari. I added some dried chile pepper flakes to the flour - enough to be visible in the flour mixture. Very tasty, we had it with stir fried veggies and plain basmati rice and heavy red wine, although beer would also be good.

Very tender and tasty used more spice. Sauce good too,but used less vinegar. Only problem was that the flour came off the calamari.

Absolutely delicious. We've made it several times for friends and it has always been a hit. It's a zippy recipe without the heat.

I dont like five spice powder so I omitted it. And had regular calamari fried with that fabulous dip. It was delicious. I served it at a dinner party and everyone loved it!!!

This recipe made a good overall impression--not a piece left! I added Tabasco sauce to the dipping sauce to spice it up!

I don't know what to say about the previous reviews. I didn't put the sauce in the processor at all, just mixed all the ingredients together. My husband and I thought it was a delicious recipe. He even proclaimed "you outdid yourself" which is high compliments in our household.

This recipe was very easy to prepare but the taste was rather disappointing. I personally found the five-spice powder to be a bit overbearing, particularly the cinnamon, and the dipping sauce was NOT a good thing. If you are a fan of Chinese Five-Spice, I'd definitely recommend trying this recipe with a different dipping sauce.

This recipe was not good and left my house smelling like licorice. The batter was a good consistency, but the anise and the cinnamon were too strong. Also, the dipping sauce was disgusting. The combination of flavors was just too weird tasting. I would not use this recipe again. I love this web site but this was a flop!
