I also only did the fig part of this recipe (overabundance of figs on the tree, trying out new ways to consume them all). But it didn't work out well for me. Maybe my broiler just didn't get hot enough, but the sugar only seemed to draw out the juices from the figs so that instead of caramelizing they just kind of cooked :( I would try this again, but next time I'll use my kitchen blowtorch to caramelize the tops.

Full disclosure--I only did the fig part of this recipe. I thought it was OK, but I wouldn't make again. I think the coulis would have helped, but the flavor of the figs doesn't interest me enough to try it.

A stunner. Succulent, sensuous, and wow! Not to mention simple and low-fat.

I'd prefer fresh raspberries here...
