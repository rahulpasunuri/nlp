Top notch in spite of the slightly confusing recipe - i.e. what to do with the roasted shallots and garlic? (answer: dump them in with the chickpeas). Made with sweet potato mash which was blended with reduced leftover chard liquid. A top notch idea if you ask me!

This was AHHHMAZING! Subbed Northern White Beans and served it over Freekah. The whole family went back for seconds. A keeper for sure.

The other reviewers who suggested serving this over mashed potatoes are spot-on. If you don't drain the chard, the extra broth gets rich with the oil from the garbanzo beans. It serves well as a gravy. Delicious.

This is such a versatile recipe. I never thought of roasting garbanzos until I came across this recipe. I didn't have bay leaves the first time, so threw in some sun-dried tomatoes, which lent different but equally yummy flavor. Later, I used whole cherry tomatoes and then oil-cured olives. Throw in fresh herbs of choice at the finish and toss with pasta. No limit to the options for these roasted garbanzos. Roasting gives flavorful garbanzos with a slightly chewy (in a good way) texture. I haven't made them with the chard, but am sure it would be lovely as well.

who could've guessed this would taste so rich and creamy? didn't have fennel so used cumin seed and dried chili flakes instead. followed the advice to saute chard stems with garlic and shallot, and to forgo the chicken broth. not a lot of work at all.

Excellent, but instead of discarding the chard stems, chop into pieces and sauté until soft, then add to the mix.

Made this to the letter (except for water/salt in chard instead of chicken broth), and then made mashed potatoes with the garbanzo oil and served the beans/chard on top. Made it into an incredibly delicious main dish!! Going to become a staple for sure!

I tend to agree with several of the reviews I've read, my only modification to an already delicious side dish would be to a) roast 4 or 5 shallots and b) use about 50% more chard. It isn't really that much work, particularly if you are cooking something else while poaching the garbanzos. The drained oil is quite nice for many things, particularly brushing pizza with when making varieties without a traditional sauce (spinach, shitake and roast garlic for instance) and I will try it as a base for a salad dressing this evening.

Rating: 4
OK, at first I was frustrated with the amount of work involved, and told my husband I probably wouldn't make it again...but then we ate it...and it was delicious!!! So I guess all those steps are worth it to get a healthy and delicious side. I'll be making it again.

This is quite simply, fabulous. The amount of olive oil used with the garbanzo beans is exactly right for an oven-poaching technique, which transfers the flavors of the garlic, shallots, and fennel seed perfectly to the beans. You get back the majority of the oil when you drain the beans ... it's a worthwhile technique to explore. Plus, the oil tastes heavenly when you re-use it to sauté other things, so there's no waste. I recommend increasing the amount of garlic you poach with the beans and adding a generous teaspoon or so of red pepper flakes. It's probably impossible to use too much garlic since it cooks into a suave, silky kernel that is wonderful in the stew, wonderful smeared onto toasted bread. Chop the chard stems into fine dice and sauté them with the garlic, bay, and shallots until softened. It's unholy to waste them. Forget the chicken broth. Really, this is superfluous and will only take away from perfection. The water left on the leaves from washing the chard is all you need. A quick squeeze of lemon over the dish before you hand it to the lucky diner is very nice.

Loved this! I sauteed tofu chunks separately to add, seasoning them with some Braggs and nutritional yeast flakes. The chard preparation seemed pretty redundant, so I just tossed the chard onto the tofu when it was done, poured the garbanzi in top, and stirred through. Really good - a keeper.

Rating: 2
Good not great. Minus points for the recipe's absurd amount of oil. Just drizzle enough over the beans. While the roasted garlic was great, it doesn't incorporate into the chard mixture very well. If you had small cloves it'd be better than large ones. Omit the chicken broth for a little bit of salted water and steam in the pan to make it fully vegetarian.

If you don't cut down on the oil, it is especially "Low-cholesterol" ONLY and not low fat! That being said, use some oil from the garbanzo roasting to saute the garlic, shallots, etc. Use only about 1/2 c chicken broth to cook the chard (keep the stems; cut them into 1" pieces and saute them for a couple of minutes before adding the leaves). Put the whole shebang over pasta. SEASON each step generously or it's pretty bland. Smash up the garlic before mixing to pasta (or whatever you're doing). Add a generous amount of chili flakes to both the garbanzos and chard for more oomph. Good dish, not great. Might play with it some more since can be healthful if you watch that oil

Rating: 4
Followed the garbanzo portion of the recipe exactly, including the full amount of oil. The "extra" oil can be used as a yummy flavorful dipping oil for yummy baguette. The chicken broth for the chard portion of the dish is completely unnecessary; just saute the chard  including the stems  with the onions/shallots and garlic in a little olive oil using the residual moisture from washing the greens. The pea and greens mixture can be great on crostini and the roasted garlic cloves are wonderful, along with everything else, smeared on toast.

Wow -- really delicious, and incredibly easy to make. Don't use too much oil, as others have suggested; my suggestion is to load up on the garlic, which gets nice and creamy and really makes the dish. Oh, and increase the amount of chard -- probably double -- for more greens than beans. But really a great little, simple recipe.

I bought swiss chard because I had never cooked with it before and wanted to try it. Found this recipe and it sounded pretty good and fast. I loved it -- halved the recipe because I only had 1 can of chick peas. I think I will discard the whole garlic cloves from the beans before mixing it with the chard. Also, I put this over some penne. Delish.

Rating: 2
I wouldn't classify this dish as "out of the park," but the flavors worked surprisingly well and it was a nice complement to my mustard-crusted chicken with balsamic reduction. I would cut the oil significantly, as others have mentioned and I may try something other than fennel next time-- it is not one of my favorites. I substituted a small white onion for the shallots, since I didn't want to go to the store. The husband liked it, so it's a success in my book.

Rating: 3
This will become a regular dish in our house. Really loved the flavors but made a few changes. I used half the amount of olive oil called for in the recipe and found I still had some leftover. Also, I used Lacinato Kale instead of chard-- I love how the kale stays firm even when cooked for 10 minutes. Lastly, added the juice of 1/2 a lemon to balance out the flavors. Fantastic!

Exceptional. Be sure to season well with a good sea salt and you won't believe the flavor of this dish! We omitted the fennel seed as we didn't have any on hand, but we added 3 TBSP fresh basil from our windowsill and that was just divine. We will make this again VERY soon. It is one of the best foods my husband and I have put together - and we cook every single day. This will be a staple in our home!

Chick peas and chard is a staple in my house so I was very pleased to come across this recipe. Roasting the chick peas with fennel and garlic really makes this dish. I didn't use broth because I didn't want the chard to be too soggy, and it turned out just the way I like it. I would definitely make this again. In fact, I think I will also try making a hummus out of the roasted chick peas, garlic and fennel.

I wasn't about to throw out lovely rainbow chard stems, so chopped them up and added. Also greatly reduced both the olive oil (for roasting) and the broth (for braising) and they both stayed in the dish. Added gnocchi and grilled chicken sausage, and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes. With some crusty Italian bread, it was a very nice meal!

I have never loved garbanzo beans, but the idea of roasting them caught my attention so I decided to make this. And it was lovely! Like other reviewers I used much less oil than the 1 1/4 c. called for (maybe 1/4 - 1/2 c.), which was totally fine. The recipe isn't totally clear if you are supposed to use or discard the shallots and garlic that are roasted with the garbanzos, so I decided to mash the garlic and mix it in, but left out the shallots. I will definitely make this again, especially for vegetarian friends (using veg instead of chicken stock)

We really enjoyed this recipe, and, yes, the OV needs to be pared down. I tweaked in a couple of different ways. The first time I added crushed red pepper to give it a little more spice. The next time I added finely diced preserved lemon peel (could use grated fresh peel). Yum. The next time I forgot that I had the beans in the oven and they turned into really crispy nuggets. I practically ate all the beans before they were mixed with the chard. The leftovers were used in 1) a frittata and 2) in a strata or bread casserole with goat cheese.

Surprisingly good. We used kale and chard.

This was a surprise hit! Don't leave out the fennel unless you know you don't like it. The fennel MADE this dish. (I was going to skip it since I didn't have any, but then ran to the store at the last minute. Very glad I did!) As others have said there's no need to use even HALF that much olive oil for the roasting; just pour in enough to coat when tossed. Even with that, I still had about 2T leftover. (Save your leftover oil and make a salad dressing with it to complement the flavors in your dinner) (And I also didn't see any need to use a glass baking dish. My Calphalon one worked just fine!) Also, I see no need to discard the broth from the veggies. It's really flavorful. Save it for soup for another day.

Made this for dinner last night with chard and beet greens from farmers' market. Loved it! Ditto on other reviewers' comments on the amount of olive oil - just eye-ball the amount so everything is nicely coated. Also used veg broth, as another reviewer did. Will definitely make this again!

The recipe calls for way way way too much olive oil for the garbanzo beans. I just drizzled them with oil after I put all the ingredients in the baking dish. Other than that, this was delicious. The roasted garbanzo beans came out with a smooth nutty and buttery taste. I was really impressed by the flavor. I also added a squeeze of lemon juice and a sprinkle of feta cheese to the top of each dish before serving.

This was absolutely fantastic. I'm no vegetarian, but I happily ate the leftovers as a stand-alone lunch. (I used vegetable "better than bouillon" instead of chicken stock - much more depth of flavor). I cut the olive oil way down, and didn't miss it. Also, don't waste the yummy "center stems" as directed...chop them to about 1/4" dice and sautee w/the garlic & shallots. They add so much! Fabulous!

Rating: 4
I adore this recipe! Use two star anise pods instead of the fennel seed (I don't like the texture of fennel seed), and only used 3/4 cup of oil to bake the garbanzos with. Then drained and really toasted them up in the pan with the 2T of garbanzo oil before adding the chard mixture and tossing. Absolutely scrumptious.

Rating: 3
Comfort food for a cold New England night. Used one can chick peas and one can white kidney beans. The copious amount of garlic is key. I dislike fennel so I omitted. I might of tried cumin instead??? I cut down on the oil as suggested and was delicious! Health and filling; the softened, subtle but incredibly flavorable garlic makes this dish a winner.

This is an amazing recipe! We all love it. Definitely save the liquid that the chard is cooked in, it's really tasty and can be sopped up with some crusty bread. I cooked it slightly longer and at higher temp. (350-375) since I live in a high altitude, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was awesome.

Hello, let's make this recipe a lot simpler. I only had one shallot and one tin of garbanzos so I chopped up the shallot, 4 large cloves of garlic and the red stalks from the chard and tossed them in a pan with 1 T of grapeseed oil and 1/2 t of fennel seeds and sauteed till tender. Then I tossed in the rinsed garbanzo beans and cooked for a few minutes longer, then added the chopped swiss chard in two batches, 1 bay leaf and 1/2 cup of chicken stock and put a lid on the pan and cooked till the chard was wilted and most of the liquid was absorbed. I then sprinkled in some smoked sea salt and fresh ground pepper and tossed the chard mixture with some freshly cooked whole grain fusilli pasta and topped with goat's cheese. C'est fini and a lot less oil and work!

Rating: 4
Great recipe, just don't use that much oil! I'd even cut back a bit on the fennel next time, maybe 3/4 tsp. Also, I pressed the chard in the colander and gave the beans lots of time to drain, which I think helped stop this dish from getting soupy. I'd definitely make this again, and would probably throw in some bacon or mortadella.

Delicious. I made this mostly according to the recipe--as others have, I cut the amount of oil in the roasted chickpeas way back. Because I made this for 2 people (3 servings), I scaled down the recipe to use 1 can of chickpeas (about 1.5 cups as measured), 1/4 cup olive oil, 2 bay leaves, 5 garlic cloves, and i large shallots. I did use a large bunch of chard, trimming the stems, measured at around 8 cups chopped raw, so it is possible that I used a bit more chard relative to chickpeas. as someone else advised, I finished the chickpea mixture with the foil off for 10 minutes, to slightly caramelize the mixture. I served it over chinese black rice (meant to use regular brown rice, but didn't have any), with a tablespoon of crumbled feta. The only thing I added was about 1/2 tsp lemon zest, which you can't really taste but adds some brightness to the chard. This really was good. Husband who is suspicious of vegetarian main dishes was converted.

Rating: 3
Great for vegetarian night as a main for 3 to 4 people when served with crusty bread. Made almost as directed, but the recipe seemed a bit excessive with the olive oil. I cut the chickpea bake to 3/4 a cup and used a minimal amount on the shallot/chard part. From suggestions here, there was salty feta and a nice balsamic on the table for topping if desired - both great additions. Didn't totally knock my socks off, but will add to the rotation as a quick, pretty healthy (watch the oil!) weeknight meal.

I would be vegetarian if I could eat roasted garbanzos every day. I braised in water since I didn't have stock which was fine. Then I added some curry powder, garam masala, and tumeric to the chard. I didn't stir the garbanzo beans in to the chard but put it on top since it made for a better presentation. Also keeps the chickpeas nice and toasty. Really good weeknight dish. YUM

I didn't like this at all. To me it tasted like greasy chickpeas with chard. I drained the olive oil and used only 1 tbsp of it for the final step, yet the tezture was still too greasy for me. The bay leaves, shallots and garlic all seemed to have lost their flavor. Also I felt like it needed something else -- maybe a thicker sauce and served over rice, quinoa or some other grain. I probably won't revisit this one though.

Rating: 4
Wonderful! Definitely more than the sum of it's humble parts. I did cut the olive oil down significantly. And really...please don't drain the chard...remove the lid, raise the heat and reduce the chicken broth until the liquid has almost totally evaportated. This makes a lovely, rich sauce...and all those great vitamins don't go down the drain.

Very tasty. I halved the recipe. I didn't have shallots handy so I used onion instead, which worked fine. Tossed in about 1/2 tsp of chili flakes near the end. As someone else has noted, it would probably benefit from a squeeze of lemon before serving. The bay leaves make up a good part of the flavor profile but unfortunately I'm not a big bay leaf fan. Next time I'll probably use only 1/2 or replace them altogether with maybe some rosemary? For the last 10 minutes of roasting the garbanzos I removed the cover to get them a little more crispy. They were perfect.

This was a surprisingly tasty recipe! I used less olive oil in the chickpeas than called for and substituted garlic scapes for half the garlic. I also thought the recipe could benefit from a bit more chard. Serve this sucker up with some roast vegetable (I used eggplant and zucchini) and wild rice pilaf and a crunchy green salad, and you have an incredibly flavorful meatless meal.

After draining the garbanzo mixture I put it back in the dish and broiled it for about 10 minutes  it caramelized the beans, shallots and garlic beautifully. I also drizzled a small tablespoon of balsamic vinegar over the finished dish it added a very nice touch of acidity, which offset the sweetness of the beans and onions and the smokiness of the chard. If Id had lemon I am sure it would have done nicely too. It was a wonderful dish, we sopped up all the caramelized bits and oil with French bread,

We did strictly adhere to the recipe : we only tossed the garbanzo beans with a couple of tablespoons of oil, used tender, stalky 'blettes' instead of swiss chard, and only used about 3/4 cup of broth, which we didn't drain.

We'll definitely make it again, and next time we'll try following the recipe more closely :)

I'll be pleased to try this, as I have some chard growing in my garden right now! NOTE: I had never cooked chard until last year, and read that unless chard is very fresh that it can be very bitter.

I also used the reserved oil as part of a salad dressing last night, which was nice because of the infused chickpea flavor.
