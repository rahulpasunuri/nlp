I renamed this the 5 Hour Chocolate Tart. It really takes a good deal of planning, but the expression on my guests' faces was worth it! The crust could have used more moisture as it didn't roll out, so I made it a pressed "rustic" crust. Wasn't sure if the "vegan" or "dairy-free" carob chips I found would melt the same way, so I substituted the same amount of semi-sweet chips. Finally, I didn't make the brittle, but used Heath toffee pieces (found next to chocolate chips in the baking aisle). The more the better! The salty crunch really paired well with the rich sweetness of the chocolate filling. Use a foil covered cookie sheet under the tart pan when baking the crust since the butter seems to leak out a bit. Other than that...SO WORTH IT! I will absolutely be making it again!

bit on the fancy side for my tastes

great results, all who tried it raved about how good it tasted. The brittle adds a nice touch but is not necessary to enjoy the dessert.
