This recipe was OK.It was not cloyingly sweet like some pecan recipes, but it was not particularly outstanding either. If I were to make it again, I think I would stick with bittersweet chocolate, and only dark corn syrup. The biggest dud of the recipe was the crème fraishe topping. It had absolutely no character at all. Perhaps some vanilla or cinnamon. I don't know what, but it didn't work for me as is.

wow!!!!! This is fantastic!! Served this at Christmas dinner.....everyone loved it. The crust was so easy to make, and I froze the other half. this is definitely a "keeper" recipe.

This was amazing and so easy to make, even my older brother (who is seventeen and normally picky and critical) loved it! And to the people who completely change the recipe and then wonder why it doesn't taste good...do you see the correlation between altering a recipe you've never tried before and getting bad results?

This was amazing! I even made the dough (I am not a baker so normally avoid this part), but it proved to be extremely simple (and tasty). It tasted as good as it looked, it was gone quick! I didn't make any alterations, follow exactly, and it was superb!

This recipe was delicious! Everyone at the Thanksgiving table loved it. The darker chocolate was a nice addition to the pecans. Unlike some other reviewers, I did not have any issue with the amount of filling or the oiliness of the pecans. I did not change the recipe at all and had no problem with the sweetness. The only disappointing part of the recipe was the whipped cream, which was just okay. Next time, I think that I will use a different whipped cream recipe.

This was absolutely delicious. It was also very straightforward to make and I will definitely make it again, soon if my family has a say. My one question to others - I found that a large amount of the filling bubbled over (and consequently out of ) the tart. Since I've had a small amount do that with other pecan pie recipes, I did have a cookie sheet on the lower shelf, so it wasn't too much mess, but I suspect the pie would have been even better with more of the filling (though chocolate and pecan and butter crust was scrumptious). I used my standard tart pan with removable bottom (11 inch). I have deeper pans, but not with removable bottom. Any advice?

I tried this for Thanksgiving and it was great. The recipe was easy to follow. I toasted the pecans before use and it enriched the flavors. I did modify the cream adding some confectioners sugar and only 1 tablespoon of rum rather than the 2 tablespoons of bourbon.

A little of this decadent pie goes a long way. Instead of cutting the sugar, as another reviewer has said, we just served it in slivers. The premium bitter dark chocolate was a good foil to the sweet (overly?) goo that bound the chewy roasted oily pecans together. It is an easy and fairly quick recipe.

Pretty disappointing. Usually I make a pecan pumpkin pie, but thought this would be good, as lots of chocolate lovers in family. I cut the sugar and corn syrups some as amounts looked out of proportion, but just cloyingly sweet. As well the chocolate did not thoroughly melt and some parts had little chocolate. If I did try to make this again, it would be with no more than half the sugar.
