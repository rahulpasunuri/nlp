Awesome simple recipe. I used dijion and added tsp creamed horseradish. Potatoes crisp,fish moist and flaky, super flavours. Served it with a fine diced greek salad almost as a relish. With that acid balance on the plate it all came together.

I can see both the negative and positive views of this recipe. The flavors are not distinctly different -- that would be unlikely when using the same sauce for both potatoes and a white fish -- but the combination of potatoes, cod, and mustard is so natural that it's hard to argue with. I think the slicing of the potatoes is crucial -- thin enough so that they brown and crisp slightly, but not so thin that they become chips. A mandoline is good here and should be mentioned in the recipe. Similarly, the heat of the oven and the timing can make all the difference. It's a recipe that needs to be followed pretty much to the letter. The recipe also ignores the fact that you need a large sheet pan (maybe two!) to cook all these slices in one layer. For the record, I too used dijon and grated horseradish into it. I also used some baby arugula as a base for both, and I think it was a plus -- certainly visually for this very pale meal.

The sauce is decent - nothing to rave about. The potatoes turned out wonderful - loved the crispness, creaminess and spice. But the cod simply did not work with this combo - I strongly disliked how the flavors were exactly the same on both, and offered no contrast. Plus, the mayo-heavy sauce did not kick the boring cod up at all - this was a big miss. Make the potatoes, do a spice rub on a different more flavorful fish, and make a much better dish.

It was too much of the same flavor. We liked the sauce on the fish better than on the potatoes. Next time I will add some extra horseradish as it needed a little more kick and I will make the potatoes a different way.

This was delicious and presented beautifully. It disappeared almost magically, even for the picky eaters!

We tripled this recipe for our family and EVERYONE loved it...even my "fish is NOT my favorite thing" father-in-law! It is extraordinarily simple and very flavorful. We prepared the dish in a cast iron skillet (Large) and baked the potatoes three times as long due to the quantity. We finished with a broil to crisp the top of the fish. We look forward to adding this to our menu rotation.

Mixed feelings about this one. The cod came out perfectly, the sauce was tasty (I used Wegmans Horseradish Mustard and added another tablespoon to the mix. Also used Helman's light Mayonnaise). The potatoes...eh. I think I expected them to be more roasted. They were good but I think next time I'd make them chunky and roast them at a higher temp. I also will do the fish and potatoes on different sheets next time.

easy, good, tastes extra rich. Haddock is really cheap right now, so I like it instead of cod and I cook the potatoes separately...just didn't have room for both on one cookie sheet.

Considering that this dish requires almost no work, it's amazing. The fish is flaky and moist, the potatoes are salty and crunch and it's just really satisfying. The whole thing took about 30 minutes, including prep. I will definitely be making this again.

This was good but not great. I used Wasabi mayonnaise and regular Dijon mustard since that was what I had. The coating seemed a bit runny and while it had a nice flavor, I think it would have been better if you coated the fish with it earlier, more like a marinade, and let it sit for an hour or so in the mustard 'sauce' before baking it or maybe pan-frying it for a little better crust on the fish.

Excellent; easy; quick. We have lots of fresh cod up here in BC and I get tired of making it the same way, so this was a nice change. We used "green Maille dijon" for this, and added the horseradish into it. This is the perfect lighter version of fish'n'chips.

This was really very good although I also did not have the horseradish mustard called for. I used a coarse brown mustard and grated horseradish; eastern potatoes sliced with my mandoline and reconstituted lemon juice. It's difficult to fit the potatoes on half a sheet when they are that thin so I started them out ahead- the only difference I see is in the ease of timing the whole meal- not a big deal. The potatoes browned nicely and were like a scalloped potato with a bite. The cod was tasty too- it is a favorite fish of ours so hard to go wrong there. All in all it couldn't be easier and I will definitely make it again.

Very tasty. I used Yukon Gold potatos, because that's what I had, and added fresh asparagus, as a previous user suggested. Grey Poupon makes a horseradish "Deli Mustard" that has wine & horseradish in it.. so that's what went into my dish. I was going to add a finely sliced shallot, but ended up forgetting it after slicing all those little potatos by hand, but I think it will work well and will try that nexttime. The boyfriend who only eats fish because it's good for him proclaimed this "very edible". A definite keeper.

Delicious and easy. Followed recipe exactly but added coated fresh asparagus along with potatoes for "one dish meal." I did use a silicone sheet on rimmed cookie sheet. I'll be making this again.

I cut the potatos too thin and toasted many of them into potato chips. I used Coleman's horseradish (UK) from my wife's shoppe and halved the Dijon, which worked well. Easy to make and a nice weeknight meal as advertised.

A definite keeper! Easy too.

I didn't have horseradish dijon mustard, so I subbed horseradish and dijon mustard together. I thought this was delicious, but a little bit heavy... I couldn't finish it. It's very important to slice the potatoes very thin, and I feel like maybe some broth or something could be used to thin out the sauce.

I did not have horseradish dijon mustard on hand so I used dijon, low-fat mayo, with 1 teaspoon of wasabi powder (could have stood to use more). Thought this was very good, especially potatoes, and would make this again. This was very easy for a weeknight meal. We are always trying to find more ways to get fish into our diet on a regular basis.

Add some thinly sliced onions.

Actually 2.5 forks. 4 forks on the potatoes, they were great, will make again on own. The fish was pretty good. After dinner, I wondered when I was supposed to add the horseradish, the ingredient that attracted me to this recipe in the first place. I didn't notice the recipe called for dijon with horseradish. Do they actually make dijon with horseradish, I have never seen it? The fish was good, but my grocery didn't have cod, so I used Red Grouper, which I found out after purchase is a no no because of mercury content. Why do stores keep selling these tainted fish (shark, swordfish, grouper, mackeral etc)

My husband made this for a weeknight dinner. It was fast and easy, he said. The potatoes were phenomenal, I could have eaten an entire plate full. What a great way to prepare them (easy with the mandoline). Will definitely make the potatoes again. The fish, however, was just so-so. I think chicken might actually work better here.

Easy to do, good week night dinner. Used regular mayonnaise this time but will try it with the low-fat stuff next time. Would definitely make it again.
