I like this recipe, but I think Chef Johanne Killen's of Alforno Restaurant in Providence, RI, is superior. She uses a mix of sweet and spicy sausage, butter instead of olive oil and 2 tablespoons chianti and 1 1/2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar instead of the 1/4 cup balsamic called for in this recipe.

This is a staple meal in our house. Everyone loves it - even my four year old. It's great for just a family meal, and perfect for guests too as it looks lovely. It couldn't be easier. We serve it over quinoa and use spicy turkey italian sausage.

You know, it's really quite good. I never thought of cooked grapes before, but they were really good. Made with red grapes and Aidell's Chicken Andouille.

I made this with Adele's Chicken Portobella Sausage and it got rave reviews from our family and friends, who eat lower fat sausages. We served it with wilted Chard.

I really wanted to love this, it is simple and intriguing. It didn't quite rise above it's ingredients. It was fun to eat, because it is a little different, but I won't make it again.

It wasn't as delicious as I thought it would be, but it was okay. It reminds me of a sausage and fig recipe that takes far more time, but is much more yummier. Not bad for a quick dinner, though.

A truly remarkable recipe - the synergy between the sausages and grapes is amazing - each is changed by the other, and both are marvelous. I used crimson grapes, and Berkeley Bowl mild Italian sausages. Even with a cheapo balsamic, this was a wonderful dish. I've made it several times, and it's been a hit with everyone who tried it - including the ones usually avoid sausages. A real winner!

Love Italian Sausage but think the old tried and true combination of peppers and onions is a better fit.

My health conscious BF would freak if I made sweet italian sausage as an entree -- too fatty. I used a package of Adele's chicken and portobello mushroom sausage, which is much much lower in fat and carbs. He adored it and cleaned the plate -- excellent flavor combo. I even made the suggested greens as a side, using a bag of freshly washed chard from the produce aisle. The pan of drippings from the entree was nearly sufficient to wilt the greens -- I added a few shallots and a few ice cubes of chicken broth (I keep a can frozen in an ice cube tray for quick stir fry use) The drippings plus a cube or two of broth was enough to wilt the bag of chard and shallots, and the entire plate was devoured. Quite good. Excellent recipe for a weeknight when you're tempted to buy out or defrost.

I was concerned that this recipe was too simple to be good. I'm happy to say I was wrong. The combination of flavors was delicious. I used extra balsamic vinegar and cooked the dish a little longer to reduce it a bit to enhance the flavor. I also used Hungarian sausage. A great work night dish.

I saw the rave reviews and wondered could sausage, grapes and balsamic vinegar really make such a fantastic dish? To my pleasant surprise, it really does! My fiance and I loved the flavors of this dish and are planning on making it again for a quick and easy dinner with friends. Since there are so few ingredients, make certain to use top-quality everything. We used a really good balsamic vinegar from Modena, juicy and sweet red grapes and local fresh sausage. Quite delicious and worth a try.

Rather one dimensional. Nothing special. Made this with polenta and garlic spinach. Wouldn't make it again.

Although my husband is an adventurous eater, he wasn't interested in the thought of Italian sausage with red grapes. And I was sure that he would like it. I, too, added sliced red onion, and green,yellow, and red (all three) bell pepper. He was surprised that he enjoyed this dish so much and definitely wants to have it again.

This recipe is so simple to prepare and the ingredients are things we normally have on hand. I used chicken sausage, and it wasn't hindered at all. It will definitely be put into rotation!

All I can say is wow! This was very delicious and so quick and easy to prepare - a big hit on all fronts. Great for dinner, but it would also work well for brunch.

Very easy and very good. The red grapes and sausages made a nice and unexpected combination. I served it with roasted parmesan potatoes and spinach sauteed with garlic.

We really enjoyed this dish. I served it over polenta and a bed of sauteed spinach. With these additions, it gave the dish a multi-level of flavors. This is a wonderful late fall dish.

Great taste, quick to make, since I cook for two or one most of the time I made some changes. 1 T Olive oil, 1/2 lb Hot Italian sausage (cut to 4), 1/4lb Green/Red/Yellow pepper, 1/4lb Red Onion both cut in long strips, 1/2lb Red grapes, 3T Balsamic vinegar, 1/8 t of salt & black pepper each. Cooking done in 20 minutes.

This was really easy and very good. Picky kids even ate it. I used spicy sausage links and I was pretty far down the road on preparation of this when I discovered that I was out of balsamic vinegar. So I added a splash of Newman's Own Balsamic Vinaigrette salad dressing instead. I also tossed in some sliced onions with the grapes per someone else's suggestion. I served it with Pasta Roni Garlic & Olive Oil Vermicelli. So quick & easy and very tasty.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe very much. It's both very quick and very easy. Perfect for a weeknight dinner.

We used a mix of sausages that worked---the grapes held up and added a nice contrast to taste and presentation---next time will use less balsamic--the salad was a perfect partner--- red wine, fire in the fireplace---perfect meal for the Mts in the fall

The moment I saw this recipe I had an ah-ha moment. This was perfect for the smoked venison sausage in my freezer. It is highly seasoned but the small amount of added pork make it quite dry unless prepared quickly. It turned out great and the recipe will go to all my husband's hunting buddies.

This was a very easy and quick dish. Great for weekday dinners.

I would make this dish again, but I would use less olive oil when browning the sausages, and I would add onions and sliced red peppers with the grapes for some crunch.

I made this recipe. I used half sweet Italian sausages and half jalapeno cheddar sausages. I also sauteed some chopped onions along with the sausages. The onion adds a some needed aromatic and sweetness factor, IMO. The jalapeno cheddar sausages also add interest. I found that using a bit more than the recommended amount of balsamic vinegar would brighten this recipe more. Next time, I would skim off some of the fat form the sausages before adding the grapes and balsamic vinegar. The fat prevented the vinegar from really clinging to the ingredients.

I made this dish again after seeing this recipe...I saw it years ago on a TV show and lost the exact measurements. It was great then, and great now. I deglazed the pan with a bit of red wine which really perked up the flavor.

What an amazing recipe! I love Italian sausage especially in Sausage, Peppers, and Onions. This is a wonderful and inventive new way to mix the spicy with the sweet. Yum!
