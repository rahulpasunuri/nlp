These cookies are delicious!! My guest raved about them, too. I found them when searching for a way to use the jam I had made from some a small batch of blackberries picked and frozen a while back. That was easy, too. Puree, strain seeds out over small saucepan, then cook with sugar, and stir in water/cornstarch mix to thicken. Perfect use. I chopped the walnuts in the mini processor, just a few pulses, and they were just lightly toasted in the oven. Friends (and I) felt they'd be even better and go farther if made smaller (maybe 30 cookies per batch). But even as is - wonderful!!

A yummy and attractive cookie for not too much work. Next time I would follow the size recommendation and avoid the temptation to make bigger cookies, as they're so rich in flavor that the large ones were like a whole dessert.

I got good reviews on this cookie. Albeit some people found the taste rather strange. It is not your typical cookie and even though I don't like sugary cookies I would use more sugar next time and skipped the toasted part. I think regular walnuts would be better. They are awesome with coffee/tea.

This was so easy to make and the presentation was gorgeous. It was a real hit with my guests. Also you can potentially make these even more in advance since I found they had kept really well for almost a week. The only thing I'd do differently next time is chill the dough before I start rolling them into cookies - they flattened out a bit in the oven.

I made these with toasted pecans and they were very good. Much easier recipe than the labor intensive hazelnut linzer cookies on this site. I bought the blackberry jam thinking I would make those, but switched to this recipe because it looked so easy. Glad I did, not sure all of the additional ingredients would have made a difference.

These cookies are great and even got rave reviews from a very picky eater in my family. I found that they were better when they were 2 days old, the shortbread part got nice and moist.

Truly delicious cookie. I used a thick strawberry jam, which worked well, too. The toasted walnut flavor was phenomenal. My guests' reactions were all the same..each took a bite, paused, smiled and said something along the lines of "wow, these cookies are delicious!." Each wanted to take some home with them. As my husband said, he likes a cookie that has flavor...and this one does.
