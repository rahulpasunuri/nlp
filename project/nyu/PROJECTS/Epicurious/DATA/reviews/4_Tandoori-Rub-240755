Haven't gotten to cook with it yet (that's tomorrow night), but I just put it together and did a fingertip-taste test. Fantastic. I did accidentally double the black pepper, so I doubled the sugar and left the Cayenne out. Still wonderful, and I'm sure it'll be even better the next time I make it and get my measurements right. ^_^

This is a great spice rub to have around the house premade. I have used it on several different occasions. For a roasted chicken, I combine about 2 tablespoons of the rub, with 2 tablespoons butter and rubbed it under the skin of a chicken. I have also made a paste with the rub and yogurt to marinate chicken breasts. Yum!

Tandoori rub is great for vegetable , being a vegetarian I use it a lot for eggplant, zucchini, potatoes. I am cook for my friends so i have found that it also works great on seafood of your choice.The way I do it is I add a couple tablespoons of plain yogurt and mix it with the rub and let your seafood, poultry, meat or vegetable marinate in it for at least 2 hours. Enjoy.

I received this rub as a gift, and tried it last night on a roast turkey. WOW. It was wonderful. What an aroma, and delicious flavor! I am so glad I located the recipe!
