My husband and I liked this recipe for the bright,fresh lemony taste. I served it with grilled salmon. A great go-together dish.

This was a wonderful side dish to a spicy pork dish. It had a light lemon flavor, so I added a bit more lemon juice than was called for (not sure exactly how much though!) We will definately make this dish again!

A very pleasant and easy way to make couscous. It's bright lemon flavour helped to offset the sweetness of the moroccan chicken dish I served with it. This was an excellent buffet dish as well.
