I used parts of the chicken already cut up (thighs/drumsticks and breasts) and rubbed the paste on and under the skin which included a clove of garlic made into a paste. Also, I cut down the amount of salt to 1/2 tsp. I did as suggested by another review and added 1 tea bag of mint tea because I didn't have the mint on hand. Also, I didn't add the extra 6 garlic cloves 2 lemons. The dish still came out wonderful and will add to my favorites.

Great recipe. It became a staple at my house after the first time I made it. I use my own Ras El Hanout after I googled it and made my own. I've never made it with mint - I am sure it is good too, but I never had any ready. So if this is the only ingredient missing don't worry. The dish is awesome. The only thing I cannot do is ever fit two lemons into the cavity lol. It is fine with just one.

Excellent recipe, no changes needed! This is a staple in our house. This is quite authentic, too - I lived in Morocco for a long time and know Moroccan food well. This is not as intimidating as it looks, just take 10 minutes to make your own ras al hanout with spices you've probably got on hand already and you're good to go. I often use mint from a cut-open peppermint tea bag if I don't have fresh, works just as well (I put in the whole tea bag's worth). Serve with crusty bread and, for a truly Moroccan meal, french fries. Weird sounding, I know, but it's how they serve a whole roast chicken like this.

This was delicious and easy. Suggest not cheaping out on the ras-el-hanout - if you can't get a quality one like Crousset or Philippe de Vienne, make your own (the cheaper ones taste like floor sweepings and the bird will be so-so). I like the idea of freezing the rub in batches - will do this and experiment on week-night meals.

I used this recipe on a 3.5 lb chicken and it turned out beautifully. Certainly to be made again.

Wonderful weeknight meal. I didn't have a whole chicken, so I used leg quarters. I was able to find Ras el Hanout at my local spice market. Curious to try this on the grill.

Absolutely delicious. My man and I have been making sandwiches (good with ras-el-hanout aioli!) and salads with the left overs, and it just keeps tasting super delicious. The lemon provides a nice balance with the strong seasonings, so it's tasty hot or cold. A few modifications (of course) - I'm addicted to vertical roasters, so I wedged the lemon and the garlic in there and just squeezed the second lemon's juice into the vertical roaster's reservoir. I also cooked for longer at a lower temperature (but that's mostly because I suspect my oven is wonky at high settings).

This is a great recipe. I make the rub ahead of time (multiple batches). Freeze in silicon muffin tins, pop them out once frozen and vacuum individual portions in freezer bags. Having the rub on hand is great for unexpected guests or a quickly put together meal. I simply need to do the final prep and only need garlic, lemon and chicken on hand.

This is an OH MY GOD! recipe! Don't be put off by making the Ras el hanout! It'll take about 5 minutes and the spices are probably something you have already! I made this recipe EXACTLY as written (That NEVER happens) and I'm not going to play with it! I did make basmati rice and added some currants and some of the ras el hanout to the rice (with chk broth). Let's say it was gone in a day (only 2 of us!).

This chicken is not as daunting as the recipe sounds. I highly suggest making the Ras el hanout from the 4 fork recipe as other reviewers had recommended. Quite easy and most of the spices are already on hand. Also, I only had cuban mint on hand and it worked just as well, maybe even better. This recipe is a definite keeper!

Awesome recipe! Made my own ras el hanout from bon appetit archive. Used cubed organic chicken breasts that I allowed to marinate for a few hours. Then placed on skewers, with half a wedge of lemon. Cooking time was 4 minutes per side on medium high grill. Family and friends loved this!

I make this for friends on Valentine's day, and it was definitely enjoyed. We picked the carcass clean! I bought ras-el-hanout from Kalustyan's in NYC (but if you live somewhere more rural, they have an online store too). I don't have a food processor, so I just finely minced everything that wasn't a powder already and then mixed them, which worked fine. Like another reviewer, I pushed some spice under the skin for those who don't like to eat the skin. My 4.5lb chicken took an hour and 15 minutes rather than an hour and a half, and it was tender and moist. All in all, it was pretty easy and really tasty.

Very tasty, I made the ras-el-hanout from the recipe on this site, easy to do. I saved some of the rub, and used it on shrimp for the vegetarian in the group- what a hit both chicken and shrimp were with these flavors!

AWESOME!!!!Normally if I'm going to cook a whole chicken our favorite way is to rotisserie it. It just consistently always turns out crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, but this recipe equals it in texture, flavor, juiciness, crispiness and even easier to do. The whole family loved it. I followed the recipe exactly as instructed and even made my own spice from scratch. Enjoy!

This is the best roast chicken ever! I make it all the time and it never gets old. It's worth it to make the spice from scratch (you can get the recipe for it on here). Makes a great broth afterward too!

Rating: 4
WOW! This was just amazing! I also left away the mint, but chopped up lots of fresh parsley, which I also sprinkled on top of the chicken. I also wrapped the "poked" lemon in the leftover parsley twigs and put about 1/4c white wine in the bottom of the roasting dish along with some bigger carrot and ginger pieces, making a nice sauce to the chicken. I served it with some simple instant couscous made with vegetable broth, with roasted carrot and zucchini, chopped parsley and a hint of cinnamon in it (next time I will also add some raisins). It was the perfect moroccan dish! I will definitely make this again and again!!

Rating: 4
Very much like a charmoula, the spice paste is redolent with so many of our favorite flavors. I like to roast pan vegetables with my chicken, so I added quartered onions, diagonally sliced 1" carrot pieces, and quartered russet potatoes. I also made my own ras el hanout, with enough left over for trying this dish again tonight. A perfect sunday night supper.

Rating: 4
We skipped the mint, which I think worked well. Also, might be too lemony with the main cavity lemons. A great chicken. The Ras-el-hanout left a lingering and velvety mouthfeel. Maybe less salt in the marinade to offset the Ras and the Paprika. We will definitely make this again!

can anyone suggest a good wine to go with this dish?

Used ras-el-hanout we had around. Taste was great, but the method of cooking the chicken isn't -- our bird wasn't organic, nor very good, so the chicken was dry & uninteresting. Therefore, unless you are using a fantastic chicken, I would instead make recipe #233958 Leuzzi's chicken (maybe with a little of this marinade).

Rating: 4
Wonderfully fragrant, and very tasty! Remove the fat, and the remaining chicken juices make a delicious sauce. Find a good Ras el Hanout blend with 20+ spices. It's worth the additional effort. The flavour mix is phenomenal! I will definitely make this over and over again.

This rub is fantastic.It is equally delicious on pork,lamb and fish.I stuff the cavity with a dried fruit and nut couscous.Plug the cavity with half a lemon to keep the couscous in place. Sprinkle chopped cilantro or parsley on couscous when serving. The flavours are truly devine!

This tasted good and was extremely fragrant while it was cooking. Even my picky child liked it (with the skin removed). I added halved yukon gold potatoes and sweet onions to the roasting pan and kept basting them every time I checked on the chicken. I kept adding some water to the bottom of the roasting pan to keep the drippings from getting dry. Next time I will try it with fresh cilantro, as recommended by another reviewer.

After a scavenger hunt to two Middle Eastern markets and Whole Foods, I combined the two recipes for ras el hanout and made my own. We don't eat the chicken skin so I pushed the spice paste underneath the skin before roasting and the meat was pungent with lemons. Also added chunky red and yellow peppers, onions, zucchini and carrots to the pan and basted with chicken stock to keep them moist. It came out wonderfully. My husband rated it "8.5 and a definite repeat." High praise.

Delicious. I used the recipe for moroccan spice mix I foud on this website. There are two. I used the one that DID NOT have the nutmeg. I chose based on the spices I had on hand, so, because I only had nutmed nuts and not ground nutmeg, I didn't want to spend the time to grate it and I used the other recipe. I also subbed fresh cilantro for the mint. Didn't have any mint again. Anyway, everyone loved it and I'm thinking of outting the spice paste on the Thanksgiving turkey next week. THe chicken was succulent. Oh yea, and instead of lemons I had to use limes.

I made this for, of all things, Christmas dinner and it was a hit. Absolutely wonderful flavor and juicy. I added halved red potatoes to the roasting pan and they turned out perfectly. As far as the ras-el-hanout, I made a hybrid from several recipes I found and it turnd out very nicely. I can't wait to cook this again.

Made this "update" instead of an older Moroccan chicken recipe I hadn't made in a long time. This will be the new standard, and will be a regular again! We have a large Middle Eastern population here, but I made the Ras El Hanout mentioned in other reviews instead of looking for it, and it was just fine. (I'll be trying the leftovers in the Cinnamon Chicken with Coucous and Dried Fruit recipe tonight)

I have made this recipe several times already, and everybody loves it. I use limes instead of lemons and a complexer ras el hanout. It goes with all kinds of chicken, whatever the conditions it was raised in! The advantage of a "naturally" raised chicken, however, is its looser skin, making it easier to insert the marinade between the flesh and the skin.

Like many others, I looked up a recipe for ras-el-hanout and made my own. It wasn't hard and was worth the effort. I put potatoes, carrots and zucchini in the bottom of the pan to roast with the chicken and they all turned out wonderfully. I made stock with the carcass and the scrapings from the bottom of the roasting pan. The stock has a very distinct lemon and spice flavor and is great for chicken dumpling or matzo ball soup.

Rating: 3
Very very good. A recipie that gives a great complex taste to a roast chicken and is very easy. A bit salty, which I found nice, but possibly too much if you are sensitive. I'd recommend buying ras el hanout if you can, since ready made mixes contain far more spices (not all essential... but they add something) than you could reasonably mix at home.

I made my own ras-el-hanout, and found it to be mediocre. I was able to make the internet recipe I found from spices I had. It did not call for whole spices to grind up or anything too exotic.I knew this could not be right,because it was easy and not time consuming at all, as other writers had said it would be. Can someone supply a better recipe ? My chicken was good, nonetheless!

I looked up Ras el hamout on the internet and found that quite a variety of ingredients can/do go into this spice mixture.

Oh! The smell of the house after this one was to continue savoring the meal! Ras el hanout was impossible to come by in Cleveland. Going through the hassle of making it from scratch was SO worth the effort. I will now keep this spice on hand and have tried other recipes on Epicurious using it. I might have been able to eat the whole chicken myself. This recipe will now be in my permanent entertaining bag of tricks.

I am living in Morocco and made this recipe for Moroccan guests. They all raved about it and asked how I learned to cook Moroccan-style so quickly. Actually, I already had all of the ingredients to make Ras al-hanout in my kitchen, so don't be intimidated by the name. (I looked it up on Epicurious.) Next time, I will try the local spice vendor and see if it makes any difference. Loved it and would recommended the recipe to anyone who loves chicken.

Just fixed this yummy dish tonight! We live in a town population around 50,000 and have no middle eastern markets. I found on line the ingredients for ras-el-hanout: Whole spices or seeds should be toasted in a dry frying pan till fragrant then cooled before running through a spice (coffee)mill. 20 saffron threads 1 3" cinnamon stick or 1 tsp ground 1 whole nutmeg or 2 tsp ground 2 tsp black peppercorns 1 1/2 tsp blade mace or ground (couldn't find, didn't matter) 2 tsp cardamom seeds or 1/1/2 tsp ground 2 tsp ground ginger 1 tsp ground turmeric 1 T allspice berries or 1 1/4 tsp ground This done tonight for me and my husband, next time for company!!

This was delicious! The whole family really loved it- it was moist, flavorful and smelled wonderful.
