I added two-thirds cup sharp cheddar cheese and upped the cornmeal by a couple of tablespoons. It was great. The cheese was barely discernible, so I will try adding a bit more next time.

I bake bread regularly - but this one is a winner. Amazing stuff. This is the best bread recipe I've come across. Tonight I ate left over eggplant curry with this and it was heavenly. From now on this will be my standard bread recipe. Wonder how this will work in a bread making machine.

Delicious and tender. This bread has a nice texture and is great with soup or potage.

I'VE BEEN MAKING BREAD FOR 25 YEARS. THIS BREAD IS VERY TASTY. THE CORNMEAL INTRIGUED ME. I'M GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER PIECE NOW. YUM YUM

This is a lovely bread. Just made it today...a very blustery spring afternoon, in need of comfort food. Served it with corn & clam chowder for a very easy dinner.

This was so easy and so good. No changes to recipe. I'll be making many more times.
