The sauce gets 4 forks. As recommended by other reviewers, I doubled the tomatoes and added red wine and brown sugar. Awesome! TRhe lasagne overall was a 3 fork. Good, not outstanding. In the future I'll make the sauce to serve with other pasta dishes.

I made this but instead of lasagne noodles I substituted spinach leaves- it was AMAZING!!! I will definitely use this recipe again, as everyone loved it!

Fantastic recipe. I took advise from other reviewers by adding 1T brown sugar and a few glugs of dry red wine. I also used half smoked mozzarella and half smoked provolone. WOW...just like my favorite italian joint used to make.

I always feel odd reviewing a recipe I've altered, but this was too good not to. Used half sweet and half italian sausage. I would suggest increasing both the sauce and the cheese by 1 1/2, because after layering I only had about 2 layers of noodles. I also used speck instead of prosciutto, to add to the smokiness, and simply layered the slices on top of the sauce, instead of choppping them up. And, for a final smoke addition, used diced fire-roasted tomatoes. It all turned out wonderfully rich with a winter warming quality. Next time I think I'll add some dry red wine to the sauce.

I made this lasagna exactly per the recipe. The smokey flavor was really good. So much better than the standard hamburger lasagna. My wife and 14 year old son gave it a thumbs up. This is a keeper in our household.

This is one of the best lasagna recipes ever! As others suggested I made 1.5 times the sauce, and also used half sweet and half hot Italian sausages. This makes a lasagna with distinctive flavors that you will want to make again and again.

A delicious recipe. The sauce is thick and hearty and the cheese mixture is rich and creamy. The added egg holds the cheese together nicely and the sausage and prosciutto is a nice change from traditional hamburger.

Best lasagna I have ever tasted - loved the smoky flavor the mozzarella added. I used pancetta instead of proscuitto since Trader Joe's sells it pre-diced and it made things easier. I also used Maldon smoked sea salt for seasoning as I thought that would be a better match for the dish. I don't generally like celery, but I chopped it small and it added great texture to the sauce. I liked that there wasn't an overload of ricotta, just enough. Can't wait for leftovers tonight!

I will definitely be making this lasagna again. My changes were that I added a red pepper, I used no-boil noodles, and I used chicken Italian sweet sausages, as opposed to pork. It was absolutely DELICIOUS and made the whole house smell of sausage and smokey mozzarella. I think this will be my go-to lasagna recipe for a while. YUM YUM YUM.

This was good, but I agree with others that this isn't anything to rave about. Full disclosure: used a can of diced tomatoes rather than full tomatoes subsequently chopped, and used smoked provolone instead of smoked mozzarella. I think I agree with everyone else that you need to load up on the sauce -- between 1.5x and 2x as set out in the recipe. The celery (which has caused some dissent in prior posts) was fine in the dish. For me, if I were doing this again, I'd throw in some dried porcini (soaked for 15 minutes in hot water) to round out the smoky nature of the dish. I liked the dish but it doesn't get the four fork WOW factor that, for example, the Turkey-Sausage Spicy Lasagne gets, being a way-out awesome lasagne dish.

Rating: 3
A homey, yummy dish that works for company. I used mild Italian chicken sausages, which didn't crumble as much into the sauce as pork sausage might have. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. The ratio of sauce and cheese was perfect. The prep was easy and I loved being able to make it in advance so that there was time to tidy the kitchen before guests arrived. Leftovers were fabulous.

Rating: 2
This is ok, not great. I made about 1 1/2 times the sauce which I thought was the best component of the dish. The smoked Mozz did not add as much depth to the dish as I expected. I actually prefer my own family lasagna recipe. I am glad I tested it and I am pleased that I make such a fantastic lasagna from scratch without a recipe.

Delicious Lasagna. The smoked mozzarella and prosciutto add so much flavor. This is not a really saucy lasagna so if you want it a little saucier, I would use more tomatos and juice.

Rating: 4
There's a reason this guy gets four forks pretty much throughout. As is it's amazing. I do 1/2 sweet Italian and 1/2 hot Italian sausage, add basil leaves in between the layers, and use homemade summertime tomato sauce in the lasagna and on the side to drizzle some on top of servings. The smoked moz gives this a great flavor, and amazing aroma.

Rating: 4
The cover shot and the ingredients caught my attention immediately! Not a big fan of lasagne because of the amount of cheese generally added, the proportion of cheese was just right! Easy to prepare, the smoked cheese adds a nice variation to the flavor. The only ingredient I changed was to use hot Italian sausage instead. My 14 yr old son took one bite and told his dad - awesome!! This is a keeper that I will serve it to guests anytime!

Great lasagna. The sausage and prosciutto are great in the sauce and the smoked cheese definitely makes it unique.

I used two cans of tomatoes and ended up with a saucier sauce consistency and about two cups of sauce left over. I also omitted the prosciutto. I found this recipe quite painless to make, and yet, tasty and special enough that I would serve it for company. As it was, I made it for myself, and froze it in individual servings, which thawed out into delicious quick lunches and dinners throughout the month.

Excellent lasagna! I did not alter any of the ingredients (as per some of the comments) and the dish was absolutely delicious. I served this at a dinner party to rave reviews.

Delicious! my kids loved this dish as well. One suggestion: if you'd like to use the noodles that don't need boiling, make sure you top the m with some sauce. I actually do the following: I put the second layer of noodles, top them with the cheese mixture and then I put another set of noodles and top it with the sauce and the remainder of the smoked mozzarella on top. It's delicious and it cuts down on the prep time by quite a bit.

I would highly recommed using fire-roasted chopped tomatoes. I can't imagine this without the smoked mozzarella. I also used whole wheat noodles and they held together much better.

My first from-scratch sauce! It was a little harried; my partner phoned and when told it was a critical point in the sauce he said, "What, did you just open a jar?" He did NOT get a corner piece. Useful tip, perhaps echoing other reviews: I purchased butt prosciutto at a gourmet cheese shop for 99 cents. More than enough for this recipe.

This receipe was ok. Yes, you need more sauce but you don't need to double it. It's also a little bit thick as written; an extra can of tomatoes won't kill you. All in all, it's a good but not great lasagna.

Rating: 4
This was just amazing, over the top. I would give it 5 forks if possible. Must admit, as I was preparing it this morning, I was grousing about how time intensive it was...it's my first time in probably 10 years of making lasagne...but, WOW, was it worth the effort. I made only a few changes...did use crushed tomatoes as others suggested, and I doubled the sauce. Also, used all hot sausage, and it wasn't too spicy at all. The only other change was to add some fresh mozarella to the smoked..and I had a chunk of Fontina in the fridge, so I grated that and added to the top. Definitely use the smoked mozarella...it totally transforms this from ordinary to extraordinary...my guests went nuts over it. This is a real keeper, and though it's a lot of work, I will definitely be making this again soon.

This is the meal that won over my husband! This is the first meal I ever made for him and is still his favorite. I do 1.5times the sauce and actually a little less than called for smoked mozzerella and mix in some just regular mozzerella. It is wonderful!

Rating: 4
This is wonderful - the only way I make lasagna anymore! I use hot sausage (instead of sweet) and substitute the celery with green pepper. I also only use Muir Organic tomatoes since they are very low in acid. I sometimes use their Fire-Roasted tomatoes for some additional flavor. YUM-O!

Rating: 3
This was better than I expected. I didn't deviate from the recipe much - used more smoked cheese, about 1 lb., more sausage (1 1/4 lbs) and more tomatoes (28 oz can of crushed - bought by accident - 15 oz can of petite diced) and I tossed in a little Penzey's Italian seasoning in lieu of just straight oregano. The dish was lighter than I expected and hearty. I was dubious about the celery, but it does add an interesting texture.

GREAT Lasagna. I would definitely double the sauce though.

Great flavor with the smoked mozzarella. I also made one and one half times the sauce, but did not increase the sausage. Made lasagna the night before and chilled. The baking time for me was about 20 minutes longer. Guest raved and it does serve 8.

I will only make lasagna this way now! Actually it even gets much better the day after. And I guess it could use a few more tomatoes and sauce, but really, really good as is! I used a 9" square pan instead of a traditional 13" x 9" since I prefer thicker pieces and the same consistency throughout.

I've made this lasagna several times and everyone raves over it. You definitely need to make extra sauce though, otherwise it is too dry. I make 1.5 times the recipe but don't increase the amount of sausage.

This is a delicious, easy and quick recipe when you use no-boil lasagna noodles. The whole family loved it...even our four year old! (He happens to have very good taste...really!) I used italian turkey sausage for ours to cut down on fat...still delicious!

I think this is the best out of the ordinary lasagna. The pricey smoked mozzarella found at Whole Foods, was worth it. I agree with making some extra suace. I used fresh lasagna noodles. They maybe hard to come by and not worth the effort to make, but sure made the dish taste delicious.

This is the only Lasagna that has stopped me in my tracks. Such awesome flavor and uniqueness. I've made it countless times and everyone loves it.

This dish was incredible! We increased the recipe to make 5 lasagnas for a party. We used Barilla no boil lasagna noodles and substituted 1/2 of the smoked mozerella for regular mozerella (due to the high cost of smoked). We covered them in no stick aluminum foil and froze them. The day before the party we thawed them, and the day of the party baked them off. There was a nice smokiness to the lasagna even with 1/2 the smoked cheese. I have never had more compliments on a dish and am still getting them over a year later.

This is the yummiest! my husband was so thrilled. Friends that stopped by during the baking time asked for the recipe before trying it! We will make this again

This lasagna was excellent. I made it for work and everyone loved it. I agree that there could be a little bit more sauce. I added parmesan cheese and "bistro blends; asiago, garlic, mozarella" to the ricotta mixture and also some italian seasoning. I am making it again tonight and will make a litte more sauce.

One of the best recipes I have ever made from the recipe. Hands down a entre I would make for a party. The flavors are deep and rich. Make sure you get hand dipped whole milk ricotta. Makes a huge difference. Also, the quality of the italian sausage impacts the dish as well.

This was SO good! The smoked mozzerella really makes this special. The sauce was incredible, but I wished I had a little more of it for the lasagna.(But that may be because my husband and I kept tasting it every time we walked by the stove.:) The flavor of this recipe just can't be beat. I can't wait to make this for my in-laws this weekend.

We've made this twice now, once with regular mozzerella (for lack of finding the smoked) and then with the smoked. DEFINITELY worth the trouble of finding the smoked. It it time consuming (and difficult to spread the layers) but an excellent lasagna, special enough for guests yet something we'd make for ourselves as well.

This lasagna was awesome. It was one of teh best lasagnas I've had in a long time. I made it with traditional noodles and added extra celery, a green pepper, and used crushed tomatoes in the sauce. It was perfect. As others have said, the smoked mozzarella definitely made the dish and is worth seeking out.

I made this lasagna for the fourth time tonight. It's the only lasagna recipe I use now because it is sooooo good. It is absolutely worth seeking out the smoked mozzarella- it really does make or break the recipe. And just a little tweaking- my husband isn't too crazy about chunkt syle tomatoes, so instead of the can of whole tomatoes I used a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes. Still fantastic and oddly enough it seemed to be more saucy! This recipe is definitely a keeper!!!

I made this for the 2nd time last night and it turned out fabulous. The first time I did the no-boil recipe with the noodles and it needed more sauce.. Last night I did the boil recipe, and followed the recipe exactly. Everyone loved it!! I think next time I will add sauce to the top layer of noodles, the tops of mine were a little dry....

As consistent with the other reviewers, the recipe definitely needs more sauce. But overall, this recipe has become a family favorite ... with sausage or without.

This lasagne is very good. As for the sauce, I would make more as the finished product is a little dry. I did use no-boil pasta, so extra sauce is probably the remedy. Also, maybe add the green bell pepper, as suggested by another reviewer, or maybe more celery for more complexity. As for the cheese, I couldn't find smoked mozzarella, so I substituted 3/4 smoked gouda to 1/4 standard mozzarella (of total called for). The combination worked great and next time I will add more of all cheeses. I do recommend using a sweet Italian sausage. It adds a lot of flavor. We will definetly be having this again.

This is now my recipe of choice for lasagna. I use the no boil lasagna noodles and it saves a lot of time. I make the complete recipe, bake it as directed and then eat it after a day or two. Absolutely delicious. As for all the readers who can't find smoked mozzarella, check with your supermarket cheese department or gourmet foods manager.

I also made this for the season premiere of Soprano's. I couldn't find smoked mozzarella so I substituted smoked fontina and it worked fine. I used twice as much cheese filling as this recipe called for and could've used more. This was very tasty, but the sausage and smoked cheese makes it very rich-is it wrong.

Everybody loved this at home. The sausage really adds something special to that recipe. I wish I could say the same about the smoked mozz but I could not find any around my house. I thought the sauce and cheese mixture were spread too thin, so next time I do it, I will do a recipe and a half for both of them.

I made this to celebrate the season premier of The Sopranos. It was a hit with my crew! Finding smoked mozzarella and prosciutto in this town was not easy - I had to make trips to four different stores. I used sweet Italian sausage made with turkey. The result was fabulous and the lasagna had a much more complex flavor than any I've made. I will make this again, but also plan to try some of the others rated well on this site.

This was excellent. Made it once for my husband and I and once for a large group of people. Everbody raved. The sauce is thick and I worried it might be dry, but I thought it was delicious. I used hot Italian sausage instead of sweet. I have also made the cheese, sausage, basil recipe and prefer this one. I found the smoked mozarella at New Seasons Market.

I really wanted to love this, but was disappointed. I thought the sauce lacked depth and was too thick. The finished product turned out somewhat dry for me. I really had to search for the smoked mozz and didn't think it added anything special to the recipe. Could just be me, but I did compare the recipe to the similar SAUSAGE, CHEESE AND BASIL LASAGNA from this site that is so popular and found the later has more sauce and seasonings. Next time, I'll make that one. If you do make this one, divide the ricotta mixture in thirds instead of using 3/4 cup on each layer. It is used 3 times and there's a lot more than 2 1/4 cups.
