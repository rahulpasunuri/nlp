This recipe was quite involved and took much time. The results were good, even though I made a few substitutions. I didn't have ketjap manis, so I used half soy sauce half molasses. My noodles were fresh rice stick, I believe already cooked, so I just poured boiling water over them to soften and immediately rinsed afterward. The making and use of the shallot oil was clever, and the crepe was very nice. I am tempted to add cilantro and chopped nuts, but I don't want to turn this into a Thai dish when that isn't what is is meant to be. I prefer a few more variations in flavor and texture.
