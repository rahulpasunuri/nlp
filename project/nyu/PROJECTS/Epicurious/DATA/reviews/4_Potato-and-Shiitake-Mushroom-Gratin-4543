Everyone raced about it. Excellent prepared as-is!!

I have made this many many times but because I have an adversion to mushrooms, I always subtitute onions (I do this any time a recipe calls for mushrooms) This is so delicious and no one knows this is supposed to be with mushrooms..the sauteed onions are so intense and work well with the rosemary. Please forgive me for messing with your recipe but you need to try this also. PS I parboil my potato slices a little if I need to cut down the cooking time.

I have now made this recipe twice. It was excellent both times. The first time I used all button mushrooms and the second time half shitake and half button. Not a huge difference in flavor. I would advise to follow the rest of the recipe exactly as it is except it may need to bake a little longer. I check for doneness by poking into it with a bamboo skewer. Allow plenty of time for it to rest before serving. This was a great accompaniment to the Mustard Seed Encrusted Prime Rib.

winning flavors. Shiitakes are expensive so I fudge the amounts but always use a total of 3 lbs. of mushrooms. don't need to change a thing, except maybe your pant size the next day!

This is simply an excellent recipe! I made it last night for a party and it was a big hit -- no leftovers -- sadly. I will definitely be making this again. As for dried shiitake, I was forced to use them instead of fresh because my local grocer had none available (days before Thanksgiving no less!) I rehydrated them and they worked out fine but I didn't really have the full amount. Nevertheless, it didn't seem to hinder the flavor in any way. Enjoy!

What's not to like: intense mushroom flavor, cream & parm, herbs (I used fresh)??? This recipe is delicious!!!

made this for Christmas dinner. everyone asked for the recipe and not a drop was left. as with other reviewers, you only need about half of the cream and I did make it several hours in advance and it did sit fine before cooking

Guests loved this...decadent! Husband ate the small remainder for breakfast and asked me to make it again for Christmas dinner. I used 1 lb each of button mushrooms and baby bellas and added bacon to the mushroom mixture.

Made this for New Year's Eve to rave reviews. Everyone requested a copy of the recipe. I did half the amount of cream and half and half. Prior attempts produced a gratin that was far too soggy.

Amazing! Other than only using one pound each of the mushrooms (which was plenty), I followed the recipe to the letter and it was perfect - got rave reviews and was over the top delicious

I really expected this to be great. I knew when I was sauteeing the mushrooms that there were too many. I halved the recipe for 6 people and followed the recipe exactly. Way too many mushrooms and too much cream & half & half. The result was very runny and I like gratins that are set. The flavor was good but just too soupy and the mushrooms overpowered the whole dish.

Wonderful! Great flavors, hugely popular at my dinner party.

Very yummy and rich, even though I cut the fat and carbs way down by using sauteed zucchini (with a little pre-cooked potato), less cheese (I did goat cheese, parm., and gorgonzola), 2 tbs butter and lowfat milk instead of cream. It was still savory and filling, and I will definitely make variations of this again.

This sounds incredible! but can anyone tell me if I can substitute dry shitake and if so, how much would I have to use for this recipe....thanks for any imput

Just made this for Christmas dinner & it was incredible. I prepped the 'shrooms the day before to blend the flavors, & put gratin together just before cooking. Amazingly delish!

My household consists of 2 members so I made 1/3 of the recipe based on a previous review written for this recipe. I also used unsalted butter to cut down on the saltiness other reviews noted and used fresh rosemary and thyme. Excellent, I will definately make this again

I was decidedly underwhelmed by this dish the first day -- after following the recipe to the letter except for substituting Trader Joe's frozen wild mushrooms for the shitakes -- but the next day I reheated the hell out of it and the whole thing coalesced into real scrumptiousness. So, my advice is to bake it for much, much longer -- until the potatoes are super-browned through and through. And it was a tad greasy; cutting down on the butter probably wouldn't hurt.

Great recipe! Very rich. I halved it without problem. For the mushroms I used about 1 lb. shiitake and 1/2 cup dried porcini (soaked for 20 min - than added the strained soak to broth and reduced both)- fabulous!

This had rave reviews, so we tried it. The store didn't even have 3 pounds of mushrooms, so once we finally found enough, and were making the dish, we wondered if this was a potato dish or mushroom dish. Way too many mushrooms. We ended up cutting the mushrooms in half and it still was too many. Uugh.

You'll bust buttons if you eat more than a serving of this rich and wonderful stuff, but who cares? I'm giving it four forks and I had the nerve to use only canned mushrooms on hand. I can't wait to get wild mushrooms and use them the next time. Go for it. You'll love it.

At a 6 person dinner party everyone had seconds of this dish. Very tasty, a nice alternative to the cheesy potato(hasbrown) dish so many of us make on the holidays. I would make it again, but it didn't "wow" me.

This was a fabulous hit for Christmas dinner. I used all shiitake. If you're lucky enough to live near a large Asian populaiton you can pick them up for around $2.50 per pound at a good Chinese supermarket -otherwise it would have been much more costly. I used fresh herbs and Parmigiano Reggiano instead of gruyere. I put cheese on each layer and made the entire gratin (with the exception of browning the cheese on top) the day before to save oven space. An hour before dinner I put it in the oven covered at 325 for about 25 minutes then I sprinkled the cheese on top and browned it. We had leftovers panfried the next day with leftover tenderloin. It looks so difficult and elegant but it's actually a breeze to make. I'll make this every year.

This is a holiday staple in our house. I have tried many different kinds of mushrooms and liked the results each time. Last night I made this with regular old button mushrooms and the result was great.

Tasted great. Made the same dish, only without mushrooms which I liked more.

I have made this dish eight times and it is a classic on my holiday menu. It is very rich and elegant and even tastes better the next day. I have tried it with shiitake and wood mushrooms or is it woodear mushrooms, anyway the wood mushroom altered the texture of the recipe so now I just make it as written. Gruyere cheese is nice with it too.

This recipe turned out excellent. I used 1 lb. each of shitake, portabello, and button mushrooms. I used 1 tbsp. fresh thyme and rosemary instead of dried. I reduced the garlic from 3 tbsp. to 1 tbsp because I skipped the chicken broth step. Instead I used about 1/4 cup white wine and cooked until wine evaporated. Remove from heat. Follow the rest of the recipe. Made it 6 hours in advance and reheat in oven at 350 for about 30 minutes. Great dish and will definitely make it again! Everyone enjoyed this dish a lot!

Made this (half recipe) with the beef tenderloin & shallots & port. YUM. Did the mushrooms in advance, and it was hard to keep people from stealing them before I assembled the dish. Could have done the full recipe of mushrooms and saved half for omelet filling or other uses.

Friends made this dish for a special dinner, along with the tenderloin with shallots it was featured with. It was absolutely fantastic. I'm still dreaming about it!

Excellent dish. I made this for dinner and I did not make enough. It was gone in less then 15 minutes even though it is extremely rich. This is probably why. I make it all the time. I put regular potatoes and gorgonzola cheese and all different kinds of mushrooms.

My first time making this dish, was also bland. I added more salt, pepper, herbs and also some cheese and cream to make it thick like a true gratin. Sort of a cross between the "Potato & Shitake Mushroom Gratin" and this one.

This is pretty good, but it didn't knock my socks off. Next time, I'll try it with evaporated skim milk because I'm still feeling guilty (talk about rich!). I also think I under-seasoned it a bit - make sure you taste the mushroom mixture to make sure it's adequately salted. I used fresh herbs which I prefer.

We really enjoyed this recipe. My sons who are not mushroom lovers had 3 helpings. The recipe feeds about 12.

This dish is amazing! Very rich and creamy. I served this at Easter and everyone loved it. Since we had small children I made 1/4 of the dish without the mushroom mixture (added few extra slices of potatoes) and it turned out great. Try this one!

This turned out very good. I used some white mushrooms and added some white wine to them. I simmered for about 3 mins then added the stock -delicious!!! I also reduced the butter significantly. I didn't have half and half, wasn't sure what the difference would be if I substituted with whole milk - turned out just fine

Neither my husband nor I generally like potato gratins, but this one is an exception. So good, he even had seconds. It was very creamy and also very tasty. The mushrooms add an interesting flavor. I will definitely make this again.

Served as a side dish for beef tenderloin with roasted shallots, this was a big hit. My son, who says he doesn't like mushrooms, loved this. It's great as leftovers! Also, I couldn't bring myself to pay the kings ransom being charged for shiitakes so I substituted baby bellas and added just a few shiitakes. I think any mushroom you like would work just fine!

This recipe has become my family's favorite potato side dish. Have made several times to rave reviews from guests each time. One time I was in a pinch and only used button mushrooms and the flavor was still fabulous.

I have made this recipe several times and have gotten raves from everyone. Try substituting evaporated skim milk for the cream and half and half. It doesn't significantly change the outcome.

In an effort to make this dish a bit healthier, I substituted evaporated skimmed milk for the whipping cream and half and half. It was a hit! Easy and delicious. I paired this with an herb roasted turkey breast and everyone was very pleased.
