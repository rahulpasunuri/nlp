These were delicious. They were also too sweet and too much. I made 8 servings instead of 6, and it was still over the top. My eaters all agreed that they would have liked more of the graham crackers. Nobody managed to finish their dessert!

Just a little too sweet for me. Recipe worked fine and others enjoyed.

I've been on a S'mores kick lately and when I saw that this recipe was created from the team behind Baked, I had to try it. This was fairly easy to make, and everyone loved the richness of pudding. I served these in mason jars and could possibly increase the servings to eight if I had a larger party. I did omit the whiskey this time in order to make it kid friendly. By far the best part was finally buying a butane torch to keep in the kitchen for desserts like these.

These were wonderful. I served them in 8 oz mason jars. Next time I may reduce the serving size and make 8 instead. I too skipped the whiskey - just to make it more kid-friendly.

I only made the pudding part of this recipe, with out the whisky. It was very good. I really enjoyed it warm, and I think next time I might plan to serve it that way. - Just a note about skipping the espresso: you can't taste any sort of espresso flaver in the finished pudding (and I really dislke coffee and would for sure detect the espresso) and it helps bring out the chocolate flavor.

Very smooth, and rich. I substituted the dark chocolate for semi-sweet, and skipped the espresso and whiskey (for my kids). I should have cut some sugar out, as it was a tad too sweet because of the change I made. Just topped it off with mini-marshmallows.

Very easy to make. I only made the pudding as a late night sweet fix. When I read everyone's comments on the portion size I was sure they were exaggerating, but they were right. This could easily be stretched to 8 portions. I ate this as a stand-alone treat and couldn't finish it, so I don't know how the recommended portion sizes would fare after eating dinner. It is very dense and rich, but unbelievably smooth and creamy. Deep chocolate flavor thanks to the espresso powder. I had been using super finely ground coffee beans in my brownies in lieu of instant espresso powder but making this recipe I finally see that it is not the same thing, presumably because the instant powder dissolves. Now I know!

additional note- I agree with other comments, serving size reccommended is large- I made 8 servings with one layer of graham crackers, one layer of pudding and one layer of marshmallow.

YUMMY- got rave reviews from everyone who ate it. I left out the Whiskey because I didn't have any- couldn't tell. This one is a keeper!

This was so good! I made it for my older sister, her friend, and my parents and everyone loved it. Nobody could eat a whole serving so I would recommend cutting down the portion size. I will definitely make it again!

Oh my god, this was better than sex. I doubled the pudding and crumbs, then instead of making individual servings just layered the whole concoction in a 9 x 13 casserole, then put the marshmallow (not doubled) on the top. The pudding by itself would be amazing. The crumbs added nice texture, and the cinnamon made it just that much nicer. I could have lived without the marshmallow. It was easy enough to make, I'm just not a huge marshmallow fan - I made it more out of curiosity than anything else. Would definitely make the pudding itself again. I could easily have eaten the entire casserole in one sitting - or at least my mouth could have, until my brain kicked in.

Absolutely decadent. I only made the pudding of this so I can't comment on the other two parts, but it was very, very rich; so much so that like a previous reviewer mentioned you can definitely stretch the servings.

This had a great taste and very easy to make! Very rich so you may be able to make more servings then the recipe calls for.
