Really quite good. Made for last sunday dinner and crust making was painless. I avoid crust and usually opt for puff pastry. This is nice and light. When i am looking for something heartier I make a fennel cream tart. The recipe is baked by feel. This is the closest I have been able to find to it. I tried this blog version yesterday and it was actually even more delicious than my usual: http://www.neurotickitchen.com/2013/03/ingredient-spotlight-fennel-savory.html

I was very excited when I found this recipe; however, I made it and served for my 4th July party. No one touched it! Frankly after tasting it, I found it boring.

make the veggies any way you want. i did roasted onions and grape tomatoes, grilled corn and heirloom squash. as long as they're good, you can't lose. it's a lovely recipe.

I made this 3 or 4 times with variations, and the one most, was made more like a quiche, with the vegetables sauteed (nearly carmelized), and then cooked in the tart with the filling. It was also much better when served warm.

I omitted the cayenne and added herbs de provence and a few cloves of garlic to the filling; YUM! I'm serving it as a side to a roasted filet, ALL done ahead!

i made a few changes: I use fillo dough for the crust- maybe about 6 sheets and sprayed them with butter flavored cooking spray. the vegatbles i used were : 1 roasted yellow pepper, 1 small fennel bulb, 1 yellow squash, 2 portobello mushrooms, and a bunch of cherry tomatoes. YUM! very light, especially because i used the fillo dough instead of a real crust, but also very satisfying as a breakfast or part of a light meal. By using the fillo dough, i was able to make this quickly in the 45 minutes i had before guests came over.

Made 5 quiches for a Christmas lunch and this was the one that got the most attention as it looked so pretty. Roasted beats, asparagus, zucchini slices and red peppers (red and green theme for XMas) and thinly sliced everything and piled it on top. Very tasty and pretty. Made filling as suggested and it was great.

Made this for a late August vegetarian dinner party to rave reviews. The only change I made was to add yellow and red tear drop tomatoes to the vegetable mix. Other than that -- outstanding. The dough tasted good, but I had a really hard time rolling it. It kept sticking the the rolling pin. Any suggestions??? (I added flour, didn't help much.)

i have made this several times, and each time it was a hit. i love fennel so i left it in. This is very good for the Jewish Holiday of Shavuot, when it is customary to eat dairy dishes. Of course it is also great for brunch, or a light summer dinner/lunch. i was really surprised at how easy making the crust was.

Fantastic dish. I used a deep dish frozen crust, and it worked great. Broiled portabella mushrooms, yellow squash, garlic, and onion were a perfect complement to the tart. I also threw in about 1/4 cup of parmesean cheese, which gave it even more complexity.

Great recipe as is..Would decrease cayenne as prev. suggested. Just make sure to add enough for the extra kick. Next time I'll try a larger tart pan 10", would result in a thinner cheese layer, and possibly increase the ratio of vegs to tart base. Added fresh asparagus, and only cooked veg until al dente. Next time will cut and plate slices, then add veg mixture. You need the veg to make this dish, and in cutting and plating, you can add more on top!! Served with grilled chicken and got rave reviews.

Fantastic! The filling and crust are perfect! I took other reviewers suggestions with the topping. I didn't use the fennel and instead threw in about 8 cloves of garlic, roughly chopped. I also roasted all of the vegetables togther instead of cooking on the stovetop. I felt this really drew out their flavor. You could really use any mixture of vegetables with this tart.

Incredible presentation! I saved a half-moon of zucchini, and another of yellow squash, cooking them with the many veggie chunks, then set them in the center with a spring of basil between them. The salt, pepper, and parmesan-sprinkled vegetables looked beautiful resting atop the golden-edged tart. I used onion instead of fennel bulb, and added broccoli in, but otherwise followed the recipe. While it was delicious, the veggies could have used more flavor, and the goat cheese was rather expensive. I highly recommend cooking the vegetables with pieces of garlic. I ended with some surplus whipped and sour cream, and basil, which is rather unavoidable in this recipe. The solution, I think, would be to make two of the tarts for a party or similar. Definately worth making at least once for yourself/family though!

A big hit at a potluck. I used some sauteed zucchini I already had in the fridge, plus the corn (sauteed with a bit of rosemary) and some briefly-sauteed tomato slices. Arranged the vegetables decoratively, too. I used half-and-half that I had on hand instead of whipping cream, and it was fine. In any case, you really could use whatever spring/summer vegetables you have around -- plus the fresh herb(s) of your choice.

This was good, but not great; it had a quiche-like texture (which wasn't what I was expecting) and could use a bit more flavor...might make again, though, and revise a bit, maybe using diff. veggies.

This is wonderful, albeit a little time-consuming. (Most of that time is resting the dough in the fridge.) I made this for a vegetarian Mother's Day brunch, and it was a big hit. I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.

I thought this was delicious! My husband really liked it as well. I omitted the fennel (not one of my faves) and used a white onion. Also, partway through baking I spooned the veggies on top of the tart so that they could sink into the filling a bit, rather than putting them on at the end. Yum!

Great crust, delicious custard. The veggie combination was o.k. The fennel had a nice crunch, the corn and squash were good but I think I would add tomatoes next time.

We loved this dish and my partner rated it a definite "keeper." In the future I will make more veggies and add garlic when sauteeing them. Also thought I nice grilled turkey sausage would be a tasty addition.

This was good but needed a bit more flavor. I would make it again but when sauteeing the vegetables, would add some shallots and/or garlic...and definitely some salt!

This a very goos recipe made with fresh ingredients. I really ejoyed making it, since it's fairly easy. Do not forget to add the cayenne pepper, it really gives the custard nice kick. Great vegetarian entree.
