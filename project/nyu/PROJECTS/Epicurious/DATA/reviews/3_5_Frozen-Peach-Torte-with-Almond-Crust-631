This sounded great...especially since I had just gone peach picking. Well it was very bland. If I did make it again I would use more peaches for the center layer and make sure to drain first. The crumbs also very plain would probably add some cinnamon next time.

I made this recipe for a board meeting. They all loved it. One member hounded me for six months to get the recipe. This is one of my favorites.

pretty flavorless, even with really good peaches.

This was an incredible dessert for a hot summer night. Will definitely make this one agin.

A recipe sure to please- I have been making this torte almost every summer since it first appeared in print in 1995, and it has never failed to receive rave reviews. This is a must-keep recipe. You can used canned peaches in a pinch, but the result is not as good as with super fresh, ripe summer peaches. I've also successfully substituted madiera for kirsch.

I have been making this torte almost every summer since 1995 when it first appeared, and it has always received rave reviews. Using peaches in season really makes this dessert a winner, although I have to admit, I've used canned in a pinch (!).

Delicious! We didn't finish the torte the first day I served it ( it was a BIG hit!) and I froze the remainder even with the fresh peaches on top. It was just as wonderful the second day!
