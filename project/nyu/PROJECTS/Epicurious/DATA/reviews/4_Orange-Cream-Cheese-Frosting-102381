Super easy and fast and did remind me a bit of a Dreamcicle though far better. I did both the orange zest (more) and the powdered sugar (less) to taste. I think you need both the butter and sour cream to make this spreadable. If you are making it with the spice cake you should up the quantity -- I ended up having to make a last-minute half batch to cover the cake

Great frosting! This recipe can easily be doubled and freezes beautifully. Use this as a base and change up using Meyer Lemon or Blood Orange zest, substitute vanilla for other extracts. Today my chocolate cake with fudge center was frosted with the orange cream cheese frosting. I finished with toasted sliced almonds on the sides for crunch!

This is an excellent icing! I made it exactly as written with the exception of adding more orange peel and it turned out great!

Very nice. I liked the taste before adding the sour cream, so didn't add it. So I didn't have enough frosting. But delicious!

Delicious. Easy to make and tastes like a Dreamcicle. Put it on cookies and some cupcakes and everything was a hit. Also dyed it orange for Halloween. Yum!

A definite winner as written. And I'd have to disagree with others who thought that 2 cups of sugar wasn't enough or that it has a "cheesy" flavor. This is one of the few recipes I've ever used that I feel didn't need some type of adjustment.

Wow! was this ever delicious! I can imagine this going well on most any cake, I used it on the orange cake (also on Epicurious.com) and it is now part of my permanant collection.

This was fabulous! The orange flavor complements the cream cheese well. The changes I made were to omit the butter (stronger cream cheese flavor) and to increase the sugar by 50%.

Did somebody really just say "You're not the boss of me?" ROFL! I like to read about little tweaks and adjustments people make to recipes, but I, too, find it annoying when people rate the recipe, and then it turns out that they really just wrote an entirely new recipe. I don't want to see, "I'm allergic to dairy products, so I omitted the eggs, milk, cheese, sour cream, and butter and used club soda instead." But then, I'm not the boss of anybody, so there you go. I'm going to make this recipe using peanut butter instead of cream cheese, and Dawn Dishwashing Detergent instead of butter, and I'm going to add some cayenne pepper and paprika. I'll let you know how it turns out.

Can I just say it's a bit annoying to read a recipe that received 4 forks, but then every comment includes significant modifications? Rate the recipe that was provided, not the one you made up!

My family and I really enjoyed this delicious, not-overly-sweet frosting on a spice cake. I made the recipe exactly as written using mostly organic ingredients and plenty of orange zest. In my opinion, the secret in getting a great texture for proper frosting here is in using cultured, unsalted butter that is much lower in water content than the typical store brands. This has become my standard cream cheese frosting recipe.

Great frosting! I used this on the orange-pineapple carrot cake recipe from this site and it was the perfect frosting for this fantastic cake! I chill it in the refrigerator for an hour and it spreads beautifully!

Yummy. I loved this recipe. I tweaked it a bit; I added another stick of butter (to lighten the texture), a Tablespoon of Cointreau (for more orangey zing) and substituted the sour cream with heavy cream (for a smoother flavor). This might appeal to those of you who like buttercreams a bit more than traditional cream cheese frosting. To me this recipe is a little too 'cheesy' and dense as is. Good for a carrot cake but a bit much for a spice cake. Enjoy!

The people that say you should omit the butter are crazy the butter makes it thicker and gives it a richer taste. Definately add some exrta orange zest if you want an orangier frosting. Good luck Making it!!

Delicious. Sweet and tangy. I did add more powdered sugar, as it was a bit runny.

Excellent! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and omitted the butter, increased the sour cream to 1c, and doubled the orange zest. Turned out perfectly with these modifications.

Recipe was great, but with some major changes. I used 32 oz. of cream cheese, 1 very full cup of sour cream, ommitted all of the butter, and doubled the orange zest. Made the recipe more healthy, more tasty, and easier to spread on hold shape.

I halved the butter in this recipe and next time I think I will omit the sour cream. It was a little too soft for my liking. Others thought it was excellent as is.

After reading the other reviews I decided to adjust this recipe by eliminating the butter, increasing the sour cream to 1 cup and increasing the grated orange peel to 6 teaspoons. This made a very creamy frosting with a nice orange flavor. I will also try it for a lemon version.

Best frosting I've ever had!!! I added a bit more orange zest and it was amazing!!

I made this in two 10" pans rather than three 9". I skipped the butter and the sour cream in the frosting but added a tablespoon or so of frozen orange juice concentrate. It was very tasty. I'll make it again.

I fail to see why there's butter in this frosting--just to add more fat? I omitted the butter entirely and didn't miss it, and also used less sugar to taste. It could be orangier, though. I also used plain yogurt instead of sour cream, which worked out fine. Note that a half recipe of this will put a thin but acceptable amount of frosting on 24 cupcakes.
