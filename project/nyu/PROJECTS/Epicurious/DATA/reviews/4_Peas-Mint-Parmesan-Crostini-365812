Did these for Easter. Very pretty presentation, but not worth the effort. They tasted ok, but nobody considered them a favorite

Guests went out of their way to compliment me on this at our big New Year's Eve party. ! It's snap to make, gorgeous color, lovely taste and was gone within minutes! I set aside bit for us to eat the next day (as I do with all my dishes) and added some leftover boursin cheese. Even better!

Forgot the balsamic but still a light, delicious summer appetizer that got rave reviews.

Instead of grilling the slices, I infused some olive oil with garlic, brushed it on the baguette slices and broiled on low in the oven for 3 minutes until browned. I used a food processor to coarsely puree the peas with the olive oil and a generous helping of salt. The first one I had, the vinegar was forgotten, but unlike other reviewers, I really think it needed it. Delicious and pretty! They were gobbled up :)

Definitely better than the sum of its parts. Very important to use quality ingredients, and make sure you salt to taste.

Underwhelmed! Used imported parmesan and balsamic, quality peas and fresh mint and bread and my reaction was, "ho hum". nothing exciting, not memorable.

Absolutely delicious, and very apealing to the eye. Used frozen peas, blanched them is salted water drained and removed excess moisture with paper towels. Rough chopped in mini processor. Grilled the baguette on the BBQ olive oil w/ minced fresh garlic (added flavor) grated the Parmesean, don't forget the mint or the balsamic. Use good quality ingredients, for best flavor and results. Everyone raved over them served with cold martinis. Major Yum Factor.

Delicious and such an appetizing fresh green color. It's easier to add the mint on top of the peas before the parmesan, otherwise it has nothing to adhere to and tends to fly away. I too forgot the balsamic and did not miss it. The garlic rub on the toast adds a nice zing.

Friends made this for us last night and I was wowed. I've been afraid to try peas and mint together, and now I'm a huge fan. My friends made the recipe as written except they forgot the balsamic. It was not missed. The peas stayed on the toast as they were mashed very well. And I agree with other writers, that it's better to chiffonade the mint and not just tear. These were so delicious and I can't wait to make them myself!!

This was phenomenal. A simple h d'oevre that wowed my foodie friends. Made with fresh peas and favas, both were great.

You should all make this at least once before you die. Don't follow the directions for mashing the peas, though. Instead, puree the peas after cooking them with the oil to get a texture that holds together better. Then stir in the salt and proceed as directed. I used a syringe to drop a few drops of balsamic onto each crostini, not because I am that precise, but because it's really fun and less wasteful than drizzling. Oh, and take the suggestion of many other posters and cut your mint into a chiffonade rather than tearing it.

This was good but I expected the mixture to be a bit more like a puree. It didn't stay together well and tended to fall off the toast. It was tasty but I think I would play with it a little more next time to get the texture I was looking for.

I made this with fresh fava beans and used extra mint that I chiffonade ( torn pieces are too big ). I used lemon juice instead of vinegar. Try drizzling olive oil over the entire crostini. My guests raved over this and I had to make more to put out since they dissapeared before all my guest arrived.

Yummy. Go easy on the Parmesan and balsamic vinegar so they don't overpower everything else!
