This is really great; and while some find whole birds intimidating, it really is easy. You may want to try some lemon, and I actually through some bacon on mine too http://tiny.cc/mmbw7; they are all awesome

Simple, delicious, and super easy! I stuffed the chicken with the lemon and an extra head of garlic just to add a bit more flavor. This one is definitely a keeper.

I almost never (once a year?) cook or eat meat and home but in the past year I've had a craving for good roast chicken and THIS is the recipe I've used. Simple ingredients, good directions, accurate timing, and delicious outcome. I still tend to only have meat on holidays and vacation but every few months I can break regulations and make this b/c it's so good. Plus afterward you have the makings of cold lunches and chicken soup!

I made this with a fryer, and used 3 heaping forkfuls of minced garlic from a jar, used the same cooking temperature except for the last half hour, reduced that to 350. It turned out great.

I use 2-3 tbl. of salted butter in the rosemary mixture (and omitted the salt). It made the meat perfect and keeps it from drying out (calorie counters - each tbl = 100 cal). Also cooked with potatoes and vegetables in roasting pan for a full one pan meal.

I too stuffed the chicken with lemon and garlic. It was nice and tender and delicately flavored.

Wow was this good. I put some lemon and rosemary in the cavity but didn't make any gravy as I was trying to be healthful. I served it with mashed potatoes and green beans. My boyfriend thought it was "awesome."

This is delicious and easy. Try adding two cloves of peeled garlic, a sprig of rosemary and and half a lemon into the cavity. It gives extra flavor to the pan drippings!
