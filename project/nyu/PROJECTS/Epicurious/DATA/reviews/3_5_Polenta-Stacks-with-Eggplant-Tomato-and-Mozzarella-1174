Delicious! My husband and 3 little children loved the polenta and cheese. Baked it a little too long though and it melted. Still tasted wonderful!

Wonderful! Wonderful! Do not overbake the stacks...my polenta ran all over...but the flavors were still amazing

Its as delicious as it is elegant in its presentation. The last time I made it my husband suggested adding prosciutto. So I wrapped the each eggplant with one slice of prosciutto. It added a wonderful flavor.

Awesome! I used ready made polenta and it worked just as well. They make good leftovers too--just throw them in a casserole dish with some pasta sauce and fresh mozzarella. yummmm....

This recipe was really good, but if the tomatoes are not really in-season flavorful, try roasting them with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar. They added alot of flavor to the stacks, and the presentation was beautiful! I also cut the polenta with a small serrated edge biscuit cutter to make them look more special.

I have been making this dish since it appeared in Bon App in 1995. It remains a hit with everyone who tries it. I double the recipe but make it in a 9x13 pan, and so make slightly larger squares; they hold the ingredients better.

This dish definitely needs twice the polenta - there's an error there. Otherwise, if you use fresh ingredients, this was a great recipe!

The basil in the polenta is delicious. Something is strange with the directions though -- if you cut the polenta in 25 pieces from a 9x9 pan, those will be some tiny squares. Cut it to fit the eggplant you have. I made two minor modifications to the recipe: Instead of mozarella, I used a very mild, white colby grated fine. Then I really "stacked" the layers, using two layers of each, polenta, eggplant, tomato, and cheese ... then repeated. Served with a baby romaine salad this was a sensational summer dinner. All the ingredients where fresh from my local farmers market. My husband called it "rich man's pizza." I'll serve this again.

I made this recipe for a dinner party, and it was a huge hit. I used pre-prepared polenta which you just have to slice. The stacks did not want to stay upright when the cheese was melting, so the presentation was not as pretty on some as on others, but it was very tasty.

Wonderful! I used a regular eggplant, skinned it and cut it a little thinner (about 3/8 inch).

Mmmmm. This was scrumptious. My friend and I got together for an afternoon of delightful cooking (after sitting on the beach, enjoying the sunshine--okay, that's what we do in Santa Cruz). She made the polenta, and I made something else. Yum! She said to use a cup of polenta, and she added fresh corn on the top of the dish... Excellent results!

Awesome recipe. Add a little red pepper flakes.
