Love this - tried it last week and was recently inspired to try my own variation using Whole Wheat Fettucine, Mission Figs and Pancetta - just a touch of cream and some basil to brighten it all and it was fantastic. The recipe and photo is here if you'd like to check it out: http://www.neurotickitchen.com/2012/10/flavors-of-fall-butternut-squash-apple.html

OMG! This was fabulous. Used store bought bread crumbs and sauteed in butter. Prepared all else as directed. Figs are abundant in August at my grocer so I try all sorts of different recipes. This one is a keeper.

We thought this dish was great. Will be better when we can use fresh figs instead of dried but it was fabulous with dried figs too (just let the dried figs sit in the liquid a while prior to adding fettuccine to soak and soften). Great flavor. Used panko bread crumbs as suggested but otherwise pretty much followed the recipe. We will make this often when fig season comes along.

What a great recipe. Our Black Mission fig tree is still bearing fruit here in early November, so we were looking for something to do with them. Found this recipe and had basically everything on hand so went for it. Used regular bread crumbs which were fine but would use toasted panko next time for more texture. I did add a bit of chevre cheese that I had on hand and some crushed red pepper as we like a little more spice. But flavors were great, not too sweet as some had suggested with regard to figs, as I added more than recipe suggested. I will make this again for a casual dinner party while I still have ample supplies of figs.

This was delicious and easy to make. Made as directed but substituted a large shallot for the onion. Used the pasta cooking water and it was not watery at all. Will be making again whenever we have fresh figs.

This was really tasty and pretty easy to prepare. I think the key is the fresh figs as they break down into the sauce and add flavour. I left out the addition of the pasta water and let the cooked pasta soak up the sauce for a few minutes before serving, which eliminated most of the liquid and served to concentrate the flavours.

Underwhelming. Even without adding the pasta water, sauce was watery because it's reduced before adding broth. Doesn't make sense. It was more like pasta soup. Maybe if I had reduced it *after* adding broth, it would have been good. As it was, the flavor was ok but not special. I did use a fresh pine nut ravioli instead of fettucine - maybe that makes a difference? But I doubt Ill make it again in any case.

I really wanted to adore this dish. I think the use of dried figs contributed to our underwhelmed response. Addition of sun-dried tomatoes did not really add anything although arugula did (both suggested by other reviewers). The egg fettuccine is a must. Using toasted bread crumbs saved time and calories. It was easy to make and tasted good but overall, there was no "zing" or "wow" factor. Fiance was even "less whelmed". For the cost vs. results, I can't say we're dying to make it again.

This is an unusual set of ingredients that works. Very tasty. I like the bread crumbs but I think next time I'll try with toasted pine nuts instead.

This recipe has been in my 'first-date' dinner category for awhile. More importantly - I lost a bit of me with a just- sharpened knife, in the pancetta. My finicky guests, armed with this knowledge, vied for seconds!

This was scrumptious! Didn't change a thing except we omitted the bread crumbs and didn't miss them at all. Wonderful flavors. I've made this several times, and since I was lucky enough to find fresh figs this week I will be making this again tonight!

Really quite good - one of those recipes you think about for a few days after you make it. Luckily I had it all to myself - but company would looove it! (People always seem to give extra points for sweet additions to savory dishes and vice versa.)

OUTSTANDING! The blend of flavors, especially the salty of the pancetta with the sweetness of the figs, just make this dish explode on the palate. I added more rosemary as suggested but that was the only adjustment. My friend who shared the dinner took my copy of the recipe with her when she left.

Husband came home with a tray of figs and we decided to try this recipe to use them up. Followed the recipe but added the sundried tomatoes and arugula too. Loved the flavours in this dish.Would like to try it in winter with dried figs adding them with the garlic. This recipe though is great for company especially if you did your prep ahead.

This dish was great. I have an enormous Desert King fig which is producing a bumper crop this year! I've also made figs with gorgonzola (also delicious - Emeril's recipe). I added more lemon juice, more rosemary (at least twice as much) and about 172 grams of pancetta as the guy at the deli didn't know how much six ounces was, har har (this is Canada, eh?). It was GREAT! I served it to real foodie friends of mine who just returned from being in France for over a month so...they are no slouches, either. They were ecstatic. No one found this dish too sweet?! (While my own figs are sweet-ish, they are not overly so....) I used 6 figs only, cut in half then in thirds. That came to almost one pound - they're monsters this year :-) I gave the recipe to another friend and she loved it also.

I totally forgot about the bread crumbs! Oh well, next time... My additions, which I reccomend, were sundried tomatoes, chopped, and arugula, as another reviewer reccomended. Go easy on the salt - between the pancetta, and the water from the pasta pot (usually pretty saline) it was a tad too salty for me.

This ia great dish that takes no time. I sub'd spinach fettucine for regular. I wouldn't suggest the same for onion - needs to be red for the spicier "zip" needed to balance sweetness of figs. Turkish calmata figs great type to use. Agree w/ other reviewer Susanna - breadcrumbs a must (for texture).

Rating: 4
A delicious and unusual pasta dish - one of the best 3 I've found on this site. I used fresh Turkish figs which were not overly sweet and needed to be skinned. Their flavor melded beautifully with the other ingredients - not over powering at all. The bread crumbs were also an essential component. Note: I used fresh fettuccine rather than dried. Wonderful.

Way too rich... I like figs but 8/9 cut into quarters was too much...

I didn't think I liked figs, but this changed my mind. To make it less fattening, I decreased the olive oil for the crumbs and then used lower fat Hormel bacon instead of pancetta. It was absolutely delicious!

Really good. Even the family members who don't like fresh figs enjoyed this dish. I can't wait to make it again.

I found the figs to be a bit overpowering in the quantity stated here. I enjoyed the dish, but next time I will use 1/2 figs and 1/2 something else neutral - maybe artichoke hearts or green peas. Good flavor overall, just a bit sweet.

Had a few figs on hand, doesn't everybody, and, lo and behold, up cropped this unusual recipe on Constant Comment; unusual, that is, to me. We bought the pancetta and the egg fettuccine and proceeded to make this deliciously different pasta meal. Tried to cut it down for two, and it was easy enough, although we will have leftovers, which we love anyway. This is a once or twice a year meal, when the figs arrive at Caputos. In fact, it is worth buying the figs for.

A truly wonderful dish. The combination of flavors is exquisite.

LOVED this recipe! Be sure to use the egg fettuccine with it--it DOES make a difference! Also, substituted prosciutto crudo for the pancetta but everything else exactly as called for. Really wouldn't change a thing.

To our neighbor in Bethesda: I saw fresh figs last week at Fresh Fields in Clarendon, and also at the Eastern Market on Capitol Hill. I can't wait to try this recipe!

My husband and I absolutely loved this recipe. We have a fig tree on our property, and of course this is the perfect time of year for the dish. One change that I made, for those southerners out there that have access to these, was that I substituted a vidalia onion for the red one. It was really sweet and crunchy. Delicious!

Which type of figs -- does it make a difference? There are three or four to choose from at the supermarket (sorry E. Coast!). Thanks for any input.

This dish is excellent! The only difference made was that we used less pasta than called for. Everyone raved - and we're all used to eating well, so this was indeed a hit. Absolutely Fab!

As an answer to the cook from Bethesda: figs are ripe from August to September, but they are very difficult to ship, since they must be picked when fully ripe (they don't ripen once picked) and when they are fully ripe, they're squishy, oozy and difficult to ship. Thus the difficulty of finding figs in places (the East Coast) where they don't grow. You're looking at the right time, so if you don't find any, it could just be that the gourmet market decided to not stock hard, unripe figs that no one wants to buy, or squishy, soft, smashed ones that people don't want either. Long answer, sorry about that.

Is August fig season? Should I expect to find fresh ones in my gourmet markets? Haven't seen them yet. Can anyone tell me if I'm early or late? Or should I AGAIN complain to my gourmet market that they've become nothing more than an overpriced, prepared food, carry-out joint!

This dish was fabulous!! It was the tastiest pasta dish I have ever made. I love figs, and the combination of the salty pancetta and the sweet figs was sublime. I could eat this every day!!!

I added a handful of baby arugula to cut the sweetness - it complemented the figs perfectly.
