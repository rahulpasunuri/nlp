I wanted to like this salad. However, it was time consuming and the end result did not justify the time and effort spent. More to the point, the pickled squash ribbons were strange, and the dressing was ordinary. Tastier recipes exist for squash and kale.

I wasn't a huge fan of this recipe as it. It was tedious, the skin of the squashes wasn't that good, and I would completely omit the vegetable pickling liquid and replace with either a granny smith apple vinaigrette or a balsamic dressing instead. I would use about half the amount of squash and omit the almost completely. A few very thin almost grated pieces are attractive, but not that good. If you do decide to use the vegetable pickling liquid, I'd recommend keeping the spices in a cheese cloth to remove before adding to the salad. As is the liquid is overwhelming. You can substitute different squashes, but you can't substitute the watermelon radishes. I went to several specialty grocery stores before I found one, but they are worth it. They are beautiful and sweet instead of spicy. With a little bit of tweaking, this salad could be phenomenal- but I won't follow this recipe again.

I personally LOVE to try new ingredients and like when you reviewers offer helpful hints on new variations or substitutions to try and especially love your comments on what works and doesn't. Makes the experience so much richer!

Hey Epi friends, let us be kind. Maybe we have a new, blossoming cook, one that is not fully aware of what lurks beyond the frozen isle...... xoxoxo/me

I have to agree with A Cook and the rest of you. I humbly apologize for the fact that I made a comment rather than a review. First day on Epicurious and once burned, twice learned. Will try to make that same mistake again.

It's not fair to rate a recipe poorly because you can't find the squash. Be resourceful and use what you DO have. I find this recipe ingenious. I LOVE the different textures and flavors and find the fattiness of the pork to be perfect with the acidity of the pickle and crunch of the pumpkin seeds. Will be a great addition to any fall table!

I agree with Nancy and ACook... Haven't heard of radishes and kale? Why are you even bothering with Epicurious? Get a life! be adventurous! Quit wingeing and make something new (and delicious... go to wikipedia and find out what radishes are!

Tisheen--that is the stupidest most useless review I have ever seen.

Too many ingredients that I have never heard of and probably could not find in my area. The only squash on here that I have heard of is the hubbard. Obviously I did not make it.
