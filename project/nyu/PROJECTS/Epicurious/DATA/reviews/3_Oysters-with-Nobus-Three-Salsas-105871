I made this recipe for my roommates and it was a success. I would recommend placing all ingredients in a food processor to make each salsa. I makes it easier and a great way to spread over oysters. Big Hit!

I made all three salsas. The one that got the rave reviews was the Matsuhisa salsa, which I will definitely make again. The others were fine, but I probably wouldn't make again.

I made the Matsuhisa salsa and served it on oysters on the half shell as well as chilled poached scallops. It was very easy to make for such a complexity of flavors. I can't wait to try the other salsas.
