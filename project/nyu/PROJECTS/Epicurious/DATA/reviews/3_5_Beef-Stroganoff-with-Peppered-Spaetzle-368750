Delicious recipe. The spaetzle were messy to make, but well worth it - they were light and delicate. I did cut the sugar by 1/2 on the shallot marmalade. I will definitely make this again.

I thought this was fabulous and so did all 9 of my Xmas eve guests. I used cremini mushrooms instead of black trumpet, and I did not use all of the shallot marmalade. It is really, really sweet. This dish was phenomenal and I would make it again in a heartbeat. It came out perfectly, and I am an amateur.

I like to make complex dishes, so I wasn't put off by the number of steps. It wasn't really that hard to make. I just didn't like it very much, especially the sweet and sour shallots. Also, the grapeseed oil was never fully incorporated into the mushroom puree. I thought the pepper in the spaetzle would be overpowering, but I liked it. However, the spaetzle were slightly mushy---maybe because sour cream was used instead of water. And anyway, I think noodles would have been a better choice. Did like the peppered creme fraiche. I have discovered that I prefer a simpler stroganoff.

Making this took all day and it's clear the recipe was written by someone w/a kitchen staff. It also made a ton of food that couldn't be accommodated by my largest pan. Tasty, which is good since there was so, so much. For the work I'm not sure it was worth it.

First, let me say that I did prepare this recipe. I, also, enjoy diversity and like deconstructing and recreating traditional recipes. This recipe, IMO, misses the mark by a mile. The marmalade is cloyingly sweet and distracting; the black trumpet puree was very expensive and turned the sauce an unappetizing gray, and while it did not take much time to prepare, it was fussy and overly complicated. The spaetzel, I believe, was not an appropriate starch to serve with this dish  wide noodles or, as with many stroganoff dishes prepared in Russia, fried potatoes provide a way to scoop up the sour cream sauce. The spaetzel just doesnt cut it. I lived in Russia and Eastern Europe for almost 2 decades and have eaten many variations of stroganoff  it is a simple, uncomplicated and inexpensive dish. While Chef Elliot may, of course, call his creation anything he wants, it bears little resemblance to or taste of stroganoff. Why not throw in the kitchen sink and be done with it?

First of all, ignore all the comments from the people who didn't even try this recipe. Second, no matter how long this meal takes to cook it is TOTALLY WORTH IT! This is probably one of the best meals I've ever had at home or at a restaurant. This recipe can take awhile with all the chopping but you can make the spaetzle and marmalade the day before so it will help speed up the process the day of. It was my first time making spaetzle and I used a spaetzle maker I bought for 15 bucks at a local store. It is surprisingly very easy to make. No fuss or time at all. The mushroom puree is AMAZING. All my guests raved about it. I used Crimini mushrooms to save on cost but did splurge on the truffle oil. It was to die for. The sweetness of the shallot marmalade mixed with the peppered spaetzle is delicious. Overall, one of my favorite recipes so far. Seriously, try it. Why even bother to listen to people who haven't? My guests kept saying "outstanding" as they ate.

This only seems like a big deal because they break every single step up in the ingredients. It took me around 40 minutes, which is nothing compared to the pay off. I'm noticing the comments getting very uptight these days. I for one love the diversity of this site.

I am so sick of people on this website reviewing recipes they haven't even tried! This recipe is amazing, and worth every minute of effort.

This was actually amazing and not nearly as fussy as the recipe seems. I started the mushrooms and while those were cooking, made up the creme fraiche (which is just mixing pepper and cream), and then made up the shallot marmalade while the steaks cooked. Took a total of 30 minutes without making the spaetzle (used egg noodles instead). I really recommend trying it!

Stroganoff? Was this recipe written by Ralph Wiggum? Half-pound steaks, black trumpet mushroom puree, creme fraiche, spaetzle, shallot marmalade? Good Grief.

Agree with the previous reviewers. You cannot tell me this recipe is worth the work. Surely, indeed, you do jest.
