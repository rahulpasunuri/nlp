The only reason I give it 3 forks is because I haven't tried this pastry recipe. I just make the filling using a different almond pastry recipe. The filling is scrumptious. I have made it many times, and my husband has even started making it.

just wanted to note that I used whipping cream and regular white flour, and had excellent results - no clumps!

Delicious, easy, and exquisite tart - exactly like the ones I used to buy on Sunday mornings on Blvd Raspail in Paris from the Marché Biologique...or actually even better! I recommend two small changes - I not only sprinkle ground almonds on the crust as recommended to keep it from getting soggy, but actually add some to the tart dough as well (about 1/4 cup - adds a nice flavor). The first time I baked the tart as is, but wanted a sweeter custard, so I upped the quantity of honey in the filling to 4 Tbs the second time and that was more to my liking. A lovely dessert - irresistible!

The best fresh apricot recipe I've tried so far. I've been using local apricots and eggs and it is swooningly good. I made some individual ones in small tart pans and they were beautiful and delicious. Yum! I'm just sad that the local apricots are almost gone.

This was delicious... the combination of almond and apricot is a match made in heaven. The crust was a little too thick for my taste... but good tasting and crunchy. I only had a few apricots so I halved them and did not overlap them but simply arranged them evenly over custard. I thought it was plenty of fruit. I am going to try this recipe with a pate brisee crust. I live at a high altitude and baked this at 375...

I've made this twice now, once with cream and once with creme fraiche, and must say it is worth paying more and using the creme fraiche. It adds a depth of flavor that works so well with the apricots and just takes the tarte to a whole new level.

Excellent. Where to start? I used cake flour instead of Wondra per previous. It turned out OK but I should probably have sifted it. Very small clumps. Where the crust was thick, it was a bit tough. Take some dough out rather than have it too thick. The halved apricots make a nice presentation but because they were very tart (and good), maybe use slices as another suggested. Finally, a little more custard would have been nice so maybe increase the dairy and the flavorings proportionally.

This recipe is fabulous and everyone loves the shortbread crust. I used heavy cream. One thing however, I did find I have better results using cake flour as opposed to Wondra. When I used Wondra for some reason, the tart never set completely, but when I used cake flour it came out perfect.

My low rating is because of the crust which tasted more like under-baked cookie dough, and in my opinion was too sweet for the filling. I thought the creme fraiche filling was really delicious and unusual and I will definitely use it again instead of the usual custard filling. I toasted the almonds first which gave it a nice taste.

Rating: 4
A very rare 4 stars from me, but holy moly this is delicious. The only thing I changed was to omit the almond extract, never liked it. And honestly the crust could be more crispy instead of chewy, but the filling is just perfect. Yum!

Rating: 3
Very good and pretty. Unfortunately, it was a little bitter as I believe not all the apricots were ripe. I think it would adapt well to other fruits. It was a very easy crust to make and a nice change not to have to use and wash all the equipment you normally would with a pate brisee or similar pie crust! I made the recipe exactly as stated, using creme fraiche.

My Dad brought home a huge box of apriums (apricot/plum crosses) yesterday that a customer had given to him. We don't really care for apricots OR plums at my house, so I went hunting for a good recipe and I found the best one here! I didn't change the recipe at all save for using 3/4 C heavy cream instead of 1/2 C and added a few extra tablespoons of ground almonds to the crust. Absolutely exquisite flavor and the smell! Oh, the beautiful wondrous smell! Thank you so much for posting and I will DEFINITELY make this again. In fact, I'm making it again tomorrow, since I still have about four pounds of aprium left.

Rating: 4
this is as good as everyone is saying. a few things: - the crust is very easy to manipulate into a tart pan. - you can really taste the salt in the crust. it adds a nice flavour note - if you use 3/4 cup of whipping cream it will bring the filling about 3/4 of the way up the crust. 1 cup will bring it almost all the way there. - you can't use too much fruit in this recipe. i usually use 6 or 7 pink lady apples.

Rating: 4
Outstanding! I did not have whipping cream or creme fraiche and used light sour cream instead. Since it was just for my husband and myself, I halved the recipe and made it in a 6" springform pan. It will be on my table many times in the future.

Just gorgeous and the crust is a keeper as many have mentioned. This will be standard when apricots are available.

Delicious, and so simple! The crust has become my standard -easy to make, keeps its form and has great stand-up crunch and flavor.

I have reviewed this recipe before. This time I made the crust as well, and yes, it is marvelous. I accidentally added the ground almonds to the crust. After all, it says "add remaining ingredients." Only then do you find that you are supposed to sprinkle the almonds over the crust. So, I did both. Mixed them in and sprinkled over. Anyway, it came out great. I will say, however, that I had to make and add about half again the amount of filling. I also put my apricots cut side down and did not overlap them. It came out very pretty. Love it and 4 forks for sure!

What is the correct quantity of creme fraiche to use: 1/2 cup or 250 ml (about 1 cup) - there is obviously an error in conversion of cups into metric in this recipe.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful! Great made with fresh peaches, nectarines, plums and cherries as well. Very easy to make and everyone loves it, even the kids.

Love, love, love this recipe! I've made it many times. I also use the crust for many different tarts--so easy and it really maintains the crunch--even with more custard-y tarts.

I have tried many tart recipes and this is the best. I belong to a local CSA farm and I received 2 lbs of apricots this week...so I started searching for tart ideas. I read all the reviews and decided to modify the recipe with 2 tblsp of almonds in the crust and another 1/2 cup on the crust after the first bake. I also used 7.5 ounces of creme fraiche which worked well for a deeper cream layer. I cut the apricots into slices and layed them in the cream to make a circle pattern. My guests loved it.

This recipe is easy and a favorite at my house, especially in June when apricots are in season.

Rating: 0
There is a discrepancy in the stated quantity of creme fraiche/cream in the tart filling: 1/2 cup is NOT equal to 25 cl; its equivalent metric volume is 12.5 cl or 125 ml (1 cup is about 25 cl or 250 ml). So, which quantity of the dairy is the right one to use in this recipe: 1/2 cup or 1 cup?

I know this recipe and am thrilled to find it written somewhere. When I worked at a hotel in Berne, Switzerland in 1974, this was eaten often for lunch. A friend' mother would make it for me on my day off because to me it was just an incredible treat! And to be able to eat it for lunch! It's also very good with fresh whipped cream. You can also make it just on a cookie sheet and you cut it up in rectangles with a pizza cutter. Absolutely my favorite! It also works with plums - the kind that are a very dark bluish-purple - but the apricot is the best.

Delicious. Do not skip the crust, it really makes the dish. Wonderful almond flavor. The apricots were on the tart side, which balances out the richness nicely.

Don't used pie crust. That takes away from the wonderful buttery cookie texture of the tart. It was like being in France - very good!

Superb! I was missing a few ingredients, and so substitued regular flour for Wondra, clover honey for flavored honey, and yogurt with sour cream for creme fraiche and it still came out beautifully. I also used about 1/2 c of almonds on top of the crust and it was just yummy!

Fresh home grown apricots along with a not too sweet crust and filling make a wonderful dessert. I substituted cream cheese for the crème fraiche (trouble digesting cream). The result was wonderful. I even made the crust and filling ahead of time. I assembled just before guests arrived and baked it before dinner. Yum.

Made this Saturday and consumed this entirely. Yes, we liked it. Have made it with plums and peaches and today is only Tuesday. I choose not to include the almond extract in the crust and filling. Substituted ¼ C (36g) almond meal for flour and added a bit more to dust with. Quality and ripeness of fruit is important. Tis the season to enjoy the fruits. Enjoy.

I religiously make this tart every summer during apricot season. Tastes like ambrosia of the gods, looks divinely beautiful, and is magically simple to make (no need to peel fruit!). Everyone loves this, from kids to mother-in-law.

This is probably the best tarte I have tasted; of course, it's French ! Subtle, surprising and memorable; it wows all who taste it.The hint of almond and the lavender honey are the secrets. Who would think of that in an apricot tarte? Now that it is apricot season and our tree is flush with fruit I will make at least 3 of these tartes for dinner parties. I am thrilled to have this great recipe in my repetoire, especially since we have so many apricots each summer. Thanx Epicurious !

Hard to screw up! Part of this was the way the recipe was worded. I added the ground almonds to the pie crust dough before realizing it went on top.But I added another 2 T. on top, then I carelessly added all 7.5 oz. of the package of creme fraiche instead of the 4 oz. required. Didn't matter! Made it EVEN MORE DELICIOUS, probably. It looked gorgeous, got rave reviews, and this recipe will become a party menu staple in my house!

The best tart recipe for apricots, plums, peaches, and probably other fruits. Homey and elegant and not much trouble at all. Don't roll the pastry out- just pat it in the pan and chill, then bake.

This is a recipe that could only come from France. Its delicate flavors and understated presence highlighting the delicate flavors of the fruit itself are beyond any commercialized recipes I've found in my many cookbooks here. This is the best tart I have ever made. It is not goopy or egg-laden. Not too sweet and very memorable because of an unsual combo of flavored honey and almond extract, the 'secret' ingredients. Hands down, this is a five *****star recipe in my book and all my guests raved about this tart on the same scale. I will make it again and again; today I will use peaches . Bravo to Epicurious for securing this precious treasure!!!!

VERY tasty and easy! My family and boyfriend loved it, esp the sugar-cookie crust. I had to add about 3 tsp water to the dough bc it was a bit dry, and I baked for the full 60 minutes. The apricots I used were really ripe, so they weren't shockingly tart. For anyone who wants a sweeter tart, you could use a dif fruit I guess. Best right out of the oven. It's fine the day after but I wouldn't go too much longer. Toasting leftover slices gets rid of some of the leftover sogginess. Also, a 16th of the tart comes to about 4.5 WW pts (if you care about calories).

This tart is a wonderful combination of sweet and sour, creamy and crunchy. Yes, the apricots are very tart indeed, but if sweeter it would make the tart too rich. The crust is so good that I've made tiny cookies out of it. Relatively simple to make with a very elegant presentation. Many other fruits could be used instead of the apricots, just adjust the extracts to correspond to the fruit. This recipe actually made it into my personal recipe file (and only the very best do).

A perfect dessert - simple and elegant at the same time. The fact that it can only be made during the short time that apricots are in season makes it all the more special. I look forward to baking this tart every June.

I did not read the recipe carefully, and put the ground almonds into the pastry dough, but luckily had enough ground almonds to put on the bottom. It turned out wonderfully and the essence of the almonds just made the dessert delicious. A sure keeper!

I thought this apricot tart was wonderful. The first slice shocked me a little as the apricots were really tart--so be prepared. The next day I heated a slice and added a scoop of Vanilla Bean ice cream. The sweet from the ice cream and the tart from the apricots was divine. I used a glass tart dish and it worked just fine.

This is my favorite recipe and also great to bring as a dinner party guest. It is easy, lovely to look at and travels well due to the thick tart shell. I have tried the recipe with other fruit as well and while nice tart apricots are best (and great with a few raspberries added for color and sweetness) nectarines, sliced, work well too.

Maybe a 3.5? Pretty simple (though getting the crust into the pan took patience) and looked like something from a French bakery. But my apricots were too tart, so I'd try it with other fruit -- maybe peaches or plums? I loved the almond taste in the crust and custard.

I didn't make the filling for this tart, but I use the pastry recipe all the time. It holds its shape very well like a very firm sugar cookie. Be sure to spread the dough very thin or it will come out too hard.

I went to Verlet on a rainy afternoon and actually ate this very tart along with their excellent cup of coffee. They served it along with sprinkling of chopped toasted almond. I made this recipe a while ago and it sends me back to that rainy afternoon in Paris. It is very easy and quick, I added the toasted almond as well.
