This salad was a huge hit - so tasty! I used brown basmati rice instead of white, and found it gave good texture, as well as eliminating the need for the "drying" step. I also substituted a couple ounces (2-3) of shaved grana padano when I totally forgot to get feta. It was FABULOUS. The delicate dressing really makes it, and it's even tastier the next day. Yum.

AMAZING SALAD.. I made this when it first came out and it is still a summertime favorite. So nice with grilled meats or seafood. Gets rave reviews from meat eaters and vegans alike. If you don't have lemon, use lime which I actuall prefer since the first time I made it, I didn't have lemon and used lime!

This is a pretty good salad.The only problems are that it is Greek and you need to put a lot of feta in it,and also it costs a lot of money.It's a money-taking salad.It costs like from $25-$35.Depens on what you buy.Non-organic or organic.That's a lot of money!!!But the result is very good.This is a yummy Greek salad,except for the fact that it has so much feta 16 ounces that's a lot!!! I made it with 14 ounces but it still seemed too much.I think 5-8 ounces will be good for an American.

I made this at the end of a very hot day and it came out really good. I just followed the recipe, but used less feta as I didn't have enough. Very refreshing and delicious on a warm night.

We fixed this for a picnic and it was a hit with everyone. We only put in 12 oz. of feta and thought that was fine. Like others have said - this makes a LOT! We ended up with a large mixing bowl full when the recipe was finished. One note - I would cook the rice the traditional way instead - following these directions we ended up with a stickier rice than I think is appropriate for this kind of salad.

I have been making this salad since it first appeared in 2003 and it is just delicious -- guests gobble it up and demand the recipe! I think it's best in the summer with grilled lamb, other grilled meats. I have substituted lime for the lemon when I didn't have lemon (and it was good!) and tried orzo, which is good but not as good as the long grained white rice. A delicious, refreshing mix of ingredients that never fails to disappear at the first sitting!!

great salad. substituted orzo for rice and lime for lemon to complement the mojitos we were enjoying (or is it the other way around?). was a hit with our potluck hosts and their guests.

Wonderful flavor, but it's a bit fussy to prepare given all the citrus peel required. I added a bit more mint and lemon juice than required, but I suspect the amounts will always differ depending on the strength of the mint and the juices.

This is a great salad, adding depth to any meal. I have made it several times, used wild rice in additional to white-- the colors are spectacular. The range of flavors is appealing. Lots of compliments.

Not so good. Was looking forward to this salad but it has pretty much no flavor and that's with adding more juice etc.

I substituted orzo as one cook suggested. It was delicious - perfect summer salad for a buffet (makes alot!). Would recommend cutting down on feta if you're not a huge fan. 1 lb. is a little overpowering.

This recipe wasn't my favorite, although there was nothing wrong with it, I'm just not a huge fan of feta. My husband really enjoyed it, though. It's a perfect light summer salad, so I'll keep it in my collection, but it's not one I'll be craving anytime soon.

I used Basmati rice (because I'm trying to work my way through a 10-pound tub before it expires next year) which added some subtle additional flavor. I did not like the cinnamon at all though. I eat a lot of Greek food and although I like using cinnamon in tomato-based sauces, I felt the cinnamon flavor in this salad was distracting. Will definitely omit next time (the mint, on the other hand, killed).

My dinner guests raved over this. I substituted orzo for the rice and increased the feta and really liked it. Made it 8 hours in advance then stirred before serving which really melded the flavors. A perfect summer salad!

This is a great summer salad! It was a hit with my Greek crowd!! I agree that the mint should not be omitted. I too reserved some of the dressing for right before serving. The cinnamon and citrus make a beautiful contrast with the salt of the feta cheese.

This got a so-so respose at my house. As other reviewers mentioned, it makes way more than 10 servings - and the left-overs went untouched. I found it pleasant, but not special. I probably won't bother to make it again.

this is the best salad for picnics, no mayo, and it is easy and can be made the day before, I held back a little dressing, so the rice wouldn't absorb it all, and then topped it off just before serving.

I was worried about the dressing, but it was delicious once incorporated w/ the rice and veggies. The mint makes the salad, so don't omit. Regular cuc's work too. Next time I might try adding orange or yellow bell pepper. If you have picky eaters, serve the feta on the side for those who want it. Dish holds up well for leftovers, since I also found that the recipe serves closer to 20.

Great summer salad. I skipped the mint though!

This makes an enormous batch. I prepared it for a party of 10, as suggested in the recipe, but it would have easily served 30. It is refreshing and delightful, and probably esssential to use fresh, unpasteurized orange juice. I had never used pickling cucumbers before, but found they were crisp, cool and juicy to the bite, much more so than regular cucumbers. I mixed the salad the day before I served at a luncheon, except for the tomatoes, which I don't like to refrigerate, and it came great, as it was the next day, and the next day, and the day after that.

This is just a great refreshing summer salad that is tasty with any of your fish or chicken dishes, I didn't change anything and we've had it several times to rave reviews!
