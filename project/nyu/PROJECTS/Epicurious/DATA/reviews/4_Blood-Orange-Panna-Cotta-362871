I made this dessert to impress a guest and it worked. The blood orange juice gives it a nice tart flavour, and the dark red syrup over the pink panna cotta made a beautiful presentation. I served it in ramekins & it made 4 servings.

A Full disclosure - I love Panna Cotta and will test any Panna Cotta recipe when I see one!! Blood Oranges just started showing up at Farmers Market in Southern California within the last two weeks; and I made this recipe three times already. The blood orange gives this Panna Cotta a unique lightness with citrus flavor that is almost addictive. I did not find the syrup particularly good; so for the second batch, I served it with blood orange segments sprinkle with some sugar instead; and found it to better compliment the panna cotta. This is definitely a keeper.

The flavor was good but it made barely a quarter cup per serving (I'd say it serves two people instead of six). Also, reducing the sauce to 6 tablespoons ends up being only about 2 tablespoons once you've strained it (really thick molasses consistency when reduced to 6 tbl). Don't let it reduce quite so much. I had to add water to thin it out a bit.
