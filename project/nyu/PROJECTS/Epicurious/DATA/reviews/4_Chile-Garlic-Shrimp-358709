I didn't have everything called for...mainly the chilies, and didn't want to run out. I made some changes and it was fantastic. I used a mixture of siracha sauce and soy and then completed the rest of the recipe the same. A hit!

Thesee were some of the tastiest shrimp I have ever had! The garlic carmalized giving them a wonderful sweetness contrasting with the chiles. Will be doing these again and again.

Fantastic! Made about 3/4 lb. of shrimps with 3 thai bird chilis , most seeds removed. fiery hot but so delicious. Didn't have brandy so used whiskey. The only way to ruin shrimps is to cook them to death. These were great.(I had to eat most of them because they were too hot for my dinner date....I don't mind)Next time, less chilies.

We had Fins and skins poker night, and i made these for the table, they didnt last 5 minutes. Very good recipe and versitile as you can use other spices to make them run with flavors. Good one for a crab anb mudbug boil!! Poker guys give this a thumbs up on easy to do and flavor.
