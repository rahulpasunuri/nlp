after i read the reviews - I decided to tweak it, as i did not have all the ingredients. I did OJ without the sugar, did not want it to be too sweet. boiled the cranberry and oj, then added 1/2 jalapeno with seeds and 1 med. size shallots. to tone the spiciness at the end i added a couple drops of honey. delicious everybody loved it.... will definitely make it again, will add try to add the hazelnut and the cilantro next time.....Delish!!! Bon Appetit

I served this for Christmas Eve dinner with a spice-rubbed pork tenderloin (I believe that recipe was from Cooking Light) and bourbon creamed corn (recipe here on Epicurious). The combination was wonderfully flavorful! This salsa is quite sweet, so would make a nice counterpoint to any kind of spice rubbed meat (particularly if your spice rub is strong, salty or peppery. We loved it and will absolutely make it for future holiday meals.

This salsa was a wonderful alternative to usual thanksgiving cranberry compote. All my guests loved it, as did I. It was the perfect combination of sweet and tart with a little added zing! A keeper for sure!

What a wonderful alternative to the typical cranberry compote! I followed the recipe to the tee and it turned out perfectly. Everyone raved at my southwestern themed thanksgiving this year, but some where especially complimentary on this salsa. Absolutely fantastic, it was the perfect combination of sweet and tart with just a bit of zing!

This salsa is fantastic. It's great with chips, or in a tortilla with leftover turkey. I subbed pecans for the hazelnuts, added a jalepeno and a little garlic, and it was still a big hit. I always get several requests for the recipe every time I make this.

This "new" dish stands alongside the old family favorites at Thanksgiving. Try alongside the Grilled Turkey with Ancho Chile Salsa and the Chipotle Whippped Sweet Potatoes for a Southwest theme.

I have been making this salsa since Nov.1997. And it is still a big hit every year.

I have made this the last several years and it has now become a tradition.

this just rocked for thanksgiving this year! i grilled our turkey and this was perfect - especially roasting the 2 peppers over the charcoal rather than a gas flame - there's not 4 forks tho cause the amount of cilantro in the receipe just wasn't enough - i used almost a full cup - using my food processor to chop the cranberries and hazelnuts (prior to toasting) made this a snap!

This recipe was my cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving and the crunchy texture was a nice change of pace from the traditional style. I substituted a jalapeno as finding a poblano proved to be impossible here in CT. Also used pecans just because I like them better! The cilantro with the cranberries was a great flavor combo!

I made this the day before minus the cilantro, orange peel and hazelnuts and then added those just before serving as an appetizer for Thanksgiving. This is great with chips. I made cactus margaritas with prickly pear syrup and it was GREAT. I was surprised that it didn't really work with dinner even though I made the Achiote Turkey from this site. So I think I would serve it in the future as a great holiday salsa with chips. Also it tastes great without the hazelnuts too.

This was great! Very easy to make and quite delicious.

This is a attractive and tasty salsa, but preparing it took considerably more time than I anticipated. I suspect there are equally delicious and easier recipes out there, and I'll keep looking...

I wanted something different than the traditional cranberry sauce, it was perfect, sweet with a kick to it

I thought this recipe was perfect. It was the best cranberry sauce I've ever had (or made, for that matter). I probably used about 2 1/2 cups of fresh cranberries, and about 1/3 a cup of sugar.

Thanksgiving 1999: this side dish was a great hit. i won't wait a full year to try this one again. Texture, color and taste were all surperb and festive.

The recipe is too sweet: 1/2 cup sugar is way too much. I had to cut this with fresh juice from 1/2 lemon. Further, while the salsa retains the flavor of the plobano, it has none of the warmth - all piquancy is lost while the salsa sits refrigerated. While there is no virtue in hot-for-hot's-sake, there should be a little zing when using a poblano. I added 12 drops of tabasco sauce, and by the time I served the salsa (two hours later), the tabasco had mellowed so that the salsa created a warmth enfusing the mouth. I would substitute 4 - 6 roasted jalapenos, cut the sugar to no more then 1/3 cup, and would add the juice of 1/2 lemon.

This dish has been the cranberry-based "star" of several Thanksgiving gatherings for the last several years; it has been served as as appetizer (with chips)as well as a relish with the bird. Using anaheim peppers will tone it down a bit for the meek of heart. Have been asked repeatedly for the recipe. A real tasty gem! Thanks.
