My aunt is a creme brulee lover, so for her birthday I decided to give this a try. I was worried about how thin the custard was before baking, but it was still where it needed to be at 35 minutes. I did cheat a bit--I used a store bought pie crust and used the broiler to brulee instead of buying a torch. The biggest thing I had to watch with that was not burning the crust in the baking--thanks to whoever invented pie crust shields, because they were super necessary. Anyways, this dessert got raves. Like, people's eyes were rolling back in their heads because they thought it was that awesome raves. And it's a good thing, too. She'd gone to dinner and gotten a subpar creme brulee beforehand that was disappointing. Everyone loved how you got to crack the sugar with every bite!

Delicious! Didn't change a thing, for once.

Wow. This recipe is just wonderful. As I was making the filling, I added about one cup of fruit juice and cooked it just a little bit until it was thick. I baked it off and it came out just perfect. I honestly could not believe how delicious it was! This is literally something to dream about.

Great recipe - very lush and creamy and burning the sugar at the table is a crowd pleaser. Particularly nice if your doing a big dinner because it has all the flavor of regular creme brulee but was less work to make. I used a good store bought pie crust to save work/time and it turned out awesome.

Very easy and very delicious, though I had to add more than 2 tbsp of sugar to get the caramel right. The crust is exceptionally good as well. Made one day ahead, and caramelized just before serving.

tasted delicious and was a snap to make :)

QUESTION: will this tart hold up well if I bake it and refrigerate the night before I am going to serve it and brulee the top just before serving

i did not have a blowtorch so i wrapped the crust in foil to keep it from burning and threw the whole thing under the broiler for about 2 minutes and it came out well so I would do that if you don't have everything

This is a fantastic recipe. I brough it to a "foodie" Thanksgiving potluck and even with all the competition, it was voted best dessert. IF you follow the recipe exactly (no, the broiler rack does not count as brulee) and wait to cramelize the sugar until righ before serving its perfect. It is a bit labor intensive, but its worth all the extra steps, if you cut corners, the tart will suffer.

The pastry is very good but the filling is just OK. Very eggy at room temperature; better chilled. Since there were only 3 of us to eat it, I only bruleed a quarter of the tart and put the rest in the fridge. It held up pretty well.

can this be "bruleed" under the broiler instead?

This recipe was terrific for a Bistro inspired birthday party. Used a premade crust and served this with Chantilly Cream and it was a hit.

An excellent recipe, so easy. I needed almost double the water for the pastry, which turned out buttery and crisp. I used a slightly smaller pan and so it required about 12 minutes longer in the oven. Really a show stopper with very little work and clean up. Not one slice left but I think that this tart will not refrigerate well after serving. Beautiful with fresh raspberries.

I'm not much of a baker but I'd like to try this. Does anyone know if this would work with a pre-made frozen tart shell?

This recipe was perfect - I would not change a single thing!

Great taste, just like the traditional French dessert, but with another layer of flavor and texture. And yes, add the filling to the crust once the crust is placed in the oven. You will not spill anything as you would by bringing a "loaded" pie crust into the oven.

You put it in the over first, so you don't spill the filling.Tart pans are notorious for spilling because of the removeable bottom.

If you put the shallow shell into the oven prior to filling, you're less likely to spill..

I don't know about this recipe -- it says "Put in oven, then pour custard into shell". ?? Am I confused or is that completely backwards?
