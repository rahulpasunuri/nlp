I chopped up all the veggies and tossed them with 3/4 tsp black pepper as written. TheyMyappleid420 were a little too spicy for the anal people aka relatives I cooked for. They pretty much refused to eat it. I thought it was great. The vinaigrette was delicious! I will not make it again for the family. Maybe half the amount of pepper would have been better.

I made this using zucchini, grape tomatoes, portabella mushrooms, green bell peppers, and red onion. The vinaigrette was very nice, although I used red wine vinegar instead of white wine vinegar. Overall, very tasty. I would grill vegetables this way again.

I love vegetable kebabs. this is a really nice and easy recipe and the vinaigrette is a perfect salad dressing if you have left overs. I totally wowed my family even though it was so easy.

The presentation of the veggie skewers was quite lovely, one type of vegetable per skewer. HOWEVER, the dressing did not harmonize with the veg. Maybe it was the vinegar, but it didn't really work. Next time, I'll only use olive oil and S&P. They looked beautiful though.

Simple and delicious, used everything but the eggplant, thought the recipe was perfect. Great with beer can chicken and grilled corn on the cob!

We no longer use skewers to grill veggies. We purchased a grill pan with lots of little holes in it to get the charred flavor and look, but without the hassle of skewering each and every vegetable.

This was a perfect accompanyment to my barbecued ribs. I used a little extra olive oil on the zucchini and eggplant. I soaked my wooden skewers well and didn't have a problem with scorching. Turning the skewers on the grill was a little tricky. I will use two skewers for each kabob next time. The veggies were very tasty and plated beautifully. All family members agreed that this recipe is a keeper.

Drizzling the vingarette on the freshly roasted veggies made them really stand out. However, I used wooden skewers and won't do that again. Even soaking them for 30 minutes, many caught fire and/or broke which in the case of the zukes, they fell off the skewer. If you can, use metal skewers.

No where NEAR enough olive oil called for in the recipe, the eggplant and muchrooms soak it up too much. Also not enough skewers - I cut the veges up a little thicker than you called for and still needed a lot more.
