I really enjoyed this salad, didn't give it 4 forks because i couldn't completely sell it to the fiance (he didn't think there was enough meat). I doubled the dressing and actually chopped up a head of romaine and tossed it all together. I subbed chili-garlic sauce, with a squeeze of sriracha. Next time though I think I'd use half the onion and/or really mince it. A whole cups worth packed a huge punch and overpowered the dish.

This recipe was a great way to use leftover turkey. The chili-garlic sauce turned the avocado an ugly color, but the taste was fairly good. I will keep this recipe in mind next time I have leftover turkey to use.

This was a refreshing meal. I wrapped it into a tortilla wrap and it was perfect. I changed it up a bit and put in granny smith apples instead of jicama. I also would recommend putting more than a cup of apples...it needs a bit of sweetness. I also put more lime juice and chili sauce. You can substitute parsley for cilantro. I would certainly make this again!

I liked the salad, but the dressing was too thick, like guacamole. Tasted ok.

This was a very nice change from the usual turkey salad with mayo based dressing. The jicama adds a nice crunch. I made extra dressing because it did not look moist enough when everything was mixed together.

This is such a simple salad and you can add other ingredients - whatever you have on hand.

Excellent taste and presentation. I love the avacado and turkey combination.

I cannot source jicama and maple-honey turkey in Denmark, so I replaced them with jerusalem artichoke and rotisserie chicken, respectively. It was refreshing, delicious and a snap to make.

I really liked this. I made the dressing as suggested. I didn't add the jicama - not sure how toddlers would react to it - but liked it very much. I nice change

A quick and tasty salad; Added a bit more lime juice; Cut back on the red onion by half

I was really disappointed! It wasn't BAD, it just wasn't WOW. It didn't have enough dressing for the Romaine lettuce, and lacked flavor. I ended up wishing I had used my own chicken/turkey salad recipe. Maybe it was just too "healthy"!

This was good for lunch, and I loved the crunch of the jicama. However, it really wouldn't do it as a main dinner course.

So easy to make, what a breeze. I loved the dressing especially. Next time I might cut down on the jicama--seemed like too much crunch. Liked the idea of adding corn, too. Wonder how black beans would do? I don't like maple honey turkey, so I used plain turkey, was still tasty.

Wow. What an easy dish with so much flavor. I used pre-cooked chicken instead of the turkey because that's what I had in the freezer. I also threw in fresh corn that I had left over from the night before. Delicious. Love the dressing, spicy and fresh. Easy, fast and good.

What a delightful suprise this recipie is! Just had it at an officers luncheon for the wives! The Generals' wife told me she always gets her recipies from Bon Appetit. The flavors in this turkey salad just "pop" in your mouth.

We loved the salad! We like our food spicy so we added more chili-garlic sauce and loved the kick.

Made this exactly as written. My husband and I both loved it, and he has asked for it again. Dressing is complex, salad is smokey and crunchy. Try it!

This was okay - I was suprised my husband actually ate it. The cilantro is a bit overpowering, and the chili garlic sauce was very over powering (I'd cut this to 1/2 t. and add more to get to your desired spice level). It was just okay - I won't make it again.

This dish was really satisfying - the avocado is rich, the turkey is smoky, and the jicama is completely refreshing.
