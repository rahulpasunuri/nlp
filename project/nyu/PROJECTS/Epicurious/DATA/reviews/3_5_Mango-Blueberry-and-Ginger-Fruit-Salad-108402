Sensational! An excellent summer fruit salad. I did not make the syrup. Instead, I zested and juiced one large lime and added about 1 TB sugar. A couple of observations: ripe mangos are important otherwise more sugar will be needed. Needs to macerate for several hours or overnight. (BTW, Nigella omits the ginger and adds pomegranate to this, but pomes and mangos are not in season at the same time. Go figure.)

Good but not great. The flavors did not seem to sing but it was certainly refreshing and light. I'm wondering how you 'finely' chop and 'sprinkle' crystallized ginger? It stuck to my knife and itself...

Added a bit of lavender too. Terrific.

This makes a nice light ending to a summer luncheon. I had one slightly overripe mango and one slightly underripe and fresh, wild blueberries. It was better the second day, after the ginger soaked in.

A huge hit at the graduation party we attended this weekend. I substituted home-grown frozen blackberries for the blueberries.

whoa sour. Tastes great, but feel free to add more sugar, especially if you're a bit generous with the lime juice.

This has real potential, but I couldn't pull it off. Do not use frozen blueberries! I needed this for a large crowd and had to have 6C of blueberries. Blueberries were $5 for 4oz! I wasn't about to spend $60 on fresh blueberries!! Will try this again the right way when blueberries are in season.

This was delicious - and excellent and interesting blend of flavors. My 8-year-old actually drank the last bit of the lime sauce on his plate. I'd definitely make this again.

This is one of the best fruit salads I have ever made. the lime juice just brings out all the flavour. I often use watermelon as it crisps up nicely with kime juice and makes a stunning looking dish.

Great Combination of flavors. I also added some cantaloup, raspberries and green grapes for color variety. If you don't like sugary fruit salads, I'd recommend doing away with the syrup all together and instead combine 2 freshly squeezed limes, their zest, and 1/2 tpsn of finely grated fresh ginger (peeled). This allows for a fresher-tasting salad that lets the fruit really sing.

Oops! Wrong recipe review! Sorry about that. The fruit salad was delicious and couldn't be easier. The hardest bit of an easy recipe was zesting the limes and picking the used zest out of the syrup. Use a light hand with the syrup when you dress the salad - you may not need all of it, depending on the sweetness of the fruit. But the lime flavor should not be missed.

This makes a lovely, quite light dessert made with perfectly ripe mangoes from the Indian grocery. The crust was absolutely wonderful, made with unsweetened organic coconut, toasted in the oven. I was using a 10" tart pan, so I increased the crust recipe a bit and used a heavy hand on the filling ingredients. Used a scant two teaspoons of gelatin and with the extra cream and mango, it held together perfectly. You definitely need to chill the filling over ice and the finished tart in the fridge overnight to ensure that it sets up well. And keep it chilled until serving time, or it will melt.

To Alexandria VA, there is a difference between candied and crystallized ginger. Crystallized is soft, more like a soft gumdrop consistency, they sell it at Williams Sonoma.

Very light and refreshing--I loved it.

This was good. The syrup was too tangy for my family's taste. The second time I made it, I simply macerated the fruit in the sugar for a half hour, and then added the lime juice and ginger. Easier and a bit fresher tasting.

Rating: 3
I would make this dish again. It was a hit at a picnic I brought it to this summer. However, some people were not prepared for the spice of the candied ginger, so I suggest warning people or chopping the ginger very finely even though this maybe be difficult because the candied ginger is very hard.

I recommend substituting raspberries for the blueberries. This is perfect for a quick and (relatively) healthy dessert, but even better over vanilla ice cream...

I made this for a group of very particular people and it was the first thing to disappear. I love all three of the major ingredients and they compliment each other nicely. However, I will try using brown sugar for a slightly different twist when I make it tomorrow.

This was a great late spring dessert. Mangoes must be ripe, and blueberries should be as sweet as possible. Have always liked crystallized ginger with fruit desserts, and wasn't disappointed. Had the leftovers with breakfast. Still good.

Refreshing. Ripe mango is a must. Ginger and lime were sublime. Probably added too much sugar to the lime juice. I didn't follow the recipe amt though--it could have been more tart.

I made this for company and it was wonderful! I used a mixture of mango and peaches because the mangoes at the store were all hard as a rock. The blueberries were frozen. This was a unique taste...delicious.

It is considered by many that ginger complements fruits well. I suppose, London, that one would have to care for the flavour of ginger to enjoy this recipe. Perhaps that is why you thought it "ruined" the dish. However, since I lived (and ate) in London for 2 years, I feel qualified to posit that many Britons' comments regarding their sense of taste are perhaps to be taken with a grain of salt. Cheers.

This was just awful, the mango blueberry combo is good but the ginger ruined it. I'll use a good slug of dark rum next time with the lime juice and brown sugar.

I have made this both with and without the ginger, and substituted Nutrasweet for the sugar, as we are all dieting (sigh). It is best with dead ripe mangos, so you have to plan ahead a bit. It even wowed the guys at the truck plant, who are far from gourmet! We ate it for dessert, and for breakfast, as is.

I have made this recipe twice and both parties loved it! I thought it would be gross, but it wasn't. The ginger and lime are complimentary flavors. I haven't followed the recipe exactly either time. I just mix the lime and sugar until it tastes good. There weren't any ripe mangos, so I used peaches instead. Anyway, it is a great recipe however you make it!

My family loves this. As we are trying to go sugar free, I just use juice from fresh limes, some lime zest, 1/2 t ground ginger, & 1 t artificial sweetener. Mix this up (no cooking) and let mangos & blueberries marinade in juice mixture for at least 30 minutes. Quick, easy, & taste is fantastic.

Having been raised in Jamaica where both mangoes and ginger are flavors that are enjoyed growing up, and being a lover of blueberries, I decided to take a shot at the recipe (despite the conflicting comments). I followed a prior suggestion for halving the dish (which I later regretted :o), this dish was absolutely delicious and refreshing, there was none left at the end of dinner! I served it alone but would also consider using it as a topping for vanilla yogurt and/or vanilla ice cream. I thoroughly enjoyed this dish and would make it again. I would recommend that non-ginger lovers adjust the amount of ginger based on their taste/preference. The mangoes here were very sweet so I decided to pass on the sugar syrup as well.

I too left out the sugar syrup & found it sweet enough especially with very ripe mangoes. Just delicious!

I did make the syrup but only added enough to just coat the fruit. I thought it turned out wonderfully. The ginger gave the salad an interesting and original flavour. I think this would make a nice salad to serve with breakfast or for brunch.

this was fab.we did not make the sugar mix-just 2 limes -juice and peel.and we used splenda instead of sugar-1 pack think you could go with no sugar-fruit is sweet enough this was a huge hit with our dinner guests-the ginger gives it a special flavour

Forget the added sugar, the sweetness from the crystalized ginger is enough. I vote with just squeezing lime juice over the fresh fruit. Really great combination.

Loved the "idea" of this recipe but the syrup was too much work for the result (and I love complicated recipes). It was definitely too sweet. Next time I'll be taking other reviewers' suggestions and squeezing fresh lime juice over the fruit. I'll add sugar only if absolutely necessary. Ginger was too much for my taste so I'd use an easy hand and taste as you go. But having said all that, the salad was gorgeous. The lime and ginger nicely complement the fabulous fruit.

Whoops! Sorry, I responded on the wrong recipe. Please excuse me.

This is a wonderful fruit salad for dessert, and for breakfast or a side dish if you like the sweetness. Cook from San Francisco, I wouldn't flat out tell others not to use 1/4 cup of crystallized ginger. It's a matter of personal taste. We bought especially good, fresh crystallized ginger which was the best we've had and so that proportion was absolutely fine this time. Are you all confusing regular fresh ginger with crystallized ginger? Mangoes and blueberries are a great flavor combination, and beautiful, too.

This was easy and fast. I had a bunch of keylimes so I grated six or so for zest instead of peeling and then used their juice. I also will cut down on the amount of water and sugar--too much syrup for this in my opinion and I'd prefer more lime taste). I used about a tablespoon of ginger and minced it finely in the processor and threw it in with the syrup just before I poured it on.

I made this dish two days ago for dessert but I cut it in half as there was just my husband and myself. I used a firm mango and one and 1/2 cups of blueberries with 1/8 cup of crystalized ginger. I took the advice of the cook from San Francisco and just used two heaping tablespoons of sugar and the juice of one fresh squeezed lime only. I mixed it all up, covered and refrigerated it for the afternoon. It was sensational and I don't think I will ever go the whole nine yards and boil the sauce. There was a good 4 servings and we had dessert two nights in a row. My husband was moaning in delight. This is so beautiful, healthy and scrumptiously delicious and refreshing. I would not hesitate to make this for company and serve sponge ladyfingers or lovely light hazelnut wafer cookies on the side. To whoever thought this one up, THANK YOU!!!!!

We had this recipe as a side dish last evening at a family cookout. It was a huge hit! On a warm day, very refreshing. The mango, blueberries and ginger are a great combo. I will cut down on the sugar next time however.

As a salad this recipe is to my taste unbearably sweet. As a dessert, it is spectacular--my dinner guests loved it over vanilla ice cream. I'll be putting it in crepes tomorrow. Would be an excellent salad if you use just lime juice and sweeten to taste. Be sure to chop ginger finely. -Mark Johnson, Fort Collins, CO

First of all, don't use really ripe mangoes or you'll have way too much juice and it will be like soup. Also, do NOT use a 1/4 cup of ginger. It is way too much. And going to the trouble of making the syrup isn't really necessary. You'd be better off just combining mango and blueberries and squeezing half a lime over it.
