I make a variety of different pizzas. I tested this on the family on Saturday, and everyone LOVED it. All three members decided it was the BEST of my pizzas. It's sweet. It's savory. It's got that crispy scallion taste. Absolutely exquisite. And the duck - the duck is fatty and lovely on top. Very nice indeed.

I was looking for a pizza that was gourmet but was still hearty enough for supper, and this was a great find. However, since I'm not a duck expert and I was worried about it being rubbery, so I opted to prepare it with the slow cooker (I use this for risotto as well). I cooked it with some stock and 5 spice on low for about 6 hours and then shredded it. I gave this recipe three stars because I think it needs more flavour to balance out the hoisin: next time I will put a couple of bulbs of roasted garlic and something hot, like banana peppers to cut the sweetness. I suppose some acidity would work too, but I prefer heat. Otherwise, great! Will make again!

Used leftover duck seasoned lightly w/Chinese five-spice and homemade pizza dough (in bread machine) and shaped into l large pizza. Followed rest of recipe except baked 475 degrees for 15 minutes. Excellent and different. Will make for company as appetizer.

Made this for a cocktail party with the small pizzas cut into quarters to make them finger food. I prepared all the ingredients the night before and assembled the pizzas immediately before the party. I coated the bell pepper with high quality olive oil and roasted them ahead of time. These were easy, unusual, and a huge hit with guests.

Made this Christmas Eve and it was so festive looking and delicious! I sauteed chicken as I didn't have duck and it was still wonderful. The black sesame seeds are so fun.

Made this pizza as a large pizza and it was amazing. Very easy. Did not season with the Chinese Five spice and prepared with more hoisin sauce than recipe called. Tasted like Peking Duck on bread!

This recipe was super easy and turned out great! I substituted carmelized shallots for the scallions (I happened to have had some at home already) but the spinach made up for the lack of color shallots bring to the presentation. I adapted the reciped to make one large pizza instead of several smaller ones as I believe the recipe indicates.
