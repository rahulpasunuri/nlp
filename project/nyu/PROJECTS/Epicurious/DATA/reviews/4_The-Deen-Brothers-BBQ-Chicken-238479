This an easy, quick tasty bbq sauce. I did some chicken in this and it was great. I doubled the recipe and will use the sauce on hamburgers later this week. For a make your own sauce this is really good. No fuss no muss.

This was excellent, easy, no-fuss and well-suited for a weeknight meal. I used skinless drumsticks, thighs, breast (bone-in), starting the breasts a few minutes ahead. The amount of sauce is ample for this quantity of chicken. The barbecue sauce is a good balance of sweet and smoky, with great color and consistency.

One more thing- I replaced the liquid smoke with 2 chipotle chiles in adobo sauce. I also added 1 sliced Vidalia onion to the mixture.

This recipe is exceptionally simple and also tasty. The recipe makes your standard barbeque chicken.

This was a really quick and fantastic recipe. I added some extra brown sugar (not much) and a few extra shakes of liquid smoke and it was the perfect mix of spicey and very sweet! It was a hit and will make it all the time!

I grilled boneless skinless breasts and thighs. Cooking time was about 20-25 minutes. Basted after 10 minutes. We thought it was quite yummy!

Very good and tasty, and quite easy to make. The combination of slightly peppery and sweet was a hit. I used only drumsticks and thighs, and removed the skin before baking. The chicken stayed moist, almost melt-in-your-mouth quality. I bet this would be fabulous on the grill.
