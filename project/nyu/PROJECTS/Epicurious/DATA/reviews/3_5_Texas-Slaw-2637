This is our favorite slaw too. Great for summer meals. I have successfully substituted splenda for the sugar and reduced the amount of oil sometimes.

This was complimented at the 4th of July barbeque potluck. Very easy, but it makes more like 12-16 servings.

This is the easiest and best tasting slaw. Everyone loves it. I used 12 cups of cabbage and it was just as good as the first time. It reminds me of my mother's Claremont Salad

This is by far my favorite recipe for camping and picnics. Perfect!

I made this slaw the night before and doubled the recipe, using 4 carrots, half green cabbage and half red cabbage. When we ate it the next day for lunch, it had turned pink! It was delicious. Next time I'll use only green caggage.

Great Slaw. For a little different flavor, try using 1/2 tsp. celery seed. I always bring the vinegar, oil and sugar to a boil while whisking to dissolve the sugar completely. Delicious!

I've used this one for years and its so good and so easy. Even easier with vegatables from the salad bar at the market for last minute company.
