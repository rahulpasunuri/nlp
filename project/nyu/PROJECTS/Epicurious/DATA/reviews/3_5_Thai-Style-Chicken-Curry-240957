Wow, what an odd flavor combination. I made it according to the recipe, and all I have to say is what a waste of a lovely ripe pineapple.

This was good, but not that good... I gave it three forks because it was easy to make - I thought that the chicken needed a bit more flavor and it was just ordinary overall- for a curry it was very easy... so I will make it again

The previous review that called this a "soup" almost put me off. Glad it didn't as this is a simple to prepare meal that along with basmati rice and some slightly Asian veggies made a lovely dinner. I made no additions or subtractions, just prepared as written.

This soup is very similar to the heart-warming soups of my favorite local Cambodian restaurant. I could not find the exact canned soup so I used a can of Tom Yum soup. I also added a can of coconut milk in the last 5 minutes. I highly recommend this one!

I added more veggies (peas, bamboo shoots) and a little bit of fish sauce.

This was a very good, quick weeknight meal. I added in red and green pepper while simmering the coconut soup, and a tablespoon of brown sugar.

This dish was excellent! I made some adaptations by coating the chicken with a flour and cracked pepper mixture before frying and I also added water chestnuts, baby corn, shitake mushrooms and serrano chili pepper for an added kick. This was very simple to prepare and had nice flavor overall.

This is a pretty amazing 'cheat' that has quickly risen to the top of my weekday meal go-to list. I've substituted different ingredients such as japanese pumpkin, green beans, red bell pepper & pan-fried tofu with good results.

Reading the recipe I thought it sounded similar to my husbands favorite dish from the Earls chain of restaurants  Spicy Thai Green Curry. With a few modifications I was right! Instead of mushrooms I used a small zucchini cut into chunks and added at the same time as the pineapple (at the end of cooking the sauce so that it didnt go mushy) and topped with a small handful of shelled pistachios served over rice. Delicious and so easy to make!
