I've had guests ask me to bring this dessert to their parties, very easy and chocolatey. I use a quality cocoa powder and sometimes add a bit more.

I made this exactly as written. Used bittersweet chocolate which made it rich but not too sweet. It turned out perfect. After reading other reviews I decided to whisk it vigerously just befor pouring into the crust to make sure it was smooth. Easy and delicious.

Great dessert. It is especially nice that this can be made a day ahead of time. I made this for a gathering of neighbors. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used 2% milk instead of 1% milk. The pie was rich and decadent. The crust was especially nice. I used 60% cocoa Ghiradelli chocolate. The next time I make this I am going to use the 70%. I think it would be even better.

Oh my what a fantastic pie, it was easy to make as well. I used a store bought regular pie crust which I think made it perfect, only other change I made was instead of rum I used Grand Marnier and will probly never try the rum now, it fit just perfectly, and cut the richness just right.

Fabulous. Made the following modifications. Used Bacardi light rum in slightly higher amounts than in the recipe in both filling & whipped cream.spread whipped cream over top & covered with colored sprinkles. Rave reviews.

My family loved this pie... or at least lied to me and said they did. I didn't think it was anything special, and the rum flavoring was a little too strong. It seemed rather run-of-the-mill to me, but it was easy to make and very pretty to look at!

Loved this pie and it was so easy to make! I found the chocolate to be a bit rich, so I served the pie with raspberries. Yum! Chocoholics, though, would love this regardless of the raspberries. I also thought the run infused whipped cream was delicious!

This pie is incredible! It is quick and easy to make, and it turns out great. I made it for a small dinner party, and everyone loved it. I agree with other reviewers that if you do not like rum, substitute it with vanilla extract. It tastes just the same. The filling takes about 35 minutes to make, so don't put the crust in the freezer until about 5 minutes after you've started the filling.

So delicious! It didn't take long to make and it turned out beautiful. It's not just some ordinary pudding.

This pie is awesome. Instead of piping I slathered the whipped cream all over the pie and grated the chocolate on top.

Everyone who ate this chocolate pie loved it! It is really rich, smooth (way better than an ordinary pudding) and so lovely. Plus, it was easy to assemble and the preparation was fast. Having your family members serving a second piece of this rich sweet chocolate pie really tells how successful this choco pie is. Tip: if you do not like rum, I would recommend modifying this ingredient with vanilla extract. Also, I would have the whip cream aside so people can enjoy as much as they want or not put any whip cream. You can always have the additional whip cream in your coffee and or tea as complementary of the dessert.

This is NOT black bottom pie. It may be good, but black bottom pie has two layers of filling, one chocolate and the other vanilla flavored with rum or bourbon. The upper layer is traditionally made with gelatin and whipped egg whites folded into the vanilla custard for a chiffon-like layer. Some prefer two layers of custard, chocolate first then vanilla laced with rum or bourbon. It is finished off with whipped cream spread onto the second layer.

This was a perfectly good chocolate cream pie, but definitely not the best I've had. It tasted too much like a store- bought pudding pie.

Delicious pie. I didn't make the topping because it was for an informal BBQ. Very easy to make, and very intense chocolate flavor.

espectacular!!! I just cover the top with the cream and put it in the freezer for some 1/2 hour. Is like ice cream.

This is death by chocolate, in the best possible way. I used 2% milk and semisweet Scharffen Berger chocolate -- and my favorite rum, Goslings black seal. I opted to skip the recommended toppings and served with lots of slices of fresh strawberries, which brightened things up nicely. That crust was also pretty killer.

I just made this for christmas dinner with friends; easy delicious. I also agree with previous review, its like a very good homemade pudding pie. I think I prefer my mom's french silk pie recipe, though hers has raw eggs & wanted to avoid due to kids & pregnant friend. Would make again, if kids are at dinner but for all the expense: if adult only party I'd serve a desert with a more elaborate taste.

I do not make dessert too often but when I do it must be chocolate. This was an easy recipe and the results were wonderful. I made a graham crust and when serving I dalloped whip creme and topped with fresh raspberries. Wonderful

Rating: 4
French Silk is my husband's favorite and this recipe tops his list. I used Grand Marnier instead of rum the topping. Gives a slight orange flavor & cuts the richness of the chocolate nicely. USE GOOD BITTERSWEET CHOCOLATE. You get what you pay for!

AMAZING!!! I've made this pie a dozen times and everyone raves! It's very rich and not like pudding at all. Serving it with strawberries is a perfect compliment.

Whoa. I mean, WHOA!!! I would recommend this for people who don't think they're "bakers" (like me, I hate to "bake"!) This is an outstanding dessert....the end result is pretty AND delicious. My husband said, "this is Father's Day menu material!"....and that means GOOD!

Rating: 4
Fabulous pie! When cooked correctly it doesn't come out tasting like pudding in the slightest. It has a stonger body than that. I used the Nabisco chocolate cookies for the crust and it was great. Rum is optional in my opinion. I think using bittersweet chocolate is a must and spend the $10 for a decent and yummy chocolate - you won't be sorry! I used Scharffen Berger Bittersweet and it was soooo delicious.

Rating: 4
Used conventional crust instead. Also used 1 oz. unsweetened and 1 oz white chocolate in place of some of the semi sweet. Used 1oz spiced rum as well. Pie was so rich my Viking dishwasher won't get it off the plates! I love this pie!

A big hit with my family. I substituted 2 oz sweet German chocolate for semi sweet in the filling and cut the rum in the topping to a dash and made enough topping to cover the pie. Not a crumb left!

This was a great recipe. My entire family loved it. It was very rich, though. We had to put whipped cream on top to take a little away from all the chocolate. I didn't find chocolate wafers so I used dry chocolate chip cookies. We will definately make this again.

Rating: 4
The rave reviews I've gotten on this pie have been beyond compare, even from some tough critics! I use oreos for the crust, 2% milk and half the amount of rum in the filling, double the amount of cream and sugar for the topping (to cover the whole pie), and no rum in the topping. Also, as a fun variation for a party, I've made a bite size version in mini-muffin tins. I used a bit more chocolate in the crust to make sure the mini shells stayed together. I then took them out of the tin after freezing, and filled them liberally. I then used a small star tip to pipe the whipped cream over the top. They present beautifully and are as delicious as the original. Enjoy!

This pie was wonderful. It is an adult version of a pudding pie. I served it on a hot day, and the contents held together. The chocolate flavor was amazing. I could not find chocolate wafers, but used chocolate graham cracker (a little less than 1 1/2 sleeves). They worked wonderfully. A must make recipe. Enjoyed by adults and kids.

This was a really great pie, all my guests absolutely loved it. I used 1 1/2 cups whipped cream and spread it all over the top of the pie rather than piping it on. Fantastic!!

How on earth could you boil a mixture that contains egg yolks for a full minute? Is it a misprint? I'm thinking it would curdle horribly.

This was delicious when made with Belgian chocolate chips from the Kroger Private Selection. Iwas concerened when after straining the mixture, it didn't look absolutely silky smooth and the texture would be unpleasant. After chilling, it was magnificent. I used only whole milk and it was still plenty rich.

This was a great finish for our Christmas dinner. I added a little more rum (the in-laws are here and I needed it). Also, I could not find the chocolate wafers so I used chocolate teddy grahams. It was fine. Very good & simple, I will make it again!

I've tried many different recipes for chocolate pie and this one definitely goes above and beyond the basic boring version. I followed the recipe almost exactly and it turned out great, maybe others who thought it turned out badly didn't follow the directions.

Oh my gosh--loved the pie. I added roasted pecans to the crust, and instead of Oreos, I used chocolate graham crackers--excellent substitution. I used Ghiradelli Bittersweet chocolate as well, which was just great. I was hesitant to make the pie after reading some of the negative comments, but I am glad I did. Perhaps those people did not follow the recipe just right because my pie did not end up like pudding or paste, it was almost like a truffle (I used 2% milk). Don't be discouraged--give it a try, and follow the cooking directions exactly. You will be SO glad you did.

I've made this a few times and it's both easy and very impressive. 1) I add crushed walnuts to the crust to make it more interesting. 2) I also once got creative and e.g. used dark chocolate with half the recipe and white chocolate with the other half, preparing both separately, then combining for a dual layer pie. 3) I would NOT recommend using whole milk, though others have suggested. It gives the pie a consistency too much like solid chocolate. The lowfat makes it more like pudding and is not as suffocatingly rich.

Rating: 1
Despite using good ingredients, the result tasted like I poured instant chocolate pudding into a pie shell. Very disappointing and hardly worth the effort, or the cost of good chocolate. The flavors don't quite "gel" and the filling manages to be cloyingly rich without being the least bit satisfying.

Rating: 3
This chocolate pie is wonderful. I bought an Oreo crust and took another cook's advice and layered white chocolate with dark chocolate. I sprinkled chocolate chips on top instead of the ribbons. It looked and tasted great.

Lovely dessert. I made it for Christmas Eve. I used boxed chocolate oreo crumbs for crust (no cookie icing), did not add any add'n choc. to crust, but did add chopped pecans (next time I'll roast them first in butter and maple syrup), used Bernard Callebault choc pieces for filling, covered the whole thing in whipped cream and garnished with B.C. shaved choc. I did everything one day ahead except whip the cream. Highly recommended.

This is fabulous - but good quality chocolate is a must! If you're a fan of rich chocolate pudding (not instant - we're talking the Real Thing), you'll love this pie. I've made it for many special events, and never had any leftovers!

Blech! May as well have bought one of those frozen, thaw-to-serve chocolate cream pies, or filled a premade chocolate crumb crust with instant chocolate pudding and cool-whip. Filling was cloyingly sweet and the added chocolate in the crust made it sticky and gross. Our friends' kids loved it but the grownups politely made excuses for not finishing. :(

I was able to find the chocolate wafers at the grocery so I thought I would follow the recipe but the crust ended up very skimpy and made serving it later a little difficult. Also not all the filling fit. The filling tasted alot like chocolate pudding (which is how we ate the left-over filling). I wasn't impressed - I am a chocoholic and this just did not satify the craving.

This is a deliciously decadent dessert. It was a huge hit at the two barbecues I brought it to this past weekend. I too made the crust with Oreo cookies, leaving the icing in and agree that the cookie crust just MADE the pie. Do try it.

My husband and I love this dish. Nice and simple, but doesn't taste it. The crust is sooo good-- if you can spare the time at all, do make your own. You don't need to bother scraping out the Oreo icing if you use the food proccessor. With it, the crust takes two seconds to whip up, and just MAKES the pie.

Wonderful. I made this for my in-laws, and it was inhaled in record time! I used Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate, and you can really taste the difference when you use a quality chocolate. For the sake of nostalga, I also used Jamaican rum my husband and I picked up on our honeymoon. Great recipe, but be sure not to wisk the eggs, milk etc. on too high a heat, or you'll wind up with a sweetened omelette!

This is one of those recipes that takes little time to prepare and tastes like you spent all day making it. It is a very impressive dessert for the chocolate lovers out there and topped with whipped cream finishes it off nicely. It tastes similar to a chocolate pudding but richer with the addition of the melted chocolate. Try adding crushed nuts to the pie crumb crust for more flavor and interest. In the midst of making it a second time in less than a week!

this Pie is AWESOME!! I made it for a pie social and it was practically gone before I could even get it served. I didn't have any chocolate cookies to make the crust but had chocolate oreo crumbs. about 1 1/3 cups was equal to 30 cookies. Worked out well! I definately will make this again, and maybe even get to try it!

I've made this recipe twice. I agree with all the other reviewers that the secret is in using a high quality chocolate. I also used Ghiradelli Bittersweet. It's a good recipe for the topping piped around the edge. I used Ghiradelli chocolate chips as a shortcut instead of chocolate curls to decorate the topping. Maybe next summer I'll decorate the topping with fresh strawberry slices. The entire recipe is delicious and a beautiful presentation - a 10!

This recipe is perfect for a dinner party! It's easy to make and is always a big hit. I've made the pie twice now and each time it gets better. I wasn't able to find chocolate cookies for the crust, but Oreos with the filling scraped off is a nice substitution. Also, I strongly recommend using Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate for both the filling and crust recipes.
