This wasn't impressive. I added a hot pepper, but I had a problem with the same bitterness that other reviewers noted. I'd love to find a good recipe, the Trader Joe's soup is so yummy...

Roast a hot green pepper over a low gas flame, skin, clean of seeds, and add to soup before pureeing. Be carefull - for some reason, a little goes a long way.

Added a chopped hot green pepper before adding the bell peppers and water. Made all the difference.

I didn't roast the peppers but I sauteed everything at once using avocado and olive oil. I also added olive leaf (removed later) and used vegetable broth. I minced garlic and threw that in as well. I added pepper flakes, onion flakes, onion powder, garlic powder, pepper, saffron, and salt. It was just too boring and lifeless without the spices. I pureed only part of the soup creating a creamy but soupy consistency with chunks of red potato, bell peppers, and onions. This makes for more of a stew. Not sure whether I will serve cold or hot yet, but I am going to put a dollop of greek yogurt, scallions, and chives on top. Oh and I omitted tomatoes for tomatillos which were also steamed/stir fryed. I gave it 3 because the original recipe is yucky. But mine tastes a 4. :)

last time i checked, it's spelled "stock." and also, lighten up -- there's no reason you can't use vegetable "stalk" in there.

I am trying to figure out why I found this recipe under the meatless catagory. It sounded so good 'til I got to the chicken broth part.

This recipe calls for chicken stalk. Last time I checked, chicken was a meat and this recipe appeared in the "meatless" section

Serve this soup warm and definitely sub nutmeg for the cumin. Very tasty soup but check out the 'roasted yellow pepper soup and roasted tomato soup w/ serrano cream' for a truly great recipe.

I was making soup for four instead of eight, but I only halved the liquid and kept all the other measurements in the recipe as is. The result: amazing, flavourful, full-bodied, FILLING soup.

This soup was good if a bit bland. I topped it with grated asiago. I will make it again but I am thinking of adding a bit of dry mustard to give it a little extra zip.

Nutmeg instead of cumin, added finely chopped garlic or garlic powder.

An easy soup with few steps required, however, I found this soup bitter and in need of something that I couldn't quite put my finger on.
