Followed the recipe and it was delicious! I served with edamame and cous cous. I would absolutely make this again!

this is my go to easy weeknight meal. although it can also impress for a fancier meal. the flavors are fantastic. i use chili garlic paste, and with a pretty heavy hand, and i think the balance of sweet and hot, with the smokiness of maple syrup, is perfect. i have been cedar planking it, gives it a little more smokiness too. Simple, perfect, wont disappoint.

Sweet/spicy reduced sauce is simple and really tasty.

Delicious!! Made this for Valentine's Day and the recipe was perfect. I used about 1 tablespoon adobo sauce instead of 1 teaspoon, and marinated for about 45 minutes. Tip: Don't cook the salmon for too long. It's better to undercook salmon that overcook it.

I always say I wish Epicurious had 3.5 forks, because that is what I would give this dish. It is very tasty, easy and quick, not requiring any special ingredients, really. I will proceed to review this based on my changes.... :) I used garlic chili sauce instead of adobo (didn't have), added a small amount of minced ginger and garlic (per other reviews). Will definitely make this again, and would use the marinade on other pieces of fish/meat/tofu. I grilled the salmon instead of cooking it in the pan. My family, especially my 12 year old daughter, LOVED it. Husband liked it, even though he is not a salmon fan. The salmon was very fresh - wild sockeye, not farm-raised. Definitely good, definitely would make it again.

This was delicious, melted in our mouths. My 5 and 7 year olds couldn't get enough - they ate a lot of this! I made this last week and will make it again tomorrow. I was concerned about the spiciness of the adobo sauce so I added a couple of dashes of chili powder (made from adobo) and it added enough punch but not heat, so edible for the kids.

This recipe was fantastic!! The marindare/sauce is outstanding! I used wild sockeye salmon and chose to cook the salmon on a cedar plank on the BBQ and I think this made it even better. Everyone raved about it and it's my new favourite salmon recipe....and I don't even like salmon.

Added ginger, garlic and Vietnamese hot sauce (instead of abodo) and marinated for about an hour. We grilled ours instead and it was delicious!

So easy, and so yummy. I substitute chinese hot sauce for the adobo sauce.

I made this based on the reviews, but wondered if I'd find it too sweet or two salty. It wasn't. Quick, simple and good - will make it again.

Tasty and easy. Made wasabi mashed potatoes also.

Loved this recipe! I used a little more adobo sauce for extra spice. Will add some garlic next time per the recent suggestion.

Quick, easy, and delicious. Since I had a whole can of chipotles to use, I made mashed potatoes with chipotle and garlic to go with the salmon. I also added garlic to the maple soy glaze which I think made a huge difference. The salmon went very well with the mashed potatoes and some steamed carrots. It tasted like an expensive restaurant meal. I will definitely make this again.

Very good. Tasty. Really liked the caramelization on the salmon. Used only 1/2 of adobo sauce and it was perfect -- not too spicy.

Simple, fast, delicious. Even scored high with our 6 year old who doesn't like too much spice.

OMG! This recipe is so delish and easy to make. Definitely will be throwing this in the regular rotation of meals. I also baked it ate 450 for 12min.

I made a couple of changes to the recipe. I used a little bit of Chinese Chili Sauce instead of adobo sauce. I also sprinkled a little bit of seasame seed over the fish before baking. I hate to use too many dishes in a recipe preparation. Therefore I put the marinade in a skillet, marinated the fish in the skillet and then left the marinade in the skillet to reduce it. I didn't sear the salmon as I'm not a big fan of searing fish. I loved the final results!

I really liked this glaze, and it was very easy. I actually used it with some pork chops - given that's what I had - and even though I overcooked the chops slightly, the glaze was so good we didn't really mind. I used low-sodium soy sauce, which I highly recommend, and I love the smoky, spicy kick the adobo gave the glaze. I can't wait to try this again, but with salmon!

Exceptional. I added a dash or two of sesame oil and dipped most of them in white pepper. But I admit once they were cooked I liked the black pepper ones better. They didn't really brown, they just became a deep read, are they supposed to? This is a recipe to use cheap salmon with, too.

Cooked this for dinner yesterday and absolutely loved it for simplicity and speed. Made slight alterations by cutting salmon in cubes(so it takes same time for cooking as prawns), added raw peeled prawns, lemon zest, spring onion, ginger and a hint of garlic. Followed recipe to the letter thereafter. Will definatelly make it again!

This was bangin', in the parlance of our times -- and so fast and easy. I followed the lead of previous reviewers and served this with wasabi mashed potatoes, and garnished with chopped scallion; the result was a showstopper meal. A keeper for sure.

One of the best and easiest salmon recipes I have ever made. My new favourite!

I agree with the cook from El Paso. This was nothing to write home about. We had beautiful salmon filets but this combination did nothing for me. Much better glazes are available. The pan searing also smelled up the entire kitchen.

It doesn't get any easier or more delicious than this. I made this on a week night and marinated the salmon for as long as I could, about 90 minutes. My husband LOVED this. Next time I'll add more adobo sauce to kick up the heat. Served this with edamame and wasabi mashed potatoes...yum...

So fast and good; bake at high heat in oven for a mess free meal. The adobo is a great addition yet still mild enough for the kids to eat. I usually avoid gorging on sea food due to PCBs and heavy metal contamination, but I couldn't help myself today.

I made this just like the recipe is written and it was EASY and fabulous. I will definitely make this again!

Excellent dish and oh-so-easy - and I don't particularly like salmon! Couldn't get adobo sauce in the UK so used chipotle paste instead and it was amazing.

These are ingredients we almost always have. So, it's a regular "last-minute" dinner.

Yum. Easy, quick and impressive if presented right. I start mine on a stove top grill for beatiful markings and finish it in the broiler - close enough to caramelize but not so close as to burn/over cook. Added more adobo and served with wasabi mashed potatoes with peas (height and color) and sauteed bok choy. So simple and so good I make it more than I should.

This recipe is delicious!!!!!! I nearly doubled the adobo sauce and it had the perfect kick.

So delicious for so little effort

Pretty good. Could definately use more heat to make it special. Might add additional pureed chilies in adobo. Baked salmon at 450 degrees for 12 minutes. Very good and easy. Will make again.

I make a variation on this: 2 tablespoons maple syrup, 1 tablespoon margarine, melted, 2 tablespoons lime or lemon juice and 1 teaspoon Chinese chili-garlic sauce. Wow!

I would actually give this recipe five forks because it's so easy and comes out with wonderful flavor. This is a regular in our house now. I make it with the soba noodle salad to balance the sweet & spicy. Also, freeze your remaining chipotle chilis with sauce for future use. Yummy!!

This is so good! I grill it, it is the only way my kids want salmon done. I have passed this on to many people-all of them love it-it doesn't get easier than this.

I've made this dish for dinner parties many times and received rave reviews. The glaze is great on everything!

I've made this twice, once with syrup and once, upon discovering that the syrup I was gonna use was moldy, with honey. Both times it was amazing. I recommend leaving the marinade on as long as possible. I left it on for three hours when I was in class, and it was AMAZING.

Quick, easy, and best of all...yummy. I served with steamed rice and asparagus.

This was quite good. The salmon was very smoky though while cooking so I would grill outside next time or do as a couple other reviewers have recommended and put it in the oven.

Rating: 3
Very fast and easy to make with ingredients I almost always have on hand. I liked the glaze and didn't think it was too salty, though that may depend on the soy sauce used. I roasted the salmon at 450 degrees for 14 minutes. A very easy, fast weeknight meal after a day at work. . .I have already made it several times.

I'm always thankful for a recipe my kids enjoy. Instead of pan-frying, I baked the salmon (after it marinated) in a hot oven until it flaked and skipped the sauce. Easy, delish and healthy. What more could a family ask for?

We really liked this, had rice and edamamme with it. I always use reduced sodium soy sauce, so it really wasn't salty. Was easy, yet didn't seem so, a 'do-over' as we say in my house.

Loved it! What a crazy combo of tastes! We did not find it too salty, & my husband is not a fan of too much salt. It was just right for us. We will make againg FOR SURE.

This is the first time I've given a low rating to any recipe I've tried from this website. This was way too salty, and once the marinade was reduced; even worse. I even cedar-planked the salmon which should have compensated somewhat for the flavor, but did not. This just did not work for us. There are much better "glaze" recipes for salmon on this website that are much better. I'll stick with one of those.

This was so easy and tasted wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly except I grilled the fish.
