Turned out very well. The only problem was that I reduced the recipe by half and the amount I made did not last long. I won't do that next time. :)

this not the way it's made in Jamaica. it should be seasoned with Browning sauce and maybe some soy sauce, not jalepeno but scotchbonnet pepper

The last reviewer was right. Not enough flavor. This dish made me think I was sitting in Russia and it was cold out and I just needed something heavy and filling to stick to my ribs. But if you like bland food (not alot of exotic spices- I have a friend like that) that's a hearty winter dish, then this recipe is for you. It just seems like this recipe is missing something, I don't know what it is- may Worcestershire sauce and pearl onions and carrots?

This dish takes too much work and the flavor is not all that great!

Wouldn't change a thing. This recipe is just utterly amazing. I did use the pressure cooker which cuts down cooking time by half.
