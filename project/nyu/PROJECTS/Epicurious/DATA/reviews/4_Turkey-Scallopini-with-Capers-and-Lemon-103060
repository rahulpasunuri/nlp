Very, very good. I use this with chicken and it's lovely. Only change is using half white wine, half stock. My husband loves this.

Oh, shoot. Forgot to add that when I doubled the sauce, I used 1 cup chicken broth and 1 cup white wine. That was key!

SO DELICIOUS. I made double the sauce and added 1/4 cup cream to finish at the end. Served over thin spaghetti instead of rice. Don't worry if the cutlets from the grocery store are thinner than 1/4 inch. It still worked out beautifully -- just shorten cooking time by a minute.

I did as others suggested and made twice the sauce to serve over pasta. Included a splash of white wine with the lemon juice. Put some veggies (asparagus, matchstick carrots & zucchini) into the sauce for just long enough to cook a little while simmering it down. Added just a little flour to help it thicken but keep a good volume of sauce. Topped with some chopped scallions just before serving. Also, used chicken breasts since the store didn't have turkey.

In a word - AMAZING! I know it's not politically correct but I used veal. I also added a touch of butter to the sauce at the end. Indescribably easy and delicious.

LOVE this recipe - I make it exactly as instructed, but let the turkey cook a bit longer in the sauce at the end, and find the sauce thickens really nicely. So yummy and simple!

Rating: 3
Absolutely delicious and easy. I took other reviewers input and added some sour cream and flour to thicken the sauce and it had the perfect consistency. I also added white wine with the chicken broth. You DEFINITELY need to make a double batch to have enough sauce left over to put on pasta.

Excellent and fast. I added 1 teaspoon butter at the end. Will definitely add this to the rotation.

This recipe is Craig Claiborne's - exactly. My mother started making it YEARS ago after it appeared in the Sunday NYT Magazine & it has been a family classic for decades. My mother used whole turkey breasts - don't think you could get turkey fillets back then - & boned them. Her tip (maybe Craig's) - freeze the boned breast, take it out to let it mostly thaw & then cut medallions on the bias when the meat is still slightly frozen & firm - it's much easier to make nicely shaped pieces that way!

This dish is quick, easy and so full of flavor. I didn't have parsley so I used basil instead and it was just as good.

Rating: 4
Great recipe! I made it exactly as called for with turkey and it was fantastic! Also served it over fresh linguini. You will need more sauce if serving over pasta or rice. Be sure to reduce it down as called for in the base recipe quantities. The flavors intensify and it as good as I've had in many Italian restaurants. Go with the turkey - I agree it is more like the texture and flavor of veal.

This is soooo wonderful. Like others, I make more sauce than the recipe calls for, and I use thin chicken breast fillets instead of turkey. This has been a frequent request for birthday dinners.

Rating: 4
This was delicious! I followed the direction exactly, except I added some flour to the sauce at the end to thicken it up a little. I also added closer to 2 tbsp of lemon juice because I like a more lemony flavor. The only thing is that I wouldn't exactly call this "garlicky"; it would need more than 2 cloves of garlic for that! I will definitely make this again!

This was very good, and is probably very hard to get wrong. I had to adapt with thin-sliced chicken breast; into the broth I tossed unsauteed garlic, pinch of dry thyme, parsley, juice of half-a-lime and unrinsed capers. I also returned chicken to skillet a little early to let it absorb some of the liquid, which turns syrupy on reduction. Rice would definitely be an ideal side. Great for Monday night quickie or company.

I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, pounded thin. I also doubled the sauce ingredients.

Did whole wheat pasta on the side just like the previous reviewer. Went heavy on the lemon juice (by accident) and it was still so delish. Will definitely make this again soon.

This is terrific . . . fast,delicious, and elegant enough for company. I served with whole wheat pasta, thickened the sauce a little with a bit of flour and sour cream and added a little white wine. This is really, really good!

I made a roux from the olive oil left over in the pan after removing turkey, then added meyer lemmon juice from my tree and chicken stock. It made a thicker sauce, and the sweetness of the lemmons was great with the capers. My 2 year old ate it up!

Wonderful entre for any night of the week and yet special enough to serve guests. I've made it with chicken, veal and pork medalions as well. Capers are one of the tiniest bursts of flavor. I generally serve it with mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus spears.

This is the perfect recipe for those days when you are short on time but want to serve your family a tasty meal! It is so quick and easy to prepare. I did substitute chicken cutlets as our market was out of turkey cutlets and I doubled the sauce as recommended by several of the reviews. I served it with rice pilaf and a small salad. My husband loved it! I will definitely make this one again!

This dish is SO good, I've made it several times. I use skinless boneless chicken thighs instead of turkey, add quartered artichoke hearts (NOT the marinated kind) and wilt some baby spinach in the sauce just before serving. Altogether they make a great combination of flavors. My husband LOVES it!

I have made this dish many times since discovering it a few years ago and it is ALWAYS a big hit. I have found that adding a variety of sliced mushrooms (my recent fave is shiitake) to the sauce brings this up to a 4 fork-worthy review! Serve with roasted garlic mashed potatoes for a truly wonderful meal. Enjoy!

Great, easy recipe. Pounded turkey thin and took only about 3 minutes per side. I too more or less doubled the sauce, and threw in a little white wine. I also added chopped shallots which added a little to the sauce. Definitely worth repeating.

This is great and so quick, it is perfect for a weeknight meal. Definitely double the sauce. Can't always get thin turkey cutlets but I will definitely try this with pounded pork tenderoin medallions.

I agree w/ doubling the recipe for the sauce, but other than that, it came out deliciously. I had some leftover olives that I almost used in place of the capers, but I'm glad I changed my mind: the capers really added a great flavor. The turkey came out a bit tougher than I'd like, though; any suggestions for a semi-beginner cook to remedy this would be appreciated!

Rating: 3
Scallopini, piccata, the sauce is pretty much the same. And this is a good one. I used thin pork chops. It was very good! I don't understand why anyone would try this when they didn't like capers. That's what makes it scallopini & piccata--whether it's turkey, chicken, veal or pork. That & the lemon. ??? Next time I will double the sauce. At least. It sort of got away from me & reduced to almost nothing. Good thing I served it with butter/chive baby potatoes. We were cleaning the pan with bread afterwards.

This was delicious and VERY EASY! Great mid-week meal. I was apprehensive about the capers as I don't like them very much and was concerned the children wouldn't like them, but I used half the amount and just didn't put them on the children's plates! Doubled the sauce as suggested. Yum Yum!

Fabulous! Second time we're having it within a week. First time I made it with turkey cutlets, tonight with thin chicken cutlets. The only minor change I did was use 3/4C of low salt chicken broth and 1/4C of Noilly Prat dry vermouth which enhanced the flavor.

I made this last night using pork tenderloin medallions pounded thin. I doubled the sauce but kept the amount of lemon the same and it was wonderful. Served it over rice as suggested and my husband wished I had doubled the entire recipe. This sauce would work great on seafood, which is why we are serving it over sauteed Calamari Steaks tonight. Please don't omit the capers, they make the sauce what it is supposed to be and for God's sake don't use dried parsley or add vegetables and goat cheese, that is not Scallopini!!!

This dish was Yummy. My husband thought it was veal. I used turkey thigh cutlets, and followed the recipe closely, except that I replaced a little bit of the oil with butter to help thicken the sauce. Next time I may add some mushrooms. I am excited to find a deliciously rich new way to serve turkey. If you like scallopini, you will not be disappointed.

Well, with apologies to the cook from Knoxville, I made this with extra-firm tofu instead of turkey (we are vegetarians), and it was very tasty. The pungent sauce hides the blandness of the tofu.

I wish I was a bigger fan of white meat poultry, because the sauce on this was fabulous and it was super easy to make. But I ended up finding the turkey a bit tough and chewy even though I was very careful about not cooking it too much. Still and all, the sauce is incredible, and those who like white meat should love it.

Woah! I'm wondering how some people can even justify submitting a review for TURKEY SCALLOPINI when they've completely altered the entire recipe. A minor change or substitution here and there is one thing but omitting capers, adding sauteed vegetable and goat cheese is creating a completely different dish (called turkey primavera). The flavors and textures have been changed and a new dish has been born. To me, it is like submitting a review of a recipe for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on white bread with the following changes: change the white bread to a sourdough roll, add sliced apples and cheddar cheese and omit the peanut butter. The review wouldn't actually be for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich! I'm all for experimenting. It's great to take a dish and personalize it with your own touches; however, I just don't see how creating a new dish can be considered a review of a recipe.

I wanted to add my comments because I found others so helpful. I made this dish with chicken breasts and it turned out great! I also added mushrooms and used wild rice. But, the goat cheese really made it happen! I found the sauce a challenge to reduce, but I also used dark rum rather than gin.

Mmmm! I wonder if I reduced the broth too much, because how do I simmer the turkey when it is two layers deep in the skillet while the broth barely comes halfway up the first layer? Also, I used regular broth, which was not too salty at all.

I made this recipe with veal scallopini rather that turkey & it was delicious. A couple of my recomendations would be...First be sure to use low sodium chicken broth...and Secondly, try a sauteed topping of mushrooms, onions, red &/or green peppers with some crumbled goat cheese...Magnificent & really fast to prepare. Also I omitted the capers as I am not a huge fan of them. This one goes into my recipe box!

A favorite, quick, main dish and a healthful one. I like to add a few chopped shallots and an ounce or so of vermouth or sake to the sauce for additional flavor. When I feel extravagant oyster mushrooms and a dollop of butter smoothe the sauce.
