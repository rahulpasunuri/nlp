I made this for Xmas Eve and it was a gib hit. The AMAZING thing I noticeed while cooking was that salt isn't in the recipe. So of course if you don't add salt, it's going to be bland! So I poured some salt in while it was cooking. YUM. The only other thing I did differently was I used half the amount of wine (I had a guest who hated the taste of wine) and used half the red pepper flakes. While I eat them RAW, I've discovered that a whole TBS of hot pepper flakes is too much for three pounds of broc. Other than that, the recipe is DELICIOUS! :) :)

This was quite good. I served it with pasta for Christmas dinner. The theme this year was lemon... yum!

I read other reviews and they were mostly positive, so i gave it a go. I did not like the flavors at all, thought it was bland and boring, I will not make this again. Although my boyfriend liked it a lot and ate what was left on my plate.

Loved it! Had to cover the pan for the last two minutes to make sure the stems cooked through, but it's a nice alternative to boring old steamed broccoli.

This was good. I made it without the red pepper flakes b/c although I love the spicy heat, some of my dinner guests don't like spicy food. It was still good, though I think it needed some salt.

A variation of this recipe for dinner. Started with olive oil, orange juice, and pine nuts. Added broccoli. Then add white wine and lime zest. Finish with ground pepper. Voilà!

Found this similar recipe from "How to Cook Everything" which was delicious and we eat a lot of broccoli: Braised Broccoli with Garlic and Wine Recipe A Roman preparation, great at room temperature. Ingredients 3 tablespoons olive oil 3 anchovies, minced (optional) About 1 1/2 pounds broccoli, trimmed and cut up Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste Preparation Place the oil in a large, deep skillet that can later be covered and turn the heat to medium. Add the anchovies and the garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until the anchovies begin to break up and the garlic begins to color, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the broccoli and cook, stirring, for 3 or 4 minutes. Add the wine and let it bubble away for a minute or two. Cover, turn the heat to medium‐low, and cook for 2 or 3 minutes. Uncover, return the heat to medium, and cook until most of the wine has evaporated and the broccoli is tender, about 5 minutes more. Season to taste (you will not need much salt) and serve hot or at room temperature.

I made this exactly as stated. I used dry vermouth. I took one bite and thought "this is ok." Then added some salt and loved it!!!

I didn't use any pepper flakes, but this was really good. it's made how I usually cook broccoli, but with a few extra things. definitely will make again.

This was great! But then, we were getting so sick of plain steamed broccoli that that may not be saying much. I thought it was delicious with a few changes: added 1/8 cup fresh OJ and lemon juice to the wine, cooked for just 6 min, used WAY less oil (more like 1-2 Tbsp), and tossed with just 1 tsp each of orange zest and lemon zest at the end. Oh, also left out the pepper flakes to make it kid-friendly - I think it would be even better with them. I'll definitely be adding this to our regular rotation - very quick and easy too!

I added a handful of sliced almonds to toast with the garlic. Instead of lemon and orange zest I used 1/8 cup of lemon juice and 1/8 cup of orange juice. I added it after all the wine was incorporated. I then cooked it for 6 minutes to make the broccoli crisp-tender. A much more flavorful dish than plain steamed broccoli!

I like my broccoli a little "under done" (crunchy) so the wine had not cooked out enough, leaving more of an alcohol flavor than there should have been.

I had high hopes for a recipe that did something different with broccoli but this just wasn't it. The citrus was way too much, just a dash would have been better.

Hmmm. Odd. Maybe I just didn't have the right dry white wine but this is a strange way to prepare broccoli. The flavors are a peculiar marriage that may be better served in the summertime accompanying grilled chicken and NOT a bowl of spicy marinara & sausage. Um...next?

Didn't have any orange peel, but I bet it would have added a nice element. As it was, this was delicious. And I agree with some others this didn't take as long as the recipe said.

You know, it was OK. I suspect part of the problem in my case was poor quality broccoli. Perhaps using something fresh from the farmer's market and the lemon zest (which I didn't have) would make it better.

We usually steam our broccoli and my wife always asks for something different. I followed the recipe, using the wine to just keep the garlic from from browning and we loved the results. Quick east cook for healthy broccoli with a nice bite. I have to wonder how long before I hear I need to find at least third way to cook the brocolli.

I made this recipe as described (no substitutions) and did not think it was tasty. No one else I made it for liked it either.

This recipe adds flavour and zing to broccoli. My husband loved it! I omitted the orange zest and used both lemon zest and juice of half a lemon, and threw in a tsp of margarine before serving. I should say I used half the amount of broccoli though, and adjusted the oil, garlic, wine, and pepper flake amounts by half.

I found the zest and wine gave it a pungent, sour taste. Much prefer sauteing the broccoli then adding a bit of garlic and chicken broth and steaming til tender.

Freshy picked broccoli from the garden, exceptionally fruity olive oil from Tuscany. This was wonderful. I cooked for less than 8 mins, to retain crispness. The lemon zest is vital for a little zzzzing. Just read thru some of the reviews and am amzed that someone thought that barbecue sauce was a perfect addition!!!??????

The cooking time seems far too long -- I cooked the broccoli in wine for fewer than eight minutes, and it was still overcooked. I did like the flavor combination, however. I used just the zest of one lemon and it was citrus-y enough.

We had tons of broccoli so I was looking for the right recipe and found this.... it was great! I still have some broccoli left and will do this recipe again tomorrow, to use up the rest. It was that good AND easy! I"m still nibbling what was leftover.

Definitely needs salt. I didn't have red pepper flakes or a fresh orange so I left them out. We don't like spicy food so this was probably better for us. Next time I will add the orange. Using pre-cut flourettes definitely saved time.

A nice twist for a difficult vegetable

Oh my, this was delicious! Zesty, healthy, easy to fix. I will make this again as soon as I can get more broccoli.

Great and quick, Added a tbs of spicy BBQ to the extra dry Marsala and it gave it a nice zip. Used zest and a squirt of the fresh lemon and both my teens and husband polished this dish off. Would serve to company.

This was good, but not really good. I liked the combination of flavors and the red pepper flakes gave it a nice kick. I did salt it and add butter at the end as we found it a little bland, even with the garlic, wine, and both zests. I did save all the leftovers and will serve it tossed with italian dressing to bring it to life a little more. Next time I'm sure I'll add some more herbs and try fresh squeezed lemon instead of the zest. I'll probably omit the orange zest all together. I also think next time I'll saute the garlic longer and give the oil more flavor and let the garlic brown as the recipe said not to.

Very flavorful dish. The orange and lemon rinds make a big difference. I cooked peeled sliced stems with the heads. When I make this again, I will cut the heads into even thickness slices. The stems, chilled after cooking and seasoning, would make a great crispy salad or side dish.

Great dish. I didn't sprinkle any zest, but sprinkled some fresh lemon juice over the broccoli along with the wine. It gave it a fresh, citrus-y flavor. And the red pepper flakes gave it a nice kick!

A festive side dish. The seasonings really dress up the broccoli. This one's a keeper.

As I was cooking a couple other dishes at the same time, I added the garlic just after adding the broccoli & wine which may have been a fatal mistake. Overall the dish was quite bitter, though the citrus zest added to the festive palette of flavours at our pre-christmas dinner party

I liked the taste better before the zest was added. I would leave it out next time.

Great - I precooked the broccoli in the microwave for 2 minutes. Add a bit of salt.

I was looking for a quick, easy and different way to fix broccoli . . . this filled the bill! I followed the recipe with the exception of reducing the amount of oil by about 1/2 and was delighted with the results. I consider this a major improvement over my typical steamed broccoli.
