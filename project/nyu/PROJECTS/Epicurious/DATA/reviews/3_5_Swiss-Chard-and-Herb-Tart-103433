Super good, and actually not too time consuming if you remember to thaw the dough in time. Definitely a good way to use up chard, or ricotta. I actually used a 14 oz package of puff pastry and that was too much.

Have made this tart a couple of times and enjoyed it. I do add the carmelized onions as a bottom layer. Can be made with a lesser expensive fridge pie dough instead without sacrificing too much on flavor. I also just made the Swiss chard, raisin and pine nut tart (on this site) and I think that one is much more appealing to all tastes so check that out, too.

I did modify the recipe a bit, doubled the garlic and herbs and used mozzarella in place of ricotta and parm (due to husband preferences). I did add carmelized onions and it did enhance the flavor. Served with roasted chicken. i liked the puff pastry on top - nice and crispy!

I made this last night and thought it was delicious. I used phyllo dough instead of puffed pastry and was happy with the result. Didn't have quite enough ricotta, so added some cottage cheese, which worked out great. Also added a few shallots. Served with "chicken under a brick." Lovely.

I really liked it but my husband thought it was a little "sleepy." Next time I would try adding the carmelized onions.

I made this using the Rough Puff Pastry from this site and added some pine nuts and raisins as per another Swiss chard tart recipe. It was a huge hit with my husband and the leftovers made for a great Sunday brunch. Definitely going on my list of regulars.

Made this last night with Michigan farmer's market rainbow chard, spinach and asparagus. Also added a layer of carmelized onions to the bottom, then mixed in spinach with the chard/cheese layer (added 2 cloves of garlic, too), and then topped that layer with asparagus chunks(blanched and sauteed with garlic). Delish. The Asparagus layer made it a true tribute to Michigan in late spring, early summer.

My husband loves this dish. I probably put more garlic in the recipe, and substitited romano for parmigiano. I used the puff pastryand was very pleased with the taste and appearance of the final result.

I used the suggestions of several reviewers, adding caramelized onions, 3 bacon strips chopped, and bread crumbs instead of puff pastry. In addition, I added more fresh thyme and oregano, using less ricotta and about 3 oz of feta. Next time, I would leave off the bread crumbs on top, only using them on the bottom. This is a great way to use chard. I'm not a fan of swiss chard but this tart with the addition of the onions kept the chard from being overwhelming. 3 stars instead of 4 because adding onions and more herbs are integral to the dish.

Like others, I skipped the puff pastry and just spread bread crumbs in the bottom of a buttered quiche dish,then added caramelized onions, then the chard/ricotta mixture. Topped the whole thing with crumbs and spritzed with oil. Used only about 10 oz of part- skim ricotta; baked til golden. Really delicious, excellent side dish to pork. I wonder: could you skip the boiling of the swiss chard and just saute it til wilted and excess liquid has evaporated?

This is a great way to use your CSA chard, which can be pretty overwhelming in the summer. However, the puff pastry makes this a little rich for every day dining. For a lighter version, since the filling will hold its structure on its own, I just lined the bottom of a pie dish with bread crumbs and also added another layer on top with a spray of olive oil for crunchiness and it worked out very nicely.

I decided to add basil and garlic scapes because of the reviews saying it was sort of bland. AMAZING! And then I made a yogurt dill sauce to drizzle over...so goooooood.

I put 3 carmelized onions as the first layer under the chard/cheese - excellent! The chard/cheese is quite bland otherwise.

I had picked up a pound of the farmers market and then found this as a good 'first recipe' to try it in. I must say that I just don't care for the vegetable, but I'm definately going to try this again, substituting spinach (fresh, not frozen) and either some sweet bell peppers or hot peppers.

I've been looking for something good to make with all the Swiss Chard I've been getting from the CSA and this recipe fit the bill. It exceeded my expectations and I would definitely make it again. In fact, I would go out of my way to make it again.

This recipe is delicious, and with the fresh Swiss chard coming out of my garden I'm in heaven! As a twist for company, I used a biscuit cutter and put rounds of the dough in a mini-muffin pan and filled them with about a tablespoon of the filling. I cut the baking time to about 20 minutes and made incredible individual tarts that everyone loved! The recipe as written will yield about 48 mini tarts. Absolutely perfect for parties.

The recipe is fine as it is, but I LOVE it when I substitute feta for the ricotta!

This was very popular with the kids, husband and me!! I added bacon and carmelized onion and it was a perfect mix of flavors. The puff pastry was tasty and easy. This will go into week night rotation!

Excellent recipe! Like everyone else, I made a few modifications. I began by sauteeing mushrooms (which someone else suggested) until they were almost dry, then adding the chopped chard ribs. Finally, I added the washed, chopped chard leaves and cooked them in the skillet with the lid on until they wilted. I also made an olive oil pie crust instead using puff pastry.

We make this regularly as a light dinner or brunch dish. If you make it according to the recipe, squeezing the water from the chard after blanching, it doesn't get mushy. I use more thyme than the recipe calls for.

I followed the recipe as written, with two exceptions. I didn't blanch the chard (I thought it was unnecessary, and would add excess water, but maybe I was wrong!), and I doubled the herbs (at least), with no noticeable result. The general flavor is OK, but has a watery kind of taste (more the flavor than the texture, it wasn't soggy!), and the herb flavor, even with extra, was completely overwhelmed by the chard. Just as a final note, I did use exactly a pound of chard (I set it on the kitchen scale when I came in from the garden!), and the quantity of filling seemed fine (I did leave the stems-just chopped and sauted them first, then added the leaves-I have the multicolored chard, and they're just too pretty to leave out!). Unfortunately, I don't think this will be a repeat. I might play with the filling and try to tweak it one more time, but it just wasn't worth the effort.

I, too, made a few changes. I used two pounds of fresh chard sqeezed dry. I added a good amount of fresh dill and baked in a standard 2 crust pie. The crust I used was Pillsbury and looked great. 9 inch pan and cooked for 40 minutes. If I was doing this again I would make my own crust or use another brand. I think that Pillsbury thinks that people only make sweet pies ... not savory. There was the barest hint of sweet in the crust. And I would add more cheese to the filling. The dill, by the way, was a great addition.

Delicious! Not to mention versatile...it works as a side dish for dinner, a light lunch or can even be a main dish for brunch! A definite must-have recipe.

This was even better than I expected, despite the substitutions I made. I used a bag of Trader Joe's mixed braising greens (pre-washed and chopped), blanched and sauteed them as the recipe instructs, but did not bother removing ribs or chopping more finely. I used part-skim ricotta because that's all my store had. I forgot to get fresh herbs, so I added herbes de Provence. Despite these changes, it was really good. I will definitely make this again, following the recipe more closely next time.

A Mother's Day hit. I used low fat ricotta and part skim mozzarella, doubled the chard and herbs, and only used one crust. I also added some chopped ham and onion, and sliced tomatoes on the top about halfway through the baking. I can't wait to eat the leftovers today!

Learning from other reviewers, here is what I did: 2 lbs. of chard, double thyme & oregano, 3 cloves garlic. I used part-skim ricotta in a nod to current health fashion. I squeezed the devil out of the wilted chard. I sauteed up half a large onion, chopped, the garlic, and 4 oz. sliced cremini mushrooms. I used egg wash on the assembled tart and used leftover pastry to put cute shapes on the tart. Result: big success: not runny, good looking, very tasty. Use of puff pastry out of the box made the whole pie quick to fix, a real no-brainer. With a salad, some bread-machine bread, and a glass of wine, the four of us ate like monsters. This is good for a work night where you don't want to spend hours slaving over a hot stove.

I varied this by following previous recommendations to add onion (sauteed minced onions for 10 minutes, then added garlic & herbs). I used 3 lbs of swiss chard and it was barely enough (stems & veins removed). Also, instead of puff pastry, I used phyllo dough: 8 sheets for bottom layer with olive oil brushed between (laid to overlap past the sides of my 10" springform pan), then 8 sheets cut to fit the top, and rolled the edges of the overlapping sheets so I had a nice edge on top. Baked at 350 for 30 minutes, then 20 more minutes at 400 to crisp it up. It made a nice do-ahead accompaniment to roast leg of lamb. Everybody said they loved it!

Took suggestions of other reviewers and added caramelized onions; used frozen spinach instead of chard (less labor involved); also added some chopped ham. Great dish!

Good, but largely so because of the puff pastery. You could put most anything in puff pastery and it would be good. I added carmalezed onions (put them down first) to the tart. It was an improvement.

I was concerned this might be a bit runny and not keep it's shape once it was cut, so I drained the ricotta and REALLY squeezed out the chard; it held together perfectly. I also made the filling the day before then assembled it an hour before baking. I used 2x the amount of oregano and thyme and 3 cloves of garlic and the flavor was terrific. The top looked very plain so I used a cookie cutter and, with the leftover dough, I made some shapes and stuck 'em on with an egg wash. I cut it into 10 pieces for a first course (and the pieces were plenty large).

Have made this twice in the past month to rave reviews. I recommend making it without the pastry top and doubling the recipe. You'll want to have leftovers!

Very tasty, even at room temperature. I might try a variation next time, like adding chopped leeks. Also might try adding a creamy cheese like mozzarella, provolone or Jarlsburg. It held together OK but the consistency seemed a little dry.

Very well received at Mother's Day luncheon-even my 8 year old liked it! I did use low fat ricotta and think it would have been better with full fat. Good excuse to try it again.

A great way to use Swiss chard. Great for entertaining because it can be made several hours ahead and then re-heated briefly in the oven. I was apprehensive about using store bought puff pastry (I usually prefer to use homemade dough), but the tart really came out well and simplified the preparation. I would even serve this for lunch with a green salad.

This is a gorgeous luncheon dish that I make often. I serve it with the white beans with sage and olive oil also in the May 2000 issue and a fresh tomato salad. I double the amount of fresh thyme and use 3 cloves of garlic. Yum.

This dish was beautiful to look at and delicious to eat. I brushed the top with beaten egg and the crust turned perfectly golden. This will be a great dish to serve as appetizers also.

I've made this now a couple of times and it is great! Very tasty the next day. The only thing I would say is that it needs a little bit more flavor for me. I've added bacon, mushrooms, red pepper flakes, bell peppers, all sorts of things and it turns out great every time. This is great make ahead recipe.

Instead of swiss chard, I used a 10 ounce box of frozen chopped spinach with the moisture squeezed out. It was wonderful and very impressive looking. Very easy to make.
