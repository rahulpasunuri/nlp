This cake recipe is not as good as other stout cakes I've made. Because of the other comments, I used 4 oz chocolate, and it was still light on chocolate flavor. I used an extra egg and because the cake smelled like it was done at 36 minutes, I tested it and sure enough, it was. I can imagine that anyone making the cake with only two eggs and cooking it for 45 minutes would indeed have a dry cake! It is the kind of dessert we call stodge in our house because it's sort of unexciting and thick. As far as the sauce, it was tooth- numbingly sweet, so I added another 1/4 cup cream for a total of 1/2 a cup and added two more egg yolks (tempering them first). These additions made a delicious sauce that was much more like a caramel sauce than a creme anglaise. And everyone agreed that the sauce makes the cake.

Because several reviewers said this was dry, I lowered the temp to 325, increased prunes to 8 oz, increased chocolate to 4 oz, and put all butter in batter instead of using part to grease pan. I used Baker's Joy to grease the pan. Very tasty, and very nice with a glass of stout!

This cake is misnamed: it's a twist on a traditional English Plum Pudding or Figgy Pudding rather than a traditional chocolate cake (I'd call it Chocolate Stout Plum Pudding.) We made it for our Christmas dinner, served warm with the creme anglaise (very good and, I agree, crucial.) Plum Puddings are often moistened before serving with brandy or whiskey and then flamed - I think this idea would work well with this recipe.

Don'd even think about making this cake without making the "stout creme anglaise" - the two work together wonderfully. Separately the cake is nothing to write home about, somewhat dry! left over anglaise can be used over fruit (not citrus) very yummy.

This is not a sweet dessert. If you are looking for sick sweet, you will not find it here. This is a dark chocolate lovers treat. Best chocolate cake I've ever had.

I made this cake as directed, except that I made 6 mini-bundt cakes rather than one large. No shortness issues, there. I found the cake a little dry, but loved the subtle flavor. With the stout creme anglaise on it, the dryness issue was conquered completely.

Nothing special. Short and unattractive presentation. Wondered where the chocolate flavor was and why in the world the prunes were added... Had to smother it in some last minute fudge sauce to make it passable for my guests. Aside from the St. Patty's Day gimmick, I don't think this cake has much going for it. I'll try the other recipe next time.

I went to a St. Patrick's Day potluck and was asked to bring dessert - I brought this and it was a hit. I doubled the recipe and used creme fraiche instead of anglais. It was good and fun for the occasion.

I followed the recipe exactly and this cake was a huge hit! Everyone loved how it wasn't "too sweet" like so many moist chocolate cakes are. Really excellent, and easy to make

This cake was quite the hit at mother's day dinner. I left out the prunes and added the stout straight, to no ill effects. I also added some candied walnuts, which added a nice crunch and some sweetness. the stout glaze was essential.

Loved, loved, loved this cake! When I make it again (which will be tomorrow), I'll double the recipe, as I made it in a Bundt pan and found it to be unattractively short. I'd also like it to feed 16 people, like a regular-size Bundt cake. I'm a kosher cook, and made this pareve by using Fleischman's unsalted margarine instead of butter. I also made Brown Sugar Stout Rich's Whip (reduce a c. of stout to 1/4 c., and add it and 1 T. brown sugar to the Rich's Whip) to accompany it instead of the creme anglais, and everybody loved it. Lots of conversation around the table about the unusual flavors.

The stout adds some nice complexity, but I would prefer more chocolate. Go for the gusto! Add some chocolate chips or a chocolate glaze! (the stout creme anglaise ends up looking like turkey gravy, which throws your tastebuds for a loop) Also, mind the instruction to use unsalted butter - I used salted and it was too much.

This was a yummy cake. I took others' suggestions and only made 1/2 batch, which filled two 8 inch pans. I had difficulties with the ganache-- it wouldn't thicken. I used it (in its runny form) between the layers (I cut each cake in half for four layers) and made chocolate buttercream frosting for the outside. It was very rich and sweet. My family thought it was restaurant quality.

It's an acquired taste for this one. I really enjoy eating it. Use a good chocolate (I made it once with Ghiradelli and once with Baker's) The latter's chocolate does not has as much of a pronounced taste to it

I wonder if this is a "smaller" cake version of the other "chocolate stout" cake on this web site.
