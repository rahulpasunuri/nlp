I have been making this since it first appeared in Bon Appetit using the cukes from our garden. Several years ago we had a foreign exchange student from Germany. He returns each summer and always requests this salad. Refreshing, easy and great with grilled meat. I am surprised the rating is not higher.

This was good but not great. I'll probably try a different recipe rather then make it again. On a positive note, it's very refreshing.

so fresh, so tasty. a few toasted sesame seeds on top, a bowl of coconut-ginger rice and Teriyaki Chicken night kills.

I have used this recipe so many times, it's fantastic with the salmon burgers, very fresh and light.

Just the cucumber salad recipe I've been looking for! Not bitter or tart like some other recipes. It was a bgi hit!

I made this last week, and went out to buy more fresh cucumbers so that I can make it again. Refreshing, and delicious. Admittedly, I made some major changes to the original recipe: (1) Followed arlneo7s advice to dry cucumbers and reduce soy sauce, (2) Added lots of fresh shaved ginger and carrots for color and flavor.

EZ & refreshing. Very good. Not thrilling ... I added some hot pepper flakes for a little "zip" & toasted sesame seeds because, well ... why not!

I finally found the cucumber salad recipe I've been looking for! I cut thin slices instead of shaving ribbons and it turned out well.

This is a variation on a typical Chinese dish -- I liked the ribbon presentation, but made the following changes: (1) After cutting the cucumber, salt fairly liberally and set aside for at least 30 minutes. This will release the water in the cucumbers and make them crispier and less likely to become soggy from the dressing. (2) Because of the extra salt, use plain (not seasoned) rice vinegar and reduce soy sauce to about 1/2 teaspoon (also makes the dish brighter in appearance). (3) For my personal taste, I increased the sugar to at least 2 teaspoons (my vinegar was Marukan's 4.3% acidity). You can add more sugar after mixing the salad if you find it necessary.

While this was simple to make and conveniently used pantry staples I found it to be very bland. There are much better seasoned cucumber recipes around.

Halved this recipe the other night and used a regular cucumber that was a bit shy of 10 oz. So I added a small amount of diced red bell pepper and sweet onion. Also, I used a knife to very thinly slice the cuke into thin circles. EXCELLENT!!!

These are very tasty! For maximum effect you really need to use a mandolin -- a knife just won't do it as thinly as you need to. A great compliment to an asian dinner and really easy to whip together.

Try it with apple cider vinegar instead of rice vinegar. It's a little less authentic but adds a nice touch of sweetness to it and you can even leave out the sugar if you do that. Very versatile and can be used with many different types of food.

I love the salads I get at sushi bars but this wasn't quite right. It was better once I added sesame seeds to it but still not good enough to make again.

I've had this a million times while dining in Sushi restaurants but didn't know the breakdown. Shredded cabbage and carrots are wonderful, but add some bay shrimp or crab flakes. It is divine. and even a little ramen noodles are very tasty!

It gets 3 forks because it is so easy to make and is a great dish with fish (has to be exceptionally mind-blowing for 4). I sometimes add daikon and a bit of ginger. Slicing it paper-thin with a mandolin gives it a lighter texture and fresher juicy-ness than rings.

We loved this dressing served with cucumbers. I've tried several versions in the past, but this one is the clear winner. The dressing would go very well on many other salads, or even sprinkled on grilled fish.

We had no time to boil the sauce, substituted peanut oil for sesame, and it still turned out wonderfully! One recommendation would be to cut the cucumbers into rings rather than strips, would make it easier to eat.

Crisp, light and fresh. A great alternative to slaws. I've made this twice and was faithful to the recipe each time. Curiously, there's never any leftovers. Can't wait to make this with my homegrown cukes this summer!

I made this salad a little too long before dinner it wasn't the most crisp, but it was still very good. It has a very subtle flavor, and I think it's for people who love cucumbers.

Both my husband and I enjoyed this salad as it had a nice flavor. The next time I make this, I will include this as a salad/side dish at a party. I will also include thinly sliced carrots to give a bit of color as well as toasted sesame seeds.

Good flavor, but it didn't knock me out.

Another simple and quick recipe that can be made almost last minute. Better than others as the cukes don't have a chance at getting soggy!

I took this receipe to a dinner and everyone really enjoyed it. This receipe was easy to make and something a little different than just salad. I would make this receipe again.

I agree with Minnesota...I much prefer using plain rice vinegar and then seasoning on my own since we like our food less salty. We also like things spicy so add red pepper flakes.

G'Day! The introduction of a little orange juice works. Toss in some small crispy noodles and shredded lettuce,cabbage and carrot and you have a great asian salad...just add pieces of grilled chicken and you have a meal! If you like the sound of this without the soy check out vietnamese salads as I am sure this has been inspired by them. And finally a similiar Indian one which the great Madgur Jaffrey introduced me to works in a hurry....Grate several carrots while you heat some mustard seed in a tbsp or so of oil in a small covered frypan. When the seeds start to pop dump the mixture on the carrot and add lemon juice to taste. Ymmm!

Aw, come on folks, lighten up on Minnesota. Maybe she/he just prefers pure, unseasoned rice vinegar because it has no added salt or sugar, meaning those seasonings can be controlled by the cook. Hey, people use unsalted butter for the same reason.

Simple and tastes great. What more could you ask for. Make sure to slice the cucumbers thinly...I used a Japanese mandolin to get them reallly thin.

if you are in america and want to purchase the sushi vinegar that the reader from japan mentioned, try an asian grocer or ethinicgrocer.com-it's there for $4.99. additionally, what is in seasoned rice vinegar that people in minnesota are afraid of?

The small Asian cucumbers are wonderful. You can also add thinly sliced small white or red onions. With the carrots mentioned by another cook, you have a very nice salad in fall colors.

Have made variations of this recipe before and have added carrot ribbons for extra color. Perhaps some lightly toasted sesame seeds. As for the cook that stated "there is stuff in seasoned rice vinegar that we don't want" must not be able to read and understand basic labels. The ingredients listed on the seasoned rice vinegar bottle are:"rice vinegar, sugar, salt" Now, what is it exactly that "we" don't want? Hmmm..... perhaps a "Cooking 101" class is in order?

Living in Japan I have access to "Sushi Vinager" which already contains sugar and I use the slinder Asian cucumbers. I slice my cucumbers the day before and marinade them in the Sushi Vinager over night and they stay firm and crisp. 20 minutes before serving I add the soy sauce and sesame oil.

First of all, please don't use seasoned rice vinegar. It has stuff in it we really don't want. Plain rice vinegar much better. I used brown sugar & added a pinch of red pepper flakes. Added 1 tsp of toasted sesame oil.
