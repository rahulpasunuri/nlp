Been on an Indian cuisine kick lately. Raita was in order. Made the yogurt as directed with a starter of store bought plain yogurt and 4% milk. Used my candy thermometer for to get the right temp. Incubated in my old camping Colemen thermos. Did not disburb for 5 hours. Turned out great. The raita was spot on, with some grated cucumber, diced fresh tomato, ground cumin and a diced Thai chili pepper. Will reserve some of my yogurt as a starter for the next time. Think I'll try some homemade granola to go along with the next batch.

I used the "pinky test" (no thermometer) and incubated in a thermos. Extremely easy and economical, and resulted in a very mild yogurt that doesn't require much sweetening, and has lots of versatility. My only complaint: I've made this twice, and the texture always comes out a little too goopy, rather than creamy. Any thoughts on how to remedy this? I've been using skim milk and a commercial yogurt base the first time around, my own the second.

To: A Cook from Planet Earth: The process you describe is exactly how I learned to make yogurt from my Lebanese grandmother who had never even heard of a food thermometer. It was the pinky test all the way, I still do it this way. For those of you who want 'Greek' style, straining is easy. To the cook with the mess in the cheesecloth, if you let the yogurt drain longer, the part in contact with the cheese cloth will become very thick and then you can almost turn out the product in a clump. I start with two quarts of fat free milk and generally end up with about 1 quart of yogurt once it is strained. Yum!!

By now it's sounds trite, but I couldn't believe the texture and creaminess. I use a yogurt starter and a yogourmet and 2 qts of half and half. Please tell me how to add honey or agave in the cooking" process. It's too tart for me as it is now. Smoothies that I add sweetened fruit to are delicious.

I used to make my own home made youghurt and used a salton youghurt maker. I would make more but....does any one know if youghurt can be made with lactose free milk??

I've been making my own yogurt (yoghurt?) for a while now. I start with Stonyfield, because I like the taste, and it seems to work best at 115F. I make it in 1-qt yogurt containers, 2-3 quarts at a time, and I use a small lunch cooler filled with 118F water, and let it sit overnight (and sometimes well into the next day). I've tried thickening it with gelatin, but it was a disaster: all the gelatin coagulated and dropped to the bottom. Edible, but gross. Now I'm just happy with it the way it is. Add a spoonful of honey, and some homemade granola, and you've got a great breakfast!

Even after reading raves on various sites about how great homemade yogurt is I was still surprised at how delicious the flavor of this homemade yogurt is, yum. I let mine sit in the oven on "proof" for 12 hours, which is just the light bulb on and it was the perfect temperature. Funny cause it's way too hot for proofing bread so now I know after 15 years that the button should really be "yogurt"!!!! I was using raw milk so I heated it up to 180 because I was paranoid but understand that's not necessary.

My Armenian grandmother made her own yogurt ("madzoon" to Armenians) from the time she was a young wife and mother. But, when it became my turn, I was a little intimidated by the process. Until I discovered Crockpot Yogurt! It's sooo simple, you'll wonder why you havent done this sooner: Pour 1/2 gallon of milk (NOT Ultra High Heat Pasturized. It will not turn) right into the bowl of your crockpot; I use whole milk but you can try reduced fat if you wish. Cover and cook on low for 2 1/2 hours. Do not lift the lid! No matter how tempting (just like steamed rice). Turn it off and let it stand, UNOPENED for 3 hours. At the end of the 3 hours, ladle about 1/2 to 1 cup of the warm milk into about 1/2 cup starter in a bowl and gently whisk together. Dump that all back into the crockpot, mixing evenly into the rest of the warm milk. Cover with the lid and wrap in a thick towel or two. Let it stand for at least 8 hours. The whole process takes 13 1/2 hours (2 1/2 + 3 + 8) so calculate when to start so youre available for each stage at the right time. The longer you let it incubate, the tarter it will become. I like it sweeter, so I set my alarm clock for that 8 hours. Stir to even the consistency, ladle into dishwasher-sterilized containers with tight covers and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks. Be sure to set aside 1/2 cup as a starter for your next batch. Easy Peasy and delish! NOTE: it will not be as thick as store-bought. Some people use unflavored gelatin and other additions and methods to make it thicker, but I think it's perfect as is. In the morning, I treat my husband and myself to a small bowl of yogurt/madzoon drizzled with honey. Mmm! Sweet, creamy goodness!

This is not a review but a comment. To the cook from Reno on 04/12/12 - you need a starter. Unless you are going to take the chance and set out your milk and let it sour/ferment / 'yogurtise' naturally - many times - till you get something with a acceptable flavour - buy your starter or cadge it off someone. Most people who make yogurt are generous in giving out a spoonful to those who want it to start. As the cook from Planet Earth said - it's not rocket science. I too lived in africa and made yogurt at home as it was not available in the market. (where we lived - we pretty well had to make everything.) Our starter came from an Indian friend of ours who had brought it with her from India - where it had been in use in her family for at least 3 to 4 generations if not more. Do try making it - it's easy and very satisfying.

Buy a yogurt maker.

One way to increase the creaminess is to reduce the milk by simmering it till it reduces by about a third. Also,I don't really think you need a yoghurt maker - just keep your yoghurt in a bowl, covered, in a warm place to let the culture grow, much as you would for bread. And the tartness that comes with age when your yoghurt has been sitting is lovely with blackcurrants cooked in a little sugar!

I have been making my own yogurt for years (with a yogurt maker). It's much more common in Europe to do this. I recently tried the pro-biotics instead of the store bought yogurt and interestingly the "good one" from the fancy doctor in town worked fine as a starter, but the stuff from the health food store didn't do a thing! Makes you wonder what it is doing in your stomach...(nothing?) Sorry, but I cannot remember the brand names. Anyway, store bought yogurt does the trick just fine and is a lot cheaper. Yummy yoghurt every time.

It is good to see others making yogurt. I have been making Greek yogurt for almost a year. I heat the milk up in a 2 quart glass pyrex measurer in my microwave until it reaches 175 F. This takes about 16 minutes. I let it cool on a cooling rack with a flat freezer pack under it until it gets under 120 F. Takes maybe 30 minutes or so. Stir in 2 teas. previous yogurt. Heat my oven for 1 minute to get warm and then shut off. Turn on my oven light and keep on. This will help keep the oven warm. Cover the top of the Pyrex and wrap in a large towel. Set in oven overnight. Drain in the morning in my chinois strainer I bought from Amazon -- very efficient tool. Refrigerate and enjoy. I like to make a simple blueberry sauce with frozen blueberries, water, sugar, and cornstarch. Layer it with my yogurt in a clear plastic Ball brand freezer jam cup. Put the lid on and send it to school with the kids. They love it, too.

suggestions: use raw milk and get the beneficial enzymes (don't heat above 115 F or it destroys the compounds); filter out the whey until you get a fairly clear liquid, and use this for lacto-fermentation--I make pickled veggies of all sorts, chutneys, beet kvass, bread & fruit kvass, relishes etc.--see Sally Fallon's Nourishing Traditions for the simple recipes--also, be sure to save enough starter for the next batch

Great recipe and method for making home made yogurt. I add powdered milk and don't boil the milk before adding the culture am I flirting with disaster?

I've been making my own yogurt for a few months now using a very similar recipe that I got from my mother-in-law, a traditional Lebanese cook. It's delicious! I use lowfat milk and drain it for about 30 minutes in a colander lined with a kitchen towel so it's thick-ish. I make it a half-gallon at a time, and I usually get about 3 1.5-cup jars of yogurt. In fact, I have some setting right now! FYI, A Cook -- you only have to use commercial yogurt the first time you make it. After that, you use your previously made yogurt as a starter for the next batch. I don't use the ice bath, just let the pot cool on the stove -- I found that the ice bath cooled it down too quickly, and I've always been worried that the ice water will get into the pot somehow. Once I mix in the milk, I leave it in an unheated oven, covered with a lid and a towel, until it's ready.

@nokitchen - in my (long years of) experience, house made yogurt is always much milder than store-bought, though the acid-ish flavor intensifies somewhat over time. You could always stir some lemon juice into each serving, or vinegar, I guess. A much easier method of making yogurt - heat 1 half gallon milk, preferably not Ultra High Heat Pasteurized, in crock pot to 180. Unplug, let cool to 110. Stir in 2-3 Tbsp live-culture yogurt. Wrap whole thing in beach towel, let sit overnight. Wake up to great yogurt!

By coincidence, right before this posted I started making a yogurt using a recipe from another site (sorry!). The differences between their recipe and this one came down to a) they didn't call for the ice bath to speed cooling - indeed, they seemed to think an hour of so of exposure to local bacteria would be good for it; b) less milk in the starter and c) incubating 5 degrees cooler (at 105-110 as opposed to 110-115). My result wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. It was as if yogurt and sour cream had a baby. If I want it more yogurty and less sour creamy, what should I change next time? Less incubation time? Higher temperature? Also, the process fouled my cheesecloth beyond cleaning -- worse than when I make cheese! Is there a way to salvage it without throwing it in the wash and exposing it to harsh clothing detergents?

Hooray...I'd always wanted to try this - thanks epicurious. With some homemade granola and fruit...a perfect breakfast. The the reviewer from Reno, sarcasm is always hilarious when the person using it is ironically ignorant, so thanks for the laugh. No...it's not odd to start yogurt with store bought. You need the bacteria, so unless you have a genetics lab next to your kitchen you'll need it. If you tried making yogurt without living yogurt cultures you'd end up with a pot of lactococci bacteria (and possibly worse), which would taste terrible and make you horribly ill. So don't skip that step unless you're really pining for a visit to the emergency room.

I prefer the taste of my own vs commercial plain yogurts, with the exception of a particular Greek brand. And I know exactly what's in my yogurt when I make it. About 25 years ago I lived in Africa. My friends and I thought it was the closest we would ever come to pioneer living, and we shared yogurt cultures with each other. Our method was not quite the science project this recipe is. Scald 1 litre of milk, allow to cool until you can comfortably hold a finger in it for 10 seconds. Stir in 2 Tbl.starter, cover bowl and keep relatively warm but not too hot for about 8 hours. Refrigerate. Eat.

Anyone else think it's strange that purchased yogurt is a required ingredient to make "homemade" yogurt?
