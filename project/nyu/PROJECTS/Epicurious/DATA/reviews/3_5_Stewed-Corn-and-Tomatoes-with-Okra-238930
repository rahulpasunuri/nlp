Meh... It was kind of plain and boring... I used 2 jalapeños instead of one and my taste buds were still bored.

The key to this recipe is using very fresh and small okra. If it is large and "woody" it would not be good. But, everything was excellent even though I used frozen corn kernels.

Delicious! I wouldn't change one thing on this recipe.

This recipe is simple but savory and delicious. I used canned diced tomatoes to save time, but I think would really benefit from using fresh tomatoes. Added grated parmesan to the top. I agree about using a lid to keep the tomatoes from evaporating. I had to add extra water to keep it a little juicy or it would've gotten too dry. I chopped the okra into about 1 inch pieces and it worked out great - not too slimy at all. Next time I make this I might add sauteed almonds for a little texture change.

We loved this recipe, the sneaky kick from just the single jalapeno was a surprise, a delicious surprise!

Fantastic, easy recipe. I'd make it again any time. Just a few notes: I used 4 ears of corn, which gave a lot more than 3 cups, and I used 1 lb. of okra. I increased the other ingredients accordingly. I didn't have fresh jalepenos and my tomatoes didn't generate a lot of juice, so I added one can of extra hot Ro-Tel (and a dash of cayenne because we like it spicy). Worked great.

This is very good and very healthy, but just a tiny bit bland; tastes like a hearty vegetable stew. I would add scallions closer to the middle of the cooking, because I couldn't really taste them as per what the recipe asks to do. Or combining scallions with onions or shallots may add to the taste. Adding basil at the end was also a good suggestion. Fines herbes or herbes de Provence would probably work too. I will be making this again, though -- a good dish!

I Love shopping at the Farmers market. And when I saw this recipe I knew I was in for a treat. I've made O.C.T. before, but this ercipe with nothing but fresh vegitables from the market was superb! I did use cipoline onions instead of scallions, and a poblano pepper instead of a green pepper. Served with Mac & cheese, and fried chicken fingers Great! Everyone loved it. even my son who does not like okra...

Born and raised in Texas, I grew up on okra and hot peppers. This dish is good. But here are a few tweaks that I made: --- Use less butter than the recipe calls for (1/2). --- Use good fresh ripe (sweet) tomatoes: Early Girls, Sun Gold, etc. Size doesn't matter; they will disintegrate after cooking. --- I like less corn; 1 ear. --- Cut the tops off the okra right at the point where the pod starts to form. If you cut into the seedpod area your stew may be slimy. --- Use small okra for tenderness and so that it will be bite sized. --- Be careful that you don't evaporate all the liquid while this is cooking. Keep a can of chicken stock handy to juice it up just in case. And cook with the lid on after you sauté the scallions & peppers. --- I sprinkled a little chiffonade of fresh basil over the stew as one reviewer suggested and liked it - a subtle but nice improvement. Hey, tomatoes / basil, you can't go wrong. This is a good dish to make during the dog days of summer when the weather is hot and the ingredients are in season. Serve with a highly hopped beer from your local brewpub and some Cajun barbecue...umm.

I made this with black pepper and cayenne pepper instead of the jalapeno, a red instead of green bell pepper, and no okra. Also used grape tomatoes and just let them pop and break apart as they cooked. It was still delicious, and you can eat the leftovers cold.

I loved this, there didn't seem much to it in the pan until the end - make sure the okra is tender. It may need a little more salt than the recipe calls for, but other than that it's a delicious side dish for anything. I think you can serve it warm or room temp.

Very good but FYI -- it's fairly spicy! I would omit the jalapeno seeds next time to make it more versatile for picky eaters.

A delicious and savory dish using the prime produce of the season. I added fresh basil at the end to really perk up the flavors. Best served at room temperature, this dish travels well to pot luck gatherings.
