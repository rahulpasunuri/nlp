My husband made this recently and we LOVED the vegetables! As we are only two there were plenty left over which I served the next night with penne. I added some chickpeas and reduced the sauce and added a touch of cream (ok, so I would have used cream but for New Year's resolutions-actually used fat free half and half) and tossed it all together and it was fabulous! Will use the veg combo lots of ways for sure--next time might bake the lot with feta....

one of the worst, least-flavorful recipes i've ever made.

This turned out great. The steak was very flavorful. We did double the spice mixture for the rub, and I think that helped. The only problem I had with this recipe was the sauce. We were trying to keep costs down, so we substituted green peppers for the red, and that threw the flavors way off, so I don't suggest doing this. Otherwise, great!

Very good,sauce was delicious. I used spinach instead of arugula and served it over brown rice.Next time I would grill the steak instead of fry it.

Nice sauce. Considering how quick and easy this is I think its quite good. I'm tired of dark heavy sauces on my steaks so I found this refreshing. However to perfect this dish I think you have to do something with the meat. Someone else on this board mentioned marinating. Hmmmm.

This is just for the veggies. I found them a bit bland, added some crushed red pepper and a splash of red wine vinegar which helped. it was likely because I didn't have any fresh thyme on hand so will make again with that as it was very easy and I love cauliflower. I did add baby bellas as I had them on hand, and a handful of cherry tomatoes towards the end of cooking. it's a great way to eat veggies and a very versatile recipe.

The roasted vegetables were good, but the steak was not, and the sauce was pretty but didn't add much.

I made so many substitutions that I hesitate to review, but this is how I end up finding good recipes...much was dictated by what I could grab from the garden. For the roasted vegetables, I used some Japanese eggplant, shallots, red bell pepper, and one small Hungarian Hot Wax pepper, which added a bite to the whole dish. For the greens, a mixture of arugula, chard, and kale. For the sauce, I was out of broth, so used a 1/2 c. of white wine. Overall, a wonderful dish. But the sauce was the standout.

Has anyone barbequed this flank steak instead of sauteeing? How about marinating the flank steak?

Preparation for the steak was delicious, only think I would omit would be the arugula (and do baby spinach instead). Not a fan of that bitter stuff. The sauce was wonderful, will make it for other uses.

I made this recipe for a family dinner with eaters in every spectrum - picky, veggie haters, veggie lovers etc and got resounding applause. Everybody LOVED it. There are lots of veggies, and I was nervous about the cauliflower since its not my fave veggie...but it was so good that I used the leftover unprepared veggies to make another platter of the roast veggies a few days later. This was fantastic!

Excellant - exactly as presented. There are a LOT of vegies, enjoy!

I had everything in house but the arugula, so I substituted fresh baby spinach. Although it didn't have the same bite as the arugula would have added, with a bit more black pepper, and a quick twist of the sea salt grinder and an extra splash of the red wine vinegar there were no complaints. (Of course no one but I knew there was something to complain about!)Delish - a definite addition to the summer once grilling season gets under way.

I think it is just lovely

Simple, delicious, low fat and still very satisfying. I didn't sautee the flank steak, though. Instead, I roasted it, along with the vegetables, for 12 minutes at 500 degrees. Saved me cleaning the cooktop. My 3 year old loved the meat and especially the sauce! My only complaint is that it made twice as many vegetables as we needed, and we eat a LOT of veggies in our house! I think the veggies would have fed 6, but the flank steak no more than 4.

Supremely easy, fast and very tasty weeknight dish. Low fat is a bonus. Roasted veggies were great, the men of the household loved the steak preparation (tender and delicious), and the sauce (with a little more garlic) makes the dish.

This was fantastic! Flank steak isn't the most tender cut of meat, but cooked this way, mixed with the roasted cauliflower and peppers, it was so yummy! The red peppers were sweet and complimented the cauliflower perfectly. The sauce made from the garlic and red peppers (I added a lot more garlic cloves than it called for, we love garlic) was superb, and MADE this dish. Could have eaten that by the spoonfuls.

I doubled the garlic, added an onion and used multi-colored peppers for the vegetable portion. I only had dried thyme. It was all delicious. My husband gave it 4 forks; my children and I gave it 3 forks. I'll definitely make it again however. I served it with a rice pilaf and a deep cabernet.
