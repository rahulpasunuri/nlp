Easy and delicious. I have always avoided cheesy bread because it looked so unappealing and unhealthy but making this myself helped me realize that with good ingredients and a recipe like this it can truly be an indulgence and an accomplishment rather than a habit.

Very easy to make. Cut bread slices into 4 pieces for finger food and added small sprig of rosemary to each toast.
