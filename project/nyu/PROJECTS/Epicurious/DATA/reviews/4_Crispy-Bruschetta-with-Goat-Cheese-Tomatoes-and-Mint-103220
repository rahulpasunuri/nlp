Really good and easy make ahead appetizer. Can make the tomato mixture and toast the bread ahead of time. Then combine and pop in the oven just before guests arrive.

Followed the recipe exactly. Mint with goat cheese and tomatoes may be my new favorite. Basil is nice, but the mint was really fantastic.

These are sooo good, the mint makes this. I always make extra tomato mixture.

Yummy. Easy. And the mint rocks.

These are AMAZING!! The only adjustment I made was adding garlic to the tomato mixture. I would not substitute basil for the mint -- the mint is so unexpected and refreshing. I own a catering business and this is one of my new favorites!

these were unexpectedly really good--not your normal bruschetta!

Although I am a big fan of goat cheese, not everyone is. So, instead of using the goat cheese on the toast, I chopped up some fresh mozzarella cheese and added it to the mixture. I'm sure the mint would have been fantastic with the goat cheese, but it still worked really well with the mozzarella. It was gone in about 30 minutes (between 7 people).

Stick with the mint! Basil's fine, but a different recipe. Yummy. We kept eating the appetizers for dinner. A good showcase for heirloom tomatoes that tend toward sweet or rich, rather than citrusy.

Took these to a party (broiled them there)...also topped with grilled shrimp. Everyone was asking for more, even the people who didn't think they liked goat cheese!

I also used basil. Delicious and quick.

I don't know why so many people have substituted basil for mint. It might seem counter-intuitive, but the mint is fantastic. I added minced garlic straight to the tomato mixture. The last minute prep is a little bit difficult to keep under control- answering the door, introductions, and broiling the goat cheese just before assembly was kind of tricky.

I'm only giving this recipe three forks since I altered it, however, this is very easy, aesthetically pleasing and scrumptious! Chopping the tomatoes in the food processor made things super easy and fast. I used freshly snipped basil instead of mint. I mixed the basil with the tomatoes rather than sprinkling on top at the end. Let the tomato mixture sit for at least an hour at room temperature so the flavors infuse. Enjoy!

Lots of chopping but worth it. Took it to a party and everyone went wild for it. Substituted mint for basil and added 3 cloves of chopped garlic to the tomatoes. Brushed Olive oil on bread before toasting, then after toasting rubbed garlic and salted the bread. I doubled the receipe, and bought a large baguette and made lots of small bruschetta for a larger party.

Great dish! I modified it to save time and effort and to use ingredients on hand. I added the basil (no mint) directly into the tomato mixture and threw in a few tablespoons of minced calamata olives and a few teaspoons of pureed roasted garlic. Instead of goat cheese, I used feta, which I mashed and nuked to make it spreadable. I skipped the final heating step and just served the cheese and the tomato mixture in separate bowls with the toasts on the side, so that my guests could make their own (saves time and effort). Everyone loved them!

YAY to Epicurious reviewers for rec. the basil instead of mint. Great!

Wonderful and easy! I made this a few hours in advance of a dinner party I was hosting. I used basil in place of mint. I imagine this would be great on its own with a salad for a quick dinner.

This dish was so good last night that we are having it again tonight! Like the others, I used basil instead of mint.

I read all the reviews and substitued basil as well. I let the chopped tomatoes, lemon, salt and pepper marinade a bit and it was out of this world! I smashed and schmeared some garlic on the toasts first...Some I made with feta on the toasts, and some plain, without cheese. My husband is still dreaming about them.

Like everyone else, I changed this to some degree. I left out the mint and mixed chopped garlic and chopped basil in with the tomato. I made this for a catering job I did, and people loved it - said it was the best bruschetta they had ever had.

I made this dish for our superbowl get together and it was great! All of us loved it and I'll be sure to make it again.

Like previous reviewers, I used basil and garlic, but I also added lots of grated parmesan, anchovies (yummy!), fresh ground pepper, and a splash of olive oil.

I also used basil instead of mint and it was fabulous. We used both grated mozzarella and the goat cheese (a little cheaper on the budget!) and both versions were very tasty. Our guests enjoyed the ease of eating them.

Our guests raved. Substituted fresh basil as others suggested. Made both bread and tomatoes a few hours in advance - refrigerated tomatoes until approx. 1/2 hour before using. Looks great too.

We made this with fresh basil, but otherwise kept to the original receipe. At a recent party, this was the first hor'dorve that disappeared, and the requests for the receipe went on all evening. We definitly will make this again and again!.

Because of the mint I make this for Easter while we are waiting for dinner. Very nice recipe.

This was great! I slathered the toast with roasted garlic first, then spread the goat cheese on top of that. I substituted fresh basil for the mint also. Easy, and most of the work can be done ahead (toasting and chopping tomatoes). This will become a regular.

I agree with adding the garlic to the chopped tomatoes. I also substituted basil for the mint. These were gone in five minutes. It was also the first time I had goat cheese. I didn't know it was relatively low fat. Very yummy.

This dish had a great, intense flavor. Instead of rubbing the bread with garlic, I just squeezed a handful of cloves in with the chopped tomatoes. It was delicious. My boyfriend loved it as well, it gets a thumbs up from both of us.

You cannot be wrong with this appetizer. I usually add crushed garlic to the tomato mixture to reinforce the garlic taste.

I have served this delicious appetizer a dozen times and it's always a hit with guests. It's easy to prepare and fail-proof. Sometimes I add diced kalamata olives. I tend to substitute fresh basil for the mint. Try it and enjoy!

This was absolutely delicious! I just love bruschetta, and the combination of cheese and tomatoes were divine! However, I live in a smaller town and could not get my hands on any mint, so I had to leave it out... But it was still amazing.

It was a tasty hors d'oeuvres. A great way to use the tomatoes in the summer. I used basil instead of mint.
