I use fingerling potatoes (red, white, yellow, purple) from Costco and use roasted garlic olive oil. I do them on convection roast at 375 degrees for 35 minutes, add the rosemary and roast 10 to 15 minutes longer, until nicely browned. I serve them with various things, including a fantastic pot roast recipe I have and they always get rave reviews.

It was OK. I thought the cooking time of an hour was too much. Next time I'd add the rosemary in at the beginning

Simple and tasty. I always mess around with roasting potatoes, with inconsistant success. This recipe turns out great. I cooked it in my convection oven at 400 for about 30 min, stirring twice. Added the rosemary and it really only needed about 4 more minutes. I should have lowered the temp in general, but it worked out fine. The veggies were browned and delicious. Definately make sure your shallot and carrot are bigger than the potatoes, since they seemed to cook and brown faster. Also, I found that it all kind of shrank down, so keep that in mind when preparing for a crowd.

Quick and easy. Will make again.

I have been making this recipe for years and it is always a huge hit at dinner parties. I think the key is to cook the veggies enough to get them brown....I find I leave them in the oven longer than the recipe.

This recipe is nothing special, however, serves its purpose well (an easy side dish when busy preparing a large meal). I placed a brisket in a platter surrounded by the potatoes, carrots, and shallots, and it looked beautiful and was a simple and perfect compliment that everyone seemed to enjoy. Next time, I might use a variety of potatoes and some other root vegetables.

I made it for Christmas dinner along with a beef tenderloin. Everyone raved about the potatoes. I cooked them at least 30-45 minutes longer. The red potatoes hold up well and they were perfectly roasted. The carrots are sweet and make for an attractive side dish. The shallots are expensive but worth it in this recipe.

I love roasted vegetables and the combination of potatoes and carrots with shallots is great. I served it with Mustard Rosemary Roasted Game Hens (this site also). I will definitely make this again.

This was perfect with Lamb and Rosemary Pesto!

Roasting really brought out the sweetness of the carrots and shallots. Everyone loved it, even the non-vegetable eaters.

I thought this was a great way to prepare some vegetables for a meal. I find that fresh rosemary was the best way to prepare this and I have also added quartered mushrooms.

This was not very good. My husband hated it and my guests did not seem to particularly like it either. It was not particularly flavourful. I doubt if I'll bother to make this again.

We paired this with our Easter ham and had good results. I roasted the potatoes through the first baking and then cooled and refrigerated them overnight. Shortly before serving I sprinkled with the rosemary and completed the roasting. It took longer than 15 minutes since they were cold.

This was a great change from the ordinary roasted potatoes and carrots which accompany roast beef. The rosemary and roasted shallots provided a delicious variation and "dressed up" this traditional Sunday evening dinner!
