Made this for friends and would add more roast beef and a little less blue cheese. Used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar and my friends loved the flavor.

We were surprised at how good this was. We sauteed the onions for a few minutes because we were concerned the onions would be too strong, and we doubled the vinegar & sugar marinade so there was enough liquid for the 2 cups of onions. Will definitely make again.

Great combination of flavor

I really liked this recipe. I toasted the bread with the blue cheese on it. I was afraid that it might be too dry, but the onions make it moist enough.

I made these as finger sandwiches to take on a boating trip. I used white bread from my farmers market (not too thinly sliced, or I feared they would get soggy). I mixed blue cheese with some sour cream to make it spreadable. They were a huge hit.

As a dedicated food expert, I am somewhat chagrin to admit this was one of my family's favorite dinners ever. Really no culinary skills involved here at all. Just be sure to purchase best-quality roast beef and the freshest rolls. I buttered my rolls and grilled them. I finally had to admit that I liked them too and they are perfect for a busy family (such as ours) on a weeknight. Would also be great for large scale entertaining. And finally...will be trying the onions and blue cheese on hamburgers. Needless to say, I will be making over and over again. Hey I'll take the praise whenever I can get it!

Took these sandwiches on a "picnic" to our evening childbirth class and turned out beautifully. Great for when you are worried about the sog factor. Used ciabatta rolls instead of wheat, yummy!

Made this dish twice for lunch in one week. Easy to make in advance and the sandwiches are excellent.

i made this exactly as written with the exception of the bread (used local bakery bread), & it was fantastic! i didn't end up using nearly all the onions though (perhaps that's why one reviewer thought they were overpowering). i ended up using the excess onions on salads, which was also very good.

I was pleasantly surprised on the wonderful mix of flavors this sandwich provides.

This piqued my interest because of the combination of beef and blue cheese and the need for working food for a client (hand food that doesn't drip all over the desk while working through lunch...). I made it, thought it tasted better with feta and worked better with a faint smear of mayonnaise to hold the bread to the filling. Also, I sliced the red onion paper thin and sauteed with a hint of olive oil (and about 1T of water) until wilted, before removing from heat and adding the sweet-sour sauce. It tempered the bite of the onions, yet still gave a nice crunch to the sandwich. I also increased the amount of beef in the sandwich by about half. I would make this again - my clients agree they would eat it again. Always a nice compliment...

Frankly, I was disappointed. Since I knew that I had a very, very hot red onion, I only used 1-1/2 cups red onion, and adjusted down the amount of vinegar and sugar accordingly. None of the whole 3 food stores in this town had watercress, so I substituted leaf lettuce, to which I added pepper and mustard powder. (My research indicated that watercress is a member of the mustard family and is a bit hot.) Anyway, all we could taste was the onions and a bit of the blue cheese. The roast beef and tomatoes were lost somewhere. I'm sure I can salvage this one, but I'm not sure it is worth it. Diane

Made these for a tailgate. They were gone in a flash.
