Great stuff. Added garlic and red onion to radishes and finely chopped cilantro as a garnish. Also recommend using smoked salt and/or pepper on liver if possible. just adds another layer of flavor.

Very nice. Think I'll throw some garlic in the pan next time.

Balanced, understated, unexpected, and uncomplicated---a welcome combination resulting in a good dish. Nice presentation, too----an important consideration when serving chicken livers.
