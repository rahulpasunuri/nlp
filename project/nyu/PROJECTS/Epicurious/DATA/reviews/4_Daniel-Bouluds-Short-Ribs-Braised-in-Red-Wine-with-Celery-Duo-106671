Ok- this recipe is absolutely delicious. The 3 bottles of wine were perfect and not overpowering. I think the key is to make sure you burn the alcohol off. If you skip this step it will not be the same. I only used 1 qt of beef stock. And as far as the review goes from the "snobby chef" - get a grip!! This dish is fabulous!! Maybe you just didn't prepare it correctly?

Four forks for the celery mashed potato. Spectacular. I braise quite a bit, but this was a little too heavy on the wine - nice novelty but a better sauce would IMHO trade one bottle of wine for beef broth.

Excellent dish and very velvety rich sauce. I nixed the braised celery. Celery root puree was a lovely complement and nice surprise as a starch. I made this twice, once the night before and once the morning of. I STRONGLY recommend making it the night before as suggested because the sauce is far less thin and has a much better finish. The difference between the sauces is...well, night and day.

This was so good it nearly brought me to tears. We followed the recipe and used grass fed beef.

This recipe (including the celery duo) is spectacular. The only change I made was that I used two instead of 3 bottles of wine. The short ribs in my area are decent, but not huge enough to warrant 3 bottles. Chilling and reheating the next day is key. Don't skimp on the celery dishes. You will be amazed. I still dream about this dish.

I cook at a restaurant where the chef is one of the top 5 most famous chefs in Italy, (currently in the USA) Tours with the most famous Italian chef. All i mean to say is i can season correctly ;). I don't say this to brag but I too followed daniel's recipe directly from his book and the sauce just tastes like wine with not much complexity and my beef stock was good though Italians don't put mushrooms in their stock, I did anyway. The short rib needs to have two things done: not overbraise for risk of all the fat melting, and rehydrate in the sauce as braising paradoxically sucks moisture from the meat. Just an ok recipe he's not sharing his full secret is my thought. I also made his French onion soup but IMO Thomas kellers recipes are better

Make the recipe for Provincial style short ribs instead. That one is always great. This recipe wasn't bad or anything, but it was a lot of work and the simpler alternatives, IMHO, are superior in taste. The sauce is rich and delicious, but I just don't think it was as good as a red wine - beef broth - tomato combo sauce. The ingredients were expensive, and three bottles of quite good wine went into ours, but to me it just tasted like plain meat in a wine-heavy reduction sauce ... although our guests raved.

I am surprised at the number of great reviews for this recipe. I made it as written and it tasted like meat in a wine reduction. So what? Three bottles of wine and three quarts of stock struck me as far too much for eight short ribs and it was.

Rating: 4
I've made this several times and loved it. The only way I've found to step it up a notch is to use homemade beef stock (which is doubtless what Chef Boulud intended) and I finish the sauce with a touch of butter. Great served with celery root puree but I prefer to serve it with parsnip puree that has a hint of horseradish in it. I've also adapted it for use in my pressure cooker by using only 2 bottles of wine. I reduce the wine as directed, then add the beef stock and reduce the combination further.

I hardly ever review recipes, but as i found this one on food and wine a few years ago, and thought I had lost it forever, I am sooo glad to see it here. It has remained my most decadent and beautiful short rib recipe to date. LOVE it. Don't sacrifice a step or change a thing. The only thing i do differently is make it with a parsnip puree, only because sometime celery root is a bit of a pain.

Rating: 4
Everyone loved this fabulous dish despite it being time consuming but not difficult. The only changes I made to the recipe were: 1. Used two bottle of good red wine and about 2 cups of port--the quality of these wines are what make it so wonderful, so don't use complete plonk. 2. Instead of removing the veggies from the pan at the end to make the 'braise/gravy', I just took my hand blender and went to town in the pan and then boiled it all down....DELISH--people were using the sauce as 'butter' on their bread!!! 3. Served with smashed fingerling potatoes infused with garlic butter & parma under the ribs instead of the celery duo along with some patty pans roasted in the oven with just olive oil, S&P. Perfect dinner party....

Absolutely wonderful! I served this for a friends birthday party with the celery root/potato mash and braised carrots. It was perfectly delicious. It is time consuming but when made as recommend, it's really helpful and it tastes better (I ahve done it all one day before so I have a comparison). Having it braise and chill one night then clearing off the fat and reducing and rechilling overnight actually make the night of the dinner party really really easy! The mashed potato/celery root I also made before the party and heated up slowly. Another tip, I made following recipes from this site at the dinner: asparagus mushroom tarts into bite size servings, the fennel tangerine salad and the flourless chocolate cake from Gourmet. It was just one delicious course after another.

I did the recipe over 2 days and while it was much time, they were so tender and delicious it was well worth the effort. Served over mashed potatoes with fresh chives added. Side dishes were sweet potato ravioli with sage butter and stuffed tomatoes. Served with a Cab. Huge hit at a dinner party.

This recipe is VERY time-consuming, but practically foolproof if made as written. It was a huge hit at my dinner party: the short ribs were exceptionally tender and the flavor of the braising liquid was wonderfully balanced. One guest declared the meal a religious experience.

The meat fell off the bone while braising, which is a testament to how tender the dish was. I substituted an onion for shallots and a can of diced tomatoes for the tomato paste.

A phenomenal show-stopper of a meal. Get the best organic grass-fed beef short ribs you can find that are still on the bone - this adds so much to the flavor of the sauce. One of my favorite recipes ever! I'm growing celery and celeriac in the garden this year just for this recipe!

Excellent recipe and well worth the prep time. The recipe itself is very simple, but the steps take time and patience to produce the best results. I started on Friday for a Sunday dinner, and followed the recipe exactly as written. This is comfort food at its best! Served with potato puree, buttered peas, snowflake rolls and a good Cabernet.

Great. I did with bones removed and meat cut into half pound portions. Took the full length bone and cook them in the micro wave for 15 minutes to get fat off then put it in the braising juice. I served over a NY times recipe for Carolina Gold Heirloom rice cook in broth with bacon and onions was great.

An abfab restaurant quality dish. I combined the red wine with marsala and sherry as suggested. The only other change I made was to add a teaspoon of red chilli flakes. The braised celery was suprisingly good.

Great Recipe. I made this at Thanksgiving and it got rave reviews from the entire family. It was even better reheated the next day. I didn't make the celery puree because we had enough side and it went great with stuffing and mashed potatoes. I went with others suggestion of using a cab, marsala, sherry and merlot and it turned out great. This is a recipe I will hold on to and make again for sure!

Loved this recipe! I did cut it down becasue I had 1.5lbs of ribs from our CSA (3 meaty ribs) and so I cut the wine to one bottle, the stock in half, the garlic to 5 cloves, and the shallots to 4. It worked beautifully. I had no problems flambeeing the wine it reduced to 1 1/4 cup. I didn't skim the fat while cooking, I did use a gravy seporator once removing the veggies, and still only had a scant 1/4 inch of fat in the seperator. I reduced the braising liquids to 1 1/5 cups and it was DIVINE! unctious and rich and wonderful I would make this for the sauce alone! enjoy!

I made this for a dinner party tonight and it was delicious! This is the first time I feel compelled to write a review! A few things: 1) I couldnt get the wine to flame (probably a good thing since I just read the post about the army woman melting her stove) 2) I used 10 short ribs with everything else the same, and 3) I served over mashed potatoes. Divine!

Great recipe. Boulud's meat recipes are usually excellent. There's an ambiguity here about the quantity of meat vis a vis wine. I've made this several times, but I wonder what Boulud means by 8 short ribs. Is it what people normally get at the butcher, which is 8 pcs of meat, roughly 1.5-2 inches wide, 8-10 inches long with 2-3 pieces of bone-- which is frankly an extraordinary serving for one person. Who could eat all of that? Or is it a short rib piece with one bone, about 2" x 3"? Approximate weights would have helped here. I've also made this recipe with a third to a half of the wine suggested. While it's not as rich, it's still quite good.

Rating: 0
This is the best short rib recipe I have ever used and I have tried plenty. I used a combination of wine, including Sherry, Cab and Marsala. The celery duo was fantastic. Great for entertaining as the whole think can be made the day before. And, a beautiful presentation. This is my new favorite for entertaining.

Made this for Valentine's Day and it was a total hit. I followed others' instructions and browned the meat in the oven. I did not fire the wine, though that was what originally drew me to the dish. Def. make this a 2 day prep, as the flavors deepen over night in the fridge. In fact, this was best 3 days out over whipped potatoes. I saved some of the shallots as they were so tasty for serving. The only challenge was finding a cooking vessel large enough to hold all this meat for both stages. I ended up using a large roasting pan for the browning that I sealed with foil and then 2 La Cruesets for the braise. This recipe is not difficult, even though all the stages make it seem so. Perfect for a winter dinner party since everything can be done ahead of time.

Tried this last weekend for dinner party. Made double+ a bit extra and used 5 bottles of wine ( 4 red one ruby port) in the sauce. After reading comments about flaming decided to flame it outside on my BBQ!..worked like a charm. This is a wonderful recipe. I started in the am.. did the oven browning of ribs, did all as per recipe with a few minor changes. Didn't do the skimming every half hour.. just cooled sauce and skimmed fat one time ( most fat was gone during browning stage). Ribs in sauce were complete night before party. I can't bear to throw out the wonderful vegetables so pureed them then used them next day to thicken sauce slightly after rewarming gently in oven while we had courses one and two. Served with the celeriac and did parsnips in maple syrup and dijon as well. This is a real keeper! Sent some home with everyone for their lunch next day and had eneough for Sunday meal on a tray in front of the fire and the football game. The great thing about this, besides of course the incredible flavor of the sauce and melt in your mouth meat, is the aspect of being able to cook the meat and the celeriac completely ahead and then just rewarm them.. with absolutely no loss of flavour.. in fact I agree with other reviewers this is even better on day two. I started the meal with some fois gras and persimmon on toast, then made the Belgian leek and goat cheese tart ( Bon Appetit Oct 08)with green salad then served the ribs. The Leek/cheese tart is a perfect intro to the ribs. Finished with spicy baked pears, homemade vanilla ice cream. My guests all raved about these ribs. I will definitely be making these again.

Made this this weekend over 2 days. It was delicious and the ribs were tender without fattiness. I followed another reviewer's tip about browning in the oven. Worked beautifully. Browned for an initial 45 minutes at 450, then drained fat with bulb baster, and put back in for another 20 min. Removed ribs and put wine in the pan and lit it on fire. Flames went up about 14 inches and took about 10 min to burn out. Boiled sauce down for a few hours the next day after putting ribs and sauce in separate containers in fridge overnight. Took off a good layer of fat (didn't do the every 30 min thing b/c too much trouble.) Sauce needed a little sugar b/c the wine had a bit of a bitter aftertaste ($10 bottle of wine.) Made 24 2-3 inch short ribs (English style) and used 4 qts beef stock and 3 bottles red wine and 1 bottle ruby port. Doubled other ingredients. Most of the work is done in the oven. I also lowered the oven temp in the recipe to 300 for 2 1/2 hours (trust Cooks Illustrated recipes more.) Turned out beautifully! Very delicious. Impressive.

Rating: 4
So, so good. I made this pretty much as specified EXCEPT at last minute discovered that my pantry was stocked with chicken broth instead of beef broth, and it was still delicious. I agree with others that the braised celery is a good mild contrast to all that richness, but is not itself as special as the celery root puree, the short ribs, and the sauce; I think next time I'll try a simple green salad to serve the same function. The only other thing I'll play around with is the defatting process, which might not need to be so time-consuming. I'll try skimming less frequently and hope to leave more fat (and therefore a more cohesive, more easily removed mass) than I did this time. . . . I agree with others that the amount of short ribs to use isn't entirely clear. I ended up using 5 pounds comprised of 8 smallish ribs and 4 larger ones in a 7.5 qt Dutch oven, amounts otherwise per the recipe, and it was perfect. One rib is an ample serving but they were so good everyone went back for seconds and we skipped dessert.

As the rest said, this is very easy and very good. I used 2 qt of beef stock instead of 3 and the sauce turned out great. To the sauce I added 1 TB of sugar and 1 tsp salt and 1 TB corn starch to thicken. I did not have time to for the overnight defatting part...I just put the sauce in the freezer for 30 min and skimmed what I could. Still was very good. The celery duo was a hit as was the braised celery. This dish is impressive and presents very professionally so guest love it. No wonder Boulud is a huge celeb chef!

Delicious! Used two bottles of ruby port and regular ol' beef stock in the tetra pak. Found it hard to find enough fat to skim during the 30 minute intervals, but it was easy to scrape the fat off the next morning after cooling in the fridge. Served with Creamy Polenta and broiled broccoli for the in-laws. Definitely a weekend preparation, with the overnight in the fridge, but very easy. Everyone raved!

Great. Puree is fantastic (I cut the butter in half and added a couple of parsnips). The meat falls off the bone. The sauce is delicious. Did the overnight refrigeration; reduced the sauce and served two days later and it was still excellent. I'd make at least 2 ribs per person.

Prepared this for a dinner party a few weeks ago and what a hit!!! Prepare the day before to remove the fat as suggested. My company was not wild about the celery root so, though I liked it, next time I will likely serve with mashed potatoes or polenta. This was a lot of work to make, but worth all the time spent!!!

Thank you Mr. Boulud - This recipe is simply FABULOUS. Honestly, try making short ribs any other way, then try this and come back and tell me what you think! I made this for a dinner party 3 months ago and am still receiving compliments and requests for me to make it again! I'll admit that during the process I thought it was a wee bit time consuming, but in reality, it cooks for hours by itself, chills for hours by itself, then cooks again by itself. Very little involvement on my part. If only we could skip the tedious fat removal part... You can definitely skip the flambe part if you're timid about that kind of thing. I won't lie - it enhances the flavor - but not so much that many would notice if it hadn't been done. I also add an extra bottle of red wine during the reduction stage and recommend using at least 2 bottles of Ruby Port for a most delicious sauce. My guests actually asked if they could take leftover sauce home with them to use on other things! Only professional kitchens have the size skillet needed for this job, so I also recommend that warming, browning and reducing be done in one or two large pots on the stove top and braising in large roasting pan(s) in the oven.

Rating: 4
I have no idea why anyone would think this is a difficult recipe. The technique is just braising with a simple twist. Daniel Boulud is one of those chef's that was raised around food and it shows. He is able to sqeeze every last bit of flavor out of humble ingredients. My advise is to make this recipe more than once. That is what's required for good results on any recipe. Being brilliant the first time you try a recipe is not talent, it's just dumb luck.

My family said this was good, but not as great as some other things that are this much trouble. I had no difficulty with the flaming process. It seemed like a huge amount of wine and a lot of steps including waiting a day to get rid of the fat. I plan to try something simpler next time to eliminate some steps and see if it is just about as good since this did not get rave reviews.

i anticipated much more after reading all the reviews,but...found the sauce to be too bland tasting and ribs too greasy even after good browning. i will try parboiling the ribs first next time and reducing the cooking time. also i recommend getting ribs in asian (korean) market - they are much less fatty.

Simply amazing. Definitely follow the advice from others and refrigerate the ribs overnight. You can then easily skim the fat off the top, and the sauce is even more favorful the next day. Other than that, I followed the recipe and was extremely pleased with the results. If you have a meat-and-potatoes-only man (or woman) at home, they'll love these ribs!

The amount of braising liquid may initially seem excessive, but it is not. I've made this recipe several times. And each time, I experiment by adding different combinations of wine...red table, port, madeira, marsala. My favorite combo is one-third each of red table, port and marsala.

Fabulous! And the Celery Root Puree is a lovely surprise--what a wonderful twist on the usual mashed potato. You need a REALLY big pot for the ribs, though--it's a lot of liquid. Cooking down the sauce takes quite a while, too--definitely a day-ahead recipe. Be sure to turn down the lights when you set the wine on fire, it's really beautiful to watch.

Very, very good. Served it over a mash of carrots, leeks, and parsnips at a dinner party for German and British colleagues. Everyone had very high praise for the dish. One Complaint: I don't think that the recipe is very clear about the quantity of ribs to use. So, I was forced to refer to another recipe to get my quantities straight. I used about six-seven pounds of English-style short ribs, which worked out fine. Not having a braising pan large enough to accomodate all of the ribs, I used a non-stick roasting pan and covered it tightly with heavy-duty aluminum foil. Oh, like another reviewer noted, lighting that boiling red wine is quite the spectacle. A word of warning, don't put the pot on the back burner. I melted the plastic knob on my cheapo Army-issue range!!! One other suggestion. Instead of browning the ribs on the stovetop, try doing it in a 400 degree oven for about 40 minutes, removing the rendered fat about half way with a metal bulb baster. I picked that trick up from an article in "Cook's Illustrated" and find that it makes life alot easier - and cleaner!

Truly beyond compare! Both the meat and the sauce are incredible. I think the key is to leave this in the fridge overnight to get the fat off easily. I made this with about 12 short ribs and the same amount of everything else, and I had plenty of sauce. It takes a long time to reduce after you remove the meat, but the sauce just gets better and better, so leave plenty of time. Served it with the celery duo.

Made this in advance for Sunday dinner on a cold snowy day, and it was a great hit. There were some changes I had to make, however, due mostly to the need for a greater quantity. Because I had twelve guests to serve instead of eight, I used four bottles of Gabbiano Chianti (on sale) for the wine, and four quarts of Wild Oats low-salt beef broth, to make sure there would be plenty of sauce. The grocer was out of leeks so I subbed a large sweet onion. The ribs came in all different sizes and had a total of eighteen. I didn't have a large enough saucepan to flame and boil down four bottles of wine, so I used two large skillets. Did the same to brown all the ribs at once. To braise I tossed everything (including extra herbs and tomato paste) into a 16 quart stockpot. The liquid just barely covered the ribs. After three hours when the meat was falling off the bones, I removed them from the stockpot and refrigerated them on a platter overnite. I then boiled the liquid down to a little less than two quarts before straining and refrigerating overnite in an eight quart stockpot. After skimming the fat off the sauce the next day, I re-heated it slowly on top of the stove while re-heating the ribs on the platter in the oven to crisp them up a bit. Served over smashed tates. Delicious! Of course, by wanting to increase the number of portions, this also increased the labor (in part because my cookware has some gaps, increasing some steps). However, in the end it was all worth it because there was plenty of the wonderful sauce leftover (which I paired a few days later with a pot roast), the ribs were all gone with requests for more! Will definitely make this again.

Then, I doubled the recipe and made it for a Sunday night holiday supper party and my guests raved about it. Everyone loves it. The celery duo is definitely worth making. Very unusual and delicious. I had never made short ribs before because they look so fatty before they are cooked. But, this dish is very un-fatty because of all the prep work done to de-fat in advance. Highly recommended.

I've made this dish three times now, twice for small dinners, once for a big party dinner, and I adore it. Super-convenient, and delicious. 1) Use good drinking wine. Avoid too strong a flavor; especially avoid any hint of a bitter aftertaste. It tastes best with something smooth. 2) *Absolutely* leave it in the fridge overnight. This doesn't just make it easier to remove the fat, it greatly improves the flavor. 3) I generally use the boneless short ribs that Fresh Direct sells for convenience, but I also like to put in at least some on-the-bone ribs for flavor and keep the bones in the sauce as I cook it down.

Rating: 4
This is the second time making this dish. I was hesitant to use so much wine. Both times it came out fabulous. The second time my butcher convinced me to use the ribs with the bones. The only difference was that I had to remove the bones from the sauce after braising. I LOVED the celery duo combined with the red wine. The flavors came together so well. I will definitely archive this one.

I increased this dish to serve 12. It was the easiest 12 person dinner party ever! i made the ribs the day before and served them over the celery root puree (i skipped the processer and just passed them through a ricer). The ribs were delicious, and i wouldn't change a thing!

I just made this for the 2nd time and it was fabulous. I used 5 bottles of red wine and double the short ribs. There is alot of sauce, so why not?? I began a couple of days before as the recipe suggests. I served it with a root veggie puree and sauteed spinach. Simply devine.

This recipes got rave reviews from the family. I made it first with short ribs and then with a roast -- both worked well. Excellent for passover and other meals where you need a dish that won't dry out. Served mine with potato-parsnip puree the first time and herbed polenta the second time.

I was very nervous the whole cooking time that my wine was too bitter, and that the results wouldn't be good. I was also concerned that my meat wouldn't be tender enough. Was I surpised when I served this! It was so incredible. I served it with mashed potatoes w/leeks and some wilted baby spinache. I didn't have beef stock, so I used chicken and I couldn't fit all the liquid in my pan so I use 1/5 quarts stock and all the specified wine. Next time, I'll double the number of ribs so I'll have some leftovers after my company leaves.

this recipe was excellent. although it's very rich, I was able to reduce the fat a little bit by cooking the celariac and potatoes in skim milk, and by using about half of the butter in the celery root and potatoes puree.

This is probably one of the greatest recipes, complete with the celery duo, that I have ever made and I cook a lot. The first time it was for my husband and I and what a waste. This is definitely a made for entertaining recipe. I served to guests a few months ago and everyone raved. I originally got the recipe from the L.A. Times and accidently discovered it on Epicurious and am happy to be able to review it. A real bonus is that it can be made ahead so you can enjoy your guests.

I have learned an important lesson: just because everyone else gives a recipe 4 forks doesn't mean you'll like it. The main problem is that I don't like short ribs (learned the hard way, after spending 2 days and $50+ making this). They're exceptionally fatty and after cooking, look VERY unsightly. The sauce was nothing to go nuts for, it has a funky, don't-know-what-to-make-of-it taste. Honestly, I was very disappointed with this, but I guess if you just love short ribs this might do it for you. Lighting the wine on fire was quite fun, though.

Incredible dish. Lots of "WOW" from my dinner guests. I followed the recipe exactly except I separated out the fat at the end of the cooking time using a fat separator, then reduced. I also cooked more than 8 ribs (12) and I still had plenty of sauce. You could even make more if you wanted. I served this with mash potatoes rather than the celery puree. If you want to impress your guests this dish will do it! Amd the best part is it can be made in advance so you can enjoy your guests.

Very nice! Used only 6 ribs and cut the sauce in half. Still worked very well. Pureed the vegs before putting them through the strainer. Delicious!

The short ribs are wonderful--very rich flavor, very comforting. I added a bit of brandy and some butter to the sauce before serving. (Also, I reserved the carrots--they were too yummy to throw out.) I served the short ribs with the celery duo, which was delicious, and dressed up the dish nicely.

This recipie is perfect for entertaining- you want to impress but don't want to spend the entire pre-dinner period sweating over the main dish in the kitchen. I followed this recipie to the letter and was delighted. I suggest a quality Chianti, which is the wine I used. The sauce was so flavorful after being boiled down- I'm sure letting it rest overnight is the key to the sauce and the entire dish. The ribs were so tender that one could've used a spoon to eat them. I skipped the celery duo, opting instead for couscous which absorbed the sauce wonderfully. Make sure to get thick short ribs and really brown them well.

I only cooked the short ribs part of the recipe and they were fantastic. The 2 1/2 hour reccomended cooking time worked perfectly. As suggested, after cooking, I let it cool overnight in the fridge and easily removed the fat the next day. You will be left with a lot of liquid which reduces down to an wonderful, rich sauce which only needed a touch of salt and pepper. Be careful removing the ribs before you reduce the sauce, they will be extremely tender and fall apart easily.
