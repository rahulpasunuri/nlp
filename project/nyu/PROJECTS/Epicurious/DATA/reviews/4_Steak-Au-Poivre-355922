Easy, fast, delicious. Use you judgement on the cooking time. I did about 1/2 of the time for a rare steak and I vigorously spooned the liquid over the meat during cooking time.

This is good, just unbelievably rich. Definitely a crowd pleaser, but not so much on the waistline! And although the steaks turned out delcious and buttery, there isn't much complexity of flavor here - could use herbs or heat to kick it up. Solid for a treat dinner however.

We had this for Christmas dinner and it was absolutely delicious. My husband and sister-in-law were very happy. I used creme fraiche, mustard and Cognac instead of white wine. I would do it again in a minute!!!

This was awesome! I wasn't sure about the quality of the German Rump steak I had bought, so I halved it (into half thickness), coarsely peppered a side and using a meat pounder, pounded it in, salted it, flipped the pieces over and did the other side the same. It only took two minutes each side on med-high heat with some butter and olive oil in the Teflon pan. Worked wonderfully. I kept the steaks warm on the side. As I didn't have any crème fraiche on hand (very funny), or white wine, what I ended up doing was adding some red Cabernet Sauvignon to the pan, some Hickory seasoning salt, cracked black pepper, and some extra butter. I stirred it until it cooked down some, simmering, and added a quarter tsp. prepared mustard. The result was an opaque, thickened version of Au Jus. The steaks were wonderfully TENDER, and the sauce, YUM. I improvised to no end but they came out truly tasty. As for amounts, I always improvise, really only looking at the ingredients to add or not, rarely ever do I even look at the amounts. Well it's true. (Unless baking) I know what I like, I am just not a meat prep pro, YET. But this was great. :D:D Hedgez

This was my first recipe from Epicurious and my guests enjoyed it quite a lot. I did this recipe twice: once with mustard and once without. The mustard didn't add much to the sauce so I wouldn't put it again. Since there is nowhere to buy Buttermilk here in Brazil, I left a little heavy cream to sour overnight, and whipped it, that added a great texture to the sauce. The second time I did it, I let the stock reduce more than the two minutes suggested and the sauce came out velvety smooth. Just perfect.

Simple, easy recipe. I substituted heavy creme for the creme fraiche and beef consumme for the veal stock.

I agree with the second reviewer. What was confusing about this recipe? Simple and delicious.

This is a very good recipe. Don't let the first review fool you. You gave it 1 fork because of typo's?! Figuring out the right ratios for this sauce is not rocket science.

Typos! Steaks that are "4 pound" each? "4 cup" dry white wine? "4 cup" brown veal stock? Should these be "1/4" instead of "4" or something?
