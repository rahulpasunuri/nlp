This is the best and easiest appetizer. I've been making it for years - my kids, their friends, everyone, always ask that I make this. I use Parmesan and slice the baguette very thin. Broil until slightly browned. Done in a snap. Those who didn't like it must have done something wrong.

I've made this many times over the years to rave reviews and sometimes double the recipe. I have always used fresh Parmigano Reggiano or Grana Padano which are milder than Romano. Some finely chopped sundried tomatoes packed in oil (but well drained) give it a little kick, otherwise it's a bit bland. Don't forget a bit of fresh ground pepper as well.

3 stars for ease of preparation and for being budget-friendly. Don't pay extra $ for the bottled marinated chokes. I used my mini-prep to chop a 12oz. can of artichokes and 2 shallots then transferred to a mixing bowl. Next added 1/2c. grated Romano and 2T. mayonnaise. I minced 5 large mint leaves and folded those in as well. Spooned the mixture into an oven-safe crock, topped with 1T. additional Romano, and baked at 350F for 10 minutes using convection until hot and bubbly and slightly browned on top. Served with crusty slices of baguette and a juicy, mouthwatering'07 Cakebread Cellars Sauvignon Blanc. Thorougly enjoyed by all.

Yummy and simple. I used brushetta toasts from the bakery in our grocery store. Also, used parmesean since it's what i had - probably 1/4 c, finley grated. I also cut back on the onion a bit since the kids were eating it - they loved them.

This recipe has WAY TOO MUCH cheese! Fortunately, I had bought a 12 0z. jar of hearts, so I used the whole jar, and it was STILL too strong with cheese flavor! Thank God I also decreased the mayo as others suggested. My advice: find another recipe!

I have made this recipe before and have always loved it. I made it for a dinner party at a friend's house, so I doubled the recipe and just to add a twist, I added 5 thin slices of chopped proscuito ham into the spread and some cracked pepper on top before baking it. What great flavor!

I tried this for my husband and me because I had all the ingredients. I thought it was a waste of time and aforementioned. I think the rave reviews come from the results of serving this to hungry guests with a few too many! Wish I had tried the one above with mint, etc. It definitely needs tons of tweeking. Still have some - eat it on bread or crackers until it's gone forever. Don't waste your time. BLAH.

A friend made this for a volleyball party we were having and I ate at least 10 of them before they were even broiled. She did not use marinated artichokes and I believe the flavor of the artichokes in the spread was more present and less oily tasting as a result. When I make this, and I will do the same.

Rating: 4
Completely agree with the prior reviewers! Very very tasty. Followed rubydogg's advice and baked it at 400 for 15 mins and it turned out perfectly. Also, used only about half of the amount mayo in the recipe so it didn't dilute the artichoke flavor or make them too wet. Cannot wait to make these again!

Rating: 4
Raves for this recipe! I added a small mozzarella ball--chopped in half, using both halves--on top of each bit of the artichoke mixture. This "hides" the red onion, which makes people think twice about trying it. Great appetizer...and even reheats well for snacks a day or two later!

Agree with the reviewer that this one stuns for it's ease and simplicity. Everyone always loves artichoke dip but I needed something easy but more elegant as a part of the hors d'oeuvres course for our 8th Annual Progressive NYE dinner party. These hit the mark! I used a blend of parmesan,asiago,romano and provolone. Even the few that were leftover were yummy on NYD.

I have made artichoke dip for years, and it has always been a hit. I decided to try this for a change. It was quite good, but it doesn't have the same oomph as the hot artichoke dip. It is easy to make, though, and my guests were not disappointed.

I make this all the time with a little chopped parsley and a grated cheese blend of asiago, parm and romano. (the cheese blend is by DiGIorno.) You can make this from start to finish in less than 15 minutes. can't beat that!

Made this for a party - doubled the ingredients EXCEPT the mayo and it was a huge hit! Suggest not broiling however, as toast was browned/getting burnt before the mayo was fully cooked and artichoke spead had browned. Try cooking at 400 for 15 minutes or until golden brown. The leftovers were even delicious reheated. Will make again, and again.

This is one of those recipes that stuns in its ease & simplicity. No it's not gourmet, but for 20 minutes of work it's really good & half of what you need is probably in your pantry. Consider going a little lighter on the cheese and onion in order to let the artichoke dominate. Add the mayo incrementally until you get a good texture: moist but not creamy. I stopped before half the mayo that the recipe calls for; any more would have been overpowering. A sprinkling of lemon juice was nice. Beyond that, you'll see in the comments that people have added all kinds of things... it's a great simple recipe that you can modify to make it your own.

Rating: 4
I've made this dish (as written) many times and it's always the first appetizer to dissapear. It isn't my personal favorite because I'm not a fan of dishes heavy on mayo, however, I sometimes change the amount and add a dollop of sour cream instead. For a change I sauteed shallots in a splash of olive oil and white wine and added them to the mix. I've also used paremsan instead of romano and liked it even better. Some people mentioned toasting the bread first, which makes it more of a "true" burschetta, however, I've found most of my guests prefer the softer version rather than crunching into little toasts and causing an explosion of crumbs during a cocktail party. Either way, this appetizer is awesome and very adaptable.

Made along with goat cheese & red pepper recipe. This was the group favorite, but both disappeared. I was cooking like crazy so took a few shortcuts. I like the flavor of the artichoke marinade so did not pat dry. I also eyeballed the measurements(I am sure I used less mayo) and spread on toasted herbed ciabatta slices. They were large so sliced into two-bite size for serving. I didn't change the recipe this time, but might try some of the suggestions in future. Absolutely perfect as is in my book!

This bruschetta was so easy to make and so delicious! I added a glove of garlic, shallots, and chopped baby bellas to the onion and sauteed them in olive oil before mixing the ingredients together. I also added a little basil and pepper to the mix and sprinkled parsely on top. These are excellent!

This is an excellent recipe for a quick appetizer, using pretty much what you have in your pantry. I'm a Chef, so I spiced this particular recipe up with the addition of shallots, and goat cheese. It was delicious. I didn't use all the mayo either, it's not necessary. Also, this recipe really reheated well for lunch the next day with a salad :)

Rating: 3
I would agree with one reviewer - you don't need all the mayo (even if it's low-fat). That being said, this is so simple and so good. It works for a quick evening snack or I've even made with several other bruschetta recipes and served it as part of a "brushcetta sampler" for dinner parties and it always gets a compliment.

I agree with the previous reviewer that this is a good starting point, but needs something else. I used less mayo, and added some whole canned tomatos for flavour and colour. I also added chopped fresh basil. With these additions we thought it was very good.

Very easy, very good, but not great - a little bland. The only thing I changed was to add some chopped kalamata olives for a bit of interest and color. It was tasty, just didn't bowl us over. If I made it again, I might add a bit more cheese (or perhaps a better quality Romano) and/or some garlic. I also thought it tasted better at room temperature than when it was straight out of the oven. Definitely worth tweaking.

So simple and delicious. Since finding the recipe, I have prepared it several times. This recipe is perfect the way it is, I wouldn't change a thing. Try it, you won't be disappointed!

For an interesting twist...Finely dice three garlic cloves and saute in 1/4 cup of olive oil until goldenbrown. Discard the garlics and spread the garlic oil of the open sides of the bread before lightly baking. Then spread the artichoke mixture and proceed. Hey, add a can of drained anchovies for an additional kick. Wheeee.

I have made this for guests twice and both times it was great. Beside the flavor, the reason this is such a popular recipe is because it sooo easy.

Wonderful, simple and fast. I used the canned artichoke bottoms instead of the artichoke hearts because I don't like the leaves. I finely chopped the whole can of the bottoms. I agree, the bread should be baked on both sides first, the put the mixture on the bread and I baked them instead of broiling for fear I would forget them in the broiler and ruin them. They were all gone in no time. Can't wait to make them again. They are perfect for a party because as they cool , they are still delicious.

Easy and delicious! I cut down a bit on the onions and it was wonderful. I also used a few more artichoke hearts than the recipe called for to avoid using as many leaves. I used a toaster over and broiled them for about 10-15 minutes.

A few of the first to review this recipe were disappointed because this was given such high ratings. Apparently they felt that if "lots of time" wasn't spent on a dish, then it just "couldn't be rated 4 forks"....well, I cook a lot....I love spending hours cooking exotic, beautifully prepared, gourmet meals. I don't mind spending hours in the kitchen because I honestly love it, but once in a while I run across a recipe that is so simple and quick to make yet absolutely fabulous in spite of the ease.....and this is that recipe! This is something I will make again and again. My family and I absolutely loved it! Two things I agree on.......use a good quality, fresh parmesan cheese and lightly toast the bread on both sides first. I also baked, rather than broiled mine so I didn't have to worry about the edges getting too brown. They are even better after sitting a while, at room temperature. Try these.......they are simple but fantastic! Nothing wrong with that combination!!!

My guests loved it. Definitly lightly broil the bread first.

I have made this recipe many times and everyone just loves it. I have found that if you partially broil ahead of time and reheat (in foil slightly covered)later when ready to serve they taste even better.

So easy and so delicious -- and I am not an artichoke lover! These are simple enought to whip up for a weeknight dinner, and delicious enough for a cocktail party. I even used light mayonnaise, and it was still fantastic. Be sure to use fresh shredded romano cheese, not parmesan from a can. Just an idea: I think these might be more attractive with some fresh chopped parsley mixed in. I will definitely make these again and again.

I agree, good and easy. I got marinated artichokes from my Italian Deli, so they were extra good.

Everybody wants this recipe!! I wish I could keep it a secret.

This is a great quick appetizer. The flavours are wonderful, and it's so easy to make. Watch pretty closely, though, to make sure the edges don't burn.

Very simple and delicious. A perfect quick appetizer with ingredients that are often on hand.

Really liked this recipe. It was so simple to make. Like another person suggested, would toast both sides a bit first because the bottom doesnt get toasted when following the recipe. It would be a great thing to whip together if you have unexpected guests.

I can't believe this is the "favourite" recipe of all the wonderful dishes provided on this site. Although I'm an artichoke lover, many people are not, so really this was only rated by those who enjoy artichokes! Presumably the reason for making it often is that it is so simple.

Am i the only who is saddened that the most popular recipe on the epicurious website is garnered from a column entitled "Too busy to cook"? I realize that there are times when a quick dish is an imperative, but a favorite recipe? It seems that too many of those who belong even to the gourmand's circle of epicurious subscribers have lost their imagination, and their ability to prepare an elegant, challenging dish. Food should be a labour of love, in its preparation and appreciation.

Our dinner guests loved this recipe! I've made this three times this month alone; I only recommend that you militantly guard the broiler against burning the edges of the toast. Also, I like the idea of lightly toasting the bread to prevent sogginess.

Four forks and thanks to you, Harriet Tupler, for this simple, quick, and delicious treat. It will become a regular at our house.

After reading the other reviews, I was somewhat disappointed with this recipe. It was not as good as I thought it was going to be. I would toast the bread on both sides next time.

Absolutely fabulous and sooo simple too ! I've made this recipe numerous times since discovering it and will continue to do so for years to come. I find it's nice to serve a combination of traditional tomato basil bruschetta and this one together on a platter before a nice Italian meal or at BBQ's.

We had to use "Miracle Whip" and it worked beautifully. Quick and easy! Delicious!

Loved the flavor and surprisingly, so did my family (they're NOT artichoke lovers as I am). This is definitely on the 'make again many times' list.

Great change for choke lovers rather than the usual dip. Have made it for three Mardi Gras parties and it's been a huge hit!

You can use "Light" mayo and it tastes just as good and has a lot less calories and fat. They are addicting!
