Delicious! Used frenched boneless chicken breasts and only had time to marinate for a couple of hours, but was by far the best chicken in awhile. The tomato jam (made from freshly picked ripe tomatoes) was wonderful and really complemented the chicken. This is a definite keeper!

A simple but lovely way to do chicken. We were surprised by an all-day rainstorm, so forwent grilling and baked instead at 450 F for 45 minutes. Only marinated for about 8 hours, but still ended up with a delicious garlicky, rosemary-infused meat...can only imagine what overnight would do. Skipped the tomato jam due to time and served with roasted balsamic farmers' market vegetables and the green onion and buttermilk biscuits on this site - fabulous summer supper!

Loved this chicken! I marinated the chicken for several hours, then partially baked in the oven, in the marinade. I finished cooking the chicken on the barbecue. It was moist and delicious. The tomato jam, which I made from fresh garden tomatoes, was excellent. I used double the amount of smoked paprika to give it more flavor. I made a double batch of the jam to can for use in the winter.

I made this with great success as a gift for some new parents. I used a lot less rosemary, though. The cooking time on the grill was perfect. I agree with the other review that overnight marinating works the best. I don't even really like chicken, and I loved this!

We've been making a version of this for years, it is incredibly yummy. It is key to marinade the chicken for a minimum of 3 hrs, I prefer overnight for good flavor. We love this with ceasar salad and grilled squashes from the garden.
