Very good and easy, but a little tricky to flip out of the pan. The carmelized sugar is the key to this tart!

I think the next time I make this I will cook on the stove top until it is a light golden. As it was it got too dark after baking in the oven. I will make again as it was super easy and tasty, even if a bit overdone.

Very fun, and easy. Word of caution, if your skillet has a pour lip (like mine does), do the flip over something easy to clean, like the sink, and not your stove top :( And, if you make the mistake I made, clear it immediately, before it hardens. Have fun.

Wow! Easy and terrific tart! Theres no Leftovers from this one!!! We stuck to the recipe and used the ginger cream to top it, was just perfect. Whoever wrote this gem has a great combo of flaky crust and sweet center - the cooking times were right on and the ingredients worked together just right. So tasty but not overly sweet, was a well balanced flavor between the sugar, cinnamon and pear. A great use for a few pears! Yummy!

Great dessert -- simple & easy, great flavor and beautiful presenation. I used my favorite cream cheese pie crust recipe from this site -- otherwise no changes. Definitely a keeper.

This turned out great! I used some local pears that weren't as large or as firm as Bose pears but that wasn't a problem. I also used a different pastry dough recipe, my go-to favorite from America's Test Kitchen. I will definitely make this again.

Epicurious says that a four-fork rating means, "excellent." That's just one word that aptly describes this tart. Made with the pastry dough recipe that accompanies the tart's recipe gives a combination of buttery flakiness that compliments the pear's texture and wholesome taste. The caramelized sugar adds a sweet crunch to both. If I seem to be a bit over the top here, it's because this simple tart merits praise. Cooking notes: Bosc is the perfect pear for this tart; be sure they are firm and not overly ripe (they soften in cooking and baking). Adding up to a tsp. of vanilla to the caramelized sugar as it begins to cook will give a flavor note that some might want (although it's not necessary). Regarding the pastry dough, be sure to not chill it too longeven just 30 minutes would be enough. Nor does it have to be trimmed; stuffing the extra ragged edges around the pears will just add to the tart's comeliness. Needless to say, this is a keeper.

Really easy & tasty. Added a little lime juice to the butter and sugar caramel layer which was an interesting added bonus.

Absolutely delicious! I followed this recipe almost exactly (added double or triple the amount of cinnamon; we love cinnamon in this household!) I also made the pastry dough that accompanied this recipe (made a perfect tart crust!). I have to perfect placing & tucking the dough over the pears. The most trouble I had was flipping the pan. I had my dad do that for me! He said as soon as he put the first bite in his mouth he knew that the flavor was "just right." Just the right amount of sweetness for the non-sweet tooth and sweet tooth in your family!!!

Delicious, easy and looks like a million bucks. Just be careful not to burn the sugar when caramelizing on the stovetop! I burned my first batch in 7 minutes and had to toss it and start fresh.

Oh my goodness! How deliciously simple. Absolutely loved it. The pastry was nice and flaky, and the pears came out soft and sweet. I thought it might need some sort of pastry cream, or ice-cream to serve it with--but boy was I wrong! This tart stands well all by itself. I might have overcooked the caramel, as parts of it were a bit chewy. I thought about baking it on a glass dish, but was glad I stuck to the original recipe, and used my cast iron skillet. The tart came out beautifully caramelized. Granted, I had to recruit my husband to flip it over for me... way too heavy!

Made this last night and like the other reviewers said, it was fabulous! Dinner guests, including 2 great cooks and my 19 year old son, raved. Used a sheet of puff pastry as the crust; unrefined sugar + molasses. Next time will try pomegranate molasses adaptation of sauce with pomegranate seeds and toasted almond slices drizzled on top before serving. One thing: sauce is liquid after cooking, so be careful when plating.

Rating: 4
I have made this dessert twice now, and the second time around, think I actually did the carmelizing much better. Turned the heat to medium low--took about 25 minutes to carmelize to my liking, but I was much happier with the end product this way. This is such a simple, tasty dessert. Definitely a keeper!

Put the pears cut side UP in the pan. You want the rounded, uncut side to be the top of the tart. Remember, you are going to cover the pears with the pastry, bake it and the flip the tart. You will not see the cut side; it is covered by the dough. The flipping can be an adventure at times. I found that using a plate ever so slightly larger than the pan works best. It is actually a little harder to flip if the plate is too large.

Rating: 4
So easy, so good. Great for my daughters who are just starting to cook. I might even try with apples.

Rating: 4
I make this again and again and I love it. It's so easy and delicious, with a gorgeous presentation. To the cook from LA on 11/7, yes - cut sides up. When arranged in the pan, the cut sides will form the flat base of the tart when you flip it. You're not caramelizing the pears so much as cooking them in caramel... the pears will cook through between part 1 on the stove and part 2 in the oven.

Do not double, just make two. I've got one in the oven right now. This is my most requested dessert of all time. I purchase puff pastry, use an iron skillet, toss in some ground ginger and cook it in the oven at 400 and keep a close eye on it.

HELP: Does this really mean arrange pears cut side DOWN? It says cut side up. That doesn't expose the most surface area to the carmelizing.

Rating: 2
This was good, but I felt like there was something missing tying it all together. The crust was too thick for the pears. Maybe next time I'll stretch the crust out to be thinner. The pears and the crust both tasted great, but, like I said, it was missing something holding it together.

Rating: 4
Delicious and easy, what more could you want? I used frozen pastry. Like other reviewers, next time I probably shorter the cook time on the pears for a little less caramelization.

Rating: 4
used asian pears instead of bosc as we have a bumper crop this year.Result was not a pretty as with bosc but very tasty. Took other reviewers suggestions about transferring to a different baking dish (have flipped searingly hot cast iron upside down cakes in past, not anxious to repeat experience. Result using a square glass casserole dish was just fine. Tart was a dessert hit and I will make it again.

Thought this was very simple. Used a prepared crust and some leftover pears and got a lovely, delicious result. I do think you have to be careful of how long you cook stovetop because the carmelization continues in the oven, so no deep caramel color for me..just 12-15 minutes on the stove max. Also, used my all clad too and it turned out perfect - Yum!

This is basically tarte Tatin with pears instead of the apples. Use the sour cream pastry dough from the tarte tatin recipe (1995) instead: Sour Cream Pastry 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour 2 tablespoons sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) chilled unsalted butter, cut into 3/4-inch pieces 6 tablespoons chilled sour cream Blend flour, sugar and salt in large bowl of heavy-duty mixer fitted with whisk attachment. Add butter and beat at medium-low speed until butter is size of small lima beans, about 3 minutes. Ad d sour cream and beat until moist clumps form, about 1 minute. Gather dough into smooth ball; flatten into 6-inch-diameter disk. Wrap dough in plastic; refrigerate until cold, at least 2 hours. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep refrigerated. Let soften slightly before rolling out.)

Wow!! What a great recipe. My dentist gave me an abundance of pears from the tree behind his office. I made this recipe as a thank you. When I took it in, all the office help and the dentist went wild and had to have the recipe. None of the people in the office could believe how simple this was to make. My family loved it ,too. It is now a favorite request. I used a an all clad pan to make it in since I have a flat top stove and a cast iron is not suppose to be use on it.

Rating: 4
This was delicious and made a lovely presentation. I followed the recipe exactly with a couple of exceptions... did not have a iron skillet so used my all clad pan for caramelizing and moved the sauce and pears to a ceramic dish prior to baking. Made the sauce the day before left the pears and sauce at room temp overnight. As the pears cooled the juice combined with the sauce and the pears were swimming in this lucious combination. The next morning added pie crust (store purchased) and baked while brunch was being consumed. Served the pears for dessert with a small scoop of cinnamon ice cream and mint for garnish. Everyone raved. So easy, yet rustic looking and elegant at the same time...definitely at keeper.

Rating: 3
This was the easiest thing I've ever made! When I made the crust I had already left the butter out to soften, so I mixed it in by hand (just a little) and put it in the freezer while the pears cooked on the stove. It turned out perfect! I also used bartlett pears instead of bosc and it was still really good. Will definately make again, probably from memory because it was so easy!

Rating: 3
This recipe started out wonderfully-- it was awesome to watch the arranged pears cook in the skillet as the sugar bubbled and browned all around them. I ran into one huge problem though, in the baking portion. I baked for 20 minutes in a cast iron skillet, but it caramelized the sugar to the point of turning it into a candy-like dish! It wouldn't slide out, and when we finally were able to pop it out, the tart was destroyed! We picked at the remants anyways, and the flavor was still great, although the consistency could pull out your fillings. Maybe next time I will bake at a lower temperature... the heat just seemed to destroy what would have been a really impressive, and easy, dessert.

I made this with most of a giant Cascade pear (2 pounds EACH), sliced thick. I also used a prepared pie crust. It came out very well, though if you're going to have your boyfriend assist with the turning it onto a plate, make sure he knows to not hold the skillet over the plate and shake! As a result, it wasn't very pretty, but it was very tasty. Will try it again at some point with normal pears and a better technique.

Delicious! I was in a vacation cabin with no cast iron pan, so we did the carmelizing in a regular skillet, quickly transferred it into a glass baking pan, put on crust and baked. Also we used bosc pears and some other unknown variety I have. It was a hit, served it with vanilla ice cream.

If you make several cuts in the pears from the base towards the stem, but do NOT go all the way (leave about an inch), the pears will fan out nicely while cooking.

I don't know why I find it confusing - but in this recipe as well as the original - it doesn't say to slice the pears?!!! So is everyone putting 6 (if using 3 pears) whole halved pears in the pan --- or are the pears being sliced?

I made this with a few modifications. I recommend it, with my modifications and a recommendation not to cook it for the full time indicated. First, I added fresh ginger and vanilla to the pear/sugar/butter mixture and liked that addition. But, after carmalizing the mixture baked it for the 30 minutes recommended. The tart came out with the pears tinged with black. Still tasted OK, as it wasn't burned throughout, but would have been better if cooked only 20 minutes.

I tried my hand at making this with less-than perfect results. It is times like this that I wish I had better cooking equipment. If you haven't got what they say to use in the recipe, I wouldn't recommend making this. My chief difficulty was that the carmel didn't carmelize. Still tasted nice though! I bet it would have been fantastic with a bit more to hold it up.

I have made this recipe with apples..it is called Tarte Tatin. I use Granny Smith apples (about 8 med. sized ones) and placed the peeled, cored and thickly sliced apples on end in concentric circles in the skillet. You do not need to add cinnamon. I use one full stick of butter and 1 1/4 cups sugar. It's a winner every time!

I have been making this recipe for a couple of years after seeing it in the magazine. It is truly elegant and delicious. I don't have a cast iron pan so I use a stainless steel pan that is safe to go into the oven. I was a bit nervous about inverting it the first time but with one quick motion, it came out onto the plate beautifully. A delicious definite keeper.

I saw this recipe in Gourmet's magazine in 1997 and have been making this recipe ever since. Everyone loves it! Simple and elegant. I have used both a regular skillet and a non-stick (don't own a cast iron) and it always comes out great.

Rating: 3
Although a non-stick skillet (oven-proof without handles) would work fine, I have heard warnings about using them (especially the cheaper ones) in the oven at high temperatures. I think because the non-stick coating might come off or leach into foods and it is potentially dangerous. I'm usually not paranoid about such things, but why risk it when cast iron works great--You just have to remove it from the heat sooner because cast iron retains heat so well that the caramel will continue to cook after being removed from the heat. Invest in a Le Creuset Tart Tatin pan--it's cast iron with a non-stick porcelain coating and works great! Also, it can be used for a multitude of things.
