Made this for Mother's Day dinner - Mom (& Dad) loved it! Had to make two subs: didn't have Dijon so I used about 2 Tbs. yellow mustard, used half honey/half brown sugar and it was still delish. (Next time I'll use the Dijon.) It's a winner of a dish. Served this with green salad and "Roasted Asparagus and Potatoes," from Gourmet, May 1996. Yummy! (My Mom's making it for my sister and her husband as we speak!)

The flavor was nice, a little too sweet (I might reduce the honey next time) but it didn't look all that appetizing. A little browning of the glaze around the edges but otherwise blanched and pale in appearance.

I was so excited to try this recipe, but in my opinion, the flavors are just too cloying and overpowering for high-quality salmon. I much prefer simple Roasted Salmon recipe also on this site. If you don't like the taste of salmon, however, this will certainly disguise it for you!

The dish was good& It wasnt the best thing Ive ever tasted, but it was good. I think the glaze was a little too creamy and not glaze-y enough for my taste. I liked the edges where the glaze had started to caramelize& The next time I make it I think Ill put it under the broiler for a few minutes to help caramelize the glaze. The flavors were good overall and I would make it again.

Almost perfect. A tad too sweet, and my salmon needed 4 more minutes of cooking time, but overall, this was delicious AND easy. Served cheese (boursin) grits and salad.

I usually marinade our salmon with a wonderful glaze made with maple syrup, garlic, soya sauce, chicken broth and ginger, a truly fabulous recipe. Wanted to try something new. This was GREAT! Used old-fashioned Dijon with seeds, making the salmon even more visually attractive. very nice!

I thought it was OK, but it prompted my wife to divorce me, which I thought was an extreme reaction but she said the dinner proved our differences were irreconcilable. So make this one at your own risk.

Easy recipe and great for a weeknight dinner. It pairs well with grilled asparagus and spinach salads - when it's okay to have raw spinach. My husband likes the sweetness the glaze adds to the salmon and I like that I can sneak in an extra night of fish during the week!

YUUUUMY. I wish I could rate it 3 1/2 forks. I seared the entire side filet in olive oil for a minute over very high heat and removed the skin so the marinade would pentrate both sides and served it over a bed of romaine hearts, and blanched red onion, carrot, red belle pepper, and celery, with white sticky rice infused with minced lemon rind and garlic. Fabulous flavor, fabulous showpiece. I'd make this for company any day.

We loved this recipe, I cooked it loosely wrapped in tin foil to add to it's moistness for that reason I would remove the skin- It was light, quick and very tasty meal served with the Jasmin rice with green onions, peas and lemon

To the cook from Boston -- I use EVOO, too, but I use much less of it and use much more mustard. I find that the dish is wonderfully flavorful and not at all oily this way. I make it almost every week! :)

Rating: 1
Ick. epicurious has rarely let me down, and I hate to disagree with all the rave reviews, but I thought this dish was NOT good at all. Granted, I think this was my fault b/c I used a full-bodied extra virgin olive oil, which is all I had. The fish ended up tasting like weird, heavy olive oil - I couldn't even detect the honey or the mustard, and it was a chore to finish my piece. Since this got such positive reviews and to be fair, however, I'll try it again with canola oil since I'll never use regular olive oil for anything else.

My husband said this was the best Salmon he'd ever had! He's quite picky and not a lover of fish.

It will be in our routine of meals from now on!

An avid salmon lover, I halved the recipe for 3 salmon steaks, which turned out to work beautifully. This is by far one of the easiest dishes with the best result. While it's not my favorite, it happens to be my fianceé's most loved salmon recipe. The flavors balance really well, and it works great with asparagus and wild rice.

I'm always looking for new ways to prepare my favorite fish - of which salmon certainly is one. The recipe was simple and other than waiting for the marinate took no time to make (even though I tend to be slow in the kitchen). The fish came out moist and cooked through nicely, and the glaze was delicious. Not the best salmon recipe ever, but darn good. I'll add this recipe to my box.

Salmon is a high-fat fish so the olive oil just made this just too greasy. I found a similar recipe except instead of the oil, it had balsamic vinegar in equal parts to the honey and mustard. This variation is excellent.

Beautiful colors -- pink salmon with yellow glaze and bright green specks of dill. The salmon was moist as well. Too much sauce, though, and too sweet. I do understand the other reviewer's comment about Chinese take-out food sauce. I wonder if I can leave out the oil without impacting the moistness?

Entirely too bland. Might have been better broiled than bake. Definitely lacked pizzazz.

Ugh. Every now & then you just get a lemon. Normally have wonderful success with Bon Appetit recipies, but this, unfortunately, was not one of those times. I found the glaze to be completely counter to the taste of the fish. The overall flavor was a study in contrasts, and not in the GOOD way. My spouse took two bites and wouldn't eat any more.

Very easy and a nice change. Would make it for company. We grilled the salmon which was great. The recipe makes a lot of marinade. Next time, I will use less glaze during cooking as the glaze can be overpowering if you use too much.

I've been making this dish for family and company for quite awhile now. The only thing I've changed is that I broil it (or grill) it for about 6 minutes per side. Broiling leaves the salmon with a wonderful dark, carmelized finish that really finishes the dish!

Not wishing to be mean to the one who cooked it at 400C, but I should think 8 minutes would have been more than enough.

Quite enjoyable. My six year old loves Salmon so I tested it on her. She liked it but exclaimed her partiality to a similar recipe that included Soy sauce. (And before you chortle at such a seemingly infantile test, her favourite food is veal scalopine with capers) One caution: watch the fish carefully. My fillets were approximately 1 - 1/1/2" thick and cooked in eight minutes at 400C.

Very, very good. Salmon was moist, tender and very flavourful. I marinated 2 hours before baking, then brought marinade to a boil and cooked for 2 minutes, then brushed on salmon as it was baking. Quick, easy and a good company dish.

YUM! I was looking for an alternative marinade for salmon -- I have another that is fail proof, but wanted something different -- it's really great. My husband liked it better than the "usual" marinade that I use. It's easy to make, especially when you need something fast for weeknights. I did alter the recipe slightly; although I used all the ingredients, I did not use as much olive oil as it calls for -- I just kind of used my intuition. (1/2 cup seemed like a lot to me.) But, I'll make it again! It's terrific!

My family loved this recipe. I used 1/2 as much honey as the recipe called for, and used more mustard. I also topped the filets with finely chopped walnuts(instead of the usual breadcrumbs) a low-carbohydrate substitution. Very very good!

Rating: 3
This was good but we improvised- since we didn't have dijon mustard or dill, we used a combination of horseradish mustard and dill mustard. The honey did make the dish quite sweet but that's okay. The big problem came after dinner when we had to tackle a charred baking sheet from where the sauce spilled off the fish and onto the pan.

I don't give many dishes a four fork rating, but this dish deserves it. I was glad that others had made this dish with a single, large fillet - that's what I used.

The moistest, juiciest salmon I've ever eaten. My husband just raved. I changed the recipe just a touch. 1st, I seared on one side in a hot frying panin a small amount of canola oil,after seasoning with salt & pepper. For the glaze I used honey mustard instead of dijon and after searing spread the glaze on the salmon and placed in 400 degree oven for 10 more minutes or just until the glaze bubbles. I recommend it highly.

My husband and son loved this dish and went back for second helpings. However, I was not as impressed and would make a few modifications to get a better looking (and tasting) result.Baking the dish did not color the sauce well before the fish was done cooking. Therefore, I would finish it under the broiler to really give it a nice caramelized glaze and heightened flavor.

I was quite disappointed with this dish as it got such glowing reviews. We thought it quite inferior to the other fish recipes we have been trying from this web site.
