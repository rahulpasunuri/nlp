Made this for Thanksgiving. Made as directed(added whole ginger and took it out before serving). I did hold back on some of the sugar and chopped the cherries in half. I didn't care for the result. Too sweet and not tart enough. Had lots left over so my guests didn't care for it either.

I don't think I've ever met a (non-canned) cranberry sauce I didn't like, but I like this one a lot. The tartness of it was perfect for me. As others have noted, the recipe doesn't specify whether the ginger should be chopped/grated or just simmered with the sauce and then removed. I chopped it finely and it's noticeable but not overpowering. I didn't cut the cherries at all, and they *are* bigger than the cranberries, but that's OK by me. I did mash the whole thing up a bit with a wooden spoon while it was simmering, which broke up some of the cherries a little.

So yummy and smooth . I didn't have any amaretto so I used whiskey and then a 1/4 cup of red wine.

I didn't chop or grate the ginger, and I think that may be needed if you want to taste that flavor more strongly. It's barely detectable as is, I'd like to hear whether those who did chop the ginger think it is too strong. The cinnamon adds a nice flavor, and as I did not have amaretto I used a teaspoon of almond extract which gives just enough flavor to notice. I like tart dishes but agree that this needed more sugar.

I agree that the recipe was unclear on several matters. I finely chopped the ginger also, since there were no instructions to remove it at any point. I also halved the cherries so they were similar in size to the cranberries. I found it needed more sugar, and I also added 2 t. unflavored gelatin to bind it. We'll see what the family thinks at the Thanksgiving dinner!

I, too, grated the ginger, which I think is what the recipe writer intended (I can't see sauteing one lump of ginger with a bunch of cinnamon powder). I used the the ingredients as specified, but halved the cherries -- thought they'd be too big and sparse in the sauce otherwise. Also, I stopped simmering after 15 minutes so the pectins wouldn't break down. The result was good, though a bit tart; I'll try adding a little more sugar next time I make it (tonight).

Should sweet or sour cherries be used? At first glance, it seems that sour cherries are called for. This sounds like such an interesting recipe which needs some fine-tuning.

I didn't use the whole bag of cherries, and I fine grated the ginger. Made it last night and will taste again today. Thought a small bit of fresh lemon juice might be good, too.

Ediethat, the way I read the recipe, I wouldn't chop the ginger. Rather, just cook the peeled piece of ginger and then take it out before serving. However, I wonder what it would be like to reduce the amount of sugar and instead add chopped candied ginger which you could add and then just keep in the sauce. Might add some nice zing?

Interested in making this but need clarification re ginger. Should I chop it and leave it in to serve or cook it with the one inch piece left whole and then remove the ginger piece before serving?

I normally don't care for variations of simple cranberry sauce, but this one looked interesting. I followed this recipe exactly as written, but I thought the cherries overpowered the cranberries. It smelled amazing as it was simmering but then it was like eating cherry pie filling.
