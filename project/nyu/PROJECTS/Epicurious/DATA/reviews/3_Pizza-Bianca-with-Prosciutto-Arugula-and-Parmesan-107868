This was so good, easy and a lighter alternative to gooey pizza. I used garlic infused oil on the crust before i baked it. Delicious! Made it for a girls night and they all loved it.

Maybe it was the pizza dough I used, but I didn't find this compelling enough to want to make it again. Definitely so-so.

This pizza is so delicious and so easy to make. It is also terrific cold as a leftover when you have any. This has become a regular at our home, especially as a last minute dish. Make sure to only use Prosciutto di Parma (Italian), because domestic prosciutto is nowhere near as good, and much saltier.
