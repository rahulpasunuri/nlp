Our CSA sent rhubarb this week, so we looked for a recipe that was simple and versatile and would keep a few days in the frig. This is it. We're having it for breakfast: (1) warmed and served over steel-cut oatmeal, and (2) chilled, mixed with Greek yogurt, and topped with granola.

This became an instant favorite in my household once we joined a community garden with prolific rhubarb plants. I use half sugar, half Splenda to cut the calories a bit, and then I can use it on everything from fish and chicken to vanilla ice cream!

Like the cook from Portland, OR, I added garlic but unlike the cook, I didn't replace the ginger for it. I cooked it longer than the recipe called for because I wanted a softer consistency to the rhubarb. Some of the rhubarb fell apart but omg, it is delicious. Don't know what I'm going to use this compote with, but may find myself just taking spoonfuls by itself.

I've made this many times to use up the rhubarb from my garden. I cook the rhubarb longer though, preferring an almost marmalade consistency. The vegetarians in the house like it over polenta. It would also be good over a brick of cream cheese as an appetizer.

I give this two forks because I didn't like the flavor of this, but my husband did. I didn't like it even though I used very good aged balsamic vinegar not the cheap stuff.

Fantastic with a simple change: replacing the gingerroot with garlic. Chilled for a day or two, then served with baguette crisps and goat cheese. Delicious!

I just made this last night to use up some leftover rhubarb, and I loved it! I just had a taste of it. I don't eat pork, ham, or beef...has anyone used it on other meats that turned out well? Sometimes I eat chicken, but mostly fish and tofu.

Super easy and great flavor. Definitely a keeper.

All previous reviews are correct: this is a delicious way to use rhubarb, and very popular in my house with baked ham. Also: it's a preserve with vinegar, so it keeps virtually forever in the fridge.

Incredibly easy and complements grilled beef or pork tenderloin very well.

This is a wonderful side dish to any pork roast. I have made it every Easter since I discovered this compote
