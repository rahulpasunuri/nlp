I finally tried this recipe. I thought the mixture was so thick that I added 2 tbs. of soda water (I use this in my other matza ball recipe) and they were very light and fluffy. Bud I didn't get the melding of flavors I anticipated. I might try it again and add a drop of almond extract and maybe more cinnamon. They were NOT crunchy because you finely chop the almonds in a cuisinart. And surprisingly, they were light and fluffy, but I attribute that to the soda water. Not my favorite recipe!

i have never had regular matzo ball soup, so i don't know how this variation compares. it was a wonderful mix of flavors. i served this when it was my turn to cook in my supper club. we like to have themes, preferably of cusines that we would not normally try. although none of us are jewish, we enjoyed feasting on matzo ball soup, brisket, and latkes! i may not be chomping at the bit to make this soup again, i did enjoy learning to make it, and eating it!

I have never really made matzo ball soup before so unlike the other reviewers I have nothing to really compare this to. I made the recipe exactly as directed (with cinnamon and almonds) and it was good. Maybe not traditional (I don't really know) but good.

Is this going to have CRUNCHY matzoh balls??? Maybe I would try almond meal but CRUNCHY? Is this kosher?

call me a converted traditionalist! Ex-NYC now Raleigh NC doesn't know what he/she's missing! Chopped almonds add a wonderful flavour and texture - though I agree with "hold the cinnamon". As far as the chicken fat - I'll forego the clogged arteries, thank you - and with a good home-made chicken stock, only you will know that these are fat-free.

I can't rate or review this recipe because I wouldn't make it. I am a traditionalist and have been making matzo balls with chicken fat, which I know is a no-no for a lot of people, but can't begin to imagine them with almonds and cinnamon.
