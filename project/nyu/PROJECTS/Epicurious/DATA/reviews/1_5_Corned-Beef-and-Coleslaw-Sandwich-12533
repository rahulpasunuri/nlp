The Kornblau's Special was actually a #31 on the menu. The secret there was to use coleslaw that was made "clear' so the taste of the corned beef was not compromised by the cole slaw. Kornblau's also served a side of cole slaw that was "creamy" but used the clear variety on all sandwiches.

Corn Beef and Coleslaw on Rye with Russian dressing was a deli staple back in Jersey. (they called it a "number one") Don't go to all the trouble of making it this way. Just buy some good rye, thin sliced corn beef and a tub of decent coleslaw. Slather some bottled Russian dressing on the top slice of bread and your good to go. Forget the mustard!

This is reminisint of a sandwich made by a restaurant named Kornblau's in Atlantic City, New Jersey during its heyday as a beach resort town in the 50's & 60's..That sandwich was magificent made on jewish rye, and the slaw made with russian dressing.....Try the variation if you love deli sandwiches......

I guess I like my corned beef on rye with mustard and my cole slaw on the side or not at all.
