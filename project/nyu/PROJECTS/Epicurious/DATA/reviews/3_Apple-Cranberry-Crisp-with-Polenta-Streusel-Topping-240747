Am I the only one that thought the topping was too gritty? The filling was great even though I left out the anise (none in house). Might have to go back to the classic Crisp topping but with this filling.

I nice change from usual toppings. The polenta gives it an unusual texture. The anise seed really makes it work. Next time I'd use a bit more apples... Be warned in the 11 x 7 pan it does bubble over... put some foil on a rack below otherwise the oven smokes terribly! I learned the hard way.

tasty and pretty easy. i didn't have a food processor and did the crumble with a hand mixer without a problem. i was also too lazy to buy pastry flour and all purpose did the trick. the anise flavor was nice, i think the volume on it could even be pumped a bit.

I love the crisp on this recipe. I might use this all the time. And of course I couldn't find cranberries when I want them, so I bought a can of cranberry sauce and cut the sugars in half. Very unique dessert and that crisp is great. I agree, don't leave out the anise.

Delicious! Don't omit the anise, adds a lovely subtle flavor. I could not fit this in an 11x7 pan, 13x9 was just right. Nice rustic wintertime dessert.

I really liked the spice and tartness of this recipe. I did not use Granny Smith's though. I used a local organic apple-Sierra. It was perfect.
