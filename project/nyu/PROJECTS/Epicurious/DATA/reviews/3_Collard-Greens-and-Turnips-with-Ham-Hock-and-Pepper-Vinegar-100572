So GOOD! I'm not a cook, per se, but I'm trying. These were so easy and delicious...I scaled it down a bit - I bought 2 lbs of pre-cut, pre-washed greens mix (collard, turnip, mustard) and added it to 4 cups water w/ ham hock after an hour. It was perfect and so incredibly easy.

I've cooked collards many many times over the years using this very recipe, although I find salt pork to be a better seasoning than hocks. I cut the pork into cubes and remove the thick skin and saute it in a bit of olive oil before adding the water to boil. Also, if you cook these in a pressure cooker, there is no need to remove the stems and you cut the cooking time down to about 15 minutes total.

I used three one-pound bags of frozen, chopped collards. It made the prep ridiculously easy and I doubt you can tell the difference after cooking them that long. My guests loved them and so did my 2-year-old daughter! This was a great accompaniment to Hoppin' John. I also served two varieties of cornbread for sopping up the juice. Delicious.

Great recipe! The only thing I might change next time is to cook the ham hock first, cool the broth and then skim the fat. After that I will cook the collards. I'm sure it will be just as good but without all the fat.

I'm not sure it's this recipe I'm reviewing anymore. I met a woman at the supermarket who told me her way of making them and I made the substitutions. I cooked the collard greens with a smoked turkey leg instead of ham hock, added sugar to the water and seasoned with Mrs. Dash, salt, pepper and a splash of seasoned rice vinegar toward the end. Then sauteed some bacon and poured the drippings over the drained greens, crumbled the bacon over the top....delicious! My mentor was African American and she said her family mixes turnip greens and mustard greens cooked the same way. But they never mix collards...'cause they stand well on their own. All can be cooked ahead. Caution: not too much water or the greens will be mushy. My family is Italian and we are used to tart greens so I had a feeling this would be a hit...and it was!

Excellent. I skipped the turnips (didn't have them) and used 3 bunches of collards. I used Tabasco instead of the pepper vinegar. A delicious dish with the jalepeno cheddar bread I had.

Nutritious and tasty. Served it with skillet corn bread and BBQ pork - absolutely heavenly combination. Added mustard greens with the collard greens which gave it an interesting texture.

I added equal parts turnip greens and mustard greens to the recipe and it was so good that I put some on top my head and my tongue tried to beat my brains out getting to it.
