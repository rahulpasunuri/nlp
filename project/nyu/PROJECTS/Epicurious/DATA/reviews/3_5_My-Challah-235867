I have been making this challah for the past several years. It has received rave reviews from all who have eaten it. I did make an adjustment by changing the recipe to include bread flour (1/3) of the total amount, or 158 grams and the remainder in all purpose flour. I like the texture and lightness better. I also use stronger honey than the mild honey called for in the recipe. It is a wonderful challah, rolled into a "turban" for Rosh Hashana, or any time you'd like something nice. I also use nigella seeds (black- Chernoshka) on the top.

I am not a cook at all, but this bread is so easy to make. I got it right on the very first try and it was delicious!

I made this recipe for the holiday. I haven't had much success with this author's recipes in the past, but I decided to go ahead and try it anyway. The dough was fairly simple to make but the recipe calls for far less yeast than most other challah recipes I've seen and the dough just didn't seem rise. I put the dough bottom oven with the top oven on to make it a little warm for both rises and let it sit for over 3 hours for each rise. Finally, i baked it and it turned out as hard as a rock. I would not make this recipe again. I then made a different recipe for the challah for the second night with twice as much yeast and it turned out beautifully.

After trying different recipes and failing miserably, I finally tried this one and at least this challah was edible. I followed the advice of other posters and doubled the amount of yeast. I also made sure to keep the kitchen very warm while the dough was rising as was advised by other posters. On the first rise the dough increased wonderfully but after braiding it the dough had a hard time rising again even though I kept the kitchen very warm. Additionally, I prefer my challah much sweeter. I made it with just the honey but I think it could have used some additional sugar. It also wasnt as moist as I like my challah, but that could have been my inexperience. The recipe works but Ill have to tweak it in the future and figure out the moisture problem as well.

I had fun making this bread. I looked for an easy recipe to try for my first ever Challah bread (yeap! I've seen it in magazines and newpapers but never tried it or dear to make it. Everything worked really great and I got a great looking and tasting horse shoe shaped Challah. Just on time to wish all my jewish friends a great Rosh Ashannah!!

I love this recipe&but its tricky. Half the time when I would make it the dough wouldnt rise and when it did rise it was because I was periodically turning the oven on and off in little bursts to keep it warm (which is a very time consuming). So this time when I made it I decided to double the yeast (I used two packets instead of one) and it did rise perfectly (no messing with heat &although I did put it in a very slightly warm oven to start off). I also had to add a little more water to the yeast/flour mix at the beginning. The other thing I changed was the sugar (I used ½ cup).

I was hoping for a slightly stronger honey flavor with this, but it was still great. It does take a long time to rise (I did about 2 1/2 hours for both rises, maybe a little less on the second). It helped me when I placed the covered bowl on top of a turned on oven (about 250 degrees, or enough so that the top of the oven feels pretty warm). My dough seemed very dry while I was braiding it and was thus difficult to work with, but it came out moist and beautiful. Good if laborious recipe.

I've been making this for a couple of years and I like it but I've had mixed results--sometimes too heavy, sometimes too brown. Last week for Rosh Hashona I lost my temper and put the bowl, for first rise, on a heating pad (like the kind you use for aches) and that thing rose and rose. I actually left it for three hours sitting on that pad and then rushed home and stuck it in the refrigerator without shaping it. The next day I shaped it into a huge braided wheel and again ended up letting it rise at least another three hours before baking it. This time it came out perfectly. I think the thing to remember is that you practically can't let this thing overrise and it really needs warmth to get going. AIMAI

I tried this with a couple of substitutions: butter for veggie oil, and maple syrup for honey (which I figure makes it Canadian challah). It came out tasty, but noticeably dry--next time, I'm going to try using a little more water and kneading it more. I didn't have the rising problems other people seemed to have, but I had it in the oven on a warm day. It made delicious French toast the next morning.

This worked very well - I let it rise longer than the recipe said, but otherwise, everything was as the recipe instructed. My family loved it. The dough was also very easy to braid.

I followed earlier comments and let it rise in a turned off oven with a pan of boiling water in the bottom for 2 hrs. 15 min. I was shocked to see, after that time, it had barely risen. I decided to make it anyway, so I went for 2 hours for the second rise then baked it for 40 min. Guess what? It came out REALLY GOOD. Total surprise. I thought it was a wash. Another tip: Start around noon or 1pm to have the loaf ready for dinner time.

I tried this twice, following the recipe exactly, and and both times I was very disappointed. The loaves were very flat and dense and not at all soft like traditional challah.

Rating: 2
The flavor is very good but I had trouble with the rising as well. 3 hours for the fermenting + 3 hours for the loaves to rise (I made 2 braided ones) then baked. If you think they might rise a little more during baking, think again. The result was an extremely dense challah that tasted good but left me wondering how to lighten it up.

This is an excellent challah recipe. I love the honey flavor. I found it didn't rise correctly, though, until I put it in a turned-off oven for both rises. Then it was perfect.

I have made this recipe twice and both times the fermenting and proofing took MUCH MUCH longer (over three hours for each, in a warm oven with a dish of boiling water). The end result was fantastic and well worth the wait. I live in a community where there are at least 30 bakeries baking Challah within a mile and half and this bread was remarkably better than the best Challah we have ever bought. I used an AP organic flour and so I needed to double the water content (1/2 cup instead of a 1/4 cup). Also, I have the Kitchenaid Pro stand-mixer and it stood up very well to kneeding this dough.

Slow to rise, but well worth it!!

This challah is very easy but I recommend that you read it carefully. I didn't realize that it called for fast acting yeast, yet not mixed directly into the flour! Once I corrected that and I also used bread flour, it is light, delicious and with the egg wash recommended below a gorgeous color. It's also a very easy bread to make.

I was disappointed. I've made other more typical (more water/less egg) challah recipes that worked much better. The batter wasn't just stiff but dry. The first rise was ok but the second wasn't just slow but not high, though it got to the soft stage. I used quick yeast and had it rise inside an oven with a pan of warm water. First rise 105 min. second rise 75 min.

This recipe is very similar to one I used to make commercially, so I love that it's designed to be kneaded by hand (challah can be very tough on my mixer!). Very simple to make and very tasty results. Let it ferment in your oven (turned off!) with a pan of boiling water; it will rise much faster. Also, egg wash before AND after the final fermentation for a richer flavor and darker color.

This turned out wonderfully,and was a big hit with guests on Rosh Hashanah. I also found the rising time substantially longer - but be patient - it's definitely worth it!

I bake regularly, but don't make yeast breads often, and have never made challah. I made this for the start of Rosh Hashanah. I found the dough easy to work with--I had very large eggs so I actually had to add some flour. It is a *very* slow rising bread, even using the instant yeast, but it is well worth the wait. I found the first rise needed about 2 hours 15 minutes. Excellent!

This is an excellent challah recipe. I have made it multiple times and have always gotten raves. I agree that it is a slow rising dough. I have let it sit overnight in the fridge and that can help with timing the baking to suit your needs. The bread develops a dark brown crust and the texture is perfect. I cannot find any commercial challah in my area that is worth eating. I would recommend looking for Ms. Glezer's book. In i she gives a variation of this recipe using 5 lb of flour to make 6 loaves. I made 2 batches last week for my son's Bar Mitzvah and all were perfect. Try it, you won't be dissa pointed.

I was almost ready to throw the challah dough away at several points--it really does feel like molding clay and didn't rise as much as other recipes I've made. But I am glad that I didn't because the recipe actually did produce delicious bread. I made this for Shabbat for my boyfriend's family and they all loved it.

I can't say enough about how wonderful this recipe is. I've always had the choice of buying a challah on Friday (usually delicious) or making my own (made with LOVE but usually not very good). This recipe has changed all that. It's fine- crumbed, keeps for a few days (if it lasts that long!) without getting stale, doesn't spread too much during baking (all problems I've had with other challah recipes). I highly recommend this!

This is such a great recipe; it's easy, versatile, and delicious! I've made it three times this week! I use 1/4 ounce active dry yeast (start with the same slurry) and the sugar substitute. I braided it for Easter with dyed eggs, made it into French toast, and baked it as a regular loaf for sandwiches. It takes closer to 2 1/2 hours per rising and 35-45 minutes to bake at my house. It got rave reviews from my family and neighbors at Easter dinner...could not say one bad thing about it. I'm a professionally educated pastry chef and this is my new favorite challah recipe~
