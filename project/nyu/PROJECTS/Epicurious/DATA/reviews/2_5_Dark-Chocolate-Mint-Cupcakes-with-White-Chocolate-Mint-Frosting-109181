With an additional egg and some extra cocoa these cupcakes were delicious! I didn't have fresh mint, so I actually used dried mint re-hydrated with a little water. I would certainly make these again.

cupcakes are delicious, but they take a lot to make, these are not simple cupcakes, the frosting recipe didn't set up for me :(

I'm sorry there's no "zero forks" to give this recipe. It was so hideous that I took only one bite and spit it out. Tasted like toothpaste and was heavy as a brick. The instructions are defective, and it makes twice the amount expected. Time to yank this one, as it's not up to epicurious standards at all.

I am suprised no one mentioned the "frosting" for this recipe, which is really a ganache. I had no creme de menthe, so I used mint extract, and I was put off by the off-white color of the final product. Maybe I should have tinted it green. The cupcakes themselves taste good but are heavy, not fluffy like I expect cupcakes to be. The use of fresh mint in the batter is refreshing, and probably the only part of this recipe that I will use again.

After reading the reviews I still decided to try this one. Here is what I did to solve the issues: I halved the recipe using two eggs instead of 1.5. I added the flour when the other reviewers did, after the chocolate. To up the chocolate flavour I added two heaping tbls of cocoa at the end and some peppermint essential oil to intesify the mint flavour. They came out perfectly!!!!! Highly reccomend modified recipe.

I too had to figure out when to add the flour. But beyond that the taste was bland. The frosting looked minty green when I added the cream de menthe, not at all like the photo. Oh, and I made 24 mini cupcakes and 12 regular sized with the batter. Bottom line...not worth the effort.

We noticed the same mistake in the recipe and added the flour at the same point as the first reviewers and it worked fine. Also found that this recipe made MUCH MORE than 24 mini-cupcakes. We ended up with 24 mini's plus an 8-inch round layer. The cake recipe was interesting (ricotta, walnuts & fresh mint) but it didn't taste as interesting as it sounded - moist and soft but kind of blah - not quite chocolatey enough. To make up for this, we dipped the mini cupcakes in some dark chocolate mint ganache before swirling with the white chocolate mint frosting.

So, what do you do with the flour mixture? We're making these right now, and decided to mix it in after adding the chocolate/butter. Please fix the recipe!
