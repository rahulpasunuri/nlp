I made this recipe as written and was underwhelmed. I enjoy all the ingredients but together, this recipe was just a bit of a snooze. I won't be making it again.

Meh. It was alright. They weren't raved about at our party. I used less mayo, substituting yogurt (1/4 cup each). Still tasted too mayo-ish and the sun dried tomato flavor overwhelmed everything.

Delicious! The tomatoes make this special.

Oh my heck. Just made if for Oscar night (As Gouda As It Gets). Had no paprika so subbed chipotle powder, horseradish and cayenne. Did 1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream and made buttemilk out of cream and vinegar. Super duper yummy! I'm afraid my hubby and I may pick at it until it's all gone before Sunday's party which is still 4 days away!

i used only plain yogurt and found this to be absolutely delicious.

This recipe is extremely easy and tasty. BUT...the first batch came out a bit too oily, due to the tomatoes and mayo. So I substituted sour cream and cream cheese for mayo. Much better. Add a little smoked hot chile powder and lemon and it's even better!

Ick! This recipe sounded so good and the reviews are usually what lead me to try a new recipe. This just didn't come together well at all, the flavors were off and I followed the recipe without variation. I thought it might just be me but after asking 3 other adults to try this and receiving the same response from each (wow! that's not very good!) I'll be deleting this one from my recipe box.

This was easy and the flavors were great! Will definitely make again and again.

This is one of my favorite appetizers. The smoky flavor combined with the tang from the sun dried tomatoes and the crisp, fresh bite of the celery is a dynamite combination. I get rave reviews every time I make it. I also use the food processor for easier blending.

Thanks to all of the previous reviews, I adjusted the recipe to include more gouda, and used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo. Also, I use red pepper flakes for a subtle spice, and double the recipe for parties of 6 or more. This recipe is very easy to make- just 20 minutes!

I'm grateful to the previous reviewers -- the recipe is greatly improved when following their suggested revisions. Pureeing the ingredients is the way to go ... just mixing the ingredients together makes for a clumpy, unappetizing spread. I tried it on cucumber rounds at first, but it tasted far better on garlic toasts. Also used half sour cream, half mayo; added roasted garlic; and sprinkled in some cayenne pepper. It keeps incredibly well ... I had some left over, and it still tastes great after six days in the refrigerator.

This is wonderful! I used sour cream and added horseradish for zip as others had suggested. For a nice presentation I topped them with thinly sliced green onion circles and strips of the sun-dried tomatoes. Very Yummy!!

This is the one recipe that I consistently make for parties. I get reave reviews and everyone always asks for the recipe. I do agree that it's better with crackers. Next time I may experiment with cayenne pepper or sour cream as others have recommended, but I really think the recipe is GREAT as is.

I thought the buttermilk made it taste too sour and bitter. I tried to add more gouda to balance out the taste but then the texture became too thick and clumpy.

Great recipe. I served it as an appetizer for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it. I added about 1 T of good horseradish to give it a bit more zip. Served it stuffed inside celery as suggested though would also be good with crackers.

This is a great appetizer - must admit I add more gouda and sundried tomatoes to it. I also serve it in a bowl with crackers and veggies rather than taking the time to stuff the celery. It's just easier.

Very good appetizer. I made it the day before and it wasn't runny AT ALL, it was nice and thick. Use a good smoked gouda. Could probably cut the mayo down a bit. I served in the celery and also had crackers on the side. It was all gone in a flash!

I've made this a couple of times and my guests have always liked it. I found it a bit bland at first, so I doubled the amount of sundried tomatoes and added some fresh basil and lots of pepper for extra flavor. It's kind of a messy presentation but that didn't stop us from finishing it off.

Definite keeper!! The flavors of the smoked gouda with the celery were great and as an appetizer it was not too heavy!

I don't know what the the last cook did that was wrong (for her great disapproval)but I made this tonight as a quick appetizer for a small dinner party and it was a smashing success! They analyzed what they thought the ingredients were and truly loved it! It was so easy and it made me the top chef with this group!

This was a sorry looking appetizer. I followed the recipe to the "T" and it was just wrong. No one really cared for it at a July 4th BBQ.(And everyone usually loves smoked gouda.) It was a waste of fine ingredients and time. The filling was so-so, but it didn't present well, nor keep that great. I should have taken out the mayo as other reviewers suggested and served it on crackers rather than with the celery. Oh well...

I was hesitant to make this for a family gathering with such a variety of tastes, but EVERYONE enjoyed it. I did not think that the celery washed out the flavor, I thought it was a perfect addition. I am making it again this weekend for a 4th of July party.

When I came across this recipe and decided to make it for a New Year's Eve function, it seemed to me something was "missing" to go with the cheese and tomatoes. What? Roasted Garlic! Four "large" cloves, mashed in a small bowl along with a bit of Kosher salt and added along with the cheese and tomatoes. Making this mixture a day previous, or at least eight hours prior to use, is a very good idea.

This appetizer is so good - and very easy to make! Would definitely make again.

When I first found this recipe, I was just looking for something to do with extra buttermilk, but now this recipe is why I buy buttermilk!!! This stuff is fantastic! I have made this several times, for various groups of people, and everyone always raves about it! The last time I made it, I was in a hurry and simply puréed the ingredients (with the cheese already grated!) in the food processor and served it as a special tapinade, which we spread on crackers, as well as on celery... and the vegetarians in the group thought I'd served them something with smoked salmon... a result of the flavour of the smoked Gouda and the colour of the oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes... this is yet another keeper from Epicurious!!

Save yourself some time and wondering and serve this with crackers not celery. Cut the mayo in half and consider replacing with sour cream the NEXT you serve it. (Try it with just mayo first, and then decide to include sour cream if you serve again.) If you like a little kick in your dishes then add a spice. If not, it is fine as is. Serving with celery does wash out the flavor and can add a presentation dilemma if you are serving dish impaired like me. It is easier to serve with a nice table cracker or grainy type cracker.

I personally thought this was a little too mayonnaise-ie, if I make this again (and I probably will because everyone else liked it), I will use 1/2 the amount of mayo and maybe the other 1/2 sour cream. I also added cayenne pepper, everyone liked the kick it had. I didn't use baby celery, I de-stringed regular big size, cut off a small portion on the backside so the celery would sit flat, then filled it up, and cut it into about 1 inch pieces.

I halved the amount of mayonnaise added and didn't notice a difference so next time will leave it out altogether. Everyone loved this appetizer and I will definitely make it again!

Ecellant finger food when served in Celery. Some hot paprika adds that extra "zip". Will also be trying it as a zip with crackers/pita chips.

Excellent! I've made this four times and have had quite a few people ask for the recipe. The only thing I changed was Light Miracle Whip which added a bit more sweetness. Served with pita chips...it was fantastic.

Wonderful! Made the recipe as is for Thanksgiving Day and it went over well... We liked the celery, but crackers would have worked well also. Still have some of the ingredients, I think I will make it again this week when my parents come by.

I wouldn't make this again. Maybe it was the mayonaise, but the filling was too "thin" for my taste and looked sort of greasy and unappetizing after it sat out on my relish tray.

Made this appetizer as part of Thanksgiving Dinner in Nov. 2000, and it was terrific. Would also be good on crackers in addition to stuffed in the celery.

Served with crackers in a photograhy exhibition opening; refilled the 16-inch plate twice and not one single craker left.

Great flavor and presentation for a finger food. I can see where it would make a nice spread for crackers.

After tasting it i agreed with the other reviewers that it could have a bit more flavor. I added the cayenne (to taste) and some crumbled bacon. Definitely made it! My husband's comment was "this is kick-@** dip!" Served it with crackers instead of the celery.

I thought the gouda and sun-dried tomato spread was really good, but the celery sort of washed it out. I stuffed 1/2 the spread in celery and served the rest in a dish to spread on crackers. The dish was empty before the celery was gone.

I liked this recipe quite a bit. It wasn't quite as tasty as I was expecting. If you like a little spice I would suggest adding some cayenne pepper and/or some cajun spices to give it a little kick.

Easy, tasty, and yet elegant enough to fill up the niches on the appetizer plate. I never have had leftovers when I served these.
