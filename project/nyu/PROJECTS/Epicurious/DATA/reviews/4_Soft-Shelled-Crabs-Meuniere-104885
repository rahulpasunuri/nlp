Lovely recipe and easy. Adapts well to gluten free by substituting corn flour for the wheat flour. Since the flavors of corn & butter are quite compatible,this was not a problem at all. Clarified butter the day before preparing the crabs. Dressing live crabs was an experience!

I was nervous about making soft-shell crabs and clarified butter for the first time. However, this is a very easy recipe. Very yummy recipe that really lets the crabs shine. Will be making this again this season.

I have lived in Maryland nearly 20 years all told and I never had tried to cook soft-shell crabs. This recipe is SO good and SO easy! To clean crabs yourself takes about 30 seconds: (1) cut off the eyes and mouth with a sharp scissors, (2) lift up the upper shell on either side and sweep out the "gills" with your finger, and (3) remove the "apron" on the underside (the pointy hard thing). I did add 1 tsp of Old Bay seasoning to the flour before dredging. I skimped on the clarified butter and was sorry because any little bits of solid non- clarified butter will burn. Even so the dish was delicious and a huge hit. This is definitely going to become a new specialty of mine, and this is my go-to recipe.

Quick, easy, tasty. I'm allergic to milk, so soaked crabs in water. Added a little cayenne, salt and pepper to the dredging flour. Deglazed the pan with a little white wine with the lemon juice. Don't actually think you need the extra butter, but what the hell? I think the key to this is great, ultra-fresh crabs.

Our guests loved the outcome of this recipe. Even those that are normally not so fond of soft shell crabs said they turned out amazingly well.

This was really good, but next time I'm going to use vegetable oil to saute crabs but still use the brown butter at end. This was a bit to buttery-greasy for me.

Delicious & so easy! I agree it's the only way to eat soft-shell.

This was delicious and simply made at the last minute. My wife who had a distaste for texture of soft shell crabs loved it and can't wait to eat them again. I added a tsp of Old Bay to flour before dredging crabs.

This is simple and sublime! At my supermarket, I can buy Indian ghee (clarified butter) in a jar, so I have it for many purposes whenever I need it. This is just a regular store, not an ethnic market, so if you can find ghee you have your clarified butter. Ask your grocer. We have a weakness for soft-shell crabs, but this recipe gets an A+ for both flavor and simplicity. It's a 10 in my book!

Very easy (especially if you have the fishmonger clean the crabs for you!) and quite flavorful. We served the crabs with pasta and steamed artichokes for a great meal. Do not let the clarified butter intimidate you!

I made this recipe exactly as it is written and it turned out delicious. My husband couldn't believe I was clarifying butter. This was the first time I ever made soft shells, and my husband said they just may have been the best he had ever eaten!! This recipe is a keeper.

Loved it. I sauteed some slivered almonds and put them on top of the crabs - it was a real hit!

This would have been delicious IF I would have cleaned the yellow gook from the inside of the crabs first (I had never made it before). Otherwise it was great!

Outstanding and easy. I too added a bit of cayenne pepper for extra flavor.

Soft Shell Crabs are my favorite. This was so fast and easy. The only thing I added was a touch of Cayenne Pepper and Paprika for a kick! It was delicious!
