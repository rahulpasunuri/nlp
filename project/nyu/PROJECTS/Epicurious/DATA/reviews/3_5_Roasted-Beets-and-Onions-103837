This was very tasty. I did toss with a bit of balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper to serve. It may have been a bit plain without it.

Easy and delicious. I'm hooked on beets this year because of this recipe. I have made some variations-before serving, I add a little olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and thyme.

Everyone who ate this LOVED it. I blanched the onions for easy peeling (and highly recommend it). I threw the trimmed beets, the onions, half an inch of vegetable boullion, salt, pepper and whole stems of thyme in a roasting pan at 400 for about 40 minutes. Really delicious, and healthy.

To the cook from San Jose: The recipe recommends blanching the onions to make them simple to peel, not to change the taste of the dish. If you've never used that method to peel pearl or baby onions, try it, the skins slip right off.

I have been roasting beets for many months now; I was first made aware of this excellent method of preparing beets from the cookbook, "The Fig's Table" written by Todd English and ?. Anyway, the recipe is for a salad of roasted beets with a wonderful dressing made with gorgonzola cheese, toasted chopped walnuts, and balsamic vinegar. We love the beets when roasted so much, that we don't even bother fixing the dressing anymore, except on special occasions. I get good results without the additional step of wrapping either the beets or the onions in foil. Also, I've never blanched the onions before roasting them and I've never found it to be a problem. Next time, I'll try the blanching step to see if it makes a difference.
