Simply amazing. I halved the recipe to make 4 servings, and between my bf and me the pudding was gone as soon as it came out of the oven! It's the one dish my bf still talks about 3 weeks later. I'm getting the hint - will be making it again soon.

Delicious - I cooked for 50 minutes in 2 quart dish because I didn't have ramekins, so it was a big soggy in the middle. I think I'll try big muffin tins next time. But my family devoured it, served with roast sirloin. Also, used Hawaiian bread because could find Challah on Christmas Eve and they don't sell Brioche in this part of "Merlin." (that's what I get for last minute shopping).

Made this for the first time tonight and it was DEE-LICIOUS! These were the minor tweaks I made. 1. used 1 lb shitake mushrooms and 1/2lb creminis (shitakes are my favorite so I used the most of those, pick your favorite mushrooms!) 2. I added slightly more half and half to avoid the too eggy texture, about 1/8 cup or less. 3. Added some sprigs of rosemary in the mixture and sprinkled a little on top before placing in the oven. 4. Had to cook the challah a few minutes longer to make it brown and crispy. Enjoy!

Made this instead of the usual wet-bread stuffing for Thanksgiving, and it was the hit of the meal! I made it again but with rehydrated wild and fresh white mushrooms - don't! I took an outstanding recipe and made it boring and relatively tasteless. It is absolutely worth the price of fresh wild mushrooms.

I didn't think this was that good. It was good for using up some bread, mushrooms, and cheese that I had, but I would not specifically buy the ingredients for it.

I made recipe as is with the exception I couldn't find any bread other than French and I used my pyrex Oval, but this recipe is SO SAVORY it doesn't matter, Tasty, hubby loved it wants to see it in reg. meal line up. The longer the bread soaks the better it tastes! Nice crispy top too! Definately make again!

Really, really disappointed with this. Too much pepper, and had the consistency of soggy quiche. I cooked it in a 2 quart pan and had to go an extra 20 minutes for it to set up - and it still came out soggy. I dunno, considering previous reviews I really expected something more amazing.

Very well received by our Christmas dinner guests, it was a flavorful and out of the ordinary accompaniment to a roast beef tenderloin (from Bon Appetit December 2007).

Rating: 4
Guests loved it. Nice texture of crispy bread crumbs on top and soft interior. Used 8oz brioche, the extra kept the interior from being too mushy. Simple and elegant. I made it for 9 in a baking dish, it did not take any longer than specified in the recipe.

Made these to go with roast chicken and they were great -- making again to go with roast pork tenderloin stuffed with dried winter fruits. I made them in a silicon muffin pan so they were individual servings and I warmed the left over ones up and served with a bit of ham for lunch--think they were almost better the second day.

This articulates the mushroom character beautifully. Nice texture, with a delicate and yet hearty flavor. I made the casserole version and it took FOREVER to set but was well worth the extra wait.

This was just delicious. I used 2% milk instead of cream the second time I made it and it was just as delicious. I also served it in place of stuffing with a roast chicken and it was a hit. Definitely one of my faithful stand bys.

Made for Mother's Day, and had to make 3 copies of the recipe it was such a hit. Doubled the recipe for 12 people, but had no leftovers. Used a bag of mixed shredded Parm/Asiago/Fontina/Grana from TJ's which I preferred to just the Parm that I've used before.

I made this a few weeks ago to compliment a meal & it was delicious! Unfortunately our 3-yr-old decided that she doesn't like mushrooms (though she devoured them the previous week). Aside from that, it was a hit!

Excellent. So so delicious and yes, very forgiving. Served it with the stout-braised short ribs. Heaven.

As written, it needs a lot of help, but with a few adjustments it turns out great. Bread needs to be cubed much larger, so it won't fall apart when mixing; bread takes about 30 minutes to toast; a larger pan is needed; and it needs to be baked much longer.

I always get confused reading all the comments - esp when they are somewhat negative. This was great! I used a mix of whole wheat sliced bread from TJs, LaBrea bakery multigrain and LaBrea pugliese bread. It was great (I worried it was too dense and not eggy enough). I also mixed 2 percent milk with fat free greek yogurt and it worked out perfectly). I didn't notice any sour taste at all and it was nice to lighten it and not have to buy cream. Didn't have Italian parsely but used herbs from my garden - chives/basil/thyme/oregano. I would do this again and maybe experiment more. It's a forgiving recipe. Oh, I also subbed some olive oil for half the butter. All fine subs. And i forgot the Parmesan cheese. Again, fine.

Rating: 4
Wow, was this good. I used mostly shitake, and about a quarter pound each of crimini and oyster mushrooms. I also used 2% milk instead of half and half and a full cup of parmigiano. I also froze the extra servings and will heat them in foil later. A keeper!

This is a follow-up to my review from 4/2008. I love this dish so much that I have made it for Christmas dinner three years in a row. Here is what I have learned along the way: 1) Other bread can work, but the challah is hard to beat. 2) Good mushrooms make all the difference. Use no more than 1/4 lb creminis. I like to use 3/4 lb shitakes (flavorful but no too expensive) and fill in the remaining 1/2 lb with fancy stuff like hen of the woods. Don't use a packaged wild mushroom mix, as the flavor will suffer from too many creminis. 3) Use some extra half and half (about 3/8 cup) to get a creamy consistency and avoid the egg-y texture that some reviewers have mentioned. Sooo good. Enjoy!

I used Acme Herb slab, along with fresh sage and added sautéed sausage meat. I also shortened the cooking time to 20 minutes but allowed it to rest for 20 minutes before serving. I think the egg continued to cook while waiting, making for a very tender chew.

Made this for Christmas in a casserole dish. It was a hit! I used hen of the woods, portobello, & oyster mushrooms & doubled the butter. This is so good I can't wait to make it for company again!

Wow! Beyond elegant. An impressive side dish that will impress at any dinner party. I've made this several times. I've even used just plain old crimini mushrooms when nothing else is available. Truly swoon-worthy. I love that it can be made ahead and popped in the oven when ready for dinner. It is scrumptious, but be forwarned--it's rich and filling, so be mindful of lightening up on the other dishes.

One of the few times I varied a recipe in here, and have to admit, not using brioche, but using a artisan bread with hard crust, did not work. My bad! I went to the SF Farmers market, we have the best Mushroom guy there, and bought loads of wild mushrooms and added leaks to the mixture, ok Good so far. Then I used a lovely artisan bread, thinking this would go along with the rich mixture. What a bummer, all the time shopping, chopping , costs, etc, I was not impressed at all.It lacked luster, considering using such quality ings. For me, I shall try another recipe to use wild mushrooms. This is one recipe I would say...stick to the ing reccomended!

Interesting -- would def add another herb next time, rosemary springs to mind, and I see someone did try that one. Or thyme. I used gruyere, which was good.

Great side dish...I've made in both ramekins and casserole dish and either way works well. I'll have to try the goat cheese...sound like a good addition. If using ramekins, they take less time in the oven than suggested.

wonderful! I used fresh minced rosemary instead of the parsley since that is what I had at home. As others recommended, I also added a bit of goat cheese to the liquid mixture and then baked the puddings in well-greased muffin tins. So easy and sooo delicious.

I saw enough good reviews about the base recipe that I felt confident experimenting a bit. I used cremini, oyster, shiitake, and portobello mushrooms. I also rehydrated dried porcini mushrooms in about 3/4 cup of hot water and added the hot mushroom water to the cream mixture. I also added about 1/2 tbsp of thyme and rosemary which worked beautifully. In addition, I added about 2.5-3oz of goat cheese to the cream mixture. I baked the pudding in a 9x13? pan for about 50 minutes. The result is out of this world good.

MAybe a little dry, I halved the recipe though so I may have added a few too many challah pieces. I used oyster and maiitake mushrooms which were great... a couple shiitake thrown in for volume. Will make again!

I really liked this recipe but it did seem a bit "eggy". Next time, i will use 1 less egg and see if that helps. Maybe a bit more bread crumbs too, to help soak up the egg. The flavors are great - don't skimp on the mushrooms. The chanterelle, oyster and cremini combo is great!

I practiced for my Christmas Eve dinner and was torn between this and the 97 version on this site. HUGE difference. Presented the two (cooked at same time) to husband. We both tested then we had our comments. This one won HANDS down so when I read someone preferred the 97 I was dumbfounded. Must not have had them side by side. Though the other one had more herbs, the shallots in this one shined- it was actaully much more flavorful than the other one. NOT EGGY. The challah vs. the french bread was a no-brainer- the challah wins hands down. Serving with whole roasted Tenderloin with rosemary port sauce coupled with some sauteed spinach. THIS IS A WINNER! p.s. I hate people that review recipes with adaptions. Don't review a recipe that you didn't follow!

Great Recipe, only changes were i added a 1/4 cup of brandy to the mushrooms once cooked, to deglaze, and allowed it to cook till absorbed, then added to the egg mixture. I have made this twice now, the first time in the ramekins,without my addition of brandy. They were even better the next time with the brandy and I made them in a large buttered muffin tin! Crunchier all over. and easier !! Try it !!

I LOVE this recipe and have made it three times as well,using a gratin pan and it is beautiful. Use the best mushrooms you can find..I used Chantrelles, oyster and Hen of the Woods and each time the flavor was incredible . I have served it with beef tenderloin, roast beef and even roast chicken and it was great with all three. It is a very forgiving recipe and a really impressive crowd pleaser

Rating: 4
This was super easy to make, and is great for company b/c it can be prepped ahead of time and put into the oven to coincide with the rest of dinner. the key is to add really great wild mushrooms - don't sub crimini. I followed the recipe exactly. My guests liked it so much that there was hardly any discussion at the dinner table!

We've made this three times since our Gourmet arrived in December. We've used different mushrooms each time, and different breads for the bread cubes, added too many shallots b/c we chopped too many, extra parsley same reason... All versions were excellent. This is not only an exceptionally delicious treat, it's a very forgiving recipe. Who would have thought something this luxurious would end up as a family staple! To borrow a quote from my fellow Bay Area cook below - Wow!

Fantastic. A huge hit along with roast beef tenderloin and scalloped potatoes for Christmas dinner. I didn't have enough ramekins, so I used a SHALLOW glass baking dish which worked perfectly. There was lots of crispy topping, it baked all the way through quickly and wasn't too eggy as some have complained about. Would definitely make again.

Wow! Made this for Christmas Eve with the herbed fillet of beef and wilted spinach with nutmeg butter - recreated it all again for New Year's Eve. This is a deliciously different side dish - take the time to do the ramekins, I've made it with and without and it just turned out better (and prettier) with the ramekins.

This was all that it promised however it does take longer to prepare that what Gourmet says - cleaning and chopping 1 1/2 lbs of wild mushrooms alone will take a good half hour... I prepared the brioche cubes one day ahead, and sauteed the mushrooms in the morning. Preping ramequins with parchment paper and butter is a must. Assembling is easy and can be done just before you serve the 1st course.

Made this for Christmas Eve along with Prime Rib Roast with Red-Wine Sauce. Everyone loved it. I 1.5X the recipe and prepared in one dish. Had left overs for brunch the day after Christmas...moved to a smaller dish, drizzled with half and half and warmed. Went perfect with salad and quiche.

The ingredients sounded way better than the final product turned out to taste. It took longer to cook than stated. Just ok.

I made this for NY Eve and it was a great success. It's very rich, succulent but with subtle flavors, so it makes a good side dish to more flamboyant or strongly-flavored main dishes--it doesn't hog the stage but plays a wonderful supporting role. As noted previously, baking it in one dish (rather than ramekins) means one needs to increase the cooking time to approx. one hour.

Rating: 4
This was a home run - I made it for 12 and just 1.5X everything. I struggled to find fresh chanterelle and oyster - so bought 2 boxes each of the dried versions and mixed with .75 lb of cremini and it worked perfectly. The cooking time was a bit longer - and I sure wish I could buy pre cut parchment paper for the ramekins (grin).

Served this an an alternative to Yorkshire pudding with our Christmas prime rib. Very yummy indeed. HOWEVER, if you bake it in one cassarole as I did, it will not cook completely in the resting time of your roast!! Maybe the individual ramekins would cook in time, but I almost ruined my prime rib waiting for this pudding to cook. I ended up throwing it in the microwave for a couple of minutes to finish. The near disaster was averted, and the pudding was quite tasty and well-received by all our guests.

I made this on christmas day and it was AWESOME and got rave reviews! i made it in a large dish instead of ramkin dishes as i did not have enough ramkin dishes. I used skim milk instead of half and half and it turned out great! I used shitake mushroom, swiss browns, button mushrooms, oyster mushrooms and japanese honjimeshi mushrooms.

Rating: 4
Now, officially, my second-most favourite use of wild mushrooms. A real winner! I made this to accompany prime rib on Christmas Day. I unfortunately didn't have little ramekin dishes, so I made it in a loaf pan. Slightly on the eggy side, but unlike other reviewers who didn't find that to be a plus, I really loved the custardy texture and rich flavour of the egg and cream, which stood up really well with the beef and mushrooms.

Made this Christmas day along with the tenderloin featured. It was a huge hit. Used chanterelles, shitakes, oyster, and cremini mushrooms. Prepared the mushroom mixture and toasted the bread the day before and assembled a couple of hours before cooking. Ramekins make a terrific presentation.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was fabulous! I opted for the casserole dish rather than individual ramekins. The smell while it was baking in the oven was heavenly. Don't skimp on the mushrooms - I used a mix of shiitakes, oyster, chanterelles, porcini (reconstituted from dried) and cremini. Worth every penny the wild mushrooms ended up costing! I'll definitely be making this again for winter gatherings.

Made this for Christmas Eve, along with porcini crusted filet mignon with fresh herb butter and green beans with sage and pancetta. It was rated the best dinner I've ever made by my boyfriend. I highly recommend these individual bread puddings. I didn't find them difficult at all... Like the other reviewer, didn't use parchment, just butter the ramekins well. They unmolded easily without it. Absolutely delicious. I'll be using this often, and am planning on trying different additions like leeks and asparagus, and different cheeses.

Very good, but not exceptional. It is basically a fancy mushroom quiche. It was very labor-intensive, you can skip the buttered wax paper at the bottom of each and just make sure to butter the ramekins very well.
