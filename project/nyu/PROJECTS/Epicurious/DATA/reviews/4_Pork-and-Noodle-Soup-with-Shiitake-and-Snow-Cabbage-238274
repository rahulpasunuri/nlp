I made this recipe for my son who very much likes asian food. I did not find snow cabbage so I bought chinese cabbage and cooked them in water with 2 tb of cider vinegar. I sliced pork from a cooked pork roast I had in the fridge and used fresh shiitake mushrooms. Quite pleased with the results.

Really nice flavors and super easy to make. I also use fresh shiitakes and throw the stems in the broth. This is a big hit in our house.

Very good. I made it with chicken and did not use snow cabbage. The noodles absorb a lot of the fluid, and become mushy so I would not recommend them for leftovers, unless they are kept separate from soup.

Very yummy and easy. I couldn't find the preserved cabbage, so substituted dry lily flowers, which has the same tangy flavor. I marinated the pork overnight in soy sauce and wine with some scallions (a standard Chinese marinade), which gave the pork great flavor. Also, if you sprinkle the noodles with a splash of sesame oil before pouring the hot soup over it, it'll add a fantastic aroma to the dish.

I made this one night after coming home from work. It was very fast and easy to make. Great for a quick, filling meal! Everyone loved it and I made it again the following night. It's wonderful leftover and was great to take to work. I left out the snow cabbage the first time and I substituted green onions, and it was still fabulous!
