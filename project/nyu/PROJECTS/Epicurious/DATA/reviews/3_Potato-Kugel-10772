It's a decent potato kugel recipe. Pretty standard. The person I made it for loves potato kugel, however, and would rate this 5 forks! I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan. I doubled all ingredients and in addition, added an extra egg and an extra potato or two. When I doubled the schmaltz I blended 3 tbsp of fat into the kugel and used 3 to grease the pan. Cooked for about an hour at 350, it came out well.

It's a pretty standard potato kugel. My guests liked it but it's not anything special.

One can only hope that they were joking about the bacon fat!!!

Not bad. Good comfort food. I shredded the vegetables in my Cuisinart so it was quick and easy. I also doubled the recipe.

Me and my family all agreed that this turned out delicious! I tried the suggestion of using olive oil as a substitute and it worked fine. (On a side note, the one thing I learned the hard way was the importance of the onion; don't go even a bit shorter than what the recipe calls for).

Disappointing recipe. I followed it to the letter and once it cooled it became very hard and chewy. I was trying to show my husband that Kugel can be good, but this recipe conformed to all the bad kugel stereotypes.

I am responding to the other review suggesting the substitution of bacon drippings for the chicken fat. I would say this would cause a reaction among one's Jewish guests ranging from mildly grossed-out to to fully insulted. Since kugel is originally a Jewish dish, I suggest saving your pork products for another purpose and at least trying to adhere to the general idea of this very traditional dish (observant Jews don't eat pork or mix milk with meat).

Comfort food to the maxx! My grandmother was from Lithuania and made this dish for me often when I was a little girl. When she passed away in 1978, most of her hand written recipies went to other family members. I am so happy to have found this! Grandma would bake this in a loaf pan and serve with pot a feu, and a creamy horseradish catsup.

Since my mother passed away I have been unable to find her recipe for potato kugel she wrote down for me years ago...now I have one that tastes so close. Many thanks!

The only problem I have with this recipe is the chicken fat. I am going to try it with olive oil. I tried it without oil and it was quit good.
