I'm always looking for a basic recipe like this and then I modify with what I have on hand. I read the other reviews and omitted the flaxseed for 1/2 cup oatmeal and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour (sorry glucose-phobes), used dried cherries and pecans, and added a handful of milk chocolate bits. Although healthy tasting, my husband liked them a lot, and thanks to the flour they hold together well. Definitely a keeper base recipe for further messing around.

I thought these were only okay. The peanut butter taste was nice, but the bars remained very mushy, even after I baked them ten extra minutes. I think next time I will add half a cup of oats to try to give these a little more body and a little less mush.

I've tried a lot "energy bar" type of recipes, and this is one of my favorites. I change it up a bit each time. I like to add a bit of unsweetened cocoa powder because hey, peanut butter & chocolate, right? I also sometimes turn these into protein bars by adding a scoop or two of unflavored whey protein isolate. When I do this, I lower the oven temp and cook longer so as to not de-nature the proteins.

This has become my breakfast staple! I did add some vanilla extract and cinnamon, and also left the muffins in the oven for an extra 30 minutes. They came out much more firm and more "doughy."

I didn't have flaxseed so used steel cut Irish style oats. I also made as mini-muffins. The taste was nice, not too sweet. The texture was good: chewy and crispy at the same time. But overall just nice. Not a combination or proportion of ingredients I would make again.
