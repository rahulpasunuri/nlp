I made this for 12 for Christmas Eve as a first course. The consomme was excellent, very intense, so you'd better like mushrooms. A lot! I liked that I could make everything in advance and "fire" the dish effortlessly before serving, but I was disappointed that my hats did not rise much. Local Whole Foods was out of dried morels, so I subbed a mix of dried porcini and lobster mushrooms-these seemed too chewy for the soup, but I can't comment on the morels.

I added the sherry at the table after baking. It made for a wonderful flourish to crack the puffy pastry and spoon in a little sherry to taste. Everyone still mentions this years later!

A lovely dish. I've made it twice and my husband loves it.
