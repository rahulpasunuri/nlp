This was great. I broiled it because it was another rainy day. Perfect way to use the sage from my farm share and the kids liked it too! A real winner.

We absolutely loved this recipe. I made a paste of the garlic, S&P, and sage and spread it over the tomatoes for a even coating. Yum! Yum! Yum! Yes, some of the spice was lost on the grill, but the flavor was fantastic. (Don't move the tomatoes for the first few minutes and more will stay on.) Who knew sage and tomato would be such a fabulous affair!

"cook 4 to 6 minutes per side"? Lost all of the sage (both chopped and whole). Better done under the broiler without turning! But I prefer bread crumbs, garlic salt and parmeson cheese. . .
