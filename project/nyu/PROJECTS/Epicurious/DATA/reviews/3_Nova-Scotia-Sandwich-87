Although mustard and vinegar have a place in cooking, I have to disagree with adding them to the balance of ingredients. Nova, cream cheese,and a slice of red onion is something not to be messed with

I served this to my Mother and future Monther-in-Law and they absolutely loved it. Even though they had been snacking all morning, they ate every last bite! A definite keeper especially for when they ladies come over for a light lunch.

I'm crazy about this recipe. Of course, I used my own homemade gravlax. Instead of toasted bagels, I used bakery made rye bread. It was truely delicious.

I made this with sweet/hot mustard rather than honey mustard and it was fabulous! The whole sandwich melts in your mouth! Will definitely be making this again.

The onion in this recipe, however thinly sliced, was overpowering, and ruined the flavour of the salmon. I would reduce the onion to a thin shaving, and try to find some really strongly flavoured salmon.
