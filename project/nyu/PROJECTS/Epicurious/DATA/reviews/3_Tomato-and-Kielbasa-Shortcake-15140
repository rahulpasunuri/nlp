My boyfriend really liked it, but I thought the Kielbasa overpowered the jalapeno and cilantro. I'll make it again; but next time, I'm going to take it in a more Italian direction-- peppers, more onions, Italian seasonings, etc...

This has become a fairly regular dinner at our house..I make it just as the recipe goes and we all thoroughly enjoy it every time!

These biscuits are great, and I'll definitely make them again. The filling didn't thrill me; it was a little strange. I don't think kielbasa works well with the Mexican-style ingredients. Not a bad quick dinner, but I don't expect to make the whole thing again.

This was diappointing...it just needed something! The sum total of its parts is somehow less than its ingredients which looked wonderful.

We really enjoyed this recipe. While we didn't find the biscuits "blah" like the other cook, we would "kick it up a notch" by adding some chopped jalapeno or cilantro to the biscuit dough.

This was really easy to make and quite good.

This was a tasty, reasonably quick dinner. My family enjoyed it. The corn bread "shortbread" could probably use a touch more salt, it was a bit blah.
