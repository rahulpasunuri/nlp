Extremely easy and quite tasty. Not a meal for company, but great for a weeknight. I only had salted pistachios on hand, but I rinsed them off (not sure if this made a difference) and used them anyway, and it was just fine. I even needed to add a bit of salt in the end.

I was reading this recipe and it come to my attention that it calls for tomatoes??? if this is a pesto...NO tomatoes should be used. I am Italian and know what really means pesto. this recipe is all wrong.

I thought this was average at best. I always try to make the recipe as written the first time. It is possible that with the arbitrary measurements of "a handful" that my porportions were off. It had a bland, slightly sweet flavor, not really identifiable as pistachio. A little salt did help brighten the flavor, but not enough to make it again.

I made this today and it was delicious! First time I ever tried this kind of pasta! Just may become one of my favorites!

I haven't yet made this but plan to try it soon. It sounds like something a fussy toddler, who likes noodles and pistachios might enjoy, while still getting some nutrition!

Recipe was great however in the future I will cook the garlic a bit since every few bites raw garlic was really potent. Otherwise great dish

I thought this recipe was excellent. I prepared it exactly as directed with the exception of adding a few basil leaves as well. I was skeptical about the mint but didn't taste it at all in the mix. I appreciated the fact that the fat is reduced (only 2 tbsp oil) from a more traditional pesto. The addition of tomato was delicious and yet not overwhelming. I made it with whole wheat pasta as I thought this would complement the coarse nutty texture of the sauce. Very pleased with the results. This recipe is a keeper. I am certain it would also be an amazing sandwich spread with sliced turkey on the second day.

this was a tasty alternative to a basil/pine nut pesto. The tomato added a nice sweetness. I tossed in some crumbled turkey sausage and spinach with bowties. Only made half a recipe and it was plenty for 12 oz pasta.
