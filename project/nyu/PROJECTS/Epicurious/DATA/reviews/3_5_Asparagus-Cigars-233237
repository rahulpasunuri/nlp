I baked these and my guests loved them! I was especting a crowd and didn't have time to stand over a frying pan. Here's how I did it: I spread the tortillas with chive onion cream cheese as suggested by a previous reviewer. Then after rolling up the asparagus, I took a bit of melted butter and brushed the outside of the tortilla, especially at the seam. (I skipped the egg.) This went very quickly. Then I baked the rolls for 8 min. at 500. Much less time and much less fat.

We loved this the first time I made it. However, the second time was even better as I spread the tortilla with onion & chive cream cheese. Then put a slice of turkey or ham on the cheese. Rolled up and followed directions per recipe. Also made with corn tortillas. I liked the flavor best with these, however, they don't roll as easily and therefore don't look as nice. Both ways are great!

I took the advise of past reviewers and added parm prior to rolling. It went along easily however the end result was not impressive. One piece of advise: warm the tortillas in the microwave for 30 secs for easier rolling.

Good and tasty- but more work than it was worth. The party guests liked them, though.

These are very good, and people love them. I sprinkle a little parmesan cheese inside the tortilla before I roll. Have got to have FRESH tortilla's otherwise they break if they are stale. For answer to previous question. They are a deep fried food, I think they are only good fresh although I had someone that ate them the next day out of the fridge and said they were good. But I would not think they could be made and rewarmed. They would just be soggy and warm. Well worth making.

Wasn't able to roll the asparagus. Tortila kept breaking. BAD!!!!!!

Question for cooks: can these be made in advance and re-heated?

Simple, unusual & so easy to prepare. Always add romano or parmesan cheese to egg mixture. Always a hit! Everyone always comments and they disappear quickly.

Not so easy to make if you're in a hurry, but definitely worth the effort. Teenage kids and adults enjoyed!!

I made these for a large group and they went over wonderfully. It is defintely all about the presentation and dipping sauce.

A huge hit at every party I served these at-light, crisp and crunchy. My 12 and 10 year old daughters even enjoyed them. They almost taste like tempura, but a whole lot easier.

As a personal chef I cant wait for my next dinner party to show these off. They were too easy and made a great presentation on the dinner table. I did add some parm cheese to the egg mixture. A great app to serve at any function.

I loved this recipe! I used flour and water to make a paste instead of the egg. The asparagus was crisp tender! Wonderful.
