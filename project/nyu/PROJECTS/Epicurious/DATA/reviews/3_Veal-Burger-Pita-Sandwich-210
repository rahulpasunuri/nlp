Made as directed. Bland burger, overpowered by curry flavor...and garlic.

Absolutely delicious! I omitted the mint, as I am not a fan of mint, and it was still wonderful. Everyone, even the picky teens at the table, woofed it down. I complimented the meal with the garlic sweet potato fries from this website and a greek salad. I can not wait to make it again!

Excellent flavor! I made this with hamburger and it tasted just like a gyro. I mixed the meat and the spices and let them sit in the fridge for 2 hours before cooking. I think ground lamb would be outrageously good!

Huge flavor for a "light" entree. We loved it even without the bread. The sauce does need to macerate to maximize the flavor; and, you may want to add a bit more curry powder if yours is a little old or a bit mild.

Very nice combination of flavors. Be sure to let the sauce sit for a little while, to blend the flavors. The only complaint at our house was that it was 'too lean!'
