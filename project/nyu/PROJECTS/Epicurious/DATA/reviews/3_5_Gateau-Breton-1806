I made this for a bon voyage party for a friend going to Paris. Delish! I served it with a dollop of nutella. Easy to make and it looked great. Everyone really liked it.

Very good, however traditionally (at least in my mother's region) cinnamon is never used. Would recommend leaving it out or substituting.

The flavor was excellent. It came out somewhat dry and compact. Maybe I did somethng wrong. I would give this another shot since the flavors were so good.

Since the May 1994 issue of BA came out, I have been making this gorgeous hazelnut cake. It has a superlative flavor that is sophisticated, yet rustic all at once. My family LOVES this cake. We serve it with seasonal berries and whipped cream or creme fraiche. I am a caterer/personal chef by profession, so my family has tried everything. My speciality is pastry, so my family is very fussy about goodies. They demand this for birthdays. It's that good. For cheffing jobs I serve this cut in fat wedges in a large rattan basket lined with some fruity napkin with the biggest strawberries I can find (with their greenery on, thank you); it is gorgeous and delicious. I will admit this only because I don't know you - we eat this for breakfast, if there's any left.

I liked this recipe very much, especially when added 2 tablespoon of "Frangelico" (Hazelnut licor) which makes it taste delicious, I also put some caramel and chocolate sauce at a side, sure will make it again, it has a great texture.
