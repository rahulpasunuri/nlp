loved this recipe. left out the shallots, added a little more tarragon, half of a lemon and a little stilton. served with broiled purple potatoes and fat croutons- the husband said he'd go vegetarian if this is how they eat every day. excellent.

This is very easy and very good. I've even put the egg on the side and had people put the egg on their own salads. Quite yummy.

This was not bad, but I really don't understand the rave reviews. I've had way better spinach salads.

Just made the dressing, which I love! I was trying to copy a recipe from a local restaurant (Postino) that serves a baby spinach salad with a creamy tarragon dressing and arborio-rice-crusted fried rock shrimp & thin Meyer lemon slices--it came out pretty good! (For the fried part: I dipped lemon slices & shrimp in buttermilk first, then used half Trader Joe's Sweet Rice Flour & half semolina for coating, then fried in 350 degree oil for a few minutes at most--hit with salt & pepper as soon as they're out of the fryer!). The dressing is a lovely complement to the spinach. I emulsified it in my mini-prep processor--it's pretty thick that way, possibly could be thinned with a tsp or 2 of water.

I have made this twice, always to great acclaim. It also has the advantage of being a transportable dish, good for potlucks. I use only baby spinach, and buy the largest white mushrooms I can find. Nice to avoid the heaviness of bacon (although I like that kind of spinach salad too)--but this doesn't compete with other main dishes. Slightly wilted leftovers are still good several hours later.

Ya just gotta love a recipe that mounds mushrooms on top of a spinster! : ) The idea of a touch of sugar is a good one. Reminds me of my grandmother's recipe.

OUTSTANDING. The only thing I did different was add a touch of sugar...just something my Mom always did! The entire family enjoyed it. Thanks!

Excellent and easy -- also, to the cook from Cambridge, I had the same visual you did of the spinster, and was not eating mushrooms at the time. Very funny!

This is not a review either but to the person from Cambridge MA, were you eating mushrooms when you wrote that comment??? Very bizarre.....

This is not really a review of the recipe but a comment on tn the typo it contains: "Cut mushrooms into very thin slices and mound on spinster." The mental picture it conjures up is wonderful. I see her crouching on the plate, wearing an old cardigan, waiting for the sliced mushrooms......

Yes, this is a really yummy recipe. And the other reviewer is right, it's almost a meal unto itself. Serve with some great bread and you've got yourself a nice little dinner.

This salad is great, I have tried a lot of spinach salads on Epi but this one RULES! The dressing is easy to make, and fast. The only caution I have is not to serve it with a very strong tasting main entree, as it is a strong tasting salad. But by itself...mmmm, mmm, good!!
