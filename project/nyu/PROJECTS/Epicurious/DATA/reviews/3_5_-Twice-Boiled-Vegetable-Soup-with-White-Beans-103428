Great recipe. One change I would make is to decrease the stewing time to about 45 minutes. My vegetables were too mushy for my taste after 75 minutes. Also, I added the kale with about 5 minutes left to stew and think that helps it keep its flavor and texture.

loved this soup. I used can beans and skipped the meat. Very delish

Love this soup. Like many others, I used canned beans. I didn't add bacon or pancetta, but did use some bacon fat I had saved to saute the veggies. Also added garlic and a parmesan cheese rind, which gave the soup the flavor punch it needed. Rosemary sounds like a good addition, too, and I think I'll try drizzling some infused oil over my next bowl, or make some herb garlic bread and put the soup over that. I'll make this again.

I didn't think this was a particularly good soup. I found it to be rather bland and boring. Perhaps if it had more beans in it. I think I would double the beans if I were to make it again. I did like being able to use up vegetables in my refrigerator

Really good, hearty, vegetabally soup. I know vegetabally isn't a word, but that's how it is. I skipped the olive oil as I'm trying to lose weight, but it still tasted great without it. I used canadian bacon instead of pancetta - didn't read through the recipe and actually diced it up into the soup. But it adds a little protein & makes a wonderful lunch with a side of whole grain crusty bread.

Like many other soups from Bon Appetit, this recipe certainly deserves its high rating. Wanting to use up a number of ingredients left over from entertaining over the holidays, I landed on this ribollita, and only had to run to the store to purchase the zucchini. Slight departures: Bypassed dried beans and opted instead for canned (don't judge me); used several T. rosemary infused evoo in place of regular evoo; added a little fresh thyme to get rid of what I had floatin' around in my fridge; (purposely) left out the cabbage; used regular bacon (just shy of 4 slices). Because I didn't have fresh green beans on hand, I made-do with the frozen variety (sacrilege, I know), and I'm not quite sure I could tell any difference. I did try the soup after its ~2 hour stove-top visit (and it was Yummy with a capital Y), but -- as the recipe indicates -- it is indeed a soup to be eaten the next day. I'm sure I'll make this again.

Excellent! Left out the pancetta and added a can of diced tomatoes. Have printed the recipe and will definitely make this again soon!

Wonderful! I substituted 2 cans of great northern beans as users suggested, pre-browned the bacon (cut into small pieces) in the pot, then dumped the oil, and added a teaspoon of herbs de provence and generous portions of salt and pepper. It's simply amazing. I will make this again, but use other vegetables!

A great warm soup chock full of vegetables. Like others, I used canned beans (2 cans) without any problems during the last half hour, and I used grated parmesan to finish. I also added plenty of pepper and some salt, and a dash of italian herbs and a bay leaf. Next time I think I would add diced tomatoes as well. Also, I did not do, but next time I think it would be good to brown the pancetta first.

I made this soup last night, and I think it's an excellent vegetable soup. Even my boyfriend, who doesn't like vegetables, ate two bowls of it. It was a lot of chopping, but it's still a very easy recipe. I love that the bacon/pancetta is removed as opposed to leaving it in the soup. The soup still has a nice bacon-y flavor, but I'm kind of on bacon overload, so I didn't mind not actually eating it. Also, I liked not having to cook the bacon before adding it to the soup--it's a lot less time and mess. I didn't mind the lack of herbage, but when I added some fresh rosemary to the pot, I liked the soup better. It kind of does need a lot of salt since it has so many fresh veggies. Also--even if you don't like cabbage--add it. You can't taste it, and it's good for you. Plus, savoy cabbage heads are little, so it's not like you're buying a huge head and wasting most of it. I wouldn't mind a little more tomato in this soup, but the last time I thought that and added tomato to a soup recipe, I ruined it. If I try it, I'll let you know. I think that this soup will freeze very well, and I look forward to eating it later.

My best veg soup ever. I make it as in the recipe but also a variation that replaces the potato with 2 ears of corn. I shuck it and put the cobs in the soup while it cooks. AND I add 2 smallish pieces of Parmesan rind . Both of these additions give wonderful flavor!

Really good recipe. I did use dried beans, but I think a 14 oz can of white beans (drained) would work fine. I used a mix of red and swiss chard, but did not add cabbage as my husband doesn't like it. I also used some smoked bacon in place of pancetta. I had some crostinis left over from a party that I'd frozen so I toasted and served the soup over it, yieliding a hearty, satisfying dish. One thing on this -- sliced russet potatoes are pretty big. Ditto on summer zucchini. Save diners grief by oughly chopping into bite-sized pieces. Also, slice the whole red onion, and then just chop two tablespoons of it. I would have given this four stars except that I thought that the seasoning was a bit bland; I ended up adding mixed Italian herbs and a bay leaf, plus a healthy dose of ground pepper.

Excellent. Hearty and filling; has lots of veggies, especially kale and cabbage.

This is really good! I received lots of compliments and requests for the recipe. I used canned beans that I added only for the last half hour of simmering. Added about tsp of dried basil, a TB of dried thyme, and a little garlic salt. I used veggie stock from a box instead of chicken, and instead of the olive oil drizzled before serving, I put a sprinkle of grated parmesan (whoa, that added the final touch!). Will definitely make again.

I felt this needed a little something, so I added some grated pecorino romano cheese and some garlic powder. It was excellent, tasty and hardy. I also let it cook longer than called for. I froze some, so I hope it'll be okay when thawed/reheated.

WOW! Delicious! I made the recipe exactly as written. I used bacon rather than pancetta, because that's what I had. I put it in raw, and I think that's what gives the soup a slightly "smoky" and rustic flavor. Don't forget that the recipe says to remove the pancetta or bacon at the end! That takes care of the issue of "chewiness". Also, I used the slicing disc on my food processor to slice all of the vegetables, thereby avoiding all of the chopping that other reviewers talked about. You also get nice, even vegetable slices with uniform thickness. It was a breeze! You could also use a mandoline if you have one. This recipe is a keeper!

FANTASTIC. Get ready to chop - it's worth it. I used canned beans and threw 5 cloves of garlic into the puree. Still lacked seasoning for my ttaste, so I doubled the pancetta and threw a handful of parmesan rinds in for the simmering process.

A hearty, filling soup. It benefits from lots of freshly grated parmesan sprinkled on top and your best EVOO as well.

FANTASTIC! Previous reviewer is right: a great soup for those "under the weather" and you can fiddle around with it easily. A keeper!

This is one of my favorite soup recipes. It's alot of chopping, but it's worth the effort. Definitely using canned beans doesn't alter the flavor.I make this when someone is under the weather and I think it works better than antibiotics. Everyone, and I've made it for many, loves it.

I have made this soup twice now and it's now one of my favorites--delicicous and hearty. I also fried up the bacon and pretty much followed the rest of the recipe but I'm sure you can substitute your favorite veggies. Definitely worth the time and effort

Didn't have time to soak beans and cook them, so used a can of white beans - still turned out great, also I used my stick blender to puree the soup just a little which thickened it up nicely. A really good hearty winter soup.

An excellent soup! I used a can of white kidney beans with success and also fried & crumbled the bacon before putting into pot. At first I was afraid that it lacked spices but it doesn't need anything more than the ingredients in the recipe. It does make a lot of soup and I may half the recipe the next time. Will certainly make again.

I really like this soup. Upon looking at the ingredients, it looked like 10 cups of broth would render it thin and almost cut back on the liquid. Don't be fooled! There are vegetables aplenty to give this soup a thick consistency. The use of bacon (or pancetta) gives it a good smoky flavor, though adding it is optional for the more vegetarian-minded. And lastly, I added a couple of fresh parmesan cheese rinds while the soup simmered. That always gives a nice flavor infusion to italian bean soups.

Absolutely gets better with time - yummy flavor. Froze well also. A perfect soup when you're in the mood for one brimming with vegetables and flavor. I actually used turkey broth left over from Thanksgiving.

Although I really liked this soup, I reeeeeally liked the white bean, kale and roasted vegetable soup on this site. It is fabulous!

Oh me oh my, this soup was fabulous on a cold night. And the next cold night. And the cold night after that. I made this soup with my vegetarian boyfriend while visiting him in western China. Which is a place both extremely cold and quite devoid of pancetta. Also, there are interesting vegetables a-plenty, but no labels. What's coming next is going to sound like we butchered this recipe, but it turned out delicious. We omitted the pancetta and celery. We used vegetable broth instead of chicken. We used white onions instead of red onions. And substituted a very large leafed, wacky spinach instead of kale. One thing I would venture to say is that two large carrots are a bit much when you mess with the recipe as much as we did, as they make the soup a bit sweet. Other than that, this was a beautiful soup sure to bring you closer to your loved ones.

Get ready for lots of chopping, but it is worth it! This soup is so delicious and healthy too. The one thing that I could have done differently, is cooked the bacon more to make it crispy because it turned out a bit chewy. The bacon flavor was delicious!

I made the recipe almost exactly as written. My husband and I both loved it and it is best the second and third time.

Surprizingly good! Went quickly with a food processor and canned beans. I omitted the greenbeans and celery, subsituted a bunch of green chard for the cabbage; morningstar farms breakfast strips for the pancetta; and dark miso paste for the broth. And I added some jalepeno pepper and rosemary. Very good!
