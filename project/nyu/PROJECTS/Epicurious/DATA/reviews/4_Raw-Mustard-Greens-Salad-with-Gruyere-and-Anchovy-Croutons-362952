This is delicious! Cooked for 6 people and everyone wanted seconds. it is on my short list for salads from here on out. Also- since I had pecorino romano cheese on hand, I substituted it for the gruyere. It was great!

Great Salad! Made last night for 7 people and it was very well received. I let the salad sit for 15 minutes to take a bit of the bite out of the mustard greens. Really tasty. I would definitely make again.

Sounds like a strange combo of flavors, but it is awesome!! The anchovy flavor is not at all overwhelming. What a delicious way to eat mustard greens. Trust me - try this recipe!

Agree with other reviewers - this is awesome. Kind of like a caeser salad, only way better. We got mustard greens in our CSA bag and had no idea what to do with them. Happened to have leftover anchovies from a dip recipe. It all came together with this recipe, and it was easily my biggest surprise hit of the year. Didn't change a thing about it and it was the dish everyone went back to for seconds (and thirds).

This salad is nothing short of amazing! I've always been skeptical about mustard greens, but on a whim decided to give this a go. Made exactly according to recipe. We couldn't get over how all the flavors came together in such a refreshing way. Ultra-skeptical husband devoured his portion. Will definitely make again.

I changed the bread to dark rye, added julienned ham and diced hard cooked eggs. Have a new luncheon salad.

This recipe is amazing and simple to make. The Gruyere really balances out the bitterness of the mustard greens. Another great way to add those leafy greens to your diet!

It looks delicious and healthy, especially after the winter holidays. I don't know whether you are a fan of brown rice but I just found a good salad recipe. You can check it out. http://www.fourgreensteps.com/community/recipes/salads/brown-rice-salad-with-orange-chipotle-vinaigrette

being from the South, we cook our greens to death the way our grandmothers taught us. Eating greens raw is a wonderful addition to anyone's repertoire of salad greens. Anchovy and lemon really balance the greens. This is just delightful.
