Very moist and sweet - love the contrast of the tart lemon. This would be good with poppy seeds added.

I just finished baking this bread and it is so yummy. I did not have whole milk so I used low fat milk and it worked just fine. I added 1 tsp. lemon extract and 1 Tbsp. lemon juice. I baked the bread in 3 small pans and it took 45 minutes. The bread is great without the glaze. It really is more like a pound cake than bread but easier. Would make great tea sandwiches with cream cheese.

I made this for my childrens school bake sale and it was a big hit. I didn't read the directions all the way through before starting so I put the entire 1 1/2 cups sugar in the mix so it was very sweet, but I didn't make any glaze. I added 1 Tbl. of lemon juice and 1/2 tsp. of lemon extract to the bread mix as I didn't think it would be lemon-y enough with just the lemon peel. Even with my modifications - unintentional and intentional, it turned out great.

Delicious recipe! I was looking for something with a real lemon tang and this was just what I had hoped for. I did add a extra teaspoon of the lemon zest and a tablespoon of lemon juice to the batter. I also added to the batter a half cup of vanilla yogurt which made it quite moist. The only thing I had trouble with was the edge cooking a little too fast before the center was done. My husband loved it, and he's usually not a big fan of sweet breads.

Made it with the recommendations of adding extra 1 tsp lemon zest an 1 tsp lemon extract to batter, plus 1/2 tsp lemon extract to glaze. Delicious! Not dry at all - very moist.

It was good... but a little dry. The glaze is really good. Moistening tips would be welcome.

OH YUM! I increased the lemon zest to 3 tsp. and added 1 Tblsp. of lemon juice to batter. Made a mistake and dumped all the 1 1/2 cups sugar in the batter..but made no difference. It was awesome and ALLLLL gone. Enjoy! www.mysandwichgeneration.com

This recipe is fine as is but now I know what changes I will make to it next time. Using less sugar I'll need to increase the liquid so I'll try to add 1/4c. of s. cream along with the milk. I'd also use cake flour for a finer crumb. Rather than increase the zest for more tartness I added 1/2t. lemon oil to the batter and used less sugar in the glaze. I would definitely apply the glaze when the cake is fairly warm so that it will be absorbed throughout the cake. With these tweaks it should taste pretty close to the citrus bread they sell at Peet's Coffee.

This is to correct the previus review. I added an EXTRA tsp of zest AND a tsp of lemon extract to the batter. To the syrup I added 1/2 tsp extract. Very good recipe.

Very good!!! I didn't have a loaf pan so I used a muffin pan and cut the cooking time in half. Everyone loved them and they were easy to serve.

This recipe is almost exactly like the one that Bernard Clayton has in his classic "The Complete Book of Breads." He adds a tablespoon of lemon extract to the batter, and peels the lemon rind with a vegetable peeler, then chops it for a chewier texture. I use only a teaspoon of lemon extract or 1/2 teaspoon of lemon oil, into the batter. Makes it super lemony.

This bread is absolutely delicious! It's very easy to make. I took the suggestion of others and used extra zest and added some lemon juice to the batter. I used skewers to ensure that the lemon glaze reached the inside of the bread. I also sprinkled the top of the bread with cinammon after the glaze was absorbed. I will definitely make again!

My husband preferred the second loaf I made with reduced sugar in the bread and more glaze. Easy and delicious.

Yum! I made some changes to this to make it healthier and it was a great success. I replaced the butter with 1/2 cup vegetable oil and cut the sugar back to 1 cup total-- 2/3 cup for bread and 1/3 cup for glaze. It was still very sweet and moist. Oil can almost always be subbed for butter in quick breads. The fats in oil are much healthier than the fats in butter. Instead of whole milk I used 1/4 cup low fat soy milk and 1/4 low fat yogurt. I also doubled the amount of lemon juice and zest and added 2 tbsp chopped fresh lavender flowers. I did as another reviewer suggested and poked holes all over the warm bread with a long skewer. Excellent suggestion. All the reviews for this recipe and for the "lemon tea bread" also on this site were very helpful in making this recipe fabulous. Thanks!

Add a good couple of Tbs of lemon juice to the batter and make sure to poke lots of holes in the loaf in order for the syrup to seep in. I make this as a hostess gift all the time. It travels well and everyone loves it, plus that way you often get to eat it for breakfast throughout your stay! ;)

I rate this recipe as I sit here licking the mixer attachments... the recipe is great, though I used 2/3 sugar and it still was plenty sweet. I also added cranberries for variety. Absolutely great.

I thought this cake was great. To give it a good lemony taste though, i added an extra teaspoon (or more) of lemon peel and a little more than a tablespoon of juice to the batter. also i really advise putting enough holes into the cake for the glaze to reach the bottom or it won't have the same sweet flavor as the rest of the loaf. overall this recipe was pretty simple, came out wonderfully and i will definitely be making it again.

I make this at least four times a year. It's a real winner. The option of adding sweetened lemon at the end lets the cook determine how sweet you want it. Do remember to use a long skewer that will penetrate the bread to the bottom of the loaf. And do it when it is hot slowly letting the juice soak into the bread. I also add blueberries as a variation on the theme. It's a keeper!

I must have done something wrong because I just didn't think this turned out too well. I followed the recipie exactly with the exception of adding lemon juice. If you want a great lemon bread, the blueberry lemon bread is wonderful and works equally well with fresh and frozen blueberries.

Wonderful! Based on other reviewers recommendations, I increased the lemon zest in the batter to 3 tablespoons. I also added about 2 tablespoons of lemon juice to the batter. Baked it for 55 minutes. While it was still hot, I poked holes throughout the bread with a skewer and poured the lemon glaze over the top. I used powdered sugar with lemon juice to make the glaze rather than granulated sugar. The glaze soaked into the holes and made it super-moist. I wrapped it well in saran wrap and brought it to work the next day - still moist!

I added juice to the batter, and also 2 tsp of almond extract so the bread would still have a nice flavor even if the lemon wasn't strong enough. The edges where the glaze soaks in are sooo yummy.

I made this to satisfy the sweet teeth in my family so they'd stop dishing up the ice cream nightly--my husband and son loved this and said it was as moist on Thursday, when they finished it as on Saturday when I baked it. It's pretty to look at too--guest-worthy!

Made this twice - first time agreed with Sara - bread needed more lemon flavor. Second time I added 3 tablespoons of lemon juice to the batter. It was delicious.

I love this recipe...except would definitely add more grated lemon to the batter and possibly more lemon juice to the glaze. Otherwise it's simply delish...perfect with tea, breakfast or for dessert.

This was good, but I guess I had pretty high expectations. I would make it again but I'd add some lemon juice to the batter. I guess my glaze (which I did use all of) didn't soak in far enough so I thought it needed more lemon flavor.

I tried this recipe the from the magazine when it was printed at Christmas a couple of years ago, and have made it several times since then. I think it's better than most lemon breads or cakes I've bought when I didn't have time to make it myself. I like to add a couple of drops of yellow food coloring to give it a nice "lemony" look.

I give this recipe 4 forks because it is absolutely heavenly! After making the bread a few times, I decided to make muffins and they turned out equally delicious...sweet and lemony and very comforting! You don't need to use all of the glaze, unless you like it real sweet. I only used half.

I was surprised after all the great reviews but I thought this was too sugary sweet with the glaze -and I didn't even use all of it. I wanted more of a bread and this was more like a cake.

This was a really nice surprise. I have always liked lemony things, but often find that they're too sweet. This has a really nice balance and makes a great bread (more like a pound cake consistency) to have with tea or coffee. As for being too lemony, the nice thing about this is that you are completely in control of how lemony is. The actual tartness of the lemon doesn't come from the cake itself (I agree that a little lemon juice might be nice in the batter), but from the glaze. How lemony the cake is entirely depends on how much of the glaze you use. If you want it to be light, glaze lightly. This was a big hit at work, too, and SO easy to make. Five minutes and it was in the oven.

This is delicious, but it is definitely more cake-like than bread-like in my opinion.
