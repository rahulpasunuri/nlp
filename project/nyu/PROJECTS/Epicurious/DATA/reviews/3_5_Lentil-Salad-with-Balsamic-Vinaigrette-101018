This is SO easy and VERY good. I had to stop myself from just eating out of the bowl. I did serve it on fresh chopped up spinach and added diced carrot and radish for color and to up the veggies. I'll make a bit more dressing next time. It's amazing - especially if you are careful not to overcook the lentils.

This is a very good salad - hearty and refreshing at the same time. I've made it a few times exactly as written except that I didn't serve it in radicchio leaves. I give it 3 forks for taste, plus 1 because it's so easy and healthy.

This salad is amazing. It's so tangy and rich and savory I have to restrain myself from sticking my head in the bowl and eating it all at once. I didn't have any parsley except dried (which I put in the boiling water with the lentils) so I added some snipped dill to the final product and it is MARVELOUS. It's great with some chicken sausage on top, too.

Just made this today with canned lentils, and it tastes good, if a little harsh. I taste the vinegar and the mustard and the onion individually, rather than blended together. Am hoping the flavors will meld a bit while this chills. Next time (and I do think I'll make it again), will try with a bit less onion and maybe some diced red pepper or diced celery, or (as a previous poster suggested) some chopped cooked red potato--which I bet would work really well with the other flavors.

This is delicious as is, and is also a very nice base to work from. I particularly like it with shaved fennel and very, very thinly sliced radish (I also throw in some finely chopped fennel fronds). I really like the added crunch and colour and a little bit of bite. I really prefer it with green lentils (lentils de puy), however.

I made this exactly as written. I feel that you cannot give an accurate rating if you make alterations the first time around. My red onion was a bit overpowering and I am not a mustard fan.I liked the dish, however my daughter absolutely loved it! It made quick easy meals to go. Her college mates were oogling over it too. I will make it again and again to make her happy!

Always delicious (4th star for ease & healthfulness)! Like others, I cook the garlic, onion & herbs in with the vinegar; then for super ease, add to a package of prepared Trader Joe's lentils (in the produce section). I don't bother with lettuce cups - just add a handful of julienned radicchio & chopped avocado before serving for some bite and creaminess. Great picnic fare!

boo. I overcooked the lentils which made it way too mushy. not going to make this again.

This dish was good--not great. The parsley was a little overwhelming. I intend to try it again with cilantro instead of the parsley, and I have a feeling I will like it much more.

Why is this so delicious!?!?! It seems impossible that a dish this easy, cheap and nutritious could possibly taste so good. I didn't bother with radicchio leaves and just served myself a nice big plate for dinner.

This is excellent as a base for steamed spinach with a bit of garlic and topped off with slightly heated goat cheese.

So simple to make, very healthy, and outstanding accompanied by cucumber (as one reviewer recommended) and whole wheat chapppati on the side. I didn't have brown lentils so I used red ones (known as massur dal, available in Indian food stores). This also tastes good both hot and cold. I now double the recipe because it just goes way too fast otherwise...

Excellent and very easy. I've made this a few times, never with the radicchio. I do like the addition of cumcumber and sometimes diced, peeled tomato. Never had a problem with the dressing getting absorbed as one reviewer has.

This dish was easy and tasty. I added extra garlic and added some fresh chives for additional color. I also served it over sliced cucumbers and tomatoes. My guests LOVED it and asked for a doggie bag if I had extra leftovers.

i've made this dish several times, and love cold leftovers in the hot summertime. i usually cook all the onions with the lentils and just skip the radicchio. i liked the idea for crumbled feta and grilled portobello mushrooms on the side!

Lentils soaked up the dressing and left it bland. This coming from a person who likes plain lentils. I added more garlic and more oil and tossed in chopped red potato. This added some flavor.

Simple and good. It's a very easy way to add lentils to the diet. Cute but difficult to eat in the lettuce cups; a bed of baby spinach works well as a substitute.

I've made this several times. The first time I just used parseley, but now I use parseley and cilantro or just cilantro. I use my own taste for the vinaigrette so it's as vinegary as I want it. Lemon pepper and crushed mediteranean dried herb mix tastes good added to the vinaigrette, too. I've made this with brown, green, yellow and red lentils--it all tastes good!

Very good. I added an additional clove of garlic, and carmelized the onion in olive oil before serving. Very tasty and healthy. Will definitely make again

Made this and doubled the recipe so it would be a full meal size. Cooked the lentils with chopped onion and left them in when draining. Put in only a fraction of the parsley called for. Not a big parsley fan. And put on Escarole because the other was not available. A good and bitter lettuce that complemented well. This was a surprisingly great and hearty meal that was very healthy and I will definitely make it again.

This was absolutely fabulous, and easy to prepare. I reduced the amount of onion due to dietary constraints of my partner, and it was still fabulous.

Delicious!! I used french lentils and they were unseasoned, leftover lentils from a prior night's dinner. I chopped some green onion and parsley and added it to the lentils. I put it over baby lettuces. The family ate it all!!

Pretty good - I replaced the balsamic vinager with muscatel wine vinegar, and I think the combination worked very well.

really tasty. Can be modified by using canned lentils (approx.450g, undrained) which just need reheated. This makes it even easier and quicker and doesn't change the taste. A great lunch - nice cold too. Moray Hamilton, Scotland

So easy, healthy and tasty. We'll definitely make it again.

I thought this dish was excellent. Great as a salad or side dish, easily one of the best lentil recipes I've come across. Crumble a little feta or goat cheese on top and served aside a grilled portabella mushroom with some fresh baked bread and you've got an excellent vegetarian meal! I will definitely be making this one again!

I thought this recipe was good but not great. I will, however, probably make it again for myself because it is easy, nutritious, and contains ingredients I tend to have on hand.

I followed the recipe exactly and served this warm for lunch. My husband and I both really liked it and he made the comment that we should have this regularly. I used Compagnia Del Montale Nr 10 Balsamic vinegar and the dressing was delicious. Actually, I think the dressing is the best I've had.

Good, easy dish--has become an absolute staple of mine. I sometimes add bulgur wheat (tabouli) softened in water to bulk it up for lunch, or use scallions if out of red onion.

Very good and simple recipe. I added celery during the boiling of the lentils and chopped lots of fresh celery into the salad itself. This gave it a lot of crunch and freshness. Also, try adding 1/2 tsp of sugar to the balsamic vinaigrette.

This dish was just great. What a wonderful alternative to rice or potatoes with your meal. The balsamic gave it a very nice kick, a good idea to mince the red onion as opposed to a chop.

I served this dish with fish and WOW--what an alternative to rice. Absolutely delicious flavors combined in a healthy dish.

I followed the recipe exactly. It was yummy! I would use it as the main part of a summer meal. It is especially good warm.
