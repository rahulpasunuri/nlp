Used what I had on hand&leftovers of roasted chicken and I substituted eggplant for pepper. (think that was a good choice.) Also served with couscous to soak up the liquids. The flavors were good. Not over the moon but a good cold night/week night stew using things I already had on hand.

This was easy enough. I made a quick roux to thicken the broth. But I guess I expected the recipe to be greater than the sum of its parts. It wasn't. Kinda tastes like chicken noodle soup.

My guests loved this!! I served this on plates, so added a bit of Mexican Crema to thicken the sauce a bit. Next time, I will leave the Crema out, and use the suggestion to serve in bowls and use bread to mop up the broth.

I made one change that I really think saves this dish, I substituted mushrooms for the bell pepper. This really pulled together the sauce. Delicious.

Quick, light, easy, and full of flavor.

Not too bad but needs some work. I used garlic chicken broth and used alot more pancetta and garlic. I think it would be great without the chicken broth; instead cook the chicken first and toss with a white sauce.

This recipe sounded much better than it actually tasted. It was rather bland and soupy and wasn't worth the effort.

Watery, bland, and too much work for too little result.

Excellent! substituted broccoli for carrots. Use deep dish/plate and mop stock with bread!
