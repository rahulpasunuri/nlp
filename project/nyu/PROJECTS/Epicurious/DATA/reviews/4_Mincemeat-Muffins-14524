These are great! Even if you think you don't like mincemeat (I don't like raisins), try this recipe. Muffins are moist and delicious, even without the glaze. You might need to make these twice, to use the whole bottle of mincemeat.

So yummy! Made these in miniature for a Christmas Brunch and iced them with cream cheese frosting - very seasonal and delicious. Will absolutely make these every Christmas.

I wish there was a way to edit already placed reviews - again, I forgot to add that I also included 1 tsp of Penzey's Chinese Five Spice - the best out there (I think) and I add it to many of my baked goods and fruit dishes.

Forgot to add that I included 1 tablespoon of fresh orange zest and omitted glaze (no need for the extra sweetness).

Totally fab, made with apple cider and is awesome. However, it seems just a tad loose, so I am making another batch today and will add an extra tablespoon of flour. Highly recommend, and for some of you this would make a very good alternative for holiday fruitcake, bake in bundt pan. I haven't tried it, but imagine it would work just fine with slightly lower oven temp and longer cooking time.

No pecans, no apple, an entire jar of C&B mincemeat, orange juice instead of apple juice -- and my guinea pig taster friend said, "You bake a mean muffin! Yum!"

Yummy! A delicious way to use mincemeat all year round.

Wonderful! I did not peel the apple and eliminated the glaze. They froze beautifully.

These were a hit with all who tried them. Moist, rich flavour (though we used orange juice instead of apple). A great way to get rid of the extra mincemeat from Christmas!

These muffins are super good! I substituted orange juice for the apple juice and used Splenda instead of the granulated sugar. I'll be making these again soon!

Everyone at work thought these muffins where great. I have also subtituted the mincemeat for Orange marmalade and the Apple for cranberries making a tangy alternative!

Very moist and full of great flavour. I had no pecans so did without. used orange juice instead of apple juice.

Fabulous! Excellent appearance, flavor, texture. Everyone in the family raved. Substitutions (due to lack of specified ingredients) included orange juice, allspice and walnuts.

These muffins are easy to make, and always come out perfect in taste and texture. Walnuts can be substituted for the pecans.

I made these muffins twice, they are light and delicious. The topping with sugar and cinnamon became a bit grainy, I would have liked to avoid that. Otherwise, the taste is perfect.

I made these again yesterday, and I am always pleased with how well they turned out. I didn't put the pecans in, and realized at the last minute that I had no apples, so I used a large jar of mincemeat for the recipe. The muffins were lovely and moist!

A very nice "substantial" muffin with a great flavour. Lovely for breakfast.
