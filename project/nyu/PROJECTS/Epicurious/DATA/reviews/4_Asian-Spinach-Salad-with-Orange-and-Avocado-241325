Really amazing! Like some previous reviewers I added some toasted almonds a a tsp or so of honey, and couldn't believe how such a small amount of dressing was going to work. But guests raved about it. Kept to just one avocado but used 2 oranges. Fabulous.

This was a surprise! I was concerned at the amount of vinegar (didn't have rice, used white wine vinegar)- it was very tart. Added more oil- used olive oil. Toasted some slivered almonds. Put it together and WOW! It was incredible how the sweet oranges tempered the vinegrette. All of my family loved it ++ Used more sesame oil as well. This is a keeper! Served it with a modified Thanksgiving dinner- roast pork, stuffing, brussel sprouts. instead of Turkey.Yummm....

I made this with clementine slices instead of orange, since I thought that might be a more "Asian" flavor (and would work better in a salad). That said, one caveat I cannot emphasize enough: do NOT make this ahead of time (I clearly don't have enough experience using spinach in salad). The entire thing was a wilted mess by the time I served it (hour later, maybe), and I added more fresh spinach to lift it a little. The second thing is: I made 2.5 times the recipe, but for the dressing I added significantly more sesame oil than it called for (when I was tasting for "salt and pepper"); otherwise, every drop ended with too tart a bite (I just kept pouring in sesame oil about a tbsp at a time and kept tasting). Overall, not great texture (unless eaten right after making), good flavor, but b/c I added more sesame oil than it stated.

Light, simple, delicious. I thought 6oz of spinach was a bit much for just one avocado and one orange, so I cut up two of each. The dressing was superb. High quality sesame oil really makes this dish.

Made two small changes to the salad - added just a few drops on honey to the dressing, to balance the sweet and sour a little better. I also added an asian microgreen mix to the spinach for a little more added depth. My boyfriend loved the salad and between the two of us, we finished everything. Made with the Miso Chicken recipe, which paired well.

This salad was terrible. The dressing was bland and the avocado and orange made the texture mushy. I am a salad lover and there are too many good ones out there to bother with this one again.

This was only OK even with upping the toasted sesame oil to 1/2 tsp and adding toasted pine nuts. Maybe I should have added some grainy mustard as another reviewer suggested.

I've made this salad several times and, I love, love, love it! I did up the amount of sesame oil to 1/2 teaspoon.

I made the dressing, and it tasted a bit bitter/sour for me -- maybe I just made it wrong -- but I added a bit more veg oil and added a teaspoon or two of whole grain mustard and a squeeze of lemon. It did the trick for me. I used clementines (sweet and easy to peel), and I agree that the orange element is key to balance the flavor.

Very awesome salad. I made this true to the recipe 2-3 weeks ago and I'm craving it again already. I added left-over chicken, but actually enjoyed it more without. The chicken made it less refreshing. The only protein I would add in the future would be either toasted almonds or tofu. Fantastic flavor combination!

This is a very refreshing salad. I did not have a navel orange so I substituted with Mandarin oranges. I used a Hass avocado - since the others were not handy. This is a MUST try.

A nice, basic salad...the oranges were a good addition. I generally judge salads by the dressing as anyone can adjust the actual salad ingredients. The dressing was good...very good...but, not great or amazing.

I was really skeptical about this recipe but I love ginger and avocado's so I thought I'd give it a whirl: one of the BEST salads I've made in a long time. I didn't have fresh ginger so I used ground, added a little extra rice vinegar, used a mandarin and navel orange and a whole avocado. I also added chicken (sauteed in soy and sweet red chili sauce) which added a nice kick. I also upped the vege oil a bit and cut a tiny bit on the shallots. It's a keeper!!! quick and easy for a foodies stomach!

Rating: 4
Whoa - this salad's flavors far exceeded expectations. The dressing had zip and the avocados and orange were wonderful additions. I went with a generous tablespoon on the ginger (which I microplaned) and tossed some toasted almond slices on top. I'm going to try a more even split between the vegetable and sesame oils next time. I made this for a quick weeknight dinner but it could easily be a dish for company.

nice flavor, but i didn't really like the mix of textures. mushy with crispy with chewy. should have grated the ginger more finely.

This is great served with seared tuna with a wasabi mayo. I added a pinch more sesame oil, and added toasted seasme seeds, white and black. Med Ripe avacados are best. The one I had was a bit on the unripe side, but the salad was still a hit.

We absolutely loved this salad. I also substituted sliced green onions for the shallots, and use minced pickled ginger (non-dyed sushi ginger) instead of the fresh. I think the pickled ginger is a lot milder than fresh, so 2 tsp wasn't too strong at all. The flavors were fresh and delicate.

The flavor combinations of this salad, and dressing are great! Bought baby micro spinach, haas avocados, and oranges from my local farmers market, and prepared this salad that night for 10. I tripled the dressing recipe and increased the avocado, and oranges as well. I substituted minced white scallion for the shallots, and a few tablespoons more of vegetable oil. The dressing is quite potent so take care not to overdress the greens. My personal addition was to sprinkle salted hulled sunflower seeds on top for textural interest.

This was great expect that I only had on hand an unseasoned rice vinegar which may have contributed to a bit of a bland sauce. I also used green onions instead of shallots (also because that's what I had on hand). I would like to try this again and use the specific ingredients called for and see how much of a difference it makes. Oh and next time I'll use more orange - love it with the avocado!

I divided the recipe in half to make 2 servings, except I used 3-1/2 oz. of spinach. Also, I didn't have shallots so I used 3 green onions, thinly sliced. Used a whole orange and a whole avocado (for 2 servings) because I didn't have any plans for the leftovers. This is now my favorite spinach and orange salad recipe!!! (And I have quite a few others.) This was DELICIOUS.

My husband and son (10)just devoured this salad even before they touched their steak (which was also very good!). Used home- grown California oranges and avocado. The only change I made was to use only toasted sesame oil because of the flavor factor (imo veg. oil adds calories and no flavor). Making it again tomorrow night with grilled shrimp.

I can't say enough about this recipe. It's about as simple as you can find, and comes out wonderfully. The blends of citrus from the orange, creaminess from the avocado (I used a regular old Hass) and the spicy bite of the ginger and shallots balance each other out in flavor and texture. My dinner date and I ate the entire salad even though it's supposed to serve four. I'll be making this many more times. Perfect.

Made this tonight and really liked it, but I doubled the amount of toasted sesame oil from the start since the 1/4 tsp. was barely discernable. Also, I agree with the previous reviewer's kids that the shallot flavour was too pronounced. I ended up having to double all the other ingredients to get a vinaigrette I liked. Other than having to play with proportions, the flavours were really great and it took little time to prepare.

Fresh, colorful and tasty. A beautiful variation for a spinach salad. The oranges & avocado definetly make the salad complete.

I thought this was a delicious mix of flavors. But I am inclined to think it could use a touch less scallion and ginger. Though I love them, it is not easy to spread the dressing evenly through the salad, and sometimes they overwhelm a bit where they clumped on the spinach leaves.
