A bit odd, got comments of "well this is interesting!" and my daughter had two bites and left the rest. The balsamic reduction perhaps needs to be made with better balsamic than what I had available (nothing fancy). The ricotta and pastry parts were both very satisfactory. If I made this again, I would make a fig compote, perhaps with red wine, instead of sliced figs, and the compote would be the sauce instead of the balsamic.

I am so surprised to be the first one reviewing this recipe. It was fantastic and pretty simple too. You can make the phyllo pieces earlier in the day and then it is a snap to assemble! Don't cut out on making the sauce...the balsamic reduction is great and all the flavors together make for a very light, sweet and refreshing dessert.
