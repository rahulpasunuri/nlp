The flavors of this recipe are good. It suits a week-night meal. However, the times given to cook the chicken are not nearly long enough. I even sliced the breasts lengthwise to make thin cutlets and they were still not done when given only the 10 minutes cooking time declared by the recipe.

It was salty. You do not need that much grated pecorino and if you use pecorino you do not need to salt the chicken. It was easy and cheap but not sure I'd make it again. Mushroom salad was OK.

Quick, easy, and delicious. My husband said "Wow!" when he tasted the mushrooms. I cut back the lemon juice to 3 Tbsp based on other reviews and added halved cherry tomatoes to the salad; served with grilled asparagus.

Delicious as is--not to mention extremely easy and cheap! My husband raved about the mushroom salad. Will add this to the rotation for sure.

Easy fast ant delicious. I would use less lemon next time but the recipe is right on.

Super easy. Super fast. Delicious. The only change I made is I used truffle flavored olive oil and omitted the parsley as I didn't have any.

Solid dish. Super easy weeknight meal. I was skeptical about the raw mushroom salad but it turned out to be quite good. I did find it a little too lemon-heavy, but I also didn't put in nearly as much parsley as the recipe calls for, so perhaps I can't speak to that.
