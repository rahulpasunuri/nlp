This is good. This is a regular dish at our house and a good way to get my boys to eat their veggies. I use the Soy Vey Teriyaki sauce to make this a super quick tasty weeknight dinner. I usally add mushrooms and snow peas to this dish as well.

A great way to serve salmon, quick and easy to make. I opted to grill it in the oven for about 10 minutes. Finished it with drops of good quality sesame oil to make it extra fragrant and garnished with freshly toasted sesame seeds. Served it with miso soup for a complete meal.

It was good - not any great shakes though.

I've been making this teriyaki sauce for years. It has a light and delicate flavor unlike the thick syrupy ones you get in restaurants. It's great on grilled chicken and fish, too. I'm a personal chef and my clients love it.

I broiled the fish with sesame seeds and it was delicious indeed - the whole family devoured it

This turned out really tasty, even without all the ingredients on the list (did not have ginger, half of the soy sauce, half of the sugar (brown) and sherry instead of mirin). My hubby generally says he is bored of salmon, but this he loved! I served it on a bed of spinach sauteed with slices from half of the onion in the recipe and a drizzle of olive oil; layered with the carrot & other half onion as per recipe and crowned with the delicious and juicy salmon...Important not to overcook the salmon as other reviewers have already pointed out. Enjoy!

Nice and easy basic recipe from the pantry. I skipped the carrots and onions since I was just making for me. Instead I added extra green onions to the sauce and served with steamed broccoli.

Not great, but okay. There are better teriyaki recipes and better salmon recipes out there. I'm going to keep looking.

I made this again last night for the first time in years and it did not disappoint. It's a teeny bit fussy with the blanching and ice water baths but overall worth it. The result if definitely restaurant quality and you'll say, "wow - I can't believe that I made it myself!".

I just finished devouring this. I had to make a few substitutions based on what I had on hand, just things other users have cited. It was FANTASTIC. I got a particularly fatty cut of salmon which made it that much more succulent. Really lovely.

I have only made the teriyaki sauce, and I love it. It is very easy, and lets me control the sodium level. I use low sodium temari (wheat free), sherry and cider vinegar. I love it.

Simple, yet elegant, we have been using this recipe for over 10 years now and love it. Although good when prepared in the oven, this dish really shines when done in a super-hot cast iron pan. I have used both chinese rice vinegar and cider vinegar--it doesn't matter which is used. This dish is particularly good with brown rice.

What an interesting change from my usual salmon recipes. Moist, flavorful and very little work. Had no mirin so used sherry, also subbed rice wine vinegar.

I used the marinade only, bbq on a cedar plank. The salmon was very flavourful and moist. We will use this again.

Not that great There are other salmon recipes,like the one with pure maple syrup and soy sauce that are both easier and tastier. Not that this is a tough recipe, but it just didn't add up to much.

This dish was so delicious!! the sauce smells divine while you're cooking it and it tastes just as good as it smells. My one suggestion is make sure you cook the carrots enough, mine came out a bit hard.

I made this recipe when my mother-in-law came to visit. I really enjoyed it. My husband enjoyed the recipe, but prefered Ming Tsai's recipe for Teriaki Salmon. I'm going to combine the two recipes tonight with wild salmon. Ming Tsai's recipe for Teriyaki for two servings is as followings: 1/2 cup low sodium dark soy sauce juice and zest of one orange 1.5 TBS brown sugar 2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely minced 1/2TBS finely minced ginger Bring it all to a boil over high heat, and simmer slowly until reduced by half, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in 1/2 TBS sesame seeds, and cool. Transfer to a baking dish, add the salmon, turn to coat, and marinate for one hour. I'll then blanch the vegetables, and continue on with this recipe. I'm hopeful my husband (and I) will think that this is the absolute best recipe for salmon.

To save even more time I julienned the veg (carrots, taro and cabbage) a placed it with salmon 'en papillote' in the oven @400 for about 20 min (that way I could get on with other things). My husband love the dish. I found it slightly salty, but still enjoyed it. I usually use Tamari Shoyu but this time used cheap soy sauce - no doubt tha made a difference.

Great way to get kids to eat their omega-3's! This was a very simple and very flavorful recipe. I did make a few ajustments to the cooking technique. I kept the salmon as one whole piece and marinated it for about an hour in an oven proof baking dish. I then slid the dish into a 375 oven for about 12 minutes. The sauce formed a nice glaze over the fish. Very good! Make sure to bone the fish before eating it.

Great change to a usual salmon taste, very interesting recipe! My husband liked it a lot but would have liked a bit more salty dish. It really turned out to be a bit sweet as I used partly some Indonesian soya (sweet one). Next time I will use just ordinary soya. The marinating time was 20 minutes and it was really tasty! Also the vegtables in that sauce were excactly the right addings to the fish! Plus fresh potatoes! Great! And the dish can be prepared quickly even if the guests are arround, you just prepare the marinate and vegetables few hours earlier.

This recipe got rave reviews from my family, even from fairly picky seafood eaters. Next time I will use salmon fillets - too many bones. Followed the excellent advice of grilling and then keeping in the oven at 200 for 8 minutes or so while asparagus cooked. Carrots and onions a lovely complement. I mounded the fish and vegetables atop some garlic mashed potatoes and then poured the sauce over.Clean plates all around!

My husband who caught this salmon at Seward, Alaska this summer said this was the best recipe I'v done for wild salmon. I changed NOTHING in the recipe, except I used sherry since I had it. I grilled the salmon in a little oil in my ridged cast iron pan, since it is winter now, andpan fried not too long.Remember salmon settles in it's juices when you take it out of the pan. So don't overcook. Perfection Don't change a thing!

The sauce is really great - I used brown sugar and grilled the salmon instead of sauteeing it. The first time I sauteed the salmon and found the sauce burned easily - probably becuase of the sugar.

I confess I didn't make the whole recipe. I was in the middle of making teriyaki chicken burgers with ginger mayonnaise when I realized I didn't have any teriyaki sauce. I quickly made this sauce and it worked really well. I reduced the sauce to 1/2 cup and while it was still warm I added four teaspoons of honey (per the chicken burger recipe) and I couldn't believe how good it was! I may never buy teriyaki sauce again!

We were in a bit of a rush, so I left out the veggies & only marinated the fish for 5 minutes (I also didn't cook the sauce beforehand). I used dry sherry since we didn't have any mirin & barbequed the fish instead of sauteing. Post-grill, I basted the salmon liberally with the sauce & left it in a 200 degree oven for about 8 minutes while the asparagus was grilling. This was a phenomenal sauce!

We are lucky to live on the West Coast and fish for King salmon in the summer and fall. By spring, the salmon (vacuum-bagged in the freezer) has lost some of its pizzazz. This recipe was perfect for it. By not over-cooking it and drizzling the sauce and veggies over the top (served on a bed of basmati rice) this recipe is a real winner.

This is a little different from my usual teriyaki recipe which doesn't call for any vinegar; I liked the sweet and sour flavor this version has. It worked well with about half the sugar the recipe calls for, however, and after I'd carelessly added the full amount of soy I tasted the sauce and decided to add more vinegar and some sake to offset the saltiness somewhat. A really nice-looking dish, too; it was a shame to cover up the salmon since it came out looking so great. One family member commented that it would probably be good with tuna as well.
