So fabulous. The lemon to blueberry ratio, I thought, was perfect. Our dinner guest loved the blueberry sauce I served over lemon ice cream. Warming the leftovers for pancakes now!

I made this today to go with a lemon ricotta cake and it was fantastic. I used about a cup more blueberries than the recipe called for, but other than that, I followed the recipe as written. I have leftovers, and I'm sure they will be delicious with some vanilla icecream.

Excellent recipe! I chose it over all the others because of their negative reviews and this one worked perfectly. (hurrah for reviews!) I also reduced the sugar to 4 Tbls, but otherwise didn't change a thing and it turned out great. Served it over pound cake. Would also be great on pancakes or french toast.

Great, fresh flavor with the combo of berries and lemon juice. I wanted a smooth sauce, so I boiled all the berries in the sugar/starch/water combo. Once boiled slightly, I put the whole mix in the blender until it was smooth. Strained the sauce through a fine seive and simmered on low it until it reduced more (about 20 minutes). Was a big hit with vanilla ice cream and angel food cake.

Oh My!! Made a couple of changes for a sauce to put on limoncello flavoured panna cotta. Substituted limoncello for the lemon juice and waited until the sauce had cooled before adding the second batch of berries so they wouldn't cook. We all raved. (4 forks for me means that my eyes have rolled back in my head with ecstacy)

This is a good sauce. I let it sit in saucepan covered on top with plastic wrap to keep film from forming for later use atop store- bought angel food cake with strawberry ice cream. Not real pretty however.

Very tasty- the lemon is a perfect complement to the blueberries. I only used 4 Tbsp sugar and I thought it was plenty sweet. I served it over pancakes and it was delicious.

Like another reviewer, I spooned this over broiled peaches and vanilla ice cream. The warm blueberries burst with flavor. The perfect August desert.

I really enjoyed this sauce. I especially liked that some of the berries remain whole. Delish on ice cream.
