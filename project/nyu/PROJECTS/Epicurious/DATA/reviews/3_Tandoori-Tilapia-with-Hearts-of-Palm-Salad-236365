I really enjoyed this recipe. I followed prior advice and doubled everything in the marinade except the yogurt. I also didn't grind the ginger into a paste. I ended up putting the tilapia in the marinade and then in a casserole dish in the fridge for 3 hours. I let the dish warm for about 30 minutes then put the whole thing in the oven at 375 for 20 minutes. Turned out perfect and I liked keeping the marinade as a sauce. Also, less clean up! Salad was quick, light, and refreshing. Will definitely make again.

My wife and I thought that this was delicious. Very much spa food: healthy, light, and very satisfying. I'm not sure that I would choose this to entertain because it is over and done with very quickly. This isn't a meal to sit and enjoy for hours with friends. Just the fish and a light salad, but at the end of the day (most days) do you really need/want more? Great flavors and didn't really require a ton of preparation: the mango was difficult to peel/dice but everything else went together very quickly.

This was great - go ahead and double the spices, and marinate longer (I marinated for 3 hours.) I couldn't grill due to weather, but did on my grill pan, careful not to overcook. It was great! Don't look for knock-you-for-a- loop flavors, but for a lovely more subtle taste. I kind ofthought of tilapia as a little boring 'til I made it this way! mango salad os good too - but does anyone else question the proportions (I've never heard of a 3- oz can of hearts of palm, and used most of the hearts i na 14 oz. can...)

I could take or leave the fish, or even make it into chicken, but the salad is one of the best accompaniments I've ever had! I add just a touch of olive oil for some added creaminess, and a bit of salt to blend the flavours. I also think poppy seeds would be an interesting addition...

Enjoyed this very much. I marinated the fish for several hours and baked it instead of grilling. The hearts of palm salad was very refreshing.

My husband loves this, but I am not a fan. Although he made it, I still thought it entailed more effort that the end result merited.

This is really good and almost too easy. I think it would have tasted better if more tandoori seasoning was evident in the fish (I marnitated for 2 hrs, nxt time I'll try longer marinade or adding double spices to yogurt). Any suggestions on what else to serve with this to round out the meal? Seems like a lot of other sides would over power these delicate flavors

I'd have given it 2 forks, but my hubby, who HATES fish, ate it happily and took leftovers for lunch the next day...which lead to a discovery that made me up my rating to 3 forks. If you marinate both the tilapia in the tandoori, and the palm salad ingredients, longer than the recommended, the flavors deepen and blend. Definitely better the second day, so next time, I'll marinate longer! Also, make sure you get a really RIPE mango...that flavor with the fish is intoxicating.

Wonderful! We have been a bit stuck on the Tilapia with Chile Lime Butter -- always a good bet, but it's nice to have something different. The flavor was great, and the dish is so quick to prepare. Though I usually saute tilapia, this time I baked it (in keeping with the tandoor idea) and it was moist and delicious.

Very good - the tandoori-based marinade really enhances the fish (found really good fresh tilapia at local fish market)while keeping it moist and tasty. The salad was lovely and would be good accompagniment to other light fish. Will definitely make recipe again soon.
