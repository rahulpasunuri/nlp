Yes. A thousand times yes. This was extremely easy to make and was a HUGE crowd pleaser! I used an 11.5 lb roast and still had extra stuffing which I just put in the oven with a couple tablespoons of butter on top for about a 1/2 hour. Seriously, looking for a delicious, impressive, and easy main? This is it.

I made this for Christmas dinner today...so good! First time I made a rib-eye roast so I was pretty excited and this definitely met, if not exceeded, my expectations. We bought a 10 lb roast with four bones and I was pretty surprised when the thermometer read 150 at the two hour mark...I pulled the roast out and let it set for 20 mins... It was a perfect "medium" doneness (which is what we wanted). Our guests raved! I did have a bit of extra stuffing. Will absolutely make this again!!

I followed the recipe exactly, no alterations. It was simply fabuous and one of the best dinner party entrees I've ever served. I would make it again in a heartbeat! It is a keeper!

Made this for Christmas dinner, and was surprised at how easy it was--for such an elegant/elaborate/fahncy meal, I thought it would require more prep. Agree with Lovestoputter that there was more than enough stuffing to bake some separately. We had one lactose-intolerant guest, and so I omitted the creme fraiche/sour cream from the stuffing, and it was still delicious. That also seemed to eliminate any need to let the stuffing "settle" for an hour on a baking sheet--without the extra moisture the stuffing held together beautifully when first mixed.

This was delicious. I made it for Christmas dinner and it was a hit. The stuffing was fantastic. I forgot the eggs and only put 1/2 the bread crumbs in. the stuffing was a perfect.

I had bought a prime rib roast, which I had the butcher trim for easy slicing. (Basically slice the prime rib alomost off of the ribs, and then tie it back on. I used the stuffing between the ribs and the meat, and baked. (I did put the bacon back in the stuffing before stuffing.) Made tons of the stuffing, but baked it in a casserole along side. Rave reviews and people asked to take home the leftovers.

I had never made a standing rib roast and was a bit nervous about ruining an expensive indulgence. No worries; this was terrific. The recipe makes far more stuffing than will fit into the cavity of the roast, so bake the extra in a separate dish about an hour before serving time and brush with the pan drippings. There is no need to rub olive oil on the roast due to its ample fat content. I removed it at 120 degrees, but it continued to rise considerably as it rested, and I ended up with a medium, rather than medium-rare roast. Next time I'll remove it sooner, but the flavor was excellent even if it wasn't my preferred pinker hue. The stuffing flavors are even better the next day.

I served this roast for my annual friends dinner and received rave reviews. Everyone agreed that it was the best ever! It is time consuming to make, but well worth the effort. The only tip I would add is to have your butcher prepare the roast for the stuffing. After hearing the reviews from my guests, I will definitely be making this again.

You forgot to add back the bacon into the stuffing receipe.
