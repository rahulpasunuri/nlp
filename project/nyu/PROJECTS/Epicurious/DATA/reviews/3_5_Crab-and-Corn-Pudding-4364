I make this every holiday -- Christmas and Thanksgiving!. I too thought the recipe as written was too bland. Since I prefer my food spicy I added a couple of dashes of hot sauce, some garlic powder (to taste) and a little nutmeg. The garlic brings out the flavor really well.

My family does a crab feed every Christmas Eve. A few years ago I made this recipe with the leftovers the next day. It has become such a family favorite that I make it every Christmas now. I roast and peel the poblano peppers for this dish.

While I did throw in a 1/4 cup of finely chopped red pepper with the other sauteed vegetables, I otherwise resisted the temptation to add the standard seasonings I put in crabcakes (e.g., Worchestershire, dry mustard, and a shot of Tabasco). It was the right choice -- the recipe "as is" was great! The crab flavor definitely dominates - but if you use good crabmeat, that's a good thing. The tops browned (and puffed) nicely with the sprinkling of good quality Parmesan cheese, and the puddings were firm but not dry, and moist but not runny. The "batter" had rested for a few hours in my fridge before baking, and the texture was still great. It's a perfect first course dish to make ahead and pop in the oven. Your guests will rave!

It sounded so wonderful! Afraid the crab(TJ's canned/chilled) overpowered the corn(frozen kernels). We had it with ham as the entree but the flavors clashed unpleasantly.

I made this dish last Thanksgiving and it was a hit. I don't have a food processor, so I used a blender and baked it in a large Corning ware dish. I tasted it before baking and it was sort of bland, so I punched it up by adding a little garlic powder and some hot sauce. Perfect.

So very good. Everyone loved this. I've been conscripted to bring this dish to two other holiday dinners. We used fresh crab from Chinatown. At least two cups. And I used canned corn.

This was incredible. It's become a new Thanksgiving tradition at our house. My mom is even having me make it for Christmas brunch. I substituted live lobster as my local market was out of live crabs.

Made it for Thanksgiving feast. Was one of the least favorite dishes; lots of it left. Won't do this one again.

I increased the recipe, baked in a casserole, without waterbath, added extra cheese to top and it looked great. Puffed up, perfect consistency, nice and golden on top, and everyone liked it. Everyone except me. I traditionally make a seafood gratin for the holidays, but mistakenly decided to try something different. It didn't have enough flavor, even with the chilis, and the corn seemed to overwhelm the crab. Even though I frequently make corn pudding, this combination is one that I didn't enjoy.

I'm not typically a recipe trasher, and I hate to go against public opinion, but this just didn't do it for me.I was expecting ectasy, but it didn't happen. It looked and smelled really good, but it seemed a little bland. Maybe if I had added more salt than the recipe called for, it could have been better. If I make this again, I'll definitely add Tony Chachere's Cajun Seasoning, as it makes even a fabulous dish SUPERB.

Made this last Thanksgiving and Christmas and will do the same this year. Big Hit! First time I followed recipe exactly. Second time, I used a blender (processor broke) and drained sweet white canned corn, put into a souffle dish and baked 5 minutes longer using same instructions. A FAMILY FAVORITE!

Made this first in 97, this has become a Thanksgiving tradition ever since and there's never a morsel left. I served it in old 1950's Fire King coffee cups. Our friends loved it with the chili and no changes.

i have made this recipe for three years now and it is always a big hit. I can't get away with NOT making it at Thanksgiving and Christmas time. We live in the MD area, so I use blue crab. Also, I cook it in a large casserole dish and it comes out great everytime.

This was a second course at my Christmas dinner and it was a hit. The dungenous crab was expensive, but well worth it! Easy to make this in advance and keep it in the refrigerator until an hour before serving!!

Beautiful presentation. I prepared and served the pudding in 1-1/2 cup ramekins and placed them on the dinner table between two people for sharing. Not a morsel left! Elegant and delicious, though a bit rich.

I really liked the added crab flavor in this corn pudding recipe. I substituted heavy cream for the half and half, used leeks instead of shallots, did not puree the corn and did NOT add the chili's. The recipe does not say to add the flour when you saute the leeks, but that is when I added the flour. Excellent flavor and very easy to prepare. It was a Delicious addition to our Thanksgiving meal!
