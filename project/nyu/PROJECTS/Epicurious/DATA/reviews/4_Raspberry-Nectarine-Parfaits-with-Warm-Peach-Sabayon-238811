I guess I just didn't see what was special about this. It wasn't bad but I would not make it again because it was kind of boring.

There are a thousand little ways you could alter this recipe... but why bother? Excellent as a dessert for a summer dinner party, received many compliments from guests. Use fresh fruit from a farm stand, not grocery store stuff, if you can!

Made this for a summer dinner party dessert and it was divine. I added a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream to the bottom of the glass then added the ingredients, but it was not nessessary. Perfect as is. The sabayon is to die for. Nectarines were firm but flavorful, so I just sliced them very thin and it worked perfectly, I also tossed a few blueberries on top along with the raspberries and almonds for garnish.
