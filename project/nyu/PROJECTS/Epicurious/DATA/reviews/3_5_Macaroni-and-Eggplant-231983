Disclaimer: Rating this recipe 4 forks for concept/gateway to a great supper. Since reviewers get picked apart for rating and making lots of changes I rated for the basic idea. Reading the description it was described more as a home-style dish, therefore I felt free to use what I had on hand. Baked the eggplant w/a light brush of olive oil, and Italian seasoning. Added two andouille sausages to the onion and garlic mix. Used frozen roasted tomato sauce from the summer harvest. The assembly seemed a little too complicated for a weeknight so I layered the eggplant on the bottom of a 13x9 dish, then angel hair pasta and topped with the tomoato mixture and baked at 350 for about 40 minutes. The flavors blended and I was able to use up what I had on hand. It was delicious. My basil frosted this week so I did without but that would really top it off nicely. Good and easy meal for a weeknight.

I made this last night and everyone loved it! I also broiled the eggplant slices instead of frying them and it was delicious. Very easy and tasted great.

The tomato sauce is a bit bland. I would add at least black pepper and feta cheese with basil.

This recipe is an overly gentrified version of an authentic Sicilian family dish. Simple family fare is neither wasteful, not fussy (regardless of the ethnic group you are stereotyping). No Sicilian would cook anything in 2 cups of olive oil unecessarily. The previous reviewer is correct re Italian food's unfair unhealthy rep. The eggplant could have easily been brushed with olive oil and baked, saving time and mess not to mention precious EVOO. Also, today's eggplants do not require salting and draining. When purchased and used fresh, there is no bitterness problem. However, we went ahead as per the recipe and salted and drained. But we did rinse the eggplant before patting dry. The recipe recommended simply SQUEEZING IT?? Wouldn't that have left all the salt on and destroyed the softened slices?? Even after our rinsing step, two diners complained that the eggplant in the final dish was too salty AND too soft, its eggplant character lost. The sauce was excellent, but again a true Sicilian would mix some fresh basil into the sauce, but would save most of that fragrant element for final presentation. In conclusion, we really liked the looks and potential deliciousness of this dish, but would do it our way next time, i.e. bake eggplant don't fry it, skip salting eggplant, and basil at the end. Try it this way.

Great flavour,lovely (if labour-intensive) presentation. I just wish recipes like this didn't automatically call for frying the eggplant - it's not always necessary and even Italian cooks (such as myself) are becoming health-conscious. It's details like this that give Italian food an unhealthy reputation.
