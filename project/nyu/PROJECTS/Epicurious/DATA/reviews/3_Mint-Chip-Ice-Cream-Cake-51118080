This is a great classic ice cream cake recipe. I made it for my 4 year-old's birthday party. The cake part turned out perfectly - nice and spongey and not too egg-y in flavor. Very nice. Tasted like the cake part of a twinkie and did not get too dense with freezing. I do have a question for anyone out there: I could not get the dissolved gelatin mixture to incorporate into the whipped cream. It immediately hardened upon touching the cool cream, so I actually had hard stringy pieces of gelatin in my whipped cream topping! Yikes! Next time I'd skip the gelatin unless I figure out how to incorporate gelatin.
