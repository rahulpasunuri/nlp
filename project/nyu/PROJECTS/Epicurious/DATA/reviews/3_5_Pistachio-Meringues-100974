Delicious! Baked for an hour at 100C and still had a slightly soft centre. Drizzled dark chocolate over the top for added sweetness. Will definitely make these again!

This recipe worked well for me, I processed the nuts and powdered sugar in the food processor until finely ground, and after the oven timer went off, just turned off the oven, and left them in for a few hours to get nice and dry (it's hard to make meringues in humid Seattle!) I used them as the base for a pavlova with cardamom cream and peaches. Very good!

I ended up having to bake these for about an hour instead of only 45 minutes, it might have been slightly longer until they were completely dried out. They were very tasty though. My whole family loved them!

I piped out the meringue into cirlcles and baked them a little longer until they were dried out. I topped them with vanilla icecream and berries and it was delicious.
