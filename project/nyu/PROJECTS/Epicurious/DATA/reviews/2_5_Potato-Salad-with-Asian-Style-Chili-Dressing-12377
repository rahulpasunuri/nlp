i have to give this one a good review. but it needs some changes: Use rice wine vinegar instead of regular Omit the mint, instead add cilantro and thai basil Omit the anchovy past I used pickled jalepnos, but I'm sure fresh would have been fine And I added a few carrots to the potatoes when I boiled, so I had a few carrot pieces in Honestly this was was supper good I served it with a side of sweet chili glazed salmon

Jody, order up a room for 2 at the insane asylum! These flavors work beautifully together and I loved this! The chili-mint combo is essential. Easy and delicious; 3+ forks! KIMBER

Like the first reviewer, I followed the recipe exactly. My husband and I thought that it was disgusting! The chili-mint combination was too much.
