I sped-read this recipe before shopping so instead of tossing in half a pound of beef, I added half a kilo (how come America hasn't embraced the metric system?). It was nevertheless a success. My son refused point blank to eat it because it "looked disgusting" but lowered his standards to take a bite and enjoyed his meal. I caught my husband sipping the remnants from the sauce bowl when he was doing the dishes. I loved it and would make it again, with another half a kilo of beef.

I was missing a lot of the ingredients the recipe called for, so I had to wing it big time. But it still turned out delicious! I used lemon instead of lime, chicken instead of beef, Sriracha instead of the Thai chiles, and was out of fish sauce so had to leave that out. I added half of a red onion sliced thin, and a few bunches of baby bok choy that needed to get cooked before they died. Even with this totally bastardized version of the recipe, it turned out great. I will definitely make this again. And I'll always think of stirfrying when I have too much mint lying around from now on. Yum.

Truly delicious! This is a great basic recipe which I made the exactly as written the first time and agree with previous reviewers that a few tweaks are necessary for awesomeness. My revisions: salt the eggplant for 20 min to rid of excess water; double the sauce; replace the mint with green onions; love the thai chiles but still add sriracha at the table. Super flavorful, simple dish.

I made this with top sirloin, serranos instead of thai chiles, cilantro instead of mint. It was very good, but I used 4 minced serranos, twice the garlic and ginger, and added green onions to up the spice level. Also, as written this will only feed two hungry people. I will make it again.

Delicious! For those of you complaining that there wasn't enough heat,just mince the peppers and ginger instead of slicing; that'll definitely crank up the heat. Super easy and tasty. Addition of cilantro and Thai basil would also be good.

Loved this with more chilies, and cilantro instead of mint. Also, I used less "frying" oil than called for by the recipe (I first steamed the eggplant before frying a few minutes). Great flavor, even with my soggy eggplant pieces!

This was just okay. The sauce had less heat than I like. Also, it was nigh on impossible to cook the sliced beef so that it came out medium rare. It was overdone moments after it hit the pan. If I do this again (doubtful) I'd cook the meat on the grill and then slice before serving. I'd also add some red pepper flakes to the sauce.

I used a Sirloin Tip steak & rice noodles. This was a decent stir-fry for the time & ingredients required. I would prefer a more infused fish sauce flavor rather than it pouncing out at you, but this was acceptable for a "fast, easy, fresh" recipe. Definitely pair this with a Grenache to match the bold flavors in the dish.

It was delicious. Relatively easy to make. I did use more of a souse based on previous review.

The flaw in this dish is that it doesn't seem to know whether it going towards Thai cuisine or general American - Chinese. To make it more of a Thai version, it needs coriander (fresh) instead of mint and more green onion. I will make this again, but with these changes. Also, more spice would help as well.

The mint is really nice, but, overall, it's somewhat bland. If I made it again, which I probably won't, I might double the sauce and use some to marinate the beef. Also, you'd need a very large pan to get the eggplant done in two batches. I needed four and ended up using more oil than I'm comfortable with (health-wise). Taste-wise, the eggplant was great!
