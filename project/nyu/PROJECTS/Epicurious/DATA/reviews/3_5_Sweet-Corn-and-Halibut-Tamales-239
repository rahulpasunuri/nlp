This was delicious and really, really easy to make. We upped it to three ears of corn and served it alongside some spanish rice. Next time I might slightly reduce the amount of sugar just to let the fish stand out a bit more, but it came out fantastic following the recipe exactly.

I didn't care for this recipe. With the great ingregients involved, I guess I just expected more flavour. I found it quite bland even with the addition of finely chopped jalepenos to the corn mixture.

This was both delicious and visually appealing. Since the grocery store did not have halibut, my mother thought of using salmon. I highly recommend doing that. We served it with sliced tomatoes and sweet corn muffins.

It was good but it lacked flavor. We seasoned the halibut with more seasoning then it called for but it still was missing something. It might just be our taste, because our friends who we made it for loved it.

This is an excellent dish. I like to add a little red pepper.

This makes a gorgeous presentation and is scrumptious. It's sweetly flavored because of the corn so a bottle of tabasco or hot sauce is suitable on the side. I think I'll make a pineapple salsa/chutney with it the next time.

I liked it a lot. Fresh corn and corn husks aren't always available a the super markets, I had to make a trip to the farmer's market to get it. It's a real hassle in SF.

This is fantastic with a fresh salsa verde, or with a New Mexico green chile puree.

I have fixed this for many friends and they love it. It is great with a roasted red pepper sauce over the top. The corn flavor and roasted red pepper flavor goes great together.
