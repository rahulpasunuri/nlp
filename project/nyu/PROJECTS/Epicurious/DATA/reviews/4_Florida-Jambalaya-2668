I enjoyed this recipe. Made it mostly as written except threw in a bit of boneless chicken breast and subbed roasted red bell pepper for the pimentos. Also kicked up the cayenne a bit. Got rave reviews at my house.

Think of this as a basic framework. Starting here, you can add, subtract, adjust as you like. I tend to prefer chorizo instead of andouille. I've made it milder or spicier, depending on who's coming. I've used crayfish instead of shrimp. Been using this recipe for 15 years, and keep coming back to it for a bit of spicy comfort. If you can get Tiger Sauce, it makes a great condiment.

Surprisingly good! I followed the recipe, except for the cilantro, added an extra garlic clove, and one teaspoon of cayenne pepper and it was great. The potatoes do sound strange but they work well. I will make this again.

This is easy to make and really good. I added smoked paprika, the juice of half a lemon, some chicken, a cup of crushed tomato, a drizzle of olive oil, and a half cup of peas. I left out the pimientos and it turned out great!

Yum! Easy one pot meal for sure! Used brown rice and cooked longer before adding potatoes and sausage back in. Husband thought the olives were out of place in a jambalaya, but I thought they were yummy! Will definitely make again!

A tasty easy one pot meal-my husband loved it!!! Spicy and delicious. I cheated and used a package of Jambalaya rice mix. Started by sauteing celery, onion and red peppers in oil. Added chourico sausage, chicken thigns and garlic...browned up the meat a bit, then added the rice packet & wine. Once rice was coated I added a can of fire roasted tomatoes, then the chicken broth with some water. I was worried with the rice packet, it would be too salty! It wasn't just spicy!! No potatoes or turmeric used. Added shrimp, pimientos and cilantro as directed. I will definitely make this again. Fabulous!

This recipe is great! No need for potatoes- sub scallops if you want to spend and if not just leave out the potatoes. Also, I used beer instead of wine and liked it even better.

This was super easy, quick, and got rave reviews from my friends! I used Trader Joe's soy chorizo for the sausage, and subbed scallops for the potatoes based on a previous suggestion. I didn't have white wine, so I added some extra broth. In the morning, I prepped everything through cooking the rice and put the pot in the fridge. Right before we were ready to eat dinner, I reheated the rice mixture, sauteed the scallops, and added them along with already cooked shrimp & the cilantro. My only regret is that I didn't make double - there we no leftovers!

This was great! I made it into a vegetarian meal, using "Gimme Lean" sausage style. I also substituted the butter with olive oil like in the previous review. My carnivorous husband had seconds. Remember salt, pepper and cayenne to taste... I will definitely make again.

Rating: 4
Just wrote a review and forgot to say that I deleted the butter and used 1 Tbs of olive oil instead. The sausage was turkey, and i increased the amount about 50% because I had it and wanted to use it up. Next time, I will use the correct amount of sausage.

Taking advice from other reviewers, I added 2 chopped jalapenos with the onions, used pacific low sodium broth, breakfast sausage (on hand) ~1/4 tsp. cayenne, and brown rice. Because of the brown rice, I removed the sauteed ingredients, then started the rice, after the rice was cooked ~30 minutes, I put the sauteed ingredients back into the pot. The potatoes and all were perfect. My family loved it! I too wonder what side dishes, as I'm going to serve it for an informal dinner party next week. Obviously, a fruit/orange salad would be good to cut the heat. I don't want anything else with the texture of the Jambalaya. Maybe stuffed summer squash? Please send advice.

I have made this dish multiple times since first seeing it in the 1992 issue of Bon Appetit and always liked it. Because a guest for dinner was allergic to conventional potatoes, I substituted sweet potato. The sweetness and color was a nice twist on this dish.

I made this when it was first published in '92. My daughter came through the door and said "Thank god, something different." My dad said not to expect him to eat much of it because he was a person who enjoyed his food cremated and shrimp ... well it wasn't one of his favorites. After about three helpings he said he wouldn't mind having it again and couldn't understand why my daughter and I were giggling when he kept piling it on his plate. It has since become a family holiday favorite. I'm semi catering a christmas party for a friend and he's asked me to make it for his family. But I can say to keep it from becoming mushy to put less broth into the mix and let it simmer at a low heat. I usually add italian hot sausage or the andouille. Can anyone suggest some side dishes to go with it.

This has been a family favorite since first published in the magazine in 1992. Don't substitute for the pimento and don't substitute for the cilantro or tumeric. All essential to making this dish the great one it is.

Rating: 4
Oh my, I do love this recipe too. This is comfort food. Everyone I've made this for loves it, and I've made it a lot. The only thing I have to adjust for different tastes is the heat level. I have found that omitting the wine has little effect and rather than the pimentos I use pickled jalapenos which are consistant in their heat level (as opposed to fresh). Be sure to add the shrimp last or they get tough. Delicious.

Ewwww. I don't know if it's because I substituted capers for the pimentos and fresh parsley for the cilantro, but regardless it turned out mushy and bland.

loved it enough to make it again! Used andouille sausage - was really good.

I've made this recipe several times now and it's so easy and delicious I had to comment! I reduced the fat content by replacing the 3 T of butter (!) with 1 T of olive oil and using turkey kielbasa. Also, I find that the 3-4 oz jar of pimentos is sufficient. Not sure how authentic this is but it's good!

Rating: 4
This recipe is a great jumping off point. We substituted olive oil for the butter, included a can of diced tomatoes, and added a couple of mahi mahi filets when we threw in the shrimp. Cut back on the tumeric by half (not fond of it), added more cayanne pepper and a little cumin. Everyone loved it - I can see making it again any time I need to use extra sausage, fish, chicken - tons of possibilities.

I've made this dish several times, and it's my absolute favorite, both to prepare and to eat! Everyone I've made it for absolutely loves it. My one alteration: since I'm a seafood lover, I substitute sea scallops for the potatoes. This makes it a somewhat pricey dish to prepare, but it's well worth the extra cost!

This is why I love Epicurious.com! Last minute trip to the store, 40 min from the driveway to the table, rave rave raved! about by everyone. I added chicken (thighs) and green mussels, and used left over Chorizo. To all those that left out the potatos, you missed out. I thought I would have leftovers but my kids had other plans and licked the pot clean.

Rating: 4
This was easy and VERY yummy. I'm a one pot meal kinda person due to time contraints and this fit me perfectly. It's healthy and doesn't take a lot of time to make. The only substitutions I made was brown rice instead of white for the extra health benefits and I added one small can of pizza sauce to it. I wanted my jambalaya to be red like I'd seen in New Orleans! The cooking time was another twenty or so minutes because of the brown rice but WELL worth the wait!

Rating: 3
We made this with chicken instead of shrimp, since I don't like shrimp. Also omitted the cilantro since I didn't have any, and probably OD'ed on the cayenne, on top of the Creole seasoning I added....GOOD kick, pretty good flavor! Next time I'll add bell pepper and maybe some zucchini or something. I boiled a chicken and used that broth for the stew. Had pretty good flavor!

This dish has become a camping staple-cooked over coals in a dutch oven. It is easily adjusted for a crowd. At the suggestion of a friend, I've topped it with fried plantains- a nice sweet complement to the spice.

Very nice. Used 1/4 cup broth less than called for. Wasn't sure if this dish is supposed to be soggy mess or not since I have never had Jambalaya. It turned out like a risotto despite the reduction in liquid.

I love this recipe and I make it all the time. I've made it in the slow cooker as well - I just throw all the ingredients into the cooker, except the shrimp. I cook it on low about 6 hours and add the shrimp for the last half an hour. Delicious!!

Yuck. This is the worst recipe I have made from Epicurious. The color, texture and flavor were all lousy.

I would actually give this three and a half forks. This was almost as good as my favorite restaurant's jambalaya. My family loved it. It was very easy and very fast. I chose to ommit the potatoes as well. I also substituted penne pasta for the rice. I added some mushrooms and some chopped red peppers as well. I ended up adding some extra liquid to keep it a bit saucy. I kept the cayenne at a minimum for the kids, but if I ever make it for adult company I'll kick it up a notch. This is going into my list of staple meals.

Oh my goodness...this recipe is absolutely wonderful! It's amazing how good this this...you must try it. This came out perfect with the following adjustments...I used a little more garlic than called for. I used low sodium chicken broth, much less turmeric (just a few shakes, or to your taste), cayenne pepper to taste and 7 shakes of Garlic Tobasco. I used a good quality Reisling wine and it tastes perfect in it. This is most definitely a keeper recipe! It's always my policy to taste as I go, and I was able to add just the right amount of cayenne, turmuric, salt, and pepper to make the seasoning perfect.

A quick and easy recipe, with great results. I doubled the recipe, and added a 14.5 ounce can of diced tomatoes along with the shrimp, towards the end of cooking. Also added several splashes of Tabasco for some tang and heat. I used spicy smoked sausage for the kielbasa.

The first time we made it we found it a bit plain so the next time we added six drops of Tabasco. That changed everything! It is now a staple at our house.

I have made this reciped many times over the years. It is always a hit at tail gates or other events in the fall. If you double the recipe don't double the chiken stock. Maybe use about a 1/4 to 1/2 cup less. In my opinion the rice gets a bit too mushy when you double. You should enjoy it!

This is much more than a good recipe. I have made this several times, once over a propane stove on a sailboat, and it never fails to bring smiles to all who are eating it. I've stopped measuring ingredients for the most part (except for rice and liquid) because it seems that the combination of ingredients makes it impossible for this dish to fall short of excellence. Last night I made this with Andouille sausage and cut the potatoes a little larger than other times; the result: perfect, as opposed to previously when the result was... er.... perfect! The Andouille added a nice subtle "background" heat that only added to this amazing dish. This belongs in the comfort food hall of fame!

Best jambalaya I have made yet! Very Versatile. Doubled the onion and garlic and added 1 jalepeno pepper and 1 chopped sweet red pepper (sauted them all together). Used 3/4 lb. of smoked turkey kielbasa and 1 lb. of shrimp. Increased the rice to 1 1/2 cups and increased the chicken broth to about 3 cups. Also left out potatoes and pimientos. Added 1 tsp. of cayenne pepper and 1 tsp. of cajun seasoning. This had a huge kick! The spicy kick did mellow out the next day.

OK, I was a bit skeptical about this dish. Anytime I see the 3-4 fork review involving canned soup, I figure it's all the MSG (which we avoid in our kitchen) that makes it taste so good. WOW, was I wrong with this recipe! I used Pacific brand chicken broth (MSG-free, available at natural foods grocery stores) and Bruce Aidell's smoked turkey sausage, and it was yummy-yummy-yummy. It's easy and quick to prepare, and my husband inhaled it. I'll definitely make this again.

We made this recipe for our families on Thanksgiving weekend in 1992 and absolutely loved it, but my husband's mother threw away the magazine and we thought the recipe was lost forever. We recently found your website and are thrilled to have found the recipe again. We are making it for friends tonight. Thank you!

Very quick, easy. This dish is very yellow -- for color, I'd add chopped green peppers. I used chicken instead of shrimp, and left out potatoes (previous 2 suggestions) it was very good.

Big hit with the family! After reading the reviews, I added one chopped, fresh jalapeno with the onion and garlic and about half a tsp of cayenne. It was delicious and plenty spicy. It would probably work just as well with chicken instead of shrimp.

After reading previous reviews, I added a little extra onion, 3 sliced jalapenos (added when cooking onion and garlic), plenty of cayenne and Tobasco. My boyfriend and I both thought it was very good, although I don't really think the potato is necessary. Next time, I'll try it without.

This was good but not great. The only change I made was to use a red onion instead of white only because I wanted to use up the red onion. I'll make this again but perhaps perk it up a bit but I'm not sure with what yet.

I've made this recipe many times because,as a working mother, I rely on "do-ahead" recipes. I prepare it the night before and everything except for the shrimp sits in the pot overnight in the fridge. When I get home it just needs to be boiled and I throw in the shrimp and some frozen peas at the end.

Great! We've made it a number of times and everyone has enjoyed it. I recommend boiling the potatoes before adding them otherwise the rice is done first and gets mushy by the time the potatoes were cooked through.

Turned out great but I would suggest that you make the following changes: 1) Grill the sauage 2) Add grilled chicken breast 3) Cook the shrimp ro 1 Min the turn off the heat and let sit for 3 min. I added more garlic and used some bacon drippings (very little) and lessened the butter. The cilantro when added at the end really accentuated the recipe. Definitely would make it again.

Very good meal! As jambalya goes, not TOO spicy, but you can zip it up with more cayann pepper. I went kind of mild on the first batch, that seemed to go over better. This is really easy to make and tastes really good for left overs.
