I'm not a big fan of peanut butter, so I made these with white chocolate chips instead, and they were absolutely delectable. Easy, too!

I love these cookies. They are so easy to make, filled with chips and taste delicious for days on end. Since they didn't have peanut butter chips at my grocery store at the time, I bought butterscotch chips. Loved it.

I made these for a bake sale. Very easy and pretty tasty, look great. I used becel rather than butter - dough was quite soft and full of the pb and choc chips but cooked up fine.

delicious but I only got 30 cookies from this recipe.

Delicious! I love chocolate so I used 1 1/2 c flour and 3/4 c cocoa powder. Another change I would make in the future is using only PB chips and no chocolate chips, since I thought there could be more peanutty flavor. These cookies are wonderful and I will definitely make them again. My friends commented that they were a good compromise between cookies and brownies since they were so rich. The recipe made about 24 medium-size cookies.

Ok, I used this as a base and created my own variation. Everything is the same but these three things: I used 1/2 cup splenda and 1/2 cup sugar, and I added 1/3 cup peanut butter to the butter mixture, and I added about 1/4 cup more flour, and I just used chocolate chunks and no peanut chips. I loved them! I wanted to have a little peanut butter flavor in them but I don't like peanut butter chips because of how unnatural they taste. They came out pretty cakey, which was fantastic! I know there are a lot of deviations- wanted to give it a review anyway!

They were ok. I did reduce the sugar slightly (1/4 cup) but I think it was that we didn't like the cocoa in the base, it made them a bit overwhelmingly chocolatey rather than chocolate chip which is what we were after. very easy.

I have made these cookies many many times over the past 10 years and they always turn out fabulous and do not last long in my house. Whether you take them out at 10 minutes or bake them til 12, they are always great. I also love to just use chocolate chips and add dried cherries - YUM! They're my "go-to" cookie.

Made these with Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder, which made them especially dark and chocolaty. Added some extra flour, per the other reviewers' suggestions, as well as some extra cocoa (no more than 1/4 extra, flour & cocoa combined); baked for only 10 minutes. So far, 15 minutes out of the oven, they're great (for a simple, everyday cookie). I'm taking them to a party tonight... On a side note, I sure wish someone besides Reese's would make peanut-butter chips. Theirs just are not peanut-buttery enough, in my opinion. But that's nothing to do with this recipe--these are very good cookies. If you don't like peanut butter, or you're making them for someone with allergies, you could always substitute white chocolate chips.

Decadent..sweet...sweet...grab a glass of milk. Be prepared the cookie dough is very dry and it was difficult to mix all the chips into the dough. I left out maybe 1/4 cup of the chips and they were not missed. I cooked my cookies for 14min versus the 12min and they looked pretty uncooked, but that is only because they are a chewy cookie so I do not recommend cooking them anything past the 14mins. Let them cool and they are quite soft and chewy. Everyone raved over them...will definitely make again.

I added a 1/4 cup extra flour, used salted butter and ditched the extra salt, used 11 oz. of chocolate chips only (I didn't have PB chips on hand), formed the cookies with the large side of my melon baller, and cooked for exactly 10 minutes...and...WOW! SO yummy! Very sweet, so the smaller size is just perfect. Very easy recipe with delicious and sweet results!

These cookies were fabulous. As others said, you MUST take them out of the oven at 10 minutes if you want them gooey, but if you do that they have a brownie like consistency inside. Very easy and very yummy.

I didn't care for this recipe. The cookies weren't gooey or moist, and I didn't like the flavor of the peanut butter chips- it just didn't seem complimentary for some reason. To be completely honest though, I did tinker with the recipe a bit by adding 1/2 c of ground espresso.

Wow! Use a good chocolate and you won't be disappointed. This is a fantastic recipe. I added about 1/4 more flour and put the dough in the refrigerator for a few minutes before baking. I get large, rich, chewy cookies.

Great recipe!! I've made these cookies twice now. The first time I made them I used an Omega 3 egg and used a large melon baller. The recipe only yielded about 3 dozen cookies that were a little too crisp. Second time I used a regular brown egg and a small melon baller. The recipe yielded 65 cookies. They are so rich that the smaller size is perfect. Side note: I also used Scharffenberger chocolate powder. Delicious!!

My five year old son calls these "black cookies"- but he loved them so much I had to hide them away before he ate them all! I like that they are a very simple cookie to make so its fun to do with the kids. The flavor is pretty straight forward so if you are looking for a cookie you have never "tried" before- this probably isn't the recipe for you. Great for the little ones, I will surely be making them again.

These are definitely good cookies. I would suggest if you don't like crunchy cookies going with a 10 minute cooking time. Not the best I've ever had, but definitely good.

This has become my go-to cookie recipe. By far the best cookie recipe I've ever come across. Bake for 10 minutes or so (just until the cookies start to crack on the top) for a chewy cookie.

I made these with my kids. Since no one likes hard cookies in my house, I added a touch more flour and used imperial margarine. Half the salt. Also under cook a touch. They were chewy and wonderful.

Was hoping for a more chewy cookie but still delicious. Only made 3 dozen.

I always forget how great these are till I make them again. We brought some to our local police station for holiday greetings, and got an enthusiastic Thank You note. I'd like to find a way to get them a little more substantial; mine break apart sometimes upon removal from the sheet, even with the cooling time. I'll try a bit more flour next time.

These cookies ROCK!! Sooooo easy and no messy cleanup. These are YUMMY!! Go ahead...use the whole 12oz bag of chocolate chips...eat these when there hot and gooey...the BEST!!

Very good. Even though I used extremem restraint and did NOT eat the dough, I found it only made 4 dozen.

I made this cookies for my husband who is diabetic, so I used splenda sugar,peanut butter not the chips and no-sugar chocolate, they were a little dry but very good,he likes them. They taste good with a cold glass of milk. I had a friend over and she did not know they were no-sugar cookies.

Normally I'm in synch with the other reviewers, but this time is an exception. I was definitely underwhelmed by these cookies. They were okay but not spectacular. I generally want to "Wow" people with a new recipe and did not get that reaction with this one.

These were definately GOOD but I thought they were pretty salty even with the unsalted butter!! Surprisingly light too!!

I made these cookies one night when friends were stopping by, and they LOVED every last bite of them (non-stop raves). They're soft and chewy (I used a teensy bit less sugar than the recipe calls for) and for people like me who think peanut butter and chocolate should always be eaten together, they're perfect. I'd make these again in a second.

A definite addition to my cookie recipe collection. I brought the entire batch to a party and they were gone in less than an hour. Perfect combo of chocolate and peanut butter!

My friends and I could not stop eating these cookies as soon as they came out of the oven. They're just like reese's peanut butter cups, and perfect with a glass of milk. They should be rewarmed before eating, because they can get slightly hard the next day.

Oh these were good. Made them for a relative's birthday party. They were the first to go. I doubled the recipe and had tons of cookies.

I halved this recipe, but still used one egg. Came out fine. They were really easy to prepare. I chilled the dough a bit, enough to allow me to form the batter into balls. The cookies have a soft, slightly crunchy texture, and as one of the other reviewers mentioned, they are chocholatey, but not sickenly rich. The chocolate and peanut butter combination is a real winner.

These cookies are terrific!!! I actually followed the recipe exactly (a first for me), and they came out great. I would make them again and again...

I've made these several times, to universal acclaim. They're not too rich, but have enough chocolate to satisfy the most demanding chocoholic. And I love peanut butter and chocolate together!
