Like so many others, I used 1/4 cup white sugar and didn't make the sauce. The cake was spectacular! Don't leave out the candied ginger. It's a real treat!

This is a nice, dense, moist, rustic cake. I cut back the granulated sugar by 1/4, but I wish that I had done so even more as others have--I still found it a bit too sweet. I served it with some warm unsweetend cream, which worked well. Cannot imagine adding the full amount of sugar AND adding a sweet sauce. Interesting mixing technique: Dump all of the cake ingredients into the bowl and mix it up. Results in a rustic texture that works well for this cake. The batter is very, very stiff, so much so that I worried that I had missed a liquid ingredient. But not to worry--the apples have enough moisture that it ends up really moist.

I feel like I'm the only one who doesn't love this recipe as much as all the other reviews. It's just zucchini bread but substituted with apples. And I agree with other reviewers, it is WAY too sweet. I followed the recipe exactly except subbed walnuts for pecans. I don't think I'll make this again since it's just a ho-hum recipe, but if I do I'd cut down the sugars for sure.

This is amazing. I substituted the raisins for dried plums I had left over from last year. I chopped them up and soaked them in the rum. Yum yum. Otherwise followed recipe exactly. (Except I used dark brown sugar instead of light) The crystalized ginger is a MUST. Bake for 50 minutes exactly. I whipped cream and added some pumpkin butter to it instead of the eggnog sauce. YUMMY!!!

This is a delicious recipe and very easy to make. My houseguests have been eating it all weekend, even sneaking bites in-between meals! The only suggestion I have is to use oil and flour to grease the pan instead of butter and flour, since my cake stuck a bit.

Delicious! This is the perfect fall cake! It is super moist and the spices make you think of fall foliage! The nuts give it a nice crunch (I substituted walnuts as that is all I had and - needless to say - that worked just as well) and used soaked dried cranberries as I am not fan of raisins. And I agree with other reviewers, no need for the eggnogg. I took this to work and everybody loved it. I also froze the left-over I had and it defrosts at room temperatures in 15 minutes.

This recipe came out great! Soaked the Craisins in a combination of dark rum and ginger liqueur. Do not discard the left over liquid - use it to make a delicious drink for yourself while you bake the cake! I used half the butter and half the sugar called for in the recipe - and about 5 cups of apples - it was plenty sweet. Subbed walnuts for pecans because that's what I had. The candied ginger added a nice touch to the cake. No need for the eggnog sauce; just top with confectioner's sugar. Will make again!

This cake was moist and delicious! I only omitted the nuts, due to allergies. For a better sauce option, try the one from this recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/v iews/Pear-Cranberry-Cake-356040

The best! I made this for Thanksgiving, I left out the ginger and pecans and the egg nog sauce, and it was great. Everyone wanted the recipe. It was the first leftover to go, and I want to make more.

Made this for Thanksgiving. Skipped the egg nog "sauce." I will be making it again, but will probably cut back on the ginger a bit, I found it a little overpowering.

Delicious! I made cupcakes out of the recipe because I didn't have a bundt pan. I also did not have all spice, but I used orange peel instead. It still turned out really good. (It was sweet enough with only 1/2 cup of the regular granulated sugar.)

This cake is wonderful, moist, great spice combination, easy to make. I too made it the old fashioned way where you cream the butter, add eggs one at a time, etc. The only change I made was cutting the granulated sugar in half. I served mine with a small scoop of icecream and some pecan caramel sauce, soooooo good. These comments are for newcook2010, who said that her cake crumbled when she cut it. 1. Perhaps you baked it too long? I found that 55 minutes was right at my end. Always check 10 minutes prior to the end of baking time. 2. With a moist cake like this, full of apples, raisins, and nuts, try using a serrated knife to cut the cake. Also, I never cut the cake immediately. I let it cool JUST until cool (maybe just a tad warm), then cover with saran, and let it sit at least 2 hours before using the cake. By that time, the exterior of the cake is moist as well and that facilitates cutting as well.

The smell was amazing when this thing was in the oven, omg. I made it for Thanksgiving the day beforehand and it held up perfectly. It was simple and quick to make, I think so at least, since I'm used to making pies from scratch. Subbed walnuts for pecans, and soaked the cranberries in Appletons, as thats what I happened to have. Baked in less than an hour, maybe 50 mins-ish. Buttered and floured the Bundt pan and it popped right out, perfectly. I also skipped the eggnog, I served it with some vanilla ice cream and fresh cinnamon whipped cream... MMMM!!! My boyfriends stepdad vacuumed his and half his wife's plate. Oh and this DEFINITELY leans more towards the 12 - 15 servings range.

great cake! i creamed the butter & sugar together, then added the eggs one at a time, before adding the dry ingredients (old habits die hard). i buttered & floured my non stick bunt pan (after reading all the problems) the cake came out easily after cooling for 10 mins, just like the recipe said. once cool, i had no trouble slicing it. just added this to my recipe box.

Used this recipe to make cupcakes. The recipe makes 24 cupcakes or mufffins. I made a few modifications for health reasons; white whole wheat flour and honey instead of white sugar and flour. Half a cup of Honey was fine. The cupcakes were divine! Sweet and moist, with crisp bites of apple. My family actually fought over them! A great cake for fall.

I made the cake exactly as written and it turned out great. The eggnog sauce is a cop-out and eggnog is only seasonally available anyway. A good creme anglais would be the perfect sauce. Cream cheese frosting sounds pretty good too.

Very good and so simple to throw together. Moist and full of flavor, I did cut both sugars down to 3/4 Cup each and this cake is still plenty sweet.I used a non stick pan sprayed with Pam/w flour but it still stuck.

I made this cake for New year's eve party exactly as the recipe says using cranberries and pecans. It was delicious. Everyone loved it. The only problem was when I sliced it half of it crumbled. Can someone tell me why that would happen?

"Eggnog sauce" is misleading, since there is no sauce, but this was a great coffee cake or breakfast cake. the Ginger doesn't really come out as much as the apple, but I liked that. I had left over cream cheese frosting from making the pumpkin pie cupcakes found on this site, and since it came out really runny it was the perfect topping for this cake. I also loved the nuts.

Has anyone tried freezing this bread? I'd like to make mini loaves to give as gifts but not sure the ginger and apple will hold up.

Excellent, moist, flavorful, pretty bundt cake. The eggnog around the slice of cake makes it perfect, kind of like a light frosting added. I made this for Thanksgiving and again a few days later. I didn't know if I would like it as I don't like apple desserts. This is great and I am spreading the news and the recipe.

Amazing. I made this cake for Thanksgiving this year and everyone raved. I used cranberries, soaked in Meyer's Dark Rum, and pecans. Didn't use the eggnog, but dipped in coffee the morning after. The ginger is the perfect touch. I would probably even add a little more next time. So delicious!

A wonderful fall dessert! I used both cranberries and raisins ('cause I didn't have quite enough of either) soaked in Calvados, which I heated a bit to speed things up. Did not use the eggnog, but I had some leftover maple filling from making pumpkin whoopie pies. I thinned the filling a little with milk, and used it to glaze the cake. I also had some salted caramel sauce left over from another recipe (can you tell I bake a lot?) and drizzled that over the whole thing just before serving. Unbelievable!

Forgot to mention, I reduced the sugars to 3/4 cup, per other reviewers and it was plenty sweet. Also, soaked the raisins in Applejack. And I sprayed the Bundt pan with lots of that Crisco spray with flour.

Made this yesterday -- skipped the eggnog, though -- and thought it was definitely one of the better apple cakes around. Had no trouble getting it out of the pan. Used raisins and toasted walnuts; next time -- which will be by the end of the week -- will use cranberries and the pecans. Really liked the ginger in it.

Outstanding! I reduced both sugars to 3/4 cup each per other reviews and used dried cranberries instead of raisins. This recipe is definitely a keeper! Cake turned out of pan perfectly for me, but I sprayed pan liberally with Baker's Joy which has flour in it. It's the only thing I trust for Bundt type pans. Cake is moist and spiced just right.

This is a relatively easy recipe that I would make again in a heart beat. It is so moist and flavorful; not too sweet. We had ripe apples off a Beverly Hills tree that I used four cups of. I didn't serve it with any sauce, it was fine alone, and eggnog is not my thing. Vanilla ice cream would be nice, if you felt the need for something extra. I used dried cranberries soaked in Applejack and used the soaking water for the liquid and drank the rest, yum. A nice little treat for the baker after putting the cake in the oven.

Made this recipe 3x this season. Had to chime in on the pan comments. The first time the cake did not come out cleanly and the apples seemed to have migrated to the bottom. The next time I cut this apple chunks a bit smaller, and let the cake sit about 1/2 hour before inverting. No problems after letting it sit longer. Be sure to butter and flour every little crevice. I agree, a bit less sugar is just fine. The eggnog over the top is awesome-try it!

I made this recipe a week ago for a party that was canceled due to snow. 6 days later we're still snacking on this cake. It is moist and full of flavor. Followed the recipe as written with no problems. I had made the tiramisu eggnog trifle from a recipe on this site and had lots of the eggnog filling leftover. I've been serving it with this cake and they work perfectly together.

Made exactly as written for cake. Took liberty on the eggnog- used a canned (yes, canned and delicious) cream cheese frosting that I diluted w/a little milk. Then drizzled this over the cake. It was fantastic!

This cake rocks! It is NOT your typical bland apple cake. It's more like a fall harvest version of fruitcake. I have made it with raisins and walnuts, as well as with cranberries and pecans. I soaked them in Calvados til the liquid was almost gone. Some reviewers have noted difficulty with the cake sticking to the pan, but I use Pam for Baking (with flour in it) and just sprayed the heck out of the bundt pan; didn't have any problems. This cake is special enough to give as a gift or bring to a party, and is soo delicious. Cut slices as thin as the ridges on your bundt pan...it's rich and tasty!

this cake is a wonder and a revelation. i made it tonight for my dad's birthday--he is a major fan of all things apple, all things eggnog, and all things rum-raisin--and it was a huge hit. i did cut down the brown sugar to 1/2 c, upped the rum to 1/3 c, and left out the ginger. i also forgot the vanilla. the cake left it's entire top in the bundt pan, so it was rather free-form on top, but i made a thick powdered sugar/rum glaze and poured it over the top and it was lovely. make this one!

This recipe is all that the reviews said it is. I brought it to a potluck and had many requests for the recipe. I used the Baker's spray and it came out of the bundt pan readily. I soaked the dried cranberries in hot rum and they absorbed it all--a very tasty morsel to bite into. This is a keeper!

This cake was stored at room temperature, covered, for two days and was served tonight. I too have an elaborate-design bundt pan, and yet with buttering and flouring I had no trouble getting it out of the pan. I let it cool in the pan for 10 minutes per instructions, inverted it, gave it a sound shake, and it came out beautifully. After two days the cake had become even more moist and fragrant. I tried the egg nog sauce but won't do that again. The cake is very brown, and I think what would make it much more attractive would be a white sugar drizzle glaze, just to break up the brown. Instead of raisins, I plumped tiny bits of dried apple which I order from King Arthur Flour, but raisins would have been fine as well. I used the apple jack brandy which also kicked up the apple flavor. Very good apple spice cake and very easy.

This sticky sticky cake did stick to my bundt cake pan despite my extra butter/flour precaution based on earlier reviews. I did not make the eggnog sauce, so I imagine that made a big difference, becuase I did not think this was such an amazing cake. It was good, and it sure feels rich (too sweet even) but I didn't find it to be as outstanding as some other reviewers. My family didn't ask me to make it again either.

I made this for my Christmas Eve dinner and it was outstanding! Thanks to the previous reviewers who suggested: 1) increasing the baking time -- I baked mine for about 70 mins); 2) cutting down on the sugar to 1/2 cup each; 3) saving the rum and brushing it onto the cake while it cools. I think next time I'll make mini-bundts to share with others!

This is the best cake I've ever made. It's turned out perfectly every time I've made it (5 or 6 times). I've used both raisin and craisins and both are delicious. I don't know why people had problems with the cake sticking. I use the baker's magic flour spray and I've never had a problem. It gets raves from everyone. I'm also especially impressed at how well it keeps--the bottom even stays a little crispy which pairs so well with the moistness of the body. Yum!

After reading the horror stories of the cake sticking, I decided to invest in a new nonstick pan which I buttered and floured. When I removed the cake from the oven and turned it upside down onto a plate, it fell out immediately - not even a suggestion of sticking. The pan is a "Wilton Ultrabake 2" fluted tube pan, 9 3/4" x 3 3/8." I bought it at Target for about $13. I baked the cake for 70 minutes and I think 60 minutes would have been fine. I brushed it several times with Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum while it was cooling. Peeling the apples was the most time-consuming part.

Very good. A little less sweet and it would be a 4-forker. Next time I'll cut back on the sugar. Mine also stuck a bit to the pan after cooling for about 1/2 an hour, next time I'll let it cool completely and see if that works. Generally I find that cooled cakes release better than warm cakes. Love the one-bowl easiness. Used a little less baking powder than called for because of the altitude here (3600 feet) and it cooked up just right in an hour at 300 with a convection oven.

I find that many recipes contain way too much sugar, so I cut the sugar in half, using 1/2 c brown and 1/2 c white. If you don't want to wait for 1 hour to plump the raisins, soak them in hot water for 10 min. The cake does need more than 1 hour baking time.

very tasty! and easy enough for a weeknight. i used a mixture of dried fruits-- raisins, cherries, and currants-- and it really added to the flavor of the cake. also, i used granny smith apples as they are all i had on hand... the cake is still wonderful, despite the advice to avoid them.

Fantastic! Needed something 'simple' for xmas. Didn't stick for me (non- stick pan). Mixed red and golden raisins and cranberries. None plumped while soaking, but they were moist and plump in the cake. Crysallized ginger was $9.19 for 2 oz! Everyone loved it. This will become a regular for xmas. I am already passing out the recipe to friends and family. Enjoy.

Very good. Purchased but didn't need the eggnog. I used dried cranberries, which did not "plump" after the directed soaking time, so I added more rum and brought to a simmer on stovetop for a minute, which did the trick. Then made exactly as directed and turned out great. Next time I would add a little more apple and I'd also toast the pecans prior to adding them to the batter.

Eggnog not necessary. I used Planters Punch (dark and spicy) rum as the flavours mimic those in the cake. Fresh nutmeg essential. Wonderful flavour & if it lasts another day, it will still be moist.
