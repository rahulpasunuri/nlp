There was about half teaspoon too much salt, we thought. And the texture wasn`t right, wasn`t authentic. I will use a different recipe next time.

These are great! We made them at the end of a Cinco De Mayo party and they came out delicious. Very easy to make, we used the oil left from making Chili Rellenos. They were crisp and fluffy and were the perfect thing after all the margaritas.
