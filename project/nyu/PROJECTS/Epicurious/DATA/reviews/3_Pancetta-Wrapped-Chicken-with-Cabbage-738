This is great and looks so nice. I didn't add the sage and I didn't add the extra herbs before wrapping w/ pancetta. Otherwise, made as is with the cabbage, it's really not that fussy. My husband doesn't like chicken breasts, but he likes this because the pancetta gives so much flavor and the chicken is moist. The cabbage is yummy too.

I didn't make the exact recipe (too fussy) but rather used it as inspiration for another, simpler, dish. I had some chicken and cabbage, and was looking for a recipe that used both. I just happened to have some bacon and fresh rosemary as well, so I came up with the following variation. I marinated the chicken breast according to the instructions, but with powdered herbs where I didn't have fresh, and with some lemon, and for less than an hour. Then, I continued as per the instructions, but used chopped bacon instead of pancetta, and skipped the bit about layering and wrapping and baking. When the cabbage was cooked (with bacon & fresh rosemary and a splash of wine) I was ready to finish the dish, I sliced the chicken as for a stir fry, and stir fried it as briefly as possible with some sliced garlic, and then added the cooked cabbage. It was very good and flavorful. Not a must-have recipe, but a great way to use the ingredients I had on hand.

I have made this recipe several times and my friends keep requesting it whenever I invite them over. Scrape off the fresh herbs and don't add more when wrapping with pancetta though, it gets overpowering.

I simplified this recipe by using dried herbs for the marinade. I wrapped the chicken with prosciutto but I did not add the recommended herbs. I added a bit of garlic to oil prior to browning the chicken and did not remove it. I cooked the chicken in the oven in the same pan and didn't bother making the wine sauce. My husband really enjoyed this dish, I thought it was decent. Next time I would make the wine sauce by removing the chicken from the skillet and deglazing that pan. Although this review has been long winded, making the recipe was quite simple with the shortcuts I made!

This just did not work for us. Individually I love every single ingredient, I tried to follow the whole recipe but it was just too much. Too much seasoning - flavors were overpowering. I think it could be good with more restraint.

This is really good, it takes a while to prepare though. We really liked the flavor combinations.
