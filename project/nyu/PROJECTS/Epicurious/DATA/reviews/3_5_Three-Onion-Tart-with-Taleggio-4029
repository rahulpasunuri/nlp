This is a big hit every time. I serve it as an appetizer or a side dish. Have made it, except baking, and then popped it in oven when I need it.

This is tasty, but if you are going to make a fancy cheese and leek tart, I would recommend the "Belgian Leek Tart with Aged Goat Cheese" instead-- I thought it was a bit tastier and the addition of some milk/cream made it feel a bit more substantial than just melted cheese and onions/leeks. :)

Strike me down, but I have made this three times with Pilsbury crust and people go crazy for it. I made the filling as written: excellent. Another time I made it with just tons of green onions and a large red onion, a blend of tallegio and aged mild cheddar with gran padano on top instead of the parmesan. I also added the fresh thyme as another reviewer suggested. It was also amazing and a little mellower for those who don't love the strong tallegio flavor. My one year old devoured that one. Finally, I have made this with filo crust brushed with butter and olive oil between the layers and the edges folded over . This one was very beautiful and tasty. I am sure the dough recipe is great, but I have two little ones and if you don't have the time this recipe still shines and is very flexible.

It is beautiful and tastes the same. Timeless.

I've made this tart twice, both times it was fantastic. Be sure to season liberally with salt and pepper. I added about 1 tsp fresh thyme and subsituted taleggio for fontina. The result was an earthy, buttery, onion-y filling with lots of flavor and a hint of fresh herb. The dough for this recipe is easy to work with and very forgiving. After accidently adding 2/3rds of a cup of milk instead of 1/3rd, I tossed in 1/4 cup of flour to compensate and the dough still turned about beautifully. I baked the dough half of the time on a cookie sheet, then transferred it to a heated baking stone to crisp up the bottom. Fantastic as a lunch dish or an elegant appetizer.

Once I was able to beat the dough into submission, this recipe rocked. The dough was really dry so threw it in the food processor, added a little milk at a time until it was nice and soft. Love the sweet onions and I am a taleggio cheese fan from way back. This also freezes beautifully if not all eaten at once. (Fat chance).

This made a great starter for a holiday meal. I used puff pastry instead, substituted goat cheese for the taleggio, and served each person a slice of tart on a bed of baby greens tossed with a light balsamic vinaigrette.

I can only rate the TASTE and PRESENTATION of this recipe, as I was fortunate enough to have it served to me as a dinner guest. The onions give this dish a wonderful sweet flavor which is balanced by the creamy cheese. I really didn't find it to be too rich. The presentation was lovely with a few fresh herbs sprinkled over the top. Beware however, that the word "tart" implies a certain kind of flaky butter crust. But this crust tasted more like a pizza dough instead.

Hmm. This is a hard one. First I think the portion sizes are ALL wrong. This is very rich (even with 1 T olive oil). For a buffet table, I made two rounds in 9 inch cake pans and cut them into 16 pieces each, thus serving 32 versus 8. They were small -- but more than enough given the richness and strong flavors. It's also not anywhere close to attractive -- very brown. I too found the dough somewhat difficult -- what IS the purpose of kneading a dough so long when it has no leavening? I like the concept, however, of a fairly rustic-looking tart with a folded-over crust.

In spite of the stinging eyes from peeling and cooking all the onions, I would definitely make this again. I served it as a starter with glasses of sparkling Prosecco at an Italian themed dinner and there wasn't a crumb left.

This came up really good,my husband was pretty happy about it,considering that que cannot have a meal without meat. I would make two small changes,though,next time I'll use less olive oil for the filling and a little more parmesan cheese.

My rating was based on someone else making the tart. I did not have success. I wish the recipe had told me to stop adding flour at a certain point. Mine was way too dry, I couldn't even roll it out. After 2 hours in the kitchen towel, the dough surface was dried out. Plastic wrap may have been better. I substituted white onions for leeks, which did not taste as good. I subsituted brie, which was bitter, as Tallegio is impossible to find locally. I will try again based on what I have learned. The recipe should say to start the onions as soon as the dough begins to rest, so they can cool. Also start the butter early so it can cool.

Substituted Fontina cheese (taleggio was unavailable). I made 3 smaller tarts, and found there was ample filling. Delish!

This dish was very nice as an appetizer on Christmas Eve. I also think it gets better after a day.

I made this for a Christmas potluck where it recieved raves. I used brie instead of taleggio and added some red bell peppers for color. also, I made the crust into two rectangles (about 4"x10") rather than a single round) and cut the tart into approx. 1 inch slices so it could be eaten as a finger food.

Each year when I visit my parents at their cabin, I serve an appetizer each night. Expectations have become pretty high (the neighbors plan their vacations around my visit), and I have acquired a mountain of appetizer recipes during the process. This is absolutely one of my favorites.
