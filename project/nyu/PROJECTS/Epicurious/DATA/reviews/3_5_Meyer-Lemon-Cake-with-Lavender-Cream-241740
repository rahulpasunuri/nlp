The only useful thing in this recipe is the lavender cream. The cake shrinks WAAAYYYY down, and it doesn't work any better if you try to turn it into cupcakes. (Mine collapsed as soon as I took them out of the oven, so I guess you have to beat the egg whites into more than "soft peaks" to get it to work.) As another reviewer remarked, the lemon curd recipe here uses flour, which is completely unnecessary and doesn't make for good lemon curd. When you make the lavender cream, try using lavender honey instead of regular honey. It didn't separate in my recipe, probably because the honey was high quality. Lavender honey is a little difficult to find, but you might try a specialty foods market or perhaps a farmers' market.

Phenomenal recipe! It takes way too long for my patience,though, so I asked for a little help to push it along. So worth all the effort! Looks thicker in photo than 'actual size'. Best lemon cake ever!

This cake recipe is an excellent one. The crumb was nice and it was really easy to work with. The batter was very light and airy before baking. I didn't like the recipe for the lemon curd - flour is not a necessary ingredient. There are better recipes for meyer lemon curd on this website and I would recommend using one of those. My finished cake wasn't as pretty as the one in the picture, but the flavors were splendid.

The cake was light, sweet and lemony. It was a wonderful counterbalance to the lemon curd. The whipped cream with honey and lavender made you think, just what is it in this cream? We made the cake and the lemon curd and ended up freezing it for two weeks. Both froze really well. I will make this cake again as a cocoanut cake. Got to search out a proper frosting.

The lemon flavour was amazing! The cake was light, but a tad dense, but not heavy. My first try, I made the recipe as it was and hardly got a cake as high as the picture. Maybe just one layer of that cake. 2nd time, I doubled the recipe, and got 2 8" cakes and 2 muffins. I made the curd, it was good when it was warm. But once the curd was cooled and I put it between the layers of cake, it was very tart. I think it needs more sugar. I double the recipe for the curd too, but this was unnecessary. I was unable to find the lavendar blossom. So, I made the cream with a vanilla bean - recommended by one of the reviews. I found this too over powering. The cream is good on its own. I had made extra cream with just confectionary sugar, and that went better with the cake. I think the cake is good on its own with just cream with confectionary sugar. I made the cake again today, I did not butter the sides of the pan so that it will not shrink - just like a angel food cake! And that worked. I really enjoy lemon desserts so I think the cake is best the last way I made it. But I am not sure if I will make the curd again. Maybe from another recipe.

Wow! This was my first time making lemon curd, and it went off without a hitch! The cake itself had an exceptional crumb, but was not as tall as I expected (I ended up with only two layers). I was a little doubtful about the olive oil, but it gave the cake a great texture. I substituted one vanilla bean for the lavender, and it was delicious. I added a few raspberries to the top along with the sugar, and they gave a great contrasting flavor. All in all, this was great, and my whole family loved it! I will be making this again (and soon) for sure!

I made this cake, it was amazing. I didn't use the lavender cream so I cannot say how that was, I used a lemon roux icing instead, but the cake itself was totally worth it. The curd filling was sooooo good that you should make extra just to have in the fridge. The second 'for cake' is the lemon curd, it must just be mislabeled.

This is the lightest, fluffiest slice of heaven! Topped with sprinkled powdered sugar or a lemon cream cheese icing...or all by itself! This is going to make me VERY popular. I made it into cupcakes and had to bake them about 30 minutes to get them golden, which decreased some fluffiness of the cake, but still delicious. If making cupcakes, fill the cups very full, and consider baking at 350 to get golden faster.

YUM! I am going crazy for this cake. I made two- one for a friend, and a gluten-free agave sweetened version for myself and they were both fabulous. Plus, I made tea cakes and cupcakes with some leftover batter - the cupcakes I plopped a strawberry in- delish! Wish I had read the reviews first - a smaller pan is key- even smaller than 8" would be good. I used a 9" for the first one and only got two layers out of it. For the second version I used mini springforms and used each as it's own layer w/out cutting. I whipped my egg whites to semi-stiff peaks, and folded them into the batter SUPER gently, and had no problem with rising, or settling in the middle. Mine needed the full 50 min. For the lavender I bought a box of dried lavender flowers in the tea section at whole foods, and instead of boiling the cream with it, I just heated the honey (I used honey made from lavender too) and steeped the lavender in it in a re-usable teabag. Then I made myself a cup of tea with the bag when I was done. :) I glazed the cake with the lavender honey, and just served with regular whipped cream. For the gluten free cake I used agave syrup instead of sugar, and gluten free pancake mix instead of flour, and one additional egg. It's great! I sprinkled a little powdered sugar and a little lemon zest over mine. Yum Yum.

i helped my boyfriend, an excellent cook but crappy baker, get through this so i wouldn't have to bake my own birthday cake. the flavor was great, curd was tasty, went down well with the bday party crowd, and the lavender cream whipped well (we chilled it for a long while) and was delicious to dollop into earl grey tea the next morning. used a 9 in spring form since that's all i have - it was a little deflated and sad looking even after dusting the powdered sugar on top and attempting the three layers. so, delicious, but not the prettiest cake (maybe better with the correct sized pan).

I was very pleased with how this cake turned out. I followed the recipe to the "T" and I had no problems. I was worried after reading the other reviews. It was somewhat involved but well worth the effort. I was nervous about cutting the single layer into three. but it was pretty easy. I did have trouble whipping the cream but that was only because I didn't let it chill long enough. After it chilled it whipped with a ELECTRIC MIXER just fine. I don't get how you are supposed to use a whisk to whip the lavender cream. This is the only part I guess I didn't follow the recipe to a "T".

I have made this lavender cream twice and although the taste is DELICIOUS, I have had trouble beating air into the cream both times. I made sure it was cold after I steeped the lavender blossoms, but it just would not whip. Any help?

This recipe is poorly written and has errors - it took a couple of minutes to set it right. I used a 9 inch springform because that's what I have (and, the recipe does not specify a size) and sure enough my cake was only tall enough to make two layers. Not a big deal to me. That said, I'm not sold on olive oil cake - the flavor of the olive oil was to assertive in my opinion. Also, five eggs makes it a little too eggy for me. Otherwise, the cake is mostly moist and has good lemon flavor. I love strong citrus flavor, but I think I'd cut down on the amount of zest in the curd. Also, I skipped adding in the egg yolk (again with too much egginess) and it didn't seem to suffer at all. I looked high and low for dried lavender (they didn't even have any at Surfas), but I had to use lavender powder instead. The honey/lavender combination is nice, but if I made the cream again I'd have to experiment with the recipe. I love the idea of a lemon/lavender/honey cake, but I wouldn't use this recipe again. The flavors did not come together like I was hoping.

You can find dried lavendar at Whole Foods Market. They sell it in the spice isle. Its about $2 for a full baggie (you fill it yourself)

This cake is Amazing! I add double lavendar for an extra pop in the cream. This tates wonderful with STRAWBERRIES on top of the cream. I found that the cream firms up in the refridgerator over night, and after 2 days its very, very firm (which I thought made it better). Also, the presentation is better if you double the cake batter and make 2 caskes with one batch of filling to glue them together. It worked surprisingly well in high altitude, which I often have problems with. 4 stars!

This recipe is in severe need of proof-reading. The ingredients are not listed in the order used. The headers in both the ingredient lists and procedure are wrong and do not match ingredients to procedure. It took me quite some time of editing to make this recipe readable. Now to try and find out if it is actually doable.

I made two of these cakes for a Iron Chef contest with my bike riding group. They were made separately because of the complexity. The first one came out perfect and my girlfriend decorated it with baby ivy leaves since it's winter right now and difficult to find flowers. The taste was excellent. The second one was fraught with novice mistakes; I left the lemon juice out of the cake mix by mistake and I didn't keep the egg whites cold before I whipped them; they didn't whip as firmly as they should have. And the heavy cream wouldn't whip, probably for the same reason. So, because of the failed egg whites, the olive oil settled to the bottom of the cake instead of being uniformly suspended and it looked waterlogged. I only got a second place ribbon.

Thought this was really good, loved the lavender cream. If you're not too big on a strong lemon flavor like me then I would suggest cutting the amount of lemon curd used, possibly only putting in one layer. I would recommend this if you are more adventuresome with your food.

Delicious cake and incredible lemon curd, perhaps the best recipe I've made (and I am a big curd fan). However, I was less than impressed with the lavender cream. Following suggestions from other reviewers, I added more lavender than is called for (I realize this means I didn't follow the recipe to the letter) and found it a little more astringent than I'd like. The cake recipe itself is, however, delicious, and I think it would be more interesting to add a teaspoon or so of lavender directly in the cake and garnishing with a simple whipped cream, creme anglaise, &c. I would not make this recipe again exactly as it is written, but I would make the cake recipe. Delicious, rich and eggy.

I have made this twice: once as cupcakes(putting the lemon curd on top, and draping with the lavender cream), and once using three 8x1-inch layer pans. Both were amazing. Very worth the effort. Your kitchen will be drenched in the fragrance of Meyer lemons and lavender. The flavor combination is unmatched. I highly recommend this recipe to the adventurous cook.

Soooo not worth the effort!! I followed the recipe carefully. The cake was quite unattractive on its own, so I sprinkled the powdered sugar on top and added some small purple flowers from the garden. That was an improvement. Then, I attempted the cream. Other reviewers seemed to think that the honey caused the cream to separate, so when it happened to me, I thought the same. I tried again, this time with powdered sugar as the sweetener...it separated again! After all that effort, we ended up with a subpar lemon cake that took several hours to make. Never again!

This cake was fantastic. I made it just as directed, with an 8 inch springform pan. The cake looked pretty much like the photo, perhaps slightly shorter. The lavender cream was great, did not separate at all like some reviewers said, so I'm not sure what happened for them. I did as some others suggested and whipped the lavender cream to stiff peaks, tinted it a very pale lavender, frosted the whole thing and topped it with tiny pansies - it was a beautiful easter dessert and drew raves. No leftovers!

Betrayed! I've never made a worse cake -- what a waste of beautiful Meyers. The first problem is part my fault, part the recipe. At 45 minutes the cake was beautiful on top, looked gorgeous, and toothpick was clean. When I cut into it 1 hour later, the middle was uncooked! Beware bakers: bake at least 50 and probably more, and make sure you check the full depth (and yes, I keep an oven thermometer so I know I was at the right temperature). Second, the filling for this recipe is terrible. All that flour totally zaps the zest of the lemons. It comes out gelatinous and terribly bland -- like the inside of a bad lemon danish. Not that I'll ever make this again, but if I were, I'd substitute a curd. Finally, I found the cake, out of the pan, to be quite hideous looking. The whole thing went into the trash.

Not easy to make, but well worth the effort. I'm not a cake person, but this is one of the best cakes I've ever eaten. I've frosted the top of the cake with the lavender cream before serving. It keeps for a few days. All the delicious-ness of lemons, without the acidity. A light, not too sweet cake that is absolutely delicious.

Rating: 2
This worked well for me exactly as written (pan size included); I had no trouble with the cake sinking or the cream separating. The cream seemed too sweet on its own, but was good with the cake. It looks and tastes interestingly "adult" and "modern," a fun twist if you're tired of the usual layer cakes. Everything worked and the cake was good, but I probably won't make it again. I prefer my old, slightly more traditional not-too-sweet lemon layer cake recipe (from Dorie Greenspan's excellent "Baking: From My Home to Yours," if anyone's interested).

A lot of fuss for not so great a cake. I followed all the directions, and it came out fine, but just wasn't a winner for me. I noticed my guests didn't come back for more either. Certainly didn't think the lavendar whipped cream was anything special. p.s. I'd think twice about tinting the cream purple! Yikes!!

'grown-up cake' for sure! I made this last Easter and I can not get it out of my mind. This recipe is perfect, and of course baking takes practice. I think I may make this next week...olive oil is the best kept secret with baking. I use it in almost most of my baking now. Especially with gluten free--takes it to another level.

A friend made this cake last night. We had the same problem with the cream separating. I'm fairly certain it's from the honey, which is acidic--the way the cream separated looked just like when I add the acid to the milk to make ricotta or paneer. I imagine that some honeys are more acidic than others, hence the variability. If you don't want to take the risk, use sugar, or just drizzle honey over the serving at the end? Anyway, we called it "clotted cream" and pretended like we meant to do it, and everyone loved it. "A very grown-up cake," seemed to be the common feedback.

delicious! a strange thing happened with the lavender cream: it separated when i began whipping it...maybe i allowed it to cook too long with the honey and lavender? at any rate...it made what was basically sweet lavender butter--so i spread that on top and poured the whey on the bottom of the serving plate to soak into the cake. it was a really wonderful cake, despite the bumps in the road.

Awesome cake, although my filling wasn't quite sweet enough (my fault for not tasting enough while cooking it). Next time I'll use more sugar and make extra filling. The lavender cream makes it! There are lots of moving parts, but it's a fun cake to make. Don't be scared of three layers! Score an outline of the layers around the outside of the cake and make sure you use a serrated knife to follow the guide.

Excellent, light, cake. I used with regular lemons, and wished I had added more zest. I assembled the cake with the lemon curd and frosted (for a child's birthday cake) with lemon icing. It was delicious. I'll try next time decorating the cake with chocolate stars or serve with a ganache, rather than the lavander cream.

I see this is an updated recipe to the "lemon olive oil cake" on this site. It incorporates all the good adjustments that readers suggested on that recipe. The only thing I didn't find an improvement was the process of coating of the pan with butter. I see it's recommended to do this to create a clean side surface, but I actually prefer the rustic quality of how it comes out with just a coating of olive oil around the sides and on the parchment paper. I also used the lemon curd recipe on this site rather than the filling here, serving it and the lavender cream on the side. It was a hit!

Outstanding. The only change I made was using double the lavender blossoms in the cream, which was the perfect amount. If I had to do it again, I would use lavender oil so as to avoid straining. But it was an outstanding recipe, very moist cake. It was daunting cutting into three, but it holds together very well.

Made this recipe as written, and found an 8 inch pan to be just large enough, the cake was quite light in texture. Maybe I am not very dextrous, but I could only cut the cake in half (not thirds) so I put all the filling in between 2 layers. It didn't affect the flavor, which is delicious!

Made 4 cakes for Easter. The first did not look right so it was a taste test for my husband and plumber (poor guy happaened to be there). The oil sunk to the bottom of the cake, therefore very dense and the lemon curd was much too sour. So after some adjustments the next 3 were pretty good but still too much oil at the bottom of the cake. Any ideas how to fix that? I added more sugar to the next batch of curd and it was wonderful, great flavor and perfect consistency.

I really liked this recipe, I was a little nervous, being my first 'gourmet' cake. :) The fluffiness of my cake was not what I expected, but I had a smidge of yolk in with my whites and I am most certain that was the problem; I've seen eggs seperated before, but this was my first time... other than having a problem cutting 3 layers, it was great and everyone really loved it! With the cream...like a previous review said it really offset the tartness of the filling! I wanted to ice the cake with the cream, but I was worried it would seperate and/or soak into the cake, was that a problem for anyone? This was a lot of fun to make!!

This recipe is fabulous. The lavender cream is so decadent, like a gift from the heavens. I made this cake for Easter and it was a huge hit. I followed everything exactly with the exception of a few tweaks. I used several drops of lavender oil which made the flavor stronger in the cream and I added a dash of purple food coloring to give a hint of color. And then after I assembled the cake and sprinkled it with powdered sugar, I placed purple pansies (with yellow centers) on top. I recommend serving the cake and lavender cream with strawberries, it's a nice contrast of flavor and color.

I seem to be the only one who had trouble with this recipe. I have an 8" springform pan but it was clear from looking at the batter in the bowl that it was too small. I used a 9 1/2" pan and the cake when baked completely filled the pan. Even though the cake tested done, it sank a lot as it cooled. It had good flavor but the texture was somewhat dense. I had even more problems with the filling. It was way too tart, so I ended up adding quite a bit more sugar. Even though I added less salt than the recipe called for, it was still too salty. And it was so thin it ran down the sides of the cake when I put the layers together. On a more positive note, the people to whom we served the cake liked it and several came back for seconds. I was nervous about the lavender in the whipped cream but we liked it. The only complaint was that the lavender was too subtle and was overwhelmed by the honey.

I used a standard lemon curd, as I am familiar making them, and there were no Meyer lemons to be found around here. The cake was great and my guests al loved it. I had a 8.5 inch springform pan and decided it was a little too short to make 3 layers. Maybe I have hungry guests, but 5 people almost finished the cake.

I made the recipe exactly as written and found it ( as did the others who consumed it ) outstanding. I did have to use lavender oil ( very sparingly ) since it is still winter here, and that worked out quite nicely. I made it twice - once with an 8" springform and once with a 9". The 9" is too large for this recipe so don't try it without adjusting the ingredients. Contrary to another reviewer, we found the soft peak cream to be just right.

so i made the cake and filling exactly how the recipe calls for and they both came out perfect. although i think i am going to make the cake two layers instead of three. i havent made the cream yet but i think when i do i will tint it purple and frost the whole cake with it. my filling came out really thick and beautiful. i would def. recamend. will probably make again for another gathering.

I read the previous reviews before I made this cake. The 8 " size pan was perfect. I followed the recipe exactly for the curd and it came out nice and thick. I used canola oil instead of olive oil with wonderful results. I frosted the cake with whipped cream and left out the lavendar. It was an excellent, moist cake.

Hmmm -- am halfway through this endeavor. Used a 9-inch pan (didn't have 8), cake looks nice but is a shorty -- only two layers worth. Curd is thin no matter how much cooking. Plan to lighten with some whipped cream for the filling. Side will be the honey lavender ice cream from this site. Will report back on results.

I used the cream to frost the cake and it was delicious. Test the meyer lemon juice before making the filling-- mine were a little bitter and I probably should have added more sugar. I baked the cake in a 10 inch pan and increased the recipe by 1/2, but the cake fell so much when cooling that I could only make two layers, although it still had a nice texture.

I would give this cake 3.5 forks. This is a great cake but the lavendar cream is really heavy. I would beat the lavendar cream into stiff peaks and frost the cake with it, and use spare lemon slices and/or candied violets for decoration.

I made this cake with half maple sugar and half turbinado. As a result the cake wasnt a s fluffy as I'd have liked, but the taste was wonderful. The filling didn't come out quite right- I had to add extra butter. The lavendar cream was excellent and I added food coloring to tint it a light purple color. Great for a tea party! with a little recipe tweaking, I would make this again.
