This dish sounded so delicious, but the recipe was seriously lacking flavor and texture. I saved it by adding double the lemon zest, soy sauce and mirin to taste, giving it a smoother texture and more rounded and interesting flavor. I also used frozen spinach, which I think is much easier and just as tasty. I might also use some fresh ginger in it next time.

You better not be a vegan or a vegetarian if you plan to make this. It has dashi in it :)P.S--see reviews for dashi. there's a heated debate there! :)

Make sure you have enough spinach on hand to make this - it requires a ton! The lemon flavor is excellent - will make again the next time I can get my hands on some fresh spinach.
