I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. Even my husband, who is reluctantly turning his diet around, did not turn his nose up to these. Are they like deep fried, no of course not, but they do offer a really nice crunch, a sweet onion flavor and a touch of salt that satisfied our onion ring need. I used whole wheat pastry flour and soaked my onions in a ziploc bag. I also tried one batch on a wire rack and another on a greased cookie sheet. They both worked, though I actually preferred the non rack batch in that the bottoms were browned up more. A decent healthy alternative.
