I always have trouble with thumbprint type cookies flattening out during cooking and leaking jam everywhere. So when I tried this recipe, I had a Eureka! moment and decided to place the balls of dough in a mini muffin pan, make the depression, fill and bake. Voila! Perfect shape. Delicately browned. Delicious AND pretty. A happy first for me. The favorite among the various cookies I made for friends. Will make again at Christmas.

We just made these because they were on the Gourmet's Favorite Cookies list. My husband declared them one of his favorite cookies of all time. They really are like little strawberry tarts.

Very simple and very tasty. I used all different kinds of jelly. I would recommend coating in a coarse sugar before baking. It gives it more of a festive look.

These cookies are fabulous! A big hit with everyone. I rolled them in almonds and used different jams- strawberry, apricot, blackberry. Gorgeous and delicious.

My mom used to make these cookies every Christmas, except when she rolled them into balls, she would then roll them in toasted crushed almonds before making the thumbprint. Try it! They are sooooooo good and bring back lots of happy memories too.

These cookies are so simple to make, and they always come out fantastic. I made them last year, and everyone asked for them again this year. They are also great because you mix up the jams and have a huge variety of fruity, buttery, and slightly sweet cookies.

Easy, popular, and makes multitudes of cookies. I make these every Christmas as part of a huge batch of various cookies and they never turn out wrong (not even the first batch had problems). My little sisters love them and so will any people you make these for, including yourself! Use different jams as you choose.

Well it looked easy enough but i was a bit suspicious about adding so few wet ingredients... i ended up adding more butter cuz it just wouldn't come together, which made some lopsided and leak jam when they cooked, but they still had a wonderful flavor... what about adding whole eggs and not just egg yolks?

Beautifully buttery, but not too sweet!

I made these for a potluck/party and they disappeared so quickly! Everybody loved them... I used three different types of jam so there would be variety-- strawberry, apricot, and blueberry-- and they all turned out extremely well. Would definitely make these again!

These cookies were so good! I had a time trying to get the dough to come together, so I just dug my fingers in and it worked. Also, chilling makes the dough very hard, use your hands to soften it up after taking it out of the fridge.

My cookies came out great. This is an excellent tea cookie. My son thinks they look like eyeballs. They are delicious.

Easy recipe and great results! I used seedless blackberry jam and definitely added more per cookie than the recipe called for. I made much deeper indentations for this and they turned out wonderfully. My roommates are already asking for more.

These cookies were so yummy! I made a larger indentation to fit in more of the strawberry jam. I baked them for friends, and everyone thought they were store bought.

I replaced the strawberry with seedless raspberry jam; it was wonderful-not to sweet, slightly tangy. The cookie itself was soft and buttery; tasted even better the next day. I found that placing the dough in the freezer for 20 min did the job-the dough was just the right consistency to roll out. I ended up using the 1/2 tbsp measure and dug a deeper thumb hole for extra jam (1/4 + 1/8 of jam). Beautiful to look at, will make again!

wonderful cookies. very very tender and the perfect amount of sweetness. very similar to the taste of pepperidge farm fruitfuls. i do wish that they held their shape better - they flatten out a bit on the sheet. and resist the temptation to add more jam - though it may look otherwise when the cookies go in the oven, any more jam will run over. overall, delicious.

This cookie was so easy to make and turned out so yummy! For the cookie to turn out really good, I think you need to be sure to use a good quality jelly. I used Knott's Berry Farm 100% Fruit in Strawberry. I highly recommend this cookie!

Fantastic! I made these for the holidays and find myself making more batches now. Everyone is requesting more. I made bigger cookies and had a slight issue with jam running over the sides onto the pan but the problem was quickly remedied. I love these cookies.

I brought these cookies to my in-laws for Thanksgiving and they were a hit! I used raspberry jam instead of strawberry and made the cookies a little larger than teaspoon-size.

This cookies were wonderful. Most of the time when I bake something goes wrong and these were perfect. As a mistake I use tablespoon size balls instead of the suggested teaspoon size balls. These were a great size and did not make a hundred cookies (perfect size). So I suggest to make the balls larger. This cookies were delicious and I will make them again. Thank you.

What a disaster, these cookies did not have a tart like shape and instead had a complete melt down on my cookie pan. The cookies are crumbly and not even tasty. It is not often I have a disaster, but obviously I did something way wrong.

This treat was a blast from my past. It reminded me of how my grand-mother used to bake in her kitchen. Thank you. I WILL use this one again.
