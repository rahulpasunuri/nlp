Having never been to France or even heard of pompes sucrees, I can't make an informed comparison to the originals. I followed the recipe exactly except for cooking time; they only needed 12 minutes. These rolls reminded me a lot of "hot crossed buns" without the icing. Those were never one of my favorites. The anise flavor was subtle and pleasant, but I would add almost twice as much lemon and orange zest. They were also strangely yeasty. I wonder if two packets is really necessary. These will probably be okay eaten with preserves and tea, but they aren't interesting enough to stand on their own.
