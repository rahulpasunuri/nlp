This is an odd and flawed recipe. Its engineering appears off; I found that a "nest" of carmelized onions couldn't hold a large, raw egg within its bounds, and the white of a couple of our eggs ran out to burn on the baking sheet. In addition, two whole pitas were wasted, as it was superfluous to toast an upper portion to each sandwich...We just picked up the egg-laden sectors and ate. I chose this recipe as a way to use up left-over pancetta and other items that would have rotted in my crisper, like onions. If you should find yourself in the same position, take my husband's advice: "Let 'em rot!"
