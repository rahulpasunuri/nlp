recipe sounds better than it really is - "grand marnier", "compote" and "chantilly cream"!...it sounds so decadent. in fact, the combination was underwhelming. however, the biscuit recipe is a keeper. i'd use it again. otherwise not a memorable dessert.

The compote was nice but did not love the biscuit and the cream was just plain old whip cream, nothing special.There are much better desserts out there...keep looking.

Yum!great shortcake recipe, but didn't put gran marnier in strawberries and served with homemade vanilla ice cream rather than whip cream. It was a huge hit.

Our family adores shortcake & I was on a quest to find the perfect shortcake recipe. After trying SEVERAL of the shortcake recipes, this recipe was the winner. Cakes have perfect sweetness & texture. As noted in the recipe, I prepared & refrigerated the unbaked shortcakes the evening before baking them the next day with successful results.

I halved this recipe, and it made 5 rather large shortbreads. Really delicious, quick and easy. I made this with strawberries and blueberries. The Grand Marnier added a nice layer of flavor to the berries. Will definitely do again!

I rated the compote only - but I used orange juice instead of lemon - for the shortcake I used (on this site) bon appetit May 2008 - the one with cream cheese - it was very light on the inside and crisp on the outside -

I only made the strawberries portion of the recipe and served it with store-bought pound cake. The strawberries are exceptional.

Nice dessert. Great for picnics or potlucks! The cakes themselves could have been a tad more moist (I know they are supposed to be a little dry to absorb the strawberry juice). Second time I made it, I added 1 egg for levity and cooked them for less time, and that did the trick.

Made this for my son's birthday. As he is a non-drinker, I made it with orange juice. It was fantastic, easily the best strawberry shortcake I've ever had (and I have had many)!

quite possibly the BEST dessert I have ever made....said by all 13 of my Mother's Day guests. I doubled the sugar amount and let marinate 24 hrs. Phenomenal!

I brought this to a potluck dinner party (assembled the shortcakes there). The guests loved, loved, loved this dessert! The buttermilk adds so much to the texture of the biscuits and the lemon zest makes it so fresh. I baked them in my convection oven in about 9 minutes. I also added 2 tablespoons of minced mint to the strawberries, as I have lots of mint in my garden. I reduced the amount of Grand Marnier to a 1/4 cup as suggested by a few other reviewers, eliminated the salt and increased the sugar to 2/3 cup. I drained the juice from the strawberries before plating, as there was too much of it for my taste. This is a great spring/summer dessert and could be made with other seasonal fruits. It isn't overly filling and doesn't take that long to prepare.

This recipe has WAY too much alcohol. I guess it's okay for people who are used to it, but my family was really turned off by it. I really prefer the other strawberry shortcake recipe with mint -- that is GREAT!! For those of you who do not like a strong alcohol taste should steer clear of this one.

Made these for a friend's birthday (she requested strawberry shortcake) and everyone loved. Basket of biscuits, bowl of strawberries with a side of whipped cream. yum!

I have made both this and the 'Shortcakes with mint and whipped cream'. I find the shortcake tastier in the other recipe and the strawberries tastier in this recipe, although there was too much liquid. So I will mix the recipes from now on.

I used thsi biscuit recipe and loved it! A bit richer and slightly sweeter then others. It had a great taste on it's own. I made two large biscuits by splitting the dough in half and baking a bit longer. Made a nice presentation.

I let the strawberries sit in the Grand Marnier for half the day: a lot of the alcohol evaporated leaving behind the fantastic flavor of the liquor. This was a big hit at my dinner party and I am passing this recipe on!

I thought this recipe looked fantastic when I saw it. Tried it for a friend's birthday and was not disappointed. That said, there are a couple of things I would do differently if making it again: first, I thought the strawberries were way too heavy on the Grand Marnier, and I am someone who usually *likes* the added kick of liqueur in desserts. I would cut down the quantity added to a quarter cup if making this again, knowing I could always add more if I wanted it. Also, I might try incorporating the Marnier into the cream, instead of putting it in the compote. Second, I served these after the shortcakes had cooled down almost completely. They were still warm-ish, but would have been much better if they had been warmer. Delicious. (By the way, the lemon zest makes these shortcakes to-die-for. The scent of them baking in the oven is practically reason enough to make this recipe!)

This is so easy and so delicious! I've made this several times for different family get-togethers and it is always a huge hit. All my relatives are "foodies" and they have all requested this recipe - the highest form of praise in this group.
