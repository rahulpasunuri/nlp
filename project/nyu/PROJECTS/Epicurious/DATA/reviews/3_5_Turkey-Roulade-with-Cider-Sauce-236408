Excellent alternative to a whole bird, though it certainly serves at least six people. I had the butcher butterfly the breast for me.

Excellent Thanksgiving turkey for two! This is our Thanksgiving turkey of choice from here on out. The sauce was out of this world. Thank you for a great holiday.

I have to admit that I am not an expert at butterflying meat or roulades. My end product looked nothing like the photo (and certainly nothing like the one done this year on Top Chef) though it was still quite attractive on the plate. With this in mind, my stumbling effort actually turned out an excellent dish. I started out with a rough cut pocket into which I placed the stuffing.(I hate chicken livers so I substituted oyster and shitake mushrooms ) After it roasted in high heat, I found it to be a bit unweilding. I then wrapped it tightly in parchment paper, setting it back on the rack to finish it's turn in the oven. Everything else went smoothly and I was pleased to unwrap it and find it was moist, flavorful and the dressing was not soggy. I think that the mushrooms were a great asset. My sole complaint ( other than my inexperience in the technical aspects of this dish) was that the gravy was a bit salty. I would however make this again.

I thought this would be a good alternative for a small group, but it wasn't worth effort. I found the turkey to be bland and the stuffing wasn't very tasty. Overall, it was a disappointment.

This is a great technique for serving a smaller group. I found that it served more than expected. The meat was delicious, although alittle dry. I think cooking the internal temp to 170 degrees was high. I will make this again, but pull the turkey out at 160, like I do when I cook a whole chicken. Also, due to the longer cooking period, I wouldn't add the juice in the pan until ready to make the gravy, when you have taken the breast from the pan. The pan juices carmelized and burned in the bottom of the pan, causing the gravy to taste burnt, salty, and concentrated. The stuffing is delicious, but I used a dash of chicken livers, due to the strong flavor, and the flavor was just enough. The skin was crunchy and yummy. All in all, really good. I will make this again, but using more of my intuition. Cheers!

Veru good, but a bit labor intensive. I substituted bourbon for the sherry and left out the chicken livers.
