This has become one of our staple meals. Easy prep, especially if we just buy one of the roasted chickens at the grocery store. It also works well to make a bunch of the stuffing and freeze it.

We did half the recipe and it was good for three bell peppers stuffings. We are in NZ right now, and so couldn't find mild green chilies, but it was still good without it.

I was out of both cayenne and paprika, so I substituted a pre-blended cajun spice I had in the cupboard. It worked great! Gave it just enough kick. This recipe was simple and yummy. Will definitely make again.

This was a delicious way to use extra peppers from our garden! The only change I made was using a combination of fresh jalapeno/serrano peppers in place of the mild green chilies. The full recipe perfectly filled 4 peppers and I found the 50 min cooking time to be perfect. Would definitely make again!

I adjusted this one slightly. I'm allergic to dairy, so I omitted the cheese. Had hot peppers on hand, but forgot to throw them in. Will try them next time. Still very tasty!

These were ok, but I didn't go nuts over them. I made a few alterations, which may be why...I used diced fresh tomato instead of tomato sauce -made them a bit too dry and bland. I also added a 1/4 cup of white rice. I'll try them again by the recipe. Live and learn.

My trainer at the gym told me to eat chicken and vegetables for dinner and this recipe was perfect. It is delicious, healthy and filling. I left out the green chilies and thought it was great without them. I also used very big green peppers so this was not enough filling for 8 of them.

My husband thought it was delicious. I used some of the reader's hints and used fresh jalapenos & a little chili sauce. I halved the recipe - plenty for two people. A good low-carb recipe.

We had pasta salad, sweet potato soufle and sourdough french bread for sides. It was the perfect meal.

All you need to do to make this recipe totally yummy, is add about 1/4 cup of spicy chili sauce! Also, make sure to use extra old cheddar.

This just what I consider a work horse recipe. Not good enough for a special occation but nice for our take to work lunches through the week. I changed It a bit, used salsa jack instead of cheddar, chopped fresh jalapenos instead of canned. I found the full recipe enough to fit nicely into 5 peppers. Baked only 20 min as not to overcook the peppers. Yummy.

It needs more spice, I found it rather bland. I halfed the recipe and found only enough stuffing to fill two peppers.

this recipe was a nice change to the standard stuffed peppers, try maranating the chicken then BBQing it this adds a nicer flavour

This is boring. There are better recipes out there.

Awesome! And super easy! My mom, who doesn't even like peppers, raved about this one. I threw the chicken on grill to add more flavor.

There was nothing wrong with this recipe - there are just many better ones on this website. It is a good way to use up leftover turkey.

This recipe became a very popular one! Even people who didn't like bell peppers loved the stuffing! My only complaint is the cooking time overdid the bell peppers, but on the whole, I rate this recipe as 3 forks. 4 forks being pure Nirvana.
