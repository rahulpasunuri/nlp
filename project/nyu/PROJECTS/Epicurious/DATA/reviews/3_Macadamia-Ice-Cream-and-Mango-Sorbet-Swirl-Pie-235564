Just one a pie competition with this pie-added some fresh mango and it was lovely!

Oh, I didn't know it would take review without a fork rating. I gave it two forks because of what is sounded like. Did YOU make it?

Cooks from Chicago and Canton ~ how can you give a recipe a fork rating if you have not ever MADE the recipe? A rating should be an opinion of the completed recipe ~ No?

You do not need to make the ice creams they are both made by Haggen Daz. Its really not that hard!

Well, it LOOKS great to me but could you at least tell us who makes macadamia brittle ice cream or mango sorbet. I, for one, would NOT want to have to make it!

Again with the premade recipe mixes. TELL US HOW TO MAKE THE ICE CREAM! I'm about done with Epicurious.

This is very refreshing summer dessert appropriate after any great meal. It's simple to make, yet gets lots of raves!
