This was the worst recipe I have ever found on Epicurious. It was such a waste of fresh monkfish and scallops. My spouse wouldn't eat it. The taste of the fennel was overpowering. The texture was awful and the topping was really an afterthought. I followed the recipe exactly.

My husband, son and I loved this-I used lightly smoked salmon and monkfish instead of scallops and shrimp, and omitted the tomatoes, basil and fennel seed. I also substitued fish stock for the clam juice, and added a splash of cooking sherry and some dill. I could have cooked it a tad longer, as the pastry was a little heavy in places. But all in all this is a keeper!

My family loves this recipe! Love the puff pastry but we like it as monkfish stew too.

Bland, bland, bland. What a waste of good fish and puff pastry. Also the tomato in not anywhere in the recipe itself. Don't waste your time......
