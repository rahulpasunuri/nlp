To me, this seemed like a heavy-handed preparation for the delicate nature of veal scallops. It dressed up a beautful, velvety texture in a gaudy and unneccessary lemon and thyme costume. There was no need to finish the veal in the sauce. It was so much more delectable after the initial pan-fry. If you want to go "healthy" with veal, I would save the trouble that this recipe presents. Dredge in flour, cook 1 minute per side, and serve with a lemon wedge on the side. You can add a little thyme to the flour but again, too much will get in the way of the beautiful simplicity.

My boyfriend and I LOVE this recipe (with the changes suggested by others of doubling the amount of sauce and increasing the lemon). We make it all the time and never tire of it--served over angel hair or with cheesy risotto--spectacular!

Loved this recipe!! Easy and quick to prepare with a wonderful flavor and low fat content. Did listen to the helpful suggestions to double the sauce and increase the lemon amount. My husband wanted to give this 5 forks. This is a true keeper!!

I definately prefer this recipe with increased amounts of lemon, sherry, and a little extra chicken broth to have more sauce with the dish--but it's a great, quick recipe! Loved by guests!

My husband raved about this one. Nice when you get compliments for such an easy dish. Asparagus seem like the perfect side dish.

This really is a fabulous recipe. I did however use beef consume rather than chicken broth because I prefer the 'meaty' flavor. Also I sliced one lemon and added it to the sauce 2 minutes before it as all done. I wouls also recommend doubling the sauce as it is truly beautiful meshing witth other things on your plate. We absolutely love this recipe. Enjoy

Very flavorful. Doubling the sauce is a great idea. Best of all, it's quick to prepare and it's healthy.

I have used both chicken and veal for this recipe. I absolutley love the sauce for this. I triple the amount of lemon in it. It is also great because it doesn't add any fat to the dish, unlike my other favorite cream sauces.

This was a very flavorful dish. I had some fresh rosemary as well as thyme growing, so I added a bit of the rosemary to the flour with the thyme. I also added about a tablespoon of minced shallot with the garlic. I know I will prepare it again.

I chose this recipe one evening because it seemed rather simple. I discovered I was missing an ingredient, Sherry, so I substituted Dry Marsala. Voila!!!! It tasted just like veal marsala to me. We'll save this recipe in our recipe box!!!

Wow, This a great veal recipe. Will be making this again and again. Chardonnay is the perfect wine to go with this.

I made this recipe for Valentine's Day and my husband ate every bite and asked for more. I served it with roasted asparagus and wild rice. Easy, delicious and impressive.

My husband and I made this dish recently after not having made it for several years! Delicious! We asked ourselves why we could have stopped making it (2 small kids!)

Spectacular! This is an impressive dish. My husband asked me to marry him again after this one - definitely try it out!

The customers of the Colonial Rose Inn restaurant love this veal dish. The sauce is light, but has plenty of flavor. We serve over cappellini. We'll keep this on our summer menu.
