Based on the reviews, perhaps my expectations were unreasonably high, but I found this soup to be just a somewhat unusual vegetable soup -- not bad but not extraordinary. I made it according to the recipe except my 2 pounds of favas, once shelled, blanched and skinned (time consuming!), only made 1 cup. I had more asparagus so I added that to make up for the missing favas, perhaps changing the balance of flavors. I think this soup depends highly on the quality of broth used.

Really lovely spring soup. I wanted something with a little more kick, so I added some green garlic in the last minute of sauteing the carrots and leeks. I also threw in a parmesan rind instead of adding parmesan at the end, which worked just as well. I used homemade vegetable stock, which was important because the stock plays such a big role and should be high quality! I like the idea of pureeing some of the solids to create something a little thicker, as suggested by one of the other reviewers, so I'll try that next time.

Delicious! I made this as a first course and then a sausage/mushroom/red wine ragout over broiled polenta discs as a second course. The dishes worked really well together! I ended up adding more chicken stock than recommeneded to the soup because it was a bit too dense with all the veggies. Absolutely delicious!!!

Made recipe as written, although did not add the "optional" Parmesan. What a great, healthy dish!

Great soup! We added fresh tortellini to make it more of a meal. But had to double the veggie stock because the tortellini absorbed so much broth. Also, couldn't find fresh or frozen lima beans so used 1 can butter beans. I was worried they'd get soggy so added them at the end, but I think that mean they didn't have as much flavor. I think I would do 1.5-2 cans beans next time and add them when the recipe indicated. Overall, this was great and fresh and made enough to serve 2 for dinner, with leftovers for lunch the next day.

Substituted 1/2 can canary beans + 1/2 can black eye peas (pureed) for the fava beans. Did not have 2/3 cup basil, so just added what I had. Added a squeeze of lime. Delicious. My husband (who doesn't like soup) loved it.

pureed 1 cup of solids and returned to pot....delicious and a perfect spring evening dinner with crusty bread

The soup was good, the basil gives it a fresh taste..I would definitely cut back on the amount of lima/fava and green beans, possibly one less leek, because the broth had a great flavor and I thought it was overcrowded by the beans. It depends on your taste--it almost seems like a meal, so if you like a hearty soup make as is..I was more in the mood of a soup (with more broth) and that's why I'd cut back the beans by half..

This is a surprising soup. All the ingredients would seem to add up to something bland or "too vegetable-y". But (using chicken broth) it is really delicious. It's the kind of soup that doesn't have a lovely, attractive look to it: like people won't gather at the stove and say "I can't wait", because it has a thin look to it, but then when they taste it, I think, like me, they'll love it. Appearances in this case are deceiving. It is really delicious and so simple and quick to make. I recommend it. It is listed as a "first course" but I think with a nice dense, dark leafy salad, it would be a fine main course.

This soup was great and easy. I used the frozen lima beans and actually left out the green beans when I ran out of room in the pot. It still was delicious and full of flavor.

This is a wonderful recipe which I have made numerous times to rave reviews. Freshly grated imported parmesan and a homemade chicken stock add tremendous depth. For a decorative touch, I have placed edible Australian violets on top of the soup just before service

This is a very simple and tasty way to use spring veggies. I used frozen lima beans, as suggested, in place of the fava beans and floated large croutons made from a baggette in the soup when served. Light but filling on a cool spring evening.
