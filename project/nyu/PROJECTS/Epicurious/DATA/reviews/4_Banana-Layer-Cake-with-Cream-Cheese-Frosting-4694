I didn't use the cream cheese frosting (coconut instead) but the cake was really delicious, and went over well with the mass of toddlers at my daughter's birthday party.

This cake was pretty good; I didn't really like the frosting due to there was too much sugar, too much butter flavor. the cake was a bit dry so i may change technique a bit.

I'm not getting all the rave reviews on this cake. I followed the recipe exactly except that I added an extra mashed banana, as many reviewers recommended. The cake did not rise very much, and, although I baked it for under the recommended time, I found it dry. I thought the frosting was OK but lacking a really rich cream cheese taste. I have often used a Martha Stewart banana cake recipe, and I'll go back to that one.

This is it - THE banana cake: gorgeously moist, wonderfully banana-y, rich but not sickeningly sweet. And easy to make as well (although beware the slightly confusing instructions - the butter and vanilla are meant for both the cake and the frosting). Like other posters, I made two layers in 9" cake pans and used about a quarter cup more banana, but kept everything else exactly the same. Cake flour is unavailable in the EU, but I used Italian 00 flour with perfect results.

Needed a low sugar cake and made this with very lightly sweetened vanilla whipped cream instead of the frosting. Layered the cake with freshly sliced (firmer) bananas and whipped cream, then drizzled with a scant Tbl of fleur de sel caramel sauce. The usually finicky 1 year old birthday boy dove right in!

This cake is DE-LISH!! I've made it several times now and it always comes out perfect. Like others I use three VERY ripe bananas. Have varied frosting and filings (chocolate, caramel icings, pecans, walnuts, coconut - you name it). Moist and flavorful every time!

Oh my goodness - this is a wonderful cake!! I followed the recipe except used more banana (1 1/2 cups) - My husband described it best - it's like eating banana pudding (but even better if that's even possible!) Made this for a friend for her birthday - and didn't even think I liked Banana Cake - I'm a convert - Also - I was a little dubious about slicing the banana between the layers - I'm so glad I tried it - just adds more flavor - Also - I cut the sugar in the icing back by about 1/2 cup and toasted some pecans to sprinkle on the top - This is a keeper!!

This cake was absolutely delicious!! Moist banana goodness. The recipe was enough to yield 18 cupcakes. I will definitely make again with probably a pinch of cinnamon. Definitely worth trying!

Rating: 4
I increase the recipe by half again, as what's there is really not enough to yield 3 good layers. For the cream cheese frosting, I use 3 8 oz packs of Philly Cream cheese, 11/2 sticks butter and about 1 1/2 - 1 3/4 C confectioners sugar plus about 2 tsp high quality vanilla. I don't like it too sweet. I've embellished the recipe by topping each layer with toasted coconut and a pecan/walnut mixture that I've rolled in salt, butter, honey and sugar then toasted for 10 minutes in the oven. They add a nice sweet/salty flavor balance and a wonderful texture to the cake. I serve it as a "stacked" cake... frosting only inbetween the layers, but not the sides. Finally, to geld the lily even further, I serve it with a hard caramel sauce of some sort. The last time, I happened to have some bananas foster sauce left over, so I used that.... this time, I'll make a brandied or rum caramel sauce with sugar, butter and rum. As you can see, the recipe offers great flexibility. Most importantly, the foundation cake is delicious! All guests loved it!

I made this for a birthday party recently and several people told me it was the best cake they'd ever had. I used three bananas and two 8" cake pans (plus a couple of cupcakes for me to keep). The cake pans took about 25 minutes to fully bake through (cupcakes I took out around 20 minutes in). Kept in the fridge overnight and was moist and fresh-tasting the next night. I didn't use this frosting, btw--used the coconut cream cheese frosting from the Banana Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting recipe also on this site.

Rating: 4
REALLY ripe bananas give superb flavor, but I found that I needed THREE mashed bananas to equal one cup. A sprinkle of walnuts on top gives a finished presentation. You won't regret a little scoop of ice cream on the side, either.:) I have made this layered delight twice. YUMMY!!!!

Really disappointing! Not nearly enough banana flavor. This cake had the slightest taste of banana, not the pronounced banana flavor I was hoping for.

Rating: 4
I'm not typically a banana fan, but this was pretty good. The cake was light and moist with a strong banana flavor. I love the frosting and I had to dump the extra down the drain before I made myself ill with gluttony. I adjusted the recipe per other's suggestions as follows. 1. I baked two 9" layers. 2. I used a lot less butter in the frosting. I also added a touch of allspice to the frosting, but I'm not sure this is an improvement. 3. I used yogurt instead of buttermilk. 4. I put banana pudding and fresh banana slices in middle and frosted only the outside of the cake. I think that a frosting layer in the middle would have been too much frosting. 5. In order to guarantee a moist cake, I almost doubled the banana mash in the batter (just shy of 2 cups) and used about a 1/2 cup yogurt instead of 1/4 cup buttermilk. If I made it again, I think I would add some spiced rum to the batter for a more "gourmet" flavor.

Very yummy. I needed a quick dessert so I cut the recipe in half and used a 8x11 glass baking dish. As soon as it was cool, just frosted the top and served - my husband LOVED it ! Very smooth cake with great creamy frosting.

Delicious! It was enough batter for 16 cupcakes. The cake was moist and banana-y, and the creamy, not-to-sweet frosting complemented the banana flavor. I also toasted some walnuts and sprinkled them on top, which added some texture. Definitely hit the spot for a banana craving =)

Fantastic and very easy with most ingredients on hand at all times. Served it to company and everyone raved. Only change I made was to the frosting, used 2 8oz pkgs cream cheese, 1 stick butter, 1 1/4 cup powdered sugar and some vanilla (sorry didn't measure). Frosting was perfect. Drizzled the top with some purchased caramel sauce... YUM

This makes quite an impressive dessert. I've served this a few times now for dinner parties. I smash up banana chips and coat the sides with them for a really impressive banana treat.

This cake was wonderful. The flavor and texture were perfect. I love making family birthday cakes from scratch and try to vary them a lot. My daughter-in-law has already requested that I repeat this one for her birthday which is the next one on our list. She requested that I add a few chocolate chips since she loves the banana-chocolate flavor.

Rave reviews for this, and so happy to have good banana cake recipe! I did make only two 9 inch layers, and altered the icing by using 1 cream cheese and 1 stick butter and a dabble of whipping cream w/ about 2 Cups powdered sugar...was pleased w/result. Hope readers will appreciate flexibility w/icing.

Rating: 2
Just ok. The cake was drier than we prefer, and the rich sweetness of the fresh banana filling is a little weird against the slight tartness of the cream cheese icing.

Rating: 3
My cake ended up a little dry, possibly overcooked, although I checked it at 15 minutes and it was still gooey. 20 minutes may have been too much. I really liked the frosting, however, it was a nice combo or cream cheese frosting and buttercream. I did add an extra cup of powdered sugar and it still was only lightly sweet to my taste. Next time I'll make 2, 9" layers, cook them less and then cut them in 1/2 for 4 layers since the banana/frosting filling was nice. I also added chopped, toasted walnuts to the sides which looked and tasted good.

Rating: 4
I made these as cupcakes but misread the instructions and put 3 sticks of butter in the cake better. Needless to say I threw the first batch out. I remade them and they were great. One recipe made 16 cupcakes. For the frosting I only needed 1 package of cream cheese and ended up using just 2 tablespoons of butter and the full amount of sugar. The frosting was not too rich or sweet and I got rave reviews from several folks at the party.

Delicious. I make a lot of cakes, including decadent chocolate ones and this is the one that gets the most requests. I serve it with caramel frosting (brown sugar boiled with butter and milk then finished with vanilla and powdered sugar) and everyone raves. Makes fabulous cupcakes. Great with Ina Garten's (Barefoot Contessa) coconut cupcakes for a tropical themed party.

Excellent and very easy to make! Everyone really liked it. I made it as a birthday cake for my mom. I made it in 2 8-inch pans, as that was all I had. I made a 2-layer cake and used the extra icing to cover the top and sides completely and tinted a little frosting pink to use for a border and writing. Also, for the frosting, I only used 1 atick of butter and used about 3 1/2 cups of powdered sugar. I will definitely make this again. Takes great for how easy it is to make.

Rating: 3
Really, really good. I subbed vanilla yogurt for the buttermilk (not going to run to the store for 1/4 cup of buttermilk) and, as some other reviewers suggested, used 2 sticks of butter. Baked in 2 9" pans. The cake was wonderful, and my new go-to recipe in a family that often requests banana cake for special occasions. I did not make the cream cheese icing. Instead I frosted with vanilla bean buttercream and filled with chocolate buttercream, both a compromise between American, powdered sugar based frosting and French cooked butter based frosting that I found in Cook's Illustrated. Really, really good.

Rating: 4
The only deviation I made from this recipe was to make it a 2-layer 9" cake, and the end product was amazing. I filled the cake with Vanilla Pastry Cream, from this site, to which I added 2T banana extract. I felt that the frosting inside and out would have been redundant. The cream was a refreshing textural change. I served this at a party and it was loved by all - note that this fed way beyond the suggested serving amount. I believe I was able to cut it into 15 2" slices.

This cake recipe is easy and delicious. I made it for the first time today and served it for a dinner party--it was a big hit. To the batter, I added a third large banana and substituted vanilla yogurt for the buttermilk (adjusted vanilla extract in the cake batter to 1/2 tsp. and added 1/2 tsp. of milk for liquid). I added 1/4 more powdered sugar to the icing to make it stiffer and sweeter. Finally, I baked just two layers (in 9" pans) and used a lot of icing between the layers (at least a cup, maybe more) and still had icing leftover. The cake was moist, full of banana flavor--perfect. Thanks to the other reviewers for their suggestions!

I found the frosting to be quite tangy tasting (like sour cream) so I would be tempted to cut down on the butter in the frosting recipe. The recipe calls for 2-8 oz pkgs of cream cheese and 2 sticks of butter, and then the powdered sugar. That really does seem like alot of butter. The cake layers seemed a bit dry to me so I would probably bake them a little less next time. They were sort of thin so that could be why they dried out a little in baking. Everyone raved about the cake in general. I didn't think it was the best cream cheese frosting. Next time I will top it with a different cream cheese frosting recipe.

Rating: 4
This cake was awesome! I made it for my sons first birthday party (a monkey theme) and it was a HUGE hit with the kids and adults! I substituted brown sugar everywhere it called for white, including in the frosting. I also made my layers very thin, 3- 9 in. pans, but I thought it was really light and well distributed with the frosting and bananas. I absolutely LOVED this cake!

Rating: 4
Delicious and (relatively) quick to prepare! I made this cake for a picnic gathering and received rave reviews - even though I frosted before the layers were completely cool. It sliced much better after a few hours in the fridge! I did make a couple of additions after viewing some similar recipes: added about a tablespoon of rum (in my case, a coconut rum) to the cake batter, and added coconut in between layers and as decoration on top of the cake. Subtle, but amped up the flavor a little.

Rating: 4
I first made this back in '97 for my daughter's birthday at daycare...not a piece came home! Lots of complements. I did make my own cream cheese icing. Everyone always loves it and it rarely lasts 2 days. If I don't make banana bread, this is the cake to make. I might try the extra butter, but would rather keep the fat down.

Rating: 4
Read the recipe carefully. I found that the recipe as written to be confusing. I took some tips from the previous reviewers. 1. Works well as 2-9" layers. Try baking for 23-25 minutes depending on your oven. 2. I used Neufchatel, reduced fat cream cheese with great results. 3. Be sure to taste the frosting, I ended up using an additional 1 cup (then sifting) powdered sugar. I took this cake to work for a Birthday and received 3 email requests for the recipe within 10 minutes of serving it. The overall flavor is reminiscent of our beloved Beaverton Bakery's Banana cake. This cake will definitely stay in my repertoire!

Rating: 4
This was THE best cake I've ever made! I followed the recipe exactly except I used regular flour in place of cake flour. I've never used cake flour so I'm not sure what the difference would be. I think I may have used a bit too much frosting between layers because I could have used more to frost the outside of the cake. A nice garnish on top of the cake would definately make it stunning. Maybe some strawberries with a bit of sauce on top? This cake got rave reviews from co- workers. Definately a keeper!!

Rating: 4
I thought this was a very good cake! I was a little worried at first about the very thin layers, but it actually turned out to be very light. I did add a little banana extract along with my bananas since I had to make it before they turned black. I made it with a vanilla custard filling with the banana slices and it was a very tasty version.

Excellent! I followed the recipe precisely and thought it had plenty of banana flavor from the layer of fresh bananas. Big hit with my mother-in-law, who loves bananas.

Since I have 3 9 inch pans but not 3 8 inch pans, I estimated that I needed to increase the recipe by a third. It made fairly thin layers, but still nice. I realzied that after the cake was in the oven, it would have been nice with chocolate chips in the batter. So, instead, I made a chocolate ganache, covered the sliced bananas with it, put that between the layers, and then added some of the frosting on top of that. I did not increase the amount of the frosting, and there was still enough. Had several complements on the result.

Rating: 3
I fed this cake to my family, and they thought it was delicious - but it was a little bit frustrating to make. My cakes were very fragile and they totally fell apart during the transfer from the pan to the rack to the plate - Not sure if this was because I used extra banana, as suggested by other reviewsers, or because of my addition of chopped walnuts. (But I managed to glue my cakes together pretty well with the frosting.) Also, the frosting is very cream-cheesey... could use a bit more powdered sugar.

I made this for my daughters first birthday party and it was a huge hit. I made minor changes based on previous reviewrs - used 3 bananas instead of two and a vanilla bean instead of extract. I also replaced the buttermilk with yogurt. The frosting seemed to make just the right amount. It was necessary to leave the frosted cake in the fridge for an hour or so to let the frosting set. Everyone loved it and said they would not change a thing. It was not too sweet which is why I think we all enjoyed it so much.

I just made this recipe for Easter dinner and got RAVE reviews. Made it exactly as the recipe says and it was delicious. A note to some other reviewers: cooking is not about overthinking things. Sometimes the simplest way is to leave things just as they are. I changed nothing about this recipe - it was perfect.

Rating: 2
After seeing the reviews I had to give this recipe a try! I added an extra banana as others suggested and I thought it came out tasting like banana bread and there wasn't much banana flavor at all. I also made a half recipe of the frosting which was the perfect amount, but I thought it tasted very bland and had to add more powdered sugar. I think I will give this recipe one more shot, but instead of adding another banana I'd rather add more butter or buttermilk and then some banana extract as another reviewer suggested.

This cake makes a wonderful presentation. I used more frosting than the suggested 1/2 cup between layers. The frosting recipe made more than enough for the cake. In addition to the vanilla, I also added banana extract to both the cake and frosting recipes. Also, I added 1 more mashed banana to the cake recipe. I will definately make the cake again! Happy Baking!

thanks to other reviews I read the recipe first so I knew not to add all the butter to the cake batter. Also used 3 large bananas and added about 1/4 cup of extra powdered sugar (i like it sweet) to the frosting. Added sliced bananas & frosting between layers,(be generous w/frosting between layers, you will have enough) I did 2- 9" rounds. FABULOUS!! You have to make this cake. Co-workers raved. Will definately make again.

I made this in a 9/13 pan to give to friends. I did take the advice of others, and increased the bananas. I used three good sized ones, without measuring. I also used plain yogurt instead of the buttermilk (we were out). I didn't get to taste it, but it smelled wonderful, and they've already requested the recipe. Oh yes, it's a very poorly written recipe! The butter needs to be divided (1 stick for the cake, and 2 for the frosting--which didn't really need that much, but I had it out already), and the vanilla as well (my cake had the entire amount in the batter before I realized this!) I'll definitely make again, however.

After wading through pages of the reviews, I did the unthinkable -- I tried it in two loaf pans. Set the timer for 10 min, 10 min, 5 min, 4 min ad nauseum. Cried at thirty minutes and kicked myself for ruining the effort, but trudged on. After 42 minutes, I pulled out two beautiful loaves. Planned on serving slices with peach ice cream or whipped cream, but a glass of milk was all my husband wanted. What a great way to use up very ripe bananas!

I have made this cake twice now and I have found that if you bake it longer than 23 minutes, you will overbake it and it will be dry. 20 minutes was just a bit too short and 25 made it a bit too dry. If I was more of an expert baker, I would try to figure out how to add another banana to give it a bit more banana flavor. Maybe next time I will just add it. Also, I do not use the cream cheese frosting, but I use the recipe found on this site for Fudge Frosting (leave out the cinnamon, it is not a good combination).

This cake seemed like a recipe handed down for generations. Yes, it was dense like a banana bread. The sweet frosting offset the density. My family loved it and I will make it again for certain.

Wow! I don't know what happened, but I was very disappointed with this recipe! After reading the previous reviews, I was looking forward to trying this cake. I suppose that I could have done something wrong, but I checked and re-checked the recipe and couldn't find any errors on my part. Like the other reviewers, I did find the layers to be thin so made 1 1/2 batches. Unfortunately, I just didn't care for the consistency of the cake. It was very dense without being very moist. It wasn't overcooked, so I don't think that was the problem. In any event, I will not take the time or effort to try this one again. (As a side note, I found this recipe listed with Gourmet magazine, but with some slight differences. It was from the same restaurant, so I don't know why it was different.)

I made this cake last weekend and it was fantastic. The cake is very rich and tasty. The frosting is out of this world, very creamy and rich, also. I used whole milk instead of buttermilk and regular flour instead of cake flour with good results.

The recipe made two thick layers. I'd try 3 round layer pans the next time. The frosting was not so appealing to me, and the cake did was great plain! I'll make the cake again, and leave it plain like a banana bread, and just spead cream cheese on slices of it.

This cake is delicious! The taste is reminiscent of banana pudding, except it makes a much better presentation. I did use 2% milk instead of buttermilk, which worked out fine. Overall it was a simple cake to prepare. I will definately keep this recipe to make on many different occasions. I can't wait to make it for friends and family!

I used 4 cake layers instead of three and shortened the baking time to 16 minutes. Because of the extra layer, I did not have any extra frosting like some of the other reviewers. It was a big hit with several guests eating a second helping later in the evening.

Excellent recipe! Everyone loved it though it is a heavy cake so don't make the slices too big. I also had a little extra icing. I will definitely make this again - presentation was wonderful.

Ok - but I wanted more.

Very light and not too sweet. Had extra frosting (which my husband, kids & I happily ate with a spoon!) so next time I'll put a little more than called for between the layers.

This was a fabulous favorful cake. The frosting is one to use on any cake you make, but especially compliments this cake. Very moist and great made the day before.

This cake was fantastic. It was easy to make and the flavor and presentation are great. It was just as good if not better 2 or 3 days later. I sprinkled chopped walnuts on top. Also, it was easy to make.

I have made this cake many times and each times it had rave reviews. It can easily be made the night before and keeps well when covered. It is an excellent choice ofr those who do not usually eat dessert as it is light and tasty.

This is one of the most popular cakes with my customers. I love it! Works well in a 9 x 13 pan, too.

I served this at a party and everyone loved it! Couldn't believe how moist it was for a white cake. Delicious. Good with strawberries on top too.
