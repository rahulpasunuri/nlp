Thanks to previous reviewers, I doubled the bacon and added about a teaspoon of crushed caraway seeds. Excellent suggestions. The only change I made was to leave out the butter in the filling and cook the onions in a couple tablespoons of bacon drippings. I cooked the bacon separately and mixed it in just before filling the crust. I made this as an hors d'oeuvre, so I divided the dough (which I made in the food processor) in two and rolled out each piece to about 10". I did not have enough dough to fold over, so I just pinched it to form a bowl. I put a collar of aluminum foil around the "bowls" to make sure they did not collapse during baking and baked them on a parchment sheet covered baking pan. Worked great. There was a lot of filling in each bowl. I would probably reduce the onions to 2 1/2 pounds so that it was easier to eat out of hand. Each bowl made 10 pieces.

So Delicious! Creamy onion and bacon goodness - very lush without being overly heavy. If I make it again I would crisp the bacon a bit before adding the onions because it ended up a little chewy (I used thick cut bacon). I used puff pastry instead of the dough recipe because of time and energy constraints (we'd already been cooking for 6 hours) and it turned out very nice.

This was excellent; guests all had rave reviews. A few little changes: I used about 2 pounds of sliced onions (I weighed them after slicing, not whole, so I'm not sure what the pre-sliced weight would have been); I used 1/2 pound of turkey bacon (pork was a no-no for a couple of guests); and I added about a half teaspoon of caraway seeds to the onions as they cooked. I also sprinkled a little grated Gruyere (grated fluffy with a fine Microplane) on top. Very delicious. Next time I may try replacing some of the onions (1/4 or so by weight) with fennel, and I might cook the bacon separately to get it really crispy (it didn't get super-crispy, as it was being cooked with the onions and all that butter) and then crumble it and mix it in when adding the sour cream and egg yolks. As I made it, though, it was great, and I will definitely be experimenting to perfect this one.

I made this as written with the exception of adding a little gruyere cheese in filling and on top. I really liked the crust. It was easy to work with, came out looking good and was a nice change from a typical quiche crust. The filling was good, but I would make changes in it next time. I think it was a little onion-overload and very rich; I would add another veggie like kale or broccoli and decrease the onions. I use less sour cream, maybe some buttermilk or yoghurt. I would make it again with changes, not as written.

I made the filling per the recipe but used prosciutto instead. Put filling in phyllo cups for an appetizer. Really yummy!

Very good. enjoyed every bite of it. I put a pound of bacon and drained some juice off. Next time going to try cheese.

Sweet, savory, rich, smokey filling with a crispy crust! This recipe is fantastic the first time I made it. Can't wait to make it again and double the bacon!

I have made this twice now. The first time I made the recipe as is, the 2nd time I doubled the bacon and mixed in approx 1 cup of grated gruyere cheese and the difference was phenominal! The extra bacon just made it so much more flavorful and the gruyere, well, it made it more sinful. Oh, I used a mix of yellow and sweet onions both times.

The filling on this is very tasty, and certainly worth making. I think the addition of caraway seed as suggested earlier would make it even better. That said, I did not like the crust. It was too heavy and too much of it. A lighter pastry crust would have been better in my opinon.

delicious. i made two of these for thanksgiving and they were worth all of the work. my dough took every bit of two hours to rise. everyone enjoyed them, but how could you not enjoy something with that much butter, bacon and onions.

I made this for the first time for a Thanksgiving dinner party and it turned out delicious. I had to make it vegetarian so everyone could partake so I just took out the bacon altogether. The onions were flavorful enough without it. Everyone loved it. One thing though-perhaps because of the temp in our kitchen, but the dough didn't rise very well, so I was unable to cover the filling as well as in the photo. Definitely was not a looker-sort of gross. But thankfully, I thought the springform was stuck so I tried flipping the pie over to get it out. Well, the insides started to come out, so I immediately flipped it back over right side up and it ended up looking like a yummy bread bowl with soup bubbling over. I then "fluffed" the center that didn't get any movement from the flip and added fresh flat leaf parsley to the center to give it color. Amazing makeover. I don't know why people use a frozen pastry dough-this recipe's dough was for a bread taste and consistency. Use it.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and I have to say it was phenomenal! I followed it to the T and it was perfect. I used yellow onions and was very happy with the choice, plenty of sweetness. No problem with the crust. I was a little worried when the dough did not increase by half when rising,but the crust come out golden and hearty. I will make this again many times!

Just made it at home and I must say it was just one fine piece of Zwiebelkuchen. It is heavy, that's for sure, but it is supposed to be like that: an old, traditional, hearty European food. I suggest that lightweight gourmands shouldn't approach this food solo. A pack of 6-8 diners and a bottle of good off-dry Rhein white wine (or a proper lager) to gulp down the good stuff should alleviate the problem of over abundance. There is only one thing that this recipe is missing - a good pinch of seasoning. While salt and pepper are obvious omittances, not mentioning caraway seeds is an act of serious neglect. ;o) Caraway seeds work so well with caramelized onions and sour cream, adding that extra dimension to the sweet and sour flavor of the combination of the two. The mildly pungent aroma of the caraway seed, ("sweeter" and moister than that of its close cousin, the cumin) is so characteristic to Central and Easter European cuisines and their creations: be it a German onion pie, Hungarian goulash, Slovakian perkelt, Polish military dry crackers, or Lithuanian rye bread. Simple and delicious!

Fantastic! This was the hit of our Thanksgiving dinner - even for those that "don't eat" onions. They actually took some home, since I made several of these pies. Although I do have some notes to add. I used sweet onions and cooked them almost to the point of carmelizing them. I added 2 Tbs basalmic vinager to the onions near the end of preparing the onions. I used natural, unsweetened, unflavored soy yogurt instead of sour cream because we are lacotse intolerant. I also used margarine instead of butter. I used 10% whole wheat flour --- this made for too tough a crust. I had no problems with the dough rising. Make sure you buy fresh packages of yeast before starting. If you want a real treat, make the entire filling, but bake it in custard cups without any bread or pastry. You get a really great treat with a crusty top.

I was not overwhelmed with this recipe. Tasted heavy and the pastry was tough. Maybe I'll try puff pastry next time. It was alot of work and I was disappointed with the outcome.

Cold Texas Evening, a dish of this Onion Pie, a side of Brat's and a cold Beer = 8 Happy Poker Players! Outstanding!

I used the Pepperidge Farms puff pastry sheet, and added ~1/4 cup of Sherry during the evaporation phase, and baked ~1hr. It was really good; husband (glorified New Orleans-cooking DNA) even thought it was really good. Will definitely make for special group dinners.

I made this recipe for a dinner party. The filling was a little bland so I added some blue cheese and a touch of sherry. I added the sherry right after cooking the onions and let it soak in (just a bit, as you don't want it too liquidy). I then added some blue cheese so it melted in. I used vegetarian bacon slices since the party was vegetarian and those worked great. I baked those separately and then crumbled them into the onion mix just before adding the filling. The dough was very easy. It was beautiful and folded over just like the picture. In terms of taste, I would rate the dough 3 out of 4. Not as good as flaky tart crust that I make, but then again, this dough is a lot healthier. I found that to get it to rise, you really need to either switch to a smaller bowl and cover or make sure that you have a warm place to keep it. I solved by just turning the steam oven to 0 humidity and 100 degrees and keeping the bowl covered with a towel there for 1.5 hours. The filling tastes a lot like French onion soup in terms of the flavors. Everyone at my party loved it. I thought it was good, but not outstanding. If I made it again, I would use vidalia or sweet onions instead of yellow onions and I might add some nuts or something for a little more texture.

I made this last night, with one major change, and it was excellent. I was a little wary of how it might turn out, but was very intrigued by the recipe. The filling I made exactly as described and even before baking, it was wonderful. I used hawaiian sweet onions so it came out quite sweet, though not sugary. (While I am sure a more tart yellow or white onion would be great, I think I would always make it with these onions, it was lovely.) As for the dough: I am a terrible baker. I made the dough as described, which of course did not rise. Rather than redo it and face yet another disaster, I used instead puff pastry, which I almost always have in my fridge. I used two sheets of Pepperidge Farm Puff Pastry, making two smaller pies on the same cookie sheet: I spread about half the onions in the middle of each sheet and folded the sides up over the filling so it looked much like the picture. I brushed each with a quick egg wash and baked them both, on the same cookie sheet, for an hour. They were beautiful. And really, really good. So good I am going to make them again for Thanksgiving.
