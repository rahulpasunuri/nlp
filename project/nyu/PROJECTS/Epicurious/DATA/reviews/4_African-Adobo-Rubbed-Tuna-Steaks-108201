I can't believe the culinary bliss! This recipe is so fantastic! I didn't have champagne vinegar so I used white balsamic for the cucumbers and I had some arugula to use up so I chopped it a little and added it to the salsa. It was so so good! It has so many components but is so easy to make! I served it with rice cooked with some carrots, onions and celery but it could be on it's own for a great hot summer meal. WOW!

Delicious and I use the rub for all sorts of proteins. The avocado salsa is just as yummy with half the olive oil.

Best tuna ever! Just make sure you serve the other parts of the dish too....very nice complements! You have to like spice a bit, though...but it is not overwhelming. Remember, you can rub in as much or as little as you wish. People loved it!

I have read many inane reviews but steph83 is the best (or do I mean worst!) I have come across. The spices were a great blend. Each cook has the option to add more or less, which is why the people who look at this wonderful site cook! I didn't have the dried oranges and used zest. Fabulous.

Rating: 4
Couldn't agree less with Steph83. We've made this twice now and love it. Vinegar was a little much for us so we reduced the amount and the pickling time. Halved the dressing for the salsa because it seemed like a lot the first go-around. Delicious!

Whoever wrote this recipe hates spicey food. There was a thick, rare tuna steak covered in deliecious spices, but it lay on top of cool, pickled cucumbers, and beneathe creamy, heat-stealing avocado salsa. So, if you are nervous about heat, then this recipe is for you. Otherwise, keep the salsa (but be certain to use the piquillo peppers, not what I used [because they were all I could find]: sweet red peppers). The avocados and the adobo-rubbed tuna sang harmoniously. But let's just say the rest of the choir was off-key. I'm not sure if it would have made a huge difference, but I couldn't find champagne vinegar so I subbed white wine vinegar. Otherwise, I made the recipe exactly as written. Honestly, I was disappointed. Oh yeah, and the cooking time is way off- you only need half the time, maybe even less, to get a good sear on the tuna, having it remain rare. Also, serve it IMMEDIATELY. It is much better hot than cold.

This recipe is delicious and healthy. My family loved it too! Seems like a crazy amount of ingredients, but the rub keeps well, so I just double it all & keep the mixture in a jar & it lasts for about 4 preparations of this recipe. The meal is quick & easy when the spice rub is premixed.

Oh my . . . this might be the best Epicurious recipe this household has every made. I ran across this recipe today as I was weeding my recipe files and it captured my attention and I already had the tuna thawing in the fridge and almost every ingredient in the house. Just before I decided to cook it this evening I decided to take a look at the reviews. They were consistently ravely about this dish. I never knew it would be everything they said. The complexity of flavors and textures was equivalent to any restaurant meal I have ever had. My only disappointment was I just had a cheap bottle of wine. Can't wait to do this recipe with the respect it needs at a dinner party with all the complimentary wine and courses.

Rating: 4
I have made more than a hundred recipes from Epicurious and this is without a doubt one of the most delicious, most insanely good dishes EVER! Go figure out what you need to get, and MAKE THIS MEAL!! The flavor profile is out of this world with sweet and sour and salty and spicy and high notes and low notes and DAMN! It's *****ing good. Last night I dropped two hundred bucks at a high end restaurant for a meal that was to die for- but this was almost as good, and it cost twelve bucks and took me an hour to make from prep to service. My wife thinks I'm a goddamn genius in the kitchen now. Run and tell that, homeboy.

this is a KILLER recipe. I used it pretty loosely, not doing exact measurements, didn't have everything and subbed honey for sugar and it was wonderful. I will definitely be making this again

OMG - this recipe is to-die-for GOOD ... and pretty easy. I made it for friends that were unsure about eating fish cooked "rare" ... they loved it. Definitely don't skip the cucumbers or avocado salsa as they compliment the spicy tuna so well. If you live in L.A., it's worth a trip downtown to the L.A. Fish Company to pick up really fresh tuna at a reasonable price. Wow - I can't wait to make this again! Got rave reviews from my friends!

Rating: 4
This recipe hardly needs another rave review, but it really is that good. I'm going to make it again with salmon. I didn't have all of the ingredients for the adobo (dry mustard, orange peel) but it was amazing. This one will be a regular in my kitchen. Kids gobbled up the tuna and asked for more. Do make the whole menu. Each part is really good, but all together it's *perfect*.

Rating: 4
Lovely, wonderful recipe. Crazy flavorful. As everyone has said, make all three parts (cucumbers, salsa, and adobo). It's a trinity of tastes and a duo would be missing something. Notes: --Make sure to THINLY slice cucumbers --Use far less Olive Oil (1/8 cup, not 1/2) in Salsa --Sear only for one minute. Seriously. --Make sure to cook Tuna at room temperature, since if it's refrigerated, it won't sear properly --I didn't use dried orange peel and it still tasted great --I substituted RedWine vinegar for champagne, and it worked great --For all the spices, cut to 1 teaspoon rather than 1 and 1/2, since you don't need all that spice (and I covered the tuna as much as possible)

This was an amazing meal! Made some adjustments to only make it for me and my husband, but wow. The results were fantastic! Substituted white wine vinegar for the champagne. Seemed fine. Used jarred roasted red peppers, and didn't have cayenne pepper, also was fine.

I have made only the avocado salsa so far and it was great. I made it with the Mexican cumin chipotle tilapia from this website. Wonderful !

Great recipe. I made it for Lunch for 4 people and loved preparing it. The Adobo mixture is a keeper. My only regret is that I should have been more generous with the Adobo. I will make it again and second time around will be perfect. Loved the Avocado Salsa as well.

Don't think twice about making this recipe, its WONDERFUL! To keep my tuna very rare inside like I like it, I put the steaks in the freezer for a little time (depending on the thickness)to half freeze them (you can season before or after you freeze)that way I can get a nice crust on the outside and dont risk cooking inside. I still only cook for 45-60 sec. on each side.

Rating: 4
Oh, doing the happy dance here. We actually took pictures it was so amazing and so absolutely beautiful. The wonderful heat of the Mediterranean spices marries so incredibly well with cool fattiness of the tuna and then you are hit with the lush salsa and piquant cucumbers. This is one of those rare recipes where you really get the art and science of blending myriad flavors into one extraordinary dish. Serve this; you will be a rock star. My only other advice; barely sear that tuna, keep it rare in the middle for the best texture and flavor.

Rating: 4
Wish I could post a picture of the dish I made. It was FABULI! I had gone offshore fishing and we caught 6 YF 30-80 lbs and have a ton in the freezer and this recipe will be making the circuit. I agree with everyone that you need to make everything: the pickle cucumber, tuna and sauce or it won't feel complete. I didn't serve the caviar - agree with everyone else that I am not sure that it's necessary.

Rating: 3
The tuna is very spicy but the salsa cut it perfectly! I didn't make the cucumbers but didn't really need them either. This was a big hit and lots of leftover rub to use on another day.

Rating: 4
Wow! This is an amazing recipe with possibilites for many other dishes. Do make more of the rub than you need so you'll have it on hand for other meats. I made this on the stove but can't wait to try it on the grill. Yum! It's beautiful too.

Rating: 4
This is one of my favorite dishes, ever, and is the dish I get requests for most often from friends. It's absolutely delicious, and yes-please make all the components of the recipe-you won't be sorry. And even though the adobo seasoning calls for a lot of spices, do take the time and effort to mix the spices yourself, it results in a much better flavor than using anything that says "adobo seasoning" on the bottle. I usually mix up 2-3 times more than what I need each time, so it's ready for the next time I make the dish.And I usually grill my tuna as well, especially since this is such a great summer dish.

Rating: 4
I agree with everyone else, you've got to make all three components for this dish to work properly. And when you do, it does! First, with respect to the adobo, this is a great rub although I barbecued the tuna for about 3 minutes per side rather than doing it in a pan. Worked fab-o. The avocado salsa adds necessary tartness although my avocados needed more time to ripen, sadly. Then, the cucumbers are the antedote to the heat and they also make for great presentation on the plate. Great dish, made no changes to it (other than cooking method, as above) and would not propose any.

Rating: 4
As the previous review states, you have to make all of the components of this dish to really appreciate it. That being said, the avocado salsa was absolutely the belle of the ball here. I was expecting chunky guacamole but what I got was something so different and delicious that I was sad when I ran out of tuna to eat it with. I would probably make the salsa alone before the whole meal again, but both are winners.

Rating: 4
This was one of the best dishes EVER. Restaurant quality food, for a lot less effort than you might think. The ingredient list is long, but it's not so much work -- and you can do a lot of it ahead of time. Everyone loved it! Even I couldn't believe how good it was!

Rating: 4
I made the recipe as written and it was absolutely delicious!! It is imperative to make all three components. It would not be the same without the cumbers to balance out the spice on the tuna. So, it is really not fair to the recipe to exclude making one or more of the parts and then review it. Listen only to the reviewers that made the entire dish! You will be happy, I am sure of it!

I made only the tuna and cucumber portions of the recipe and they were delicious. Since I made only two servings of fish instead of four I put the left over adobo into some rice pilaf to serve as a side.

This was delicious. The first time I cooked tuna and I loved it. It's restaurant quality, the whole time my husband and I were eating it, we couldn't believe we made it. Making the adobo was quite a production though - my husband was sitting at the kitchen table will 10 different spice jars measuring everything out. Next time I will just buy an adobe-like seasoning and then this recipe will be much less arduous.

I made the adobo portion of this recipe and used it with swordfish. Delicious! After coating the fish, I seared it for about 90 seconds per side, then popped it into a preheated 350 degree oven for a few minutes to finish cooking. We look forward to making this again and trying it with tuna and other fishes.

I have made this dish several times, and absolutely love it. If you're a tuna purist it might not be the dish for you, for the spice is very flavorful. Yet a light coating of spice on a thick piece of tuna, paired with the avocado salsa makes a truly sublime dish.

It was great, no doubt about it. I didn't have the peppers so might have missed something there, but it was still fantastic, not sure how tuna can be screwed up, and anything with avacados is good.

Delicious. We would make it more spicy next time, though, maybe with habanero peppers.

Due to food allergies, I can't use the avocados or cukes so I just made a huge amount of the Adobo Rub and keep it in the jar in my cupboard and use it on any kind of fish that's going onto the grill... for when I need a grilling spice in a hurry. There is a bit of "hot" in the rub, so I find that serving it with a dose of homemade mango/cilantro/lime juice relish on the side offsets the heat.

Rating: 4
This dish was fabulous - really tasty and beautiful. All our guests loved it and it was so easy to make that we got to enjoy the party!

Rating: 3
Adobo: We especially liked undertone of fresh nutmeg but would use considerably less red pepper flake another time. We took directions literally -- sprinkle generously -- and had tons leftover but this meant it enhanced, not overpowered, the delicate tuna. Cucumbers: A simple easy contrast to heat, will likely use again and again. Two people ate up 1 cucumber without trouble! For six I'd use at least three! Salsa: Should have known better but unripe avocadoes just don't work.

Rating: 1
I hate to be the dissenter, but at $18/pound for tuna steak, you can do a lot better than caking adobo on it to the point where you scarcely recall that you're eating tuna. (And no, I did not even COME CLOSE to using all of the spice that the recipe prepares -- just a small fraction of it). I think that this would impress the rookies, but for those who have tuna steak fairly often -- or aren't bowled over by the novelty of it -- I trust that you can do a little better. Fish elsewhere.

This is soooo good! The rub had a decent bite and when you add a salsa (I had no avacados so used mangos) the flavors just melt in your mouth. I also used albacore tuna which was also excellent. ENJOY!

Very quick to put together. All of the elements--the rub (which has a wonderful and unique taste), the salsa, and the cucumbers--work very well together. The first time I made this, I didn't have limes on hand (but I substituted Rose's lime juice, which worked just fine--lime taste without any discernable sweetness), nor dried orange rind (substituted a drop of orange oil), nor champagne vinegar (substituted blood orange vinegar from Sonoma, sans sugar--gave the cukes a great hint of orange). I roasted an Italian pepper from my garden as a substitute for the jarred peppers. Salsa and cukes were made a few hours in advance and held up well in the refrigerator. The second time I made this for a party, and everyone couldn't stop raving about it. I've come back to bump up the rating from three to four. This is a keeper.

OUTSTANDING RECIPE FOR TUNA STEAKS! What a wonderful dish! I grilled my tuna steaks. I just love the taste of food off the grill! But I gilled them a little longer as I like my tuna medium rare. Grilled it about 4 minutes or more, per side. The middle was still red and very tender. substitued my own grilled red peppers (just grill a red pepper in oil, cut in strips). Placed the tuna steak - whole - onto cucumbers (did not slice tuna steak). Still tastes fantastic! What a wonderful recipe for Tuna! Enjoy!

The rare, but flavorful tuna was a big hit. A great compromise with my husband, the sushi lover. I used the Old Bay seasoning and added some orange zest and sugar. I will cut the cucumbers in thinner pieces next time.

This was amazing! Made all three parts. The only substitution I made was (as suggested) using roasted red peppers in place of jarred piquillo peppers, which I couldn't find. Having followed the recipe exactly (even garnished with dried orange peel and so on), my only suggestions/recommendations would be to make less of the adobo rub (way too much for four tuna steaks), and make a little less of the marinade for the salsa. Yum!

Rating: 3
Made all three- very good combo! I wished I had sprinkled the adobo even more generously (was cautious handed since I'd read the review of the person who said she put too much...). But the dish was pretty good!

The spice rub was excellent (and nice and spicy). When I make it again, I'll add less oil to the salsa, and maybe a bit more of the citrus juices.

This took about an hour to get the spices, salsa, and cucumber ready (all things one could do ahead of time). It was great for a dinner party becuase of the fast cooking time.-- we used a cast iron skillet for the searing. I also made a warm salad starter of black-eyed peas and pumpkin stew. I wouldn't hestitate to serve this dish again and again.

This was quite tasty. The rub was unsual - spicy, a bit of sweet, a bit of heat. It was very good and I want to try it on shrimp and perhaps steak. The salsa is excellent - did not bother with the cucumbers.

We've been Epicurious fans for a few years now, and have taken advantage of 20-30 recipes from the site., and never before have we taken the time to write a review. This dish was hands down the best meal we've ever prepared at home. Not only is it delicious, but the presentation was stunning. We've decided to take action on a long-discussed 'foodie-group' idea, and will be making this again as our first course meal. Try it-- it's sure to impress you and your guests!

My husband brought back 50 lbs. of fresh tuna from the Gulf. Naturally, I went to epicurius.com for recipe. This is fabulous. We have had this 4 times in one week. My husband likes the tuna raw in the middle so, 1 minutes on each side is definately the way to cook the tuna. I would not recommend using Old Bay seasoning as an quick substitute for the Adobe spice, makes it too salty. Great dish to serve for an intimate dinner party. Love it!!

Tonight, we had this recipe. I was very excited to make this exotic spice rub. As I mixed the spices and tasted it, I realized that is was Maryland crab spice. If you live in Maryland, you would recognize this as Old Bay. Yes, it is delicious, but you can buy it in the store. I even saw it in a grocery store in Florida. The dinner was very good, I would definitely make it again. I would use Old Bay instead of mixing all of the spices. I LOVED the avocado, I wanted to use cilantro. It didn't need it.

Do go to the effort of making everything - the salsa, tuna, and cucumber salad. All the flavors complement and enhance each other superbly. I served it with sliced, fried, medium ripe plantains to round out a complete meal. Slicing the cooked tuna and fanning it out over the cucumber makes both a delicious and elegant entree.

This recipe was fantastic! The flavors blended together so well: the avocado salsa and the pickled cucumbers were such a complement to the spicy tuna. I made a few modifications; I could not find the piquillo peppers for the avocado salsa, even at the huge Fairway in NYC, so I simply ommitted them; and, I used the juice of only 1 juice orange. Next time, I would cook the tuna longer; the parts of the tuna that were cooked tasted better than the raw portions (hence three forks instead of four). I also used 2 cucumbers, so I could have a proper bed on which to lay the tuna. Served with a great Oregon Pinot Noir.

I'm a huge tuna fan, and have had it at some of the best restaurants around the US... this recipe ranked up there with the best, and is VERY easy. The only change I'd make is for those who aren't into SUPER spice, cut the Cayenne and Crushed Red Pepper in half.
