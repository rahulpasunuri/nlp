Really fantastic. Simple to prepare and delicious. Can't wait to serve it for company. Kind of a pain to remove the fat but well worth it for the tender and juicy finished product. Don't be discouraged by the taste of the pesto, it might not seem like it, but it's perfect with the lamb.

This is one of the best recipes! Make extra pesto because you will want to eat on everything! I made it with pearl couscous which was a nice accompaniment...of course we mixed the pesto into the couscous too! Yum!

The store I went to didn't have leg of lamb so I made it with cut up chops-delicious! My boyfriend is skeptical and picky. He said with every bite "this is so good!". He NEVER compliments my cooking while eating.

mint pesto is fantastic!

I planted mint to make mint juleps for the Kentucky Derby and it took over my tiny garden space. I pulled it out and put the mint in its own planter-box, but still have so much mint. What to do, what to do...? With a boneless, butterflied leg of lamb, we threw this together after a fun filled day at the beach with friends. Served with simple couscous, a fresh garden salad, pita and hummus, this recipe was a delight that we will surely make again, and again. Long live the mint.

Very yummy. Used lamb from the neck, according to the butcher and it was perfect. Put too much garlic in the pesto, so the kids didn't go for it, but adults loved it.

This recipe is delicious. The mint pesto tastes really fresh and supplements the lamb well. I made it with some couscous, which was nice.

I have had mint jelly and pesto with many a lamb dish, but this recipe did not do it for me. I'm not sure if it was the cilantro or what, but I will not make this again.

I made this last night using cut up skirt steak. It was delicious. The pesto could go with a wide array of meats.

This wouldn't be noteworthy without the mint cilantro pesto, which is delicious. I thought the leg was a little too marbled for my taste, so maybe next time I'll try a different cut that's leaner. Served with couscous. The pesto would pair well with other meats as well. The cooking time seemed perfect for the lamb but not enough for the pepper and onion. Probably just my BBQ...

I too was skeptical about the mint/cilantro pesto but it's delicious. I will definitely make it again and again and again...

Delicious! Made this for guests last night to rave reviews. Every morsel was consummed. It was easy to make and the flavors were well-balanced. In the winter I am going to roast the marinated, boneless leg of lamb in the oven and serve with roasted vegetables and potatoes.

I was a little skeptical about the mint pesto with cheese in it, but it was terrific. My husband and kids loved this dish. I'm making it again this weekend.

Excellent dish with the added bonus of being completely make-aheadable. My guests weren't "lamb people" and they loved it. I'll make it again soon.
