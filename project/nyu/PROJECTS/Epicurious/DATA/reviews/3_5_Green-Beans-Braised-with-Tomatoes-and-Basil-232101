I am always looking for recipes that make use of my garden produce. This was an easy one. The only thing store bought was the olive oil and the cinnamon that was suggested to bring out the flavor. Everything was fresh - this didn't waste fresh food with boiling or otherwise letting the flavor fade out.

This dish is really great--but you have to do it right: tomatoes, basil, green beans and even the white onions are in the same growing season. These should be obtained from your farmers' market. If you think this dish is bland, it's because you're not using real food! So simple and easy. I tried this with a pinch of cinnamon as someone suggested. Will definitely make again.

May sound weird but add a pinch of cinnamon to boost the flavour.

I served this as a side dish in an Italian menu at a dinner party. I needed to prepare it early in the day, so I sauteed the onion and garlic and added the green beans and sauteed until crispy tender. I refrigerated until time to serve, then reheated with the 1/2 cup of water and added the tomatoes and basil. Very tasty and colorful.

It is OK. Not great. But an easy week night side dish.

Vegetable-gardening friends gave us some VERY mature green beans. I doubled the water and the cooking time and lowered the heat. The beans came out tender, but not mushy - they still had a hint of crispness. Most of the excess liquid cooked away, so the tomato flavor intensified. This is a great recipe for over-the-hill beans.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I have fresh grean beans and roma tomatoes out of the garden. Add some capers for a little zest.

I also thought this recipe was a bit bland. We added Season-All to it this time to give it more flavor. Next time I may add bacon and some other herbs.

I was not too impressed with this. I followed the recipe exactly, but I think 1/2 cup of water is a bit too much. It never really absorbed so I was left with a watery tomato sauce of sorts. I also felt like the dish was a bit bland.

I prepared this exactly as directed, and then added more olive oil - turning this into an easy summer salad. I will attempt this recipe again utilizing zuchini.

This dish is simply delicious, even though I accidently omitted the tomatos. I paired it with a baked potato covered with sauted basil butter, and a pork chop. I felt like I was eating at a restaurant, the meal was so good.

Very tasty when recipe is followed exactly. I usually like to mess around with recipes and do so when I'm missing an ingredient or two but this one is best as is. It's just as good with fresh grape tomatoes but the consistency is different.

This was ok, but there are other recipes I like better. Probably won't make this one again.

I made this recipe twice. Easy, flavorful. Good way to dress up green beans. Since I usually just steam green beans I tried to make a low fat version of this recipe. So, the second time I made this I used non fat cooking spray in the place of the olive oil for a low fat, low calorie dish. Reducing the fat did not make a huge difference in the flavors. Oh, and I used dried basil leaves in place of the fresh basil. I served it with mashed potatoes for the carb eaters and pureed cauliflowers for the low carb eaters at my table.
