The flavored mayonnaise is delicious, and the watercress provides a nice contrast. The prep is easy for a special-tasting wrap.

These are fantastic. Toasting the tortillas is a worthwhile step, and very easy if you have gas burners. Because good watercress can be hard to find, and because I don't want to deal with the stems, I find it easier to load these wraps with fresh spinach, right out of the bag. I'm sure watercress would be tastier, but spinach makes a healthy substitution.

This is on my list of "healthy lunch" recipes. I use whole wheat lavash from TJ's and this makes it filling. You can even prepare it the night before--the watercress maintains it's constitution. As is, the sandwich is a little too "green"--so for the second round, I added roasted red peppers. This complimented the rest of the ingredients nicely.

I would make this again but woulde add a little sun dried tomato paste. I used 1/2 an anchovy and found it to be quite salty.

I'm in love with these easy to make wraps. They're delicious. The only thing I did differently from the recipe was to use one whole anchovy rather than the anchovy paste, which I didn't have and quite frankly can't find at the store.

I confess I only made the anchovy mayonnaise and used it to serve with tenderloin and party rolls for a small cocktail gathering. Similar enough to the recipe as written, I think, to add a review on the sauce which is FABULOUS! A wonderful change from the standard horseradish or bernaise--we will have this often in lots of ways, including trying it with roast beef wraps.
