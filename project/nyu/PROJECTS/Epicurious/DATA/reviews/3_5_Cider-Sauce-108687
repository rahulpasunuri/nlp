I tried it with Granny Smith Apples and it was fantastic! However, your recipe as given was equally as good.

Being a New England apple fanatic, I threw in 2 tart (Macoun, Jonathan, or Granny Smith would work)apples, and the second recipe came out even better - Though I must say the e-mail recipe was terrific in it's own right! I'm definitely passing this mail on to friends.
