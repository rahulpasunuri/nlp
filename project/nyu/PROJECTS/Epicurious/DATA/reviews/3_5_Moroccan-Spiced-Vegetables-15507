Very easy and very good. I would definitely make again. It is a useful side dish, not the star of the plate.

My husband is a "grand chopper" so he was in his element chopping all the vegetables. We were very disappointed about the spice---it was totally bland. I had some harissa-like spice mixture on hand (made from the Grilled Chicken Moroccan Style recipe on Epicurious, which was fabulous, btw), and added this at the last minute of cooking. This addition made it a 3-fork delicious dish. We'd make it again. Healthy!

I was surprised that this came out as delicious as it did - I made it the day before for a Moroccan dinner party and it was a great complement to a tagine. I did add raisins for sweetness and I was glad I took the time to chop the vegetables as described as the texture was just right. I wouldn't have called it 'quick,' though.

We cut everything in bigger chunks, too much foo foo in the instructions, LOL! Added eggplant and added more of the spices. Yummy!

Made this as a main course tonight. I did 1/2" dice, which worked great, and not much work. Added a can of garbanzo beans, 1/4t cinnamon, 2T water, and squeezed a lemon on top just before serving. I think some raisins or dried apricots would add a nice sweet note. Whatever you do, don't leave out the fennel, although not the main flavor it adds so much to the dish.

Very good, simple and fast! Put this on top of a couscous and you're ready to go! ;)

great recipe! One small addition that really adds to the sweetness of the vegetables and browns them a bit would be to add some rum while cooking

This is a really good vegetable side dish that can be served with all sorts of Middle Eastern main dishes. We didn't bother with measuring, and cut the vegetables to a half inch dice, which came out fine (except that the carrots took lots longer to cook -- I would parboil them longer next time) and was not time-consuming. We served with Middle Eastern lamb meatballs from this site and a rice-vermicelli pilaf.

This really deserved 3 1/2 forks but that isn't an option here. This did involve a lot of chopping but it was a very colorful and attractive presentation. We didn't find it that spicy. I would recommend doubling it so you can have some leftovers for all the hard chopping work. It was easy to make once you were just cooking in the pan!

Yummy and easy dish. Used cumin seeds instead of ground cumin and added a tiny sprinkle of cinnamon because it seemed to call for a bit of sweetness. Also didn't measure the diced vegetables, just cut up everything.

Try pairing these veggies with the Beef-Short Ribs Tagine found on this site. YUM!

This was pretty good. I was looking for a vegetable dish to go with a moroccan theme dinner. I didn't add extra spice because There were a lot of spices going on in my menu already. I think it complemented my dinner very well. If I were making a less spicy dinner I think I would add extra spice. By the way I doubled the recipe and still had all the vegetables cut up in no time flat. I do chop quickly but I'm not professional. Don't let prep time put you off.

This dish was O.K., it does need a little more spice. To the "Chef" in Baltimore, it takes "eons" to dice the vegetables??? I am a professional caterer and have done similar recipes for 1000 guest! maybe time to look for new work!!

Very tasty and easy to make - lots of flavor without being too spicy or over the top. I love Moroccan food and find it a joy to cook and eat. I served this with Moroccan Chicken(another great recipe from this web site) served over saffron rice. A Great Meal that I would recommend to anyone to try and make.

I loved this, I served it with a herb rubbed new york loin roast and southwestern pumpkin soup. It was perfect- adding more spice would be fine- but it is terrific the way it is. I am thinking the professional chef may have cooked them wrong, even if they are not to your taste, there is NO way what I made and ate last night could be that bad, unless something got messed up in the cooking...

This is a great recipe! The vegetables stay fresh and have a wonderful crunch. A perfect side dish to a Moroccan dinner. Yes, it does not have a lot of spice but it will not overshadow your main Moroccan dish either! A definite keeper -- will make again!

Can't I give this way less than a '1'?? Like a negative score?? I work as a professional chef and made this at a friend's suggestion...I would never, never, never make it again!! Besides the fact that it needed WAY MORE garlic, cumin & ginger and salt (and I don't use much salt!), it takes eons to dice all the vegetables!! PLEASE!!! Find another recipe!! Take your favorite veggies and saute them up with some garlic, red pepper flakes, cumin, a bit of coriander and some ginger...but DON'T TRY THIS!!!

So tonight will be my second time making this recipe and I must let all new cooks know that you MUST add more spice. The flavor is very mild with the measurements they provide. I added cayenne the last time and it needed even more. Otherwise, this was easy to prepare and my guests loved it.

I served these vegetables with minted rack of lamb and couscous. It was fantastic and a very colourful meal.
