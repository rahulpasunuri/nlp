We just use the biscuit recipe here. My kids love them fresh out of the oven.

I served this at a dinner party and everyone flipped! A definite keeper!

Instead of milk I used lite coconut milk for a non dairy version of the biscuits...they came out great. I also added chocolate liqueur to the cherry sauce and it was very tasty.

My sister just got back from Germany with some German Kirsch so I was going to try this. Though now I think I have to find a recipe for chocolate gravy. The chocoholics in my family will go nuts.

I served this at a dinner party with strawberries instead of cherries. I used Callebeau Semi-sweet shavings. Some pieces of biscuit were left on plates--good thing for the fresh peach pie I made that everyone raved about. I found the biscuits dry and uninteresting.

Excellent! I made this for a 4th of July party - very festive. It received rave reviews. It was nice for a dinner party because everything could be made ahead of time and just assembled after dinner.

Oh, man--this was good. I made both this and the Raspberry-Lemon Trifle (Bon Appetit June 2001) for a luncheon, expecting to like the trifle better. The trifle was a showstopper, but the cherry shortcake wowed me! It was worth pitting all those cherries. Don't skip the chocolate biscuits--they made the dish.

I made this for my French neighbors and they loved it. I made two batches of biscuits and froze them. I then made the dessert with strawberries for other friends. It was aa huge success both times. I try to make particularly American recipes for my French friends. Berry shortcake fits this bill nicely.

I may be prejudice since cherries and chocolate are two of my favorites, but this is incredible!! Have also made these biscuits and served them with my Grandmothers chocolate gravy, and they're a family favorite.
