So I have heard about the Texas Sheet Cake for a while. And I figured that since I heart epicurious, that I would take a gamble and make a recipe that noone had reviewed. I made this for a work party at my bosses home. It was great! Although, people and kids alike kept referring to it as brownies;) The recipe was really easy to make. The only issue I had, I guess when I poured it into the pan I must have poured it unevenly because after it was baked one side was significantly higher than the other and it had nothing to do with raising/falling. Also note that I have not noticed that my oven runs hot but I set the timer for the minimum amount of time and after peering into the over 6 minutes early, it looked done and actually tested done too. So I pulled it out of the oven. Moral of the story: I would watch it when you make it because part of the joy of the cake is that it is so moist. And overcooking it would be no good. To prevent the frosting from wrinkling, I propped up the lower side with kitchen towels as the frosting was cooling. It was still wrinkling but as it was cooling, several time I smoothed it with a spatula and it removed the wrinkles and they did not reappear. YAY:) It cut and presented great! it was moist, and chocolately but not overly rich which could lend itself to eating more than a few pieces. Overall, I would make this recipe again for a big get together. The kids liked it. The adults liked it. My boyfriend that prefers savory liked it. As for myself, I prefer sweets and I liked it. Overall, a solid recipe that next time I make it I will try and even out the batter a little better. This is a solid 3-3.5 star recipe. Not 4 stars because it was a good chocolate cake but not a a great memorable chocolate cake that I will remember for years. You should totally try it. Texas obviously know how to do sheet cake!
