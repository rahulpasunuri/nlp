I have made this potato recipe several times and have not been disappointed. I mostly serve the potatoes with beef, but they are tasty with just about anything. Additionally, I have used this recipe with very small Atomic Fireball-sized potatoes, which I served as finger food at a party. I have also used it with golf ball-sized potatoes, which I arrayed in a 13x9 inch serving dish (about 40) for a lovely presentation at a potluck party. It does take a bit of work, but the enthusiastic reviews make it worth it. They are savory and finger- licking good.

Loved these -- and they got a "Best Potatoes Ever" from my SO which earns them 4 forks. The recipe doesn't make it clear but I mixed the cheese and mayo in with the scooped out potato which is what I assumed you were meant to do. May add ham as well another time. I served these with roasted black cod (instead of sea bass) and an tomato olive salad (recipe on epicurious) for a great meal.

Excellent flavor. I did mine in the food processor and it came out beautifully. Due to a lack of time, I cut the potatoes in half, threw in the filling and mixed. Not as elegant a presentation but delicious and much more appropriate for an informal dinner. Think Tuscan country dinner vs. a night at the Ritz.

Very good, but a much easier and tastier way to make garlic paste (although it requires a little more cooking time) is to rub a whole head of garlic in olive oil (skins and all), wrap in tin foil, and roast for about an hour at 400 degrees. This gives the paste a roasted taste and reduces the risk of burning the garlic.

I halfed the cheese stuffing as suggested and it was plenty.The cheese is very flavourful. I did not hollow out the potatoes to 1/4 inch as suggested, but rather scooped out about 1/4 of the potato.

I have made this after actually eating at the Flagler Fish Co. I made it for a holiday and it was a smash hit. Very easy and incredible flavor.

I wanted to make this for two people. Even though I reduced the cheese and mayonnaise, I still had a lot left over!

Delicious and different. Served these as an appetizer for my gourmet club to great reviews.

Loved this! Even picky son, despite reservations (doesn't like cheese or mayo!), had three. Made exactly as directed although next time think I would add about half again filling. Served with bbq'd T-bones, fatoush and Walla Walla fried onions--perfect summer fare. Sandra McNally Calgary/Panama/Edmonton

These were outstanding. They weren't too hard to make, just allow for the necessary time. I would recommend them for anytime you want a unique potato dish. They are a little bit rich, but worth it. I also had to use larger red potatoes but it worked fine.

Very good...need to simmer the potatoes a little longer but these were very good with new potatoes. Husabnd who "doesn't do" potatoes, loved them. Very good and very easy. Will make ahead of time next time. Use fresh basil and good cheese. I used mayo with olive oil and still very good.

This is a great side dish with salmon. A bit of prep time, but nothing to terrible. We used the left over cheese mix over boiled potatoes - yum! A keeper for sure.

I thought these would be just another variation on twice-baked potatoes, but they were much better. The fresh basil is a must. Followed recipe exactly and entire family, including kids ages 3-18 loved it. Will keep this one.

This was excellent. It was a tad bit of work, but considering you can make ahead, it made entertaining a breeze last night. I followed the recipe exactly and they were gobbled up.

Not worth the expense to make. Threw it away

Wow...these are a fantastic special occasion side dish! I made a day ahead, as others have noted. I forgot the basil at the market, so I used home-grown chives instead, and it was great. I love this way of roasting garlic, too! It's definitely my new method, since it also results in wonderful infused olive oil when finished. Try some of the leftover cheese mixture on crostini (rubbed with raw garlic) and some chopped tomotoes in vinaigrette (like a bruschetta topping). WOW, again.

Very easy and great for a party because you can do everything the day before and then just throw them in the oven when your guests arrive. The next time I will scoop out a larger hole (I had alot of the filling left over), will add some chives and some parm or romano on top. I also may add one or two minced raw cloves of garlic to the filling to give it a little more flavor.

Great taste, and presentation. With the potatoes I cored, I made mashed potatoes and used the cheese filing.

These are wonderful and soooo easy.They also keep and reheat well. I just scooped a little of the potato out and stuffed them. You can put some of the cheese mixture on top of the scooped- out potato and heat it for a snack.

These are fantastic, but super rich. You can only have a few.

This was a great do-ahead receipe. I completely chilled the potatoes, then filled them and return them to the fridge in an oven to table roasting pan. Very easy!

I too found the directions somewhat unclear so here's what I improvised - I boiled baby yukon gold (not red) potatoes until tender, cut the tops off, scooped out the inside leaving about 1/4 inch shell, added the mayo and roasted rather than sauteed garlic to the potatoes along with the cheese, and mashed the filling. I then spooned the filling back into the shells and topped with a few shreds of additional cheese. Baked for 30 minutes. The presentation was nice and they tasted good, but I'm not sure the effort was worth it. I like the combination of flavors and will likely incorporate into the next batch of mashed potatoes or potatoe pancakes.

I forgot to add that I used the bits of potatoes which were left after scooping the potatoes and made a small mashed potatoe dish for my toddler (with butter, heavy cream, and parmesan)

Excellent! Will do it again. Good to serve with the Buffalo Salmon recipe from Gourmet 5/08. But I find that the filling is enough for at least twice as many small red potatoes. I was able to fill 35 potatoes plus I had extra filling which you can use to spread on crackers or breads.

I made these for guests Saturday night and they were amazing! I added some fresh chives along with the basil. And yes, you get small potatoes and just scoop out a nice sized hole to put the filling in. No need to peel or cut in half.

The way I read the recipe, you're to use very small potaotes in which you'd "melon ball" out the center and fill so there's no need to cut in half, etc.

Are we meant to halve the potatoes once they're cooked and cooled? How else to scoop out the center for stuffing? Hope someone will specify. It sounds like this step may have been left out of the recipe.

Very elegant yet easy to make. Great flavor. I followed directions as written.
