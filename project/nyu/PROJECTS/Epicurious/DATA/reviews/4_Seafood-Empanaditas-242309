Delicious! Just read the review below, and you'll be fine. I had a little trouble with forming some of them, but aesthetics were not hugely important for this meal. You might want to freeze or refrigerate them if you want to ensure they hold their shape. Be sure to seal them too, or they might open up on one end. I had this happen, but the guests just spooned the salsa inside. I recommend a light, homemade pico de gallo.

I'm planning on doing these as a make ahead. Any suggestions? Fry then bake to reheat. Or bake w/ an egg wash, then rebake?

They screwed up on this one: SEAFOOD EMPANADTAS Continued from page 83 ---- Coarsely chop clams and mussels (leave small ones whole). - --- Cook onion, scallion, and garlic in butter in a heavy medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle in flour, chile, paprika, and oregano and cook, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes. Whisk in 1 cup shellfish- cooking liquid and bring to a boil, whisking, then simmer, whisking, 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops, and parsley. Cool completely. (Filling will not be fully cooked.) MAKE EMPANADITAS: Divide dough in half, then roll out 1 piece of dough into a 17-inch round ( 1/s inch thick) on a lightly floured surface. Cut out 12 rounds with cutter and transfer to a parchment-lined large baking sheet. Gather scraps and reroll, then cut out more rounds. Repeat with remaining dough on another baking sheet. ---- Put a heaping tablespoon filling (it will be wet) in center of 1 round, leaving a lh- inch border. Brush edges lightly with water and pull dough over filling to enclose, then seal edge. Crimp with a fork dipped in flour. Repeat with remaining rounds. ---- Put a metal rack on a baking sheet in oven, then preheat oven to 200°F. ---- Heat 1 1/z inches oil to 360°F in a 3- quart saucepan over medium-high heat, then fry empanaditas, 4 at a time, turning with a slotted spoon, until golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes per batch. Transfer to paper towels to drain briefly, then keep warm in oven. Return oil to 360°F between batches. COOKS' NOTES: Empanaditas can be formed (but not fried) up to 1 month ahead and frozen in an airtight container. - Leftover filling can be stirred into hot pasta or soup.
