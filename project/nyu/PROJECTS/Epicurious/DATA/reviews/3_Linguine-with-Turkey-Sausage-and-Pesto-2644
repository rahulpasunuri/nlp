"Prepared pesto"?!? And precooked sausage? This isn't a recipe. It's an afterthought. Bleecchhh.

Delicious and easy! Our household is 1/2 meat-eating, 1/2 vegetarian, and substituting meatless Italian "sausage" was just as satisfying to me. We used jarred pesto, and thought the recipe would've been a five-fork knockout with homemade. I agree with A Cook: more mushrooms are definitely called for.

I thought this recipe was delicious. I read other reviews and was a little apprehensive, but the family enjoyed this. Since I'm a mushroom lover, I would probably add more of them.

One of my staples! I use yellow onion instead of green onion, and sprinkle some toasted pine nuts on along with the additional parmesan before serving. YUM!

My family loves this recipe! Very simple and pleasing to the eye. Definitely reccomend.

The concept is interesting but the product dissapointing. I also had to add red pepper to give the dish some zing. Overall, the dish was just too heavy (with cheese and 1/2 cup pesto) for my family's taste.

This recipe was amazing. I used italian turkey sausage instead of kielabasa and it made it tasty. Everyone loved it and it made great leftovers!

Wanted to find a way to use turkey sausage, other than just steamed with mashed potatoes and mustard or bbq sauce on the side. I tried this, using DiGiorno's Basil Pesto, which is very good, and because it has quite a bit of parmesan in the pesto, I did not add the parmesan to the pan, I just sprinkled some on each individual dish. I thought this was quite good, very satisfying and simple!!!

It was a rainy afternoon and I needed to prepare a quick lunch so I searched for a recipe that called for sausage, pesto and pasta since I had the homemade turkey and chicken with sundried tomato sausage, and freshly made pesto on hand. I used fresh herbs over dried. I also added 1 teaspoon of dried red pepper flakes to give it a little kick. Quick and easy but it still didn't "Wow" me.

Under 45 minutes, and very tasty. I used my own frozen pesto, so that may have helped a little.
