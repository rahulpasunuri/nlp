Love, love this recipe but have tweaked it a bit. Halved the olive oil (every time it calls for 2 tbsp we use 1) and inadvertently changed the feta proportions, put 3/4 cup in the orzo and 1/4 cup on top after. Yummy!!!

I've been making this recipe regularly since I found it over 9 years ago, and I often receive requests for the recipe after I've served it to guests. I make it exactly as written, except we have to eat gluten-free, so I use either shell rice pasta or quinoa in place of the orzo. Great every time!!

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious and a major hit with husband. Made a couple of changes: sauteed the shrimp in lots of garlic and a couple of minced shallots. After putting the shrimp on the orzo I added yet more garlic and shallots, plus a tiny amount of chili flakes, to the skillet and sauteed before adding the tomatoes. You definitely need to double the tomatoes. I used extra basil and oregano as well - so yummy!

Love this recipe, but did change the preparation a bit. Did everything in a large non-stick skillet. Cook the orzo in boiling water as usual. Saute the garlic and sliced green onion in 2 tablespoons oil. Add grape tomatoes cut in half, spices, wine and simmer covered until tomatoes soften. Add the shrimp and simmer covered about 3 minutes or as needed to cook the shrimp. Drain the orzo and add in the parmesan and some of the feta. Add chopped basil and a handful of chopped baby spinach leaves to the shrimp mixture and toss to mix in the skillet until wilted. Season with salt and pepper and serve over orzo. I tried to make it a little greener and take out some of the oil, and it was wonderful this way.

This is a huge favorite in our house. I do tweak it by doubling the amount of tomatoes. This is a good meal to make when you are expecting guests as you can put it together ahead of time.

Delish! We didn't have any feta, so I used brie instead and it was yummy. I also used fresh tomatoes, fresh oregano, and a little mint just for fun. A great, easy spring/ summer dish.

Very easy, company friendly. You can put the casserole together before your company arrives and quickly finish up right before serving. I had some baby spinach leaves which I threw on the completed dish right before I topped it with the feta cheese.

Made this by only using a tablespoon of olive oil to saute garlic and used light feta. My daughter is on Weight Watchers. She, my grandchildren and husband thought it was awesome. Going in my keeper file.

Perfect for week nights when you need something quick. Everyone liked this, and I would definitely make it again. One 14 1/2 oz can of tomatoes does not seem to be enough. Next time I will try two cans of tomatoes and give it extra time to reduce. I also marinated the shrimp in a little bit of lemon juice for extra flavor.

Rating: 4
I just made this dish for the second time and it was so much better than the first. The difference I felt was in that I did not add the shrimp with all of the other ingredients but sauteed them briefly at the end and added them to the already baked orzo and tomato sauce. I also stirred about 6oz of chopped spinach to the tomato sauce and sprinkled toasted pine nuts at the end with the feta.

Rating: 4
This recipe is deceptively simple. We are always surprised at how good it is. There's room for improvisation -- sautéed spinach in garlic and incorporated into rice along with some pesto, added Italian herbs and capers in tomato sauce. Brown rice is more nutritious and flavorful than orzo.

This is one of my favorite things to make for company--it can be prepared in advance, but still tastes fresh and just-fancy-enough. Love it. I thank Donna every time I make it.

This recipe was good - the flavors were a bit understated (but perhaps that's due to the fact that I used dried herbs) and my tomato sauce didn't thicken as suggested in the recipe; however, the flavors combined well enough to make the end product quite tasty (although soupy). The more cheese the better!

This is a great recipe that I have made many times for both friends and family. Everyone loves it! The only change I made is as a final step to put the feta on before going into the oven - the cheese gets soft but does not melt. Delish!

My husband is the cook in our family, and in trying to keep up with him I made this fantastic dish. It could not have been more simple, easy, and GREAT!

This recipe has been a "major hit" each time I've made it and everyone who's had it wants the recipe. It's very easy to make and can prepared in advance of guests arrival. Just bring it to room temp. and heat it up when you're ready to eat. I squeeze the juice of half a lemon over the shrimp after arranging it on the orzo and it gave it an added "zing".

Delicious and easy. I've made this several times and now I condense a few steps. I just cook the shrimp in the sauce. You can even stir the orzo mixture into the hot shrimp/sauce then sprinkle with more feta and put it under the broiler for a few minutes so the cheese melts and browns a bit. Served with bread and a salad it's a perfect quick dinner.

Quick and delicous meal that uses up basics you have on hand. I managed to find orzo in the cupboard, but could see this working well with fusilli or another smaller pasta. Used half goat cheese and half feta, since that is what I had in the fridge - very creamy, rich texture. Also chopped up some heirloom tomatoes instead of canned, which I had to cook down for a bit longer, due to the extra liquid. I threw this under the broiler for a few minutes after baking to crisp up the pasta on top. Both my fiance and I raved about this easy dish! Fresh basil brings this dish together- hearty and filling!

My wife and I agree that this is a fantastic dish. I feel there was just about the right amount of spice added by the hot pepper flakes and the over-all flavor is amazing. We will try this for a dinner party, since much of this can be made in advance and then incorporated into the final dish.

This was very good and quick. I made a few shortcuts which others alluded to. For one, I sauteed the shrimp in the garlic and oil before making the sauce as directed. For the orzo, I had no fresh basil so improvized with about 1/4 c pesto and a tablespoonful of basil oil, then added a few teaspoonfuls of dried basil to the sauce as it cooked as well.(I didn't add any other oil to the orzo)When I realized that this would serve more than 4, we invited friends on the spur of the moment and everyone raved. This will go into the permanent file.

Wow -- this is good -- and simple. I made it for guests, and they loved it. I made the sauce before I sauteed the shrimp, though. That way, I could let it simmer for longer. Because my guests were a bit late, I simmered the sauce for 40 minutes -- adding more white wine to keep it the correct consistency. I ended up using almost an entire bottle of wine -- but the results were amazing. Then, I sauteed the shrimp when my guests arrived, and popped the whole thing in the oven for 10 minutes. It came out perfect. What a great dish!

Rating: 3
This was good, but there were too many competing flavors in this recipe. I could barely taste the feta. If I made this again I would use half the amount of oregano and crushed red pepper, and somewhat less basil too. My husband thought it could use more tomatoes also.

What a fantastic recipe! I agree that adding toasted pine nuts to the orzo is a MUST, it creates a better texture and adds a lot to the flavour. After heating the dish in the oven, I plated up the individual servings and then sprinkled on the feta and put it back in the oven for just a few minutes; I think it improved the presentation a bit. I also think the amount of crushed red pepper was perfect, just the right kick! (others said it was too hot)

This is really, really, really, really good! I used frozen deveined shrimp, so it was super easy -- the only required chopping was 2 cloves of garlic & the basil. I made it exactly as written, except that I slightly undercooked the orzo, knowing it was going in the oven for further cooking, and also that I'd be eating it re-heated as well (I made it all for myself!). It came out perfectly.

Very good! Very light dish so if you have hearty eaters, make more. As instructed, I sauteed shrimp precisely 2 mins in the pan and then 10 mins of baking and they were perfectly cooked. (For less deveining work, I used large shrimp and cut those in half that seemed particularly large). Next time I'll season shrimp with a little salt while sauteeing. Otherwise, wouldn't change a thing.

This recipe was much better than I expected. I did make some changes, however. I did not have white wine, so I substituted red wine (I highly recommend using red wine) and I did strain the tomatoes so that I wouldn't have to reduce the sauce so long. I also followed the suggestion of cooking the shrimp in garlic and I cut the amount of feta cheese on top and that didn't seem to affect the taste. Overall, a very delicious and easy recipe that I will definitely be making again.

Excellent recipe! I made this following some of the suggestions by previous reviewers: I used the 16-20 per pound size of shrimp and sauteed for 30 seconds on each side, halved the olive oil at each step, put the feta on top of the dish and after the 10 minutes baking time, broiled it for a few minutes, and added blanched aspargus. A Keeper!

Perfect for a no-fuss evening. I couldn't get the sauce to thicken enough, so I cheated and threw in a little tomato paste. Delish! Next time I will try with the pine nuts as suggested. I think the nutty flavor will be a perfect compliment for this dish.

I wanted to make something a bit different for dinner and after reading the reviews, I made this dish! We all thought it was very tasty. I made it pretty much as stated. I was worried that the shrimp would over cook after sauteeing them then putting them in the oven for ten minutes. I just put them in a hot pan for about 30 seconds or so on each side and then baked them for the 10 minutes and they were perfect. These were the 16-20 per pound size. If you have the smaller shrimp I would plan accordingly. Also, 1/2 tsp. of crushed red pepper made it a bit spicy. For those who would like it less hot, maybe cut that back to 1/4 tsp. All in all I would certainly make this dish again.

Yum! Delicious and easy. I have made this twice and tonight, I cut the olive oil in half at each step (instead of two tablespoons in the orzo, just used one; cooked shrimp with 1T not 2, etc.). The version with less olive oil was not only lower in fat, but somehow better tasting. I think next time I make it, I'm going to put the feta on top of the dish before putting it in the oven, not after. When you have the leftovers in the microwave, the feta gets all melty and yummy. I think that effect would be nice to start with.

Fantastic recipe - very easy and satisfying, family and potluck-friendly. I added extra garlic to the shrimp while sautéing and used dried basil because I didn't feel like running out to get fresh; it still turned out fine. I thought it could use some extra vegetables so I threw in some mushrooms and red bell pepper to the tomato mixture before baking. I'm sure olives would be good, too. Like a few other people pointed out, reheated leftovers are a little bit soggy, but I thought it was still pretty good. No one complained, in any case. Will definitely make again.

This was delicious! I put baby spinach in with the orzo, used only 1 clove of garlic, and didn't use the red pepper.

What a great summer dish! Per another reviewer's suggestion I added almost a whole 6 oz. package of fresh baby spinach to the orzo, then added a few handfuls of coarsely chopped kalamata olives to the tomato sauce.

I had no fresh basil and substituted homemade pesto from my freezer, about 1 1/2 tbsp stirred into the orzo with 1 tbsp of olive oil, and about 1 1/2 tbsp in the sauce.

I also added some dill--I love the combination of dill and feta and have another dill, artichoke and feta orzo recipe that I love. Also, it seemed weird to me to just pour the tomato wine sauce on top, so I mixed everything together in the pan, added some feta on top (overall, used only about 1/2 cup feta) and baked. Used 1/2 the oil, too. Very tasty!!

I agree that this was a delicious and easy meal. I followed the other posters' suggestions, adding Kalamatas and lowering the amount of oil. I used freshwater shrimp, too, as I prefer the sweeter taste.

Just made this. I had all ingredients except OH OH, no ORZO! I thought I had some but no. Anyway, I substituted white long grain rice instead. No problem! I did add the kalamata olives, I liked the extra flavor they added. Also, I really think you need to use FRESH basil for this recipe. It's a big part of the flavor of the dish. Bottom line, good dish. I will make it again. I would like to try it with chicken tender breast meat too. I think that would also be good, and a lot less expensive! :-)

This has become a favorite of mine because it is so easy and so delicious. I buy uncooked deveined frozen shrimp from Trader Joe's and have added extras like mushrooms and spinach with great success.

I agreed with a cook before me on there being too much oil and used non-fat cooking spray in the baking dish instead. Also because I refuse to devein shrimp I used the 'ready to go' type and just rinsed them & added them and skipped the cooking them in oil part of the recipe as well. It all turned out wonderful! I would definitely recommend this.

I also added kalamata olives and it was really wonderful. I wouldn't describe this as "easy and quick", but that's just because I think deveining shrimp is a pain.

I've made this several times and loved it every time. Kalamata olives add so much depth. I've used both fresh and dried oregano. I also add extra crushed red pepper (we love spicy food). This dish is so easy and so satisfying. Tonight I'm adding artichoke hearts for the first time. I can't wait until dinner!!!

This was easy and delightful. It does have rather a lot of olive oil--has anyone tried cutting down on that a bit? I am trying re-warming tonight in a 180 degree oven covered till just hot through--hope the shrimp don't cook further and get tough. I tasted it cold, just before putting in the oven and the flavors just continue to improve--I hope it will take the heat.

This is a slightly different twist to a Greek classic. It was very easy and really delicious. I wouldn't recommend making ahead and re-heating, as the shrimp could get tough and the orzo turn to mush.

Tried to repair with frizzled martian antennae, nothing helped.

Simply delicious.... I tucked in artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers and tossed some roasted grape tomatoes in with the orzo. I made this for a crowd and made it a few hours ahead. I gently reheated it for 15-20 min. Will definetley make again.

Good recipe for a potluck. I made it ahead of time and popped it in the oven before serving. Several people asked for the recipe.

I made this fabulous recipe the other night for my husband and myself the other night. I cut the recipe in half, and it was the perfect amount for the two of us. It was so easy to make! I have already passed it along to some of my friends. I added a little extra feta cheese in with the orzo to make it creamier. This recipe will definitely become a staple in our house.

The preparation is simple, but the taste is flavorful and sophisticated. The best of both worlds.

Quick, easy and tasty. It has become a an instant staple. Without the shrimp, the orzo dish makes an excellent side dish for roasted or grilled fish, chicken or lamb.

This is a great dinner party dish. It's easy to make in large quantity, but still very "elegant". I'll definitely use this one again.

I love it! It is very easy to make and very delicious. I made it with small salad shrimp, added kalamata olives and served cold at a pot-luck at work and every one loved it. It was the hit of the day and everyone asked for the recepie.

I gave this 4 forks because it was delicious, and on top of that very fast and easy to make as a weeknight dinner. I used frozen, peeled shrimp and made it under 20 minutes. It's become a new staple recipe.

This quickly became a favorite! I made a few minor adjustments - 4 tsp. fresh oregano and crushed tomatoes in puree. I also add 1/4 cup kalamata olives. I've even tried it with chicken tenders instead of shrimp - excellent!

so simple and great. two things i did...i substituted traditional greek kefelateri cheese for the parmesean. it isn't as common so most greek recipes that ususally call for this cheese just put parmeasean in the recipe fro convenience. secondly i reversed the order of the feta cheese inclusion -- i put almost 3/4 in the orzo miixture and sprinkled the remaining on the top. i had purchased some fantastic imported greek and bulgarian fetas (which i mixed) and wanted to melt/infuse it into the dish versus just sprinkling. what an easy and tasty dish!!!

Tasty flavors, easy do-ahead...great recipe for either weeknight or company! Can easily be doubled. Have made it several times, and will use it regularly as I usually have the ingredients in the pantry and freezer. Also very healthful if you are watching your calories like I am; just reduce amount of feta in topping!

This was a wonderful, sophisticated dish! We had celebrated our 35th anniversary two days ago with a family restaurant celebration. But this was just for the two of us today. AWESOME! Look forward to preparing this for company.

this dish was fast, easy and delicious! My husband loved it so much we are making it for guests that are coming over this weekend!

we loved this recipe! the only thing i do differently is cook the shrimp fully and then serve it over the orzo instead of baking the whole thing. it's delicious and easy.

Thanks Joyce, I'll always remember this recipe -from the first time you cooked it! Also, a cottage Easter dinner was complete - and a huge hit with kids and adults!

Loved it. Easy and delicious. Used a nice Pinot Grigio (and served the rest with dinner). An instant hit.

This was perfect. I used dill instead of basil, and all of my dinner guests announced that they HATE dill (gasp!) but loved this dish (whew!). The red pepper is great, just a little kick.

a delicious, low-fuss meal that my boyfriend is still raving about. he couldn't wait for dinner-time the next night so he could eat the leftovers! didn't change a thing.

Made this the other night. It was quick, visually appealing and, most importantly, tasted wonderful. The basil adds a lot of flavor although dill would also be good. Use good quality diced tomatoes. This would be a really good "make ahead" dish - then just pop it in the oven.
