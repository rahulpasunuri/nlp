Too soupy and WAY too sweet. I followed the recipe and cooked the mixture for 45 minutes (after the 18 minutes the recipe stated, my rice was still near raw). It was really sweet before I added the bananas---after the bananas, it was sickeningly sweet.

I'm sad to report that I was disappointed by this recipe. I've kept it for years and finally made it, so maybe my expectations were too high. I was a little concerned by the fat in the recipe, so I used 2% instead of the cream and skim instead of the whole milk. While I am certain this altered the outcome, I'm not sure I would have preferred it any more if I made the higher fat version. The rice absorbed the milk nicely and had a good consistency; I just didn't think the flavor was all that interesting (again, the lack of fat probably contributed to this).

I the base recipe sounds very nice, though too high-cal for my taste. I loosely followed along, but changed the whole milk to 1% and the heavy cream to whole. I had to add flavor back in with vanilla and homemade peach- amaretto liqueur. I also used arborio rice because that's what I had on hand. I got raw pistachios, not knowing what kind to get, but when I tasted the final recipe, it was obvious that this was seriously missing richness, so I quickly roasted and dumped in some more, and I'll make sure next time that the banana is more ripened, with some brown on the peel so that its flavor is more pronounced as well. I recommend adding in cardamom pods, not just ground cardamom. And I skipped the nutmeg, but added freshly ground cinnamon, allspice, and a few clove pods. So I made it a bit changed up, but still faithful to the concept, and it's lovely.

Made this for a crowd at my sister's engagement party 2 yrs. ago. Was fabulous & easy. Lots of oohs & ahs. Went in a flash. Will make it again this summer.

We loved this recipe. It is easy to prepare - must make sure that the basmati rice kernels are soft enough - thus, I found that the mixture needed to be simmered longer than described. Also, I used brown instead of white sugar and thought it was wonderful - much fuller body to the taste.

I think my pot wasn't hot enough on simmer...so I had to continue cooking it for at least 45 minutes...it was a slow simmer and so it didn't boil or overcook. But I do think the longer I simmered it, the more moisture the rice absorbed. As a result, I don't think I had all the excess liquid everyone has commented on. Our guests loved it. The pistachios and the spices made this a perfect ending to a wonderful meal. There were no leftovers.

This is a great dish - dress it up for the end of an Indian or Middle Eastern dinner party, or make a batch for your 2 year-old. Not that you need to, but if you want a small variation substitute a can of coconut milk (the lite kind is fine) for the heavy cream. If you don't like pistachios, almonds work almost as well.

I made this on St. Patrick's Day for a large Irish group. Most of the group love Pistachio's while I do not. Over all I thought it was good but the rest of the group loved it. Wouldn't change a thing about the recipe but just note that it does thicken when it chills-do not worry if it appears too watery in the beginning.

Mmmmmeeey (if that's a word). This recipe was amazing. I made a few changes. Instead of cream I used 2% milk and nixed the bananas. It was more liquidy but I like it that way and so did the other 10 people that I made it for. Would I make this again? How about stop me from making it again. I'm so addicted to this and my butt's getting bigger by the minute.

Didn't blow me away! I found that it was definately lacking liquid. Once cooked I added much more milk before serving. Next time I would add a bit more cardomom, more cinnamon and milk. Pistac. were a great addition.

I like, I like, I like! Made it for friends who love ANYTHING with rice and they were blown away. I never cared for rice puddings until I made this one... Merci!
