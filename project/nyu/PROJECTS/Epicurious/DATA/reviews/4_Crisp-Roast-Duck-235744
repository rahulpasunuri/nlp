Wow, this was the first time I tried Long Island Duck and I am so upset that it took me 40 years to have one. I followed the recipe, added a bit of minced garlic to the rub and turned the oven off for the last 20 minutes. No need for a sauce, it was perfect by itself. It was the best meat I have ever made myself. I can't wait to try it at a restaurant for comparative purposes.

Couple things. First, the cooking time is way too long. A 5-6 lb duck should roast at 425 for about 15-20 min and 350 for about another hour and 15. total cooking time, 1 1/2 hours. If you want crispy skin try a dry brine for a few hours or up to 24 hours. Simply cover the skin with kosher salt and let rest in the fridge. You should also carefully score the skin to help the fat render (before the dry brine). As the bird roasts, collect the rendered fat and reserve for other uses, never throw away good duck fat. This recipe will yield crispy skin, but it will also cook the hell out of the duck. I prefer a medium rare to medium duck. It is possible to have crispy skin and medium rare, you just have to prep the duck as mentioned above. For me, this is not an ideal method.

the first time i made it, it made the smoke alarm go off so much we took it outside-- but i did achieve a crispy fabulous crust and followed the recipe to a T (however my oven runs HOT). now making it again for my daughter's birthday, but adjusting the time and temperature according to the last experience. also using all the leftover skin, neck and pieces to make stock. YAY.

I did the 30-30-30 cooking time and it was cooked through, so thank you, everyone, for making this easier for those of us arriving to the recipe after you! That said, I didn't achieve crispy skin. And I would have been okay with medium breast meat in lieu of that, but this was definitely cooked through. I'd still make it again, but my expectations won't be as high as the Peking ducks I've had in Beijing and Monterey Park!

Tasty! I've just made this for our pre-Thanksgiving dinner, and three of us picked everything to the bones. Just a few little pieces for our dog as his treat. We are still licking our fingers. The skin is very crisp, and the meat is judy. I've taken the advise of others, and did not reserve the water after poring hot water. Other than that, I've followed every steps for a 5lb bird. It came out perfectly. Definitely a keeper.

Never had prepared a roast duck. This recipe looked easy, and the reviews really helped. Well, the duck we prepared was exceptional. The skin and meat just about melted in our mouths! We served it with a roasted red raspberry chipotle sauce given to us for Christmas, and the combination is definitely a keeper. If you have never tried roasting a duck, this is the recipe for you (and me, since we'll be doing this for special occasions).

I was rather disappointed with the recipe. The duck was quite bland and tasteless. I followed the recipe closely so perhaps there is a difference in "duck".

Very easy to make and crispy and delicious! I have made this 2 times and both times were very good. The second time around I made a few minor adjustments and it turned out even crispier and more delicious. I salted and peppered duck, wrapped in plastic wrap, and put in fridge over night. To get truly crispy skin, after poking skin all over with a fork, I par boiled the duck for 5 minutes to really shrink the skin and melt off excess fat. Then I followed the recipe almost exactly just shortening the last 45 minutes by about 10-15 minutes. I brushed the duck with an apricot bourbon glaze for the last 10 minutes or so (just bourbon, apricot jam , fresh ground pepper and a little butter)and it came out fabulous! Enjoy!

Delicious crispy succulent duck. I followed the recipe exactly as written except that I shortened the total cooking time by about 15 minutes. I think the 30-30-30 is probably not enough. I used a Pekin duck from D'artagnan that was exactly within the weight range specified.

I had never made duck before, but after seeing this recipe I decided to try it, but with a couple of differences. I skipped the hot water step. Instead let the duck sit in the fridge overnight. Before putting the seasoning on the duck I rubbed it it olive oil and I also added micned garlic to the kosher salt and black pepper. I own a rotisserie so I made the duck in there instead of an oven. Roasted it for 90 mins. The duck came out great! My husband, mother and mother in law loved it! I thought it was a tad too salty so I will reduce the amount of kosher salt next time, but that is just my preference... everyone else thought it was wonderful.

My husband loves duck and he loved this recipe. It was the first time I ever made duck and it was so easy and delicious. I also used the 30-30-30 minute method, but the last 30 I made 45 minutes. I served it with a cranberry orange relish. Delicious, I would make this again. Although I think next time I will have to make 2 since 1 duck only fed 3 people.

Perfect roast duck recipe. I was cooking two ducks at the same time, and they were slightly different weights. They both came out perfect at the same time. This is easy and foolproof, and that is a good thing when roasting duck.

This is my go-to duck recipe because it is easy and showcases the duck. However, I did not need the full 2 3/4 hours.. My duck was done in an hour and a half, so keep that in mind and consider turning the duck a third time a bit sooner in order to get the breast crisp. My friend told me a funny trick to get the duck dry that works pretty nicely: put it in front of a small tabletop fan.. makes drying faster and easier.

This is the second year we've made this duck for Thanksgiving (just the two of us) and both years it was absolutely delicious. Didn't need full final 45 minutes. A lovely treat at the holidays and so easy.

The duck was absolutely delicious. I bought two ducks (mapleleaffarms.com) and the meat fell off the bone. I did roast the ducks for 20 minutes more breast side up at the every end to make them crispier (2 x 45 minutes was not enough for a 5 lb duck - the breasts were not crispy yet). I also made stocking from the drippings by adding previously made duck stock.

I guess it depends on the duck. I couldn't get any Pekin duck. The first time I made it, I used a duck from Ontario and with the advice of other reviewers concerning temperature, it was perfect. Last night I used a duck from Quebec. Still nice and crispy, but much tougher. Have lots of fat for sauteing potatoes though. All in all, I think its the best recipe I've ever found for roasting duck.

We love duck, but this recipe didn't work out like we had hoped. It wasn't crisp and frankly, wasn't that good. We reduced the heat, but we were just disappointed. It would seem that when recipes require some rather important adjustments, it might help to amend the recipe, rather than expect people to read 50 reviews. Sorry. I don't like to write these kinds of things.

I've tried duck before and it didn't turn out well, but this recipe made it easy and the outcome was delicious. The recipe doesn't mention how much water to use or to keep in the roasting pan, but from reading other reviews it looked like retaining some water in the pan was worthwhile to reduce the smokiness of the fat. I used 2 cups of boiling water to pour over the bird, which if you prick the skin, you can immediately see it tighten onto the meat as you pour the hot water. I then drained all the water in order to season the bird but then poured half (1 cup) back into the roasting pan, around the duck so that the bottom of the pan was lightly covered with water. The other tip I used and appreciated from other reviewers was the 30-30-30 rule (although I high broiled mine for 2 mins to finish and make the skin extra crispy!). I served with roasted red potatoes which I used the excess duck skin to taste, along with sweet peas. My family loved it, and my 6 year old daughter who had never had duck before cleaned the bone on 2 wings and can't wait for the next time I make it. I highly recommend this method, it's easy and a highly enjoyable way to prepare a duck dinner.

This was my first time cooking (actually my first time tasting) duck, and this recipe made it a cinch! I skipped the water step, but made sure to baste the duck during the final cooking with its own juices. The skin was phenomenal--very crispy and just packed with flavor! I mixed up a sauce using a little butter, the duck drippings, and some orange-ginger jam, and it was the perfect complement to the rich meat of the bird. Excellent!

After making and devouring this duck, i sent a mass email with the link to the recipe to all my foodie friends. I never mass mail, but this recipe is that good. I pretty much followed the recipe, except that I let my duck sit in the fridge overnight uncovered to air dry the skin and roasted about 10 minutes less than recommended. I know all ovens are different but 45-45-45 at 425 is a bit too long for a 5lb duck. Gorgeous crispy skin, tender meat. Went really well with a simple balsamic reduction and a green salad. An extremely easy and rewarding recipe.

This was my very first time making duck. I don't think that I poked the skin deep enough (I was afraid to pierce the skin) because I did have a good amount of fat under the skin after cooking and it wasn't overly crispy. That being said, duck is so good that I think it's hard to severely mess this up. It was delicious.

First time attempting duck. Turned out well, guests enjoyed it. I read the reviews and knew to watch the heat towards the end, and after the 2nd 45 minutes the thigh was already registering over 180 with a fork thermometer so I took it out to rest. Since it didn't finish breast-up the skin didn't get very crisp. If/when I try duck again, I'll probably try the pre-steam & roast method, or rotisserie. But this was a great first time recipe.

This was the best duck recipe I've tried and so easy. I usually use Julia Child's Canard a l'Orange, but wanted to try something simpler. I followed the recipe exactly, except I stuffed the duck with two small lemons and three garlic cloves. I didn't have a roaster, so I sat the duck on a raft of carrots, which were mighty tasty later on, caramelized in duck fat. The skin was wonderfully crisp and brown, just like the picture. The meat was moist and just fell off the bone. Perfect.

Perfect recipe. I bought a duck in NYC's Chinatown and prepared it according to the recipe. I reduced the amount of salt to one teaspoon, and it was more than enough salt for my tastes. My only objection is the notion of saving the boiling water in the roasting pan. It only gets in the way of saving the wonderful liquid gold that is the duck fat. Next time, I'll pat dry the bird before putting it on the rack, and just roast as directed, without water in the pan. Here is a photo of the completed bird: http://photos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/hs060.snc3/14737_213783384202_673499202_4232751_1475634_n.jpg

This was the best duck recipe I have ever tried - really crispy and not fatty - learned a lot from trying it and next time I will leave the oven rack in the middle of the oven as the recipe states instead of towards the top of the oven as a reader suggested -- must depend on your oven -- and also would adjust roasting time so most of it is breast side up for crisping as several bloggers suggest -- also 5 -6 pound LI duck does not need 2 1/4 hrs at 425 -- more like 1 1/2 hours - depending on your oven - a meat thermometer is helpful

Rating: 4
I also pulled it out earlier. It would be better to shorten the cooking time when it's upside down and let it have the full cooking time with the skin up to help with crisping. It's a shame with this recipe that the duck fat is compromised by the water and has to be discarded as it's fantastic for potatoes.

I have a question - do you keep all the water in the pan or throw it away before cooking? It would seem that the duck would steam if you keep the water in the pan. I would think you'd want to cook it dry to crisp it.

I've made this several times with varying results but it's mostly terrific. You've got to strike a balance between a crispy crust and not dry out the meat altogether. When you do, you'll create a memorable meal.

This recipe was a disaster! This cooking temperature is way too high for duck. The grease spattered, burned, and smoked so badly I was afraid the oven would catch fire. The smell was acrid and everyone lost their appetitie long before dinner was ready. I had to turn the temp down to 350F degrees for the remaining half hour, but the oven continued to smoke. Like other reviewers, I noted that cooking time is way too long, so I checked the temp of the bird and took it out at 175F degrees. The duck meat was like rubber, vulcanized by too high heat. The skin was not crispy. My All Clad pan will take alot of scrubbing and polishing to restore. Day two, I have a repeat of the smoke with the self-cleaning oven. Never again!

I have made Duck many times, and I am soooo changing to this recipe. I added 1 teas poultry seasoning and a little more kosher salt to the recipe, placed fresh rosemary and fresh celery stalks on the sides of the duck in the pan.(Not inside) It would have been overcooked and the ducks I had were nearly 7 pounds. I turned down the oven to 300 the last 45, and then after about 20 min turned off completely. I never let it rest because it just sat there while we prepped for dinner. One thing: if it didn't turn out right for others, I suggest the water was not hot enough. It must really be boiling to shrink the skin. Incredible! Also I put the ducks on the upper middle racks about 4 inches from the top.

I took it out of the overn at 180 at the thigh. I am glad I took it out early. Delicious!

We've never cooked duck before, but the reviews of this recipe made it seem like a good first try. We weren't disappointed! Just as the previous reviews stated it was easy to follow, the bird was moist, and the skin deliciously crispy. We'll definitely make this again. The only change will be to tie the wings to the bird- they came out too dry and crunchy this time.

I used an 8 lb goose instead of a duck and followed the recipe almost to the tee. It turned out very crisp and pretty juicy (I saw the reviews of dry meat so even though my bird was 8 lbs, stuck with the same amount of time). The only complaint is that you really don't get a ton of meat off a duck or a goose, compared to fat turkeys! But it was very good, even without a sauce.

This was a good basic duck recipe. It was not greasy. The meat was well cooked. But, it was not very tender. I would not recommend stuffing the cavity as this does not allow the fat to drip out and down into the bottomside of the bird. The dripping is part of what makes it so crispy. I will make it again, probably.

Crispy, lovely, simple and very tasty way to make duck. I have pulled a tip from another recipe for duck, and stuff the cavity with fresh lavender.
