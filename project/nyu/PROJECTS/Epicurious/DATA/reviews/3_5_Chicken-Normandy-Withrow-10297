This was a delicious and surprisingly sweet dish. While I enjoyed it immensely, my mouth and my plate was left wanting. To counteract this, I will pepper and salt chicken before flouring them. I will add more thyme to the chicken as well; it is too bland in this sweet dish. I added more thyme and pepper to bubbling sauce after the addition of cream, which spiced it up a bit. I wanted more mushrooms and pecans to garnish my chicken. The pecans were very attractive when halfed or quartered instead of chopped. Allow the sauce time to simmer (five to ten minutes) after completion. I will also be adding roasted balsamic grapes or cranberries on the side to add a POP in my mouth and my plate. This will contrast the sweet dish well and bring color to the bland appearance of the plate. Roasted Balsamic Grapes- http://projects.washingtonpost.com/recipes/2003/11/19/roasted-balsamic-grapes

This was delicious. I served it with stuffing, which was such a perfect compliment that it should be included in the recipe!

We just loved this one. Great fall chicken recipe. Substitions: Applejack for the brandy; cider for apple juice; just granny smith apples. Added a couple of minutes to all the cooking times, but my chicken was kind of thick. There is a lot of sauce for the amount of chicken - you could probably double the chicken and have enough sauce. Served with popovers and acorn squash.

I made this recipe exactly as written, except I didn't peel the apples. The sauce was very loose (much lke plain heavy cream would have been, and there was about twice as much sauce as I needed. Are the apples supposed to break down into the sauce? I didn't peel my apples, perhaps this was the problem. Regardless, the flavor was delicious and rich. The sauce kept the chicken very moist. I will definately make again. Next time I will mix the leftover sauce with pureed squash to make soup!

I made this for dinner tonight and although my husband really liked it, I thought it was just okay--not bad, just not great. Probably wouldn't make again, because there are so many other good chicken recipes out there.

This recipe was fine, the taste was ok. Made just as written but substituted dry white for the brandy. It was good but I don't think I would make it again.

Very nice recipe. As usual, I cut up the chicken. I used undiluted non-fat evaporated milk. I served it over rice.

Very delish. A native Normande made this for me a few years ago and I've been searching for a recipe (he made it from memory) that matched it in flavor and texture. This was very close. Next time I think I'll cut the apples smaller, but it was great overall. Alot easier than I would have imagined.

This was nice. I think I will try it again and serve it over wild rice to give it more substance. Good Luck.

This was an easy to follow process and I found subsituting Pine Nuts for Pecans was a good choice. Another variation is using less congac and replacing the apple juice with Dry cider. I recently tried this at a restraunt in Calias and found that it was easy to duplicate at home.

I loved this dish, but made a few substitutions: I needed to use up some applesauce, so instead of all of the apples, used about 1 c. of homemade applesauce. I used a small can of mushroom pieces and stems instead of fresh. I used walnuts instead of pecans. I used olive oil instead of peanut oil. All in all, this is a fantastic dish, but I found there to be MORE than enough 'sauce.' When I make it again, I will substitute Calvados for Brandy and omit the apple juice altogether. I had to serve it in pasta bowls, there was so much sauce. I had to cook it a little longer than the final 3 minutes, too.

I didn't have chicken, so I substituted pork and it was still very good. The sauce kept the meat moist and lent a delicious flavor. I would give this meal 2.5 forks....meat and sauce was wonderful but my family wasn't crazy about the mushroom-apple-nut mixture.
