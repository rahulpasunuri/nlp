Delicious and easy. I didn't make the sabayon or unmold--just served in custard cups with mixed berries. Also, I substituted half-and-half for the heavy cream.

I love this recipe. It's easy to make ahead, holds beautifully when served and has a lovely tang in combination with the berries. I've also made it with bananas sauteed in clarified butter and cooled to room temperature. Guests love this one.

My roommates and I absolutely loved this recipe. (In the words of Robin, "This one's a keeper!") I made the Panna Cotta mid-morning and it was firmly set 8 hours later. It was creamy yet held its shape, and came out of the metal molds very easily after a dip in warm water. The Sabayon was good; I made it with alcoholic Iced Apple Cider instead of wine and orange liquor, and served with berries. Very easy preparation for such a beautiful, sophisticated dessert.
