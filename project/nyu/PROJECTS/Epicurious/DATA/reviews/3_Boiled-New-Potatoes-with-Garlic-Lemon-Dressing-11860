This turned out pretty bland. I would suggest boiling the potatoes in chicken stock. Using butter instead of olive oil in the sauce and light on the lemon.

These were excellent. Prepared them exactly according to instructions. I even used some of the sauce over my poached halibut.

We loved this. I added frozen cut green beans and left out the parsley. I used an assortment of little potatoes bought from the farmers market, just cut in half or quarters. Very easy and unique. Our dinner guests loved it.

We halved the recipe and although the potatoes were a hit with my 18-year-old daughter, we would've liked more of the garlic-lemon-olive oil dressing. And maybe a bit more garlic.

I have been making this recipe since it was published in 1994 and it has always been a hit without adjustments.

These potatoes looked nice and tasted great! I will definitely be making them again.

I knew I liked all the ingredients for this recipe however, I took into consideration what the previous reviewers had said and I decided to adapt it a little bit. First, do not boil the garlic with the potatoes. Boil the potatoes for the 15 minutes in salted water. Set aside. Saute all the remaining ingredients in the olive oil and pour over the potatoes. Keep warm & covered until ready to serve. DELICIOUS!!!

I found the recipe different but if I was to make it again I would cut the dressing in half as I don't like too much sauce. Next I would use roasted garlic instead of boiling it with the potatoes... my garlic didn't mash up properly. A shot of hot pepper sauce and lots of salt and pepper will give it the kick it needs. Once played around with a bit, it could turn out to be a recipe that I will use again and again.

The lemon and garlic had an unusual flavor and did not blend well with the potatoes.
