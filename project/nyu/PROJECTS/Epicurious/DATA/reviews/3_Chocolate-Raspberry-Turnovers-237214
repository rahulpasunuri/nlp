Thought I'd make these for guests for Valentines, but glad I tried a half recipe in advance. Noted the "oozing" problem of prior reviewers, so sealed edges with fork. However, the length of time for baking is way too long! Turned them after 9 min., and within 3 or 4 min. more, I smelled a burning smell, which turned out to be the jam, probably, as 2 or 3 had oozed, but the turnovers, themselves, were overly browned and charred on the bottom. Used parchment, used middle rack. Waste of ingredients - flavor not that exciting after all that effort - maybe they'd have been better had not the charring effected flavor.

My friends and I made these in our dorm kitchen last night (with a few adjustments to the procedure - we didn't have a rolling pin). If we can do it at college, anyone can do it at home. Most of the turnovers oozed filling out of the seams, but some people enjoyed the "caramelized" (read: slightly burned) flavor of the leaked preserves.

Flavor was great, but big problem with raspberry oozing out and burning. You really need to seal the packets very well.

Very good recipe. I added chopped roasted walnuts to each pastry for added texture and flavor. They went over quite well with my coworkers. Although the recipe requests simply pressing the dough to seal it, it's best to use a fork to do this. I found several of the finger pressed pockets oozing during baking. It also makes for a less messy preparation.
