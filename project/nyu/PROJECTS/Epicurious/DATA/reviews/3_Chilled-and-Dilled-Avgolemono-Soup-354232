This is delicious, silky and refreshing. It did curdle, but I just pureed it again, and, voila, silky smooth.

Excellent recipe. I didn't strain it and was liberal with the chicken flavour and the dill. Lives up to the "hot" version. But cool.

I found this to be lovely and light. I didn't strain it, didn't truly measure the dill, but it lives up to the "hot" version. But cool. :)

This soup is bland. Not worth the time or the effort.

I've been dying for new cold soup recipes after tiring of the old standbys. This is a light, refreshing summer twist to the traditional avgolemeno, but can't hold a candle to the hot avgolemeno from my favorite greek restaurant. I would have liked it a bit creamier and richer (I didn't strain it because I wanted more texture). I used cooked left-over rice, and a purple scallion for a little color. The dill is delicious but next time I might try fresh greek oregano instead. Overall, a great soup to serve cold.

Question to the two previous reviewers - you rated this recipe 4 forks - did you actually try it? Or were you just commenting on the origin?

It is original Greek soup. The cooked rice is added to the soup at the end. Egg yolks are mixed in to the soup and cooked to thicken soup. (Not boiling)

my mother-in-laws recipe, but it was served warm - maybe Turkish style? Good soup, hearty.
