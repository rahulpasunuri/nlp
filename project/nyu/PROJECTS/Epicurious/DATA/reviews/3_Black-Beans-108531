See additional comments on an earlier posting -- this is a great base -- just be creative with it!

This is a good basic recipe. I added the following and it was wonderful! for doubled recipe: 1/2 c chopped fresh basil; 1/2 c chopped fresh parsely; 1/4 c chopped fresh chives; 1/4 c chopped fresh oregano; 3 chopped shallots; 2 minced cloves garlic; 1/2 tsp cumin; 2-3 good pinches of red pepper flakes (approx. 1/4-1/2 tsp); 1/2 chopped green pepper; 1/2 medium chopped sweet (vidalia) onion; I did not use epazote. In olive oil I sauted the garlic, shallots, onion and peppers, then added the spices, salt, and water. I only needed 9 cups of water for 2 cups of black beans that had been soaked overnight in water. The dish had too much liquid and was a little salty, so I added 2 thickly-sliced yukon gold potatoes and let it cook down a little. I served it over brown rice, with the following optional "toppings" on the side: chopped sweet onions, salsa, additional chopped basil (cilantro would have been good too), and some ground turkey cooked in taco seasonings. Salad served with it was lots of thinly sliced cucumber, red onions and carrots mixed with just a little bit of torn leaf lettuce. Add a little brown bread or tortillas and you have a very satisfying meal that would be great to serve to a mixed vegetarian and carnivore crowd.

I guess this is OK if you are in a hurry for an after work meal. I would rather use dried beans and fresh epazote. Make a double batch on the weekend and freeze half for an easy weeknight meal. A famous Mexican chef once told me that dried epazote is like dried basil or parsley--why bother? (Although, if you don't have a Mexican market available for fresh, dried might be better than nothing, but I'm not sure.)
