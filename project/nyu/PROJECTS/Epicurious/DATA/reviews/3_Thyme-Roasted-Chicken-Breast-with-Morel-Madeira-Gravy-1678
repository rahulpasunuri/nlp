This recipe was so good! i added lots of fresh morels in conjunction with the dried morels...the gravy was so rich and flavorful! The chicken was perfectly cooked and so moist. i always use D'artagnan or Bell & Evans though, as i think a high quality chicken can make a big difference.

Made the gravy but with shiitake mushrooms instead. Very tasty but very thick. Next time I'll probably cut the cornstarch down to 1 1/2t.

All I can say about this recipe is that it is fine. It certainly didn't knock my socks off or make me want to ask for seconds. If you are strictly a meat and potatoes type of person and dislike spice this might be a dish for you. But it is expensive to prepare, a decent amount of time for what I felt was a just okay type of meal

I don't agree at all with the other reviews. This was not good, was time consuming, and a waste of expensive morels. I doubled the recipe and had way too much sauce for the amount of chicken.

Easy and excellent gravy - I roasted cornish hens instead of using the chicken breasts and added the drippings to the gravy. I also stuffed the hens with lots of fresh tyme.

I made this recipe for a Sunday dinner and it was delicious! I used regular dried white mushrooms and it worked fine (of course I've never tasted it with morels, so I can't really give a comparative analysis). I did notice that my reducing times were much longer than noted in the recipe, but that was probably because I tripled the recipe (lol). But the reducing was worth the effort as the flavors were very intense. JC Foodie

This was delicious. I made it exactly as the recipe stated. The chicken breasts came out perfectly. In addition, I needed to make it the day before and it tasted just as if I had just made it. I just put the chicken breasts with a little gravy in the oven to warm and reheated the majority of the gravy on the stove. Don't forget to add some fresh thyme just before serving - for the flavor and for the presentation!

This recipe is all about the gravy which is excellent. I pan fried boneless, skinless chicken breasts for 2 minutes per side then baked them on convection for 15 minutes. They were really moist and tender. I couldn't bring myself to throw out the onion, etc from the gravy so I served them in a separate bowl. I made mashed potatoes and Sauteed Spinach & Garlic (G 2/96) as accompaniments for a great meal.

Exceptionally good dish- worth your time. Of course sauce is key ingredient so pay attention to cleaning the morels.

This was amazing! I skipped browning on the stove first, and just popped the chicken in the oven for about 40 minutes. The skin was crispy and the chicken turned out perfectly juicy. The only changes I made were to use regular white mushrooms instead of morels (and subbed chicken broth for the mushroom soaking liquid), and made up a roasted-garlic and cheese stuffing for under the skin. The gravy was delicious, and both my husband and I thought the whole recipe was fabulous.

Great dish but just a tip to the other cooks: This type of technique is called pan roasting. Browning on the stovetop allows the crisp, outer skin, and the oven time is to finish the cooking allowing tender, juicy meat. If done properly, the results are wonderful.

Forget the oven section and just do the entire process on the stovetop. Sauce is great and the chicken doesn't have an opportunity to dry out.

The sauce is absolutely yummy. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. And, I couldn't find morels, so next time, I'll add them.

Brown the chicken in the skillet. Forget the oven. The whole recipe can be cooked on top of the stove in 30 minutes after the chicken is browned. Try with chicken tenders, too, only brown the chicken and remove from skillet. Complete recipe and return chicken to pan for 5 mins.

Something weird about the preparation. Maybe frying the chicken first then baking it kinda dried it out a little. Texture wasn't what I expected. Did NOT reheat well the next day. Sauce was delicious, though. Oh well, how many ways can you get creative with chicken? Go figure.
