I was really disappointed in the cake. It is so dense and chewy, it gets stuck in your mouth like peanut butter. I guess some people don't mind or even enjoy that sort of texture, but not me.

Excellent texture and great flavor. I'll definitely make again. I've had trouble w/ lemon cake textures in the past, but this one worked beautifully. I made these minor changes: doubled the zest (still could have used more) used regular all-purpose flour not cake flour used a lemon glaze instead of white chocolate frosting baked it into a mini bunt cake pan (~20 min bake tim)

I made as a breakfast cake, so deleted icing and divided batter into two 8.5 x 4.5 x 2.5 loaf pans. Baked at 350 degrees with convection on for 50 min(since deeper than would be in 9 inch round pans). Sprinkled with powdered sugar just prior to serving. Delicious cake, batter was slightly dense, but had a very light texture. Did not have any buttermilk, but substituted 1 Tbs of lemon juice in 1 cup of milk and let it stand for 10 minutes. Only issue I had was that my fresh blueberries sunk to the bottom of the pan despite tossing them with flour prior to folding them into the batter.

I have made this recipe several times, and it always turns out delicious! Huge crowd pleaser. Addressing all the comments about its denseness: it is more dense than most other cake recipes, but it is extremely moist, (more so than lighter cakes) so the denseness is not a problem. The best way to describe the texture is somewhere between that of a flourless cake and a butter cake. The only thing which may be causing reviewers to complain of the desnity is if they are overworking their batter. When flour is overworked, it encourages the formation of gluten, which will make the end product taste coarse and tough, which would be extra unappetizing with the denseness of this recipe. Just be sure to only mix your batter (once dry ingredients are added to wet) just until blended. Wouldn't change a thing about recipe. Don't think it needs extra lemon zest, already lemony enough.

This is a wonderful recipe, so easy to make. My friend recently made it for her daughters wedding cake. I helped her, we made the recipe times 8 batches and it was a 4 tier beautiful cake.The icing held up wonderfully and the caterer decorated it with white orchids.

This is a great white chocolate frosting recipe. If you want to use the recipe for another type of cake, substitute 2 TBSP milk for the the 2 TBSP lemon juice. Makes a huge difference!

Rating: 2
I only made the frosting. It was good but didn't have a very pronounced white chocolate flavor, seemed more just like cream cheese frosting. Also the consistency is a little scary to work with. It goes from rock hard when cold to pretty runny when at room temperature. I added 1 cup of powdered sugar as insurance to keep it from sliding off the cake at room temp. Would probably not make again since the taste of the white chocolate was lost. Just seems like a waste of expensive ingredients.

Before making this cake I read all the reviews...wow! Lot's of differnt thoughts. First of all I didn't have 2 in. high 9in wide pans,mine were an 1 1/2 in. high so I use 3 pans & baked for about 35 mins.Since I wasn't sure I would have enough frosting I decided to use another recipe for the center filling "Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting" it was yummy.It had lemon curd in it so a little stronger flavor. Regarding the frosting when blended it seemed a little to soft so I refrigerated it, however don't do this to long because I noticed the chocolate started to harden within the frosting so I had to let it sit a few minutes and mix again real well. I do agree with some of the other reviews that it could use a more lemony flavor so I will do that next time. It had a beautiful presentation, sat high, put thin sliced lemons on the top like the pix from the magazine and shaved chocolate on top. Will definitely make again.

I like to bake and even though cakes are not my favorites I have made a share of them with good results. This cake has such polarizing reviews, I didn't know what to think but took a risk. I DIDN'T CARE FOR IT'S DENSITY AT ALL. The flavor was good but the texture was like nothing I've tasted before. I didn't like it. I wouldn't recommend to make it for company the first time you make it. As I found out the hard way. My problem could have been that I didn't have cake flour and I used a replacement (all purpose flour and corn starch). I will try it again just because the flavor was good. I did use more lemon as indicated in other reviews and don't forget to use GOOD quality chocolate and definitely melt it in the Microwave for 1 minute and a half.

Wow, this cake was awesome. Nice and dense and moist. I added about a cup of powdered sugar, couple tablespoons of grated lemon peel, and the juice of a lemon to the frosting recipe. Gave it a nice, fresh tangy flavor. Next time I might add an extra 1/2 cup of powdered sugar to the frosting. I used frozen blueberies and their color give the cake a nice purple-blue swirl. I used 3 9x1 1/2 inch cake pans.

This is the best cream cheese frosting recipe! Typically I find cream cheese frostings to be either too sweet or not sweet enough - here, finally, is a recipe that achieves that perfect balance. This is better than any buttercream too. It will be my standard white frosting from now on.

This is the best cake recipe in the entire world! I wouldnt change the recipe except i did add over 3 cups of blueberries, lemon extract to the cake and frosting and plenty of lemon zest... This intensified the lemon flavor. Everyone in my family requests this cake!! I made it into a 3 tier cake for my cousins engagement party and a 6 tier cake for my grandparents anniversary party over the summer... I am still heariing from all how fantastic the cake was!. ( Cake can be made up to a week ahead a time.. just wrap layers and freeze)

I Love this recipe! My daughter requests it for her birthday time and time again, and my father does too. I've made him many lemon desserts, but this is his favorite. I love the dense texture of the cake and the ease of the icing recipe, the chocolate and cream cheese give it a great spreading consistency. I do add some additional zest to the cake and frosting because my family are such lemon-lovers. This cake gets rave reviews whenever I serve it!

Rating: 3
This cake got rave reviews, even though I accidently cooked it 10 minutes too long (which I believe dried it out a bit, but did not burn or ruin it). I did follow others' advice and added a teaspoon or 2 of lemon zest to the frosting. I agree that a single layer sheet cake might be more appropriate for this cake, however, my eaters disagreed with me, saying that the 2-layer approach is more decadent. A note to those who are new to cooking with blueberries - I always prefreeze blueberries that I'm going to add to a cake. Adding them frozen keeps them from sinking to the bottom of the pan in the baking.

Why are people mentioning the density of this cake as if that were bad?? The fact that this cake is dense and moist is what makes it so delicious-- something to BITE INTO! I always make this cake for birthdays and it's killer! It COULD use more lemon in it for greater flavour but I could taste the lemon with the amount that it called for. I didn't overcook my cake one iota and the result, thanks mostly to the buttermilk, was that the cake was almost CREAMY, it was so moist and dense. It was almost like a cake pudding except that it WAS cooked all the way through. It was the best cake that I have EVER had. As for the icing, just use 12 ounces of white chocolate, instead of 11 (which also means that you won't have one lousy square leftover from your box) and add a bit more lemon. Even 13 ounces of white chocolate would be better, I bet. But with 12 and even with more lemon, I could taste the chocolate. The frosting goes on smoothly and keeps its shape well. I just don't understand what's so great about fluffy cakes, unless we're talkin' angel food. Fluffy cakes have less flavour, I think. As I've said, I've made this many times, different ovens, even, and if you don't find it moist and terrific, then I think you made an error somewhere along the way. The recipe is perfect.

I doubled this recipe and baked it as one layer in a 14" x 3" pan. I received many compliments and requests to make it again, and I surely will. More than a few people went back for seconds and thirds! It was dense and wonderfully moist, and I think leaving it as one large frosted layer instead of two layers kept it from being excessively rich. A WINNER!

Rating: 2
I made the cake, with a different frosting. Was a huge hit with my family, but as a dessert connaseur I thought it could use some improvement. The cake was rather dense, as noted by other reviewers, but nobody seemed to mind that. If I were to make this cake again, I would add more lemon-zest and maybe some lemon extract to boost up the lemon flavor, because it was not very strong. I would also add more blueberries. I also tried the frosting recipe, on a different cake. I ended up adding more powdered sugar to cut the sour-ness and to firm up the frosting. The end result was tasty, but VERY dense, and the white chocolate taste was not that strong, which is a shame considering the cost of the chocolate. needs improvement as well.

I thought this was a wonderful cake. I followed some of the suggestions and had a great result. The cake is somewhat heavy, but very moist. I used the following additions/techniques and ended up with a tangy and lemony cake that also had a nice white-chocolate flavor: In the batter I added the zest of two lemons and 1 tsp lemon extract. I also beat the sugar and butter for eight minutes and beat very well between the addition of ingredients. This lead to a light cake (some people have commented the cake was too dense). I also used frozed blueberries with good results. For the frosting I used 2 tsp lemon extract, a total of 5 tbsp lemon juice, the zest of two lemons, and 1/2-3/4 cup powdered sugar. This made the frosting much tangier and not as heavy. Also I just melted the chocolate in the microwave with good results. When I assebled the cake, I inverted the layers so the blueberries were on top. I also did a "crumb coat." I put a normal amount of icing between the layers and a very thin layer on the top and sides. I put this in the fridge for 2 hours to harden. I then iced it as normal. I had more than enough icing to ice the cake. I shaved about 2-3 oz of white chocolate with a large grater and pressed this into the top of the cake to help boost up the flavor of the white chocolate. Since I made this for Easter, I decorated the top with three yellow Peeps in the center facing outward (make it a little fun and not-so-serious). This was a big hit and had the flavors of the lemon, blueberry, and white chocolate were easy to taste, but none overwhelmed the other. I really enjoyed this cake and plan to adapt it for raspberries and even blackberries in the future. I may even attempt using lime instead. I though the recipe was very good and easy as much as made-from-scratch cake recipes can be.

Excellent cake! This cake has a wonderful dense texture, which becomes even more apparent when refrigerated. The lemon-blueberry flavor of the cake was also delicious-I don't see why other berries could not be substituted. Despite complaints about the icing, the quantity was perfect. My preference is to have rather thin layers of icing anyhow, otherwise it masks the flavor of the cake. Will definitely make again, and perhaps experiment with other berries and juices.

The cake was delicious when it came out of the oven, very moist. But since the frosting had butter and cream cheese in it, I had to store it in the refrigerator. The cake became very dry and hard after just 1 day. Next time, I would use a different type of frosting that didn't require refrigeration

I made this cake back when it was published in 2000 for my sisters birthday. She loved it and wants this cake every year for here birthday so I oblige. I made it last year for her 40th party and no one at the party believed I made it; they thought it was from a fancy bakery. I guess theat's a complement but not to my baking skills! I've made it twice this year for birthdays and everyone loves it, including me! It would make a great wedding or shower cake!!

My wife says she likes all of my cakes, but this is the best one I have ever made. It easily serves 12 with healthy portions, and is fairly easy to make. The last time I made it, I prepared it well in advance and froze it. While the taste was excellent, it changed the texture and I would not recommend it. I intend to continue making this as long as blueberries are available at a reasonable price, and then I will try other berries as suggested by another reviewer.

I generally don't like making desserts, especially cakes, but this recipe is easy and delicious. I have made it several times, and it is always a hit. I think you could easily adapt this to the berry in season - just add almond or vanilla extract instead of lemon and use strawberries or blueberries.

Delicious and light. I used the lemon curd whipping cream frosting found on this sight and put a lemon curd between layers. It was fresh and lemony, just the way i like it. (I actually almost double the lemon juice and rind in my curds and strain afterwords. Makes for an irresistable zing)

This recipe has been in my file since I cut it out of Bon Appetit 5 years ago. I decided to try it for the first time this weekend for a family dinner party to celebrate my father's 85th birthday. Blueberries are his favorite fruit and he (as well as everyone else) loved it! The cake was moist and rich...but not heavy. I did follow the suggestions to cream the butter and sugar very well (6-8 minutes)as well as beating well after each egg addition. I made the layers in the morning, frosted them later in the afternoon and chilled the cake overnight. My blueberries did sink to the bottom so I assembled the layers with the blueberry side of each facing up. This looked georgous, like the picture, when it was cut. I was a bit apprehensive about using the frosting recipe after reading some of the negative feedback. However, adding one teaspoon of lemon zest in addition the the lemon juice in the recipe seemed to give it just the right balance so that flavor of the cream cheese was not predominant. I beat the mixture more than five minutes with the wire whisk on my stand mixer until it very fluffy and I chilled it for a while before using it. After putting the layers together, I smoothed thin coat of frosting on the sides and top of the cake to anchor the crumbs and seal the blueberries, then chilled it slightly to create a firm foundation for the frosting. This worked well and there was plenty of frosting to do a nice job. The cake was out for about 3 hours at room temperature before serving and it was perfect. I will keep this recipe.

The cake was definitely rich, a small slice was adequate, but I didn't think too heavy. I think sifting the cake flour into the measuring cup BEFORE measuring helps. I thought it was quite refreshing for the summer. I am not a big fan of white chocolate usually (afterall, it has no "chocolate") but it worked here with the lemon.

Since two of my husbands favorite things are blueberries and white choclate, this was a no brainer, but everybody else at the party also raved about it and want the recipe.

This cake is fabulous. I've made this cake a number of times...and have never been disappointed. My friends beg me to make "the cake" for them. I would recommend preping all of the ingredients before you get started (like squeezing the lemons, grating the peel etc). Use good-quality, full fat ingredients(no fat free or low fat will do)and make sure to use unsalted butter, I tried with salted and it did make a difference. Don't fill the pans more than 1/2 full....use the extra to make cupcakes. If you bring it to a party, hope you like being praised!

I made this cake for a 4th of July family party. It was very dense and heavy, as others have mentioned. I used good chocolate and had a difficult time with it. It was too runny, and used sifted confectioners sugar to stiffen. It was too much work to not be the "best of the best"!

I made this cake for a barbeque and everyone loved it. Based on past reviews, I floured to berries so they would not sink. I also seperated the eggs and beat the egg white. Then I folded them into the batter. This helped lighten the cake up a bit. I also added extra tbsp of lemon juice to the frosing and 1 cup of confectionary sugar. Next time I make this i will add some lemon extract to the batter. I did find the frosting to be overpowered by the cream cheese so I may try a lemon buttercream frosting in the future. Nevertheless, it was a hit as is.

I made this cake for Easter, and was very excited to finally try it. But the result didn't live up to my expectations. It was VERY dense, & heavy like a pound cake. I followed the recipt to a T, and it looked perfect, but in the end, I don't feel it was worth the effort. My guests seemed to like it, but it didn't get ooohs and ahhhs. I also agree with the last reviewer, that the frosting wasn't sweet enough. The cream cheese definitely overpowered the white chocolate. Disappointing.

I made this for Easter with high hopes, and was very disappointed. The chocolate in the icing was overpowered by the butter and cream cheese and was sour not sweet. Worse, the cake was dense and heavy. I admit I used frozen blueberries, but the blueberries were the only redeeming part of the otherwise heavy cake. :(

This is the most delicious cake I have ever baked. I love to cook (and eat) and everyone I know begs me to make this cake throughout the year. The only downside is that good blueberries are the key and are sometimes hard to find even in season. I subsituted frozen ones once (for the filling) and although it was okay, using fresh ones are best. It looks great on the table and is a great presentation for an Easter or springtime meal. This is one recipe that I continue to make.

I made this cake in two 8" round pans, and ended up with tall layers. Next time I'll try making three layers instead of two. The frosting really makes this cake. I used Baker's white chocolate and the taste blended beautifully with the cream cheese. Everyone raved about it and I immediately got requests for the recipe. My only problem was that the frosting was a bit runny. Additional confectioner's sugar worked well to firm it up. I will definitely make this recipe again!

After reading all of the glowing reviews I made this for my sister's birthday cake. It was wonderful!

Really very good.

Once again, I have had huge success with this cake. This time I made it for my son's first birthday. I had to use frozen blueberries, and they worked wonderfully; however, I always use fresh during the summer and early fall months, when I can get wonderful blueberries from the U.S. or Canada, as I find the ones from Chile bitter. This cake has become a family favorite. It's sooo moist and absolutely irresistible. Remember, it's paramount to use QUALITY white chocolate, such as Lindt or Bakers, in the frosting. Gheridelli doesn't work, as I learned the hard way. And follow the recipe's directions precisely. This is the best cake I have ever made and tasted. I've been making it for 4 years now. My husband, who is not normally a sweet eater, begs me to make it for him. This cake is just lucious.It will become a family heirloom recipe for us.

I made this cake for a party. It would be perfect for a baby or bridal shower or for Mother's Day or a birthday party. The cake was extremely light, like a lovely sponge cake. Be careful not to overbake, keeping in mind that the finished cake is almost the same pale yellow color as the batter. I can't imagine that anyone found this cake to be "dense" or "heavy." It is very dramatic when you cut it and serve the first slice studded with fat purple berries. I found the amount of frosting to be plenty, and I wish I hadn't been so stinting when I frosted between the layers. I can't count the number of compliments I received. And this time, they weren't just being polite. Next time I might try substituting strawberries, and will glaze the decorative fruit on top, as suggested by another reviewer.

My best friend gave me the recipe for this cake. I let the recipe sit around for over a year. Then, I decided to enter a cake contest.

Very nice, not too heavy cake, though the frosting makes up for it. I didn't change a thing, and it came out very well. I made the cake weeks in advance for a dessert open house, froze the cake, and took it out of the freezer 2 days before the open house to frost it. I had a little trouble with the frosting in that I used white chocolate chips, which didn't melt. But they got soft enough that they 'dissolved' in the frosting with the mixer going fast enough.

Fabulous cake! Looks beautiful, tastes delicious and gets rave reviews! Instead of folding in the berries, I pour the batter into the pan and then "hide" the berries just below the surface of the batter---that way, the berries feature on the top of each layer. I use 10 inch pans, the result is a shorted cake, but looks terrific. The picture in the actual magazine is so inviting! The way it was decorated is easily replicated and so pretty!

A bit of a perfectionist, I usually have some sort of complaint with nearly everything I bake, but I couldn't find a single thing wrong with this one.

I'm curious about the 2 who had a bad experience with this cake. Did you use cake flour, sift before & after measuring, beat the first 3 ingredients long enough, the dry indredients too long, use the wrong size pans, cook too long? Was the baking powder fresh? Any of these can cause a heavy texture. I made it this weekend and it was not heavy at all and the lemon flavor was very much in balance. My 9" cake pans did not have 2" sides as the recipe called for, so I used 3 8" pans instead. (Shortened the cooking time to 27 minutes).I knew the extra layer would mean not enough icing, but since I had to buy 14 oz. of chocolate (4 3 1/2 oz bars) to get the 11 called for, and 16 oz. of cream cheese (2 8 oz. packages)to get 12, it worked out perfectly. Increasing the butter by the same 20% came to 2 sticks which made me wonder if the original recipe had been cut down. Anyway, everyone loved it and I will definately make it again.

This cake tasted decent, but was not at all the light texture described. It also does not keep well for very long. For these reasons, I would probably not make it again. The frosting, on the other hand, was excellent & definitely something I could use with other recipes!!

This was an amazing cake! It had excellent presentation and taste. I received tons of compliments and requests for the recipe. I loved the combo of cake & frosting. It is a delicious & dense cake(kind of like a pound cake). I even substituted plain low fat yogurt instead of buttermilk since I didn't have it in my fridge.

Excellent and impressive cake. I made it for a summer family get-together and it was the hit of the party (amid some stiff competition). In my opinion it is a nearly perfect summer dessert -- and makes a beautiful presentation to boot. Definitely a keeper. I can't wait until blueberry season rolls around again so I can make this again!

Rating: 2
Although the blueberry cake was good, I thought that the frosting was an odd combination that didn't compliment the cake at all. It was too thick and rich which fought with the light summery flavors of the cake. I may make the cake again but serve it as a coffee cake with just some powered sugar sprinkled on top.

This recipe is great!!! I made this cake for my boyfriend's birthday, and everyone raved over it. I am not a big cake lover, but this one I will make again and again. I did modify the recipe, I used black berries instead of blueberries which gave it a striking contrast of purple and white. Try it!

I love this cake! Everyone that I have served it to has loved it! It is dense, moist, an impressive cake with simple flavours. I have made it three times and I have decided that I prefer it with a touch more lemon in the cake and white chocolate in the icing. The cream cheese does overpower the white chocolate a bit. Still, it is the best cake I have had (not that I sample a lot of cakes, I'm not usually a fan of them, in general.)! Using buttermilk is the key. :)

This cake was absolutely gorgeous and delicious! A perfect summer-time cake. The blueberries and lemon were perfectly matched with the frosting. The cake was definitely a little more work than what I'm used to, but it was so worth it. I made it for an office birthday party; co-workers were coming out of the woodwork!

I'm a cooking teacher at a local cooking school/cookware store and I made this for a bridal shower for our manager, so this recipe came under the scrutiny of many "foodies" and they all loved it! I thought the frosting was terrific, well-balanced between white chocolate & cream cheese and it was very easy to work with; in fact, I tinted some different colors to decorate with and it piped beautifully, too, so it behaved much like a good buttercream. I heated the chocolate in a bowl in the microwave at 50% power in 30-second intervals and it came out perfectly and hardly needed time to cool down. The cakes were high and moist with the blueberries well-distributed (I tossed them in a little of the flour to keep them from sinking). As is typical with butter cakes, I creamed the butter/sugar mixture for several minutes until it was very fluffy. I made the cake on Saturday morning, let it sit out until late Sunday morning, when I frosted it. I served it last night to rave reviews and am now enjoying one last piece and it is still tender, moist and delicious! What more could you want from a cake?!

Lost the issue that this originally appeared in and had to do a search to find it... definitely worth the effort! This has been a favorite of friends and coworkers and a frequent request. This cake is not dense if prepared carefully - be sure to adequately beat the butter, it should be very fluffy before proceeding.

Everyone loved this cake. Someone said it was THE BEST cake they had ever had. I substituted strawberries for blueberries and it made kind of a strawberry shortcake exerience. I agree, though, it is a very dense cake. I will try what what reviewer suggested and beat butter etc. more and see if it makes a difference next time. Other people at the party certainly didn't seem to mind that it was so dense, but I was surprised. I will definitely make it again!

Have made more than a dozen times. Friends call and ask me to make for them. Coating frozen blueberries in cake flour makes them easy to use in this recipe with no extra baking time. Why would someone take the time to make this cake and put a store bought frosting on it?? This is a favorite.

My guests all said this was beautiful and delicious. I did think that it was good. Moist, but heavy, like other reviewers said. Very filling. I used store-bought lemon whipped frosting. I didn't think the cake was very lemony. I have to admit, I giggled when another reviewer said she forgot to remove her waxed paper and then karma hit me and I did too. Thankfully, it was before my guests arrived that I realized this and was able to scrap off the frosting and then reapply. Do not forget! It is practically transparent. I used low-fat buttermilk and the cake was moist.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday and it received raves. It could become a tradition. I followed the recipe exactly as listed despite some of the other reviews and it came out perfectly.

Made this for the third time to take to a luncheon for 16 women. It got major raves and requests for recipe.

The cake was very good. Got lots of compliments on it. The cream cheese frosting was a problem. When I put the melted white chocolate into the butter mixture, it seized up creating chocolate pellets in the frosting. Plus it did not taste good anyway. Threw that out and made vanilla buttercream which was great. Does anyone know how to keep the blueberries from sinking to the bottom of the batter?

Loved this cake! After reading other comments, I increased the lemon juice to 1/2 cup, and decreased the buttermilk to just 1 cup. It turned out wonderfully! Light, lemony and very moist.

definitely enjoyed and savored by all at the bday party. even my exboyfriend who almost refused the piece i offered him, but i think took it out of graciousness--not generally a cake fan, ended up gobbling it down in just minutes. i thought the white chocolate added complexity to the cream cheese frosting. i added a touch of vanilla and powdered sugar for a bit more sweetness.

Wonderful summer dessert! What a great way to use those summer blueberries! The cake texture was perfect. The frosting was light and not heavy like other cream cheese frostings can be.

I have wanted to try this cake, but some of the comments re: the frosting have me concerned. Has anyone tried making it with Light Cream Cheese (1/3 less fat? Would others agree with the comment that the frosting recipe makes more than is needed? Would a touch of vanilla help disguise the cheese flavor?

This cake is so good. I have been looking for an excuse to make it again and I found one for this weekend. I was surprised at all the negative comments on the frosting. I think the only way it would not work is if you did not follow the directions exactly. Make a day ahead of time and keep in the fridge until you use it. That should take care of any issues you have with a frosting that is not setting up well.

I've made this beautiful cake several times. It gets raves by absolutely everyone! The only problems I had were 1) when I used 8" cake pans instead of the 9" - you need the 9", and 2) when I made the cake in Mississippi in July and the humidity made the frosting runny. However, I did not alter the recipe and the consistency was good enough to get the frosting on and smooth and then overnight in the fridge firmed everything up nicely. This looks impressive but it's really quite easy. Must be made at least one day ahead. Keeps in the fridge for a week!

This recipe has been reviewed a lot, but it has become a favourite at our house, so I had to add my comments!I've made this recipe with both fresh and frozen blueberries and found that I have to always bake it about ten minutes longer than the recipe states. The cake is always moist and the frosting is very rich.(Does not need more sugar!) When I was short of ingredients, I cut the frosting recipe by 1/3 and found that I still had lots. I've made it that way ever since. The only time it was too runny was when I didn't have time to let the melted chocolate cool. This cake has been a huge hit at pot luck barbecues and makes a great dessert!

Rating: 3
Delicious cake - looks pretty, too- but the frosting was way too runny. I ended up adding powdered sugar only to find out later that another reviewer did the same thing. I still didn't get the right consistency - the frosting was squishing out the sides of cake. Any suggestions for another frosting to use with this cake?

Rating: 3
The cake itself is delicious, almost like a pound cake but not as dense. I'd like to make the batter again try some variations for muffins, etc. All in all, everyone raved over it. However, I had some icing issues. I ended up covering up my mistakes with lots of lemons and blueberries. Tasted wonderful, but not too pretty!

Rating: 4
What an unusual cake! I was a little concerned with the mixed reviews. The cake rose beautifully and, although the color was light, was done after 35 minutes of baking (I think it may have been ready a few minutes earlier). It was very dense but not heavy or dry, almost like a pound cake. The lemon ratio was perfect for the blueberries. And it was gorgeous upon cutting. I wasn't sure the first night whether the icing complemented the cake, but it seemed to improve after a day or two. A nice change of pace from the usual layer cake.

I was disappointed in this cake. After reading all the reviews, I was hungry. The cake was beautiful and very moist. The blueberries were also very pretty as they lined up in the middle of the cake and they to were very tasty. I will use this cake recipe again. The icing, however, was a different story. I'm not a big fan of cream cheese icing and when I do eat it I like for it to be sweeter than this. I thought that the white chocolate would add the sweetness, but like another review, all I tasted was the cream cheese. I think you must be a fan of cream chesse icing without sweetness. I tossed about 3/4 of this beautiful cake.

I brought this cake to a cookout, and it got tremendous reviews and there was very little left over. I'll definitely make this again, but I'll use less cream cheese for the frosting and more lemon. The frosting as is tastes overwhelmingly like cream cheese only, and why chop up and melt all that beautiful white chocolate if it can't be detected?

This cake turned out great! I was a little worried because I don't have a good record with double layer cakes, but it came out of the pans fine and I had plenty of frosting. I had to bake it in cake pans with only 1 inch sides so that made me worried too, but they seemed to work. I will buy new pans for the next time I make it. The flavor was great and it was very pretty. Even one non-dessert person had a second piece!

I made this cake for guests and it was very well received. The texture is different -- it's not a fluffy, spongy cake like you might get with a mix -- but I didn't find it too dense or heavy. Definitely don't take shortcuts on the amount of time to beat the batter at various stages. I did find that the frosting was very rich but not sweet, so I decreased the cream cheese to 8 oz. and added a cup of powdered sugar and twice the lemon juice called for. Overall, a delicious cake, but probably won't become a standard for me.

I have made this cake twice, the first time it was dry and flavorless, and the second time it was lighter, more lemon flavor, and a huge hit! Remember to beat the sugar and butter for 5 min in the cake part, and beat the butter and cream cheese for 5-8 min in the frosting part. That made a big differance, along with using a real lemon zester and not grating the lemon peel. I also used 3/4 cup sifted powdered sugar in the icing.

Oh so dry and dense, like a very stale grocery store pound cake. I made this for my best friend's birthday and I was mortified that she had so much difficulty cutting the cake.

I was hoping it would be a light and lemony, but it turned out to be a very hearty cake. Will not make this again!

I don't understand how people are saying this cake was too heavy. I made this twice, the first time I brought it into work. Its not heavy at all, the cake looks and tastes perfect, I garnished it with extra lemons and blueberrys which I stuck around the sides. I also accidentally used 16 oz. of cream cheese for the frosting instead of 12, and it was also slightly chilled instead of room temperature, which makes the frosting a little more sturdy and it holds up better. Everyone at my office raved about the frosting, this cake is definitely a winner!!!

I made this cake as a thank-you for a neighbor who had done some work in my home, and was very pleased with the results - I don't think it was too fussy even though I often shun things that take cake flour on priciple alone.

I bake often and generally don't have any problems. This cake presents well, but the proof is in the tasting, and unfortunately, it was a dud - The cake is very heavy and a little dry. I made it twice - the first time with the white chocolate icing - didn't work well with the fruity cake and I ended up tossing most of it out. The second time, I used a light lemon curd frosting and it blended together better, but still, nothing great. Served it at a dinner party to so-so reviews.

I had friends over and they all loved the cake, I did run into a problem finding cake flour - most stores in my area no longer carry it. I ended up using all purpose flour and the cake was just fine. I used fresh (frozen) blueberrys - I would like to add that if you use frozen berrys allow then to defrost first or increase your cooking time. It took me ~20 additional minutes using 8" pans.

For a show stopping dessert, make the cake in a jelly roll pan(will have left over batter for a smaller pan)After it is baked, cut out circles of cake to fit into bottom of individual serving spring form pans. Top with a white chocolate mousse.Chill. Before serving, unmold and decorate top with fresh blueberries sweetened in own juicies or a thickened blueberry topping plus dollop of whipped cream. HEAVENLY!

As other cooks have noted, this is a denser cake, but the consistency works well with the blueberries. I have made this cake twice--the first time with the white chocolate frosting, which my boyfriend found too sweet. A few days ago I made the cake again with a cream cheese-lemon curd frosting (from Bon Appetit, on this site). We both found this preferable and enhanced the lemony flavor. I find that this cake looks impressive and, despite its density, isn't too heavy as a summer dessert.

This cake is just heavenly. It's very heavy, so don't be fooled into thinking otherwise. But it's gorgeous and delicious and just luscious. I made the cake layers one day, let them cool, then wrapped them in plastic wrap and put them in zip-lock bags (and stored them at room temp). The next day I made the frosting and assembled the cake. It was the piece de resistance of the summer party it was made for. I could build a reputation on this cake, folks!

This cake looked just beautiful, but tasted so so. I would make it again, using plain milk and a different icing.

i made this cake the first time from scratch - the second time i was in a rush so i used a lemon cake mix and and made a sheet cake - it was still very good - although the cream cheese frosting was heavy...

This cake is so beautiful! It is a bit heavier than I expected but still very delicious. I served it at a garden luncheon and it was a big hit. I will make this again before the end of summer but I might lighten the frosting a little.

As a pastry chef I'm picky. To date 17 people wnt the recipe. Follow the directions and your blueberries will look like the picture, draping the batter. If you are not used to using white chocolate, just melt it slowly. Used an entire lemon rind which curves slightly when zested with the small end of the tool. Press into the icing making a large figure 8. Makes for a very dramatic look. The flavor is incredible. The crumb is so dense and lovely. The frosting could not have been a better match. This one is a keeper!

I loved this cake! It looks so beautiful on the table after a summer dinner. Everybody enjoyed it. It was quite dense but delicious. I think I will try a lemon buttercream frosting next time for a change to something lighter.

I made this cake for a pot-luck and it was a definite hit. The cake, as others noted, was more dense than I expected but very tasty. The frosting is amazing! I intend to try it with some different flavour variations on chocolate cake.

What a success! I served this cake at a garden party to rave reviews! The lemon and blueberries complemented each other so well! Lovely cake with a decadent frosting!

every one raved about the cake. The frosting takes time and focus to come out just right. However, be warned - it is very, very rich. I think I would like to try this with a lighter frosting

This cake was excellent... everyone loved the frosting. Dense texture but will make it again most definately.

This cake got rave reviews. I made it twice. It is great even as a sheet cake. THe icing is well worth the effort. The icing was the most difficult part of this cake to me. But I'd gladly do it again.

cake was rather dense but had a distictive lemon flavor which was excellent. i used a lemon buttercream icing and i would certainly make this again.

The cake is denser than you'd expect, but the flavor isn't bad.

Cake was rather dense and lacked lemon flavor. Was not too hard to make, and looked OK.

I found the recipe a little cumbersome the first time I made it but it was much easier the second time. It looked beautiful and tasted great. I looked like a baking star when I presented it.

I thought the cake was wonderful and moist. The frosting was a bit heavy. I would definitely go with a whipped cream frosting to lighten up the cake. Also for those of you who like the citrus taste from the lemon. I use a product from King Arthur flour's catalog called Fior d'sicilia. it adds a wonderful essesence to cake and pasties that you can't get from just the jest of the lemon.

One of the most delicious cakes I have ever served. A true hit at the party of 27. Looks like a party pleaser visually.

I made this cake twice. It was a little too dense the first time. The second time I creamed the butter and sugar longer, for about 8 minutes, and it came out much higher and with a more pleasing texture. I thought the frosting was absolutely delicious and would use it again on other cakes. My blueberries all went to the bottom of the pans. To make the cake look like the picture, you have to ignore the assembly directions in the recipe and place both layers bottom side up. This places the layer of blueberries just under the frosting on both layers. I would try another reviewer's suggestion of some lemon extract, or at least some additional rind next time I make it, since I think it would be better if the lemon flavor was more pronounced. But everyone loved the cake even as it was, both times that I served it.

I enjoy desserts, but this cake was nothing special. It lacked flavor!

I thought this was a so-so cake. The flavour was good (I added 2t. more grated lemon peel since I like things very lemony - it could have used even more) but it was very dense, and having to refrigerate it didn't improve the texture. I made this and a cobbler for the 4th of July - the cobbler was DEVOURED and acclaimed but this dessert languished. Also agree with others' comments on frosting - if I did make it again, I'd go with a lemon buttercream frosting.

I made this recipe twice because I unhappy with it the first time. My guests commented that it "lacked flavor." The second time I added a bit of lemon extract to the batter, replaced the buttermilk with regular milk plus two tablespoons of lemon juice and added about 1/4 cup confectioners sugar and 3 tablespoons of lemon juice to the frosting: It was heavenly. I was barraged with requests for the recipe.

I made this cake for my mother's 76th birthday party and was showered with compliments. My brother-in-law, who lives for my desserts at family gatherings, loved it and had no complaints about the frosting. Next time, I'm going to try this with raspberries or strawberries instead of blueberries. Note: It bothered me that the finished product didn't look like the picture. Instead of mixing the berries into the batter, the test kitchen appears to have placed the berries in the pans first and then poured the batter over top.

I forgot to mention one thing in my prior review, in response to George's question about the blueberries. I dusted the blueberries with a little bit of flour before folding them into the batter. This step prevents the blueberries from sinking to the bottom of the pan.

I agree with the other reviewers about the frosting. I think the white chocolate does not go well with the cake. I would like to try the lemon buttercream icing. I have made this cake with the cream cheese frosting - no white chocolate, tastes much better.

The cake looked beautiful, but the taste just didn't match the presentation. It was good, but not great. I'd probably go with another dessert next party.

What is wrong with me? I liked the cake and the frosting! I prepared both on Saturday afternoon, frosted the cake later that evening, then refrigerated it until partytime, Sunday evening. Refrigerating the frosting made is quite hard. As it (the cake)sat out (and began disappearing) the frosting softened nicely. I, too agree, it made a beautiful presentation. Several people, whom I had never met before, complemented me on how much they liked it. These strangers complemented me as I was leaving. The only way they knew I made the cake because I was carrying it's empty serving platter.

I have made this recipe at least 3 times. It is absolutely delicious and make a beautiful presentation. I kept mine refrigerated and had no problems with the frosting. Everyone loves it! I am not usually a big fan of cakes but this one is definitely special.

I have to differ with the other reviewers in that I loved the frosting. That said I do agree that it soft and not quite suited for the season. However if the cake is not to be left at room temperature but refrigerated, it is superb. I have a dispute with the photo of the completed cake. Why are the blue berries all in one layer in the photo and not dispersed through the cake as is the case when the directions are followed? I am making it for the second time today.

I agree with the other reviews, the frosting did not match the cake. I found the frosting not thick enough, especially for the summer, the warm weather made it too runny. I would make the cake again, but with a lemon buttercream frosting.

The cake part of this recipe is quite good - the icing is a complete mismatch! Somehow, white chocolate and lemon just don't cut it. A friend made the cake with a lemon butter creme icing and guests loved it. If I were inclined to try this again, this is the only way I would do it. I think it would be excellent as a lemon loaf cake with a lemon glaze.

Made this for a friend's baby shower. A little denser than expected, but very tasty. I found the frosting a little bit on the salty side, taking away from the white chocolate taste. I used frozen blueberries and I didn't have 9"x2" round pans, so I used 3 9"x1.5" pans. These two things didn't seem to adversely affect the cake.

Made this cake with fresh Oregon blueberries and it was delicious. A little denser than expected and the frosting was very rich. Think next time I will try frosting it with sweetened whip cream to lighten it up. We loved it.
