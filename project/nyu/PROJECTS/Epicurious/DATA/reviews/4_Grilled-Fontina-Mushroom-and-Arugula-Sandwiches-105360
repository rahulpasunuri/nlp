Very delicious and easy. I pretty much followed the recipe, although as one reviewer mentioned, I did not bother to wipe out the pan after cooking the mushrooms and prior to putting the sandwiches in. Idid use spicy brown mustard as we like aa lot of zing. I wondered whether thinly sliced apple or pear would add something interesting to the sandwich, and may try this next time, although my hubby was very happy as is.

Made these with the Roasted Tomato Soup and they were excellent. Cooked the mushroom for about 15 minutes - like them a bit firmer. Fresh rosemary a plus. Great combination of flavors. Will make again.

Excellent! I used scali bread for a nice crispy texture.

Make sure you use Val'Dosta fontina from France. Very nutty flavor and makes a big difference! So happy you've been enjoying the recipe.

Wow, this was great, and easy to boot! I ate mushroom sandwiches all weekend. I could not find fresh rosemary, so I was forced to use dried, and it did OK....although I can tell that fresh rosemary would have tasted much brighter.

I have loved this recipe for years...great with homemade cream of tomato soup for a "comfort meal" "kicked up a notch" ..also made without crusts and cut into quaters for a hearty hors d'oeuvre or ladies' tea!

Excellent! I didn't wipe out the skillet, just sprinkled more fresh chopped rosemary in it and let it put a nice finish on the *outside* of the sandwich. Served it with a side of cream of potato cheese soup. Will make this again and again!

I had to substitute spinach for arugula because the market was out. I really enjoyed it. Next time I'll make it as written.
