I haven't tasted the actual SALAD, but I've tasted the dressing and I have to say: BLECH! It was very salty and mucky. The texture was gross (no crunch) and the taste was awful!

The dressing is superb. My husband could have licked his plate if no one had been looking! I skipped the bell pepper and used fresh tomatoes instead of dried ones, so I don't know what the original recipe tastes like, but mine was one of the best I ever made.

This salad is fabulous!!!

Great combination of flavors, and wonderfully fragrant dressing. I oven-roasted the corn kernels and bell pepper strips, halved the amount of sundried tomato, and substituted corn tortilla for croutons. Not sure how others did it, but I cut the tortillas into thin strips and then sauteed them in a dry pan over medium-high heat until crisp and curling. This would make a great entree salad with sliced grilled chicken or steak.

Rating: 4
This was great. Maybe roasting the peppers would add some more flavor, and I'll definitely try grilling the romaine next time, but still great.

Rating: 4
Very easy to make dressing. Made with some modifications- used anchovy paste in dressing and for the salad itself cut the romaine head in half lengthwise then grilled it for less than 2 mins. to give it a few grill marks and a slight smokey flavor, grilled one ear of corn and used the kernels, made oven roasted plum tomatoes and used those and topped it off with the dressing and finally some chopped hard boiled egg, skipping the croutons. Loved the smokey, crunchy, tangy and slightly spicy flavors. Very nice combination-reminded me of something I had in New Orleans.

Rating: 4
Delicious!. I didn't add the anchovy fillets, the dressing was good without it. I added sliced, leftover marinated steak, along with an avocado. Skipped the croutons and opted instead for crumbled tortilla chips as suggested by another reviewer.

Very good. I didn't use the anchovy fillets, the dressing was very good without it. I sliced leftover marinated steak, tossed that in, along with an avocado. Like another reviewer, I used crumbled tortilla chips instead of croutons. Fresh romaine from my garden, I will definitely make it again.

I love this recipe! I am so glad that Bon Appetit was able to obtain it when I requested it 9 years ago. It's nice that I can find it online now too instead of bringing out my dog-eared copy of the magazine. I missed it so much when I moved away from the restaurant that served it, it's a real treat to be able to make it for myself! It is a wonderful variation on the traditional caesar.

This salad was a total hit. I did not give the recipe 4 forks because I changed a few things---I did not use the anchovies and substituted light sour cream for the yogurt and fresh tomatoes for the sun dried. I thought this salad was so fresh tasting...a perfect balance for the grilled tri tip we served for dinner.

Rating: 4
This is delish! I add extra sour cream and yogurt to the dressing to make it more creamy.

this is delish... i use an orange bell pepper for more color, and use regular diced tomatoes instead of sundried. the red tomatoes, orange peppers, and yellow corn makes for a very pretty salad.

Rating: 4
This is a family and friend favorite. After years of making it I am always asked to bring it to a party. I make the dressing as is, however I change the salad ingredients. I skip the croutons, bell pepper, corn and the sun-dried tomatoes, and use fried corn tortilla strips and roasted-salted pepitas. Occasionally, I substitute Cotija cheese for the Romano (which is delicious too). For those that found it bland, you either used bad garlic and jalapenos or your tasted buds are dead from trying to cook like Emiril! This dressing has a wonderful, extraordinary flavor. I would give it five forks if they allowed it!!!

Sounded like a great combination of ingredients, but found dressing far too bland. A disappointment.

Really liked this. One of those pat-yourself-on-the-back dishes. Only change: Toasted canned white corn on the stove top. The canned corn took quite a while to toast but it was a nice savory addition. Next time I'll either toast raw corn or trying toasting the canned corn in the oven. This is a keeper.

Rating: 4
This is an excellent salad - the corn gives a nice, sweet crunch to the salad. I often add avocado as well. The dressing is a real workhorse, and I make extra to have on hand for a quick, tasty salad.

Didn't tell my husband about the anchovies (which he hates in Caeser Salad) But he loved this salad as did all my picky-eater children. This is a winner. I followed the recipe exactly and have been asked for the recipe numerous times.

This is not your typical "throw together" Caesar, but you'll love it. Definitely make your own dressing ... per the recipe. It is delish. I add a bit more garlic to the dressing. I tried adding more cilantro and the taste was off ... stick with the recommended amount.

I followed the recipe except used canned white corn and didn't have quite enough sundried tomatoes; also added some chicken. I thought it was good, and my husband proclaimed it the "best salad I've ever had" as he finished off almost the whole thing himself. He normally snubs salads but asked me to make this one again.

I have to say, I was a bit disappointed with this salad. The dressing just didn't do it for me--I had to doctor it quite a bit to get it to a tasty consistency. I won't make it again.

i have made this salad many many times and have never had a complaint only compliments! i am off to the store to collect the delicious ingredients. have never made it with the anchovies, but i am going to be daring and give it a whim. i always always double on everything, because after making the dressing, you WANT more! it can be used for a dip as well. just keep chilled in the fridge and blend each use.

i really liked this dressing so versatile too. I added cayenne pepper both to the dressing and on top of the salad fro presentation and it made all the difference. my boyfriend loved it.

Rating: 4
I have mad this recipe many times for dozens of people and they love it! I make the dressing as the recipe states. However, I change the salad part. I eliminate the use of croutons, corn, sun-dried tomatoes and bell pepper. Instead I use roasted-salted pepitas and fried, thinly sliced, corn tortilla strips. These substitutions give the salad more of a Southwestern/Mexican flair. I have also used grilled chicken breast slices and turned it into a light main course.

Rating: 3
A very hearty salad. I added a few extra anchovies to the dressing(we love anchovies). And I used cherry tomatoes instead of sundried tomates, since we find them a little too sweet. But that what is great about this recipe you can adapt it and make it way you prefer, since it gives you such a great start!

Everyone loves this recipe when I make it! I usually make it for "bring something" parties. It is the first thing I think of, when deciding. I take flour tortillas, cut them into strips, and fry them in some oil, and add some Tony's (cajun spice) on top. IT IS DELICIOUS!!

Rating: 3
This was really good, i loved the variation on the classic caesar..Instead of store bought croutons, I toasted french bread cubes sprinkled with evoo, garlic and chili powder(enough so they had a nice reddish color)My one complaint was that I though the yogurt came through a little too much in the dressing, If you are not a hugh yogurt fan, I would substitute mayo or maybe silken tofu. Very tasty!

I cut the oil down to 1/4 cup and still ended up adding 1/4 cup of cottage cheese to thicken it slightly. The salad was fantastic - but warning to those that have to work with people the next day, it's very garlicky. I think next time I'll either saute the garlic beforehand, or use roasted garlic to spare my co-workers the smell. The spiciness of the jalapeno was perfect, and I served it on a large platter as other reviewers had suggested. Beautiful salad with fantastic flavors - this recipe is a keeper!

For those people who "think" they don't like anchovies, just try them once in this recipe. You won't taste anchovy, but it will give the dressing a wonderful richness you can't get any other way. Don't tell people it has anchovies and no one will ever know. They'll just love it.

Rating: 3
I loved this salad. Very fresh tasting with a "kick". I too did not use anchovies, for shame!! I have never bought the things. But, I cannot imagine that this salad needed anything different. The dressing is great, but we love cilantro! Will remember this one for a barbeque!

I have made this more than once, but with the following small changes. Instead of using raw shallots and garlic, I saute them first and let them cool before making the dressing. Otherwise the dressing tastes a little raw/bitter -- flavor is still with you the next morning. The combination of flavors is delicious.

Rating: 0
If you took out the anchovies, you didn't make a Caesar salad, which uses either anchovies, or worcestershire sauce (which contains anchovies), or both. I'm sure whatever you made was yummy but it wasn't a Caesar: Caesar salad [SEE-zer] A salad consisting of greens (classically, ROMAINE LETTUCE) tossed with a garlic VINAIGRETTE dressing (made with WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE and lemon juice), grated Parmesan cheese, croutons, a CODDLED egg and sometimes anchovies. It is said to have been created in 1924 by Italian chef Caesar Cardini, who owned a restaurant in Tijuana, Mexico.

So what if someone left out the anchovies? Leave them alone. If you added corn and red bell pepper you didn't make a true Caesar salad, either, so I don't see what the big deal is if someone left out the anchovies.

I love this salad and it's really a hit with guests who are tired of the ordinary caesar dressing. I just make the dressing and toss it with romaine lettuce - no corn or sundried tomatoes - and pass shredded Parmesan at the table. Very simple and every one LOVES it. As one other reader mentioned, it goes beautifully with anything barbecued.

Excellent !! I followed previous suggestions and decreased the olive oil to 1/2 cup and increased the yogurt a bit. Also, since most jalapeno peppers these days are milder than what they used to be, I used 2 peppers. Since I was serving the salad with corn cakes, I substituted some black beans for the corn. I served this with Confetti Corn Cakes (Bon Appetit 10/84), Grilled Chicken with Oregano, Cinammon and Paprika (Bon Appetit 6/00), and Peach Cobbler with Blueberries and Cherries (Bon Appetit 7/89).

I made this the other night for friends, and it was a huge hit. In order to keep the non-lettuce ingredients from falling to the bottom of the bowl, toss the lettuce with the dressing first until all leaves are coated, then add all of the other ingredients (corn, tomatoes, etc) and toss gently. They will stick to the lettuce leaves and not fall to the bottom... One of the best salads I've ever had!

Rating: 2
I expected better with all the good reviews. I followed the recipe to a T; my reaction was that the dressing was very mild, not very flavorful and very THIN. However, what taste it had was good/ interesting. Last comment: did add grilled checken to it for a meal. Used McCormicks Jerk Seasoning recipe (of all things--a friend made it and I was startled how good it was) on the side of the McCormick's spicejar--really went wonderfully with the dressing.

This salad had delicious flavour with the red bell peppers and sun-dried tomatoes. The dressing was also enjoyable. I served it at a dinner party, so I made a small batch of it and mixed it in with some "regular" Caesar dressing that I made. The dressing was not so overpowering this way, yet still had a bit of a "kick"! Overall, a great salad idea that I will serve again...

Recommend using a large flat bottom salad bowl for the corn, peppers and tomatoes kept working their way to the bottom; they are so-o-o good, you don't want to miss it!! The amount of oil properly blended is appropriate ratio, just serve the salad with the dressing to be placed on by each guest individually....Surprise, you will have leftover dressing for yourself for tomorrow!!!

Bon Appetit is our favorite source of recipes for catering. Thanks.
