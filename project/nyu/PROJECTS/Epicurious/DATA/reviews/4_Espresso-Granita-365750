Made this for dessert today. Everyone really liked it! It was the perfect dessert for a hot day and would be great as a palate cleanser between courses too.

My new favorite thing about summer! Light, refreshing, super easy to make & relatively healthy (for dessert!). Not to mention SO pretty! I added finely chopped dark chocolate & served it in a margarita glass with whipped cream, a sprig of mint & shaved chocolate, and it was BEAUTIFUL! I made it half-caff with strong coffee, and it was great. The measurements don't need to be very specific-- an easy & forgiving recipe!
