Find another dressing recipe - terribly bland.

Per another reviewer I used mixed greens but I blended them with watercress. The salad was only adequate; the dressing is the deciding factor and it failed to excite.

Classic combo, succeeds again. Drowned the salad a bit with dressing, but it's still okay, because all the flavors are so delicious. Especially with extra avocado... Substituted mixed greens for watercress and served with Southwestern grilled salmon on a hot sunny Fathers' Day.

This is a fresh tasting salad especially after a heavy or rich meal. I used baby spinach and it was a hit... particularly with the avocado lovers.

Excellent salad. Made with baby lettuce instead of watercress. Found the dressing a bit bland so I doubled the mustard and added about a teaspoon and a half of sugar. Perfect.

I didn't have cheese, but the rest of the ingredients, and it was great. I've never paired avocado and grapefruit and it was delicious! Will certainly make this again (with or without cheese)

Yummy! I loved this recipe & my mother gave it an A+!
