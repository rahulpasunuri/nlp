this might be the best meal i have ever cooked - time intensive at 2 hours but worth it!

My family really liked this dish. Instead of using water, I used part water (2/3) and part chicken broth (1/3). I was generous with the honey and cinnamon.

I've made this several times with some modifications. I usually use leftover roast lamb leg since the meat has to be cooked anyway. There's not so much fat that way and it eliminates trimming and cutting. With all the other flavours, I don't think it makes a lot of difference. I omit the saffron from the tagine because it tends to get lost there and add it to the couscous. We think this is delicious.

Wonderful fall or winter dish. Great served over couscous. Mine was not the distinct yellow color of saffron so next time I would add a bigger pinch. The apricots and prunes accent the lamb really well. I would definitely make again.

I made this recipe for the first time in my new tagine. It was delicious. I didn't use prunes since i didn't have any and i used zucchini instead of squash. Do NOT change a thing, it was very very good. I can't wait to make it for my next dinner party. I served it with Israeli couscous decorated with toasted pine nuts and chopped cilantro and with chopped Israeli salad.

why is A COOK advertising for another website in almost every recipe I look at?

the lamb shoulder meat is not tender enough. The spices are too limited in quantity so it lacks interest. Prunes were a dsitracting flavor. There are many much better lamb stews around.

I feel bad for never rating this before, I have been making it for years and it is truly a family fave. My normally reticent husband almost licks the plate!! It does take a lot of time so I usually at least double and freeze half, but it is worth the effort. I've made it twice for passover, reminiscent of a tsimmes but way better!

Great recipe. Easy to make. I substituted and used more canned apricots and no prunes. Worked well, but would stick with dried apricots as the canned are less tart and got a bit lost with the other flavors.

This is a great recipe -- but even better if you skip the dried apricots and prunes and when in season find quince and use instead. I peel the quince and poach in a cup of the broth from the lamb stew with suage and a cup of water which is reduced down to half it volume - the peeled cored and halved quince are then added and cookwed untiul still firm but covered in a gorgeous sweetened reduction of the sauce. The quince are served around the edge of a large platter with the lamb and vegetables piled up in the center over a mound of couscous. I also skip the honey in the stew if I use quince since their sweetness is more than enough.

This was more like a 2-1/2 stars. It was too greasy for my taste. If I make it again I will refrigerate the lamb after the simmering and skim off all that fat. The taste was quite good, I added some cumin and a touch of cardamom. You don't need the honey at all with all that dried fruit. I also added about 6 oz of cooked chickpeas which made it quite lovely. My kids hate lamb, though, and after this dish, they still do.

This was so tasty. I didn't add carrots, prunes or apricots, but doubled the sweet potato and squash. I half roasted the sweet potato before I peeled and cubed it. I aldo added 6 cloves of smashed garlic along with the onion. I'm looking forward to the leftovers!

I made a few adjustments. I increased the amounts of cinnamon and ginger and added cumin. I added some garlic to the onion (just because I can't imagine a lamb dish without garlic). I didn't have squash so I used rutabaga instead. I garnished it with fresh mint (cilantro might have been even better)and served it with both couscous and the suggested salad. I will definitely be making this again.

Very tasty and easy to do. I would change slightly by adding more meat and saffron and reducing the amount of dried fruit. Also, I simmered the meat for about 2 hrs so it was really tender.

Really excellent!!! Do not change anything!

This dish was so yummy! It was also easy to make for the most part. The most time consuming part was cutting the meat off the shoulder lamb chops, but it was worth the effort. I cooked the lamb, bones and onions the night before, then cooled it and refrigerated it. I then measured out the remaining ingredients so when I finished preparing the dish it was a snap. I made very few changes to the recipe...used a teaspoon of cinnamon, cumin and a half a teaspoon of ginger. I used chicken broth rather than water, and toward the end added a little water in addition. Used one tablespoon honey. Served it with Israeli couscous and cucumber, tomato and sweet onion salad. I am licking my lips in remembering the tastes!

Fab! Great mix of flavors which were inique and exciting. I also made Okra and Tomato Tagine from Paula Wolfert's "Couscous and other good food from Morroco". This goes into my recipe book.

I've made many tagines but we enjoyed this one because of the subtlety of the flavours for a change. Normally, one expects sweetness and cinnamon. I used 1/4 c. chopped dates instead of prunes. Sweet enough without the honey. But most important, do not omit the browning of the bones! Wonderful!

This recipe is great and a big hit, but I made a few modifications: doubled the saffron and toasted it before adding; used about 1 cup of both dried fruits, sliced in half; used at least 1tsp of cinammon and ginger and green beans instead of squash cause who likes slimey squash? But most importantly, I think, I used 2 1/2 c. chicken stock instead of the water. It added flavor and gives you more gravy in the finished stew. It looks too soupy at first, but once you add the fruit, it thickens up nicely.

delicious!! to answer someone's question below: chopped israeli salad usually just has a bit of lemon juice and salt (and olive oil, if you want) added. use english style cucumbers (the kind that come shrink-wrapped that you don't peel)...and yeah, i would serve this with couscous as well as salad--the couscous will soak up some of the yummy juices from the stew. i can find 'israeli' style couscous in some grocery stores in san francisco, but it might not be available everywhere--then you can certainly use the more readily available finer couscous.

I made the recipie according to the instructions. We found the tast to be much too bland. Apparently the other reviewers like bland food.This had no hint of Moroccan flavor. Not enough cinnamon and ginger. I ended up adding 1T ground corriander, trippling the cinnamon, and ginger, adding a big pinch of cayenne pepper and a generous teaspoon of ground cumin. That helped but not enough to make this again. I have better versions

Fabulous dish..If you serve it with the Israeli salad of cucumber,tomato, and sweet onion...does it need a salad dressing? Can you do both the couscous and the salad? What wine do you suggest? and dessert?

I used boneless lamb and veal (half each). It was a definite hit that I'll make again and pass on to friends and relatives.

I used Pork, it was wonderful

This was WONDERFUL. I've made it twice. I doubled it, and it served 9. The second time, I also found that I could freeze it. The trick is that you don't add the yellow squash before freezing. Rather, add it after defrosting, along with some water, and cook the squash in the tagine as part of reheating it.

This dish was delicious. I started out with lamb shoulder that weighed, with the bone, 3.5lbs. After the butcher took it off the bone for me there was only 1.85lbs. of meat. I followed the recipe (bones included) and it cooked beautifully. The only problem was that there is no way this recipe yields 4 adult servings. There really was enough for 2 adult portions. I plan on making this again, but next time I will multiply the ingredients.
