Very tasty side dish. I used pancetta instead of bacon and skipped the parsley.

Delicious!! I always cook the onion/pepper down longer in the bacon grease; let it mingle w/ no heat a bit; add defrosted or canned lima bean/corn and bacon at the same time; skip the water; add the salt/pepper; cook down a while longer; add the cream/chive/parsley and heat through; then turn off the heat until ready to eat. I never have leftovers and this recipe easily doubles!

This is really delicious. I usually skip the bell pepper because I don't like them. I rate this a 4 because it's one of those recipes out of one of those magazine issues where the page is crinkled from cooking splashes. I can't count the number of times I've made it, always to rave reviews.

I have made this recipe off and on for at least 3 years. It is, hands down, the most requested recipe I make. People love this dish. I have started it at 8am to serve at 7 pm. I've sauteed the vegetables and let them sit for 6 hours. I've added the corn and limas and let it sit for 2 or 3 hours. I never add any water. After the vegetables have cooked, I pour off the liquid, add to the cream, and reduce by half before I add back to the dish. I've never gone to the expense of using the chives.

This recipe is wonderful! A few years ago I discovered "soycutash" at TraderJoe's in the frozen section. Instead of limas, it has soy beans, along with corn and red bell peppers (which I prefer over green bell peppers anyway). I use it along with chicken broth instead of water, and stir the bacon in at the end. Even people that don't like limas or soy beans like this!

I made this recipe for Christmas and my non-veggie-loving family loved it. I substituted red bell pepper for green to make it more colorful. I also omitted the bacon as I am a vegetarian and used a little butter in its place. Will be making it again for Easter.

Perfect party dish. I made it for 70 guests last night. You can saute the peppers/onions in the morning, 2 hours before dinner add the corn and limas, then 1 hour before add the cream and reduce. Then, just reheat as needed. People really like it, even non lima likers such as myself. I don't think you can overcook it, which is important in a make ahead dish. Highly recommend.

Everyone loved this dish with the Thanksgiving meal. Very easy & straightforward to prepare.

I give this recipe a big A+ for excellence. I didn't have lima beans so I used frozen soy beans (shelled) and it was terrific! I also stirred the bacon into the dish. A great comfort food, overall, and perfect for cold weather. Definitely a keeper for the holiday season.

This dish went really well with baked ham and whipped sweet potatoes. The next day I added some more cream and chicken soup base and it made a great creamy soup. Easy and delicious!

I made this for my neighbor's 75th birthday party. Afterwards, his wife passed a message to me from his older sister: "Tell her to bring more of this next time because not everybody got to have seconds who wanted to". I guess I'll just have to follow that wisdom, only I think I'll make it a staple in all of our large gatherings, not just for birthdays.

this recipe was so yummy. my boyfriend loves lima beans (i don't) and i am always on the lookout for something we might both like. this is it!!! made it for thanksgiving and everybody loved it. i did have to cook the lima beans much longer than stated. make sure they are done before adding the corn,

I made this recipe for my cooking club and they loved it. I added a little more cream since the frozen vegetables needed a bit more cooking. I also mixed the bacon in at the end instead of sprinkling on top. This was part of a great overall meal--chicken fried steak and an herb cheese souffle. This was delicious and definitely a keeper!!

Call this 'Psychedelic Succotash'. Very good. I substituted half and half, though I'm well aware that I'm still looking at major calories. Still, I was raised on a similar version of this dish so to me it's comfort food. I like it with low-cal main dishes like poached fish or chicken...and a long walk after dinner to work off all those yum yum calories.
