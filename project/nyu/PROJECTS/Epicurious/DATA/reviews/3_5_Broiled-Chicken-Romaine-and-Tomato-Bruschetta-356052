I made this today and it was soooo good. Will definitely make this again next time. However, i replaced the italian bread with a regular brown bread. it doesn't make quite a difference though. And I used chicken breast too. Here's my blog about it http://iamsuperjulie.com

This was excellent! I used plain yogurt instead of mayo, and a yellow tomato instead of plum. Also, doubled the sauce recipe. Important for lettuce to be washed and dried, and remove pulpy bits of tomoato so that they grill nicely.

Tastes exceptional! A little tough to get everything to broil all on the same pan, especially if doubling. If there is something to take out of this recipe its the chicken. Alone it could be served easily as a main with a nice vegetable side.

This was fantastic...though I did play with it a bit. I used plain nonfat greek yogurt instead of mayo-first time i've ever subbed that and i swear it was fantastic-great flavor-and i added some sweet onion slices, just broiling along with everything else and seasoned like the tomatoes. Also slathered the bread in the yogurt mixture after rubbing it with garlic, instead of just having it on the side. I used sliced chicken breast so it broiled quickly and I actually pulled out that before the tomatoes and onions. The lettuce needs careful watching so it doesnt burn

Great recipe! I used a fresh Ciabatta loaf which I think was perfect for the bread portion. My only struggle was that this recipe was for only 1 serving... and I had to feed 4 people so I couldn't fit everything on one baking sheet. So I put the chicken and bread on the top rack and the tomatoes and lettuce on the next rack down, it worked out great.

I love this dish. My boyfriend especially loves the Parmesan mayonnaise lemon zest mix. The only problem I have with this dish is that I always burn the lettuce, any tips? Also, a better way to make this healthier?

Chicken is absolutely delicious, and combination of flavors and textures - wonderful. The presentation is awkward though. I made it twice, so maybe I just need to play with it..

it took quite a while to prep everything... and, i have an old school, very small, broiler so i could only cook one ingredient at a time. the entire process took nearly an hour. it was great but i can't say it was worth all the effort...

Thought this was good, but wouldn't make it again. The timing was a little tricky - the cutlets took another 5 minutes, and needed to be tented to prevent burning. All in all, good taste but too much juggling and monitoring.

All the ingredients in this are fine but the cooking method and final outcome were frankly not good! You can't just shove everything under the broiler and have it come out properly and there is way too much mayonnaise in the recipe. Can't say I would recommend this!

My husband made this dish for two different occasions and it was a super hit! He bought a nice ciabatta bread that we toasted and it was de-lish.

Super easy, cheap and delicious! Plus, the added bonus of only getting one baking sheet and two small bowls dirty. This is my new, can cook any where, for anyone, most favorite dish.
