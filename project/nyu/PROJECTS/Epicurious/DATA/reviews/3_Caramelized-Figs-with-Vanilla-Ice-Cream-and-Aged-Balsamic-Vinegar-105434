This is fast, easy, and excellent. In a pinch, I just use Trader Joe's balsamic, which is fine. Golden brown sugar works perfectly well. Small figs work better than large ones in that they cook and soften at about the same rate as the sugar caramelizes -- and the sugar should be just browning. Many skeptical but polite guests, including teenagers, have been won over at the first bite.

Fabulous! When fresh figs are plentiful, and you've had your fill of them in their natural state, this is a simple and elegant way to end a late summer meal. Used 20-year old balsamic vinegar.

This was bland for my taste...the baked figs with grand marnier on this site was much better.

So easy and so delicious. We used 12 year old balsamic vinegar, and it just topped off the rich sweet taste of the figs and brown sugar. Use french vanilla ice cream which made it so rich and yummy.

We loved this recipe. the burnt sugar on the figs was wonderful. I used the really old thick as molasas balsamic. I will definately make this again but double the figs. Fabulous!

I buttered a pyrex baking dish, sprinkled the figs with Tahitian vanilla infused sugar, and otherwise followed the directions. It was easy and delicious. Used Lorenza di Medici balsamic--not 18 years old, but it did the trick.

This was horrid. I cook a lot of different dishes and fixed this one because it sounded different and I couldn't quite imagine it. But I don't know that I've ever fixed something worse.

This was my first experience preparing figs and I was very impressed. This dessert has a great combination of flavors.
