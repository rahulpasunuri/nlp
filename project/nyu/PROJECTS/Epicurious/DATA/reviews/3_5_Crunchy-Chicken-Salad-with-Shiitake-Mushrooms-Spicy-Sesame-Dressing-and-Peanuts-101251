I omitted the cucumbers, mushrooms and mint as I didn't have any and added red bell pepper and edamame. DELICIOUS!! I really like the dressing (although I only used 1/2 the green onion, which was plenty). This makes a great "chopped salad". Definately a keeper.

Eh, nothing special at all. There are many great salad recipes here. This is not one of them. Boring average salad, slightly below average dressing. Ho-hum grilled chicken. I won't bother with this again.

This receipe is truly delicious and so VERY EASY!!! I added fresh ginger to the dressing, marinated chicken breast stripes and regular tofu in it for an hour and then stir fried it. I will be making this many times!

Excellent as is, I have made it several times and have a TIME SAVER, use pre- cooked chicken breasts, marinate the chicken and mushrooms for a couple of minutes while you chop the other veggies, then toss the whole thing, To replicate the heat you would get if you had time to marinate it, I added a few splashes of tabasco to the dressing/marinade, and the Mint is perfect herb--I dont know all why the substitutions!

Am I missing something? Where is the carrot ingredient amount and prep? I haven't made this, but will take previous reviewers advice and cut back on the oil.

This is quite a good marinade/dressing, but I reassembled the whole thing.... Shredded cabbage, sliced green onion, made small julienne of the carrot and cucumber, used generous fresh coriander (cilantro), chilled and shredded the cooked chicken and mushrooms, used the best nuts, added tsp sugar to dressing and wrapped it all up in little rice paper parcels tied with green onion. Took to a picnic and everyone loved them. Very yummy!

What a refreshing change from most Chicken salads - it is light plus quick and easy to prepare. I will definitely make it again, but with a few modifications. The chicken needs to marinate for more than 30-60 minutes. I would recommend overnight. The dressing was also better after sitting overnight. The second change is that I would double all of the dressing ingredients except the oil and red pepper flakes; I found it a bit heavy on oil. I followed the recommendation of other reviewers and used cilantro rather than mint - it was the right flavor combination. I also liked that the slaw held up pretty well overnight after being tossed with the dressing. I wouldn't recommend tossing it too earlier before serving, but it certainly makes leftovers more enjoyable.

Fantastic hot weather salad. Loved the Napa cabbage and the mushrooms were a wonderful addition. Also loved making the components ahead of time and grilling up the chicken and shrooms at the last minute. Didn't heat up the kitchen one bit!

I really liked this salad. I'm always up for some Asian flavors. The only thing I left out was the mint only b/c it's not one of my tastes. Other than that, I think this salad would do just as well with other lettuces & maybe throw in whatever fresh veg that you like. Thought some sliced radish would go well in this for color & more flavor. Enjoy!

This is excellent. Tasty and refreshing. I used dried (and reconstituted) chopped shitakes and sauteed it with the chicken in a skillet and it was still great.

Wonderful dish! Modifications were-leftover grilled chicken, sliced. Coated the mushrooms with the dressing and grilled in my indoor grill pan. I used half romaine/half napa cabbage sliced. I used a regular cucumber that I seeded and patted dry. Simply delicious!! Try this!!

This was a meal that you would find at a 5 star restaurant! It was wonderful! Since I love Cilantro, I did take into account the past reviews, and replaced the mint with Cilantro. It was delicious. Highly recommend it.

This was a delicious, simple and refreshing salad. The grilled shiitakes make the dish! Taking the suggestions of other reviewers, I added cilantro with the mint, which was very good. I also added shredded carrots and sliced the cucumber in half lengthwise before slicing it so that it work better in the salad, which is basically a slaw. This would also be good as a side dish without the chicken. Enjoy!

I served it to 6 adults and everyone ate it all. Pretty easy to make.

This was a great salad! I made it twice in one week as we wanted to share it with family visiting from out of town. However, the recipe on-line isn't quite correct. Don't use carrots as it calls for when mixing salad ingredients together. Also, I used 1/2 the mint suggested and doubled the sauce because it needs more than what's originally called for. It was light, interesting and will be a favorite for hot summer days!

This was probably THE best salad I've ever made! The dressing was delicious and light, and the shiitake mushrooms sure were a hit!

My wife says this salad is "Too too devine". I made it on a very pleasant summer Saturday in Connecticut, and it made the Saturday "pleasanter".

I made this for a friend's bridal shower and it was a big hit. I crumbled up some raw top ramen noodles which added a little crunch to the salad. I'm making it again for a friend's birthday party and can't wait for the left-overs!

I made many changes but was still disappointed in the results. There are far better Asian dressing recipes available at this site. I tried to improve with crushed garlic. Had no ginger, which would have helped. The excessive amounts of rice vinegar and dijon left a bitter taste that I off-set with a little sugar. Any veggies can be used. I chose cabbage, red pepper, grated carrot, jullienned snow peas and served on a bed of lettuce. Used chopped basil instead of mint, but a load of chopped cilantro would have been a great improvement. Used portabellos instead of shitakes. Finally, a skinless, boneless chicken breast that has been cooked on a hot grill for 8 minutes will be dry as dust. Half that time, certainly no more than 2.5 minutes on each side is plenty.

What carrots? I have not yet made this recipe, although it looks great and I intend to. Several reviewers mention carrots, I do not see them listed in the web version of this recipe. HELP!

The first time I made this dish, I couldn't find shiitake mushrooms, so sprinkled some of the "same-old" on it, and sauteed the lightly-pounded chicken breast halves in a bit of sesame oil. Turned out well. However, I did find shiitake mushrooms and my husband barbequed both. What a difference! He wasn't overly impressed with the mushrooms, but I thought they made the dish. Our guests insisted on the recipe, too. I am delighted to be able to recommend Epicurious as a super fount of wonderful recipes! Thanks.

I was looking for an oriental dressing for a chicken salad. This worked very nicely. I had cooked chicken, grated carrot, mushrooms, lightly cooked broccoli, asparagus, and sugar snap peas. The red peppers added a nice tang, and the sesame oil was wonderful.

Fresh, crunchy yummy salad. My boyfriend and I went for a picnic, and I made it the day before, keeping the dressing on the side. It was great the next day.

I added orange zest, diced red onion and a dash of apple juice to the dressing. I used it over mixed greens topped with seared assorted mushrooms, drizzling the dressing over all.

Next time, I would probably shred the carrots and julienne the cucumbers. The flavors held up well (I had to double the recipe) during a long day, but the carrots and cucumbers should have been bite-size, not sliced diagonally as suggested. I also baked the chicken in the oven after coating with the dressing, which turned out moist.

I made this dish when the recipe first came out, then couldn't remember which issue it was in. Thank goodness for Epicurious! The missing carrots are, according to the original recipe, "1 & 1/2 bunches carrots, peeled, sliced diagonally." I find the already shredded ones much easier to use. Thanks for the cilantro tip - I like it much better than the mint. This has become a family favorite, even with the kids! Great with spring rolls from your favorite restaurant.

Very good. Even better with Cilantro added -- thanks for that suggestion. Zingy, fresh, crunchy, yummy!

This is a great recipe for summer-time entertaining. It makes a lot of salad, and I doubled the recipe for 10 people and still had a bit left over. Couldn't get the shitakes, so replaced them with oyster mushrooms. And for fun, replaced the peanuts with cashews.

A few observations: the recipe mentions carrots, but they aren't listed in the ingredients, only in the directions. Also, I would suggest to anyone looking for a healthy dish to alter the dressing. As it stands, the salad contains a lot of fat. Try a Thai or Vietnamese-based dressing which relies less on oil, instead.

This has become my standard "chinese chicken salad" recipe. I always get compliments. Try adding cilantro in addition to or instead of the mint. Thinly sliced carrots are also a nice addition. Try it, it will become a part of your repetoire. Its easy and healthy

This is a delicious recipe that keeps well overnight. We were thinking about replacing the chicken with a fish like blackened tuna next time to add some more flavor. This was also pretty easy to make, and makes quite a bit (We cut it in half for two people and still had lunch for one).
