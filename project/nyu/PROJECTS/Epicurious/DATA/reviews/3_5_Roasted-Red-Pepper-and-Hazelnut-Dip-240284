This was good but not amazing or anything. I love the hazel nut oil it contains. I will be using the oil from this recipe in salad dressings and other recipes, that oil is good stuff. I served the dip at thanksgiving as an appetizer and people liked it but didn't rave or anything. I'm not sure If I'd make it again.

Very easy and quick to make. It was a great hit - people ate it with pita chips and crudites. There was none leftover after the party and I made quite a lot.

Delicious and smooth -- I may have underdone it with the hazelnut oil though, and overdone it with the cumin. A colorful, great snack with carrots and celery as well as with pita chips.

I followed recipe exactly except that I may have added a bit more red peppers (used half of 500 ml jar), so it was thick and rich. I used panko bread crumbs. I served it as a dip with pita toasts, but it would also be delicious as an accompaniement to grilled meat or as a sandwich spread. My guests like it so much they took it to the dinner table after we were done with cocktails. No leftovers.

Served this with pita chips and my guests loved it. I used quite a bit more cumin and also added some dried red pepper flakes. I agree that the addition of a bit of lemon juice really brightens all the flavors in the dip. Don't be tempted to cheat and use canned bread crumbs; the fresh crumbs really make the texture of this dip. A keeper for sure!

This dip was very good. I served it with crudites at a Mother's Day picnic. Everyone enjoyed it. I added the juice of 1/2 a lime to brighten up the flavor. Would have used lemon juice, but didn't have a lemon.

Not great, a bit bland and boring.

This was quick, easy, and delicious. Definitely one one the best dips I've had. I am serving it with pesto pita chips. The only down side is the few ingredients are quite expensive if you don't already have them, especially the walnut oil. Worth it though.

This recipe is fantastic! Using a baguette helped out the texture. I doubled the cumin and pepper, and cut the salt in half, and it was easily the best dip I have ever served. This also makes a great sandwich spread! This will absolutely be a regular addition to my menu
