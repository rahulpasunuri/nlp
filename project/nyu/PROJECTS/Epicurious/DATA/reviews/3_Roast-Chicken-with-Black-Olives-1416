One of my favorites. Short prep time. Very moist chicken.

Love this recipe. Easy to make and the chicken is nice and moist

Too salty overall and not that interesting... Needs something else-- maybe add mushrooms or shallots? Pretty bland..

I enjoyed the dish, makes a nice change for roast chicken.
