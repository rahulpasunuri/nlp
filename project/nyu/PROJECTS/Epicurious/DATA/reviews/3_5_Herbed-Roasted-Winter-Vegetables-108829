This has become my "go to" recipe for roasted winter veggies. I use the vegetables I have on hand and modify the herbs according to my tastes - so what's of real value here is the technique. Enjoy!

This is one of my go-to recipes for Fall/Winter. It's cheap, easy (minus all the chopping!), and delicious. After a few iterations, I find that rosemary is a great substitute for the other herbs (if you use it very liberally). Also, the vegetables can have a lot of water in them if they are fresh, and that can prevent a nice browning/texture if you're not careful. it's important to dry the vegetables after washing and peeling . I also split the vegetables on at least 2 trays to give them room. Lastly, I finish them off on low broil for a few minutes if they haven't browned already.

This didn't do much for me. Maybe if I had cut the vegetables smaller? I doubt I will try it again.

I made this for Thanksgiving two years ago and everyone has been asking for the recipe ever since. Obviously it was a repeat last year. There are so many vegetables that I actually split them onto two cookie sheets to roast, and I add some extra garlic because that's my favorite.

Excellent! Great combination of vegetables and flavors. We used the leftovers to make a soup. Will definately make it again.

This recipe has become a standard Thanksgiving dish for our large family gathering. Everyone loves it and they requested it specifically last year after I made it the first time the year before. The herbed butter that is broiled into the root vegetable smells and tastes delicious. I follow the recipe exactly as it is written with the entire variety of root vegetables. It is very important to cook the red beets separately as instructed, because they will dye the rest of the vegetables and the dish wont look nice when served.

We had a small gathering, and a friend thought the recipe looked good, so I split it into two 8X8 pans. Everyone loved it. I'll be making it again

I didn't use the beets or parsnips but I (large)cubed acorn and butternut squash, used the shallots and garlic as noted. I tossed the veggies in olive oil, generously sprinkled with the spices amd roasted in a 375 degree convection oven for 30 minutes. This veggie recipe was fabulous. Unless the beets (which I love) made it awful, I can't imagine how this recipe could fail.

I can't believe anyone could like this recipe. This was the worst dish I have ever eaten - it was just awful. I thought it would be a different Thksgvg side dish but I was definitely wrong!

Too many veggies, too little reward for the time and money invested. We felt it was bland and boring.

A very impressive dish for company, easy to prepare, and makes the whole kitchen smell great. We have already made it three times, always to rave reviews.
