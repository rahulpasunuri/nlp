Forgot to say I love parsnips, so my review is not about their flavor.

I cut the ingredients in half, and did not weigh the bacon. I used 2 thick slices for 1 pound of parsnips. The parsnip flavor was completely lost in the bacon and hazelnut abyss. Parsnips are a delicate vegetable, more than celeriac and less than fennel, so the flavors here were completely out of balance. I threw out whatever was left because it was so inedible!

I wasn't thrilled with this recipe: I didn't even finish all of the leftovers. I followed the directions but the half & half bubbled over onto my oven! Ack! That would have been ok if I thought the recipe was divine but it was just ok. The parsnips with the bacon and hazelnuts were rich but the whole dish probably would have been better with some main course to balance it out. All in all it wasn't worth all the effort that I put into it.

I made these for New Year's Eve last year and my friends have been talking about them ever since! Every one asked me to make them again this year, which is why I'm on the site looking up the recipe again. I did this with farmer's market parsnips, and yes, it was to die for. I used half and half instead of whipping cream, and this year will try cutting down on the fat even a bit more with some evaporated milk. But this dish is worth the indulgence!

This was amazing and unexpected. You have to follow a few steps to make it really tasty since it is a simple recipe and ingredients matter. I skipped bacon and used canola oil. You must toast the hazelnuts (I used a food processor to chop them) and homemade chicken stock. It wasn't salty at all, rather sweet and crunchy with the sage and the nuts providing an interesting contrast in taste and texture. Can't imagine how much better this will be with farmer's markets parsnips.

This dish exceeded my expectations, and I think I will make a purely vegetarian version omitting the bacon.

I had this dish at a dinner party and LOVED it. What a wonderful taste surprise. The bacon was crisp, the parsnips thin and tender and the hazelnuts a surprise taste treat. For something different try this one, it is delicious. I liked it so much that this is why I was searching on line to find the receipe.

Parsnips are a very under-rated vegetable and this recipe uses them in a very delcious, satisfying way. Great cold winter night side-dish

To kschanak in Boy Lake: Where do I start? First of all the recipe calls for 1.5 teaspoons kosher salt (kosher is not capitalized) not 1.5 tablespoons. I also believe the recipe calls for too much salt. Secondly, salt is salt! However, not all of a given amount of salt is sodium. I think this is what you meant. Finally, table salt and kosher salt do not have the same saltiness WHEN MEASURED BY VOLUMN when the salt ends up in solution (as in this recipe). Most cooking Web sites will tell you to use 1.5 to 2X the amount of kosher salt to table salt. Just google something like "kosher salt saltiness" to verify or check out this site: http://www.reluctantgourmet.com/blog/?p=18

To the cook in Chicago; I am sorry but Kosher salt is NOT less salty. The grains are larger, hence, more salt per grain. Try this test - Take 3 grains of regular iodized salt, and 3 grains of Kosher salt. Taking a drink of water between each serving, taste the salt. 3 grains of Kosher salt will be almost overpowering on your tongue. If you disagree, let me know. And by the way, salt is not salt. It depends on the amount you are ingesting. Yes, 1 1/2 Tbsp. of Kosher salt is too much for this recipe.

Two other sources of saltiness are the bacon (some saltier than others) and the use of other salts than kosher. One teaspoon of kosher salt is less salty than one teaspoon of other salts.

It's a great idea, but needs some work. And maybe it's because I used regular chicken broth instead of low-sodium, but this dish turned out *way* too salty in my opinion. I plan to try it again with only 1/2 tsp salt-- people can always add more salt to their plates if they like.
