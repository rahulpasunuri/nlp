Absolutely excellent! I also thought about using wanton rounds but they were out at the store. Made the dough, it was very easy to work with and quite delicious. I doubled the amount of mushrooms, and cooked half separately. I added them after I had pureed the original mix, so that there was a little more texture, and the mushroom flavor would stand out rather than be buried beneath the liver.

Made this without the liver--delicious. The pastry was amazing. Served them with the beet consomme and everyone loved them.

To make these even easier than they are, I buy won ton rounds. Excellent as an addition to a cocktail party. I tend to think tomtom24 had tainted liver--or an accute bout of the flu.

I bought the ingredients to make these last xmas thinking it was on the cooking wishlist as there were so many other things going on.I literally whipped these up with some downtime and they were delicious! My husband who said he wouldn't even try them because of the liver liked them.This is a must try if they seem interesting to you (probabaly also scaled back on the liver. I'm gald to be reminded of them here

I served this to my mother and father and the three of us were on the verge of fighting each other for use of the toilet. I called in sick to work 2 days in a row because my bowels were so week and untrustworthy. My father and mother flew home the next day and lets just say Northwest airlines was not happy with the way my dad left his seat. bon apetit

We made this along with the Beet Consomme. Both were very good. I was a little nervous about the liver, so I think I dialed back the amount, but if I did it over again I'd probably use the full amount. I made them a week in advance and froze them - worked out well. I did need to bake them a bit longer then the instructions.
