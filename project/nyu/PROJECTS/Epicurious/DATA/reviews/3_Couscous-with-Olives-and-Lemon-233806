This recipe makes great couscous. Because it's such a simple dish, a lot is going to depend on the quality of the ingredients you use, particularly the olives. I made it with a whole-wheat couscous, and it was very good.

Go for lots of garlic and lemon zest in this recipe - I used the couscous for stuffed peppers. It was delicious!

Easy as cous cous usually is, and went well with the Chicken Paillards it's recommended with.

thought this was horrible, paired it with a scrumptious salmon, but the meal was brought done a notch from the blandness of the couscous. worst reciepe ever.

I sort of combined this recipe with the one of couscous with herbs, so I added half a cup of fresh basil and a quarter cup fresh mint. Also used all chicken broth (no water ) It was excellent - my guests loved it!

We made this to accompany the chicken paillards mentioned, and they went together prefectly. The couscous was a nice light accompanyment to the bolder flavor in the chicken.

Although I think couscous is generally dry, my husband likes it so I made this recipe. It has great flavor and is perfect as a light-flavored accompaniment. I served it along side a scallop dish and it was perfect.

This recipe on its own is bland. Be sure to serve it with some kind of saucy main dish, like the recommended Moroccan-spiced chicken. Using chicken broth instead of water also helps.

Add some depth of flavor without competing with your main dish by substituting good quality low-salt chicken broth (e.g. Kitchen Basics brand) and a shot of demiglace (or leftover pan juices from a roast) for the water.

I thought that this recipe really complemented the 'Moroccan-Spiced Chicken Paillard' recipe. I made it pretty much as directed, but may have put in more garlic than called for, as I didn't measure it. As others have stated, couscous should be relatively bland and not compete with the dish it is paired with. (Complaining about couscous being bland would be like saying that spaghetti is bland before you put the sauce on it.) Also, it should be noted that since this is a 'quick kitchen' recipe, you should expect some short cuts in preparation and save the more elaborate method for the weekend. I haven't been to Morocco like some of the other posters, but I've been to Moroccan restaurants in France. They brought the couscous to the table in a big copper, double-boiler style pot called a couscousier. The couscous steamed in a basket above the vegetables. Above that, another basket contained raisins and chick peas in different sections. You got a choice of meats and a hot sauce called 'harissa' was served along side.

I liked this with the Moroccan chicken. In my opinion couscous is supposed to absorb the flavors of whatever it is served with it. I happen to enjoy couscous with just some lemon, but the olive was a nice touch. I thought the couscous made a perfect "bed" for the sauce and chicken. Looked pretty, tasted great. BTW, I have never used the word "couscous" this many times... :)

Couscous is always bland. We like it that way so that it does not compete with a more flavorful entree. To add some pizazz to this delightful dish, add a bit more garlic but do not brown the garlic, and instead of parsley, use mint or cilantro (depending on your entree)and the juice of 1/2 lemon along with the zest.

To the 'unimpressed Chef'; I love cous cous but it is very bland. As a chef, do you have any alternative suggestions as I wasn't impressed by this one either?

This is a wonderful recipe for couscous and I serve it often with grilled or broiled rainbow trout filets. People cannot get enough!

Preserved lemon would really add to the authenticity of flavor here. Also, the previous poster was apparently entirely correct in the assertion that cous cous should be steamed and not be boiled/immersed in boiling water (as in this recipe). This week's edition of Good Eating in the Chicago Tribune had a fascinating article on the origin and correct preparation of cous cous. Apparently north Africans would never allow for cous cous to directly touch water and only steam it- often over simmering stews. A French officer (as I recall from the article)created the dried boxed version we are familiar with, but even then north Africans will steam the dried version. The results are apparently much, much fluffier and delicate in volume, texture, and taste.

can she tell us how to make mint tea as well? i have vowed to become not only a foodie, but a message board nazi after reading this exchange. can you believe these people exist in reality? i thought you only see them on sex and the city . . . or whatever her favorite sitcom is. i will be hitting the board often! stay tuned, pooch69 p.s. i love olives. kalamata? or oil cured? would this nice, little stash of dutch cured green olives i have work well? i think meyer lemon would make a nice touch. any feedback?

I made this as per recipe except I used Kalamata olives from a jar. It was great! I served it as a side with the Moroccan Spiced Chicken Paillards with a little sauce drizzled on. A truly fine meal.

So, how's the couscous?

There are more exciting recipes for cous cous out there. However, let's clarify a few things. The cultural 'expert' who spent three weeks as a tourist in Morocco stated that cous cous is not a grain. Cous cous is a noodle, like linguini and ramen. And like all those, it's made of grain. More specifically cous cous is made of durum semolina, a type of wheat. Let's not mislead celiacs and others who cannot or choose not to consume wheat products about the make up of cous cous. And let's also acknowledge that fresh noodles get cooked differently than dried noodles. If you've ever made pasta, the fresh stuff cooks faster than dried. And while some Italians will make their linguine from scratch and some Chinese will make their ramen from scratch, dried noodles work when time, equipment or priorities preclude making them from scratch and they do need to be boiled for an appropriate amount of time. And dried cous cous needs to be steeped in water that has just been boiled for an appropriate amount of time.

Could you all just stop flaming each other and tell the rest of us what you thought of the recipe! This is not the appropriate venue to discuss what Moroccans think of us. I came to this site because I love cooking- not to discuss biased and narrow-minded views of other ethnic of national groups.

IF the arabic word for shame is "shooma", then that's what moroccans SHOULD say about FOREIGNERS [foreiners] and THEIR [they're] terrible spelling! AND YES, I THINK THAT LEMON JUICE SHOULD BE ADDED TO BRING UP THE FLAVOR.

We say Shooma to pompous New Yorkers and they're (their) poor use of correct spelling.

As the cook from Oxford, MS points out, the recipe doesn't say anything about boiling couscous, so the previous reviewer is mistaken if they thought it did. Also, can't help wondering what the Moroccans would say about your spelling, Edward3 from NY--if they think we're such terrible cooks, they'd probably take real issue with your misspellings. ;)

Just FYI, the Arabic word for shame is not shooma, which I've never heard, but 'eeb'.

If you read carefully you will note that you boil the water... not the cous cous!! This is a good side dish, and is great with the chicken it is suggested for. It will not stand alone, and is intended to complement another dish, with sauce etc.

never boil couscous! i just got back from three-weeks in morocco and they curse anyone who ever boils couscous! traditional moroccans make couscous by hand (that's right, it's not a grain) and then steam couscous twice to cook it. more modern moroccans say that if you do buy couscous that's already cooked (boxed versions vary), that you're better off microwaving it than you are boiling it. the arabic word for shame is "shooma", and that's what moroccans say about foreiners and they're terrible cooking!

Easy, but really bland. Maybe adding lemon juice in addition to the rind would help.
