Appreciate all the comments about the proper way to make ganache, but to keep the recipe dairy-free (which matters for kosher reasons if you wish to eat with a meat meal, which most traditional holiday meals are), you can't make a ganache with cream. Any other suggestions from folks out there?

Long run for a short slide. I was underwhelmed. A lot of work for something that was really only so-so at best.

A lot of prep - a lot of work. The orange syrup does not add anything to the chocolate frosting or the torte when presented. I would make it again but add kirsch or orange liquor to the syrup and the frosting.

I followed all the comments and made the recipe yesterday for an ecumenical Easter dinner today, using almond flour, pure vanilla flavoring and adding cream to the ganache. I also used a 61% cacao ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate and with 20 ounces of chocolate, there was an abundance of chocolate of intense flavor. I used blood oranges in the compote. The result was an impressive presentation. I think it came out very well. I will definitely make it again, but I think I will make 1/4 to 1/2 of the chocolate ganache and try a raspberry jam between the layers, or just use less chocolate between the layers.

I am so relieved to read the reviews and see that I was not the only one to have the chocolate sieze on me!! I added more of the syrup to thin it out some, but ended up only putting the icing between the layers and on the top. I then put a "frosting" of slivered almonds on the top. The macaroons came out fine. Everyone at our seder raved about the taste and even commented on how attractive it was. Now that I know the secret of the ganache I will try it again (maybe next year!).

Don't fall for the title, this has neither macaroons, nor is a torte, nor really has 'frosting'. I wish I'd read the reviews to know about the issues with the frosting, mine didn't work for the same reasons. Also don't call something a macaroon when it's really a meringue, I would not have made this if I'd really known the texture it would have had. At least the flavor was nice.

I agree with the other reviewers; knew almost immediately after adding the chocolate to the hot syrup that the liquid proportion was not correct - but too late. To make a spreadable ganache with 20 oz. of chocolate you will need upwards of 12 oz. of hot cream. Try the Chocolate Orange Ganache recipe from the "Dark Chocolate Wedding Cake" recipe (epicurious.com -- Gourmet 1996). Forget the orange syrup and use Cointreu instead for orange flavoring. My macaroon layer flattened too much also and was very crispy. I thought about brushing a little of the syrup over that layer before frosting, but was afraid it would dissolve. My seder reviewers thought it tasted great and ate the layers, as they fell apart, as if they were chocolate coated cookies.

Ok, this was delicious, no doubt about that. However, it was not ideal in several ways. One was probably my fault, in that I had to make it on a very rainy day, so the macaroon just didn't come out well--it was like 1/2 inch high, at best. The frosting, though, was just bizarre. yes, it tasted great but it was, as another reviewer noted, possessing the consistency of play-doh! I spread it as fast as I possibly could, but literally every second that it cooled, it got more and more play-doh-ier. the final product wasn't pretty, due to the crazy texture of the frosting. All that said, yes, I'd make it again and yes, it got rave reviews from the seder attendees. In fact, one of them asked for the recipe to make for a party later this week. Still, come on, what is the deal with the frosting?? Please help as I'd love to make this again but would like an assist on the frosting!

Great taste, but I agree with some of the other comments - use almond meal to save time. I also think the orange syrup in the melted chocolate was tasteless. The chocolate layers NEED to be more like ganache, so find a good recipe and use that. Next time I'll leave the ganache off the sides of the cake; this is the right amount of frosting. This recipe is really delicious if you pinch in a bit of salt into the macaroon batter.

Yes, the chocolate did seize, and yes the macaroons were thinner then expected and a bit crispy but we all enjoyed it. Now that I know about the cream I would try this recipe again.

I just got back from the seder where we had this for dessert. I don't think it was worth the cost - almost $50.00 for ingredients. Everyone liked it, but it was more like biscotti - we had to take a butcher knife to cut it and eat it with fingers, certainly not cake/torte like. The cake part got very crispy even though I baked it for less time than called for and the icing seized on me also. I ended up putting it on with my hands like playdoh! I've never had a Bon Appetit recipe fail me like this and won't be making it again. Gave it two forks for taste.

One of my favorite bloggers made this recipe and encountered lots of problems. She revised it and it's much better now. I thought I'd pass along the tip: http://smittenkitchen.com/2010/03/almond-macaroon-torte-with-chocolate-frosting/

I called Jar, Suzanne Tracht's wonderful LA restaurant and there's a typo in the directions. There should be cream added to the chocolate ganache. Use 1/2 cup warm cream added to the melted chocolate mixture. If not thick enough, add up to 1/4 cup more.

My sister called Suzanne Tracht's restaurant regarding the issue with the frosting. Apparently there is a typo. There should be heavy cream in the frosting. They said to add 1/2 cup of warmed heavy cream to the frosting. They said if needed up to an additional 1/4 cup can be used. Hope this helps.

Having spent nearly $50 on the chocolate and vanilla beans for this recipe imagine my chagrin when the icing was INEDIBLE. I followed the recipe to the "T", am an experienced (and rather skilled) cook, and this simply DOES NOT WORK. As the other reviewers cited, the icing seizes up long before ever becoming smooth. Also, as an aside, the icing carries very little of the orange flavor with it, the macaroons are about as flat as pancakes, and the flavor is lackluster at best. I wouldn't make this again if Jesus himself came down and requested it. My disappointment was quadrupled by the fact that I made this for my Mother's bday, and it was only good for the compost bin. Solid zero out of ten. SHAME ON YOU BON APPETIT.

I had the frosting seize up as well -- I saved it by beating it with some cream, but of course that only works because I'm taking it to a dairy seder. Also, the macaroon layers were very thin. I haven't eaten it yet, but this is going to come out more like a pile of heavy chocolate frosting with cookies in it than a cake. Maybe if I'd been more delicate at the folding stage, it would have turned out better.

This recipe was a disaster for me!!! While I was lamenting the "seized" chocolate ...I over baked the macaroon and it was not a cake but a cookie. I am not going to bother again with this recipe. I am going to bring cheese to the party.

I made the frosting twice and both times it turned into chocolate play dough. I made sure to not over heat the chocolate but it still siezed. Did anyone else have this experience?

I wanted to experiment with the almond-macaroon part of this recipe. Instead of processing almonds and using fresh vanilla beans I did as follows. I made the meringue as directed, substituting 1 tsp of vanilla for the seeds from vanilla beans. I used 2 cups of almond meal (from trader joes)instead of processing almonds. The dry ingredients were folded into the egg white mixture. It turned out perfect and saved me time and money!
