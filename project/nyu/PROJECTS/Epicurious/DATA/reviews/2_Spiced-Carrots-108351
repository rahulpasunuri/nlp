This was just OK. I made it with the herb stuffed chicken, which was really dull. If it all came together I'd make again, but it didn't, so I won't.

This was just ok. I served it at a dinner party with lamb -- one person loved it and the rest were just being kind. It's very "cumin-y" and a little too sweet. It might have been better with whole cumin vs the ground.

I replaced the parsley with chopped coriander and it was great.
