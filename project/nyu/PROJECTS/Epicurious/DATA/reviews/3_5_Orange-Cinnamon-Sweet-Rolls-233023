I made a double batch of these and served them to several different crowds to great acclaim. Christmas eve guests enjoyed them fresh out of the oven with a glass of glogg and thought they were better than traditional sweet breads. On Christmas morning, I reheated them for ten minutes and they were an easy, warm and wonderful treat in a festive morning. After dinner, some chose to enjoy these as not-too-sweet dessert. After Christmas, we reheated the leftovers and they were a nice way to stretch the celebration into breakfast again. The kids loved them, friends loved them, family loved them. They are lightly sweet and wonderfully fragrant but essentially just a comforting, buttery roll. They aren't really anything like a cinnamon roll; just a warm, orange-y yeast bread.

Some suggestions: I doubled the amount of cinnamon and added an additional 1/4 cup of sugar to sweeten it up just a bit. To help with the density issue: I only added a handful of flour to the dough after processing it in the mixer - adding another 1 to 1 1/4 cups seemed excessive. I also let the first rise go for about 2 hours in a warmed oven (preheat to 350 for one minute, then turn your oven off) before punching it down.

These are quite dense & not very sweet -- I used orange zest from an entire orange, about 2 tbsp, and the orange flavor was still VERY subtle without the orange butter. I tried putting 1/3 cup orange marmalade in the dough, as well, and that helped. The best thing though was making icing from confectioner's sugar & St Germain elderflower cordial. It's alcoholic but tastes floral-citrusy when mixed with the powdered sugar. I made this icing w/ powdered sugar & fresh orange juice, too, but the elderflower cordial was by far the best. We'll see how well the leftovers reheat tommorrow. Also made

I agree with the reviewer from orange county - these came out extremely dense, too much so to be a breakfast roll, too sweet to be a dinner roll, and far too heavy to be a dessert. If I knew how to make them fluffier, I might give the recipe another try.

These rolls are huge and very pretty. They do not, however, taste very special. Despite their size and fluffy appearance, they are extremely dense and heavy and the orange cinnamon flavor is too subtle. The orange butter accompaniment is a must if you are making them because without it, they taste like dinner rolls. Maybe an orange flavored cream cheese would make them more of a stand out.

This roll has become a staple at holiday dinners, this will be the 3rd time I have made them. The orange butter is a definite must! The rolls are huge, I have thought about trying to make them smaller but have not done so yet. Other than that, this recipe is great as-is.

These were outstanding! Even my husband who is notoriously finnicky loved them. The orange butter makes these rolls very memorable.

Since this recipe takes a lot of time, I decided to try doing the second rise in the refrigerator. I think that may be part of why they didn't turn out fabulous - they were a little dry. Also, it might help to make them smaller. Last, I'd add 2 teaspoons of cinnamon next time. For the orange butter, I made orange mascarpone cheese instead. Now, that was a hit!!

These were absolutely wonderful! I made them 3 times already, and my family has eaten them all up each time (with the orange butter). I did however make an alteration. Instead of rolling the buns into separate balls, I rolled them into slightly smaller balls and made them in 2 square pans (9 buns each), and cut them on top with x's like hot cross buns, let them rise, buttered and baked them. I found these to be much softer rolls.

This made huge rolls! Instead of the orange butter, I made an orange icing to glaze them. Very good recipe.
