I have made this recipe for years using Strawberries instead of peaches and walnuts or almonds. Always turns out great, no floating crust. It might be my oven.

It's hard to go wrong with fruit crumbles, but there are certainly better recipes out there. I made the recipe exactly as printed, how uncreative of me, I know. Should have followed my instincts and: 1)used flour instead of tapioca, which lends a weird gelatinous, lumpy texture to the juices, 2) halved the topping, as there was twice as much topping as filling. Not that it's too bad to eat leftovers for breakfast, just not cobbler perfection.

The last paragraph should say "Broil 6 inches from heat just until topping is crisp" etc.

I hate it when cooks completely change the recipe and then "review" it....BUT, I changed peaches for strawberries, hazelnuts for walnuts, tapioca for flour.....AND, it was wonderful!

I've make this dish each spring when I have rhubarb coming out of my ears. I too love rhubarb and hazelnuts....love the flavor. The second time that I made this recipe, I used pecans instead and a little more tapioca.

I made this recipe two days in a row - it is easy with mouthwatering results. We do not like the strong taste of hazelnuts so I substituted toasted blanched almonds. Will definitely make again and again.

I've made this twice so far. I skipped the browning under the broiler the second time - no appreciable difference in taste. I also substituted granny smith apples for the rhubarb, and walnuts for the hazelnuts. It was a complete hit at the office.

I've made this fantastic recipe twice, the first time using flour instead of tapioca, the second time using the specified amount of tapioca. In both cases there was far too much liquid and the top , which floated in it, didn't brown. More tapioca? More flour?

A clean crisp dish very pleasing to the palate..

I love rhubarb and it grows like weeds up here. In the summer I cut and freeze 2 C. servings of rhubarb and then combine it with other frozen fruits for summer pies in the dead of winter. This peach crisp really hit the spot considering it's currently -11F outside. A good twist to this recipe is to use crunched up ginger snaps in place of the oats. You may have to use a little more ginger snap crumbs than oats, it depends on how you like your crust.
