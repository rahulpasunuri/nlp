So good! To dissatisfied reviewers: I have absolutely NO idea what you're talking about! If you get frustrated during the process of cooking it, it will not come out tasting well. I was worrisome too about the tofu being cooked with the rest of the stuff (no wok)- I though it would come out raw. I was wrong, so wrong! It came out delicious- I did forget to add the spinach (I also didn't use spinach - I used Bors) I ended up cooking that afterwards. Also, the prep time does take some time. All in all- 4 forks!

Ugh. By far the worst Epicurious recipe I've ever tried. I had doubts about the spinach but I followed the recipe anyway because it was the first time I made it. The spinach bogs the whole thing down into a slimy mess. However, leaving out the spinach is not enough to save this boring and not at all quick (lots of prep time) mish-mash. (Olive oil in Thai food?) I wish I could give it no stars as I'm about to throw out about a lot of expensive leftovers.

This was ok, but I won't make it again. I coated the tofu in cornstarch & fried it ahead of time, which worked great. I also added jalapenos to heat it up, & substituted bok choy for the spinach. In the end the dish was just rather bland, there are better recipes out there.

This was delicious and easy to make, but a few things to note, especially if you're dieting: so tasty, I wanted more. Four portions are VERY skimpy. It'd be one thing if you were serving this atop a cup of rice, but on its own, it's not enough for a satisfying entree. I would double the spinach, and cut oil down to 1/4 cup (probably could have cut even more--the other flavors more than compensate).

This is a good week night dish: it comes together quickly and you likely have most, if not all, of the ingredients on hand. Even though I love hot and spicy food, I kept the spices as written since the intended audience included a 20 month old. I served this over jasmine rice and was very pleased to see my 20 month old eating it up alongside my husband. I did replace one tablespoon of soy sauce with fish sauce but I don't think it made a real difference. The dish could use a "pow" of something but it is otherwise an easy, healthy dish that pleased the spectrum of diners in our house.

Followed some of the recommendations below and served with rice noodles. My family loved it. Wanted the tofu to remain more "intact", but the flavors were great. Used key limes, which added great tang.

Rating: 4
Certainly not authentic Thai, however a crowd pleaser recipe for all tofu-lovers. Taste, spice, and roasted peanuts add another dimension of flavor to the mixture. Will continue to make it and might try the more authentic suggestions made by the previous reviewer. Unfortunately I have never seen Thai basil in this country.

Reasonably healthy, and my family absolutely enjoyed it...A little bland for my taste. Next time I'll add red curry paste, more garlic, perhaps some fish sauce!

Rating: 3
after reading other comments, i realized this recipe was not very authentic thai. so i used fish sauce instead of soy sauce as suggested. and also used red curry paste which i think made a huge difference! i also used 4 whole crushed chili peppers. we like things hot! also, i cooked it in sesame oil, not olive oil. i'm korean so i had all this stuff in the house anyways except the fish sauce which i bought. wanted thai basil, but it wasn't available near my house. i'm growing it, but it wasn't ready yet.

Delicious! A great idea for someone who is trying to eat healthy, but has a husband who doesn't like health food because its bland and boring (esp tofu). I made it in 30 minutes including prep and paired it with brown rice.

Easy to prepare and a hit with my entire family, which is no mean feat considering the main protein is tofu and it was chock full of veggies. I particularly liked the texture the peanuts added. I served hot sauce at the table to give it some extra heat (which I think it needed, but it was perfect as is for my children). I also served with steamed brown rice. Will definitely make again.

Rating: 3
I thought this was really good and we are not huge tofu fans in this house. I used a red and yellow pepper and purple kale in place of the spinach and the dish was really colorful and delicious. I did sprinkle everything with a bit of sugar while it was in the wok to take the bitterness off the kale. Healthy tasty dish. My boyfriend was just eating the cold leftovers saying "mmmmm" with every bite!

Rating: 3
About as Thai as I am (which is to say, not very), but tasty nonetheless. I forgot the spinach and so used green beans; next time I might swap out one tablespoons of soy sauce for fish sauce. I didn't fry my tofu and didn't feel the need. Went really well with the suggested Sesame Rice.

Rating: 3
I should have mentioned that I used no more than 3 tblsp oil and extra firm fried tofu which I then fried again.

Delicious. I plan on making large batches of this regularly. Leftovers were good, too: the flavors, which were bright and discernible when I made it, had blended together (like a stew) into something deeper and richer.

I've eaten a lot of Thai food and have been to Thailand twice. This recipe is NOT Thai. To make it more authentic, you might try replacing the soy sauce with fish sauce, reducing the garlic and omitting the ginger, but I'm not sure even that would save this unsavory, overcooked, textureless mess.

Rating: 3
Tonite was my 2nd time making this for DH and myself, and it's been very enjoyable both times (made 1/2 recipe). I didn't have any Peanuts, so used a couple spoonfuls of peanut butter instead. Yum! Also, both times, I tossed this with pasta for a complete dinner. I used the full amount of the seasonings for the 1/2 recipe in order to increase the flavour.

Rating: 3
I don't see how you could say this is bland. The basil, garlic, ginger, red pepper, and soy are a great combo! I did use a lot less oil and pre-fried the tofu as others recommended. Next time, I'll allot less cooking time for the red peppers and green onions because I prefer both a bit crisper. It was great, and my boyfriend who wasn't that hungry gobbled his serving down.

Rating: 2
This was quick and easy, but terribly bland (normally I like tofu and eat it on a weekly basis). I'd recommend, like the others, to cook the tofu a bit before, but really, this recipe is in need of some serious tweaking to make it good.

Rating: 4
Very good. I might add a bit more soy. I did add Mirin (1-2 tablespoons) which went nicely with the sweet peppers. Mushrooms would be great; 1/2 a green pepper; a pinch of bean sprouts. Use the full 16-ounces of greens. It seems like a lot but after wilting, it's not. We used bok choy, torn, in place of spinach, and topped with cashews. Great aromatic flavours and delicious as leftovers.

Rating: 3
I recommend prefrying the tofu, as many have suggested. Also, more garlic. I added garden fresh jalapeno pepper along with crushed red pepper and the zing in the dish is nice, not too subtle, not too overpowering. The type of spice that walks behind you, slinking in the shadows with it's hand on your shoulder. Use less soy sauce; too salty.

Rating: 3
I also used a bit less oil, and more garlic, and more red pepper as I like it spicy. I will definitely try frying the tofu next time as it did crumble a bit too much. Loved the flavor, and have made it again several times.

Rating: 3
I will say upfront that I made some adjustments to this recipe, but my end result was AWESOME so I will share. I cut the oil in 1/2 and only used one bell pepper and added 2 crookneck squash, since I have a ton. I am allergic to peanuts so I was going to sub cashews, but forgot and didn't miss them. I fried up the tofu before adding it as directed because I really like my tofu to add some texture to a dish. I also added about a tablespoon of Asian sesame oil with the basil. I used fresh Thai basil instead of regular. Finally, I served this with a cup of basmati rice cooked with a veggie bouillon cube and about a tablespoon of rice vinegar. I cannot say enough about how good this was. It had some nice pop to it too, I did use the full 3/4 tsp of the red pepper flakes.

I made this for a dinner party with a vegan friend. Served it with Asian-Flavored Coleslaw with Rice Vinegar and Ginger (can be found on this site). The only change I made was to add about a teaspoon extra of red chili flakes. Was a big hit and I'll definitely make it again!

This recipe is a good weeknight staple that I have in the regular rotation. Neither my partner nor I are vegetarian, but this is one tofu recipe he will eat without complaint. NB: It's not actually very spicy, so you might be disappointed going in with that expectation. I usually serve it with the mango quinoa recipe you can find on this site.

This recipe was a great hit. Even I, who really dislike tofu, found it good. I made it with some of the alterations listed by another reviewer: coated the tofu with cornstarch and fried before I stir-fried it and added brown sugar. Instead of scallions I used white onions. I didn't have spinach and subbed a few green beans I happened to have in the freezer. I also added precooked egg noodles at the end, as another reviewer suggested. Left out the peanuts and used dried basil instead of fresh. Oh yes, and I used peanut oil instead of olive and far less than 1/3 cup. The result probably didn't taste much like the original recipe, but it was a hit nonetheless.

Rating: 3
this recipe could use more garlic. i also added sesame oil and fresh cilantro. the peanuts make it complete. i will definitely make this again! ***also, i only used about 1/8 cup of olive oil. to make the tofu firmer/chewier i pressed the water out between heavy pots for a while and then kept it in the freezer while i was preparing everything else.

This was pretty good. As other reviewers have noted, 1/3 cup oil is way more than you need. It was very quick to prepare (after getting everything chopped and prepped). Add rice, pasta, noodles, etc., to fill out as a main-dish meal. I'll definitely make it again.

Has become one of the family favorites. Each time I make it, I change it up a bit. Use regular onions instead of green, whatever nuts I have on hand (cashews, unsalted peanuts, etc.). Great "light" dinner, cooks up quickly and you don't feel guilty if you end up eating at 8:00 p.m.

Rating: 4
One of my favorites. I get a better result if I prepare the (extra firm) tofu first. I salt it, let it sit on paper towells for about ten minutes and then stir fry and set aside.

Like several of the reviewers here, I played around with the recipe and found it quite tasty. I agree that it is not "authentic" Thai, but it was good nonetheless. I used vegetable oil instead of olive (and way less than 1/3 c), I also reduced the amount of soy sauce and used some fish sauce as well. Be generous with the ginger and garlic as those flavours come out the most in the tofu.

Rating: 2
This was ok, just not a lot of flavor. It needed more garlic or ginger or something. Also, the tofu all kind of fell apart and it became more of a tofu scramble than a stir-fry.

I would call this "Thai-inspired" rather than genuinely Thai, but it was great...with quite a few changes. I used a mixture of peanut & vegetable oil instead of olive oil (olive oil is certainly not common in Thai food), added 3 Tbsp fish sauce, reduced the soy sauce to 2 Tbsp, used Thai chilies instead of crushed red pepper, and added about a tablespoon of brown sugar. I also added about 1/4 Cup water to make it more saucy, and coated the tofu in cornstarch & fried it prior to adding to the stir fry (this thickens the sauce a bit and also allows more of the great flavor of the sauce to adhere to the tofu). By the time I was done with it, it wasn't really the same recipe, but what I ended up with was great.

Made this tonight. Easy to make. The prep work actually takes the most time. The cooking time is about 5 minutes. Big hit. Extra firm tofu makes the difference. Went about 3/4 of a tsp of crushed red pepper and it had just the right zing.

Really good thai flavors... Next time I'll try chicken instead, the tofu was not great (usually when I stir fry tofu I dry it completely, coat it in a little corn starch then fry it first, right after the aromatics, then I remove it before adding the veggies. I didn't do that with this recipe, but it might be worth trying this method if you want crispier tofu).

I made this last night and was surprised how tasty is was. I have Thai basil growing in my garden so I used that instead of regular basil and I added an extra clove or two of garlic, but other than that made it per recipe (unusual for me). I served this with brown rice and a green salad. I don't know if I'd call this a 15- minute meal unless you're very proficient with a knife, but even with prep and cook time it only took about half an hour. I will make this again. It's a nice change for a meatless meal.

This is good enough, but not great. It's flavors aren't particularly Thai. If the ingredients are on hand, go ahead and make this. It's not worth going out of one's way to make it.
