These are nice and tasty. I took others advice and use 1.5 C flour. Perfect. For fun, once some batter is in the mold, stick a little chunk of dark chocolate. Cook same length of time. Cool, then serve with a scoop of mint choco chip ice cream. Oh heaven.

These came out very well. Only difference, I used the zest of two oranges instead of lemons and used 1.5 cups of flour instead of the 1.75 cups in the recipe. Baked for 15 minutes. And made about 30 cookies. Very fluffy, cakey feel. Wonderful with a nice cup of tea and milk.

result -- incredibly dense hockey puck; not much lemon to speak of either

I was a little disappointed with the result. I find the cake was a bit dry perhaps I should reduced amount of flour as suggested in one of the reviews.

Although the taste was very good, I have to agree with the reviewer from St. Thomas, VI that they were a little dense for me also. I will try to reduce the flour as suggested. My bake time was 9 minutes using my convection oven.

Absolutely wonderful. All the proportions in the recipe are perfect. I have been making these over and over again, and they barely last a day. Try dipping them in tea or coffee.

I was very pleased with this recipe, but found that the Madeleines became more dense than I like once cooled. I therefore reduced the flour to 1 1/2 cups, and substituted cake flour for regular flour. Additionally, they were too sweet for my taste, so I reduced the sugar, and lemon zest, by about half, and added a half-teaspoon of salt.

This was the exact madeleine recipe I was looking for. The raised madeleine like you get in France. Patricia Wells knows France!!!
