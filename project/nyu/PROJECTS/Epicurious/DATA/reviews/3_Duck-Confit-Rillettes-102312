This dish is wholly dependent on the quality of your ingredients and how well you made the confit. A classic treatment.

Having only the blander frozen duck from Safeway to work with, we seasoned our confit for two days in the fridge and liberally applied herbs de Provence. This produced a much more robust confit and rillettes that could stand up to lots and lots of black pepper in the final mix. Our dinner guests loved it. Spare no pepper and have plenty of spirit on hand!
