Cook the chicken first, remove and keep warm, then make the sauce in the same pan. We liked this sauce very much, will try to increase by at least a third the next time.

This recipe is simply delicious. My husband, who NEVER raves about food, flipped over it. Of course, I substituted Smart Balance for butter, and I had to use dried tarragon and parsley because we had it handy, but this was THE BEST chicken cutlet recipe I ever tried and will make it again and again.

for chicken we cut up a small fryer and used boneless breasts, pounded to half thickness. followed smart advice to add garlic and prepare sauce in same pan as chicken. after sauce was done, we poured out and reheated chicken quickly. served with steamed asparagus and cherry tomato. nice easy, elegant meal!

Good and simple - you'll get more flavor if you saute the chicken until golden, remove it, and make the sauce in the same pan. Add a little garlic with the shallots, and it will be lovely.

I found this pretty dull. Everyone was satisfied, but no one wanted me to go out of my way to make it again.

This is wonderful. I love tarragon and this dish makes it a feature without being overwhelming. The sauce is luxurious but not excessively rich. Nice enough for a dinner party, easy enough for a quick supper.

Good and easy. I prefer my chicken tarragon with a cream sauce, but this was a very good alternative.

This recipe was super easy and delicious to boot! I too paired it with plain veggies and had plenty of extra time to make a fancy dessert since this could be done at the last minute! I'll definately make it again.

What a treat to find something so simple to prepare that tastes so good !To make up for all the butter I served it with several fairly plain veggies.

Very light tasting dish, quick to prepare for a weeknight and very elegant. Despite the delicate flavors, 1/2 stick is a lot of butter. I will make it again but decrease the butter and see if I can substitute FF low sodium chicken broth for a healthier but similar dish.

I really liked this recipe! AND I had an extra brest left over, so I cut it up and served it to my father, my brother, and the cable guy who was here (I cooked it for my girlfriend and I and they all kind of showed up haha) and they all loved it! It was very fast, and very easy, and it tasted great on my first try! I will be making this again!

We really like this one. Its simple and one of the recipes that still works without wine (use good quality grape juice instead).

Loved, loved, LOVED this dish. All recipes should be like this: easy and quick to make, made the kitchen smell great, and my guests couldn't stop raving about it. It even heated up well for left-overs the next day.

On the side of below average. Tasted like chicken with butter poured over it.

I have always adored tarragon. It went out of fashion for a while; I am pleased to help in its revival. I have used this recipe for entertaining three times now - each time very well received. Once I grilled the breasts and made the sauce separately. This worked equally well. I have used both yellow and red tomatoes-on-the-vine. Grilled raddichio with a little parmesan is a great accompaniment. I preceded this course with another old favourite - a pesto spaghetti starter. The simplicity does not take one away from guests too long, but allows a freshly prepared main course. Perfect summer fare.

this was one of the fastest dishes i've made in a while. i didn't plan on making this ahead of time so i didn't have any fresh tarragon, but even with dried tarragon it was great. i crushed up the dried herbs in my fingers before adding them, helps increase the flavor and makes your hands smell great. it seems that you could put this sauce on fish also.

Delicious. I added a pinch of sugar to off-set the tartness of the lemon. Definitely a nice weeknight dish.

Delicious. This recipe was simple to make. The tarragon gave it a wonderful flavor. Fresh herbs make the difference. I served it with steamed carrots and mashed potatoes.

Very tasty. I added a couple of cloves of crushed garlic and added a splash of heavy cream to the sauce right before serving -- gave it a little body. I wouldn't bother making this without fresh tarragon. Served with Orzo Pilaf with Mushrooms (also from this site) and didn't have the leftovers I was counting on for my lunch the next day!

Nothing special.

Delicious. I was a little hesitant, since my husband is not a big fan of tarragon, but I've never used fresh before. It was a huge hit. Instead of cutlets, I used the tenderloins trimmed from chicken breasts and pressed thin. I replaced half the butter with Olivio spread. My kids didn't eat the sauce, but were excited to have "chicken fingers" for dinner. I served it with orzo, which was a lovely accompaniment.

Absolutely delicious! The lemon and shallots really complement the tarragon and all are a perfect accompaniment to the chicken. I would recommend cooking the chicken longer than stated here - maybe 5 to 10 minutes total (depending on the size and thickness of your cutlets).

This was great! Only thing I added was a small clove of garlic - would also add some 'shrooms, too. Had left over chicken - for lemon-caper chicken - and butter. Will put some of that on fresh caught fluke! Served with rice pilaf - Definately will make again!

This got a rousing "ok" from the guys. They prefer the full cream Jaques Pepin tarragon chicken recipe. So do I

OK-not good enough that I would make again.

A couple tips I'll use in the future: Add garlic and DEFINITELY use fresh tarragon; the dried I used made the sauce like a paste.

This sauce is so versitile and the recipe was so well written that it's impossible to screw up. I used fresh rosemary the first time because it was all I had on hand, another time used fresh tarragon. i can imagine all sorts of varriations of this....YUM!

This was quick, easy and even my little ones (under 6) liked it. It also keeps well if dinner is delayed. I served it with just a green salad and everyone was satisfied.

This was soooo easy and had great flavor. I used tarragon to taste and it was great. I would definetly make this again.

this recipe was wonderful. Like another reviewer, had to use dried tarragon. I also had to use regular onions so, I added just a touch of garlic. This was just wonderful. Will make this for guests. Loved the ease of fixing.

Delicious and easy. Used skinless boneless thighs, and dried (gasp!) tarragon and it was still great.

I made this over the weekend and loved it! Since I'm a mushroom fan, I sauteed a couple of thinly-sliced mushroom caps while I was cooking the shallots. Otherwise, made the recipe as per directions. The only thing I'd change is to slightly decrease the amount of lemon juice: I love lemon, but using the amount specified to me emphasized the lemon flavor too much....would rather have a slightly more subtle flavor.

I made this recipe using only two chicken breasts and a little less butter and no parsley. Absolutely wonderful! I look forward to making it again soon for dinner guests.

Receipe has a nice subtle flavor for tarragon lovers. I would decrease the amount of chicken or increase the amount of tarragon butter sauce. Even substituted dried tarragon when our garden did not produce 1/4 cup.

I made this last night for diner with only 1Lb. of chicken and the full amount of the sauce recipe. I left out the parsley and added a good shot (1 to 2 tablespoons) of Pernod to the wine. This was truly excellent ! Great flavors!

Wonderful recipe for boring old boneless skinless chicken breasts! Very moist and tasty. Made the recipe to the T except that I halved the amount of chicken(and S&P for it) which made the original sauce amount perfect.

The taragon flavor was a bit too strong for me. I think next time I would add less taragon and add chives instead. Otherwise the chicken was delicious. I put the leftovers in a spinach salad and it turned out quite tasty.

This was excellent and very quick. On its own I thought it was a little sharp, but I made served it over mashed potatoes, and it was perfect. (I doubled the sauce so there would be more to spoon over the potatoes.)
