I doubled the recipe and baked in two 8x8x2 pans. There weren't enough batter to fill both pans. The brownies came out very sadly thin. I followed the recipe very closely and am. Very experienced baker. If I was to make this again, I'd double he recipe but use only one pan. Very disappointed with my brownies.

This is one of my favorite dessert recipes and the brownies always go very quickly, especially at Christmas. I always replace the pecans with semi- or bittersweet chocolate chips and reduce the sugar by half so they are not too sweet. Another variation is to use dark chocolate chips and dark chocolate ganache -- always well received now that dark chocolate is so popular!

I just made these brownies for the first time and they are wonderful! I 1 1/2 the recipe for the brownie and used a 9X13 pan. I also doubled the minty frosting recipe and chocolate topping. Next time I will add more unsweetened chocoate to the actual brownie part. 3 oz didn't seem like quite enough. These are best in the refrigerator or freezer.

Of the three desserts I made for Christmas, this was the favorite, hands down. I left out the pecans.

Minty goodness with chocolate AND buttercream frosting....YUM! I also made these for a school function and am now making the second batch because the first didn't make it to school! Easy and home made. My kind of recipe!

this recipe was great and the comments were very helpful. i didn't find the brownies too minty at all, but i did add just a little extra sugar to the brownie itself, and made 1 1/2 times the mint frosting. i also doubled the recipe for a 9 x 13 pan (worked out very well). i kept these in the fridge and definitely preferred eating them chilled rather than room temperature.

I absolutely love this recipe. Here's the key. I double the unsweetened chocolate to 4oz. And then I make 1 1/2 recipes to make it in a 9x12 pan. This makes a better thicker brownie. I have always had a very hard time getting this brownie out so now I line the pan with foil and butter and flour it and there is never a problem. I also freeze these. This is one of my trademark recipes. I also triple the peppermint in both the brownie and the topping! This is an absolute WINNER! No need to double the sugar topping, just carefully spread it when the batter is slightly warm. A fabulous recipe.

I loved these - very easy to make and tasty. I increased the amount of the filling as suggested, but to be honest found it a bit too sweet. I will make these again for sure, but will keep to the original recipe.

Although I liked the mint flavor of this brownie, I prefer my brownie texture a little more on the fudgy side than the cakey/crumbly side. Nonetheless a good recipe though.

Rating: 2
These are good but have an extremely dense flavor. Don't make these to cure a sugar craving, because the unsweetened chocolate is pretty strong. I'd add extra sugar and bake longer next time - the texture was crumbly and they fell apart easily. Tasted good with a tall cold glass of milk, though.

These are awesome! I doubled the mint frosting and I didn't use the nuts. Yum, yum, yum!!

I forgot to mention in my earlier review that I omitted the pecans, too. I didn't think nuts would work well with the mint. These brownies were perfect without the nuts and with the slight modifications mentioned in my previous review. Yum!

I made these for Christmas dinner yesterday, and they were a huge hit. Like some other reviewers, I made 1 1/2 times the mint frosting, which was the perfect amount. I also modified the ganache, using 5 ounces of dark chocolate and 1/2 cup of heavy cream. Just chop the chocolate, put it in a glass bowl, bring your cream to a simmer and pour it over the chocolate in the bowl. Let sit 1 minute, then stir until smooth (omit the butter altogether). I let the ganache cool slightly before pouring it over the chilled brownies so I wouldn't melt the mint topping. Adding a small amount of green food coloring to the mint topping made it look festive for the holidays. They're rich, so you can cut them into 1-inch squares and they're a decadent treat.

Excellent brownie; increasing mint frosting by 1/2 was perfect. Next time I will add some cream to the chocolate topping to make it a little softer.

These are awesome! I too increased the filling by 1/2 and added green food coloring. I made them on Valentine's Day and tinted the filling red. My husband, six year old son and I are crazy about mint flavored recipes and this is one of the best!

These are fantastic! I also doubled the whole thing and used a 13 x 9 pan and they were perfect. I agree with previous reviewers that the mint filling needs to be increased: I made 1-1/2 times the recipe and it was just right. (6 T. butter; 3 cups powdered sugar, 3 T whole milk, etc) I think doubling it may make it squish out more when you cut them. You can also use bittersweet chocolate for the topping if you don't have semisweet. I used Trader Joe's Belgian bittersweet. Yummy!

Rating: 4
I agree that doubling the mint topping is a must. I also added green food coloring to the mint topping, and mixed all the brownie ingredients in one pot instead of creaming the sugar and eggs separately. This resulted in a rich, fudgy brownie(and fewer dishes to wash). They were a big hit at work.

Rating: 4
These brownies were a hit with everyone who tried them. They are really rich, so when I doubled the recipe to fill a 9x13 pan, I cut 16 brownies. I also left out the pecans and added a couple drops of green food coloring to the mint frosting to make it look more minty. Next time I make this, I would also double the mint frosting because as is it only makes a very thin layer in the brownie, and I think it would profit from more frosting!

These are great brownies. They are not too cakey, not too dense either. And the mintiness is wonderful. I ran out of semisweet so I used bittersweet as the icing.

These brownies were a hit at a recent party I had. My roommate and I uncontrollably went back multiple times b/c the taste was so sensational! These brownies are an awesome treat! A great choice instead of traditional double chocolate.

These went very quickly...wouldn't add any chocolate chips to the brownie batter, and would try more melted chocolate and peppermint extract to the batter. There's another brownie recipe I prefer on this site, but these were gobbled up nevertheless, and look real nice.

These brownies are awesome! I've made them several times and each time I get rave reviews. They're easy to make and go well with a simple or elegant dinner. I did cut the peppermint extract to 1/4 tsp in the brownie. Definitely try this recipe!

These were delicious! I don't know why people complain about the amount of mint- I even added a bit extra. Green food coloring in the mint topping made it cute, as well as only drizzling the chocolate on top. The nuts did not take away from the flavour at all. mmm, think i'll go make more now...

My only concern with these brownies is that the mint in both brownies and the topping is overwhelming. Also, no nuts or other "extras" should be added. The take away from the mint and confuse the taste!

I'm only 9 years old and I made these brownies with the help of my Aunt. They were very good, but we changed a few things. We didn't use any of the peppermint for the topping and we didn't use nuts. Our family tried them and they all said they were definately "4 forks". The best ever! We'll make these often.

this recipe is one of my favorites. it is so simple to make, and both of my sons loved it.

While these brownies were good, they were just too minty. Next time, I will leave the peppermint extract out of the brownie batter. Since I made these in a 9" square pan, there wasn't enough of the toppings to go around. Next time I will double the mint and chocolate toppings.

Rating: 4
I have a very similar recipe that I make but instead of the peppermint extract in the frosting I use 1/4C creme de menthe and 1/4C half & half. This both eliminates the spreading problem and there is no need to add green food coloring. Plus, it tastes great!

I doubled the brownie recipe, did 1-1/2 times the frosting and kept the chocolate recipe the same (because I drizzled it) and used two 8x8 pans. Turned out perfect! (You may want to start checking for doneness after 20 min. or so. I checked at 25 min. and got them out just in time.)I, too, had trouble spreading the frosting at first, but found that if I let it sit on the brownies for a minute, the butter softened quite a bit, which made the frosting much easier to spread. Spreading it with the back of a spoon was more effective than using my spreading knife. I refrigerated the brownies in the pan between frosting and drizzling, then refrigerated again after drizzling. Had no problem getting them out of the pan when I was ready to serve them. I made no ingredient changes, and the brownies were fabulous. What a difference versus boxed brownie mix! I always think of brownies as a (somewhat boring) kid dessert. I wouldn't hesitate to serve these to adults!

These were delicious! The brownie was nice and fudgy and with the frosting they were amazing. I too found that the frosting was made more spreadable with the addition of some heavy cream.

If you like chocolate mint, these are fabulous. For a more dramatic presentation, I tinted the mint frosting a very light green, and then I drizzled the chocolate over it. They were gorgeous. This is a very easy recipe to double and cook in a 9x13" pan (you will have leftover chocolate frosting if you drizzle it, so you don't have to double it).

Connecticut, you probably need to thin your white icing a little so it will spread easier. Add a few drops at a time of cream or milk until it is thin enough to spread easily. I probably won't take very much additional liquid.

Rating: 3
Did anyone else have the trouble I did, spreading the white icing layer over the brownies? The brownies were still warm but I had a lot of difficulty spreading the icing evenly without picking up crumbs. The more I tried, the worse it got and I ended up with thin patches and much more heavily covered bits. The chocolate was slightly easier to spread but no way could it be 'poured' - way too thick. Because of this, I probably wouldn't bother to make these again, even though the brownie part was very easy to make and the end result was very good.

Wow! I doubled the amount of peppermint extract in both the brownie and topping portion. Yesterday when I made it and then tried them I thought it was too much mint, but today after they have sat in the fridge overnight...WOW!! They literally taste like a Girl Scout Thin Mint cookie. YUM!!

I've made this twice, both times without the nuts (personal preference). Both times I got rave reviews. My only suggestions is to line the pan with foil to help lift them out of the pan. I always destroy the chocolate topping when I cut them, so pulling it out of the tray to cut on a cutting board makes it easier.

I've made this recipe twice and both times they have been devourered. The first time I had trouble getting them out of the pain without destroying them, but discovered it helps a lot to use a sharp knife dipped in hot water to cut through the chilled brownies.

Out of three brownie recipes I made from the Epicurious list, this rated #2 from my co-workers at work. The brownies were beautiful with the dark chocolate glaze covering up the snow white mint layer...and below, the chocolate brownie itself, laced with pecans was moist, chewy and chocolately. I'd definately make these again!
