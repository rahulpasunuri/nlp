Used one clove of fresh garlic; did not cook it. Stirred in 1/2 c. of plain Greek yogurt at the end to lighten it. The finished dip was creamy and light.

Love this! I added more lime juice and cilantro. Always a big hit!

I love this dip! I did add 4 cloves of garlic, spicy italian dipping oil (instead of just olive oil), and 4-5 dashes of Tabasco and it rocks! Even my 13 year old daughter loves it!

Very bland dip, disappointing even after jazzing it up with more garlic, lime juice, ginger, jalepeno, green onion and cayenne pepper. Prefer taste of plain edamame to this.

Didn't have any cilantro. Added juice of a whole lime, bit of lemon juice, crushed chili peppers, and ginger. Tastes great, a bit bland but a good base to be creative!

This was not a bad dish, but it was a little bland. I would maybe add more garlic or shallots next time.

Wonderful starter.

Yum! This was my first time cooking with edamame, and I love this dip. I did increase the garlic and cilantro. It also made a great work lunch with triscuits and veggies for dipping.

Definitly needed the added garlic, cilantro, salt and lime of other suggestions. I would suggest adding some jalapeno in with the edamame, and then let it sit in the fridge overnight to let the flavours blend.

I was very interested based on the reviews, but was disapointed with the final product. I took that advice of the other reviewers and added more lime and garlic, but neither addressed the basic boredom of the flavor.

I used this recipe for a very modern, health conscious event that I catered. The client wanted fresh, healthy, protien rich foods with low fat and carbs. At first people steered away from it because they thought it was guacamole. When word got around that it was edamame dip, everyone started raving! I did add more lime juice and garlic, and it was a huge hit. People request it at many of my events.

I brought this to a party and everyone LOVED it. It tasted creamy, even though there was no sour cream/mayo, etc. I added more garlic/lime juice and cilantro than the recipe called for.

Wow! I can't believe my interpretation of this recipe was so different than the other reviewers! I really liked this dip a lot! Yes, it is a bit labor intensive (just tedious, not difficult), but the result is something that's great tasting & healthy! Most dips are fatty & highly caloric. This is a great option for something protein-rich that also has great flavor. I would definitely make it again -- especially because my guests really liked it!

So boring! I would never make this again. Was embarrassed when I took to a party that I was to bring an appetizer to. Yikes!

Bland, tasteless and did nothing to compliment the tastes and textures of the crudite.

This was a fabulous recipe! I was afraid it might be a little bland so I went a little heavy (by about 50%) on garlic, lime juice and cilantro (you can never have enough cilantro!) Purchased pre-cooked edamame in the pods (thats what I get for sending my husband to the store) so I had to shell them but I went ahead with the cooking of them anyway- I didn't use the whole 3/4 cup of cooking liquid and the texture was wonderful- There is no need to wash the saucepan and re-use it to saute the garlic- just use a small saute pan for the garlic- it went great with the carrots, also sweet red pepper and snow peas, but I wouldn't bother with the cuke or celery- It would also be great on good quality crackers- This is a healthy (albeit heavy on the sodium), light, fresh tasting and all-around delicious hors d'ouevres and I will make it again and again!!

I used pre-cooked edamame and substituted water for cooked broth. The consistency isn't really like that of a dip, but flavor is great. I think this list of ingredients could be the basis of a great soup dish.

The lead-in states "a smart alternative to fussy holiday hors d'oeuvres". This recipe is fussy enough. It requires a saucepan (used, cleaned, and re-used), a food processor, and considerable preparation time, resulting in an unattractive green mush with very little flavor. It was the only dud on my Thanksgiving day menu. I won't make it again.
