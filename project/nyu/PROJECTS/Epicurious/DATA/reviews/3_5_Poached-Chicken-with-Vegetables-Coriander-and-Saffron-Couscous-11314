Perhaps I didn't simmer it at the right temperature, but my chicken came out tough. I also didn't think it was flavorful enough to justify the chopping.

Absolutely delicious! I made this recipe almost exactly as written except I used fresh ginger and some extra garlic. To save on chopping I minced them together in my mini-chop and did the parsley & coriander in my big food processor. I also added a few golden raisins with the zucchini as I like them in a couscous vegetable mix. The vegetables had alot of broth in the end, so I drained off about 1/2 cup of this and used it as the base for my couscous broth. Since it already had saffron and seasoning it saved all the messing around at the end. This is a definite keeper: the flavors are defined, not assertive. I passed some harissa for those who wanted to spice their's up at the table.

I made the couscous to accompany a lamb dish. While I love saffron, the couscous fell flat in comparison. Maybe I should have used more saffron but I think the chicken stock overpowered the dish.

Excellent recipe and a good portion for two people. We found it a bit salty, next time will make the couscous with water only, no broth to cut down on the salt. Otherwise a keeper! Fresh cilantro adds a nice flavour, add JUST before serving.

Delicious and light. It is meant to be soupy. I used fresh ginger because i didn't have ground and it worked well. Will definitely make this again.

This was a great meal. Very easy and wasn't heavy so I didn't feel too full after eating. I made extra couscous and heated it up for brunch the next day, topped with 2 eggs over easy. Mmm.

This was an excellent meal, and very simple to prepare despite the long list of ingredients. I don't think it would suffer too much if you omitted the saffron. I omitted the olives and used fresh ginger in addition to the ground, and it still came out very mildly flavored. It is a very mild dish to begin with, but the flavors are complex and lovely.

This was pretty good. I would definitely go with a low sodium chicken broth, though. It came out a little salty.

Tasty but rather a lot of chopping to get there...we enjoyed it but I don't know if I would bother with it again - though it does make me more interested in poaching.

This dish was awesome! The "sauce" is really broth - that is how it is supposed to be. A thick sauce would not be good here. Use good quality chicken stock (home made or bullion -- definitely not canned chicken broth. That and the saffron will flavor the vegetables and couscous very nicely. I added a couple of chopped dates (organic medjool dates from israel - they melted right into the broth and vegetables)and way more cilantro and parsley than what was called for (about one cup) and no ginger (except fresh ginger to marinade the chicken). I did not poach the chicken but grilled it instead. So, only the vegetables were poached. I also grilled some cherry tomatoes and seved them on top of the couscous and vegetables. excellent!

The dish was so-so. I thought that the sauce would be thicker. Although I don't think I'll make it again, if I did I would use fresh ginger instead of ground. I would also use less water for the couscous. It was definitely too watery. I served roasted asparagus with the dish.

I thought this was delicious! The chicken was so tender and really absorbed the ginger flavor nicely. I used fresh ginger and rubbed the chicken down about an hour before cooking - plenty of time since it was fresh ginger.

Fantastic! And not too difficult. A complete success.

It was ok, not great. I don't think that I would make it again.

This is a great dish. I used fresh ginger, and substituted frozen peas for zuchinni. I ignored the cous-cous recipe and used a mix with wild mushrooms. I shredded the chicken and left it in the poaching liquid and thickened it with Wondra flower. It's a keeper.

Really good overall, but I personally will add more garlic next time. Just a matter of taste there, otherwise it's very flavorful and surprisingly easy to make.

I agree with the other cooks who thought this was a fabulous dish. It was beautifully seasoned, and obviously was carefully thought-out. Boy, I certainly would make it again!

I made it with thighs, but I would do it with breasts next time. It didn't seem too interesting to me when I was done cooking it, so I used some of the poaching liquid to make a gravy by reducing it a littl,e adding a very tablespoons of cream and some cream of tartar. Then it became an interesting chicken supreme. It was "beige food" with a nice kick.

This was an amazing meal. I added merguez lamb sausage to it which enhanced that real morrocan flavors!

Excellent dish! Great combination of spices. Next time I'll use less water for the couscous - there was too much liquid and the it didn't absorb completely.

This chicken was delicious-so tender & moist. My only complaint with this recipe is that the zucchini turned out way too mushy. Next time I make it I'll add them later.

Let me tell you, this is exceptional! We like spicy, potent food, so I really didn't think this would be that great. It was flavorful and healthy! yum!
