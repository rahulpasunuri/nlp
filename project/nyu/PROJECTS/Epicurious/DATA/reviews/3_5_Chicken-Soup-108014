It was my first time to make chicken soup from scratch, and it turned out great! I used thighs for chicken parts and added egg noodles. It was easy, too: I made it after work for dinner the same night!

I followed the recipe using one whole chicken.I follwoed the suggestions and added 1 additional carrot and one additional turnip. Also, added the carcass to the broth. It came out great. I've made chicken soup many times before, but never used a whole chicken. .

Good recipe but not complete. And to thosew ho think that dill doesn't belong in real Jewish chickens oup, you don't have the slightest idea how to cook soup. Take this recipe which is good, add a rutabaga, a turnip, leek, and half a red pepper. Dill goes in the last 15 minutes. Cook for at least 2 hours. and you don't need a whole chicken unless you like the soup very fatty.

This is PERFECT chicken soup. Hailing from New York, and a shiksa who LOVES Jewish chicken soup, I can attest to this. I do admit that I cut a corner: I don't do parts and a whole chicken; I do a cut up whole chicken plus three thighs. But everything else in this recipe I'm faithful to. Uber Yum!

OMG this was delicious. This was good and I will definitely have to make it with all chicken instead of turkey broth and chicken pieces. I had left over turkey stock from Thanksgiving and used chicken thigh, shredded carrots, some dill, zucchini and broccoli. I added more dried dill and chopped some Italian parsley. I brown the chicken first and then included onions and broth.

Very good, simple chicken soup recipe. My suggestion is to double the vegetables (not the dill), add a quarter to a half bunch of parsley, and put the chicken back into the soup after cutting it up. Also, I served this with the thin little egg noodles in the bowl.

Very flavorful. I added extra veggies, 2 whole garlic cloves and put the carcass back in after removing the cooked meat. I used about 4 Tblspns dill - very authentic in Jewish chicken soup. A friend makes amazing chicken soup with dark meat and a veal bone - pure heaven! Will try next time.

Very flavorful. I doubled the veggies, added a couple of whole garlic cloves and put the carcass back in after removing the cooked meat. Also, I added about 3 Tbpns of dill - and dill is totally authentic in Jewish chicken soup. A close friend of mine makes the BEST chicken soup and she uses dark meat and a veal bone. Something to try next time!

Goy as charged. I pulled the chicken after 30 mins., let it cool, then removed the chicken and put the carcass back in. That seemed to fix the richness thing without bouillon.

I have a recipe for the Second Ave. Deli chicken soup and it called for chicken bones and a small piece of brisket to be added to the rest of the ingredients. It was a very rich soup and I hope to make it for the holidays. The difficulty is finding chicken bones.

"Memme" (my grandma) and her friend Ms. Feitelson of Bauska, Latvia must be doing a gazillion RPMs in their graves. Classic chicken soup has the following ingredients: chicken parts (backs, necks), carrots, rice, peppercorns, kosher salt and a bay leaf or two. (The bay leaf is removed at the end of the process.) If I need to tell you how long to cook this, just buy whatever is ready made. As for the 2nd Ave Recipe: sorry, but that's a goyishe recipe. Dill???

This is a good starting recipe - it has all the basics. Which is to say, it resembles the recipe I inherited from my mother. For greater flavor I would probably double most of the vegetables, except the dill. Dill is absolutely required for delicious chicken soup, but a whole bunch is too much. I typically use about 1/2 a bunch. The information about an old hen, chicken feet, free range, slow grown is all to the good: standard brand chicken that you find in American supermarkets is just too bland to add much rich flavor. The flavor has been bred out. There is usually an old hen or "soup chicken" available - look for those and for the extra bits, feet, etc. The goal is to add flavor to the soup. The other glaring error for me in this recipe is the cooking time. Good chicken soup takes time. It's not something to throw together just before you are ready to eat: it has to be simmered for at least 3 hours or so. Don't be too rigid about the 12 cups of water; get a big stockpot, fill it up with the ingredients and cook it down until it is rich and flavorful. If you wish, take chicken meat that you plan on making into chicken salad out at the 2 hour point and continue to simmer everything else for at least one more hour. Or longer. Add additional water as necessary. The goal is flavor, not speed. Adjust the spices (salt, pepper). I always add a touch - just a touch - of nutmeg into the pot. Cooked long enough the dill and nutmeg and bay - and garlic if you add it - meld together into the lovliest of savory flavors. You can't get to that flavor without the dill: it is crucial.

This is a great starter receipe, though, as everyone has already pointed out, you can certainly do things to spice it up more. But it really makes a nice, classic, simple bowl of chicken soup. It's hard to go totally wrong with something this basic. (PS thanks to the reviewer who suggested the 3-4 lb bird, that was helpful.)

Excellent and easy... if you're making soup for those who like more flavor (ie kids), throw in a chicken bouillon cube near the end just to pop up the flavor a little.

To all of you who use prepared chicken broth or stock: chicken soup takes about three hours to cook - if you cook it long enough, and season it correctly, you shouldn't _need_ the "extra flavor" of the store-bought stuff. Also, I hate to be obnoxious, but dill is an absolute necessity in "traditional" Jewish chicken soup. And as for the size of a the chicken - 3-4 pounds is pretty standard in my experience. Another thought on flavor: because it is salted in the kashering process, kosher chicken makes really good chicken soup. Also, in my experience, free-range chicken, especially "slow-grown" birds, also make more flavorful soup. I suspect that this recipe doesn't have enough ingredients in general - for example, where's the garlic?

It's tasty! It's a good base for Matzoh Ball soup as well... if you like more flavor, throw in a bouillon cube or two (or three or four), it does't compete, just makes it a little more bold.

As a professional chef I agree that dill us usually included in good chicken soup recipes but very sparingly - it is a strong herb. The beauty of chicken soup is to play around with it to your taste. If you like dill-use it! If you don't like it , then don't but if you want a traditional, classic soup, a bit of dill is usually added as in most eastern and western european versions where is where the soup originated in it's present form. This is a good basis to start with some moderations and then use what you like.

I sure wish that the Second Ave Deli followed their own recipe - they leave the dill in and it is just awful. Also, dill is NOT a requirement for "classic chicken soup". What gall! This recipe is very bland - and I like baby food! I would call it the beginning of a chicken soup. As it is, I wouldn't have the nerve to serve it to anybody I call a friend.

Dill is ALWAYS used in classic chicken soup but not as much as called for in this recipe. So are chicken feet as stated below (gives great flavor as do necks if you can't find feet), simmer the soup slowly and skim off the solids that float to the top and if possible use an old hen - they give better flavor to soups. This is a very good basic recipe - keep trying and each chicken is different so make it more than once and taste and add and needed. I also suggest adding a whole clove of garlic, a whole turnip and a chicken bouillon cube for a boost. I use fresh parsley along with a few sprgs of dill-- NOT an entire bunch. An entire bunch is too much and would give too strong a dill flavor. Try a few sprigs at first along with several sprigs of fresh parsley. You can always add more after it cooks a while. Make sure there is enough salt and pepper and always start with COLD water. Never boil the soup. Start with cold water on a very low light and leave it there until it simmers slowly but doesn't boil. you will get a clearer broth in the end.

Dill should not exist in chicken soup.

This is an ok basic recipe, but i think here are some tips to make it better than just ok: 1. you have to skim the gook that rises to the top during cooking, especially right before the boil and at the beginning of the boil. otherwise it all goes back into the soup. 2. it sounds gross, but chicken feet really add another level of flavor to the soup - obviously they are taken out before serving. some people also use the head, but with the feet you can really have a perfect chicken soup. 3. use the yummy moist chicken for chicken salad, it is just the best.

Just made this recipe and added one can of Ro-Tel tomatoes with green chilis.Also added two small white potatos.Came out great and will make it again.

This is a great recipe to use as guideline (quantities, cooking times, basic ingredients etc.). My only criticism is the dill. It just doesn't seem to have much of a place in this dish unless you're trying to be especially exotic and want to mention in passing that "the recipe calls for dill!". Better yet, just omit it.

I used this recipe as a base. The one big change I made is to use 1/3 water and 2/3 fat free chicken broth for the 12 cups of water. That boosted the flavor a lot and it was a hit with the vegetarian matzo balls I made!

The chicken should be as big as you can fit in your biggest pot. :)

The recipe looks like a good way to make sure you end up with usable boiled chicken in addition to a nice soup. But, any guesses as to how big the "whole chicken" should be?
