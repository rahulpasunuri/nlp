I thought these were pretty tasty. I made my own roast beef and did not use lemon juice in the avocado. I thought the roast beef made enough texture for me. Nice dish to take to a picnic or serve for an afternoon party or shower.

I made these as whole sandwiches- they were delicious, though I used about half of the lemon juice. Otherwise, the avocado mix would have been too tart. This was a great way to use leftover roast beef!

Super simple, super tasty. Very popular item served at my tea brunch. Hubby thought they were fab. I did rough mash the avocado and left it a little chunky for texture. Flavor was lovely.

Perfect quick recipe for Ravinia Festival. Everyone enjoyed even the non-Avocado lovers.

The flavors in this are very good, but it's a little lacking in texture for my taste. I agree with a previous reviewer that I might leave the avocado a little chunky next time & maybe add some thing sliced radishes for crunch and zip.

Anyone know how far ahead these can be made? Stacked as noted with damp papertowels to keep from drying out...??

Nice sandwiches, it was all about the rare beef for me. The avocado comes out fairly tart, so think about adjusting lemon to taste.

I initially made this recipe for a 4th Of July picnic. It worked out so well that I've also used it for sack lunches for both the kids and myself and my husband. We always double the recipe, use exactly one pound of thinly sliced roast beef, and 12 Ciabatta rolls (sliced through the middle). All of this makes enough for two days of lunch for 5 people. Mmm...yummy!

This was tasty but I probably would not mash up the avocadoes so much the next time, or at least do a really rough mash. I will probably use the mashed mix as a dip in the future though, I ate the leftover dip (i only made 2 sandwiches) with some polenta corn chips we happened to buy at the store and thought that the avocado mix was very good and matched with chips. Better tasting than the powder guacamole dip you can make with avocados. Not only that, this mix only needed a few ingredients to make.

Delicious and I wouldn't change a thing. Of course, it doesn't have to be a finger sandwich. You can just put it between the ultra-thin pepperidge farm white bread and have a regular sandwich.
