The pie is a little dry. I could write a poem about it, but I'll spare everyone and leave it at that. A dry pie.

This pie is fab! The texture is wonderful and the flavors blend and melt in your mouth. Mixing cherries and apple? Never would have thought of such a thing but it tasted very good and its a great compliment getter.
