Great flavor. These are sinkers, and my family have always made floaters, so I have this idea in my mind that floaters are better. As sinkers go, these are great - not dense, great tender texture. So, did some research online about how to make floaters, intending to turn these pumped up flavored matzo balls into floaters. Lots of advice out there: some claim the secret to floaters is beating the egg whites separately then folding into the batter, some claim the soda water does it, some say just don't remove the lid from the pan when they are cooking. The most plausible (to me) seems to be the addition of baking powder, so next time I'll try that, and I'll let you know how it goes. If you are concerned about baking powder being kosher, check out online resources, there are solutions out there that work. One cook claims that the matzo ball mix contains baking powder, so there must be a way to keep kosher and use it. For me, I'll go for flavor and not worry about it.

My absolute favorite matzoh balls ever. So easy to make. I like a ton of flavor, so I added a few more scallions and more dill. I would suggest also adding salt. They were perfect and went great with the parsnip celery soup.

My first attempt at making matzo balls ever and they were a hit! I would use a little less DILL. delicious!

Tastes wonderful with the soup. I skipped the dill and the matza balls were still very flavorful.

Wow - best matzo balls any of us had tasted. Light and fluffy and very flavorful. I skipped the ginger and only had time to let sit in the fridge for about 2 hours, but they were fabulous nonetheless. My grandmother would have been proud.

Unfortunately, I had no seltzer of club soda on hand, and I didn't feel like running out to the store at 5 am, so I substituted two tablespoons of Diet Coke, and they still came out perfect! The homemade chicken noodle soup I added them to (6 Qts!), was gone by the end of the dinner! Everyone said they were by far, the best matzo balls they had ever tasted. :) Make these, you won't be disappointed!

substituted green garlic for the scallion and omitted the dill, great result.

This will be the fourth year that I've made these for passover. They are the most tender, savory matzo balls. The addition of dill and green onion sets these apart from regular matzo balls.

I just made these last night for Passover seder and they were a big hit. Definitely a nice tist on the traditional version!

My entire family loves these, even the 2 year old. I've substituted dried dill but prefer the fresh. I've also used chopped yellow onion. This was my first time making matzo balls and it's a world class taste.

I made this last night and we really loved it. I have never made matzo balls before so I was somewhat unsure of myself but this recipe was so easy it's hard to make a mistake. I cooked the matzo balls in chicken broth to which I added carrots, onions, celery, and parsnips. The green onion and dill were perfect compliments to the soup. I'll definitely make this again.

Delicious! Not at all time-consuming as matzo ball recipes go (no beating egg whites, etc.) Relatively light/fluffy, and tasty. I might cut down on the dill a little next time (the taste is very strong) but I'm a dill fan, and it goes well with chicken soup. A keeper.

A very good recipe indeed, but a little time consuming. Great even if you don't celebrate passover! If you're feeling up to it, you can make these as a snack for you or the kids.

My first attempt at making matzo balls from scratch was a triumphant success! They came out absolutely perfect, light and fluffy, and were a real crowd-pleaser to the Passover bunch. I am now completely cured of my "matzo ball phobia"!
