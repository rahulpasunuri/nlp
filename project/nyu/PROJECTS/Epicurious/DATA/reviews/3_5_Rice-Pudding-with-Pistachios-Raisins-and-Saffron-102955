Amazing flavor! I added 1/3 cup more rice to make the consistency more to my liking, and omitted the raisins. We love it! ***someone commented earlier that you can just skip the saffron- I would not skip it! I does add a very distinct flavor that is wonderful. Also, I used regular butter instead of Ghee. Enjoy!

The flavors in this dish are spectacular, however, I have tried making it three times and it has never set up properly; it is always too soupy. I am not sure what I am doing wrong; I always follow the recipe exactly. I have resorted to a more fool-proof rice pudding recipe, adding the saffron, cardamom and pistachios.

So good! I could eat an entire batch myself. Be sure to fish out the cardamom pods unless you want inedible mystery seeds in your pudding.

OK, I have to admit that I use a different recipe for the rice pudding part -- the one in the Cook's Illustrated Best Recipe cookbook is fabulous -- but I add the spices/pistachio/raisins from this recipe. Absolutely wonderful; I'm not a huge fan of traditional rice pudding, but this is ambrosia...

To the cook who "couldn't control the scorching...": the heat needs to be quite low, and you need to stir it *constantly*, not just "often" as the recipe suggests - otherwise, the milk "catches" at the bottom of the pan and burns.

I took this to an Indian themed dinner party. Only three people, of twelve, tried it. People are fearful of rice pudding-American style! Those brave souls complimented it happily. I had doubled the recipe and it's really a lot of work. Well, back at home, my husband and I have been very happy to have the leftovers! My husband explained it as at first interesting (because of the cardamom) and then you just want to keep going back and tasting it again and again.

A wonderful Indian rice pudding which has never failed me, and I serve it often. Left-overs will soak up all the liquid, but just spoon out as much rice mixture as needed, and stir in additional cream or milk. The consistency should be such that the top of the pudding is liquid with no rice showing, unlike western rice pudding which is much thicker.

I couldn't control the scorching of this dish because it cooks for so long. The saffron is unnecessary, it only adds color. The cardamom flavor is amazing. 1 cup of sugar was too sweet for my taste. Next time I'll try cooking it with only 2/3 sugar and leaving it more runny like it's served at Indian restaraunts.

I have made this several times -- try using a can of sweetened condensed milk instead of one of the quarts of milk; this reduces the time it takes to make this dish.

I made the entire menu for a dinner party in honor of a friend going to India. We loved this recipe. It did take longer than was suggested but the wait was worth it. It was even good the next day for breakfast.

Great South Asian dish. It took a bit longer than touted, but was worth it. It really put a fine finish to a curry dinner.
