I made these for a party to have some vegetarian nibbles. Interesting flavor combination, and very easy to make. Everyone loved them.

We found these to be very easy and quick to make. The flavors mix well and we added a little Fleur-de-sil. We did find that they cant stand alone and should be part of a couple of appetizers or as part of a Tapas menu.

Found this when I was desperate for an easy vegan appetizer - it is incredibly easy to make and the crowd really liked it - pairing apricots and almonds always gives a nice flavor - I would definitely make again.
