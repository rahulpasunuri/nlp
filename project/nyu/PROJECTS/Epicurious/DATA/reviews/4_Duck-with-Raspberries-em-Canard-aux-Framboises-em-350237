Wow - this one just didn't work for me. The duck came out over-done, having reached over 135 to 145 at the 20 minute point. Sauce, while flavorful, was thin. Just not worth the effort.

An amazing recipe that I keep coming back to for my boyfriend who is totally nuts about duck. Here's what I do differently: make just enough duck meat for two (about 1 lb duck breast), but make 8 servings of sauce (left over to be used later). Use only 1/4 cup raspberry vinegar rather than 1/3 like a previous reviewer recommended. The rasp. vin. is an expensive brand found at wholefoods which looked like it was on the sweeter side. Make sure to reduce the vinegar sauce enough. Skip the sauce-straining part. The demiglace, the More Than Gourmet brand, Demi Glace Gold (veal & beef stock), can be found at Whole Foods or Fairway--the size I got was less than $10. It's in concentrated form so I dilute it before using. Next time I'm going to try to totally cook the breast on the pan and not from pan to oven to broiler or whatever-- too confusing. I cook the meat medium rather than rare and it does not affect the juiciness or tenderness of the meat.

Wonderful change of pace for Christmas dinner. Found it cheaper by far to buy whole ducks and have them butchered. For the price of the pre-packaged,frozen breasts, I got fresh breasts, plus legs frozen for future confit and wings and necks/backs for a great stock. (Forget specialty -magret- ducks though....everyone in this area just carries "duck"....less lean variety allows for higher finished temperature) Lucky enough to find the D'Artangnan Demi-glacé at a specialty grocer (shipping costs would have put it out of reach). A good quality raspberry balsamic added the perfect amount of tartness to cut through the "fattiness" of the duck.

Amazingly simple and superbly delicious. Splurge on the demi-glace and be sure to reduce the sauce a bit. Side note - We added figs to the sauce because they are so delicious and in season at the moment. Loved it!!

As 4 duck breast would have cost me $56, and I was only cooking for my husband and 2 kids, I skipped the breast and did duck legs @ a fraction of the cost. 2 duck legs were about $6. I shortened the cook time (still following the internal temp- about 15 minutes- and broiling time). O/w made the same. Kids and husband loved it... and so did my wallet! Will make again. Sauce is good for many adventures.

I made this for an anniversary dinner. The sauce is deceptively simple, but it wouldn't work without the demi-glace. I used a tub of Demi-Glace Gold that you may be able to find at the grocery store or online. You have to reconstitute it with water. I also used white balsamic and found out at the last minute that we were out of butter. This sauce was delicious and I think it would pair well with other proteins... pork, chicken, perhaps even venison. Expensive, but worth it.

This is a truly spectacular dish! I roasted a whole duck for presenation (time intensive but rewarding) and served the sauce on the side. I wouldn't change a thing, next time I'll probably just do the breasts. It's a bit elaborate for a weeknight, but if you're looking to floor dinner guests or a boyfriend on his birthday (in my case) this is a great way to do it. I can't wait to have this again.

An excellent recipe, I highly recommend using the Duck and Veal Demi-Glace from D'Artagnan, it's only $4.99 for a 6.5 oz. size on their web-site... and sear in cast-iron skillet on stove top and then crisp skin in broiler right before serving.

Having the good fortune of finding family in France, I vowed, during my visit last year, to cook for them when the moment seemed right. Planning to make a roasted duck, I panicked slightly when all I could find was sliced duck breast! This recipe saved me, although I did prep 24 hours in advance with a marinade of water, brandy, salt and garlic cloves. The fat, sugar and vinegar combo was a debacle on first run through. I ended up, instead, with a side of reduced red wine, demi-glace, fat and pinch of sugar as a plate dressing. The amazing raspberries were left virginal until consumed - yum!

Forgot to mention I used alot less vinegar than recommended, and be careful, as easy to overcook.

I am a little surprised that this easy recipe hasn't received more reviews. Must be the demi-glace! I couldn't bring myself to pay $30 for demi-glace so bought $6 worth of veal bones and made my own. very easy but takes hours of unattended simmering. Used 8-10 oz duck breasts. There is alot of fat so you need more weight than you would think. I used fresh Lac Brome Lake duck breast that were excellent. Procured thru Mayflower Poultry in Cambridge MA.

Okay, I cooked this on New Year's so maybe the prosecco was getting to me, but in case any if you are as dumb as me, you will want this recipe to state heat the pan up to 400, then cook the duck in the hot pan only---i.e. not in the oven at 400 for 20 minutes. I know that duck needs a low heat but I was thrown by the way this recipe was written--and I have multiple degrees, but apparently I still can understand nuance. Anyhow, the sauce was delicious, and I served it with panfried potato cakes. I will make this again, properly.--or confit with all my fat!

This was a recipe I made for our girls gourmet club night.. it was amazing! I used white balsamic vinager and got demi glace from a good butcher shop for only $8. Will add this to the list of special dishes

I made the sauce to accompany a whole roast duckling as the raspberries seemed a fresh take for duck sauce. I found this sauce recipe calls for too much vinegar. I would suggest 1/4 cup raspberry vinegar and make sure to use a fine one that is on the sweet side.

I made this for a group of 4 last night, and the only difference was that we used one whole duck instead of all breasts, and I cut up and deboned the duck myself. The raspberry sauce was absolutely perfect, and everyone was incredibly impressed with the result. Demi-glace is very expensive ($29 for 10.5oz at Williams-Sonoma) to purchase so it is not a recipe I would make often, but it was fantastic.

Really great duck recipe. And so easy (which you would never guess when eating). The sauce is a bright and tasty complement to the rich meat flavors of the duck. This is the best duck recipe I've made (beats the duck with cherry sauce and duck with lingonberry sauce, both of which are accessible through this site, forks down!!!). Only suggestion is to cook it to a slightly lower temperature if you want medium rare. 125 degrees resulted in meat that was cooked through and only very slightly pink.

Made this recently and it was surprisingly easy and really wonderful. It was my first attempt at duck and was surprised how easy it was! I really liked that the sauce was lighter than I expected. I made this with the simmered fingerling potatoes and the combination was great.

This was outstanding. Easy to make and the sauce has a tangy sweetness, not the cloying sweetness that sauces for duck can sometimes have.
