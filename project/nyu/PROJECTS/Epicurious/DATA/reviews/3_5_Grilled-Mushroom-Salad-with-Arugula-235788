This made a lovely salad for us. I used cremini, shitake, and portabellos. Marinated them in the vinaigrette and then grilled. After grilling I put them in a colander and let the oil drain. Then dried them between paper towels, so that by the time I added them to the arugula, they retained the grilled flavor but not the oil. Used a fraction of the remaining vinaigrette to dress the arugula/mushroom mixture. It made a great salad. We served it with a grilled NY strip steak, thinly sliced and fingerling potatoes roasted with garlic and capers.

I made this tonight with a few changes...so hard to truly rate this recipe. I used balsamic instead of champagne vinegar. Instead of shallots in the dressing I sliced red onion and grilled them with the mushrooms in a grill basket on the BBQ. I also added grilled chicken to make it a meal and it was really good. Would definitely make it again and will try it as originally written next time.

I used all portabellas, and it was still wonderful. A great pairing for steak. I think I would use less of the dressing for the final toss next time, as it did seem a bit on the oily side.

I have made this a couple of times - I use white balsamic vinegar since we don't keep champagne vinegar all the time. Delish! Red wine vinegar can give it a sort of 'steak marinade' flavor which is awesome with mushrooms. I would not use regular button mushrooms for this - we love using big oyster mushrooms and other unusual mushrooms we buy for cheap at the asian markets! YUM.

I made this without the chantarelles or shallots, since my market had neither. I did not miss them. I did not marinate the mushrooms because I hate the way that tastes. They went beautifully over the arugula. I also ended up with more dressing than I needed. The cooked mushrooms were a delicious contrast to the greens. The whole thing was very good.

I loved this recipe. It was my first time making it and it was a huge hit with my guests. I only had sliced cremini mushrooms at the time, which turned out great. I followed the recipe for the most part, with two additions: I sauted the mushrooms in butter and added 2 tbsp of Oloroso sherry. I did not however add salt at the end. I found the seasoning in the dressing was enough. It was quick, easy and tasty. I will make this a staple in my collection of recipes.

We really enjoyed the simple flavours of the recipe. One suggestion...I actually cut the ingredients in half and found that there was ample dressing left for the salad. Next time I think I would not use the entire remainder of the dressing since it made the arugula a bit "soggy".

I loved the meatiness of the mushrooms in this delicious salad. However, the cooking time for me was a bit longer than the recipe instructed. Nonetheless, this salad is great!
