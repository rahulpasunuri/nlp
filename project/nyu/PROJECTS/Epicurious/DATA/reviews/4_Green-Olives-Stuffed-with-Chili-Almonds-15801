Exceptionally easy recipe with exceptionally good results. I've served this at 4 dinner parties now and get oohs and ahhs every time!

absolutely fantastic! interesting contrast between the soft olive and toasty, crunch almond and also between the salty olive and the chili powder. i used garlic marinated olives and they were yummy!

simple and excellent snack to serve with cocktails. Marinate overnight for best flavor.
