This soup is delicious! I made a few mistakes (notably forgetting the roux entirely!) so it might have been even better. My biggest complaint: HOLY CHOPPING! Admittedly I am slow but this soup took me twice as long as the "active time." So be prepared. Not sure it's worth it for all the work, but it made a ton and it tastes great.

I thought this was one of the best tasting recipes for greens that I have had. I the only exception I made was to use smoked turkey legs instead of ham hocks. Even my husband who turns his nose up at greens ate several portions. I will definately make this again. Oh and to the person from Piccadilly Circus now that was funny!

I ate gumbo z'herbes in New Orleans at a restaurant near the convention center. It was quite tasty...as to its origin, well, the reason I'm looking up a recipe is that a friend of mine gave me a pallet of collards and kale and I need to do something with them....if you grow greens, you end up with an abundance...

Haven't tried this recipe. There is a recipe for Gumbo Z'Herbes (a Dunbar's version) in Deidre Stanforth's "The New Orleans Restaurant Cookbook", copyright 1967.

I made this for my twin sister and she just couldn't stop raving about it (of course, ever since she contracted syphilis from Joe-Joe the Dog-Faced Boy she's raving most of the time). Even though we do pretty much everything together (we're joined at the hip - literally), it's rare that we agree on food, so this recipe was a wonderful discovery. We've been to the South numerous times in our travels with the circus and have never had gumbo quite like this, but that certainly didn't inhibit our enjoyment of this dish. The fact that we used Mediterranean sea salt, Trinity bottled water, butter we churned ourselves from the cream of hand-milked Brown Swiss cows, and ham hocks imported directly to us from the Black Forest may have enhanced the flavors somewhat. Being on the cutting edge of culinary excellence is crucial to me (us), despite what the reviewer from Vancouver may think.

Way to go Arkansas! I agree! Perhaps the person from Vancouver needs----um----fiber, maybe? Thank goodness I know people from up there that are really much nicer to be around.

Being a southerner and a lover of spicy food, I agree with most of you (with the exception of Vancouver). Roux is the cornerstone of gumbo. The term though does refer to the African "okra". My main thought is that if you are here at the site, and you take the time to write something, then aren't YOU one of the "morons" depending upon others approval?

Toronto: what's the matter, can't make up your own mind about a recipe? Need the opinion of a bunch of strangers, who, for all you know, could have the taste and food savvy of a bunch of syphilitic circus mutants? Do you really care if Betty from Brownsville thinks it's "awesome," or if Dana from Detroit says, "even my 5 year-old liked it!" Please keep mind that 90% of the population are complete morons.

Enough of this gumbo mumbo-jumbo! I'm no Dumbo, just a Canadian girl looking for a good feed. This was lovely, simple and good. Added sliced chorizo to make it heartier. Now if you'd all start reviewing these recipes along with your comments it would be much more helpful!

Notwithstanding whether it's appropriately named, I was lukewarm about this recipe. Although my guests liked it (given ample room to submit an honest opinion), it seems to me that all you really end up with is a large pile of moderately-flavored, somewhat overcooked greens. I sauteed bread rounds in olive oil and rubbed them with garlic to serve under the soup; I thought that helped. I also think adding some sausage slices would help, but then again it would just take longer to finish the leftovers that way, and I'm not sure that's a desirable side effect.

Good grief, the debate continues... How about this, this recipe isn't for "gumbo" it's for "gumbo z'herbes," a different beast altogether. Yes, the word gumbo means okra, and no, this recipe doesn't contain file or a dark roux or okra, but this isn't gumbo, it's gumbo z'herbes. Also, consider this. Louisiana andouille is nothing like French andouille, yet they have the same name. Same for boudin. I doubt many of you gumbo nay-sayers have complained about their names.

So now that we know everyones opinions on what gumbo is or is not, why doesn't someone RATE THIS DISH!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have a recipe from the Picayune's Creole cookbook very similar to this one. I would consider that cookbook an authority on Creole cooking. I have a copy of the 1901 edition. The cookbook says this recipe is served on good friday and there is a variation of it served with ham and veal.

As the "Cook from New Orleans" and my creole ex-wife always said... FIRST you make a roux. Okra is also one of the prime ingredents of a Gumbo. The roux if cooked darkly (and only in a cast iron skillet) and the okra give the Gumbo it's flavor and consistency. The smokey flavor can come from a dark roux (add some black pepper). Saute some onions; and what you add after that is imaterial...

This is a pretty good version of gumbo z'herbes. This is a dish which has only recently received attention from local chefs and food media. In the history of restaurant biz, it has never been a popular offering here in N.O. A traditional gumbo it is not. It evolved as a "gumbo" when people didn't have meat or seafood to use - not because of the church's ban on meat on Friday. I could write pages on gumbos but would like to point out three things: Gumbo does refer to okra, an african word. Okra is one of the three thickeners used for gumbo. The others are gumbo file' from sasafras leaves (originated with native Americans here) and roux, the flour thickener. Yes, file' powder was actually used as a thickener and not a seasoning, but it does a rather poor job. Nowadays, I see gumbos using all three and laugh quietly at the authors who claim to be "purists".

I searched the Net for gumbo z'herbes and found that it is also called green gumbo; that it is a very traditional gumbo, originally prepared on Holy Thursday for Good Friday: that not all gumbos contain orka: that most gumbos are thickened by roux, but some by using filé powder; and that Tabasco (McIlhenny Co.) and Emeril Lagasse have recipes for green gumbo that are very similar to the controversial one here. I also found, at least three times, the statement saying there are as many recipes for gumbo as there are Cajun cooks. I will certainly try this recipe.

I love it when Yankees try to tell people from Louisiana what Gumbo is. For their knowledge, Gumbo is an African word meaning Okra. Even if you add Okra, you still have a simi-Roux thinkened vegitable soup. As vegitable soup it is not bad, but as Gumbo it is a flop.

I RATE THIS RECIPE HIGHLY. ALL THE GREENS AND HERBS, I USED ALL THE TIME.

This can be called a gumbo, it does have a roux (read carefully). Whatever, the ingredients in a gumbo have always been variable, make a roux, and add whatever veggies and meat you have or wish. This is very good.

I haven't made this, but plan to as it sounds delicious. The discussion is probably the most interesting I've ever read on Epicurious about a recipe.

This is NOT gumbo in any shape or form. The first rule of good gumbo is: First you make a roux. None of these vegetables are used in traditional gumbo. This is vegetable soup!!!

I have made this recipe vegetarian and I found that if you use soy sauce to taste in addition to the tabasco you will do very well. Also a good vegetable stock helps with the flavor also.

To the cook from Olney, MD. You can add smoked turkey wings to any recipe calling for smoked ham or bacon and still get the same smoky flavor without using pork products. Depending on where you shop, I'm sure you can find Kosher turkey wings.

Maybe it was called Depression Soup somewhere in the South, but not in New Orleans or the Cajun Country. It was and still is a staple there and is called Gumbo, not soup, okra not withstanding!

To give the soup a smokey flavour with out the ham hocks, instead of the regular peppers you could use chipotle peppers in adobo (sp?)--they're lovely and smokey, and not overwhelmingly hot--I use them often for the smoked meat flavour without hte meat. Tabasco also makes a very nice Chipotle hot sauce that you could use as your hot sauce to serve the soup with.

I never add ham hocks or bacon to soup recipes, as I keep kosher. Generally I just use vegetable broth when they call for water to give it a little extra kick since you won't have the flavor of the meat. There's also a product called "liquid smoke" that you could add some of to get that smokey flavor of ham.

If I wanted to make this vegetarian, any ideas on what to add to substitute for the ham flavor?

In the 1930's depression, this was known as "Depression Soup," but never called "Gumbo" unless Okra was added. The field hands may have been poor, but they were smart enough to know that "gumbo" or "okra" was the fruit of the Hibiscus esculantus, and valued it highly as a food.

I found all these greens at an organic farm near here and decided to make this. It was delicious, but then we love greens. I followed the recipe, except I halved it (two people) and when it came time to add the spinach, there was such a pot full of greens, I decided to omit it. The greens are very mild in flavor because of the short cooking time. I served over white rice and with sliced tomatoes and cornbread. Delicious.
