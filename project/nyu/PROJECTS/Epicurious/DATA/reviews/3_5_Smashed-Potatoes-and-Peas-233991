I found this bland. If you love the flavor of peas, it's for you. Nothing bad about it, just not anything special.

This has become my standard smashed potato method, with or without peas. Very simple, very good.

This recipe was delicious and hearty. I found it difficult to keep the milk from boiling, but will definitely be making this again.

So good! As the potatoes simmered I was a little concerned about the milk-to-potato ratio, but in the end everything was perfectly proportioned and the dish was surprisingly wonderful. The peas gave the potatoes a lovely sweetness. Season to taste with salt and pepper (and maybe additional butter), otherwise I wouldn't change a thing about this.

Very good. Used Idaho potatoes instead which took much longer to cook. You should adjust timing to for addition of peas depending on type of potato to ensure peas are not overcooked.

Delicious! Cooked potatoes a little longer than suggested, but was just so tasty. Going to use it for Easter dinner..
