I don't cook a lot - but wanted to find a baked beans recipe - made this one - used pepsi instead of coke -- we have een enjoying it for days as a side dish.

The beans came out delicious, but I did make a few changes. I found that it wasn't quite as sweet as I like my beans, and didn't want to add more coke because it was already at a desirable consistency, so I added a tablespoon of pure maple syrup and it was fantastic! I also subbed turkey bacon for the real bacon, and while it didn't get as crispy, the flavor was still great.

I got lots of compliments on this recipe. Like others, I added onions. People at the party really raved about them. The only other thing I changed was I used a mixture of balsamic and rice vinegar cuz that's what I had on hand. Being from the South and the home of Coke, I would recommend Vidalia onions for this.

I have bi-monthly soirées and I always serve food and drink. This dish was spectacular, quick and easy. I will make it again, the crowd won't let me forget it.

This was easy and delicious. I also added chopped onions - a must! Easy to reheat stovetop, just add more coca cola.

What kinds of people complain about opening 3 cans as too much work? Lazy, lazy, lazy! I prefer making baked beans from dry beans, but not everyone has the time to do that.

Definitely interesting and worth making...every once in a while. The suggestions from other cooks definitely helped the final product.

Terrible. Icky taste, icky texture. I'm taking the leftovers to work tomorrow to pawn them off on my co-workers. Ick! My co-workders didn't like it either.

I liked this recipe. Nice flavor. Served this for a family gathering. Coke was a nice flavoring

Found this most excellent when substituting Polish Sausage for Bacon...

Mine didn't have that thick sauce you expect of baked beans, which I think is great because that stuff will run all over everywhere and drip all over you. Instead, the hamburger bun only had juice from the burger and toppings in it, instead of that brown goo.

This recipe was a great hit this weekend. I really appreciated the fact that I could make it the day before, refrigerate...add a little coke the next day and warm up nice and moist for the gathering! Many guests marveled over the flavor! Lots of can opening but well worth it!
