Very easy, light and delicious. I added a little more sugar since the strawberries were not very sweet and served over ice cream. It was a hit!

This is delicious! I made it to go with the Margarita Chiffon cake, but I can't keep from sneaking samples... Watch out.

I used Grand Marnier instead of Triple Sec. I expected the strawberry flavour to be more intense. Overall it made for light dessert. Next time I will serve it with lime gelato or sorbet to make it more interesting.

This is a very good recipe, however, I think next time I'll use a bit more sugar, it turned out somewhat bitter but still very good.

Some friends from work made this along with the margarita chiffon cake for my birthday. It was great! Both the cake and compote were delicious! We all agreed that the compote would be good on ice cream as well. It was a perfect dessert for a summer evening.

Not sure the point of this recipe. Sure it's easy but for the effort I could have made myself a margarita with a side of fresh strawberries

I was surprised that I did not like this, since margaritas are my favorite drink. This did not taste like a margarita, though. I used very tasty fresh strawberries, but soaking them in the tequila, triple sec, and lime juice just made them taste bitter. Next time I make the margarita chiffon cake, I will just use a strawberry and sugar mixture, and let the strawberries form their own juice.

A must for a margarita chiffon cake and interesting on it's own or with ice cream.

Excellent and sooo easy to prepare. For a dinner party of 16, I made a REALLY rich Snickers Cheesecake and served the strawberries as a refreshing accompaniment.

This is an excellent dessert or appetizer! Easy & tasty. I have made it twice for 2 Cinco de Mayo parties and everyone loved it!
