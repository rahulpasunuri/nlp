I'm making this for the 2nd time. I just love this broth! It's comforting, healthy, simple and makes the house smell like heaven.

Unlike the chicken soup/broth recipe which appeared in the same article, this came out watery and bland. Not my kind of beef broth. Frankly, a can of beef broth from the store tastes better.

Very simple, very good. I made it a day in advance to use in another soup recipe. I will use the remaining meat in a Mexican-style shredded beef salad. Was easier than making stock. Because I had to add water in stages, it took longer to simmer and filled the house with a pleasant aroma. Lovely.
