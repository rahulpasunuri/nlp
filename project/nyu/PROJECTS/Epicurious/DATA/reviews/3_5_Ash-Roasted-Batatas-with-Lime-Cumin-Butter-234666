This dish had incredible flavor, and was also very easy. I roasted the sweet potato in the oven, and mixed it with the butter just before serving. Everyone loved it, including the kids. I'm making it next for dinner guests, because it's that good.

Batatas are easily found in New York supermarkets with the Spanish vegetables. I was instructed to peel and cut them up and boil them in unsalted water until tender. They leave a slightly sticky residue on fingers and knives but really do taste like chestnuts and are worth hunting down if you are a chestnut lover. This recipe appears to be delicious but try them first just plain boiled.

Where in the world can you get a boniato/batata? I've never seen this variety of sweet potato.
