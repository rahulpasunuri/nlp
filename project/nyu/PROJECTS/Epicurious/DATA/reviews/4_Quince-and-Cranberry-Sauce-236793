Very good, when I don't have quince I just replace by a mix of apple and pear.

Exquisite...Such an improvement over the way-too-sweet cranberry sauces. I noticed some things: (a) 1 1/4 cups of cranberries is NOT 4 oz, more like 7. I bought a small box of fruit, about 7 oz) and used it all with no ill effects. (b) I had to add about 3/4 cup of the quince water as the cranberries cooked or it would have stuck to the pan. The big question is...what to do with the leftover quince water?? It is delicious on its own!

This recipe is excellent! It is the perfect blend of sweet and tart. I made it last year at Thanksgiving and it was such a big hit, I am making 2 batches this year to replace our regular cranberries. The only downfall to this recipe is that it is time consuming so I would recommend making it ahead of time. Enjoy!
