Very good. I used a slightly spicey pepper and did not grill the bread. Very easy and pleasing.

A real crowd pleaser! The curry makes this tomato bruschetta deliciously different. I omitted the pepper and the recipe still tastes great. I would recommend chopping up the tomatoes into smaller pieces, though.

This was a really delicious and unique alternative to the typical bruschetta. Nice Indian/fusion flavor and my guests all loved it.

I loved this as an alternative to my normal basil, balsamic bruschetta. To the previous cook. Madras curry powder is a formulation from Madras India. There are different combinations of spices used depending on the region. You can use any you like though. I used one my friend brings me from South Africa.

What are Italian frying peppers? Also why do you prefer Madras curry? I never see anything other than "curry powder". I drive a great distance to any larger market and I don't remember ever seeing the different curry powders that are often mentioned in recipes. Thanks

Delicious! I served this at a dinner party and everyone raved about it. The curry powder and brown sugar make it unique and special. I think it would probably taste great over pasta, too.
