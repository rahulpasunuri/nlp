I made this and cut it into appetizer-sized pieces. It was delicious and a little different, but the the pieces were kind of sloppy and hard to move. Either plot the crust with space for cutting or make it a knife and fork event.

Very tasty. The pepper and pesto combo is great. I'm going to try adding peppers to pesto pasta. There was a little too much crust. I think it could have been done as a single crust. Or save some pesto to dip the crust in.

I made this to use up the last of my turkey sausage and fresh red pepper. Delicious. I diced the red pepper and then quickly sauteed it. Then I followed the recipe until the last part. I did not double crust the pizza, and it was still yummy. To made 2 pizzas, and browned a little more sausage and added a bit more cheese, but everything else was good as is. A quick and comforting weeknight meal!

I used sweet italian sausage instead of hot. It was tasty and delicious. It would be great for a party. I forgot to season it with salt and pepper and found that it didn't even need the extra seasoning.
