This recipe is very adaptable. I roast the vegetables and add more, celery, peppers, yellow onions, asparagus, whatever I have. Also double the sauce and top with cilantro.

I add water chestnuts and sometimes celery to this. Definitely double the dressing. Also, I marinate the veggies in dressing, and then grilled the steak as well as the carrots and peapods. This turned out nicely!

Used lots of sauce and rice noodles as suggested, and it was a huge hit.

Took advice and doubled the dressing - also added toasted sesame seeds. Wonderful - if using fresh pasta like called for, add the veggies first for 1 min. then the pasta.

This is a great recipe. However, as suggested by other reviewers, doubling the sauce is a must. We added freshly pressed ginger to the marinade and the sauce. Also, we added thinly sliced red bell pepper.

I found this rather bland. I think doubling the sauce would be a good better, and like the idea of adding some toasted nuts for a little crunch. Recommend cooking flank steak on high heat for no more than 3 minutes per side for medium rare, 5 per side on medium gave me medium.

Great Great Dish. It's just me and my wife, but I still make the whole recipe. It's just as good the next day and makes a real nice lunch. Don't waste your time cutting the carrots into matchsticks. Just use a cheese grater.

Have made this dish many times. You can use rice noodles, but they are stickier than regular pasta. I also add a little lemon or lime juice to the dressing. You can add red peppers or other veggies. Any sliced beef will work too.

Easy and delicious! I am not a fan of garlic (crazy, I know!) or raw onions, so I made a few changes. I used less garlic and more ginger in the dressing and it turned out great! Also, after removing the meat from the pan to rest, I threw in the onions and let them cook a little bit. My husband and I both loved this recipe!

I made this recipe with a few omissions due to the limitations of my kitchen that day. I loved the marinade for the flank steak. The addition of the crushed red pepper was fabulous. Just enough spark. I used Japanese Udon noodles but didn't have snow peas or green onions, which would have made it better. I did substitute cut up broccoli heads which was all I had. I would try this again when I have all the ingredients in the house.

Steak is fantastic. Noodles lacking in flavor. I took the noodles up a notch with some chili powder and some hoisin sauce. Small changes made a huge difference in enjoyment.

Can actually only speak for the noodles this time. Very good side to the salmon with soy-honey and wasabi sauces from this site. My 17 year old who loves Japanese loved them both. Used Japanese wheat noodles instead of Italian pasta. May be had more than 9 oz because we could have used a touch more dressing. Type of rice vinegar(plain vs seasoned wasn't specified so I used a bit of both). Next time I'll try the flank steak Made it with the steak and it was also good, but we preferred the salmon with this one. Also used thin spaghetti-but Japanese wheat noodles are far superior

I actually thought this was pretty horrible. It tasted like *bad* Chinese food. I prepare Asian meals frequently and suspected this wouldn't turn out, but I gave it a go anyway. The steak recipe isn't as mediocre as the noodles. The sesame oil is overwhelming and, alas, gross.

This was good and very easy. I grilled the steak over medium heat and used Asian noodles. Next time I make it, I would lessen the vegetable oil, and whisk the green onions and chopped cilantro into the dressing just before tossing the noodles in. Then garnish with a touch of cilantro leaves.

Great recipe. I like things with a lot of flavor and doubled the sauce and the spicy ingredients the marinade. It was wonderful. I'd definitely make it again.

This dish was ok. I liked the marinade for the steak. My husband thought the dish was ok but said he didn't want me to make it again.

Both my kids asked me to make this again, but my 12 year old said it needed more umph! And that was having already doubled the dressing. I also added one pound of meat instead of only 1/2. Next time I will add more of everything, except the pasta.

I really like the vegetables mixed in with the noodles. I used Asian noodles. The dish was tasty, but it needed more spice. I ended up adding chili paste to the finished product just to bring out more flavor.

I wasn't too sure when I started cooking it, because my boyfriend and I had never used rice vinegar or sesame oil in cooking before, so we were doubtful of how it was going to taste. It was wonderful. It had the twist of spice, that nice asian-style flavor. This is oneof my favorites for sure.

This is one of my favorite weekday meals to make. So easy and flavorful. It's become a staple in our household and my husband looks forward to the leftovers for lunch the following day.

This was okay. I would only make it again because it is so quick and easy.

I used too many noodles and thus it was dry. Good flavor other than that.

This dish was excellant! It was so easy to make. I substituted Jasmine rice for the noodles, and kept my vegetables separate from the rice. My boyfriend loved it and even had thirds!

Grilled the steak---as others suggested and used Asian noodles. Very good. We enjoyed the marinade and the dressing. Veggies gave good color and crunch. We'll do this again.

We grilled the steak rather than pan seared it and it was great. Everyoned loved the flavor of the meat as well as the pasta. Will definitely prepare again!!

I made this dish last night and the dressing for the noodles just missed. I think if I made it again I would use Asian noodles and add "something" to the dressing to make it stand out a little more.

Although the pan seared steak was good, the noodles were bland and boring.

Enjoyed this recipe. Not difficult to prepare or cook. Wonderful blend of flavors. Might have cut back a little on the soy sauce, as there was a slight bitter aftertaste. Overall it was great!! Would make it again.

Fantastic, the mix of flavors was great. The honey/soy sauce was a great marinade and the searing in a pan worked out well. I made it two nights ago and am planning on making it again tonight. Try oriental noodles.

Great recipe. The dressing and marinade for the steak combined perfectly with simple pasta and vegetables. The cilantro gave it a unique taste that was still in keeping with the Asian theme. Easier, less time-consuming, and less messy than stir-fry but just as good. I will definitely make this again, and the only thing I may try differently is grilling the steak instead of pan-searing it.
