I tried this tart at Christmas and it was amazing. It was easy and the taste of the fresh cardamom was well worth the extra effort of grinding and not using preground. It was a it with everyone.

i was so happy to find this recipe! i first had fyrstekake in norway 30 years ago. this is the best recipe i've found. i didn't change a thing. it's a bit hit (especially trying to pronounce the name correctly!)

So yummy! I've made a cinnamon version and plain almond one too. Added 1 tsp almond extract for more pronounced flavor. I also used blanched almond flour/meal rather than slivers. Freeze it, then process with powdered sugar for more fine grind. Found it in bulk at whole foods. Bob's Red Mill also makes 1lb packages of it.

Everyone just loved it and I particularly like that it's an easy do ahead dessert. Will be serving it on Christmas. Oh, and the crust is exceptional.

this didn't do anything for me. maybe i didn't grind the almonds enough because it turned out grainy. also the flavor just wasn't there. i love almonds but this dessert just didn't meet my expectaions. unfortunate.
