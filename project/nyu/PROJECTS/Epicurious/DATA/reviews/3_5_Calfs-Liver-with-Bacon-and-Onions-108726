Very good, but missing something. I added sage and finished browning the onions after the liver had cooked, so I could soak up those tasty brown bits. This is a good recipe for a super-quick weekday meal, but if I had more time I definitely prefer the Sauteed Calf's Liver with Red Wine Vinegar recipe on here.

My family is one of few that love this dish. I made this for my mom - she hadn't had liver & onions for years! It brought back childhood memories for all of us!

There really isn't anything to the recipe. It's easy to prepare and taste great. I'm a big liver and onions fan and what made this different, was the soaking in milk. A definite keeper.
