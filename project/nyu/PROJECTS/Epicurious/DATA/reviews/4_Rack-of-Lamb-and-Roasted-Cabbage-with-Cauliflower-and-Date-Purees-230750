This dish was so simple and so delicious. The richness of the lamb balanced the delicateness of the cauliflower. The date puree was out of this world. I think I will roast cabbage for every side dish from on. The raisin added enough sugar to carmelize the cabbage. My picky boyfriend, whom I didn't think would like the dried fruit devoured every bite! I'm not sure why this isn't a more popular dish.......
