More like Lemon Bricks with Cream Cheese. These were terribly dry - probably to make speading the cream cheese easier - and you need it to get a little moisture in there! The only good thing I can say is that they slid out of the pan easily. I wouldn't waste time making these again - try the poppy seed raspberry! Delicious and moist.

I altered the recipe a little based on previous reviews to make it more moist and flavorful. Well, I made it moist, but there was only so much I could do for the flavor. Even adding coconut, wheat germ, and more lemon juice and sugar didn't do much. It's not a bad recipe, but not it's good either.

1st - I always read some of the reviews for feedback. 2nd - I love lemon - but, did note that it lacked "gems", so I EDITTED ALOT! I added 1C coconut, 1.5C frozen Cranberries, 1/4C Poppseeds, 1 tsp baking powder (would have also included nuts, but didn't have any!) Exch 2C stoneground whole wh flour w/wheat germ for the white flour Increased lemon juice to 3/4C I live in Calgary, so altitude does have an impact. Preheated oven @ 400, red to 350 for 10 min and a further reduction to 300 for 5 min. EXCELLENT!

Wish we had read the reviews before making this. We did add a brown-sugar crumb topping to the muffins before baking which helped somewhat. If not for the topping, it would have been tasteless.

This IS the worst muffin recipe that I have ever encountered. It was extremely dry, with virtually no flavor. Please don't waste your time.

dry, bland and boring. Might work with heavy accompaniment but useless alone.
