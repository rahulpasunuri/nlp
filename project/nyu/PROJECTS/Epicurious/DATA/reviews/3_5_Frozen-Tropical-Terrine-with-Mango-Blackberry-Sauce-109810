This dessert is fabulous, refreshing and very easy to make(though a little time consuming). Guests RAVE about this dessert. I was asked many times where I "bought" this cake and people were shocked to learn that it is home made! It looks and tastes that good!

I also used raspberry sorbet and topped with a mixture of mango and raspberries. Everyone raved!

I used raspberry sorbet in place of the boysenberry - this was such a lovely finish to a tamale and Southwestern meal. I used it prior to the "real" dessert - and it's a wonderful treat especially on hot summer evenings! It's easy to make - and it presents beautifully on the table! YUM!

So easy and what a presentation... my friends raved that it looked like a dessert from a high end gourmet restaurant!

Everybody loved this dessert and raved about how nice it looked. Next time I think I'll use less coconut, though. My ice cream soak up all the coconut on the bottom and it just ended up being an overwhelming amount of coconut. I'll use less than half next time and only put it on the top.

Fabulous presentation. Great summer dish. Everybody loves it. Any ideas how to make it a good winter dessert?

This recipe was DELICIOUS! Made it for a party and it was a big hit! I changed it a bit-took out the cocoanut and used raspberry sorbet instead of the blackberry. Very easy to make and looks incredible!

If you are in or near the Santa Cruz, CA area local ice cream maker Marianne's makes the best coconut-pineapple ice cream (among many others).

This was very lovely for a summer luncheon desert. I too couldn't find pineapple-coconut ice cream and used vanilla (for the proper color). It's easy and delicious.

Luscious and very attractive dessert - looks just like the picture. Very easy to make, yet looks impressive on the plate and garners copious compliments. Unable to find the ice cream and sorbets called for, I made some small/minor substitutions and used a trio of gelati: pineapple, blackberry and passion fruit. The vanilla bean was superb in the blackberry/mango sauce but I added 2 tbsp. clear/colourless raspberry liquer just before serving which added a little extra zing. The toasted coconut was a wonderful addition so do not leave it out. A very refreshing and pretty way to end a summer dinner.
