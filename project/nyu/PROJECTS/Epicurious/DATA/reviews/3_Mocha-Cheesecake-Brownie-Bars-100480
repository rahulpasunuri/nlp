Nothing special.I didn't like the sour cream in the filling. It didn't cut the sweetness of the chocolate, it just gave it a strange sour chocolate taste - nice texture though. My husband HATED it. I won't make it again.

I've made this a few times and it's ALWAYS a crowd pleaser. I prefer omitting the top layer so that its not so overwhelmingly sweet.

I thought this was kind of a pain for the results I got. The brownies were good, but not so good I want to do this again.

A rich bar and we enjoyed the combo of flavours. The top layer did not set properly, which is I suspect was due to using non-fat sour cream.

My friend made this recipe and she did a shortcut, for the brownie mix she used a box of fudge brownie mix and it turned out GREAT! Saves time for Moms!

Very rich; I think the coffee flavor was a bit much. And it's a lot of effort for such a small product. But you can cut them up into tiny pieces.

I enjoyed these rich little bars, however i agree the coffee flavor was a bit too strong and artificial. Everyone seemed to enjoy them as well at the holiday party i brought them to, so i heartily recommend.

Anyone who isn't thoroughly delighted with this recipe is need of some serious therapy! Come on, what's not to like? It was smooth, rich tasting, had great mocha flavour and was easy to make. We'll definately make it again. Oh, and to the cook who threw their's into the trash... can I be your garbage collector?

Unlike the other reviewers, I thought this was a complicated recipe that was not worth the effort. The mocha flavor tasted very artificial. I served this amongst other tasty treats at a party and they were hardly touched. They eventually went in the trash.

My husband says, "Thumbs up. Give it four forks." and so I am. Nice combination of chocolate, cream cheese and coffee. Thought I wouldn't like the coffee taste but it blended in well. The sour cream and confectioner's sugar topping was a surprise to me in that it didn't have that sour cream taste.

I thought this was just O.K. My hubby on the other hand loved it, so I may make it again. I'm sure there are better brownie recipes out there!

This is a very rich recipe which gives a clear understanding as to why an 8x8 pan serves 24. A little bar goes a long way. Creamy with lots of mocha flavor. If you're not crazy about mocha, cut down on the instant coffee by 1/2T. My boys and husband loved this dessert.
