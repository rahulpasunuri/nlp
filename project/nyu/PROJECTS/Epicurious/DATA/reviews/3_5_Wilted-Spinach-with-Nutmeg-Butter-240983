Good, light option. Might I stress again that this cooks down A LOT.

This was absolutely god-awful. My family ate it, but I think it's because they were drunk. The other reviewer was right when they said that the 4 pounds of spinach reduces down A LOT. With four pounds of spinach, my family of four each got a tiny little pile of the finished product. I, too, reduced the amount of butter, because you don't need nearly that much of it. As I was making the recipe, it occurred to me that it was asking for a huge amount of nutmeg, so I used only a teaspoon, but even that was WAY too much. The nutmeg was overpowering to the point where the dish even had a gritty texture. When creamed spinach and au gratin call for nutmeg, they use only a tiny bit. I should have known better. If I ever try this again, I'll use only an itty-bitty pinch of nutmeg, and only a tablespoon or less of butter.

I reduced amount of butter, and next time will reduce the amount of nutmeg as well. It is a nice side dish, no fuss, but 4 lbs of spinach is a lot of spinach... I wilted it down in water a day ahead, otherwise it took up too much space in the fridge.

Amazing! Beware, though, the spinach cooks down a lot. I hardly had enough to serve to guests.

Delicious and easy! The nutmeg flavor is great. When I make it again, I will probably reduce the amount of butter as I prefer lighter cooking and you simply don't need it all.
