This is a fantastic cornbread recipe and in the Cornbread Dressing with Ham and Fennel recipe is is outstanding. The roasted red peppers are slightly sweet so I always reduce the amount of sugar, which I would recommend. Otherwise the cornbread is too sweet for my taste. It is delicious with chili. http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Corn-Bread-Dressing-with-Ham-Fennel-and-Carrots-107291

I used this in a cornbread stuffing recipe and was quite pleased - but thought the bread was only ok on its own. Very easy to make though.

Made this for Christmas Dinner -- added some green chives --and used white corn meal. So the red and green effect was very festive. Good recipe -- nice texture and flavorful. Easy basic recipe

Easy, moist, colorful, the roasted red peppers makes this recipe a standout. It didn't rise as much as I expected but the finished corn bread wasn't dense or heavy. I added a cup of cooked whole kernel corn - a nice addition as far as flavor and texture goes, but this might have made the batter a little heavier. My boyfriend, who, for sake of this review, would like to be identified as "Crazy Uncle Roscoe", went back for seconds and thirds.

I love corn bread and this one great. I didn't have buttermilk so I used regular milk but substitued 1/4 cup of it for sour cream. I served it with chili from another issue. Delicious.
