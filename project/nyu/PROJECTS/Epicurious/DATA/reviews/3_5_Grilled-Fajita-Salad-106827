Obviously, I'm in the minority here, but I found it just OK. No citrus vinaigrette at our grocery, so made a simple lime vinaigrette (oil, lime juice, Dijon mustard, garlic, cumin, salt & pepper). I think that the vegetables would have been better chilled, fresh and crunchy rather than grilled, hot and soft -- hot food on lettuce tends to be a personal aversion of mine that DH does not share. Will try it that way next time, and will also look for one of the bottled dressings listed here. Perhaps my lime vinaigrette was to blame for the lukewarm response.

This is a good, simple summer meal. I served it on a grilled tortilla instead of chips. Next time I will try it with shrimp.

I haven't tried this yet but the citrus vinaigrette from the Corn and Cabbage Slaw is excellent. 1/3 cup rice wine vinegar, 1/3 cup vegetable oil and 1/3 frozen orange juice concentrate, thawed.

I couldn't find a citrus vinaigrette like other reviewers so I used a greek vinaigrette and added lime...it worked, but I'll keep my eye out for the real thing for the next time I make it. The pork was a nice change from usual chicken. I would season the pork with a little cumin to make it a litlle more Mexican tasting.

Fantastic! For an extra citrus kick, add half of the juice of a lemon and a half of the juice of a lime to the citrus marinade. My wife and kids said this is a keeper. Don't forget the sangria!

Loved this salad! Made completely according to recipe and turned out great. Read some other reviewers who had trouble finding citrus dressing. Litehouse does a tangy citrus dressing (which also has some heat) which I found with the refrigerated dressings in the vegetable isle. Good Stuff!!!!!!

This was an easy summer salad that was delicious and is a great salad at a summer party. It was so refresing and different than a regular salad....GREAT!

For those who are seeking more of a kick, try this: Replace 1/3 cup of the vinaigrette with salsa and whisk until well combined. Then use the vinaigrette-salsa combination in the same proportions as the recipe reads. Delicious!

I love this, but had a hard time finding a "citrus vinaigrette". Just tasted Rene's Chili Tequila Lime "Grilling Sauce" (it was with the refrigerated dressings at the store)- it'll be perfect, probably won't even need the chili powder! One of my favorite main dish summer salads.

My husband and I loved this salad. It was easy and delicious on a hot summer night. We used a citrus chicken marinade called Stubbs. Excellent! Wouldn't change a thing!

This is a great summer meal. I've made it twice - the pork and the vegetables cook really quickly, and the citrus vinaigrette makes the salad light and refreshing. Great for hot summer nites. We have the leftovers as pork fajita wraps a couple of nites later.
