I thought these potatoes were a bit tasteless and boring. Maybe they needed more herbs or salt.

Great for a week night because it is easy to put together. I think the flavor is very good -- particularly with the sherry-lemon veal medallions.

This is good in spite of being low-fat. My only comment is to cut the amounts by a third. Seems like too many potatoes as part of a well balanced meal.

Yum! These were great and a big surprise they were fat free! I halved and quartered the potatoes so the broth could absorb inside and that seemed to work out great- I used green onions but next time I think I'll try chives.

I must have done something wrong. That's the only way I can explain off all the other, positive, reviews. They taste like potatoes boiled in chicken broth, basically. I didn't finish them so plan to mash them down and add all that fatty cheese and butter to make it worth my time. What went wrong?

So simple and great! It really is surprising with so few ingredients that this turns out so well. I had these cold the next day and they were just as good. Next time i think i'll try warming them through on the grill and spooning the sauce over for even more flavor!

I couldn't believe the intensity of flavor in this sauce! I served this as part of our Easter Sunday dinner, and everyone loved it...no one guessed it was low-fat!

Lots of flavor for those who are going the nonfat route. Next time, I'm going to halve or quarter the potatoes so the insides can absorb some of the flavorful broth.

This is a great recipe. It is very well seasoned. I have made it several times, with chives and with scallions. It is better with chives. I have also used it with larger red potatoes. It is a great alternative to roasted potatoes that have olive oil (fat) in the recipe.

I have made this potato dish at least 6 times. It is simple yet very flavorful (because of the chicken broth and wine. I have been looking thru recipes on the website for over an hour - looking for a new potato recipe for a dinner party this weekend but I think I will stay with this tried and true recipe instead.
