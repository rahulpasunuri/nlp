I have been making this since it appeared in Bon Appetit. It is is a no fail winner. Immense flavor and incredibly easy. All of Ms. Wizenburg's recipes that I have tried are great.

Made as per the recipe and turned out very tasty. Served with rice, tabouli, pita & hummus, broccoli and cauliflower. The sausages were a hit!

These were awesomeI I used lower fat feta, but otherwise stayed true to the recipe. Next time, I might make full size burgers and serve with yogurt and pita bread.

My husband and I thought the lamb sausage patties were excellent. I followed the recipe exactly, and served with greek yogurt sauce and green salad. I will make this often over the summer.

Made per recipe. Tasted fantastic and was super easy. Teen daughter gave seal of approval. Served with Ina Garten's tzatziki and a salad. Low carb, high protein, high fat. Gary Taube happy for my shrinking waistline.

I subscribe to a meat CSA, and this has been a wonderful way to employ an occasional pound of ground lamb.

Amazing! I used free range lamb sausage for this and it worked out great. So tasty.

Wonderful recipe and soooo easy! I mixed it all together also! Made about 13 small patties. I fried them up in a very hot cast iron pan and they seared up wonderfully, 3 min a side! Was able to take them to a friends Greek themed dinner party and just reheat in a 350 degree oven for a few minutes, served them with tzatziki and they were a hit!

Delicious Delicious Delicious and easy too!!! So JUICY by the way..YUM YUM! You'll love it:) I think that next time tough I will add chop zucchini cubes for some fiber.

Simple and excellent! Just pitas, tzatziki and salad to accompany. Made 4 without filling for my cheese-phobic daughter-she inhaled 3 of them. Grilled the patties instead of frying - a little smoky from the fat. There's mint in the garden - will be repeating this all summer!

I have made this four times in the last six weeks because it's so tasty and so easy. I mix the feta & mint into the ground lamb instead of inserting it into the middle, because it's easier and gives it more even flavoring. The key is to form the patties very lightly so the meat stays juicy, and don't overcook. Serve with greek salad

The best lamb burgers ever! Easy to make (I have made them 5x already)and even the kids love them! Once I did not have mint and no one noticed.

I like this recipe. I also substituted the goat cheese for the feta. We served it over mashed potatoes with spicy cucumber salad and it was great. Would definitely go well as a Swedish-meatballs-esque hors d'oeuvre as well.

I liked these - they were relatively simple to make and they tasted good. I think they're more appropriate as a canape though. I'd make them smaller and serve them at a cocktail party next time.

Very good. I just made this for the third or so time, and this time was the best. I mixed all the ingredients in with the lamb as another reviewer suggested; I used goat cheese instead of feta, which I think melded into the lamb better (I didn't have any feta.); I served them with a simple tzatziki sauce, arugula, and grilled pita. I made the patties quite small- -maybe an inch and a half in diameter, and best of all, I grilled them for 12 minutes on the gas grill instead of frying them. Quite nice.

I thought this recipe was good,and I really like lamb in general. However, when I made this, it had a very strong "lamby" smell to it which actually lasted on my mouth long after I had eaten it. Perhaps it was the lamb I used. Maybe I'll try the chicken, but even if the lamb itself had been better, I would still give it a good rating, perhaps 2.5 stars. (and I likely would make it again if I had grond meat to use to make something-- might also take the other cooks hint and combine it with the greek sauces)

A nice way to have lamb for a change. I plan to try serving as an hors d'oeuvre for entertaining as they can be prepped ahead of time.

I made these with tzatziki (greek yogurt mixed with lemon, garlic, dill, and grated cucumbers that have been salted & drained). It was really delicious and easy!

To make even healthier, I made this with ground chicken and fat-free feta, served on whole wheat pitas with low-fat yogurt tsaziki sauce with shredded lettuce, tomatoes, and sliced cucumbers. OUTSTANDING!

Loved it! My 5yr old loved it as did my picky husband. I just left out the mint as we did not have any and they were the best mini burgers ever!

This has become nothing short of an addiction in my home. I used Bulgarian feta which gives it a salty, strong kick. Serve this with a simple yogurt-cucumber-mint salad, and you're all set. I'll be making a ton of these, scaled up to burger-size, for a bbq later this month.

Excellent. I thought it would also be nice as a sandwich on pita with lettuce and a sauce.

Oh.. Forgot to mention. These are excellent topped with Greek tzatziki sauce (yogurt, cucumber & dill) + diced tomatoes.

So easy and so good! I just mixed everything together so the feta and mint were evenly distributed throughout the sausages.

Lamb sausages! Yummy!

What a great combination of ingredients - it produces a taste that is out of this world. I used 5 cloves of garlic and chopped them. Make sure you flatten enough - I left a couple thicker and the cheese wasn't completely melted.

Excellent. Also easy and quick. The market was out of mint, so I used fresh basil, and thought it was very good. Mint would probably have been better, though. I, too, served it with the Cilantro-Yogurt Sauce from the Middle Eastern Bison Meatball recipe---a great combination. Leftovers were good cold for lunch.

Easy and so flavorful. The lamb is pretty rich, so I served with Lemon Quinoa as contrast whoch was nice.

Nice flavor. Served with walnut tarragon bulgur, from this site.

This was SO good. I served it with the Cilantro-yogurt sauce from the Middle Eastern Bison Meatball recipe, though it was good plain, too.
