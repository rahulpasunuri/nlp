This was fabulous. I used boursin as I didn't really have anything else on hand, and it was truly delicious. However, I think you leave out the cheese (cutting calories and cost) with out any detriment...I would probably add a dash of cream to finish it, or a bit of butter. Will definitely be making again!

I have made this several times and it is one of my favorites. Tonight I made a thick, creamy white sauce with left over chicken and loads of mushrooms to serve over the polenta and it was amazing. It is best to cook the bacon very crisp and chop it up well before returning to the pan so it disperses through the mixture evenly. You can really use a variety of cheeses in this dish. Don't be afraid. I have used fontina as the recipe calls for but also aged white cheddar, gorganzola, parmesean and mozzarella. Not all together of course! It really is a very forgiving recipe and you can use what you have on hand for variety. Refridgerate the leftovers and the next morning after heating it with a little oil in a pan you can top it with a poached egg. Yum.

Creamy, delicious and satisfying. A perfect accompaniment to many entrees. No need to tweak this recipe, it's perfect!

I made this exactly as it suggested and found it to be wonderful! I lined some small ramekins with plastic wrap and then froze them. Later I thawed them pan fried them in a non-stick skillet to go with eggs at breakfast and it was great!

I love this recipe. It is easy and rich. I made it to accompany the Tomato Soup with Rosemary Cream, also on this site. I used feta instead of the fontina cheese, as that is what I had on hand. Instead of frying up bacon, I melted a little butter and olive oil and sauteed the onion and garlic, then added real bacon bits. Let those cook for a minute, then followed the remainder of the recipe. If I had sliced bacon on hand, I would have used it. I have a cold and this was great comfort food.

made this recipe as written EXCEPT the corn kernels and parsley. i am sure it would have been better with both. HOWEVER, a few days later, stuck with 28oz container of left overs, i added 1.5 c bread crumbs and 1 egg to the left overs and fried 1T balls in vegetable oil. AMAZING!!!!

This was easy and good. Our guests loved it, going back for seconds and we still had leftovers-next time I will pour them into ramekins for easier reheating or sauteing. We did not miss the corn at all.

I made this recipe last year and it was phenominal!!! This year I'm making my famous Chili for the Super Bowl and I'm going to try making the polenta, refrigerating it over night and frying up some polenta squares to serve the chili over! yum!!

This polenta is yummy. I used 1/2 cup parmesan, no fontina, and added the bacon with the cheese. I cooled it in a pan, cut in squares and sauteed in olive oil. I definitely will make this dish again.

Thi polenta is rich like another reviewer said. I was making this for 13 people, so I doubled it. It does double well, but I'm thinking I probably didn't need to as one was enough!

This is tasty! I used quick polenta and a mix of feta and parm cheeses as a variation and it was great with steak. I skipped the corn kernels and used half water and half chicken stock. Also, I reserved the sage and sprinkled it over when I plated the polenta. Using a flat whisk is indispensable to keep it from sticking/burning.

This polenta was fantastic, but very rich. I put this into ramekins, cooled it overnight, and fried it the next day. I served it with bacon wrapped filets for dinner. It was also great topped with a overeasy egg for breakfast.

I followed the recipe exactly and everyone loved it! I have made it multiple times and can't wait to make it again (probably tonight!).

The other polenta recipe with creamed corn and bacon (also on this site) is much better, albeit more complicated. This is a good quick dish to whip up in one pot. However, I recommend putting the crisp fried bacon back in at a much later stage. Also, it's very rich because there's too much cheese! I used some bonafide fontina from Italy but were I to make this again, I'd use the inexpensive faux American fontina and save the other stuff for nibbling on its own.

I used the regular cornmeal substitution and I found that there were a lot of lumps leftover despite much whisking. The polenta had a nice flavor (how could it not with cheese and bacon?!), but between the lumps of polenta and the kernels of corn, I found the texture really off-putting. I'd try this again with proper coarse cornmeal and without the corn kernels.

I thought this was all sorts of tasty. My husband thought it was a little too heavy for a polenta dish, feigning full shortly into the meal (I served this as the main dish, not as a side).

This is an excellent polenta recipe. It stands on its own as a side dish rather than the usual somewhat bland accompaniment to a main dish. I make polenta often but i will certainly make this one again.
