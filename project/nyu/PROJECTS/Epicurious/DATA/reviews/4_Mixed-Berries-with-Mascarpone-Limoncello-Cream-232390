This is a quick and easy summer dessert which I have made a half dozen times. I don't add the rasberry preserves but add a little brown sugar to the berries to let them sweat their juices. Absolutely delicious.

The fruit was great if a little sweet, and I would have been happy with just that, but the cream set it over the top. So simple and incredibly good. I can't wait to take some other reviewers suggestion and try it with other liqueurs.

Quick, easy and delicious-- if I'm using mostly sweeter berries like strawberries I will leave out the preserves and sugar entirely and just serve with the cream. I prefer the cream with amaretto instead of limoncello.

Makes winter berries almost taste like summer ones. I thought it was a bit too sweet--may depend on the sweetness of the preserves used. Next time will cut the amount of sugar. Looking forward to making these with local berries in season

I have made this numerous times and everyone loves it...easy, beautiful and a perfect light summer dessert. I do reduce the amount of sugar considerably...with the preserves you're adding to the berries and the limoncello, it's really not necessary. This is definitely a keeper!

This is my new "signature" summer dessert! One thing I changed... I left out the extra 1/2 cup of sugar. Mixed with the raspberry preserves, it's plenty sweet enough without it. The limoncello "makes" the cream.

Yum! Simple & refreshing. I macerated the berries (blueberries & quartered strawberries) in Limoncello & powdered sugar instead and it was great!

Made this for the Fourth of July for my family and a few friends. HUGE HIT!!! I slightly changed it though. For the berries, instead of the raspberries preserves, I squeezed on a little bit of lemon juice and added some sugar and mixed. Then for the mascarpone-limoncello cream I didn't have any limocello so I just left that part out and then put fresh lemon zest on top of the mascarpone cream. Excellent!

Very good. Great light dessert for summer. I did reduce the sugar added to the berries to 1/4 cup. Probably didn't even need that.

Made this for a party dessert and it was the hit of the meal. Raves from the guests. Substituted blackberry jam which added richness and depth to the berries.

This was great w/ a few modifications per other reviewer's suggestions. Used only 2 Tbs. sugar w/ the cream (whipped the cream first, then added room temp mascarpone). Used only 1/4 C. low sugar preserves and no additional sugar.

I have found that the berries on their own (without any preserves or sugar) are as good or better than the original recipe. I always receive rave reviews when I serve this in the summer.

Perfect ending for formal dinner party. Light enough to follow a veal main course. I make my own limoncello which perfectly accents fresh berries. The raspberry jam added a subtle depth to the berries. Mascarpone is tangy which ties all the flavors together. Easy presentation. Rave reviews and every bowl empty!

Ok, follow-up. I served this in a margarita glass, the "cream" in the center and the berries around it. Presentation was pretty but everything else fell short. The berries were the best part and again, I didn't do anything special with them except added lemon zest. I can eat everything and it didn't work for me. And since my husband is the pickiest eater on the planet, I knew he wouldn't take to it. I'll stick to my basic mousse recipes and save the marscapone for other things like the tiramisu Ice cream cake on this site.

I don't know what I was expecting but this isn't it. I used Lemon Extract as suggested by another reviewer and no preserves to the berries. The first batch, the cheese separated and the whole thing turned into a gloppy mess. I know Mascarpone doesn't like to be over mixed but I should have known better. The next batch I tried, I whipped the cream almost to soft peaks and then blended in the cheese. It's now more like a lightly flavored lemon mousse than cream. I haven't served it yet so I will remember the first rule of cooking - never apologize until after they've tasted it. I'll tell you my husband's response.

I make this at least every other month. We love it. If I don't have any limoncello, (It's nice for sipping too)I use lemon extract. It gives a nice flavor without the booziness.

I made this for a party of 10 to rave reviews. I substituted Grand Marnier but otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. Ginger biscotti (from this site) were great with it. I will definitely make this again!!!

This was wonderful and so easy. A perfect, light summer dessert. I took the advice of another reviewer and used frozen berries...if you have Trader Joe's, they have the mixture. No worries on whether all of the berries are good. This was a big hit and will become a favorite for summer.

This review applies to the MASCARPONE-LIMONCELLO CREAM only. Have not tried the berries. The cream is very easy, and with the mascarpone, it is very stable. Lasts longer then plain whipped cream. As a caution, the limoncello "liquor" flavor comes through very strongly. We all love this and i usually double it and use an entire container of the mascarpone - i find it easier to do that then measure out half. I serve this with the BLUEBERRY PUDDING CAKE on this site.

Wow! Perfect for a hot August night dinner party. I used raspberry pourable fruit instead of preserves and only added enough to coat the berries. Also, cut way back on the sugar--you don't need much with the fresh berries and pourable fruit.

I didn't have the lemon liquer, but did have an orange one, (the same type you can use to make cadilac margaritas) I also used orange zest instead of the lemon, cut down on the sugar, and found low sugar red rasberry preserves. I had frozen fruit, defrosted them in a bowl in the fridge during the day. Easy to put together for dessert later. will make this again

A wonderful dessert even after a heavy meal. To judge sweetness, just taste your whipped cream-mascaparone mixture before adding all the sugar. I piled the berries, which had been very gently mixed with the preserves, into a large bowl and covered them with the cream mixture and put into the refrigerator. A couple of hours later, the dessert was wonderful.

A delicious, refreshing dessert for a hot day. We reduced the sugar to 2 tablespoons in the cream, used 1 cup of cream and reduced the sugar added to the berries to 1 tablespoon. Next time we won't add any sugar to the berries and will use 1/2 cup of preserves (seedless). Do whisk together the preserves, sugar, if using, and the lemon zest before tossing with the berries. This will save wear and tear on the berries.

Rating: 3
Delicious and so easy! This is a great summer recipie. 3 Forks because I felt that the berries were a little too sweet, and the cream not lemony enough. When I make this again I'll cut the sugar to the berries, add a little extra limoncello to the cream and serve over angel food cake for balance.

I did this last night with orange zest and Napoléon Mandarine liqueur (I did not have limoncello or lemons anymore) and everyone raved about it! I did use the full amount of preserves and sugar and nobody thought it was too sweet - but we are all very tolerant to sweets in the family... Will definitely do this again!

I served this tonight--a hot steamy summer evening and everyone loved it! I agree with previous cooks that the sugar and preserves amount was way too much. I cut back on both considerably and it was perfect. Any more and it would have been too sweet! I used my homemade limoncello. The mascarpone adds a wonderful dimension to the whippped cream. I'll definitely make this one again.

The lightbulb has gone off above my head! Add Marscapone to my homemade whipped creams for all my favorite desserts! Chambord & marscapone whipped cream with my Chocolate Mousse, Grand Marnier with my Mango Mousse. How simple & yet so perfect! Now that I have rhapsodized on the marscapone in whipped cream, (why did I never see that before!?!) I used twice as much Limoncello & 1/2 the sugar. Was a little boozy, but was too sweet the other way. I also went for the fresh berries & skipped the hoo-ha of preserves & cooking it down. This time of year the blueberries are perfect & the Limoncello is a wonderful accent! Liked the Martini glass presentation suggested prior, and will also try the Pepperidge Farms little pastry puffs. I'll put a layer of the cream & a mound of berries with another tiny dollop of cream on top. Yum!

You absolutely don't need the preserves. I think it would take away from light, fresh flavor of this dish. Everyone loved it.

Easy, elegant, and delicious!! I didn't add preserves, and cut the sugar on the mixed berries. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. The only problem was that I should have doubled the recipe! Even my husband loved it, and he doesn't eat cheese. Served it to some jaded palates, and they all raved. Excellent. Do double the mascarpone mixture.

Having lived in Italy I was excited to see a recipe with Limoncello (which I make from scratch at home). I followed the directions carefully and it was TERRIBLE! Why you add a 1/2 cup of sugar to fresh berries AND perserves is a mystery to me - it was horribly sweet (and I like sweet things!) and the sugar never desolved - so it tasted grainy. The only decent thing was the whipped mascarpone cream and even that I think had slightly too much Limoncello added. I will NOT do this again. Sorry.

Fast and easy to make and wonderful for the summer. Used whatever mix of berries looked good at the market. And now I FINALLY have something to do with that bottle of Limoncello I bought in Italy!

Haven't tried this, but I've made something very similar with Strawberries and Gran Marnier Mascarpone. I'm curious though -- If everyone who rated this gave it "4 forks" ("a dish beyond compare"), why isn't if reflecting that 100% would make it again? Does percentage come down if people don't check the "Would you make this dish again?" option?

Well I guess I changed it quite a bit. Used rum and red currant jelly with the fruit and instead of limoncello in the whipping cream used lime juice. But was enjoyed by all. Only used raspberries and blueberries and saved some to decorate on the top.

I made this for a small dinner party with fresh berries of the summer (blueberries, raspberries and blackberries)...it was a huge hit! I might cut down on the sugar in the preserve mixture. Loved the mascarpone-lemoncello cream mixture! I used Luigi's homemade limoncello we brought back from Positano, Italy!

Excellent, but I make it with 1% white cheese (goat), and no whipped cream, just goat or sheep yogurt. I leave out the marcarpone, and the preserves plus sugar.The limoncello is weet enough-and it becomes dietetic!

I've made this recipe twice in the last few weeks to rave reviews. What a delightful summer dessert! It makes a beautiful presentation served in a martini glass. I omitted the raspberry preserves to the berry mixture...the berries I used were so delicious, I didn't want to ruin their taste with the preserves. I've packed it up and brought it to a friend's dinner party with great success. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I can't believe no one has reviewed this recipe!! My daughter brought me some Limoncello from Italy, and I had been saving it for something special. This recipe was it!! I made my own version of mascarpone, as I cannot buy it in my town. Other than that, I made the recipe as directed, and it was so delicious that I ate some for breakfast the next day. Very simple, but a fabulous flavor--one of the best things I've ever tasted.
