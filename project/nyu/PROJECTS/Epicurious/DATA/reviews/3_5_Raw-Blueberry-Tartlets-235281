This is not an indulgent dessert but it is also not "health-food ___" It is an inspired combination of some of my favorite healthy foods; the perfect guilt-free treat at the end of a summer meal.

My family and I thought it was exceptional...the flavors were bright. The portion was satisfying. It kept well. Sure, making the crust was a pain, but it was worth it.

The blueberries and dressing were alright, but the crust was sort of yucky. I like all the ingredients separately but together in this recipe they tasted, in my husband's words, "like some kind of natural health-food ---"
