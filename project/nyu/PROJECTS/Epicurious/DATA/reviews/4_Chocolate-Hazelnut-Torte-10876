i've been making this since it was first printed too, and it's always a hit. Like others have said, you can do a lot with this recipe, but it's terrific just as written. I do cook it for less time.

Convection oven at 375 for a half hour is perfect.

I've been making this since it first appeared in Gourmet in 1995. It had been a while, and decided to make this last weekend for a dinner party; specifically for a guest who didn't care for fruit desserts. I baked it for 35 minutes on convection. It was perfectly done; moist in the center with a great texture. One of my guests was a former restaurant owner, and he was impressed with this. Highly recommended for any event where you want to have a show-stopping dessert. I'm making it again today!

I was looking through my recipe box for a dessert and noticed that I've had this recipe for almost 10 years, now. I have made this over and over and over again. I've given tortes as gifts, brought them to parties and birthdays, and it's been the signature dessert for my Thanksgiving dinner every year. My family goes NUTS for this torte. My friends think I should SELL these tortes. I've made them with chopped hazelnuts on top, ground hazelnuts on top, no nuts on top, swirly designs, smooth and flat, if I can dream it up, I've done it. It is incredibly good with whipped cream. It is fantastic all by itself. It's not too sweet. I absolutely reduce the baking temp to 360 and bake for 40 minutes only. It freezes perfectly. Best of all, it is very easy. The first time I made it, I was pretty inexperienced and I made it with no trouble and it turned out perfectly. Now I can practically do this with my eyes closed. So thanks Gourmet! And yes, I WILL be making this again!

I took the cake out at 40min and it was already burnt! So I cut off the burnt bits and made a trifle with raspberry sauce and whipped cream.

Wow - turned out great even though I did everything wrong! I didn't leave time for the tort to cool before adding the glaze. Only had a 10 inch spring form pan so I reduced the oven temperature by 15 degrees as suggested by another reviewer, and baked for 30 minutes only. Yummmy!!!! Garnished with chopped hazelnuts on top rather than on the sides, since my serving plate has a rim and I couldn't access the sides very well. It looked lovely nonetheless.

Just another note... do NOT cook it the full time, I cooked it about half, and it came out fine.

This is an exceptional recipe. The cake itself may not be extremely sweet, but the flavor is amazing. I used a slightly different glaze, with 3tbs butter, 3tbs cocoa, 3tbs water melted, cooled, and then 1 1/2 cups icing sugar and 3/4tsp vanilla. This scrumptious easy sweet glaze made it sweet enough for me. I have made this a few times now, and everyone loves it. Well worth the work.

I made this for a friend who remembered a chocolate hazelnut dessert I'd made and wanted it for her birthday. This wasn't what she remembered, but all agreed it was fantastic. Definitely one to make again. Easy, delicious, looks great.

I made this recipe years ago for my cooking class final project in high school. It came out so great that even other teachers got wind of it and asked for a piece. By the time I got it home, there was barely left for my family to try. So, I'm very excited to find this recipe again so I can make it for my next family gathering!

I made this fabulous torte for gourmet club and it was a big hit. After reading the other reviews re: bake time..I decided to bake it for 35 mins. and even though the tester came out a little wet...it set up fine and was perfectly moist!

Rating: 3
I only baked this for 25 minutes, and it was just enough, any longer and the top/bottom would have burned. I was expecting a more chocolately flavor, since that is what I was used to with other flourless tortes, but this was gobbled up at a New Years party for that very reason apparently -- everyone loved it BECAUSE it wasn't so sweet and had the hazelnut flavor which was different. Great for a party and would definitely make again!

Everyone else seemed to like this more than I did. I expected a more intense chocolate flavor from the torte. I followed the previous suggestions and lowered the oven temp and cooked it for about 40 minutes. Texture was perfect.

I liked the taste but not the texture. It always ends up having a fudge like layer at the bottom and not very spongy. I dont know if its supposed to be like that. I've tried 3 times and do fold in the whites carefully. So somethings got to change to make it more spongy. Otherwise it turns out well.

I've made this torte 5 or 6 times now and every time I do, people ooh and ahh over it. I love hazelnuts and chocolate so this allows me to wallow in both. I highly recommend this dessert.

Good dessert, easy to make yet impressive. I too baked it at a lower temperature and for a slightly shorter time. (I also used a 9" pan, as that was the smallest I had.) Definitely will make again!

This recipe is wonderful. As past reviewers suggested, I dropped the temperature 15 degrees and baked it for 40 min. PERFECT! Moist, dense, delicious. I also toasted extra hazelnuts, skinned them and placed them all over the top of the torte, in 4 circles with a nice big onbe in the middle. I might add some frangelico next time to the ganache. This is a refreshing chocolate dessert as it is not so sweet that it makes you feel ill. Highly recommended. We served it with coffee ice cream. Enjoy!

Watch your baking time - I checked at 45 minutes and the cake was slightly burnt. I will make this again, but cook for less than 45 minutes.

I made this today for my Mom's birthday tomorrow. It came out beautiful, but I'll have to wait to cut it to see if it is at all dry. I am a chef by trade but NOT a pastry chef (I avoid fancy desserts like the plague!)so I rarely attempt desserts. Of course, that being sid, I decided to try mu hand a applying edible gold leaf to the glaze after it set. Hmmm...much harder than it looks folks but it worked out okay. I think the 23 karat sprinkles/flecks would be easier and look just as good. The sheets are hard to work with (and $$$)I had no sicess trying to "gild" a few hazelnuts for garnish. Thank goodness its for my MOM, she'll love it anyway, you know moms!

Enjoyed this dessert. Baked it for 40 minutes and it was well done around the edges. I might bake it for a little less time, but would definitely make it again. The hazelnut taste is just right without being overwhelming.

I had a similar recipe from 1988 Bon Appetite. I could not find it in the archives so I used this recently. The aspect of the other recipe I carried to this one is to melt raspberry jam and spread it on the cake and stick it in the freezer for about 5 minutes before it is glazed with the ganache. It really helps with the finish of the torte and provides another wonderful layer of flavor.

Great dessert. Beautiful and easy. A new add to the Christmas Eve repetoire.

Very good and easy to make ahead. I had everything but the nuts in the house. The next day my husband ate all the left overs. He says it is very rich and recomends that one doesn't eat half a torte at one sitting. ;)

I have made this over and over for parties - it has become a signature dish and is always requested. It really is easy - and I am not a great baker. It turns out well every time for me.

Very delicious! I've had similar cakes made with almonds, but I prefer this one, as the almond is my least favorite nut. I made this for a birthday club at work, and the recipient and every else liked it. I would agree about reducing the oven temp and cooking time. Served with "whipped cream" straight from the can!

I thought this recipe was wonderful, and although it was time consuming it was not all that difficult. I even made it in an 8inch springform, since that's what I had on hand, and with a slight ime adjustment it came out quite well. I brought this dessert to a family dinner and it was the most impressive dessert there.

I made this for my mom's birthday dinner and everyone loved it. It was easy to make and looked like a pro had decorated it. I lowered the temp and lessened the cooking time too, and my cake was very moist. I served with sweetened whipped cream (sugar & vanilla).

Absolutely delicious. Easy and fun to make. I took the advice of Westford, MA and reduced the temp and cooking time. It turned out wonderfully moist. Didn't bother to wait for the glaze to set. Next time I will for a different presentation. Yum.

I've made this for several dinner parties. Good cooks beg for the recipe, and non-cooks just sit in wonder, it's that good! Not sickeningly sweet, unlike most chocolate desserts. Personal observations: if I don't reduce the cooking time 5 minutes below the recommended minimum, and also reduce the temp by 15 degrees, it comes out too dry. Several attempts show that the more moist, the better. Also, the glaze takes a LOT longer to set than the recipe says, unless you want to just let it drip down the sides and not adhere at all.

I made this recipes for our wedding anniversary party. Everyone loved it. I will definately make this again and again. It was very easy to make and the results are decadent. For an addional touch I added ground roasted hazelnuts to the whipped cream.

I really enjoyed this dessert and the hazlenuts added a lot to it. However, it was not very sweet. I would change the type of chocolate used in the batter or sweeten the glaze

If you love chocolate and hazelnuts this is the torte for you. I have made it several times and everyone has raved at how delicious it is. It's a simple torte to make and looks like you've spent a lot of time and effort to produce. My boyfriend has now decided that this is his favorite chocolate dessert. If you cut it into individual serving slices and wrap them they freeze very well and you can have a piece whenever you want. That is, provided there's any left over. Oh so yummy.

I made this as the dessert for a dinner I made for my boyfriend, and even I was impressed with how it turned out. It was perfect. I served it with whipped cream (slightly sweetened, and with just a bit of vanilla), dusted with cocoa powder. The only thing I changed was adding 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the glaze, to boost the flavor a bit. This is definitely going into my regular rotation.

I made this as a dessert for company. Everyone swore I bought it at a gourmet store. Only when they were shown the recipe and the baking pan did they believe it was homemade. I served it with a napping of raspberry puree and a touch of unsweetened whipped cream - a definite repeat!

I made this cake last night and ate a small piece for dessert. I gave the rest to my boyfriend to share with his friends at work. At 10 this morning, he called to say that he'd accidentally left the cake on the subway on his way to the office. But you know what? This cake is so delicious, and so easy, that I really don't mind making it over again tonight.

I made this torte for a co-worker's birthday and her boyfriend said that it was the best cake he had ever eaten. I too had difficulties finding hazelnuts but the end results were well worth the search.

This was very good, but I had problems finding hazlenuts in the local supermarkets. I substituted walnuts, however, and everyone enjoyed it.

I have made this recipe many times over the last six years. Excellent. Relatively easy to make. Always a big hit with the crowd. One note: it is a VERY RICH torte. People generally will want small pieces of this torte.

This dessert was served at a birthday dinner party in Grand Junction, Colorado in February 1998 and it was an absolute hit! It would go well with a bottle of 1995 Whidbey's Washington State port. - from a faithful Gourmet subscriber.
