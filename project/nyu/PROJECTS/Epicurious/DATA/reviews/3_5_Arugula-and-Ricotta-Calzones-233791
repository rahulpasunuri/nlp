This was easy to make and was very good. My neighbor said it was the best calzone she ever ate. I rated it a little lower because I used whole wheat flour for the crust. That turned out to be a little heavy in texture and flavor for the filling. Although I prefer to use whole wheat, if I make this again I may use half whole wheat and half white flour, or perhaps try a puff pastry. The filling is excellent. I used baby arugula from my garden, and baked the calzones on a pizza stone.

I agree that frozen puff pastry is the way to go. I used fresh buffalo mozrella instead of regular which makes it creamy. Pine nuts and a pinch red pepper flakes add a lot. Increased the Parmesan too. Very easy and delicious.

It is wonderful. I barbecue chicken and add to mixture. It is a family favorite.

This is fantastic. I followed the recipe, except I used puff pastry for the crust and it came out soooo good. I will definitely make this again. I highly recommend the puff pastry.

This was unbelievably simple to make. It turned out to be much better than I had expected. Even my 4 yo even ate it, and he hates anything green!

Made this with milk turkey italian sausage (also TJ's herbed dough) and it was terrific!

Sauteed garlic, prociutto in olive oil, added steamed broccolini instead of arugula. Used more mozzarella & parmesan. Brushed with olive oil prior to baking. Used Trader Joes herbed dough. Serve with spaghetti sauce.

As expected, made several modifications: I made my own pizza dough, put a smear of homemade pesto in the calzones, added some proscuitto. Very good, but not superb. Pesto really added a lot to the flavors. Served with a green salad and a glass of red--easy, casual meal.

Delicious! We added some chopped sun-dried tomatoes, used the whole darned egg, and ramped up the ricotta and parm-reg while using less Jack cheese (no mozzarella on hand). And our arugula was mature. One suggestion: for a shinier crust, brush with something ... maybe oil or egg?

I thought this recipe was easy to make. I used the Trader Joes pizza dough and added Prossciutto and that was good. I think that pinenuts might make a good addition and some kind of sauce because it is a bit dry.

I followed the recipe but added a few slices of proscuitto but something was still lacking. I think they needed more cheese. Will try again adding more ricotta.

These calzone were a big hit. Using Trader Joe's pizza dough made it very easy. I do agree some type of meat could make a nice addition. Maybe some prosciutto sauteed a bit or as the other reviewer suggested pancetta. Will definately make these again.

kind of bland...we joked that it could use pepperoni, but really, some pancetta would be nice. Might make again as tiny hors d'oeuvres if I can come up with a nice dipping sauce.

These calzones are wonderful. The blend of cheeses and the arugula were great. Simple to make. I didn't change anything except I used the pizza dough from Trader Joes. We enjoyed making and it was delicious.
