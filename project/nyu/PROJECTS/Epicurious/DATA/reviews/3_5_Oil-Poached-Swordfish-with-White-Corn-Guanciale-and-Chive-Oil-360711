I really don't like swordfish that much - almost every preparation I've ever had of it has yielded not quite unappetizing but certainly uninteresting dishes. This is as close as I've come to a really outstanding swordfish preparation. Had to buy the amazingly fresh, exquisitely beautiful swordfish in the morning's farmers market - and this was the most interesting recipe we could find to make it. I wasn't happy about 'wasting' the oil, but we were able to save the now Mediterranean-flavored oil for another day. The corn mixture was nothing short of amazing, made with harvested-in-the-morning Jersey white sweet corn ('always a revelation' said the husband). Only the chive oil was a bit of a disappointment as it seemed not to add much. The fish was prefectly moist and delicately delicious. We're sold on poaching in oil.

This was the final showstopper of a night of all dishes featuring locally-made guanciale. I was busy in the kitchen, but I could hear the groans over the din! We served everything in hotel pans so the 15 guests could serve themselves; when people told me how great it was, I said, yes, I saw you sticking your fork directly into the pan and eating from it, and then heard you groan some more! Two of them, in fact said, "I don't even like swordfish, but I loved this!" I used an unfiltered Sicilian olive oil called Frantoia which was really pricey at $29 a bottle, but I think it really made a difference. We were making up a double batch so we went through two whole bottles and even part of a third! At least the owner now has some great lemon-infused oil to use another time. Buon appetito!

I have to say that I love this recipe...with some changes. Instead of poaching the swordfish, I barbarqued it. I did the rest of the recipe per instructions and it as great! The flavors of the corn, guanciale (I used pancetta) and chive oil were outstanding. I will definitely make this recipe again!

Instead of poaching the swordfish, I barbaqued it and did the remainder of the recipe per the instructions. It was GREAT and got rave reviews. I will make this recipe over and over again.

The corn/bacon portion and chive oil was amazing, and I'll definitely be making that again. However, although poaching the fish was delicious, I don't think it's worth the waste of oil or extra fat it adds. I'd recommend pansearing the fish rather than poaching it

With only one rating of two forks among the 4 reviews, and no one stating that this is a "good" or "great" recipe, and the statement that "0% would make it again,' how can you (Epicurious) state that the user rating is 3 forks?

Boris, you need to do some research. What you have posted here is not accurate.

While I haven't cooked swordfish in this manner, I did do a salmon a while back. To be honest, I found it to be a waste of both a bottle of oil and a good piece of fish. The oil poach just didn't add anything to the flavor. I do appreciate the tip on the evoo though. I did not know that about heat. I have been using it all along in sautee and such. Will switch to regular olive oil.

I'd recommend replacing Extra Virgin Olive Oil for Virgin Olive Oil for the poaching element. Extra Virgin Olive Oil becomes a trans-fat and loses all its good health properties - antioxidatant - at 100 degrees; regular Virgin can take up to 400 degrees before doing the same thing. Extra Virgin Olive Oil is one of the best things you can use to drizzle, but it should never be subjected to heat.

I'll be interested to see additional reviews of this recipe. The bacon/corn portion of the recipe was quite delicious. However, the oil did not "simmer" at all in the oven. It was cooked after the time allotment so maybe the simmering wasn't necessary. I felt poaching it in some other type of liquid, barbecuing, or a saute would have been better. It was also quite a lot of olive oil to squander all at once. It was moist, as the recipe stated, but rather oily.
