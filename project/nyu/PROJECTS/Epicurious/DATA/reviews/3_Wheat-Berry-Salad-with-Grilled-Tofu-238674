I'm not so sure about this flavor combination.

Great recipe - that I only sort of followed. The vinegrette was excellent - as described except with sherry vigegar instead of red-wine because that was all I had, and added a few cloves of garlic, fresh thyme, and fresh sage. I didn't use the mint. I didn't bother roasting anything, but did the wheat berries with sauted celery, zucchini, cabbage, and kalamatas. Tofu was a little bland because I did a poor job pressing it, but served it with arugula and fresh tomatos on top. I recommend adding herbs and garlic if you think it is bland as is.

Lovely recipe. Next time I'd leave out the mint. The vinaigrette could use a little something else... needs a bit more flavor. Other wise very healthy and great.

I loved this recipe - but am very flexible when cooking. I think someone looking for "quick" who follows recipes to a "T" might panic when seeing this. I loved the vinaigrette and made extra for future use (and doubled the amount of wheatberries cooked for the freezer). I also left out the olives and celery- after the chewiness of the wheatberries I couldn't imagine celery too. I also used green peppers instead of yellow - but loved the mint. All in all, a bit of work but even my carniverous aunt loved the tofu!

The marinade is great and very easy to make. I will definitely be preparing this again soon. Although I grilled the tofu this time, I'm sure it will also work well baked in the marinade. Yum!

I will admit that it was a bit odd all put together, but it was still very good. I did find it odd being categorized as quick, but since I had wheat berries in my freezer (I made a large batch a few months back), it didn't take me too long. I just thawed the wheat as I marinated the tofu. The best part of it though was probably the dressing.

There is a lot of good in this recipe, but I find it neither quick (as it is categorized to be) nor harmonious. The components are good, but I'm not sure I would put them together in this way. I should note, however, that I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I didn't use mint because I found that weird and I didn't have fresh mint on hand. I ditched the celery and I also didn't grill the tomato because that's not how I roll.... That said, the vinaigrette was lovely. Wheat berry, where have you been all my life! ? I will definitely be doing more experimentation with this chewy grain, but I won't be jumping at the chance to make this version again.
