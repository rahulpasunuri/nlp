I made this for our Easter dinner dessert yesterday and it was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and the pie turned out beautifully. I'm not sure why so many people had trouble with the filling coming out runny or soupy; I can only guess they didn't cook the yolk/milk mixture at a high enough temperature for long enough?

Followed the recipe exactly as written and it came out just fine (better than other recipes I've tried). Simmering the egg yolk and cornstarch/water/milk mixture for that three minutes really thickens it.

If zero forks was an option, I would rank this a zero. I wish I had read the comment section first, but because it is so highly rated, I didn't think it necessary. Like everyone else, I ended up with lemon soup. I was time, money, and food on this worthless recipe. Either there is not enough cornstarch or a direction step is missing. I made this as a gift and am embarrassed to have given this mess to someone.

How can people give this recipe positive reviews at the same time say it DOESN'T WORK? I foolishly didn't read the comments before wasting an afternoon making 3 pies with this useless recipe. If you need to change the recipe for it to work, then it is not a good recipe. DO NOT USE THIS RECIPE.

For those that are making lemon soup instead of pie, you must get the temperature of the yolks above 160. If they aren't, the amylase in the yolk will liquify the corn starch. To be safe, bring the filling back to a boil after tempering the yolks and mixing them back in.

Well, I agree with a few others. I made this recipe two years ago. It was my first attempt to make a lemon meringue pie without mom's help. It was delicious, SOUP! I had to toss it out. Tonight I will try this again. Perhaps I did not cook the lemon pie filling long enough? Thanks for the posts. Some of you got this right. I'll pay attention to your recommendations. Perhaps tonight I will succeed!

America's Test Kitchen uses almost this exact recipe - but they use six yolks instead of four and add a little vanilla to the meringue. I think those alterations make this pie pretty perfect. Plus, those two extra egg whites mean more meringue.

Okay, so... First time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly and created a beautiful and delicious... lemon merengue soup. It having been my first time making lemon merengue pie, I chalked this up to a mistake in my own technique. Yesterday for my dad's birthday I followed the recipe, changing it in accordance with comments (less sugar, less lemon, 7 spoons of cornstarch) and even made a few changes of my own such as using heavy cream instead of milk to make it creamier. The pie came out absolutely PERFECT... and SOUPY. Does anyone know if I'm doing something wrong? The flavor of this pie is absolutely perfect, and the meringue is easy and tasty, but there seems to be no way to use this recipe without creating soup filling! Next time I'm going to leave out the 1c water completely and only use heavy cream and an extra egg yolk.

This pie recipe is delicious. Personally I like to reduce the sugar in the filling and the meringue so it's very tart. Also increase the egg whites that there is a lot meringue.

The only reason I'm not giving this 4 forks is the directions - they're not as clear as they should be, and one of the ingredients needs review. I followed the directions exactly and, like other reviewers, ended up with a lovely crust and a beautiful meringue with a fabulous-tasting soup between. I will make it again, but this time will up the cornstarch to 6 Tbs as recommended by others, and cook the lemon mixture until it's thick. I suspect that'll end up with a beautiful pie. Oh, and if you want to use a graham cracker crust instead of fiddling with the pie crust, for heavens sake go ahead. Too many people might miss out on making this pie if they're leery of making the crust, and that would be a shame.

I used this recipe for my first try at making LMP and it was delicious. I used homegrown myers lemons and they really made the flavor fantastic. I found that the four egg whites made a small meringue, so I will definitely be adding more for next time. Other than that absolutely loved it!

Rating: 4
Great recipe. Only changes (based on other reviewers' comments) were to add two more egg yolks for the filling (and whites to the meringue), keeping in mind that we have our own chickens and they lay small eggs, and to add 7 tablespoons of corn starch and 2/3 cup of lemon juice instead of a half-cup. I also cut down the sugar by about 1/4 cup. Be sure to let the pie cool for several hours so it will set properly. This is a definite keeper.

Awesome! First time I made this recipe I didn't have an electric beater and it literally took me an hour and super bicep strength to whip the meringue to proper consistency. Thank goodness my mom got me a beater for X-mas. Thanks Mom! Anyway, I have made this recipe several times and the first time I made it I thought it was too sweet. I make it now so its the perfect consistency between sweet and tangy. I use 2/3 cup lemon juice instead of 1/2 cup, and then to balance it out I add 7 tbsp. of cornstarch instead of 5. I use a little more lemon zest than it calls for. Make the meringue first!!! Then, have your other ingredients ready to go, have your lemon juice squeezed and ready to be poured, have your zest grated, have your egg yolks (which should already be together in a bowl as leftovers from the meringue) whisked. When you have stirred your milk mixture over the heat and it boils, pour some of it into the egg yolks and mix those up, before pouring it back into the milk mixture. Once everything is mixed together pour it into the pie shell and immediately put the meringue on top before sticking it all into the oven. PERFECT! DEEEEE-LICIOUS!

This recipe is a really great way to learn a basic LMP recipe, but for a truly exceptional LMP, make note of the following: - Meringue doesn't work on a humid day, so... check the weather - This pie must be CHILLED before serving, so the lemon custard can set - Use FRESH SQUEEZED LEMON JUICE from lemons, not storebought bottled lemon juice. It makes a huge difference - Do not omit the lemon zest. It's a pain in the butt to grate those lemon peels, but the added flavor is much, much worth it - If you are going to reduce sugar, reduce it in the CUSTARD portion of the recipe, not the meringue portion - A graham cracker crust is all-wrong for LMP. It kills the subtlety of the lemon meringue flavor blend. Some comments suggest using a graham cracker crust... I say: sure, go ahead, and why don't you add some chocolate syrup and rainbow ice cream sprinkles to the pie too. KEEP IT SIMPLE - Definitely seal the meringue to the pie crust (even the pie plate) while you're spreading it, or else the meringue layer can shrink or even slide off - Make sure that after adding the sugar, you whip the meringue to good stiff peaks. After spreading it on the pie, you can texture the top of the meringue with the tip of a butter knife, before baking it. Give it a bit of soft, spike-y texture. - For the kinds of pie I make, I found this recipe to be a little scant. For a nice, robust pie, increase the recipe by a whole egg, another tablespoon of cornstarch, and another splash of milk. - Use your tastebuds to determine the proper amount of lemon juice. A lemon meringue pie should have a tart custard and a sweet meringue. Even after upscaling the recipe 20%, I found that the custard still wasn't lemony enough. Don't be afraid to add a little more lemon juice and zest The custard WILL set up if you cook it properly and give it enough time to chill YUM

This pie is a holiday favorite. I make it every year when we travel to Cannes for New Year's. We always have a little trouble with the cream of tartar, which does not seem to have an equivalent in France. The intense lemon flavor is a big part of the appeal, and the merinque makes it seem fancy.

Awesome recipe! Family loved it! I used 6 tablespoons of corn starch but don't think it was necessary as pie set up nice without refrigerating. I used Crisco piecrust recipe.

This recipe was far less complicated than I had expected. I used less sugar overall- 3/4 in the custard and 1/4-1/3 C in the meringue. The get a full 1/2 C of juice (with the bulk of the pulp removed) I juiced 2 1/2 lemons and also used the zest of 2. Used frozen crust which I stabbed repeatedly and prebaked in a 400 oven for 15 minutes or so. I cooled the crust before I the hot custard and let that sit in a rack followed by the fridge for an hour or so before the meringue. After baking for 15 min in a 350 I oven I let the meringue sealed pie cool on the counter and then the fridge until fully cool and ready to eat. The result was the perfect summer pie. I couldn't serve the perfect stay-upright piece but it was refreshing and delicious.

Our results tasted great, yet the pie format was a fail. It turned into more of a meringue topped lemon soup. We should have read more of the reviews, so that we would know about the chilling for 6-8 hours to set the filling! Many people have commented along these lines, so hopefully someone will update the recipe accordingly!

Wow. Usually I agree with my fellow reviewers, but this pie was not at all to my taste. The texture was rubbery. Not firm. Rubbery. The flavor seemed ok, but I was so distracted by the texture I could hardly tell. 5 tablespoons of cornstarch is way too much. The recipe my friend uses requires only two and makes for a much more tender pie. Never again.

Very good and easy to make. I followed the exact recipe, although, I did make the pie crust, then meringue and then filling. I would add less sugar next time because we like ours more tart. Maybe 3/4c or even 1/2c possibly. I did have a tiny amount of liquid that came out when I removed the first piece. The taste and texture were very good and I will make this again!

Thanks to everyone's comments this recipe came out perfectly. Making the meringue before for the filling was a great suggestion, it made the whole process easier. I used the recipe's recommended amount of cornstarch and had no problems, it thickened up beautifully and quickly. Easy, fast recipe that tastes great.

Rating: 4
A great pie, but we did have to make it twice for it to turn out right. The directions aren't very clear, it's really important to carefully cook the filling until thickened before pouring it in the pie shell and cool it overnight; a careful reading of the reviews helped us avert disaster a second time. Everyone loved it though and we had a story to tell!

Rating: 3
A really great and simple recipe which never fails. What it doesn't mention for new cooks is to let the pie set in the fridge for at least 6-8 hours. Otherwise, the filling will fall apart. Also, be sure to seal in the filling by covering the edges well with the meringue topping - this will also prevent the meringue from shrinking away from the edges when cooling. NEVER COVER WITH PLASTIC WRAP

Excellent. The pie worked perfectly as written. It's a nice combination of creamy and tangy filling. I used Eureka lemons that are very tangy. I cooled it at room temp for 2 hours and refridgerated it for 5 hours. I was worried as the filling seemed loose when it went into the pie shell but it sliced perfectly after the chill time.

No matter what recipe you use, and trust me, after a few soupy ones and some research - this is what you need to do for a perfect pie: Get your ingredients assembled for the lemon mixture but make the meringue first. In order for the meringue not to weep, the pie filling has to be hot when you put on the meringue - the heat from the mixture sets the meringue. When you add the lemon juice and the butter, keep it on the heat and return it just to it is about to boil. Pour it in the pie shell and top it with the meringue, spread to touch the crust, and it will be perfect. One other thing, use a whisk when it first starts to thicken but then switch to a wooden spoon to stir it as cornstarch will break down with over beating and not firm up properly.

This recipe was excellent...the second time i made it. Being an amateur cook i didn't realize i should have let the filling get thick. I followed the recipe exactly (using a timer) and it came out soupy. Meringue was perfect, though. Second time around results were perfect...even got props from my kids! I did use 6 tbs of cornstarch as suggested and allowed to cook till thickened.

My first time making a meringue pie. I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of a premade crust. The flavor was wonderful, and the meringue turned out perfect, but the lemon filling was runny. I did not set it. I didnt know I was supposed to. I put it in the fridge immediately and we cut into it about 45 minutes later. But it is so tasty I dont expect it to last 24 hours. Im going to make it next weekend, read all the comments and hints, increase the cornstarch, let it set up, and see what happens.

Followed the recipe completely and I just had one slice five minutes ago. The filling wasn't runny, it was more like excess water came out of nowhere that filled the area where the slice of pie I took. I only set the pie for one and a half hours so that might've been why. I'll make another note tomorrow when I take it out of the fridge.

This is a great recipe! I followed it almost exactly (added a little extra lemon juice) and it turned out beautifully. I was a little worried about the filling running, since so many complained about that, but it wasn't a problem. I did let my pie sit for several hours since I made it in the morning, though, and I wonder if that made the difference. Also, my cornstarch is very fresh. I will definitely make this again. Maybe next week, in fact.

This had a great flavor, but I found the filling to be a little runny even though I used 6 tbsp cornstarch. I might not have let it set up long enough, so it could be user error. My kids were literally dancing around the kitchen waiting to eat it, so we jumped the gun on cutting it. The meringue came out fantastic. I was sure to fully cover the filling and had no weeping or anything. (I used a premade gluten-free crust, so I can't comment on the crust part of the recipe.) I will definitely make this again.

This recipe receives an A+. I made a few changes as was suggested. I used 6 T. cornstarch which seemed to be the perfect amount for a solid lemon filling. (My filling was not runny at all/even the next morning after refrigeration).Also I like it tart so I reduced sugar to 3/4c. and added juice of two more med. size lemons to the 1/2 c. lemon juice. I loved having the zest of the lemon and used the rind of 3/4 of a large lemon. For the merigue I placed a metal bowl with the metal mixers in the freezer while I was putting the ingredients together and placed the egg whites in a container in the fridge as well. I had heard chilling all of this helps the merigue. It all worked because I had a very high fluffy light merigue that did not weep or pull away from the pie filling or crust. Also I did not add salt to the merigue.For those that have experienced a runny filling I suggest you continue the filling mix on med heat longer than the recipe calls for. Keep stirring constantly and at one point you will see everything starting to "gel" and get thicker. You will need to judge for yourself from this point on how thick you want it. Too much and it will become rubbery but too little and you will have the runny problems others experienced. I've tried several recipes but this is the first one that has given me superior results. P/S Add the meringue to the filling while the filling is still warm and do not place the finished pie into the fridge until completely cooled off otherwise you will see moisture collecting all over the top of your pie.

First time I made it, the filling was too runny. I realized I probably didn't cook filling mixture long enough for cornstarch to thicken it. Made it again, but cooked the lemon filling till it thickened, and VOILA! A yummy and gorgeous looking pie. BTW, I used frozen pie shell, and it's just fine.

Rating: 4
I can't remember where I saw it or read it, but runny fillings are usually caused by using old cornstarch. (I believe it absorbs moisture or something and loses potency as it ages.) I've seen complaints about runny fillings affecting some (but not all) cooks for virtually every lemon meringue pie recipe I've ever read or used. Therefore, I'm guessing that the fault isn't in the recipes and tend to believe the cornstarch explanation. It's not an expensive ingredient, so starting with fresh cornstarch seems like a good way to increase the chances for pie success.

This pie was a request from my son's best friend, who had never had Lemon Meringue Pie before. My 61 year old partner, my 20 year old son, and his 19 year old friend couldn't say enough good things about it. My partner declared this "diner good." The filling was a perfect silky consistency and just the right amount of tartness, and the meringue literally melted in your mouth. A few notes: I used 6T of cornstarch and the grated rind of 3/4 of a large lemon for the filling and cooked it until it was nearly solid (not just thick), whisking it vigorously the entire time. I chilled the bowl, beaters, and egg whites prior to making the meringue, which I made in my stand mixer. While the pie was cooling, the meringue separated from the edge of the crust and I could see a little liquid, so I thought all was lost. NO INDEED. Other than a tiny bit of weeping, the pie is perfect. There aren't even any moisture droplets on the meringue the next morning.

Excellent recipe. i read all the reviews and made 2 pies, one with 7 TBL spns of cornstarch and one with 5. The 7 was a little to custardy and the 5 was just right. Follow the recipe, the pie was not runny and the meringue not weepy.

This pie is delicious! As suggested by a reviewer here I used 7 tbsp. of cornstarch. Still when I removed the filling from the burner it got very thin again. So I put it back on the burner and whisked it until it thickened up again no problem after that. The lemon flavor was very good too. I did get a little bit of liquid weeping from the Meringue but not enough to spoil the pie. We made 3 pies for our Thanksgiving dinner and this was the first choice by all and they loved it. Next time I will try using only 6 tbsp. of cornstarch which I think will work.

The meringue came out perfect. However the filling came out horribly runny. I tried following some recommendations and used 7 Tbsp of cornstarch instead of 5. This is the second time I've tried making this, and both times the filling was too runny. After letting the pie cool several hours, I sliced into it and had to literally drain out the runny filling. Only then was it edible. I see that others had a bit more luck then I did, but lots of other cooks had the same problem.

I looked at all the reviews and decided to use 7 T of cornstarch instead of 5 T. I knew that it would resemble more of a pudding than a lemon filling, but I was going for taste and set. I also reduced the sugar in the filling by 1/4 cup because I wanted my pie to be very tart. Turned out fanastic! Weeping is an issue when the whites are beaten until dry and then overcooked. Looks bad, but doesn't alter the taste much. I would use this recipe again with my modifications. Good luck making the pie...it really is simple, just measure out everything before you begin because it all goes so fast.

Wow!! This is one good pie! I'm new to baking from scratch and love lemon meringue, so I knew when I got my new mixer this would be the first thing I tried (I heard making this was difficult somewhere). I would have given it four forks, but the filling was a bit runny as explained before. Because I noticed that right off and didn't want to take any chances I thickened the filling with some more corn starch before putting it in the pie shell, and it came out perfect!! I was pleasantly surprised, this was a very easy recipe and not hard at all!!

I have made this recipe 3 times, and none of those 3 times did the filling ever get firm. It was very very runny. Basically like water.

So, if this recipe actually ever works, we will see how wonderful this pie tastes.

This was a great recipe for a lemon meringue pie (I'm giving it 3 and not 4 stars because I don't like meringue that much!) The pie crust was very nice, one of the best recipes I've seen for one. The only changes I made were to use slightly less sugar in the filling then called for. Also, I didn't have any cream of tartar...so I used 1/2 tsp of lemon juice (read somewhere on the web that you could replace cream of tartar with white vinegar or lemon juice). I set my mixer on HIGH...and had no problems forming stiff peaks. I baked the pie a a bit too long (the meringue wasn't very brown so I cooked it 5 minutes longer). The next day, I noticed beading (water droplets forming on surface of meringue). So don't overbake! Apart from that, great pie! The lemon filling needs several hours of cooling to firm up, so don't cut into it early (like i did).

I made this pie with Meyer lemons from my tree. I followed the filling recipe to a T with the exception of doubling the amount of lemon zest (I love lemon and my Meyer lemons are like rare jewels that I cannot waste!) I did not use this pastry crust recipe, preferring an all-butter crust. This was the first lemon meringue pie I've ever made. The flavore was AMAZING no doubt attributable to the Meyer lemons, but my pie was a weepy one. Despite the weeping, it was delicious and the weepy factor did not slow the guests from devouring every crumb. I was lucky to get a slice. I will be careful about overbeating and overcooking next time (thanks for the tip, Oakland cook) as i have 5 more lemons ripe and ready.

This came out perfectly (which is not a given with lemon meringue pie).

If you're worried about weaping meringue cheak out the recipe for lemon meringue pie on America's Test Kitchen website. It's the BEST.

Loved this pie! Tart, with lots of lemony flavor, just the way I like a lemon meringue pie to be. I just wanted to offer a possible solution to the "weeping" meringue. I looked at several recipes before choosing this one, and one recommended cooling the pie for three hours after removing it from the oven and before refrigerating it. I didn't have that much time, so cooled it for two hours instead. My meringue didn't weep at all. Maybe this was the reason???

Raliegh was right. I have made many lemon meringue pies and this was very runny. It looked perfect (was thick, so I don't think overbeating broke down the cornstarch...never heard of that!) until I added the lemon juice and it became too thin and did not thicken on cooling.

Wonderful! My husband is not big on lemon, but even he had no complaints and felt it was delish (and proved it by going for seconds). I made this in a 10" ceramic tart pan and it was just the most lovely and tasty pie ever. Even after cutting into it holds well and stays pretty the next day in the fridge. The person who had problems with runniness didn't cook the lemon custard enough (it should be almost alarmingly thick before you add the lemon). Also taste as you add the lemon so you are sure it won't be too lemony for you if you are worries about that-but remember it should be slightly more lemony than you like as the fluff will balance it out. I thought it was perfect as was though--not too much lemon at all! Also, do use the crust recipe that is suggested. It is very flakey and retards moisture extremely well--even though I substituted butter for the shortening (so a whole stick of butter in lieu of 6tbs and 2tbs shortening). It stayed together so well that I could easily have taken the pie out of the tart pan and had it freestanding! It is probably the best pastry dough recipe I have tried, and I have no problems doing pie crusts--this was just better. So over all this is a keeper!

About runny fillings: you will break down the cornstarch in this or in similar recipes if you overcook or overbeat the filling. Use a heavy saucepan and go easy. (Thank the Oakland Tribune and The Joy of Cooking for this tip.)

This is the best Lemon Meringue Pie recipe I have ever found. I make it quite regularly and it always turns out delicious. It's too bad Raleigh can't follow a recipe, but don't let that stop YOU from trying this! YUM!

Wondeful lemony taste! Cooking the lemon filling not the easiest for a beginner, but well worth the effort. Carefully bake the meringue, it's easy to burn. A keeper in my recipe box.

I've been cooking for over 20 years so I don't think I followed the recipe wrong, but after reading all the glowing reviews I wonder. The pie was horrible. It was very tart and runny. I cooked it twice as long as it suggested and it still came out a gooey mess. I felt it a waste of my time and ingredients. If I could give it negative forks I would. I threw the pie out it was that bad. It is probably the worst recipe I've ever made.

This was fantastic. I wouldn't change a thing about this whole recipe. The crust worked perfectly and the consistency of the lemon filling was good and cut really easily. I decorated the pie with orange lime and lemon peel shavings and served it to two professional cooks and they loved it. It has become a part of our recipe book for the catering service that I work for. Just one question. How do you cut the meringue without ruining it?

This is a wonderful and easy recipe. I've made it many times and it awalys comes out great. If you are looking for something different; after making the filling, let it cool then fold in the beaten eggs whites. You get a refreshing chiffon type dessert. No need for a crust, just pour into small dessert dishes and chill.

The filling was delicious. My lemon tree will produce this recipe many times over.

followed the other suggestions and added a bit more cornstarch, the lemon filling was very dense..next time would cut back just a bit on the sugar. although, i also had some liquid weeping after it cooled, but great pie...i used pre-made crust to save time and efford...great recipe.

Followed the recipe to a tee - except did add more lemon zest as recommended by other reviewers. Turned out VERY runny - apparently did not cook it long enough, though did exactly as recipe called for. Great flavor though!

Excellent recipe. Used this went I couldn't find my beloved Southern Living LEMON MERINGUE PIE recipe. As usual, everyone in my house raved about this pie.

Good recipe. However, I prefer more lemon taste. I would add another teaspoon of lemon rind (one more lemon). If the filling comes out runny, it is because you have not cooked the filling long enough for it to thicken properly. Make this pie for the day you will serve it - the crust does absorb the moisture from the meringue and become soggy. Enjoy!

My nephew was going into the Army and asked me to make him a lemon meringue pie. In the past I followed the recipe on the lemon pudding box. This time I thought special occasion needs special pie so I decided to make one of each. The boxed pie won ~ however, myself and the family chef preferred this recipe. Lighter and more fresh lemony taste. I will make this again even if only for myself.

I made this two days ago and found it to be very good. I will make again two weeks. And I will add more lemon juice and subtract some sugar. Had no problem with weeping...made sure the meringue was sealed to crust.

Great dessert. Only advice is to make sure you "seal" the meringue right up to the crust to avoid the "weeping." Stayed well in the 'fridge so don't be afraid to make this ahead.

Very yummy pie--this was my first time making a meringue and it turned out well. I used a different crust recipe (all butter) but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Next time I might reduce the amount of sugar in the filling a tad and add a little extra lemon juice. The pie appears to have held up well in the fridge overnight.

Deeeeelish!! I too found that the filling was runny and had to add probably another 3 or 4 tbsp. of cornstarch. I also added another egg white to the meringue and a little more cream of tartar to make a big, fluffy meringue. Also baked it another 5 minutes. Beautiful! Held up well overnight in the fridge.

I made this pie 2 days before serving it. It was great. The filling held up perfectly. I had made a different recipe a week earlier and it had been runny. This pie is so delicious. Everyone that ate it loved it! I will definitely make it again.

I used a bought crust and only baked it until it was almost done, so the final pie had a very flaky, delicate crust texture. I also added 3/4c lemon juice and 3/4c water, and it is quite tasty. It's so easy to make, I'd do it again.

The filling is a definite 4 forks, but since it doesn't hold up well I can only give it 1 fork. I made the night before Valentine's Day and by the time I served it; I had a gooey mess. The filling was runny and the crust soggy. I guess this pie has to be devoured right away; it's definitely not make-a-day-ahead-pie. I did use a prepared pie crust and the pie looked heavenly coming out of the oven. Too bad it didn't hold up.

Used this recipe based upon previous reviews. I have to agree that this is a wonderfully balanced Lemon Meringue Pie. The filling was superb and the meringue was just divine (I did use a pie crust recipe that I was more familiar with).

Delicious filling and meringue! I tried to make the crust but it didn't work out for me, I used a different recipe and the whole pie turned out wonderfully! I love the tanginess of it and it was quite easy to make!

This is the very first time that I have made a pie from scratch, this happens to be my husband's favorite pie. The pie was very simple to make and tasted wonderful. I did cheat a little and used and already prepared pie crust. I made this for one of the desserts for Thanksgiving, and got rave reviews.

My family and I loved this pie. It is sweet and tangy. I took other users comments into consideration, and used another meringue recipe. I omitted the cream of tartar and decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup. It was good, not weepy, and it lasts. I will defintiely make this pie again.

Wow, I actually made this pie and it came out just perfect, including the crust! The guests loved it, but the only bad part about it was that there were only two slices left! I was told that if you don't use the cream of tartar, your topping won't 'weep' as mine did.

Lovely, REALLY lovely. This is my husband's favorite dessert and now I have the perfect recipe to make it. He liked it even better than his great grandmother's recipe -- Oops! Grin!

Sometimes lemon pie can be cloyingly sweet. Not this one. The filling was on the tart side, balanced nicely by the light, slightly sweet meringue. No problems with runny filling. I love these old fashioned desserts! Comfort food.

YUMMMMY! to those whose filling is runny: gourmet recently demonstrated a huge variation in different measuring spoons. they use williams sonoma equipment in test kitchens, and i did too--with perfect results! or use a cup measure, where 5T=1/3 cup. about weepy meringue--this meringue isn't meant to last. for a sturdier, make-ahead meringue check out joy of cooking meringue recipe...

I found that the filling was very runny and I used the exact amounts as stated in the recipe. This was dissapointing especially when I laboured for 2 hours to creat an "original" lemon meringue pie. I will however try it again as the pastry is delicious and the inside tasted good...I will use less water for the filler though!

This recipe is great, but I always find that my meringue weeps once cooled. Fortunately, my crust is hard enough not to get soggy, but what am I doing wrong?

This really is a great dessert to make, it was one of the easiest too! The meringue and the filling (I cheated- bought a pre-made pie crust :))were divine, except the latter being a little too runny and soft. Will add more cornstarch to firm it up next time! Overall, an excellent recipe! Thanks!

Fantastic pie! The crust was buttery and flaky; the filling was tart and creamy. The pie held up well once cooled. The meringue formed a beautiful crown on the filling.

I love lemon meringue pie and this is absolutely the best I have ever made. I had leftover pie crust in the freezer - but next time I'll use the one included assuming it is as good as the filling.

This is the best lemon meringue pie! I loved it so much and my friends wanted to try so bad that I did a cooking class for them. Somehow the filling was too soft to cut the pie neatly, but they loved this recipe, too.

I can only speak for the filling and the meringue (I was bad and used a pre-made pie crust ;) however... Gorgeous presentation! The filling wasn't too tart or overly sweet - just right... and the meringue was so airy it melted in my mouth. Will do the crust next time.

Very good and beautiful dessert. Everyone loved it. Make sure your bowl for the egg whites is clean and dry, and make sure your egg whites are cold. This helps in making beautiful meringue. After placing meringue on the pie, take a spoon and shape the meringue. Enjoy!

This was one of the BEST pies I have had the pleasure of making as well as eating. I made this for company and all have said "they have never tasted one better, before or since". Highly recommend. Easy and fast,hardly any effort for the making of that desert that will be talked about long after the dinner party is over

Very good flavor. The first time I made it, it did not set. The second time I boiled it more than stated and it did set, but hardly filled the mold, and I used one exactly 10 inches. Please help.

Exceptionally good with fresh homemade lemons from California. Previously I made almost the same recipe without the milk and I prefer this one with the milk in the filling recipe.
