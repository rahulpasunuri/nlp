Brought to Easter dinner and everyone loved it. I usually make scalloped potatoes but these were easier and tastier.

The real reason for the cream cheese is that it tends to lighten up the potatoes. don't use the flavored kind nor the sour cream. add the butter first them a lesser amount than suggested of cream cheese. In another small saucepan was a small amount of cream or milk and add a few chopped green onions heat to boiing then remove from heat. Once potatoes are mashed with butter/cheese add scallions. Now, you will have great potatoes! don't forget the salt and pepper, preferably white.

This recipe is SO close to an old family favorite that called for 12 portions of Potato Buds made stiff. I made this souffle and found the salted boiling water very important. I also preferred fresh chives (about 2 Tbs). I'm making it again tonight with less salt and blue cheese and ham instead of the cream cheese!

I tasted this before baking it and thought it was great and flavorful, but after baking it was somewhat dull. Now I just make it as mashed potatoes w/o the eggs or baking and everyone loves it. That way I give it a 4 fork!

I liked the presentation more than the taste the first time. I replaced the sour creme with a sharp cheddar cheese and it picked up the flavor.

What a disappointment! Heavy and not much flavor. It reminded me of baked mashed potatoes with a slight sour cream and onion potato chip flavor. The family rated this a "complete flop."

I made this dish using Yukon Gold potatoes and roasted garlic whipped cream cheese. Everyone loved it and insist that I make it again!

Have made this for holiday dinners for years. I make it the day ahead...cover and chill. If to dry may whip in some milk before baking. Garnish with fresh chopped chives. Saves time for making other holiday side dishes!

I have made this recipe many, many times & my family adores it and looks forward to having it. We are New Yorkers, and there are restaurants galore that have wonderful mashed potatoes. But everyone always says that this recipe is the best.

This was a real disappointment. The flavor was ok, but the texture was very dry. No one in the family cared for it.
