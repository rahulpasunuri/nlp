Served this over baby greens with avocado and the grapefruit. In the dead of winter I left out the tomato and chose not to use the mushrooms. My guest and I absolutely loved it, as did my upstairs neighbor who is Thai. Not strictly "authentic" perhaps, but wonderful combination of some of my favorite flavors.

I have made this many times and love the flavors. I tend to skip the mushrooms and grapefruit. My family likes the vermicelli noodles swapped out with bean thread noodles. The clear, light noodles combine well with the cabbage. But it's the fish sauce, sesame oil, honey, soy and chile that makes this so interesting and flavorful. Love it.

Made this several times now and adjusted as I went along. Like others, if you like spicy you need to increse the Thai chilis -- I added 2 to the Marinade & 2 to the dressing -- with seeds. It had a very nice bite. Also, the Sesame Oil is waaaay to strong at 2 TBS ... I slowly have backed it off to about 1 TEASPOON !!

Very good overall as written. Next time I'll reduce the soy and sesame oil. And the salad needs more "stuff" I thought. I added napa cabbage, thinly sliced bell pepper and avocado at the last minute, but next time I'll likely throw in other complimentary veggies and peanuts too. I left out the tomato completely. It seemed odd and wasn't missed.

I used the steak on top of mixed baby greens..... I also thought the dressing was a bit overpowering with sesame so I added some canola oil. I also added some honey to the dressing as I felt it was missing something. My whole family loved it.

Used the marinade + some grapefruit juice -- about 1/4 of a cup -- to marinate some chicken. Can't say I followed the recipe exactly as far as measurements go. I knew it'd be too much for my four chicken thighs, so I scaled back and eyeballed everything. WOW! This is very flavorful and has a lot of different flavor notes to dazzle your taste buds. I highly recommend giving this one a try. Haven't made the actual salad, but the marinade is remarkably good. Can't imagine that the salad disappoints.

Made this marinade tonight with everything except ginger (didn't have any). Would advise to use food processor to chop the garlic, mint, cilantro and serrano pepper (definitely WITH seeds!) and whisk those into honey and other liquids in a separate bowl. Surprised that I didn't miss the ginger AT ALL. This recipe makes a LOT of marinade. I only used about 1/3 cup to marinate flank steak for 20 minutes before grilling. Thinly sliced the beef after grilling and spooned more marinade over the beef. Took about 3 T of marinade and mixed with a few splashes of sesame oil to make a dressing. Didn't use noodles, tomato, mushrooms or grapefruit. Just tossed dressing together with a mixture of baby spinach, hearts of romaine, torn mint, chopped cilantro and thinly sliced shallot. Served beef on top. YUMMO! And after all of that, I still have TONS of marinade left for other uses. Don't spoil such a wonderful marinade by bathing the beef in it before cooking and then having to throw it all out. Our (1.5 lb) flank steak was incredibly flavorful with a quick 20 minute pre- grill dip in about 1/3 cup, then using a few spoonfuls marinade spooned directly on after cooking.

The sesame oil overpowered the dressing for me, so I'd cut that in half, but I'm giving 4 forks for the marinade alone. That will be my go-to marinade for a while now. Doesn't need to be blended to be effective. Throw the marinated steak over any salad. Delicious.

Really good, interesting blend of flavours. I had to sub. . .orange slices in a can for grapefruit. . .also added grapes! Really good.

What a disappointment! This didn't remind me of thai food at all! Not only was it not spicy at all, but it was waaaay to tangy... the lime juice and the grapefruit overpowered the whole dish. Yuck.

Everyone loved this one. I needed enough for 3, so I doubled the size of the steak (and made HALF the marinade and marinated in a ziploc bag overnight). I didn't use mushrooms or grapefruit.

I prepared this recipe for a Christmas dinner - got lots of rave - the only think I changed I seeded the chile so it won't get too spicy.

This was very good. I used the flank steak, marianated overnight, and grilled as directed. I thought that there were too many flavors in the salad. The tomato seemed like it didnt belong, as did the mint. I will leave these out next time.

This recipe was fantastic! I'm surprised so few have rated it. I used more cilantro instead of mint and one tablespoon sambal olek instead of the serrano pepper in the marinade and it was perfect. I also used tenderloin, using the method of searing it for 3 minutes a side then finishing in a 250 degree oven for about 10 minutes. Added mixed salad greens as a base and fresh basil for presentation. This is really a 31/2 fork recipe but not in the four fork category due to something seeming off-balance in the dressing. (Maybe a little too much lime juice?) If you like Thai flavors, try it!

Yum! Made this for dinner and it was great. A fair amount of chopping, etc, but well worth the effort. I substituted tenderloin for the flank steak, and didn't pay much attention to the odd quanties called for, i.e. 1/4c tomato? 2T mushrooms? Who measures things like that? But the dressing and marinade were great. Maybe try topping with some ground peanuts next time.
