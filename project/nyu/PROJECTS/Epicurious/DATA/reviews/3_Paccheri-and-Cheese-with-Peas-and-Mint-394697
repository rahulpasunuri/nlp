So impressed! I first saw this in the march '12 copy of bon appetit and have been wanting to try it since. Little background; we are foodies and very comfortable with twists on classics and a twist this is. We have gotten tired of the classic betty crocker mac style and we were thrilled with the flavors. Mint was awesome and so was the lemon. Anyone who gave this a less than 3 fork was seeking something in the traditional realm and not open to diversity.

I had high hopes for this dish. The ingredients sounded like they would work so well together, but it was easily the worst dish I have ever made from epicurious. The ingredients didn't work well together, and left just a foul taste in your mouth. I followed the recipe exactly. I would not make this again.

My roommates and I put on some music and worked as a team to make this, so even though there were a lot of steps we breezed through them without too much difficulty. It came out wonderfully. I am a college student with a tiny oven (we call it an easy-bake oven) and sometimes I lack basic things like large bowls/pots to cook with as things get lent out and misplaced often. I constantly surprise myself and my friends with what we produce despite all that and this dish was definitely one of those surprise delights. I thought the mint was wonderful and think for those who thought it overpowering, too much was added. Will definitely have to make this again in the future!

Really nice dish with great flavors. The arugula and mint add complexity. I added hot Italian sausage to this, and it was a hit!

I thought this sounded like an ideal spring pasta dish with the peas and mint but it was a bit blah. There could have been more sauce and I also felt the mint was a bit overpowering. There is also a lot of prep work for this dish which I wouldn't mind if the end result was worth the effort..it wasn't.

A nice vegetarian main course, a little different than mac and cheese esp. with the mint flavor. Subbed spinach for the arugula and accidentally used twice as much ricotta (halved the recipe becasue it was for me and my husband only) and it came out nice and creamy. At half the recipe used an 8x8x2 glass baking dish and it was perfect. Great leftovers too! Will definitely make again for everyday dinners.

This sounded so good as it was filled with ingredients I love, but really wasn't too tasty and took a long time to make for mac and cheese. It was edible, but nobody in my family would eat the leftovers. I liked the idea of baking it in a springform pan, and it did slice into nice wedges, but the texture and flavor weren't impressive. The dabs of ricotta turned off my family. The flavor of mint overpowered the rocket. My family requested that I stick with the good old enhanced 1970's Betty Crocker version with cheddar cheese that I normally make. Sigh . . .

VERY yummy--added a bit more mint & lemon zest. Also substituted fresh spinach for the arugula, and made it in the casserole dish, not a spring form pan. A bit labor intensive, especially shelling the fresh peas, but worth it!

Interesting and colorful. The flavors come from the greens and lemon zest rather than any spice, so the overall effect is pretty subtle. Without the mint, this dish would be bland and boring, so don't skip it!

Made this as written and it was pretty, but not that great. Just good. Used fresh peas and only boiled 1 minute, but should have boiled longer.

I would like to include this dish in my menu for a dinner party I will be having next month. Can anyone tell me if this slices well? I want it to present well and am hoping it will not just crumble in pieces instead of slices. Thanks!!!!

This was a big hit! Next time I might leave out the mint and add green onions. We reheated it the second day and it was even better.
