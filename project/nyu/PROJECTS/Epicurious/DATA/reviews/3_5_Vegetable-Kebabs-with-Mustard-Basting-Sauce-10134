This is a great grilling recipe. I added small red new potatoes and blanched more than parboiling. I used metal skewers and that didn't work well with the baby carrots! The flavor is good, it's a quick recipe and the baby veggies are so cute! The mustard baste is a must.

I simplified this. Skipped the carrots and did not pre-cook anything. Used mushrooms, bell pepper, zucchini, and red onion chunks. Added a tad of garlic to the sauce as well. Mighty good!

This was delicious! My vegtables were not at all too soggy. I also added chicken chunks to the kebabs to up the protein-quotient. My only advice: make extra sauce because I always seem to run out early.

Boiling the squash did not seem like a good idea. They ended up being quite soggy, although I boiled for a couple of minutes fewer than suggested. The end result was so-so. Not sure the basting sauce enhanced the flavors.

Very colorful presentation and extremely tasty. This side was the hit of the meal.

This recipie was not only simple and quick but delicious. My husband loved it. We did things a bit to our own taste though using chicken, red onion, plum tomatoes, and green and red peppers on the kebabs. I also served it with saffroned jasmine rice - it was great.

I simply threaded squash, vidallia onion, red and gren peppers on skewers and grilled them with the basting sauce. My family raved about the flavor. It was quite good.
