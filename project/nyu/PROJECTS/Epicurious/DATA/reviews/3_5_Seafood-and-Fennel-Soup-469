Very nice soup, unfortunately I didn't have bacon which I'm sure would have added flavor that was lacking. The one problem I have with this soup was that it was a bit brothy for my taste. I drained a bit out and used an immersion blender for about half of it which much improved the consistency.

this is such a wonderful base for any seafood really. next time i'll make more and put it in the freezer so i can just add fish upon defrosting. great flavor. the fennel gives it a kick!

I used clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops and halibut, plus instead of regular canned tomatoes, I used fire-roasted tomatoes I found at Trader Joe's. Yummy.

This is a chunky, filling soup. I made most of it the night before, then heated it up and added the fish just before serving. The fennel adds a 'mystery' touch. We loved it!

I have made this soup twice, and each time to rave reviews. The second time, I made the soup the day before and added the fish right before serving and the flavors seemed much more prominent. Even the non-fish lovers were going for seconds. This is one of my all time favorite soups. Highly recommended (and certainly not "a waste of fennel" as one reviewer put it)

What did I miss here? I thought this soup was too tomato-EEE. It was a complete waste of perfectly good fresh fennel and fennel seeds. My suggestion, "Don't waste your time on this one."

The chopped bacon adds wonderful flavor, however, it didn't look appetizing to me. I removed it piece by piece. Next time, I'll fry the bacon slices whole and remove them before serving. Will certainly make again, and freeze as other reviewers suggest.

This is one of the best fish and tomato-based soups that I can find on epicurious. We used shark and grouper because that is what we had, and we used one can of diced toms and about 3/4 lb of halved cherry tomatoes from our garden (and the 8 oz tom sauce called for). It was fabulous!

I used green bell pepper instead of the red. I also omitted the mushrooms because I didn't have any, although I know they would make the soup better. What I like most about this recipe is that the fennel and fennel seeds add a wonderful change in flavor. I make it without the fish and then freeze it into portion size - then I reheat it whenever I have fish to add to it. It's a great shortcut for a satisfying fish soup.

This was the best fish soup I've ever had. I added a few shrimp and some diced carrots and it was excellant

My family loves this recipe. The fennel is very mild tasting--not at all overwhelming. It is easy to make a large batch of the soup, separate it into meal-sized servings and freeze it before adding the fish. That way you can defrost it and add any type of fish without loosing the taste.
