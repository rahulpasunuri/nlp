LOVE. I used Sambal Oelek chili paste instead of fresh chile, dried cilantro instead of fresh, and one acorn squash plus one small pumpkin.

Wow - I didn't know I would love this so much! The bright, spicy citrus vinaigrette played against the sweet, buttery caramelized squash in such a fantastic way. I made this twice in one week, which is something I very rarely do with a recipe. I just had to have it again! The second time I made it, I cut the skins off before roasting, which made it a little easier to eat.

Rating: 4
This was delicious and I will make it again for sure! My fiance and I were blown away by how buttery it was without using an ounce of butter. The vinaigrette is absolutely amazing and I wish I had made double the amount so I'd have some leftover. Can't wait to try it on other veggies or even chicken/fish. I didn't cut the squash into wedges (just halved it) and I used cayenne pepper and paprika instead of a chile. I didn't really want spice, I love cilantro and garlic with lime so I was excited about those flavors. The squash came out perfect and tender. I only wish I had made more!!!

I guess one has to like acorn squash to like this recipe. Apparently, I don't. The vinaigrette was fine. It was an easy recipe.

Rating: 4
Absolutely fantastic!!! I used one pan and flipped them half way thru so both sides were a deep golden brown. My whole family raved. Quick and easy too. Double the sauce, because it is so very good. I used the leftover sauce on eggplant roasted with onions and tomatoes the next night. Delicious!

Rating: 4
Easy to make and utterly delicious! The next day for lunch I served leftovers as a sandwich on toast along with hummos, greens, and avocado. To DIE for! I will make this recipe often. 2 minor things---(1) you do not need 2 pans - 1 is sufficient; (2) I was confused about the cutting instructions, because it says to lay the squash "cut side down," but since acorn squash is curved and you can't really face the pieces downward -- unless I cut it up wrong. No matter: I just lay the pieces on their sides and it was perfect.

This is fantastic! It's definitely my go to vegan and pot luck dish. I serve the squash chopped into 1" cubes instead of wedges and I shorten the time in the oven to 20 minutes. I also double the vinaigrette because it is so good!

the chili vinaigrette is amazing.....and can totally be used on anything (fish, steak, rice, etc). LOVE it

Rating: 4
I've received rave reviews about this! It's now a weekly staple at my house. My grocer's jalapeños are amazing this time of year so I opted for those over a chile, but kept all other ingredients as written. Instead of serving out of the rinds, I scraped the cooked squash into a bowl and fork-tossed with all the other ingredients. It was delicious as a side dish, and we used the leftovers the next day as an amazing filling for savory crèpes! You can't go wrong with this dish.

Rating: 3
I kind of really wanted to give it 2.5 stars... it was easy to do, pretty tasty, but didn't really blow me away. I used a cayenne pepper because i have an abundance of those from my CSA and it wasn't spicy enough... I like spice but wasn't sure how much to use so if I do it again I will certainly add more. I also used parsley instead of cilantro because I'm not a big cilantro fan. I served it with wild rice and topped it with crumbled bacon (probably about a tablespoon per serving) and it made a nice dish.

This was good, but I only gave it three stars because I thought the vinaigrette was too oily. The squash roasted nicely though.

This is beautiful, easy and delicious. I used both sweet potatoes and squash (roasted separately) and might use only sweet potatoes next time.

This was a nice change from the traditional butter and brown sugar recipes! My only suggestion would be to use a high quality oil olive. I used an Anaheim chili which work great and the lime was amazing. It was a perfect side dish to the carnitas I made.

Well, I confess; as usual, I modified the recipe. I had to! We didn't have fresh chiles or cilantro. So, we used fresh oregano from the garden and canned chipotle chiles. It was unbelievable. I am sure it's great as written, but in a pinch, you have to make do with what you have! The texture of the squash was perfect, and the oil was so flavorful and delicious that I'm trying to figure out how to save it. Definitely try this recipe.

Awesome flavor combination working here. About 10 minutes before the end I brushed some paste onto the squash. This will be made again and again, especially for company.

Rating: 4
This is fantastic. I was really unsure of the flavor combinations with the squash. I love squash and am perfectly content to eat it with butter, S&P, and brown sugar if I want it sweet. I was more than pleasantly surprised. The sweet and sour of the vinaigrette paired perfectly with the squash. I plan on taking this idea and changing the vinaigrette ingredients to match what else I'm pairing it with. Although, I did make a roast chicken with fresh rosemary, thyme, garlic, and lemon with a rich gravy and this paired with it okay. I thought the two would clash horribly, but it was good. In the future I may stick to using herbs/flavors more closely resembling one another but this was fun. Use honey or agave or brown sugar to sweeten. I also roasted the seeds and then drizzled the vinaigrette on the squash and put back in the oven to de-glaze. I will be making this again and again.

Rating: 4
Excellent. Used only about 1T of oil for the vinaigrette, otherwise, made the recipe as written. Definitely will make again.

Rating: 4
This is just excellent! The fresh herbs and chile really brighten up the squash. I used less oil as suggested by others and substituted mint for the cilantro in the vinagrette. I used fresh lemon for half the lime (didn't have enough lime juice). I also added a bit of honey as recommended. 30 minutes of cooking led to a very soft texture-- I'd cut the cooking time by 5-10 minutes if you want a firm texture to serve as a side, but you won't get as much browning, which adds a lot of flavor. I served the squash over orzo tossed with parm cheese, mint and the leftover seasoned oil in which I had tossed the squash. Will definitely make this again and again.

This recipe is very good, but it wasn't as off-the-hook as other reviews would suggest. As one poster commented, it seemed like the vinaigrette should be cooked, and needed a little sugar to tone down the sour lime and hot pepper. With these modifications, I would make it again, but probably would only use as a side dish (not as a main entree for a vegetarian).

This recipe was wonderful, and has convinced us to eat squash a lot more often! I would give the recipe as-is only 3 forks, though, because the vinegarette needs some help. It is terribly acrid and bitter, and needs 'softening'. I heated about 1 tbsp honey and whisked that in, and that took the bite out nicely. Also, I baked as directed, 15 minutes and 15 minutes in different oven positions, which seemed to be a gracious plenty. What I did do, however, was spoon the sauce over the squash in the last 5-10 minutes of baking, and let it act as a sort of 'glaze'. I think it needs to be cooked. It was absolutely fantastic this way - we ate it all and begged for more!

This is a total winner. I cooked the squash for 15 minutes on each level in the oven. I wouldn't go longer. I followed the recipe exactly and it was so good, my husband had seconds and then drank the remaining sauce off his plate. I like the idea of toasting the seeds - I'll do that next time. We had this with salmon. I wouldn't pair squash and salmon normally, but with the cilantro, lime, and zing from the serrano they were well matched.

I had one acorn squash, so I halved the vinagrette ingredients. I didn't have chile pepper so I substituted 1/4 tsp. sweet chile sauce, 1/24 tsp. chile powder, and 1/4 tsp. red chile flakes. I also used 1 tsp. of lime juice instead of a fresh lime. I omitted the cilantro, but made some additions: 1 tbsp. chopped roasted red pepper, 1 tsp. honey, 1/4 tsp. minced ginger, and orange zest. I took someone's advice and tossed the squash seeds with oil and roasted them with the squash. I served the squash over brown rice with the roasted seeds...the flavor is incredible!! The flavor is sweet/salty/spicy and the roasted seeds definately add to the flavor and texture!

This was so unusual and unexpected! We loved it. I cut the skin off on my plate, but I read reviews of people eating the skin. I've never done that, so I wasn't sure about trying this time.

This is absolutely fantastic! I grew up eating roasted acorn squash with nutmeg, which is good, but this is a much lighter, more refreshing way to make it. I will absolutely make this again. I can easily imagine making the vinaigrete in advance and cutting the squash up the night before and throwing it in the oven when I get home for a quick and easy dinner on a weeknight. We loved the vinaigrette so much that I wish we'd doubled or tripled the recipe. This is a simple, delicious, and very healthy side dish that is sure to be a crowd pleaser. I agree with the other users who said they'd use the dressing on salads.

This recipe is WONDERFUL! We roasted acorn squash in one pan and cubes of sweet potatoes in the other to see which one we liked better.

This was really good. I added the squash seeds to the roasting pan, after tossing them in the leftover oil. It added a great crunch to the dish. I have a feeling this would make a great "guacamole" if the squash were to be scooped out and mashed, seeds added.

Fabulous!! My first time ever with acorn squash and I loved it. I made it exactly as the recipe called for and found the taste and presentation superb. No need to change anything.

I had to improvise a bit with this since I was missing a few ingredients- used a quarter of a bell pepper and chili powder instead of teh chili pepper. Also used mint in lieu of cilantro.

We had garden acorns and I prepared them using this recipe adding only a sprinkle of maple sugar just before dressing the wedges. Flavors were excellent and offset each other beautifully.

I served the Acorn squash cut in half horizontally because I just love the "star" presentation that creates. I also cooked it at 425 for 45 min instead of 450 for 25 mins. I drizzled it with syrup (as suggested previously) and added junks of sweet potato to the outside of the casserole dish after 20 mins or so. Served the sweet potato chunks inside the "star" acorn squash "bowls", drizzled with the vinagrette and it truly fantastic.

I made this for Thanksgiving and EVERYONE loved it - even my kids, who hate squash so much they swear they are allergic to any kind of squash. Made it again a few days later with roasted sweet potato chunks and it was even better. People wanted the vinaigrette for dipping bread and everything else into. It is definitely a keeper.

I know, I'm rating a change, but it was a great one! This was pretty good with the squash (as written), but I made it again, using roasted cubes of sweet potato, and it was phenomenal! Much better than the original (and I love squash). I'll definitely repeat this with the potatoes.

I made this with Julia's roast chicken. Chicken was excellent, I'll always make it her way. This side dish was bland and lacking something-even though I made it exactly as described. If made again, I would make the vinegarette at least two hours ahead to let the flavors meld. Making it while the squash is cooking doesn't leave enough time for the flavors to devolop.

WOW! We had an extra acorn squash at Thanksgiving, so I tried this recipe. It was outstanding. People who loathe squash were coming back for seconds. Definately a keeper. I tossed some maple syrup in with the squash before roasting, and had to use sriracha instead of fresh chiles. Also, don't slice it too thin, otherwise you get mush. Peeling the squash as some suggested made it easier to eat, but next time I'm going to use butternut squash as it doesn't have those pesky ridges to extract peel from.

Incredible recipe. This was the most requested "please can you send me this recipe" dish at this year's Thanksgiving. I par-roasted the squash in the morning, and then finished them off after I took the turkey out of the oven. The squash hold up really well to this type of recipe adjustment. I used a whole red habanero chilli, but didn't use the seeds, as I didn't want to overwhelm my gusts with heat. The taste balance was excellent.

This dish was easy, quick, and super tasty. The grocery store didn't have acorn squash, so I substituted sweet dumpling squash, which has a nice, nutty flavor. Isubstituted jalepenos for red chiles, since the store didn't have those either. And I doubled the garlic, chiles, lime, etc to give the vinaigrette a little more kick. It turned out great!

I have never been a squash fan, and my husband's vegetable taste is relegated to broccoli only, so for the two of this to gobble this up was a miracle. The vinaigrette is a wonderful contrast to the buttery sweetness of the squash. The only thing I would do differently is next time peel the squash.

Rating: 4
As others have also said, this is really one of the rare recipes to get a fourth fork out of me! I unintentionally made it extra spicy (halved the recipe but forgot to halve the chilis :) ) I went the opposite route from many commenters below--instead of making bigger slices and peeling, I made rather thin slices and didn't roast as long, so the peel on the end was very unnoticeable. I notice a lot of variability among individual squashes in the depth of flavor, and rarely find a standard supermarket squash that's worth the effort. I definitely recommend getting nice local organic squashes for this--but this recipe might even zip up a bland factory squash to the point of being pleasant.

Rating: 3
MMMMM! Quite delicious exactly as written except change the shape of the cut to about a 2 inch square. I have found that if I microwave the uncut, but washed, squash for 2 or 3 minutes on high and let it rest while I prepare the other ingredients, it cuts so much easier and the seeds and membranes scoop out effortlessly. I cut with the peel on and then give the peeling side a good whack with a sharp knife and get the most of it off, but don't worry if a little skin remains as it is edible in these small quantities without detracting from the dish.

Rating: 4
Wow, I rarely give 4 forks, but this dish deserves it. A unique and delicious way to serve squash. I highly recommend cutting the squash into wider slices and peeling it before roasting. That will make it a lot easier to eat. Keep everything else the same! The vinaigrette would go well with many other vegetables and fish as well.

Rating: 4
I hesitate to give four forks unless a recipe is really special, but this one deserves it. I made this dish last weekend for a group of 13 adults and 6 children. I doubled the recipe and put the cooked squash out on a platter to wait for the chicken to come off the grill. Within five minutes the squash was gone; even the children were gobbling it up. The next morning people were still raving and everyone wanted the recipe. This is so easy and so good -- I will never stop making it!

Ok, obviously I'm pretty much alone here. I used butternut squash instead of acorn, but I really thought it was eh.

The flavors are really good, and I will make this again, but with one of two changes: I will either roast squash halves, or I will used peeled chunks. I felt that the wedges were cumbersome to eat, due to their size and the peel. Good flavors, though, and a really quick dish.

Based on the favorable reviews I made this recently and we agreed that it was a delightful change to the usual ways of preparing squash. I took advantage of suggestions to make the slices wider (I quartered a slightly-over 1 lb squash) and then cut the quarters in half. The resulting slices were perhaps 1-1/2". I don't agree that coriander ruins this dish, but perhaps you don't like coriander period! I much prefer coriander in this dish to parsley. Whatever, to each his own, that's what makes the world go 'round. Fast and easy.

Refreshingly tangy and spicy take on squash. Marshmallow and cinnamon lovers need not apply. I served this with the Pork Tenderloin with Balsamic-Cranberry Sauce- and finished it off with the Pumpkin Cheesecake Crumble Squares (prepared the night before).

OUTSTANDING! What a fun twist on plain old acorn squash. This was a huge hit with adults and everyone went back for seconds. I didn't have access to a small red chili so I purchased a yellow one with medium heat. I used 1 teaspoon and it had just the right amount of heat. This took no time at all to cook in my convection oven. It roasted perfectly. I flipped each squash piece over half-way through in addition to rotating the pans. Was it just me or did anyone else need a chainsaw to cut the squash? I purchased a large organic one instead of two smaller ones. (The organic ones were large and the non-organic were small.) It was challenging to cut but worth the effort in the end results.

This is delicious and different from the standard autumn squash recipes. I substantially decreased the oil in the vinaigrette with good results.

I have to tell you this is not only simple and can be prepared ahead of time but it it out standing. I made it for the family and will be serving it as a side dish tonight for 12 guest. Wonderful cannot say enough.

I substited dried chiplotes for the fresh and dried cilantro for the fresh..Hey, we live in the country, learn to make do. Delicious. That sauce would do well on many vegetables. Going to do it again on green beans and broccoli. Very satisfying.

I used local roasted green chiles instead of red, and it turned out just fantastic. I should've made more. My husband couldn't stop raving about this dish.

Pshaw. Cilantro, lime, and pepper are a classic combo! Great dish for those who don't like the sweetness of squash. My squash-averse husband devoured it. Toss in some lime zest.

What a taste surprise! Yummy! Only one caveat: DO NOT USE CILANTRO! It will ruin the whole thing. Substitute Italian flat-leafed parsely and enjoy.

My husband loves squash,but the traditional way of cooking it holds no appeal for me. This was easy to prepare, and the ingredients which make up the vinaigrette added a Latin flavor to the squash. An outstanding recipe. Definitely will prepare again.

Anybody know if this would work with other types of squash?

The first time my husband has had seconds on squash. Refreshingly different from usual ways of cooking it. I'd suggest cutting the squash thicker, as it's hard to cut, and I think the thicker pieces were better--maybe 16 pieces per squash. That would also make it easier to leave the skin behind while eating. The skin is tough and not really edible. The chile vinaigrette is outstanding!

Excellent dish. Sometimes I use parsley instead of cilantro. Lot's of garlic.

So this is my first post to epicurious ..but this recipe was so good I had to come back and say so! Squash has never been on our list of veggies ..and hubby generally steers away from anything remotely off the normal fare..so the fact that he loved it! ..says a lot. It was really easy to make and I agree with everyone that the dressing complements the sweetness of the squash perfectly. I gave the dressing a little whiz in the food processor to make it creamier.

Very easy, very delicious. I agree that the skin was a big tough and I might slice the squash thicker next time to get more juicy flesh (the surfaces get pretty crispy).

WOW! This dish was easy and delicious. I served it to five very hungry men, all of them true carnivores, and they cleaned their plates and asked for more. The vinaigrette was unbelievable and I would like to try pairing it with other vegetables or maybe even fish. The only thing I noticed was that the squash skins were a little tough, but just cut them away and you have something really special. A really easy and elegant fall side dish!

So many ways of preparing Acorn Squash involve sugar and butter. This was a lovely change! I cut in half and baked without the olive oil coating, then quartered to finish off on the grill with a turkey breast. Made the vinaigrette per recipe, but only used about 2/3 on the dish. It's gorgeous and delicious. The remaining dressing was great on a lunch salad of greens, tomato and left-over said turkey. Loved it as did son and daughter-in law!

the most delicious roasted squash! we made this for a potluck, and it was the party favorite. the vinaigrette is wonderful, and it added a very surpising, very good, flavor. i am definitely making this again.

This was DELICIOUS! The spicy pepper and the savory cilantro were a perfect pairing to the sweetness of the squash. It was also very easy to make. I did have to substitute the hot red pepper b/c the local grocery store was out. I used, instead, one jalapeno and 1/4 of a habenero pepper from my garden (seeds taken out of both). The combination gave it enough heat and the yellow of the habenero offered some color contrast.

This dish was very easy to make and turned out wonderful. I did find that I had to move the pan to the middle of the oven - the upper third was too high up and chared the squash too much. Also, I added the chili to the garlic and incorporated it into the paste. It got rave reviews from my family. The flavors are a perfect match. Good side dish for company.
