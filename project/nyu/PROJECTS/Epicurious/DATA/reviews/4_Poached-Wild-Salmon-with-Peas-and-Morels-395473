Excellent recipe! I've cooked salmon many different ways with different sauces and this one will remain as one of my favorites. Doubled the mushrooms (used a variety of fresh wild) and peas but kept the same amount of liquid. I also seasoned the vegetables with dill. The trick is to boil down the poaching liquid before adding the cream so you have a thicker sauce.

I was surprised to be disappointed by this one. I used shiitake mushrooms and found it bland. The sauce didn't thicken up much, but that wasn't my issue with it. I just found this dish rather boring.

My husband made this dish and it was wonderful. He doubled the amount of mushrooms (used shitake) and peas to make it a complete meal. YUM!

Excellent! Very elegant. The salmon was done cooking by the time it reached a simmer (but my salmon was thinner than called for). Served with roasted potatoes and fresh green beans for a fabulous, company worthy dinner.

I made this and used shiitake muchrooms and chives rather than pea tendrils. I added two chicken bullion cubes and a little Italian Herbs (Herbs Provence would also work) to the poaching liquid. We loved this but I'd hate to see how many calories are in it. Excellent.

Amazing and easy recipe. Used dried morels and regular sliced mushrooms and it was delicious. It takes a bit of time to reduce the sauce, longer than 5 mins. This is an elegant dish, suitable for company, and it's incredibly easy.

Used kale and peas. Make sure the pan is a little on the dry side before you add the cream...otherwise you have creamy broth..all good! I elevated the salmon on lemon slices, so I guess I steamed the fish not poached it. 8 minutes, then covered and plated in a 150 degree oven. Also added dill to broth, FWIW.

This dish was terrific. I feel it's essential to use Wild Fresh Salmon. I also used sugar snap fresh peas, I shelled them. I couldn't get Morels, so I used Shitake mushrooms. If you want to make an impression this is the go to dish for me. It was great.

this recipe is awesome in its simplicity but the poaching directions will lead to an overcooked fish. by the time you reach that simmer the fillet will be overcooked. just try it. the peas and shrooms w/ a bit of butter and milk fat is genius though. pls make this but figure a way to not overcook the fish.

WOW!! This was incredibly fabulous!! I never poached salmon before--what a revelation! I used regular farm raised salmon, 1 1/2 tbsp salt instead of 2 (I don't like things too salty), sliced baby portabellas and 1 C frozen peas. It's so pretty and impressive looking, great to make for company. Pretty simple and quick to make too. My new favorite!
