these are amazing! no changes necessary. ok we use a bit more lemon in the tapenade but that'll depend on which tapenade used (we use fontaine sante). best bread: berber bread, but ciabatta works well too. we toast it and rub with a clove of garlic cut in half.

This is one of my go-to recipes for entertaining, great for cocktail parties or girls' night! I make them into sliders, and freeze some extra patties for a quick meal later.

Super easy andd quick. Instead of storebought or generic olive tapenade, made the sundried tomato tapenade from this site. Used that for half the burgers and storebought tzatziki for the other half. These would make great meat balls too!

Yummy!!!! I added slightly more of all the spces, expect I left out the cayenne because of my kids and added just a little hot paprika. I also used 1/2 lamb and 1/2 grassfed beef because that is what I had - sure turned out tasty. Used a homemade green olive tapenade from this website with cilantro and capers. Also made a cumin, greek yogurt, harissa cream sauce. Served with buttered, grilled naan bread.

We love ground lamb. It stands up to bold flavors without overpowering the distinct taste of the meat. This dish is a perfect for a quick weeknight dinner and intriguing enough for company. I made the burgers, served them over rice with a thinned down olive tapanade drizzled over the whole thing.

This is a very good recipe. I rate it a 3 instead of 4 simply because it leaves the salt and pepper to guesswork. Since this is a meat dish, I can't taste it to see if there's enough salt, so I end up guessing. But I've cooked it three or four times, so it must be good. I use about 1 tsp salt, and add 1/2 tsp of peppercorns when I grind the cumin and coriander.

Went heavy on the spices (used only one pound of lamb and kept the rest as the recipe called for) and couldn't have asked for a more delicious recipe!

This made very tasty burgers --the spices were proportioned exactly as I like it. I followed the recipe as is and did not use the tzatiki topping (thought I may try it next time).

Yummy. I started with 1 lb ground lamb from the grocery. It was not too fatty. I cut everything else down by 1/3, and just a sprinkle of cayenne. I made 8 small patties from the 1 lb. Stuck with the tapenade proportions. I prepared tzatiki from this site -- the English cuke, red onions instead of shallots, and dried dill (mid winter). Winter tomatoes (yuck), and bibb lettuce leaves. DH's only negative comment was to suggest that I make my own pita the next time.

This recipe was simple and amazingly delicious! I didn't have the tapenade, so I made garlic yogurt sauce from this site. I also substituted flat-leaf parsley for the cilantro, because I can't stand the taste of cilantro. It's a perfect weeknight dinner with a steamed veggie on the side! Next time, I'll mix and form the burgers in the morning and just cook them when I get home from work.

Delicious. We didn't use the tapenade, but instead topped with Tsatziki. The seasoning was great -- everyone liked these!

Amazing.I made these as "mini burgers" for a party and they were gone in an instant. Spice mix really enhanced the lamb flavor. I added some crumbled feta to some for fun -- that worked well too to add a bit of unexpected tang.

We love the exotic smell and taste of Moroccan spices and food, and this was great. Only made 2 giant burgers and let them sit in frig covered for 24 hours. Cooked them med rare, and served them on Nan(Indian flat bread). So good.

Very good and very simple to make. Will make again.

I've made these a few times and they've been a big hit - instead of the tapenade I top with some tzatiki and I just use regular buns - very tasty

Very good and easy. The tapenade topping was interesting as was serving them in pitas rather than hamburger buns. Definitely would make it again.

Pretty good, and certainly easy. I would probably halve the cayenne next time.
