I have made this a couple of times and always to complete rave reviews and requests for the recipe. I've used Bosc pears and tart cherries. It is essential that you soak the cherries in red wine, not in water. I like to top it with a dollop of creme fraiche. Soooo good.

I am an experienced cook, and the recipe sounded great. Maybe my expectations were too high but I was very disappointed. I would have done better to make a simple cherry crisp : I say cherry because it was the dominant flavor, overwhelming the delicacy of the pears (and I made it especially for a pear dessert fan). The topping, described as spicy and crunchy, was neither:I found it insipid and overly sweet and lacking crunchiness. Even though I baked it for longer than advised hoping to get crunch: it never happened. IF I were to do it again I would reduce the cherries, use a nut with a heartier taste, and be sure to leave the topping in big enough chunks to get crunchy (I suspect I made the texture too uniform). But like I said, a disappointment all around.

This is good and I will definitely prepare again. I used an $8 bottle of Turning Leaf Zin to macerate the cherries and it worked very well. A single 9x13 baking dish was perfect for 8 med sized Bartlett pears. I think any ground nut would work as the almonds tend not to impart a distinct flavor. I am considering adding almond paste next time to increase that flavor of which I am so fond.

Oh my gosh is this awesome. It was a total hit. I did use a pear wine from Washington State rather than the Zin and would definately do it again to soak the cherries. We served it with fresh whipped cream with a hint of vanilla bean paste and it was excellent.

This was a delicious dessert, and probably my new favorite crisp recipe. There is, however, one apparent error in the recipe-- I didn't buy especially large pears, but 4 pears (not 8) was about 2 1/2 pounds and plenty of fruit for the amount of cherries. Unfortunately, my grocery store was out of dried sour cherries when I went shopping, so I used a mix of dried sweet cherries and dried cranberries, which was fine. I also baked all the crisp in one large casserole dish, instead of individual ramekins, and served with Haagen Dazs hazelnut gelato. Overall, not that much work, and great results. The wine soaking definitely adds a nice flavor.

Received a full box of pears and decided to try this recipe. A wonderful one indeed! I used Cherry Marnier in the soaking "process" and would highly recommend it. Results were certainly more than ordinary and I would not hesitate to serve this "humble" dessert to guests. I used whipped cream (spirited might be nice) to garnish but vanilla ice cream would be nice also.
