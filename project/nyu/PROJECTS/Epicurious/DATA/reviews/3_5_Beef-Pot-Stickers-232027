I made these and will make them again. My family ate them up and wanted more. I had regular chive in the garden so I used those and some minced garlic. Glad I did because I had no idea how many chives I would need for 2 cups. A lot! Loved them!

These were really easy to make, albeit a bit time consuming to assemble. I also used wonton wrappers for convenience, and my 5 year old daughter was even able to help out. The whole family enjoyed them. Looking forward to making them again.

I wanted to make something different for a friend's bachelorette party. This recipe was so simple. I used Wonton wraps instead which cut down on some time and once I figured out how to fold them I was just amazed. The girls pounced on them and they were gone in a matter of minutes. I will definitely make these again! It was difficult to find the garlic chives where I live, but now that I know where to find them it's no problem.

This is a fun recipe because you can experiment with the filling. I pre-cooked filling using ground beef, celery, green pepper, onion and soy sauce. The dough was easy to work with, but making the pouches was time consuming (took me 1 1/2 hrs altogether for entire recipe start to finish - however, the ground beef was frozen to start with). May try won ton wrappers next time or try rolling large sheet and cutting out circles of dough. Very good - and filling was kid friendly.

Great recipe. Just be patient and exact with the preparation of the dough. It helps if you've worked with/kneaded pizza dough before. My first attempt came out more like [o] Gyoza vs. potstickers because of too much water in the mixture. :)

I tweeked this a bit based on what I had on hand and other's suggestions, and I thought it was GREAT! I used pre-made wonton wrappers and those worked just as well. I did have trouble with them sticking to the bottom of the pan, but that was probably my fault. Monitor closely, and add water!

I have made this twice now (the 2nd time with ground venison & shallots as the chives are now frozen in the garden). The dough is SO effortless to make,I can use the same recipe for spring rolls or other dumplings. My husband especially loved the venison potstickers.

This was a good dish but I kinda changed it up a little. I added sesame seeds which added a nice crunch element to it, I didn't have peanut oil so I didn't use it. And I just used egg roll wrappers instead of making my own dough...it worked out great and we ate them all up!

this recipe tqkes qbit off time, but not too much work. I couldnt find the bean paste in my local grocery store (I live in a very small village) but I found an asian bean sauce with ginger in it which worked pretty well I accomanied this with suome buckwheat noodles cooked with chinese frozen veggies, and dipping sauces like soy sauce wih wasabi, terriyaki sauce, pickled ginger- my husband loved them so much that he ate 18 of them!

This dish was great everyone really enjoyed it, I substituted regular chives for garlic ones and added a little chopped garlic.
