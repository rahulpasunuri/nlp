The concept of this risotto works, I think, but the bok choy is a little too bitter for this dish, the snap peas a little too crunchy based on this cooking time, and the mussels a little out of place all round. One thing that I did change was that I didn't do the mussels in the dutch oven as suggested -- it seemed to me that there was great risk of having the pancetta and ginger burn during those six minutes, and an even greater risk of the mussels going cold. I did them in a separate pot with wine - which was fine. If I were to do this again, I would use the bok choy stems but not the leaves, and I would put the snap peas in a little earlier.

Very tasty. Used portabellas as I had them on hand, and doubled the mussels. I used 2tbsps of grated ginger which may have been too much. Next time will omit the pancetta, or substitute bacon because the flavor really didn't come through.

This is very different from most of the food I make. (Meaning: I rarely cook Chinese unless it contains chicken, peanuts and rice.) But, I will definitely make this again. Very delicious!

I used a combination of fresh shitakes and regular mushooms (no dried shitakes available). We ate this as two courses; first the mussels(which I placed on top of the rice), then the risotto. Incredible flavor and will make it again.

This was very different and a very exciting change from traditional risottos. Please give this one a try!
