The sauce is wonderful and easy to make, especially good for do-ahead meals. I've used the sauce with apple bread pudding for a neighborhood block party and over vanilla ice cream and sauteed apples.

I think the sauce is excellent. I used candied pecans instead of walnuts. I will use the sauce for other desserts.

This was one of those recipes that just did not cut the mustard. We were very unhappy with this dish. Lets bury this one........deep!.

Made this for company this weekend, using my own home made pound cake. The sauce was absolutely scrumptious. It was a big hit. I found myself stealing spoonfuls the next day! And, the sauce was very simple. Nice to have an alternative the same old raspberry sauce I usually use.

I made this at a "soup kitchen" that I work at and everyone loved it. This was an inexpensive dish to make. I appreciate this web site for helping me make delicious food based on the ingredients at hand.
