To the cook from Houston: Slice the zucchini into 1/4" thick strips, brush with olive oil, grill, THEN cut into smaller pieces. Haven't tried this recipe but have grilled zucchini and yellow squash many times and it is fantastic. grill marks add character and flavor.

This is OK, but just a suggestion on a better way to prepare zucchini on a grill: Peel the zucchini, then slice in half lengthwise. Turn to flat cut side, drizzle with olive oil, a little salt and pepper and some crushed garlic. Wrap in foil and grill until slightly brown and al dente (semi-soft). Excellent.

no fork 'cause I haven't tried it yet-had a question > I never heard of grilling whole and then cutting, always thought it had to be cut, then done in a basket contraption. Bit of a mess- Any input?

Splendid and simple. Made in the oven, on a slow broil.
