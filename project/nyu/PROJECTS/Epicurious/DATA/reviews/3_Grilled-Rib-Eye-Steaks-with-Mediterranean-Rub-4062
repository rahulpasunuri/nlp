Great rub, also makes a great marinade. Place the dry ingredients in a bowl add 1/2 cup honey and 1/2 water, mix well, add meat and marinate several hours. This was great on lamb chops. The sweetness fron the honey mixed well with the tartness from a little tatziki (sp) sauce.

My husband made this for father's day & it was excellent. He used buffalo rib eyes since the beef rib eyes looked so fatty.

These steaks were really good. I used NY strip steaks because they looked better the day I bought them. It doesn't really matter which cut you prefer. I didn't use the olive oil and it worked beautifully as a dry rub. Might up the coriander next time just because I really like it.

Made this recipe for my steak-loving boys. They were not impressed with my efforts and felt the rub over-powered the flavor of the steak. My husband and I loved it though and will make it again for the two of us.

I had a huge and $$ problem with this recipe. The olive oil that was added to the rub caused my grill to flare unmercifully and my steaks were charred beyond recognition. The one steak that did not receive the rub came out fine. Don't want others to risk their pricey steaks. I think a dry rub would have been just fine on this meat.

I really liked the combination of spices used in this rub. I followed the advice of another reviewer and added more cayenne pepper and brown sugar. It wasn't bad on steak, but I think the rub would actually taste better on beef ribs or pork.

Savory!! I always have all of these spices in my spice cabinet. I can't beleive I never thought to combine them for a rub. I have been experimenting for a long time for a steak rub...I found one!! I am not a big steak eater but with this great rub I even had some of my picky,picky,picky, husband's steak!! (I did marinate it for about 9 hours)

Delicious! The spice rub gives the steaks a wonderful flavor. I've made this many times already. In fact, I pre-mix the spices so it's ready to use any time. I have also tried the steaks broiled and they turned out beautifully. I can't wait to try it on chicken too.

Didnt think it was too spicy in fact I added another 1/4 tsp cayenne. Would add 1-2 tbls of brown sugar too. Very much like Athur Bryant's BBQ sauce in Kansas City.

I used this rub on a sirloin tip oven roast and it turned out delicious. I didn't find the combination of spices too overwhelming - despite the large quantity of ground cumin called for. I can see this rub working well with lamb and even turkey. Definitely give it a try!

This was alright, but the rub was a little overwhelming. The steak was more or less lost in the intense flavor.

It gave the steaks excellent flavor.

This was good, but I think we prefer our rib eye plain. It was quite spicy and I felt it took away from the naturally good taste of the meat. I may have used too much rub(I used half the rub amt on about 1.5llbs. of meat). I might consider using it on tenderloin which I feel is more bland and needs some taste or I could see it being very good on lamb. Also, letting it sit for 4 minutes and then slicing it to serve made it cold.

At first bite I wasn't sure about this rub, but once you get into the steak it mixes wonderfully with the meat juices. For any steak done rare to medium the spices compliment the meat, and the recipe is quick and easy to make.

The spices were interesting mixed together. I've realised I prefer to marinate the meat in herbs instead of spices. Nevertheless, it was very much appreciated by guests. Will probably make it again

Not bad. A little spicy for my taste, but my husband loved it.

I've grilled steaks and chicken with this recipe and both came out great. The chicken was even better the next day.
