I tripled the amount of garlic and added 1/4 cup of diced scallions to enhance the flavor. With these additions it is a great lower calorie dish.

Easy and very yummy. We prefer to use imported Italian canned tuna in olive oil. Another good option (if you can find it, would be Starkist's canned "Yellowfin" marinated in either Lemon Dill or Roasted Garlic. VERY GOOD.

So, so good! I added celery and finely sliced red onions. I substituted cilantro as my grocery store didn't have flat leaf parsley. I will make this again and again... would be fantastic for a picnic!

Fabulous and simple. I substituted fresh basil for the parsley (in a smaller amount). Yummy, low carb and satisfying!

This was really tasty, perhaps largely because I had leftover fresh grilled albacore to put in it instead of canned. I used grape tomatoes also instead of larger ones.

Very light and refreshing. Perfect for a summer main dish. I used imported spanish tuna in olive oil that I found at a Mextican grocery store. The texture and flavor were superior to what you find at the grocery store and cost about the same. I used the small cocktail tomatoes on the vine cut in half which added and element of sweetness and some kalamata olive which added an earthiness. The lemon vinagrette was delicious!

Very good. I agree with the comments that there was too much parsely, but other than that this is a great recipe. Higher quality tuna (not canned or from a vaccuum sealed bag) would probably further improve the dish.

Incredible recipe prepared exactly as written. Served this at a luncheon and got rave reviews. Garlic, olive oil, lemon juice and pepper... what could be better!

It's hard to understand how anyone would not like this recipe. I've been making it for years, first introduced to a simplified version by a Milanese chef friend. Make the dressing and add beans, diced roma tomatoes and fresh basil, then the high quality tuna in olive oil. DIVINE!

Followed the recipe exactly and this dish is absolutely delicious. The cooks who rated this recipe so poorly must have used inferior ingredients.

Like the cook from Oakland, I was disappointed. Such good, healthy ingredients but no pizazz. There are better recipes out there.

Simple and delicious with fresh tuna coated with Italian herbs and seared. Used black beans also for extra color.

I used lettuce instead of parsley which was a good choice. A really nice salad with a great garlic flavour!

this was great for canned tuna and canned white beans! I also used cilantro and added capers and parmesean cheese. It was a great lunch for me and my 18 mo daughter.

This recipe sounded good, but it just didn't work for me. I did use a little more garlic than was called for, and that was a mistake. I thought it was waaaay too much parsley, and that the combination of ingredients just didn't work.

So so flavor, and I got the best tuna I could find

Cilantro highly recommended in this dish, and a dash of a good hot sauce (ie., Melindas) is also nice. A very tasty, healthy dish.

Yummy! I didn't comprehend the recipe correctly and minced the garlic, then pour in lemon juice and about 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil, instead of making the paste. Oops! It still turned out great. Highly recommend, very virtuous dish.

Very easy, light, and tasty. The garlic and lemon in the dressing make the dish taste really fresh. I substituted celery for cucumber (it's what I had in the fridge) and cilantro for parsley. The cilantro blended beatifully, but the celery wasn't quite right. Even so, my husband loved it and took all the leftovers for lunch the next day.

Good quick, basic salad.

Light, fresh, economical, tastes very good. I used chick peas instead of beans. I added fresh parsley each time at I ate it over Labor Day weekend. Made it again to take to work this week. Yes, I really like it.
