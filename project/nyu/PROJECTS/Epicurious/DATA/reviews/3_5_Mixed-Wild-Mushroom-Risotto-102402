This is such a simple recipe for such a delicious result. I have made this several times and it always turns out well. I've found it works best for me to add the broth in stages. It definitely always takes a lot longer during the broth adding period than the recipe says. I normally just use white or crimini mushrooms, but it's good with a nice mix also. I hugely prefer the fresh thyme to dried. I think if I didn't have fresh I would substitute some other herb/seasoning over dried thyme. I typically use pinot gris, but would not hesitate to use most any white I had on hand. Everyone I've made this for has liked/loved it. My mom is upset when I make it and she's not there.

First time risotto makers, fear not. This was my first try at risotto and I must admit I was a little nervous. But to my surprise this recipe was easy and delicious. I would maybe add more mushrooms next time just because I love mushrooms, and I added some shallots and garlic to for the same reason.

This is one of my husband's favorite recipes. I just made it again last night with shiitake and oyster mushrooms from the farmer's market. Delicious. And it really is okay to make this the "lazy" way. I've made it both ways and it really makes no difference.

I used the dried herb as the recipe indicates you may (instead of fresh). Adding half of it at the end (like the recipe says to do) seemed like a bad a idea so I added it mid-cooking. The dried thyme was still hard and gross. My boyfriend and I were picking out bits of hard thyme that got stuck in our teeth. Otherthan that, I thought it was great. But I also grew up with my Northern Italian-born grandfather's risotto so I was somewhat familiar with the strong flavors. My boyfriend thought it was completely gross and only ate a few bites before giving up. (And he usually eats whatever I make). I'll make it again, but only if I add all the herb early on so it can soften. And I'll ease up on the parm since I think that added to the strong flavors that my partner didn't like. (And if he still doesn't like it, then tough! I like it!)

This was delicious and quite easy, save for slicing all the mushrooms by hand (I don't have a slicer). I followed the recipe exactly and found the flavors wonderful, though adding additional thyme and cheese would probably make it even better!

So easy, so quick and very good tasting. I also used different kinds of dried exotic mushrooms that I rehydrated and used the liquid I obtained from doing that also.

I sauteed a shallot and some chopped garlic in the butter before adding the mushrooms. I put in extra thyme and a little extra parmesan. I liked it and would make it again, but will definitely add the stock gradually as I usually do. It makes a creamier risotto. Tasty.

Yum! Made this on a rainy day and it was wonderful. I sauted the mushrooms in butter and garlic, then added the thyme and rice. Added the liquids gradually and a bit more parmasan cheese for extra flavor. An excellent hearty dish.

This was fabulous, and well worth the extra effort of adding the broth gradually instead of dumping it in all at once. Also, we used fresh rosemary instead of thyme, and added two cloves of garlic. A deeply satisfying dish...

YUMMY. Definitely add the liquid gradually though, instead of plopping it in just two parts, the lazy way!

this is a great Recipe for when convenience counts Would recomend adding stock at a slow controlled rate.I used some chantrell, lobster, and Prince mushrooms I found in local parks. Excellent Fall dish for this reason.

I find this to be one of the simplest methods for making risotto (adding the majority of the liquid at once rather than small amounts added several times)and have used the same method for other risotto combinations. We have made this version several times and always have been very pleased with it. I usually use vegetable broth rather than mushroom broth, preferring the flavor of the actual mushrooms (and we have access to great ones here in the NW) to stand out.

A few mods made this a winner. Don't add all liquid at once: different rices and altitude affect absorbtion. I also fried the mushrooms first until dry to concentrate their flavor. Only add these at the end together with parmesan and some chopped parsely. Other herbs are too strong.

Easy, quick and very tasty. It was exactly the flavor I was looking for. I used portabello, oyster, shiitake and brown mushrooms. Made it one night and had the leftovers the next. Wish I had more so I could have it for lunch today.

Easy to make, very tasty, I used chicken stock and it was fabulous with a side saled and parmesan and thyme focaccia!

Not bad. Not excited. Give it one fork. Served it with the only cube steak recipe in the 10,000 recipe Epicurious data bank. A real bust. I should have sauteed the cube steak and had garlic mashed potatos. Easier, quicker, cheaper, better.

I found this to be too heavy in rosemary and just a fair dish. I have much, much better rice dishes. Very moist. I wouldn't make it again.

The 10 guests at my dinner party raved about this one. I didn't need as much liquid as the recipe called for. I started out with less and didn't add it all. Wonderful taste!

Such an easy and delicious recipe to make on a cold fall evening--I substituted one cup chicken broth for the vegetable broth, and thought it added great flavor. Also be sure to use fresh thyme--it really makes a difference. There were no leftovers after this recipe and everyone came back for more!

This was excellent and not very difficult to make. The recipe would probably serve 4 as a side dish, but it's so good that the leftovers got eaten right up.

Great Risotto recipe--Better than the one I had one week ago in Italy's Cinque Terra (which was porcini risotto)! I tried a new arborio rice this time, which was parboiled (bought it at Trader Joe's). Though my expectations regarding a parboiled arborio product were not high, I found the results to be very successful. And the time saved is significant. Had to adjust the amounts of liquids (i.e., broth and wine)stated in the recipe for the parboiled arborio rice. I also used cremini mushrooms and thought they were great and inexpensive. The recipe was generous for two people and probably could have been stretched to three.
