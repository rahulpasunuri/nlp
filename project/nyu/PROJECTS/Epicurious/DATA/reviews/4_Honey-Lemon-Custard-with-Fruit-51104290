Wow, it works. I was afraid to try this recipe, I just couldn't believe it would work. I did some research first and these are "lemon possets" and have been around for decades. I doubled the recipe and poured into goblets to serve. They were in the fridge by 9:30a, uncovered, and within an hour already looked solid. Served at 6p and they were amazing. No skin formed despite not being covered. The very bottom was softer, more like a thick sauce. Even the next day the bottom was thinner so I think the idea is to serve in a ramekin because the depth is less and even. My goblets were probably too deep. I also did the mango topping but fine chopped instead of ribbons and did not use the rum. I really liked these, they were refreshing after a heavy spiced stew for dinner. The creaminess is truly amazing, like a really thick Greek yogurt. I have to admit, I don't think I'll use the honey next time. I didn't like the combination with the vanilla, nor with the mango. I will use just sugar next time, but there will be a next time. Just too easy and tasty to not make again.
