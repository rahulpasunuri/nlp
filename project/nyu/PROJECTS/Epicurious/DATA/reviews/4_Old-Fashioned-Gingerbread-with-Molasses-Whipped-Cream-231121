With the additional spices recommended by others (2 t cinnamon, 1 t ginger, and 3/4 t cloves), this gingerbread had the right flavor. I was hoping for something fairly dense, however, and even though I made the sugar about 1/3 dark brown sugar and 1/4 of the flour whole wheat, it was still a little cakey for my taste. It did fall in the middle. I cooked it in a round, 9" pan. A google search suggested that a bigger pan would allow the batter to spread out more and not collapse in on itself. But then it would likely be even more cakey. The fallen middle didn't affect the texture, and it even looked kind of cool.

YUM! I live in Germany and could not find the correct sized baking pan, so my gingerbread totally overflowed while cooking-- and it was still delicious!! A real keeper.

This is quite yummy and not too sweet---it's just right and hard to have only one piece. At the suggestion of other reviewers, I increased the cinnamon to 1.5 tsp and ginger to 1 tsp. While baking, mine slightly overflowed my 8x8 pan, so you may want to cut back the batter by 1/4-1/2 cup if you don't use the recommended 9x9. Like another reviewer, mine came out slightly sunken in the middle, but it didn't seem to have any effect on the texture, it just didn't look picture perfect. This is wonderful as is, but to make it more fancy, next time I will add chopped candied ginger.

I've been making this gingerbread for several years now-ever since my neighbor brought it over as a thank you gift. Once you've tasted this, you can never buy a gingerbread cake mix again.We love it with the molasses whipped cream or with peppermint ice cream during the holidays. I, too, have had the center fall. Anyone have any ideas why this might occur?

I read this recipe wrong and forgot to get whipping cream. I used lowfat milk instead and it came out fine- just like a cake. I don't know what the difference would be with the cream, but this was very tasty and I would make again with milk.

This cake is wonderful! Exactly what I wanted to kick off the holiday season. Light, moist texture, and a rich, wonderful taste. I used dark molasses--I love molasses--and a little more spice than the recipe called for. I also used an 8x8 inch pyrex instead of the 9x9 metal pan. I also didn't bother with the whipped cream. The cake was wonderful on its own. I will definitely be making this again.

Great recipe! I followed the hints of others and upped the spices slightly, added cloves, candied ginger and orange zest, and served it with ice cream instead of whipped cream. It was delicious!

Memphis - When I've doubled the recipe but not used (2) 9x9x2, but rather made it in a slightly larger pan and a little deeper with batter, I had the same thing happen. No other time... I've also used this recipe for various sized cupcakes and muffins. Fantastic!

Really nice gingerbread after doubling all the spices. Both times I've baked this, I've ended up with a depression in the center of the cake. Oven is the appropriate temp, cooking evenly, etc. Has anybody had the same experience with this? No matter, just cover it up with whipped cream! (Don'[t bother with the molasses whipped cream)

Fantastic! Everyone loves it and claims it is the best or near-best they've ever had. I used dark molasses, which certainly changes the complexity, but left all else the same. I also doubled the recipe and had no problems. I might add a bit more ginger next time, but not much and I wouldn't change anything else

This Gingerbread turned out great. I made it for Sunday Brunch. I added 1/8 cup minced crystallized ginger, used 2 tbs cinnamon, 1.5 tsp ground ginger, 0.5 tsp ground cloves, and instead of boiling water used a 1/2 n 1/2 mixture of hot coffee and orange juice. It was rich, moist and flavorful. My husband had 3 pieces.

I'm a newbie to cooking -- could someone please explain what whipping cream is? I'm not sure if it's the same thing as heavy cream. Thanks!

fantastic. doubled the ginger and cinnamon and kept the rest as is. served with vanilla whipped cream and agree with previous reviewers that the molasses cream would have been overkill. even prepared two days ahead, the gingerbread was moist and delicious.

I have to agree with the cook from Cambridge. I went with the suggestions from the reviews to add more spice and found it out of balance although the moisture and texture were very good. Next time, I'll try somewhere in between with the spice.

I was rather disappointed by this recipe, given the reviews. I found the texture to be quite nice, but even with the spice improvements suggested by other reviewers the balance was off. It had far too strong an aftertaste, and was missing that sort of quintessential gingerbread flavor.

Fabulous! Took other reviewers' advice and upped the cinnamon, ginger, and added orange zest plus 1/2 t cloves. Rave reviews. Will definitely make again.

This was excellent, especially with the suggested addition of candied/crystallized ginger, which gave it extra zing. I wasn't thrilled with the molasses whipped cream though, as it overpowers the cake. Plain whipped cream or vanilla ice cream works great.

Mmm mmm good! This was simple and delicious. I highly recommend the molassas whipped cream. I heeded a few earlier comments and included approximately 1/3 cup of minced crystallized ginger to the batter. Boy, did the house smell good!

I really love this recipe, which is very easy to make. I ate 3 small pieces last night. I did not make the whipped cream with maple syrup. I think that is over-kill. I did add certain excellent additions recommended by a previous reviewer: A total of: 2 tablespoons of cinnamon 1 3/4 teasoons of ground ginger Plus: 1 orange zest, minced, (or grated with a microplane zester) 1/2 cup minced candied ginger (that I minced up in my cuisinart,and added to the mixture right after I creamed the butter and the sugar and the molasses.)

Excellent! I want to thank the cook from New York (01-31-05) for delicious "improvements". I did as suggested; unfortunately I didn't have candied ginger at home. Next time...

Reading this recipe immediately made me crave a slab of warm gingerbread with whipped cream (a favorite childhood treat). I found the results nice and moist, with great texture. The taste itself wasn't quite what I was looking for (I prefer it to be less sweet, and a bit more strongly spiced; this one tastes mainly of sugar and molasses) I had upped the ginger a little, but another time I'd go with a previous reviewer's comments and add additional spices for a more complex flavor.

This was a very moist and good gingerbread!! I didn't have enough cream for the whipped cream but this was good with ice cream.

My additions to this recipe were related to increasing the flavor quotient...I used 1 3/4 TBSP of Ginger, 2 TBSP of Cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of Cloves, 1 tsp of Allspice, a few grinds of black pepper, zest of 1 orange as well as 1/2 cup of candied ginger (oh, and I used fat free yogurt in lieu of cream)...It was GREAT!

This is good but I think it needs more ginger. I served it with plain whipped cream, which was almost overkill. This stands alone and keeps well.

this recipe is so good! I was worried because I made it with dark molasses and whole wheat flour, but it was moist and tasty.

This is absolutely the best. I tried gingerbread for the first time last year and was more than embarrassed! I followed this recipe exactly and Voila. Huge hit at work and can't wait to make it again for family. They don't make candles that smell this good!

I made this dessert during half time of a football game we were watching on TV. It was incredibly easy, and ended being the hit of our Thanksgiving meal. In fact, everyone has asked for the recipe and I plan on making it again for Christmas. Go easy on the molasses, as it can be very overpowering.

I made this dish later in the afternoon on Thanksgiving day, after we had had a chance to digest our meal. It was so easy, we made the entire dessert during half time! The gingerbread was incredible. I can't remember every having gingerbread as good as this. It was the best part of our meal. Go easy on the molasses in the whipped cream; it's a little overpowering. I plan on making this again for Christmas.

This gingerbread is the best I've ever tried. Over the Thanksgiving holiday, my family loved it so much that I had to make it twice. Since then I've emailed it to several of my family and friends as a "must try".

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it. The pumpkin pie went barely uneaten as everyone had second helpings of the gingerbread. Very moist, great flavor. I made he whipped cream plain, with a touch of powdered sugar and vanilla, and it was delicious.

Very moist cake. Great spicy-sweet ginger taste. Everyone at my bookclub raved about it!
