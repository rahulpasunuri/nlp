This chicken is very bland. After reading the other reviews, I tried to over season it and marinate it overnight and it still did not taste like it even had been salted properly. It did not taste like anything I have ever had in an Indian restaurant.

This recipe was okay, but it needed some heat and should have been cooked without skin. We had to add hot sauce after it was cooked.

I just made this for my boyfriend and I and I love it! I used 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts and added 3 tbsp. curry and about 1/4 cup diced onions. I fried the curry and onions in oil to bring out the flavor and added to the marinade. I baked 15 minutes on one side, flipped, then 15 minutes on the other. I made white rice and poured the marinade that had cooked off the chicken into the rice and blended. The chicken was very juicy and flavorful- it was fabulous!

SUCH a disappointment. I can't imagine where this went wrong. Moist? Your bet, but even after a nearly 24-hour marinade, this was just ridiculously bland. I love tandoori chicken and will look for other recipes but am unlikely to make this one again.

Great. I've eaten tandoori since I was a kid and this was one of the best. Used about 10 chicken wings, full fat yogurt, added a teaspoon of ground coriander, and left out the chili. Baked near the top of the oven at 400 until golden brown. Try with a cilantro raita and coconut rice, and some lemon wedges. The skin was crispy and the meat moist and flavorful.

This was okay, though it didn't much resemble the tandoori chicken I love served in Indian restaurants. We probably won't make this again.

This recipe is very good on the grill when cooked indirectly and the chicken was very tender. It went well with a good salad such as Tabouli- yum yum!

I made this with chicken wings to serve as an hors d'oeuvres and it worked out quite well. I added the red food coloring that's part of most recipes. I also increased the ginger. Though a grill is ideal, I cooked them in the oven and was happy with the result. The chicken is so flavorful and tender that I've resolved to make it much more often.

I've used this recipe several times over the last couple of years, and I've always gotten rave reviews. Of course, I always marinate this overnight and I never use anything but one of those big packages of chicken drumsticks. I've done this on the grill in summer & in the oven in winter and it always comes out great.

I had guests for lunch and made it and they all told me they loved it.

A nice Tandoori recipe, good for mid-week meals.

This recipe was a true dissapointment. The sauce lacked complexity. It needed to be sweetened before we could eat it. In it's original form, it is definately missing something!

If you are use to good Indian food, you will hate this recipe. It is FLAVORLESS!!!

Contrary to an earlier review, I wouldn't try this with boneless, skinless chicken breasts -- I marinated them overnight and the chicken was still dry and flavorless. Yuck. Guess this is one recipe you can't try to cheat and cut fat in.

Great recipe, even with boneless, skinless breasts. Just sprinkle a bit of lemon juice on chicken--don't mix it into yogurt sauce. There will be lots of sauce, but just cook it all together and use the sauce on the chicken and on Pulao (a great basmati rice dish, see below......) Pulao--basmati rice: 1 1/2 cups basmati rice, rinsed 1 Tbsp. oil 1 1/2 tsp. cumin seeds 1 cup diced carrot 1 Tbsp. peeled, julienned ginger (optional) 1 cup frozen peas, thawed dash salt 1/4 tsp. saffron (add this to make the rice yellow and pretty) Soak rice in warm water. Heat oil in large pan, add cumin, carrots, and ginger. Cook for 4 minutes. Drain rice, add to pan with 2 1/4 cups warm water, peas, salt, and safron. Boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 8 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes. Fluff with fork and serve hot.

I really liked it - the yogurt makes the chicken very tender. I served Indonesian spiced rice with it for dinner, and it went over wonderfully.

Extrodinarily easy recipe with awesome results. Jasmine rice, sauteed spinach and baked pita bread are good sides...

This is an easy recipe and the chicken comes out moist and tender. Have made with chicken parts and also bone-in breasts for guests who prefer white meat only. Served with jasmine rice sauteed with onions and toasted cumin seed then baked in chicken broth, and a nice tomato-cucumber-cilantro based Indian salsa. Yummy!

great with a salad and just steamed rice.
