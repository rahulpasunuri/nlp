Thought the results were very good. As stated by other reviewers, it is a very poorly edited recipe, hence the 3 forks.

Delicious. I basically poached/steamed the fish because I didn't have the right equipment and it came out great. Worth sorting through the redundancies.

Ugh! agree with other commenters that the instructions are terrible and the results were bland

How on earth did this recipe escape an editor?? It sounds good and I'd like to try it--IF I can decipher the convoluted recipe.

flavors for this recipe were outstanding once one was able to sift through the horribly confusing instructions, which were often redundant.

I didn't use cilantro and the dish was still delicious. The combination of the ginger and garlic was aromatically divine.

Made this also using the lemon vinegar recipe on Epicurious to rave reviews. Marinate the fish before in a good wine mixture.

Have made it several times (my friends keep requesting it) and enjoy it each and every time! There's so much flavorful and tastes very authentic chinese.

If I could give this dish 5 forks I would. Made it for a dinner party this evening. Used fillets instead of whole snapper, but followed the recipe as presented. The flavor was more than I expected! The sauce had more solids in it than I like so I added about 3/4 cup chicken broth and let it simmer a few minutes.. Next time I will either run it thru the blender or strain out the solids. Wonderful flavor and presented itself well. Served it with Jasmine rice cooked with Indonesian bay leaves and carrots and asparagus steamed over chicken broth. I'll repeat this whole menu at my next dinner party next week!!

Used mahimahi filets instead of whole snapper, and just laid the garlic, ginger and cilantro in the steamer under the fish. Added zest and juice of 1 lime, half to steamer and half to sauce. This was awesome! I used vegetable broth instead of chicken and added about 1/2c. to the sauce. Also added shitake mushrooms and sugar snap peas. One of the best fish dishes we've ever had, even using frozen fish filets!

This was good, but need to season fish well.I used Porgy instead. The"Sauce" should have more liquid, felt shallots and garlic were too thick. Next time I'll just use more stock.
