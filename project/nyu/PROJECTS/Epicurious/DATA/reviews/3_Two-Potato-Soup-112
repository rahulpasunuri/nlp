Very ordinary flavour and very easy to over process, it gets gummy.

I'm glad I found this recipe again! I used to make this all of the time, and somehow the rosemary had morphed to Summer Savory in my mind which was also delicious! I usually start all of my soups with low sodium chicken broth (Trader Joe's 70 mg/serving) but always adjust salt and pepper to taste. This is a nicely flavored soup and very simple to make from ingredients that I usually have on hand. Glad I found it again just in time for soup weather!

Not that taste. it is definitely missing something.

Followed the recipe almost exactly except I used low-sodium chicken broth; flavor was nice but pretty bland. Very easy to make and I loved the color; next time, I will saute some leeks in butter first and then add the other ingredients, including regular chicken broth with salt. Feta cheese (as suggested by previous reviewer) jazzed up the soup a bit.

The soup has a lovely flavor and I will make it again but I couldn't find sodium-free chicken broth to save my life. Where did you all find it?

Beautiful tangerine color. Very decent puree soup, even for a non-puree enthusiast. Stump your friends with the flavor of this soup. Make sure to cool soup before blending. A little feta cheese on top goes nicely.

We are on a special diet where we need to eat six times a day - this is easy - it tastes good and I can store it in pre-packaged portions for the microwave. We LOVE it!!!

This was a hit for my guests. I've made it a few times and have had requests for the recipe. You must use fresh rosemary. I did use a bit exra garlic and I added some cream to this soup...just a dollop. We think it's simple and delicious!

I've made this one dozens of times! It's a weekly favorite. So easy, low cal, low (no) fat, and yummy!

The soup didn't have much depth of flavour to it and therefore I had to add some extra spices of my own. I was thinking of adding an onion to the recipe (chopped and sauted) to give the soup more flavour.

Boy, am I glad I tried this before I served it to 15 guests! Maybe I missed something but I thought it was tasteless, gummy and just a waste of time and energy!

I didn't have rosemary, and it was blah without. I added a little bit of each of these; lime juice, ginger, mace, brown sugar, and white pepper. It came out quite nice.

For so few ingredients, this such a flavorful soup. I did swirl a tablespoon of cream into each bowl for added smoothness and eye appeal. This can either be a first course soup or a light main course soup with a salad and piece of crusty bread.

Very easy. I used Yukon gold potatoes. The color is wonderful but next time I might add some more broth or cream at the end to make it a little smoother/creamier.

Soup is a beautiful color with a creamy texture. I didn't use rosemary, and I added an extra clove of garlic.

I made this recipe for the Passover seder last year--it got a lot of raves from my guests.
