My guests loved these. I substituted some feta for the cheddar since that seemed strange for a Greek-style appetizer. I think next time, I migh try it without the cream cheese or less cream cheese since I found the although they were good, the creamy taste was somewhat reminisant of those cream cheese pinwheels that we are subject to at most events...but don't get me wrong, they were still yummy!

I've made this several times now, always to rave reviews. Because my husband doesn't like cucumbers or onions, I make a plain one for him with just hte feta and olive mixture and he loves it as well!

I agree with the previous reviewer that kalamata olives and feta are a must. I replaced all the cream cheese with feta. Couldn't understand using cream cheese in the first place. I chose to bake these at 350 for 5-6 minutes per side. Great hit in my house!

Terrific, with caveat that kalamata olives and feta are mandatory!!! I just made this today for the first time and loved it. Used all 12 cloves of roasted garlic, replaced half the cream cheese with herbed crumbled feta, and cooked them on a griddle just lightly spritzed with olive oil, instead of butter. A little messy, but delicious. Will definitely make this again.

I did not like this that much. It was okay, but didn't really seem to have any 'oomph'. I would not make this again. Too many other appetizer recipes out there.

This is a fabulous recipe! We threw out the onions and bell peppers on personal preference, followed the advice of a past reviewer and used 2 cloves of garlic, and substituted Kalamata for black olives, sunflower for sesame seeds. To our amazement, it still turned out tasting incredible.

Spectacular! I almost didn't make these as one of my dozen appetizers, but I talked myself into it... I'm so glad I did. I baked them (after drizzling with a bit of olive oil) to eliminate the stove-top preparation... really fantastic. A great combination of cheesiness and the crunchy freshness of the cucumber salad... yum!

We had this for our gourmet group and everyone loved it.

I modified this recipe extensively. For the cheese mixture, I mixed cream cheese, chopped black olives, and feta cheese (equal amounts of the two cheeses). I used 4 or 5 cloves of garlic and baked them in olive oil per the recipe. I spread the cheese / garlic / olive mixture on flour tortillas. I used cucumbers & onions to fill a couple of the quesadillas, and roasted red peppers & onions for others. I topped each with a second tortilla and baked at 350 degrees for 10 minutes. They were a hit!

Giant hit with the gourmet club. Interesting flavors and nice look. Substituted feta in half of the quesadillas and garnished with chiffonade of mint. Great opener for lamb or chicken dinner.

I choose to believe that "12 large garlic cloves"is a typo. I used two and really, even as a lover of garlic, I will use only one the next time. I substituted feta cheese for the cream cheese and mashed it into a smooth consistency. I also plan to go a little easier on the green olives. Get the pita bread nice and dark when grilling - I think it added to the flavor. Let completed quesadillas rest for a minute or two and try slicing with a pizza cutter.
