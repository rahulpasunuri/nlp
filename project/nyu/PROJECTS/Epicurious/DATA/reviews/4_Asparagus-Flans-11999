It's a very elegant presentation, just not especially tasty. The flavor of the asparagus is very strong, but the flan tastes a little overly eggy, which doesn't complement the asparagus at all.

I made this with my 2 girls, 8 and 5 years old. Everyone had a part in it and it made them want to eat asparagus for the first time that I can remember. I did omit using the towels, just water in the pan during baking is fine. Fun and easy, would be great for guests!

What a perfect recipe! With a couple of simple modifications, it can be adapted for both carb and fat control. I make six portions with about 2/3 the asparagus, 2 egg substitute eggs, 1/3 cup grated Parmesan, 1/3 cup fat free half & half, 1/2 tsp each salt and dried tarragon and butter only for buttering the cups. I mostly serve this as the center of a mesclun salad with extra Parmesan broiled on top and the raw tips minced into the salad. Thanks, other contributors, for the suggestions that I've incorporated.

This is one of those fabulous recipes that you almost don't want to share - just keep it in your secret little recipe portfolio. I only serve it for really special occasions, and my friends and family go crazy for it!

Have made this twice now, and even in a rush haven't managed to mess it up. Great flavor...I do usually end up doubling or tripling the cheese, and adding a bit more cream so its not to heav. Yum!

This recipe is awesome! Perfect exactly as it is--don't be put off by the fresh tarragon, the flavor perfectly compliments the asperagus. I made this for a dinner party, and cooked the flan in one large souffle rather than individual souffles and it came out fine--if you do this, though, be sure to allow for extra cooking time.

Excellent and quick. Could be a "do-ahead" for a dinner party too. I made this recipe for two, using larger molds and served it as a vegetarian entree with a nice pear/walnut/blue cheese salad. Also, I used stalks only, reserving my tips for another meal. I served the flan unmolded with a sprinkling of shredded parmesan cheese and a lite dusting of paprika on top. I ran them under the broiler for a few minutes before serving. Will definitely make again.

Very light and not difficult to prepare. Made an aspragus lover out of me!
