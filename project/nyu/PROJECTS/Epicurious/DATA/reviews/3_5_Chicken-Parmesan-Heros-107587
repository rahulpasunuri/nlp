pretty good, BUT you need WAAAYYYY less eggs/bread crumbs/flour for 4 breasts - about half! I added about one chipotle pepper and 1 tablespoon of adobo sauce to the sauce and it definitely gave it a kick.

Very good and everyone in the family liked their big sandwiches. I will make these heros again.

A good recipe but, in my opinion, you don't need so many eggs or bread crumbs. I used chicken thighs instead of breasts (I think that they have more flavor) and 2 lbs of chicken thighs only required 3 eggs to coat. I also ended up throwing away over 1/2 of the breading mixture (I didn't want to save it since it had come into contact with the raw eggs). I'd make it again but this time use much less eggs and make only 1/2 the amount of breading. Also I scooped out the hero rolls and used that bread to make the fresh bread crumbs.

This is one of my favorite things to make for casual dinners...and people always ask for the recipe!! The changes I make: I use jarred tomato sauce as a shortcut, and add onion/garlic sauteed in olive oil; use pre-sliced French bread (if you use the big loaf, it ends up being a huge mouthful of bread with a little piece of chicken hidden inside); and sometimes I butter the bread slices with Lowry's garlic butter before I toast them. Delicious!!!

Absolutely fabulous! Granted, I have never had Chicken Parmesan in a restaurant, but a friend of mine makes it constantly. I really didn't know if I would like it, but it was for a party and C.P. seems to be a crowd favorite. I know it sounds horrible, but I never realized how bad my friend's C.P. was until I made this! She kept trying to get me to do it her way rather than the recipe's way and got upset when I wouldn't! The onyl change I made was to take half an onion and two to three cloves of garlic (sliced) and sautee them in the olive oil before adding the chicken. After you're done cooking the chicken, throw some flour in the olive oil/garlic/onion mixture and cook until the flour forms little crumblies. Put the "crumblies" on the bread to add flavor and it makes the whole dish even better.

Yes, a chicken parmesan sandwich makes a good meal, but this one isn't special. The sauce was extremely bland. The coating on the chicken was fairly good. I didn't like the thin chicken on a big piece of Italian bread, but that's personal preference. I might make the coating again, but that's it.

This was a very good recipe. I loved the coating on the chicken. However, I did add more seasonings to the sauce because it seemed a little sweet to me. I like a more spicer sauce.

This was delicious. I used chicken breast strips for my youngest child and the chicken breast for my my husband and I and my my 16 year old daughter they all enjoyed it.We tried with and without the bread.I was all delicious.

This is definately worth making. Next time I too will toast the bread first. Besides that, it's perfect! Can't wait for lunch tomorrow. Using the good parmesan is a must also.

Excellent! One suggestion, however, toast your bread. Then, butter it and sprinkle with garlic powder.

Delicious "comfort food." Yes, it's messy but oh so good! I cut down on the oil by frying in a non-stick skillet. Keep the bread crispier by toasting it first and lightly coating with sauce. Kids will love you for this--give everyone a bib!

Very, very, very messy. I didn't have enough bread crumbs so I had to "make" some more. Ended up using more cheese than crumbs for that mixture. It gave it a melt-in-your-mouth flavor, though, so it was good. The bottom slice of bread got a little soggy, though. And my Dad complained a lot about the mess. The recipe makes a lot, too, so I made some for leftovers tomorrow. I think next time I'll toast the bread in the oven for a couple mins. before I put toppings on, and perhaps add more seasonings to the sauce/breading?

Delicious! I have to admit that time was of the essence, so I did "cheat" (which I don't normally do) and used a jarred sauce. I did follow the rest of the recipe to a T, except I substituted Panko bread crumbs for the traditional. I like them better because they are lighter. Boy, it was outstanding. Pounding the chicken breasts thin is the key, as it makes the cooking time shorter, and makes the chicken more tender. I made this for 5 men (including my DH) who worked all day on the addition on our house, and they loved it. I toasted the buns in a 200 degree oven for about 10 minutes to make the bread lighter. Yummy!

I was looking for a Chicken Parmesan recipe and found this one. It was excellent, I followed it to the letter except that I placed the cooked chicken in a 13x15 pan, then the sauce, then the cheese and placed it in a 350 oven for around 20 minutes til the cheese melted and turned bubbly on the edges. Everyone loved it!! The tomato sauce was a hit and I now use it for many other dishes that require sauce. Definately yummy!

Very good. I used bottled marinara sauce and seasoned Italian bread crumbs. Did not use eggs. Used Second Nature - an egg substitute. I always use it instead of eggs when I'm breading anything. I'm watching my colesterol. Didn't use flour either. Not necessary if you pat breasts dry with paper towels.

This sounds delicious to me, but I think the same results can be achived more simply. I vote for a jar of good marinara sauce or if you have time to make your own favorite sauce and freeze it. 2 cups of flour is way too much. Start with 1/2 cup dredging, then season after dipping in egg. I'm a 1 egg at a time person (probably 2 here) with a teas. of water, add parmesan. Seasoned Italian bread crumbs are faster here and just as good. I'm not a deep fry person either. I don't do it that often, it's too messy and I never know what to do with all that leftover oil; so I saute (brown on both sides ) in Extra virgin olive oil needed for flavor here. Transfer to baking dish , cover with foil, bake 350o 20-25 min. --continue.

My college daughter(not much experience cooking) had great success with this recipe........it was delicious although we discarded a large amount of flour and served it over pasta.

1. Make it easy -use a jar of your favorite marinara sauce, add fresh basil leaves and minced Italian parsley for flavor. Two cans of tomatoes seems too much for the six breast halves, unless pasta is accompaniment. 2. Two eggs is plenty for dredging. Add minced parsley to the eggs, add the parmesan to that mixture. Use Italian bread -make your own crumbs easily-food processor. 3.Avoid pounding chicken to a pulp.Not necessary. 4.Using French bread or Italian Sub Rolls is a better idea. 375F oven prevents cheese burning. Takes 8 min.

When preparing this dish, you should be carefull with the chicken. Take your time and do it right. The result was great! If you like it (taste is yours) add a little paprika. Always try just a little different you like it. Keep up the good work.

This is a great recipe! For those of you having ingedient issues, I've forgone the flour, added a bit of milk to the egg and went straight for seasoned breadcumbs. I break only 1 egg at a time. Stop having fits people - if you're a true cook,you can see how to lighten a recipe and know how to improvise.

The cook from New jersey is obviously not a cook. If the amount of oil, eggs, etc., bothers you then either cut back drastically or do not use them at all. The chicken in this does not need to be fried, but I am sure it will make for a much tastier version of the recipe. Lighten up and stop making nasty comments on a recipe website.

This recipe was very good, I also like to substitute crushed Pepperidge Farm seasoned croutons for the breadcrumbs in the recipe and bake it in the oven. The chicken is so good it can be eaten by itself. The cook in New Jersy who gave this recipe one fork needs to know about moderation and nutrition. Carbohydrates are not a problem for healthy people who are not too lazy to EXERCISE! If it was your spare tire you were worried about...LAY OFF SANDWICHES!

I was actually excited to see this recipe for "Chicken Parmesean Hero" on the weekly Epicurious Recipe Flash! I've lived in NJ all my life but am currently working overseas. For someone who loves Chicken parm heros and can't seem to find any (good ones) in this country where I work, I'm glad to see this recipe. I don't care which country it's from, or which state's cook recommends it, I will definitely try it this weekend (with more seasonings as seems recommended)! Looking forward to taste the familiar!

Good, basic recipe, not outstanding but a good base to play with the seasonings. A dash of chili flakes in the sauce and some fresh herbs, and a dash of dried herbs ie. oregano for the breading. As I say a good jump-off point.
