had peas instead of beans- was a great, complex dish that was easier to make than i thought it would be. served it with couscous.

This dish was delicious. I did make a few changes though. The beans took longer than 3 minutes to cook. They were still raw and needed additional time. Also used olive oil instead of butter except for about 1 TBL. Used a premade pesto instead of basil in the sauce for the fish. YUM

I don't know what the issue is with the reviews about Rosh Hashanah. This is a recipe from David Waltuck's restaurant in New York. The cuisine is nouvelle French, not Kosher (except for the salt). If you keep Kosher, don't make it. If you don't, enjoy! It was delicious! Had some speckled butter beans and fresh sweet corn from my organic farmbox this week. Wonderful!

Oh man did I love this. I made it with favas and these funky famers' market shallots and baby red onions...this is wonderful. And that's despite the fact that I still can't make a good beurre blanc.

A traif recipe for Rosh Hashanah!???? Come on, Epicurious. That's offensive. Too bad we can't flag a recipe as "inappropriate."

Please, if you are going to recommend a recipe for Rosh Hashanah, at least make it Kosher. Suggest that Chicken stock can be replaced with vegetable stock and suggest and other alterations in the recipe that is necessary in order to compensate for flavor changes. It's not really that difficult, but for cooks without substitution experience, it may be a challenge. While many Jews may not keep kosher, there are a sufficient number of us who do, and it would be nice if we had recipes that were already adjusted for our requirements, especially when they are touted as "a Rosh Hashanah dinner".

Great dish. Made it for the first night of Rosh Hashanah. Noone in my family would admit they liked lima beans before this. Really tasty. And I even followed the recipe with no tweaks.
