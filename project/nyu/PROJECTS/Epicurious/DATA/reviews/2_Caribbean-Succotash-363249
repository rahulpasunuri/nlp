Sorry, I wouldn't call this dish a hit. The cucumber seemed strange with the other vegetables, and the coconut milk, which sounded innovative and fresh, only served to mask the flavors of the beans and vegetables.

Was excited to see this recipe while browsing magazines at the airport coming back from the Caribbean. Both my wife and I think this recipe is missing something. The dish smelled great, but the taste was a bit bland. After two bites, we tried doubling the coconut milk and the spices. That helped considerably, but I still wouldn't rave about this dish. Served with rice, makes for a decent, fairly light and satisfying meal. Has potential, but still needs a bit of tweaking to get up to 3 forks.
