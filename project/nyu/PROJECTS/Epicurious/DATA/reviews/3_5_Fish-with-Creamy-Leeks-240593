Super easy and quite delicious. Will definitely make again--will sub Greek yogurt and use pre-portioned frozen cod fillets. I can tell it will come out great.

Made for the 5th time tonight. I save 4 forks for really outstanding recipes, but this is really very good. Go-to weeknight recipe. And it gets requested by my boyfriend who doesnt reallly like fish. I've made it both with chardonnay and greek yogurt and as written exactly. Very good either way, but yogurt separated slightly. As to the previous cook's review--- if you change the recipe, dont review 'your' recipe. Its no longer the same dish.

Made this for the 2nd time last night, and was not impressed. The 1st time I made it I gave it 4 forks, and I don't know what went wrong this time. The leeks disintegrated, the sauce curdled and was like water, and the Pollock was flavorless. Perhaps subbing no-fat Greek yogurt for sour cream? Or maybe my Pollock (Alaskan caught) were too small--do they come in different sizes, depending upon where caught?? Half of one of these fish was only about 7" long, and very thin. I would hardly call these "thick" fillets. I'll try this recipe again, but with salmon, more leeks, and stir the flour into the butter and leeks to start with. Also, white wine to replace the 1st water addition. Perhaps this will help. Call me NOT HAPPY this time!!

Really easy and tasty. I used Fage 0% instead of the sour cream, and modified the procedure to avoid the separation factor. Started with just leeks and butter in pan, sauted for few mins. Sprinkled flour over and cooked for few more mins. Deglazed pan w/ white wine (instead of the water). Added seasoned fish to pan and covered for 8-10 mins. Turned off heat and plated fish. Stirred Fage into leeks and poured that over fish.)

Excellent weeknight recipe. Easy and fast, with ingredients I always have on hand. I used salmon, which was delicious. I can't wait to try it with halibut and other fish.

This is a keeper. Next time I may cut back a little on the sour cream or perhaps substitute creme fraiche to lighten and brighten it up just a little, but even as written it was a great way to prepare fish simply without sacrificing flavor or richness.

I made this for my family the other night and it was an instant hit. I used (frozen) flounder and it worked perfectly with the flavor of the sauce. It did fall apart a bit while cooking, but we still scraped the pan clean, trying to get those last little bits. I also added the dill do the sauce when I put the fish in, along with a splash of lemon juice. Next time, we're going to serve it on a bed of linguine, and I plan on experimenting some time in the near future with other types of seafood. Possibly scallops or shrimp.

This was really good and very, very simple to make. I used halibut, and the cooking directions were perfect - not undercooked and not dry. Next time I may try it with low fat sour cream - I'm sure it'll be just as good.

so good! I used chicken broth instead of water, half tbsp butter and fat-free sour cream - it was still extremely creamy and rich, and went very well with the salmon we cooked.

I usually choose more Mediterranean recipes for fish, but I had some lovely leeks I wanted to use so I thought I would give this a try. Perhaps it's my Scandinavian and Welsh heritage, but I found this to be delicious(as did my Irish and Alsatian husband). Simple yet flavorful in a mild, slightly sweet leek-y way. I used halibut, and the leeks were fresh from the farm stand, which may have helped. The sauce was thin though, perhaps because I used 3 instead of 2 leaks. I would not add the second 1/3 cup water next time, and I didn't find that putting the flour in the sour cream at the beginning worked as a roux or added anything. I might try adding a roux at the end next time to make it creamier. I served it with boiled fingerling parsley potatoes and peas, which worked great for a homey meal.

This was really tasty, and REALLY simple. I used broth instead of water, and I think it added just the right amount of flavor to the sauce. I also threw in some small red potatoes chopped into inch-sized pieces in with the leeks as they began to cook, and left them in for the rest of the cooking time. I didn't have much sour cream, so I substituted mostly heavy cream and some fresh lemon juice. It turned out great. When I added the fish, I placed a legged steamer with some thin asparagus above the whole pan and covered it all with a wok that was the same width as the pan. When the fish was done, so was the asparagus, and I dripped some of the sauce atop it while serving. The whole thing took 25 minutes, knife to plate. An impressive yet quick dinner. Probably would work great with chicken breasts and onions or shallots if you don't have leeks and fish.

My family enjoyed this recipe. I only made one change I used white wine instead of water. The creamy sauce works well with the slightly crisp leeks. I used alaskan pollock.

Really good! Took the advice of other users and swapped the first 1/3 of water with vermouth. Also, sauteed 2 strips of finely chopped bacon before adding butter, leeks, etc.

i was not good. Didn't like it at all. Would have been ok as pie filling but the leek sauce didn't work for me or my husband. it looked bad, tasted worst. i used cod, the leek was all stringy and made the suace gunky. this was me cooking the fish seperately so that it didn't fall apart in the sauce (i did return the sauce to which the fish was cooked) i suggest cooking the leek, fish and sauce seperately if you really want to make this dish.

Rating: 3
This was delightfult...I used 1/3 of a cup of white vermouth in place of the first water amount and I used half fat sour cream. I also squeezed in 2 lbs of frozen pollock into the pan. Delicious! Next time if I use frozen fish again I will double the flour though as the fish gave off a lot of juices.

Yuck. I use Epicurious about 4 times a week for recipes. This is hands down the worst thing I have ever tried from this site. No flavor, bland and frankly unappetizing on the plate. Zero forks

This recipe was fantastic! When I make this again, I will double the leek sauce recipe. It was just my husband and I, and I could have eaten a lot more. I can't imagine how this would feed 4 people. Other than that, though, this was a quick and easy dish that feels really gourmet - definitely brings wow factor to weeknight meals. Also, I used wild caught Alaskan halibut - perfect!

Simple and very tasty. Instead of sour cream, I used plain yogurt (which separated during the last part of the cooking time so I wouldn't recommend trying that!) and the dish had a great taste. Served with rice like another reviewer suggested and that worked great to soak up the (separated!) juices. Will make again.

Rating: 4
A keeper! Used white wine in the first step with the leeks, water when I added the sour cream...the only complaint I had was not enough! My husband took down the thin tilapia instead of the sword fish that I intended for it so we only had 12oz of fish. Very nice.

Rating: 4
Wonderful! I used white wine vinegar rather than water or wine. It added a tang to the sauce. A big hit with the husband and the diet! Will definitely make again.

Simple, easy and delicious. I used fresh pacific cod. Subbed white wine for water. Versatile sauce for nearly any white fish or salmon. Easy to improv with too. My only gripe would be cooking the fish with the sauce - I'd bake or broil it on its own and get the top browned up and pour the sauce over to finish. Served over a bed of mashed potatoes & steamed carrots. Looking forward to playing around with this.

From the suggestion of other reviewers, I substituted white wine for the water. I also sliced the leeks in half lengthwise instead of in rings. I find they're easier to wash that way and make a nice presentation. The recipe has great flavor, is fairly fast and very easy to make. This is something I would make again for guests.

This is fabulous and easy. I cut the leeks in half and then sliced them lengthwise -- it makes a more interesting bed of creamy veggies. I also just grilled a 2 lb salmon fillet with dill and then placed it on top of the bed of leeks on a platter, surrounding the fish with quartered small red potatoes with butter and more dill. Great for company and easy enough for family.

Tasty and satisfying. I used vermouth for the second 1/3 cup, and since I have tarragon growing in my garden and not dill, I used the tarragon on top. For the fish: Turbot. Came out light and creamy. Served it over rice.

Love this dish. Easy, tasty, fast - what's not to love? I recently started adding some bacon pieces to the dish, rendering it first, then adding some brandy in the pan and using the bacon fat/brandy instead of butter when the leeks go in. Bacon + Leeks = yummy! Serve with a grain of some sort to soak up the sauce and a green side, and you have a winning quick-fix dinner for any night, any occassion. Recommend Tilapia, as it cooks faster and I found thicker fish (i.e. Cod) to be too watery and makes the sauce too thin.

I know this recipe has received good reviews, but I didn't really like it. Perhaps it was my choice of fish (mahi mahi) but I also didn't like the sour cream flavor. Perhaps with some tweaking (like adding some shallots and white wine) I might have liked it more.

When I made this last night, the creamy leek sauce was EXCELLENT, even though I used low-fat sour cream. Used 4 oz. pre-frozen cod fillets (probably not Alaskan, since they were "wild caught", and a product of China--had bought them quite a while ago before the scandal about Chinese imports). I resisted the urge to open the skillet and check the cod for doneness until the 10 minutes had passed. One of the fillets was rubbery. Had the fish been better, this would deserve 5 forks!!

This was just great and so easy to prepare! The sauce makes the dish taste like you aren't eating FISH. I followed the recipe exactly, but I didn't use the parchment because I didn't feel like cutting it to fit. I used sole this time, Next time I will add some fennel with the leeks, and maybe a bit more dill as I didn't really get that flavor coming through. There is nothing not to like about this dish. I will make again.

The leek sauce is amazing. What a nice complement to a white fish dish. My girlfriend loved it and it was easy. I too used white wine instead of water. I served red potatoes, brussel sprouts and pinot gris with it.

I had this at a friend's house last week and loved every bite of it. All of the flavors are so delicate in this dish, which were perfectly matched with the surprisingly light whole-grain mustard and Irish cheddar mashed potatoes. I think they added some celeriac to the leeks, adding a nice smooth flavor to balance the leeks. I'm making it tonight with roasted sweet potatoes!!!

Great dish! I substituted olive oil for the butter and non-fat yogurt for the sour cream because they were what I had on hand. Since yogurt has a higher water content, I left out the second 1/3 cup water and it was still on the watery side. Might not want to use yogurt when company is coming, though because it produced some "curd flowers."

Served this New Year's Eve using tilapia and everyone raved about it. I've made it since with sweet onions when I had no leeds; leeks are better. I tried it without parchment and found the sauce too liquid, plus I think it keeps the fish better. So easy and plates nicely, it will stay in my recipe box. Jeanne

This is a very nice and simple recipe. I used Alaska Cod and substituted 1/3 cup of gewurztraminer vinegar (see www.valentinefarm.com) for the water. I had no dill so omitted it. Served with Yukon gold potato and asparagus, side salad etc, and a pinot gris. Lovely.

This was delicious. I used sole (no skin) and simmered the fish in the sauce as indicated. The only change I made was to use potato water (from cooking potatoes) instead of tap water for more flavour and nutrition. Mashed potatoes are an excellent accompaniment since they soak up the sauce.

This was so easy and delicious. I've been looking for new and different fish recipes and this really hit the spot. I 'melted' the leeks and followed the other reviewer's advice to start the fish fillets in the oven - I seasoned the fillets and put them in a glass dish with olive oil and baked at 350 for 10 minutes, just until they weren't translucent. The skin peeled off easily and i warmed them in the sauce for about 7 or 8 minutes on med-low heat. Served these with mashed potatoes/parsnip and buttered peas - really nice and elegant for a weeknight dinner.

I loved the leek portion of this recipe! I used red snapper, and it was ok, but a little fishy for my taste-- perhaps it sat in the fridge too long? Anyhow, I'll definitely make this again, perhaps with another type of white fish, or maybe even chicken. Definitely quick and easy.

So quick, so easy, so yummmy! I baked my fish to remove the skin until it was almost ready then added it to the sauce. Served it with whole wheat pasta.

Oh heavens, this was so bad. Maybe I used the wrong kind of fish. I thought it would be good. Fish = good! Leeks = good! This was weird and kind of slimy. Even my Maine coon cat who weighs 26 pounds and eats *everything* walked away from this. As I'm writing this it occurs to me I must have had bad fish. So, I guess, if you make it, make sure your fish is good. Part of me wants to try it again with good fish, but the other part of me shudders when I think about eating it again. So sad.

Made the other night. Great week night dinner. Partner loved it. Can't wait to make again, used Cod, would make with any mild fish (tilapia, haddock etc.)
