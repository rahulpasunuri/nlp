Further to my soup binge this weekend... Made this recipe as directed, along with the good advice from reviewers to make the chicken meatballs small and double the quantity. Yumm. Plenty in the freezer now for quick meals and elderly father. Common sense definitely dictates cooking chicken meatballs fully if not going immediately into hot broth ;-)

lots of work for such a blah meal. Good, not great.

The soup was particularly good the next day. A few thoughts: ensure your garlic is very finely chopped and that the meatballs are teeny. I got a little lazy rolling mine near the end and the bigger ones were chewy. If you have any spare fresh or frozen pesto, roll the meatballs in that before dropping them into the soup. I did that belatedly, with only a few, and they were delicious.

This recipe is beyond delicious!! So easy and so healthy! My whole family loved it!! (even my son who is a bit of a picky eater!!)

I love this recipe as does my husband. The only thing I changed was I used ground turkey for the meatballs since I had it on hand. I thought everything worked great at the specified amounts. It also freezes well if we don't end up eating all of the leftovers.

I doubled the recipe and found that it had way too much garlic in the meatballs and soup. It's very tasty, but next time I would cut the garlic in half.

This soup can be made in a cinch, literally less than 40 minutes! It is innovative and nutritious, with almost all the food groups inside. It´s called Spring minestrone, but I find it perfect for a light fall lunch served with crusty bread and butter on the side plus a nice Pinot Noir.

I LOVE this soup with the following tweaks: Add cayenne pepper to meatballs, & bake instead of fry. Add equal amount of asparagus as carrots. Use Isreali Couscous instead of pasta. And of course double the recipe!

I cook a lot, and rarely do i get a request to add this to the regular repotoire, as i did here. Definitely definitely double this recipe, and freeze leftovers. 6 ounces of gorund meat is an akward amount to buy anyway, and if you're doing the work, you might as well have double. The meatballs are DELICIOUS, and i can't wait to make them again... maybe as a party appetizer with toothpicks? I used a food processor for the garlic and other meatball ingreadients and i think that made a good difference in really getting a good garlic flavor throughout. The only twaek i'd make is to use homemade broth since canned broth is a little bland

I have made this twice now and would offer the following suggestions. MEATBALLS: Double the quantity but keep them small (I used a melon-baller for size). Use 12 oz. ground chicken. Use panko for the breadcrumbs (1 cup). Green onions are a fine substitute for chives here. BROTH: Do not double but please go all out and use free-range, organic, whatever chicken broth, not low-sodium unless absolutely necessary. Acini di pepe (De Cecco brand no. 78) is the perfect pasta here. We loved how by day two the little pastas soaked up the broth but hadn't turned to mush. By the way, dump the whole little plastic box of organic baby spinach in; really there's not enough to save. And finally, if you take no other advice from me, please, please, please refrain from adding the final 3 tablespoons of Parmesan to the pot according to directions unless you enjoy the sensation of melted cheese coating the roof of your mouth and the back of your teeth, not to mention scrubbing and scrubbing your pot afterwards. Save yourself that trouble and sprinkle on individual servings. The basil is a must. Loved it and will make it again and again.

I made this for dinner tonight, I had to make a few substitutions due to finding out at the last minute that I was short of some ingredients (had to add some sausage de piment d'esplette to the chicken as I did not have enough to complete, added some cilantro instead of chives because I had forgotten to buy) The hubby and kids (3&6) all loved it and had thirds ! Was this soup exceptional ? No, but it was very tasty and a change to the soups that we eat.

This soup was easy to make and would be a good weeknight dinner. I followed the recipe exactly, if I make this again I will definitely add additional vegetables.

The meatballs come out incredible. So good that I'm considering making them by themselves as appetizers for a party!

The meatballs are fantastic. I had to make a pound's worth, so I made them 1-inch size. I had to add a can of cannellini beans to make it a real minestrone. Delicious with the fresh basil on top and a splash of EVOO! Perfect for this psuedo-winter weather we are having.

I used turkey instead of chicken reduced the breadcrumbs to 1/4c I used elbow macaroni (because I had it at home) and reduced to 1/2 cup. If I expected to have leftovers, next time I would cook the pasta separately and add to bowls before serving. If left in the soup, the pasta soaks up the broth. I increased spinach to 2 cups Great everyday soup...will definitely make again, and again!

This was especially good. I used ground chicken thighs and made the meatballs an inch size as it was tedious to make so many small ones. They were good on their own. I was concerned the this would be bland based on some previous comments. I used the Imagine brand broth which seems to have more flavor than the yellow water sold in the stores. I added a can of crushed tomatoes along with some dried oregano, thyme, dried basil and some Italian herb mix.

Outstanding! This soup met with rave reviews from all that had it, even my picky, picky 6 year old. I boiled my pasta separately and then added it to each soup bowl as I plated it up. I'm not a fan of pasta sitting in broth sucking up all the yummy liquid. I used low sodium broth, as it called for, but next time I'll make it will half low sodium and half regular broth. These meatballs could be used in a variety of recipes. I could see them in pasta or skewered & grilled. Do yourself a favor and make this recipe now!

This was very good. I definitely don't see it as being exceptional. Not sure if I'd make it again for the time involved but I would recommend you try it and see and I am glad I made it and I'll say yes for now. I took another suggestion and simmered my broth for 30 minutes in half an onion, thyme and carrots first for added flavor - then strained. I wish I would have read the review about too much pasta before I made it. I used orzo and it defintely soaked up all the broth and I had to add an extra can. Next time I would use a lot less pasta and maybe make and keep it separate.

This recipe is OK. Not great, not terrible. The best part was the garlic bread I made on the side for dipping, but it's definitely lacking something. I will not make it again.

Everyone loved this. Have made it many times now. It is so very easy and delicious! Make it on Sunday and everyone can eat it all week. Used ground turkey instead of chicken.

The family really liked this. Using a good parmesan gives it a little more bite. Its a keeper for me. Used turkey instead of chicken.

Great way to use up veggies. The meatballs were very flavorful, I would use them in other dishes. The soup overall was VERY tasty!

Rating: 3
The flavor of the soup is great. One major caveat though -- the recipe calls for a ridiculous amount of pasta. 3/4 cup uncooked is way too much! The pasta in my soup soaked up almost all the liquid and is overwhelming. I would say to use no more than 1/4 uncooked pasta.

This was a great week night meal with lots of flavor. I accidentally put all 6 tbsps of cheese in the meatballs instead of dividing the cheese like the recipe says. They turned out delicious. I will definitely make it again and serve it with some crusty french bread. I plan on doubling the recipe to make sure I have leftovers!

Made this on a cool rainy day, and it turned out very tasty. Used a full pound of group chicken, and browned them in a cast iron skillet while the broth and vegetables were simmering in another pot (was in a hurry to get dinner on). I used regular yellow onion instead of leeks, and added fresh spinach at the end, increasing all the vegetables to account for more meatballs. We really enjoyed it and the leftovers were equally tasty. We'll make this again.

This was as amazing as it was easy. With regard to flavorless broth, I always take low sodium chicken broth and simmer it for 30 minutes with half an onion, a chopped up celery stalk and a cut up carrot, with fresh parsley and thyme, then strain. Really boosts the flavor. That being said, THOSE MEATBALLS ARE THE BOMB! I could eat this soup every day. You won't be disappointed.

Delish! Some other reviewers found the broth lacking flavor, so I added parsnips and a Parmesan rind and a little rosemary, and it was really tasty. I'm currently in Germany and couldn't find ground chicken, so made the meatballs from ground pork, and they were super. I also cooked the leeks and the rest of the soup in the same pot as I'd browned the meatballs, so a lot of nice fond was picked up by the broth (I wasn't sure if that was supposed to happen, but it worked out really well).

This was good, not great. I think I would omit the garlic in the meatballs if I made it again - it gave them an "off" flavor once added to the soup.

This is a great spring soup. I followed the recipe without any additions or omissions. I would recommend this soup. I may add peas or other spring vegetables next time. The meatballs would work great in other recipes as well- very versatile.

Fantastic spring soup! Agreed, these meatballs were amazing, we accidentally made too many but froze them for spaghetti later. I actually made them with ground turkey and they were delicious. We also added zucchini and the kids enjoyed it as well.

Delicious spring soup, light and healthy, with fantastic meatballs! I did however, find the flavor to be lacking, and added Italian seasoning, extra garlic, sun-dried tomato flakes, and a bit more salt. I also tossed in some celery, zucchini, and fresh, halved, cherry tomatoes. Will make again!

Meatballs are fantastic! Made extra and froze them, probably for use as an hors d'ouevre or to incorporate into a pasta next time. I substituted rapini instead spinach which my bf and I both loved, and added some diced potatoes.

The meatballs are really what make this soup special. I had a full pound of ground chicken so I doubled the recipe and froze half of the meatballs for the next time I make this. I would probably swap out the spinach for kale next time to give it more depth of flavor, and perhaps try other veggies too. Otherwise, it was quite good!

Rating: 3
This was very tasty--I used lacinato kale instead of spinach (adding it a bit earlier) and put frozen peas in at the end as well. I will say that it wasn't quite as flavorful as I would have liked, so I ended up adding a lot of lemon pepper, rosemary, and salt at the end.

Came out great. My husband loved the meatballs. I will be making this again. My sister-in-law stopped by while I was preparing, and she was wowed by the smells. Next day she asked for the recipe.
