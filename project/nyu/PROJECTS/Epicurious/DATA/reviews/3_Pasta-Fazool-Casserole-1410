An easy hearty tasty dish for a cold winter night. Next time I would add more tomato sauce since I found this a little dry. But tasty nonetheless. This is a dish that you can put your own signature on quite easily - type of pasta, beans, veggies, etc. A nice hearty casserole dish!

This is not gourmet by an me means, but it is good, quick and filling. It is a great for a busy family. It is more like baked ziti than hamburger helper. I assembled it the night before and threw it into the oven for dinner on a night when everyone was on a different schedule. It was delicious

Quite good! I had to substitute a few items like the fonatanella cheese which is excellent and grates easily. Other than that I stuck to the recipe and am well please with this twist on an old Italian favorite.

A family favorite. Substitute hot sausage,cannelini beans and freshly chopped thyme and oregano. The flavors really jump out.

This is a good, easy recipe that welcomes substitutions. To lighten things a bit, I used hot Italian turkey sausage and ground turkey, instead of pork sausage and ground beef. I also used sundried tomato paste instead of regular. The result was a hearty, tasty dish, and guests at a potluck ate plenty and I received some compliments. The reviewers here who have mentioned that the dish is dry and recommended not draining the tomatoes are absolutely right--thanks! Be sure to take their advice. I used diced tomatoes and all the juice--and the juice was needed. I also think Fontina is a much better choice than provolone cheese (tastier, creamier) and I used extra. In my opinion, this dish is best served right out of the oven--if you let it sit or reheat it, the pasta soaks up the sauce and gets mushy. So, I'd say it's adequate--easy to make, simple fare for a the family or for very, very casual entertaining. But it's definitely not an "ooh and aaahh" kind of dish!

I've actually made this three times, and each time was disappointed. I'm not expecting anything much--I just want a basic, quick, weeknight, hambuger "hotdish" type dish, and this isn't it. It's dry, flavorless, and not very quick; altoghether a real let-down.

This is by no means high class cuisine, but it's a great way to clean out the fridge on a Sunday afternoon. It's one of those recipes you can fool with to suit your tastes and what you have on hand. For example, I think it's a little more elegant with cannelini beans, rather than kidneys, and I add about 3/4 c. chopped olive-packed SD tomatoes. I also layer it with a little provolone and top it with fontina, so I get a 3-cheese effect. Then I bake and serve it in individual gratin dishes, and it seems a little more special. Oh, and definitely don't drain your tomatoes.

Rating: 3
Here's the deal - yes this is glorified American Chop Suey, but who cares. The only question is whether people enjoy it. My family did & it looks like other do as well. I added 1/2 the cheese to the mixture, and then topped with the rest. I liked the crunchy cheese top. Next time, I too will add juice from the tomatoes. I also used a pasta that was macaroni-sized circumferance, but cut 1/4 of the length.

I used to make this casserole many years ago and then forgot all about it til I found the recipe again on the web-site. Still easy and delicious. I usually make it ahead and then can just pull it out of the freezer on a busy night. Just toss together a salad and we're good to go for dinner.

I have made this dish since it was published in Bon Appetit. For the first few years with slightly less cayenne as I was feeding toddlers then and have progressively increased it as they grew. We have always loved it and so has anybody else I've served it to. I will say that when I freeze the second half of my sauce (as I always make a double batch)I find it helps to heat it back up before mixing with the pasta and have on ocassion added some liquid (chicken broth, wine, tomato sauce).

This recipe has a lot of potential, but boy, does it need help. It definitely needs about twice the amount of beans called for. It also needs a bucketload more spices than called for! I added more than a full tablespoon or oregano), 1 tblsp. Herbes de Provence, and a good dose of dried chili flakes. It was also too dry, so I added some chicken broth, which really helped both the texture and the flavor. Lastly, I decided to stir in the cheese, rather than leave it on top, which thickened the sauce and made it rich and creamy. Finally, it was a dish I felt was at least worthy of note.

This is a staple at our house. We love it! I use crushed tomatoes and alternate between Fontina, Provolone and Mozzarella. It is simple, tasty and the leftovers fly out of our refrigerator.

I made this for my picky picky family last night. Everyone loved it. I used ground venison and venison hot italian sausage. The meat was very lean so it wasn't at all greasy. I used diced tomatoes and didn't drain them and Mozzarella cheese and white kidney beans. This was a very easy and satisfying dish. I will make it again and again.

Made this following ALL reviewer suggestions, and it was delicious. I substituted mozzarella for the fontina-I found the Italian fontina to be a bit pricey, although it probably has more flavor than mozz. Maybe next time I'll spring for it.

This is a nice recipe. I took everyone's advice and doubled the spices and did not drain the tomatoes. I like the flavor of sausage, but I do not necessarily need to eat big chunks of it in every bite. Next time, I will use 3/4 or 1/2 the spicey sausage. My sausage-loving husband even found it to be a little much. Very meaty dish, but good!

Great winter one-dish meal to please everyone who likes Italian food (which is everyone, right?), and it makes plenty for leftovers. I used tomato puree per a previous reviewer's suggestion. Good recipe--who cares that it's not anyone's great-great-grandmother's!

Rating: 4
This was fabulous and easy! I took the advice of others and used tomato puree, hot sausage, and doubled the spices. Turned out wonderful! One thing I noted is that it doesn't take very long in the oven - definitely not a half an hour. I have a gas oven that cooks quickly and it was only in for 15 minutes and it was starting to get over done. Be sure to check it while it is cooking so it doesn't burn - the point is to have the cheese melt which didn't take long in my oven.

The final product was very good. Here are some suggestions - alterations. Drain the grease off the meat, double the spices, and don't drain the tomatoes.

I love this recipe...and so does everyone else I serve it to. It's especially good for casual dinner parties...add a green salad and a loaf of italian bread and you're good to go! Go ahead and change or add anything you want to the recipe...it's very accommodating.

I'm a full blooded italian and I grew up on the real, authentic pasta e fagiole from Mom. Although it's nowhere near authentic, it's delicious anyway - made it for my entire family (mom & dad included) and everyone loved it. I added red wine to the meat(after draining) and I used cannellini beans (more authentic) instead of kidney. Make sure to use a good quality italian sausage (not turkey, chicken, soy)because it really stands out in the dish. Everyone really enjoyed this and it will be repeated!

This is kind of the dullest dish in Dullsville. I made it for my man -- who just loves anything cheesey and saucey -- and he agreed with me that the cass can't decide if it wants to be Mexican or Italian. Maybe it was the veggie sausage I used, but the housebound friend to whom I proudly delivered this à la meals on wheels didn't have a word to say about it. It's okay, it's certainly quick, affordable and easy, but it needs less cheese, more Italian-specific spices, fresh tomatoes, and white beans; alternatively different cheese, more Mexi-cific spices, a habanero or two, fresh tomatoes and kidneys.

I followed the directions to a "t" and neither I nor my husband really cared for it. He is a 1st generation Italian-American, so I trust his judgement on "Italian" food. The only thing I can think of that may have ruined it is that I froze it prior to cooking it. Any feedback on this?

I substituted chopped tomatoes and wide egg noodles. This made it easier to shop at large generic grocery stores. This was my first casserole and it was a big hit.

I cut the recipe in half and it still made a ton (four very generous servings, or maybe even five since the food is quite heavy.) This is a good cold/rainy weather meal, since it's so dense. I followed one chef's advice and just used sausage, but next time I'd cut the meat down to 3/4 lb instead of a whole pound (there really was a ton of food). I also used diced tomatoes in sauce (tomato puree) instead of drained diced tomatoes and paste, and it came out quite nice. I used hot turkey sausage as well, and about three times the amount of cayenne they ask for (we like things spicy). Good stuff, I'll make it again when the weather turns!

Bland? Boring? Did you forget the cayenne? Did you forget the cheese? Did you forget the oregano and thyme (I used fresh, but I don't think that could have made the difference between "bland" and REALLY FRIGGIN AWESOME!) maybe the sausage? you must have forgotten something, cuz this stuff is TASTY....although, I don't know how you're expected to fit it all in the one dish. I used the dish called for and dumped the rest into a casserole.

This dish was terrific! I substituted the 28 oz of plum tomatoes with "diced tomatoes in puree" and omitted the tomato paste. I used red pepper flakes instead of cayenne pepper, (because I like the flavor better) and added a full tsp. of thyme. I didn't have kidney beans on hand, so I just used the pasta. And I used Mont. Jack Cheese instead of fontina. My husband LOVED this dish!!

MAMA MIA! Four forks for flavor, an extra fork for ease! Gotta drain the sausage, DON'T drain the tomatoes! A splash of wine would certainly be good! I had provolone--was great. Mozz. would be good as well as fontina. It was gobbled up in no time flat! Went for one last bite before bed time & someone had beat me to the little bowl of left overs. I hate when that happens! Now I have to make it again!

Seeing all the comments about it being dry, I did not drain the tomatoes and I added some white wine. I used vegetarian sausage crumbles so it was completely meatless (the carnivores didn't notice). It was great- no leftovers!

We enjoyed the recipe. It is an easy dinner for those times when we really don't feel like cooking anything major. Leftovers are great for lunches during the week. We cut out the hamburger and made it only with the Italian sausage as we aren't huge meat eaters.

I found this rather dry. I substituted rinsed black beans for the kidney beans-they were a little less overwhelming. To remedy the dryness I made a white sauce to which I added the tomato paste and a handful of grated cheese. I mixed it into the mixture and added extra cheese.

While I have not made this recipe, I would like to make a vegetarian conversion comment to the previous reviewer. I'd recommend using 16 oz. tempeh in place of the 2 pounds of meat. Heat about 2 tablespoons olive oil, and saute the tempeh and all the listed ingredients typically sauted with the sausage and burger. Tempeh can usually be found next to tofu in the grocery store.

I made this dish for superbowl, and not many people took it -- so it may need something appetizing on top to make it prettier, but it is delicious. I don't agree that it was easy to make, however. I found it just as time-consuming to make as lasagna, with all that pre-frying of the meats. Sausage or hamburger alone would be just as good -- you don't taste 2 distinct meats in this anyway. I also do not agree that this is fatty. There is no need for this or any other dish to come out fatty! All you have to do -- when you fry the meats with onion -- is drain off all but a few tablespoons of fat (which should be retained for flavor). Then you will not have a fatty dish! This definitely is better the second day; and I seldom say this about any recipe, but in this case it is true. I would like to know how to convert this to an all vegetarian dish becuase we get guests who are veggies often.

This recipe tastes more liked baked ziti than pasta e fagioli except that it is missing all of that wonderful mozzarella cheese. I had to add an extra can of tomatoes because it seemed to dry. The flavor of the sausage was good but it still seemed to be missing something. Make baked ziti instead!

Rating: 3
I've made this a couple times. Beans add a nice contrast to smooth pasta. Twice, though, I've added a 14.5 oz can of tomatoes instead of a 28-oz. - my own fault. Fontina a real treat: I liked it better when I cubed the fontina and mixed it in. Popular with old and young, easy to make. I've rinsed regular sausage and hamburg to remove grease (cust by 30%), and have used turkey - prefer former.

My husband really enjoyed this dish. Pursuant to the previous reviews, I added Newman's Own Pasta Sauce. This actually tasted better the next day. I added a little tomato juice and reheated it in the micro.

I rated this a three with the following revisions and reasons: This is excellent for a group. I made it for 45 people who descended on my house for Thanksgiving weekend and it could not have been easier. I really drain those sausages though. Otherwise it is swimming in oil. I reserve some for sauteeing veggies. When I make it for big groups I use white beans and kidneys and toss in other veggies I want to ditch out of the fridge. I also add about 3 times the garlic. Hot italian sausage is a must. I also saw that they encouraged making your own pasta. Bah humbug. The effort would be lost on this dish. Besides, simplicity is one of its virtues.

Rating: 4
If Italian sausage is pre-cooked in microwave, most of the fat will be be rendered. About 4-5 minutes, covered, depending on how much sausage you are using. The ground beef can be pre-cooked as well to render a good deal of the fat. Then proceed with saute with onion, etc. This receipe sounds like a real winner. I will be making it next week for a crew of 5 sailors, on an overnight sailing race. They can reheat in the boat's oven for PM meal, warm them up and "stick to the rib" meal for the middle of night stamina. Will report on my hubby's & crew review of dish after the race, end of Sept.

This was very fatty. I put the leftovers in the freezer, but nobody ate them and I tossed them 6 months later.

I have made this dish many times and have modified it somewhat. I use hot Italian Turkey Sausage, extra-lean ground beef and I substitute provolone cheese for the fontina cheese. If you drain the beef and sausage very well before adding the rest of the ingredients it turns out better. This serves a crowd! So when I have lots of dinner guests I serve this with Caesar salad and Italian bread.

Everyone in my family loves this dish, but I made a few modifications: I use white kidney beans instead of the red, use about 10 cloves of garlic, and we go real easy on the sausage (we use 2 sausages which is less than a half pound. Use the hot sausage for more zest.
