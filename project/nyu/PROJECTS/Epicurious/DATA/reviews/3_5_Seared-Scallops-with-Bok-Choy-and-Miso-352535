This was so good and so easy and impressed everyone. I added sliced red peppers to the dish. And next time I will add wild mushrooms. Can't wait to use this sauce on blanched asparagus. Heck, on everything.

Love this recipe and shared it with my sister. Her husband said they were the best scallops he ever had and they are "foodies". I leave out the ginger because my wife doesn't like it and it is still great. May try with shrimp instead of scallops.

Lots of reviewers mention "dry packed" Scallops...something I'm not aware of but will ask for at the store. The reviewer whose Bok Choy was still hard might have found older Bok Choy...smaller is often equal to younger and more tender. If you must, saute the stem parts ahead about 1 minute, about the same time you would add the Shitake mushrooms, if using them. I doubled the sauce and added Aloha Soy Sauce just as removing from the pan.

Delish, easy and pretty. I doubled the sauce for additional flavor. Also covered the bok choy with foil after plating it to keep it warm while the scallops sear. Take note of the use of scallion tops -- they're an important addition not mentioned in the ingredients list.

Say I am not able to buy baby bok choy, so I have regular size. Any recommendations for cooking times or methods? Thanks.

This is a great weeknight recipe. I used minute miso and am not sure if that's what I was suppose to use. It also didn't say if you have to refrigerate after opening. Great recipe. I added shittake mushrooms in with the bok choy but I also cooked it longer than 3 minutes.

so dry packed is the secret to searing the perfect scallop! thanks for the tip, as i too have wasted many scallops not searing them to perfection. i also substituted the bok choy with this yummy sounding mushroom wrap recipe that i found. http://www.bettyconfidential.com/ar/ld/a/Sea-Scallops.html Thanks again for this great recipe

The flavors were good but I cooked the bok choy much longer than the recommended 3 minutes and it was still so hard on the bottom that it was inedible. Did I miss something?

the ultimate scallop recipe! so quick - so easy. Must use dry pack scallops. I did the research and now realize how much money I've wasted on scallops! Dry packed are fresh, no chemicals and no water added. A must when searing. Simply divine.

Excellent flavors but I used salmon instead (seared and roasted). Also added some shitake mushrooms.
