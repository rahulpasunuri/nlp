Horrible. I'd been looking forward to it, but it was a waste of time and a cup of Old Bay. The more I tasted it, the less I liked it. Bitter aftertaste, which also seemed to increase as I ate it. I love vegetables. I love seafood. I love shrimp cocktail. This was not good and "Poor Man's Shrimp Cocktail implies it's a cheaper substitute? Neither cauliflower, nor crab boil, nor cocktail sauce is cheap. Very disappointing. You want good shrimp cocktail? Buy some shrimp.

I'm allergic to shellfish; this is a great alternative to the beloved shrimp cocktail of my childhood.

A very clever and delicious twist on classic shrimp cocktail. I have made it twice so far (as written) and received rave reviews each time.

Way, way too salty. And I'm a salty food kind of guy. However, I think they will be very good once I figure out the right adjustment. I used a cup of Old Bay seasoning and 1/4 cup of kosher salt as directed.

This was TERRlBLE! Made my husband sick! I could see NO likeness to shrimp. Total flop!

I think these are good and would make them again. I took them to a party with both the coctail sauce and with a remoulade. Both sauces complement the cauliflower really well but this dish didn't get the rave reviews others commented on. Definitely do not "cook" over 5 minutes.

These are amazing! By themselves they are just a really spicy and tasty addition to a salad. But with the cocktail sauce, they really do taste like shrimp cocktail. I developed a shrimp allergy about 10 years ago, and I can't tell you how many times I've craved shrimp cocktail. This really hits the spot!

This turned out great. I took it to a Superbowl party, and even the cauliflower haters liked it. I made white remoulade sauce (mayo, capers, onion, anchovy, lemon, dill pickle) and people liked it better than the cocktail sauce. Fun, new recipe!

Just made this as an hors d'oeuvre for a small dinner party and it will be at the top of my go-to list. Very easy and can be prepared in advance. I halved the recipe for less people and made a simple horseradish cocktail sauce for dipping. Only change I would make is the amount of time cauliflower is in water. I left it in 5 minutes but will take it out sooner next time for a crunchier texture.
