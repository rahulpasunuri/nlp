Wonderfully moist and buttery, this cornbread was the perfect way to dispose of my sweet potatoes deliciously. I had a bit of trouble picking out the flavor of the yams when I was tasting it, though. This might have been due in part to the fact that I didnt have quite 1 cup of mashed. Also, I didnt read the recipe very carefully, so I neglected to put in the ginger. Main suggestion is to reduce the sugar to about a ¼ cup or 3 tablespoonsespecially if your yams are sweet, which they usually are. To try to speed up the cooking process, I only put enough batter in the pan to come up to about 2 inches thickness, putting the rest in greased, oven-safe bowls to bake. This meant that the 9x9 pan only took about 30 minutes to bake (it might actually be a little overdone).

The last two reviewers mustg be doing something majorly werong when making this recipe. I have been making this cornbread since Christmas of 2003. I make it for holidays; when I make Chili or stews; and is my go to recipe for corn bread. Both friends and family have commented at how moist and great tasting this recipe is. Just follow the recipe and you cannot go wrong.

Really disappointed with this recipe. Followed it exactly, and it turned out incredibly heavy and dry.

These are good, but I'm not sure I'd make them again -- and I LOVE corn bread. I made them into muffins (about 2 C. of sweet potatoes yielded 24 muffins), but they were kind of dense, kind of bland. If you use 2 C. of potatoes, use 2 tsp. salt for a bit more flavor. That said, next time I'll use a different recipe or (as my husband suggested) a box of Jiffy cornbread mix.

So, Nannance from Hawaii, I'm not clear. You didn't increase the potato amount to 2c?

I forgot to say I didn't increase the potato amount to 2c and it is light and fluffy.

Just took this out of the oven! I used Okinawan sweet potatoes instead of reg. I also used buckwheat flour instead of reg. I also used fresh ginger. I used the buckwheat flour to make these gluten free and let me just say, you would never know that they are GF. Great recipe, I hope more people try this.

Tasty, a nice level of sweetness. Still not as tender as I would like in the ideal gingerbread. The search continues.

Great recipe...Everyone loved it. I used 2 cups of sweet potatoes and baked them in the oven which I feel brings more flavor out of the potato rather that microwaving or boiling. I also added 3 jalapeno peppers finely minced to the mixture for color and flavor. A go to item to serve with chili!

Very tasty. I added raisins, cinnamon and turned them into breakfast muffins.

Amazing recipe! We used 2 cups sweet potatoes, and boiled them. Other than that, followed the recipe to a T and it is delicious! Very moist and faintly sweet, like a richer version of traditional cornbread. Will definitely make again!

I got the last of the muffins out of the freezer last night and they were still moist and flavorful after 1.5 months. I just warmed them in the microwave. I had given this 3 forks before, but I'm changing my review to 4 forks. These are delicious and freeze well - great to have on hand for a soup and salad dinner.

I followed others' suggestions and upped the sweet potatoes to 2 cups for the extra nutrition (baked in oven for extra flavor) and doubled the ginger to 1/2 tsp. Also, I made them in muffin tins. It made 12 lg and 12 med. I cooked the large muffins for 25 min and the med muffins for 20 min. Turned out very moist and flavorful and great with split pea soup for dinner!

very good, although I found it hard to blend the sweet potato without the help of a blender. I substituted brown for white sugar which seemed to compliment the sweet potato better.

Yummy. A little dry, but I don't mind as a soup accompaniment. I doubled the sweet potato, and substituted apple sauce plus 1 tablespoon olive oil for the butter. Decreased the sugar to about 1/3 cup.

Moist and tasty - I made this into muffins as well. My husband & my toddler just love them. I increased the sweet potatoes to 2 cups, but otherwise kept all other ingredients the same - came out great.

A nice way to use up leftover baked sweet potatoes, but it is a large recipe. I made it into muffins, which were done in 20 minutes. Now I have 2 dozen muffins, and I've frozen most for a quick breakfast.

This recipe got raves here. Made Red Beans & Rice for a Mardi Gras crowd, and served this instead of reg. corn bread. Didn't tell anyone about the sw.potato addition though. Lots of puzzled, but very pleased, looks. Many compliments & queries as to my "secret ingredient." I did BAKE the sweet potatoes instead of microwave them, and I think that adds a bit more of the flavor others were complaining was missing. Use small, skinny potatoes if you want to save time, as they cook faster (I used my DeLonghi toaster/convection oven). A big hit, and will make again for tomorrow, the first post-Katrina Fat Tuesday!!

Good, the people I had over really liked it. I added probably double the amount of sweet potatoes, and you still couldn't really taste them. The ginger flavour doesn't come through either. It tastes like normal corn bread, only it's healthier.

Rating: 3
Very, very yummy! Substituted 1 cup plain yogurt & 1/2 cup OJ for the buttermilk plus added some cinnamon. The batter was so good it almost didn't make it into the pan and boy did the house smell good while it was baking. Very good with molasses for breakfast. Now only if I convince hubby to try it and not get grossed out because of the sweet potatoe in it, if not MORE FOR ME - YEAH!!!!

Though this tasted ok, I think there are better cornbread recipies out there. I was disappointed that the sweet potato flavor didn't really come through, and I found the bread a bit dry. I also had to use a larger pan. There is no way it would fit in a 9x9.

This is great, easy corn bread (I didn't make the stuffing that this recipe goes with -- just the bread). It turns out very moist, but not mushy, and just sweet enough. I tripled the amount of ground ginger, and it wasn't overpowering at all. It held up well with the chili I made (Spicy Two-Bean Vegetarian Chili from this site) and looks gorgeous straight out of the oven. If you bake it in a nice dish, it looks great on the table. It's also very easy to make. I'll definitely make this again.

Great cornbread!! I found that one large sweet potato was a perfect amount...that w/ stone ground cornmeal made for the best cornbread I have ever had.

My first try at corn bread, and I'm glad I chose this recipe. Easy to make (I had to use a hand mixer instead of a food processor - no problem), looks perfect and wonderful not-too-sweet taste. Served this with Thanksgiving dinner this year and the only complaint was I hadn't made more.

A wonderfully moist cornbread!!! The sweet potato also added a nice color. I even altered the recipe to accommodate my husband's weight loss plan; used 2 eggs and 3 whites, decreased butter to 1/4 cup - and it was still good! I did add a scant bit more sweet potato to compensate for the lesser amount of butter. Will defintely make again -- must be even better w/double the butter and eggs!

excellent. i didn't find it extra moist as it said the sweet potato would make it, but it was still very good.

YUM! The sweet potato and ginger flavors are indeed subtle, and I might want to up those in the future, but for tonights soup, this is perfect. I didn't use the processor, I melted the butter in the oven, in my Emile Henry deep dish pie plate, poured the butter into the dry ingredients with the wet and then poured into the dish. Perfect amount for pie dish. The hot butter made a wonderful crisp around the edges, and it's pretty to serve from as well.

I made this recipe as muffins as a variation; using brown sugar instead of regular and adding a little more ginger. Also, with the leftover yams I mashed and added sugar and used it as filling in each muffin. I served it w/gumbo and everyone truly enjoyed it. It was a delightful treat.

I served this at a casual dinner party with chili and it definitely was a hit. It was moist and very dense. Probably one of the best cornbread recipes I have seen.

I'm still searching for a recipe for the kind of cornbread that I like. It's not very traditional, but I enjoy a more cake-like cornbread. I did really enjoy the flavor of this one, but it's still a little too course and dense for me, though. All of my guests really loved it, so I guess I'm just strange that way!

Wonderful for a spicy soup and cornbread meal. Very moist and everyone raved. I fit it into a 9 x 9 x 2 cake pan and it fit ... barely.

I put this recipe at the top of my pile of corn bread recipes. My family gobbled it up fast! It came out so moist and dense unlike any other corn bread I've made. Thumbs up!

The sweet potato and ginger flavors were only subtly evident, and mine was actually a little dry despite the other reviewers comments about the moistness of the recipe. Maybe it was because I baked it in a 11x17x2 inch dish for about 30 minutes. I don't see how it could possibly have fit into a 9x9 pan. Its not bad corn bread, its just that I expected so much more.

I would've given this dish four forks, except for the fact that the sweet potato corn bread didn't taste like sweet potatoes at all! Maybe the sweet potatoes is just there to add sweetness and moisture? Overall though, this was a very yummy corn bread and my husband loved it! PS: I added a few chopped up jalapenos and a can of creamed corn.

The best cornbread recipe I have found. It's moist and has a nice sweet taste. I have made it several times and the only tweeking I have made was to use a dark brown sugar instead of regular sugar.

Since I cannot tolerate wheat flour, I substituted rice flour and it made a light and moist bread suitable for people with wheat allergies. I also used brown sugar instead of white. I used leftover sweet potatoes and was very happy with the outcome. I used a 10" square baking pan as I don't think it would have fit into a smaller one. I will definitely make this again.

While this dish was quite tasty, parts of my bread keep turning green after cooling. Upon closer inspection, I believe it is some of the sweet potato bits that turn green-even those slices I froze have turned green in some places. Can anyone help me out here? What am I doing wrong?

Great yummy moist and dense cornbread. The molasses can be a little overpowering if you add it so watch out. Otherwise it's a very mild flavor.

I served this with ham for our Easter dinner. My kids loved it even after they found out there were sweet potatoes in it. It is very dense bread. We used lots of honey. I will be making this again.

Good flavor and moist. I didn't have a 9" x 9" pan, so I used an 8" square pan and a 10" pie plate, and only baked 20-25 minutes. I'll try adding some molasses the next time to make it a little sweeter.

This corn bread is ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!!! I doubled the entire recipe and used a deep dish 13x9 Stoneware baking pan (Pampered Chef). I added to this doubled recipe 1/3 cup Mild Molasses and reduced the butter milk by about 1/4 cup. This added a magnificant flavor and a touch more sweetness!!! After 45 minutes at 375 degrees I reduced the temp down to 350 for the addition of 12 more minutes of bake time, cover loosely with foil if starts to darken too much. A co-worker of mine wanted the exact way I made it so she could prepare it for her family. Barb, I hope they enjoy this too! It has been great working with you.

Made this for the stuffing recipe but found that I nibbled on it all day. It is very flavorful. I added more sweet potatoe so it was also very moist. Will make again and not use for stuffing.

This is it, I've finally found my cornbread. The sweet potato adds a heavier consistency, and a sweetness that makes this bread standout. A keeper.

This bread was super dry. Perhaps the suggestion to bake it for 45 minutes is too long or maybe I would increase the amount of either buttermilk or sweet potato. Doubt I'll bother with this recipe again.
