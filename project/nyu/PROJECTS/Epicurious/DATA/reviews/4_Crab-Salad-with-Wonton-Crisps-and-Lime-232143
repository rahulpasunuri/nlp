This is a delicious and simple dish. I served it as a first course at Christmas dinner and everyone loved it. I followed the recipe but added a bit more lime juice. The wonton crisps are a nice addition. I also sliced some avocado, drizzled it with olive oil, and served it on top of the crab salad. The avocado was a great add.

This recipe is quick and lovely for a warm summer's day. I adjusted the ingredients based on previous reviewers and found that, indeed, more lime and the addition of cilantro made the flavor of the crab jump out. Rather than use it as a dip like others, I used it as filling for half an avocado and the flavors melded perfectly.

This is a simple yet awsome dish to prepare. Living on the cajun riviera, fresh sweet crab mest is readily availiable. The lime juice and wontons add an unexpected demension to the overall flavor. 5 forks!!!!!

I didn't make the wontons - I served the salad with crackers and crudites. I added a bit more lime juice than called for as well as the dark green parts of the scallions. I also added cilantro. It was a great warm-weather salad. Light and fresh.

I used about 1.5 times the dressing, with an extra squeeze or two of lime. Minced some jalapeno and red onion, as I didn't have scallions. Could have added a little cilantro as well. The crab-lime combo is very good. Put little scoops on blue corn tortilla chips as hors d'oeuvres. Really light and good, and there wasn't a crumb leftover.

Deeee-licious!! I didn't serve the wontons but it didn't need it....just a little zinger of an appetizer to wake up the taste buds. Crab can be really expensive so make sure you guests will appreciate it!

I use this recipe in my catering business and it's a BIG hit. I bake the wontons in mini muffin pans and then put the salad in, top it with a salad shrimp..It's tasty AND pretty!

Have made this three times this summer and everyone loves it. Great for dieters, easy to make, a nice light and refreshing dish. I use the lime tortillas as someone else suggested, which play up the lime in the salad.

Made this to take to a friend's potluck party. I used baked pita chips instead of the wonton crisps, and I squeezed in a lot more lime juice than called for to get almost a ceviche flavor. It was a hit, and was one of the first dishes to be finished even though I got there late!

Wonderful salad - especially for people not so fond of heavy mayonnaise! I served it as part of a pre-wedding brunch in little triangles of frozen puff pastry (baked, of course). These disappeared quickly!

Great light dipping salad that is upscale. Use Amy's pita crisps from costco for a quick dipper. I have added things like cilanto, jalapenos,and even mango to the mix.

This dish was OK, but not amazing, for the cost of the crab, and the hassle of frying the wonton crisps. Nonetheless, it was a light, refresshing appetizer, with simple flavors, and aside from the wonton frying part, easy to put together.

I'd make this again for sure. Nice healthy lunch. To lighten it up, I baked some wonton wrappers that I brushed with sesame oil and seasoned with salt and pepper.

This recipe was perfect for the beach during July 4th weekend. I made it the night before and served it with Tostito chips that had a hint of lime. Everyone loved it, gone in 5 minutes. I will make this again. It was so easy and would be perfect for a late night snack...

I made this over July 4th weekend. Everyone loved it!! This dish was perfect for a day at the beach. It was light and refreshing. I served it with "Tosito chips with a hint of lime". It was gone in 5 minutes. Next time I'll double the recipe.

I made this for an anniversary dinner party for 30 people. Did not do the wontons, due to time, so used tortilla chips with lime! Rave reviews from everyone! I served the salad with our appetizers during the cocktail hour in small, clear plastic cups with forks, chips stuck in side, and lime slice for garnish.

Made it for a brunch and it was a huge hit. If it wasn't for the wontons, it would be a very easy and quick recipe.

I tried it with flour tortillas rather than wonton, for a Mexican flair... MMMMMMm It was great.
