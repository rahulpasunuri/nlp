I have to vouch for my girlfriend a.k.a The Australian Pavlova Queen. She has been known to do many things extremely well single handed and making pavlovas is just one of her many talents. I was witness to the demise of her kitchen with a heavy layer of dark smoke under the articulated direction from the recipe. I would suggest a regroup with the chef and a minor amendment to the instructions. Thanks for your site. It's great to be able to get recipes and see users opinions.

I am experienced at cooking pavlova - its the Australian national dessert and I am an Aussie pavlova queen! I thought the oven temp looked too high and it certainly was - 275 burnt my pavlova in 25 minutes - never again! Not only that the pink peppercorn ingredient was not specific enough. I used dried and ground it up. I remade it using my own pavolva recipe and it worked and the pink peppercorn flavour was subtle, not too much. (And my boyfriend loved it!)

Fantastic dessert. I made this last night for a dinner party and everyone loved it. The pepper, strawberry & basil was such a unique and tasty combination. I finely ground the pepperscorns & made a basil chiffonade instead of the syrup. Love it!

The intensity of the basil syrup makes this pavlova unique.

I was skeptical about this recipe at first, but it came together perfectly for me. I took the advice of other people who commented and finely ground the peppercorns with a spice grinder, and I suggest that others who make this recipe do so, too. The only other change I made was not adding sugar to the strawberry coulis. I thought that the other parts of the dessert already had too much sweetness. The colors and flavors of all the parts combined were gorgeous, and made an elegant, upscale-looking dessert.

This tasted good, but the presentation with bright red (strawberries and coulis) and bright green syrup (basil) was less than appetizing. If you crush the peppercorns, you don't have any issues with texture and they add a wonderful kick. While this was fun to make and a nice unusual twist, I don't think we'll be making it again.

This was a disappointment. Pink Peppercorns were a gross textural distraction in the meringue. Like popcorn hulls Yuck. The basil syrup was awesome on the berries and whipped cream, though. Zero forks.

The meringue was good, the basil syrup was amazing. The pink peppercorns in the meringue were not a nice addition to the texture or flavor.

Oh so yummy! The basil syrup sounded odd to me, but it has a really nice flavour. Next time I will chop up the basil leaves before putting in the blender, as the leaves wound around the blade stem and I had to keep pulling them off. For the meringues, next time I will see if anchoring the parchment paper to the baking sheet with a small dot of meringue in each corner will keep the paper from sliding around while the meringue is being spread. I was having so much trouble that I ended up putting the meringue in an icing bag (without a tip) and piping it to fill the circles. This worked very well, and I was able to build up the edges higher to create a well in the centre to better hold the cream and strawberries. I made the meringues the day before and they had a great texture...crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. After I made the cream, I decided it didn't look like enough, so I used up my 2 cup carton of cream and a whole vanilla bean. This is a keeper!

A lot of work, but worth it. Sadly, the day I'd picked to make the pavlovas was also the first extremely humid Chicago summer day, so they didn't rise as I wanted them too, but still made tasty little meringue "cakes" that were great with all the fixin's. Great interaction of flavors. Tastes like fine dining.. great way to impress your guests!

This recipe was really great, and makes for a really nice dinner party dessert. I halved it and served 4, and there was still plenty. The basil syrup should not be skipped, it definitely adds to the layers of flavor in this dish.

This was fantastic. However, I used half creme fraiche & half whipped cream and took out the vanilla. Also, they needed to cook about 45-50 minutes longer than the recipe said (at least in my oven). I also added raspberries & kiwi to it. It was delicious and I would definitely make this again!

This dessert was amazing. I usually make chocolate desserts, but this one was a great change of pace. It was impressive looking and the flavors complemented one another beautifully.

I made this for a gourmet club dinner and everyone loved it. A very interesting blend of flavors. I will be making this again.
