Excellent recipe. Made adustments to fit my peronal taste, less onion more wine omitted pancetta and used extra bacon (hickory smoked) served with braised cabbage and bbq rubbed pork chops topped with crispy fried onions to garnish!

For New Year's Day, I tried this recipe. Used half the onions as suggested by other cooks but think that I would cut the recipe even more. Recommend about 3 cups of sliced onions. Love the flavor combinations. Served it with pork chops seasoned with thyme, salt, and pepper and roasted in apple cider and wine. My very picky husband loved the meal. Would definitely fix it again.

A wonderful dish! I changed quite a bit -- used short grain brown rice, all the onions, browned the pancetta with the red onion. Cooked, stirring constantly for an hour, gradually adding the 8 cups of stock. Then, after the first hour, added the other stuff - peas, etc. and cooked for another half hour, stirring constantly, and gradually adding another 8 cups simmering water. No butter at all. Threw in the bacon at the end, and shredded a little Parmesan on top of each bowl. Awesome! Don't omit the lemon juice!

Loved this dish and so did everyone at our New Year's eve dinner table. Being that we were mostly vegetarians we made a few very tasty substitutions: Veggie broth instead of Chicken broth, 2 Morningstar Farms Veggie Patties instead of pancetta, and Morningstar Farms Fake Bacon instead of bacon. Oh, half the amount of suggested butter and onions is plenty! Took a little while to make but very aromatic and enjoyable. Would surely make it again.

I made this for a New Year's Eve dinner and it was very tasty. I did take a few suggestions from the reviews and browned the pancetta first and cut the onions by about 60%. I did go ahead and use all of the butter, but I concur that it doesn't need it. It could probably be cut down to 2-3 tablespoons at the end at most. I did add Parmesan to it as well. Everyone at our dinner party loved it. It also keeps very well. I just had it for lunch two days later and the flavor is still fabulous if not even better.

I'm always looking for ways to serve black-eyed peas on New Year's Day -- the results are usually ho-hum but this was FABULOUS and will be the star of our 2nd Annual New Year's Lunch. I prepared it last year exactly as written using lemon thyme and served it with Kielbasa and braised pork chops; everyone ate until they were ready to burst. Will substitute a roast pork tenderloin this year for ease of preparation.

Easy to make this into a vegiatarian dish by omitting the bacons. If you need meat try it with boneless chicken. I used olive oil, yellow eyed peas, added fresh spinach and tomatoes at the end. I loved the lemon flavor and bumped it up a bit with a little cumin and fresh orgeno. I did used less onion and made once with out the rice, just as a bean dish. Each time was very yummy.

9 onions to 2.5 Cups of rice was just too much onion. Somehow the lack of cheese prevented me for enjoying it as a risotto.

It's New Year's Day on the West Coast. But you gotta have black eyed peas, ham, kale and wave your dollar bills from the front porch if you want a grand New Year. But I don't wanna cook a ham, so off I go to Epicurious to see what they might have and Hoppin John comes Hoppin along. RARELY have I ever tasted anything so delicious. Never made risotto before (don't even like the idea of mushy gush) but THIS -ohmygawd. My casual dinner guests liked it so much I was left with one helping leftover for the next day. Keeper? Nah, this should be enshrined!

Fantastic! Takes a little while, but not overly labor-intensive, and makes a TON of food. I have made this a number of times, cutting the butter by almost half and substituting 16 oz. smoked (pre-cooked, such as Eckrich, Hillshire Farm, etc.) turkey sausage for the pancetta. Obviously a pretty big substitution! But it makes for a hearty meal. Serves at least 4-6 people. Delicious!

This recipe has great taste, but a lot of steps. I substituted black beans for the black-eyed peas, but will use them next time if I have them. I will definitely brown the pancetta next time, as it will break down the fat and impart another layer of flavor in a way that just adding it raw near the end didn't. I didn't have fresh herbs on hand, so I added a 1/2 tsp. of dried thyme. Will also try it with the fresh herbs next time.

Delicious! Followed the recipe to the letter. It is excellent without changes or additions. My guests and I loved this dish.

This had all the potential of being a fabulous dish. Unfortunately, for me, the salty-ness of the pancetta and bacon seemed to clash horribly with the chicken stock. I'll admit I ended up using broth, which didn't help, but they just didn't seem to mesh well. I might suggest using a beef broth rather than chicken, with red wine, and I might think to add something like a drop of tomato paste as well, or a diced tomato or two....If you make it as per the recipe exactly, I'd say skip the thyme. Doesn't suit the bacon all that well to my taste. But definately a dish worth playing with! Good luck! Adjust as you will!

Very, very tasty and less labor-intensive to make than usual risotto. To cut the fat a bit, I used only half as much butter in the final addition before serving.

I hate to rate it four becasue four should be something exceptional. While this was very, very good and beyond expectation it's not TA DA! in presentation. What made it for me was the ease in prep and that it held well since I took it to a dinner party where they were grilling Kobe beef and I was assigned the starch. I added the butter and the last of the liquid at the party. The whole fear of the rice not becoming tender was never realized as it continued to cook covered in the back of my car. Anyway, I thought a Hoppin John was more appropriate to an outside end of summer soiree (what could be more casual, come on in and sit a spell than a Hoppin' John) and that it was rissoto would be worthy of the steaks. It absolutely was. I probably used a little more wine than was called for but I needed it to bring it to its fist boil. I used navy/northern beans (or white beans as I don't care for black-eye peas) and it we delightful just the same. I too was skeptical of the lemon juice but it really finishes it with a nice bright flavor. The serving for eight is more than enough for a side dish for 14. Everyone went back for seconds and some took a little home. It was the right dish at the right time that earns it the four fork rating. And, in all fairness, I suppose that should be all that matter. I will make it again, not immediately but again. It's a keeper.

The combination of the sweet caramelized onions, salty bacon, and spicy red pepper flakes lends to a very complex and tasty dish. Do not skip any steps; however, I used reduced-fat butter and did not add any butter in the end. I otherwise followed the recipe as written, and it was del-ish.

This dish is absolutely FANTASTIC--one of the best I have found on this site, after several years of frequenting Epicurious.com. I almost didn't add the lemon juice--the risotto already tasted great w/o it and I didn't know what the lemon could add to it--but once the lemon was added, this dish went 5 steps beyond great. Our New Year's Resolution is to make this dish many many times this year!

I just made this for the first time, along with the recommended Verbena Brined Pork Chops, and got rave reviews from my guests. The number of ingredients and chopping required some time, but a lot can be done ahead of time, making it a manageable dinner party dish. I cut down the amount of butter at the end and used only a small amount of bacon fat (added some olive oil) to cook the onions. The recipes for the risotto and pork chops are now in my "will make many times again" recipe notebook.

We have historically only served black eyed peas due to tradition (rather than taste) on new years but this recipe was so good that we would make it as a side dish any time throughout the year. It was fabulous and worth all of the effort!

Made this for the first time for New Year's Day lunch. It was a lot of work, but the taste was fabulous. I used proscuitto and I thought it worked better with the recipe. Definitely will make this every year from now on!

This was wonderful! A must try! My husband wants to have it every new year. I used procutto instead of pancetta, an extra can of black eye peas, and only half of the butter at the end. I served it with pork roast. Wonderful blend of flavors and texture.

I found this underwhelming, especially for a dish with this much butter and bacon. It doesn't take much to create a risotto with less fat and more flavor.

WOW! First time making risotto and it was wonderful. This is definitely a keeper.

I left out the carmelized onions and substituted prosciutto for the pancetta. It was a great blend of flavors. My family loved it and agreed that it is a dish to add to the favorites collection!

I made this dish as our Sunday dinner and it totally worked! All of the flavors dance together in the perfect harmony. Don't let the 1 and 25 minute prep time throw you off, because it is totally worth it. Key things to remember: measure and organize ingredients in advance and really review the recipe in advance because often you are asked to use only half of something at that moment.

Delicious! This recipe really works and is much less labor intensive than other risotto recipes. One suggestion: rather than discarding the bacon used for carmelizing the onions, toss it into the risotto towards the end of preparation. Ain't no such thing as too much bacon.

This will be on the menu for a New Years good luck dish!
