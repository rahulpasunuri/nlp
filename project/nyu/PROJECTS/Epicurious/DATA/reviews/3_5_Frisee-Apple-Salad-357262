Finally made the salad. It's hard to master. I would use less shallots, less radishes, and more apples. My salad came out a little too bitter so I put a tablespoon of OJ for sweet fruitiness.

Haven't tried this recipe but noticed that "A Cook from Atlanta" thought the radishes too strong. To reduce mustardy-ness of the radish, you can slice them the night before, sprinkle with lemon juice and a little bit of salt & sugar if you so desire. You may or may not want to drain the liquid before using in the salad. It may then be good to use a little less lemon in the dressing.

A different, excellent salad. Those pink apples are great. Added a bit of walnut oil, a little less shallot.

This was easy and delicious. I made it last weekend as directed except I couldn't get frisee and used mesculin instead. I'm making it again tomorrow night!

Not a success. The combo of radish and scallion (too much of both, we felt) really gave this a harsh flavor. Liked the apple though.
