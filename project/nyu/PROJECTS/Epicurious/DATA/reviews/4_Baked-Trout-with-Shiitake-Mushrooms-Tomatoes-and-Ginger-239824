Did not like it. Would rather just cook with just butter and lemon, or make up my own recipe, than do this again.

Very, very good.

Too many flavors in the topping overwhelmed the delicate taste of the trout. Fresh trout fried in oil/butter with a squeeze of lemon is better.

One of the best recipes I've made from the site. I used trout filets, cherry tomatoes and toasted sesame oil and otherwise followed the recipe exactly. (Except for sprinkling the cilantro after the fish was cooked.) Makes more like 3-4 servings and reheats well if you do it gently. I served this with cucumber salad and brown rice. I will make this often.

We put fresh asparagus right on the sheet along with the fish and drizzle soy sauce and sesame oil over all. With a little orzo, this is a delicious, easy, healthy spring dinner.

What an attractive, healthy and delicious dish! I made it as written except used a combination of exotic mushrooms. Doubled it for 4 people and had a small piece left over. Know I will make again and again.

Great recipe, super easy and fast, perfect for a weeknight dinner. I used olive oil instead of sesame oil, turned out great. Will definitely make again!

Quick and easy. It's very fresh tasting because of the veggies and ginger. I always substitute tilapia because good, fresh trout can be difficult to find.

It's really good. The mix of all the flavors makes it absolutly delicious

I wouldn't call this exceptional, but it is delicious and satisfying. It's simple enough for a weeknight, or for a novice cook to come across as highly skilled. My teenagers can put this together without any help from me. It's also special enough for company, and easy to multiply for a crowd without being any more time- consuming. I cooked 12 trout for my husband's birthday celebration, and enjoyed the party with our friends vs. spending the whole evening in the kitchen. Don't bake the cilantro in the oven, though. Just sprinkle it on fresh right before serving.

REALLY fabulous recipe. I baked for 15 minutes and I sprinkled the chopped cilantro over the fish in the last 5 minutes. Super easy and super healthy!

I LUV this dish and have made it on several occasions. It's flavorful and very healthy. One note, according to my calculations, the calorie count in the dietary info is off by about 100 calories, and should be more like 331, so chow down!

This is an exceptional dish that is full of flavor and is healthy at the same time. I made it 3 times already with 2 different kinds of fish, both with fantastic results! Used locally available fresh mushrooms such as shimeji, shiitake and white button for contrast in flavor and texture. Used a Chinese soy sauce for seafood but also tried it with a light soy sauce with good results. Sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds and drops of sesame oil for fragance before serving. Whisked together some soy sauce, a little sesame oil and a pinch of sesame seeds and served on the side as dipping sauce.

Absolutely delicious, and very easy. This one is a keeper

Very good recipe. I added a little crushed red pepper to the tomato and mushroom mixture and chopped some cilantro into the mixture as well. The cilantro burnt a little on top and I ended up removing it before serving. I'm happy I decided to put some in the mixture instead of depending on the sprigs on top.

My sister had a brook trout and we were wondering what to do with it, so I pulled up this recipe from the site. It was delicious, and super easy! The flavors were perfect together. The ginger flavor is strong though, so you might want to tone that down if you don't prefer that flavor very much. I'd make it again with a nice, firm white fish like halibut or cod, would seem to lend itself better to this recipe - the flavors overpowered the trout. Excellent though, will make many times over!

This recipe could hardly be easier, healthier or tastier! One of the best recipes we've had from epicurious in a while. We made it with asparagus baked in the same pan as the fish and couscous.

this was great, quick, and easy - you have to love ginger since it's a prominent flavor, but it's nicely balanced with the other ingredients and would be easy enough to exclude if you really didn't want it. i made this with quinoa with corn & mint and it was a delicious & healthy meal :)

Great, quick, no-hassle recipe. I used halibut, and the ginger really infused the fish. Will make again.

A very good, fast and easy Tuesday night meal! Wonderful flavors and colors. Add some asparagus for a built-in side. I generally use more mushrooms, but otherwise it's perfect!

i love this! stuck to the recipe except i mixed the cilantro in with the other veggies and it only takes 10 minutes to cook. 20 minutes would kill it. have made it twice all ready.

This recipe is exceptional. Because it is so simple it can take you anywhere you want to go. Improvise while maintaining the tomato mixture.

I thought this was terrific and so did my girls. I didn't have shitake mushrooms so I omitted them. I also used regular onions and grape tomatoes. The trout was moist and the cilantro and ginger added great taste! This is a keeper and I'm sending it to all my friends! Judy Nichols

I liked this a lot. I did use trout which ended up being chock- full of bones. I also have a pretty old oven which overcooked and dried out the topping as the fish cooked to perfection. Even so, I felt like the tomatoes and ginger called for a thicker, jucier piece of fish. I'll try it with halibut next time, and maybe some brown rice since there won't be as much surface area on the fish to accomodate the topping.

A very fresh and straightforward trout recipe. Definitely would make again and I have no suggestions for how to improve - make it as is.
