Not quite Greek

The reason why I loved this recipe is precisely because it offered a fun, non-traditional way of looking at tarama. Smoked salmon is an incredibly popular item and this dip makes very good use of it. I had to adjust the quantities not because I thought they were wrong but to adjust them more to what I wanted as a result. It is a great idea, just make your own interpretation.

Alright, I have not made this recipe and I would not even try it. Any true Greek would tell you that tarama is never made with milk. The bread is soaked in water. Tarama is traditionally eaten during Lent, because it is a dish that does not have any dairy products in it. This person should know better!
