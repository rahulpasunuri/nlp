Delicious! A warming winter soup.

Easy, quick recipe. Made as directed. I thought the flour might make the soup too thick, but it was perfect. I did puree about 1/2 of the potatoes which made for a creamy broth. Wonderful for a cold evening by the fire. I will definitely add this to my collection of winter soups.

I'm not one to change the recipes before I try them, but I took the previous reviewers' advice and omitted the flour. I used extra Yukon Gold potatoes and sharp cheddar instead of gruyere, and I blended the entire pot of soup with a hand held blender, leaving plenty of potato still cubed. Really worked out very nicely. Good hearty soup.

This is an easy, quick recipe, ideal for a winter lunch, and a good 'template' for other potato soups. Made with sharp cheddar instead of gruyere and a hefty splash of dark beer, this is standard stick-to-your ribs pub fare. I did omit the flour as I'm not partial to the glutinous texture that would have been contributed by so much flour, and finished the soup with just a dab of heavy cream, which I found smoothed the 'edges' and rounded out the flavors nicely.

I have made this soup many times, and it is one of my favorites. I use yukon gold potatoes and I puree all of the soup with my hand blender. The gruyere cheese complements the other flavors in the soup well.

I put all the sou[ in the food proecessor in batches b/c I didn't like the consistency of it otherwise. It is now very thick and creamy. I like it but next time I will not use all the flour so it is a little less thick.

This soup was a class above any potato soup, I've ever had. I did you yellow & white potatoe's as, that is what I had on hand. YUM!!!

This soup has become a favorite of my family for holiday meals. I sauteed leeks, increased the amount of the bacon and used a combination of the russet and yukon gold potatoes. Awesome as well as a beautiful addition to a special meal.

I was not thrilled with this recipe. It was rather bland, I will not make it again.

This was an easy and fantastic recipe. I didn't read the reviews prior to making this soup, but I also used about a cup and a half of leeks, primarily because I was low on onions. Also, I cooked the bacon separate and used the food processor to chop. I added the bacon at the end with a little cream to ade a velvety texture. My taste tester (mom) thought it was the greatest. This will become a New England winter special in my house.

I added leeks also as recommended. I did not use flour...just added a few extra potatoes to thicken. Very good.

This soup was delicious. The gruyere and sherry added a great flavor combination. I used russets because that's all I had, but definitely will use yellow-flesh potatoes next time for more consistency and taste. A keeper!

Looked for great things but was disappointed. Actually added extra Gruyere. Added a leek as well. Family liked it moderately. Have so many other soups to try - including similar ones that I probably will not make it again

I've made this recipe many, many times and it's always excellent. Some leeks are a good addition, as is a dash of cayenne pepper. Try adding some of the potatoes along with the broth in the blender for a thicker soup.

Perfect cold weather soup the only change I made was to double the recipe, and added a 1/2 cup of light cream, this recipe to will be a keeper in my file.

My family thought this was a perfect combination of flavours. I thought that it was a perfect soup for a cold evening and it didn't take long to prepare. I did mash most of the potatoes before serving for my daughters sake and we all had at least two helpings.
