These were fun to make and tasty to eat. I had to use dark beer (Guinness) because I couldn't find any light but they were fine. I sifted a ton of powdered sugar on them so they reminded me of funnel cakes. Next time the only thing I'll do differently is instead of making apple slices I'll make rounds (circles with holes in the middle from the core). I expect those might present a bit more nicely than slices!

Nice, straightforward recipe. I wanted a little more dimension so I made a few adjustments: 1. Made sure to use a good beer, is to personal taste but would recommend either a summer or winter seasonal as the flavors will typically complement the apple nicely. 2. wanted a little brightness so added 3/4 tsp lemon zest 3. wanted a little aromatic so added 3/4 tsp orange zest - this was excellent but may have been a little heavyhanded 4. added 1/2 tsp cinnamon. This was not enough and i'd increase in future. nonetheless, rave reviews. cmc

Very very nice. I made this one Sunday night with no beer on hand, so I used Jones Cream Soda, and it was surprisingly excellent. A couple other variations: added 1/4 t cinnamon to batter, and dust with granulated sugar rather than powdered.

This was a pretty easy recipe. Our family and guests enjoyed them dusted in cinnamon sugar. Thanks for the idea!

Very easy and very good. We fried the apples in a lot less oil than it called for. We will be making this quick dessert again real soon.

This is a simple, basic recipie for apple fritters. I use a lot less oil and just shallow fry them. Also, instead of dusting with confectioner's sugar, I toss the hot fritters in a mixture of granulated sugar and cinnanom; then serve them warm with vanilla ice-cream.

I thought that they were very good. We liked them better cold. It took a while to fry them.
