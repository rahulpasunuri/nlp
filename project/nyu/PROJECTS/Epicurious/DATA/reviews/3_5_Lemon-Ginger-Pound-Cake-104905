after reading other reviews I made these as cupcakes using my silicone pan. had enough for 6 and also filled a very small 7 inch pie pan. it DOES rise a bit so now I get to clean the oven. also did the whole thing in the food processor using pulse and that worked out fine. I was super generous with the pam spray and it still stuck to the pan so next time need to flour too or try chlling it as recommended. I went heavy on the ginger and rind and its spicy and fresh. will be great tonight with blueberries and whipped cream.

Delicious! Definitely double the recipe and sub half and half for the milk!

Rating: 4
I doubled the recipe for a 9x5 loaf pan since this calls for a very small bundt pan. The first attempt was very good but not exactly what I consider pound cake, plus the slices fell apart. On the second run i took the milk out totally & voila! perfect cake, it sliced beautifully and was still moist.

I just made these and they turned out wonderful. I used some crystallized organic cubed ginger that was sugared and used a food processor to get them chopped finely to mix with the sugar. I made them as mini bundt cakes and the recipe made about 5 (i filled the sixth mold with water as not to burn). I baked for 20 minutes and they were perfect. I heavily buttered the tin with a pasty brush then chilled for about a half hour then dusted with flour. They popped right out no problem. I was so excited at how they turned out, I'm making my husband go get more ingredients so I can make another batch tonight!

Well, I made last week for a dinner party. Perhaps it was a little less in the pan than I had expected but the result was good. I used young ginger and perhaps should have used old ginger or increased the amount as it had very little ginger flavour. It was wonderfully lemony however and was much appreciated by my guests, one of whom took the printed copy of the recipe home to try it also.

There is a significant gap between the picture of this cake and the reality. Think about it. Is it really possible to get a cake that large with the quantity of ingredients listed? I made the cake for Easter 08. New ginger and new b. soda. Had I used the recommended bundt pan, the batter would barely have covered the bottom. As it was, the batter covered maybe 1.5" of a 5X9 glass loaf pan. Finished product (40 minutes in oven way too long - no way an hour!) did not brown on top and was dry as a bone. Despite the fact that I put more ginger in the recipe than called for and added candied ginger to the glaze, no one was able to taste the ginger. The one good thing I can say about it was that the lemon flavor was very good.

I also followed the pan prep directions to the letter, and still had some sticking trouble. The cake also just did not rise at all. Decent enough flavor, but too many problems.

I followed the pan preparation instructions to the letter so didn't have any problems with the cake sticking to the pan--slipped out beautifully. Everyone liked the cake, but I was disappointed that it didn't rise much at all. I don't think it fell; it just didn't rise. I'm not sure how to remedy that when I try again.

I made this as 6 mini-bundt cakes and used the times another reviewer listed. These came out very nicely, and were well-received by my guests. The ginger flavor was quite strong, so you have to be ready for it, but the texture was perfect.

I wouldn't call this cake moist - wet (and leaden) would be more like it, and that was after over an hour in the oven and a tester coming out clean. Waste of perfectly good lemon and ginger. My husband did like it, but he loves underbaked and soggy cakes....

Followed the directions exactly. Cake was too sweet and the texture was terrible. Not even close to a pound cake.

Nice, light, refreshing flavours. Grated all the fresh ginger I had and came up with only 1 1/2 tbsp, but ginger flavour still came through very nicely. No problem turning out of well greased and floured loaf pan. Perfect for a sunny afternoon.

This cake was the most perfect cake I ever baked in my short culinary life. But there were a little substituitions & additions, considering my resources. I substituted fresh ginger with ginger paste; lemon juice with lime juice; 1/2 cup butter with 1/3 cup of sunflower oil; and lemon jest with 1 tbsp of lime jest. I also added 2 tbsp of plain youghurt & presented the cake with a clear glaze of orange marmalade to highlight the pale-golden hue. I baked the batter in a loaf pan for 1hr 15min & it didn't stick as per the instructions. It was a success with my sugar-conscious, diabetic-phobic Ma, Aunties & Grandparents, along with my chocoholic sister & cousins- yes it managed to fed plenty of people, despite its small size.

Rating: 3
Great flavor, but it does stick to the pan! I tend to double the lemon and ginger, as I prefer a stronger flavor. Also, the recipe can be doubled easily for larger bundt pans. To keep it moist I use skim or 1% milk, but add a tablespoon of plain yogurt. Also, if you grate the ginger with a micro-planer you will have perfect consistency w/out a processor.

Nice cake! Very flavorful! I used a GENEROUSLY greased bundt pan that I floured, then put in the freezer as asked in the recipe. I did not have any trouble unmolding the cake. It came out very nicely. I added more sugar to the glaze since I found it too watery.

Turned out GREAT! Used it for an Easter brunch dessert. I made it in mini-bundt pan--6 perfect sized cakes that baked for about 20-25 mins. Had a bit of trouble getting them out of the pan. Guests loved it. Ginger was a nice twist. I took the advice of others and just creamed the lemon zest in with the butter and sugar and didn't bother with the food processor.

This was a big hit at my dinner party. I doubled the recipe and baked it in a loaf pan and it came out great. I served it with some sauted plums and a bit of whipped cream. The lemon and ginger seemed just right -- really prominent flavors without being overpowering. I highly recommend it.

This cake tasted great and presents very nicely. I doubled the recipe, using a 10 cup bundt, which I coated with oil and flour. The cake popped right out with only some minor scars that the icing covered. I mixed the sugar and ginger using an attachment I got with my handheld blender, which is easier to use and clean than a food processor. The rest of the ingredients I just threw together without regard to the elaborate mixing called for in the recipe and it came out great.

After two tries at this cake, I ended up adding extra ginger - the taste just didn't come through with the quantities recommended. It is also definitely better after a couple of days sitting well-wrapped in the fridge - really lets the flavors develop.

Rating: 3
I'm a pretty experienced baker and am embarrassed to say that this is the first time I've ever used fresh ginger. It gives quite a different flavor than ground, not surprisingly fresher, snappier. This cake is nothing like a gingerbread flavor which uses all the brown and beige spices, the lemon perfectly balances the ginger so that it's just very freshly flavorful (and I am not the world's biggest ginger fan). I used a loaf pan, and because of concerns with getting it out of the pan, I Pam-ed the pan, then lined the bottom and halfway up with parchment, then Pam-ed and lightly floured. Came out easily. I also added a 1/4 tsp of lemon oil because for me there's no such thing as too lemony. I also skipped the step of putting the ginger and sugar in the food processor together. I finely grated the ginger, mixed in the sugar with a fork and it was fine. This cake is very very moist and so I refigerated overnight, as I often do, to firm it. I cut it with a serrated knife. With fruit and perhaps a coulis or whipped cream, this is a light-tasting dessert after perhaps a heavy or complex meal. And it goes very well with a cup of tea or cocoa.

I had some people over for homemade Thai food and was looking for a dessert that would go well. This was perfect and people really enjoyed it. The flavors a quite strong so you must like lemon and ginger. I have a large bundt pan and took the suggestions to double the recipe. I could have doubled it again... although if you do this you will be zesting A LOT of lemons! I took other people's advice and used Pam and flour. It came out of the pan perfectly. Serve it with homemade whipped cream and berries. It complements the flavors of the cake perfectly!

I made this because one of my favorite other recipes (Lemon Almond Buttermilk Loaf) requires buttermilk and I didn't have any around. So I really didn't expect much...plus, I didn't have a mini-food processor to do the ginger sugar thing, so I didn't exactly follow the directions or have high expectations. But this turned out really great! Perfect amount of lemon-ginger flavor, the cake was fluffy and it was demolished by a family of four in less than 30 minutes! I made this last night and have been requested to double the batch and make it again tonight. We spooned some strawberry-rhubarb sauce over a slice of cake and topped it with fresh whipped cream. p.s. if you feel like omitting the ginger sugar step, here's what I did: I just grated the ginger and lemon and threw them both into the sugar/butter/eggs combination as I was whipping it. I then added the dry flour mixture to the wet, and then added the milk, then lemon juice. Didn't seem to impact the tastiness at all.

This is an incredibly lemony, gingery cake. I made it for a party and everyone raved! Even my husband, who usually goes for chocolate desserts, loved it and asked me to make it again. We served it with whipped cream and berries, which was perfect.

I made this cake over the weekend. It was little tedious with the ginger and lemon bit and it seemed like an awful ot of lemon and ginger for such a small cake. BUT!!!!!! it came out perfect and tasted GREAT! I'd definitely make it again but double or quadruple the recipe.

I read the reviews thoroughly before I made this, and it seemed much more daunting than it was! I made it in the loaf pan, and it turned out fine. My only cautionary note is that if you're doing the glaze, make sure the cake has completely cooled. Mine was absorbed by the cake, which tasted fine, but wasn't as pretty as the photograph.

Don't be put off by some of the negative reviews here...this flavor is wonderful! I made it this afternoon, following the recipe as printed....except for..... just using the peel from one lemon & not measuring the amount. Other than that...because of the comments about it being a very small amount of batter, used an extra large muffin tin (1 Cup size) & filled 4 of them. Baked for 30 minutes at 350, & didn't bother with the glaze, as it wasn't needed. (Well, maybe I would have put on the glaze, but my husband is not as much for lemon as I am.) I think this would make a very nice base for strawberry, (or any berry) shortcake.

Rating: 3
Great ginger flavor but it seemed a little too dense. I wish the cake had turned out a little lighter and moister. I doubled the recipe for a bundt pan so I might have forgotten to double something. I'll give in another shot.

Well, thought by reading all the reviews I could escape making a mess of this cake, and I partially did, since only part of the cake remained in the 9" bundt pan! I am making it to decorate as a king cake for Mardi Gras tomorrow, so confectioners sugar icing and colored sugar crystals might camouflage the little craters. Wonder what makes this cake so different, in terms of unmolding, from all those we've all been making successfully for so many years? Pan size was great, just bit smaller than standard bundt.

I've made this twice (doubling the recipe) in an elaborate rose-shaped bundt pan. Used pam/flour-- and had no trouble unmolding. Flavours are great but , 2nd time, the cake deflated into a "wreath shape." Maybe I mixed too much or didn't cook long enough.... Any suggestions?

This cake was wonderful! I used triple the recipe for a bundt pan and it worked perfectly. Try it warmed up on the second or third day-really yummy! Mine came out of the pan just fine but you do need to turn it out right after taking it out of the oven.

Excellent pound cake! Love the combo of lemon and ginger - even more flavourful/mellow the next day. Nice and moist with a lovely texture - not overly dense/heavy. To fit a standard-size loaf pan, I increased all ingredient amounts by one half with good results. Easy to make and destined to become a family favourite for sure!

Made this cake and my picky "I don't like sweets" husband loved it (as did many of my co-workers).

I agree with most others that the recipe should be doubled. I thought I had forgotten to put in the baking powder as it did not rise very much. Otherwise it is a really nice cake - but the pan really needs to be greased well as it will stick.

YUM! I made this for a barbeque and it went fast. Put it in my bundt pan and buttered as best I could, but the little sucker stuck. It looked terrible and no amount of camouflage could do anything, but it was all about taste. My only qualm with this recipe is that it tells you to use a 4-5 cup pan instead of saying a 10" diameter pan, which I feel would be more accurate. Yes, I should have gone with other reviewers comments...definitely needs to be doubled!

Rating: 3
As suggested by other reviewers, I doubled the recipe, using a 10 cup bundt pan. I used non-stick cooking spray and turned over immediately, as suggested. Stuck slightly, but nothing that a little powdered sugar couldn't conceal! I skipped the frosting and everyone loved it; asked for the recipe. Made it for brunch.

I made it for Easter lunch in a gorgeous Wlliam Sonoma Fleurs de lille bunt pan. I only dusted it with icing sugar and it was delicate and elegant. Instead of grated fresh ginger I finely chopped 1/2 cup of candied ginger. The rest of the recipe was the same except that I needed to double it for the bundt pan. Extra special chic cake and simple.

Rating: 4
This is my all-time favorite cake. I've made it for many occasions and it's always wonderful. The only thing that annoys me is the small recipe. It needs to be tripled to fit into a regular bundt pan, and doubled to fit into a regular loaf pan. It's so good that i can't bear to make only a small recipe. Anyway, when i'm in the states, i substitute SMART BALANCE for the butter, and it turns out wonderful! I've also made this with only ground ginger when i couldn't get my hands on any fresh ginger. Still delicious! I've found that making a loaf is much easier than making the large bundt shape, just because my cooling rack is too small for the bundt pan and the whole cake falls apart when i try to take it out of the pan. Also just as delicious without the icing. It gets eaten so fast, i don't bother with the icing. Sometimes i just dust it with powdered sugar.

Loved the taste and texture of this wonderful pound cake. The only problem was getting the gems out of my mini bundt pans. Although it was non-stick and I used a non-stick spray and flour, I had problems. Will try the bread crumbs suggested by another reviewer.

Great cake and it keeps very well. I made it two days in advance, and then drizzled the icing on they day of the party. Not everyone was inclined to try it, but a number of people loved it. I was told that it is more lemon-ey than most lemon pound cakes they've tried... and the ginger definitiely keeps it moist and gives it a kick. I doubled the recipe for a larger bundt pan, but will likely triple it next time. Note: it does come out a little dense, but it's certainly still great.

I need to get a smaller pan! Mine came out looking like a wreath, too, but I glazed it and surrounded it on the service platter with mint leaves and brownies dusted with powdered sugar, and it looked great. Used butter and flour on a non-stick bundt pan, and it popped right out. My ginger was very wet, too, but it kept the cake moist even when I left it in the oven 5 minutes longer than I should have (oops!). Wonderful lemon and ginger flavors, kind of strong, but the meld beautifully if you hold the cake for a day before serving it. My sister can't keep her hands off it!

Have made this 3 times already. Be sure to not overmix this cake and don't overbake (the first time I made it, I overmixed - it didn't rise much and was rather dense and dry). I use a buttered Teflon coated loaf pan, bake the cake about 5 minutes less than recipe suggests and the cake pops right out. It's pretty with the glaze, moist and delicious. Have also made it with lime/lemon rind/juice and it was also good. Freezes well.

I have made this cake several times with great results! I first made it in a loaf pan which made it great for a family snack cake. Then as several tiny bundt cakes for a buffet party.

I wouldn't change a thing...just be sure you double the recipe if you are using a larger bundt pan.

I loved the flavor of this little cake. I frequently make pound cakes using a Bundt pan and I have never had a problem with the cake sticking to the pan. I simply use pan spray such as Pam or Mazola No-Stick. I use it for all my baking and nothing ever sticks.

I also made this in a loaf pan and it is a small cake, but I found it to be the perfect little "snack cake". My husband adored it! It was also a big hit with the office gang. I've also found that it is moist enough to stand alone (as a snack cake) without the sweet glaze.

I should have listened too. Butter and flour on the pan just don't do the trick. Other than that, the cake was wonderful! Not too sweet and very moist.

I have been experimenting with various pound cake recipes and found this one to be my favorite by far. The ginger and lemon combinations was a perfect taste balance. The texture was delightfully light for "pound cake", and the small sized bundt pan made a jewel of a cake. HERE IS A TIP FOR A SUCESSFUL BUNDT TURN-OUT. Use very soft room temp. butter applied with a pastry brush, coat pan with fine plain bread crumbs - not flour. You will be surprised how easily your cake will slide out of even the most fancy pan. Enjoy.

To Cook on 5/3 responding to the bundt pan question, please lighten up! The cook from NY was only asking for a little advice re: pans....not a big deal if it is NOT directly related to the recipe since pan size was a topic of contention and discussion here, and this person apparently thought someone would actually answer the question. The "Constant Comment" recipe reviews have become SO pompous and snotty recently, and that only discourages the kind of interaction this is SUPPOSED to be about. To Cook from NY with the pan size question: you might find it useful to buy the larger pan, if the recipe is only a 10 cupper it will still be okay but you will be set for either 10 or 12 C. with the larger pan (tho NOT for tiny recipes such as this one.....use a smaller or loaf pan instead). Good luck.

I should have listened . . . I baked this in a well-buttered bundt pan and scratched my head when the recipe said "remove from pan immediately." I figured it would come out more easily if it had cooled down a bit. Instead it's in crumbs, now, on the rack. I, too, will use it as a trifle with whipped cream and strawberries. Flavor is good. Go for the loaf pan!

i made this for a special pot-luck thingey at work celebrating May 5th. I added a bit of tequila to the glaze and used 1/2 cup walnuts in the cake. it is really good. i did have just a bit of trouble getting it out of the bundt pan but when it cooled off a bit, it seemed to come out more easily. the flavor is so much better than the run-of-the-mill pound cakes. is there any way to add our notes to the recipe file?

Rating: 0
many bundt cake recipes _do_ call for a 12 c pan, but some call for a 10 c pan. still, the matter at hand is that _this_ recipe calls for a far smaller pan (5-6 c). so, your 12 c pan will likely be inappropriate for this cake.

The lemon and fresh ginger are an excellent concept - very flavorful. Unfortunately, the cake fell apart when I inverted the bundt pan. This has given me some neat ideas on converting my grandmother's "old faithful" cake recipe, but I doubt I'll ever come back to this particular recipe again.

I made this cake and it came out too dense and it didn't really rise. I think it may be because the ginger varies so greatly in its amount of moisture. My ginger was very fresh and when pulsed was very wet. I did use the right size pan, and it still was like a little wreath.

Come on, be fair! The recipe clearly says '4 or 5 cup Bundt pan. You know that's going to be small. And you only have to look at the list of ingredients to see that these will only add up to a small cake. I used a 6 cup Bundt pan (it was all I had) knowing quite well that, because of the small size difference, the cake wouldn't turn out quite as well as if I'd used the correct size. My choice. I wish I'd used a loaf pan. Despite careful greasing, the cake stuck to the pan & I had quite a bit of reconstructing to do. Even though the cake looked awful, it did taste good on the first day. By day two, it had gotten very mushy & I couldn't cut clean slices. Not sure if this was the glaze sinking in or just the increasing moistness of the cake. I may try this again using a loaf pan (the fresh ginger/lemon flavour was pretty good) but I probably won't bother. Too many other great recipes out there.

You got me! I looked at the photo...saw the bundt pan and went for it...I kept thinking something was wrong, but went ahead because it sounded sooo good. And it was, but it came out looking like a wreath! Next time establish scale in the photo, because so few of us think of a bundt cake as TINY.

I was oversold on this one. I had the right size bundt pan - but the cake was still too small. It also did not rise well enough and it stuck to the pan.

The first time I made this cake I used a loaf pan and didn't add the ginger (per my husband's request) We thought it tasted fine but it didn't rise enough for my liking.

The flavor is quite good, but let's face it: this is an ugly little cake! I should have taken the recommendation of one reviewer and made it in a loaf cake. My bundt pan was also larger than the size recommended, and the result was a dwarf-cake! Even if the size were appropriate to the recipe, there is not much cake there. I will probably serve it pre-sliced on a platter with fresh strawberries.

Even though I did not have a small bundt pan the cake was still delicious. I used 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger instead of only 1/4 teaspoon. This was the moistest pound cake I have ever had which made it that much more enjoyable. All my Easter dinner guests also like it.

I made this cake a few days ago and thought the recipe was great and the result very tasty. I was afraid it would have a very overpowering ginger taste, but it was very nicely balanced with the lemon flavor. My only critique was that the glaze dried to a transparent finish and while tasting good, didn't do much to make the cake look good. I made the cake a second time today send to a friend in CA and skipped the glaze. It looks just as pretty without.

Well mine was not a pretty as the picture. I live above 5,000 feet and I made the adjustments for high altitude baking. It did not rise enough nor was the sides of the cake soft to eat. I used a dark bundt pan and baked it less than 40 mins. (till test stick came out clean). It left an after taste in your mouth and it was not lemony enough. But I did make the glaze and I infused it with heavy cream, whipped it and that helped make the cake a little better. I think the cake looks bueatiful and it must taste great to have made it into your mag. I will try this one again except with some changes. Any words of advice please write.

My husband and I love ginger so I added a TBSP more ginger for more zing. I also reduced the milk slightly and added 1/2 more Tsp of vanilla and was generous with the lemon juice. I cut back on the amount of lemon juice for the glaze and added spiced rum in its stead. Not a crumb was left at our last dinner party. I did find that this cake was best cooked in a loaf pan however.

Make sure you have no larger than a 4 -5 cup bundt pan! The ginger was too overpowering and not enough lemon taste.
