Who knew watermelon rind could be so delicious! No longer will I toss out the rind. No changes to the recipe. This was a delicious chutney. I served this with the grilled shrimp from this site - it was an excellent pairing. To the reviewer asking what to do with the chutney -- for a super fast & easy appetizer, top a block of cream cheese with the chutney, serve with crackers; or serve the chutney to accompany an assortment of cheese & cracker.

Fantastic! I made it as is and loved it! I also like to keep a bit of flesh on some of the pieces. The bits look like pink jewels and add a bit of color. I agree with the cook from Hong Kong that it makes the kitchen smell a bit funky, but the results are definitely worth it. My favorite way to serve it is with cream cheese and crackers or toast. I can't wait to try it with pork!

I made a smaller batch and varied the recipe by adding some diced onion and spices (cloves and allspice). I minced the watermelon rind fine. It's a great relish for field peas, and I think it's going to be great in chicken salad.

To the cook from Columbus: I used the chutney in a curried egg salad, and it definitely added some spice. I also used the chutney in a baked chicken dish and that added a nice sticky glaze to the chicken. Hope that helps!

I used Thai red chili to add some colors. The smell while cooking this was so pungent but it tastes really great. I can't wait to make curry so I can eat this as a side.
