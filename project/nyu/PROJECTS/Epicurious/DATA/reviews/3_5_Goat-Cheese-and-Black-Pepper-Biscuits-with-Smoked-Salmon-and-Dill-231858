Made these this weekend for a brunch. Used sour cream instead of butter on the biscuits. Also, found that I had to knead the dough for a minute or two to get everything to stick together.

These were very tasty! Like others I increased black pepper I also used 1 cup of buttermilk to get dough consistency right. I used a shot glass to make the biscuits about 1.5". Besides adding goat cheese to biscuits I used another 5 oz roll, crumbled it and mixed in my dill. I then spread this on 1 side of biscuit and a little butter on the other side. Tasty!

Served these at a small reception, but used a 1.75 inch fluted cutter and served them open-faced. Followed previous reviews, and left the goat cheese in large chunks. Got rave reviews. And a great presentation.

Good recipe for a party but if I made again, I'd spread goat cheese on the biscuits (maybe instead of putting it into the biscuit) because I didn't get much of a goat cheese flavor from the dough and I thought they were a little dry.

Superb! An elegant and delicious appetizer. Made them 1 1/2" as suggested, doubled the pepper, and spread some extra goat cheese on the slices.

I just made these for a church reception and they were very popular. I made them much smaller -- about an inch to an inch and a half so they were bite-sized, and they made 36 lovely little biscuits. I didn't have buttermilk so I used lite cream. Also, when I made them previously, the goat cheese flavor in the biscuit didn't come through as much as I liked, so I spread the bottom with a spreadable goat cheese, added the salmon slice, a sprig of dill, and buttered the top. They came out much better. Also, consider buying salmon "trim" for this; they're bits and ends but they work fine and are much cheaper (and thinner, which is nice for the tiny biscuits). I also recommend "baby" dill; use the finest you can find, and nip the very tips off. Keep the twiggy stuff off the biscuits so it's not tough to bite. And thanks for posting this recipe; I'd clipped it back when it was first published but lost it. I was delighted to find it again on your website!

These were easy to make and great to eat with some Plugra (high fat butter) and homemade gravlax...my mouth is watering as we speak!!

I second the ideas of doubling the back pepper and leaving big chuncks of goat chees in the dough. I also think it is best to serve this open face and get twice the servings. Otherwise, you really have to pile on the salmon to get a good ratio of fish to biscuit. Very pretty and tasty!

These were yummy, fluffy biscuits, but there wasn't enough pepper taste, and I doubled the pepper. I like the goat cheese bits in them.

The biscuits, hot from the oven, are really delicious. But later, with the salmon, there's just not enough flavor there. Maybe with an additional goat cheese spread....

My pepper grinder sucks, so I don't think I used enough pepper. I liked these, but they were not all that popular with my guests - maybe they didn't like the fresh dill?

These were only okay to us. Perhaps didn't use the correct kind of goat cheese, but the taste didn't come through much.

Nice light texture to the biscuts and a perfect platform for good quality smoked salmon. Be sure not to mix the goat cheese into the batter too much, as the pockets of cheese provide welcome explosions of flavour.

Made this for an Easter brunch. They were absolutly delicious and so tender. However, ended up haveing to add 1/2 to 3/4 more of flour before they finally came together. Will definitly make again.

I took this to an Easter brunch--baked off the biscuits in the morning and filled them when we arrived. They were excellent! I added a little extra pepper (using a 4-pepper blend), and doubled the recipe no problem. And yes, you should use parchment--it will let them rise properly and keep them from sticking.

is it necessary to use the parchment paper on the baking sheets? i am not much of a baker so i'm just trying to figure out why you'd do that...also, is aluminum foil acceptable?

The biscuits are wonderful! Use them in any number of savory combinations if you don't care for salmon!

I made this as an appetizer for a ladies luncheon and it went over very well.

Made these with my smallest biscuit cutter for appetizers, served w/red pepper jelly as reviewer suggested. They went quickly. The one I ate hot from the oven was excellent.

This is really not a complete rating. My niece made these for me and her mother one morning, only to discover she had forgotten to buy the salmon! But she forged ahead and made the biscuits with everything else and they were delicious, nonetheless. BUT what I really want to do is thank "another cook from Ottawa" for the tip on the pepper grinder - I ordered one immediately and it arrived today - fantastic! There is nothing I love more than a good course grind of pepper! Thanks!

Actually it SOUNDS delicious - but before I make it can anyone tell me if the Biscuits are crisp or soft-crumb...goats cheese is fairly expensive where I stay so I'd like to be sure!

Great recipe! To the cook from Ottawa -a turkish coffee grinder does the trick for freshly ground pepper - 2 turns and you have close to a teaspoon. They can be found on-line for as little as $14.95.

These were the fluffiest biscuits I've ever made. This is a keeper. Smaller biscuits make great appetizer portions.

To the cook from Ottawa from another cook in Ottawa: Go to peppergun.com and look at their magnum plus pepper grinder. It holds almost a cup of peppercorns and grinds effortlessly. It was top-rated by Cook's Illustrated and we have had ours for a couple of years and just love it.

I made this recipe for the appetizer at a small dinner party. Everyone loved it and there were no leftovers. I used a 4 pepper mix (we didn't have straight black pepper) and that was very good. I got fewer biscuits than noted in the recipe patting it out to the mentioned thickness, but it made a nice size biscuit. The only time consuming part of the recipe is grinding the pepper with a manual pepper mill. I will be adding this to my "use regularly" list.

This recipe is great if you love pepper! I patted the dough out and instead of cutting into round biscuits, I cut the dough into big wedges and brushed with milk for a nice golden colour! I served with red pepper jelly for the veg-heads in the crowd...was a hit!
