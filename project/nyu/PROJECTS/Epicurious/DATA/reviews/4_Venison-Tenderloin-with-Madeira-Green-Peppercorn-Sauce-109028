Used beef tenderloin tonight and then followed recipe. It was phenominal chased all over town for the green peppercorns brined, so glad we did. Will make again and again.

Really Delicious and easy!. Served it with red potatoes, oven roasted with o-o, salt and rosemary. Also, button mushrooms sauteed in butter with Garlic, S&P and dried porcini's reconstituted. Excellent fall dish!

Apparently California has a health safety law that does not allow venison or other wild game to be processed at butcher shops that process beef, pork, etc. Does anyone know where to buy venison in the SF Bay Area?

I eat alot of venison, and I am always looking for a new recipe. This was an GREAT find. I will use this again and again!

I've cooked venison alot, and found this recipe while looking for some new ideas. I'd never used green peppercorns in brine before, so was looking forward to a new taste. I have to say I was dissappointed. The green peppercorns lend a slight "chemical" flavor, reminiscent of a cleaner. I bought the most expensive ones that Whole Food had, but the flavor was just "off". Other than that, this is really just a basic red wine pan sauce; much better if you leave out the green peppercorns.

This is a wonderful recipe - easy to make and delicious. Venison tenderloin is not nearly as gamey as the rest of the cuts one can buy. And the sauce make a nice accompaniment. Will certainly make this again.

Easy and recipe is adaptable. Marsala is a good substitute. I thought I lost the recipe_would have been disastrous since we get venison fresh every season from neighbor.

Very easy to make, very impressive. My tenderloin did not hold together, but other than that it was great!

Delish - I have had various cuts of venison occupying my freezer since last hunting season. I was afraid to cook (ok, and maybe to eat) it but it was excellent prepared mostly as directed here although the cooking times were too short for even my medium-rare loving hubby. I did take the suggestions from the cook in Berkeley and used what I had in the cupboard which included the same ingredients and methods s/he used as well as a Rioja wine and beef broth - I'm sure it would be better prepared as directed but this allowed me to avoid a special trip to the store. My husband loved it and we'll be making it for guests this weekend.

I love this recipe, it has become a staple in my house because venison is always in my freezer. I use this recipe to introduce venison to skeptics. They always rave over it. I often substitute Marsala wine for the Madeira and use beef "Better than Bouillon" mixed with 1/2 cup of water instead of the demi-glace. Much better to eat "free range" venison than the antibiotic, hormone fed beef from the store!

I will definately make this again. We grilled the meat on the outside gas grill. Followed the recipe for the sauce, but used dried green peppercorns, which were coursely chopped. Also added chopped mushrooms, garlic and dash of soy sauce. Did not have Madeira, but used Port wine. Delicious!!!

Just made this for my first dinner party in my newly renovated kitchen. Yummy yummy. Not quite enough sauce but it was delicious!

I am always looking for something to do with venison and this recipe was a winner. I used pink peppercorns instead of green and the sauce was wonderful! The parsnip chips took it over the top. The whole thing pared beautifully.

Working with what was available, I made a few amendments to the receipe and it turned out great. Used venison medallions instead of tenderloin and just used a skillet. Got the meat going then put it to the side. Used onion instead of shallot and threw some garlic and finely diced portobello mushroom and dry black peppercorns. Sauteed long to caramelize everything, then deglazed with madiera and a tiny splash of soy sauce. Skipped demi-glace altogether. Added meat back in the end to finish everything. Came out great. Served with mushroom rice, asparagus and fresh rolls. Kind of a different recipe than what is listed, but thought I'd share my ideas for those who want to make this dish working with what's maybe already in the cupboard...

I love all things with venison - you don't need to hunt these days to get venison, many supermarkets such as Whole Foods Markets carry frozen farm raised venison - you can also mail order it online - broadleafgame is one of many companies that offers it. You can just do a google search for frozen farm raised venison. Also, you can make this dish even simpler by using venison medallions and just pan searing them - note that venison should be rosy when cooked, not gray!

I have not actually made this recipe yet but it looks great for a nice little Valentine's dinner for a beginner cook. I had a few questions about where to get the venison for this recipe. Besides going into the forest with a gun and hunting a deer for myself, I do not know of many places for venison. HELP!

This was a great recipe. The directions worked just perfect. It was fairly quick and easy to make. The sauce is wonderful with the wine and peppercorn. They add just the right flavors to compliment the venison. Next time I might even substitute Port instead of Maderia. My husband was a bit skeptical when I said we were having venison for dinner, as he has had it only once before, a long time ago. Much to my surprise he yummed thru dinner and gave the recipe a high rating. This is a keeper. I would highly suggest it to everyone!

Wow! What a payoff! I made this for New Year's Eve, and it was it's own special occasion. I can't get over how good this tasted, especially when you consider how easy it was to make.

My husband grew up eating A LOT of deer so he isn't a big fan of it because he ate too much of it but he REALLY liked this recipe. I didn't make it using tenderloin but the sauce was great!

I have made this several times and it is delicious. Even my friends who profess to dislike venison have asked for it again. I usually play with recipes, but this is perfect as is. Try it!!!

Awesome! I made this for two big guys and they couldn't get enough. One of them said he'd "go to his grave" remembering this meal...thanking me over and over. I used all ingredients as stated except made my own concentrated broth from organic beef broth instead of the demiglace. The parsnip crisps were really easy to make and a big hit. This was a very memorable meal. The guys want it again next week.

Amazing. I used wild boar (check me out, I'm exotic) and it was truly amazing and really came together pretty quickly. Very impressive for not too much work.

Awesome recipe! Had to switch the Madeira with Sherry and the peppercorns for capers but it was still a wonderful dish. Can't wait for next years deer season. The kids loved the Parsnip Chips too. A definte do-over!

This was the best venison we have every had. I had to replace the Madiera with Sherry and the green peppercorns with capers but it was still outstanding!

Definitely the parsnips; I fried them in a wok on medium heat and they were perfect. Actually had to re-search for this recipe to make it again second time in 2 weeks.

demi-glace!? 1/3 cup...really!? How do you use demi-glace (straight? mixed with water?). The sauce tasted strangly like demi-glace. I am sure this is due to my ignorance. Please enlighten me. I will re-rate this recipe if I did something wrong.

This recipe was fantastic! Instead of venison tenderloin, we cooked venison backstrap. We seared it in the pan (like the recipe), but then finished it off on the grill, which gave a good smokey flavor. For the sauce, we didn't have madeira, so we substituted brandy. We also added a touch of red wine. It turned out wonderful! I highly recommend this recipe.

hard to find the green peppercorns, but VERY yummy. I didnt have any tenderloin left from the deer, but I cut out a tender section from the inner shoulder, and had to wrap it with string to get the "tenderloin shape", but it was still delicious.

WOW!! This was incredible! Luckily (for me) my friends' freezer bit the dust and rather than having everything spoil, he decided to let everyone take anything that they wanted. I grabbed the venison. You can also use venison cubed steaks lightly breaded and fried and topped with the demi-glace. This is "slap yo mama" good!

I've made this twice now. I think I liked it better without the brined peppercorns (we used freeze dried green peppercorns the first time). And the parsnip chips are a must.

FABULOUS! I used filet mignon rather than venison. It was absolutely delicious and came out perfect. I found a concentrated demi-glace at Whole Foods made by More Than Gourmet for about $4.95. There is a website on the package as well: www.morethangourmet.com.

This dish is wonderfull. I made it with filet mignon and I made my own demi glace by just making a rich brown sauce with beef stock and wine. The cooking time and temps were right on. The resting covered in foil is essential.

Okay. It took me about three stores to find the veal demi-glace (finally found it - at $15/bag!). Never did find venison. But I made it with filet mignon and it swept my husband off his feet. He couldn't stop raving about it, even if I did overcook the filet just a tad. The parsnip crisps were terrific and easy and quite the touch to help present this as an elegant dish! Perfect "company" meal.

Wonderful meal for Valentines Day. I used the beef tenderloin and it turned out to be a tasteful alternative. Instead of parsnips, I used sweet potatoes - that was almost my favorite part of the dinner! TO THE PREVIOUS POSTER: Yes, I saw demi-glace in Whole Foods, but it costs about $13 (I made my own instead...it's easy).

Green pepercorns are often near the capers in grocery stores.

This recipe is wonderful! My husband hunts, therefore we have more venison & other wild game in our freezer than beef. I couldn't find the green peppercorns; any tips where I can get them for next time?

This is the way Wolfgang Puck makes pork chops -- sear on the stove then high-heat roasting. I made pork tenderloin like this last night. It is a quick and delicious way to prepare excellent cuts of meat...you will never get a dried-out result using this method! If you don't have Madeira, try Sherry, Marsala, or Port. A different result, but just about all fortified wines will work.

MMMM this was SO good! My mom even asked me to make it again. I prefered to use the venision virsus the beef because My Father hunts and as 2 HUGE freezers FULL of game! It was very easy too!

Delicious and simple recipe. Great taste and the best way to serve a great dinner to our guests. I recomend that is much better made with venison than beef tenderloin.
