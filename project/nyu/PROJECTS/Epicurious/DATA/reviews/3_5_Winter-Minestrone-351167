I had almost everything except the chard (which I omitted) and substitute the beans with black eye beans instead. Also, instead of 3 quarts of water (don't you think it's too much?), I used 1 quart of veg stock and 1 quart of water. Lastly, I sprinkled some crushed red peppers for abit of heat. I had to resist adding herbs in the pot, but I did add some fresh basil in my bowl which improved the taste. I think the pancetta and parmasan rind did the trick, so don't miss that out!

When it's 15º outside and there's nothing to do, make this soup! It's delicious! I followed this recipe to a tee, only adding a little more salt before the chard. Lacking in taste? Not a chance! Just take the time to make the soffritto and you'll be amazed by the delicious flavors.

I made quite a few changes, based on the ingredients I could find (and I forgot to buy the Parmigiano rind) but love this soup. Here are the changes: - I used chicken thighs instead of pancetta since I don't eat ham - couldn't find Swiss chard, so threw in a handful of spinach - also added green beans, eggplant, zucchini. I like this soup - definitely will make again.

Absolutely delicious. Omitted celery,cabbage and escarole. Substituted gourmet thick-sliced bacon, a few links hot turkey sausage, frozen lima beans and dried basil. Excellent flavor!!

Sounded good, but missing something. Even with the addition of veggie stock and thyme it fell below the sum of its parts.

Really good. Didn't use the chard -- just used kale and savoy cabbage. Also added some chicken broth. Also I used a combo of cannellini beans (some whole, some pureed into the broth), and garbanzo beans. Really hearty/tasty winter meal.

I could not find escarole or savoy cabbage in my grocery store but found this soup delicious. I will still review the recipe as the alterations were very minor (it irks me when people review a recipe after completely changing the ingredients)! I used regular cabbage and skipped the escarole. The flavor is amazing. Definitely don't skimp on the pancetta or the parmigiano-reggiano rind. You definitely don't need to use stock in place of water, but if you must, use vegetable stock. Chicken or beef stock would really change the balance of flavors here. The serving size is perfect for 4 hungry people for dinner (about 2 servings each) with a bit left over, or as a first course for about 8 people. You definitely need to use your largest pot. I liked adding the pasta at the end, made this soup heartier. Next time, I could see adding in a different type of bean in addition to the cannelini and/or throwing in some thyme or oregano just for kicks.

I replaced the water with three parts veg stock and one part pork stock, because I had them in the freezer. I also cut the recipe in half (there are only two of us).

LOVE this soup. I had to rate it 3 instead of 4 for a couple reasons. First, a half recipe was easily 8 servings, and I really can't imagine how much a full recipe would make! Second, there is just no reason to use water instead of broth here. And finally, the addition of a little dried thyme really made this soup, which would've been bland without it. All that said, the finished product was delicious, satisfying, filling, and exactly the kind of healthy soup I crave when a spring cold knocks me out.

I am just about to finish making this soup and boy I am dissapointed. I kept going back to the recipe to see where I went wrong, but I followed it to the T. It has no taste other than tomato. I just added some bay leaves and basil; hopefully it will have some taste after that. The preparation and cooking is too long. Who cares if it's for an excellent result? Not on this cooks of the world...One fork, at best, for this Minestrone

Rating: 4
great soup. swapped out rapini (broccoli rabe) for swiss chard -- cut the tender stems and put them in the soffrito instead of swiss chard stems. but i put the rapini leaves in at the same time as the cabbage. at the end i added spinach (not baby) instead of the escarole. i resisted the temptation to use chicken broth instead of water and am glad i did. this has a very pure tomato/cabbage acidity over the pancetta and olive oil fat. as others warn, this makes a huge amount, so i was glad i halved the proportions. but also glad i have lots left over!

Rating: 4
Made this yesterday for a cold snowy night. Wow, it is great! Yes, it takes some time, but not terribly difficult and the result got rave reviews around here. Made it with italian sausage meat instead of the pancetta, which made for a meatier soup. The local grocery store only had regular cabbage instead of Savoy, but it all worked out just perfectly. Lovely and rich, lots of complex flavors, served with a nice glass of red wine, makes the storm a lot less bad!

Rating: 4
I double the pancetta and render it out BEFORE adding the soffritto. Also, we add 1# of lean beef cubed and use beef stock in place of water. Really deepens the flavor. Parm rind is crucial as is the long sautee of the soffritto. Its a great soup!

Rating: 4
this is delicious! i'd never heard of browning the veggies/pancetta mixture for so long to develop flavor, but it works...i used kale stems/greens instead of the chard stems, and added more beans that i had cooked. this recipe is a keeper; it's a beautiful soup!

The 45 minutes of stewing the bacon/pancetta with the onions and such made the soup. Very delicious for a winter night.

OMG, this is soup! And, yes, you can modify it to your taste. I reduced the water by 1 quart, added more variety of beans & included thyme. Next time, I will include a few bay leaves, basil & who knows what else. I learned a new tip too. I will never discard chard stems again! YUM!!!

I left out the savoy cabbage and added small whole grain elbow macaroni at the very end. I grated some excellent pecorino Romano for the table. The recipe is fairly time consuming but excellent, and obviously very healthy. I would definitely make it again and perhaps experiment with different greens for variety.

Rating: 3
While I thoroughly enjoyed this dish my husband thought it was a bit vegetable heavy. When reheating I solved that issue by adding a bit of chicken broth, although I personally liked the stew-type quality. It tasted super healthy and hearty to me but yes, you need to be ready for some serious veggie eating!

Rating: 4
I give this 4 forks even thought I did make modifications to the recipe. I did not have Parmesan rind or pancetta handy. Instead I added 2 - 3 teaspoons of chicken base and near the end a Tablespoon of miso. Both of those add the depth of flavor that made it a huge hit. The sofrito make a delicious soup and the base and miso rounds out the flavors. Yum!

Rating: 4
I am really having a hard time understanding the bad reviews on this soup. I made it according to the directions other than subbing Napa Cabbage for Savoy and it turned out great. I used all organic quality ingredients and that might make a little difference, but this is not Campbell's soup. It is a healthy soup that has a deepness of flavors brought by using fresh healthy product and it not taste like sodium and flour. I think that many of the reviewers that don't like this or felt that it needed broth are just used to processed and over salted food.

Rating: 2
I agree that this soup is good but not outstanding. It needs something that I can't put my finger on - some sort of depth of flavor. I think the best part is all the delicious greens.I won't save this recipe but I do enjoy trying all the minestrone recipes to see if they can surpass my grandma's.

I hate to leave negative feedback - but this was a tremendous disappointment. Definitely not the sum of its parts. It took extreme doctoring to elevate the flavor of the broth from its original dish water pallor. Make a different soup.

I have been searching for a good hearty minestrone recipe and now I have found it. This recipe is everything it says it is, a good hearty winter meal. Although after reading the recipe, I was compelled to make a few alterations. In lieu of water I used chicken broth, added a cup and a half of wine, added another two tablespoons of tomato paste, 1 small bunch of Italian parsley and a half cup of chopped fresh basil. I also added an additional two cans of beans. Needless to say, the flavor was fantastic and we have enough for the freezer. Serve with some good rustic bread and you have a wonderful meal.

This was good, but not great. I followed the recipe and made only one exception based on the other reviews. I added some chicken stock instead of all water. Frankly, it wasn't that much better than the Weight Watchers Zero-point soup that uses boxed vegetable stock. Certainly not worth all the extra steps.

Great recipe - full of vegetables and great for a cold winter day. My kids, who don't like vegetables, ate every bit. I cooked ditalini separately and added as needed, so it wouldn't absorb too much broth.

Loved this soup for all the greens. I had a fatty pancetta, so I removed the "floaters" that came to the surface before putting in the beans. Added a can of kidney beans too to make the soup heartier. I'd probably use a bit under a pound of pasta as it really absorbs the liquid. Need a lot of parm. Really intense flavor and super healthy!

This is the best tomato based soup I've ever made. I used Kale and red swiss chard, I also used half stock half water. The carmelized tomato paste is genius, don't skip it. I also added a can of dark red kidney beans. PERFECT for a cold, wet, fall evening.

I had a craving for a hearty soup, and this one completely satisfied me. I used bacon instead of pancetta and kale in lieu of swiss chard and omitted the savoy cabbage and tomato paste altogeher. The bacon and the parmesan rind gives the soup its deep flavor and the vegetable combination is simply delectable. I did use low sodium chicken broth, which gave it even more richness. Unlike some other reviewers, I didn't find the chopping so bad as the directions do state that you can chop at a leaisurely pace and add in the vegetables as you finish. Definitely too much soup for 4 people, and I will freeze the leftovers. Great for a cold winter afternoon, especially when topped with more parmesan cheese accompanied by really good crusty French bread.

Rating: 4
D-lish! I used vegetable stock instead of water and only 2 quarts instead of 3 to make it more stew like. I also added 2 extra Parmesan rinds. I didn't have escarole so I used endive. With these minor tweaks it's definitely a keeper.

Excellent! Super yummy and deep tasting. The only downside is that it makes a ton of soup. I left out the swiss chard since I couldnt find it at my grocery store and used black beans since I didnt have any cannellini beans in my pantry, but otherwise, followed the receipe. Added uncooked orzo when I added the beans. Perfect.

Very good but not unusual or "wow". I like the suggestion of the previous reviewer to add more beans. I didn'thave a parmesan rind on hand, so I will definitely have to add that next time. I didn't think it was really THAT much "prep work" compared to many recipes, and per the recipe intro, once you got going you could pretty much prep as you went. Does make a HUGE amount of soup.

Rating: 4
I loved this soup and so did everyone I served it to! I used bacon instead of pancetta and half low-sodium chicken broth instead of water. I just used all the escarole and cabbage I had so it may have been more than called for, especially the cabbage which I think was 8 oz. Also that one can of beans looked sad in there so I added two more (one of chickpeas, one of kidney beans) and might go to 4 cans next time, all different. Yes, it was a bunch of prep work but the results were fabulous! Will make this a couple times every winter for sure. Yield was much more than 8 servings and it freezes beautifully.

Good and hearty meal.

I absolutely loved this recipe. My grocery store didn't have any chard or pancetta so I used kale and bacon instead. I reduced the bacon down to half a pound though so it wouldn't take over the flavor. The leftovers were awesome and I will absolutely make this again!

This soup should be called "Must Love Chopping." The prep work is extensive and the results are good, not great. But you have to love how healthy it is...thus, I'm giving it 3 forks instead of 2. I made this the day before I wanted to serve it, hoping that the flavors would deepen...that didn't really happen. On the plus side, it's healthy and hearty and makes a huge amount of soup.

Rating: 3
Very good healthy, hearty soup. My store was out of Pancetta, however, and I subbed in a good, thick bacon. Wouldn't recommend doing that, as the bacon flavor permeated everything. I would also keep the noodles separate and just add when serving. My leftovers yielded mushy pasta. But on the whole a very yummy soup! And I agree, makes a TON of soup.

Amazing winter soup. Couldn't find savoy cabbage so I used bok choy instead - wow! Otherwise, I kept to the recipe. The house was filled with comforting smells, and our bellies are happy and full. This makes more than 8 servings - hope the portions I froze thaw out okay.

Agree with the last reviewer "Overall this is a solid recipe that will become a staple with some tweaking." This is a rather simple dinner, eating healthy and keeping the veggie content high and calories moderate. I thought replacing some of the water with stock was helpful. I was surprised how well it held up for leftovers. I helped the leftovers with some Asian fish sauce. My husband said that it improved with the day in the fridge, but I think it was the fish sauce which will be added up front next time.

Overall this is a solid recipe that will become a staple with some tweaking. I omitted the escarole and the pasta because I didn't think I could fit anything more in the pot. The pancetta was too fatty for my taste and did not add that much flavor, so next time I will use turkey bacon. The parmigiano rind adds a great flavor, and I will definitely keep that in future batches. The recipe makes a lot of soup. It's great with garlic bread.

FABULOUS & delish on a cold winter's night. I omitted the cabbage & opted to add brown rice, rather than pasta. Served with tons of pecorino-romano cheese & freshly grated black pepper. YUM!

A nice minestrone recipe. I didn't have the "patience" the recipe called for to let the veggies saute for 45 minutes -- I did it for more like 20-25. The results were still flavorful, primarily because of the pancetta. This was a great way to cook with loads of healthy greens -- much tastier than salad in the dead of January. I omitted the pasta, but will definitely add pasta the next time, as the soup needed more substance.

Fantastic recipe. I omitted pancetta and used some chicken stock for flavor.

Perhaps I just do not like minestrone, but this soup was a lot of work, and the taste was only good...not great. Per other reviews, I used low salt chicken broth and a larger Parmigiano-Reggiano rind. I also used extra cannellini beans; I pureed half and left the other half whole. Even my husband, who does like minestrone, said it was good, not great.

First I'd like to say that I wanted to give this 1 fork, but I averaged my vote with my husband's, who liked the broth quite a bit (we used 1 quart chicken stock and 2 quarts water, and lots of parmesan rind). I had never had boiled/simmered cabbage before, and it turns out I don't like it. At all. That would have ruined this soup for me anyway, but also the ratio of greens to beans is much too high for my taste. I think of minestrone as being a "beanier" soup than this was. Very disappointing, especially as this was quite a bit of work (shouldn't have tried to do it on a weeknight). It does make a ton of soup, my 8 quart pot was totally full.

I would have given this 3.5 but of course that's not possible. Although in general I don't like minestrone, this is the best I've ever had. It is hearty, has a richer flavor than most minestrone, and is full of vegetables. It definitely needed a lot of salt though. To reiterate other reviewers, I'm not sure that water and Parmesian rind was enough.

Great as is, but more interesting if the parmesan rind is used as an edible ingredient. To do this, scrape the outside of the rind to remove as much waxy covering as possible. Simmer the whole piece of rind in the soup to soften. Remove, then chop into tiny cubes. Return to the pot and cook as usual. Adds taste and some interesting texture.

Very good. I'm usually not a minestrone fan because I find the tomato base overwhelms the other flavors, but this one was great. We didn't bother with the pasta and didn't have a Parmesan rind but I'm sure those two things would make it even better.

I have never been a fan of minestrone, but when I read this recipe I thought "this might be the one". It was! I love this soup. I kept sneaking back to the fridge to eat spoonfuls of the leftovers (which, to my mind, tasted even better after it had cooled somewhat). I used napa cabbage (couldn't find savoy) and I completely omitted the escarole (couldn't find it either and didn't want to substitute another green). I didn't have a big enough pot to clear space for the tomato paste, so I caramelized the tomato paste in a separate, small frying pan and that worked quite well. I was prepared to need to add a little chicken broth for flavor, but I didn't think it needed it -- the parmesan rind plus the browning and the pancetta made a tasty, if subtle, broth. In the future I might use bacon instead of the pancetta for a more intense flavor, but that's the only change I plan to make. As others have noted, this recipe makes a huge amount - I tried to make a 2/3 recipe and still ended up with enough to feed 8 people!

Rating: 3
Am having my first bowl of this soup now and enjoying it thoroughly. My broth came out richly-flavored, though I was very skeptical about using water instead of stock. I can see how it could be improved by using part stock and / or by adding herbs, but I think it's quite delicious as-is. I used good farmstead bacon in place of the pancetta, so maybe that made a difference.

Rating: 4
Just finishing the soup now. For more flavor, I added dried oregano & basil, less water, a little more parmesan rind and a little more tomato paste. I also used what I had in the house -- broccoli rabe stems & leaves instead of Swiss chard, regular cabbage instead of savoy. I also trimmed the fat from the pancetta. Delicious!

Rating: 4
Quite possible the best, healthiest minestrone I've ever had or made. And easy and impressive to boot. Guests raved about it and left overs didn't last long -- it does make quite a bit, more than 8 servings I'd say. Get San Marzano tomatoes if you can. They're worth it.

I made this amazing soup last night for dinner. It could really feed a crowd, but there were only 2 of us, so we'll be eating it for a while! I made changes based on what I had on hand- smoked chicken sausages instead of pancetta, and only 2 greens- kale and savoy cabbage. I think a third green would have made the soup very dense. As it was it came out fantastic! Oh, I also added some chicken stock- 1 quart, like others did. This is the first time I have used a parmesan rind, and it made a big difference in the richness of the soup. Can't wait to have it for lunch!

Made this fabulous soup today for New Years. Used leftover Christmas ham in place of pancetta. I nearly minced it. Used spinach and regular cabbage and no beans or pasta as I didn't have them.

This soup sounded so appealing, but it turned out pretty much tasteless. I followed the recipe to a T, and had to add tremendous amounts of salt, pepper, chicken bouillon and more tomato paste to give it flavor. If I were to make again, I would use chicken broth, not water. Not to mention, this is an extremely tedious recipe. It took FOREVER. In the end it tasted decent with extra parm. Not really worth your time (or money).

Rating: 4
Great winter soup. I followed the recipe exactly except for adding 30oz of cannellini beans instead of 19oz. My Parm-Regg rind was probably a bit larger as well but I would recommend adding a little more than the recipe calls for anyway. If you make this be sure that you have a BIG pot. I used a 7 1/4Qt Le Creuset french oven and had to omit the ditalini pasta for lack of space. A 9Qt french oven would have been perfect. I would not recommend using a large stockpot for this recipe unless it is wider than most. The large french oven provides plenty of surface area on bottom to spread out the soffritto and push it aside when you need to carmelize the tomato paste. It also allows you to develop plenty of fond which adds rich flavor to the soup. I let the soffritto cook until it was really sticking to the bottom to eak out as much flavor as I could. Besides that, this is a great recipe that delivers what it promises. Will make it every winter.

Rating: 4
Delicious, nutritious and flexible! I used kale and ordinary green cabbage, as I had these greens on hand. Definitely take the time to let the sofrito caramelize - this really makes the dish exceptional. Lots of full flavor, terrific texture and just the perfect thing on a cold winter night. I served it with garlic toasts and topped the soup with grated asiago cheese. This is a keeper!
