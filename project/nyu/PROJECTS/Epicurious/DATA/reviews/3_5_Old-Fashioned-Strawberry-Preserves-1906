This was really simple. It is very sweet by itself, but on a bagel with cream cheese, it is perfect. I like other reviewers thought it took a little longer to fully come together; 30 minutes.

I reduced the sugar substantially (1/2 cup) and boiled until it reached a simple syrup/soft candy consistency (15 minutes total). Cooled on a plate in the fridge for rapid jelling.

This recipe is very good, but it took a little longer than the directions said it would.

I make this recipe each year when strawberries are at their peak. I do cut down the sugar by half and add a bit of lemon juice. Wonderful! Since I'm not into canning, I freeze large quantities in plastic containers and that works very well. Do same with blueberries and wild raspberries.

I'll never buy store-bought jam again.

I made this and it is wonderful. I then decided to make up for Christmas gifts. I purchased some very pretty jars, ribbon, baskets and clear colored paper and made the gifts. It was loved by all! Thank you!

This was simple (although it took closer to 30 minutes to thicken for me) and it tastes delicious. In nice jars, with pretty labels and a little raffia tied around the top,it makes a great homemade gift.
