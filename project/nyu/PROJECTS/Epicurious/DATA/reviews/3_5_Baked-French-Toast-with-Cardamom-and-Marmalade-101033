While this is an attractive dish, I found it too sweet and too rich. I may try it again but cut out the sugar and replace the cream with milk.

I made this for a New Year's Day brunch and everyone loved it. I guess my only complaint would be that it's almost too rich. Also, I would recommend baking it a little longer.

I made this for a baby shower brunch and it was a hit -- just delicious. The bread that I used wasn't as thick as what the recipe called for so I made marmalade "sandwiches," which were 1-inch thick. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla and a dash of cinammon. Based on other reviewers' comments, I modified the syrup. I used 3/4s of a cup of Lyle's Golden Syrup, doubled the citrus peel, and used only one teaspoon of sugar. It was fabulous and not too sweet.

Yum! I'm rating this recipe, although I changed it slightly because it might be helpful to others interested in the recipe but needing to save time. I didn't even use marmalade, just the egg mixture, and added nutmeg, cinnamon, a touch more cardamom (which made it!). Soaked for about 30 minutes some slices of a whole-wheat baguette. Then simply sauteed in a pan on the stove. This french toast was delicious, especially if you like cardamom. Also, done this way, the bread is perhaps crispier, and yet has plenty of flavor. Highly recommend this recipe for a twist on traditional french toast!

I've made this a few times and it is so delicious. Guests always rave over it, and it couldn't be simpler to make. I have never made the citrus syrup but pure maple works out just fine.

The french toast was good, but I think there was a little too much cardamom, maybe. The citrus syrup was cloyingly sweet, even for my sugar-addict husband, and was not particularly popular among my guests.

I used white boule bread and spread a very thin layer of marmalade--I think that's the way to do it. I split the bread between two bake dishes but still had a soup of custard at the bottom. So I drained off the excess before I baked the toast--brilliant consistency and not soggy at all! A pat of unsalted butter cuts any remaining bitterness of the marmalade. This was delicious--rich, but impressive.

This received rave reviews when served for brunch with family and friends. I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using Challah bread instead of a loaf of egg bread. Challah bread is egg based so it was a similar subsitution. Was unsure how the citrus syrup would turn out, but it complemented the french toast perfectly. French toast was not unlike bread pudding in consistency, perhaps a bit firmer. The beauty of this recipe is you can prepare ahead of time and put it in the oven before guests arrive so you aren't busy in the kitchen instead of socializing with your guests. I served it with a fruit salad of berries and it went perfectly.

I first tested this on my husband and he loved it! I then made it for a bridal shower brunch for 15 people and it got rave reviews! Everyone wanted to take the recipe home!

Like others, couldn't find egg bread. Substituted one loaf of Great Harvest Bread company challah, which was big enough for the egg mixture, but certainly didn't fill the baking dish size. The general flavor was wonderful (the bread was a perfect texture), but I wouldn't use the orange marmalade again. Overpowered the dish. Would use some berry flavor. But still easy to put together and wonderful make-ahead. Like the convenience.

I forgot to add... this recipe doesn't need any syrup topping. I think that would be overkill.

OK, so it was 12:30 p.m. on Christmas Eve when I finally got around to thinking about what I should make for Christmas morning breakfast... I guess it was finally time to try one of these do-ahead French toast recipes. I didn't have egg bread or marmalade on hand (and I WASN'T going back out to another store!) so I used sourdough and blueberry preserves (Trappist brand). Also, it was just hubby & my 14-month-old, so I used only two 1" slices cut in half with half of the custard ingredients. I added the nutmeg as suggested elsewhere and kept the cardamom. Everything soaked ina 9"ie plate for about 18 hours. I brought it out of the fridge about an hour before cooking and then baked for 30 minutes. OH MY GOD WAS IT GOOD!!! First, the smell is just heavenly. The tops came out puffy, the edges were crunchy, and the bottoms (as my husband said repeatedly) were "caramelized just right." Now, the insides were soft--I understand why some would say "soggy"--but we agreed that you have to think of this dish as being akin to a bread pudding. My husband just couldn't stop talking about how nicely all the different textures came together. He also thought the cardamom was "really neat". All this from a guy who doesn't usually like rich, sweet, starchy things. I agree that this dish is way too rich for every day or even every weekend. Nonetheless, we're already trying to think of whom to invite to brunch so that we can have this again.

I have made this several times, including for a friend's wedding shower brunch. It has generally turned out well, though once it cooked unevenly. Perhaps I overcooked it? Still, it has been very popular with our guests, and I will continue to make it. Too rich everyday breakfasts.

It smelled great, looked great, it was soggy and the texture was such that only 1 of my guests would consume it. I followed the recipe, but there was just too much custard.

Rating: 4
This is very good. I pretty much followed the recipe but added a little cinnamon in additon to the cardamom and it turned out well. I made the citrus syrup too and it is good. I offered both maple syrup and the citrus syrup. Challah works well for this.

I made this exactly as printed, except I added a bit of grand marnier to the milk mixture. I thought there was not enough liquid, but the next day when I baked it, it came out great. Moist and delicious. It was perfect for brunch.

I made this again three years later. I used 2 cups of half and half rather than milk and heavy cream, I also used five whole eggs and one yolk. Once again this dish got rave reviews and I hope I wont wait three years to make it. This time I made the citrus sauce and used more rind and less corn syrup. It too was well received by every one.

Excellent, refreshing take on french toast! Marmalade and cardamom are wonderful complements. I also added a splash of vanilla and 2 TBs grand marnier. I used Challah rolls instead of egg bread. In the morning, the bread had soaked up all the custard so I made a second batch and poured it over just before putting it in the oven. Regular maple syrup is perfect with it; no need to make citrus stuff if you are short on time.

I made this with apricot jam, and found it too sweet and a bit too messy. Also, the toast cooked unevenly - perhaps I used the wrong pan, or my oven temp. was a little off.

Rating: 3
The recipe was very easy to follow and adaptable for a large crowd. I think a thicker, heartier bread may work better than the egg or similar less dense breads. Had to bake it a bit longer than the recipe states to obtain the right crispness. The citrus syrup was excellent but only a little bit was needed; I'd cut the recipe in half. A true crowd pleaser!

I used challah bread and peach preserves, cut the sugar in half and eliminated the orange and lemon rind-- cardamom definitely yummy. added cinnamon. I was worried it would be soggy but it came out both easy to cut up with a plastic fork at a party, but also browned and crisp on edges like french toast should be. I used more bread than called for in order to fill the pan and was wondering if I should have made more egg/cream sauce...perhaps I will try increasing sauce by 50%, but it was very good as is, plenty of compliments. I would also like to try serving it with the peach compote listed with another, french toast recipe on the site (but not an overnight recipe.) Not sure if the compote would make things too soggy-- but could be added later.

I made this for a May Breakfast, and everyone liked it, and requested the recipe. It was pretty easy to make. I couldn't find egg bread either, so I used Challah, cutting thick slices. I didn't have cardamom, so I used a little nutmeg, cinnamon, and ginger. I soaked the bread overnight, which was fine, and while cooking, the french toast puffed up beautifully, but then deflated shortly after I took it from the oven. I made the syrup, but I didn't use it, as syrup made from corn syrup seems gross. I might try to find a lighter, thinner citrus sauce elsewhere to go with it.

I make this dish often, and it is always a huge success. I add Grand Marinier to the egg mixture . . .yum! Frequently I do without the citrus syrup and serve it with pure maple syrup.

This is great! We used a lot more marmalade and a little more bread but otherwise followed the recipe. It was good do-ahead dish and could handle sitting around after it was cooked. The syrup was wonderful, too--I expected it to be a bit too much but it was perfect.

The flavoring was good, but the french toast itself was NOT impressive, maybe due to the quality of the bread--?? I don't know, but it wasn't worth the time or calories.

I've made this recipe several times with modifications and LOVE it! I couldn't find egg bread but the recipe worked great with an Italian/French bread that is not pre-sliced. I prefer apricot jam - so used it instead of the orange marmelade. Also used an apricot syrup. Will definitely make it again and again. I'll keep looking for egg bread!

This is great for when you have guests sleeping over--just rise early and pop it into the oven and let them awake with the aromas. Although, it took more prep time the night before than I would have liked. The cardamom does add flare to the traditional french toast. I liked that there was no frying slice after slice of bread.

Made this dish as part of a brunch buffet for 15. This was my first attempt at entertaining and it was a smash hit. Everyone loved it and was impressed. Did the prep work the night before and then baked it just before the guests arrived -- this and the orange sauce made the house smell great!

Everyone I have ever made this for asks for the recipe; it's a great simple do-ahead brunch dish. I have substituted whole milk for the cream with good results. I don't use nearly as much marmalade as the recipe calls for but enough to get the orange flavor across. I haven't served this with the citus syrup -- maple syrup tastes great with it. Make this french toast and you won't need to try another recipe ever again!!

Wonderful! I made this for the office and several people told me that it was the best french toast they'd ever had. Also very easy to make-can prepare the night before and cook the next morning.

This was a terrific brunch dish, but too rich to have for an early breakfast. The syrup had far more flavor than I would have expected. It was easy to make and looked impressive - a combination I like!

I made this for a buffet brunch and it was a huge success. The leftovers were also great for several days. I doubled the recipe, added a shot of Grand Marnier to the batter, and sprinkled with walnuts at the end of baking; it all worked out without a hitch. I didn't make the citrus syrup but nobody seemed to miss it.

I made this recipe for a church breakfast. FANTASTIC REVIEWS! When I tried the recipe, I used a harder bread and the cook time was too long. I used Colonial BBQ bread the second time (soft) and watched it close. I also cooked the syrup; more orange flavor. It did quite well in huge pans when left overnight in the fridge before cooking. (We even sold the leftovers!)

Rating: 2
It had great flavor but it seemed too moist after baking. Next time I will cut down the milk/cream/egg mixture a little. I may have put it in the pan wrong. I had put it cut side down and with the crust side up. It over lapped about half way over the next piece. I would like to have suggestions from others how they placed it.

Served this recipe to 6 couples for breakfast. Used Texas toast instead of egg bread and prepared the night before, then baked in the morning. It was wonderful! Of course the cardamom is expensive but well worth it. Will make this again. Soon!

I made this for brunch while visiting friends at their cabin. Despite limited kitchen facilities, this dish was easy to prepare in advance and loved by everyone. I substituted Texas toast for the egg bread and it worked great. I used a course ground cardamom that was very fragrant while baking, and next time I make it I will add slightly more then the recipe calls for. An excellent compliment to this dish was canadian bacon with a dijon mustard sauce.

I made this and froze the remainder to see how it froze. It was great; you couldn't even tell it had been frozen. I changed the recipe somewhat. I like berries more than oranges, so I used bluberry jam instead of orange marmalade. I did not make the citrus syrup. I left out the orange and lemon zest and left out cardamom and added nutmeg. I think the most important ingredient in this is the egg bread.
