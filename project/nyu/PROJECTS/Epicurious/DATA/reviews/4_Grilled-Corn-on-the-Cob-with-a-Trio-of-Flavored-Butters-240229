The Chili Butter was quite good - the only change I made was instead of using 1 tsp. of sweet chile powder, I used a mixture I had on hand that involved chile and cinnamon which gave the butter a very nice depth of flavor. For the Sun-dried Tomato Butter, I substituted the same amount (2 oz.) of prepared sun-dried tomato paste for the rehydrated tomatoes, which had a little olive oil and garlic in it. Both were scrumptious on sweet corn today, and we enjoyed a snack later on of popcorn using the Chili Butter. Excellent!

WOW. The chili butter was so phenomenal that my guests and I kept looking for other things to eat it on - and we found that it's pretty darn good on anything. If you have left overs, try putting it on bread, then grilling until golden and crispy. Delicious.

Simple and easy to prepare - got a lot of compliments. Guests liked the tomato/basil butter the best.
