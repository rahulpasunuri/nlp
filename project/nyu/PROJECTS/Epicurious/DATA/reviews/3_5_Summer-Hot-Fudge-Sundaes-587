Excellent Hot Fudge Sauce base. I've also used seedless raspberry preserves...which happens to be our favorite (without the rum). Also, if making with marmalade: we don't usually have rum, and have used Cointreau with success.

It looked spectacular in balloon glasses when I brought it to the table and everyone oo'd and ahh'd. There were no other comments of any kind after that, which I took to mean that my guests were underwhelmed. The minute the hot chocolate hits the ice cream, it is cold, and I couldn't taste either the orange or the rum flavors. It was kind of a lot of work for what was ultimately an ordinary-tasting dessert.

Everyone loved it. I also used less brown sugar because the marmalade was very sweet, and vanilla frozen yogurt was perfect!

Used a white cuban rum which worked out very well. Also used ~2/3 cups of brown sugar. Quite tasty. Unsweetened chocolate works just fine - no need for sweetened chocolate.

Wonderful in the Summer and Winter.
