This turned out great, and it was so easy! What a nice change of pace for peas.

Made it according to the recipe and it was quite tasty. Served it with a saffron risotto and a triple shrimp dinner. Guest and wife loved it. Will use it for pot lucks as it has just enough "twist" to make folks ask about it.
