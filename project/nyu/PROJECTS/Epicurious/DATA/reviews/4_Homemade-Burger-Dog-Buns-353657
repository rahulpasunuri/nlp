Made these with 2% milk and quick rise yeast and really enjoyed the results. Since they are so good with 2% milkfat, like another reviewer, I can't imagine why you'd need more milk fat. As is, they are tender inside with a dense chewy crust. Definitely worth the extra work. Takes burgers to a whole new level.

These were yummy, I made the buns to go with BBQ and everyone loved them. I didn't rate the recipe because I changed it a fair amount. I used only 2% milk instead of whole or cream, and I used 2.5 cups of whole wheat flour and 2.5 cups of all-purpose. Because of these changes, my baking time was closer to 15 minutes, and they were probably a bit drier than they should have been. Nonetheless, they were still quite good and I'll definitely make them again.

Good rolls, nice texture. Sprinkled the tops with coarse salt in addition to seeds, that added a lot of flavor. I made them very small for sliders. Even HALF the recipe made 16 slider rolls!

These are wonderful. I made mini buns for sliders and am delighted with the result.

This recipe works well even with the modifications I made. I can't fathom using a cup of heavy cream (yikes! especially when you load a burger!), so I did 1/2 cup of half-and-half and the rest was just more whole milk. For the flour, I subbed two cups with whole wheat. I only keep quick-rise yeast, so they didn't rise like I expected  no problem, I just made sliders instead! I definitely saved this one to my recipe box.

These hamburger buns are simply delicious. My family and I adore them. I have been looking for a recipe for rolls or buns that has a tender crust and that is more substantial than the regular supermarket buns, and had almost given up. Every other recipe that I have tried was just not right, dense or very crusty, or not tender enough. But this recipe, is amazing. I have made them for the fifth time in two weeks!!! My family loves them, they use them to make all sorts of sandwiches and not just burgers. I would recommend them to everyone. I even tried substituting two cups of all-purpose flour with two cups sifted whole wheat flour and it was still tender and delicious.

This is one of the best, actaully the best recipe i have found for hamburger buns. I followed the recipe in total except that I added about 2 cups of diced carmelized onions, mixed with thyme. It was a serious hit. Mu husband ate 3 right away. these also last a good week if they are put in the fridge, then it can be toasted for burgers. I have saved this recipe and will use it for many moons to come. Thanks Epicurious!

I made theses rolls and they were delicious. I followed the recipe except I substituted fat free half and half for the heavy cream.I also put the dough in the bread machine as I was going to be out all day They are definatly best the day they are made. My daughters friend ate 4 rolls. I would make these again.

I have been making the beautiful burger buns from KA for years. The best way I have found to shape is to weigh the dough & then form by pulling the dough over & under the ball in hand & kinda top knotting on the bottom, set that side down, 4 per 1/2 sheet pan for airflow when baking, spray the tops lightly with cooking spray, lay plastic wrap on top & as they rise they will flatten because of the wrap but won't stick & it gives a nice all over brown on top. I haven't tried this recipe yet but plan to.

These were great but you need to go back to the drawing board as far as shaping the hot dog rolls goes. I made them for lobster rolls, following the instructions, and they were too round to top-split and grill on the sides. Next time I will try fitting 12 instead of 8 buns in each 13 x 9 baking pan, using half the recipe in each pan.

I haven't tried this recipe. I clicked on the link just to see how this recipe compares to the one I currently use for hotdog/hambuger buns. A lot of heavy cream in this one. B/c of that I am adding the link for the delicious hot dog/hamburger recipe I found on the web some time ago in case anyone wants a less rich dough (the other one is still rich and tender, a little sweet, but not as much fat). http://rosas-yummy-yums.blogspot.com/2006/10/world-bread-day-2006-hamburger-buns.html

I made these tonight and they weren't great. the bottoms were hard and they were a little dense. it was a chilly day here so they did not rise enough I believe. I also did not measure the temperature of the milk/cream before adding it and it may have been too hot for the yeast. I don't want to say the recipe is bad but mine did not turn out very good! I usually make brioche and shape into balls for buns but thought I would give this a try. I will try again...

Made this today for lunch with home the ultimate burger, ketchup, mustard and relish (all on the same page in the print issue). I gotta tell you this was wonderful. The best burger I have ever had .... better than Carl's Jr. and just as messy. Cut the circles about 3 1/2 inches and make them 3/4 inch thick for the second rising. I also added 100g of flax seed ... yummy

These were so easy and so delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, making the New England style hot dog buns. I don't like hot dogs, but they were definitely worth eating in these buns. Hubby only wanted one until he tasted it (he ate FOUR!). Next time I will fill the hot dog buns with lobster...

Made these Monday night after the dog ate the store bought ones on the counter. Obviously, they were better than store bought . . . but in their own right, they were great. Light, a touch sweet and super easy. I had more than enough for three baking sheets, which meant I re-rolled the dough more than once. Frankly, I couldn't see or taste a difference between those made from one roll out and those made from three. These are also worth making just because everyone thinks you're a genius because you did! I don't foresee ever buying store buns again.
