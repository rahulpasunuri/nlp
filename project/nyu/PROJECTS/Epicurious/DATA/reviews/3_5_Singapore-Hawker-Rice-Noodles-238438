If you have traveled in Southeast Asia and enjoyed the food, you will love this recipe. Im blessed to live in Los Angeles, so its easy to find an Indonesian food store nearby. But, following the suggestions of some of the other reviewers, you can make this with what you find at any well stocked supermarket. My wife doesnt eat pork, so I followed one reviewers advice and substituted chicken apple sausage for the Chinese sweet sausage. It worked out wonderfully. I was able to use Ketjap manis (Indonesian sweet soy sauce), but I believe one reviewers suggestion to mix regular soy sauce and a little honey would work as well. Even easier might be mixing regular soy sauce with light brown sugar to the consistency of room temperature ketchup. I used the sambal oelak because I found it and wanted to try it. Next time Ill use the recipes alternative Sriracha, which you can buy in any supermarket, because it is every bit as flavorful but less salty. I was lucky to find fresh kway teow, which are about one-inch wide, flat, rice noodles. If you can find them, use them. But I think another reviewers substitution of similar dried noodles, boiled before adding them, would work as well. Unlike one reviewer, I did not find this to be anything like Pad Thai, and would not make it with that expectation. Contrary to the recipe, you do not need any special, adjustable blade slicer to make this dish (I doubt most Singapore street noodle hawkers have one). A sharp chefs knife works just fine. This was a big hit in my house.

This was very good and worth making again, but it was not exceptional. By the time I tweaked this enough to make it really great, I had something very much like pad thai. When made according to the recipe, it lacked that real flavor punch that I was expecting. I ended up adding a little salt, some ground peanuts and some fish sauce. It was really tasty then, but as I said, very much like pad thai. It did require A LOT of prep. This took a couple hours to get to the table, and I work pretty fast. Next time I will start chopping a day in advance

I liked this recipe a lot, although I did amend it somewhat. didn't add sausages, but instead added chicken, and I would have thrown in some prawns as well if I had them. Just add a bit more of soya sauce, sprinkled with lotsa fresh coriander , top with chopped peanuts and squirt with fresh lime juice just before serving. and it is wonderful

This was really quite tasty. I made some substitutions: couldn't find the ketjap so I used regular soy sauce with a teaspoon of honey added. Also, dried rice noodles worked fine after I cooked them al dente first and finished them in the sauce. Last, and I admit this is weird, this was a surprisingly good application for plain old American chicken-apple sausage (I had some Aidells sausage from Costco hanging around and figured, what the heck). Anyway, long on prep but easy and good, with a lot of flavor.

This was good but not as good as the ingredient list might predict. I made it with shrimp instead of chicken.

I fell in love with street food while in the orient. this recipe was very close to what I remember and I had no problem finding all the ingredients at our local oriental market. The only down side is all the chopping, but it is worth it.
