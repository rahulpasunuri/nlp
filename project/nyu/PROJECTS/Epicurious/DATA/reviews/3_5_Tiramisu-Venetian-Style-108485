I made this for a summer party - it was delicious but began to melt within minutes of putting it out on the table. I think I need to freeze this, not just refrigerate it - and add more cookies to the bottom on the dish to soak up the liquids.

The simplicity of this recipe reminds me of the great food my Aunt Amelia and Grandma Giovanna cooked. They could take a few ingredients and make fantastic meals - and over wood-burning stoves!

(Girls, girls...! It's only food.) I thought it made a pleasantly old-fashioned and moreish dish.

It amuses me to see when people write scathing reviews of food. It's like they are trying to say that they are better or more educated than other reviewers or the person who submitted the recipe. The whole TRUE Italian comment, are there FALSE Italians out there? I don't think so! It's time for some people to grow up!

Actually NOT a great summer dish, as eggs will spoil more quickly, TRUE Italians would never make this when its hot, guests may raise an eyebrow or two...
