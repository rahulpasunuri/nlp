I had lamb chops and feta, but no Banyuls vinegar or dried cherries, so I put the feta over the chops as in the recipe, but used the mushroom sauce from the 1993 LAMB CHOPS WITH MUSHROOM WINE SAUCE. I was concerned the feta would make the sauce gummy, but it did not. Very good! The feta melds wonderfully with the lamb, making a huge difference. I had French feta from a Middle Eastern market that was very creamy and made for a fabulous sauce. We'll be using good feta with lamb from now on.

This was simple and delicious. The lamb was perfectly cooked; I had Banyuls vinegar on hand that I had purchased at Williams Sonoma. My husband, who doesn't usually care for fruit sauces, loved it. I am also surprised about the low rating.

I'm surprised at the low rating. I thought this was simple and delicious and my family loved it. I substituted fig balsamic vinegar, as my oenophile husband told me that Banyuls was a fortified wine, which is quite sweet, and I thought the fig balsamic vinegar would supply the sweet and sour taste of the Banyuls. It's also more readily available. I cut down on the olive oil and didn't even use the feta. Because of the other cook's smoke alarm (!), I put an aluminum foil tent over it until the last few minutes of cooking. It's now my favorite lamb recipe!

I, too, had trouble finding Banyuls vinegar, so I used Balsamic and the taste was still incredible. The only downside was that the lamd/oil made quite a mess in my oven, setting off the smoke detectors. But the taste was worth the trouble!

My rating would be 3-1/2 stars if that were possible. Making this was a fairly last minute decision; I didn't have time to look for Banyuls vinegar locally but I did a Google search and found a number of places that sell it; will probably order some if I can't find it in town. I used a base of red wine vinegar and added smaller amounts of raspberry and sherry vinegars and a dab of balsamic to make the sauce, which worked out quite well. Both my husband and I thought the sauce was delicous and would go well with other roasted lamb or beef dishes. I liked the Feta but might try fresh goat cheese next time. Went great with a 1988 Leoville Barton.

To the Cook from G from Hoboken Thank you.

Banyuls Vinegar is made from a delicious dessert wine of the same name (Banyuls). You can probably use a good balsamic vinegar as a sub.

What is Banyul's Vinegar and if it is a brand that is unavailable in Canada, what can I substitute?
