Wonderful flavor. I rolled the dough extra thin and folded it into quaters prior to cutting out pumpkin shapes with a cookie cutter. They had the flakiness of biscuits. They were a big hit for a school birthday treat.

Excellent. Great flavor. I did omit the honey in the glaze. Will definitely make again!

Good, but don't have, as another reviewer said, a biscuit texture. My kids loved them (and they're picky), but I had trouble with them getting too dark before being completely finished in the middle; perhaps I was too liberal w/ the glazing...

Mmmmm... 3.5 forks. Smells great when in the oven, too. I love the honey-cream glaze! FYI, these have the texture of muffins, not biscuits.

Very good, easy. I would add more walnuts. (1- 1/2 cups.)
