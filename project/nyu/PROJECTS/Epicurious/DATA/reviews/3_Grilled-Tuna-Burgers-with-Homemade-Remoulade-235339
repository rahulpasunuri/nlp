I made the remoulade to accompany crabcakes. I'm not sure what makes a remoulade "traditional New Orleans," but this is very good. I didn't have anchovy paste, so took an idea from another recipe and used tomato paste plus Tabasco sauce instead.

This recipe was great if you are a tuna lover-my husband prefers a more subtle remoulade although I like the pungent flavor of this one-very easy for a weekday dinner.

So-so. At $25/pound, not worth it for a mediocre meal.
