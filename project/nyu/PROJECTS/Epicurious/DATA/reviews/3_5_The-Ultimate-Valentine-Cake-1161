I have made this cake/lid several times. It is really a spectacular presentation cake. The recipients of this cake were very appreciative of the time/effort I took to make this beautiful cake for them. PS: I meant to rate it "four forks". Kay Schroeder

This is one of those "labor of love" types of things that is no problem to make for a loved one or a special occasion, but too time consuming and expensive to make "just because I feel like baking." All of the ingredients combined will cost you at least $50! Another review had some good advice that I will repeat here: If you plan to make this for Valentine's day, buy your chocolate early! Berries and chocolate will be more expensive at this time! For the framboise liqueur and/or Grand Marnier, I had a friend that works at a bar fill some of those 99 cent shampoo bottles for me. This is truly a magnificent looking cake, but I agree that the cake itself needs to be served on a "lake" of the compote in order to not seem so dry. I want to make this cake for my boyfriend, I'll try the marzipan roses that another reviewer suggested next time!

I have baked this cake numerous times and it truly is a showstopper.

Fantastic cake ! I surprised my girlfriend and myself by finishing the cake by Valentines Day. NOT a cake that you can finish in an afternoon. Plan on more chocolate than the recipe calls for. You will burn/waste some if this is your first time using melted chocolate. All in all for my first cake it turned out amazing. Only problem is she will want you to make it again. -WIll

I have made this cake about 6 times. I have changed it up after each attempt. I use praline liquer because I like it. I make the cake and split it in half and put the compote between the layers. I only use raspberries it really makes the chocolate pop. I also put frozen raspberries in the cake batter. I never follow a recipe for long but this is my favorite romantic dinner desert recipe (when modified).

I agree with previous reviewers - the cake comes out too dry and heavy. Soaking in the compote and/or Amaretto helps. Also, I covered the top of the cake with a thin layer of marzipan and added marzipan roses (easy to make, find out how at www.odense.com). The icing and the lid were the best part. Will make this again, but only with a different type of dough.

This cake is VERY time consuming. I thought it was definitely worth it though. Textures and flavors were decadently rich and the berries were a perfect compliment. I made the compote but foud it too booze-ey so did not serve. Plan on 4 hours of active time and start the night before. I made it for a dinner party and made the cake and icing the night before and assembled the day of the party. It was an enormous hit and the presentation was marvelous. I did not have a problem with the cake being too dry. I also served it with extra icing which I warmed up so that may have helped. I go tthe chocolate lid to room temp and sliced a triangle to serve w/ each peice. I also made a round cake (no heart pan). In any case everyone raved and it may have to be an annual tradition, even if it is time consuming. Very impressive.

I didn't have the bottomless pan, and I'm quite thankful: it seems to add much more work than is necessary. I used two heart-shaped 9"x 1" pans (all I had). For the lid, I oiled the pan as directed, and it popped right out when done setting. For the batter, I traced & cut out parchment to line the bottom of each pan (i used two because of their height, saving me another step: cutting the cake in half!), greased & floured the edges and the cake popped right out when cooled. I was apprehensive to bake as directed because so many reviews said the cake was dry. I baked for only 30-35 minutes, deleting the 2nd step of covering with foil and or baking 20 minutes longer. I did place a cookie sheet on the lower rack to deflect some of the heat. That was it. The cake turned out very moist. The only ingredient change I think I'd make is using white chocolate for the frosting (only because I like it better!). Prepare to spend at LEAST $50 for ingredients, including the liqueur.

I agree with the others -- this has a really nice presentation but the cake itself is dry and plain. You may want to just use a package to make an ordinary white cake, then frost the sides and put the decorative lid on it with the strawberries. Or, I'm sure you can find any number of good cake recipes; the only thiing unique about this is the presentation so there is no reason that you can't use a different basic cake. I also didn't have a heart-shaped springform so I just used a normal circular springform. I cut off one section a bit to a flat side, did the same to the lid, and attached them along that side.

If you're going for presentation, and have 5 hours to kill, this is....WOW! When it comes to taste however, it falls horribly short. The cake itself is dry and heavy and the best way to eat it is to really drench it in the berry compote. Something that looks this good should taste equally good - kind of a shame.

I don't think I'll ever have the energy to make this cake again. The frosting and heart lid are awesome, however, the cake wasn't very good, too dry! I used my heart pan with a bottom and it worked fine. Next time I'll make a chocolate heart mold and fill it up with strawberries dipped in the frosting! (a lot less work!)

It makes a dense and beautiful cake. I must say though that this was a very expensive cake to make as the berries and chocolate required are very expensive in the month of February.

This was the best presentation cake I have ever prepared. I couldn't get more compliments from family and friends, and everyone is asking for the recipe!! Try it for yourself, and I know you will feel the same way!

Must be a 4 sounds like it. Someone should submit a picture in case I never try this at home. Maybe next year. I just don't think I can pull it off this year.

It is a great after supper cake. I love when I make it for anything.

This is a horrible recipe; I made one and took it to work and now the marriage proposals won't stop. This recipe is downright dangerous - serve only to those you love or would like to love. This dessert is a showstopper.

What a sensational presentation! My inlaws now call me the "Martha Stewart" of the family. The only change I would suggest is to flip the cake upside down so there is a flat surface facing up before icing. A rounded top caused the berries to fall over the sides and made lid placement tough.

This cake was great. The presentation alone gave me praise all night long. People thought it was from a bakery. I will definitely make it again and I highly recommend using Lindt Chocolate.
