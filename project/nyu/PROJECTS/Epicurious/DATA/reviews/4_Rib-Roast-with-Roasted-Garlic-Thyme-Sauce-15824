This has been the favorite for everyone I've made it for, including picky kids. It's often requested and the cooking instructions are absolutely perfect. If only it wasn't such an expensive cut of meat.

Great recipe overall. Used a cuisinart to get the rub into a paste so it would best adhere to the roast. The cooking temperature is way off though. 475 degrees is nearly a broil, and an unseasoned chef will likely burn the the roast at 30 minutes at this temperature. 425 for 30 minutes will give it the pseudo-sear you're looking for then a reduction to 325, slow and low, until 110/115 internal temperature using a good digital meat thermometer.

I needed a great rub for my husband's Birthday dinner and this came through for me beautifully I cooked mine on the rotisserie. I would definately use it again.

was told this Christmas that my Grandmother-in-law would've been impressed with this gravy. (I never met her, but have heard she was hard to please.) Also, for a fine old southern cook to have approved of cooking of a yankee granddaughter-in-law . . . that's pretty cool. This roast & gravy is a "new" holiday tradition my in-laws now ask specifically about ("You're cooking the rib-roast again this year, RIGHT?"). I do all the prep/chopping/measuring work of it earlier in the day. I've also taken to writing myself a specific timeline checklist with the tasks of making the gravy and other last minute preparations. They are easy to follow and I can cross them out as I finish them. It helps me focus and not feel distracted & frazzled as guests arrive, hang out in the kitchen and start drinking the wine. My husband was really impressed this year not only with the food, but how calm & peaceful I was because of this. Merry Christmas to all! Your family & friends will certainly feel loved if you make this!

Love, love, love this recipe! I have been making this every Christmas for the last 10 years. My family always looks forward to it and insist on having this instead of ham every year. By far the best Prime Rib. Nice to know that I can make the best Prime Rib that beats restaurant at home.

This sauce is an excellent standby for our house. I have made it many times without the rib roast --- it is excellent with grilled pork or lamb! I have found on occasion the some types of wine make a more bitter tasting sauce, in this case I add a little brown sugar to even the taste. Always a winner!

This was our choice for Christmas Dinner. We were not wild about the sauce made with beef broth. It was too salty, and took forever to cook down. The rib roast was excellent.

This dish was amazing! I roasted it for the half hour @ 475, but then turned the oven to 200 for another hour +, to perfection. The sauce was delicious. I received many compliments and will absolutely be making this again. Much easier than I expected as well, which is a big bonus, especially at this time of year. Make this dish, you won't regret it!

I followed the cooking temperature recommendations in the original recipe. The roast looked fabulous, and was quite tasty. I cooked it to an internal temperature of 118 degrees F, and found the outer portion of the roast to be well done, while the center was rare. Really rare - bloody, even. I read some other reviews that called for lowering both the searing temp as well as the cooking temp. Next time I will lower the searing temp to 450, but will leave the cooking temp at the recommended 375, and will probably cook it to an internal temp of 120 to keep the roast between rare and med rare. The sauce was spectacular, as was the overall flavor and texture of the roast.

My husband went to Costco to pick up toilet paper and came home with a 6.7 lb standing rib roast. I rolled my eyes when I saw the hunk of cow in the 'fridge. He had no idea that a preparing standing rib roast was big deal and that a 6.7 lb standing rib roast could feed a small army. I used this recipe and it was a stunning success. It may be one of the best things I've made in my entire life. And the sauce - wow!!!!!! Based on the reviews, I did 25 minutes at 500 degrees and then slow roasted at 200 until the internal temperature read 120 degrees. I like my meat rare and the center was definitely rare. Even the end pieces were medium rare. So, if you like your meat a tad more cooked, you might leave the roast in the oven until the internal thermometer reads 125. All in all, a huge hit and my husband feels totally vindicated. :-)

I have done this roast twice. Today, will be my third time. I am starting with the sauce today, as I believe that it takes too much time if you are taking the roast out of the oven when your guests arrive and then start with the sauce. The roast and sauce are fantastic. The flavor and the presentation outstanding... My guests went for seconds and thirds... I also made holes on the roast and stuffed them with a paste made of garlic/salt and thyme. YuM! I look forward to eating this roast tomorrow!!

Rating: 4
Delicious flavors. Followed recipe exactly, but reduced searing temperature to 450° and roasted at 350°. I followed advice of LGB1 from ATL.,GA to increase meat temperature to 130° in order to result in "medium" temperature. This was a mistake, as the temperature of the roast rose well above that as it rested! The meat was still delicious, but not as pink in the middle as I desired. Next time I will use the recommendation of el_boom from New York City for only increasing it to 120°. Also, a bit of useful information about the demi-glace...if you have trouble finding it in your area, Williams Sonoma sells a jarred demi-glace concentrate. Directions for reconstituting it are not included, but my per inquiry, the ratio is 1 to 10 (6 Tbsp. to 1 quart water). After oepning, it keeps 6 months in refrigerator (or may be frozen). Also, "mise en place" the ingredients for the sauce to reduce hectic activity prior to plating. The Sautéed Haricots Verts, Red Bell Peppers, and Pine Nuts and the Horseradish Mashed Potatoes (both from this website) were good choices for sides.

We made this dish on Christmas eve and it was truly outstanding. We used a 5-6lb roast (3 ribs I think) and we did make a few variations based on available ingredients - we had no fresh thyme; we added ground dried mushrooms to the rub before cooking; and we added sauteed mushrooms to the sauce which I thought were a great addition. (We took the mushroom ideas from another Epicurious standing rib roast recipe ("two mushroom sauce"). I would definitely add the mushrooms to the sauce again. The roast ended up resting for about an hour by the time we finished making the sauce and it was perfect. The meat and sauce were so good I can't remember much about the sides! (Roasted fingerling potatoes and asparagus I think.) A Christmas highlight. "The best sauce ever tasted" according to some. Will definitely make again. Yum.

My family thought the sauce overly rich & masked the flavor of the prime rib roast. Peeling roasted garlic takes too long, so I scraped a spoon through the roasted garlic heads & that quickly removed the garlic from the peels. Too bad the sauce takes so long to make.

THIS WAS OUTSTANDING! I bought an organic 6 pound standing rib roast and the only thing I changed was the amount of beef broth used. I used 2 cups,instead of 4, as suggested by another reviewer, and it was perfect. My roast served 4 adults and 2 kids with leftovers for two more servings. The sauce was just as delicious as the meat and using fresh thyme is critical. Don't skimp. YOU MUST TRY THIS! I served this with the Horseradish Mashed Potatoes with Caramelized Onions from this same site. YUM!

This was our first time to make a prime rib roast and it turned out perfect (and we usually screw up most things in the kitchen!)....we made a 15-pounder for Christmas dinner which served 15 guests with some leftovers. We used the demi-glaze option to simplify the sauce - even though it was more $$$, I do beleive it saved us some grief. The sauce really tasted like something from a 5-star resturant but i have to be honest, I think we just prefer regular old Au Jus and horseradish with prime rib...but I will definitely find somthing to put that sauce on - it was something to be proud of! I did not think I was capable of making something that tasted so sophisticated.

I rarely give four forks, delicious is usually good enough, but this time I am giving four forks because this recipe is very simple and just delicious. I had three very good cooks at my dinner table and other guests accustomed to very good food and everyone just raved about the meal. I had a 12.5 lb five rib roast and there was enough gravy using this recipe. I think it will become the Christmas dinner family recipe by popular demand. I used a Bourdeaux for the wine in the gravy and low salt canned beef broth.

The recipe was easy to follow and we served this at Easter~everyone loved it. I was disappointed it was cooked to medium and some of us would have liked it a little more rare. The thyme sauce was good. We got caught up in things and I forgot the wine addition so maybe that was what was lacking. I may try another method but will always come back to this. When one cooks the meal sometimes it's not as appealing until the next day...at least in my case.

Made this for Easter Dinner - Hate lamb - Ordered meat from butcher shop @ Wegmans's - they cut off the bone and trimmed the meat then tied the bones back on - great taste. My husband (son of a butcher) said it was the best prime rib he ever ate. Did not do the butter flour thing for gravy - just flour and water. the gravy was superb! YUMMY!

I add a little touch. I combined thime, salt and pepper with flower. Slivered garlic and inserted then into the roast. Then browned the roast in a very hot roasting pan, then roasted at 200 to a internal temp of 120. Most important letting it rest for 30 minutes.

This was the first roast that I've made and it turned out fabulously. I followed advice from Spicer, CO by starting it off at 500 first, then lowered to 250 and slow cooked it.

This is an elegant, delcious change from typical brown gravy. Have made it twice using plain ol' beef stock and dried thyme, and it turned out fabulous both times. We are a small family, and cook small roasts. I do the "400 for 25 minutes then 250 for the rest of the time" method, and it works nicely, even with cheaper cuts of meat. This recipe is a keeper.

This was good, but in my opinion the Prime Rib with Cabernet Jus (found on this site) is better. Perhaps it was the demiglace I used, but the sauce was very thin. I would add more garlic next time.

I grew up on a cattle ranch in CO, and I have some familiarity with beef. When directions say to roast a beef at 325-375 degrees, they are playing it safe. You have lots of steady control over the cooking, and few surprises. However, many professional chefs -- or beef lovers -- prefer to preheat the oven to 500 degrees, put in the roast, then immediately lower it to 200 or so for several hours. This "sears" the beef, in effect; fairly efficiently, since most home cooks would have trouble evenly searing a large rib roast. This method produces a perfect roast, in my opinion, with a bit of Medium Well - Well on the outside, and Rare in the very interior, with lots of Medium rare for everyone else. Love this preparation, even garlic lovers will like it. Much better with FRESH thyme. Serve with a good Cab, or big Burgundy.

My first prime rib ever..Confusing when Julia Child says 325, the best recipe suggests a slow cook at 200 and this recipe starts off over 400 degrees. I went somewhere in the middle and carefully monitored. I was happy with the results.. AND THE SAUCE.. oh the sauce! Makes you want to lick your plate when no one is looking.

Instant classic. This was the second year in a row I made this for the holidays. The only thing I did different was to add 4 tb drippings to the Au Jus including the called for 2 tb. The cooking time is perfect. I can't understand the Southbury problem. Every person both years I have made this said it was the best Jus they had ever had. I agree with them. I am not that good a cook but I would put this against any chef's product. Be sure to cook Yorkshire Pudding with this recipe becuase the Au Jus compliments it so well. This is a can't miss recipe. The best I have gotten off of this website.

The cooking directions for the meat are perfect. We cooked a 12 pound roast and took it out at 115 degrees as instructed. We let it sit, covered, for about 45 minutes and it reached a temperature of 136 degrees which yielded a perfect medium-doneness. The sauce, however, was disappointing. It lacked salt and overall flavor. Perhaps I did not reduce it enough but I felt it was a lot of time and effort with only a ho-hum result. I was not able to procure demi glace so I used the beef broth and the beurre manie so that may be the deciding factor. It took a very long time to reduce the broth. I will keep this recipe for its perfect cooking instructions, but will continue looking for a different rub/seasoning and sauce.

I made this for Christmas and it was fantastic. Even the non-gravy folks raved about the sauce. I threw in some halved, unpeeled potatoes and quartered onions to roast in the drippings and they were delicious. I couldn't get fresh thyme, so I crushed dried thyme with the garlic and rubbed a lot all over the roast.

First time making this recipe...first time making ANY roast and this was beyond compare fabuloso! It made it quite a happy Chanukah for all...notwithstanding the fact that it was a kosher rib roast -- not usually known for meat quality. This was a total WOW! One small caveat -- make sure your instant read themometer is accurate. One of mine was off and fortunately I decided to try a second one because of the time that had elapsed and I was in the nick of time. You really have to be prompt, because the roast continues to cook a LONG time.

The most important thing to know when cooking this roast is to buy a prime grade cut of meat. Certified Black Angus... it makes all the difference in the world.

This was a first effort for me in preparing a standing rib roast and the results were absolutely delicious, although my oven was a disaster afterwards. Also, I did not end up with anywhere near the amount of fat left in the pan for basting (1/2 cup? Not even close!) and had to add a bit of water and oil to compensate. Next time I'll know better what to request from the butcher. But there WILL be a next time!
