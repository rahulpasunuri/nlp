This is delicious but very dense and rich. I wish it was smaller because the leftovers are hard to resist. My 9" pan is a springform so I double wrapped the outside in foil which made it easy to un-mold but a bit stressful worrying that water might leak into the pan (a few drops but otherwise it was OK). Cutting with a hot knife makes it easier and the slices prettier.

I make this 2-3 times a year for holidays and special occasions. I don't love fruit with chocolate so I skip the raspberry sauce and either serve whole berries on the side or on top with powdered sugar dusted on top or skip berries and cover it with a layer of ganache. People LOVE this cake. Even those who do not like dessert love this. Pretty darn easy and you can make it ahead. My go to and most requested dessert (besides my holiday toffee :)

A truly exception cake! I've made it twice, once with the espresso, the next time I substituted it for coffee liquer. It was superb both times!

The ultimate decadence, but NOT a cake. It was like eating fudge, rich and delicious. Used Scharfenberger 70% chocolate which cut the sweetness. Instead of the sauce, I used high end seedless raspberry preserves which I warmed and thinned with Chambord liqueur, puddled under each piece and garnished with fresh raspberries. Every one LOVED it. To release from pan, went around edge with a sharp knife, inverted onto serving plate and used a hair blower to warm the bottom and release. This is a killer of a dessert

YUM. I made this with 12 oz bittersweet, 4 oz semisweet. Made in cupcake tins, each with parchment on the bottom. Served with a fruit compote and unsweetened whipped cream- only thing I might add next time is a little whisky. Soooo good.

I made this for the second time yesterday in anticipation of our Passover Seder. It is always a hit and the espresso really brings out the chocolate flavor. I only had plain frozen raspeberries (2 10 oz packages) so added 1/2 C sugar and 1/4 C water, brought to a boil, pureed, strained and added 2 tsp Kirsch.

Rating: 4
Fairly quick and easy to make, not to mention amazing tasting. I've made it twice and it came out great both times. The first time I followed the directions exactly. The second time, I used all bittersweet chocolate since it was what I had - not as complex a chocolate flavor though, but still amazing. Also, the second time, I made a chocolate glaze (4 oz bittersweet and 1/2 cup cream). It didn't need it, but it made for an attractive presentation. Also, if you are in a hurry, chill for one hour immediately after baking, then turn over onto a plate, and continue chilling. It can be cold and ready to serve within 3-4 hours.

My husband is sensitive to both wheat and cane sugar, so we make a lot of flourless cakes using maple sugar. This is our new favorite. A simpleton can make it. The texture is truffle-like and the sauce provides the perfect balance of heavy/light and sweet/tart. Here are our modifications: For the sauce, I used three 6-ounce packages of fresh raspberries. I put them in a pan with maybe a half-cup of maple sugar and cooked it until it looked saucy. Then I removed it from the stove, whirled it in the blender, and added maybe a quarter cup of Chambord. I used maple sugar instead of the brown sugar in the cake batter. I didn't do the water bath thing. I used a spring form pan instead. I lined the bottom with buttered parchment paper and buttered the sides. It didn't stick at all. I cut the leftover cake into wedges and put them in individual Ziplocs for the freezer.

A ridiculously easy and scrumptious dessert, but I wouldn't call it a "cake." It's more like a firm mousse: very dense, rich and moist. It was so popular and yummy that I'll have a difficult time finding any other recipe to live up to it. I've also made the "Flourless Chocolate Torte with Blackberry Coulis" from this site, but this one's better, although I do like the Blackberry Coulis from the other.

I did not use espresso, and I think I should have. I just used coffee. This cake... oh this cake.. I made it just because I had a ton of eggs, but noone to really eat it! It went to waste a bit because it is so intensely rich that I couldn't handle all of it. Serve to a crowd after a not-so-heavy dinner. They'll love it.

This was amazingly delicious and received rave reviews from our friends. Perhaps the pound of butter did it? I didn't use the frozen raspberries (no time to go buy) but I did have fresh, so washed them off the night before, sprinkled with a little fine sugar, then covered in container overnight - and voila! nice saucy raspberries for the cake

Rich, decadent and great for parties. Powdered sugar and both raspberry accompaniments (fresh and sauce) are essential. I did have difficulty extracting it from the pan so used a novel way to get it out. inverted the pan over the plate and then, with a dishtowel draped over it, used a hot iron to coax it out. worked like a charm. happy new year.

This one's intense and well worth the work. I made it a springform pan an used the parchment on the bottom and sprayed the sides. It cooled beautifully on top and the sides fell away and the bottom came off cleanly. It definitely feeds 20 because it's so rich you need to slice it thinly. I bought raspberry preserved (without sugar) and warmed it up, added fresh raspberries and served it on the side. We have an espresso machine and I felt the espresso added a lot of depth so I wouldn't recommend doing a work around for this ingredient. Raspberry sorbet works well too. I agree it's a grown up cake but the kids loved it, too.

I was looking for a basic, but delicious chocolate cake to serve with cloudberries at Christmas and this was it. Amazing! This is definitely going in our regular cake rotation. It's so easy and so delicious. I will say though I replaced the semisweet chocolate with a good bittersweet. Definitely use good chocolate with this.

Made this for the first time a couple of years ago at Christmas and it immediately became my go-to recipe for a crowd pleasing desert. Recently tried it without the raspberry and substituted some of the chocolate for terry's dark chocolate orange (and added a hint of orange blossom water to a basic chocolate icing). Also great. This is a great recipe as is and an equally good platform. Fourteen thumbs up.

We made this for Passover seder last night. Added some leftover orange zest to both the batter and the sauce, which we made with frozen whole raspberries, sugar, and raspberry syrup. Was forced to cook it longer than recommended (by about 30 mins.) because of oven and pan issues. Only had time to cool it for 30 mins., so the consistency was much like baked pudding when it was cut into. Everyone liked it, once the requisite mud pie jokes were out of the way. Would love to try making it again when I have the time to cool it properly to see how it's really supposed to turn out.

I made this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit! Very easy to make. I did not have time to cool the cake overnight, only had it in the refrigerator for 4 hours before serving and it was fine. Sprayed oil over parchment paper and the cake came right out. Everyone loved the raspberry sauce, and I also sprinkled fresh raspberries on each dessert. I had extra batter, so also made an additional six individual desserts in cup cake tin. Yummy!

This obviously is a fabulous cake, based on all the reviews. But does anyone out there have a recipe for an espresso chocolate cake like this (rich and dense), but which is not entirely flourless? I want to find one which is a tiny bit more cake-like and not quite so rich in texture. Kind od a cross between this and a fudgy brownie. Anyone?

This was delicious! It's very, very rich. I made it twice - once as recommended and once by pouring the batter into muffin tins. They were the perfect sized portions for individual servings for a dinner party. I, too, topped it with high quality raspberry preserves that I heated in the microwave, drizzled over the top, and added fresh raspberries for garnish. It was a hit! Making it again for Christmas Eve dinner.

I added a bit of vanilla and beat the eggs with an electric mixer before adding them to the chocolate mixture.

Absolutely divine! I'm a novice baker, and this couldn't have been more fool proof. If you like rich, flourless chocolate tortes, then you will love this recipe. It's even better than the tortes I've had in some fancy restaurants. The raspberry sauce is not a necessity. I prefer to garnish the torte with fresh raspberries. If you do make the sauce, one package of frozen raspberries is really adequate (three packages made way too much sauce). I highly recommend this recipe!

I have made many flourless chocolate cakes over the years, and this is by far the best. Just incredible. Melts in your mouth. I halved the recipe (there were only four of us) and used a 7" spring form pan. Because I wasn't sure it would be water-tight, I simply placed in in the oven and on the rack just below, placed the pan of hot water. Worked like a dream. I also made the cake about 6 hours before serving -- warmed it slightly before serving, dusted lightly with cocoa powder and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and fresh raspberries.

I am a chocolate lover but this cake was even too rich for me. The consistency was like a piece of fudge and not cake-like at all. It was very expensive to make since I like to get all the best quality ingredients which included freshly brewed espresso from the local coffee house.

I just made this cake for a Christmas party and it got rave reviews. Like others, I only used two packages of raspberries, and that was plenty. I found I needed to put the pureed raspberries through a strainer twice, and added about a cup of sugar to them, since I couldn't find them in syrup. I used a half cup of espresso (double shot from Starbucks) mixed with a half cup of water, and that was enough to give it the espresso flavor. This cake was scrumptious and everyone commented on how luxurious it tasted. I will definitely make it again. It was pretty easy with a lavish result.

I am allergic to chocolate so this review is based upon the guests this cake has been served to - everyone loves it and says it is sinfully rich and delicious.

This was a good dessert for a dinner party, easily serving 20 people. I used a 10" cake pan instead of a 9" pan. And cut the cake into 24 thin slices... I suggest cutting a 1" to 1.5" hole out of the center before slicing so that you don't end up with a mess in the middle. After slciing, I filled the hole in the middle with a few fresh raspberries, and then put 1 fresh raspberry on each slice. Great presentation. My only negative comment would be that this cake was not quite the creamy consistency or dark, rich flavor I expected. It was rich and chocolatey, but not super DARK. It was creamy, but not absolutely sinful. Final take,... it was easier than expected and well received by guests, so I'll probably amke it a gain sometime. But I'm still on the search for a truly sinful flourless chocolate espresso cake.
