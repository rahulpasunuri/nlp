Good flavor but on the dry side.I made this to accompany Chicken Schnitzel with Capers and Parsley for a very nice dinner.

This dish is improved greatly with chicken or vegetable stock and more seasoning (fresh herbs, parmesan cheese). It's a great basic which can be morphed to compliment a variety of main courses.

This recipe was very tasty with two additions. After sauteeing the mushrooms, all the butter become absorbed, so I added about 1/2 cup of chicken broth. And at the end, you definitely need to add fresh parmesan cheese. Next time I think I'll also add a little white wine.

Although I jumped at the opportunity to incorporate peas into a pasta side... this dish was pretty bland. Next time I will add more garlic and salt, and maybe some onions to the mix.

I would maybe add some cream of mushroon soup, but other than that it was great.

Lovely! Based on the previous reviews, I added more butter when I added the peas and seasoned well with salt and pepper. It still needed "something" after I combined the noodles, so I added a handful of grated Parmesan cheese and it was perfect.

Very bland. Something just doesn't work with this recipe.

This was a good side dish for a roast chicken or veal. Be sure you add enough salt, and I also used some of the cooking water to increase the moisture. Leftovers were good too.

I would be more careful about adding pepper . . . also, IMHO more of a sauce is needed. I would add some butter & possibly lemon juice.
