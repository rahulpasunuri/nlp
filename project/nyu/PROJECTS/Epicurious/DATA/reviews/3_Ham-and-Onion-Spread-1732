I just didn't care for this. It seemed a little like a spam spread. There is one I like better on this site that calls for a little habenero chili in the mix. For my taste, it makes for a more interesting spread.

This recipe was just what I was looking for! It's a great way to use up leftover ham from holdiays. It transforms it into such a delicious spread for sandwiches, or to put on crackers. Travels well for picnics or car trips. If using for an appetizer to go on crackers, just process a bit more than normal in the processor, and call it Ham Pate.

A winner! We had WAY too much ham left over from Christmas dinner, so I had to come up with some creative leftovers. I substituted thickly sliced green onions, and bumped both the celery and onions up to 1/2 cup each. Came out very yummy. Good job!
