Have made this twice for dinner parties and everyone loved it - had to share the recipe, too. Instead of chicken broth I used water and vegetable broth as we don't eat meat although our guests do. Forgot to use mint the first time I made it and used only a little mint the second time because the mint we had looked pretty sad. Am making it again this weekend for another dinner party. Yum!

This was a lovely salad/side dish. I even left out the mint because I couldn't find any at the local store and it still turned out delicious. This goes on my permanent rotation.

I make this all the time in the summer, exactly as the recipe prescribes. We love it with a bbq, particularly, and it's great to bring to a party because the recipe makes a huge bowl. Absolutely love it! A total staple of our seasonal repertoire. :)

this was delicious. i used some cooked couscous that i had on hand and would maybe use less lemon juice this way, but overall...very tasty, light, and satisfying. I am doing a cleanse, too, and I think its quite fine for it.

for sure add salt, make sure that parsley is really diced tiny! We loved it, very easy, fresh and great with grilled chicken and veggies.

I'm away at college and you know how hard it is to get nice,home-made meals. Some recipes are too complicated to make in a college dorm kitchen. This recipe was great and easy enough for me to do with my limited supplies. I followed the recipe except for no mint and more salt. Absolutely hits the spot.

This is an amazing summer salad (yes, I know it's not authentic tabbouleh, and I don't care)! I add more vegetables, parsley and mint than the recipe calls for. I wouldn't tinker with the amount of lemon juice or oil, though - they are the perfect combination and keep the couscous moist and tasty. I agree with other reviewers that it needs some salt. I serve in a wide bowl or on a platter lined with lettuce leaves and top with tons of sliced tomatoes and baby cukes; that way I don't feel like I have to serve a separate vegetable. Great for entertaining (make a day ahead) or to keep in the fridge for lunch.

I have made this several times--it's always good. I add some salt to "wake it up". I agree with another reviewer--make sure the parsley is minced. I like cucumbers and tomatoes to be chunkier. It goes well with grilled meats.

Very fresh! I did the no-cook version (didn't use the broth or the water ... just threw in the couscous with the ingredients overnight). However, next time, I will use the exact amount of oil (and the full 1/2 cup of lemon juice) versus using less oil (as suggested by some other users) because I found it to be a bit dry and the couscous didn't fluff up as much as it could have. I also used cherry tomatoes (per someone's suggestion) so I didn't have to seed - I used about 1 pint. The other nice benefit of the cherry tomatoes is that they're much sweeter and fresher-tasting. I also agree that you want to cut the tomatoes and cucumber small-ish so they balance better with the couscous.

thia is a great summer salad to have on hand in the fridge (if it lasts that long). Good also to serve in romaine leaves to make a pick-up dish

Mmm mmm mm!! Delicious.. my first attempt at tabbouleh and was yummy. Served it with hummus on wraps. A few suggestions: really mince the parsley otherwise it feels too leafy in your mouth, and mince the cuke and tomatoes to pretty small pieces as well for best consistency. I didn't feel like spending $8 for a couple sprigs of mint so I used the basil I had and it was okay, but if you add basil, don't use as much (I used about 1-2tbsp) and make sure it's evenly distributed through the salad cuz a bite of pure basil isn't very good. I love the couscous.. I don't think I'd like the traditional version as much as this one.

Made this for a barbeque and it was a success. Increased the lemon juice, decreased the olive oil and used cherry tomatoes (no deseeding!) and it worked well.

As a lebanese, I do think this recipe has no ralation to taboulah; for taboulah is a main lebanese plate. First of all, we prefer to use borghol and not couscous; another thing is that beside lemon juice, oil, and salt which are a must we only use parsley, mint, tomato and onion.You may like to add a sprinkle of pepper. Finally, taboulah must be eaten fresh that is just after being mixed.

I thought it needed and I added extra lemon juice. There is nothing special about this recipe but it produced the best tabbouleh I have had. I can attribute that only to the high quality, unfiltered, extra virgin olive oil. It produced a rich and elegant result. To the "Cook" on 9/07/01, check the recipe for "Overnight Tabbouleh" for an answer to your question of Peter.

Didn't have parsley & mint so I substituted cilantro & kaffir lime leaves. Aslo added some finely sliced lemon grass. Put in a lot less olive oil. Delicious.

We love this at our house. I made it for a pot luck at work and people were scraping the bowl. I too cut down on the oil but I increase the lemon juice for a nice fresh flavour.

Peter, are you adding the broth and water, or just mixing the dry couscous with the vegetables? As an inherently lazy cook, I love your suggestion, but want more details before trying it!

The secret of making a really good tabbouleh is to not boil the couscous at all. Just mix the couscous with the vegetables and leave in the fridge over night. The vegetable juices "boils" the couscous perfectly and the tabbouleh is much more fresh and tasty this way.

Made 2 weekends in a row; obviously, we loved it as did our guests. The recipe's coming to The Vineyard with us. Easy to make (I made the day before), very refreshing and keeps well. I appreciate the other viewers tips and will try their variations. Thanks

I made after tasting it at a party and asking for the recipe. I added calamata olives, and used less oil like everyone else. I like using couscous instead of bulghur, and cooking it in broth and lemon gave it a nice extra bit of flavor. Very Good!

This was a good recipe to share with people who have never had tabbouleh. Be sure to seed the tomatoes or the dish can get soggy. I also cut the oil in half and added feta cheese. I got rave reviews at a neighborhood picnic.

This is a fabulous recipe. I had already prepared all the vegetables and had my stock boiling in the pot when I realized I had no couscous. I just substituted rice instead and cut way back on the oil. I served it cold with feta cheese crumbled on top and omited the mint. It was a real crowd pleaser, even better the next day.

Very fast to make, and very tasty. I made it on whim and did not have any mint; salad was very nice, with mint it would be different nice salad. I cut the oil way back too.

My husband and I love this!! It is very simple to make and is delicious. We used a little bit more mint than the recipe asked for and half the oil. I also put in 1/2 a cucmber more. It goes very well with falafel or vegetarian sandwiches!!
