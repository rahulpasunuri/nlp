These are delicious but don't be fooled by the wheat germ in the title. These are pretty much cupcakes! :) Delicious! If you're looking for a healthy, everyday type of muffin perhaps keep looking but if you're looking for a moist tasty muffin for special occasions, this is it. Not sure about the other reviewers but this made a sheet of mini muffins and 12 regular muffins for me. The only thing I added was a 1/2 cup of unsweetened coconut.

Very good muffin recipe. I did use flax meal instead of wheat germ since I didn't have any, and I added some walnuts. Everything else stayed the same and they turned out delicious and moist! My husband and boys loved them. I will definitely make these again - and try them with wheat germ next time. I noted that other users said they didn't make 16 muffins, so I just did 12 and they were filled up to the top of the muffin tins, but turned out great.

I don't like banana, but my kids loved these muffins. I added chocolate chips and went half whole wheat flour, half all purpose. I cut the recipe in half and came out with 8 muffins of small-ish size. 6 did not see the sun set.

16 muffins, is that a joke? This recipe makes 12 PUNY muffins. We don't eat any sugar/sweeners in our house, so we just omitted the sugar altogether and these turned out delicious (to our surprise and delight). My husband and son made these with 5 small bananas, to boost the sweetness, and they were amazing. This is a regular recipe now, I just hope I remember to double it next time!

Used barbc's version of the double recipe -see below, and loved it! I used 1 cup white flour and 2 cups regular whole wheat. Will be using this in the future. Only thing to keep in mind to avoid confusion: barbc called the wheat germ - wheat bran (not sure if there is a difference?). I used wheat germ and it was great!

Rating: 4
I did not follow the recipe exactly, but I love how these came out! They're my favorite muffins lately. My changes are as follows: Instead of wheat germ, I used wheat bran. Instead of milk, I used plain soy milk. I also added about 3/4 of a cup chopped pecans that I had just lying around, and added a little ground ginger just because. NOM!

Next time I'm going to make this recibe with 2 cups of bananas, I think it would be better yet.

These muffins were absolutely delicious. I subbed 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup brown sugar. Will definitely make again.

I really enjoyed these muffins, as did the rest of my family, who remarked that they didn't even taste healthy. I used the changes outlined by previous reviewer barbbc, except I halved to make a single recipe. I went easy on the sugar and added a little cinnamon and a bunch of blueberries. This is a flexible and easy recipe. I will definitely make it again. Thanks to other reviewers for coming up with the improved version.

I like these muffins for their healthiness but improve it by using sprouted [organic] whole wheat flour (or whole wheat pastry flour), brown sugar reduced to 1/2 cup, double the vanilla (for every recipe no matter what, it *always* improves it, then I add extra bananas (4-5 instead of 3 if I have them) plus add a handful of mini semi-sweet chocolate morsels and 1/3 cup of peanut butter-- super yummy!! :)

Rating: 4
These were super tasty. I didn't have any wheat germ around so I had to leave that out, but I added 2 tbsp of ground flaxseed and that gave the muffins a nice nutty flavor!

Rating: 3
I used the recipe with the alterations below, along with a few of my own additions. I only had enough banana for a single recipe (the one below is a double), so I used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar to help with the moisture balance. I also added about 1/4 tsp each of fresh nutmeg and ground cinnamon just to deepen the flavor, and 1/2 cup each of golden raisins (again, to keep it moist) and chopped walnuts, and used melted butter instead of vegetable oil (because I like butter). If I were to make these again, I would probably add another 1/4 to 1/2 cup of banana.

Someone else didn't give it the recipe 4 forks because they made many changes. Well, based on the comments of many others here, I changed the recipe quite a bit too, but am giving it 4 forks because using our combined efforts, it's now a simply fabulous recipe. Here's "our" version, which is actually also a double recipe, but it's great, and, again, many thanks to all the other contributors for helping me to create this recipe: 1 ½ cups unbleached all-purpose flour 1 ½ cups white whole wheat flour 3/4 cup white sugar 3/4 cup light brown sugar 2 T baking powder 1 teasp baking soda 1 teasp salt 1 ½ cups wheat bran 3 cups mashed ripe bananas (5-6) 1 cup skim milk 4 eggs 2/3 cup vegetable oil 2 teasp vanilla extract Make as directed in the original recipe. Enjoy and Thanks!

Good recipe! I only gave 3 forks because I made some adjustments. I was really looking for a banana bran bread recipe. I ended up substituting wheat bran for the wheat germ and it turned out fine. As other reviewers suggested I also added 1/2 t baking powder, used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 all-purpose flour and 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. I also tossed in a handful of diced apricots and some walnuts and baked it in a loaf pan for 1 hour. A great and easy way to use leftover bananas and it survived all my tinkering!

These are easy and delicious. I make them with the white whole wheat flour that is becoming easier to find these days and throw in blueberries and walnuts. My teenagers grab them for a quick breakfast on the go.

These were really easy...I added 1/2 tsp baking soda (as others did-Substituted 1/2 of whole wheat flour for 1/2 cup of the all purpose flour, substituted 1/2 c. oatmeal and 1/4 flax meal for the wheat germ and used less sugar and added agave nectar instead.. My family loved them!

Love this recipe. Agree that it was quick and easy, and my kids loved them. I made 12 large muffins and 12 mini's and the mini's were gone before the large ones were out of the oven.

Yeah, I'd agree that it's a very good basic recipe-- I added a half teaspoon cinnamon and to the top of each muffin before baking, a dollop of the cream cheese filling I had leftover from a recent batch of the Bran Surprise Muffins. That really put them over the top. Yum.

Delicious and moist. I made mini-muffins with this when all my bananas went over-ripe in the summer heat. Love the wheat germ touch. I added a little walnut oil, just because. Turned out very nice.

Rating: 4
A big hit! The banana flavor really comes through. In the absence of wheat germ, I used a combination of wheat bran and quick cooking oats. Made enough for 16 full sized muffins + 12 minis. The minis were completely gone by the time the full sized muffins finished baking!

I just made these for myself on a bright Sunday morning. I substitued brown rice syrup for the sugar, added cinnamon, nutmeg and toasted walnuts. I also used 1/2 each white wheat flour/whole wheat flour and white flour. I used a little pinch more of baking powder. And used yogurt instead of milk. All the substitutes just for fun. They are excellent, if I say so myself. Not too sweet and quite flavorful. I am sure they are good as is with the recipe but it was fun to experiment with it.

These muffins are delicious, healthy and easy to make. This has become THE banana muffin recipe at our house! Kids as well as adults love them. The batter made 14 muffins in my muffin tins. Do try this recipe - it is a keeper!!

I made these muffins with my 3 year old. Very easy recipe for her to help with and she loved to eat them. Not a lot of flavors but simply tasty. I added the 1/2 tsp or Baking soda and nutmeg to the recipe (thank you cook from Oakland) and they were great.

I've tried a lot of other banana muffin recipes, and this one is my favorite, with no modifications. Sometimes less is more, and I think the simple combination of banana, wheat germ and vanilla doesn't need to be improved. I also like that this recipe is simple enough by the time your oven has preheated to 400, your muffins are ready to go in.

I made this recipe exactly as written. My husband and I found the muffins unremarkable. I notice that many who gave this recipe a good review also modified the recipe. There are so many great banana bread recipes, why would I try to tweak this one to make it better? It definitely could use either nuts, spice, or brown sugar.

Rating: 3
These were great. Much better than your standard banana bread recipe. I also made a couple substitutions: I only had 2 bananas (about 1 cup mashed), so added 1/2 cup sour cream to make up the difference. Substituted 1 stick of butter for the oil and used half brown sugar and half white sugar. Great texture, very moist and yummy right from the oven!!

These were so good! I used ww pastry flour and buttermilk, also part of the sugar was sucanat but I did use the full amount called for. Sweet, yes, but not over the top and I think the sugar contributes to the nice exterior texture.

Rating: 4
Excellent! I used half granulated sugar and half organic sucanat, and substituted unsweetened plain soy milk for milk and coconut oil for veggie oil. I also made a crispy topping by tossing together some wheat germ, sucanat, maple sugar, and oatmeal and sprinkling it on the tops before baking. They turned out super moist in the center and the ceramic muffin tin i used made them really nice and crispy on the outside. I will definitely make this again, though I wonder if anyone will ever review this without having made a substitution!

Delicious! The only thing I changed was that I substituted 1/2 cup of flour with whole wheat flour. Now I know what I'm going to do with all of the ripe banans in my freezer!

These are three and half forks. I made some changes, sub 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, and used a mixture of milk and yogurt to equal 1/2 cup. I also added 1/2 tsp of baking soda, and baked them at 350, for about 30 min. Oh I added some choped pecans to the batter, they turned out really moist. I used a nonstick muffin pan with out the liners and used pam for baking to spray the pan. The secret to not sticking is taking them out of the pan as soon as they're out of the oven and then cool on a rack.

Rating: 3
I used a mixture of whole grain oats, barley, wheat, spelt, rice and rye instead of the wheat germ, not a bad substitution. I imagine this makes them a bit chewier. Also halved the sugar and added nutmeg and cinnamon - next time I will include more of both (or use older bananas). European tips: Since the baking powder here is single-acting, I used one TB of baking powder and one TB of baking soda. Baked for 20 minutes at 180 degrees Celsius.

Rating: 4
Had only one overripe banana. Halved the recipe and made 6 large muffins. I followed the other reviews and baked muffins at 375 for 22 minutes. They came out perfect. I did use whole wheat cake flour instead of white and substituted organic unsweetened applesauce for the oil. I added 1 tablespoon oil and 1/2 cup shredded coconut. I just pulled them out of the over and half of them are gone. Wish I'd had one more banana to make the entire recipe. Will definitely make again.

These muffins were sooooo good! Instead of using a normal muffin pan i used a mini muffin pan. They turned out great...they were a good healthy snack. They disappeared in a week. The wheat germ is surprising but it gives it a fantastic texture. This is one of those recipes that i get excited over!

I love this recipe! I even changed it up a bit and used splenda instead of regular sugar, and vanilla flavored soy milk instead of plain milk and they came out just delicious and very moist. I have made this recipe numerous times for my friends and family and they just gobble them up.

I used others' suggestions: 1 c flour, 1/2 c whole wheat flour, 1/2 c sugar, 1/2 t baking soda, 1/2 t cinnamon, dash of nutmeg, with a pecan on top. Delicious! I think I will try them with 1/3 c sugar next time. Healthy and sweet -- you'll feel like you're cheating on your diet!

SALT CAN BE REDCUED TO 1/2 TEASPOON. Used 1/2 cup whole-wheat flour, 1/3 cup soy flour, 2/3 cup all-pupose flour, 1/s cup soymilk instead of regular milk. Taste better as it age. Very moist muffin. Even with the changes I just made, the muffins does not taste like a healthy version. The only thing is that it doesn't rise to be tall muffins.

I guess I was expecting something with a slightly healthier taste. I reduced the sugar and it still seemed too much to me. I also prefer my banana muffins to be a bit firmer. These didn't hold their shape at all and fell flat once I took them out of the oven.

Made as written - really delicious. I baked them in a convection oven at 375 for 22 minutes. The wheat germ is a good crunchy addition. I don't even miss the nuts, which are standard in my banana bread. I will use this recipe again.

I had a problem with this recipe. I didn't have any muffin liners and when I baked the muffins at 400 degrees I scorched the bottom of the muffins. I read the reviews to see if any one had altered the heat because I have NEVER baked anything at 400 degrees before but no one had mentioned it. Maybe with the liners 400 degrees is fine. If I make them again I will bake them at 350 degrees with or without liners. That said, the muffins are incredibly simple, the wheat germ give them a nice texture, they are moist and reasonably healthy. I will give them another try.

This is the best banana muffin recipe going. My kids like them warm and straight from the oven. I keep toasted wheat germ in my refrigerator at all times to make this recipe.

this is a great recipe... banana bread is one of my all-time favorites, and i'm always looking for ways to make it more nutritious (i'm an aspiring dietitian, so nutrition is a bit of an obsession for me). I love the flavors of the wheat germ with the banana, it gives a nice nutty flavor. I did actually make a couple of alterations to make it lower calorie and low fat -- first, i halved the sugar and oil (bananas are so sweet to begin with that they don't need all of the sugar), and then i added a half a tsp of baking soda as well. the texture of the bread remains nice and moist, and holds together well, even without all the added fat and sugar. i think next time i'll try using some whole wheat flour as well, for added fiber.

Rating: 4
Not that this muffin recipe needs another review...but, they were very good and I would certainly recommend them. I have other banana muffin recipes but they are more old-fashioned (ie more butter, more sugar) and this is a healthier alternative. I didn't change a thing.

I love wheat germ and bananas, and felt like baking something, so I tried this recipe. It was terrific! I followed the suggestions of some earlier reviewers (used buttermilk, added about 1/4 tsp of baking soda, and usad applesauce for the about 3/4 of the oil). I split the batter and added chopped pecans to half. I baked some in mini tins (about 13 minutes at 350) and the others in full-size. I didn't have liners or cooking spray, so I brushed the muffin cups lightly with veg oil (I cut out most of the oil in the recipe, and it didn't take much) - no problems with sticking. I baked the full-size muffins at 350 for about 20 minutes. (Maybe my oven runs hot, I often burn baked goods if I don't check them and just follow the recipes). Now, if they hold up for a few days... I will have found a perfect muffin recipe! A note to others -- if you buy the wheat germ in the glass jars, it is already toasted - check the labels and save yourself a step.

Excellent recipe! The muffins were the perfect texture, not to dry, not too heavy. My changes: I used wheat bran instead of wheat germ and substitued 1/4 cup of the sugar with molasses. My oven runs hot, so I baked them at 375 deg. and they were done to perfection in 20 minutes. I didn't even use cup liners, I just sprayed the cups with cooking oil spray and the muffins didn't stick a bit. My only criticsm was that they were a tad too sweet for my taste, so I may reduce the sugar next time around. My husband had two for breakfast and he usually doesn't eat a thing before lunch!

These were really good muffins. Even my 12 year old son loved them (yes, even with wheat germ in them...ssshhh don't tell him). I did make a couple of changes, I mixed melted butter equally with vegetable to make the 1/3 cup and equal amounts of low fat plain yogurt and milk. Don't know how much difference the yogurt/milk combo made to the texturn, but the butter/oil gave a great depth of flavor.

These muffins were outstanding! I was looking for a change up on the traditional banana muffins that I make and everyone loves, but most certainly, are bored with. I added peanut butter chips to the batter (maybe 1/2 cup) and used applesauce for the oil to reduce the fat. Will make again for sure!

Rating: 3
These muffins are outstanding. I made the batter exactly as the recipe reads, but upon reading the reviews, I kept the oven at about 385 degrees and baked the muffins for 22 minutes (using paper muffin liners - didn't have aluminum liners on hand). I cooking spray'ed the liners lightly which helped the muffins release perfectly. It's a great way to get my significant other and our toddler to eat wheat germ. Next time I'll try the recipe as some of the other reviewers have made it with less oil and use turbinado sugar.

Rating: 3
Excellent banana muffin recipe. Would definitely make again, especially since they're semi-healthy (with the wheat germ). I substituted buttermilk for the milk, with great results. I also added some chopped walnuts and sprinkled some sugar in the raw on top because I like my muffins a little sweeter.

Delicious and super moist! Its my new favorite for idea for disposing of rotten bananas!!

To the person from Brooklyn who said the muffins burnt when they were cooked at 400 degrees, if you follow the recipe exactly, the muffins will come out perfectly. When extra sugar is added to a recipe that has a small amount of flour to begin with, that can definitely cause overbrowning. Be sure to use aluminum muffin liners rather than plain paper liners, as well. I have made these twice. Once I used the wheat germ, and once I used old fashioned oats. They turned out well both ways. I will definitely make again.

These muffins are great! They're moist inside, but crunchy on top (they didn't last beyond the morning so I don't know how well they keep).

I only used 1/2 cup sugar and used pure maple syrup for the rest of it - I didn't have any vanilla so I thought the mapple syrup would be a good substitute for the flavor. I used buttermilk instead of milk. And I used Quaker old fashioned oats instead of wheat germ (didn't have wheat germ). The muffins (large size) came out wonderful, big, moist, and very tasty. It took exactly 25 minutes at 400 degree. Excellent recipe!

Rating: 3
Be careful if you don't use liners. I thought 400 was a bit of a hot oven, so set my timer for 20 minutes instead of 25 and they were totally burnt on the bottom. But aside from that, they were super moist and i only used 1/4 cup of oil and used buttermilk. The flavor was great and I have a sweet tooth, so added about 1/4 cup of honey as well. Will definitely make again.

These are great! I usually don't like banana breads, but I tried the muffins because I had some old bananas to get rid of, and I will absolutely make them again. They don't taste too banana-y and are just the right texture. Followed recipe as written, but with buttermilk for milk.

Just took these out of the oven, and already tasted! I made as written, except I eyeballed the bananas, rather than measured, and added about a cup of chopped dates (they were left from another recipe). I made a dozen large muffins, and another dozen minis. I tried a mini, and they're really good. Moist, but definitely not soggy, and I probably used more bananas than called for. If they keep well (assuming I get a chance to try that, depending on family consumption!), they'll definitely be a repeat in this home.

These muffins were much too mushy and gooey and totally inedible. There is probably too much banana in the recipe, and this created one big mush. I've made tons of different kinds of muffins, and never had this problem before. Was very disappointed and would definitely not make these again.

Appreciated "review" suggestions. Used l cup white and l/2 cup whole wheat. Buttermilk. Did not have foil cups, so sprayed with Pam and they turned out great. I needed to use 3 l/2 bananas mashed and my baking time was about l7 minutes. The best banana muffin receipe I have tried so far.

Excellent muffins. I used sour milk instead of sweet, 4 large bananas, mashed, instead of 3, a dash of nutmeg added when I added the vanilla, and about 1/3 cup of chopped-up dried nectarines added to the batter at the end. These are great--I think the nectarines (apricots would be good too) add a nice contrasting element. I kept the oil and flour exactly as in the recipe, and would make these again in a second. You can definitely taste the wheat--very good!

I made these muffins with 1/2 applesauce/ 1/2 oil and 1/2 white/ 1/2 wheat flour, plus 1% milk, and found that they had a good flavor, but were flat and rather dense. Will using 100% oil and buttermilk make the difference?
