The dressing is delicious. I used a combination of Romaine and radicchio because that is what I had on hand. The parsley gives it extra flavor.

This is my all time favorite salad dressing, and the one I get the most requests for. I always add a little more minced shallot than is called for because I like the crunch. Be sure to use a really good balsamic vinegar - it makes all the difference in the world. I love Fini, available at Williams Sonoma, Fairway, and some grocery stores.

Great vinaigrette. I'm going to start keeping a batch in the fridge. The honey adds a rich and natural sweetness - works well with half the amount of honey called for too.

A wonderfully simple recipe--several people at my party last night asked me for the recipe for the dressing for this salad. I put no additions in- wonderful with the rest of the barbeque food.

This dressing really is a good mix with blue cheese, like the intro says. I served a simple salad of these greens and some crumbled gorgonzola and it was yummy. I think alone, it would be too sweet for me.

I will definitely make this again. I didn't have racicchio or parsley so I used only mesclun and it was great. I added pine nuts to the dressing as well. This is a simple and very delicious dressing recipe.

This is an excellent salad dressing, especially if you're looking for an alternative to a garlic as an ingredient. We have made this one over and over and it's always a great hit.
