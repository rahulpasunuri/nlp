The pork was fantastic. I marinated it overnight and all day and it had great flavor. I used less sugar (1/4 cup) in the jam, added a bit of tomato paste to amp up the tomato flavor, added a smidgen more red pepper flakes, and just a few teaspoons of water (rather than 1/2 cup). And I don't think I used 2 lbs of tomatoes- maybe 6-8 plum tomatoes total. The endives were delicious as well.

Loved this menu. The pork has great flavor and can stand alone. Only change was to leave the rub on for about 3 hrs. Will definitely make pork again. The tomato chile jam is great - sweeetness in the first taste and finishs with a nice spicy hotness. The jam is a keeper and will make again. The jam slightly overshadows the flavor of the pork, but it definitely adds to the flavor of the grilled endive. The three components of this 'menu' really work well together. The only side i served was Parmesan Roasted Butternut Squash from this site, which is rich tasting, quick & easy and a perfect side dish for this menu.

Loved the meat, but jam was blah: I followed the recipe for the tenderloin pretty much exactlly - -the only changes I made were to add more garlic cloves (3 large total), and to let it marinate about double the time: 1/2 hour outside fridge and 1/2 hour inside. The flavor was excellent, which surprised me b/c of the short marinade time. As for the jam -- I used store bought 'tomatoes on the vine' that were red but had minimal tomato taste, so that probably accounts in part for the blah flavor of the jam. It tasted like sweet hot pepper jam -could barely taste any tomato flavor. But I don't think that even my garden beefsteaks would improve the recipe much, as written. I think, at minimum, a clove of minced garlic should be added to the tomatoes as they cook down. Or chopped onions sauteed first before the tomatoes are thrown in. There is a great recipe for a spicy onion jam that accompanies another grilled pork tenderloin recipe here -it's WAY better. Also, a mango salsa would work well w/ this tenderloin. I would make the meat again, not the jam. Did not try the endive but served w/ arugula salad instead.

Didn't make the tomato chile jam but the tenderloins were fantastic. Simple and superb! Took a little longer than 8-10 minutes on the gas grill, but could be a result of the snowy winter weather out there.

This recipe is excellent -- with white fish. I have made this several times with halibut and opah, and I think it works much better with fish than it does with pork. I cut the sugar back a little and it's a hit every time!

Tenderloin was exceptionally tender and desicious w/this spice paste. Tomato jam was overpoweringly sweet and didn't really fit with the pork. (Then again, I don't care for too much sweet stuff in my entrees.) Jam was also a bit time consuming for the results...I've had better chili sauce. Would do the pork like this again.

This is a real winner! The Tomato Chile Jam is fabulous and very easy to make. Also a great way to use all the fresh tomatoes coming in from the garden. The jam would be great with grilled chicken too. Will try that next time

I love this recipe and have made it for a birthday dinner, fourth of July and a family get together. It is easy to double and the tomato chile jam is easy to make. I followed the recipe to a tee with delicious results.

The tomato jam is awesome. I made the full amount of the rub for a 1 and 1/2 lb. pork tenderloin and it was perfect.

This is my favorite recipe and one I prepare for clients regularly. I would not use canned tomatoes as some suggest as the consistency is not the same.

I found this recipe in the morning and couldn't remember the endive when I went to the market this evening - so we had tenderloin and the jam. The tenderloin is delicious and the jam is such a surprise - it starts out sweet and then "gotcha" what a kick. Made the receipe exactly as written (except no endive and used beefsteak tomatoes as they were red and the roma/plum tomatoes were an anemic pink at the market) - trying to decide what t do with the leftover jam - but throwing it away is not an option.

This is a great, easy recipe. If you want a really quick meal, skip the tomato jam. The pork tenderloin with the rub is great without it, but the jam makes it exceptional. My 7 & 10 year olds loved the pork and even dipped it in a little bit of jam. The jam is wonderfully sweet to begin with and then packs a spicy kick at the end. I liked the endive, but everyone else would have rather had a salad. It is so unusual that I find a recipe that everyone likes. This will be added to our favorites list.

The coating on the pork loin was excellent, although I did not think the recipe made enough to coat the entire loin; would double next time. For the tomato jam, I added rosemary, (as was chopping it up anyway) and a splash of champagne (as was drinking it anyway!), and it turned out wonderful. Very pretty for company with roasted green beans.

This was an outstanding summer dinner - very easy to prepare and cook. I found grating the tomatoes a bit tricky as they were slippery once you got into it but the tomato jam is the perfect complement to the salty/herbed pork. Also the mild bitterness of the endive added another wonderful dimension to the meal.

I made this for Mother's Day and the tomato chile jam was quite the hit. I had worried while cooking it that the consistency wasn't quite right, but I realized later that it didn't need to be very syrupy or reduced, as I had worried. And I had to skip the endive since the stuff at the local store looked pretty gross. Make the sauce as directed - it's great.

Served at one dinner party and a few months later it was requested for another dinner party. Just as big a hit as the first time.

Very nice recipe that is easy to prepare. Great for entertaining. Everyone loved it, including the kids. The tomato chili jam is delicious but really has to be made from fresh tomatoes. The jam is better the next day.

Very easy and tasty. Great summer fare. Made exactly as written as I usually do on the first tasting. Would up the red pepper flakes for my group. Served with orzo and roasted vegetables with a warm goat cheese on toast over greens to follow and a cold French rose. Enjoy

One of my favorite on this site yet! This is a great dish for entertaining since much of the prep work can be done in advance, it makes a great presentation, and the mix of flavors is a wonderfully complex tasting dish (even though it's really simple). Summer favorite.

Fantastic flavors. Just the right amount of heat. Use canned Italian tomatoes--very fast and delicious.

This is a terrific recipe, easy and relatively quick. We didn't find the tomato jam too hot, as did another reader. We'll definitely make it again many times.

WATCH THE PEPPER FLAKES! VERY SPICY, AND WE LIKE SPICE. USED CANNED TOMATOES, VERY EASY.

Really good - because the pork is only marinated for 20 or so minutes, the flavor is really subtle. The tomato jam is the best part of this recipe. I used a 2 roma tomotoes and a variety of ripe tomatoes from our garden and had plenty left over (the grating method really works!). The jam pulls all the flavors together and is deliciously spicy and good. I might grill walla walla onions next time instead of the endive, which was a little bland.

Took more than 30 min. for the temp. to reach 150, but worth the wait. The tomato jam (using canned plum tomatoes) was delicious, though the quantity was more than we needed for this amount of pork.

Brilliant recipe! I don't have a grill, so as suggested I used a stove-top grill pan. The tenderloin cooked for about 18-20 minutes, twice as long as it would have cooked on a grill. Even though the thermometer read 160* (I wasn't fast enough) when I removed the meat, the tenderloin was beautifully tender and a little pink upon slicing. The tomato sauce is great, and would be great with any other meat. Very simple and quick recipe that tastes fabulous. Great for guests!
