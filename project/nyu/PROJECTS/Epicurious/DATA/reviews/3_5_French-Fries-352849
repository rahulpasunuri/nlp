Perfect fries, although I agree with the other reviewers that you have to watch them carefully for the second batch, 5 minutes was too long.

These were great. Most certainly the best homemade fries I have ever had. I used a mandoline slicer to get nice, thin fries (somewhat thinner than the recipe mentioned) and I watched them carefully to make sure they didn't over-fry on the second go round. Fresh out of the oven with salt, they were delicious. They even heated up well in the toaster oven the next day.

I usualy let the fries cool down before I refry them and you have to keep a close eye on the fries to keep from over cooking

This was straightforward enough but five minutes for the second fry is too long. they weren't all that good.
