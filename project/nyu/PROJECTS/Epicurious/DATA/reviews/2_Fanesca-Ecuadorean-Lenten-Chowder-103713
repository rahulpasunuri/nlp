Very good soup. My family enjoyed it tremendously. For leftovers, we added shrimp. You must use good ingredients. The family is asking for a repeat of this one soon.

IT A DELICIOUS DISH AND I WOULD DEFINITELY MAKE IT AGAIN.IT ALL DEPENDS IN HOW YOU MAKE IT AND WHAT INGREDIENTS YOU USE. THIS SOUP IS VERY EASY AND IT IS VERY NUTRITIOUS.ONLY PEOPLE WITH PASSION FOR FOOD CAN MAKE IT.

Absolutely horrible. Tastes like incompatible leftovers just thrown together. Tossed it.

Less than 1 fork! And these are most of my favorite ingredients! There is so much in this, yet the final outcome is so awful. We tried everything to jazz it up...something...ANYTHING! It made so much and was so bad. I hated to throw it away, but I did.
