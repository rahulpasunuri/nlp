I've made this granola many times and it's delicious. You have to make sure you toss it often during baking for even toasting but otherwise it's fool proof.

Every year at this time I look for a simple recipe for my grandchildren (7 and 3) to make for their parents for a Christmas gift, and this turned out very well with both kids able to take part in the process. We munched on it a bit as we were packing the cooled finished product in the glass container, and it was delicious. I, too, baked it longer at the lower temperature than the recipe stated.

A very plain Jane recipe but easy to change to suit your tastes. I think the temp is too high -- 375 for 25 minutes burned mine. Would do 325 next time. I would also reduce the amount of honey as I found it too sweet, especially with the coconut.

I love this recipe because you can tweak the ingredients and control the sweetness: commercial granola bars are loaded with sugar (and are expensive). The lower baking temperature helps, and I bake just long enough for the granola clusters to start turning a darker color and to start smelling like baked oats: you'll know it when you smell it.

So far, this is the best granola recipe I've found. I used a lot of different dried fruits - cherries, apricots, raisins... and a little less coconut. I also added a bit of vanilla.

Very easy and tasty. I used maple syrup instead of honey and added cinnamon. Cooked at 300 for about 1.5 hours. Delicious! This is going to be the new breakfast cereal in my household!

Excellent! Love it. Love it. Love it. I use this as a basic and mix it up sometimes. It definitely does not last in my house.

This was a super simple recipe! I added chopped pecans, cinnamon, and fresh grated nutmeg. I used it for fruit and yogurt parfaits for Mother's day. My dad doesn't really care for "granola" but he LOVES this! Definitely a go to recipe! Try this one!!

This was good. Added pecan pieces but baked for about an hour at 250. Gave away as Christmas gifts and it was a big hit.

Yum! Bake for longer at a lower temp on parchment paper lined cookie sheet. Also works great with walnuts and craisins. Give this one a try!

I like this recipe as a basic, you can add so many things and play around with it. I like to add about 4 tbsp of whole flax seed for the added health benefit.

Really awesome basic recipe. I had to substitute regular raisins for golden ones, and left out the almonds (couldn't find them). I did 250F for 51 minutes, and it turned out crispy and golden-brown. Now it's time to experiment and have fun with it!

I LOVE this recipe. I make granola fortnighly now. I agree with other posters about lowering the temperature and baking for longer. I go about 300 degrees and stay in the kitchen. You can smell when the granola needs to be turned. Also, I love when the granola is in clusters. To get this effect simply do the following when you pull the pan(s) out of the oven. Mix in your raisins and cranberry, then take paper towels and press down really hard on the granola while it is still in the pan. Let it cool like this (compressed with the paper towels still on top). When you peel away the paper towels when it is cool you will have a lovely combination of clusters and loose granola.

THIS IS GREAT!!!!! I've never made granola before. I followed the advice of others and baked it at about 250 until it was golden brown. That took close to 2 hours. I used almonds and sunflower seeds because any more nuts would have been expensive. I will definitely make this again.

This granola was delicious, but the recipe makes rather a large quantity. If you have extra granola, mix equal parts granola and peanut butter for a spread that is delightful on apples or toast.

i love the way this came out, however i did take some suggestions from the other users. i added pistachios and macadamias instead of coconut. i added a teaspoon or two of cinnamon and roasted it for 60 minutes at 250. and it turned out perfectly!

This is a great basic recipe, but listen to gypsyjew and turn the oven way down, I used 250 degrees and it took almost 2 hrs but believe the slow roast is the right way to go. I don't like coconut, so I replaces with extra nuts (pistachio and macadamia)added 1/4 t cinnamon and "heaping" half cup of a mix of maple syrup and honey. Very nice results. I used the full 1/2 cup of canola oil and did not find it was too much.

Having made granola for years I was just looking for a good one with honey since I use pure maple syrup. This is a good recipe however, it is important to know that with Granola you are trying to DRY it not bake it, try turning down your oven to 220-270 and let it dry for 60-120 minutes instead. Also I use olive oil, you can add flax seed and sunflower seeds but they taste better if you add them after the drying process.

I took the advice of those who posted here and cut down on the oil. I think I should have only cut down on it by 1/3 instead of a full 1/2; some of the edges were a little well-done, and I spent an adequate amount of time stirring. It still turned out really good, and I will make it the next time I have a hankering for granola ;)

I set the timer for the minimum time and it still burned on me. It was also an expensive recipe to make. It tasted pretty good, but I probably won't make it again.

I used maple syrup instead of honey and added some hazelnuts and walnuts. I served this at a game night party and everyone wanted the recipe. I agree that the oil should be cut in half.

My first attempt at granola.Very good.Next time I'd cut down on the oil a bit.It left residual oil on the container I stored it in,something I've never seen in the store-bought kind.
