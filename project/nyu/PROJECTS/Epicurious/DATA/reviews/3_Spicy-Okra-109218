This recipe provides a good base from which to start. We like more heat, so I added three ripe chopped jalapenos from our garden and cumin. I also used a 27 oz can of fire roasted tomatoes. Turned out quite well and is definitely an easy weekday meal.

I thought this recipe was good, but, like the other posters, didn't think it was spicy. I would make it again and add some cilantro and cayenne for some more kick.

This is a favorite. I kick it up with plenty of cayenne pepper and add cumin for more depth of taste.

I must say I can always count on Epicurious. This recipe was delicious!! I am not an okra "expert" - having only eaten okra in gumbo. But we eat tons of vegetables and I was looking for a side dish that would be a change of pace. I'm glad I tried this! I had some canned chipotle peppers in the fridge, so I used one of those along with a bit of the juice. It was plenty spicy. We loved it. This is a very, very easy side dish and I will definitely make it again.

It was sort of bland. I used the italian blend of diced tomatoes and cut up some serrano peppers and put them in there and it still had no bite. Next time I would put some crushed red pepper or a hotter pepper in it. Nice dish for something different though!

This was really easy to make and a change from the typical side dish. I agree with other reviews: not very spicey.

Delicious, but not spicy at all.

After reading so many rave reviews, I expected this dish to be far better than it was. The recipe was very easy, but unfortunately, the end result was unimpressive. Sorry!

This is a great recipe. My husband (not a big fan of okra) thought it was very good. One big plus -- you can have almost all of the ingredients on hand. Highly recommend!

Shoud have been brave and used the habeneros. It was good but the jalapenos did not add any zip.

I had never eaten okra until tonight. My boyfriend used to have it fried as a child. A friend was coming over who loves okra and doesn't get it often. At the last minute we invited 2 neighbors to join us. We whipped up this recipe and altered it slightly by adding some diced green olives. Oh my gosh, we had 5 RAVE reviews including myself - the picky eater. I can't believe I'm looking forward to having okra again. Thank you.

This is the basic okra recipe -- ya either love okra or hate it. I've been making this recipe for years -- I got it from my dad, an okra lover from way back. For heat, I use either a couple pinches of red pepper flakes, or sometimes a little minced chipotle. I always add a clove or two of chopped garlic. A little oregano is good also. Fresh okra, cut up, is less slimy than cut frozen. If using frozen, I recommend buying whole. Primo, of course, is tiny, tender, whole, fresh okra.
