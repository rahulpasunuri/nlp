Very well received both times I've made this. I'd make double next time--not only because it's delicious, but also because the anchovy tins come with about double what's called for here..

This was incredible!! And it MUST be made as-written. If you have lived in Europe, or visited France, or even if you hold a small, special place in your heart for Jean Reno films, you will know that to make this with pizza crust or...que domage!...store bought pastry dough is a tragedy...nay...a veritable crime against humanity. Don't be lazy, it takes five minutes to roll out a basic pastry dough like this. I mean, really...sheesh. This will make a very rich appetizer, but a little goes a long way and my dinner party of nine found one tart to be perfect. The caramelized onions marry with the anchovy and earthiness of the crust and...wow...it was like being back in Paris. I served this with a lamb stew with spring vegetables and crepes for dessert...it was a near perfect meal.

I made this as an hors doeuvres at a dinner party. One guest had lived in France for years and said it tasted just like the onion galette his host mother used to make! Couldn't be bothered to make my own dough so I used Safeway brand pie crust (but did some research online before choosing that brand). Also used an entire tube of anchovy paste instead of fillets and used 1/2 tube tomato paste which is a more than 2 tbsps. Also used fresh thyme and was quite generous. Turned out amazing and my husband has been asking me to make it again. Going to take it to a pre-Thanksgiving holiday party tonight.

I'd have to agree with the previous reviewer: I followed the recipe exactly, but I should have known that the ratio of butter:flour in the pastry crust is too high. Even if it wasn't, I also agree that it would be tastier with a thin-crust pizza dough. I would also reduce the amount of onions and/or increase the amount of anchovies as the sweet/salty balance is also a little off.

I would have given this 2.5 forks if possible. The filling is very good and the pastry would be delicious for a sweet/fruit galette, but it is way too rich for this filling. The filling would be much better accompanied by a butter-free, pizza- like crust. The crust was extremely flaky, so much that it fell apart when cutting/serving. Also, I needed about 1 1/2 times the tomato- anchovy-garlic mixture. And made a few changes: I doubled the garlic; added about 3-4 T-spoons of creme fraiche to the onions after taking them off the heat; used sage instead of thyme and added it to the onions directly.
