Loved how this tart turned out. The nutty brown butter flavor was so good. I also loved that this recipe was not super sweet.

Very good. As the other reviewers mentioned, it wasn't too sweet. Very French in style and flavor. I might try adding another apple next time - just to amp up the tart apple taste. The crust and custard like filling turned out perfect, so this recipe is definitely a keeper for me!

I made this tart for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit! I don't really enjoy the traditional apple or pumpkin pie and this tart was a perfect alternative. It's not too sweet and it looks very pretty. I didn't have time to make the crust and used frozen pie crust from Trader Joe's. It was still very very good. This will now be my go-to pie. I used a 9" removable tart pan and 2 braeburn apples and there was no leftover filling. I will stick with a 9" pan.

My husband and I loved this tart! I made the mistake of poking holes in the crust, thus the buttering filling leaked out a bit but this was a great dessert. Not too sweet. I would definitely make this again.

This is a really nice tart, very European as it is not overly sweet. Used a different crust recipe but followed the filling recipe as written. Thought it might overflow as I used a slightly smaller tart pan, but it just puffed up nicely and no drips at all. Not at all difficult to make and it kept well in the fridge for several days. Nice to make something that has no milk or sourcream for those who are sensitive to lactose. Will definitely make again.
