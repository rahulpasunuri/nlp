This recipe is easy and tasty! It was a nice side dish with great Indian flavors. I made it as written expect I used red skin potatoes with the skin on and increased the boiling time slightly. I would make this again.

Soooo yummy! Made with Chicken Tikki and Steamed Asparagus with cardamom butter. Perfect as written.

These were great, I made it with the chicken tikka and mango and red pepper chutney from this site, and they complimented it nicely. They needed to cook quite a bit longer than the recipe said, but came out very nicely.

I thought the flavor of this dish was lovely, but I was frustrated by the instructions, "2 small russet potatoes." I'd prefer to have something more specific--either the weight of the unpeeled potatoes or amount (in cups, oz, or grams) when peeled and chopped. I had to make a guess and ended up with way too much broth--more like soup--so had to remove quite a bit of extra liquid. So, cut back on the liquid and add more only if necessary. I also used half an onion as suggested here and chili powder instead of paprika. Tasty.

This was a delicious and easy side dish. I wouldn't change a thing and will definitely make it again!

I made this with what I had: ginger powder, no paprika, red potatoes with skin, veg broth, no lemon juice or cilantro. Despite the omissions, it was really good. I mean, I will be making this in place of any other potato most of the time from now on. Just make sure the turmeric and garlic are there, and coriander, and you're set. Next, I will try with onions, cauliflower, and etc!! This may be my new 'Aloo-gobi' recipe I have been looking for!

Eeay and delicious. Nice change of pace from regular roasted taters and satisfied my husband who is not so daring with his spices. Nicely compliments a spicy meat dish. I served with the Grilled Jerk Pork and Curried Peach Relish on this site.

Fantastic! I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added onion. I improvised a little with the spices, adding garam masala powder. Easy and delicious!

I made this recipe vegan using vegetable broth instead of chicken, and it was absolutely delicious. It will become a staple side dish in my home. I also used a little chile oil as well as olive oil to give it an extra kick. I bravely made it for friends the first time, following the cooking instructions exactly, and it came out perfect.

Delicious! I added 1 cup frozen peas with the potatoes, and otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Will def. make this again. Perfect side dish to go with other indian food.

Followed the recipe exactly as given and it was excellent. It was a wonderful side dish with chicken. Wondered if anyone had added extra chicken broth and poached chicken along with the potatoes. I might try this, but certainly think this recipe will be a side dish that I make many times, just as it is.

This was great!!!! Inspired me to submit my first review. Potatoes are my favorite veggie, and these rocked. Would agree that onion would be a great addition. For an orgasmic combo, make these easy potatoes and top with the "Spicy Roasted Eggplant w/ Tomatoes and Cilantro" on this site. Oh, and add peas too. Who needs men? or meat? or any other food? not I.

These were pretty good, but I think I put a little too much lemon juice. I will make these again sometime, they were pretty easy.

Thia was sooo good. My son wants me to make it again(I made it 2 nights ago). The only change I made was to add a little bit of Patak's hot curry paste since we enjoy spicier foods. This recipe will be become a frequently requested favorite.

This dish was so easy to prepare and turned out great. I added half an onion which it definitely needed. This went great with fragrant beef curry, also on this site. Highly recommend as a side dish to any indian food.

Easy and delicious! I didn't have any fresh ginger on hand, so I substituted 1 teaspoon of ground ginger. I didn't have any tumeric on hand, so I substituted 1/2 teaspoon curry powder for the tumeric and the coriander. Other than that . . . yum!! Served it with spiced herb marinated tilapia from this site.

Not necessarily authentic, but pretty tasty! I usually leave out the turmeric and substitute fresh-ground dried red chilis for the paprika (makes a huge difference). The glaze on this dish is really nice. It's a good standby side for most meals.

This wasn't that interesting at first, but it grew on me. Definitely better than another Indian potato recipe I tried from Epicurious. I would add onions next time, however. It was a little boring.

We have used this recipe for an accompniment to a curry, very good and easy recipe. We add an equal amount of cauliflower florets with the potatoes, just gives it a bit of variety.
