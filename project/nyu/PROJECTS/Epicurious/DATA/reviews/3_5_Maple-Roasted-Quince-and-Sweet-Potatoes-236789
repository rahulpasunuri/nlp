What a fantastic dish. It was a big hit at a pot luck I attended Christmas day. However, I substituted tarragon for the sage, based on a similar recipe that I like, and also added some crumbled bacon at the end. Am making it again this week while I still have some quince in my refrigerator!

This is not difficult to make and is quite tasty. I left out the maple syrup (sweet potatoes are sweet enough!) and instead drizzled the fruit & potatoes with 1/4 of an oil blend: mustard oil (about 1 tsp), toasted sesame oil (about 2 tsp), and olive oil. The quinces oxidize so fast when they're cut, that I at first thought they were rotten inside. But the brown color doesn't seem to effect the taste, and they look fine once cooked.

I found the quinces and some small unusual looking sweet potatoes at my local farmers market, so I made this dish and it was great! My husband doesn't like sweet potatoes but he ate this.
