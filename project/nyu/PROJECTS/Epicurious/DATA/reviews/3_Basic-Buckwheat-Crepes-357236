if you don't have buckwheat flour. you can use oat flour, wild rice flour, or cattail flour.

The real Frenc recipe: 330 gr buckwheat flour 10 gr "gros sel" (course salt) 75 cl cold water 1 egg Mix flour and salt, slowly add water while stirring, add egg. Cover and put in fridge for 1 to 2 hours!! Bake pancakes in a skillet. When one side is cooked and turned over, put on top: grated cheese, ham and an egg. Close the pancake and bake some more.Ready once the egg is cooked to your liking. You can do the same with eg smoke salmon, or veggie version with mushrooms. Falvour as you like! Sweet versions are possible too. Bon appétit! Oh, ideally you serve this with apple cider.

This recipe was waaaay too wet. I think it would be fine with about 1/2c of water. I ended up adding lots more flour because I'd already added all the liquid. Otherwise really yummy. Would probably add a little pepper next time.

Buckwheat crepes! That sounds wonderful. I just love a healthy and delicious breakfast and just recently tried pancakes made from Kamut Khorasan Wheat and they were so great! Must try, thanks!
