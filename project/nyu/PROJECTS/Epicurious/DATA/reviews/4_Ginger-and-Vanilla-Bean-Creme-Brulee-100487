Wow! This may be the best Creme Brulee I've ever had. My hubby thinks so, and Creme Brulee is his favorite dessert. I've made other Creme Brulee recipes before, but the flavor and texture of this one is superior. I didn't have any ginger, so made the plain vanilla version. The only modification I made was to use raw sugar (turbinado) for the topping as it gives a little extra crunch. Can't wait to make this again...

Instead of grated ginger, I used 2 tablespoons of orange zest and followed through with the rest of the instructions. I used slightly larger ramekins and baked for 40 minutes total. The consistency and taste was amazing! Per another user's suggestion, I used Ultra-Fine Pure Cane Sugar (C & H Brand) for both the custard and creme brûlée, and both turned out really delicious. Very versatile recipe for experimenting with different flavors.

I now made this more than 40 times since the recipe first appeared. I omit the ginger. The only problem is that it has turned me into a Creme Brulee snob. Mine is better than any I've ever received at some very fine restaurants. I even sent an order of Creme Brulle back to the kitchen in a very snooty French restaurant in Chicago. It was a runny mess, unlike the perfect custard that results from this Bon Appetit' recipe.

I was surprised by this. I used very fresh, pungent ginger, and infused the whipping cream for the amount of time specified. Not sure why, but I didn't get any ginger flavor in the finished dish. Only the vanilla came through. The texture wasn't as silky as I would have liked. It was good, but I prefer the Grand Marnier creme brulee recipe (from this site) in both taste and texture. It was good but given the user rating, I was just expecting a little more. Seems other cooks have had better luck with this one than I did.

Well, I will add my voice to the multitude and praise this recipe. I made it with both vanilla bean and ginger, the latter of which really gave it a subtle warm spicy flavor, perfect to balance out the creamy sweetness. I used a small blowtorch to caramelize the sugar. I didn't have any fruits (never mind tropical) in the house, so we ate it by itself. I made it in individual ramekins and had to bake it a total of 40 minutes. It was perfectly cooked, smooth and creamy. I will make this again.

Normally I really enjoy this recipe, but I decided to try some of the advice provided and if you cook at 200F for an hour and a half it doesn't work. So just follow the recipe, it tastes much better

It is so annoying when people review a recipe by putting in their own version. I can honestly review this recipe because I have made it MANY times in the past. Creme brulee is my favorite dessert so I always order it when I'm having dessert out but it almost NEVER compares to this recipe when I make it at home. It's so easy, you can't mess it up; it's so smooth and creamy that I rarely find a restaurant version that is this smooth. Of course, I make it with a good quality vanilla bean and fresh ginger, which absolutely makes this exceptional.

I've been making this recipe for over 10 years and my family and friends love it. It does take a bit of fussing and I make a few adjustments: needs a pinch of salt, strain twice, and take out of the oven between 170-175 degrees.

As I just read that Paul Bocuse is honored as the chaf of the century by the American Culinary Institute (and I love his recipes, having lived in France for 11 years!) I had to look up what he had to say about crème brûlée. He is the man who made the 17th century recipe trendy again in the 80's! So here is his recipe: For 6 guests: 10 egg yolks 250 gr of caster sugar 1 litre of dairy cream (30%) 1 vanilla pod 40 gr of brown sugar Direction : Open the vanilla pod. Take the grains out and put them in the cream. Start heating slowly. Mix the egg yolks and the caster sugar in a large bowl until the mixture becomes a light yellow colour. Add the boiling vanilla cream as you mix, making sure that the mixture does not become too bubbly. Then delicately pour this new mixture through a conical sieve (always make sure that there are no bubbles forming when you make creamy desserts). Preheat the oven at 200°F (100°C). Delicately pour the creme into small individual porcelaine or terracotta molds. Cook for 1 hour and 15 min, the creme should not be cooked all the way. Leave to cool for 10 minutes in the water before taking them out and cooling in fridge for 4 hours or overnight. Cover with brown sugar when you serve. There are 3 ways you can caramelize your cremes: Either placing them on the oven grill, using a blowlamp or, as the fine culinary practice has it, with a white hot iron.

All French recipes and crème brûlée is French!) require the custard to be baked in the oven for 1 hour at 212°C. I tried this recipe, and it was no good. There was absolutely no smoothness in this custard. The baking time is too short ant too high a temperature. Next time I will try the French version, and hopefully find the smoothness of my favourite dessert in the Monte Carlo Tennis club restaurant.

I agree with StewieStevie, the addition of orange zest knocks this one out of the park.

This is very good! I made the recipe exactly as written except for the baking times. You really have to watch them and shake the pan lightly to see how set the custard is. It should look like jello when you shake them. The amount fit perfectly into 4 7 oz ramekins. The ginger flavor was a nice change from the usual plain vanilla, but I think next time I'll leave it out.

I disagree with the reviewer below me, this recipe was EXCELLENT. The vanilla bean flavor jumps out at you and the ginger is subtle but pronounced enough to be recognizable. I didn't have enough ramekins to make 10 servings, so I modified the recipe and made a simple tart shell version with the leftovers. This was also fantastic. My family and friends at Thanksgiving dinner claimed it was the best creme brulee they'd ever tasted, and we've all tasted many versions! I loved how this recipe was also economical. I spent well over $150 on all the food for Thanksgiving and this dessert was only about $6 to make (including the expensive vanilla beans). Simple recipe with fantastic results. The only issue I had was with browning the sugar and creating a nice crackle shell like restaurants do. I still have to master this.

Best creme brulee ever! I always serve this as a dessert when we have friends over for a casual dinner. It's easy and they always love it. (I do the no ginger version). I also throw in the entire vanilla bean during the simmer stage and strain it out, plus I add a tsp vanilla extract. Always fabulous.

Rating: 3
This was very easy to make. I did not use vanilla bean and I can easily believe that addition would have made it 4 forks for me. I much prefer epicurious' egg nog creme brulee, but that is just me. Either way, it was very good. I did double it and make it in one large pan (I always do this with creme brulee) and I used turbinado sugar for the topping and opted to use the broiler on the middle rack to brown the top---another always for me.

This recipe was AWESOME. The instructions are very easy to follow, and the resulting dish was far better than I had expected. I found that it made slightly more than I had expected, so pay attention to the size of your ramekins and plan accordingly. I thought the ginger was an excellent addition to this traditional custard. It was not overpowering; it provided a subtle fresh aroma, and the mellow flavor harmoniously blended with the vanilla bean. I would not substitute vanilla extract either; the vanilla bean is key. I found some for a very good price in the organic produce section of my local grocery store. The first time I made this, I found that it made a very nice finish to a meal of seared ahi tuna on a bed of mixed greens with a gingered soy reduction. The second time I made it was at my parents' house, and I learned that it is really important to "know your oven." Make sure you check the consistency instead of just relying on cook times. Also make sure you chill it for enough time!! Anyways, best creme brulee I've had. And I'm a huge snob.

Rating: 4
I tried the classic version (no ginger) of this recipe and it is is delicious!!! However, The first time I made this, the crème brulee was delicious in flavor but extremely stiff, the texture of what came out was similar to a cheesecake! So I tried the recipe again and cut all cooking times in half. The result was amazing! I will definitely make this again. Id just recommend watching the baking time closely and gently shaking the ramekins every once in a while until you see that the edges are firm but the center is almost set instead of relying on the cooking time displayed in this recipe.

This is an excellent creme brulee recipe. I made it plain- no ginger like many of the others. I only went wrong with the sugar on the top...I have a new super hot torch and sizzled the top which left a middle layer of raw sugar. Next time I will use less sugar on top and put the torch on a lower setting...or even broil in the oven.

This was the first creme brulee that I've made, and it was fantastic! I served it for dessert at our annual New Year's Day soup and salad lunch and everyone loved it! Ginger is one of my favorite flavors, and it added a wonderful depth of flavor! Will definitely make this again.

I made this for a New Year's dinner and it was incredible! I'm just getting my feet wet in the kitchen and this was actually a pretty easy dessert to make. The only downside is the number of servings suggested by the recipe (6), only filled 3 of my 4" ramekins, so plan accordingly.

No surprise here - this is a phenomenal recipe. I made this for a French dinner party 6 weeks ago, and the guests have been asking for it every time they come over just for a casual weekday dinner ever since!

I made this recipe for valentines day. I used it as a base for saffron creme brulee and it was heavenly! very rich and creamy. I had to tweak it just a bit because for me it was pretty heavy i would use 1 cup whipping cream and 1 cup half and half next time and a little less sugar because the with the carmel topping it became super sweet. this is a recipe im definitly keeping and making again. very flexible recipe.

I went with the classic creme brulee version. And oh my delectable! It was ever so lovely. For those that must rely on the broiler and are using ramekins, I would go with one teaspoon of sugar per dish--instead of two. The sugar topping was a bit thick. Still, pure heaven on the tongue.

Of all the creme brulee recipes out there, this is the only one in my recipe box, and the one I use each and every time. My husband is a creme brulee fanatic, and is now utterly spoiled because this one comes out better than in any restaurant--he likes the richer, eggier flavour. He, however, doesn't like ginger so I usually omit it, or divide the cream and infuse only half. I've successfully use cardamom as well, for sort of an Indian-styled variant. For really rich flavours I very gently heat the cream up to just barely a simmer.

I followed this recipe pretty much exactly as written (using white sugar and a blowtorch to brown sugar) with excellent results. I did end up taking it out of the oven a bit earlier (about 28 minutes) because I used very shallow ramekins. The flavor of real vanilla is so delicious- and with this creamy, elegant dessert it is definitely worth using real vanilla beans if you have them. There is just a hint of ginger flavor- perfect for my husband but I would have liked it a little stronger. I do love strong flavors, and I love ginger, so be warned before you add more :) Perhaps next time I would mince the ginger instead of chopping it, or I would add a little more, but only if I was making it for myself. My mother-in-law thought it was a bit sweet, perhaps because my ramekins are shallow which produces a high caramelized-top-to-custard ratio. We made another creme brulee recipe later the same weekend (chai creme brulee from another site), and the texture seemed mealy in comparison to the lovely, smooth texture of this recipe. Two tips: I plucked the ramekins out of the water bath using OXO tongs, which worked very well. Also, tropical fruits are in short supply in November, so I topped with kumquats, strips of mango, and a sprig of mint which looked quite nice.

This is not only great as it is, but a perfect base recipe for many other flavors when you omit the ginger and vanilla bean. I have made it this way, and also with instant coffee (the favorite of everyone), with orange zest and 1 teaspoon vanilla, and just plain old vanilla bean. The only change I made after the first batch was to lower the sugar content to 1/3 cup---I like it less sweet. I also only make this in 2 oz. ramekins (1/2 the size of the usual individual portion). Making them tiny permits guests to sample more than one without all of that messy guilt. The consistency of this is rich and creamy. Just perfect for all creme brulee lovers!

Amazing! this is my never fail, super easy dessert. You really cannot mess up this recipe, only 5 simple ingredients! I recommend using organic raw sugar, it has an amazing, rich taste that really kicks up the flavor of the creme brulee.

Made exactly as per recipe, with ginger, and didn't find it overpowering. Using a vanilla bean is a must. I thought I had over baked it, as after 30 minutes, it appeared to be more than just set, but when it came to eating it, it was just fine. I used regular white granulated sugar, which caramelized nicely. I didn't have a micro torch, and didn't want to attempt broiling it, so I used my husband's propane torch, which worked great. I figured that was OK, since I've seen several photos of chefs using a substantial torch to do the same thing. As for portion size, I found that it was just right, as per the recipe. The dessert is so rich, that I really wouldn't want to eat more of it, especially after a meal. I also liked the amount of sugar topping as suggested. A thin,crisp wafer of caramelized sugar, which shatters at the touch of a spoon, is what you end up with, which I find to be quite elegant.

Oh so good! I am making it again as I type this. The ginger is the key ingredient to this, without it, it's just plain old Creme Brulee, not that that's a bad thing. You need a mico grater, or a japanese ginger grater to get the ginger to a paste like consistency. Once it all cooks up together, you don't get chunks of ginger, just the delicious spicy flavor. And, it's just so easy, and so elegant. A real winner.

Texture was wonderful though and it was VERY easy to make. Will certainly make it again (and again) but will think twice about the ginger (maybe cut it down in half?).

Amazing! Big props to Denver who suggested using egg whites. As an experiment, I made a half batch with yolk, a half batch with white.

Try it for yourself- you will not be sorry. p.s.: Ditto on the quantity-- I would add extra cream next time.

This recipe really makes the best creme brulee. Like most people, I always omit the ginger and make a vanilla creme brulee. It is PERFECT. No need to change anything- it's right on. The result is a thick, creamy, yummy, vanilla creme brulee that your guests will die for. It's simple enough to make just for yourselves too! I use a kitchen torch for a good crust without liquefying the custard. Only one restaurant that I have been to makes it as good as this (and we have been all over the country).

I've made this recipe several times, omitting ginger each time. The first time I made it, it was wonderful. The second time, I did not enjoy it at all.

I've never reverted back to egg yolks & everyone absolutely raves about my vanilla creme brulee....made with egg whites!

To broil or not to broil?...Well, I didn't have a kitchen torch and so broiled them for my French themed "Gourmet Group" night. I kept my fingers crossed as my ramikins were oven-safe only to 500 degrees. They were fine and turned out FANTASTIC! Everyone commented that they preferred them right out of the oven with the custard warm. We all agreed that the first time we tried creme brulee we thought the restaurant didn't cook it long enough as it was cold inside (though this is the traditional way to serve). Just a matter of preference I guess...BTW - I definitely agree to triple the amount of sugar on top for a nice thick crust!

I always use this recipe to make classic creme brulee, omitting the ginger. A tip as far as quantities ~ when I first made it, it was only enough for 4 ramekins, these were 7 oz. ramekins.

Excellent. Omit the ginger and fruit and make the classic. My friends bring vanilla beans and beg me to make it. Use the real beans even if you must pay for them. The small black seeds really infuse their flavor. It is much simpler to make than I expected although I do make the custard a day ahead. Torch them no more than 2 or 3 hours before serving to prevent the caramalized sugar from liquefying. Refrigerate afterward. The ramekins are a nice finishing touch providing equal servings. My friends now think I can cook.

Delicious flavor; I think it could even stand a little more ginger. I was worried about serving too much fruit alongside, but the thick consistency and rich flavor could hold up to even more. I agree with one reviewer who suggested it might be a bit too thick. Will leaving out one egg yolk help? I might try it next time.

This recipe is both simple and easy, and yields a delctable product. I will definitely be adding it to my cooking repertoire! (I omitted the ginger and used ordinary, granular sugar both in the recipe and for the crust and found that the results were fantastic.)

I found that using raw sugar seems to work the best, and defintely invest in a small torch!!

Absolutely delicious! The ginger gives an exotic flair to the dessert. I had the best results using ultra fine sugar for the crust. Try putting regular white sugar in the food processor if you can't find it in the grocery store.

Made this for our Christmas dinner dessert. The custard was a little too firm - may leave out one yolk or cut down baking time next time. Didn't use ginger - just vanilla bean - and flavor was excellent. Think I'll be investing in a small blow torch, though, since broiling was uneven.

Rating: 3
Good overall, but will make some changes the next time: Use 1.5 cups whipping cream and 1/2 cups milk (it's just too rich with all cream)and increase baking time slightly. Use 1/2 vanilla bean only, as the taste is very concentrated and tends to overpower. The only sugar that works for me is white, as stated in the recipe. The crust was fabulous. I first tried brown sugar as suggested by a reviewer, but it burned, rather than caramelized when torched. I added a few raspberries (fresh or defrosted) before filling the dishes and this added a nice contrast to the sweetness of the dish.

Rating: 4
I have made this both with and without the ginger. I prefer it without the ginger, as it tends to cut the rich vanilla taste that using the vanilla bean gives the creme brulee. This is a very easy recipe and yeilds great results. I prefer to use brown sugar, as its flavor compliments the vanilla nicely.

Absolutely wonderful! This was the easiest and most delicious creme brulee recipe I've ever tryed. The ginger gives it just enough flavor to make it yummy!!

This is by far the easiest recipe for a 5 star creme brulee. One important note; Use a kitchen torch to brown the sugar crust. If you try to put it under a broiler, the entire dessert becomes warm and I prefer the custard cold. Outstanding!

Eureka. Have finally found a straight forward receipe for Creme Brulee that works. Did not add the Ginger. This is some of the best I have ever had.

Fabulous. Incredibly smooth and delicious. I found that it isn't necessary to chop the ginger. Just slicing a peeled chunk into fairly large pieces worked fine for the infusion, and is easier to strain out. Also used only one tsp of sugar on top for browning, and it came out very light and delicate.

Great recipe. Tastes just like the ones served in chic bistros. I omitted the ginger for the classic vanilla taste. Don't torch too long as it can make topping a little too crunchy.

I had to make this twice because the first time I think I overcooked it. I doubled the recipe and because I didn't have ramekins, I had to resort to baking this in one pan. I baked it for 45 minutes and it came out just right. Guests loved it and claimed it was better than the ones they've had at chi-chi French restaurants. I bought a torch from Costco as suggested from others and I didn't realize that no butane came with it! It was quite a comical sight as I had cleared out the counter, with my husband at my side in case of catastrophe, stepped through the instructions slowly and carefully, and...no flame! My husband had to make a quick run to the hardware store to buy a can.

This is the best creme brulee recipe! I have tried about ten and nothing copares to the easy simplicity of this particular recipe. Sometimes I leave out the ginger, I find it doesn't make much difference in the rave reviews I get. And if there's any doubt, a torch is a much for the perfect creme brulee. Better than any fancy restaurant, just be sure to follow the recipe EXACTLY.

I have made this countless times sans the ginger. Everyone loves it. Usually put blackberries/raspberries in bottom of ramekins and then pour custard over...heavenly! Of course, carmelizing the sugar crust with a blow torch just puts it over the top. Highly recommend.

This was darn good!!! It was a big hit - my boyfriend and I loved it. I used two big ramekins and made two large restaurant-sized custards for sharing. Yummy with no ginger. So easy to make - just remember vanilla beans are pricey (I was shocked).

I too left out the ginger so I could have classic creme brulee. I made mine in six 6 oz. ramekins, but next time I will purchase the more shallow dish so the top could have more of the brulee topping. Using the ramekins I had to cook them for an hour in the oven and even afer that and chilling in the fridge for about four hours, the consistency was not quite right, so I should have cooked them longer I'm guessing. Used my new hand held kitchen torch and tried the topping w/ both brown and white sugar-brown sugar works the best. I used a fresh vanilla bean and the beautiful specks of the bean and flavor is unsurpassed.

I've had creme brulee at some very fine restaurants, and this is as good as any I've had. I baked mine for 45-50 minutes instead of 30, although it may just be my oven. I also used superfine sugar for the creme brulee, but I don't know that it really makes a difference. It was definately a crowd pleaser.

This is my second attempt at creme brulee. I can't remember where my first recipe came from, but it looked good and tasted awful, so I hesitated to try another. This was EXCELLENT and just what I was hoping for. This was even using vanilla extract and without a torch. Will definitely make again.

I was intimidated by the idea of making creme brulee at home, but it turned out easier than I would have imagined. This was my first creme brulee, and I may not ever make another one - why search further when you've found perfection? I've made it twice now, and if not for the rather excessive fat and calorie content, I'd make it once a week. The flavor is subtle and delightful, and even a non-ginger fan loved it.

With out a doubt the easiest creme brulee recipe I have tried. Anyone who doesn't like it either changed the recipe or doesn't know what a real creme brulee should be like. The ginger adds another wrinkle to the smooth creamy texture with the crunch of the sugar brulee. Hat's off to this one.

I am not going to rate this because maybe I did something wrong after reading how much everyone here loves it. I thought it was terrible. I love creme brulee and was so disapointed with the flavor and texture as well color. I did not use the ginger as I wanted a plain brulee. I used vanilla beans and whip cream and thought the flavor was border line scalded. If I messed that up then that's my fault, but the texture was not as thick and custard like as it should have been. The color was way off too. Way too yellow, I think it should be more a cream color than yellow. I am still in search of the perfect recipe... Please write me with any hints to a better brulee!

Rating: 3
This was a delicious dish, but it was my own fault that it was not outstanding. I substituted half and half for the cream, and my guests and I agreed the dish needed the richness of the cream. (I have the 4-ounce ramekins, so the recipe really does make six servings; since the servings are small we can better afford the luxury of the cream!) We also believed that the ginger was too subtle and was overwhelmed by the wonderful flavor of the vanilla bean. The next time, I am only going to add one-half of a vanilla bean. I also wish I had heeded the recommendation to use only one teaspoon of sugar for the topping, which turned out too thick. Next time, I'll know what to do!

My dinner guests would have awarded 5 stars if they could. First, I agree with Ken of Phoenix, AZ, that 1 scant teaspoon of sugar is plenty for a nice delicate crust on top. I used 1 teaspoon vanilla, and only half of the ginger. I couldn't detect any ginger taste, so next time I'll add the full amount of ginger. All are correct who say that the recipe more accurately serves 4 rather than 6. When filling a baking dish with hot water, I always lay a piece of waxed paper on top of the ramekins to avoid any water spills in the custard. This dessert was the conclusion to a dinner of Calypso Roast Pork with corn and bean salad and Mexican Rice with Mint (all recipes on this site), served with my own sour cream cornbread plus fried sweet plantains which come frozen (Goya brand).

I've tested this recipe against many other creme brulee recipes, and this one consistently comes out on top. To save a few calories and fat grams, I've successfuly swapped whole milk for half of the heavy cream. If you have the time, split the vanilla bean, scrape out the seeds and infuse both in 1 cup of heavy cream for a day or two before you continue with the recipe. Finally, my niece loves this brulee even more when I put fresh raspberries in the bottom of the ramekin before baking. Use a tiny bit of raspberry jam on the bottom of each ramekin to "glue" the berries down and be sure to place them on their sides so they don't peek through the top of the brulee. Carefully pour in the brulee mixture and bake as directed.

Delicious. Made this as a dessert when friends were over and they were beyond amazed. I made it without the ginger because I wanted a traditional creme brulee (a meal of this site's coq au vin and garlic mashed potatoes). The fresh vanilla bean adds a richness and complexity of flavor. Easy to do, but I'd recommend making the custard the night before.

I will make this again as I love creme brulee but I think I made a few mistakes. The ginger flavor was stronger than I would have liked( used two generous tbls) I also didn't caramelize the sugar long enough ( I didn't want it to burn) even though I bought a nifty little kitchen torch to use. My husband thought it was very sweet but it was because of the sugar on top. Any way it all disappeared, Next time I'll know better .

Made this for Valentine's dinner - my husband flipped! I'd give this five forks if I could. Don't omit the ginger, it gives it a mysterious and compelling flavor. It's better than any I've had in a restaurant. Made four generous servings. We're having the rest tonight - can't wait!

In an earlier review, I said the ginger flavor was subtle-I've changed my mind. When I made this before, I used the ginger root I store in a jar of sherry. This time, I used fresh ginger root, and the ginger is NOT subtle. We liked it, but might be a bit much for some.

Awesome creme brulee! I've made this twice this month for two dinner parties - friends loved it. I left out the ginger. To avoid bubbles, I removed the foam with a large spoon before dividing the custard into the ramekins -- I had no bubbles in the creme brulee even with whisking! Definitely a keeper for me as well.

Fabulous rendition of this increasingly popular dessert. Smooth consistency. I have made this with and without the ginger with equally satisfying results. When making this with ginger, I recommend using kiwi - it compliments the subtle spicy flavor of the custard. You may also substitute 1 t vanilla extract and 1 1/2 t ground ginger for their more time-consuming coutnerparts in the recipe. The results are delicious. Definitely a keeper!

I didn't use the ginger as I was looking for a classic creme brulee and didn't fork out the $$$ for the vanilla bean but I did go and get pure vanilla extract and used heavy whipping cream instead of regular. I also took the advice of another cook and reduced the amount of sugar from 1/2 cup to 1/3. This is a keeper.

I must have prepared this recipe at least a half-dozen times since discovering it on 12/31/99. I have omitted the ginger up until the last time I made it...WOW. I did not think that ginger belonged in creme brulee; I was mistaken. The ginger gives this dish the perfect balance to its sweetness. INCREDIBLE...it does not pay to eat creme brulee out anymore...I make it better at home! (Hint: Great Quality Blow Torches are available in the plumbing section of major hardware stores...A WORTHWILE INVESTMENT!)

This was relatively easy even for a beginner like me,and went very well with the fresh blackberry topping I made. Next time I would use less sugar for the crust. Two teaspoons was a bit much. A scant tsp would make a very nice delicate crust on top with a lot less torch time.

Good, but I was not overwhelmed. I did not have access to a blowtorch, so I tried using my broiler. I left the creme brulees in the oven for about 3-4 minutes, but the tops never browned properly. Maybe I put them too close to the top of the oven. The custard was still smooth and creamy underneath, though. I'll try these again, but this time, I'll invest in a handheld blowtorch so that I can get the pretty caramelized tops! Oh, and I also think the recipe is off with the portion sizes too, especially since the custard settles down during the baking process. I ended up squeezing 5 portions out of this recipe using 3/4-cup ramekins, but I think 4 would have been more proper.

Rating: 4
I made this for a dinner party & it got rave reviews. I didn't have access to the blowtorch (long story) to do tops, but the broil unit on my stove worked fairly well. I'd recommend that if you don't have a torch & use a broiler, superfine sugar would work best for tops. I am usually a fan of the Maida Heatter type creme brulee that uses cream and eggs but not as much sugar as this recipe--custardy but not too sweet. But guess extra sugar is needed 2ndary to flavorings.

The first time I made this recipe without the ginger and used 1 teaspoon vanilla extract instead of the vanilla beans. It turned out great. The second time I used one teaspoon chopped ginger and it was even better. I don't think I would use 2 teaspoons, the ginger was noticeable enough with 1 teaspoon.

The first time I made this dish, I used only half the ginger, since my SO doesn't usually like its flavor. Great that way, and he adored it. The second time, I used the recommended 2 T and it was even better. Made it for dinner guests, and dressed each with an almond lace cookie (also on epicurious.com), a chunk of crystallized ginger, a sprig of fresh mint, and some cantaloupe balls soaked in grand marnier. Fantastic reception! This one is a definite keeper.

A great recipe. I agree that the portions are better suited to 4 servings in ramekins. If so, increase the cooking time; mine was a little loose after 35 minutes. I also used the broiler to brown the sugar with the cups in ice water to prevent the custard from breaking. This method worked out fine.

An incredible creme brulee recipe! I tried it twice, once with the recommended amount of ginger, and then again with only 1-1/4 tbsp ginger. I preferred the latter, because the ginger taste isn't quite so strong; cutting back the ginger back gave the brulee more of the "whisper of ginger" that I wanted. Either with ginger or without, this is a fabulous recipe.

I'd lost my old standby creme brulee recipe (which, up to that point, I thought was pretty darned outstanding) and needed one in a pinch. Luckily I found this recipe on-line. It blew my old recipe out of the water!!! I left out the ginger, opting for a classic creme brulee, and used the broiler instead of a blow torch. The results were perfect. It was smooth, rich and creamy, with exquisite flavor and just the right amount of crunch in the top-shell. I also liked the use of white sugar in the topping as opposed to the traditional brown; it gave the hard topping a glassier, more refined finish.

It is a wonderful dessert to top off any meal...I ended our prime rib dinner with this satisfying and EASY version. I omitted the ginger and opted to not caramalize the top in exchange for a rasberry puree and fresh blackberries on top. The combination was superb. I cooked it for exactly 30 minutes and I think it was overcooked. I think the water I added to the 9x13 pan was too hot (it had been boiling. Next time I will not get the water so hot and not fill it with so much water. Otherwise rich and creamy.

We had friends at dinner from as far away as India, some who were French and some German and, this very cosmopolitan group was most impressed. This is by far - as good as it gets.

Made this recipe for a dinner party or 8 and everyone wanted to lick their dishes! They all wanted the recipe. I used 4" ramkins for each person and therefore, doubled the recipe. I thought the usual small ramkins would not satisfy and I was right, they all wanted even more with the large ones. I decorated them with kiwi and mango slices placed on one side and raspberry coullis swirlled this. Carol Nanoose Bay , B.C. Canada

I got rave reviews from my guests with this one! It was easy, perfectly smooth with a rich, unusual taste, and most of the work was done in advance. I don't think I'll ever need another creme brulee recipe.

Incredibly easy to make with results that seem to suggest formal training at Le Cordon Bleu! This recipe has become my kids' favorite. I know I will be making it for many years to come. (and boy don't I love playing with the blowtorch!)

This Creme Brulee recipe is better than any creme brulee recipe I have tried before!

Made this recipe with and without the ginger at the same time. Though I was skeptical, the ginger was the bigger hit. Everyone I have prepared it for has asked for the recipe. It has become my husbands favorite dessert.

This is a fabulous creme brulee! I too left out the ginger as I have tried 3-4 times to make this dessert in its traditional form using other recipes. Finally, a recipe which is easy and reliable. A favorite!

BEST I'VE HAD SINCE NEW YORK CITY!!! OMITTED THE GINGER AND PLACED A FEW RASPBERRIES IN THE CREME AS IT SET. DID THE BRULEE UNDER THE BROILER, WORKED JUST FINE. THIS IS DEFINATELY A WINNER, AGAIN, AND AGAIN, AND AGAIN.........

Absolutely decadent! So simple yet so delicious. The texture is a smooth & creamy delight for the tastebuds! A perfect dessert for a dinner party. I left out the ginger but will try it next time. Made ours the day before the party & it kept wonderfully in the fridge. Served a Raspberry Coulis over it which only added to the already wonderful flavor. Definately a keeper!!!

I have tried various creme brulee recipes (my husband's favorite dessert!) and this is the best one out there. I did omit the ginger, but plan to try it this way as well.

"Simple elegance" best describes this dish. I omitted the ginger this time, and topped the dishes with fresh raspberries, and blackberries for the tamer palates at the table, but next time I'll add it for some zest. My hand held brazing torch made for great dinner conversation while still allowing me to allowing me to carmelize the sugar. "Food is Life"

This Creme Brulee is terrific. The Ginger and Vanilla Bean give that extra special treat for dinner party.
