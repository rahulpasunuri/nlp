It must be just me but this recipe turned out awful for me- though I followed it to the T. It actually made the house smell like we stepped in some dog's you know what. Also, the balls fell apart the second they hit oil. I will leave the falafel making to the professionals. Really disappointed.

Soak the beans a full day, took suggestions about increasing herbs but not spices and loved the results. Also, highly recommend the refrigerate step. Much easier to work with.

Ok, so I made this with fresh fava beans (I boiled and peeled them before using) and it came out awful. As someone else mentioned, the mixture was too sticky to make into balls unless you refrigerate it. Also when I fried them, the sesame seeds burned and fell off but for some reason the inside of the balls didn't cook. I basically ended up with fried sesame seeds around a center of raw green mush. Did I miss something here?

I can't give this a rating, as I've not even tried it yet, but I'm SO excited to see that this starts with fava beans and not garbanzo beans. I'm so sick of fake falafel. =) I'll be back to review. And just in time for lent!

I thought this tasted rather bland with the pinto beans I used. Perhaps it really needs fava beans, although an Egyptian restaurant owner told me that origanally kidney beans or chick peas are used. Anyway, my falafel had a very dry consistency and didn't really stay together while frying. The cilantro gave them a nice twist though, because I had used double the amount. I had also added some sesame oil which was nice.

the best falafel in the world

Now I know what I was doing wrong. Its a good idea to let the mixture rest in the refrigirator before cooking. I usualy add some red pepper to give it more punch.

I lived in Egypt for a summer, and I have tried several ta'miyya recipes. This one, by far, is the best with some alterations. My husband kissed me, stating it was the best felafel he ever ate!! What I do is up the spices. I use at least 1 tsp. salt, extra baking powder, extra cumin, extra cilantro, one onion minced fine, etc. to taste. I fry one small felafel, and adjust seasonings to taste. The sesame seeds to me are not authentic to the area in Egypt where I lived, but they do add a nice nutty flavor. However, I would probably leave it out next time. This makes a great sandwich! Stuff them into halved, warmed pita breads with tehina, diced cukes & sliced tomatoes. YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!

It is easy to make, healthy and inexpensive. I am sick and tired of eating meat and chicken, I think we need more healthy recipes like this one. Good job and thank you.
