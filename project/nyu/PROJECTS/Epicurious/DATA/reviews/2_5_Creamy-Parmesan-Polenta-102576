Most of the polenta recipes on this site are good bases for polenta. Even this recipe was pretty bland. I added about 1/2 cup more of parmesan, gray salt, 1 bulb (that's right BULB!) of roasted garlic, and 1/2 large white onion, diced and carmelized. Served with with pork chops. Now that's polenta.
