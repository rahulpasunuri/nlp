This was easy, quick and very delicious with a great combination of sweetness from the sugar and the tang of the onion.

Tried a new way to make corn bread: Add grated cheddar cheese (1/2 cup or so), chopped jalapeno; added 1/2 cup of coarse cornmeal as part of the 2 cups of cornmeal. Did not have buttermilk so made non-fat sour milk. The best part: cook this is a Belgian waffle iron coated with non-stick spray for 9-10 minutes - crunchy, perfect with chili (or black-eyed pea soup for New Year's Day)! My husband loved this - makes plain old cornbread more interesting.

I added corn and adjusted for high altitude, but still, the cornbread was dry. I was going for a cornbread somewhat like that at the Bandera restaurant, but no such luck with this one. It wasn't bad though.

Tried this with a bowl of hearty beany chili and my husband and I were blown away! I also added 1/2 cup of canned drained corn, decreased the sugar to 1/4 and used just 3/4 stick of butter. Yum!

This was a nice light easy to make corn bread. I added about 3/4 cup of corn - and used just 1/2 the butter called for as I am on a lowfat diet.

Very good (and smells great cooking). I don't like the "sweet" cornbreads so common to the Western states, so I tried this with the white cornmeal I prefer. It's delicious.

Absolutely great. Easy to make. I've made it several time & everyone loves it.
