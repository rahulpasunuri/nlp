This was amazing! Used coconut milk instead of cream and added a little tomato paste as well...barely made it to the table as we all stood around the island eating the mussels and soaking up the sauce with hunks of bread. Definitely a keeper

I liked the lime addition. Also added a clove of minced garlic and 1 teaspoon of sweet paprika. Used 1/2 hot curry powder and 1/2 Thai curry herbs. I made them for my girlfriend and she said they were the absolutely the best she has ever had. And I had to agree. Incredibly delicious!! I'll try the coconut milk next time.

Another equally important addition I forgot to mention...fresh squeezed lime juice over the finished dish. Excellent!

Truly an exquisite dish, however, I added a couple ingredients and omitted the sherry. With the addition of fresh garlic, ginger, white wine, and coconut milk the wild green mussels finished nicely. This dish is now christened as one of my top ten!

I questioned the use of "curry powder" in reading this receipe. Traditionally curry receipes state the individual spices used in preparation, and do not use a premixed powder. I was right! I frequently serve mussels, but found this dish to be bland and boring. I will not make it again.

This was wonderful and simple! I only had Jamaican curry on-hand, so ended up doubling it to up the curry flavor and added Turkish Marash pepper flakes for heat. I added thinly sliced onion and red pepper to the sauce I piled the mussels onto basmati rice. This will be a new staple in my house for certain!

I have made this dish many times and it's my favorite way to serve mussels. In fact, it's superior to any dish I've had at a restuarant. Easy to prepare and incrediblely delicious. Good bread is a must to soak up the yummy sauce.

Superb - quick, spicy and delicious! Everyone loved it. Caution: your mother-in-law will come back for more!

I made this whole recipe in 30 does it get better than that. I doubled the curry powder also and used basil instead of cilantro because of an obstinate man who refuses to eat cilantro. Still it was delicious served over Asian noodles.

I agree with all previous reviews. The best thing about this recipe by far is the easy factor, especially compared to some of the other curry mussel recipes on this site. Perfect for when you come home tired from work, but still want a slightly more ambitious dinner.

This was really good! I doubled the curry powder and red pepper, and the heat was still not overwhelming, but nice. Next time I'm going to make rice, I think it would be fantastic that way!

Wonderful recipe. Very tasty but I didn't add water as the cream provides enough liquid. Will definitely make it again and for guests next time.

A very nice recipe, and quite easy to make. I made it several times, varying the intensity of the curry. It was easy to dial up or dial down the spiciness, which makes the dish adaptable.

My husband just loved this! I thought it was good. I usually try to follow a recipe exactly the first time I make it. Next time I won't add the water to this, so that the sauce will be thicker.

This was really good. I stopped at the store after work to buy mussels, got home and found out my husband had a friend coming over, cooked up some rice to serve it over and had it all on the table in no time. Everyone thought it was delicious and unusual. Even my four year-old ate the mussels!

The second time I prepared this, I substituted red curry paste for the curry powder and red pepper flakes. We liked this version better. I used P.E.I. mussels and found that some of them did need to be debearded, despite being told that this is not necessary.

My husband is French so we eat mussel dishes alot! He loved this dish more than I did, but I will definetly try it again. Prince Edward Mussels are very clean no beards or dirt to scrub.

Mussels are a long tradition in my family, though we usually serve them baked as an appetizer. I served this recipe to the whole family on the 4th of July holiday (don't really care if the recipe originated in France...weren't they allies of the U.S during the rvolutionary war anyway) and it was definitely the hit of the meal. Wonderful combination of flavors. Will definitely make it again, but sure wish someone would invent a mussel that was easier to clean and had a longer shelf life! Maybe the biotech industry will figure out how!

I found it not quite spicy, but just nice and "warm" from the seasonings - good counterpart to the richness of the butter and cream. P.S. - Tough crowd! Or should that be a leisurely crowd? One pompous little comment results in so much reaction!

Followed this recipe to the letter and didn't find it particularly spicy, although it was delicious. I guess I was expecting the heat level of Thai mussels. But hey, this ain't a Mouclade so I guess it doesn't reign supreme!

This is a version of the classic mussel dish from the Charente-Maritime part of France, called Mouclade, except they don't use coriander and its heavy on the cream & white wine, though it is preferable to use pineau - a sort of port from that region. Any combination of mussels/curry flavor/ cream is a hit in my opinion. There'a a Moroccan version in this month's Food & Wine (lastpage) for those interested in yet another variation (with tomatoes & saffron). I've done them all, they are all yummy - but mouclade still reigns supreme ...

Over all, pretty darn tasty. Next time I think I'll try it with white wine instead of the sherry, and parsley instead of cilantro. Would it be overkill if I replaced the water with wine? BTW, I, too, thought the person from UK was a bit pretentious and didn't offer any insights about this particular recipe, but to each his/her own, I guess...

Yummy, easy, quick!! I was getting ready to leave town (AGAIN) and wanted to do a special meal for my husband before I left. This was perfect -- no hassles, twenty minutes to prepare, and he felt like a lucky guy. I served it over rice with a salad and crusty bread.

Hey, guys, you can have any knowledge if you don't despise the source. The person from the UK had some interesting information on the history and variations of the dish. I, for one, am interested in the details. If necessary, the details can be checked against other sources. This is an information site, not a flaming site.

Please lighten up on the cook from Springfield. I thought the UK writer's comments sounded pretentious. Not sure what point he or she was trying to make.

Good. This recipe tastes equally great with shrimps. A dash of lemon juice will add a little tang.

This was delightful! I used a Bùrgen Blaufrankisch (Ochs) instead of Sherry, and this worked beautifully.

The recipe calls for 2# of mussels, I'm not fond of Sherry so I used White Wine.

I have not made the dish because it doesn't state how many (either by count or pounds) of muscles to prepare.
