MINE IS THE ONLY ACTUAL REVIEW: Other 11 reviews are complete substitutions. Made as written it is very good. Perhaps Americans dont like Calamari, fresh calamari, grilled until slightly crispy on the curly edges and served with the vinaigrette was delicious.

wow--they actually used parmigiano-reggiano on squid? sacrilege it really serves no purpose with delicate squid, peas and leeks

I made this a vegetarian meal by making just the risotto, and using vegetable stock. I added a bit of lemon juice to the risotto at the end of cooking it to brighten the flavor a bit. The risotto was light and tasty, and we enjoyed it greatly. I loved the leeks in this and could have gladly used a third leek. It's really easy to make as well. Will make again!

I had leftover shrimp, so I used that. We don't have a grill pan--we have a grill. My husband and I loved it--it was delicate and green. Wish i had some fresh peas to put in it. Tastes like Spring. I might use a little less oil next time in the dressing.

We loved this recipe. My husband is not a calamari fan so I substituted grilled shrimp and it was perfect.

"Ok" overall. Plus side -- Calamari was very tender. Minus -- I would not recommend this recipe.

I made the recipe with the calamari. I had to buy frozen. I marinated the calamari in the vinaigrette before I grilled it. I grilled it longer than instructed and I sliced it, heated the vinaigrette before tossing the sliced calamari in it. I served it separately from the risotto and let people mix as they liked. My family loved it. It is a great spring meal.

We made it. The risotto tasted better with diced zucchini than peas. The squid came out great too. I found the instructions poorly written.

I made the risotto as described. Delicious. Made Sesame chicken to accompany and the combination was good! there were only three of us eating, so the leftover rice became fried rice balls the next day. Very good too. Arancini!

Made the recipe as written. The risotto was a big hit, delicious, light, creamy and just the right amount of flavors. The squid felt like a non sequitur - it didn't go well with the risotto and wasn't that good on its own with the vinaigrette. I'm sure there are better ways to cook squid that would bring out the flavor and texture better than this, and a better complimentary side to go with squid. I would recommend cooking fish or another meat with the risotto.

I thought that this was a very yummy risotto. I also did not make the grilled calamari. Perhaps I'll do that one day when I'm feeling more adventurous.

This risotto is great! I didn't make it with the calamari, but just did a simple boneless chicken breast sauteed in some butter and olive oil with a bit of lemon to finish. The risotto as directed is perfect (I just used Swanson's broth, and can't wait to make it with my own stock).
