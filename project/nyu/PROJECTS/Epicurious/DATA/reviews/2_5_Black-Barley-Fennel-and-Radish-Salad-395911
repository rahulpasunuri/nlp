I had this at a friend's and we both agreed it needed something. I improvised on the recipe and made a slightly more aggressive dressing. I was also missing a few ingredients. The radishes would be nice to keep, was just out of them. RECIPE: 1.5 CUPS REG BARLEY (COOKED AND COOLED). 1 HALF LRG RED ONION COARSE CHOPPED. 1 FENNEL BULB COARSE CHOPPED. SAVE ALL FENNEL FRONDS AND CHOP AND LEAVE ASIDE. ROAST FENNEL AND ONION WITH OLIVE OIL AND SALT UNDER BROILER 10-12MIN. ASSEMBLY: SQUEEZE JUICE OF ONE LEMON OVER BARLEY. ADD ROASTED VEGETABLES. MINCE 1 SHALLOT -ADD TO BARLEY. CHOPPED 1/4 CUP OF KALAMATA PITTED OLIVES, ADD TO BARLEY. ADD CHOPPED FENNEL FRONDS. DRESSING IN MINI PREP: 2 CLOVES GARLIC. OLIVE OIL. JUICE AND ZEST OF ONE LEMON. COARSE SALT. GREEN TABASCO. TONS OF FRESH BLACK PEPPER. 1/2 CUP POMEGRANATE JUICE. PULSE. POUR OVER SALAD. TOSS AND SERVE.

I felt the same as the reviewer above, although we served it at a cookout, and a few of our guests went nuts for it. I said "I think it needs something" and my friend said, "yes, it needs to be eaten because it's delicious!" I still feel like it needs some kind of kick, and if anyone has suggestions, I'd be interested to know.

Hmmm... I like radishes, fennel, the citrus vinaigrette.. thought this would be a winner. Just okay. Used pearl barley and followed the recipe exactly. I did enjoy the citrus vinaigrette!
