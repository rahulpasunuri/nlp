I just made this cake for my mom's 80th birthday. It was AMAZING. I froze the cake layers until I was ready to assemble & it worked great & was easy to fill & frost. I had 2 cakes that night & this one disappeared in minuets. I enjoyed watching the chemical reactions when making the filling. I had to be patient to let the water-sugar mixture become a med-dark amber color. I will definitely make this recipe again.

I found this cake too fluffy and crumbly making it very difficult to slice neatly. Flavor was good but not appealing texture. Filling was too thin but I liked the idea of no egg yolks which most of these fillings have so I added double nuts and coconut, and it was fine. The frosting was wonderful for a powdered sugar version, very dark and shiny and easy to spread. I would use the filling and frosting again but on a better cake. Emily, a Michigan cook.

We make this cake almost every year for my husband's birthday, and everyone always loves it -- so yummy with a little vanilla ice cream! The cake is ultra rich, so a small piece goes a long way. It is very important to use good chocolate -- I tried saving money by using a cheaper chocolate a couple years ago and the result was a super sweet cake that we didn't like. The cake is very moist, so I always freeze the unfrosted layers a little before assembling everything.

Too much work, too sweet in the end.

I did what another reader suggested, and used this cake and icing mixed with the filling from the triple-chocolate layer cake found on this site. The cake was very light and the icing was great because it didn't give you that super-sweet, headachey feeling. One reviewer suggested leaving out the sour cream in the icing, and it may be a good suggestion to reduce the sour cream because it does leave a wee aftertaste. It was really smooth, though. Also, one reviewer said this cake was messy, and the cake part can be crumbly, so using the trick I learned from Martha Stewart's mag of icing the underlayer with minimal icing to catch crumbs and then refrigerating for 1/2 hour before icing with a thicker layer works very well. This also worked for a few pieces of cake that broke off -- I used icing as glue and patched a few parts, and this didn't show after I did the "primer" layer and re-iced. I also covered the icing with milk chocolate shavings which gave the cake a more interesting look. I tried some curls with a vegetable peeler but it didn't work so they became shavings. The result was really great and I'd recommend this cake to any chocolate lovers reading!

The cake and the frosting are fabulous but the filling is too, too much. We all felt sick after eating this. Our American addiction to sugar is out of control in this recipe (at the very least, use unsweetened coconut). HOWEVER, try this cake and frosting recipe with the fillings in the "Triple-Chocolate Layer Cake" recipe (also on this website) and you will have one of the best cakes you've ever had. Use good quality chocolate for the fillings - you'll be glad you did.

I made the cake and frosting exactly as the recipe said. Tasting the batter and the frosting, both had excellent rich chocolatey flavour. I was optimistic. I made the filling differently: I toasted the coconut and almonds, but instead of making caramel from scratch, I used store-bought dulce de leche, with a little salt added because I prefer salted caramel. I might have used more of the dulce de leche than the caramel recip would have made. The filling turned out amazingly delicious. I left the cakes in the oven for the full time, as my oven frequently takes a while. When I pulled them out to cool, I was thrilled because they hadn't fallen, and looked lovely. They also came out of the pans easily. However, trying to transfer them to a platter broke two of them beyond any real repair. Having spent three hours on the cake at this point, I almost cried. I managed to heap the first two (broken)layers together in some semblance of the right shape, then put all the filling on top of them. I topped it with the one unbroken layer, and frosted it. The frosting was so mushy that it almost fell off the cakes, even though they were fully cooled. I had a hard time getting the toasted nuts to stick to the cake. The finished product is messy as heck, but I am praying it will taste good when I serve it at a party tomorrow. Whether or not it can travel to the party without falling apart even more, however, remains to be seen. Next time I want to make a German chocolate cake, I will use the filling, but a different cake and frosting.

After reading the reviews I did not make the cake or the filling (I used other recipes for these) - but I did make the icing exactly as written. I ended up finding it not quite sweet enough (or firm enough) so I added about another half cup of icing sugar. With that addition it was really good. Nice and fudgy with excellent chocolate flavor. Much nicer than buttercreams made with cocoa powder. I would definitely make it again. I might try it without the sour cream though - the tang was nice, and as someone else said, a little like cheesecake, but my preference might be for pure chocolatey sweetness in an icing.

I have made this cake a few years in a row for my husband's birthday, and have gotten raves from our guests! Even my sister who does not eat cake with frosting, loves it. I keep mine in the refrigerator after serving, it turns into a fudge-like consistency. VERY rich, VERY good!

I found this cake dry and rather uninteresting. I only baked the layers for 23-24 minutes, like a previous viewer recommended and my cake was still quite dry and crumbly.Thankfully the filling helped overshadow the dryness of the cake. The frosting is wonderful though....the sour cream makes it like a chocolate cheesecake flavor.

Overall very good recipe. I had no problems with the cakes falling and they came out of the oven perfectly. However, they were done after only 23 minutes so I'm glad I watched them during baking. I probably didn't boil my caramel filling quite long enough as it was still a little thin even after cooling. Frosting was fantastically fudgy and rich! The cake layers did wind up being very delicate, so keep handling to an absolute minimum. I agree with an earlier reviewer that frosting and cake flavor tended to overwhelm the taste of the caramel filling. I might try a different caramel filling recipe next time, one with a stronger flavor. Very rich cake!!

I made this cake for my best friend's birthday.I doubled the recipe to make it into a sheet cake with 2 layers,topping the cake with the caramel,and piping squigles of frosting over it so everyone would get a bite of the frosting!( I did have to make an extra batch of frosting to have enough to cover the side and to pipe a decorative boarder.) The caramel topping was a bit soupy,so I added about 1/4 cup more of coconut,Ialso added toasted pecans rather than almonds. next time i will try adding a liittle more sugar(@1/4 cup) to the caramel syrup. p.s. The frosting was fabulous! yOU COULDN'T TELL IT HAD CONFECTIONERS SUGAR IN IT.

This cake rocks. I made it for my mom's birthday and was met with rave reviews. Per an earlier reviewer's suggestion I used kahlua instead of the powdered coffee. Delicious. Unfortunately, I also had the cave-in problem with the cake. (I incorporated the butter and sugar slowly and fluffed and fluffed and fluffed AND left the oven door closed until the end of the baking process. No suggestions how to avoid this problem.) I reduced the amount of almonds by 1/4 cup in the filling, but wouldn't dream of ever leaving them out, as I am an almond freak.

ummm... i've read everyone's reviews, and noone else seems to have my problem. i followed the directions exactly, and my frosting is very soupy. i put it in the freezer for awhile - hoping this helps!

This cake is rich and moist with lots of flavor. I substituted the slivered almonds with chopped walnuts and eliminated the sliced almonds altogether. Also, I used 1 cup kahlua in place of the water and espresso powder. The chocolate frosting is the best I have ever tasted. There was not one crumb left when the party was over! This cake takes a little time, but is worth every minute. Make the filling right after putting the cake in the oven and save 45 minutes waiting time.

I just finished this cake using many of the suggestions found here. Incorporating the sugar and butter slowly might help the "falling in the center" problem. Butter and sugar like to be introduced slowly - usually taking 4-5 minutes to incorporate. And make sure that you really "fluff" the butter and sugar - this may take an additional 10 minutes or so. It's tedious, but worth every second. Don't open the oven for 20-25 minutes - no matter how tempting! I froze the cakes, as suggested, and did not have any problem with the cakes falling apart.

I made this amazing cake two years ago and I still think about it! I had to search for the recipe again, it was that good. I especially love the caramel filling, it was fun to make. I recommend cutting back on the almonds a bit.

Very rich - very chocolately! The centres of the cake layers fell in a little...anything I can do to prevent that next time>

Extremely rich as far as chocolate is concerned. The chocolate really overpowers the almond/coconut/caramel aspect. And I wouldn't even bother with the powdered coffee bit. Also had trouble with center being too delicate and cake layers falling apart. Kind of a pain to make, but was still readily devoured by friends asking, "got milk?"

I am a professional pastry chef and I had trouble with the cakes falling in the center and being very tender and difficult to handle. Any feed back from successful bakers on this? Despite these problems ,I have made this cake twice. Very moist cake and excellant frosting. I agree with other reviewers that the filling does not have a strong cocnut taste but, is stillyummy ,in my opinion.

This is a beautiful cake for a special occasion. It is a good amount of work, but worth it. The cake is moist and rich and I especially like the toasted almonds in the filling. I remember I made it for a Christmas buffet once and my guests just freaked, it was so good!

This cake is delicious. Easy to make and oh so elegant. The almonds add so much to this cake. I liked the idea of using flowers to decorate the cake and I decorated the serving plate with berries of the season.

I loved this cake, I found it easy to make, and absolutely delicious. Instead of pushing almonds on the sides of the iced cake I opted for crystalized pansies, that looked absolutely gorgeous. I made this cake for my birthday and people couldn't say enough good things about it, I will definitely be making this again.

Cake was moist. Filling was not very good - too many nuts. Used whipped cream under filling. Prefer other "german" chocolate fillings better.

I didn't have a problem with the cake falling apart, but the filling, which by itself was wonderful, seemed to sog up the cake. The frosting is a keeper!

I love this cake, and so do all my friends. They are constantly asking when I will make it again. The cake is very moist, and I have had trouble getting it to stay together, but the struggle is worth it. I gave up taking the cake out of the pans to cool on a rack, and had a much easier time putting it all together.

The frosting on this cake is delicious. I will definitely make the frosting again. However, the cake tastes so similar to a box cake and falls apart too easily. Also, the coconut taste is barely there. Considering the time invested, there are many better chocolate cake recipes.

It was very moist and delicious! I'm glad I chose to make it for my mom's birthday. Try black coffee (I recommend a blend with bite) as an accompaniment.

I tripled this cake recipe to make it for a party of 50 and still had a ton left over. It's VERY rich. The batter for this cake is beautiful and makes the moistest cake. It is so moist that I found freezing the layers prior to adding the caramel filling greatly helped. I made it as is and everyone raved. Delicious!

I have reached the nadir of my baking career with the chocolate cake portion of this recipe. I substituted a different filling and made a chocolate ganache frosting - and the results were copious helpings of oohs and ahhs. This is undoubtedly the finest chocolate cake I have ever baked and eaten. Bravo

A spectacular success for the birthday party of a special friend... and the single most time-consuming item I have ever cooked!
