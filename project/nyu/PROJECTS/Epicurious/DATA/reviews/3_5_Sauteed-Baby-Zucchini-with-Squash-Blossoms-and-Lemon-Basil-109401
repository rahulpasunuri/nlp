Incidentally, forgot about a nice handful of blossoms I'd picked up at the farmers' market. They were in a plastic storage container lined with paper towels, and over a week later, they were still perfect! Apparently, if you keep them bone dry, they last longer than one would think...

I don't like zucchini, but wanted to use the squash blossoms I purchased at the farmer's market this morning. I tried the recipe with Japanese eggplant instead of zucchii, and it was wonderful! The color contrast between the eggplant and the squash flowers was fantastic, too. I also find it difficult to locate French salt in my area, but a little kosher salt combined with black salt (from an Indian grocery) seems to do the trick.

I have looked for and used many recipes for squash blossoms. This is the best way to use them I have found. I even used this recipe using very thinly sliced zucchini I had left over. It still worked great. Do use the sea salt.
