This is a great alternative to regular old mashed, especially for a special occasion. I made this as an accompaniment for a baked fish dish and it was lovely. I boiled the potatoes and the celeriac separately because I was worried that they would cook at different rates and one or the other would end up mushy or too firm. Although we thought this was delicious, I did feel that it might be lacking something that might make it even better. I'm thinking of substituting buttermilk for the cream next time and see if that does it for me.

Just made this recipe for the second time, excellent both times, but I liked it better with the modifications I made the second time. Chiefly, I reduced the size of the celery root used to just under 1lb. (pre-shave) and I also added a couple of modestly sized parsnips (trick I got from a friend) to the mix for a little bit more sweetness. Lovely as the aroma and flavor of the celeriac is, it also dominates the dish. I feel that toning it down a bit and adding the parsnips resulted in a purée that was sweeter and more interesting and subtle, allowing the distinct flavor of all of the root veggies to come through... Definitely great as is, just thought I would share the tweaks.

Prepared the celery root in the cuisinart and riced the potatoes. This dish was so much lighter than regular mashed potatoes and is our new family favorite.

This was fabulous and definitely an addition to my mashed potato repertoire. Who would have thought this combination would work so well? Served it with a venison ragout and everyone raved. Only problem: should have doubled the recipe.

This is an excellent alternative to mashed potatoes and very easy to do. We had it with tuna steak marinated in soy, ginger and wasabi powder. We also added wasabi powder to the celeriac to give it a nice kick. We will definitely be making this again.
