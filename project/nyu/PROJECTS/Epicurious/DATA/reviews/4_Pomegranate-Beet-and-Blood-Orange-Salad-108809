This was a terrific recipe for a fall salad. I served it at book club and not only did it look absolutely gorgeous, but everyone raved about it. I used persimmons instead of blood oranges. Also placed on a bed of mixed greens.

Simply the best salad I have ever had! I have eaten TONS of salad and always make my own dressing. This is just delicious! I added a little more olive oil to the dressing, served it over mixed spring greens and added goat cheese. It was perfect!!!

The dressing for this salad is very good, but we found the onions overpowering and ate around them. I would make this again without onions.

A great salad that received raves from guests. I served it as part of a buffet, putting the beets and orange on a bed of arugula. I soaked the onions in some orange juice and didn't bother making a dressing. I simply sprinkled some of the juice from the onions over the salad and then drizzled some reduced pomegranate juice all over. Definitely worth doing again.

Very unusual and tangy salad to add to any course. If you liked this recipe, I recommend the GOLDEN AND CRIMSON BEET SALAD WITH ORANGES, FENNEL, AND FETA (Bon Appetit October 2006) where you can literally mix and match ingredients to go with the roasted beets. One thing leads to another. Roasted beets lend themselves to a variety of creative additions.

Oooo! I loved this recipe. I made two modifications. 1) I served it on a bed of arugula with toasted pinenuts. 2) I couldn't find the pomegranate molasses, so I bought pomegranate juice and reduced it.

This salad is a delicate combination of some pretty strongly flavored elements. The dressing is pretty subtle, because it would overpower the lovely way that beets, pomegranates, and oranges mingle. The onions keep this from being too sweet, or too much for the taste buds to handle.

I made the salad dressing part of this dish to go with a salad of grilled shrimp, oranges, and pistachios. The dressing wasn't great. I ended up doctoring it by adding more orange juice (reduced by half).

I made the salad with fresh mandarin oranges but can imagine it would be fantastic with blood oranges. The oil I used was extra virgin olive oil - in keeping with the recipe's Middle Eastern flavour. It's taste is crisp and slightly acerbic, delightfully so! The pomegranate seeds are esential to the salad's success. Do try this excellent side dish.
