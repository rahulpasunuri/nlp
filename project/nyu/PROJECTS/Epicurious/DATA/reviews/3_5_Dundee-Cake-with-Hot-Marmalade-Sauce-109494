Made this as a Christmas gift for my best friend's Scottish mom. Absolutely delish. Very simple to make as well.

I was amazed at how great this was. My guests loved it and I have made it a few times now.

Very dense, moist and sweet, like a fruit cake. I like it though I feel it is a bit too sweet for me. I already held back one TBSP of sugar. Next time I shall try 2 ~ 3 TBSP.

Scottish fruitcake. A reconfirmation that I don't like fruitcake. I'm bothered by the bits. I'll stick to scones.

Every time I make this my friends and family rave about it. For my friends that don't drink - I use dark black tea in place of the whiskey. It maintains its authenticity and has great flavour.

The white raisins and dark raisins combined with the currants is unique. I was afraid it was going to be too sweet, but I was pleasantly surprised. (ex professional baker)

why wouldn't you just add 2 1/2 cups of raisens, currents or ...... Seems to me not to make that much difference.
