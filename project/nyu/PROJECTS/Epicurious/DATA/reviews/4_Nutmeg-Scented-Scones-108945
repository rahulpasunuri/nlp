This is my go to scone recipe. Perfect scones every time.

Amazing! I usually think of scones as heavy and dense - these were amazingly light and fluffy, and SO easy. Also - very flexible. The original recipe was delicious, and then made them savory by taking out the sugar and nutmeg and adding caramelized onions. Delicious!

These were PHENOMENAL. The scones were the perfect consistency and had a sweet, not over-powering flavor. They were delicious. I would probably add some extra sugar on top (for my boyfriend's sweet tooth) and I found with my first batch (I made 3) that 20 minutes was FAR too long. Somewhere between 12-15 made them perfect, not too brown.

What a waste. These were entirely inedible, and not for lack of baking prowess or detailed following of the recipe. The nutmeg was overpowering and bitter, more like a black pepper scone than nutmeg.

Followed recipe as written. Didn't have "true" clotted cream, so I whipped heavy organic cream to butter consistency and served with the raspberry jam. A delicious breakfast.

This recipe reminds me of eggnog - so yummy. I didn't shape traditional scones, but instead used a small cookie cutter and produced about 2 dozen "cookies" sprinked with nutmeg+sugar as per the recipe, baking at 425* fr 10 mins. A new holiday tradition is born! PS fresh nutmeg makes a world of difference here if you have access to it!

This was delicious-- light and fluffy. I substituted lowfat yogurt for the sour cream and it was excellent.

These were perfect with my butternut squash soup! Perfect autumn food. Can be made ahead to the baking point-just put the pan of scones in the frig til ready to bake which makes less time in kitchen when you have guests. A real winner.

Very good, and very easy!!! Used vanilla soy milk instead of sourcream, and no eggwhite on top. Made 16 smaller scones instead of 8 large. Everyone loved them!

All I can say is YUMMMY!!!!!! I'm eating on right now!! This is the second time I've made this scone and it is just scrumptious!!! I used about 2/3 cup of plain soy milk instead of sour cream b/c that's all I had and I didn't sprinkle any sugar or nutmeg on top...the texture and flavor were perfect!!! And I just made 4 large scones instead of 8. One of the best scones I've ever had!!!

I tried to make this recipe with a hand mixer and 1) it's too dusty, 2) it's too thick. Use your processor!! These are really good. I will make them again.

A great scone recipe and it could not be easier. To make it even quicker, I omitted the egg white glaze and just sprinkled the sugar/nutmeg on the scones before baking. Very good with apricot jam!

Tender tasty scone recipe. My son loves to use the nutmeg grater, so I was looking for a recipe to use nutmeg. Found a winner here! Great with raspberry jam.

Simple and tasty. A nice scone. Based on the note in the recipe I made them the day before (which I wouldn't normally do) and they reheated very well.
