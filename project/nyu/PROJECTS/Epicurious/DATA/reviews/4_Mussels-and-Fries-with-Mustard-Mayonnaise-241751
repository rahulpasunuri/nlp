We used Walmart's packaged frozen mussels and then added them to the sauce in this recipe. These mussels are pre salted, so ended up with about perfect seasoning without adding any more salt.

Just okay. Broth was bland and dull.

Reminiscent of steamed mussels served in Southern France, but I would have liked a bit more complexity to the sauce. It was too "wine-y" too sour. I followed recipe to the T and think it needs some improvements.

The mussels were delicious. I used cooking wine only because it has salt in it... if using regular wine, make sure to salt the liquid. I also doubled the garlic. 2 teaspoons mustard powder in 1/2 c mayo made this too spicy for my liking. Next time I will use 1 or 1 and a half. Easy weeknight dinner, highly recommended.

Wonderful. The mustard mayonaise is also good with the crab cakes in the next issue!

Delicious, quick, and cheap. This recipe required exactly 30 minutes and less than $15, including the baguette. (Okay, I used cheap leftover wine.) Use the dry mustard because it makes the mustard mayo nice and sharp. I just wish I had cooked the onions until they were a bit more tender. Definitely making this again.

For some reason, I've always had the impression that mussels are far trickier to cook and much more expensive than they actually are-- boy, am I glad that this recipe disabused me of that notion! This recipe was very easy, incredibly delicious, and pretty darn cheap to make. If you want to make it even easier on yourself, don't hassle with mixing your own mayo and pick up Dijonaise or some other store-bought creamy mustard.
