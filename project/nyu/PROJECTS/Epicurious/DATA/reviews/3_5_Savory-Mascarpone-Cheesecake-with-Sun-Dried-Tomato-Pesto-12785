I've made this recipe ever it since it was published in Gourmet. I don't make too often because it is very rich . . . but I love it and it has always turned out well. I usually "frost" the top with sour cream for a smoother effect.

I love pesto cheesecake! You can make this with all cream cheese and it is great, even with the reduced fat type. Try this...do not put the sundried tomatoes in the pesto. Divide the cheese mixture in half. Put the pesto in one half and process the dried tomatoes with the other half. Put the pesto cream cheese in first then the sundried tomato cream cheese for a pretty layred dish with flavor contrast. Top with toasted pine nuts and grated parm before baking!

I agree with the cook from Mill Creek. This definitely wasn't worth the time or expense. I usually make a dip with pretty much the same ingredients at my get-togethers, but this one was quite a disappointment. It seems the wonderful flavors of the pesto and sun-dried tomatoes were killed by cooking it.

Made this dish for a holiday party last year. About 10 women left with the recipe. About 10 crumbs remained on the serving plate.

Too salty and not worth the effort of making. My family did not enjoy this.

I made this dish for a cheesecake competition at our state fair and won first place!! It was delicious though I must admit to "kicking up" the filling with the addition of some romano cheese and fresh basil. I would also recommend garnishing the top with some roasted red peppers and toasted pinenuts along with some fresh basil.
