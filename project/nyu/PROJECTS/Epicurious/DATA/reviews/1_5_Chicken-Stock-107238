After one hour I took the chicken out, removed the meat and put the bones back for another hour. I added one whole leek to the stock.

I agree, if you cook the chicken for 3 hours it becomes useless however, I use whole legs(which are usually cheap) and cook for only 30-40 minutes(most of the goodness comes out of in the 1st hour anyway). Reserve the chicken to add back in for soup or use in a Tetrazzini etc.

I agree w/Virginia, just use left over bones and scrapes, the cooked chicken is useless. Jasper White's receipe is the very best!!

The stock was okay, but the salvaged chicken was tasteless, unfit for any other use. Even the cat wasn't interested. I get much better stock by using more bones, relative to meat, which really isn't necessary. Otherwise, the vegetables and salt are just about right.
