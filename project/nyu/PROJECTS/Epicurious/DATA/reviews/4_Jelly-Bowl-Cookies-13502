Terrific cookies and the basic cookie dough is beyond excellent. I thought I would pass on that in the 1995 issue of Gourmet, the food editors wrote a note that they tuck a chocolate chip in the indention before adding the jam. Haven't tried this tip but will next year!

These were so delicious and beautiful! I was hoping they would be as tasty as a linzer cookie but easier / faster to make, and that's exactly what they were! Yum! Here are some tips: - Based on previous reviewers, I added a little less flour and a little more sugar, plus some almond extract and finely ground walnuts. The nuts provide a nice balance to the tartness of the jam and sweetness of the cookie (although even with additional sugar, it still wasn't too sweet). - Use the end of a wooden spoon for a more uniform/ circular hole. - You might want to double the recipe- they go fast! My husband can't stop eating these. I had to make another batch so there would actually be some for my family coming in a few days. - They expand when they cook, so they will look super tiny on the cookie sheet. I got lazy and made some larger but they're a bit cuter when smaller. -I made some with apricot jam which also worked well (although the raspberry is a bit more Christmas-y) - To make the jam insertion really easy, fast, and neat, put it in a sandich baggie with a tiny snip in the corner (or a pastry bag if you have one) - At the end, I sprinkled the cookies lightly with some sifted powdered sugar- made them even prettier! This cookie was the favorite of all the Christmas cookies I made this year! Enjoy.

I made these last night and they were so delicious. The cookies have a great texture and the raspberry preserves I used (belgian) were a great decadent touch. I am giving these as a gift and could not be happier with how they turned out.

These are good, however,being a diabetic, I make cookies from a recipe I found many years ago, it is just cream cheese, butter, and flour. Then I use sugar-free jam.

These are my favorite Christmas cookies, and I make them every year with apricot, strawberry, raspberry and blueberry jams. The basic butter cookie dough is tender, buttery, and the quintessential Christmas cookie dough. Plus, these keep well in an airtight container. The only change I do is to make the indentation with the cylindrical handle of a wooden spoon instead of my thumb; it leaves a perfect round well, and it keeps dough out of my long fingernails!

This was easy to make with a five year old. The dough recipe can easily be halved and frozen. For simplicity's sake, we used squeeze jelly from a bottle.

I just made my first batch and they were just right. I followed the directions exactly except I used 100% fruit spread instead of jam. Yummy and pretty.

These cookies were very easy to make. If you have a melon baller, dip it in a bit of water to make the "bowl" part of the cookies, that way each cookie has a standard sized circle and it keeps your hands from getting dirty. These cookies are very pretty and were a favorite of many.

If I could give this one 5 forks, I would! These are terrific, and very easy. I filled mine with blackberry jam, and my husband & father ate them like they were going out of style.

I love these little cookies. They are just the perfect little bite of sweet. I use a composite cork from a wine bottle to make my dents. It makes a prettier more uniform cookie.

I've been making these for years with various flavors of jam. Looking for something a little different this year, I added black pepper to the cookie dough and topped them with red pepper jelly. Delicious if you like that mix of sweet and spicy.

These are EXACTLY what I've always been looking for in a butter cookie! So perfectly delicious. Tender cookie with crisp edges, crumbly in the mouth but soft enough to stay together when you pick it up. They would be beautiful on a holiday cookie tray, but I made them in July with fresh tayberry jam (filled before baking, not after) from a coworker and they are divine! I can't wait to try at different times of year, with different flavors or just as spritz.

These are awesome! Love the dough, it's so versatile. I filled some with Lemon Curd and the sprinkled with confectioners sugar after cooling. Some I rolled in very finely choppped cashews before filling with Nutella. All turned out wonderful. I can't wait to try them next year with some home-made jam!

These cookies were very good. My husband took some to work with him and they were gone instantly. I used raspberry Polaner All Fruit for the filling and it was a perfect combination with the buttery taste of the cookies.

These are a fun, easy cookie to make. And they do make 8+ dozen. I used a level teaspoon full and although they look so small on the cookie sheet, they do spread in size a bit after they are baked. They really add color to a plate of Xmas cookies. Using the handle of a wooden spoon rather than the thumbprint was a great idea and I suggest placing a generous scoup of jam on the cookies or it will bake down and you won't be able to taste it! I tried using raspberry, apricot and mint jams. The raspberry went the fastest.

Yes, the recipe does make 8 dozen cookies if you measure the dough one teaspoon at a time - it makes for small but delicious cookies.

This is a delicious tea cookie, and would also be a wonderful Christmas cookie. The dough is tender, buttery, and easy to work with. But it does not make eight dozen cookies--four dozen is more like it.

Rating: 4
The dough is buttery and difficult at some point to handle, though it isn't much of a fuss once you taste this great cookie!! Make a big indentation and don't fill it up too much with the jam or it will stick the cookie to the baking sheet and it won't look pretty! Easy to do, go ahead and try them; apricot jam is incredible on these.

I made these cookies and took them to Lake Havasu City, Az......one week after they were made "ALL" the children gobbled them up fast. They are such a great cookie !

This is a great recipe to make with kids. My three year old made the indentations and my nine year old filled them with seedless blackberry jam. We did not strain the jam, but my husband stirred it really well which thinned it a bit. They looked nice, tasted great, and best of all my kids had fun.

I got an idea for filling these cookies from one of the other butter-cookie recipes, the Raspberry Hazelnut Triangles. Just drop some nuts in the middle after you put in the jam. This shape makes a yummier cookie than the other recipe, I think (because it isn't as thin), and the nuts and jam together made them look really festive for Christmas. Also thanks to reviewer below for the wooden-spoon tip which worked really well.

I've made these before, but I roll them in some eggwhite and then crushed nuts (walnuts or almonds) before pressing my thumb in. :o)

I look for things that are simple yet can be mofied to make several different tastes. This recipie holds these qualities. I am also a mother of two elementary school children who love it when I make desserts and use these cookies as garnish. This is a great recipie and will be a part of my home baking for years to come.

This is a very basic recipe using sweet short pastry dough. Given that, I'm not really hacking on the formula, it's just that it's damned simple. The taste is good, the texture is good, the mouthfeel is also the same, but as far as the processing goes .... my 3 year old can do it! Simple is good almost always, but this is too easy.

I think that these cookies are delicious and I reccommend baking them for 12 minutes and no longer. Its not necessary to strain the jam because it tastes just as good without the straining. I think they taste great, look professional, and they are simple to make, you can't go wrong with these!

This is a real "festive" looking cookie. If you're baking cookies to give away, you'll want to include this recipe. I've given away these cookies for the past two years and everyone always asks for the recipe. I use three different jellies: mint apple jelly, seedless raspberry, and apricot. No need to strain jellys as instructed; just stir real well in separate bowls and that will thin the jelly to make it easier to handle when placing into the indentations of the cookies. For less mess, use a 1/8 tsp. to place the jelly into the indentation. To make the indentations, use the end of a wooden spoon---this works better than your thumb. Also---make sure the dough is at room temperature when rolling into a ball, otherwise the you'll have unattractive "cracks" in the dough. This makes a very large batch, and is a bit time consuming, so get the kids to help---great family baking project!

Great easy recipe. The basic butter dough is light and tasty and the jam adds just a bit of sweeetness. These were gone in minutes at work! I will definately make this again and try some of the other recipes that use the basic butter dough.

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipie, though I am more used to a bar-shaped jam cookie where you can use more fruit, and we both like those better. Then again, I could do that with this recipie!

A great cookie recipe! I used lemon curd for filling, and they turned out beautifully (no straining needed, either). They make a colorful addition to a cookie selection for a gathering or to give away. I also chopped up gumdrops in my food processor, using colors that contrasted with the filling, and dropped a small piece into the middle of each cookie while they were still warm, and they were just gorgeous. I've gotten raves from everyone who has eaten them!

I am not a fan of baking cookies, but seeing how I have three small children and it is Christmas and we seem to always have to bring cookies to this party and that, well I must say, these are it for me. Beautiful, easy and tasty. Plus you can do so many different things. The dough will last for days in the fridge too so if you're like me and burn out on baking sheets of cookies these little jelly bowl honeys are for you.

Very good! A good idea is to add some poppy seeds to the butter cookie dough and then sprinkled 10X sugar over the cookies after they're completely cool. These are extra special.

This cookie is a classic! What I like about it is that I can add the jelly to the cookies that I will take into work for coffee break time and also put in the hershey chocolate kiss for the kid friendly version that my daughters LOVE!! Simple, inexpensive and tasty!
