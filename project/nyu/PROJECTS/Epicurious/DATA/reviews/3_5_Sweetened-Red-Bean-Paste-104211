Made this recipe using dried adzuki beans, and turned out perfectly. Much tastier than the pre-made, packaged stuff. Heeding the other review, I slowly added the sugar, but ended up using the full half cup--maybe because of the different bean types.

I've made this recipe twice now, both times using commonly found red kidney beans. The first time, I made this as directed and the paste turned out extremely sweet. Second time I used 1/4 cup of brown sugar instead of a 1/2 cup, as directed. This was much better. Served in the middle of a bowl of brown rice congee, perfect for cold winter days, tummy aches, and general comfort all round. 3 forks because there was too much sugar as directed.
