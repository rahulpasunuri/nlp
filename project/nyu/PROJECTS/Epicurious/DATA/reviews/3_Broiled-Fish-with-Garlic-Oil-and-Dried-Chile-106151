Not a bad recipe at all, I just liked it, not loved it. I think there are so many fabulous ways to prepare red snapper and this wasn't one of the best. It was mediocre and when I spend so much on fish, I want to love the recipe. I infused the oil, which definitely added a kick but I could have used more flavors. Sorry!

I made this dish with whole sea bream, head and tail still on. However, I only needed to broil the fish about 3-4 minutes on each side. The results were spectacular - blistery, charred crispy skin and tender, juicy flesh. I also infused the oil with the chile and used coriander instead of parsley for a more Asian flavor.

Quick, simple, delicious. The snapper itself reigns against a backdrop of subtle, complementary flavors. I used skinned fillets cooked to 140 degrees Fahrenheit, and Cancun's infusion method below.

I made a slight change. I infused the chile and the garlic in the oil by putting them in the microwave for 20 seconds on high and then poured them both over the fish. A real imporvement. It was excellent and better than the original which I also made.

This fish was simple and wonderful. I used fresh trout instead of snapper. It was a easy, quick and elegant enough to serve for a dinner party. Next time I will double the garlic and red vinegar.
