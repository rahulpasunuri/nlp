I changed this recipe around and used it for a turkey roast. I did not use butter instead i used a little olive oil, I added leeks instead of onions. and used non chicken stock (vegetarian). it was delicious.

A very yummy recipe! I first brined the turkey over night and followed the recipe. Gravy making has always been a hit or miss with me, but I found this recipe easy to follow. Even though I deleted the onions from the gravy recipe, the family loved it.

I have saved this copy of the magazine since 1997 and have been making it ever since. The bird's delicious (although I start with a hotter oven) and the gravy's the best!

I try a different gravy recipe each year. And this one with white wine is definitely a keeper. I didn't use the neck and gizzard but used regular chicken stock and the drippings from the roasting pan. The gravy was dark, rich and very flavorful--something I worry about with some gravies. This recipe is delicious!

Mmmmm... I can still taste the gravy... de-lish! I didn't have giblets (or a neck) since I was only roasting a breast but the stock was just as good without. I used butter and some olive oil in place of fat since I didn't get any of that off the breast either - it worked well but maybe a bit salty (I'd suggest unsalted butter if you want to try this). Otherwise, followed everything else to the letter and wouldn't change a thing.

This review is for how I marinate my turkey for this recipe, I received a request on how I managed my marinade procedure from a user I could not send an email to; anyway this is the best way. Rember that I start with my turkey frozen, I add 2 to 3 cups of white wine with my meat in a turkey baking bag. I turn the Turkey at least twice per day marinating in the wine while thawing out. I start 3 days prior to cooking, I also add sliced garlic peels,slices of butter which I put into the slits made in the meat. I used cracked black peppercorns, thyme,rosemary,3 gound fresh cloves. A person I was really close to at one time gave me this recipe. I wish her well and 'Happy Thanksgiving to YOU & your family. This entire Turkey was eaten and was the BEST I've ever made thanks to her cookbook. And thanks to Epicurious for the recipe which reminded me of the Turkey year 1999.

I used the white-wine gravy recipe this Thanksgiving and it was a great success. It was my first experience making gravy as well, and I found it generally easy. The only tricky bit was controling the roasting pan on the stove top during deglazing. Also, we were serving about 15 people so I just increased the amounts a bit. I did end up having to use a bit of chicken stock to get the desired consistency, but it was just fine.

This was my first experience making gravy and it was not only easy it turned out incredible. My family raved about it.

I love this recipe. It is delicious. I have made it for big parties and casual get togethers. I also make the stock/gravy that is referenced. It is wonderful for hot roast beef sandwiches.

I host an ETV food show in the Southeast and have gained a reputation as being a tolerable cook. Though I had never cooked a turkey I was "volunteered" to cook a Thanksgiving meal for forty people at our studios. I chose this recipe along with the Herb and Bacon Corn Bread Stuffing as the basis for the meal. It drew absolute raves from everyone as well as eight invitations as guest chef for home Thanksgiving celebrations, a mixed blessing that. Wonderful, easy, tasty, and adaptable recipe. I used a Sauterne as the wine and added a splash to the bird's cavity at each basting to keep it nice and moist.
