Excellent and elegant dessert. Because each component can be prepped in advance, it is perfect for large dinner parties. I usually substitute peaches for the pears. Tuaca is an excellent liqueur to use in many recipes. Serve with a good Sauterne.

Pears were expensive when I made this, not to mention the Tuaca! It was very expensive and very much work, only to get a dessert that was sickingly sweet. I thought it was disgusting.

Amazing dessert! Used a muscat with hints of pear instead of the Tuaca. Would definitely make this again... maybe for Thanksgiving!

My husband and I love having people over for dinner. He always did the cooking but I decided I wanted to learn a few things about cooking so I made the salad and dessert for our last dinner party. I absolutely loved this dessert. It was a winner and I am sure to make it again with Tuaca (I used Grand Marnier this time).

I made this for a dinner party and everyone raved about how lite and delicous it was. I used the Pinot Grigio wine. I also made a pear shape out of puff pastry and baked it, to decorate my plate. Awesome!
