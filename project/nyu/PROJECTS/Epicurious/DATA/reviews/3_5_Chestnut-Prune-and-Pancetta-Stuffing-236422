Excellent, hubby could not stop raving about it. Nothing overwhelmed each other it was just the right balance.

This was a big hit for my first Thanksgiving meal cooked! My personal favorite of all the dishes. I did not use any butter for the meal - just to grease the pan and foil. The pancetta created enough juices that it wasn't necessary.

The recipe was pretty simple to make, although time consuming (took me about 2 hours start to finish). I've made this twice before using exact ingredients, but third time's a charm: I subbed dried cranberries for the prunes, used country style white bread in place of sourdough, and chopped the chestnuts into quarters instead of halves (I find the larger chunks too mealy). I also left out the pancetta. It's all personal preference, but I received many compliments this time around.

This was a good recipe. I found it lacking somewhat though. I added Mushrooms and whole garlic cloves to the leftovers and it was delicious.

This was very tasty and easy to make. Mine was a bit dry, so next time I would add more stock, but it was definitely a nice, different change! The prunes can be very strong, so be sure your diners appreciate bold flavors.

This was good. I used both sourdough and pumpernickle breads and served it with roast goose. I think the pancetta got lost a bit in the mix and plan to try it again with a mild sausage instead.

This was one of the best stuffings I've ever had. The flavor was great and the texture was perfect. Using plenty of homemade turkey stock made the stuffing taste like it was cooked inside the bird.

This recipe got raves from my guests. It would be easy to add any kind of dried fruit to this recipe if prunes aren't your thing. I baked it in a large lasagne pan so there was plenty of crunchy top and the inside was very moist.

I made this on Thanksgiving, and it was the second-best stuffing I've ever had (my mom's is the best). I assembled it the night before, and added the stock/egg recipe and baked it on Thanksgiving. I wouldn't change a thing -- the salt in the pancetta nicely balanced the sweetness from the prunes, and the chestnuts gave it a wonderful consistency and flavor.

The flavor combo here is pretty fabulous. Only change I might try personally would be cranberries instead of the prunes...the prunes taste great, but I think cranberries might give an extra flavor dimension the prunes don't....just a bonus there'd be one less thing to chop :). The chestnuts add a wonderful texture compliment. I prepped everything the night before and just added the stock/eggs right before baking - muy bien and simple the day of...

I made this exactly as the recipe states, except that I used packaged cornbread cubes instead of toasting my own sourdough. It got RAVE reviews and a request to make it again next year. The flavors are terrific together.

This recipe is so unbelievably scrumptious. The fruit pairs so well with the turkey and it wonderfully moist and sweett and mmmmmmm mmm m mmmmm.
