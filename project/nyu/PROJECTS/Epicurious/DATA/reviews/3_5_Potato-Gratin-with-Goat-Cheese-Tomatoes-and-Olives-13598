Sliced the potatoes about 1/4 inch thick and even after 1.5 hours they were still not tender. Not sure what went wrong, but if you want to try this recipe make sure to par-boil first, as others have suggested.

I sliced the potatoes thinner and used gorgonzola instead of goat cheese as that's what I had on hand. Very good.

I made this with 5 potatos which I boiled for 20 minutes before baking with the rest of this. I also used feta instead of goat cheeze. My husband and small children loved this. I would add more feta though next time.

I happened to have the exact ingredients around for this so I made it. I also had some kale so I layered that in. The kale was the yummiest part, especially the top layer that got a bit crispy. The rest was good too.

This dish was delicious. Better too the next day as leftovers. Instead of goat cheese, I used an aged gouda, shredded over the tomato mix. It gave a nice texture when baked, and great flavor. Also fresh tomatoes. And small new potatoes instead of baking potatoes. Better flavor.

I and everyone at the pot luck party I took it to (in a chafing dish) absolutely loved this. For me? I love goat cheese and plan to double the amount next time. Other than the suggestion to parboil the potatoes briefly first, I won't change anything.

This recipe went over incredibly well with kids and adults alike! It goes well w/grilled steak or prime rib, and if you broil it so the potatoes on top brown, it presents well on the table!

My three-year-old son loved it which means it's a miracle already. I sliced and boiled the potatoes before layering them in the dish. It cuts down the oven time, especially during the hot and humid summer. I used mozzarella cheese because goat cheese is frightfully expensive in Japan. Wonderful dish, reliable recipe.

The potatoes were not tender enough... I think they should be sliced much thinner. The tomatoes, goat cheese and olives were very flavorful and gave a nice twist to this old stand-by with the added bonus of being low fat.
