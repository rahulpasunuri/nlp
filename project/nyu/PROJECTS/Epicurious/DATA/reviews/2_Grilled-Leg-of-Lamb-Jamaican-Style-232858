I made this for my boyfriends 50th birthday and we really enjoyed it. The allspice and rum made for an interesting taste although I found that there was a richness or depth of taste missing (perhaps because I used Quebec lamb which has a more subtle flavour) I had to change the mango for nectarine due to allergies and found the flavour disappointing. The lamb stands alone and really doesn't need the relish anyway.

I timed this poorly. There was only 1 great review with 4 forks. Now, I also have to add that this was not good. The marinade was odd to say the least and didn't penetrate the meat. The relish, equally as odd, went down the disposal.

I have to agree with the other reviewers, this was not good. Don't waste your time!

Personally, this was not good. I debated, make the relish or a salsa. I followed the recipe and did the relish. Too Bad. Niether the meat nor the relish was worth the effort. Very bland in taste.

WOW!! The depth of flavors is wonderful in this recipe. A definate must do again. I toned down the heat from the peppers a bit and the lamb took longer than expected to cook but other than that it was amazing!! Enjoy................
