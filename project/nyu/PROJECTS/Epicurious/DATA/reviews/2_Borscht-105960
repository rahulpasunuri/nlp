This is terrible. Borscht runs through my veins and using canned broth is a travesty because the very anchor of this dish is the broth. Make your own GOOD broth, then add the cooked meat and veggies (we saute carrots, onions and celery in the beef fat from roasting the shank for the broth), then the ROASTED beets and cabbage at the end. Let it sit in the fridge for a day to allow all the flavors to blend, then skim off the fat before reheating and serving with SOUR CREAM (not yogurt, which is just weird).

I don't like this Russian beet soup. Minestrone is so much better! Make minestrone and not this stupid beet soup. I won't say it's awful, but I will say that it's not tasty at all!!!

A friend and I just finished making this, and while I have no claims to a Russian babba or Polish grandmother from whom to judge this recipe I think its been given a bad rap from other reviewers. It was hearty, fulling, and hit the spot on a cold Canadian winter night. Although the canned beef broth is not very "foodie," substitute homemade if you are lucky enough to have the time and luxury of having some hanging around. I don't know what all the negative fuss is about - we loved it!

I made a vegetarian version of this soup - used vegetable stock cubes in place of meat/broth. I also grated the beets and omitted the dill (overdid it on dill in Russia...) and added a healthy (!) dollop of sour cream/creme fraiche before serving. It may not be authentic, but my husband said it brought back memories of his old Moscow canteen. Not sure if that is good or bad but I thought the soup was delicious.

i go on this site with confidence that these recipes are authentic and right. i have not made the soup myself, but reading the reveiws, i dont think i will. there should be a link you can press to report a recipe. im very dissapointed that epicurious would allow such a thing.

Here in NYC, we have many East European restaurants and wonderful borschts - often several varieties in one restaurant! But I have NEVER eaten borscht this unhealthy or inauthentic. You have a good recipe supplied below.

Hi - I just read other reviews. I did not make the recipe. A really tasty recipe for borscht is the one in Joy of Cooking. I don't have a clue as to its authenticity. Spectacular with whole wheat biscuits....

I was curious to see what kind of borsh recipe this site proposes. I can only tell you that this one is WRONG. I've spent many years in Russia and former USSR countries, tasted many different kinds of borsh, cooked and been taught to cook this soup, and know for sure that this is not the way you do it. I would like to suggest Epicurious to remove this recipe, and replace it with something that real Russian chefs will advise.

There are hundreds of borscht recipes, and this one doesn't sound like any of them. Do not use broth or anything canned. Boil beef approx. 1 1/2 hour, in a separate pan boil beets. In a heavy skillet saute thinly sliced carrots and onions, add peeled and thinly sliced beet and tomato paste with some water, cover and let cook for a couple minutes. Remove meet from the brot, add potatoes, salt, 10 minutes later--cabbage, then carrot-beet mixture from the skillet, simmer for a while, add cubed meet. You can add parsley, dill, bay leaves, garlic and pepper to taste, as well ass fresh tomatos and sweet peppers, or use chicken instead of beef. Goes well with sour cream.

There is a saying in Russia that there are as many borsch recipes as there are women in Russia. However, this recipe does not sound right as the whole principle of Russian cuisine is to cook using only fresh ingredients. If you would like a suggestion on how to improve your borsch recipe get in touch with Raissa on www.russianfairytale.com a founder of a Russian Deli in UK. The borsch I tried there is THE WINNER!!!

Coming from a Russian/Ukranian household I want to tell you there is nothing authentic about this Borscht recepie. Borscht is a beet soup with many different combinations possible. However, this recipe lacks the ingridients that make this soup flaverfull and memorable.

One serving of this dish using regular beef broth contains 2.85g of sodium...more than the rda... while using a low-sodium broth contained 1.1g of sodium. I used home-made broth, ending up with only .6g of sodium per serving...much healthier!!! I also added some cornstarch with one cup of broth in the last 5 minutes to thicken the soup up a bit. Otherwise, it was very tasty and and well-received, even with us polish traditionalists.

If there are so many varieties of chicken stock, there MUST be a low-salt version of beef broth! It seems to me that with one or two beef shanks, and some beef bones, and some veggies, one can easily make one's own low-salt and low-fat broth.

THIS is a recipe for HEALTH???? With 10 cups of canned beef broth???? The sodium alone would be capable of causing congestive heart failure in my guy. We both love borscht, and I plan to try this recipe -- it does sound tasty -- but only with home-made broth/stock. Caveat epicure!
