I make this recipe a lot but usually just use the topping. i slather the top of the salmon with honey mustard and then spread the topping over it, great, fast, and delicious. I've used the filling before but I agree with some of the other reviewers, it overwhelms the fish.

Rating: 4
I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe, although I did take a couple shortcuts. I substituted cream cheese, whipping cream, and sour cream for the mascarpone. This is in addition to the cream cheese called for in the recipe. I also substituted dried bread crumbs for the fresh, although at about half the volume and with maybe 25% more melted butter to get a good consistency for spreading.

Made this for the first time a few weeks ago and have already made it again! Great reciped! The only small modification I made was I wilted the spinach in a sautee pan with olive oil instead of boiling in water. Since it's just me and my boyfriend, I purchased 2 salmon fillets, and we used the left over filling and topping to stuff chicken breasts the next night. It worked out great, and made 2 fabulous dinners. Wouldn't change the recipe at all. It's a fast, easy, delicous, no-fail recipe.

This recipe has been a staple in my kitchen for the past 8 years. I have made it for company, for family Sunday dinner, even during the week. I like that it can be prepared ahead of time and then just popped in the oven. I use frozen spinach that I defrost and drain. Be sure to season the spinach well with salt, pepper and nutmeg. I use 1/2 the recipe for breadcrumb mixture but only 1/4 of the butter. I bake them about 3 minutes longer than recipe calls for. This seems to please adults and my daughter. Wonderful served with roasted potatoes!

Took the suggestion of previous reviewers and used goat cheese in the "stuffing," but was still dissapointed. There just seemed to be too many competing flavors from the spinach and cheese stuffing to the breadcrumb and parmesan cheese topping. All of this seemed to overwhelm the flavor of the salmon itself.

Rating: 0
Thanks so much to all of the people who gave hints in their reviews. I used garlic herb goat cheese - which gave additional flavor (many just added herbs). I also mixed the cheese separately. Then I added the cheese mixture to the spinach. I used only half of the cheese mixture, as I wanted the stuffing to be more green than white. I served with mashed potatos and asparagus. Guests LOVED it.

Based on the reviews of others, I served this recipe for the first time for a large family dinner. After reading other reviews, I switched to goat cheese, added garlic to spinach & others herbs to cheese mix. It was okay, but not the build-up of most reviews. The filling was too creamy, and I felt like there was too much even though I didn't use it all. I do want to tinker with it: did anyone omit the cream cheese and use only goat cheese? It was a lovely presentation but not a winner as is. I'll try it on hubby only next time.

i made this last night for some friends and we all LOVED it!! amazingly delicious!!! i used goat cheese instead of mascarpone also. and just added dried oregano, basil, and garlic powder to the cheese mix and the bread crumbs. used all the butter and thought it was perfect! i will be making this often.

This recipe is a keeper! I, too, substituted goat cheese for the mascarpone, and I sauteed the spinach with a little garlic, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.

This recipe was great! Made a couple of minor changes and tried to make it a bit healthier though... used light cream cheese, and for the topping, used less parm, less breadcrumbs, and no butter. Breadcrumbs didn't get as brown, but that didn't bother me. Also, I cut the slit into the thick side of the fillets so that the filling would be in every bite! delicious.

This is the second time that I have made this recipe. It was even better this time, as I used a fresh loaf of French bread for the bread crumbs(processed in the food processor). The nice thing with this dish is that you can prep it all ahead of time, and it takes so little time to cook that you can put it in the oven while your guests are eating salad/appies.

I made this several years ago for a good friends birthday. It came out absolutely wonderful. To this day I still get request for this particular entree. I was fortunate enough to be able to use freshly caught sockeye salmon. The rich oils of Sockeye really went well with the marscapone and spinach.

We have had an abundance of sockeye in our waters recently and with a husband whose hobby is fishing, I was running out of ideas. I made exactly as stated, except used panko. It was delicious. Actually, I changed one more thing, I took it camping, and barbequed it on a sheet of foil. A must try.

Quite nice. Changed the proportions and used 3/4 mascarpone to 1/4 cream cheese. Used fresh nutmeg and more than suggested. As others, I did a lot of taste testing and adjusted S&P and nutmeg as required. I stuffed a long fillet by slicing a horizontal cut in the thick side of the fillet and filling from the side. Worked out great for the party I cooked for and received great compliments. Note: I trimmed the salmon before stuffing (to get a more uniform fillet) and so had leftover from the top and the tail. I also had some mascarpone spinach stuffing remaining. Next day, I baked the leftover salmon bits to just cooked and added (without the skin or bloodline) to the filling and stuffed some ravioli. Served with a light homemade marinara and it made an excellent lunch (with a caeser salad and nice Italian red wine).

Rating: 4
This was one of my dishes for Easter brunch. Everyone loved it and it made a great presentation. Prepared the filling as stated adding more nutmeg and S&P until I got the taste I liked. I cut a slit on the side of the filet between the top & bottom not cutting thru to the other side and placed the stuffing there. I mounded the breading on the top. Used Panko instead of fresh breadcrumbs. Can prepare ahead. I made early Sunday morning, covered it and put it in the frig. Put it in the oven when I got home from church. It turned out great. Left overs warmed up nicely, too. Definitely a keeper.

Love this dish! It is easy to prepare ahead of time for a party (can sit several hours without the bread crumbs getting too soft.

Even though we do not like salmon, we we are trying to incorporate it into our diets. This recipe makes that goal easier to achieve. Followed other reviewers ideas- replaced butter with olive oil; enhanced flavor of stuffing with grated premium provolone, basil, & extra nutmeg; replaced fresh with Panko. A bit rich, but definitely a keeper. Serve with a nice, light, green salad.

We do not like salmon, but... because it is so healthy we try to find recipes that make it palatable so that we can include it in our diet. This is it! Took other reviewer's suggestions & replaced butter with olive oil- thank god, it was very rich even then! Also added premium provolone (grated), more nutmeg, and basil to stuffing. Used whole wheat panko instead of fresh, ricotta instead of mascarpone. All you need to serve with this is a fresh green salad & it makes a lovely meal.

Salmon's my favorite fish, and I enjoy it weekly, generally done in a homemade teriyaki marinade, or an orange/maple glaze. Spinach is also a favorite. This recipe, which combines two favorites, didn't turn out as I thought it would. It was actually too rich for my taste. I had even cut back on the breadcrumb/butter topping, as someone suggested, and I found it still too cloying, too much for this already-rather-rich fish. Perhaps you'll like it because it's different--it is! Perhaps you'll find it too rich, too?

Made this for Easter dinner and it was a big hit, will definitely make it again. Next time would use less butter making the breadcrumb topping--too rich on top of the cheese filling. We also wound up spreading extra filling on top.

I envited my friends over for something different and this was deffinately a hitter. I changed a couple of things like I replaced the mascarpone with cottage cheese and I also used whipping cream, I sauted the spinach with olive oil, butter, garlic salt and red pepper and a bit of white. I stuffed and poured the cream & spinach over the salmon and the crust on top when we pulled them out after

To those of you who thought it was bland, try substituting the mascarpone and cream cheese for Boursin (in which case you don't need the salt, pepper & nutmeg). It turned out very rich, but delicious. I also tried it with mascarpone but found it very bland. Also, I subbed olive oil for the butter both times & I thought it turned out quite good.

I kicked up the stuffing by adding 2 cloves of chopped garlic, 2 T of pine nuts, 1 small chopped onion. I substituted almond meal instead of flour because we're doing the low carb thing. I think it actually improved the dish. Also, I mixed the almond meal with the spinach mixture to hold everything together and used less butter. With the substitutions above, it was great.

We eat a lot of fish and salmon (wild, hopefully PCB free) and have many great recipes. So I was a little suspect about the other reviews - is it really that good? After making it once, I'm a believer. Even our six year old daughter liked it, especially the spinach filling. The bread crumbs add a nice crunch to the smooth texured filling and fish. Used about 1/3 of stick of butter in crumbs and it was very rich. A whole stick might be overkill. Bottom line - very easy to prepare with exceptional results.

Took some reviewer suggestions and just used cream cheese and zipped everything in the processor....EASY! Next time I'll add more seasoning to the spinach mixture and try the goat cheese.

So simple, and so fast. I took the advice of a couple of others, put the cream cheese and spinach in the food processer to blend (rather than chopping all the spinach), and added chopped pecans to the crumb mixture on top of the fish. This was delicious - I look forward to making it again.

This dish is fabuous. The scond time I made it, I used only cream cheese as I forgot to buy mascarpone and was well into the prep before I realized it. It didn't make much of a difference in the taste. I usually buy one med-large salmon steak, stuff it, then my husband and I half it. There is so much filling (evn halving the recipe) and it's so yummy that we certainly get a full meal. It's beautiful served with roasted red potatoes.

I agree this recipe was pretty simple to make, and can be mostly prepared in advance. My guests couldn't believe this was made with frozen salmon filets, probably because the filling and breadcrumbs were so delicious. I had MUCH more filling and crust than needed for 6 servings of fish, so I think even for 8 as the recipe states, it could be cut back a bit, but now I'm looking forward to rolling the filling in the crumbs as an appetizer! I will definitely make this again, and it was a beautiful and festive presentation on top of being just plain delicious!

After an Alaskan summer of fishing, I always have a freezer full of salmon, and this is one of my favorite ways to use it up. The rich mascarpone and spinach flavor can counter the slightly off flavor of frozen salmon. I imagine it would also be useful for the lower-48 cook who may not have access to same-day seafood. I make it at least twice a month and I'm still not tired of it.

I sort of changed this recipe, but it was DEEEElicious. I used sushi grade halibut, added garlic in the cheese mixture along with some Italian herbs.

I had some left-over mascarpone cheese after having used it for a dessert the weekend before so I tried this recipe and had pretty good results. Unfortunately, I didn't read the recipe close enough and forgot to slice the spinach before mixing it with the mascarpone but we enjoyed the recipe anyway. I'd make it again but probably only if I had mascarpone on hand -- goat cheese is really not the same thing, although cream cheese comes pretty close. Mascarpone is dreamy but is expensive:-) I served the salmon with a tomato-basil risotto -- a not too rich complement.

So, I left the breadcrumb mixture off her fish. She found it delicious as well. Personally, I found the homemade breadcrumbs to be a delightful added crispiness to the fish.

Great dish, but a little richer than I had expected. I made with goat cheese instead of mascarpone and used frozen instead of fresh spinach. The only change that I will make going forward is to cut back on the bread crumb mixture - I will use 1 3/4 cups bread crumbs and adjust the butter and cheese accordingly. I had too much crumbs left over - what didn't stick to the fish blackened in the baking pan and I even topped my accompanying baked cauliflower casserole with extra crumbs!

Based on the ingredients, I expected this to be wonderful. Unfortunately, it was not as good as I had hoped. Salmon is a great fish just broiled or baked, so if you are going to the trouble to stuff it, the combination should be spectacular. This wasn't. The cheese/spinach filling was good on its own but it had no real purpose in this dish other than making for an attractive presentation. In my opinion, the cheese/spinach stuffing didn't augment the flavor or texture of the salmon. I won't make this again. There are better recipes.

This was recipe was an excellent basis for a great salmon dish! I read other reviewers comments and changed the recipe slightly for dietary reasons. I had a higher spinach to cheese ratio and used light boursin cheese, which gave it amazing flavor and was easy (cream cheese with herbs would be good too). I found that I had way too much bread crumb topping so I will reduce in the future. While I am sure fresh bread crumbs would make this even better, I used seasoned store bought ones I had on hand as a time saver and the dish didn't suffer (I used olive oil instead of butter with the topping). Served it with a mesculin salad with balsamic vinegrette and pine nuts, and an herbed rice pilaf. Keep the sides light.

We had my husband's family over for Easter and this was a hit! It was rich but perfect for a special-occasion meal, and received rave reviews.

I used all Marscapone as I had to buy it anyway...and it just melted into a mess during the cooking. You couldn't tell there was a "stuffing." It was very moist though, and my in-laws enjoyed it, but I thought it was bland. Definately fast and easy though! So it gets points for that.

I agree with the critque about farm raised salmon, it tastes very different then naturally grown fish. As well, farm raising of fish is environmental unsound causing a lot of waste that pollutes the water around the fish pens. I made the decision a few months back not to buy farm raised fish. What that means is you have to find a good fish monger or store that sells the real stuff, and you will pay a good price for it. But as everything in life, each action you do has moral and ethical consequences. As for other options for fish, how about rolling sole or flounder around the stuffing and baking it with some white wine. I plan on trying this myself soon.

It wasn't the mascarpone spinach stuffing that turned me off here. In the last few years, I have been liking salmon less and less, and believe it has something to do with the fact that most salmon available is farm-raised. I keep trying new recipes with it because it used to be my fish of choice, but whatever happened to fresh, Atlantic salmon? Anyway, my boyfriend loved it, and I would agree that it was a great presentation and very easy to make. Therefore, my issue here is not with the recipe, but with the fish. I'm wracking my brain trying to figure out what palatable fish I could use in place of salmon in this recipe. Any ideas, anyone?

Friends of mine, who are terrific cooks, made this dish several weeks ago for a dinner party. Everyone raved about it! I made it and found that it is very simple to make and delicious. This will become a standard dish in my house. I used the remaining mascapone in macaroni and cheese a few nights later...thus justifying the cost of the cheese.

Well, there are a lot better salmon recipes out there, trust me. Although I do like the suggestion of the boursin cheese. Overall, it lacked zing.

I made this last week and neither my boyfriend or I was astounded by it. I felt it to be very boring and I followed the recipe exactly. I was very disappointed by marscapone...it certainly wasn't worth the price. The presentation was lovely but the dinner was bland.

I am a personal chef and made this recipe for four clients - all loved it. I did cheat and use thawed frozen spinach, of course drained. Depending on how thick your salmon is will determine a longer cooking time. 10 minutes per inch of thickness. Both ways are great. One client said it looked just like the picture!

Wow! This has become my husband's favorite way to have salmon. Great for entertaining and very easy to do. I followed the recommendation and served with fried potatos. Also served grilled asparagus and green onions in balsamic vinegar with it. I disagree with other comments about needing to cook it longer. I used a convection oven, and it was picture perfect in exactly 12 minutes.

This dish is a great way to prepare salmon. It is very easy to do and tastes wonderful. Both times I have made it, I used only half the fish and stuffing, but made the whole recipe of breading and used most of it. I did have to bake it longer than the recipe said.

I love spinach and I love salmon so I decided to try this one.....the only change I made was substituting the cream cheese for creme fraiche. We really enjoyed it. The crust was delicious and added some texture to the dish. I agree with other reviewers that maybe a lighter fish such as sole or flounder might complement the stuffing better. I made this with an arugula, red onion and tomato salad for some friends and they loved it so I think it is a do-over.

This is a dish I like...very simple and yet it looks like you spent hours! Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. I found the mascarpone at the local Giant Eagle and bought skinless Salmon at Sams Club. It was Great!! I too had to cook a little longer than the recipe called for to brown the bread crumbs. I would definitly make again.

I only used cream cheese in the stuffing because I didn't have any mascarpone. I also used frozen chopped spinach. It was easy to work with and required little preparation. The stuffing was pretty good - but what I really liked was the "crust" that you press into the salmon. It really made the dish. I had to cook a little longer than suggested. I will definately make this dish again as a quick and easy weeknight meal.

My husband thought this was very good, I was a little less enthusiastic. It wasn't difficult to make, but like some of the other reviewers, I liked the stuffing and the fish, but not necessarily together.

This was really delicious. Aside from finally finding marscapone and being shocked at its price, this dish was excellent. It was very easy to make and looked great. The servings were large - you could probably half each filet to serve everyone.

This dish was delicious and easy to prepare. I, too, used panko which lent a nice crunch. It would be perfect for entertaining. We served with a fried oyster appetizer - this made a very rich meal. Next time, I'd keep any accompanying dishes light.

We thought this recipe was fantastic. I used Panko because I didn't have any other bread crumbs and it turned out great. This is a definite keeper.

My 16 year old's best friend thought this was good and he's not a big fish eater. I used only low fat cream cheese and enough nutmeg to smell good. A pinch is described and 1/16 to 1/8 tsp., depending on your source. I used frozen individually packaged salmon from Costco that worked beautifully.

My husband and I thought the salmon was terrific. Simple to prepare, nice presentation, and very tasty. I used salmon without skin and used a generous pinch of freshly grated nutmeg, salt and pepper. I didn't find it bland at all.

This receipe was really rich. Next time, I think that I will decrease the cheese to spinach ratio. Tasted good but again just too rich.

I'm SOOO disappointed. I LOVE mascarpone cheese, but somehow this didn't work. I expected much more than the reasonably bland flavor that I got. Don't get me wrong - nothing with a buttered bread crumb and parmesan crust could possibly taste BAD, it just didn't blow me out of the water. All of these positive reviews tell me perhaps it was me. Couple of things that could have gone wrong: 1) not sure whether the "pinch" of nutmeg I used was too little; 2) not sure whether the mascarpone I used wasn't "good" (it was pricey though). I'm looking for a recipe to compete with my favorite basic herbed salmon with beurre blanc and this unfortunately was not it. I might try one more time using more nutmeg and a different brand of mascarpone. But I don't have high hopes.

This is a keeper. I cut it down to serve just two and used all mascarpone. Nice with broiled tomates and a green veggie. Next time, I'll serve it to guests.

So easy and very good. I used only cream cheese and prepackaged parmesean, and it was still delicious. I put the fish under the broiler for a minute to crisp up the breading as mine did not crisp up during the regular baking.

This was really rich but I loved it. It looked really impressive but was so simple. I couldnt find any marscapone so I mixed goat cheese with the creamcheese and spinach and that was real tasty so i probably wont change anything next time. it´s hard to choose between this recipe and "Honey and Soy Glazed Salmon" from this site when i have salmon..both are wonderful!

Sorry to be the bearer of bad news... made this last night, very easy, but WAY TOO RICH! My family loves salmon, but I guess I like it prepared differently. My 7 year old ate 2 bites and said, "It's sooo filling! I can't eat any more." I felt the same way too. My hubby and 3year old loved it. I would probably make it again, with some changes - 1/3 less fat cream cheese with the mascarpone and reduce the butter alot. Something to cut the richness. It did look beautiful, though.

A great weeknite recipe that can be prepared with minimal effort. At first thought the cream cheese and mascapone would make the dish too creamy and rich, but it was quite the contrary. A great preparation for those skinless salmon filets from costco!

Made this last night, reducing it to two servings. I used only mascarpone (since I had to buy if for the recipe - why add cream cheese?) and panko for the bread crumbs (so I wouldn't have to make my own). My husband said it was "restaurant quality." It is very good - not as good as the Pan Seared Tuna with Ginger Shiitake Cream Sauce, but very good and worth repeating. I served it on a bed of spinach with a side of lentils du puy.

Rating: 4
This was REALLY good and easy too. I read the other reviews, and used many suggestions, including using just the mascarpone. As no one in my family is a big spinach fan, I used flat leaf parsley and added a touch of the breadcrumb mixture as well as fresh lemon juice. Overall I would give this a five for flavor, ease of preparation, and any other category!

This was absolutely the best! We both loved it and now can hardly wait to have friends over to experience its decadence. I served it with garlic mashed potates and spinach with red bell pepper, mushrooms and green onions. Great!

This was an awesome recipe. Probably one of the best salmon dishes I've had. I followed the recipe exactly and used my own ground-up bread crumbs, which I thought made the dish. Next time I might try not putting in the nutmeg as I'm not a nutmeg lover, but even with it in it the fish was delicious. I will definitely make this again!

Made this with a trout filet, only used spinach and mascarpone as the stuffing and simply brushed the fish with olive oil and covered in Panko crumbs. Makes a light, quick and different dish for a work night. Great with a glass of Malbec.

My friend recommended this recipe to me and as usual she was right, it was great, my husband who doesn't care for salmon or spinach, even liked it. I had a piece left over and I heated it in the toaster oven on 300 degrees for ten minutes and it came out great.

This is a wonderful make ahead entree. I assembled it early in the day, then popped it into the oven while we were eating our salad. It was perfectly cooked when we plated it after the salad. I used only mascarpone with the spinach as I wanted that subtle, sweet flavor of the cheese to prevail. This is a winner.

A different and excellent way to make fish. I made this on a weeknight so I used the salmon as called for but used frozen chopped spinach I had on hand (thawed,squeezed dry)instead of fresh. Also, could not find mascarpone before I wanted to make this so I omitted it - the dish was still very good. Great for a simple, quick dish.

Great dish. Cooking for 2 I only needed 1 Tablespoon of each cheese and about 10 spinach leaves. I used 1 Tablespoon of butter and a handfull of Panko for the topping. It was great.
