LOVE this recipe. I add dried pears, use extra butter and combine Snoqualmie Chardonnay (from Trader Joe's) and broth in a 50/50 ratio. Absolutely delicious!

This is the best cornbread dressing I've ever eaten. Of course like many cooks I couldn't resist changing it a bit. First I wanted a smaller size. I made a regular box of Jiffy mix baked in an 8x8. After I cut it into cubes, it was almost exactly 4 cups, perfect for a 1/2 recipe. I used I large onion (2.5 c), 3 large celery stalks (1.3 c), 4 slices of bacon and 2oz of diced pancetta, 1 T of fresh thyme, 1 T of fresh sage. Used Trader Joes 6.5 pkg 6.5 of chestnuts. I wanted the fruit to add a bright note, so right before baking I mixed in 1 large granny smith apple, 1/2 dice with the cranberries. I didn't add the extra melted butter, but did add i egg and 2 cups of homemade turkey broth. Baked it just as directed in a generously buttered dish. Absolutely fabulous. The taste of cornbread really comes through. Will definitely make this agin. Could be interesting to add toasted pecans instead of chestnuts.

I made this for a friend's potluck and they all said it was the best dressing they ever ate! If you can believe it after three stores I could find no dried apple so used dried pear instead which I think made the dish. The apple might have been too cloying and the pear was just subtle and sweet enough. A word on the bacon... I browned and drained methodically and when you add it back to the mix and add the liquid it becomes again moist and might I say almost undercooked looking. You want to bacon for the taste but not necessarily for the look so feel free to really grind up and sprinkle the bacon throughout the dish once it's been thoroughly cooked. And because of course it's the holidays and all is better with butter, I added a stick of melted butter in addition to the stock for the moisture element and it was as expected, wonderful. This was the first year I used prepackaged "roasted' chestnuts and out of the package the taste was WORRISOME! But after being incorporated into the stuffing and baked you really couldn't tell the difference. The two hours saved roasting and peeling fresh was well worth it.

When you make this stuffing with the mix, you only need to use one 16 oz package to fill a 13X9 pan. I did this, ended up using half the onions, celery, and nuts and the full amount of bacon, apples, and spices. I also used 2 1/2 cans of chicken broth. I substituted toasted pine nuts when I couldn't find chestnuts anywhere. It was good, much better than the stuffings I've had before, but I'm probably going to keep looking for an even tastier one next year.

Dont shortcut the cornbread!! Its worth the effort and doesnt take that much effort or time. This is a wonderful stuffing and can be used with Pork, Poultry, and Beef or Lamb. This is one you have to just love if you are a cornbread stuffing fan and if not you gotta try this one!!

I have made this two years in a row at Thanksgiving and my husband has requested that it be a regular from now on. I made it with homemade cornbread. I also increased the bacon and sage and only used about half the celery. The first year I made it with the recommended amount and thought it had too much celery in it. I also tried it this year with only half the chestnuts because they are exhorbitantly expensive here and it was still great -- maybe because of the extra bacon.

I made this for my family of 20+ for Thanksgiving and everyone raved, my aunt is now going to make it for Christmas too. I added more broth than it called for to make it more moist since that is my mom's preference. It was a huge hit and the flavors were wonderful. Both of my parents are gourmet chefs and I grew up in the restaurant industry and it definitely makes the grade. Enjoy!

An excellent stuffing. The flavors complement each other so well. My guests cleaned out the bowl!

This one is a keeper! I made two stuffings for Thanksgiving, and this was the favorite by far. I went easy on the celery, and added extra bacon, apple, and thyme. Home-made cornbread (a few days old) made it special as well.

I substituted dried craberries for the apples and added 3 cloves chopped garlic. Fantastic!

This was good, but not great. My husband didn't think he'd like it, but later confessed that it was better than he expected - I think that was because he just wanted a simple traditional dressing/stuffing (for his turkey and gravy) and it tasted pretty close to a simple traditional dressing/stuffing.

I used fresh baked cornbread and dried it couple of days before making the stuffing. It was excellent. My guests raved about the stuffing for days. Definitely will make this one again. To cheat, Whole Foods Market sells freshly baked cornbread for stuffing, expensive but worth it if you're cooking everything during the holidays.

I made this stuffing to go with an herb roasted turkey and it was amazing! I used an apple wood smoked bacon that was delicious, but slightly overwhelmed the over-all flavor of the stuffing. I also used fresh apple instead of dried which was still delicious. Just be prepared it makes a ton!

The stuffing is good, delicious even, however the flavor of the chestnuts, bacon and apples is overwhelmed by the cornbread stuffing mix. It just gets lost. Everyone ate the stuffing, liked it but I wouldnt say anyone thought it was great or singled it out as their favorite part of the meal.

Made this T'giving and it was a huge hit. Left out the chestnuts as many other reviewers did. We grill our bird, so I oven-baked the stuffing. For a half recipe, used 2 cans of chicken broth, and one bag 16 0z. bag of Peppridge Farms cornbread stuffing. Moist and flavorful, this will definitely be on the table next year tool

To the cook from Boston, MA I have not made this dish yet but am thinking to make this. I think the 2 16-ounce package sounds correct. 1 cup is equal to 8-ounce so 2 cups would be 16-ounces and 4 cups would be 32-ounces. But since this is a package not yet made into cornbread, I'm assuming that it would rise and make twice as much which would equal to 8 cups. Hope that helps.

I made this last year and it was delicious, so I'd like to make it again. But can anyone shed light on the confusion about the amount of cornbread stuff? Last year, I saw "two 16-ounce bags" and just threw them both in ... I think. Then I realized that was way more than the recipe seemed to call for, but I added more broth and it all came out well. I'd just do that again if I were sure that's what I did. Eight cups is less than ONE 16-ounce bag, is it not? Also, I used fresh apples instead of dried for some reason. Didn't hurt it any. I got the jars of peeled chestnuts at Trader Joe's.

The subtleness of the stuffing was overpowered by the other zillion dishes I made for Thanksgiving dinner. When I tried it again the next day, I was amazed at how delicious it really was. Will definitely make again, but for special Sunday dinners where it can be the star of the show.

My husband & I prepared this dish for our first Thanksgiving together. It was a huge hit with his family. I left out the chestnuts as I am not a fan. The stuffing was moist & tasty. This is our new family tradition.

I made this for a party (a cooking competition) and everyone seemed to like it. I think they all liked it more than I did. I was kinda lazy and didn't chop up the dried apples, I just used them in the slices that come out of the bag. I think next time I will cut them up more. Also, I would suggest using more bacon than the recipe calls for. I mean, who doesn't like bacon!

Dang, this was good!! Especially good stuffed into the turkey, and the rest baked in a casserole was pretty tasty too. I used artisan bread stuffing instead of cornbread, and the leftovers even tasted great, and I am not a big leftovers fan.

Was fantastic! The only difficulty with this dish was finding jarred roasted chestnuts. Though roasting my own was time consuming - the effort was rewarded with great results.

Very tasty. Didn't want to pay $20 for 2 jars of chestnuts so we roasted and peeled 1.5 lbs of fresh to get approx. 1 lb peeled (soaked before roasting per "to roast chestnuts" from Gourmet magazine on this site). Stuffing was delicious, though at first I wasn't sure the chestnuts were worth all the work (considered substituting toasted pecans). However, as leftovers, the bacon and dried apples had mellowed and the chestnuts stood out more... Amount of cornbread dressing a typo? I used 2 6-oz packages of Mrs. Cubbisons and got 8 cups...

Very good. I did use half Earthgrains cornbread stuffing mix and half Pepperidge Farms herb seasoned bread stuffing mix since I don't like all cornbread. It did need more liquid than the recipe called for. I used my own flavorful turkey stock and also added a couple of eggs. I found "shrinkwrapped" packages of chestnuts at a gourmet deli. They worked well.

This is the best stuffing I have ever eaten. Very easy to prep in advance and add bread crumbs when turkey comes out. Chestnuts are a pain to peel but make the average stuffing above average. I also used some of the stock from the turkey pan for extra flavor.

This stuffing was a huge hit with my family. I couldn't find roasted chestnuts, so I added water chestnuts instead. The bacon and dried apples made it very flavorful.
