YUM! yes, cut back on butter, does not need all of it. also, I did not peal apples and it was a good call. I used small potatos, skin was fine on, did not peel. Did not cool sauce before tossing, did not seem to matter, was GREAT!

Loved this! We made to accompany a pork dish. Next time I will add the apples 40 min through the 60 min cooking time. I used granny smith and sweet onions. It turned out delicious and browned beautifully so I didn't have the presentation issue some reviewers mentioned. I halved the butter as well.

I've made this twice now and I'm only rating 3 forks as written [closer to 2.5 but I'm feeling generous ;-) ] I thought - as others have noted - that the sugar was unecessary and the amt of butter was way too much. And why so much peeling? The skin of the potato varieties listed is very thin and adds flavor. The 2nd time I made it, I cut out the sugar, dropped butter to 1/4 cup - used olive oil for the rest, subbed rosemary for thyme and didn't bother peeling either apples or potatoes. I liked the 2nd version MUCH better. BTW - not peeling the apples helps them hold their shape.

Wonderful. I'm casein-sensitive which means no dairy, so I substituted duck fat for the butter and used 7-8 tablespoons instead of 12. It's an outstanding dish. Pretty sure next time I'll cut some of the cooking time. It was a tad overdone for my taste. --Siena in Seattle.

well...this recipe is a bit 'meh'. it's tasty enough (baked apples and caramelized onions, what could go wrong?) but certainly not too exciting. i think the savory-ness needs to be amped up quite a bit. anyways, i cut down on the butter as other reviews suggested, and omitted the sugar. i made this as a side to some hot sausages in tomato sauce. but i think in this flavor group you'd be better off making some pork with apple and onion, and roasted potatoes (or a conventional gratin) on the side.

Wow, what an interesting dish! The flavor is really wonderful. The combination of thyme, apple, onion & potato is so sweet and hearty. I halved the recipe, still thinking I'd have leftovers, but it was gone. I'll definitely make more next time. I used sherry since i didn't have any dry white wine, and I'm completely satisfied with the result. Yummy!

This is the fist time I've made a gratin without cheese and cream and it was great! I was skeptical when I pulled it out of the oven because it looked rather bland, but the flavors turned out nicely. I used all the butter called for, but I think you could easily cut it down and it would be fine, if really want to cut out some fat.

Made this for a dinner party - it really complemented the pork rib roast I made. Everyone raved about it and wanted the recipe. I too used Pink Lady apples and cut back on the butter. Will definitely make again!

This is EXCELLENT. Has become a family favorite.

A refreshing and lighter change from the usual gratins. Next time I might try subsituting yams for a portion of the potatoes to see how that turns out.

I made this dish for an Oktoberfest pot luck. Goes very well with Bratwusrt, and red cabbage. The flavors are wondeful together. I did cut back the amout of butter asothers have reccommended. I used only 6 Tablespons. Came out great !!!

I followed this recipe almost exactly and it was absolutely amazing. I substitued 2 packets of Splenda for the 4 tsp of sugar and that worked very well. I think the wine (I used a Chardonnay) added an excellent flavor to the dish and used Pink Lady apples. There is quite a bit of butter in the recipe, so I think I will try to reduce that the next time.

PS on the recommendation of a reveiw I used vermouth. I would not do that next time I make it

This recipe is amazing. It is very unusual, flavours exquisite. In reading the reviews I reduced both butter and sugar( added 1/4 of the amount). However next time, I will add more sugar. According to rewiews it was too sweet at full recipe quantity , next time I will reduce by only 50%, the recipe needs the sugar, to reduce the tartness of the apple /onion combination. I will definitely make this again to serve at a dinner party. Be sure to carmelize your onions well. The less carmelized the more sugar needs to be added. Carmelizing adds an added sweetness to the flavour

A very nice dish, great flavor, easy to do. Served it with pork crown roast. Used German butterball potatoes and pink Lady apples. Only minus - it's not too appealing visually. Will def. make it again.

Absolutely delicious. When I make it again, however, I'm going to cut down on the butter

I followed the recipe and the result was truly delicious. I served it with roasted chicken (with olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and herbes de provence). Unlike other reviewers, my apples kept their shape quite well. I actually decided on this recipe because I bought a box of "bio" apples that turned out quite "hard and tart", rather for cooking than eating raw. Definitely making this again!

Maybe it's the choice of Granny Smith's, but mine turned to mush too. If I make again, I will try with another of the recommended apple varieties. And definitely cut the butter, salt and sugar as suggested in previous reviews.

I halved this and made it in a smaller dish (I hear that defies the definition of "gratin," oh well) and it was perfectly crispy -- no mush. Maybe that will help. It still served 4 people, and is a wonderful light-ish seasonal side dish while nothing else is growing.

Wonderful. I omitted the wine and halved the butter and sugar. I served it to teenagers who devoured it.

The Granny Smith apples crumbled to sour mush, making an unpleasant contrast to the potatoes. In fact, when I re-heated the leftovers, I scraped out the apples and just ate the potatoes and onions. I did cut the salt in half and skimped on the sugar; the recipe may need those ingredients to counteract the sourness.

I heeded the reviews and cut butter to 4Tbs, used half the salt, omitted the sugar, and used chicken broth instead of wine and water. Served it for brunch and guests enjoyed it.

This is potentially a really healthy recipe. I replaced the butter with virgin olive oil and used sweet and juicy desert apples to replace sugar. As I had no wine to hand, I used a little cider vinegar to give the dish a zing. It was delicious and went with pork sausages really well. A good winter meal.

One of my guests doesn't like thyme so I used rosemary. We liked the dish and will try it again, but I will reduce the amount of butter and some of the sugar.

Fantastic alternative to high calorie potato cheese gratin!! would go well with Pork dishes. Definitely will make it for guests.

We really enjoyed this dish, however I did take other readers suggestions and reduce the butter and salt, I also replaced the water and wine with chicken broth. I would even try it in the future without apples for a different taste.

This sounds like a variation of Potatos Anna, rather than a gratin. Since I like Potatos Anna, I would be willing to try this one. (I neither rated this recipe nor answered yes or no to the question about making it again, so relax.)

A wonderful side dish. I will use a little less butter and sugar the next time I make it.

Rating: 3
This was a really nice change from the typical cheese/cream style. My family really liked it. Took the advice of others and used only a third of the butter, no sugar, vermouth and really caramelised the onions. I does make quite a lot, but it was even better reheated the next day. Will definitely be making this again.

I've made this 3x now. It's great to have a gratin sans cheese. I typically serve it with pork;goes well with the apple. I can whip it up in 15 min and then, time oven cooking with guest arrival, etc...

OK, so I didn't remember it quite right and used chicken stock not wine and omitted the sugar, but it was a perfect supper that cooked itself while we were at the movies. Served it with roast chicken.Everyone loved it!

Very disappointing. I did not like the combination of flavors at all. Judging from the leftover portions on my guests' plates, I don't think they did either.

I thought this sounded yummy, of course after reading the very mixed reviews,I was hesitant to make it. I would not make this again because, first of all, it was time consuming to slice all the ingredients for this large of a recipe, secondly it was an odd mix of sweet and not but I liked the wine (I used dry vermouth) flavor. If I were to make this again I would definitely omit the apples---It did nothing for me and my boyfriend hated it. He prefers his "sweet" to be dessert(and i omitted ALL the sugar). Also it looked horrible as leftovers--a pile of mush.

No reason to make this again. Does not taste good and is not good for you with all the butter and salt.

Awful, a family of 6 people, didnt like it at all, they all said,... Ma delete this recipe. It had to much salt, or to much wine, I didnt even like the smell of it while it was cooking.

Workable recipe. If you don't like thyme with apples, which I now know I don't, this is not the recipe for you. The potatoes and onions were delish; might try again with either Herbes de Provence or without the apples. Cut the butter - it makes little difference.

A half teaspoon of sugar and a half teaspoon of salt per person?? Ye gods, what a way to kill the taste buds! Cut it way back, along with the butter. The produce then just might have a chance.

Great dish! It's nice to find a gratin recipe that is still flavorful without cream or cheese. I agree that the butter amount can be reduces.

I had two problems with this dish. First, the ingredients would not fit in the 13x9x2 baking dish. Secondly, the sugar was totally unnecessary. The result was tasty but way too sweet for our tastes. Also, this is recipe for 8 servings but it was more like 16 when seved as a side dish with a roast and salad.

A true winner! Love an apple and onion combo so knew this recipe would be very good, but it was way beyond good. Simply outstanding flavours! Followed the recipe with these exceptions: reduced butter to 1/2 cup in total (too much as written), 1 tbsp dried thyme instead of fresh, omitted sugar (husband is diabetic), used white vermouth instead of wine (a Julia Child recommendation). The carmelized onions add so much flavour, so take your time and don't rush that step. My oven runs a little hot, so reduced temp to 375 and the timing was right on. So very delicious served with grilled pork chops. Mmmmm,mmmmm, can't say enough good things about this yummy potato dish. Bravo Epicurious!
