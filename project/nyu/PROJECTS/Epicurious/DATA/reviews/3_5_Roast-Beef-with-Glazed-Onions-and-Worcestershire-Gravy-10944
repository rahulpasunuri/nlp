This recipe is only OK, and is certainly nothing to waste an expensive cut of beef on. First of all, the "gravy" would be better off described as "tomato sauce". Even though I substituted half the water for red wine (as suggested) and added a LOT of beef drippings, it was still REALLY disappointing. It was bland and tasted like a thick pasta sauce. In order to rescue the sauce, I added a full can of beeth broth concentrate (canned), some extra wine and a lot of salt, and then reduced the liquid. After these steps, it was definitely worth eating on the beef and on mashed potatoes, but I would only use this recipe again with a less expensive cut of meat or if I needed enough "gravy" to feed a whole lot of people!

I've been an ardent fan of Epicurious.com for years. What took me so long to find this recipe! I did what many of the previous reviews suggest - added halved button mushrooms, garlic, substituted 1/2C of water with 1/2C of red wine. The roast took longer than expected, but the end result is still perfect as long as you monitor the temperature of the meat with a thermometer. Save this recipe!

Very good, though my guests wanted well done meat which didn't turn out as well. I substituted the water with wine, but next time will probably just sub half the water with wine. Very good flavor, though.

Wow! Finally a roast beef recipe to be proud of. I followed a couple of the other reviewers advice and used 1/2 wine and 1/2 water, and a smaller pan (a 10" cast iron skillet) to prevent the onion mixture from burning. I ended up using a cheaper cut of meat so I just roasted it longer on a lower temp. Can't wait to serve this to company.

easy and delicious. My husband loved it at first bite. Added the garlic and the red wine like others suggested. I also added thick cut mushrooms to the veggies and that was wonderful.

Really not worth the effort. The onions were by far the best part of the meal. The beef was completely bland, and so was the gravy. A waste of perfectly good beef.

Sorry - my first 2 forker. Husband thought it was a nice change, but I didn't care for the gravy - too tomato-ey for my tastes. Roast turned out great though - very tender.

YUM! Seasoned the roast with a fresh herb mixture overnite, did the suggested tweaking - red wine etc. Served it with rosemary and dill roasted potatoes and green beans for a small get together. Rave reviews. Definately a keeper.

I couldn't find the correct cut of meat on short notice so made it with another. The meat was not great, but the gravy was fabulous and really easy. I'd definitely make it again with the right meat this time.

This is, without a doubt, the worst roast I've ever tasted. The onion-tomato "mixture", as it is called, was both bland and aesthetically un-pleasing when arranged on the serving platter. The meat was bland, as well, and only edible when drowned in the gravy, which was the only redeeming quality of the meal. I used the gravy to top garlic-cilantro mashed potatoes, which I recommend. I will not add this recipe to my repertoire and am so thankful that we did not have company over for dinner that evening.

My family loved this. The gravy proved just a little spicy for my 6 year old, but that doesn't take much! Tasted great, inexpensive, easy, and quick to make. Can't ask more than that.

I have made this twice and my very picky family has enjoyed it both times. I cut the sauce recipe in half and we still had a lot left over. I bake this for about 25 minutes per pound to get a medium-well done roast. I also half of the water for wine. Try this recipe, I think you will like it.

Like previous reviewers, I added garlic, wine and roasted meat/onions in small pan. I used a cross rib roast (had one in fridge). Encrusted it with kosher salt and black pepper. The steam from the onions braised it a little and kept it tender. I also finished roasting at 275 to ensure tenderness. Even with this cut of meat the dish turned out great!

Rating: 2
I followed the recipe, but it didn't turn out well. I didn't have a thermometer, but the 12 minutes per pound left the middle and bottom of the roast raw and the outside only medium rare. Also the onions weren't cooked nearly enough, especially those under the roast. As another reviewer suggested, I used a pan that was only slightly bigger than the roast, and the roast kept the onions from cooking I think. And I'd say the gravy was only passable. I used wine instead of water as suggested. I'd try it again, but get a thermometer (and cook it longer), use a bigger roasting pan, and only use half wine/half water. leftovers were delicious quick fried as steaks for one meal and chopped and made into cheese steak for another (lots of leftovers since kids wouldn't touch it).

This dish is mouth-watering! It was so easy to make, I can't believe it. I used a boneless beef shoulder roast because that's just what I happened to have that was fresh. I did cook my roast a little longer than required but it suited my taste just fine. The gravy was delicious. The meat was very tender. It was the perfect recipe!

Oh my god! This was one of the best things that I have ever made! And it was so easy! I did make a few changes- while the tomatoes (to which I added some pearl onions- I had run out of regular onions) were roasting- I browned the meat with a mixture of salt, pepper, a bit of paprika and some cayenne. I then deglazed the pan with a bit of red wine, and used this instead of the water for the sauce. This was so so tasty. I can't wait for an excuse to make it again.

Took the advise of previous reviewers and the result was delicious. I can count on one hand the number of times I've cooked a roast and don't know what I was thinking when I decided to invite guests and serve roast beef. But this recipe seems to be fool-proof. Especially when you rely on previous reviewers tips. I thank you and my guests thank you! Served with horseradish mashed potatoes, roasted asparagus and yorkshire pudding.

This was just delicious!!! The best roast beef recipe we ever had. The glazed onions were out of this world............

This was delicious! Some NECESSARY CHANGES: 1) use a smallish roasting pan (9x9)to prevent burning the onion/tom mix before beef is done. 2) Substite the 1C of water with 1C of wine. The next day we had heated the leftover meat and gravy, spread on a soft toasted roll and added mozzarella cheese on top. Put under broiler to melt - YUM! Horseradish mayo is great for leftovers, too. Just add 2t horsradish to 1/2C mayo.

My family enjoyed this dish - especially the gravy. Next time we'll use the cheaper cut of meat suggested by many of the reviewers.

The roast came out spectacularly -- perfect tenderness -- even great reheated. But, did I do something wrong w/the onion & tomato mixture? By the time the roast was done, all I had left was a small pile of burned onions -- so had nothing to work w/in making pan gravy.

With all the previous rave reviews, I was really expecting more from this recipe. I even added the garlic and red wine as the others suggested -but still found it to be rather mediocre. I used a boston cut, the sauce was the right consistency and everything - just boring. Will keep looking. Sorry!

Thanks to all the previous reviewers regarding cut of meat and pan size. I used a 9 x 9 pan and 2 lbs.sirloin tri tip which had been cut into 4 pieces. I tied the pieces together and followed the recipe instructions except to use the tomato juices in place of the water in the gravy. I think that red wine and garlic as suggested by others would enhance this dish, but it's excellent on it's own. Thanks also to the reviewer for mashed goat cheese potatoes. I used feta and garlic in the potatoes which went great with the gravy, too.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious. Added 3 cloves garlic to onions and roasted for 20/30 minutes. Seared the roast first. Substituted a good merlot for water. Adding the juice back in from the crushed/drained tomatoes probably made sauce a little thin, but I cooked it down for a while. Was even better next day. Probably would not use eye roast next time..needs a more tender cut of meat. Absolutely awsome but wondering how this recipe would be using chicken.

This was a wonderful recipe. Here are the changes I made after reading other reviews: I first browned the roast. I used a cheaper cut of meat and because I was concerned about it being tough, I cooked it on top of the stove for 2 hours before I started this recipe. I roasted the onions and tomatoes in the oven as directed. I used canned diced tomatoes with Italian seasonings. Since I was cooking the meat on top of the stove and I had browned it first, it made more sense to me to add the ingredients to to this pan. I used a mixture of red wine and leftover tomato sauce instead of the cup of water. I cooked everything until the meat was falling apart tender. I cut back on the amount of Worcestershire sauce as other reviewers did. It was excellent! I will make this many times again.

This recipe was awesome. The sauce was very flavorful. I served it with goat cheese mashed potatoes which were perfect with the tasty gravy. Thanks to Scott from Michigan regarding the pan size tip. I think I was the only person that wound up with borderline burnt onions the first time I made this dish; the gravy was a little bitter. I made it a second time with a smaller pan and it turned out perfectly. I also used a sirloin tip roast and wine instead of water.

This sauce was awesome!!! The meat was just so-so, but I didn't use a rib roast so that's probably why. The leftovers make excellent beef vegetable barley soup. I seared the roast first before adding the onions and tomatoes to the same pan. I also substituted the tomato juice that was strained out and added enough beef broth to make 2 cups. I still can't believe how flavorful this was with so few ingredients. It felt weird not using garlic but I went with it anyway and it turned out great! Definately will try again. Would taste great with pork too and maybe add some chourice (we're portuguese if it has tomatoes chances are there's chourice too!)

This was a great recipe and I even used it with a chuck roast. The trick to not runing the vegetables was to match the roasting pan to the size of the meat. I had a three pound chuck roast that fit nearly perfect in a 9 x 9 baking dish. The vegetables were completely covered at turned out perfect. I also substituted a chianti for the water.

Rating: 4
I, too, used a Sirloin Tip Roast. I only used two large white onions and that seemed to be enough. Substituted a cup of wine for the water and added two cloves of garlic to the onion tomato mixture. I agree with the previous poster, I should have used all of the tomato onion mixture to make the gravy. They were unedible, so I would have had more gravy for left overs. Great recipe!

Rating: 4
Used a 3&1/4 pound sirloin tip that I covered with a mongolian beef rub about two hours before cooking. Following the suggestions of others I cooked onions for about 20 minutes before adding the beef and used a red zin instead of water. I also added some summer savory to the onions. I cooked the beef to about 125 and let it rest for the thirty minutes. Outstanding taste.

An amazing recipe. I used a Sirloin Tip, and followed other's advise to carmelize the onions/tomato's for an extra 5 minutes. Fresh tomato's and two cloves chopped garlic, were added to the onions..(I'll used canned in the winter!!.) Seasoned my roast well with peppercorns and sea salt. I FORGOT to add the worchesteshire, however this gravy was amazing. Oh yes...and I did not put aside the onions and tom's, they were TOO cooked and not enough of them, so I made the gravy with the works. Unbelieveable! Hubby and I agreed that this was perhaps the best roast, and gravy I had every made. A keeper for sure!

The sauce was delicious and so very easy, I did add the reserved tomato juice and enough red wine to equal one cup, instead of water, when adding the broth.

I also made the mistake of buying a chuck cross rib roast! I did everything exactly as written and had a raw stringy piece of meat on my hands! Now as I type the meat & sauce are in my cast iron dutch oven with the additions of carrots, potatoes, parsnips and the reserved onion/tomato mixture on top. It's going to be a long cooking experience and I hope we have an edible piece of meat

The glazed onions & sauce were incredible, and turned a rather ordinary sirloin tip into a delicious, complex & amazing meal. However, I made a couple of changes to the recipe -- I left out the Worcestershire sauce, and used a bit of tomato paste, water & some leftover spag. sauce instead of the canned tomatoes which I didn't have on hand. I also browned the roast before adding it to the onion mixture. It's hard to believe that such a simple recipe could be so good!

My boyfriend *loved* it -- and watched wistfully while I packed away the leftovers (we're watching our respective waistlines). I bought a meat thermometer for the occasion and took the meat out when it registered 140-degrees. It was still quite rare (for my taste) but the aforementioned b/f said it was *perfect*. Perhaps I'm not a roast beef-lovin' kinda girl at heart? I would also half the worcestershire sauce in the gravy. Came on a wee bit strong.

I had an eye of round roast that I needed to cook so found this recipe and decided to try it. Everyone loved it. I increased the onions because we all love carmelized onions and I also carmelized them a bit longer. The recipe was very easy and the resting time for the roast makes it easy to get all your accompanying dishes finished. Will definitely use again.

I sprinkled just a pinch of hicory smoked salt on the roast for a slightly different flavor, (the second time I made it). It is delicious either way. Serve with garlic parmesan mashed potatoes and sautees swiss chard.

People liked it so much the first time I made it again. I liked it better the first time because I used fresh chopped tomatoes and didn't have as much onion as called for. The less Onion was crispier. Also I cooked mine to 125 internal temperature and loved it. The worchester sauce was a little to worscesterie

This was an easy and yummy recipe. I would suggest cooking the onions longer, I like mine a bit more carmelized, I also did a side of potatoes and mushrooms in a bit of beef broth and sherry. All together it was a big hit!

Very good. I tripled the recipe for a party and everyone loved it. Be careful to watch the temp of the meat closely. I cooked it for less than it said and took it out at 130 yet it was still medium well. Next time I'll take it out at no more than 125 because the carry-over cooking is significant.
