If you are looking for a great way to prepare pistachios, try the recipe for ginger-glazed almonds. (It's on this site, and in Gourmet Dec. '02). I made it using shelled, unsalted pistachios and they're just delicious.

Good recipe, try red curry (hotter). Enjoyed by many a parties or on desk at work as a nice distraction. Even tried on ice cream hmmmmmm pistachios.

This recipe was good, but a vital ingredient was missing - a little heat. I added a teaspoon of cayenne pepper which made all the difference.

Good flavor, but nothing special. There are cheaper versions of already made spicy nuts that are just as good if not better. Enjoyed them (pistachios are my favorite nut), but will move on to something else..... KIMBER

It was my experience that the pistachio-lovers at my party preferred the unadulterated pistachios. This recipe did, however, inspire me to try my hand at Pistachio Brittle.

A must-try for pistachio lovers! If you can't find unsalted pistachios, be sure to omit the salt from the recipe. I adapted this to make a chex party mix and added some dried tart cherries for color and sweetness. Delicious and very festive looking. I will be adding these nuts to my Christmas goodie baskets.
