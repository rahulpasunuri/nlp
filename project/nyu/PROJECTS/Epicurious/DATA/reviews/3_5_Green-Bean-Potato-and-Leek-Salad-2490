The flavors are delicious. I mean, the combination of potatoes with vinegar/mustard are on a Germanic girls fave list. In my opinion, though, there was a big detractor: the green beans and potatoes tasted fine but did not look good when presented together. I might dress both separately and then place the beans atop the potatoes, or cut the beans into teeny pieces.

Loved, loved, loved it! We added grilled chicken strips and used the eggs crushed with a fork and sprinkled on the salad as a garnish. It was a huge hit. Will make many more times!

This was great. I used green beans, potatoes & leeks from the garden. If you don't have leeks, I'd still make it. The hard boiled egg, though, really doesn't do anything for it. I'd leave it out next time. My kids, of course, wouldn't touch it due to the vinaigrette. A wonderful way to use a plethora of green beans from the garden.

Very easy and tasty too. I used green onions instead of leeks, left out the hard boiled eggs, and added feta cheese. The feta was a great addition; it goes really well with the dressing. I added chopped garlic and lemon juice to the dressing too.

Very easy and very good. I added chopped bacon and used shallots instead of leeks. I recommend you pour the dressing over the salad JUST before you serve it. Otherwise, the potatoes will soak up the dressing.
