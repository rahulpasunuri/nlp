Wonderful savory squash soup...I've made several recipes for butternut squash soup and this is by far my favorite!

I loved the soup! I made a few changes. I had a huge squash so I added 7 cups of squash and one Granny Smith apple. I roasted the squash and apple, and added it to the soup(used low salt vegetable stick). To make things easier, I used an immersion blender and the soup was creamy and delicious. I wouldn't bother with the croutons next time, just a crusty bread would work.

I made a much easier version--bought cubed frozen squash from the market (but still used fresh spices), and just served warm bread with the soup. Great for my uncle who's on a diet (no dairy if you just use olive oil). Also, added extra squash and used vegetable broth as this was the main course for vegetarians at Thanksgiving. Put in a little ginger and white pepper, then used an immersion blender to make life really easy. Overall, very good--probably better if I'd followed the recipe perfectly, but I just didn't have the time/resources. Simple, too.

I decided to add some cornstarch with water to thicken the soup up. It tasted absolutely amazing. I also added parm cheese to the breadcubes. Will definitely make this soup again!

I had some extra sage from a previous recipe and was in the mood for something warm! This is an excellent and smooth soup. My modifications: I used 3 cups of low-sodium chicken broth and one cup of apple cider (we had just pressed some the day before so I couldn't resist), eliminated the parsley and upped the fresh sage to 4 teaspoons. I also roasted the squash at 400 for 45 minutes, as I love the "roasting" flavor. Next time I'd only use olive oil (no butter), but other than that it's a perfect butternut squash and sage soup recipe.

Thanks for all the suggestions. I roasted the squash, used only 4 cups of broth, upped the amount of sage and kept the bread in cubes to make croutons, not breadcrumbs. Delicious!

Really Excellent! I have made this soup over and over again with rave reviews evertime. Instead of breadcrumbs however; I take really delicious whole grain bread and tear the bread slices into bite size pieces and saute in butter with sea salt, pepper and sage until lightly browned and delicious.

Excellent! Nice comfort food. The bread crumbs are tasty but they get soggy quickly; maybe croutons would be better.

This recipe was absolutely worth the time it took to make it! I roasted the squash seasoned with cumin, doubled the garlic and used 4 cups of broth. I am not known for my cooking skills, but this soup turned out delicious.

I improvised pretty heavily on this recipe. First, I replaced the parsley and sage with fresh rosemary and thyme. Second, I only used 4 cups of chicken stock and then I added a half cup of water and a half cup of apple cider. I used basic, dry bread crumbs instead of the fried version the recipe suggests and was very happy with the results.

A deliciously creamy soup, and healthy too! I omitted the breadcrumbs, so I upped the flavor by roasting the squash with some cumin and cayenne for a little extra kick. Can't wait to make this again.

I like how easy the soup is to make, and it's a great hearty soup for the winter. I roasted the squash, and also used some carrots since i didn't have a big squash. The sage and the breadcrumbs add nice flavor. I ended up only using 4 cups of broth since I like a thicker soup

Gave this four forks because it was easy to make without a ton of special ingredients, and the taste and texture were excellent. My modifications included roasting the squash, omitting parsley, using 4 cups broth, and using 2 cloves garlic. I also added some fresh parmesan to the bread crumbs. It was smooth and silky, and just as good the next day.

I made this tonight because butternuts came in my CSA box and I had most of the rest of the ingredients on hand. I didn't have fresh sage but subbed ~1.5t. of dried and that seems to have worked out ok - the sage flavor is good but not overwhelming. Per other reviewer's suggestions, I doubled the garlic. The end result was still a bit bland (I skipped the breadcrumbs in order to save on calories and I'm sure those add a lot of flavor). To boost the flavor a bit without adding many calories, I added about half a teaspoon of freshly ground nutmeg after blending, and served with a little grated parmigiano reggiano on top. These little additions made a big difference; I'm sure I'll make this again.

I made another recipe on this site and had some leftover squash and thought I would try this. I really enjoyed this soup, it was uncomplicated but tasty, but fresh sage is a must. Instead of the "breadcrumbs" I made croutons using a whole wheat pane (trader joe's) added a little EVOO to the recipe and baked for about 10 mins. or so. I loved the crunch and the contrast.

Definitely roast the squash first - it adds nice depth of flavor. I have made this using pumpkin, too. It is equally good.

Made this tonight with precut squash and did the bread crumbs in the oven -- fairly easy and as I made it for 2 people -I changed the proportions by eye so when I poured in my unmeasured stock it was not too soupy-- I is very good but a kick could be added-- ginger sounds good but has anyone tried lemon zest?

A good soup for Fall meals. Be prepared to labour for this soup! The consistency was moderate and not too runny. The flavour was sweet, pleasing, and hinted at the tartness of gourds. The sage offered a bit too much bitterness, but is always welcome with sweetness. The soup quickly thickens as it cools, so eating it in one sitting is recommended.

Delicious! I imagine roasting the squash can't hurt, but we were plenty happy with this as is. I doubled the sage in the soup, used slightly more garlic than the recipe called for and went without the breadcrumbs. Pre-cut squash made this an easy soup to make.

Incredible. I roasted the squash prior to the pot, and used homemade chicken stock. Excellent even without breadcrumbs. Using it as a diet soup to keep from buying prepackaged diet foods. Will make over and over (regardless of low-cal property).

The soup was relatively easy to make and had good flavor but I like the idea of roasting the squash next time instead of the stovetop cooking. Also, I found the soup to be much thinner than it looks in the photo. Perhaps I didn't cook it long enough or pureed it too much but mine was a lot more brothy than creamy. If I do it again, I'll use 4 c. stock to start instead of 5.

Very tasty and fairly easy to make. I used veg stock (homemade) and it turned out wonderful. The breadcrumbs made the soup. Without them, the soup was tasty, but nothing special. They added flavor and some texture contrast that really improved the soup.

Delicious recipe. Made it with vegetable broth and add some additional spices of cumin and thyme instead of the sage to give it a more Mediterranean feel. Did not use the sage breadcrumbs but instead made a grilled vegetable gremolota to top it with. Absolutely excellent.

What a pleasant introduction to this vegetable! I've never had butternut squash before and this recipe has left me eager to see what else I can make with the other squash still in the fridge.

Great soup recipe without heavy CREAM. Recommend adding grated ginger for an extra kick.

I was not a big fan of this soup because I found that cooking the squash instead of roasting it did not bring out its sweetness. Did anyone else have this problem?

Rating: 3
Good hearty healthy soup. However, if using purchased stock, I would suggest low-sodium stock. I also included a Granny Smith apple to counter the sweetness of the squash and add depth of flavor.

greater cold winter night soup. followed the recipe for most part except added some diced extra celery (figured more veg was good for the soul). during the bread crumb phase, i tossed in a bit of grated parmesan and it increased the crunchiness and flavor of the crumbs as they hit the soup. Wife has gone Veg and she loved it.

I thought this soup had a great flavor, but wasn't "over the top amazing". It was fast, but not impressive enough to serve to guests for a dinner party. Also, my soup had a dingy brown color because of the cooked herb and onion mixture. Make sure the onions do not brown too much.

Probably the best non-cream based squash soup I've had. I used Pacific's organic vegetable stock, but can imagine homemade would put this soup over the top. I did crumble just a bit of goat cheese on top. Next time I will bake the breadcrumbs to make them more crouton-like: breadcrumbs were soggy pretty much instantly.

The reason for three forks because I modified the recipe a bit. Used less butter, added couple of chopped carrots and celery to the sauteing onion. Added black pepper to offset the sweetness of the squash, added fresh chopped parsley at the end, and used home made chicken stock which made a huge difference in the flavor. Also, omitted the crumbs. Very flavorful non- creamy soup.

I thought this soup was really good, especially considering how easy it was and how healthy it is. I had a similar soup at a restaurant and they topped it with a few crumbles of bacon and a few small pieces of goat chesse. So, I used Oscar Meyer center cut bacon and put half a slice crumbled up on top along with a few small crumbles of goat cheese. The little hints of extra flavor really made it for me. Will definitely make again!

I followed the instructions and thought the soup had good basic flavor but lacked body. I had some extra butternut squash, so I roasted about 1 1/2 cups in the oven and pureed the roasted squash with the soup. I thought this addition produced a more flavorful soup and a heartier texture.

Rating: 4
Very hearty but healthy soup. Probably the most flavorful healthy soup I've ever made. I didn't have parsley on hand so added 1 tsp. herbs de provence. I also added a 1/2 tsp. ground ginger. I think my squash was a little small, so I only used 4 cups of broth. You can always add more if it's too thick.

Very good soup. Quick and easy to make, very healthy.

This soup was great! Unlike the othe reviewer, I did have the parsley. The breadcrumbs were a great topper for this great and good-for-you soup. I will definately make it again as it was one of the best non-cream soup that we have made.

good not great (though better the next day). I did omit the parsley as I'd run out. it's a fast easy soup if you have cutup squash on hand. but I think there's better recipes out there.
