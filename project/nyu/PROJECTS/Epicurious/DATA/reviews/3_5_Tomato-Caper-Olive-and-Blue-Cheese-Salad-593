We've been making this salad for years--a summer favorite. No anchovies, though. Finally remembered to save it to my recipe box so I can find it quickly!

While this was tasty, I think there are better tomato salad recipes.

I did not use basil or anchovies and this tasted great anyway. The briny taste of the olives and capers went well with tomato.

Loved this dish - the capers, the blue cheese, the balsamic, and the basil all combine to make an incredible taste. I used heirloom tomatoes at their peak. Excellent.

This was great! I did use anchovies, but don't think they are necessary. I served it over a bed of arugula.

What a great tasting summer salad. The flavors were wonderful. I left the anchovies out, but will try mixing anchovie paste with the oil next time.

A real winner! So simple! I also chose to leave out the basil and I didn't feel like the dish was lacking anything.

I've been making this recipe for years. Its one of my favorite ways to use garden-ripe tomatos.

All my favorite ingrediants here. I added bocconcini cheese to the tomatoes and next time I might try this on individual plates so the dressing doesn't sink to the bottom. Since this is not tossed, I'm not sure how much dressing made it to the plates. But it's a great mix of stuff.

Made this back on 2 July for family out east and they loved it! Picked it FOR the straight forward flavors of the ingredients. Served with the Sugar-Seared Salmon with Cream Sauce, the Rosemary Lemon Orzo Pilaf (both from this site) and Katie Brown's Herb & Onion Focaccia. A big hit! KIMBER

Great appetizer salad (or even main course with bread). This combination of flavors works wonderfully together. Used real gorgonzola - yum.

It would have been fine but I think the fresh basil just overpowered the taste. I would make it again without the fresh basil.

I used feta cheese, because we couldn't get the blue cheese. It was wonderful! Honestly, it'd probably have been even better with the blue cheese. Definately a keeper - simple yet sophisticated. Try it!

I was really looking forward to this, and there is certainly nothing wrong with it, but there are some very assertive flavors combining and competing here...turns out it's just not my cup my tea.

My favorite tomato salad. So easy to throw together and very pretty on the plate. I skip the anchovies because I don't care for them, but I do splurge and use the Maytag or other good blue cheese. This salad and some good bread can pass as dinner in our house.

I agree with everybody. This is a simple,lovely and delicious salad. I've alternated red and yellow tomatoes too. Just use the best ingredients. It goes so well with grilled meats.

This salad is incredible. I have made it both with and without the Kalamatas and it is great!!! Truly a taste sensation.

I've been making this since it was published a few years ago. There is no better way to DISPLAY and ENJOY a fresh summer's crop of huge ripe tomatoes. The success of this recipe depends on just that, so make sure tomatoes are at their peak. Great w/ grilled strip steaks & corn-cob.
