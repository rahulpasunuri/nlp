What did I do wrong? This to me was underwhelming. I added chopped apple and peanuts, otherwise I followed the recipe. This was not great in my opinion. It tasted heavily of curry, without sweetness or even creaminess to balance it out (a bit harsh). I like the concept of a curry slaw but this didn't do it for me. I hate it when everyone loves something and I just don't. Won't be making this again.

Amazing and can be made in advance. I used golden raisins instead if currants.

Five forks! This is fantastic. Have made this several times, added craisens instead of currants, walnuts,and tried with bacon as suggested in reviews. Anyway you twist it, this recipe is great. Took to a Bat Mitzvah potluck for vegans (sans bacon) and it was a hit!

Whoever suggested the peanuts is a genius! Props to you. Without the nuts, I found it tart and kind of dull, but I suspect it might have had something to do with the brand of mayo that I used. Next time I'll try it with a sweeter mayo, as I think there is a lot of interesting potential here.

This is the best cole slaw I have ever had!! Did add peanuts as I saw in a prior review. Used raisins, and next time I might try craisins and some bacon.

Delicious. A great improvement to traditional slaw. I have made this twice and it is the first thing everyone eats. The first time I made it with two serrano peppers rather than a jalapeno, and it was VERY spicy, but still good. The second time I used a jalapeno and the curry shined as the main flavor.

I love cabbage and have a hard time finding nice recipe but this one I fell in love with! I have to admit that I'm also a fan of curry, but this recipe is worth trying!

Fantastic! I was looking for a one-time change from basic coleslaw, and this was so good that it will be my new basic coleslaw from now on. Like many others, I used raisins instead of currants, and I added chopped peanuts. I served the peanuts in a dish on the side, thinking that there would be leftover coleslaw and if it had peanuts in it, they would get soggy. No need to have worried! One family member, who is an adventurous eater but hates anything with cabbage, had thirds. I used regular mayo, as I don't use "lite" fake food. The curry makes this special, I think. Also, I happened to get a very fresh and young in-season cabbage, so that probably had a lot to do with this recipe's success.

Yum. Go light on the lime juice. As posted it's a bit too tart.

This is an easy recipe that is a good twist on your typical boring cole slaw. I always get really great feedback when I make this. Note: check your jalepeno first...they run the gammut from mild to really hot. I have varied from adding two to only 1/2. Enjoy!

People at the bbq quite liked this, but I did not. To me it really just tasted like curry powder mixed with mayo...i.e. boring. Maybe I added to much lime juice and so it was too tart. I added chutney to the dressing to sweeten it up and it still didn't seem interesting enough. However, I would still tell others to give it a chance as obviously I'm in the minority...

Yummy. Used broc. slaw, raisons and topped with sunflower seeds for crunch.

Thsi recipe was fantastic! It was quick and easy to prepare. I also added 1/4 chopped nuts and it definately enhanced the taste. The dressing can be made in advance.

A great coleslaw! My husband loved it! I added peanuts like others suggested and they really added a nice crunch. I used dried cranberries instead of currants, and the tartness was a good contrast. My only regret is that I should have added more. I will definetly make this again.

Terrific. I skipped the onions, added a handfull of crushed peanuts, used whole mayonaise, and premium raisins instead of currants. The contrast of curry with sweet raisins was awesome. One of the best colwelaws ever, although my tradtionalist wife said it wasn't like Mom's. Served it on the side with a spicy chili. Mmmmmmmmmmm.

Really great. Much better than your average coleslaw. I substituted nonfat yogurt for 1/2 of the mayo (but then left out the lime juice), used purple cabbage, and dried cranberries instead of currants. I loved it, as did others. I will definitely keep this recipe around.

I like it, but it wasn't as tasty as I would have expected. Perhaps it was the curry I used. I used a Jamaican Curry by Grace foods that I purchased during one of my visits that is a bit more particulate in nature than a powder. It also contains some spices not found in the garden variety curry. It wasn't until after making it that I read the reviews. The peanuts are definitely the key to rounding out the dish and they add an inexpected punch and texture. It makes perfect sense. I'll definitely try it again when I have some peanuts on hand. Mine is still chilling, so I have yet to really taste the final meld of flavors. Hey, if you like this recipe there is one I have sampled, but have yet to find the recipe for. It is a traditional Indian Shredded Carrot salad with mustard seeds that is absolutely sensational. If anyone out there knows this salad and has the recipe, let me know.

Everybody loves this slaw whenever I make it. I have used less mayonnaise and used other minced dried fruits,and vidalia onions instead of scallions-- all with great success.

Made this recipe the first time tonight using previous suggestions and it was delicious. I decided to add some sugar at the end as I too prefer it a little sweeter. Also, to sweeten it I added bits of dried pineapple I had on hand. I used the whole tablespoon of curry and it was just right. Guess it depends on the type of curry you have as to how much to use. It went fabulously with the frozen fish fillets someone mentioned. Used Mrs. Pauls Flounder Fillets and put mine with the cole slaw in a warmed taco. yum!

This is a WONDERFULLY DIFFERENT coleslaw recipe!!! Made a few substitutions: used packaged coleslaw mix to replace only the green cabbage; used finely chopped red onion to replace the green; raisins instead of the currants; and mild Hatch, New Mexico green chili pepper (unseeded) instead of the jalapeno. It was plenty hot. I did use 2 reviewer's suggestions: cut the curry powder to 2 tsp. and added some crumpled bacon. My husband can't wait for me to make it again!!! Thank, reviewers for your input.

This is a great coleslaw, especially if you love curry like I do. I mixed red AND green cabbage for more color, and used golden raisins instead of currants. I also took other reviewers suggestions and added peanuts. Delicious! This was a big hit for my recent camping trip.

This was easy and good! I used a packaged shredded cabbage and a handful of raisins. I also took another reviewer's suggestion and tried it on crunchy fish fillets wrapped in a tortilla. I used warm roasted red pepper tortillas and it was a great and easy weeknight supper! I will keep this in mind for summer barbeques.

Thanks for the suggestion to add the crushed peanuts. Made big difference. Also use high quality curry powder, and a bit of sugar. Really tasty.

Easy and delicious. Wish I knew about peanut suggestion -- will definitely try it that way next time!

This is a GREAT change from my "normal" coleslaw. Everyone loved it and I will certainly make it again. Since I didn't have currants, I used raisons and also I tend to like my "normal" coleslaw on the sweet side. I added 2 T sugar to the sauce. Also took someone's suggestion and added chopped peanuts. Yummy!!! Thanks for sending me the email notice.

I suspected that this slaw would be awesome on fish tacos and hit the jackpot!! A perfect fit on flavor & spice even though curry isn't typical of such fare. I did not add the currants. I used what I had in the freezer - crunchy breaded real fish sqaures(not minced) baked in oven, cut in half. I added four halves to a mound of slaw on a large warm tortilla and rolled it up. No need for any other salsa or condiments. PERFECT, I tell you. served with ranch beans and a fresh fruit salad of mango,pineapple and apples. Blue Ribbon!

WOW! A terrific facelift to old coleslaw standby. I paired this with mesquite grilled chicken breasts. Yummy!

I completely agree with the other review- don't go overboard with the curry. The salad was delicious and added a nice twist to traditional cole-slaw. I found that adding a dash of red wine vinegar and a very small amount of sugar rounded out the taste.

Be careful with the curry. It may not taste spicy enough at first, but Indian curry usually has a delayed "build-up" reaction. (You don't realize how spicy it really is until you've had several bites.) I used authentic Indian yellow curry from an Asian food store, and the recipe was spicier than expected. This dish also goes well with fish like salmon or sole.

THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO A RECIPE I HAVE MADE FOR YEARS CALLED "BACON CURRY COLESLAW". ADD SOME PEANUTS AND CRUMBLED BACON AND IT'S FABULOUS!
