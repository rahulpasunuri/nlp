Followed the recipe closely. The dish bears only a passing resemblance to pasta primavera I've had before. It was disappointing. The mustard was an interesting ingredient, but the coarse-grained Dijon (I used Grey Poupon "Harvest Coarse Ground") gave the dish a grainy texture that I didn't like-- if I were to make this again I'd use a smooth mustard. I'd also leave the asparagus stems and the ham in larger pieces for texture and "forkability," and perhaps add cauliflower and garlic for a little more depth. The dish was easy and edible, but nothing special, and I can't recommend it.

Nothing special but good simple weeknight meal!

The mustard did nothing for this dish! Might be okay without it. There are other Pasta Primavera recipes to try.

As per previous reviewers suggestions, I sauteed some garlic, the peppers and then the ham. For the sauce I used part fat-free half and half and part heavy cream with cornstarch to thicken it up. Sprinkled parmesan on top of each serving. This would be good with a variety of veggies. Definitely recommend it!

I love this recipe, especially for how easy it is to make. I added some sweet onion, used a whole pepper and added some smoked gouda, and it is one of my favorite easy meals ever.

Great recipe. I forgot to add the mustard, and it still turned out yummy! I increased the recipe, using 1 lb of pasta, 2 1/2 lbs asparagus, 2 red bell peppers, 1 1/2 cups cream and chicken broth each, 1 lb black forest ham, and adding about 1/2 lb sugar snap peas and 1 med onion. I also thickened the sauce with some cornstarch. I will be making this again (this time with the mustard)!

Loved it! We had leftover pasta to use so I added double the veggies---broccoli, asparagus, peppers, onions. I steamed the first two but sauted the latter two with the ham and a bit of garlic. The mustard is key though!

Delicious, healthy and easy. We make this all the time, sometimes substituting smoked salmon for the ham. The Dijon mustard trick is really clever!

This is a great easy recipe to make for something quick. I sauteed the bell pepper with some sweet chopped onion and chopped garlic instead of boiling the bell peppers. I am also not a mustard person - but it makes the dish!

I just made this again last night and decided I have to review it. I love this recipe! Very simple and it just tastes fantastic. It's great the next day, even as a cold pasta salad sort of dish.

This was a great tasting, quick recipie that was healthy too. My family loved it. I will be making it again.

This is a delicious, quick and easy recipe. If you would like less fat use Fat Free half and half instead of whipping cream, it tastes great.

This was great very simple. I did substitute the smoked ham with prosciutto.

This is a staple in my household. I make this quite often without any changes. Sometimes I use prosciutto and grilled shrimp in place of the ham. I'm also a big fan of using roasted red bell peppers and grilled asparagus. Really adds a lot fo flavour.

This recipe was incredibly easy and delicious!! My changes were that I only used red, green and yellow peppers along with the onion and sauted them with the ham rather than boiling them. I added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder at the end and thicken the sauce with a little corn starch and water. My husband (the man of few words) actually said how much he enjoyed it!!! Now that's a good recipe.

Great recipe. My husband asked me to make it for him again 2 days after we had it for the first time. The second time around I added garlic and did thicken with cornstarch. Also added snow peas. Great recipe - simple and yummy.

The dish is really easy to make. I added cornstarch to thicken also and topped it with parmesan cheese for serving. Needed a lot of extra seasoning.

A nice fast meal - had ham left over from Easter so that worked well. It was very tasty - but didn't wow me. My husband thought it would have been just as good without the ham - Sauce could have been a little thicker, but I'll fix that next time.

Amazing comfort food; I was genuinely sad when my bowl was empty. I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe, especially the form of pasta: the sauce is very, very rich and farfalle hold just exactly enough of it on each piece to make each mouthful luxurious without being overwhelming. This dish will survive refrigeration better than you might expect given the high fat content (it will separate a bit upon rehearing), but it's _so much better_ the first day, right off the stove.

Very good..I served this for a Christmas luncheon and it was perfect. I did change a few things..I lightly sauteed (in small amount of unsalted butter) the red peppers and asparagus very quickly and set aside adding them to the sauce (to warm) at last minute. I reserved some of the veg. so they kept their full color and placed them on top of the pasta before serving..beautiful presentation for Christmas. I also added a little garlic to sauce and thickened with corn starch. Grated cheese before serving and a sprig of fresh Rosemary for more color..This one is a keeper!

Great recipe! My toddler even liked it. I used broccoli instead of asparagus but otherwise followed the recipe. This is a nice, relatively simple and quick meal.

This recipe was wonderful! We added some frozen broccoli and peas, the more vegetables the better. Be generous with the mustard -- even for someone who doesen't care for it, it added a nice touch. This one is a keeper!

Excellent! I'm not a huge fan of mustard but the subtle taste of it in this recipe made the recipe. I also used a good quality whole grain mustard which was much better (than the first time). Now I'm going to try ketchup! (just kidding!)

I took this to a church pot luck and took the prize for "best dish." I did thicken the sauce and added lots of chopped garlic. Lastly, I sprinkled it with fresh pamesean cheese. Easy and delicious.

Add garlic to the sauce! If you want thicker sauce, either reduce or add a cornstarch slurry. I found the sauce to be somewhat thin.

This was yummy! I added extra veggies in the form of broccoli and zucchini-the more the merrier! This recipe is also easy to double/triple.

I agree, it's a great, very simple way of using up left over ham. Next time I think I'll add a littel heat with some hot peppers. Also, I used yellow pepper instead of red, and zucchini instead of asparagus because I didn't have it on hand. Made a good lunch the next day.

I've made it once and I'm making it again tonight. It's good, simple and tastes great as a left-over, but it's nothing tantilizing.

I varied this recipe by replacing the mustard and half the chicken broth with a can of plum tomatoes and added some spice with some crushed red pepper flakes. It turned out a wonderful spicy tomato-cream sauce...and easy to make.

A good way to use up leftover ham. Even my kids liked it.
