Four stars if you use fresh baby artichokes. Four stars if you make it without artichokes. But don't try to replace those artichokes with frozen or canned - yucky. I think it works better with pork tenderloin, but this is a winner in our house, especially with guests. Great presentation with vegies like asparagus or green beans on each side of the roast.

This was easy to put together and looked pretty in the roasting pan, but it wasn't so outstanding that I'd make it again. I took the pork out at 130 degrees and it was just about to be overdone. The sauce saved it from being too dry.

I had a couple of pork chops that I didn't know what to do with, so I decided to try an improvised version of this. No lemons or artichokes, so I did some substitutions. For the mustard sauce, I used mustard, rosemary, dry vermouth, lime zest, and the juice from half a lime. I browned the pork chops on the stove in a cast iron pan; slathered the mustard sauce on top; and added shallots, garlic and very thinly sliced sweet potatoes, and threw it in a 350 oven for 30 minutes. Fabulous! Next time I'll try it as written.

I don't know what I did wrong but nobody took second helpings I used a 5 pound loin of pork which was dry (one mistake, should have brined) but pretty much followed the recipe otherwise. I added potatoes which were good but used frozen artichokes which weren't.

I don't really care for pork, but loved, loved, loved this one--the best pork loin / tenderloin recipe ever. I made it with tenderloin, which was my only departure from the recipe aside from using frozen quartered artichokes. It was incredible. There was too much coating for one tenderloin, but it would be perfect for two.

Lots of reviews talk about the labor involved with the artichokes so I took a short cut: Canned Artichoke hearts in water. The rest of the recipe I did as instructed. It was delicious and I will make it again for sure!

Phenomenal recipe. I had to work, so got all the ingredients and set up everything for my bf to make this. He's never followed a recipe in his life, and with a little guidance, managed to pull this one off so well I was in awe. Delicious, and even he said it wasn't that complicated. I think I might make more of the rub since it was so good, and marinate longer, because the leftovers were even better the next day when the flavors had gone through. I loved the artichokes, but really you can play with any mix of veggies that are good roasted.

This was amazing! Made it for Mother's Day, and my mom loved it! Used regular dijon mustard, and doubled the amount of garlic and rosemary. Terrific flavour from a short marinating time, and the jus took it to another level. Didn't feel like fussing with artichokes so substituted asparagus: they were a bit overcooked, so would add them with less time to go than the 45 minutes. Would definitely make again.

I try to make something different every night. I made this recipe and my family loved it. I am not a big artichoke fan so I did exchange the artichoke for asparugus. It was very moist and delicious.

Made this last night. It was still really delicious but I just can't give it 4 stars because it needs some help. First,the roasting time for the veggies and even the meat are not long enough - don't quite have enough roasting/browning on them. I ended up using 2 pork tenderloins vs one big loin to save on fat. I would also use carots too for flavor and color. Don't have to use grainy Dijon either - the paste of the garlic/salt/rosemary/lemon peel make it grainy enough. Also take the pork out at 155, not 145. I did and it was still a little pink which is exactly how my husband said it should be but I could have used it done a little more. Still very juicy though. Yes, this was a "healthy" meal but I would also consider throwing in some roughly sliced/chopped potatoes as well - needed something more hearty to be served with. Oh, and you really really need to pair the artichokes down because the outer leaves were not done enough on a few. The sauce is really yummy too but add more broth than the receipe calls for if you use a tenderloin. Hardly any juice came off it.

This was easy and yummy. I think 145 on the temp was a bit high, and I wish I had cooked it for a little less time. I cooked 1 pound of loin so all the times were off anyway. Served it with rice and it was a pretty easy week night meal.

OMG! This was excellent. The unpeeled garlic cloves carmelize beautifully and the combination of artichokes, shallots, and garlic is heavenly!
