Yum! Chopped fennel seeds finely. Used arugula (a.k.a. rocket). Guests raved.

I made this salad for a Memorial Day picnic and got raves. I used arugula instead of watercress per previous reviewer. The fennel seeds are not easy to crush - I finally used an old coffee grinder and it worked fine.

Use heirlooms if you can. I love making this salad with Lemon Gnocchi with Spinach and Peas: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Lemon-Gnocchi-with-Spinach-and-Peas-240959

Delicious salad, though the fennel is more manageable to eat if the pieces are cut off the core. The dressing is delicious--I used Sherry vinegar because I had it.

THIS IS A GREAT SALAD BUT I RECOMMEND USING ARUGALA INSTEAD OF WATERCRESS. SERVE THE PEPPER CORIANDER CRUSTED SALMON ON TOP WITH GARLIC BREAD AND IT IS A REAL WINNER.
