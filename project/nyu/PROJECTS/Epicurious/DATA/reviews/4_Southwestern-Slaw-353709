Made this for our fish tacos and it was great! A fresh and flavorful addition that complimented the fish instead of over powering it.

This is such a great recipe!! It tastes like the slaw they use at restaurants on fish tacos. It was perfect. It also stays good for leftovers the next day. It was a hit at my dinner party, don't be afraid to double the recipe, people will eat this. Its also good on meat and veggie tacos.

I have made this recipe exactly as written and it is great. I didn't think I like cabbage at all before trying this recipe. Right now I am on the South Beach diet and modified it so it is allowed... by replacing the honey with splenda. It is a fair replacement if you are on a diet and I served it along w/ the fish from the fish tacos and ate it over the slaw like a salad to cut the carbs. Very good!

For more nutrient dense veggies than green cabbage, I grated raw broccoli stems and raw zucchini and it was amazing on our fish tacos.

This recipe is delicious. Also: I used the leftover slaw and leftover pico de gayo (companion recipe) to make tortilla soup (added it to chicken stock, chicken, roasted bell peppers, fresh corn and a little extra jarred salsa for more kick). Served it with tortilla crisps, avocado slices, chopped cilantro, and grated cheese on the side for add-ins.

This was excellent and before I made it to accompany fish tacos, I was not a coleslaw or cabbage fan at all. I accidentally skipped the red onion, and it was great but next time will add it in if I have time.

I have made this recipe a number of times now and it turns out fantastic every time! I could eat a bowl of the slaw all by itself it is so light and refreshing. I did make a couple changes only because I was short on time and it turned out so good that Ive made it this way every time. I added some finely chopped chipotle peppers in adobo sauce to a garden fresh salsa I purchased instead of making the pico recipe. The amount of chipotle peppers and adobo you add will depend on your taste and how spicy you like it. Start with one pepper and a spoonful of sauce and taste before adding more. Instead of the Mexican Crema I used sour cream mixed with some of the adobo sauce to make a chipotle sour cream. It was fantastic! This recipe is a definite must!

this turned out incredible. I couldn't resist and added some mayo and crema to the mixture. I also added a pinch of cumin. Doubled the recipe and glad I did. It was delicious. Easy to make and can be ajusted to your liking. Served with fish tacos (my own version).

Love this fresh take on coleslaw. We have it on fish tacos and it is the perfect complement to that dish. By itself it's fine but paired with these tacos it absolutely makes the dish. I omit the jalapenos only because they are not my daughter's thing.

This was ok but it could be better. I added some fresh corn and had to increase all ingredients to handle the 2 cups slaw mix that I used. I usually make a lime vinaigrette that I think is better: 2T olive oil, pinch salt, 1T minced jalapeno, 1T minced fresh mint leaves, 1/4 cup limeaid concentrate. Just mix it together.

Made this for a man on a diet, it was a big hit. He finished it off in one evening, ALL BY HIMSELF!!! Will make this again and again. It's delicious.

This is so easy. Added 2 cups cabbage and 2 cups jicama and upped the rest of the ingredients slightly. Made our fish tacos perfect!
