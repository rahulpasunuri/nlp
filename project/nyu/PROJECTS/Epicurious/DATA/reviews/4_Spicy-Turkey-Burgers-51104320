I mixed the ingredients the night before to let the flavors really develop. Not sure if that would matter but these turned out delicious! I used a dill aioli for a sauce since I had fresh dill to spare.

If the skin and bones are discarded before grinding and cooking, can anyone figure out why the recipe says to buy them with the skin and bones on? To save money, or is there actually some effect in terms of quality if you buy them with the skin and bones?
