Great summertime dessert. The coffee, almond and chocolate flavors went together very well. My grocery store was out of blanched almonds so I used natural, sliced almonds. Loved that it was made in advance, too.

great recipe especially when you want a dessert which can be done ahead of time. to finish it off, sprinkle the chocolate on top first, and then the toasted almonds.

Extremely easy and always gets oohs and ahhs. It's possible to skip the blending of the ice cream with the chocolate, almonds, and Amaretto by using a Coffee Almond Crunch ice cream or the like. Last time, I used a Coffee Chocolate Almond from Starbucks. A snap.
