I skipped the salting step as suggested. Really, the salad was not very good. It was very salty, even without salting the cabbage. The dressing tasted overpoweringly like fish sauce and the lemongrass and other ingredients were impossible to detect. We got used to the flavor after a while and we were able to enjoy eating it a little, but I don't think I will be making it again anytime soon.

Both my husband and son who normally are not salad people enjoyed this salad a lot. As suggested I skipped the salting step. I also added a red pepper and some julienned carrots for a little color. I served it with Spicy Thai style pork ribs and some jasmine rice. All three complimented and balanced each other well.

This isn't the sort of dish I usually go for, but something about it called to me. And it was very good. I skipped the salting step with great results. I also added a tbsp. of soy sauce and a tbsp. of vegetable oil. Thanks to other reviewers for those suggestions. There ended up being a lot of extra dressing in the bottom of the bowl so next time I would cut back a little bit on all the liquid ingredients. But the flavor combo was just right. Served with pork chops. Husband loved it.

This was an excellent salad. For my vegetarian friends, I substituted a little soy sauce for the fish sauce, which worked nicely. And I agree with previous reviews, the dressing needed a little oil, so I added some sesame oil. The Napa Cabbage is a nice change from regular lettuces.

Great salad! I took the advice of another cook and skipped the salt water soak. I also added 1/2 tsp. of red pepper flakes, chopped cilantro, julienned red bell pepper, a tablespoon or so of canola oil to the dressing, and sprinkled the top of the salad with chopped dry roasted peanuts right before serving. (The lemongrass is tender if you peel away several of the outer layers). A definite make again salad; it will be great with summer barbecues.

I made this for my dad's birthday with salmon on top- it was delicious! The only problem was the lemongrass- it is so tought that it is downright inedible. It lended a nice flavor, but I would suggest removing it before serving.

Great lite dish. We put grilled chicken pieces or shrimp on top for a full meal. We also add alittle soy sauce to the fish sauce to make it less tart.

This recipe was really very, very good. Next time I may skip the salt/draining step for the cabbage and just use it fresh and crunchy which I think I will like better. (By salting it you actually wilt the salad.) The only thing I did a little differently was to add a couple of tablespoons of canola oil to the dressing....it was just a little too tart by itself (and I love tart, so this was really just a bit too, too tart with no oil at all!)..also, be sure to use the lemongrass and fish sause..these make the dish!
