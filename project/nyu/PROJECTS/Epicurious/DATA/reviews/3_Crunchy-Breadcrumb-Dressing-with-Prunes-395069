Stuffing pairs beautifully with Easter Ham recipe from same Bon Appetit April 2012 issue. Flavors meld and taste even better on day two. Served steamed asparagus with orange juice drizzle alongside.

Very good. I substituted rice bread to accommodate a food restriction and was pleased with the result. It got great reviews from my family. I'll definitely make this again.
