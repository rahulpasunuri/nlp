Very easy, rustic meal. Could perhaps be done in slow cooker? Meat takes a while but is low effort. Veggies and dressing come together in about an hour toward the end. I subbed olive oil for the sunflower oil, caper berries instead of capers, and used all short ribs as the butcher did not have beef shank. The sauce ravigote is the highlight here.
