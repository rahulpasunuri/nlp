this was a big hit at several dinner parties. yes, it is a humble dessert, but I haven't met anyone yet who does not love rice pudding. give it a try, and you will be pleasantly surprised.

not worth the effort

I'm only rating the pudding itself, not the strawberry/yogurt additions. That said, this is my favorite rice pudding which can be made with leftover cooked white rice. I think the Gonzo rice pudding on this site is better for a from-scratch pudding, but this one is reliable and a great use of leftovers. I personally add a teaspoon of Penzey's powdered lemon zest along with the cinnamon for the best flavor. Great warm or cold.

This is wonderful rice pudding recipe -- a great way to use strawberries now that they're in season. I had some coconut milk leftover from earlier in the week, so I substituted that for the cow's milk in the recipe. I'm sure it destroyed any semblance of healthfulness, but the taste was amazing.

This is nice comfort food, healthy and easy. Nice for a special family dessert, but not really a company dessert in my book
