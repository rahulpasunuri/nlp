It was easy to make with pre-peeled and cube butternut squash. I added some kale I had too before I blended, but maybe next time would add it after so the leaves wouldn't be chopped so tiny. I agree it could use a little more seasoning, so I added some Cajun blend spice which gave it a nice kick. After it settled a little after boiling, it was absolutely delicious. I only had two slices of bacon, but event with so many vegetables, it gave great flavor (and just the right amount of wrong, from a nutritional point of view).

This needed more flavor so I added a dollop of pesto. I think jerk seasoning would be good too. After adjusting, the soup was good and very filling.

I made this vegetarian by leaving out the bacon and switching chicken broth to veggie broth. I also used dried thyme. I dumped in apple cider vinegar early instead of measuring at the end (probably included 3 times as much as called for, woops!) but the soup turned out delicious! There's a bit of tang from my extra vinegar but overall the texture is amazing and I really like the balance of squash, carrots, and apples. It also gives a great lunch serving size with a salad (I recommend the arugula, pear, cranberry salad on this site).

I just wanted to say that the name of this recipe completely threw me off compared to the ingredients. I didn't envions "farmhouses" using things like caraway seeds, Turkish bay leaves or reduced sodium broth...or a water base for that matter. However, it does sound delicious...although I'm going to go look for something with a simpler palette.

Great addition to your fall soup line-up. Caraway seeds give this soup a refreshing new flavor! Enjoy!

Perhaps I'm not a fully informed reviewer because I completely forgot the vinegar, but this was a nice soup. I enjoyed the twist of the caraway and bacon, although next time I think I would use more squash and less carrots.

Rating: 4
Excellent! Easy, healthy and flavorful. The caraway and bacon are essential. To minimize the bacon fat, but maintain the flavor, I sauteed the vegetables in olive oil and added two slices of previously cooked, chopped bacon at the end. Delicious!

I have made this twice without the bacon and it is sooooo delicious! Great recipe.

I love butternut squash soup and have tried several recipes on epi, all of which I enjoyed far more than this recipe. I followed the recipe as is, with the exception of caraway seeds which I didn't have. My soup was so lacking in flavor. I'm not sure if it was the water, or inclusion of carrots and apple, or combination of all three, but I've spent the past couple days adding sauteed shallots, garlic, star anise, and cream in an effort to salvage it. Bummer, as it sounded healthy and had such good reviews.

I was looking in HuffPost and they had an article about 10 different ways to "detox" after the holidays. That was the jumping off point since epicurious is my "go to" site. Found this recipe, and I was intrigued...never having used butternut before, or making a squash soup. Other than a fair amount of chopping...this recipe is quite easy to prepare. I used my stick blender and got great results. And the soup is quite tasty...almost decadent. Perfect for a cool winter evening and some rosemary sourdough bread!

Very easy to make and a hit with eaters from age 8 to 47. My kids asked for the leftover soup. Great recipe to emphasize the flavor of fresh butternut squash.

I cannot make this soup enough. So easy, a good 12 generous servings for just $10.00 total. Stores very well in the refrigerator for long week of soup everyday, freezes perfectly. Each day the flavors become better. Filling but not stuffing or bloating, easy to spice to your own liking, healthy to boot. So little bacon used adds that little touch of savory crunch every few bites. Most of my time is just the chopping/peeling, but simmer for the 20 minutes then hand puree to make silky smooth. Fantastic texture and mouth feel.

Excellent soup. I too skipped the caraway seeds added a touch of cream and some cayenne pepper at the end to give it some bite. Also, I added a little more cider vinegar after first taste (about 1 tablespoon total).

I needed a Butternut Squash Soup recipe for a work potluck. I was intrigued by the addition of bacon. It is FABULOUS. I roasted the squash, carrots, and a bulb of garlic and used all broth and added some cider as well as nutmeg. I used the bacon drippings from quite a bit more bacon than it called for...basically all the leftovers from breakfast. Creamy, sweet and savory, a nice roasted flavor from the veggies that pairs wonderfully with the smokey bacon flavor. I will make this again!

This is an easy, healthy soup - that keeps well- freezes well and is delicious. Especially easy with the packaged precut butternut squash so easy to find in the markets. The cider vinegar adds a nice zip to it. A creamy,thick soup without the added fat of cream. This is my go- to cold weather soup. Yum.

I liked this quite a bit, but when I make it again, I'll definitely use less carrot. I wasn't tasting the squash as much as I would have liked as the carrots were overpowering the more subtle flavor of the unroasted squash.

Made a double batch of this wonderful soup tonight, with only slight modifications. I pre-roasted the squash in the morning and cooled it, so I could just scoop the flesh out into the pot. I did not use the full amount of bacon-fat from cooking the bacon but poured out half. I think the bacon fat is important to the flavor of the soup. I had made homemade chicken stock from a roast chicken carcass in the slow cooker overnight, so I had some awesome, rich broth for this recipe. My family loved it! The combination of the salty bacon, sweet apple, and caraway is a lovely mix!

I, too, omitted the bacon and caraway seeds and used no water. Talk about easy and very delicious and healthy! A new staple for this fall.

Don't omit the apple cider vinegar at the end! I tested it without, and it lacked a little punch. I added the vinegar, a 1/4 cup cream and a pinch of cayenne pepper and it was just what it needed. I didn't use the caraway, and substituted fennel seeds which I like better.

I enjoyed this recipe, but I made some changes. I didn't add caraway seeds or water. Initially, I made the soup with chicken broth, but found it needed something to enhance the flavor, so I added apple cider and cream. I used an immersion blender and it turned out well. Next time I make this I will use less chicken broth to balance out the other liquids I added. I will make this soup again!

I thought this soup was great. I halved everything, ditched the caraway seeds, and threw in half of a red onion with the garlic. I roasted my squash a bit before scooping it out into the soup. I blended it all, and threw in a few dashes of tabasco sauce for good measure. It was delicious with the bacon on top, and would be good with croutons as well.

I skipped the bacon as I was cooking for non-pork eaters, so sauteed the garlic/caraway seeds in olive instead. Soup recieved rave reviews, but I bet it would have been even better with the bacon! :-)

This soup was amazing. The only change I made was the caraway seeds because I forgot to purchase them. I made it for the annual Halloween bash instead of the usual turkey chili. Everyone loved it and no one missed the meat. I am making this for a football party and looking foward to the rave reviews. Thanks epicurious

This recipe provides a good foundation. I altered it by eliminating the caraway seeds and adding two sprigs of sage. Additionally, I pureed all of the vegetables. Also, I followed the advice of other reviewers, by adding a "kick" to the flavor with a couple of dashes of hot sauce. Lastly, I put in a pinch of cinnamon and of ground ginger, plus a tablespoon of brown sugar. Definitely improved the taste!

this tasted good, but the bacon taste was just too strong. i followed all of the suggestions to skip the caraway seeds, but they might have balanced the bacon.

I followed many reviewers' suggestions and eliminated the caraway. I also added half an onion to the garlic as a reviewer had suggested. When all was said and done, it lacked zing, so I added a little dash of cayenne pepper and that gave it just the right amount of heat, just in the aftertaste. I only gave it 3 forks because I had to make that adjustment to suit my taste. It was really yummy.

Delicious and fairly healthy even with the bacon. A great soup for those autumn evenings. We left out the caraway seeds, roasted the squash, and added some nutmeg, etc. per the other reviewers' suggestions. You can use a variety of winter squash if you like.

Excellent soup - minus the carroway - we are not fans. For one reviewer who doesn't like cutting the squash, I find preparation is made much easier by roasting the squash. Only one big cut necessary to halve it, then scoop out the squash when it's soft and so tasty. Love it!

This recipe was so delicious and perfect for fall. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added 1/4 tsp. cinnamon and nutmeg. I also added half of a chopped onion to the garlic after it browned and used a roasted butternut squash that I had on hand. I think the next time I will cook the soup a bit longer as the carrots weren't quite soft enough even after 25 minutes.

This is our favorite Butternut Squash Soup. Young and old like this in our house. We often top ours with extra bacon and parmesan cheese. There was one time when this soup did not turn it. The pale butternut squash should have tipped me off. The recipe is solid, be sure the ingredients are too.

It was great! I used only what I had already in the apartment, so bacon, caraway, bay leaf and thyme were ommited, and instead added cinnamon, rosemary and sage. So healthy and so easy, I can't wait to make it again!

Not bad for a butter and creamless soup (more or less fairly healthy without the bacon)! I didn't have caraway seeds, and also used pancetta as didn't have bacon on hand but thought it turned out quite good. Nice and comforting and a good way to use that big squash I had lingering around.

I omitted the bacon; sauteed all veggies + apple in coconut oil. I also added cinnamon, clove, ginger, nutmeg and a nice dash of smoky allepo pepper flakes...delicious! I didn't have cider vinegar on hand, so I omitted all together, and pureed the entire batch as another reviewer recommended.

This turned out quite nice. I fried up some pancetta, used less water, threw in some ginger and used anise seeds instead of caraway. I decided to puree the entire thing. I'd definitely make it again. I'd probably stir in a few tablespoons of butter at the end next time too.

Very, very good - also quick and forgiving. Other than the time it takes to chop the squash, it was an easy and hearty dinner. I didn't have carrots and I don't eat bacon, so neither made it into the recipe and it was still great. The texture was perfect and I used a red delicious and eliminated the cider vinegar. And as an added bonus, my one and three year olds liked it too!

Rating: 3
Like other reviewers said, I also added a bit to the recipe: cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, half an onion, and a shallot. I also roasted the squash beforehand and it did give the soup a much sweeter taste that was well balanced with the bite of ginger and pepper and acidty of the apples/vinegar. However, I did find the taste of the cider vinegar a little overwhelming. If I make the soup again, I would probably half the vinegar measurement or not add it at all and balance the sweetness with adding a bit of cream when serving. As a final note, this soup takes a while to make I thought. Much longer than the 45 minutes. But overall, great recipe that is perfect for the cold weather.

Rating: 3
Good, but I ended up doctoring up quite a bit. I added ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg and my secret ingredient--two tablespoons of apple butter. I think apple sauce or apple cider would also work. It gives it a bit more body, flavor and complexity without making it too pumpkin-pie-ish.

Big disappointment. All those great flavors, apple, thyme, garlic, carrot, and all I could taste was caraway! And I didn't even like that flavor mixed with the squash. It is really hard to find something I don't enjoy, but this made the list.

Excellent, delicious, and easy. Be sure that squash is completely cooked before pureeing. If possible, use a stick blender and puree directly in the pot. It's safer.

This is the BEST Butternut Squash soup I ever had. And so did others :] Love the earthy caraway (one of my favorite spices) mixed with thyme (I used fresh thyme from my garden), it accompanies the bacon perfectly. I used veggie broth instead of chicken and it turned out great. Very rich, can stand as a meal with a salad and good bread. Keeper. Four Forks!

Haven't made this yet but it looks delicious. I think I will add a shallot to the garlic... anyway in response to the last question from Minnesota my guess would be 2 pounds of butternut squash before cutting and seeding. I would probably air on the side of slightly more and use my judgment when making the soup. Has anyone added a splash of cream at the end?

This is a nice recipe. If you have the time, roasting the squash (cut in half, place cut-side down in large baking dishes, cook at 400-425 for..um.. until they pierce easily with a knife.. at least 25 minutes, maybe?) gives it much deeper sweeter flavor. Too sweet? Counter it with the toppings: Serve with a small dollop of low-fat sour cream, a sprinkle of hot pepper flakes and the bacon (heck, even real bacon bits) and you've got a lovely and tasty dish, starter or main.
