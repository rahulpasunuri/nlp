A good and easy sauce that was a nice addition to the Platter of Roasted Shellfish. Will use again for other shellfish and pasta dishes. Christmas 2008

Have made this several times with ourstanding results. Wonderful with roasted fish / seafood. Having tonight w/grilled lamb. Flavors meld together quite nicely.

We made this to go with the platter of shellfish. After making per directions, I reduced the liquid because it seemed way too juicey - maybe the tomatoes bursting caused it. Also added extra toasted cumin seeds - we liked the end result. It is a colorful dish which added to entire main course presentaion.

Despite the poor reviews I decided to make this since I had all of the ingredients on hand and I am glad I did. I served it with the roasted shellfish for a birthday dinner and it was great.

I made this recipe for a summer BBQ. The guests loved it. The cumin added a nice balance to the other foods we were serving.

I disagree w/ previous review. I made this as a sauce for roasted shellfish and everyone liked it. Follow directions exactly except couldn't find yellow grape tomatoes.

Made this for a big buffet and all agreed it was nothing special.
