This was easy, creamy, and delicious. I used Arborio rice and like others, tempered the eggs with a bit of the hot pudding then put the mixture back into the pudding for another 5 minutes or so. Grated a little fresh nutmeg on top and YUM!

Creamy & flavorful, this is my absolute favorite Rice pudding recipe. I have used this recipe for 16 years. Everytime I make it, it disappears!

VERY good! I have been looking for a great rice pudding recipe for a while and this is IT! Creamy rice pudding, reminds me of my junk food favorite (Kozy Shack) except, even better.

Delicious and easy. Only issue I ran into was that my custard broke...twice...so I gave up and skipped the final step of adding the eggs. Still tastes really, really good! Oh and I soaked the raisins in Marsala.

I made this recipe using Arborio rice and wow was it good. Definitely worth the effort of stirring for an hour!

delicious pudding! i didn't cook down the liquid in the rice enough before adding the eggs, so my custard didn't set as well as i would have liked. a good stirring before serving helped and next time i'll just add a few more minutes of cooking time before adding the eggs.

I have been on the path to find a good Kosy Shack copy. Tried this recipe. It has a good taste but my pudding did not set firm and came out completely watery even after leaving it in the fridge over night. I am not sure where I when wrong. I left out the raisins and cinnamon and used full creme milk.My kids still ate (drank) it though. Anyone have a suggestion??

I made this with cooked brown rice and rum soaked raisins. It turned out perfect and didn't take as long. I love this rice pudding.

I made this for my daughter's Peru oral report but omitted the raisins since she is not a fan of them. It was delicious and I look forward to making it the next time with the raisins. I tempered the eggs by adding 4 tablespoons of the simmered milk to the beaten eggs before adding it to the milk. I also added 2 cloves (remove them the same time as the cinnamon sticks) and the zest of 1/2 orange -- it was wonderful.

Every once in a while a recipe comes along that divides your life into a clear "before" and "after." And rice pudding has always been my culinary Moby Dick. For some reason, I've never been able to make it successfully. It usually turns out too runny, or burned, or chalky, or tooth-curlingly sweet. Until now! This is by far the best rice pudding I've ever had. And did I mention I MADE it? Not too sweet, perfect consistency. And I used 1% milk (so there!).

Excellent! Both my husband and 1 year old son loved it. I substituted some ground cinnamon for the cinnamon stick, as I didn't have one on hand. I will definitely make again.

This is terrific! This is just as how I remember my mother's rice pudding to be. Now that she is gone, I don't have her recipe, but this is as good as I remember it beeing when she would make it. My dad tried some, and he agreed that it is delicious. I didn't add the salt, and I didn't have a cinnamon stick, so I used a pinch of cinnamon powder instead, and it turned out just as good. I will most certainly will be making this again. It's so good, I emailed my friend the recipe.

Made it just like the recipe. Used Arborio rice and a mixture of 1 cup half-and-half with 3 cups 2% milk. It took about 40 minutes, start to finish. Hint: Start the yolk/milk mixture about half an hour into the process and you'll finish both parts nicely together. Very delicious!

Tastes wonderful. Once the rice is tender and the puddings' consistency is right, it is done. It does not always take one full hour.

My Customers have been asking for rice pudding, and i was looking for an economical tasty recipe as my Indian version that i make at home, though beyond compare is too costly for restuarants. I had never added eggs to rice pudding before so I was a little sceptical. Since I'm always multitasking,I started the custard before the pudding was completely done and ended up curdling it. Didn't want to wash out the saucepan right away so I followed what one reviewer suggested and just tempered the egg yolks in a bowl with hot rice pudding and added to pot. Worked Great! Am enjoying a nice bowlful with nutmeg right now. Easy and really good. I used Arboria Rice as well doubled the recipe but added just two yolks total.

I love this recipe, and last night I had a strong hankering, but no whole milk in the fridge, and no motivation to go the store. So I did the forbidden, and used 1% milk and... it was delicious and creamy. Probably not as good as the original, and I don't think I would be so brave as to use skim ever, but it can be done with 1% and is still fantastic.

I cut this recipe in half, made it with long-grain brown rice and used 1/2 tsp cinnamon (didn't have sticks). I knew that brown rice would take longer to cook, but I had no idea how much longer. I cooked it for about 1 1/2 hours, adding a little milk to thin it out at about 1 hour, before giving up and finishing it even though the rice was not completely cooked. The flavor was excellent, even though the rice was crunchy! Very rich. I will try again with white rice or partially cooked brown rice.

Very creamy and yummy. I have made it in the microwave on 70% power, stirring frequently and it cooks in about 35 minutes. NO risk of the milk burning in the microwave.

This is a creamy diner style rice pudding. It thus has a different texture than the custard kind that is baked, which another reviewer liked better. This is easy and delicious, and a classic version of this style of rice pudding. Great comfort food! Btw, I used Splenda and ground cinnamon.

This is an excellent rice pudding recipe. I don't think there is too big of a difference whether you add the eggs at the end or not. Either way it end up quite creamy and delicious.

Thick and rich. The golden raisins add a great touch of sweetness. The pudding itself is not terribly sweet without them.

Great, classic rice pudding. I have been making this for several years and it is a tried and true favorite with or without raisins. Follow the recipe cooking method as written, but I like my rice pudding creamier so increase the first milk amount to 5 Cups and the second milk to 1.5 Cups. I also reduced the sugar to 1/6 cup.

Since this recipe is nearly identical to my mother's rice pudding, I thought it would be great (as hers always was). The big difference is is the eggs; she mixed whole eggs into the rice and then baked it. I tried this (thinking it would be the same but quicker), and really don't like it. The texture is more sticky, and less custard like than I enjoy, and I didn't think the flavor was as good (maybe the cinnamon-I don't normally use that). I'll go back to the tried and true, even if it takes longer.

Rice pudding is one of my very favorite desserts and I've made this one since it came out in the magazine in '95. Of all the rice pudding recipes I've tried this is by far the best, rich, creamy, and comes out the same every time. You can even double or triple it and it still works great!

I've been looking and looking for a good rice pudding recipe that tastes like the stuff my dad made when I was small. This is it! This is the first rice pudding recipe I've found in forever that both works for me and tastes yummy! It's easy, and really tasty. I didn't use raisins and it was a tiny bit bland, so next time I'll add another cinnamon stick and more sugar. I also forgot the vanilla... so that might have done it! :) It's definitely a keeper though!

i MADE THIS RICE PUDDING FOR THE FIRST TIME AND IT WAS DELICIOUS. I'M NOT A COOK BY FAR, YET THIS WAS SO EASY TO PREPARE AND IT PAID OFF IN THE END. I CAN'T WAIT TO MAKE IT FOR MY FRIEND WHO IS A GOURMET COOK!

This is the best rice pudding recipe I have ever tasted. I have many aunts who have always made rice pudding (for family gatherings) that were from very good old-fashioned recipes. It is very creamy, smooth, and with just the right amount of sweetness. Although I am sure there are more elaborate recipes available, this is THE BEST my family and I have ever had and we cook gourmet meals and dine at many well-established restaurants (three and four star/diamond). After making this recipe for the first time three years ago, I have never used another--this is IT! A 45 yo Italian Mamma

I have made many rice puddings over the years, but this was perhaps the best. For more than 30 years my husband has measured them to one he used to eat at George & Harry's, a pub near the Yale campus. Finally, this one measured up and even exceeded his memories! I used arborio rice and it was very creamy and rich. A real keeper!

I followed the recipe very closely but the pudding was thin and watery. It looked and tasted like rice pudding before I put in the refrigerator, but when I took it out the next day, it had separated. Perhaps I should have reduced the amount of milk. I will try another recipe.

This pudding is WONDERFUL--rich and creamy, and infused with cinnamon. MMMMM! I tempered the egg yolks as suggested by A Cook from Tallmadge, Ohio. Her method eliminates the fuss, and gives excellent results.

My husband just loved this one. Reminded him of the rice pudding his Grandmother used to make. Just that comment alone makes this one a keeper. The only change I would make is to add 4 and 3/4 cups of milk all at once with the rice etc. When it comes time to add the egg yolks, just take a ladle full of hot rice mixture and add it slowly to the bowl of beaten egg yolks. It works much better and elements the possibility of boiling the egg mixture before adding to main ingredients.
