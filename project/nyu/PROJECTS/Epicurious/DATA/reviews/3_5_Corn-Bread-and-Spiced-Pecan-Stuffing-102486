I've made this almost every year since '99 and it's delightful.

This is a Thanksgiving/Christmas staple in our house but without the eggs. I use homemade stock to bind everything. I also omit the green peppers, just because I'm not fond of them. My biggest problem with the recipe, however, is the pecans. They need to be made in advance, which means they are sitting there! In my kitchen! CRYING OUT to be nibbled upon until suddenly the dressing has far fewer nuts than originally planned...

As with just about every other stuffing/dressing recipe that calls for eggs, I simply don't use them. They are supposed to bind the ingredients, which they do, but in my mind they make the recipes cloyingly (is that a word?) rich, and besides, we Americans eat too, too, too much of the wrong kinds of fat. End of lecture! This stuffing is glorious. Made all the better with fresh pecans.

I substituted Jiffy cornbread mix for the buttermilk cornbread...it turned out wonderful. Please allow yourself plenty of time to prepare this recipe.

Made the recipe exactly as written. Liked the corn bread by itself, the nuts by themselves, even the sauteed vegetables by themselves....but after combining them and baking with the eggs & broth, I didn't like the stuffing. I didn't put it in the turkey - baked in a pan. Maybe I made it too dry for my taste.

I used this stuffing with the Cider Basted turkey and Roasted Apple Gravy. It contrasted beautifully with the yams and the gravy. I made it a little drier, because I prefer it that way. Very delicious! Definitely would make it again!

This was my first year cooking Thanksgiving dinner, and I got all of my recipes from this site. This stuffing was excellent, I was a little wavering at first about the spiced pecans, but it turned out great in the end. Served with Brown Sugar crusted whipped sweet potatoes!!

Fantastic, and easy to make. You can substitute 2 Jiffy Corn Bread mixes for the cornbreas recipe.
