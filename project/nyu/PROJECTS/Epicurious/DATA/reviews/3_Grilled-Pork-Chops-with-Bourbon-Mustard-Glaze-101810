I've made these regularly and love them. It's super quick, and it's not at all spicy (I don't think it's meant to be made with fiery hot chili sauce...use the stuff that's like a chunky ketchup/cocktail sauce). It's not a fancy dish, but it feeds the family on a week night in a very pleasant way.

Definitely add honey. I doubled everything but the chili sauce, and still it was spicy. I pan sauteed the pork, added the sauce, and brought it to a boil. A VERY easy recipe.

After looking at the ingredients of this recipe, I thought it sounded good and easy to make. The mixed reviews made me somewhat hesitant to try this, but at the same time I felt challenged! Anyway, I followed the advice of others and added about 2-3 tbsp of honey and I really do believe that makes the difference. With such strong ingredients, you definitely need something to sweeten it. I also added about 3 cloves of garlic, which helped also. I do agree that the chili sauce does mask the dijon and other flavors - the sauce actually kind of tasted like the Spicy Chutney BBQ sauce that is also on this website, which I happen to love and make all the time. Anyway, my husband and I thought this was great and we definitely will do this one again!

I've been making a slight variation of this recipe for almost four years now, and the dozens of folks I've served this to have all liked it, even though a few are spicy-food-averse. I use Sriracha, an asian chili sauce, and marinate the chops first; I then boil the marinade and serve it as a sauce on the side. While I can understand how some folks might find this salty, I don't understand how some reviewers could equate this to tasting like ketchup -- your ingredients must have been exceedingly bland and/or out of proportion to come out with that result!

Quick easy recipe. I pan fried the chops then deglazed with bourbon. I added honey, crushed red pepper and cayenne to the sauce then added it the pan and reduced. Very quick and easy- I had all the ingredients on hand.

Unfortunately, I thought I had reduced sodium soy sauce, but it wasn't. Despite that it was so incredibly salty before the sauce was even reduced that I can only imagine how bad it would have been even with the right soy sauce. I couldn't find any underlying flavor to make this worthwhile. I'm glad I didn't ruin the beautiful thick cut chops I chose, because grilling a thin cut piece of meat is basically a waste of a good fire. I usually don't have problems with Gourmet recipes, but I'm finding the Bon Appetit recipes to be very hit and miss.

might as well just put a bottle of ketchup on the chops- would suggest leaving out the chili sauce and go for just the bourbon, mustard and soy sauce

I added a tsp of spicy chili garlic sauce and 3 Tbsp. honey...it was awesome! I didn't bother boiling the sauce, just mixed together and marinated the pork in it, then basted while grilling. SUPER SIMPLE recipe with delicious results.

Very easy, fast, and delicious. My whole family loved it. Don't let the strength of the sauce scare you away. The flavor changes once it's grilled.

To San Jose, I believe that they're referring to Chili Sauce that is more like a tomato based relish (Kraft makes one - usually found beside the Ketchup - another brand, more homemade-style, is Willies). This product is quite sweet, not spicy at all, and has a texture much like bottled salsa - in fact, if you could find a salsa without any cilantro it would make a decent substitute.

I can't choose less than 1 fork and there is no "god no never" option. My definition of "chili sauce" must be vastly different than everyone else here. All I tasted was chili sauce, no b0urbon, no mustard, no nothing. It set my mouth on fire and I like extreamly spicy food. I didn't even let my husband and kids near this. I tossed it out and am starting over, not using this recipe. For the record, in our house, (and in most others I know) "bottled chili sauce" is a relative to Tabasco sauce. I buy mine in a mexican store down the road.

I thought this was easy and tasty...the bourbon taste was strong when I tried the sauce on its own (scarily strong!), but on the finished product I thought it was great. Super fast!

We really enjoyed this -- very tender and juicy. I first marinated the pork with fresh garlic paste for about eight hours. (Three garlic cloves, 1/8 tsp kosher salt, 1/4 tsp. olive oil). To the glaze I added chili powder and cayenne for punch. Added a bit more bourbon(1/3 C)and reduced the soy to cut down on the salt. Really great the next day cold too.

Didn't think this was all that great. I marinated the chops, like suggested. Although they were very tender, they were also VERY salty. I also agree that there are better BBQ sauces out there. I, too, served it with cole slaw and corn muffins, which seemed to go well together.

Nothing anything too exciting. Expected more of this dish.

This glaze is an excellent base to make an even better glaze. I added 2 tblspns of honey and 1/2 a dried cayenne pepper. That added a little heat and allowed the chop to carmelize on the grill. Give it a try!

For the life of me, I can't understand all the great reviews for this dish... it basically tasted like pork chops glazed with ketchup. Yuk.

WOW!!These were great! Thank you everyone for all of your tips. I too used it as a marinade, I then boiled the left over marinade for the glaze after the chops were grilled. Instead of using plain Djion Mustard I used the HOT Djion, it gave it a nice kick. YUM!!!!!!

This recipe was quick and easy. My husband loved it. I thought it was good too but was looking for something a little less BBQ tasting. I served with cole slaw and green beans as suggested and they all complimented each other.

This was simple and great. Followed the side dish suggestions (corn muffins, coleslaw & grean beans) and it all went together very well. Actually used Jack Daniels, which I think may have added more of a smokie flavor. Different and quite flavorful.

I followed this recipe as written and found it rather ho-hum - my husband agreed. The chops were tender but we've had much better chops. Maybe something to liven it up? Probably won't try it again

While I would make this again, it is not because it was exceptional. Followed the recipe as shown and my friends and enjoyed it. Next time will try adding something to give it more "zest"! KIMBER

To the Cook from Aubon, CA on 3/16/01. You are very much mistaken about using marinades for sauce. Marinades can make delicious sauces and many recipes suggest using them as such. They do caution you to first boil the marinade for a good 5 minutes to kill the bateria. A marinade can then be used safely as a sauce.

To the cook from Auborn California: NEVER use a matinate as a sauce. It is full of harmfull bacteria and it can kill you!!!

was too cold to grill, so i cooked the chops in an iron skillet, deglazed w/ the bourbon, mixed in the rest and served the sauce on the side. very good, very quick.

Per suggestions, I added honey & made this as a marinate for 3" round, 1" thick pork medallions. After grilling pork, I added the pan juices to the marinate w/ a T. of cream & served as a sauce. I generally do not care for pork chops, but these are a definate do again. Would also be good on chicken. P.S. I used straight Kentucky Bourbon.

I also subsituted BBQ sauce for the chili sauce, as well as Canadian Club for the bourbon. I used the sauce on boneless ribs and broiled them (since it was 30 degrees outside!). They were great! They were moist and had a great flavor. Will use this again in the summer on the grill.

Not only did my husband and I like these pork chops, my children did as well. Whenever I can please everyone, the recipe is a keeper. The only substitution I made was to use the ingredients as a marinade instead of a glaze, and I then broiled the chops instead of grilling since today was a rainy day.

This was an extremely easy dish to make and yielded very good tasting pork chops. I made roquefort scalloped potatoes with the chops and it all went together very well. Will definitely make this meal again.

I made this recipe for a group of about 60 men (Elk's) and I got great reviews. The sauce is great. I did add a little hot sauce to it and I used BBQ sauce as others mention to do. I dipped the pork chop completely in the sauce and the put it on the grill. I topped it with a little more sauce before serving. Hurray!

Rating: 3
Since I didn't have any chili sauce, I instead used a spicy BBQ sauce. Also, I had no bourbon on hand, so I used some Canadian Club rye whisky - and it turned out great! This sauce was excellent on 1-1/2 inch thick butterflied pork tenderloin, slow-cooked on the BBQ. Locked in all the juices and was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.

This was a very good way to have moist, delicious chops. We had Stir-fry Broccoli and Carrots with this.

I'm not a big fan of pork chops, but the sauce was delicious and I would try it with ribs next time. I used BBQ sauce as I didn't have chili sauce, and I liked that flavor. Also added a bit extra bourbon...

Did I miss something. Cook from New York, where does the recipe mention apples?

Rating: 3
I thought this was excellent. I especiallye like the bits of apple, it added a little tartness. I never tasted pork chops so flavorful. I usually never dip my meat in barbecue sauce - I couldn't get enough of this wonderful sauce. I bet it would be great on spare ribs. Enjoy!

Simple and delicious! I made the sauce in the morning and marinated the chops in it. My husband grilled them that night and they were yummy. The only changes I made to the recipe is I added garlic and some crushed red pepper. I think this would be a tasty sauce on bbq ribs.

This recipe is excellent and easy. Goes well over garlic mashed potatoes and spinach. Also nice with a mustard cream sauce drizzeled on top. My whole family enjoyed it, including my 5 year old with selective eating habits. Highly recommen, especially for families. Take it from a busy mom!

I like pork and am always looking for intersting ways to prepare it. Many recipes for pork use sugar. I especially liked this recipe because there was no added sugar -- good for low carb eaters. It was easy and good. I cooked on the stove on a pan with ridges. It worked very well. :)

My boyfriend went crazy over this recipe! We have since tried the sauce on grilled chicken, and it was equally tasty. I did alter the recipe slightly by adding 2 T dark molasses, 1 T honey, some garlic powder and some onion salt. It made a wonderful sauce for grilling, because it sealed in the juices and prevented over-drying.
