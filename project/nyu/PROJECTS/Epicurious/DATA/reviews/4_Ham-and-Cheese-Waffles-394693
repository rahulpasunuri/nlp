Honestly, these were nothing to write home about. They were...fine. I wouldn't go out of my way to make them again.

Decadent, but delicious. 1/2 recipe makes a good amount for 4 people. We'll be enjoying these again on Christmas morning!

I think this recipe needs a correction. If each waffle gets 1 Tablespoon of ham and and 1 of cheese, then the recipe should have 12 Tablespoons of each, divided.

Great waffles -- sweet and savory! Adding the cheese to the batter helps prevent sticking. Cook extra long to get them crispy.

These are the best waffles my husband and I have ever eaten, seriously amazing! We made them for a Breakfast-for-Dinner. For our last waffle, we made it with chocolate chips instead of the ham and cheddar - works well sweet as well!

Made these with 5 year old aged white cheddar and maple cured ham.YUM! You might considered adding cheese and ham to batter rather than on top of each waffle, makes waffle making much easier.

Used gruyere instead of cheddar, very good.
