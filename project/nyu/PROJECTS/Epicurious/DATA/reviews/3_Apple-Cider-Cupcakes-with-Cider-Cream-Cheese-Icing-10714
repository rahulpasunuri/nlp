There is something off about this recipe. I followed it virtually exactly (except I did substitute brown butter for the shortening). I made sure to measure the reduced cider to verify that it was the proper amount. The cupcakes turned overly moist and sunken in the middle. They are done, but they are very sticky and difficult to remove from the paper wrapper. They actually taste pretty good, but I was looking for a nice cupcake presentation, and I am disappointed. I'm not sure what I'm going to do to "fix" it at this point. I have the frosting ingredients, but they would need lots of it to cover up the sunken middle. I'm thinking about sauteeing some apples, using the rest of the reduced cider in that, and serving the upside-down cupcakes on the warm apples with a scoop of ice cream (as a kind of mini-cake instead of a cupcake with frosting) Sigh. I made these for my mother-in-laws's birthday. That's what I get for trying a new cupcake recipe. There are lots of other good cupcake recipes on this site. I would try this one at your own risk knowing that you might have to improvise!

I was looking for a cupcake recipe that would go with a yummy browned butter frosting that I wanted to make. I made these, but instead of the shortening I substituted it with an equal amount of browned butter. While you can't taste the butter specifically in the finished product, it really brought out the wonderful flavor of the apples!

I don't know what happened in the experiences below, but I found these fabulous as well. I intend to make them for Thanksgiving. They are wonderful. I would imagine they didn't cook down the apple cider enough.

I was looking for a way to use up cider. I used butter rather than vegetable shortening and poured the batter into a 9x13 pan (350, 35 minutes) and got an OK snack cake that I did not bother to frost. The apple flavor was not that strong and neither was the spice component. I would prefer gingerbread, but I would make this again if I had apple cider to use up. I would not go out of my way to get purchase the ingredients to make this.

Recipe fails utterly. Cupcakes were a sticky mess and almost hollow inside.

I love these cupcakes! I've made them a few times and I've never had a problem with them being dry. The frosting? Fabulous. If you reduce the cider as written it won't be runny. I use Knudson's Cider and Spice which gives it an extra kick.

Never use vegetable shortening. EVER. That's what olive oil is for.

These just weren't exciting. I bought apple cider especially to make them, but they barely tasted of it. They were also a little dry. There are too many other apple flavored cake recipes to make this one worth tweaking.

I followed this recipe exactly; no changes, no substitutions, and made certain that I had reduced the cider to the correct amount both times. The cupcake batter was the weirdest I've ever worked with  very runny. Cupcakes turned out really crisp on top, but impossible to remove from the linings (although the flavor was pretty good). The icing, however, was AMAZING  not too sweet, with a nice tang. I will likely make the icing again (for a spice cake?), but not the cakes.

This is one of those recipes in which you have to use your own judgment as a baker instead of blindly following a recipe. I used only 1 cup of sugar, and just under 1.5 cups of cider. The cupcakes came out moist and with a good consistency, and were a hit with my husband's college students. I did not make the icing exactly as the recipe stated - instead I used 8 oz. cream cheese, 1/4 cup confectioner's sugar, and just a tablespoon or two of the cider. It came out light and not too cider-ey - make sure to whip it well with the mixer attachment, or else it's too sticky to spread. A note about shortening - Spectrum Naturals makes a good organic vegetable shortening with no trans fats or hydrogenated fat. I use it in all recipes calling for shortening, and the results are very good.

This recipe is an unmitigated disaster for many reasons: - the cider, even when reduced, is far too much liquid and makes for a soggy end result - the amount of sugar is outrageously high and disproportionate - the leavening agent (baking soda) is insufficient to give enough rise to the batter, and even if it were correct the batter is too watery to produce a nice crumb - there is not sufficient acid in here to react with the baking soda to produce a good rise -- the recipe would benefit both in texture and flavor from some lemon juice or buttermilk - the use of shortening (**hydrogenated fat**) in a magazine entitled "Gourmet" is outrageous, and the quantity even more shocking. It imparts no flavor whatsoever to the batter. As other reviewers have noted, it is better to use butter instead. - Flavor is lacking -- the recipe would benefit greatly from the addition of finely chopped apples (a soft apple like a Macintosh) and the use of a more concentrated source of apple flavor, such as apple syrup or apple butter. Overall this is an atrocity of a recipe. Don't ever bother making it.

Never use unpasteurized cider or juice of any kind - even if you plan to boil it. The possibility of contracting e.coli is far too high. Further, wash all fruits and vegetables with vinegar and rinse thoroughly. Vinegar kills approximately 98% of pathogens. In this recipe, you may substitute UNFILTERTED apple cider or juice - but it must be pasteurized. One or two tablespoons of commercially prepared boiled cider - available from King Arthur Flour - can be added to the recipe to boost the apple flavor.

During the fall, I try to take advantage of the fact that I'm in upstate New York and use as many of the local resources as possible, (especially the amazing apples!) I made these cupcakes with local cider from a farmer's market, and they were superb. I agree that the shortening is a bit much, so i cut that down a few tsps, and replaced all of the white sugar with dark brown sugar. Additionally, I added spiced rum to the cider reduction. I think these tart little cupcakes were perfectly seasonable, customizable, and delicious!

Overall I was disappointed in this recipe. The cupcakes were INCREDIBLY sticky and all that shortening resulted in a cake that was somewhat flat in flavor (although the apple essence did come through a touch). I used the previous reviewer's recommendation to improve up on the frosting and it was pretty tasty. What I did like about the recipe was the technique of reducing the cider to intensify the flavor, but I don't think that flavor was best served by the other ingredients. Might be worth playing with further.

Yummy! I followed the cake recipe to the letter, except I made it in two 9-inch cake pans, and it was moist and appley. The frosting was the real winner, though. Based on the other reviews, I increased the cream cheese to 8 ounces and added a stick of butter. I used 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of powdered, and to keep it from being too grainy I mixed it with the reduced cider before adding it to the cream cheese. So wonderful! Once the reduced cider cooled, it was almost gelatinous, so I didn't really worry about it making the frosting too runny. Excellent!!!!

A wonderful reduction that produces an intensely apple flavor. Incroyable!!!

I thought it was a wonderful recipe. If the icing is too runny just add more powdered sugar till it is at the consistancy you like.

Really liked the cake but I'm not sure about the icing. I would definitely make the cake again but maybe try a different icing. It was a creamy but too runny.

These cupcakes turned out terrible. The icing was runny and clumpy, and the muffins were too sticky. My husband disliked them instantly.
