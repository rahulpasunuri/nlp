I followed the recipe more or less exactly (only change was that I added a couple of nectarines because I love lots of fruit in my crumble and had some to use up...) Loved the crunchy topping, but found the overall effect to be too sweet. I topped it with some local 52% cream (yummy...) which cut the sweetness a bit, but not quite enough. Next time I make it I think I'll cut the sugar by half in both the fruit and the crumble topping. The filling was a bit soupy too, but I ate it warm (couldn't resist), and think it will probably firm up as it cools. I'll probably add more cornstarch next time I make it to fix this.

Use as much fruit as you want, and 1/4 cup sugar. The fruit should really be sweet enough. I used a combo of peaches, blackberries and blueberries and doubled the cornstarch. Then only 1/3 cup flour 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup oats. The pecans added a nice crisp touch. I really do not like my fruit desserts sweet,but with natural sugar. Yummy! Nice crispy coating and served warm with vanilla ice cream.

What a delightful, refreshing dessert! Peaches and blackberries are not in season here right now so I used frozen. I thawed the fruit and drained it well, then added an additional 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to the fruit mixture since frozen fruit tends to end up more soupy. The consistency was great! I also added about a quarter cup of peach brandy to the fruit, I bet apricot brandy would work well too. The fruit ended up very tart, which I like. The topping was outstanding, but I would have liked a little bit more, I think next time I will make one and a half times the topping. Lastly, I used a 8x12 pan rather than a 9x13 and it was the perfect size. I think the 9x13 would have it spread too thin. YUMMY! Will definitely make again.

I used raspberries instead of blackberries- turned out great. Definitely sweet- sugar could be reduced a little.

Very successful recipe. I found topping just right for a 13 X 9 pan but added more fruit and doubled the sugar, lemon, cornstarch for the extra fruit. I used 5 large peaches, 1 cup blackberries (all I had) and 3 apples cut up. My husband admitted later that he liked this version of fruit cobbler better than the much chewier topping I always used. This will be my new default fruit cobbler recipe.

I have made this many times with many variations of fruit, fresh and frozen, usually with apples as part of the combo, and it's reliable and delicious. I like the pecan topping very much.

Rating: 3
Very tasty but I had problems with the proportions. I used a 9x9 pan and the fruit seemed sparse in the pan. An 8x8 pan would have been sufficient. If I used all the topping, it would have been thicker than the fruit and overwhelmed the flavors - I used probably 2/3 of the topping, and I could have gotten away with half. But it was very tasty and easy to make. The directions didn't specify how to blend the topping - I cut in the butter with my fingers until it was crumbly and that worked fine.

Made this recipe with a little more blackberries than called for and 2 peaches and a ginger gold apple. Sent it with my husband for he and his two buddies to eat while hanging out last night eating fresh crab and steak. My husband just called to say that they were finishing it up late this morning. The three of them ate the whole thing!!! Need I say more?

I had very ripe peaches and made this with no changes to the recipe, but found that the end result was too sweet and ended up a bit too soupy. Next time I'll use firmer peaches, decrease the amount of blackberries to about half, and decrease the amount of sugar mixed into the fruit.

A summertime favorite. I made the recipe as-is, but the sugar can easily be adjusted according to personal taste. When served with vanilla ice cream, I find that the creaminess cuts the sweetness, resulting in the perfect level of sweet.

i thought this was the same recipe I used last year, but I agree with the other review, this one has WAY too much sugar. i had made one last year that had almost no sugar, and it was soooo simple and delicious! I found it on here and now I'm having trouble locating it. The oatmeal pecan crumble was made in a saucepan on the stove and placed on top after the cobbler cooked for a while. i don't think it used Any cornstarch either. it got rave reviews from the guests! if anyone recognizes, please lmk . thanks!

Waaay too much sugar. I'd probably cut both the sugar in the fruit and the topping in half next time. Or I'll just stick to my normal crisp recipe, which is no recipe at all! Just mixing amounts that seem right. I added a little melted butter on top near the end because the topping seemed to have to much of the dry ingredients.

Was in charge of dessert for a dinner party and wanted to use blackberries and peaches from my freezer. I mostly defrosted the frozen fruit, drained the liquid and then used slightly more cornstarch to make up for any extra liquid. Recipe turned out perfectly-- jammy and comforting! Next time, I may use less nutmeg (or eliminate it altogether) to make the crisp taste less like fall and more like summer since the fruits are summer-y. Huge crowd pleaser with vanilla bean ice-cream. The guys loved it.

I thought there were too many blackberries to taste the flavor of the peaches. If I made it again, I'd use half as many blackberries and maybe 5 peaches instead of 3. I also thought the pecans caused there to be too many flavors, so I would probably omit them.

Made this several times this summer with different combinations of white peaches, necatarines, raspberries and blueberries. Every time it came out excellent. Not too sweet, even better when made with firm fruit and topped with vanilla ice cream.

I used 3 lbs. peaches, no blackberries and increased the oats to 3/4 cup. I prepared the fruit and topping mixtures in the morning and kept them in separate Ziploc bags in the fridge until just before baking later that night; there was very little darkening of the peaches. I used a spoon with holes to scoop the peaches into an 8x8 baking pan, leaving most of the juices behind. It was not runny at all and tasted perfect. The peaches reduce considerably during baking so next time I will increase the peaches to 4 lb. for more peach flavour and use a 4" high-sided 8x8" Chicago Metallic baking pan.

The best thing about this recipe is that it's very forgiving--you can mix and match types and quantities of fruit and it will still come out fine. I had more blackberries than peaches and it was delicious. The topping is perfect. It holds really well too--mine stayed decently crispy after 3 days in the fridge.

Love this recipe! I was looking for a good fruit crisp using nuts and oats in the topping and this fit the bill perfectly, but I have never tried it with just peaches and blackberries. We go to the farmer's market every weekend in the summer, and I make it with fresh peaches, nectarines, strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries - a basket each of the berries, and one or two each of the stone fruit. Always a huge hit served warm with vanilla ice cream. The amount of sugar is fine because of the tartness of the berries, and the quantity of topping is perfect for the amount of fruit I use. I've made it at least a half dozen times.

Do add a bit of almond oil to enhance the peaches! I found the following formula to work well: for every cup of peaches, add 1 t. cornstarch, 2 T sugar and 1/4 t. almond oil. I often omit the blackberries but have added raspberries which I think is even better than the blackberries.

I recently made this for my husband's 40th. Organic peaches were 98c a pound and blackberries were ridiculously cheap, too. Using quality fruit made this crisp divine! It was gone in a matter of minutes. FYI, I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9 X 13. I think this is one of the best crisp recipes I have ever encountered.

My parents are coming for Easter so I started to rid my freezer of old or rarely used items to make room for more goodies I'm making for their stay. I saw this recipe and although I love blackberries, I wasn't sure about adding peaches. A bag of Wal-Mart peaches (1 lb) has been in the freezer for months along with blackberries (2 1/2 cups) picked last summer. Because ice covered all of the fruit, I didn't hold out much hope for this recipe. I used two tablespoons cornstarch because of the extra liquid from the ice, the 2 tbl of lemon juice and even 1 tbl of lime juice (I also need to empty the refrigerator). Because of one reviewer's suggestion I doubled the oats, and I have decided that this crisp is fantastic and really doesn't need any changes. This summer I'll try it with fresh ingredients along with the peach and brown sugar ice cream. I have been faithful to my month long diet until tasting this - and now I've blown the diet big time!

I made 1 1/2 times the topping, and substituted blueberries for the blackberries, but kept all the other ingredients as listed. I baked in a 9 X 11 dish and the four early 20's guys that I served ended up asking for the dish and some spoons.

Delicious!!! Perfect when fresh peaches and blackberries are in season. I melted the butter for the crumb topping for ease. When I made this recipe for the second time, I didn't use all of the juices that the fresh fruit produced and the cobbler was much better (less soupy). This is definitely a winner topped with homemade vanilla ice cream.

This is heavenly & will be my go-to dessert this summer as long as I can find good local peaches and blackberries! I reduced the amount of fruit just slightly & halved the topping to bake in an 11 x 7 pan, since there are just two of us. Do reduce the cooking time.

This was good, but not a stunner. It certainly was easy. I didn't add all the sugar that the recipe called for, both in the fruit and the topping and it was still a bit too sweet. Summer fruit is so delicious and I thought the sugar masked the natural flavor, so next time I'll add even less sugar. The toasted pecans are a very nice touch in the topping.

After reading and using tips from all the reviews, this is my first review. For good reason. This recipe is fabulous! I doubled everything, used 1/2 c. fresh-frozen pineapple pieces, 10 apricots and lots of peaches I'd just picked. Added the juice from the bottom of the bowl of peaches and some cinnamon into the slurry of cornstarch and lemon and cooked it in a little larger pyrex dish, probably 11x14. Cooked it an extra 30 minutes to crisp it. Lots of fruit, lots of crispy topping, lots of flavor. A little runny when hot, but great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Set up great overnight in the fridge. Almost lunch time. Can't wait for my next piece! May skip my sandwich and go directly to dessert! Suzy

Fabulous crisp! Family and teenage friends loved it. Have made it 3 times in 2 weeks, now. I used fresh raspberries instead of blackberries, and doubled the oats to one cup. We like more crunch. I like to melt the butter before mixing the topping. It makes it crunchy and is a lot easier. Try it.

Aah, it's blackberry season! Delicious fruit crisp, lovely blend of flavours and a great topping. However, I think the proportion of fruit to topping is off for a 9x13 pan - fruit mix needs to be increased by half while the topping is barely adequate. I also tried making in a 8x8 pan - fruit amount was good but too much topping. Some previous reviewers mention using a 7x11 pan which I think would be a better size for the amounts given. All this may depend on your personal liking - more fruit or more topping. Personally, I think the fruit should take centre stage and the topping play a supporting role.

This produced great results! I used in-season peaches and blueberries instead of blackberries (like a lot of reviewers did). Don't use too deep a dish or you will have to adjust the temperature and cooking time.

Yum. I used 6 white peaches and a pint of blueberries in a 13x9 dish. My peaches weren't super sweet, so the sugar really helped.

This was a very good crisp recipe with a couple of modifications. I added twice the amount of peaches, about 3 lbs., to two cups of blueberries (didn't have blackberries). To accomodate, I increased the cornstarch to 1 1/2 tbsps., the sugar to about a 1/2 cup, and the lemon juice to 3 tbsps. It worked perfectly. I would suggest using a smaller baking dish as well. I used an 11 by 7 oval dish and it was the perfect size. I cooked for about an hour. The crisp topping was sufficient for this size dish. I omitted the pecans because my son is allergic to nuts and increased the amount of oatmeal slightly to accomodate for the change. I thought the topping was wonderful and wouln't bother adding the pecans even if my son wasn't allergic. Topped with vanilla haagen dazs ice cream. YUM!

This was a good crips recipe, however, I found that there wasn't nearly enough fruit to use a 9x13 pan. I used a 7x10. I thought the quanitity of topping was quite adequate. The idea is to enhance the fruit, not hide it in sugar, etc. I had the most beautifully large and ripe blackberries with fresh, juicy peaches and the topping was just enough to allow the fruit to "headline" the show! Over hagen-daaz, it was certainly a lovely dessert (for a 7x10 pan).

I made small/half recipe, baked in a pie plate but made the entire topping recipe. I agree, not nearly enough topping as written. (I too skipped the pecans to accommodate child preferences). Also, I had trouble with the juiciness of the fruit even though I used the full amount of cornstarch for half the fruit; fortunately I predicted this, baked without topping for a while; I ended up adding some tapioca, microwaving till hot THEN putting topping on and baking in the oven till golden. It was pretty good, I would make it again but my way, the topping with fresh nutmeg is a keeper.
