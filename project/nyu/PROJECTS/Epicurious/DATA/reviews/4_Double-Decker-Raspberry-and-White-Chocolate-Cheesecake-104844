I followed the recipe pretty closely except I couldn't find white chocolate at trader joes so I used dark instead. Delicious. Also used chocolate cat cookies and I find wafers to be impossible to find.

I just made this for the first time and it turned out well, got lots of compliments and even won an informal chocolate dessert contest! I did not find it to be complicated. Since several reviews said it was very sweet, I only used 1 cup sugar. I had to use 12oz chocolate biscuits in order to go high enough up the sides of the pan for the crust. Next time I will put in slightly more white chocolate as I couldn't taste it enough. Ten minutes before the end of cooking time, I removed it from the oven, spooned over a mixture of approx 1 1/2 cups of creme fraiche (sour cream is fine) and 3T of sugar, and returned it to the oven, as I do whenever I make cheesecake to make a smoother top (thank you Susan Branch). Right before serving I decorated the top with the rest of the raspberry coulis and whole raspberries, which cut the sweetness well.

This cheesecake tasted great. My boyfriend requested rasberry, white chocolate for his birthday, so I tried this recipe. The only down side was that it was super rich, I was worried at first when he stopped eating 2/3 the way through, then I tasted it and understood that it was the richness, not the flavor that made it hard to finish. Next time I will try it using only use (3) 8- ounce packages of cream cheese. I also spooned the extra rasberry puree over each slice, and topped it with a few of the extra white chocolate chips rather than the white chocolate curls and whole berries.

My father-in-law was from Austria, and he taught me years ago how to make cheesecake in the cusineart processor he gave me. This recipe takes the cake! I have made this twice now and it is a very big hit, even for folks who aren't big cheesecake fans. I made it for a 7 year old girl's birthday who told me that I am allowed to make all of her cakes from now on! She has been into collecting rocks and minerals so I decorated it with the chocolate pebble candy and rock candy...it was so cute! I tried to even out the layers as some suggested, but must say that I liked it better just the way the recipe is. Last time I topped it with a white chocolate ganache which made it even richer. I also decreased the sugar to just 1 cup and added 1/4 cup of seedless raspberry jam and baked the raspberry for 50 minutes. Much better!

I made this for Christmas Eve dessert and everyone loved it. I followed the recipe exactly and it was easy and delicious. The middle of the raspberry layer was a little gooey so maybe would cook longer next time, but no one seemed to mind. I topped with fresh raspberries and mini chocolate chips. It made quite a presentation.

This recipe is great as is, and is definitely the BEST cheesecake that I make. I only receive rave reviews from anyone having a piece, and I personally love this recipe as well. It is a lot easier to make than it looks. I have been making this recipe since it was in Bon Appetite over 10 years ago!

This cake came out excellent. Several guests asked for the recipe. It was really much more simple than I thought. The most time consuming part was straining the raspberry seeds. Only a few minor changes, I used lemon cookies as a base that went really well with the raspberry flavor. I also made a milk chocolate ganache by putting milk chocolate and heavy cream over a double boiler and drizzled over the top and dotted it with raspberries. I will definitely make this again.

1. Cut the sugar to 3/4 cup from 1 1/3 cup and the white chocolate to 5 ounces from 6 ounces, it's too sweet. 2. The raspberry layer is too thick compared to the white chocolate layer, reserve 2 1/2 cups for the white chocolate layer instead of 2 1/4. 3. Wait until the raspberry layer is done and cooling before melting and combining the chocolate for the top layer, this will save you time.

Rating: 4
I made the recipe just as is with none of the changes suggested by others. It was excellent. I can't imagine using milk or dark chocolate in this. It has a great creamy texture, and it is both rich and light at the same time b/c of the subtleness of the raspberry and white chocolate. Definitely try it as is before experimenting.

Rating: 4
This is my base cheesecake recipe and I can't count how many times I have made it! I do add a little Chambord to the raspberry puree (And have also used raspberry jam instead when I am lazy). I've substituted dark chocolate for the white chocolate. I've branched out and done a chocolate cherry cheesecake, a lemon/lime (add a little salt), peanut butter cup, caramel chocolate (reduce the sugar for the bottom layer), etc. The possibilities are endless! I think next I may do a blueberry lemon...YUM

Really good!!! My mother though said it was too rich so I used two regular cream cheeses and two light cream cheeses. I also used all of the raspberry puree. I dont know if this made a difference or not but it was really good! Took a lot of work, but was worth it. I would make this again!

I made this for a colleague's 60th birthday-turned out fantastic AND gorgeous! Made a few alterations as I really wanted it to be "Over-the-top!" First off, I replaced the white chocolate in the top layer with dark chocolate and milk chocolate (Callebaut- or any other good quality chocolate would make it good)-since this layer seems dense i combined with some whipped cream which lightened it up a little; I made the crust thicker and added walnuts for extra crunch; i also added a final layer of sour cream/sugar/vanilla that i baked for about 10 minutes. the white top layer makes it easier to decorate. I garnished the cake with almonds stuck to the side of the cheesecake and raspberries all around. Topped with a little bit of raspberry syrup and it's a masterpiece :)

I've made many cheesecakes, and just wasn't terribly impressed with this one. The crust might have benefited from some semisweet chocolate chips to accentuate the chocolate flavor. The raspberry in the filling might have been stronger. Finally, the white chocolate didn't add terribly much to the dessert...might be better with a bittersweet/semisweet chocolate filling instead?

Rating: 4
A huge success! I altered the recipe a little and used frozen berries instead of raspberries and it tasted great. Increased the amount of crust, too. Overall, this cheesecake is a little time-consuming to make, but most definitely worth the effort. Topped with berries, it also looks beautiful!

The first time I made this, I used white chocolate chips instead of bar chocolate, and it tasted chemically and awful. THis time I used dark chocolate chips (and no white chocolate)and it turned out really well. Several people at the table said it was delicious and that it looked beautiful. A few suggestions for easy preparation... first of all I never understand a recipe that calls for 12 oz of raspberries pureed, but you only need a fraction of that. I used fresh raspberries from the garden and they were fine. I made the crust with graham crackers, and just added cocoa to the mix, which also cuts down on the too sweetness of the crust. Next, use a food processor for the cream cheese filling. After melting whatever color chocolate you want, add the requisite cream cheese filling to it. Then with the remaining cream cheese filling in your food processor, just add the fresh or frozen raspberries, and process them straight into the filling. I have never been bothered by raspberry seeds, and certainly didn't notice any detracting from the flavor of the finished cake. This way, you don't waste any reaspberries, you don't have to put them through a sieve, there is far less kitchen detritus to clean up, and the whole process takes much less time. I also didn't have any cream on hand, and just used a little 2% milk instead. I covered the slightly cracked top with fresh raspberries and grated chocolate. Very nice result.

This was a great cheese cake! I've never made cheese cake before and it turned out wonderfully. I substituted about half semi-sweet chocolate pieces for the white. It made the top a nice brown instead of yellow-ish. I put both red and orange raspberries on the top as a garnish. Very good looking! When I put the cake in the water to cook some of the water leaked into the pan. Next time I will make sure to use parchment paper. But it didn't change the outcome of the cake a bit.

I really like this cheesecake. To boost the raspbary flavor, I mix a few (3-4, or to taste) tablespoons of raspberry preserves to the thawed raspberries before straining them. This pumps up the raspberry flavor without adding extra liquid to the recipe.

Although this dessert was good, I do not think that it was worth the trouble. Seiving the raspberries, melting the chocolate, grinding the cookies for crumbs...it was all too time consuming for me. The extra effort should have produced something stupendous but it did not. The raspberry flavor is bland and the white chocolate does not add much. Maybe a milk or dark chocolate layer would be better. Has anyone tried that?

Rating: 4
Yuh-umm! This is stupendous. The raspberry is to die for. Following other cooks' suggestions I used Nilla wafers for the crust. I baked the raspberry portion for 55 minutes and refrigerated the finished cheesecake for 36 hours before serving - the consistency was perfect. If you need a dessert to impress, look no further.

I make a lot of cheesecakes, but this is one that I like to make to impress. The flavors and texture are wonderful. I used vanilla wafers (Nillas) for the crust instead of the chocolate. I find that out of all the cookies I have experimented with, my opinion is that vanilla wafers make the best crusts.

Rating: 3
This was quite nice; it was one of 4 large cheesecakes I served at an annual barbeque in our home this summer. I used the extra raspberry puree as a sauce for guests to pour on the cheesecake if they wished; it made an excellent cheesecake even a little more special. The only change I might make the next time I make it would be to replace the dark chocolate crust with one made from animal crackers (it makes a far better crust than graham crackers in my opinion), as the white chocolate is so delicate that the dark crust almost overwhelmed it.

Excellent cheesecake - wonderful texture, very creamy and melts in your mouth! Beautiful presentation! I baked the raspberry layer about 5 minutes longer than stated in recipe and it was perfect, the white chocolate layer exactly 30 minutes, & immediately placed it into refridgerator and it was perfect. Will definitely make this recipe again, received raves reviews from dinner guest.

This cheesecake has a wonderful creamy texture, the raspberry section has a lovely fruit flavor and the top tastes just like white chocolate. I used the Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers for the crust which gave a nice sharp "dark chocolate" contrast. Based on everyone's comments I let the raspberry layer bake for 60 minutes and it came out perfectly.

Made this as part of a dessert buffet for a progressive dinner for 30 people, and everyone who had it say it's the best cheesecake they've had. I mistakenly got Lindt coconut white chocolate instead of regular white chocolate, and the flavor melded beautifully with the raspberry, so if you like coconut, I would definitely recommend looking for the coconut white chocolate. Also, the cheesecake baked beautifully, no cracks and was entirely even on top (just make sure you don't overbeat the batter and run a knife along the edges shortly after you remove it from the over before it's had a chance to cool).

I'm a huge cheesecake fan, and this recipe did not disappoint. I took it to a dinner party, and there were absolutely no leftovers. I was getting compliments left & right, and one person even told me he had never tasted anything like it before. I had a couple of minor quibbles: 1) my raspberry layer must not have been completely set, because it started to "melt" slightly at the party, so next time, I will cook for a little longer, and 2) my bottom crust stuck to the pan and was very difficult to remove, so next time, I'm going to use some parchment paper for insurance. All in all, a wonderful recipe, and I can't wait for a chance to make it again for another dinner party.

This is absolutely to die for!!! I made this for New Year's and everyone loved it. I read some of the other reviews and took some of their advice. I made the top layer with semi-sweet chocolate and I put 3 tblsp of Chambord in the raspberry part. It helped to bring out the raspberry flavor. I baked the crust just like the recipe and had no problem. I might reduce the butter down to 6 tblsp next time though. The center part of the crust did turn out a bit mushy. I have made several other cheesecakes from this site before but even my mom says this is the best one. Not too strong on the chocolate and not too strong on the raspberry. Each part compliments each other splendidly.

I have made this twice now, and followed the directions exctly. Although it is very good, and everyone loved the taste, I cannot get it to be firm enough when I slice it and serve it. I too reserved the leftover juices to put on the plate, and garnished with fresh raspberries and the presentation was nice....if I could have had firmer slices.

Turned out great. I didn't bother to puree the raspberries - I just mashed them up into the cheesecake batter. I used a normal graham crust because I didn't have any chocolate cookies. I think it would probably be even better with a chocolate crust. Next time!

This beautiful cheesecake has become my signature dessert. I make it every year for my husband's birthday and last year I caught him in the fridge at 3am! I love to reserve a small amount of the white chocolate batter and color it using paste food dye. I have done red and green for Christmas, black and orange for Halloween and red and blue for the 4th of July. I swirl the colors into the top layer before it is cooked and the result is always unique. The oohs and ahhs come before they even taste it with more to follow when they do!

I agree, the raspberry flavor does not jump out at you. I made a sauce with raspberry puree, raspberry and amaretto liquors to squiggle on the bottom of the plates and decorated the top of the cheesecake with fresh raspberries and homemade chocolate leaves. The presentation was great!

This cheesecake definately has the WOW factor for guests, but I didn't find the flavor to be all that exciting. I think the raspberry layer lacked depth and over all was just bland. I'm so glad that I made the sauce and served with whipped cream too. That was the best part! My cake also was over done with the times in the recipe. Not burnt or ruined but had gotton a little too dry. Changed the texture. I won't make this again.

I loved this recipe except like the others I left out the almond flavoring and also the almond nuts. I also cut down on the butter in the crust and used only 1/2 stick of unsalted butter added a chocolate ganache with 2 tsp of raspberry puree to give it a choco/raspberry flavor. I put this on the top of the cake after it was fully cooled and then decorated it with the white chocolate curls and fresh red raspberry around the edge. My family and friends thought it was the best cheesecake I have ever made....and I make alot of desserts. I will definitely be making this one again and again. You won't be disappointed if you make this recipe.

This went down a storm with my family who are almond freaks (so I found out!). I thought the almond flavouring was a bit too strong personally and drowned out the raspberry taste. Next time I make it, I'm going to halve the almond essence, double the raspberries and double the white chocolate as well.

This is the best cheesecake I have made or eaten. It was moist and delicious, and not too sweet. I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust (couldn't find chocolate wafers) and omitted the almond extract. It does take some time, but all the steps are easy, and the results are well worth it. Great for a special occasion. Make sure to top with raspberries and shaved chocolate to complete the look.

I've baked several types of cheesecake, and this one is by far the BEST!! I substitute a traditional graham cracker crust instead of the chocolate crumb crust and it turns out perfect everytime. Its a bit too sweet, so i typically use only 1 C sugar and about 4-oz white choc. One peice of advice* - make sure to use good quality choclate. I cheated once and used some unfamiliar brand of choc. and it got all lumpy in the batter. Also, I usually keep some of the strawberry juice reserved and swirl it into the top layer - it gives it a nice touch. Good luck!

Rating: 4
I've made many of the better cheesecakes on Epicurious, and this one's consistency is definitely the best. To answer some questions from other reviewers: 1) The top shouldn't brown at all; if that's happening, you're either cooking it too long or at too high of a temperature. 2) I did need to cook the raspberry section 10 more minutes than advertised. 3) I cut the sugar to 1 cup and the white chocolate to 5 ounces but it was still a bit too sweet, I will cut even more next time. 4) Keep the cheesecake in the water bath at all times, be sure to aluminum tightly if you're worried about water getting through the springform. 5) 12 ounces of raspberries gives a ton of puree so I echo the other recommendations to use that for glaze. Or, since you'll have so much leftover whipping cream, go ahead and whip up both of those together. Or just use less raspberry since it's fairly expensive. 6) Definitely wait to make the 2nd layer batter until after the first is nearly done. In fact you can wait until you take the first half out and prepare the white chocolate half while the first half is cooling. 7) If you don't have a water bath available, don't worry about it. I baked two cheesecakes side by side, one in a bath and one just straight on the rack, for the same amount of time and didn't notice any appreciable differences. 8) I didn't have any need to butter the springform, I just put the crust directly on a dry springform and this is what is called for in all other recipes I've seen.

I've made this dessert at least a dozen times. Even people who say they usually don't like cheesecake love this dessert (including myself!)It is a bit time consuming, but it is not difficult to make. I think the 'steam bath' is essential. I've used both dark and white chocolate for the top layer. Also, I put the white chocolate portion in a pastry bag and pipe it on top of the raspberry portion. It is much easier than trying to spoon it in concentric circles.

Only thing I can think of is I think I would have preferred the chocolate cookie crust to be a bit crisper, so maybe I'll cut down on the butter next time. No, why jinx it?

This is a great cheesecake! I have served it twice to rave reviews...makes for a beautiful presentation with raspberry sauce and few fresh raspberries. I didn't care much for the chocolate crust the first time I made it, so I substuited vanilla wafers instead of the chocolate and it came out better than before!

The recipe came out beautiful, the layers are inpressive, though the cooking time is definitely longer than the recipe states, especially on the raspberry layer. I think the white layer would be better sans the white chocolate, try as I may to work with good quality white chocolate in recipes, I just don't think it tastes like anything and I much prefer a vanilla flavor. Also, the raspberry sauce (amaretto, chambord, raspberry puree, sugar) was a MUST! Without it, the cheesecake tasted a bit like white chocolate raspberry yogurt!

This cake is for the serious cheesecake/dessert lover! It's a little time-consuming to make, but well worth the effort. It makes a wonderful presentation. Definitely make extra raspberry sauce for your plates. You're in for a treat.

Recipe does not tell exactly when to remove the springform pan from the water bath, only when to remove the "roasting pan" from the oven. Since the cheesecake must be put back into the oven after addind the white chocolate topping - one must guess weather it is put back in or out of the water bath!! What's the correct procedure? I left it in the bath for both trips to the oven and it seemed to come out OK. Also, the top of my cake browned (had to cover up the top as it did not come out white like your picture!! Oven too hot???

We made this new year's eve and ate it right after midnight. It turned out great and tasted amazing! We always use 1/3 less fat cream cheese which may make it not so rich. We also made a sauce with the leftover puree and tossed in some blueberries too.

I made this recipe for a Christmas Eve family gathering. It was a huge hit. Everyone loved it. It is flavorful, creamy, just right. We fought over the leftovers.

I made this cheesecake for 2 holiday parties and it was a huge success both times. A few suggestions: melt the white chocolate just before the raspberry layer is done cooking (the first time I followed the recipe and it was a little bit lumpy); I topped the cake with a black raspberry jam that I thinned with a little Chambord. I then put a few defrosted raspberries (couldn't get fresh) scattered around the top. I also make a sauce with the leftover raspberry puree, a little bit of Chambord and a few tbsp. sugar and drissled on each plate before adding a slice. YUM! PS I love raspberries, so I (and everyone else) loved the added raspberry flavor.

I made this again (made it before last year) and it was quite undercooked after the second baking. Did anyone else have his trouble? I made it for my husband's secretary's Bday since he brags on her cakes. He said they raved and all want the recipee. This is what I fix when it absolutely must be FAB. This is well worth the effort in both presentation and flavor.

I've made this several times and everyone loves it. Can anyone tell me how to keep the crust from sticking to the sides and bottom of the pan? Yes, I grease the pan. Thanks.

Thank you to all the other chefs who submitted their very helpful hints. As suggested, I decreased the amount of sugar and added the raspberry sauce recipe to decorate the plates and the dessert was a hit with everyone. Although it takes a bit of time, this recipe is very easy to make and impressive.

This dessert was a perfect compliment to the evening. I presented it in a romantic home-atmosphere date to my girl and she loved it. It was my first time making a thing of this nature, and it was quite simple to make with easy to follow instructions.

This cheesecake is definately a show-off! I made it for the last day of our wine tasting course where everyone brought something. We had to hide it until the end as no one wanted to wait. Definately a port lovers dream it complemented the combination of complex flavors of vanilla, chocolate, raspberry and almond. No one believed that it was homemade, and if I was still in the catering business, I could have picked up 3 new jobs. The only thing I found was that it took longer to cook than the recipe stated, the raspberry layer was still slightly soft after 1 day in fridge and seemed to overpower the white chocolate flavor. Unfortunately I let it go too long where the white chocolate layer slightly bronzed. I covered up the mistake by "icing" with seeded raspberry jam...looked beautiful. Next time I will make more of the white chocolate layer to cut the raspberry.

Wonderful but very rich! It is great for a dinner party if you really want to WOW your guests! All of mine were SO IMPRESSED! I served it with a raspberry sauce.....all the left over strained raspberry juices/puree from the bag of frozen rapberries that I used and added a little Chambord, Armaretto and sugar....put in a squeeze bottle, shook together and decorated the dessert plates with it! It added a refreshing "dip" for the very rich cheesecake! Everyone thought the sauce made the dessert and it looked so pretty! We loved it!

My girlfreind made this for me as part of a very romantic dinner that she recently prepared for the both of us. When I tasted it I groaned with exstasy. It is a very sexy dessert. The combination of white chocolate and rasberries is perfect. The taste and texture was smooth and creamy. The two tone and two contrasting flavors definitely aroused my taste buds. This is a big must for all you cheesecake LOVERS out there.

This cheesecake is the best I've made! The white chocolate cuts the richness (just a little) and gives a unique flavor. The raspberry stripe is striking. The in'laws raved about this dessert. It's a bit labor intensive, but worth every step.

I made this as a birthday for someone who loves cheesecake. It was a huge hit! I only encountered one problem, I didn't have enough crust so I had to make more. Delicious and impressive!

What a dessert! This thing was so rich...it was pretty amazing. Just be sure to make it a day in advance so it can have plenty of time chill, and the flavor will be even better.

Took this cake to a Memorial Day barbecue and made a big splash with it. It looks like a lot of steps to make it, but it really isn't that difficult to make.

A very good show off cake for us men. Easy to make, the presentation is wonderful and the people just rave over it. It is better if it sits a day before serving, the flavors blend better.

Made this for my step-daughter's graduation. Everyone absolutely loved it. It tastes exactly like the cheesecake I used to buy from "The Paris Market" that has since moved to Atlanta. My husband's favorite cake has been "Aunt Tom's Italian Cream Cake," which I got from Epicurious. Now, this cake has taken its place as his favorite.

I have made this many times. It has been rated as the BEST CHEESECAKE EVER by many of my friends. I am a caterer and it is one of my most requested cakes.

This was a great recipe. I made it for easter and it was a blast. It was a little to sweet, but we all still loved it. Instead of the choc curls, I garnished the top with fresh raspberries and glazed them with raspberry jam, SO GOOD!!! Yes, I would make this again.

Great!! I made this cheesecake for Easter and everyone raved, even the children loved it. I decided to make a raspberry sauce in case the cheesecake was dry or boring, it made the recipe a lot more interesting and delicious. The sauce was simple 3 cups raspberries, 3/4 cup sugar, and 3 T. amaretto. I blended on puree and strained. I served the cheesecake with sauce and fresh raspberries. Very Pretty!!

Simply the best! I made it for a Pasover dinner and it was a hit, everybody loved it. It was rich, yet not too sweet.

This is a great recipe, although I would agree with the other comment that you shouldn't start the white chocolate melting/mixing until the raspberry layer is about done baking. I also thought the recipe a little too sweet, but overall it was incredible! I had dreams about that cake!

This recipe was great. I normally don't care for almond extract in my recipes, but it was wonderful-not too much. The only negatives about this recipe is that it is more time-consuming than your average cheesecake because of the layers and straining the raspberries. It was also much more expensive to make than a regular cheesecake. I will, however, still make it on very special occasions.

PERFECT - This is an extraordinary recipe! Including the almond flavoring, high-rated-in-cholestorol-cream cheese, white choco & all the rest!

This cheesecake was outstanding! I have made it twice and everybody has loved it. I didn't have the correct sized springform pan, so made it in an 8 inch and a 6 inch pan instead and it worked fine.

Yum! A bit heavy, but most cheesecakes do that on purpose. Substituted semi-sweet chocolate for the white chocolate, which tasted fine but ended up looking grainy, I think because the chocolate part of the batter sat around while the raspberry layer was baking. I would wait to melt the chocolate and mix it into the batter right before it's time to spoon it into the pan.

This was an incredible cheesecake! I used 1/3 less-fat cream cheese, and it came out wonderfully! I like how the recipe included the water bath to keep it from cracking after leaving the oven. I did not care for the almond extract, as I am not a big fan of that flavor. Next time I make it I will not be using almond extract. Other than that, it was a huge hit in my house, and everyone who has tried it knows how I love to cook!
