Good, simple recipe for Thanksgiving. Cut the potatoes into wedges and roasted them first instead of using whole potatoes.

I followed the butter portion of this recipe. I didn't have individual sweet potatoes to serve to each guest, so I served slices as other reviewers did as well. Though this was good, it didn't have a WoW quality that I look for in recipes for Thanksgiving. I'll be looking for a new recipe to make for next year's feast.

Wonderful! I ended up baking and mashing the yams, as I wasn't sure the extended family would accept whole/sliced for the once-a-year Thanksgiving. After I mashed them, I added the maple-spice butter,all of it, and also the grated rind of two oranges. It was sooo good! But to make sure it was sweet enought, I made a marshmallow sauce and drizzeled it over, cutting it through for a marblized effect. Many said it was their favorite dish, and it was mine too!

This was so easy and very tasty! I served it for Easter dinner with the mustard fennel pork loin recipe also from this wonderful site. It was a huge success.

This dish was the hit of our Christmas dinner. Finally, I have found THE yam dish to serve during the holidays -- this is a keeper. I had to make it ahead of time, and frankly didn't want to serve whole yams, so after I cooked the yams, I whipped them with the electric mixer, then added some of the butter. Reheated the next day with fantastic results. The butter is one of the great flavor sensations ever! Now I'm looking for more things to do with it. Maybe I'll just get some more yams.....

Yummy, and very easy. I cut the potatoes and roasted them with a little olive oil, salt and pepper until they were tender and then tossed them in the butter and put them back into the oven to allow the sauce to glaze. Delicious!

I did this for a fancy dinner party, and it was the most talked about dish. Actually, the butter was the most talked about dish. People put it on their turkey, on their brussel sprouts, etc. And SO easy. I was roasting a stuffed turkey breast at 375 and just stuck the yams in the oven for the last hour the breast cooked. It was all done at the same time, and the simplest dish on the menu.

Fantastic yam recipe! Not too sweet and so yummy! Wonderful flavor. Consider adding coarsely chopped roasted pecans as a topping too.

Fantastic yam recipe! Addition: Try topping yams with coarsely chopped roasted pecans in addition to the allspice butter. Really a great recipe with or without the pecans.

This is the PERFECT yam recipe! I love the way the flavor of the yam is highlighted and not hidden behind a wall of sugar. I will definitely keep this recipe!

I added a couple of tablespoons of ricotta to an already yummy potato topping - double yum!

It is a sweet , yet not overpower taste which conjures up feelings of good home cooking. I wouldn't substitute anything. I loved it!

This is a delicious recipe. I made individual roasted yams for 12 guests. Baked in one hour on a baking sheet on the top shelf of the oven. The butter was a big hit, and truly enhanced the flavor of the sweet yams, instead of drowning it in sweetness. Added a bit extra spices and syrup to taste. The butter also went well with the cornbread that was served, and would be nice with breakfast, too. Use Garnet yams if possible. This wi
