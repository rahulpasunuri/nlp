Huge hit at the office potluck and really easy to make. In addition to the pineapple, mango and kiwi that the recipe called for I also added some blueberries and strawberries to spice up the color a bit. The apricot glaze was a nice touch. Delicious!

Yum! This took all of fifteen minutes to make and it was wonderful! I served it at dinner with four of my girlfriends, and we finished the entire thing; I plan on making it again this weekend to take to a party. I bought a frozen unbaked pie shell in a pan (the ones from Whole Foods are delicious), so that made things even simpler.

This recipe was so easy to make and the presentation quality was incredibly beautiful! Perfect for summer desserts; cool and refreshing for outdoor parties. I used peaches, blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, and kiwis.

This recipe is so easy! The lemon cream cheese filling is so refreshing and light, and the presentation is just stunning. If you don't like the fruit suggested in the recipe, substitute with any fruit you enjoy, and it will still come out just perfect. The tart looks like a $35 tart that you might buy at Dean & Deluca, but it cost only a few dollars to make. Perfect for a special occassion. Perfect for fruit lovers! The glaze is just lovely, too. I made this four times already, and will be writing it into my permanent collection for future "last minute" pot lucks!

i have had much better fruit tarts in the past. The cream cheese mix does not compliment the kiwi, mango, etc. I would not recommend this tart recipe.

This is an excellent tart recipe--perhaps my favorite! I've made it about four times in the past few months, always to rave reviews. Plus, its absolutely beautiful. It looks like it took a ton of work, but is truly quick and easy to prepare. I also used strawberries rather than pineapple (I think it looks nicer with the contrast of green from the kiwi and orange from the mango). I used more than the 2 tablespoons of the apricot preserves because I like the glossy look. Again, an excellent, easy recipe!

This is a great tart. I made it with 1 mango, 2 kiwis, and strawberries (I am afraid the strawberries took away the "tropical aspect" of the recipe). I used 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract instead of the vanilla extract alone. Since I do not really like store bought pie crust, I used the recipe for "Flaky Pie Crust" from this site. I'll certainly make this recipe again.

Very easy! Plus, it makes a beautiful presentation. It is very light and delicious. I made this for a baby shower two weeks ago and have ended up making it three times since then. I didn't have a single piece left!

This recipe was so easy and very elegant looking. Use any fruit you like or that is in season. I had grapes, mandarin oranges, blueberries and rasberries. Everyone loved it. They didn't believe that it was homemade at first. Very easy to make

So easy and very delicious! I used kiwi, strawberries, blueberries, mandarin oranges, and raspberries. I also added a tad more vanilla. Everyone wanted to know at what bakery I had purchased the tart! It was that good!
