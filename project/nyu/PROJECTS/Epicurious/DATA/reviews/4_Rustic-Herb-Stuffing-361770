I like swiss chard and stuffing, but do not like this combination. I made the recipe exactly and served with Turkey. The swiss chard I used was of good quality and fairly mild when I tasted raw, but it is too strong for the stuffing. Perhaps, too much in recipe I don't know. If you do make this, suggest you serve w/a more robust meat such as lamb or beef.

Lots of good stuff in this one! I just added half of a chopped onion; used both French and sourdough bread. Very tasty.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuffing! A lot of work, but well worth it in the end! I have made it two years now, and I must say, it is better without the parmesan cheese!

What a wonderful combination. The herb mixture was so wonderful. It is a lot of chopping so preparing the night before is a must. A good basic and classic stuffing.

Really nice stuffing- loved by all! I made it last year, and have requests to make it again, so I am!

This is a keeper. One of the best stuffings I've had. Delicious!

have made it twice, quite tasty and guests raved about it. swapped in extra celery for the chard the 2nd time and it was still fabulous.

I've made this twice now and it's turned out awesome. I 3 me some stuffing, but this is stuffing with an extra side of veggies which is just fabulous. As you can see, the recipe calls for chard, but I used kale once instead and that worked out fine. I think and equivalent portion of any green like spinach or whatever is cheap will also work! Also, go ahead and double the amount of fresh herbs in the recipe... you have to buy that whole package of them in the store anyhow and the stuffing really benefits from it!
