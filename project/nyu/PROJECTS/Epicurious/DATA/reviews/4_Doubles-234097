Excellent recipe! I do suggest that the dough recipe is doubled as the other reviews have said. I served this with store bought mango chutney and tamarind chutney. I also used the warm cilantro dipping sauce from this site and minced some raw cabbage for crunch. The kids loved. They ate more than I did!! I planning on using this recipe as a regular dish in my home.

menuo - the recipe clearly states you add the 1/3c water then enough additional water to make a firm, pliable dough. those commenting the dough was too firm clearly didn't add enough.

This is a delicious recipe for Doubles. The Channa sauce turned out great but the Barra dough was a little tough when fried. I recommend letting the dough rise for more than 2 hours. I also think that the dough requires more than an additional 1/2 cup of water for it to blend properly.

The recipe for the dough (Bara) has got to be incorrect. There is NO WAY 1/3 cup of warm water provides enough liquid to moisten 2 cups of flour in order for it rise with yeast or even be become a dough. I don't know how the other people who reviewed this could possibly have made it following the ingredient list.

This is fantastic! I've been to Trinidad and have had doubles (the best spot is a small stand just outside of the airport). I doubled the recipie and used 1 Tablesppon of Garam Masala, 1 Tablesoon of sweet curry powder and 1 Tablespoon of hot curry powder. I have also made this without the wraps and added parboiled cauliflower to the dish with about 5 minutes left of simmer time. Excellent vegetarian dinner.

I made this dish at a dinner party last night and it was a total hit! I used the "warm cilantro dipping sauce" (also to be found on this website) as an accompaniment, which made it even better. This recipe requires a lot of ingredients and is a moderate amount of work, but after you'ver made it once you'll want to make it again. Cheers!

I used my own spice mixture for the chickpeas (a combo of madras curry and chana masala) and it was great. Served as open-face sandwiches. Be sure to double the dough recipe!
