Wow, this was awesome. I used leftover roasted lamb and red wine instead of white, skipped the pearl onions and added a package of frozen peas. Like other reviewers, I wound up adding a lot more liquid -- probably double the broth, plus moire wine. I added Worcestershire sauce, too, which really enhanced the flavor. And I added garlic to the mashed potatoes (which I doubled). Everyone loved it. This will be a new post-Easter tradition!

Loved it! I used goat instead of lamb and substituted parsnips for the turnips to make it a bit more interesting. It turned out to be an amazing dish! I'd heed the advice of others next time and increase the amount of broth and wine because mine was on the dry side at the end, and next time I might try red wine rather than white. Definitely will make this one again!

I exchanged the Pearl Onions for chopped Shallots and Red Dry wine instead of a white wine. The flavor was far richer with the changes. I also added parsley, rosemary and sage to the thyme. I chopped up the herbs that equalled around a 1/2 cup combined. This too added to a more full bodied flavor that was outstanding.

I also agree that where one might rnormally reject frozen vegetables, frozen pearl onions are much less bother and are perfect for a dish like this.

I really like Sotays comments below, as I agree that Shepherds pie is not that complicated. I loved the addition of brushing the top of the mashed potatoes with melted butter. I had not done that before.

I'm sure this is tasty but the lamb recipe seems to be overly complicated. The traditional British recipe calls for browning ground lamb (see note), adding browned chopped onions and minced garlic . To which you add beef or chicken stock. Season the meat mixture with fresh thyme, salt and pepper. Worcester sauce (one tablespoon) and tomato puree (one tablespoon) can be added too. Cook covered under low flame for 1 1/2 hours until tender and syrupy. NOTE: Form the lamb on a dinner plate into a big burger about 8 in across and 1/2 in thick. Crank up the heat in a 12 in skillet and add 3 tbs of oil. When smoking hot upend the 'burger. into the skillet. Don't touch it for 5 minutes. Then flip it for 5 more minutes. The meat really browns(instead of steaming under usual)l method) . This method adds so much flavor through caramelization that you don't need all the other veg. For the mashed spuds: brush them with melted butter before placing in the oven, the top gets brown and crunchy.

I thought this was a great recipe overall, but I found it a little sweet. I would probably reduce the amount of carrots and leeks, and completely omit the tomato paste.

We are having an unusually cold spring here in Salzburg. I am making this for guests this evening as comfort food from the dreary rain. I have braised the lamb with red wine and veggies and will add blanched carrots and peas at the very end! Also plan to add a little nutmeg to the mashed potatoes to give it an Austrian kick! It is going to be delicious!

Delicious! I followed other reviewer's recommendations and added other veggies, skipped on the turnip, and troublesome pearl onions (frozen, rather), added worcestershire, and changed the white wine for red, skipped on the beurre maine (substituted it for some brown gravy). As my own change, I substituted the tomato paste (too artificial) for natural ground seedeed tomato. Added so much nice flavor to the dish. Husband loved it! Leftovers are even nicer.

This was just fabulous. Everyone had seconds and thirds. I heeded other reviews and doubled the wine and broth before braising, and the result a perfect amount of gravy, deliciously thickened by the fast and easy buerre manié. I also added good frozen peas and onions after the braise. A perfect dish on a cold night, well worth the work.

I think this is just great. I use half the turnips, just cause I hate turnips. Also cut down some on the spuds. We have made with venison and beef, but prefer the lamb. It takes some time but it is not complicated.

Good cold weather dish. I used ground lamb, so I browned it first, added the garlic. Followed the rest of the recipe pretty much. Added corn, peas and a couple of tbls. of worsteshire sause. Covered everything and simmered on the stove for an hour. Added a little cream. Put it together and browned the potatoes under the broiler. Then melted some cheddar on top.

When I was growing up my mother always made shepherd's pie with ground beef, which I always loathed. My husband has been bothering me for years to make a shepherds pie and I would always wrinkle my nose and say "wouldn't you rather have corned beef and cabbage?" Last St. Patty's Day I finally gave in and went searching for a recipe that didn't sound as hideous as my mother's. Boy was I impressed with this one! I doubled it since we were having guests and was still heartbreakingly bereft of leftovers. Hubby said it was the best thing I ever made.

I make this dish all the time, its an all around family pleaser. I've made it full out, which isn't as hard as it reads, but typically I make a simplified version. I almost always use frozen pearl onions. I also usually use beef (chuck cubes or ground) because my husband doesn't like lamb. The lamb tastes wonderful but the beef is ok too. I omit the buerre manie at the end because it adds very little to the dish but calories. Its thick enough without it. Sometimes I only cook the stew for 40 or so minutes in the oven just to get the vegetables cooked. When I do that I can squeeze this dish in on a weeknight, but I only do that if I use ground beef since it doesn't need the long cook time to make the meat tender. However I make it, this dish is delicious. I eat very few turnips otherwise and I think they are just wonderful in this dish, so are the leeks, and pearl onions...in my opinion the meat and veggie combo are what really make this dish and if you keep those you can do a bunch of modifications and still wind up with something good. It makes great leftovers too!

I've tested this one in my search for the perfect shepherd's pie recipe and, like many other reviewers, I think this is too wordy which might put people off! My tips are: - You can use ground meat (lamb, pork, beef), but when you brown it leave it in roughly 1" chunks rather than breaking it up too much, tastes nicer that way. - Put any vegetables you like in it. I always use onion, frequently use carrots, celery, mushrooms and any bits of vegies I've got kicking round in the fridge. - Make your "gravy" any way you please. I don't do a buerre manie. I add some worcester sauce, some extra stock, even a little steak sauce to pep it up. If it needs thickening I'll stir in some cornflour before putting the spuds on. - I like to grate cheese on top of the potatoes for the total comfort food experience! - I can recommend making a big batch, assembling a few small ones in single serve casserole dishes and freezing them. Very handy if you're home alone or have kids to feed. - Enjoy! Shepherd's pie should be fun to make, tasty and filling to eat, and a meal the family can enjoy together.

Dinner guests and my family including fussy teenagers love this dish. I recommend substituting the turnips for cremini mushrooms (sliced) and baby carrots, swapp the white wine for a good red wine to add richness and made my own recipe for garlic mash potatoes as the topper. Makes a great fall/winter dish

I know. I know. It's just shepherd's pie, not Daniel Boulud or French Laundry. However, I expected a lot more. Proportions in the recipe are all wrong. Not enough meat, too much turnip. I cooked the stew the recommended 2 hours in a cast iron dutch oven, covered with parchment and a tight fitting lid, but I had little gravy at the end to thicken. Potatoes were runny. The tomato paste, white wine, root vegetables, and leek gave the sauce a sweetness that detracted. Toss this one.

I've been making this recipe since Jan 2004, about 10 times now (Dec 2005). As many reviewers suggest, the recipe can be easily modified to meet time, ingredient and personal preferences. Try using low sodium, vegetable broth. Make your mashed potatoes any way you like. Do the beurre manie if you have time. I find that the buerre adds a subtle flavor, and, if I've miscalculated on my improvisations, it can rescue the dish from a soupy mess. Also, if all you need to do is thicken the broth, don't be shy about using Gold Medal "Wondra". All in all, this is a hearty recipe that withstands any chefs alterations with aplomb.

My take on this recipe: 1. Pretty good eats, have no complaints. Remember, it's a Shepherd's Pie, not a gourmet thing. 2. Not complicated in my opinion, as some cooks suggest below. 3. Forget the time-consuming pearl onion stuff. I just used a package of frozen peas/pearl onions added at the last minute. 4. Forget the beurre manie craziness. My stew was thick enough at the end already.

Used left-over leg of lamb, parsnip and vermouth.Tossed lamb, carrots and parsnip with flour before adding to casserole but did not brown. Also added green peas.

In my opinion, this recipe was unnecessarily complicated. I subtituted frozen & defrosted pearl onions for fresh to eliminate that step. I cooked all the lamb at once instead of doing it in 2 batches, and I could not have come up with a cup of liquid at the end if my life had depended on it, so I skipped the beurre manie step too. The stew was already completely thick and rich and didn't need the extra butter. Also, it only needed 1 1/4 hours to cook through. I used parsnips instead of turnips because that's what I had and I also didn't bother to chop the thyme. Made the whole thing much easier!

I suppose if it doesn't come out of a box, lots of people *would* view this recipe as being "complicated". I for one thought this was not too hard to make, and the taste was really amazing. I'll make it again before the winter is through. It's a perfect cold-weather dish.

I thought his was fairly easy and delicious. Not being a huge lamb fan, I used half beef/half lamb, and forgot to buy the turnips. I suspect the tomato paste is unauthentic, but it's a wonderful cold weather satisfying kind of dish. Rave reviews from the whole family!

Not bad but I would agree with those who would substitute good quality seet onions for the pearl onions--the latter are too much trouble. I would definitely omit the turnips. They added nothing. Perhaps substitute mushrooms and other vegetables.

This is the best Shepherd's Pie I've made. It is NOT as complicated as it looks! Read it and you will see that the recipe is just wordy, not complicated. I love the idea of using venison, thanks.

I make this recipe with leftover roasted meat of any variety. I call it Hunter's Pie because the public school system here makes Shepherds Pie and it is an awful salty cheesy mess that the children love!

I didn't make it because it sounds unnecessarily complicated. I have my own Shephards' Pie recipe and I would love to have Janejane's one from Australia. Try using leftover,cooked lamb - it saves much time. This dish is a Godsend for people who work and want to warm up something wholesome when they come home. Especially in New York winters !! Add peas, carrots, parsnip and mushrooms !

I'm confused by all the folks who call this recipe "complicated". Good grief, all it calls for are some mashed potatoes a little braised lamb and a few vegetables. How hard is that? this is a pretty good dish even though whoever wrote up the recipe is a little too wordy. Do you really have to tell people how to mash potatoes? Try it. You'll like it better than the old hamburger and bottled sauce version found in smokey English pubs. If you really think this is complex, there's always Kraft Dinner!!!

too complex for shepherds pie. I am english & make a better recepe.

Too much garlic,and beurre manie to thicken sauce is unnecessary.Otherwise, this is a fine version for people who want a change from the ground beef dish we have been calling shepards pie for so long.Try browning the lamb with a little salt pork or pancetta with the butter.It compliments the gameyness of the lamb.

This is a truly authentic Shepherd's Pie. I often make braised lamb shanks and when I do I make a couple of extra shanks and use that lamb meat which cuts the cooking time in half for this recipe. This is essentially the recipe I have been using for years with the braised lamb. My family loves it.

I usually make this recipe using gound beef, onions, worchester sauce, and soy sauce. It almost tastes the same but my family perfered mine over this recipe. It was too complicated to be done quickly like my version.

This recipe is far, far too complex for what is essentially a very simple dish. There are dozens of recipes that will give you an excellent Shepherd's Pie in one tenth of the preparation time that this one does.

When I lived in England, I learned to make Shepard's Pie with just ground beef and mashed potatoes. You could add veggies if you wanted - but I usually serve them on the side.

I love this recipe but I simplify it quite a bit! I use regular onions instead of pearl inions and veggie crumbles in place of meat to make a great, simple vegetarian dish.
