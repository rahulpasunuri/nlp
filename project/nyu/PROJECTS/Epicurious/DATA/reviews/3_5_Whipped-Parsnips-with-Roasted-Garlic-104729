Didn't like this at all. For some reason the garlic was too bitter and did not go well with the parsnips. Definitely won't make again.

Didn't like this recipe at all, maybe because I found out I didn't like parsnips.

We love parsnips and this recipe has become a staple for us. It looks a whole lot like fluffy whipped potatoes and we tend to use it as such, with the added advantage of lower carbs. I always double the garlic (well, to be honest, I always at least double the garlic-in everything) and in this recipe I figure that the whipping cream and butter are worth it. I served eight for Christmas, quadrupled the parsnips to four pounds, and nothing was left. Make it early on serving day and re-heat in the micro, as you would for mashed potatoes. Subtle, distinctive and delicious!

If you've never tried parsnips, try this dish. Easy, delicious, and elegant.

I just "discovered" parsnips recently and have been searching for great recipes. Let me tell you, this is one of them! I made these recently with a peppercorn crusted pork loin and it was a wonderful match. Even my husband, who hates most vegetables, adored this dish. Fantastic!

This is a wonderful recipe, however, I am trying to watch calorie intake, so I did not include the heavy cream. I saved a little more than a half cup of the cooking broth and used that. I also thought a chicken broth could be substituted. Very nice, my first experience with parsnips.

This recipe is a staple for dinner parties at my home. I serve it with pan seared Swordfish with citrus sauce. The delicate flavors blend well for a truly amaizing, different side dish. The only thing is that I have to quadruple the recipe for six people.

My boyfriend and I are pretty much non-meat eaters except for the occasional fish dish, and we love trying new veggie sides to keep our diet exciting. Interestingly enough, we had never tried parsnips. Out of all the recipes, this dish seemed just perfect for grilled sowrd fish. Well, let me tell you it is a keeper! The tasty nutmeg with the textural parsnip, and smoothness of the cream and butter was great. I suggest, however, if you don't already know, to scrub the parsnips and maybe peel them down a tad and defintely cut them up before placing them in the pot to boil. Also, the 25 minutes was not long enough to make them tender. But well worth the extra weight!

This was delicious and would, I think, appeal to people who think they hate parsnips as the flavour is mild. I served it with pan seared salmon.
