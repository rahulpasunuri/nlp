I didn't exactly follow the recipe. I grated the carrots instead of blanching them, and added some lime juice, honey, mint, and basil, which made it a lot more flavorful than what this recipe describes.

Eh. That's my initial reaction to this dish. I didn't think it was all that special. It was reminiscent of cold, slightly "al dente" carrots ( a pasta term, but in this case, it fits) that were a little bit tangy -- emphasis on the 'little bit'. Also, the idea of cold carrots being lightly cooked just didn't jive with my palette.

Made this as written; cut the carrots with a knife, cooked as described. This has become a staple in my repertoire and I have hundreds of cookbooks and thousands of recipes and I cook every day because I am the best cook I know.

Made this with store bought shredded carrots, and it was super easy and good. Blanched the carrots for 4 minutes, then followed the recipe to the letter. This could just as easily be served without the fresh herbs, something like a fresh and light pickle.

I used my new mandolin to make the chopping process easier and went through two pounds of carrots with no problem. Be sure to adjust the cooking time to either more carrots or thinner slices. Also, I skipped the fresh herbs (they always go to waste in my fridge) and added fresh ginger instead. Good easy dish for a party and you can add a tiny drizzle of agave nectar or honey at the end to bring out the carrots' sweetness.
