As recommended, substituted corn for mango. Loved it. Really easy and tasty recipe.

May be made 24 hrs in advance. Place in refrigerator in strainer lined with cheese cloth - otherwise way too watery. Use english cucumbers: peel, run fork tines down the length all around, slice. I have also used baby endive leaves. Fabulous.

In preparation for serving lobster as a first course at Thanksgiving dinner, I prepared Lobster Salad with Spicy Lemon Dressing, Lobster Salad with Glass Noodles and Jicama and this recipe - all from Epicurious website. I did a taste test with my husband and two sons and "hands down" this was the best! Will be serving this at Thanksgiving on a bed of lettuce with thin sliced cucumber garnish. Great combination of sweet and spicy!

I used langostinos rather than lobster and it was very tasty & great!

I've made this recipe several times now - exactly as written with one exception. I dice a small amount of english cucumbers and add to the salad. I serve with endive leaves and corn tortillas (which are baked in the oven till crisp)- both can be used as "scoops" for the salad. This is a perfect starter for Caribbean living.

Took the advice of everyone here and changed it a little more! Used corn instead of mango, left out the jalapeno and added some cayenne pepper! I did wait until the last minute to coat it with the sauce. The first time I made it, I made it up the night before and it was a little watery.

eh.. for the cost of lobster, this recipe was so-so. Who wants to bury lobster under a bunch of mayannaise? If you do make it, make sure you sue english cucumbers. I didn't, and everything because way too watery.

I made this for my dad on father's day, as part of a 5 course meal, and this was his favorite part! I changed it a bit...instead of serving it on the cucumber rounds (too much work and way too messy), I peeled the cucumbers (threw away the skin) and then continued to peel long slivers. I stirred in a little of the dressing and then served the lobster salad in a martini glass on top of the shaved cucumber. Oh, this second time I made it I substituted Langostino for the Lobster. It would work great with crab or calamari too! It looks great, and is super easy and fast to make. And if dad likes it, that's got to say something.

Substituted fresh corn-on-the-cob for mango because the mango was jsut so sweet and would overpower the lobster - it was excellent. My store did not have seedless cukes so I used regular and also table water crackers which are very thin.

I loved this salad, on a cucumber or not! I did not have much time so I subsituted imitation lobster and it was still delicious, the jalapenos make the dish. Next time I will try the real thing.
