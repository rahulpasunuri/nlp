In my opinion the combination of Endive and Radicchio was just too bitter. I've made it as part of my Christmas dinner, and no one even bother to finish it. Plus the tartness of the lemon juice didn't help cut down the bitterness of the endive or the radicchio. If you like something bitter, this is the salad for you. If not... I suggest you skip it or perhaps substitute the endive for a tender lettuce ie; Boston lettuce.

The dish was OK served cold. I think it would be better served as a hot vegetable without the greens underneath.

This was very good--made it for Thanksgiving and everyone (even the non-Brussels sprouts fans) really liked it.

THIS IS A PLEASANT CHANGE AND PROVIDES INTERESTING COLOR TO THE MEAL. TRY ADDING CHICK PEAS.

Everyone disliked the endive, so either I bought the wrong kind, or we just don't like it. The brussels sprouts and dressing were excellent, though, and it has been requested for Christmas dinner this year, with different greens or on it's own. Very tasty.

It's almost impossible to beat the taste of browned butter on brussel sprouts, but this comes close, and seems healthier. Any recipe that can be made ahead of time earns extra credit in my book

A good dish for Thanksgiving. It's easy (preparation can be done in advance), colorful and delicious.
