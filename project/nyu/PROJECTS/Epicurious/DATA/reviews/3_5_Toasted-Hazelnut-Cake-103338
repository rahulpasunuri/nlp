I make this cake every year and get rave reviews. The "warm sweet chocolate glaze" is listed separately on epicurious, under Passover dessert recipes, April 2000).

This was absolutely great - careful not to overcook hazelnuts.

It was good, not great, a bit dry, I cooked it for the recommended amount of time at the proper temp (I have a thermometer in my oven). If I make it again, I may make an orange or Grand Mariner glaze to moisten it up before putting on the chocolate glaze.

I made the cake easily - without reading it thoroughly. Where is the chocolate glaze recipe? It seems to be missing.

Wow, this was AMAZING! Made this for first night of Passover ... good enough to be served year round. Next time I will not use orange juice in the chocolate glaze however.

I made this twice for Passover and both times it got rave reviews! I gave away 4 copies of the recipe and will use this cake for a birthday next week!

This was wonderful. I made it for Passover and everyone raved about it. Quite a departure from the canned macaroons. Then, I made it for Easter (since some people attending the dinner were still celebrating Passover)--no one even suspected it was a Passover dessert.

Made this for Passover, and it was incredibly good. If you are very careful about keeping Kosher for Passover, though, you might have some difficulty finding both Kosher margarine and chocolate! I used regular chocolate (non-Kosher due to lecithin) and substiuted hazelnut oil for the margarine.
