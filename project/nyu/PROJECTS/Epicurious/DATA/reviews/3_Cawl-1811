I think using lamb is pretty essential. Bacon adds a great flavor, but it's also good to trim and skim as much of the fat off as possible, or the stew becomes too oily. Personally I'd leave out the cabbage and add a few carrots.

I made this because my family (excluding me) likes basic "meat and potatoes" grub. No one liked it. I even added garlic, thyme and rosemary, and they still said it was bland.

I've been making this dish ever since it was first published back in 1993. Very delicious and satisfying. I look forward to making it every fall and winter.

A great traditional dish from Wales. Try substituting Neck of Lamb for the Bacon. Great for cold winter days. Serve with homemade baked bread.

My husband really enjoyed this, we served it with beer bread. Next time I won't cook it quite as long as the recipe says, though - the vegetables got a little mushy. And next time I won't add the bacon back to the pot until the very end - I prefer crunchy bacon.
