Wow! I just finished making (and eating) this, and my husband and I ate every last bite by ourselves! I added a little pepper, parsley, and garlic to the veggies, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. We found the sauce well worth the effort.

My husband and I just ate this for dinner. I disagree with the comment the sauce isn't that great... I thought it enhanced the dish brilliantly. The mix of veggies works perfectly. Just make sure you use low sodium broth so you can control how much salt you want.

I loved the vegetable mix, I was able to find a bag of baby vegetables at Whole Foods and used baby zucchini and baby carrots in the mix. I didn't feel that the sauce was worth the time to make. No one commented on it and I myself wasn't blown away by it. It also took my stock a lot longer to reduce than specified. We grilled the tenderloin steaks and served with the champ as suggested. Personally I think I would have preferred roasted garlic mashed potatoes.

This was very delicious, I assembled it on Thursday night, baked it Friday night and enjoyed leftovers over the weekend! While this wasn't my favorite (I like the Barefoot Contessa's Lasagna with Turkey Sausage), my husband said it was the best I've made yet. I will have to try it again, the preference could have something to do with using sweet italian sausage than my more preferred hot italian sausage. I prefer more sausage than ground beef, so I used 1 pound of sausage and half a pound of ground beef and I thought there was plenty of meat and cut down on the salt per other reviewers.

Absolutely unbelievably awesome! All of the other raters are so right! Because we had a party of 11, we grilled a six pound tenderloin on the grill and separately made the roasted veggies and champ (and didn't use any drippings from meat for veggie preparation). My high school nephews kept complimenting me on what a great meal it was - over and over and over.

I would make this again in a heartbeat and for a dinner party. Elegant and delicious. The vegetables make a healthy meal. I did decrease the butter with no decrease in flavor. A wonderful meal.

This was absolutely delicious and great presentation for entertaining. The champ was lovely and devoured by my friends. I just roasted all the veg together for 10 mins having browned slightly first with hand held gas thingy (can't remember name!)

Wow this dish was amazing - very easy to put together and great flavor. Love the steak w/the champs!

Company-good! I omitted the carrots and did the vegetable roasting on the grill. The reduction sauce, much better than the marchand de vin I made recently, elevates the steak to new heights. I'll use this recipe for other dishes calling for a reduction sauce. With vegetables arranged in spoke-like fashion and the steak resting on the champ, the dish looks as if it came out of a fancy restaurant kitchen. Very traditonal flavors but delicious!

Ive made it twice in 2 months. Its so delicious and a beautiful presentation. Very good for company as its pretty quick to assemble.

To answer your question, reducing stock thickens it and concentrates the flavor. Always be sure to add salt to a stock or sauce AFTER it's been reduced, otherwise it will be far to salty.

This was delicious and easy. I served with Champ and got rave reviews. One silly question, (I'm new to cooking), why reduce the stock? What purpose does that serve?

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe. And I do highly recommend pairing it with Champ as suggested - the combination was great! The only change I made was to decrease the meat portions to 4 oz each and increase the amount of veggies and it was wonderful. As past reviewers have noted, the sauce is incredible. I also found that reducing the amount of butter in it still made for a tasty sauce - I used perhaps half the amount they called for and it was fine. Much more and I would think it would taste too much like butter and not enough like the wine and stock. But overall this recipe is a keeper and one I will be making for years to come.

A big hit! I added about 2 tsp. of herbes de provence to the sauce and it really gave it a great touch. It's easy to make and a definite favorite our dinner party group. You will not be disappointed.

More like Forty forks... This was literally the best steak I have ever had. No honestly. I don't know what made it so amazing, since the sauce was just broth and wine, but I was wiping up the leftover sauce on my plate with sliced bread, I couldn't bear to leave one drop. In the supermarket, I had the choice of low-sodium beef broth or regular, and I chose regular, but it was a little too salty, so I think next time I will try low-sodium. I used white wine instead of red since I didn't have, and it actually tasted very good and different. I'll try it with red and see which is better. The most perfect steak dish, this will definitely impress.

This recipe was simply fantastic!!! I was impressed with the flavor of the sauce and the variety of vegetables. If you are even thinking about trying this recipe I highly recommend you do! You will not be disappointed.

Really, really, awesome. I too was skeptical about steak in a frying pan, but it was very good. The sauce was a great accompaniment, and the roasted vegetables were just the right touch. I used butter instead of the olive oil to fry the steaks, and creminis instead of shiitakes, as they weren't available.

AMAZING! So easy yet so full of flavor. I halved the recipe as it was just my boyfriend and I. However, we can't wait to invite friends over to make it again! A definate keeper!

LOVED IT!! Made if for 1st time company and it was wonderful without being time consuming, (once my significant other got over the fact of pan frying the tenderloin!) Completed the dish with the Champ Recipe and that was excellent too!

This dish was PHENOMENAL. Served atop Champ with the roasted spring vegetables which made a stunning presentation. I served it with Irish soda bread which was just prefect when dipped in the sauce. I can't wait to make this again!!

Awesome dish, everyone loved it. We did Bar-B-Q ed the tenderloin though...We put the fat and some of the tenderloin meat in the sauce pan to get the flavour. The champ was a winner with this recipe. We will do it again and again!!! AAA

We made this recipe with a slight variation. As barbecue lovers, we grilled the tenderlion outside while making the sauce inside. The trimmings were used to make the brownings in the pan before reducing the wine sauce. Highly recommended!!!! Vegetables were done to perfection.

Delicious! The vegetables were delicious and you must serve it with the Champ. Yum. I wish I would have put less butter in the sauce though. I stopped a few tablespoons short but it was still quite rich along with the filet and butter/cream laden potatoes. Next time I will take another reviewers' suggestion and reheat the veggies right before hand in the microwave...the last-minute timing was tricky. A beautiful and delicious meal.

A huge hit. Everyone was amazed. I fed five for lunch with the recipe for four. I thought it might be too heavy with all the butter and cream in the champ plus the red meat, but it was fine. I did stop at four pieces of butter in the sauce and with no apparent harm done to the flavour.

Great dinner maded it many times, recomend servering formally and making vegies in advance reheat in microwave. Makes serving easier One of the best on this site!

This dish takes a lot more prep time and attention than the traditional "Corned Beef & Cabbage" for St. Patrick's Day, but it's well worth the effort. The beef is delicious and tender. The spring vegetables are easy to prepare and cooked to perfection (crisp and full of flavor). The "Champ" is a must with this recipe. Absolutely the best potato recipe we've every tried!
