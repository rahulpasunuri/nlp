This one's a staple in our house. Had made it with the cilantro for years but recently substituted fresh parsley for the cilantro (for a non-fan) and actually preferred. Now we stick to the parsley.

good to use as a starter recipe. i hate heaviness of mayonnaise-based recipes but wanted to make a summer bean salad. so adapted with 1 can chickpeas, 1/2 c cilantro, 1/4 c tomato chopped (seeded), and 1/4 c cucumber chopped (seeded). a few squeezes of lime juice, salt and pepper and mesquite seasoning to taste. very good on hot summer night. would have added green or red onion if i had any in fridge. but this was good as it was.

Great. Since I was making this for a picnic on a very warm day, I substituted olive oil for the mayo, more than doubled the lime juice and added adobo sauce, also used black and kidney beans in addition to chick peas. Don't forget the salt. Everyone loved it. Will certainly make it again.

This was very good! I have to give it a 3 since I made modifications - olive oil instead of mayo, omit the pumpkin seeds, and add a touch of white wine. Yum, very fresh tasting!

Excellent! I doubled the lime juice and might triple next time. I didn't have pumpkin seeds and while I will add next time for the extra texture it was delightful nevertheless.

This is an unusual but yummy recipe and I received a number of compliments on it recently. I wanted it pretty spicy, so I combined the mayo, lime juice, cumin separately first, then added adobo sauce until it was warm enough. This also allowed me to control the liquid somewhat, because the tomaotes added juice and made the sauce a little runny. I'll be using the sauce on other bean salad recipes.

Excellent recipe and very easy. I added an extra chili and another tablespoon of lime juice. I also substituted about a quarter cup of nonfat Greek yogurt (Fage 0%). Again, very simple and good!

Very good salad. It is pretty spicy, so adjust chipotle if you can't handle the heat. Added a little olive oil and cut down slightly on mayo. Mayo sounds strange for this recipe but it work well. Omitted the pumpkin seeds because I don't like them.

This is one of my favorite recipes because it is so easy, adaptable, and a big hit with my roommates. I always use olive oil instead of mayonnaise, add extra lime juice, and chili powder to give it more spice. Adding bell peppers works really well, as well as some black olives.

Easy side dish to throw together, got even better after a day in the fridge. We didn't have the pumpkin seeds, but this was tasty even without them.

loved this quick, tasty side dish. even better when it can sit for a bit in the fridge. Added chopped red bell pepper for extra crunch, skipped the pumpkin seeds because I didn't have any around.

Used three types of beans; garbanzo, black and kidney. Omitted the mayonnaise and pumpkin seeds. Flavors better the next day.

Excellent. I added about 2 t. of the adobo sauce from the chipotles for an extra kick. Next time I would reduce the mayo. But it was really great and comes together so easy.

Great side salad to accompany a quick BBQ meal! 3x the chipotle and a little less mayo and it's perfect. Letting it sit for a few hours in the fridge helps meld the flavors as well.

fantastic lunch salad - tangy and fast - love the crunch of the pumpkin seeds. I used parsley b/c i had no cumin on hand. don't skip the chipotle chiles!

My husband surprised me with dinner this week and this was his side dish. It was delicious! I printed the recipe and saved it to make again.

I love this salad. Inadvertently bought chipotle chilies in adobo sauce, but the flavor added a smokiness that combined perfectly. To reduce fat I used 2% greek yogurt instead, with a TB of mayo. Yum. Made four salads over the weekend for a week of lunches and this disappeared by Monday.

I love this salad and my mexican friends go absolutely wild for it. It is quite tasty and very simple to prepare just add extra chipoltle and lime.

A tip: Sun of Italy brand chick peas are particularly good. Smaller and firmer than other canned brands.

made a few adjustments: chipotle tabasco, few TBS red pepper chopped, abt. 1 c corn

Quick, simple, delicious. (I used olive oil instead of mayo and finished off with toasted cumin seeds as well as toasted pumpkin seeds.)

This is so awesome. I've made it twice now and will make many more times. My husband and I just kept eating and eating it every day until it was gone. I ended up adding a bit more lime juice.

Try this with diced mangoes and fresh corn! I also substituted the mayo with plain yogurt, and sprinkled in lots of dried red pepper flakes. I served this as a side dish with a rotisserie chicken and everyone loved it!

I haven't made this recipe yet, but a friend brought it to a swim meet. It is delicious! Everyone loved it.

This recipe is a keeper -- it's delicious AND easy. While I loved the garbanzo beans, I think you could substitute any number of ingredients for an equally delicious salad -- for example, fresh corn off the cob, lots of tomatoes cut into chunks, black beans, cold leftover rice, etc., or a combination of things.

This dish is absolutely delicious - so light yet so incredibly tasty. I made it with the exact quantities the recipe called for except that I used tofu mayonaise and I crushed cumin seeds with a pestle and mortar. All the flavors work very well together - you can't go wrong. I made it for work tomorrow, but i just can't stop eating it!!! One final thing - it just screams out for some warm, freshly made chapatis (1 cup wheat flour&1 cup all purpose with 2tsp oil and 1/4 tsp salt and about 3/4 cup warm water. Mix to a dough and knead for few mins. Sit to rise for 30 mins covered. Separate into 12 balls and roll out into 6" circles. Throw on hot skillet (no oil) one by one for 30 seconds each side - or until bubbles appear!! keep covered to keep warm until all are made. Enjoy)

This is a super-quick and realy TASTY salad. It has a great texture and is a welcome change from the usual. It's also a REAL crowd-pleaser, I've been asked for this recipe more times than I can count. An bonus is that it's made from very inexpensive products!

This is my new favorite recipe - I've made 3 batches in a row now. I use low-fat mayo and the other flavors make up for it (esp. using extra chilies!). You all probably knew this but NEVER use dried cilantro if it calls for fresh. I thought I could substitute it since the market was out of fresh. Blech.

Try leaving out the mayo! I think its even better.

Yummy! I substituted 1/2 low-fat mayonnaise, 1/2 nonfat yogurt for the mayonnaise, and italian parsley for the cilantro, and it still turned out great. It was an easy, healthy lunch.

Quick and Easy! I have made it twice in a matter of days. My husband as well as our dinner guests have loved it. Chopped the chipolte chilis with the cilantro and onion on the 2nd batch and got a much better consistency.

Every time I serve this salad, people ask me for the recipe. It is really, really good and has such a unique blend of ingredients. While the instructions do not specify doing it, I scrape the seeds out of the canned peppers before chopping them and mixing them into the salad.

It was a little too spicy for me, but very good. (Though the spiciness might have been because I used reconstituted dried chipotles instead of canned; even my local fancy grocery store had no canned chipotles.)

Different and very good. As did the first reviewer, I, too, had to substitute sunflower seeds for pumpkin seeds, but that was fine. Will make again. P.S. I keep my can of chipotle chili peppers in the freezer, since so little is used at one time, and then scrape out what I need.

Fab-u-lous !! Great combination of flavors. I accidentally added too much chipotle, but my husband loved the extra zing. Definitely a keeper for the summer season.

I made this for our Christmas buffet (I know, not very holiday-ish!). While it was ok, I wouldn't make it again just because I'm not wild about any of the ingredients. The only adjustment we made was to substitute sunflower seeds for pumpkin. If you're a big garbanzo bean fan, you might give this higher ratings.
