Wow, I have no idea what went wrong. Made as written. It was impossible to work with and flavorless. Had to dump it out and start over. Martha Stewart's pate brisee or pate sucree to the rescue.

Wonderful tart crust! I've used this recipe 4 times and each time the crust turned out so tasty (a bit abstract, but I'm not a professional baker, so it didn't matter to me). Very easy to make without a food processer (I use a pastry blender). A must in every recipe box.

You needn't look any further for a tart shell recipe. This one is IT!

I'd never made a tart crust before and this turned out perfectly. Much better than whatever I put in it...

Excellent Tart Shell recipe. I have also made this with Rice Four because of food allergies and it turns out tasting much like short bread. Also excellent. However, because the rice flour doesn't have any gluten it is difficult to work with and needs much more water to bind the dough.

I thought this was a great crust. Flaky and light because of the mixture of butter and shortening.

This crust is fabulous -- very buttery and flaky. While it's a bit difficult to work with, it's definitely worth the trouble. Suggestions: 1) Don't overwork the dough; you should see little blobs of butter as you're rolling it out. 2) Roll it out between sheets of saran wrap and if it starts to soften and stick, put it in the fridge for 10 or 15 minutes to firm up again. I used this for the Pear & Hazelnut Frangipane Tart and even when the tart was a couple of days old, the crust stayed flaky and very crispy.
