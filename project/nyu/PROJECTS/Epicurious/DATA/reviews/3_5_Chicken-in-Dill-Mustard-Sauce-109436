Very very tasty! The variation I tried, from others reviews was 1/4c white wine & 1/4 white wine vinegar, 1/4 c milk at the end. Definitely be making this for company.

Based on other reviews, I added a tiny bit of cream to the sauce. Absolutely perfect.

Great, easy and fast. I used skinless chicken and green onions instead of shallots that I didn't have, next time I will cut down on the wine since it came out a bit acid so i added some cream, everyone lovedit and will make it again

Made this last night to great success. Followed the last reviewers advice for White Wine Vinegar and loved it but would water it down slightly.I reduced the sauce a bit longer than suggested to make it thick like gravy and delicious! The dill seemed a bit lost in this recipe but I definitely enjoyed it and will be making again.

I am a big fan of dill with chicken, so this was a winner for me right off the bat. I did make somas substitutions, however: Instead of whole, bone-in chicken, I used boneless whole breasts... Just don't cook it as long and it still turns out great. Also, try using white wine vinegar to deglaze the pan instead of white wine... It adds a nice little bite that goes well with the dill.

What a delicious dinner! Some other people mentioned to reduce the salt - this is a good idea! I would reduce by half of what the recipe calls for. Also try adding some cream at the end. Yum yum

I'm a foodie in college, on a budget. This recipe was easy, made enough for a couple days worth of meals, and was DELICIOUS. Loved the combo of the dill and the mustard, paired with chicken. Instead of chicken legs, I substituted thighs. I scored dill at a local farmers market, which made the whole dish fresh! I'd make it again in a heartbeat!

This was really good. I used chicken thighs only. the only thing is i thought it was very greasy, but sure tasted good!

Good, but not great. Strong mustard flavor overtakes the dill. I like both flavors, but not sure I'm crazy about them together.

my husband and i liked this very much. we used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and my homemade mustard. lots of great flavor with the dill. we will definitely be making this again.

Great weeknight recipe. Used skinless/boneless chicken thighs. I added the salt and pepper directly on the chicken before dredging as this allowed me to spice the meat to taste. Did not have shallots so used some green onions and yellow onion. Added some garlic and 1 extra tablespoon of dijon mustard. I also browned the chicken in butter and olive oil and did not bother reducing the sauce as it had a nice consistnecy because of the added butter. Result was a pleasant sauce and extremely tender chicken. I served with rice. I will make this often!

This is a great last minute dish that has lots of flavor and freshness. It is well liked by adults and kids. Compliment it with asparagus and brown rice - very good!

A really solid recipe - it stood up to a ton of changes when I made it - like using red wine instead of white, because I had a bottle open and didn't want it to go to waste. (I used about 1/4 cup so as not to overwhelm the other flavours.) I also cooked the shallots in all the chicken fat (for more flavour) and , taking other reviewers' suggestions, used only 1/4 cup dill but 5 tsp mustard. Instead of adding butter to the sauce at the end, I added a dollop of creme fraiche. The result was tender chicken in a tasty, creamy sauce - great weeknight dinner.

I enjoyed this dish. A nice afterwork dinner made with easily available ingredients. Made it strictly with chicken leg and not leg/thigh combination which I think the recipe calls for (couldn't understand how 4 chicken legs could weigh 2 lbs total when my package of 7 legs only, weighed about 1 and 3/4 lbs, until I saw other reviews) The only other thing I did was add more than 2 tsp of mustard (dijon). More like 2 tbs. worth

Pretty easy and tasty. I used dijon mustard instead and went easy on the dill. My boyfriend loved it!

Bland, too much dill. Will not make again.

I loved this recipe. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead. The second time I made it I doubled the mustard, used extra wine and I added some flaked nutritional yeast (a high protein health-food product). This thickened the sauce slightly while adding a very subtle cheesy flavour. I also found the sauce tastier after letting it sit overnight in the fridge.

I used bone-in chicken breasts, added granulated garlic and cumin to the dredge and deglazed with vermouth...very nice.

I love the fresh taste of dill in this dish. I did make a modification. I used boneless, skinless chicken breast. I browned them in the skillet, removed them, made the sauce, and then added the breasts back in just to warm them up. Very tasty. And the sauce was great over roasted potatoes too.

I used Dijon mustard because that was all that I had, and it turned out really good. Another easy, delicious dish from epicurious.com!

Pretty ordinary, and I followed the recipe exactly. It was good, just not especially flavorable. The family was so-so about it.

This dish has quickly become a family favorite. We all prefer white meat so if you use breasts w/bone in you need to boil quite a bit before putting in the pan. It also works really well with boneless skinless thin breasts

Made it for my boyfriend and his roommate and they both loved it. He requested boneless chicken and I'm glad he did. Cut down on the cooking time. I made it w/ herb potatos and a veggie. Came very nice and the left overs were just as good :-)

Delicious! I used brined chicken breasts instead of legs. Fast and easy.

I thought this was easy to make and very tasty! The recipe calls for low sodium chicken broth--I wish I'd heeded this, the dish was a little too salty, but other than that, tasty and tender!

Had a sweet white wine, so I added some wine vinegar-excellent decision. I also made 2 versions as I had 9 chicken thigh-leg pieces. One was without dill and the other was with dill. Both were very nice. I found the cooking times were longer than recommended. All in all a good recipe. Served it with stewed okra and the okra was a nice complement.

What did I do wrong? I thought it was a bit bland. I might try it again w/ a bit more mustard for some kick.

This dish is yummy and easy to make. I've made it twice and it's a hit with my boyfriend. I have added this to my repertoire of fast/easy/yummy dishes to make on a regular basis. I would not, however, make this for guests, it's too messy to eat.

Very good, not difficult. I didn't have any shallots, used chopped red onion, and I skinned the chicken to make it more healthy. Came out great. I will make it again.

Followed the directions for the sauce only - used veggie broth in place of chicken - then served over veggie 'chikn' - really, really good! Also, added a tablespoon of butter at the end with the dill - thought that it mellowed the acidity a bit. This one is going into the rotation!

Very easy to make, and delicious! I consider this comfort food . . . felt very good going down the hatch! The sauce was wonderful. This recipe's a keeper!

What did I do wrong?? I left the chicken to simmer and when I came back 10 min later the sauce had hardened and stuck to the bottom of the pan! I ended up making a quick reduction in a separate pan with the leftover liquids and dill on hand, but wished I had been able to experience the real sauce. Still, very flavorful. I'll try again.

Very easy and great flavor for a weeknight dish.
