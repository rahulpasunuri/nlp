Unfortunately, these just didn't impress. Something is wrong when my 4-year old and 1-and-a-half-year old, who both love nori rolls, leave the table with some still left on the platter. I think it might have been a texture thing with the potato filling, since we are so used to rice. But I also wonder if the smoked salmon and curry flavors just didn't go together. Since these were a lot more work than my simple rice-filled nori rolls, I think I'll stick with those. (Might try putting smoked salmon in those though.)

Served these side-by-side with a more traditional smoked salmon sushi roll. We watched the traditional rolls disappear, while these were ignored. We found them to be soggy and bland, with the potatoes overwhelming the salmon. In addition, these took more time to prepare than the others.
