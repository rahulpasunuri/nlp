The other reviewer is correct: this recipe does not appear in the January 2007 issue of Bon Appetit. Perhaps it's in Gourmet? Epi, can you please update with the correct reference? (We know you're out there...)

This recipe was a real disappointment. I used high-quality ingredients and followed the instructions as written with only two modifications: 1) used dried rosemary instead of fresh and 2) purchased fresh pasta sheets at a local specialty store. The recipe turned out to be extremely bland. It was edible but not enjoyable at all and I consider it to be a waste of perfectly good ingredients. I looked up Mario Badali's agnolotti recipe online and by comparison his calls for garlic, more spinach, eggs and lots more cheese in the filling. I'll try that recipe next time.

This is a wonderful meal and beautiful enough to serve to guests. It is time consuming though, so be prepared. To speed up the prep time I used wonton wrappers to make the agnolotti instead of making dough from scratch.

Maybe I'm missing something, but this recipe is not in my copy of the 2007 issue of Bon Appetit. I was hoping to find a photo, but it's not listed under pasta or meat.

Excellent! I'm sure the kosher recipe was just as delicious. Perhaps the other reviewers did not understand the term "non dairy".

What is your problem ~ cook from Mass? Do you have any idea what "Kosher" means? Obviously not... You CAN'T mix dairy AND meat in the same dish! Are you still lauging now? You're just rude..

I changed it to adapt to Kosher, I used the back part of a beef tongue, I used margarine and non dairy cheese. Came out wonderful. Once i served with a tomato sauce and once with a mushroom sauce, my secret recipe. Excellent reviews from my eaters.
