Fabulous palate cleanser! Especially appropriate with fish menu. I just served everyone a quenelle in a soup spoon. The tomato granita on this site is equally great.

A perfect palate cleanser - it cut the richness of my first course without interfering with the flavors of the rest of the dinner or the wines. Just lovely and fresh.

I'm from New York and just learned it's a Scandinavian liquor. There are several recipes on this website that call for it and it's not something new!
