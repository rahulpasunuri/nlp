This is the best lemon cake recipe I have found so far. I learned that when a recipe calls for a few tablespoons of lemon zest, the flavor will be poor. 1/4 cup of zest seems to be just the right amount. This cake freezes very well, which is a good thing because if it didn't my husband and I would have to eat the whole thing at once. I followed the recipe exactly as written.

I make this for 4th of July every year in a 13x9 pan. Frost with whipped cream and make a flag design with strawberries and blueberries. Light and delicious!

Blech! What a total, utter waste of 3 (yes, 3)sticks butter, 6 (yes, 6) eggs and 3 cups of lovely blueberries. The list of ingredients should have been a warning sign. Gloppy, gooey, and so NOT light or pound-cakey.

This has become a HUGE favorite in our house. I use three good sized lemons and use whatever zest and juice I get -- this usually takes the recipe up by half on zest and doubles the lemon juice (and adjust the sugar for the syrup accordingly). I also use lemon extract instead of vanilla and generally use either half-and-half or buttermilk instead of regular milk -- both are great. This cake is moist and full of flavor. I agree it isn't as dense as some pound cakes, but we love it.

Read the reviews before I made the cake. Followed the recipe exactly. The cake was just sweet enough for me. I definitely tasted the lemon. If you do not use the syrup, it may not be as lemony or moist. If you want it less lemony, I would just use the syrup minus the lemon. The texture was a dense pound cake, don't over cook it or it will become crumbly. Mine took exactly an hour. I will make this cake again, without the lemon in the syrup.

Just happened to have fresh blueberries from the farmers market. When I typed in Lemon Pound cake on my web search this afternoon this recipe came up. It was easy to make and the results were luscious. The perfect pound cake with blueberries and great lemon flavor.

Easy to make and loved the result! Not too sweet. Made lemon cream cheese frosting to got with it...YUM.

What a disappointment! This was a bland (although moist) blueberry muffin rather than a lemon pound cake. I followed the recipe exactly. The consistency was muffin not pound cake and the lemon flavor didn't come through at all. Further, I wouldn't even make this again as a blueberry muffin as it didn't have flavor.

I've been using this recipe for nearly two decades, and it is still my all-time favorite cake. Lemon and blueberry aside, this is a traditional pound cake (equal amounts by weight of flour, butter, sugar and eggs). So no, it isn't light and fluffy. And no, it isn't incredibly rich or overly sweet. It is perfect. Fresh lemon juice and zest are a must. Don't know about wild Maine blueberries, but it tastes great with the big fat ones that grow here in Mississippi. I've made it with frozen berries plenty of times (don't thaw them). I do agree with the last reviewer who says too much vanilla--two teaspoons is plenty for my taste. If I need to dress it up, I serve it with lemon curd and fresh berries.

I made this recipe exact and found it in error. The amount of vanilla should be 1.5 TEAspoon instaed of 1.5 tablespoon. For a fabulous pound cake goto Aunt Rose's Pound Cake on this site. For muffins this would work nicely (not to die for, but ok) using one and half cup raspberries, 1 cup butter, baked at 325 degrees for 36- 38 minutes.

This cake was wonderful! I also used frozen berries. Added extra lemon peel and some chopped rosemary. I especially liked it because it was not too sweet.

This pound cake is delicious! I used frozen blueberries and it turned out amazing. The only thing I changed was to make the glaze with lemon juice and powdered sugar and drizzle it over the top once the cake is finished.

Agree with reviewer who said it is a bit bland, despite all the lemon peel. One slightly unusual suggestion: add fresh rosemary to give it some zing.

This pound cake was easy and really tasted good. Very mild flavor and it was perfect for strawberries and whipped cream. I didn't have cake flour and just used a little less regular flour. It was fine. Next time, I will make a nice tart lemon glaze to give the cake a bit of zip.

I really liked this recipe. I used the Wyman blueberries and just folded them in. Next time, I will fold them in frozen instead of thawed to prevent blueberry juice bleed. It also keeps fresh for days because it's so moist.

Tasty, and got lots of compliments. The sweet, lemon-y glaze was a good touch. But this didn't turn out as rich and buttery as I genernally expect pound cake to be.

I made this for work and found it was heavy, and the 1 1/2 Tablespoons of vanilla to be overpowering. Definitely a recipe for the not worth the trouble pile.

This cake came out very good. If you're looking for a heavy desert tasting cake though, this is not it. It's almost like having a really, really good blueberry muffin. It would be good for a brunch or light luncheon. I substituted lemon oil for the grated peel since I was feeling lazy about grating and it really infused it with a nice flavor. I would also recommenf cutting down the blueberries to 2 cups as someone else suggested and just fold them in with the batter at one time.

This cake is deliciously dense, but not heavy. I made mine by adding cranberries, not blueberries and topped it with a cream cheese, lemon frosting. The cranberries add an extra element of zing. This will become one of my favorites.

I cut the recipe by half since I didn't have a 10" bundt pan and thought I'd try using a bread pan instead. I used 150g unsalted butter with 55g granulated sugar + 65g brown sugar. I also reduced the blueberries to 1 cup (about 150g, frozen). The cake turned out very greasy and too dense. I had to use paper towels to absorb the extra grease around the cake. The amount of sugar was just fine - I prefer desserts that are not so sweet. Not sure if I'd make this again - I was hoping to get a more fluffy texture.

It is so rewarding to find a recipe that works. Had a freezer full of hand-picked local blueberries, a refrigerator packed with way too many lemons, and a co-worker's birthday coming up. In the heart of winter it is extra special to eat a cake that reminds you of all that is good in summer. The cake is rich, not too sweet and well balanced with lemons and blueberries. It is very moist (almost pudding like) which I attribute to the addition of the lemon syrup. Don't hesitate - get baking.

Either the lemon cake and glaze or the blueberries would be showstoppers. The two together make for a heavenly treat, even if it is slight overkill. This was a huge hit with my coworkers. It makes a big difference what type of blueberries you use. Maine wild blueberries are the best, ideally Wyman's. The smaller the better. Even frozen wild berries outshine the fresh big ones. Don't worry though - no matter which blueberries you use, this recipe makes a cake you can be proud of.

I made the cake with fresh RASPBERRIES for a brunch. I made it with hand-picked California BLACKBERRIES for a local wedding -- also local lemons. And used lemon cream-cheese frosting with white-chocolate curles. The only way that this cake is REALLY NOT GOOD is with BLUEBERRIES. They are too sweet and make the cake cloying. I'm making it again tomorrow in two round pans and then cutting it to form a SHARK for my five-year-old's birthday -- made with raspberries. I LOVE THIS CAKE! Just not with blueberries.

I made this cake for an office birthday and it was fabulous. Everyone raved about it, even the diehard chocoholics loved it. Very buttery and rich with a lovely lemon freshness. I used frozen blueberries and they worked great. The only thing that was less than perfect was a major crack. It didn't make the best first impression, but that may have been my fault, I used a ring pan rather than a bundt pan.

This is a good recipe for those who do not like their desserts too sweet. Good buttery taste and sauce is nice and tart, though does not add to sweetness.

This recipe makes a bland blueberry muffin type cake. Nothing at all like the rich pound cake I wanted. I subsituted lime for the lemon in the glaze and it tasted great and complimented the blueberries just as well. I won't use this recipe again but if I did I'd use it to make muffins and add more sugar and vanilla.

Great way to use blueberries; and lemon and blueberry is a classic flavor combination. Husband and coworkers really enjoyed it. Next time, think I'll try a confectioner's sugar/lemon glaze to top off the cake, and make less of the syrup. Excellent recipe.

Oh my was the delicious. I made this for a family get-together and everyone loved it. I stuck this recipe in my files and will definitely make it again. I am not sure if I am the only one that had a good bit of the syrup for the topping left over... I slathered it on very generously but still was left with a good amount, so I just did not use it and cut down on the recipe the next time and it turned out fine. The lemony flavor is delightful!

I had a lot of blueberries and found this recipe. We have many "unexpected friends and family" ( adults kids popping in unexpectedly) and wanted to have something a little sweet on hand. This recipe is wonderful: full of flavor (why did one previous reviewer think it was bland?? Maybe she didn't use fresh berries or lemons)and makes a lot... I have just frozen half of the cake for last minute guests. Follow the recipe to a "T". I will make it again.

I was perplexed when I read the reviews claiming that this cake had no taste. I find it hard to imagine anyone taking this recipe and turning out a blah cake. This cake is delicious, tart from the lemon syrup and blueberries, sweet and buttery and just plain good. I would make it again in a heartbeat except for the obscene amount of butter called for. I cut it down to two sticks and substituted a half cup of olive oil, and it was wonderful.

Everyone at work loved this recipe. It was moist, dense, and the lemon component was not too sweet. I used fresh lemons and blueberries at their peak. For those wanting a real "sweet" this might not be to their taste. Next time I will use just slightly fewer blueberries as the quantity called for caused some unavoidable pockets of too many together. This is an attractive cake as well.

BLA! I was expecting this to be so good after reading the reviews, but boy was I disappointed. I brought it to work (which I don't usually do until I've tried the recipe first) but figured I was safe since everyone raved about it. It certainly was moist but not much taste. I won't make this again (there are plenty of other much better blueberry recipes).

Moist and dense, like a poundcake should be without being greasy. Blueberries were just about right, but not especially lemony. Maybe because I used bottled lemon juice. Still pretty good though.

This recipe sounded great, but I was very disappointed. Was very moist, but TASTELESS! I sprinkled powdered sugar on top which helped a bit. Someone mentioned adding almond extract, but not too sure how that would taste with the blueberries. Also I would cut down the blueberries to 2 cups.
