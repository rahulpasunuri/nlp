This has been a hit every time I've made it. It's a light, refreshing finish to a barbecue. I've used whatever fruit is in season and have also substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream.

Easy to make for summer time entertaining. I added candied ginger chips to the creme for a little extra... Delicious!

A light alternative to plain fruit and super easy to make. I used it with assorted berries that were very ripe. Maybe that makes a difference. I also used fat free sour cream and didn't feel that the taste suffered.

In one word - yuck. I was extremely disappointed with the honey cream. It was a little too sour and did not compliment the fruit (I used assorted berries) well. My husband thought it was ok but I am never making this dish again.

Very refreshing!! It is super simple to make but tastes great. I've made it for summer cookouts for family-get-togethers and it was a hit every time.
