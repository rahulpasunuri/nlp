i have made this recipe for years and it is always a hit - i also use the crust for a fresh fruit tart with pastry cream - put jam on top of crust before the pastry cream - have made bday tarts with strawberries and age in blueberries - a real winner!

Loved the recipe! The very sturdy crust is what makes this suitable for a picnic. However when making this to eat at home I adapted the sweet pastry crust from Blueberry Tart (7/95) using the whole recipe for the crust and pressing it into a 9" tart pan with a removable bottom. Then continuing with the recipe. I look forward to making this every summer.

I'm not sure what the cook from Philadelphia made, but it could not have been this recipe. I've made this a dozen times since it was first published, and each time it's a certified hit. I find the cornmeal is what makes the difference between ordinary, been-there-done-that lemon bars, and these spectacular creations. Bravo, Gourmet!

This was so delicious. I made it for a block party and it was gone in about 10 minutes--everyone complained that I'd made only one! I would definitely make it again, and I would recommend it. It's relatively easy and the contrast in taste and texture between the crust and filling was wonderful.

Yuck! I was embarrassed to serve these and after one bite they went straight in the garbage. The cornmeal flavor and texture totally overwhelmed the custard, and the whole thing was pretty ugly to boot. Next time I will stick with classic lemon bars.

I love this recipe. I made it two years ago for a summer bbq and it was a sure winner. My advice is to use a very good apricot preserve, or even better yet, make your own. A good jam/preserve can compliment the blueberries. And make sure that the apricot jam is not too sour, that can detract from the natural sweetness of the blueberries. Bon appetit!!

Not the best lemon square recipe I have tasted...it just wasnst LEMONEY enough! But, I really like the texture of the crust!

I wasn't sure I'd enjoy this dessert after reading negative comments about the crust, but I liked the different taste and the crunchy texture. My problem with the crust was getting it to spread in the pan. As it softened, it became difficult to spread, stuck to my fingers, and was difficult to work into the corners of the pan. Consequently the corner pieces were mostly crust and little filling. I think next time I'll either work more quickly or freeze my hands, push the crust almost to the rim of the baking pan, and increase the amount of filling to come almost to the top. I did add extra zest and even a little extra lemon-lime juice. Only other problem was getting it out of the pan. Since the pan was buttered, then refrigerated, the foil stuck to the bottom. I simply put in on stove top for 30 seconds to melt butter, then it was easily removed. Good flavor, guests liked it.

Quite good, but not perfect. Switched the flour:cornmeal ratio (used 3/4 flour, 1/2 c cornmeal), and that helped the crust. Raised the zest by about 50%, but could still use a zippier taste to the custard. But, it is a very good summer dessert, and SUPER easy. Still prefer the recipe for the nectarine/lime curd tart with the brown sugar crust - now THAT is DELICIOUS!

This was a huge hit at work and disappeared very quickly. One co-worker said I had really outdone myself this time. Little do they know that this is really easy to make. The cornmeal is a bit different but I like it a lot. Personal preferrence I guess.

This is a quite lovely summer dessert. Very tasty. The foil layer is an interesting way of getting it out of the pan neatly. We are big cornmeal fans, so the crunchy crust is a nice bonus

Needed alot more lemon for my taste buds. Husband loved it so I will make it for him, MAYBE! Not nuts about the cornmeal crust either!

Everytime I make this our guests always want seconds. The lemon/lime combination is very refreshing & adds a delicious contrast to the bluberries.

I got great reviews from my coworkers! The crisp texture of the bottom was a good contrast to the soft center.

I brought this to a pot luck and it was a big hit. However, I was a little disppointed with the crust-to-filling ratio- the coarse cornmeal crust needs more silky contrast. In the future I'll follow the advice of earlier reviewers to increase the filling by 1/2. Really pretty and yummy, though.

An absolute delight! I served at a tea party and my girlfriends all asked for the recipe. Also, my husband who is not a big desert person liked it and asked when was I going to have another tea party:))

Delicious! Have made this now several times. Like other reviewers, I increased the custard by half. Also have substituted raspberries for blueberries -- beautiful presentation.

I too made the mistake of using stone-ground cornmeal - the crust tasted like corn flavoured ground glass. Nevertheless, I think the use of an ordinary shortbread crust would be terrific. I'm reluctant to try it with regular cornmeal in case it is only marginally better.

THIS WAS GOOD. I USED FROZEN BLUEBERRIES WHICH I THINK WAS A MISTAKE. IT MADE THE TOPPING RUNNY. I WOULD LIKE TO TRY WITH FRESH STRAWBERRIES NEXT TIME.

Easy to make and got some compliments. I used coarse corn meal which made the crust a bit too hard, so use a finer corn meal.

I made this to take to a four-year old's birthday party-- both the kids and adults raved. I'd prefer the filling (which set in less time than the recipe stated it would) to be slightly more tart, so I may increase the juices ever so slightly next time. The blueberries and the cornmeal crust are what set these squares apart from other more ordinary recipes. Yum!

I will make this dish again because my son polished off the entire plate. The crust was delicious by itself. The lemon/lime taste was refreshing. Strawberries tasted better than the blueberries which kept falling off. However, the pieces parts just didn't go together for me.

After reviewing more than 100 blueberry receipes, I decided to use this one as my entry into the Mason's Island Blueberry Bakeoff. Despite stiff competition - my "Blueberry Bar Surprise" was the winner! I followed the receipe to the letter for the crust and filling, then I simmered about 1/3 of the blueberries in 2 tablespoons of apricot brandy for 5 minutes. I put the simmered blueberries on top of the baked filling (about 1 layer of blueberries) and then put the uncooked blueberries (mixed with the apricot jam and another 2 tablespoons of brady) on top of that. After chilling it 10 hours I let the bars warm up to room temp. I also followed some of the other reader's advice and garnished the top with powdered sugar. A few sprigs of mint on the plate between the bars made it a pleasing presentation.

loved this dish. Have made it several times and finally have it just exactly the way we like it. I use generous amts. of the zests and increase the custard by half. Used apricot jam the first two times and then tried Smuckers apricot spread. Just heat up, strain and then reduce a little. Its less sweet than the jam and you can taste the blueberries better. I don't have any berries that fall off. makes about 16 squares. Great recipe!! thanks.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out beautifully. Great lemon flavor and the blueberries were very pretty on top. Cornmeal crust was an interesting variation. I served them along with my best fudge brownie recipe to guests after dinner. Everyone tried both remarking on how beautiful the blueberry lemon squares were. The brownies were completely finished off but there were half of the lemon squares left. Maybe we're all chocoholics. The kids didn't like how the blueberries fell off when they ate them.

I was drawn to this recipe by all the positive reviews...and was not disappointed! This is a nice variation on regular lemon squares; it also makes for a very pretty presentation.

We spent hours picking wild blueberries in Northern Ontario (really north), so wanted to make something special......these squares were excellent.....I'm normally not a dessert person, but I do have a weakness for lemon/lime.....this recipe was EASY to make, EASY to clean up and tasted deeeelicious - rave reviews from family (who I bake for usually)

I made this in place of a birthday cake for an adult. It was a huge hit! The crust was very buttery and fragrant, with just the right crunch from the cornmeal. The whole recipe was very simple. I'm going to try it again with strawberries next time. It was delicious.

Wow! These are AMAZING!! They're refreshing and great for the summer. My crust did not fall at all, probably because I used 2 Tbsp less butter. Didn't have whole milk, so I used skim milk, it still turned out fabulous!

I made this for my office, and it was a huge hit... if you want to make it pretty - sprinkle some sifted icing sugar over the top, and garnish with a mint sprig... take care when pressing the crust, and it will fall slightly upon baking, but press it back into shape with a spoon... do not cheat on the zest, and juices - make sure you use fresh!!!! I did not find apricot jam, but I did find preserves, and I pureed the whole pieces of apricot for a smoother texture... This is pretty much no fail, if you take your time, and handle the finished product with care...

I was looking for a change from the basic lemon square and this worked wonderfully. I tripled the recipe and baked in a 12"x17"x1" pan covered in heavy foil. Cut squares with a pizza cutter. The crust is distinctive and the blueberries make it visually attractive. But my blueberries kept rolling off, maybe I'll use more jam next time.

Fantastic! I didn't have a glass pan, didn't seem to make a difference. Will definitely make again.

These are absolutely divine! The crisp cornmeal crust, combined with the tangy custard and blueberries, is inspired. Plus, they look great -the jam makes the blueberries glisten. Easy to make, delicious - what more could you ask for?
