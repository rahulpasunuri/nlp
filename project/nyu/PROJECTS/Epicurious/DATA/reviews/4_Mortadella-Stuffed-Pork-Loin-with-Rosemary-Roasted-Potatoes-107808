This was fantastic! I used bologna (from the butcher, not the Oscar Mayer variety!) due to a nut allergy and the pistachios in traditional mortadella, and it turned out perfect! I had the butcher butterfly the roast so I could skip that step at home. Next time I'll try it with prosciutto as that sounds like a delicious recommendation from other reviewers!

I did not used the truffled butter, the roast turned out very good. It was my first time I made a perfect roas.t

Fantastic recipe- with a few modifications. The prosciutto worked fantastic. I also sauteed mushrooms and then chopped them in a food processor, added parmesian cheese and rosemary- making a mushroom paste. It was easier to roll the pork loin by using a mushroom paste. The hardest part was cutting the meat in a spiral. I also cooked it until it registered 150 degrees. I was placing the pork in chaffing dishes and i didnt want it to dry out. Excellent taste and fantastic presentation.

Wonderful! Made this as the main course for Christmas dinner. Stuffed with prociutto, shitakis, truffle butter and spinach. So delicious! Followed the timing and temps to the recipe. Pork needed a bit more time, but was still moist; potatoes were excellent!

I used prosciutto instead of mortadella as other reviewers suggested. To add a layer of flavor I put sliced fontina and several green onions in the stuffing. (Next time I will try spinach.) I also put some minced garlic and fresh rosemary in the center of the pork because I feared it would lack flavor. It turned out really yummy!

Served this to my son who is a chef. Did as one reviewer suggested with shitake mushrooms and spinach. Sauce was wonderful as I added apple brandy. Served with spagetti squash and chipollini onions which I surrounded pork with while cooking. Fantastic presentation.

I have made this twice because the first time my guests were wowed and begged me to make it again for new years dinner! Based on other reviews, I modified with the following changes: used prosciutto instead of mortadella used less peppercorns on top, but added more garlic and butter. added fresh spinach and fresh slices of shitake mushrooms to the center. and mixed truffle oil in butter instead of buying truffle butter. last thing i changed was i used whole small red potatoes tossed in olive oil, a little salt, pepper and the rosemary. I just tossed them along the sides of the roast in a large roasting pan and let them steam with the meat. they came out perfectly cooked at the same time the meat is done.

Made this over Thanksgiving. BBQ'd over hard wood coals and it came out great...very moist. Also made my own truffle butter with truffle oil. Can't wait to try it again.

I've made this twice and both times I found it to be underwhelming. It's an easy recipe with about 10-15 mins of prep, but it really needs something to moisten and brighten up the overall dish. Perhaps using spinach or mushrooms as some others did.

I made this for a Christmas party dinner and it was AMAZING. Like others I could not find truffle butter so I mixed truffle oil and minced shitake to good quality butter and let sit for several days. The mortadella was mild and yummy. I also added the spinach, which made for a nice presentation. It tool a little longer than the recipe said, but my roast was 5 pounds (just over 2 hours). It wasn't that difficult or time consuming. I'll be making this again!!!! Oh, and the potatoes were FANTASTIC!!!!

This roast and the rosemary potatoes were excellent and easy to prepare. I also used prosciutto and spinach as suggested by others. I served with asparagus and started with an apple walnut salad. The meal was a hit.

This recipe is excellent, my husband my friend and I really rave about it. I also used spinach and proscuitto. I had to admit that I did not found black truffle, but I did use other popular fancy kind of mushroom and taste was excellent.

I made this dish for myself and a friend who was visiting town this past Thanksgiving. The time to cook the pork loin was at least two hours, but the end result was well worth the wait. The pepper butter can be a little too strong/salty/spicy for those used to bland cafeteria-type food. I also used prosciutto and spinach to add some color to this meal. The rosemary potatoes were delicious when tossed and baked with some of the truffle butter and grease from the pork loin. I bought fresh bread from the bakery for the left over truffle butter(truffle oil and unsalted butter) and we were all set. The cooking time is the only discouraging part of this recipe, but overall it's a great dish to make on occasion!!

Rating: 4
A VERY impressive meal. Like other reviewers, I substituted prosciutto and fresh spinach for the mortadella. I think the spinach kept the cut spirals from holding together as well as the mortadella would have, but it was visually more appealing. Black Truffle Oil can be found at Whole Foods; neither my local supermarket nor Williams Sonoma had it. I used "B" sized red potatoes with the skin on and they came out great. I skipped the sauce.

Great recipe! Never butterflied a pork loin before. I'm sure going to again! A bit of work, but not bad, thinking about serving to my gourmet group. The filling was great but could be played with a bit to make even better. The directions for cooking were great. The result was a perfectly done roast that received rave reviews.

This was SO GOOD. I made it for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it, going back for seconds and thirds. I had to make my own truffle butter (just softened butter and combined it with black truffle oil), and sub'ed proscuitto for mortadela, and added some spinach leaves. Otherwise stuck to the recipe. I had my butcher at Whole Foods butterfly the roast, which was a much easier. I would absolutely make this again for a special occasion. You really must try it.

We loved this. I was quite proud of myself for butterflying the pork on my own. The directions seem intimidateing, but it was actually easy. I used procuitto instead of mortadella. I will make again.

Loved it and so did my dinner guests! Didn't know that mortadella was somewhat like baloney. Interesting. Added some fresh spinach leaves (two layers between the mortadella) and roasted red pepper strips (jarred in brine, dried out between paper towels). Looked nice and festive, just in time for Christmas. Rolled it up the day before and it was perfect. A little time-consuming but my dear friends are worth it!

I made this for a friend as a trial run for my New Year's' Day guests. I used a 2-lb loin and halved the rest of the ingredients. It is wonderful with the mortadella. I think with pancetta the subtlety would be lost. I made my own truffle butter by adding truffle oil to unsalted butter, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly. I'd quibble a bit with the instructions: first, they'd lead one to believe that the pork roast will be round, when in fact it is a rather flat piece; second, they make the butterflying sound far more difficult than it is. I made the butter and the rub ahead of time, so the preparation was very quick. I found the roasting time a bit long, but my roast was smaller. Be careful not to rub the rub into the ends of the roast as too much pepper gets caught in the nooks and crannies. All in all, a wonderful recipe. I'd like to give it four stars, but "beyond compare" is a bit over the top... Will definitely make again for my New Year's Day guests

I made this dish for a dinner party last night and everyone raved about it. It's a great change from lamb and beef, and was very flavorful and moist. I made a few changes, however. I used pancetta as it was available and mortadella was not. Like another reviewer, I added shitake mushrooms to the stuffing (and some rosemary)for color and texture, which really helped with presentation and flavor. I also used LOADS of truffle cream and oil (I ADORE truffles), but their subtle flavor was completely masked by the intensity of the pancetta and the garlic pepper butter. When I make this dish again (and I definitely will) I will save my money and use an herb butter instead. Finally, a word on the potatoes. I didn't have the appropriate roasting pan for this recipe, so I simply added some of the extra pork fat trimmings to the potato pan and later added some of the juice/grease from the pork loin when I removed it from the oven to rest. Delicious! I think the crispy potatoes were everyone's favorite of the meal!

This is pretty special, but not beyond compare. Although I like pepper I will cut back the next time. Found truffle butter for $8. It's good stuff. Needs more sauce and cook down 1 C. each of beef and chicken to 1 c. for richer sauce. Served with roasted butternut squash with old Balsamic.

I was dismayed that they use truffle butter in this recipe. It is grossly expensive ($34.00) to order for just 3.0z. Ridiculous. I will make it with an anchoivy butter instead.

This recipe was fantastic, but with a few minor modifications. I used pancetta instead of mortadella (only because I like pancetta more). I decided to make my own truffle butter by using a tablespoon of white truffle oil, a half-stick of butter, and a pinch of sea salt. It worked out beautifully. I think the next time I make this dish I will add spinach for some color.

Made this for Easter dinner, it was delicious, and different then your typical lamb entree. I used the prosciutto, and added spinach for color. The spinach adds alot to the presentation, otherwise it would be colorless. Potatoes were a nice and easy addition, and had absorbed the flavor of the meat and truffel butter. I would make this again for a special occassion. It's nice that you can prepare it a day ahead of time, and doesn't require alot of effort when cooking it. I had the butcher butterfly the meat for me to help save time.

Replaced Mortadella with Pancetta. Added minced garlic and sage to the stuffing. Also used white truffle butter and covered the outside with Pancetta as well. The kitchen never smelled so good!

This was a lot of fun to make, very satisfying and beautiful to present. I found the directions perfect, especially the cooking time. I used truffle oil instead of butter and the taste really came through. If you are planning a dinner party it's perfect, because the potatoes cook right along with it (I would give them four forks, easy!). When it came to whether or not I would make it again though, I'd have to say no. It is not extra special enough to repeat in my opinion.

ABSOLUTELY. I WOULD MAKE THIS AGAIN. WE MADE THIS DISH FOR OUR GOURMET NIGHT. EVERYONE LOVED IT, THE SMELL WAS FABULOUS! I DID FOLLOW THE SUGGESTION OF SEVERAL OTHERS AND USED ONLY 1 1/2T OF PEPPERCORNS. IT WAS PURFECT. I AMAZED MYSELF EVEN. I DID NOT FIND THE BLACK TRUFFEL BUTTER UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE. I DID FIND THE OIL AND USED THAT. WITHOUT KNOWING HOW IT WOULD TASTE WITH THE BUTTER, IT WAS MOUTHWATERING ANYWAY. I WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN FOR A SPECIAL OCCASION. I DID PREPARE THE MEAT THE NIGHT BEFORE, THAT WAS A GREAT TIME SAVER FOR ME. I BAKED IT IN MY ELECTRIC ROASTER, (IN MY OPINION IS THE BEST KITCHEN ITEM SINCE THE TOASTER). IT WAS NOT DRY. THE POTATOES, WHAT CAN IS SAY, THEY WERE A HIT!

Wasn't as tasty as I expected, but better than a plain brining recipe. The mortadella didn't add that much extra taste to it. I'll probably try it w/ pancetta and shitake mushrooms next time as a reviewer suggested.

I made this meal for my annual Oscar party and it was a big hit!! I followed the recipe exactly and was very please. It was simple to put together and could be prepped ahead of time. I had my butcher butterfly the roast which was a huge timesaver. Try to find the truffle butter it is truly fabulous and really makes the roast special. I rounded out the meal with sauteed broccoli rabe and a beet & blue cheese salad. Fantastic.

What an impressive dinner this was...both in the appearance and in it's rich flavors. I had the butcher at Sutton Place butterfly the pork loin for me and saved myself the frustration of butchering an expensive piece of meat. That's also where I found the black truffle butter. The Kosher salt, black peppercorn, garlic, butter paste that goes over the top was fantastic. It added quite a bam! to the bite. (If you buy a morter & peslte...get a large size or you'll end up crushing things in small batches.)

I had to use black truffle oil instead of the butter and I wonder if this would have changed the taste significantly. Also I was quite surprised when we purchsed the mortadella, I was expecting it to be an Italian cold cut near salami or proscuitto. Nonetheless I made it with the mortadella and the roast was delicious as was the sauce. My husband loved it. In the future I think I will try it with proscuitto.

I made this while visiting my family in rural Ohio. I substituted with truffle oil and pancetta, both of which worked just fine (though I'm sure truffle butter would have been better). Some found the peppercorn/garlic coating to be overpowering while others thought it was just right. Personally, I think I just put a little too much on and will cut back next time. The potatoes were a huge hit - oh, I couldn't find new potatoes so I used yukon golds. The yukons tended to fall apart more than the new potatoes would, but they still worked out. I just remembered another substitution - I used champagne instead of chicken broth (it WAS New Year's Eve) and the sauce was outstanding.

My guests rated this 4 forks, but I found it to be a bit too strong. I used a pork tenderloin instead of the roast. Worked great. Couldn't find truffle butter in northeast WI, but did find olive oil infused with white truffle essence. That worked fine. No mortadella available here, but did find a German butcher shop that had a hard salami that was similar. Like most of the reveiws, this does take a long time to make. Prepared the meat ahead of time and it still took 2 hours for the rest of the process. The potatoes were excellent! I'd like to experiment with other stuffing material that would create a milder, less intense flavor.

This will be a favorite in my recipe box. We did it for an Italian Christmas feast, and it was a hit with everyone, even those younger folks who were reluctant to try anything new! No truffle butter could be found, so we improvised by mixing chopped porcini mushroom with butter. The potatoes were fantastic, after roasting in the juices and fat of the pork. Only problem was that there were NO pan juices for the sauce. The potatoes absorbed all the goodies. Again, we improvised and added some gravy browning liquid. The meat was succulent and made a beautiful presentation. You couldn't go wrong with this one. I will order the truffle butter in advance the next time I do this, and I'm guessing it will be even better.

O.K..... First of all I used extra thick pork loin chops, butterflied, and 1/2 'd the recipe, so the pork was almost over done,{ good thing I checked it in time}. I used white truffle butter from our trip to Italy in september. Awsome!!! {Both the trip and the butter}. We don't eat potatoes so we used brown rice , brussel sprouts, garlic,shallots and pan drippings, with some olive oil. Didn't bother with the sauce. very delicious.

I did not alter the recipe at all and it was terrific. Took longer to cook though than the recipe stated. So when we landed up eating when near bedtime for some they insisted they would forgive me only if I this would become a regular meal in our house.

Wonderful, earthy and fairly easy main dish for a crowd. It both looks and tastes elegant. I followed the recipe to the T except that I could not get truffle butter, so I mixed black truffle oil (the kind with bits of truffles in it) with regular butter. Can't wait to have this lovely dish again.

Great dish! And, very impressive. Be careful not to overcook it as I did. I let it cook until 160 degrees, but should have taken it out at 155. Also, I used my mini-cuisinart to grind my spices for the rub and I think this made the pepper too fine, which made the pepper flavor a bit overwhelming. I will be making this again soon now that I've learned where I went wrong. Strongly encourage you test this out with a small roast before making this for a dinner party.

I tested this recipe this evening prior to a dinner party at my house two days from now & I am sooo glad I did. I was not impressed at all. In fact, a little disappointed as I even ordered the truffle butter as I wanted it to be perfect! Nothing special - ditto for the potatoes. Now I am looking for a new recipe for this weekends main course.

I couldn't find truffle butter so I mixed some truffle oil into the butter mixture and it turned out great. I also added a touch of truffle oil into the potatoes. The whole meal was a huge success. I had a dinner party for 12 and doubled the recipie and there were no leftovers. Will make again as soon as possible but won't invite as many people so I can enjoy some leftovers.

I never did find truffle butter, so I just used unsalted butter without the truffles. This dish was delicious. The potatoes were wonderful. My picky kids ate the pork and potatoes and loved it. I can see why some would make this dish during the holidays. Seems a little heavy, but I'd make it again.

Unbelievable! I followed the recipe as written --truffle butter and all -- for my mom's Mother's Day meal. She is known as "Pork Queen" in our family, and she loved this dish, as did everyone else in our dinner party. Make the Rosemary Roasted Potatoes, too. They're out of this world.

Could not find truffle butter locally so got one little black truffle, chopped it extra fine, added it to 1/2 lb. of european style butter with a little salt and lemon juice and it worked fine. We did the whole menu except for the salt cod appetizer and had raves over the pork roast.

I can't wait to make this again, simply because I messed up and overcooked the darned thing. As our dinner guests backed out at the last moment, my husband and I were the only two to enjoy this. So, I cut the loin into a 2-serving size, reduced the rest of the ingredients appropriately, and roasted away. At the suggested cooktime, the internal temperature had only risen to 130-degrees. 25 minutes later, it was at 142. Another 20 minutes, and it was overcooked. Nonetheless, there were still some juicy areas just beneath the crust that blew me away. I can honestly state that I never would have thought I'd be preparing or eating 'meat-stuffed meat', but this alone changed my mind. I can't wait to make it again with the remaining loin, and will be sure to very closely attend to the temperature. The veggies themselves, to which I added some mushrooms during the last 25 minutes, were incredible by themselves. Try this recipe- I don't think you'll be disappointed.

I made this last weekend for a group of 10 - increased the size of the meat to 5 lbs - and it was devoured. I followed the recipe, truffle butter and all, and it was absolutely fabulous - the meat was so juicy, the sauce scrumptious, and the presentation spectacular. Found really small red and yellow potatoes, so didn't cook them with the meat. Just parboiled them and then put them in the roasting pan while the meat was resting. We served with a mesclun greens salad with pears, gorgonzola and a hot dressing with pancetta and balsamic. Yummy!

I guess I'm missing something. I thought this recipe was just okay, albeit easy to prepare. I used black truffle paste (very expensive, so I used it sparingly), maybe it would have made a difference it I used truffle "butter". I'm going to try this one again and see if it comes out differently.

I couldn't find the truffle butter (except through mail order), so I substituted crushed rosemary mixed with butter instead -- worked rather well, but I'd love to try the truffled version as well. It definitely takes more than 1.25 hours, but I didn't find it too time-consuming. Beautiful presentation.

i did a roman feast for ten on saturday. i started with olive & artichoke crostini (tasty and easy). i followed with the spinach cannelloni (so-so). the roast pork was moist and succulent, with that whisper of subtle, addictive truffle butter. i'm thinking about putting truffle butter on my toast in the AM. the rosemary potatoes were great. i did the asparagus flan from this website, rather than the leek&kale flan(i love asparagus, but not kale -- all my guests asked for the recipe). i agree with the previous writer that the pork cooking time was grossly underestimated -- the potatoes were done before the meat. next time i'll cut down on the peppercorns just a bit, too, though the crust looked beautiful, and put a little more elbow grease into the crushing. all-in-all, march's issue was the next best thing to being in rome.

We made the whole deal-- pork loin, potatoes and leek and kale flan. It took the whole night for two of us but it was the evening's activitiy instead of watching a movie. It was well worth it. The recipes are not hard in themselves, just take time. The results were very impressive and tasted like Italy. I was surprised to find truffle butter in Atlanta-- 4 oz for $13 which isn't bad since I used about half of it. We foudn the cracked peppercorn crust to be too spicy and scraped some of it off before serving. also we did not cook as long as the recipe said, only 40 minutes and eventhem, I think it could have cooked 5 minutes less. We did not have as many pan drippings as I would have liked because the sauce was wonderful. Fortunately I doubled the sauce recipe to begin with. this is not a low fat dish!! But it was deserving of the $50 bottle of Montepulciano that we served with it. I also used little purple potatoes and did not peel them. If you are patient, it is a wonderful dinner and looks so lovely when sliced. an addendum: the recipe is wrong about the total time. This seems to not include all the roasting time. It took us more like 2 1/2 hours, not 1 1/4.
