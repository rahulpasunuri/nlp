I wasn't crazy about this - I guess I could not get passed the jarred/canned artichokes. The tarragon (and I love it) was also a little strong and seemed unwanted. No one really ate it or commented on it at the party. A little 80s in taste and presentation.

added minced onion, gruyere, crabmeat,subbed creme fraiche for sour cream, skipped the tarragon, plenty of cracked pepper. tastes really good even uncooked, but hot and bubbly, it's like ambrosia.

Very rich and yummy... for the first three bites!

Great Recipe. I took heed of others' advice and added 2 cloves minced garlic, pepper, and asiago cheese. My guests devoured it.

I add 1/2 c. of goat cheese and 1/2 c. of cream cheese. I never put the tarragon in it. Everyone raves and asks me to make it again and again.

HERE IS THE TRICK! Secret ingredient is to add a package of GARLIC HERB soup mix (powdered) for great flavor... I add crab or shrimp on occasion.

Love this recipe and have made it several times. Everyone raves about it. I often omit the tarragon and add some pepper.

The basic recipe is okay but I doubled the cheese, substituting parmesan for the romano, added one finely minced garlic clove for some extra flavor, and tossed in a little sea salt. I also sprinkled some grated parmesan on top for a thin crispy top. The tarragon is nice, if only for color. My guests DEVOURED it.

I made this dip for a Mother's Day BBQ. I was embarrassed to say I brought it. There were about 25 people there and I still had to throw out half of the dip!

I've never actually made the epicurious version of this dip, but I've been making a very similar dip for years.... I used canned artichokes (I couldn't *imagine* using those nasty herbed jarred ones) and I use parmesan and a little hot sauce. I like the idea of using spinach and tarragon. Everyone begs for this dip when I go to parties...it's fondly known as "Heart Attack Dip" at my house!

Maybe my artichokes were bad, but I thought this was disgusting (my Mother said it tasted rancid). It's an easy recipe, so I would suggest trying it before actually serving it to guests.

I made this as an appetizer for Christmas dinner and served it with sliced vegetables and a baget. Everyone loved it - but frankly I thought it was sort of bland. I guess I would make it again if I could not think of anything else.

This is delicious and I served it with crusty baguette. My one and only concern about it is the fat content. I used low fat sour cream and canola oil. I wonder if Epicurious.com would consider putting the nutrition contents in recipes. I'd serve this to guests without reservation but will continue to look for a lower fat content option.

So simple and yet a big hit with my guests. I've made this with a half teaspoon of chopped lemon zest, then garnish with a sprig or fresh tarragon and lemon zest curls. Fun and yummy.

This was a pretty good recipe. I doubled everything for a bigger party. Next time I am going to try it with Tofutti "Better Than Sour Cream." I can't really eat dairy and even though I LOVED the dip, I paid for it later. :)

Loved this. The only thing I might do differently next time is to add a tad more fresh tarragon--I think that's what makes the recipe. I also halved the recipe and had to make do with cooking it in two small ramekins--hopefully next time I'll have an appropriately sized casserole dish. This will definitely become an appetizer staple recipe for me!

I love this recipe! I've used it about a dozen times now and it is always a big hit. I modify depending on what I have - mushrooms, crab, and black olives have all worked really well combined with the artichoke. I tend to use less mayo and more sour cream and A LOT more cheese. I use a hollowed out sourdough bread to serve and it is always gone quick!

I made this for our Christmas drinks party and everyone loved it. You don't need the tarragon and I used Parmesan, but remember to make a lot as it quickly disappears. Will make it again and again.

Pretty good. A tiny bit less mayo and something with a little bite, like a 1/2 teaspoon of dijon or maybe a dash of cayenne.

You can get past loathsome mayonaise by using creme fraiche and mustard.

I took heed of the fact that two people found this too salty, and used 1/4 cup of romano and 1/4 cup of softened cream cheese instead. I also added some minced roasted garlic and black pepper. Since I didn't realize until it was too late that I had no tarragon, I used fresh sweet basil. Served it with fresh veggies and crusty French bread. Yummy, but it was gone way too fast. Next time I'll double it and maybe substitute chopped spinach for half the artichoke hearts.

A little salty. Used low-fat mayo and low-fat sourcream, added 2 cloves of garlic and black pepper. Served in a bread bowl. Quick, tasty and easy. Serving with vegetables might cut salt.

This smelled incredible when heating in the oven, but I found that the large quantity of Romano cheese made it too salty for my taste. The host I brought it to claimed to like it, but he didn't seem to be reaching for it very much! Oh well.

This dip really is great! I substituted 1 can of artichoke hearts to cut down on the marinated flavor, used lower fat mayo and added 1 clove of garlic. Next time, and there will for sure be one, i'll just heat it in the microwave since i'm always in a hurry!

This dip was really easy and very yummy. I added some black pepper and red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit and it was great. I think next time I might add some frozen chopped spinach too.

My husband, who is NOT an artichoke lover, and our guests absolutely raved over this simple hors deurve that tastes quite sophisticated with only 5 ingredients. I also made it with plain artichoke hearts (not marinated), a minced garlic clove and extra romano. Served with toasted french bread and pita chips and the dish was wiped clean in minutes. This recipe will defintely make its way into all of my entertaining menus.

If you use canned or frozen artichokes instead of the marinated ones the recipe is 100% better.
