Decent flavors, but it was soo mushy! If you had a picky gourmet infant, I suppose this would be fine. I like to chew my french toast though, so I think I'll stick with my tried and true no-frills recipe.

I served this at a brunch, and it was a huge hit. Everyone loved it. The topping was a good accompaniment, but I changed it slightly: first, I made it with syrup instead of pure maple--I don't know if I bought the wrong brand, but it just didn't taste right. Also, I used fat-free vanilla yogurt, simply because I hate plain yogurt.

Yummy!!! I substituted light wheat bread and used Egg Beaters and skim milk to lower the fat. I also used sugar free maple syrup with a touch of maple flavoring to reduce sugar in the yogurt topping. What a wonderful breakfast treat!
