These were easy and very tasty. I added some vanilla and a teaspoon of espresso powder, skipped the nuts. Because, why waste chocolate real estate with extraneous ingredients?? A few things I learned: use parchment rather than foil. The ease of removal was significant. Also, let the batter sit for a few minutes and it becomes much easier to dish out, holds the shape until I get it in the oven, and bakes evenly. Easy and delicious. Will make again. But for serious chocoholics only.

This was an easy recipe and the result was great. I only had semisweet chocolate, so that's all I used. And I didn't add the 1.5 cups of chocolate chips - just the walnuts and pecans. The batter was goopy (b/c little flour) so I was nervous at first, but they came out just right.

I loved this recipe! It makes an amazing net yield of chews and they taste amazing. I ran with the idea of using cupcake liners to aid in transportation, and baked the chews in MINI muffin liners. I took them to a few grad parties and they were a hit!

These were very good, but not chewy in the least. I'll keep searching.

Delicious and decadent! And fairly quick to make. I made these for a picnic and everyone enjoyed them. Definitely will make again.

I've made these a few times. They're practically idiot-proof. You just look for the top to crack slightly and you're done baking. Obviously, you should try for uniform size and you may want to use cupcake liners rather than parchment paper. The liners make the chews look festive and make them portable.

BEWARE OF BURNING! These cookies were good. I'm sure they would be delicous if you were a chocoholic. However, I wasn't used to cooking cookies that were so thick and chocolatey. They were done long before I thought they looked done. Take them out a little early. You don't have to worry about them being doughy since they are mostly chocolate. Thank goodness this recipe makes so many!

These are dee-lish. I used 1 tsp. vanilla as well, and that worked just fine. They are indeed very fragile before they cool, so be very careful if you have to remove them from the pan before they firm up. I had to since I only have one good cookie sheet.

I used 1 tsp. vanilla and substituted Splenda. They are quite addictive; didn't last long! The substitution worked well.

This is a great recipe if you want something very chewy and soft. The recipe mentions mixing in some vanilla, however the author doesn't tell you how much to use.

these are an absolute must-try. didn't change a single thing. they were soft, chewy, with great texture from the nuts. only thing i did was toast the nuts before putting them in the batter. you MUST try these!
