I was a little wary about making a truffle centered around dates. But the flavor was good and the dates gave it a really wonderfull melt in the mouth texture. A bit of advice is to make these truffles 2 to 3 days before serving. The flavor got alot better 3 days to a week later and I think I have the dates to thank for keeping the little truffles moist as they aged.
