I gave this 4 forks because it is not only great tasting it is unique from ordinary garlic bread - very fresh taste. I used cilantro instead of the parsley because I had it on hand and it complimented my main course. I served this as an accompaniment to Shrimp and Avocado Salad with Mango Dressing from Food and Wine. Nice summer dinner.

I served this with the cornmeal chicken breasts from the menu suggested in the magazine. The bread was very herbal. I would maybe use a more flavorful herb instead of parsley.....such as rosemary or possibly abit of tarragon or sage. It went with the chicken well. I also served fresh corn on the cob and a mixed salad.

This was absolutely delicious! We used more lemon than the recipe called for -- about a healthy tablespoon or so, which gave the bread a lovely and distinctive lemon flavor. It tasted light and flavorful. We served it with the Pasta with Kalamata Olives, Roasted Cherry Tomatoes and Sautéed Chicken recipe from this site and thought it was wonderful and lighter tasting than traditional garlic bread. We like the outside texture of the bread being crispy because the soft inside revealed the delicate warm garlic, lemon butter -- wouldn't use a softer bread. This bread is very versitile and could be served with many dishes. Highly recommend it, it is excellent.

The bread is very light with just a hint of the lemon. It's taste is delicate and can go with anything.

very nice- I love lemon, and you can make it just a hint, or stronger depending on how much you add (of course). I see this with a soup on a crisp day, or with some grilled seafood on a summer day- delicious! Might change the bread to something softer- say Italian or Semolina

a nice change from regular garlic bread, everyone enjoyed it. Will double up next time as we all fought over the last piece.

This was a wonderful recipe and so easy to make....I overcooked the baguette, and it still was great! The bean

I also use the butter on vegetables or as a final touch for grilled fish. I always have some ready in the fridge. This is a keeper!
