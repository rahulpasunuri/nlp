Great flavors here. I used turbinado sugar because that is what I had on hand, a whole ginger root (probably 3/4 to 1 cup), zest and juice of two lemons and two limes. Powerful flavors and very good.

Great! I halved the sugar and increased the lemon and lime juice. After guests devoured it as a palette cleanser, I used leftovers with white rum to make a daiquiri which was very refreshing and easy to drink, especially when topped up with soda water.

I have made this using tropical fruits instead of citrus--it's wonderful with passionfruit, mango, or pineapple! It has too much sugar for me, so I put in only 1-1/2 cups for citrus or passionfruit, and 1 cup or even less for sweet fruits like mango or pineapple. Otherwise the recipe as written is a big hit every time I make it.

This wonderful tasty recipe is a constant hit. Adults and kids love it in summer. I have doubled it due to the demand. If the ginger comes on a little strong, I have re-mixed it in the food processor with lemonade. When I first made it, the ginger taste was very strong so I put it in a martini glass with vodka and it became the biggest hit of the party. Neighbors, my kids and all my neighbors and foodie friends request it constantly.

I agree with those who say this recipe needs less sugar and more ginger and citrus. I cut the water back to three cups, used a half-cup of sugar, at least 4 tablespoons of chopped ginger, 4 tablespoons of lime and 4 of lemon, 4 teaspoons of each zest. This recipe can more easily be made in an electric ice cream maker after it has cooled. It doesn't need to be frozen twice.

I served this as a palate freshener in between courses and it was perfect. In contrast to other reviewers, I might try making it less gingery next time

This was my first attempt at sorbet and it was great - incredibly easy and refreshing, perfect for summer or as a palate cleanser. I cut the sugar by 3/4C and doubled the ginger. Next time I plan to use honey in lieu of some of the sugar

Loved it!

This is really good, but I made this & the Ginger Pear Sorbet on the same day and I like the pear one waaayyyy better (not all my guests agreed with me, though, but most did). This reminded me almost of frozen lemonade (but better). I LOVE ginger, so I almost doubled the amount and I think it still wasn't gingery enough for me personally. I also cut out 1/2 cup of sugar and found it was still a bit too sweet. I cut up some crystallized ginger as garnish - yummy. Next time I might actually mix little pieces of crystallized ginger in with the sorbet before I serve it.

Lovely

I wish I had printed out the recipe with reviewer's comments - too much sugar. I tripled lime and lemon juices trying to overcome that sugar. But it gives it good flaver. Next time I'll cut water back to 3 cups (it was very slushy and watered down), reduce sugar and experiment with increased lime/lemon juices. But great flavor. Family and guests loved it. Easy to make.

Make sure you reduce the sugar quantity in the recipe. I would probably add a bit more ginger next time or just not strain them. Wonderful to have in the freezer all summer!

Wonderful! I also cut the sugar down a bit and it was perfect. I would also caution you to be more careful than I was about the pith -- there was a bit of bitterness that I imagine wouldn't have been there if I had been more careful about adding only the peel. This was a perfect dish to clear the palate for the meat course.

the sorbet was good, but it had too much sugar. I'd add only One and a half cups of sugar next time.

This was great after an Italian meal. and very refreshing during the hot summer months.

I made this as a palate cleanser for a dinner party and it was a huge success. The ginger is strong but it is well balanced with the citrus. This was generally easy to make, but it took longer than normal to freeze into sorbet. I'd leave extra time for that next time.

This recipe is great. I didn't want to strain the ginger, so I cut a 1-inch-cube of ginger into slices, boiled it, and then scooped the slices out with a slotted spoon. The ginger flavor was on the strong side, which was perfect for me.

Very tasty and refreshing, particularly on those hot summer days (and on fresh fruit). Also nice for those who can't eat dairy and are pining for ice cream. A definite keeper in the recipe file.

This is really good and very different, but I think the ginger flavor was too subtle, if that is possible. I also think the sorbet was a little too sweet. But it is indeed good. Next time I will try it with 4 or 5 T of ginger and cut back on the sugar by a third of a cup and see what happens.

This was absolutely wonderful, and very easy to make! Don't skimp on the fresh ginger. The flavor was intense and refreshing. I served it with tiny butter cookies.
