Made this a couple nights ago and am still enjoying it today because it makes a LOT. I used an inexpensive, jammy Zinfandel called Rex-Goliath and also added about 4-5 italian sausages without their casing (turned into "crumbles"). Everyone, including my 6 year old, loved this recipe. MUST add the cheese though b/c it really enhances the wine flavor in the cooked pasta.

pretty good. i used a cheap boxed cab (bota box-not half bad). i think i would've been unhappy with the results if i'd spent more than $5 on the wine. (though, maybe it would have been better if i'd used a nice bottle... i doubt it. by the time you boil wine, add sugar to it, hot pepper, etc--you're not going to appreciate fine wine!) anyway, very easy. something different to do with broc and spaghetti on a weeknight. increase the garlic a bit. and a heavy hand with the salt. gummy pasta means you used cheap pasta.

Wonderful flavors! This is a great recipe to use up leftover red wine. I used half a bottle of Cote du Rhone and half of Bordeaux. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I don't think it's necessary to use fresh high-end wine. The only change I made is that instead of blanching, I braised the broccoli with garlic, almond slivers, red pepper flakes, and a bit of chopped anchovies. Since the noodles are the stars of this dish, so I would recommend using the Parmesan very sparingly.

This was totally blah. Maybe it's great with an expensive bottle of wine, but do you really want to spend $25 on a pasta dish? Would not make again.

I've made this recipe at least 10 times, it's one of our family's favorite dishes. It is vitally important not to overcook the spaghetti before you boil it in the wine, otherwise the pasta will turn gummy. Also, the recipe is serious about the wine being "preferably zinfandel", I've found that the dish has much more flavor if you use a hearty, fruity, full-bodied wine like a zin or a syrah, not a pinot or a cab. Merlot isn't so great either, but it depends on the strength of the particular merlot. Adjust the amount of garlic to your taste, and likewise adjust the amount of parmesan (we tend to use more of both than the recipe calls for). My husband dislikes all veggies, but he has specifically requested that I make this several times.

Really liked this one--flavour depends upon the flavour/quality of wine used!! It was fast and delicious. Take care not to skimp on the oil (but it doesn't have to be swimming in it). The key is to not overboil the pasta in the wine, otherwise it sticks to the bottom. Next time I might add a tiny bit of oil to the wine/spaghetti mixture toward the end of cooking to avoid the sticking issue. Very happy with this one overall--I substituted mexican salsa flakes for the red pepper flakes that I didn't have, but either would be good, I think. I'd make this again for sure!

This is more like 2-1/2 stars. Maybe it depends on the bottle of wine...I used a decent but not excellent bottle. With all the good recipes out there I will probably not make it again. Not particularly flavorful, but it did make me appreciate the flavor of the noodles themselves. Pretty presentation.

This is absolutely worth the bottle of wine and the flavor depends on its quality. Go for it. Only one thing, I made half the amount of spaghetti but used the full amount of seasoning. Dee-licious.

I made this dish for a cooking club (18 women), and I won the prize for most creative dish! It was absolutely delicious! It is important not to skimp on the oil. The noodles were not sticky at all. I added slivered orange bell pepper for additional color and flavor, which was delicious. I couldn't believe how many comments I got on this dish! And it was completely worth the bottle of wine that my husband felt I was wasting!!

So easy and a good way to use a leftover bottle of wine. The flavors are good and the color is wonderful. I'm not sure why the other reviewers had problems with the noodles sticking. I didn't.

I'm a fan of broccoli but this was really quite bland and not worth all the effort. If I were to make it again, I'd probably add bacon to enhance the flavours.

This is a fun recipe for a dinner party. It looks beautiful, it tastes great, and it's a conversation piece all in itself. I found it easy to make although it does have several steps. I'll definitely make this again.

After reading the other reviews, I was very disappointed with this dish. The pasta became a gummy mess and the broccoli was the only flavorful part. Most of this wound up in the garbage. This is why I never try anything new for company/dinner parties. I cannot think of any reason to make this dish again.

very nice and very easy to make. I didn't use a whole bottle of wine and next time I will definitely give the spaghetti more time to cook in the garlic mixture to get more flavour from it.

This was OK, but not worth the fight I had with my husband about the economy of using a whole bottle of wine in one dish. It is pretty, but the broccoli/garlic combo reminded me too much of chinese food, and the wine didn't have *that* much of an impact on the noodles.

with all due respect to the other reviewers, this was terrible. Yuk. Gag a magot! I have never rated a recipe this bad.

I agree that this dish was yummy and easy, but it was also sticky! Did anyone else have a problem with noodles that clung to each other? Any idea what I did wrong or how to fix it?

Like another reviewer, I also love pasta with broccoli, garlic etc. This is a wonderful variant. All my guests gobbled it up and it was a great way to use up an open bottle of hearty wine (it was 3/4s full). I also upped the garlic. A new standard.

This was fabulous! This is a wonderful twist on an old favorite. When I lived in New Jersey, there was a wonderful Italian restaurant which used to make pasta with olive oil, garlic and broccoli. It was my favorite dish, which I've made for years. Cooking the pasta in the red wine like this just made it better. I made it as a main course and will make it again... over and over!! (I did add a wee bit more garlic--like 4 more cloves, and it was superb!)

Fabulous... just as written. It's quirky, eye-catching and simply delicious. Try it with broccolini also. Yum! I can't wait to have it again.

Fun, colorful, and different. I like to save enough wine for a half a glass each to go with the meal. Be careful not to overcook the broccoli.

I'm the worst cook I know and yet I was not only able to get this recipe done, I even doubled up the ingredients and served it at a dinner party. My guests said they loved the taste, the smell and even the colours in the dish. Big success! I used frozen brocolli 'cause I couldn't find it fresh and it still turned out great. I couldn't find Zinfandel red wine, either, so I used a not so dry Cabernet Sauvignon.

Nice hot, better the second day as a cold pasta salad

I made this for my husband and recieved a toast for my efforts. This dish is so good it is hard to believe it is this simple. I added shrimp to the broccoli and garlic for additional flavor. Make this dish and it will be a favorite in your household!

Agree with the other reviewers: quick, pretty, unusual, tasty. Next time I'll decrease the time that the spaghetti spends in the water as it was past al dente by the end with all the cooking in the wine, and maybe the broccoli blanching time for the same reason.

I made this recipe as it is written and it is excellent. The deep red color of the noodles is stunning and the wine imparts a nice flavour. It is a quick dish to make and would be great for casual entertaining since it comes together easily. I would definately use a sharp cheese since it adds that extra bit to the wine taste. Fun and easy!

What a great fall dish. It was particularly good with baked sweet potatoes on the side - the flavors and textures balanced each other very well. Note - one should really use a strong-tasting cheese as they suggest. I was out of parmesan and used a milder cheese, but could tell by tasting the dish that something was lacking. Much better than just having chicken and broccoli with garlic and penne for the hundredth time!

Where to start. The noodles are splendid. I admit I didnt do the recipe. I did only the noodles because I was very interested but dont care much for broccoli. I used whole wheat noodles (for healthy reasons) that looked kinda silly but tasted SUPER. I used ok red wine as it asked for a whole bottle and wondered about the expense. I imagine white noodles and red wine of good quality would be just great, pretty, and fun. I made a fresh tomato basil sauce and used it sparingly with the noodles(also did pan fried tofu, another subject). oh so fun and tasty. I did cook the noodles a tad longer in the water (past 5 min maybe 7 with the whole wheat) then it took about 7-8 to evaporate the wine, but it made the noodles tender not al dente. good in my families opinion. try it! you'll like it!
