I give the recipe 4 forks - but only as modified. I looked at this recipe and decided it was way too rich, fussy, and time-consuming. But I loved the idea of the roasted squash. So I roasted all the veggies as recommended (with probably a little less oil), then tossed the roasted veggies with a mixture of one cup strained (Greek) yogurt and one cup grated parmesan cheese, spread it in 9x13 inch casserole dish and topped with about 4 oz. grated cheddar. Baked till brown and bubbly. Fabulous and still plenty rich. I've gotten rave reviews everytime I've made it.

This does taste like a church squash casserole but it's so much better because I know it does not have Campbell's cream of chicken, mushroom, etc. soup. It is time consuming but isn't every recipe that tastes good? Maybe I'm a slow home cook but I think cooking just takes time.

I agree that this recipe is somewhat time consuming, but if you roast the vegetables one day, eat some of them that day, and make the casserole with the left-overs, it doesn't seem so bad. Today I Cracker-Barrelized this recipe by making sawmill gravy instead of the effete veloute sauce. Sawmill gravy is made with bacon drippings, flour, and milk.

Forget the breadcrumbs and instead of sour cream, try making a white sauce and adding a cup of shredded gruyere cheese. Then, stir in two well-beaten egg yolks to the cooled sauce. Pour over the roasted veggies and bake the casserole at 375 for about 40 minutes or until set in the middle. This is a staple in our house.

Okay. I thought there were way too many breadcrumbs and it was too creamy.

I also thought that for the outcome, this was a tedious recipe to make. Along the way it seemed like this was going to be well worth the effort. But for me, the creamy oux just didn't pull it all together like I thought it would. Yellow squash is just so good and light with a little fresh ground black pepper and salt. I think that's the way I'm going to go next time.

Absolutely delicious recipe! While the previous reviewers have given this recipe bad press for the prep time involved, I would have to say that the results are well worth the effort put forth. This is no Tuna Helper casserole. Perhaps those who find fault with the preparation time should stick to preparing Rice-A-Roni. The rich aroma coming out of the kitchen and the succulent flavor of the roasted vegetables speaks well of the time and effort expended in preparation.

Tedious prep with roasting all the veggies. There was too much sauce making the end result a little too runny. The flavor was great but I'm not sure it's worth all the work.

This casserole was very tasty and I received many compliments. Its was prety time consuming so I'm not sure I'd make it again. Also, the recipe was just plain wrong with the time to roast. At the given temperature and a 1/8 slice, the squash was done after 8 minutes. Don't even consider leaving it for the time quoted in the recipe.

Oven-roasting the squash is definitely the secret here, you could also grill it over charcoal. It really gives it a smoky flavor - not your average casserole. This dish is classic american cuisine at its best.

This is twist on the old church cookbook recipes, but twice as much work. In the one I have the squash was not roasted ahead and shredded carrots were added, stuffing croutons and cream of chicken soup were used. Sorry but sometimes you shouldn't try and glam things up. This should stay a church hotdish

Took a lot of work, but a good recipe. I thought it had a good flavor. A tad salty -- next time I'll probably cut the salt some.
