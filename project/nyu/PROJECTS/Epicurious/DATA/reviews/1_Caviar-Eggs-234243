There must be steps missing, as mentioned previously. See the following from step 2: When dry, arrange bottoms in egg cups with tops on the side. Place toasted side down and toast again, being careful not to burn the toast. Arrange around base of each egg cup. The bread is not mentioned, until it says "place toasted side down..." At least, I assume that is the bread, not the eggshells! As for the caviar, my suspicion is that an overeager editor added "Sevruga, Osetra or Belgua" and the original recipe used the inexpensive lumpfish caviar.

4 oz. of Sevruga = $380 4 oz. of Osetra = $472 4 oz. of Beluga = $640 Colin Cowie's awareness of our current economic situation = Priceless! I've seen this guy on TV a couple of times and always wonder what planet he's living on--now I know its not this one. Cowie makes Martha Stewart look relaxed and down to earth.

Just checked - for 4 oz of caviar, you'll pay between $280 and $540!!

Sounds lovely, but surely the editor was kidding when s/he said that a recipe that calls for 4 oz of beluga caviar proves that " creativity is not necessarily synonymous with expense."

Yes, there are steps missing, such as the toasting. As far as consistency, some people prefer soft, wet eggs, and some like drier, more firm eggs. That step is preference. The recipe makes just enough sense to figure it out. Make toast points, scramble eggs, put caviar on top. Serve eggs and caviar on toast.

Is it me or are there a few steps missing from this recipe? And when it says 'whisk eggs to the desired consistency' it never said what consistency one should desire for this dish.
