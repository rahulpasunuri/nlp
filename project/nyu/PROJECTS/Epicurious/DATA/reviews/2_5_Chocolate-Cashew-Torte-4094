I've made this cake several times, except I left out the cashews and added a thin layer of melted raspberry jam between the layers (very thin! only a hint of raspberry taste!). Very, very yummy.

Looked MUCH better than it tasted. Overall it was very dry and not very appealing.

Very good, although not as good as it looked. I might try pecans next time.

I loved this recipe - have also substituted milk chocolate for bittersweet or semisweet and have also used toasted hazelnuts and macadamia nuts in place of the cashews. I found that the cake is difficult to get out of the pan if you do not use parchment paper and butter and flour the parchment paper.
