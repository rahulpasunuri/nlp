Do ahead, easy-to-pull-together dinner. I too substituted peach for papaya. This is excellent and comes together in a flash.

I usually don't rate recipes when I change them but this one I decided to because of the paypaya salsa. It was awesome, I dredged the scallops in flour with cayenne and alea sea salt. It was awesome!

Delicious! The scallops are your basic seared variety, but the salsa makes the dish. Used mango, as that was available and added a bit of jalapeno.

fabulous! 1 peach instead of papaya is just as good.

Very nice indeed ! Like tuzigoot way back in'05, I find the portion size to be much too small. So basically made the recipe as is except to sub mango for papaya and serve it for 2 not 4. Will do that again.

An excellent recipe. I added some chopped jalapeno for additional flavor; removed the seeds and pith for less heat.

Made this in July and substituted cherries for the papaya, because I refuse to buy tropical fruits in the summer. Outstanding.

Very good. I made as directed and used papaya. My first time cooking with it, but it turned out great. Nice dinner for a hot summer night.

This was very good. I initially made with just papaya, and it needed more zing, so I added a mango and a few extra drops of lime juice as well as some habanero hot sauce, and it was perfectly delicious. I don't think the lemon oil was necessary. Next time I would save the calories and just squeeze some lemon over the scallops after cooking. This was great. Even my very picky boyfriend approved. Victory!

I recently made this as an appetizer at my with my monthly dinner club. Everyone loved it. I used mango instead of papaya as well and plated it 1 scallop on top of the relish and drizzled the lemon oil over.

So simple, so tasty, so impressive, so good! This is an entree to bring out as a visual treat as well as a flavour sensation. I used fresh mango instead of papaya, as I had a couple in the house. The relish should compliment most fish/shellfish and would probably make a delicious light lunch served with cold chicken.

Easy to make and delicious to eat. I used mango because I could not find a papaya and it was just fine. Fresh, and tasty and bright - I will definitely be making this again.

This was great! The salsa was wonderful! I also used mango instead of papaya. Would probably be good with other seafood and maybe even chicken.

I made this for a special New Year's Eve celebration increasing the portion size to 5 scallops each. I served the scallops on a bed of spinach topped with the wild rice (which I had molded in a raminkin) and with the lemon oil drizzled over. A circle of relish completed the presentation. Sophisticated and delicious! Next time I would grill the scallops for an even more heathly dish plus I think it would be easier to prepare.

We've made this twice and really enjoyed it. I substituted a whole mango for the papaya. We've used both scallops and shrimp and grilled them. Yum.

Outstanding! I made the papaya relish as directed. I had other plans for the half of the papaya left over until I tasted the relish. It was so good I had to make another batch! Double the relish - it won't go to waste. This is a definite keeper. I'll be trying the relish over chicken and fish.

I served this as part of a surf & turf for my brother's 40th birthday, plus herbed steamed vegetables. It was amazing, I also drizzled a little balsamic vinegar into the mango/papaya slaw (I used a mix of both). It had a fresh, bright flavor. Will definitely make again!

Don't let the tiny amounts stop you on this one - just double or triple everything for an actual meal. The salsa is what makes this so great - I used it on a game hen and got raves. Also used mango rather than papaya simply because I like mangoes more. Be sure to use fresh cilantro - dried would not work here. All in all, a healthy, tasty, easy and beautiful recipe.
