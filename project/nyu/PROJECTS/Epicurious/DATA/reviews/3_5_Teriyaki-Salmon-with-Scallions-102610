This actually needs to be a recipe? Salmon with bottled teriyaki sauce?

I made it last night, using the half white wine half teriyaki method, and omitted the boiled scallions. It was great and took frozen salmon filets to a higher level!

Very delicious & simple... 3 forks because boiled scallions just did not appeal to me. I am a bit concerned about the salmon in hot skillet w/o and oil, water, etc. I had to turn on my micro-fan and open the door...perhaps I didn't turn my skillet down enough. Had a little trouble with center cooking through- ended up putting it in microwave for 30sec. Served with steamed broccoli & toasted sesame oil, and brown rice. Delicious meal- will try turning my skillet down more next time.

We love this recipe. Very quick and easy to make. We didn't cook the scallions. Rather, we added fresh coriander to the Soy Vay teriyaki sauce and a little sugar. We cooked green beans with toasted sesame seeds as a side dish. My whole family loved this dish.

Very enjoyable. We did not make the scallions and I did 1/2 wine and 1/2 teriyaki sauce. Because I changed the recipe, I gave it 3 forks, but it was great. 3 year old ate it up.

When you need a really healthy and very easy meal, this is it!! Serve the salmon on a bed of wilted spinach that has been sprinkled with coarse sea salt..and a side of pan-seared fresh pineapple spears with a touch of brown sugarand butter....and you're back in California in some wonderful restaurant...! My husband did not like salmon at all untill we started doing it this way, now its a favourite for both of us!!

This was great. I used Soy Vey Island Teriyaki, and ditched the green onions, per other reviewers. I had cooked salmon many times before, but never in a fry pan after marinating. It was SO easy, SO quick and came out SO moist and tender. A definite keeper for weeknight dinner.

I don't think the boiled scallions added anything to this dish. The chopped scallions were an OK addition, but overall not a big improvement on ordinary teriyaki salmon.

Extremely easy and quick. I used 1/2 the teriyaki sauce and 1/2 white wine as others have suggested and it came out great. Definitely a keeper.

Made this for Christmas Eve party. Very good, but boiled scallions?? Not very tasty or pretty. Asparagus sounds great, or steamed green beans with lemon vinaigrette.

I make this recipe often, halving the teriyaki, using a dry white wine to make up the difference. It's far less salty and adds a nice flavor.

I've made this a few times without the boiled scallions. Agree with the other cook re too salty if left in marinade. It was even too salty with all teriaki as directed. I tried 1/2 water and 1/2 teriaki and it came out great. Also I covered the salmon so it would cook in center to more "medium rare". Delicious

The best salmon recipe! I made it with asparagus with lemon and butter (also from epicurious.com) as a side dish, instead of boiled scallions, although I did use diced scallions for garnish. A winning combination!

1-2-3 indeed!!! Very good and easy. Be careful, and don't let the salmon sit in sauce for more than instructed. The fish will be very salty.

I loved it, and its been one of my salmon dishes when company comes over, they rave about it and some have the recipe they like it so much. My friend was over for dinner, and i told her we were having salmon for dinner, she does not like fish and when she tried it, she never stops eating salmon. its the best i came across it, thanks

The dish is above average but I just put salmon in the fry pan with teriaki sauce and orange orange juice and it's great too. When on hand I add pineapple chunks, green onions and sesame seeds.

Having read all the rave reviews, I was eager to try out this recipe. I REALLY liked how the fish turned out: it was cooked perfectly with a nice seared crust on top. Very elegant and delicious. I think my only complaint is that time and again, I just find Teriyaki sauce too salty for my taste. I'd like to keep the technique, but play with different ideas for a sauce... I'll probably make it again nonetheless: I liked the boiled scallions.

This is the most fantiastic salmon recipe. So easy, simple and delicious.

This did not look that interesting but it is by far the best salmon recipe I have ever made. I just cooked the scallions in the skillet with the salmon instead of boiling them. Looks beautiful and tastes delicious!

Excellant, easy way to make a salmon dish. (Next time, I will not make the boiled scallions.) The salmon was delicious, however. Up to par with this authors other recipes. Try her cookbooks; they are fabulous!

Delicious! I added a little honey to the marinade and let it sit for a little over 30 minutes. It was great!

This is a great weeknight dinner. Easy, fast, and delicious. I usually serve it over yakisoba noodles with some steamed veggies.

I love this recipe, I make it all the time when we have salmon. I take off the skin though. It's quick & easy. I use the kikkoman quick & easy sesame teriyaki or the soy vay island teriyaki. I dont bother with the green onions. Some steamed rice and a veggie completes the meal.

Four forks does not do this recipe justice. Five forks is more like it. Easy and delicious.

If you are the type of person who is paranoid about dried out fish then try this recipe! It is so moist and flavorful. I used a teriyaki that was double garlic (can't remember the brand name) and it was just really great.

This was very simple and delicious! I served it with sweet potatoe fries and snap peas w/sesame seeds...very good! I will definitly make this again.

I have to agree that this was simple and elegant, not to mention quick. A better version than I've ever made, the salmon had a nice seared crust on top. I've never used the excess marinade to finish the cooking, and this helped me not to overcook the salmon because on the stove top it is easy to peek with a fork to see when it is just barely done. I might skip the simmered scallions next time, I overcooked those. Daughter raved. I like Soy Vey Teriyaki sauce too.

Absolutely delicious! My husband recommended this go in my "great recipe" binder. I served it with steamed rice and florets of cooked broccoli, water chestnuts and pineapple pieces.

I am giving this the "beyond compare" rating just because it is sooooooooo easy and tastes so good! I thought teriyaki was going to be boring but I was wrong. Easy and delicious!

Wow!!! This is so simple and sooooo delicious! I can't wait to make it again. Next time, maybe a little ginger, but maybe not, it's sooooo good! ps, SoyVey rocks! Thanks again for sharing such great recipes!

The easiest, best salmon recipe I've ever used. The results are impressive! I used Soy- Vey Teriyaki, an amazing, all-natural pre-made sauce from Trader Joe's.

I made my own Teriyaki (Joy of Cooking)and everyone loved the results! Easy, fun, and a different treatment of salmon that reminds me of some of the better Japanese restaurants we've been to. Served it with steamed broccoli and sticky rice.

WONDERFUL!! This dish was VERY EASY to make. From preparation to completion, it took about 15-20 minutes. However, I marinated the salmon for 15 minutes instead of 5. This gave it a stronger teriyaki taste. For anyone who is familiar with the notorious Atlanta Fish Market in Atlanta, this dish comes VERY close to matching their Salmon--Hong Kong Style. I will definitely continue to make this dish.
