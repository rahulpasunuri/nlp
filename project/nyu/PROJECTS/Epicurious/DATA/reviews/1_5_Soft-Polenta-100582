I made the recipe using a regular bay leaf and using chicken broth...it still lacked flavor so the next time I will add cheese as the previous reviewer suggested. The cooking method is very good. I also added a wee bit of butter at the end but it didn't add enough flavor. I'll try this again with some cheese.

I've now made this twice -- the method, not the actual recipe. I use chicken broth, omit the bay leaves and salt, and when the polenta is done, stir in some butter (a tablespoon or two) and some cheese -- one time I used a mix of asiago and ricotta salata (what I had left in the fridge) and another time parmesan. The method is really simple -- it takes time, but not hands-on time. And the leftovers are yummy sliced and fried in some olive oil...
