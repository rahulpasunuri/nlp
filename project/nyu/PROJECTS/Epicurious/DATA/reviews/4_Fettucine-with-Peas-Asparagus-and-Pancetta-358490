I am making it a point to empty out my freezer before i buy anything else to freeze.. So with two bags of frozen peas i went out in-search of a pasta recipe. I liked this recipe as i had most of the ingredients in my fridge minus the asparagus. Made this recipe this evening. Used spaghetti instead of fettuccine, lots of bacon instead of pancetta. Have to say that overall the recipe was very good. No leftovers. Next time will use a Ditali pasta or a mini shell pasta so you can scoop up the yummy peas with a spoon!! Lose the fork! I omitted the asparagus and used only two tbsp of lemon juice on the advice of the earlier reviews. I will add the third tbsp of lemon juice next time as I did not get any taste of lemon. . In addition I poured the cream, Parma cheese, pasta water and baconin with the peas to make a light sauce. Then I tossed the pasta in with the peas. A definite keeper!

This dish turned out OK but I think it's the chef, not the recipe. I will definitely make it again and cut back on the amount of peas. With a little practice, I think the creamy sauce mixed with the pasta will come out as though I were dining in an actual trattoria. The pancetta is delicious!! :)

Made exactly as written with the pancetta except I didn't have fettucine so I used campanelle. Excellent! I love lemon so I didn't mind using the full amount. But if you want a more subtle lemon flavor, I agree that it could be reduced.

Rating: 4
Spectacular. After making this a few of times, the lemon flavour tends to be dominant, so perhaps back off on the juice if that notion doesn't thrill you.

Rating: 4
So delicious and surprisingly light for a dish with cheese and cream, although I used half n half instead. I added more of the veggies than it called for figuring it would help it to be a little healthier. The classic salt and fat combo with the pancetta and cream/cheese was great as always and with the healthy serving of vegetables I'm comfortable searving it more often.

I thought this was tasty but had higher hopes based on the recipe rating. I was happy that I followed other reviewers' instructions and doubled the pancetta and slightly reduced the lemon by a bit. I'd make it again but it's not going into heavy rotation.

Creamy! My husband cut the veggies very small and this creamy sauce covers "healthy" sprouted grain pasta and actually makes it taste good!

Very tasty. Used regular bacon (had no pancetta), otherwise followed as written (except, just realized forgot the olive oil - but all was still well).

Rating: 3
I've made this recipe twice. The second time I doubled the pancetta and used a bit less lemon, which really overpowered the dish. Both times I used fresh homemade fettuccini. Be sure not to overcook the pasta (2-3 min MAX) and add a bit of oil to the boiling water to prevent sticking. My first attempt - I had a difficult time mixing in the ingredients and the dish seemed a bit like a bowl of concrete.

I made this for a buffet without the whipped cream. Generally, the recipe needs more zip. I added miso gravy to the recipe and that helped a lot. If I make it again, I'd add more pancetta (twice as much), reduce the pasta, add more kinds of vegetables, and definitely use miso gravy along with the other spices.

Rating: 1
My family really did not like this at all. If I was to make this again, I would triple the bacon and halve the lemon. The lemon overwhelmed the dish and the rest of the flavors were lost.

This recipe was easy and excellent. Did not use peas as there were no fresh ones and frozen are never good. With smoked pancetta and fresh asparagus it was delicious. Made with fresh tagliatelle for a super quick meal. Definitely will make again as a good twist on Alfredo.

Rating: 3
This was an easy and a fairly quick recipe for a lazy Saturday night. I used farfalle instead of fettuccine as I find that cream sauces nestle nicely in the crevices of this particular pasta. I did not stray further than that from the original recipe and found it to be quite delightful. While the pancetta turned out nice and crispy, it lacked the substantial addition to this recipe that I feel it needed. I will most definitely be making this dish again, but I feel lardon cubes would stand up a bit better to the bevy of vegetables in this particular meal. There was ultimately no "wow" factor in this dish, but it fit the bill for this quick and tasty spring dinner. I might try adding a bit of truffle butter to the asparagus the next time around for a bit of a bolder flavor.

Rating: 0
Delicious. A perfect spring pasta dish. I made a huge batch so that I could take to work during the week. Tastes just as good the next day, although next time I won't add in the pancetta pieces throughout because they get a little soggy. I think it would be really good with ham or even chicken, too.

Rating: 3
I made the recipe as stated except for switching out the heavy cream for half and half and deglazing the pan with a splash of white wine as others recommended. We did enjoy this recipe a lot, but honestly, the amount of prep and large ingredient list will most likely keep me from making this again.

Rating: 4
Delicious! So many veggies and definitely a great dish for the spring. Easy to make- on my first time it took me about 45 minutes, and I'll definitely make it again for a weeknight meal. I only had thin sliced pancetta, but it was nice and crispy and added the smokey, salty taste that the recipe needed.

Rating: 3
I made this as written and it was very good, though not excellent. I found that the cream is completely uneccesary and will eliminate it next time, adding instead one extra tb of olive oil. Also, it was bland, but that problem was easily solved by the addition of a sprinkling of red pepepr flakes.

I used 1/2 n 1/2 instead of cream and bacon. Next time I'll triple the sauce portion, (cream, lemon, lemon zest and cheese) and use pancetta instead of bacon. this dish is like a carbonara with a twist of lemon and vegetables.

Loved it! Followed it to the T...despite the fact that I really wanted to change a few things. I'm glad I didn't, it was excellent! The one minor thing I will do next time is cook more pasta. A full 16oz box would have been perfect, not sure why this calls for only 12oz. I was worried that the liquid content would be too dry, but this was perfect! Will be making this again real soon.

This is the first truly horrible thing I have cooked off of epicurious! Terrible. The lemon just did not go with the rest of the flavors. Perhaps I did something wrong.

This was a hit! I made this dish for a potluck dinner. I literally threw it together at the last minute. I had most of the ingredients and I was pressed for time. Judging by the remainder, and my own taste buds, this was a hit! With only about 25 people in attendance and enough food for 100, they could have chosen anything on the table. They clearly enjoyed this dish. Since I like my fettucine to be a little creamier, I did add more cream and cheese to the recipe. Please make sure to add the lemon, that was a big part of the flavor. The bacon, I used thick cut bacon, really sets up the flavor of this dish. You can't miss with this one and you can easily tweak the recipe to your liking :)

Rating: 2
I enjoyed this dish, but I didn't love it. It was a tad bit too bland for my taste, and I felt like something was missing. It sort of tasted like a microwaved frozen dinner. I think with some tailoring, this could be great, but I would not make it again as written.

I made this dish last night and thought it was great. It is a light dish and perfect for spring/summer however, it is not bland. You don't have to overseason or oversauce everything!

After reading the reviews, I was looking forward to making this for tonight's dinner. Boy, were we disappointed! The asparagus had good flavor from being cooked in the bacon fat, but otherwise it was very bland. I agree with the reviewers who suggested adding crushed red pepper and deglazing the pan with white wine, but I did not have a bottle open and am glad I did not waste even a cheap bottle on this. Not even worth saving the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

This is a terrific dish of pasta. I loved the way the cream and lemon played off of each other. I'm already planning to make this again!! I did add 4 oz pancetta as that was the size of the package. Next time I would deglaze the pan after sautéing the pancetta with white wine.

Yes! You want to eat this. You want to eat it NOW. Make sure you fry the pancetta really crisp so you get a crunchy salty meat bit in with the creamy pasta. Didn't have green onions so I used a baby Walla Walla and some chives. Yes.

amazing. this was a perfect way to highlight in season asparagus and fresh peas at the farmers market. i ran out of fresh basil and parsley so i added in a few tablespoons of homemade pesto. i also deglazed with white wine. i would probably use a bit less parmesan and let guests adjust to their taste.

Made this last night for dinner. Followed the recipe to a T. Thought it was very good, but next time will make the following changes, little more garlic, little more pancetta (but bacon would be very good also), and a little less lemon. I also liked a little red pepper as a finishing touch. Very good will be going in my veggie pasta rotation.

I had proscuitto on hand, chopped it and crisped it up a bit in a tablespoon of olive oil (drained on paper towel) than followed the recipe as written. Wonderfully fresh!

WOW! so many reviews already. I made this last night and we thought it was fantastic. I halved the pasta part of the recipe and made the whole sauce recipe - perfect consistency.What amazed me was how off the servings are. Half the recipe would have served 6 people. We had a lite caesar salad and garlic toast with the pasta. Good thing it was a great recipe because we have plenty of leftovers. Next time I will add more pancetta and a little less lemon juice.

We absolutely adored this recipe! I made it exactly as written, except only used 1 cup of frozen peas as that seemed plenty. I used bacon instead of the pancetta.

Made as stated with fresh local peas (from newly joined coop!), fresh asparagus, and basil from my herb garden.Used 4 oz of pancetta and thought it was great. Loved the lemon cream sauce. Used the 1/3 cup of cream and felt that was enough. Husband and I loved it loved it. 11 yo liked a little tomato sauce mixed in; 9 yo liked as is but only gave it 8 of 10. Both ate it all. Next time will make for an adult dinner so it can be more appreciated and can be accompanied with white wine.

This recipe is great, really fresh and really green. I'm not sure that the cream is even noticeable. More work than I expected, though. If you can get local peas and asparagus, defintiely make this!

This was a very simple, tasty dish. I used a full pound of rigatoni (the bf's favorite with anything that has peas), increased the cream to just under a cup, added a couple extra tosses of parm, and a bit extra of all the veggies/herbs. Next time I will use a bit less lemon. I used prosciutto instead of pancetta but will use pancetta next time; prosciutto just doesn't have enough fat to saute the veggies in. I added a bit of butter for that step. I also sliced a lemon wine baked chicken and added to the top. Salmon would be delicious with this as well, but I do think some kind chicken or fish is necessary to really complete this dish.

I fully agree with "by A Cook", the first time always follow the recipe...you never know what nuance you might find. Only after you try the original recipe then add your own style, and then you can review both. This recipe was awesome, and I was so tempted to add the nutmeg I have hanging on my key-chain; but maybe next time.

I fully agree with you. Recipes are an adventure in cooking and I love to experiment with different ideas of given recipes. So.....a recipe is a list of ingredients to me and how I use them is my choice. Quite enjoyable to experiment with recipes and applaud all the different versions on given recipes. Thanks to all the great chefs!!!

I made a very similar recipe from Bon Appetit that is made with Prosciutto instead of pancetta and it is a family favorite.

This sight is meant to be enjoyable.

my comment earlier as 'a cook' still stands. I don't have a problem with people offering their substitutions (but then again, is one really fairly & squarely rating the recipe when changes are made). My problem is the need to make social commentary about a recipe. I too will make it exactly as is & will enjoy it immensely.

I've made this and loved it - also have done several variations. In one I use diced ham instead of pancetta and some olive oil if additional fat was needed. I've also thrown in some pine nuts at the end and added white wine when I'm looking for a different flavor or to deglaze the pan.

I think a cook from Calgary is probably reacting to other REVIEWERS who suggest upping the cream to 1 cup, not to the actaul recipe itself. And for all of you who got on her case, I think it is a fair question to ask what substitutions others suggest...that is one of the reasons I read the reviews, to hear what others have to say about a recipe and how they would make it better.

I loved this! I made it exactly as called for except without the peas... because I don't like peas. I didn't find it bland at all. The asparagus was the star of the show, and its flavor was divine. The lemon flavor was a subtle undertone that gave it tons of depth. I barely even seasoned it with salt, because the pancetta and parmesan gave it just about all the saltiness and punch it needed, in my opinion. I'll definitely be making this again.

Rating: 4
I thought this was fantastic, and not at all bland as other reviewers suggested. The quality of fresh ingredients probably makes a big difference here. The parsley, lemon, scallions and basil were full of flavor, which enhanced the asparagus. Used bacon instead of Pancetta and used frozen peas instead of fresh. (I know I just said fresh ingredients are important, but we have a newborn in the house, so shelling 2 cups of fresh peas wasn't going to happen.) This meal will definitely make another appearance soon.

I made this last night and though it looked pretty, I thought it somewhat bland--sort of reminded me a warm pasta salad sort of thing. Hubby, however, loved it, and that is why I gave it 3 forks (compomise). I think next time, I might add some herbed goat cheese to give it a little more zing; as it was, I sprinkled gorgonzola on it (and a brush of truffle salt, which, in my opinion, cures EVERYTHING!) It def had a 'light Springtime' taste to it!

Rating: 4
I made this the other night with grilled shrimp. I like the taste-- used my fresh basil and parsley from garden. Had to add more cream and parm as others have noted. As a side dish this will feed at least 8 hungry people! Will probably make 1/2 recipe next time. I also felt 40 minutes of active cooking time a little much for my quick dinner. But, it is a very "fresh" taste for spring/summer dinners.

This was fantastic...made it tonight for a nice weekend Spring dinner. Used 1 whole lemon (juice and rind) used a bit more cream and oil (1 1/2 amount in recipe), and about 1 tablespoon of cooking water...warmed in pan per previous raters...also used diced prosciutto in lieu of pancetta for slightly less fat and a bit more salt to flavor the final dish..my husband and I loved it.

The combination of flavours was excellent. The lemon juice and fresh herbs gave the dish a nice refreshing flavour. Used good quality organic bacon instead of pancetta and used full juice and zest of one lemon. Liquid was enough to coat pasta but not enough to create sauce. Would increase cream if that is what you prefer.

This was good, but didn't knock my socks off. A solid week-night meal. I didn't use peas since my BF isn't a fan, but didn't really miss them. I use the juice of a full lemon and doubled the parmesean - it definitely needed this volume else I could see why other reviewers would call it bland. Also, be generous with the fresh herbs - so great!

My family enjoyed this recipe. I substituted fettuccine for rigatoni. I also used half a yellow onion in place of the green onions. I added minced, sweet, red pepper to the veggies after reading all the reviews claiming it needed more flavor. It was a very easy and fast meal to prepare. My husband has asked me to make this again. All in all a great Spring/Summer meal.

We made this last night and both of us felt it needed more zing to it. I used bacon and whole wheat pasta, but the rest of the ingredients were according to the recipe. We added some pepper flakes and that helped. Maybe some shallots or stronger onion and more garlic would help. Next time I'll also add shrimp or chicken.

I made this last night exactly as written. Both my husband and I agreeded that it needs to be tweated either with the addition of some crushed red pepper to add some zing or perhaps topped with grilled chicken that has been peppered. It is a good basic recipe that is great for a weeknight meal but we like things on the spicy side.

Made this tonight. Easy weekday dish that did not take alot of time and was very filling (not to mention very flavorful). Initially, combining the ingredients didn't 'mesh' but I let it sit over low heat for about 10 minutes to blend the flavors and thought the extra time thickened the sauce and brought everything together. Happy cooking

I loved this pasta dish. We made a half portion, based on earlier reviews and it was plenty for a dinner for 2, with a small bowl for lunch the next day. I used whole wheat pasta, which made it a bit healthier and frozen peas which is what we had in the fridge. I liked it bc there were lots of veggies along with the pasta. The basil added a fresh element, as did the lemon.

I had bacon in the fridge, so I used that instead of pancetta. Also, I ran out of basil so I used tarragon. The tarragon complemented the veggies and lemon zest with it's sweet flavor. I followed the suggestion to double the cream which made the perfect light cream sauce. I loved this receipe!

We really enjoyed this recipe. It was easy and ingredients are readily available. I did think it had a bit too much lemon juice and next time I make it I will decrease the amount.

Ehh...I mean, the spring veggies and lemon give it a definite "springtime" flavor, but when I eat a pasta, I'm looking for it to be enveloping delicious comfortness. Maybe if I had double the cream/garlic as others did this would have tasted more like what I seek in my pasta dishes, but then again, it would seem less springy (and healthy) with a heavy cream sauce. This was just okay. I don't know if I'll actually make it again - there's plenty more quick pasta recipes out there.

Especially loved the addition of lemon rind, really brightened the flavors. Think I'd like to try it with chicken or perhaps salmon. Easy to make too!
