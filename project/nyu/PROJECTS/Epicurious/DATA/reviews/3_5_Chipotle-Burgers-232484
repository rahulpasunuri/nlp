I can't believe how incredibly delicious these were considering the dearth of ingredients. They were smoky and bacony and sweet and spicy and delicious!

Super easy and yummy. Serve these at a summer BBQ with mango salsa and chips to start followed by grilled pineapple and a nutty ice cream.

Can't go wrong with canned chipotles in adobo. This is a great place to start for a good burger. I add cheese of some kind, mustard, caramelized onions, etc., but I do that will all my burgers. Enjoy!

So easy, fast, and delicious. Used twice the chipotle (w/seeds) melted Monterey Jack on top, and served on wheat buns. Absolutely yummy! Next time, i'd serve some chips and guacamole as an appetizer, maybe some corn on the cob as a side.

Caramalized onions really were a great addition to this. I used the seeds in the chipotle as well--just the right amount of sweet from the onions and heat from the chipotle!

We loved these burgers! Moist and smokey. Didn't seed chipotles. Also, didn't bother with adding onion but some put thin sliced vidalia on top. Made a sauce of Ranch dressing, ketchup, and Emeril's seasoning to cool it down (just in case). Didn't need cooling down but sauce was a hit anyway. A keeper.

These are pretty good, but not fantastic. The chipotle peppers and adobo sauce seems to keep the burgers nice and juicy, which is great. The burgers weren't particularly spicy, but the balance of flavours was good.

This was delicious! I made sure to add a little more of the adobo sauce to the meat. Cooked it on the stove since the BBQ isn't out yet. Melted Monterey Jack cheese on the bun and it complemented the burger's flavour nicely. This is definitely a do-again!

I'm about to make this receipe again for just my wife & I. This will be the 1st this this year but the 4th time I've made it. In all previous endeavors I have made these very tasty burgers for groups of friends. I may have used a little more chipotle than called for But they have always been a great hit.

Just as I went out to light the grill, the skies opened up. So got out the trusty skillet and cooked the burgers on the stove. Turned out fine. I did add cheddar as others have suggested. The husband found them "too hot", I thought the heat was just right. Goes to show you...

We loved these burgers! The smokey chipotle added a great flavor. I forgot to take out the seeds so it was just a bit too hot for us so I cooled it down with a dab of ranch dressing on the bun instead of mustard or mayo. One idea to make mixing beef and chipotle easier (and not burn your hands) is to put all the ingredients in a large ziploc bag and mix it from the outside. I got the chipotle and onion evenly distributed and didn't have to worry about getting the chile heat off my hands.

This was a good starting point but it needed alot more chipotle. I used double the amount suggested. I liked the onions in the burger they added a lot of moisture. My result was a flavorful juicy burger. Delicious with Jack cheese and dijon mustard.

These were quite good. The smokey flavor really does good things to the beef. I also left the seeds in for a nice "bite".

Very Very good. Just the right amount of spice. I sauteed the onions before I put them into the meat. Also, very easy and quick!

Very good burger. I did not remove the seeds from the chipotles, trying retain the heat. My wife found the heat perfect, I thought it was a little tame. Next time I will serve them with sliced pickled jalapenos or hot banana pepper rings for the more adventurous. I took the recommendations of sauteeing the onions and topped with extra old cheddar slices. It's a keeper!

This burger is now a regular for us. We make up the patties and freeze individually so anytime we want a burger with some kick to it... they are ready.

What a great change from your basic grilled burger. These were yummy!

I'm really more of a burger purist -- great beef and a slice of cheese usually do it for me -- but my husband and I both thought this variation "worked." A nice change of pace, will certainly keep in the repertoire.

Hard to give four forks to a burger, but this is a better than average recipe. Make sure you grill it enough, the onions overpower if you don't. Saute them before mixing if you're not an onion lover. Some minced jalapeno with the sauteed onions adds nice flavor, or pickled jalapenos on top are really good....and for goodness sakes add a nice slice of cheddar!

First, thank you Cook from San Francisco because that was the funniest review I ever read. You've got some wickedy wry humor there. Secondly, these were great, though I may try to concoct some sort of fancy aoli to go along with the burgers next time.

This was great! My husband and I both liked it, the chipotle really gave the burger a smoky flavor. I'll have to try it next time with the carmelized onions - that sounds good! This recipe is a keeper for me!

These were very good. We grilled them with cheese for a Labor Day weekend dinner with guests, the table set with all the condiments. However, one big problem with the recipe: The cooking time! My husband grilled them for 4 minutes total, as the recipe said (and as I instructed him). They appeared to be done on the outside, but were actually COLD AND RAW. We had to microwave them until they were done. And the whole time he's scolding me: "Next time let me do the thinking since I'm the one with all the barbecuing experience . . . " I let him sit at the table anyway.

Too spicy for me although my family thought it was okay.

These burgers were great! My husband and I are big fans of chipotle peppers and were looking for something to grill. We knew we wanted to try this recipe the second the email came. They were delicious and we can't wait to enjoy them again! We did add a bit more peppers and sauce than it called for though. Enjoy!

Pretty Good. I have did something similiar to this bye using chipolte hot sauce but this was better. I didn't think it was very hot at all and actually might add more chipolte but i like my food really really hot. For those that don't like thier food hot at all but love the smokey flavor...i would recommend getting some green chile (new mexican) chiles and roasted them on the grill before you cook your hamburgar. Add them to the hamburgar meat rather than using the chipolte. I would say about 2 peppers for about a pound of hamburgar. I cooked mine on charcoal and used woodchips (which i think is a must) on the grill. Here i ate on the sandwhich: 1) Provalone cheese (smoked chedder would also be good) 2) Two slices of heirloom tomatoes one being kellogs breakfast and the other being cherokee purple. 3) Two slices of bacon which i also cooked on the grill 4) mayo 5) A slice of onion. Enjoy, Ncage
