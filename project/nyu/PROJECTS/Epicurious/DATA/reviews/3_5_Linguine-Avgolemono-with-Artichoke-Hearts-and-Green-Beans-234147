This is a really good dish! I was looking for a recipe to use up some frozen artichoke hearts and decided to give this a try. The lemon/cream/egg sauce is divine and nicely coats the pasta. I doubled the artichoke hearts, just because I had them and I don't think I would use any less next time. Perfect flavors, will definitely make many times.

I thought this dish was too bland. I followed the recipe, except I'm not really into very acidic foods, so I used half the amount of lemon juice (maybe that's why it turned out so bland...) but I just didn't find the dish very appealing.

Really tasty! I thought that the lemon was the perfect contrast to the artichokes. A nice spring-like dish.

This dish turned out way too lemony. I would halve the lemon juice and go from there. Also following the instructions as written would lead to overcooked vegetables, so watch out for that. I'm thinking of making it again and how I would do it differently, and even making changes to the recipe, I think I would still prefer the standard pasta carbonara or pasta primavera.

I gave this 3 forks simply because it has a delicate flavor - it was a nice side dish, for those who love artichoke hearts. I will make it again, but will wait until warmer weather.

I've tried a lot of recipes from magazines, and should probably come as no surprise that the one I tear out from Bon Appetit are consistently very good! Sharing one I made tonight. The plate is still steaming in front of me as I write. (Incidentally, I am also watching Top Chef). It's really a cinch. Once you have ayour big pot of water boiling, add frozen artichoke hearts and I used frozen haricort verts from Boundelle, so I didn't have to do any trimming/prep of the green beans. I also invested in some gourmet, hand-crafted linguine that had a more rough texture that allowed the sauce to really cling to the noodles. I went a little light on the whipping cream--don't really feel a full half cup was necessary. But it was so simple to whisk together the yolks, cream, lemon juice. It's also key very key to not overcook the veggies or the pasta. You want the veggies just barely tender and then pasta still al dente. Taste the pasta while you cook to get the texture just right. Once you throw the cooked pasta, veggies, cheese, parsley and sauce together and start simmering, it's so fun to watch the sauce thicken up and all the ingredients marry. I didn't need to add any cooking liquid to thin it, but I did add some salt to kick up the flavor. My only regret now is that I have 3 more servings and no friends over for dinner! I would definitely make this again for friends and feel confident it will be a crowd-pleaser. Some 2006 Alicanto Sauvingon Blanc really complimented this pasta very well! The sauce is rich and the tang/grassy flavor really cuts through and refreshes your palate between bites.

Made this today with rice pasta spirals as we don't do gluten. Used frozen french style green beans and canned quartered artichoke hearts. Not much available in my pantry, but it was a nice light pasta dish,would make again!

Very lemony, but delicious and perfect for a summer dinner party. I served it with the goat cheese ravioli and it was a hit. Easy to make and definitely make again.

Made with broccoli, mange tout and leek instead of beans and artichokes. Really delicious. Next time will add a little less lemon to start with and taste before adding more. Needs generous twist of black pepper.

It took me a couple of bites to get into the lemon aspect of the flavor, but it's growing on me. Especially after I chopped up an olive or two and tossed them in my bowl. I have a feeling that my boyfriend isn't going to be a big fan of this, though. Similarly, I wouldn't try to feed it to a kid.

This quick dish turned out great with a few changes to make it a more complex taste. I tore 6 slices of Proscuitto into pieces and softened them in 2 Tbsp olive oil, added the cooked green beans and artichokes, plus 3 Tbsp olive tapenade, and 2 Tbsp fresh garlic; cooked this on medium high for 3 to 5 mins. Finished it with the Avgolemono sauce, which got tossed for 3 mins. before adding the cooked pasta and shredded Parmesan. Added in sprinkling of cracked black pepper and Hawaiian sea salt. Great looking smooth sauce and fresh taste.

It was wonderful! The parsley was a nice addition: it helped lighten the dish up, so it was filling but not too heavy.

I made this recipe with a few extra touches: fresh garlic, broccoli instead of green beans, buttermilk instead of cream (it's what i had in the fridge), and greek olives. It was delicious and I will make it again! A great summer pasta dish.

this dish tasted awful. served it to some friends and it did not go over well. something about the combination of the eggs and lemons. tang is not the right word!

This was quite good albeit rich due to the eggs, heavy cream and cheese, but it was an easy midweek meal. I used haricot vert and loved the combination of them with the sauce and the artichokes. Next time I might slightly reduce the amount of pasta. This dish would be perfect for a summer weekend lunch with friends.

A major hit! I deleted the green beans and added chicken; substituted basil for the parsley. A favorite with my whole family.

We thought this pasta was very good. Used asparagus instead of green beans, which made it a little more delicate, I think.

Made this for my Church Council Dinner it was nice but not thrilling so I added about a 1/4c more lemon juice, Then it was wonderful.

I loved this recipe! It was easy, inexpensive, and delicious! My husband scarfed. This is definitely a cook-again.

This was a quick and easy dish, but my husband and I agree that if you're in the mood for pasta with a creamy sauce, it's not the best. And while pasta with green beans seemed like a good idea, the actual combination was not so tasty.

Great main course or side. Easy and rewarding. Will put in my regular line-up. Still tasty the next day.

Very good, what a great recipe. My daughter and I loved the flavors. The recipe had all our favorites in it, lemon, vegetables, pasta, and cheese. We had it with a shrimp cocktail for an easy dinner.

Mmmm! This dish is so tasty. Even when reheated in the microwave. It has a great lemony-tang to it. It's one of my favorite dishes now. And it was so easy to make. I followed the recipe completely except that I used asparagus instead of green beans. Delish. I highly recommend.

Great looking dish on page 119 of Mar.06 issue...could not resist. It was a wonderfully easy and very good recipe....exactly as written, great flavor with the lemon! We really enjoyed it.... this will be a regular for us. Also reheats well in oven, just cover with foil. Thanks BA for another winner!
