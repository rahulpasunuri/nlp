I needed to whip up a simple dessert for a family dinner, and had only the most basic ingredients in my pantry. This fit the bill perfectly. It's intensely sweet, and next time I would try cutting down slightly on the brown sugar and use dark brown sugar instead of light.

I made this pie using fake maple syrup, as for unknown reasons I have three bottles of the stuff. It turned out really well, the maple flavor was subtle. Very similar to pecan pie, not as sweet, and had more flavor.

Simple, but good! I'm not a big fan of pecan pie, but I definitely liked this. Tasted and smelled like breakfast! Crust was easy, too, although very rich. Picture and more comments: http://piqued.brianfrantz.com/?p=69

I made this recipe for a typical Canadian dinner with friends and visitors from France. It was a great hit. Loved the combination of walnuts and maple syrup.

If you like pecan pie, which I do, this is a nice variation. I really liked the maple walnut combination and it was a big hit with my dinner guest.

This pie is similar to pecan pie, but I particularly like the maple-walnut combination. I would recommend using "B" grade maple syrup if you have it, though; I did, and still thought it could have used more maple flavor.

This is a tasteless combination of too much sugar and syrup. It tastes just too much like pecan pie and I don't like that either.
