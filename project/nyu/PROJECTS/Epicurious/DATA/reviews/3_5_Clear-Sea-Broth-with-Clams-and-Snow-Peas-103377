This kind of soup is called suimono in Japanese, and has been referred to as Consomme Japonais in a le Cordon Bleu cookbook. Suimono and miso soups which include clams are often made with water istead of stock, so I found this dish to be pleasantly flavorful though my wife though ti was too strong. I plan to make it again, adding miso next time.

i think the name is the best part of this recipe. clear sea broth is very poetic.
