Mousse and sauce were good, and easy to make; could have served 3. I didn't do the whole garnish. I did brush butter on the phyllo dough but wished I hadn't. I might rather have a crisp, plain cookie with it than the phyllo. Raspberry vodka worked well instead of eau de vie.

Served this for Fathers' Day. It was a big hit. They thought it looked like a dessert from the CIA.I had just been there and got inspired. I hope you all take the time to try it. Who doesn't like chocolate Mousse.

I have made this exactly this way several times and I always get rave reviews. Beautiful presentation and taste.

Raspberry sauce could use a little lemon juice.

The mousse is just downright tasty...but I agree that the phyllo doesn't match particularly well. I wonder if brushing each layer with butter (which the recipe does not say to do) would help? Hmmm... The presentation was beyond compare, and the chocolate curls really aren't all that difficult or time-consuming (much to my surprise).

I was just looking for a chocolate mousse recipe and used this. Substituted kahlua for the raspberry liqueur. Wow -- what a hit!

This was delicious and it was a great presentation. Everyone loved it. I did not have time to make the chocolate curls and I don't think they were missed at all. I have made it numerous times and I always skip the curls. I used more layers of phyllo for each shell.

The mousse was delicious but I don't think the phyllo went well with it. If I do make the mousse again, I will serve it in chocolate cups rather than phyllo shells. Raspberry sauce complemented the chocolate flavour.

Used a little less chocolate - came out fine - rave reviews from dinner guests - this is a keeper.

I served this at a dinner party of six and completely blushed my way through dessert. It was easy to make, I used Grand Marnier Liquor instead of Raspberry and doubled the amount. This is a definite if you want to impress !!!

This recipe is great! I was a host of a dinner party for 35 people and I choose to serve this as the dessert. The presentation is stupendous and the taste is marvelous! Everyone asked for the recipe. I would definitely do this again with no hesitations.

This was delicious and it looked really sharp! We quadrupled the recipe to make 8 -- no problem in doing so -- you just need enough muffin tins. We did scrap the long and complicated process of making the chocolate curls by using the old standby of making the curls using a peeler and leftover chcoloate squares. You save a lot of time that way.

This definitely involved some advance planning- but was well worth it. It is an impressive dessert, with a beautiful presentation. The phyllo shells are great for other desserts too, and the mousse is also delcious on its own.
