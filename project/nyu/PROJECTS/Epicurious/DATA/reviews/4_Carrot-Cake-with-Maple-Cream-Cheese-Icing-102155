Divine!!!! i made it with whole wheat flour instead of white flour and i/2 white sugar and 1/2 sucanat. Each of our guests eyes lit up as they taste the first morcel! "The best carrot cake I've ever tasted" they said.

The cake is absolutely a winner. And the frosting with that maple syrup taste is simply delicious! I have been making it for 5 years now.

Marvelous. Usually I change recipes a bit to fit my mood. This time, I didn't change a thing. The only thing I should have adjusted was to drop the oven temperature a bit to adjust for our high altitude (8,200 feet), because the layers dropped a bit in the middle, but otherwise FANTASTIC!

This made a perfect birthday cake for my adult son. Very nice flavor & texture. My only changes were that I used some Grade B maple syrup, which made for a stronger flavor that we like and I toasted about 2/3 C shredded coconut and put this over the icing. Everyone loved it! Definitely a keeper.

moist and delicious. rave reviews. i used 1 1/2 tsp. ground ginger, wesson oil and the aunt tom's cream cake frosting. no nuts, zucchini instead of carrots, half brown sugar. mine were done at 30 minutes.

Made the recipe as is but used a 9x13 glass dish instead - baked 50 minutes, turned out perfectly. Buttered & floured the pan before adding the batter. Made one batch of cream cheese frosting from Aunt Tom's Italian Cake recipe on this site as we prefer the traditional icing instead of maple-flavoured. Great recipe, fool-proof. ~from a cook, not a baker

Excellent cake just as written. I substituted conola oil with coconut oil (because I don't use canola oil). Guests raved about it. If you want good results don't fuss with the ingredients.

Rating: 2
Tried this cake with the suggested substitutions - 0.75 c unsweetened apple sauce, only 0.5 c oil, 1.5 c sugar. The cake came out flatter and denser than I expected - more like bread than cake. It also wasn't as moist as I expected. The frosting, while really yummy, was also a little runny and too sweet. Will try another cream cheese frosting recipe and add maple syrup to that.

I thought that this was without a doubt, hands down, the best carrot cake I've ever eaten. I'm a HUGE fan of carrot cake and cream cheese frosting, and I was hesitant about adding the maple to the equation. So glad I did. This cake was on a whole different level from any I have eaten before. Super impressive in size, too. My cake stand cover couldn't fit over it.

So...this cake is ridiculous delicious! We made some changes/additions though: Used Walnuts and pecans, both in the batter Used Canadian Maple #1 Medium for the maple syrup and we added raisins to the batter and then again on entire middle layer of the cake! We lined the bottom of cake with Walnuts and Pecans and the raisins and top middle with a small pile of raisins on top of freshly shredded carrots...and the outer edge with Walnuts and pecans!

this was an excellent recipe. I made it for the first time yesterday and it was my first carrot cake to boot. I made a few alterations to the recipe due to not having some of the ingredients! instead of 2 c. sugar for the cake, i did 1.5 c. sugar and .5 c. light brown sugar. i also used olive oil instead of canola and mascarpone instead of cream cheese. The cake was so moist and flavorful; and is still as moist today. I recommend this recipe to anyone!

Great cake - loved the addition of fresh ginger. I used 1 & 3/4cup sugar in the batter instead since the icing is also sweet.

I tried this recipe and the results were fantastic. Easy to make in my Kitchen aid. I changed the sugar ratio to 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of honey (manuka and orange blossom) which made it really moist. I also used ground ginger which was the same. I also used dairy free cream cheese and it still tasted delicious!

Rating the cake only - this delicious cake is moist and flavorful. I love the addition of fresh ginger. The frosting sounds divine and I will certainly try it next time, but I used the Cream Cheese- Lemon Zest frosting this time around and it was terrific. I halved the recipe to make 1 medium loaf plus 3 cupcakes.

This carrot cake is hands-down the best recipe I've ever come across. The maple cream cheese icing is just divine . . I have no better words to describe it! The only thing about it is that I can't seem to get it to spread really well. Practice makes perfect I suppose! Someone told me this was the second best carrot cake they had ever tasted, but first place went to one that had pineapple in it. Wow, seriously?! My mind won't let me imagine pineapple and carrot cake together! Has anyone else tried this?

This was a perfectly delicious cake. I unfortunately forgot to buy fresh ginger, so I put in ground gringer spice and it was great. Added extra walnuts to the top and everyone went wacky about the dessert. I've saved it in my recipe box.

Fabulous!!! I made this carrot cake for a wedding of 300 {made enough for 400 people}...it was amazing! Also, entered this cake in the County Fair and won 1st Place Best Of Show!! {I do use a different recipe for the frosting though...} Here is the recipe: Luscious Cream Cheese Frosting 8 oz. cream cheese (at room temperature) 1/2 (4 oz.) unsalted butter (at room temperature) 4 cups sifted powdered sugar 1 tsp. vanilla In the bowl of a tabletop mixer fitted with the flat beater, cream together the cream cheese and butter, scrapping down the bowl and beater twice, until fluffy. Add the powdered sugar, first mixing on low speed, then increasing the speed to high. Beat until light and fluffy, again scrap down the bowl and beater twice. Blend in the vanilla. The icing should be smooth and spreadable, if it is too thick add a wee bit of milk. Enjoy! {You may have to double the recipe}

A fantastic cake!! Perfectly moist, with a deliciously complex flavor. The extra spices (see below) gave it a bit of a holiday twist (even though it was a birthday cake, it is November!). Thanks to all the helpful previous comments, I changed the following things: 1. I used a standard cream cheese icing recipe 2. I broke up the walnuts into smaller pieces with a hammer 3. I made the popular substitution of 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce and 1/4 cup canola oil 4. I used 1/2 tsp each powdered ginger, nutmeg, and allspice. This gave it a holiday-esque "gingerbready" taste 5. I used whole wheat flour, which I think made for a more nutritious cake without making it too heavy This will definitely become a staple! I think the only change I would make in the future will be to use only 1 cup of walnuts.

Rating: 4
This is a relatively easy cake to make. Most importantly it was sooo tasty and moist. I've made this recipe both as a cake and as cupcakes. I made the mistake of using walnuts too coarsley chopped the first time around. TThe walnut chunks all travelled to the center fo the cake which made it very difficult to cut through when torting the layers. I'm a cake decorator at heart so I used my own recipe for crusting cream cheese/ marscapone cheese frosting. It got rave reviews both as cupcakes and cakes. For a healthier variation sub apple sauce for the canola oil. I also used apple pie spice instead of just the cinnamon.

All I have to say is friends who don't like cake, love this cake! It's delicious and my husband's birthday request every year!

Rating: 4
I made cupcakes with this recipe. The texture was perfect, and there was no problem with dryness that can happen with some carrot cakes. The maple is a nice touch for the icing -- flavorful without being too intense. I only had powdered ginger, so I used two teaspoons rather than the two tablespoons of minced ginger that the recipe calls for. This recipe will yield at least 24 cupcakes. Of course, only 22 of them actually made it out of the house.

I've been making this cake for years. The requests for it never stop. Always a HUGE hit with everyone. It's easy and moist and just absolutely, hands- down the VERY BEST carrot cake you will ever make. You should definitely give it a whirl. You won't be sorry.

Rating: 4
I have made this cake several times with great success. I use a toasted hazelnut oil, almond oil or walnut oil and have found these oils, although very expensive, make the cake super delicious and unique. I have substituted pecans, toasted coconut and chopped crystallized ginger for the walnuts and either nuts, coconut or a mixture of the two work great (don't recommend crystallized ginger as it all sank to the bottom). The cake is moist, amazing - the fresh ginger is key. I did not like the icing it was too runny.

Loved this cake - make one nine inch round pan and 12 muffins for breakfast. Used 1.5 cups whole wheat pastry flour and half cup soy flour to up the protein. Also grated in half an apple for tartness. Subbed half a cup vanilla yougurt and 1/4 cup apple sauce for some of the oil, added allspice AND added raisins. So..different recipe entirely I suppose..but I love it. It's a great base for me to make changes and makes a healthy breakfast on the go.

Oh, one other thing. I also added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, 1/2 tsp. allspice and 1/2 tsp. ginger (instead of the fresh ginger).

This was the best carrot cake I have ever had - including in restaurants! I did what some reviews said and used 1 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/4 cup oil.

Wonderful!

I've had a handful of memorable carrot cake experiences over the years - the most recent being at a coffee shop a few years back where I was treated to a moist, spicy, sweet slice of heaven. I've been searching ever since for a way to recreate that. THIS is IT! This recipe is perfect! Moist, light, sweet and savory at the same time. The only alterations I made were to double the cinnamon and add 1/2 tsp. each of nutmeg and allspice as suggested by others. I didn't use the maple frosting recipe but opted instead for the "cream cheese-lemon zest icing" recipe on this site. It was a great compliment to the cake.

Rating: 0
This was delicious and received rave reviews. But I must admit to adding the following: 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 3/4 cup crushed pineapple, 3/4 cup raisins. For me carrot cake isn't carrot cake without pineapple and raisins.

Good stuff! I used a half cup of applesauce in lieu of an equal amount of the oil, as I really don't like an oily carrot cake, and that did the trick. The fresh ginger adds a nice twist. I added a half teaspoon extra allspice per one reviewer's recommendation that the batter was a bit bland, and was pleased with the result.

I forgot to note that I decrease the sugar to about 1/2 - 3/4 cup. The bananas are plenty sweet. And I don't like walnuts, so I sometimes use sweet/spicey pecans for garnish instead.

Scrumptious! I have made this cake multiple times. It is always a hit. I substitute mashed bananas and applesauce for the oil. I also add cinnamon to the frosting. Even kids love this cake. My 12 yr old neice wanted this as her b'day cake last year. I like the idea of orange zest in the frosting. I will try that next, in addition to the maple. The combination sounds like it will work well.

This cake was fantastic! I made as the recipe suggested though I used a 9x13 pan. I halved the icing since I didn't think i need as much but my partner said that the icing was HEAVENLY-- better than the cream cheese icing from the cinnamon rolls on this site. It was a big hit in our household and for the lucky guests who think that American-style cakes are so lovely and moist.

Great recipe! Definitely my go-to carrot cake with a few alterations: Subbed 1c softened butter for the oil, added 3/4c of crushed fresh pineapple, and 1/2tsp nutmeg. For the icing, subbed the grated rind of two oranges for the maple syrup, and used 16oz cream cheese, 2c icing sugar, and 5tbsp butter. Brilliant result.

I havn't made that many carrot cakes in my life and have always found them a bit disappointing. This one turned out beautiful and moist...Kept the recipe to the original pretty close...just used half the salt since I used salted butter for the frosting (all I had at home) Baked it in a bundt pan for about 50 min at 350 degrees. Split the bundt cake in a half layer to fit some more frosting on it since the frosting was very generous for a bundt pan...added some coconut shaving on top...looked beautiful too. Carrot cake fan!

This cake was delicious...I might add some pineapple and raisins next time. My only gripe is that I didn't have enough frosting for the whole cake. Will probably multiply by 1.5 next time.

Very moist, very easy to make. The only change I made was I used toasted pecans rather than walnuts and used a different cream cheese icing. The cake was very gingery, more than I'm used to in a carrot cake. Not bad but definitely on the gingery side. I'd probably use less next time.

I have made this recipe 4 times, and each time it is highly regarded by everyone. The recipe is also extremely hardy and tough to screw up - most of the recommendations below can happen or you can just make it exactly as written. As for folks who have problems with saltiness - make sure you're using unsalted butter. For egginess, I'm not sure - I've never seen that before.

I made this cake this past weekend, exactly. Had to redo it because adding 1 tsp of salt made it too salty. Also, added only 3 eggs. 4 eggs made it too eggy...I was disappointed that I didn't like it as so many people did.

This recipe is phenomenal. I was impressed with how it's easy to make, simple ingredients, cooking time was exactly on the mark. I used this recipe as a little experiment and replaced the 3 cups peeled carrots with 3 cups of the remains of yesterday's juicing. A majority of the pulp was carrot, however there was also a little bit of pineapple, watermelon, and strawberry. You can only taste the carrot, but it added a moistness and wonderful texture.

As everyone says, this is a great recipe. So easy! As my guests were eating, all you could hear was moans, because they loved it so much! The icing is a little thin, yes, but I think chilling it a little more before icing the cake would fix that.

I have made this cake about 10 times, and my mother now orders it every year for her birthday. I follow the cake instructions pretty closely except I add about 25% more carrots and 50% more walnuts. The fresh ginger is key! It really adds a depth of flavor that is incomparable otherwise. For the frosting, this year was the favorite. I melted 1/2 stick butter with a cup or so of brown sugar and mixed that with about 20 oz cream cheese. It was fantastick. I highly recommend this cake.

Used 3/4 cup of applesauce and 1/2 cup of canola oil, doubled the cinnamon, added nutmeg and used powdered ginger instead of fresh. Also used 4 cups of carrots instead of three, substituted pecans for the walnuts and omitted the maple syrup in the frosting. Excellent, moist, beautiful cake - my family loved it!

This cake was fabulous! Thanks for the tips from Oz -- I also replaced 3/4 cups of the oil with applesauce, cut back on the sugar and added a teaspooon of nutmeg. Mmmmmm! Only difficulty I had was with the frosting - tasted great but was much too runny, so the top layer of the cake kept slipping off the bottom layer! I think I'll use a different cream cheese frosting next time and skip the maple syrup altogether since the beautiful spices of the cake overpower it anyway.

Wow... so good! I had two colleagues birthdays on the same day, so made two at the same time. As I have a wheat sensitivity and one of the colleagues is health conscious, I modified one. Both were moist and delicious and you couldnt tell that one was half the sugar and wheat free. I replaced the sugar with Splenda, and the flour with half spelt flour and half whole bean flour (I found at a bulk store). I think both were scant cups. I think that spelt still has gluten, so for a full gluten free version, you might want to use all whole bean flour, which absorbs liquid, so youll likely use a little less flour. I didnt modify the cream cheese icing& seriously, you dont mess with cream cheese icing :) Enjoy!

I have made this recipe multiple times, even for people who don't like carrot cake, and it is ALWAYS a hit. It is by far the best carrot cake and one of the best cakes you will ever make. If you put the carrots in a food processor it makes it also very easy. I haven't actually made the maple cream cheese frosting but the cake is absolutely delicious!

I made this and it turned out tremendous. Everyone had nothing but wonderful things to say about the cake. Some of the things I did different were: I omitted the ginger and subbed the 1 1/4 cups of oil for 1 cup of applesauce and 1/4 of oil and it gave the cake a nice moist flavor. And for the sake of short cuts, I bought a tub of pre-made cream cheese frosting and added in some maple flavor extract and it everyone loved the frosting (of course!) . I didn't have 2 9" pans, so I just used a 9 x 13 ceramic dish and it baked for exactly 40 minutes and was perfectly done. I will definitely make this again and recommend it to anyone to try!

Great cake! The fresh ginger gives it that extra body. I have made it twice in the last month. Once with dates and almonds and once with pecans. Both were wonderful. I found that the frosting amount just didn't cut it. So I made more to finish the cake. I also added more butter to mellow the cream cheese and left out the powdered sugar. I don't like really sweet frosting. I used 16 oz cream cheese, 12 oz butter, and 2/3 cup real maple syrup. That gave enough for a crumb coat, decent middle layer and perfect coverage. None for extra decorating though.

after reading the reviews, i too switched out the oil for an unsweetened applesauce. used a generous 1c. of applesauce and a scant 1/4 c. of canola oil - would like to try it with walnut oil next time. also added 1.5 c. of a mix of currants & raisins & made a version of Irish Creme frosting with cream cheese. made cupcakes in stead of a single cake & they have stayed VERY moist & tasty. was NOT at all "eggy" or "oily".

Best. Cake. Ever. Made this as my DH's V-Day surprise treat. Carrot cake is our "special" dessert, we shared a slice on our first date so it has very special emotional connection behind it. This recipe didn't disappoint. Added extra cinnamon & ginger and some shredded coconut to the cake. Next time I'll add a little more powdered sugar to the icing to stiffen it up but overall it was wonderful. Tastes even better on day 2, so I'm making one today to bring with us to our Easter celebration tomorrow. Actually, I think I may be making two b/c Hubby won't want to give up all his delicious cake! :)

I thought that this was deliciously gloopy, but needed to bake it much longer than the recipe instructed (probably because I'm at altitude) And for those who like the maple flavor but don't want to add the syrup to the icing, I used maple-coated pecans in place of the walnuts in the cake (from the bulk section of the gourmet market) - and it really made the whole cake. I also crushed more nuts and coated the sides of the frosted cake with them. Two guests said it was the best carrot cake they've ever had!

This cake was fantastic. A bunch of Superbowl fans just gobbled it up. I substituted applesauce for half of the oil and added powered ginger instead of the chopped.

I've made this cake on two occasions. The first time was for my first Thanksgiving with my in-laws-to-be. It was a great success and my father-in-law wound up eating 3x servings. The second time was for family and friends and the response was equally positive. I'm not sure what I did but the texture on both takes were different. Perhaps it was an issue of baking-time or mix. I also realized the difference powdered sugar makes for the frosting. This was my first cake, ever, but the recipe was easy to follow and no one could tell.

Outstanding!! I wanted to make this cake for a friends birthday. Carrot cake happens to be his favorite. He said it was the best Carrot cake he had ever had. All who tasted it said it was outstanding. I was unsure of using fresh ginger, but the cake was just perfect. I made the icing and added an extra 2 oz of cream cheese and only 1/4 cup of maple syrup because I didn't want the icing to be too runny as other users said it was. The extra cream cheese cut the sweetness whtich I liked very much. I plan to make this cake many times in the future for all occasions. Thank you!

FANTASTIC recipe - but I did make a few tweaks: I added a good grating of fresh nutmeg and about a tsp of ground ginger. Also, I like things in my carrot cakes, so I added a heaping cup of chopped dates and another cup of golden raisins. On the recommendation of a friend, I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup to compensate for the addition of sweet dates to keep the cake from being tooooo sweet, and it made all the difference. Gotta say, though - not a fan of the maple cream cheese icing - despite nearly doubling the powdered sugar and chilling it for 4 hours, it was still more of a thick glaze than a frosting. Next time, will make regular cream cheese frosting.

This cake is AWSOME . However I did not use the Maple CC frosting, I used the standard CC Frosting.On Epicurious form Bon Appetit June 1998. Got RAVE reviews at Thanksgiving.

Definitely use apple sauce instead of oil, comes out a lot more moist. I added raisins, the golden ones, made a big difference. I have made this recipe three times altogether and made cupcakes instead of a cake. I already have orders from my friends for the next I make them.

Even people who don't really like carrot cake loved this one! It was super moist with a delicious flavor. The maple syrup in the frosting was very subtle and yummy and gave this cake a really distinctive taste.

I followed the recipe exactly (except that I only had 3 eggs) and made these as cupcakes. They were delicious. Using one less egg didn't seem to make any difference. I baked at 350 for 25 minutes and they came out perfect.

I used this recipe to make cupcakes - and they were out of this world. Fluffy and very moist. The cupcakes only lasted about 24 hours in this house, and they were gone. I used Ginger juice instead o fresh ginger. Instead of using maple syrup in the icing, I just added about a teaspoon of vanilla paste, the zest of one lemon, and about 2 tablespoons of orange juice. It came out very very fluffy.

Perfect Carrot Cake. I will use this recipe over and over. I substituted coconut oil for the canola and the cake was so moist and delicious. The frosting was a bit too 'loose" so I had to add extra powdered sugar and cream cheese to get the consistency that I like, but the end result was perrrrfect!

i've made this three times now for various birthdays and the whole cake goes everytime. Even my nephew, who normally just eats the icing, loves the cake! I used the canola oil which leads to a beautiful moist cake, not so calorie wise, but who cares, it's a birthday! The applesauce substituion does sound interesting however. I make a butter/icing sugar frosting with either orange or lemon flavouring to add a wee bit of tartness and balance out the cake.

Definately one of the best carrot cakes! Many compliments all around. I did add more cream cheese and powered sugar to make the icing more manageable. otherwise WONDERFUL!!

This cake is absolutely amazing. I'm not a great baker and have little experience with cakes, but this was so easy and so delicious. And SO moist. I did have to add a bit more powdered sugar and/or creamcheese to the frosting because the maple syrup makes it quite liquid-y. The flavor is great though.

I've made this several times since my first rating - still delicious! It's even better using applesauce instead of oil, and I did decide to make the icing this time - it was so good! It was sticky, but not really a problem to work with. I only used 2 cups of icing sugar and it was yummy. This is my new favourite dessert. I'm not sure if the gluten-free flour I used was a factor, but watch the baking times - the last time I made this the cakes were cooked in 30 minutes.

I've made this twice: the first time I stuck to the recipe, the second time I used only 2 eggs (what I had), 2 cups toasted pecans, and cream cheese frosting flavored with a little orange peel and juice. Jackpot! Out of this world flavor and texture! Instead of rounds, I used an oval, foil-lined Calphalon roasting pan and decorated it as a "skating pond" for our daughter's sixth birthday. A few sugar cones, piped over in green, became pine trees. A sprinkle of blue sugar crystals made the rink, and a dusting of powdered sugar made snow. It was gratifying to serve a cake that tasted as lovely as it looked.

Rating: 3
very good, very easy! I made this with a gluten-free flour mix and it came out beautifully, which is not always easy with gluten-free baking. I used a 13X9 pan and the edges were a bit burnt by the time the centre cooked. Will try applesauce next time as suggested. Oh, and I didn't bother with the icing - I may be the only person in the world who doesn't like it. :)

Still a perennial favorite in my house (and other people's houses-- once I almost got kicked out because I didn't bring the cake). It seems they tweaked the frosting recipe, though-- last time I made it using the current recipe listed here, the frosting wasn't runny at all. The maple flavor is still nearly undetectable, but I don't find it to be too sweet or anything and it does complement the cake perfectly.

My new husband absolutely loves them! So moist and tasty. Not too sweet or heavy like the kind at coffee shops. Very very very delicious. I used the giant muffin pans and it yeilded 9. Next time I will double recipe for grander muffins. I didn't mess with the frosting....store bought worked just fine. Just a dallop so not to compete with the taste.

I made this cake for a birthday and it went over well. Very moist. No problems with the icing being runny.

I made this carrot cake for a New Years Day dinner party and everyone went nuts over it! I initially thought it was alright, but even as of today, people are requesting this cake for the next dinner party, even my ex-, who doesn't care for cakes or anything sweet in particular, looooved this cake. The only thing I altered was the frosting, I substituted the maple frostig for traditional cream cheese frosting. I am definitely making this cake again!

Did the modifications according to the reviews below and it came out amazing. Don't eat it right after it comes out of the oven or it'll taste too gingery; the ginger taste melds as it cools. The cake is moist and lighter than normal carrot cakes w/ this much ingredients (sort of a lighter, fresher, better tasting version of Au Bon Pain carrot cake muffins). The cake doesn't rise much, so it's ok to fill the cake pans 2/3 full instead of 1/2 full. The frosting wasn't too sweet either; I'd suggest putting in as much confectioner's sugar as needed to make it thicker; the maple syrup makes it too runny with the recipe as is and I even chilled the frosting to thicken it. This would also turn out great as muffins w/ the frosting, but cut the time to 20min instead of 30-40min.

This cake is absolutely fabulous. I have made it several times, and it always comes out great. There have been concerns about the icing, but I find that it works great if you chill it for a while to let it thicken before spreading it on the cake. This is by FAR the best carrot cake I've ever had.

My friend requested carrot cake for her birthday cake. I'm not a fan but complied. The cake was really really easy to make and I liked the use of fresh ginger in it. I made a vanilla frosting instead of the cream cheese one b/c she didn't want cc. I thought the cake okay, but over a period of several days I kept meeting ppl from the party and each one not only raved about the cake but grabbed onto the person next to them while EXCLAIMING how amazing the cake was. So I had to share this and give the cake 4 forks. btw...the only altering I did was to replace the white sugar for brown sugar. The cake was not at all sweet, which is nice, since it gives you the freedom to put a good icing on it.

With all the recommended changes, especially with reducing the amount of oil in the recipe, you might as well try a different recipe. Almost all the recommended changes, are actually part of the original recipe for Orange-Pineapple Carrot Cake found elswhere on this website. Only 1/2 cup veg. oil called for.

This was the best carrot cake ever! We have a nut allergy so we skipped the nuts - still tasted great. I also skipped the ginger (simply forgot to add it -oops!) and it was still wonderful.

This was my first real baking project, and it turned out wonderfully! I got a lot of compliments on the cake. I didn't have any maple syrup for the icing, but I added half a teaspoon of vanilla extract instead, and it turned out well. I halved the amount of sugar required for the icing, as many people recommended - it was just right. Any more sugar in the icing would have made it too sweet.

I used this recipe for the middle layer of a wedding cake, and it was great. It slices beautifully, freezes well, and tastes great! I used pureed candied ginger instead of chopped ginger.

This carrot cake slices beautifully! It's moist and delicious. I added allspice and nutmeg, and used William Sonoma's pureed candied ginger for the ginger. In the icing, I used maple cream instead of maple syrup. The icing is too soft for me, even after refrigerating overnight, so i'll need to adjust that in the future

Very good carrot cake but I should have read more of the reviews before I made it because then I would have known to cut back on the sugar in the frosting. It was too sweet so the flavor of the cake itself was lost a bit. Otherwise, a very fine cake with nice presentation.

It was moist and delicious. However, instead of using the maple icing, I opted for lemon cream cheese icing (added grated zest into it to).

Found this recipe while looking for different ways to use a bumper crop of carrots (BTW the Chilled Carrot Soup With Cumin and Lime on this site is fabulous), and was really pleased with the cake. Put the entire recipe into 2, 8" pans though I knew better, but though it took an extra 5 minutes to bake the only problem was a few small overdone places at the very edges. Once it was iced (did not use the syrup, a variation suggested by others) it was fine. And perhaps because it was only 8" around, I was able to use the bottom of my salad spinner as a makeshift cake dome.

I've made this cake several times and, if I can avoid having my dogs eat it while it's cooling, it always comes out delicious. It gets rave reviews from everyone who tries it. The frosting is exceptionally runny; I would suggest cutting down on the syrup used (the maple flavor is not especially prominent anyway) and, if possible, chilling it in the fridge for a while before you ice the cake. I don't find the frosting too sweet myself. As for the cake, it is wonderfully moist and the flavors are well-balanced, but it does take, on average, 15-20 minutes longer than the time given in the recipe to completely bake. I love carrot cake, and I have to say this kind is my most favorite.

I have used this recipe since it was printed in the 1999 issue. I do not add walnuts. I also add a can of crushed pineapple which makes this recipe so moist everyone will ask for more. If you do not add the maple syrup to the frosting, it will not be runny or gooey and it is not too sweet. Several members of my family asks for this to be their birthday cakes.

This was my first attempt at carrot cake, and it was much easier and more delicious than expected. I've always found carrot cake to have too sweet of a frosting (that I often throw cut off and throw away), and was pleasantly surprised with the light cream cheese topping. The frosting is kind of runny, however- don't expect to make pretty patterns on the frosting.

Moist & delicious! I made a tall double-layer 9x13" cake by doubling the cake recipe and making a recipe and a half of the frosting. Glad it doesn't have raisins, coconut, crushed pineapple, or other "fancy" stuff. About 5-6 medium carrots will yield the 4 cups of grated carrots.

The cake was really good, nice and moist, but if I make it again I'm going to add raisins. The icing is fantastic, worth making even if you use boxed carrot cake. The only thing I did differently was to use just 1.5 cups of powdered sugar instead of the 2.5, which I thought seemed like a lot. It was plenty sweet with just 1.5 cups - if you don't like your icing super sweet, you could probably get away with just 1 cup - try adding it slowly and taste as you go.

I've made this cake twice. Both times the reactions have been amazing. People have said it was the best cake they ever tasted. Since I try to avoid refined sugar, I substituted the two cups of sugar in the cake with 1.5 cups of Grade B Maple Syrup. You also have to reduce the liquid by about four tablespoons which I do by spooning out a bit of egg white and giving the grated carrots a squeeze before putting them in the batter. And the cake should be baked at 325. For the frosting, it's equally delicious with just a half cup of powdered sugar. Trust me, with a sprinkle of coconut on top, the cake is luscious. No one would ever guess that they're eating a healthier-than-most cake. If you want to impress your friends, make this cake!

I've made this cake many times, and it has been such a success it is now a staple at every family gathering. I add a little more cinammon and ginger than called for. I like the frosting thicker and fluffier so I spend a longer amount of time mixing it with a hand mixer. It comes out perfect every time.

This is a super-moist, delicious carrot cake. It turned out a little lighter than other carrot cakes I've seen, but the flavor was wonderful. Instead of 2 cups of refined sugar, I used 1 cup of refined and 1 cup of light brown sugar. I also added allspice and nutmeg to the recipe. I read in another cookbook that one should try to use California-grown carrots because they are the sweetest. I followed this advice, but have no other experience to compare it with, so am unable to say if it's true or not. I will definitely use this recipe the next time I make a carrot cake.

I read a good many of the reviews for this cake and was thoroughly disappointed with the final flavour. While the cake was very easy to make, and did indeed turn out to be quite moist, I just didn't feel that it lived up to the reviews. Initially I thought the addition of fresh ginger would be a nice flavour boost, but it seemd to disappear after baking. The maple flavour in the icing was really apparent when it was made last night, but it was not a big flavour note once the cake was on the plate this morning. I did, however, like the softness of the icing, as opposed to other reviewers. The icing I would make again, replacing the maple syrup with 2 tbsp of milk instead. By the way, I used a medium grade of maple syrup instead of the light to ensure the maple flavour would come through. Perhaps I am being too critical, as the cake totally disappeared at our annual charity breakfast this morning. Really, I believe there are much better carrot cake recipes than this.

Wow, wow, wow. A lot of people have already said it, but this is the best carrot cake I've ever had! At first I was a bit deterred by the claims that it's so 'light in texture," b/c I usually like my carrot cake dense and moist. I was pleasantly surprised that it lightness (not fluffiness) was perfect. It really is easy to make, too, since it doesn't require endless sifting and beating of butter as with other cakes. I used darker, Grade B maple syrup for the frosting, which I found to be key, and I toasted the walnuts before adding them to the cake batter. The only major adjustment I made were the addition of and extra 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, and 1/8 tsp of cloves. The balance and complexity of spices was fantastic! I'll definitely be making this again and again!

I read every single review (yes, all!) and condensed the repeated suggestions as follows; use half the oil and replace the rest with unsweetened applesauce; use crystalized ginger, finely chopped (to avoid sticking into one big clump, I chopped the ginger up on flour, which actually did help); do NOT over pack the carrots in your measurements; increase cinnemon (suggestion was for whole tsp, I used a bit less); add 1/2 c. raisins. Other suggestions I may try depending on my guests diets; replace sugar with splenda or with finely chopped raisins. Regardless of all the possible changes, this is truly the nicest carrot cake - very forgiving from what I can tell. And yes, that frosting is so delicious. I had no problem with the consistency - several complained of it being runny. I also used grade B maple syrup for additional flavor (being from Vermont there is no way I will use maple flavoring for enhancing - yuck!) If there is a chocolate cake recipe that can fetch as many groans and compliments as this cake, I want to hear about it! For now, this will be my family's traditional birthday cake. ALSO,you can make 1/2 the recipe and it makes 12 perfect cupcakes - Bake for 25 mins at 350F. (whoever referred to them as "muffins" was mistaken) Scrumptious!

This cake had the potential to be great. But, because I strayed from the recipe, it was only good. I didn't have 2 cake pans, so I dumped everything into a single 8X8X2 dish. That made the cake too thick to cook through in the recommended time. I had to overbake -- and dry out -- to get the center done. I salvaged by drizzling the cake with OJ and slathering with the icing (which is fantastic!). I'm going to buy cake pans today.

A deliciously moist carrot cake with a festive, winter-y feel, thanks to the ginger. This tastes very much like the German "Xmas-cake". For a stronger carrot taste I will also go down on the ginger next time, as some reviewers recommend. Nontheless a big success with my guests!

This is an excellent carrot cake! I made it for a parent dinner of my mom's where she had to take a dessert. (My mom made sure to bring me home a slice!)I added a cup of raisins and used my own icing. I garnished it with walnut haves and a decoration of carrots. I made the decoration my melting 2 tablespoons of butter in a skillet, adding 1 cup of grated or shaved carrots with 3 tablespoons of good maple syrup and sauteed for two to three minutes until the carrots were tender. I spread them on a paper town afterwards to drain and cool. Delicious! It came from one of th Barefoot Contessa books. It made the perfect garnish for the cake. A parents even called our house four days later to say how good it was! Will most definitely make again.

This is the best carrot cake I've ever made. My sister, who is not a fan of carrot cake, absolutely loved it. I did make some changes to the recipe though. I lowered the amount of sugar from two cups to 1 1/2 - there was enough sweetness coming from the icing. I also added raisins and put in less ginger. I did try the maple syrup icing, but I'd leave out the maple syrup next time. It tastes delicious plain - I was tempted to eat all the icing out of the bowl. Putting in less powdered sugar also makes the icing less runny (which is something other reviewers complained about). Overall this is a great recipe and I'd make this cake over and over again.

I just got finished baking this cake and making the icing!!! WOW!!! It's completely incredible!! I followed the cake recipe exactly except instead of adding 2T. of minced fresh ginger I added 1T. minced crystallized ginger and 1T. of the fresh. The icing is to die for. I did what another reviewer suggested and used 16oz of cream cheese. This made the perfect icing consistency. I used the recipe amount for butter, powdered sugar, and the 1/4cup of maple syrup. I wanted the icing with more maple flavor so I added 1tsp. of imitation maple flavoring. This made the icing more maple-ish and also gave the icing more of a warm light nutty brown color which is nice!!! Everyone out there is cyber-cooking world, make this cake!! you will not be disappointed!!!! love, sara

I can't stop eating this cake! This recipe is better than Carrot Cake Bakery in my town, which sells only carrot cake. I modified the recipe a bit and added two teaspons of cinnamon and 1 cup of raisins. I also used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and didn't notice a huge loss in flavor or consistency. This is a winner recipe! Definitely will be on the holiday menu this year.

UNBELIEVABLE. i have made this twice for birthday parties and people are now inviting me to their parties hoping i'll make it. i used half the ginger in the cake and half the maple in the icing (so it's not too thin). i've doubled the recipe and baked it in 2 12" round pans and also baked a full recipe in a 13x9" pan. perfect both times. i thought the old fashioned chocolate cake w/ ganache on this site was the perfect cake, but this one is up there for non-chocoholics.

Very moist cake. Delish! One thing, I was expecting the frosting to be more maple-y and I could hardly taste the maple. I used grade A - perhaps that was my problem?

My husband (then fiance) told me he loved carrot cake so I decided to bake one for his birthday one year...now everyone in the family wants me to bake one for their birthday with this fabulous frosting! I make the recipe as is. I do put the frosting in the refrigerator while the cake is baking and cooling, and I don't have any problems with it being runny. Everyone fights over eating the leftover frosting - dipping all kinds of things in it (it also makes a great filling for stuffed French Toast).

Excellent, classic carrot cake. Made in bundt pan for a buffet (easier to self-serve). Followed batter recipe exactly, except subsititued 1/4 c unsweetend applesauce for 1/4 of the canola oil. Baked for 55 minutes at 350, will bake for only 50 minutes next time. Walnuts turned black around the edges in the cake (if anyone can suggest a fix for that, please do!). Used The New Basics cookbook cream cheese icing: 8oz cream cheese, 6T butter, 1t vanilla, 3c. powdered sugar, dash of fresh lemon juice, chill it for 30 minutes. Just super!

I made this as a wedding cake. It was a smash. Almost a year later I have I have strange e-mail asking for the recipe. alteration to recipe Almonds instead of walnuts Leave out maple in frosting

Somebody stop me from eating all the frosting while the cake is still baking!!! I added 2tbsp more butter, 11 oz cream cheese(that's all I had) 1/2 tsp rum flavor + 1/2 tsp brandy extract and a bit less syrup in fear of runny-ness and WOW! Best frosting I've ever tasted. Forget the cake!

I wouldn't change a thing with this recipe. It is absolutely delicious. I have made this easily over a dozen times and every time I get raving and ranting reviews with everyone wanting the recipe. This is one of my favorite things to make - always a crowd pleaser.

This is a great classic carrot cake recipe! A keeper! Make it as the recipe says -- the fresh ginger is a must and don't add the extra spices some have (unless what you really want is a spice cake). For the frosting, I used 16oz of cream cheese (as I worried about the numerous other cooks' comments on runnines) and that made a nice consistency frosting, although a tad runny still, but it was probably exacerbated by some very humid weather. Chill the frosting before frosting the cake, and chill the cake before serving. That helps! I will make this again, maybe try it with the applesauce substitute, and will probably use my own special cream cheese frosting recipe and add the maple syrup.

Rating: 4
By far the best carrot cake I have ever had. Very easy to make, with outstanding results. I add raisins, and use the Ginger-Cream Cheese Icing recipe on this site. I would add less butter and more cream cheese to the icing next time. But the cake - moist, delicious, perfect! The second time I made it I replaced half of the vegetable oil with apple sauce with no adverse effects. Make this recipe once and people will ask for it again and again.

I made this for a friend's cake order. The next day she was raving about it.. so much! I must confess that I only tasted bits and pieces, but it was fabulous. I used 1T ginger powder, instead of the fresh. It didn't make a difference. Also, I used just plain cream cheese and 10x for the frosting. One point though, don't go cheap on the frosting. I used almost a pound of cream cheese and 10x to taste.

I have made this recipe twice-- for a baby shower and a dinner party-- and people just raved over it!! I agree with others that the frosting is a bit too runny and hard to work with even though it tastes great. I think I'll try a different frosting next time but I wouldn't change a thing about the cake itself.

Made this for mother's day and it was a huge hit with everyone. It's a great carrot cake, moist and delicious. For those who like a more simple cake, omit the ginger and walnuts. I also left out the maple syrup in the icing. I garnished the cake with chopped toasted pecans instead.

Rating: 4
Excellent carrot cake recipe! It's fairly light and not overly sweet. I didn't use all the powdered sugar called for in the recipe for the icing but added more maple syrup. I can't eat carrot cake in a restaurant anymore since it's usually too heavy, greasy and sweet, compared to this. It's not the easiest to make, but from-scratch cakes never are, anyway. YUM

This cake was very moist and delicious! Some of our guests commented that this was the best carrot cake they had ever had.

Very nice cake. Moist and dense, nice spice flavour. Used a very tasty New Brunswick maple syrup, but the icing still didn't have enough maple flavouring for my palate, so I added about half a teaspoon of artificial maple extract. Went against my Canadian culture to use artificial stuff, but its all I had, and it tasted very good in the end.

I love this recipe! Made it a dozen times and everyone loved it. I lessened the ginger though and it took me a couple of times before I was able to perfect the icing so it would not be runny.

Rating: 3
I reduced the sugar to only 1 1/2 cups and found this to be the right sweetness for me. I might have packed the carrots too much because I find it moist but almost on the dense side. I love the teasing flavor of the ginger in it. I didn't use the icing above (no maple syrup readily available) but decided on Lemon Cream Cheese Icing found on this site too. All in all I think this is a keeper.

I made this cake for the third time last weekend, and I felt compelled to write another review. It was outrageously good, of course, but I made a couple of changes to the recipe that I think put it over the top! Instead of fresh ginger, I used candied ginger that I minced very finely. I find that the candied variety is more mellow, less spicy, yet still very flavorful and potent. The icing was another thing I changed a bit. I ended up having to use an entire (small) box of powdered sugar to get the desired consistency. It turned out very well...perfect, spreadable, and not at all cloying. This really is the best carrot cake recipe around! The birthday boy was very pleased again (I made this cake for him last year), and everyone else told me that they have never had better. Even though I'm not a big fan of carrot cake, I have to agree! INCREDIBLE!

Despite some of the reviews, I thought the frosting was perfect--not too runny or too sweet, in fact a little tangy. And the cake was absolutely delicious! I did use a little more cinnamon 1.5 tsp and a littl nutmeg .25 tsp and raisins instead of walnuts. I made it into a train shape for a 2 year old's bday party and it was quite a success!

This cake came out great. Everyone raved about it. I did however, make some changes. I subtituted non sweetened apple sauce for the oil. I cut back on the powdered sugar in the icing by 1 cup and added about 1 tsp of vanilla. Cake was moist and delicious and the icing completed it.

I made this for Valentine's Day for my sweetie because carrot cake is his favourite. He loved the cake. I thought it was good, but not great, then again, I prefer chocolate! I omitted the ginger because I was afraid it might be overpowering. I accidentally put 2 tsp. of cinnamon and it came out fine. I also used pecans (his favourite) instead of walnuts. I followed the instructions for the cream cheese frosting to the "t" but it came out runny. I used Kraft Philadelphia regular (not light) cream cheese. I also had about 1 cup of it left over! Could be because I used 2 heart shaped cake tins and had less surface space to work with. Next time, I will just use one 8 oz. block of cream cheese instead of 10 oz. Maybe that will solve the runniness.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe twice, and the main problem I have had with it is that the cake gets devoured once it is tasted. It is addictive and makes my guests a little bit crazed, yum yum... I too have had trouble with the consistency of the frosting. The trouble with more sugar is that the consistency might be right but the frosting can become too sickly sweet. For a twist, try adding about a 1/2 ounce of bourbon to the frosting, its flavor works well with the cake. I couldn't taste the maple at all, so I ended up adding a little vanilla extract and bourbon and was very satisfied with the taste of the frosting, even though it was a little runny.

I thought this was a GREAT carrot cake recipe! I have never made a carrot cake before, but out of the few I have ever tasted, this was the best! The cake's texture was wonderfully moist. I think the frosting was pretty good. I might try adding more male syrup to make it sweeter or something. It wasn't anything suberbly special, but it was still good. The cake was ABSOLUTELY GREAT! You must make this!

This cake was delicious. I followed other's suggestions as follows: For the cake I doubled the cinnamon, added 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, used 3/4 C oil & 1/2 cup oil, & decreased the ginger to 1 tablespoon. For the icing: I used decreased the powdered sugar to 1 1/2 cups and had no problems at all with the consistency or quantity (it was sweet enough as well). Also, the cake was done in approx 30 min. However, I think I'll keep searching for the perfect carrot cake recipe - this just reminded me too much of "spice cake".

I wholeheartedly agree with all the positive feedback this recipe has earned thus far. This is by far the BEST carrot cake I have EVEr had in my entire life. I love to bake (I'm 20) and this is without a doubt THE recipe people are always asking me to make whenever there is a gathering. The maple cream icing is also a hit- I have a really sweet tooth so i sometimes like to add mroe maple syrup (aunt jemima =D) to make it even sweeter, which will probably make a lot of you cringe but I absolutely adore it. Of course when other eaters are involved, I always stick to the recipe. If you've never made this before or have never tasted carrot cake before, LET THIS RECIPE BE YOUR GUIDE!!! 37 thumbs up!!!!

This was delicious. I have gotten so many requests for this cake that I had to make 3 in one week!! The only caution I have is regarding the frosting. It is really yummy but be careful that you get the American Philadelphia Cream Cheese. If you are like me and get the German version then be careful with the amount you use. You cannot use the amount the receipe calls for as it is cut with more milk (I guess) which makes the frosting runny and very frustrating...otherwise it is fantastic!!

I like the carrot cake itself a lot; it's just like a quick bread or muffins. I don't like the icing, though. Too runny and sweet. My friend preferred the Triple-Layer Carrot Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting recipe on this site. BTW, the cake was done baking after 30 mins.

This cake was exceptional. The different flavors compliment each other so well and combine to form the best carrot cake i've ever made. The icing was the best part.

A cook in Swanton, MD I substituted my own homemade sugarless apple butter for all of the oil in the recipe and it was extremely moist. I also substituted Splenda for half of the sugar, and used brown sugar for the rest. I also baked it in a bundt pan. I added more Garrett County maple syrup than called for, but would half the icing amount next time and use less confectioners sugar. Also, this would make terrific muffins. I will use all Splenda in the cake in the future. Great recipe!

I was looking for a cream cheese frosting with a twist for my carrot cake, and came upon this one. After reading the reviews, it seemed as if most readers enjoyed the flavor, but thought it was too runny. I substituted 1 teaspoon maple extract for the maple syrup and used 2 cups of powdered sugar. The consistency was perfect and the flavor was even better. Everyone that tried it swore they would never use a regular cream cheese icing again!

This is one incredible recipe! Got rave reviews from everyone (a lot of the guests and the birthday boy himself exclaimed that this was the best carrot cake they've ever had). Personally, I don't like carrot cake that much, but this was definitely the exception. The cake was very moist and slicing it was like drawing a knife through very soft butter. The icing was amazing, too! We loved the maple-y flavor. I would definitely make this cake again...it is a keeper!

I thought it was good but not great. Per others suggestions: I toasted the nuts, substituted apple sauce for part of the oil, doubled the cinnamon. I also baked it in a 9 X 13 pan for ease. For the frosting I cut back a bit on the butter, used low fat cream cheese and a bit more powdered sugar. The frosting was very mapely which was interesting, but a bit too sweet for me. I think I would have preferred the regular cream cheese icing. The spreadablility was fine. Overall, I think I am still looking for a better carrot cake.

This was yummy- I'll make it again but I'm still on a hunt to find a better carrot cake recipe. I actually did the maple in the cream cheese frosting and it didn't give much flavor as I thought it would- still delicious.

Loved it! I didn't use the maple-cream cheese icing. Instead, I used the cream cheese frosting from the triple layer carrot cake recipe. Delicious! Also, I had 10 inch pans and not 9 inch, and the 10 inch worked out fine, just cooked it 30 minutes, and not 40. Made this for Easter, and everyone loved it - even people who don't like carrot cake!

UNBELEIVEABLE!!!! I am a diabetic and i have to substitue some things- BUT it was still unbelievable!! I use succant (sugar cane natural) instead of regular sugar, it's more like brown sugar. I use wheat free and gluten free all-purpose flour. I used organic carrots, raisins, and organic maple applesauce! SOOO good!! I also substituted 1/2c. raisins for the extra 1/2 cup of succant (sugar). 3 cups carrots, 3/4 c. applesauce and 1/3 c. safflower oil. 2 cups toasted walnuts chooped in the processor- you REALLY need these!! and organic fresh ginger! I defy any of you to taste the difference between the succanat and the flour substitutions!! And so much better for you! The cream cheese frosting also had no sugar in it, i took a recipe from Martha Stewart for a Honey-Cream Cheese Frosting recipe. It uses 16 oz. Cream cheese and 1/2 cup of honey- but i also added 1/3 c. maple syrup (organic of course!)

Okay, I'll admit it, I could really take or leave the cake recipe-- I have my own that I'm thoroughly attached to. But the maple frosting is awesome! Such a nice change! It was a bit hit at our house.

To help anyone who will making this cake. I got these directions from a cook in San Fran, CA last year and did test it. Substitute 1 cup unsweetened applesauce for 1 cup of oil, and 1 cup chopped golden raisins for 1 cup of the sugar. Just a side note, there are now raisins just for baking that are much softer in texture than the normal raisin. Have a great Easter!

OK, Stockton; did you really make two carrot cakes for your 20 guests? You posted the same thing, with minor changes (not the baking times, I note) when reviewing the triple layer carrot cake. I was ready to believe that you had really taken all the comments/suggestions and condensed them for our benefit, but now I wonder???????

Rating: 4
Read no further; here are everyone's suggestions (and there are about 15 printed pages of suggestions). Double Cinnamon. Use half white, half brown for sugar. For oil, use 1/3 oil, 1/3 applesauce, 1/3 buttermilk. Use 4 cups carrots (use food processor; it's the least mess). Use 2 cups walnuts or pecans; toast before chopping. Add 1/2 to 1 c. golden raisins (dust w/ flour before adding so they don't sink to the bottom?). Throw in 1/2 cup drained crushed pineapple. Keep ginger; add 1 t. freshed grated nutmeg. I cooked in 2 10" cake pans in separate ovens (so center wouldn't sink?). One cooked in 25 minutes, other 40. Just keep checking. Made another one without nuts and raisins and cooking time almost doubled. After cooling, wrap and freeze. Frost when frozen. I made frosting with lemon extract instead of maple syrup and only added enough powdered sugar for good consistency. Next time, I'll make in 9x13 pan and just put a dollop of frosting on top. This cake is, truly, so good, it doesn't need anything! Had 20 for dinner; everyone loved it!

Awesome!! I also used 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil and it was incredibly flavourful and moist. I substituted raisins for the walnuts.

I may go with the other suggestions to make the icing a bit firmer. Overall, a winner. I will be making this many times over.

Wonderful. Easy to make and delicious. We made the cake the day before and it still seemed as moist as humanly possible. As a nice topping my girlfriend made decoritive carrots on the top with green icing and small pieces of carrot shaped... well, like carrots. Only other comment would be that it seemed a bit heavy on the ginger. It may have been how we made it, but if a second attempt came out the same way I'd probably try to cut down the ginger and see if it brought out the carrot flavor a bit more. Seriously great cake nonetheless.

I made this recipe with 3/4 cup applesauce and a 1/2 cup of oil like other readers suggested and it worked out great. I did add 1/4 cup of raisins but if you add the raisins decrease the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. For the icing, based on other reviewer comments, I used almost 3/4 cup less than the recipe called for in the powdered sugar department and every one really liked the icing with the cake.

I'd never made carrot cake before in my life, but when a friend asked me to make one for his birthday, I thought I'd give it a go. In a last minute rush I found this recipe, and gave it a bash. The result was a cake that lasted about two seconds before being devoured. This cake couldn't have been easier to make, and was absolutely delicous. I added nutmeg and extra cinnamon, left out the ginger and used pecans instead of walnuts. Next time I make it I would like to try using applesauce. My only complaint was I found the icing a bit runny - but delicous all the same. I think I'll have to make another one tonight to keep everyone happy!

Carrot cake is my husband's favorite, but as I am more of a cook than a baker, I hadn't made him a homemade one. I used this recipe for my first effort, and it was the best carrot cake I had ever eaten in my life! (I am also a fan!) He raved about it, and made me promise to make it for him for his birthday from now on! The only thing I would change would be to reduce the maple syrup and add an 1/8 tsp of pure extract; I don't like the sweetness to be overpowering. Also, I think this step might improve the consistency slightly as well. Thank you for a wonderfull recipe!

Rating: 3
As I was making ten of these, I used ten 10" X 3" pans, and split the cakes in to two layers. The finished product yielded longer and slightly slimmer slices (about 12) which set it apart from the typical tall, almost toppling over layer cake. Frosting: 4 lbs unsalted butter, 6 lbs shortening, 4 lbs cream cheese, 16 lbs 10-X sugar. Add water and vanilla extract to cut the sugary bite and smooth to spreadable consistency.

We reduced the amt. of confectioners sugar in the frosting to 2 cups, and it was delicious and tangy. Next time we would probably use half the amt. of fresh ginger--The flavor is quite strong. Using applesauce in place of 3/4 cup of the oil worked beautifully.

I made this cake after reading all of the hints and suggestions. I used 1/2 c. oil and 3/4 c. applesauce. I thickened up the frosting by using 12 oz. of cream cheese, a stick of butter and 1/3 c. of maple syrup. It was thick and perfect. I brought it to a friend's house and everyone enjoyed it. It was moist and delicious. I will defineately make this many times again.

Thanks to all who reviewed this cake! I combined a lot of the suggestions and the result was great. Specifically, I added a little more cinnamon, a "healthy" 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg and 1 cup golden raisins. I used 3/4 cup canola oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce, and I used the full amount of fresh ginger. I made the frosting as written, and didn't have a problem. Again, thanks for the excellent suggestions!

WOW!!! I just finished the last piece for breakfast, 5 days after I made it. It was almost as good today as when I first made it. I had a small problem with the icing. Noting a previous reviewer's comments, I increased the icing by 50%. It was very hard to spread and never really got thick enough, even after an hour in the refrigerator. Maybe more sugar would have helped, but it was plenty sweet enough as is. One sure thing...I will be making this again.

This cake is by far the best carrot cake I've eaten! I took the advice of others, and split the applesauce with the canola oil.

Even better on the second day!

This is a very easy cake to make. I subsitited 1 cup applesauce for 1 cup of oil, added some nutmeg and increased the cinnamon by 1 teaspoon. The frosting turned out a bit thin but I think I added a bit too much maple syrup. I also put in 1 cup of dark raisins and 1 cup of pecans. My husband said it was the best cake I've ever made! It is good but I think I've made better, maybe I'm just a chocolate person at heart.

In the past, I've had disasterous results with carrot cake recipes. With this one, I feel as though I've struck gold! I omitted the fresh ginger. Next time, I think I'll try the others' suggestions, especially using applesauce and adding raisins. I'm curious about the olive oil substitution; sounds like it's worth a go. If you have a surfeit of carrots in your fridge, try this recipe.

I just served this to a shop full of men working with wood - they raved. They especially complimented the frosting. They will eat what ever I bring in, but when they walk all the way into my office to tell me how great it was I know they mean it. I added craisins instead of regular raisins, this added a fruity flavor to the cake.

This cake is absolutely wonderful!! I wanted to make carrot cake for a good friend of mine when he was sick with colon cancer because that was his favorite. I searched and discovered this recipe. It was a hit with both my friend Russ and his wife! Russ has since gone to be with the Lord, but I'm grateful that I got to make and share this awesome cake with him. After reading many of the suggestions and using my own experience (I've made this cake several times!), I double the cinnamon, cut the ginger in 1/2 (I use powdered ginger spice), use 1 cup sugar, 1 cup unsweetened applesauce, 1/4 cup vegetable oil, then added 1 cup golden raisins. I've made this cake both with and without nuts and it's delicious both ways. For the icing I use 3 cups powdered sugar and cut back on the maple icing (but not too much because the maple flavor is what makes the icing so special!)

This was a good carrot cake according to my husband (I didn't care for it - the ginger wasn't to my liking)The cake was very moist and full of flavor. The icing was delicious - I cut back on the sugar by 1 cup and added more maple syrup for a stronger flavor. Personally I will stick to my usual carrot cake recipe but I will now use the maple icing. It was a quality cake, I cand certainly see why it got rave rewiews just be careful with the ginger as it has a definate presence.

This carrot cake was amazing especially the icing. I always wanted to make one and am glad I came across this recipe. I even followed everyone's tip in using applesauce. It was great. My mom and dad kept asking me to bake more. My dad even went as far as to peel a whole bag of carrots. The only thing though is that I use olive oil instead of canola oil...for some reason it tasted better. I made it 2-3 times in the beginning with olive oil (only because I didnt have canola oil with me the first time). When I ran out of olive oil I went and bought canola oil just as the recipe said...I made it twice..and it just didnt taste the same and seemed dryer..not as moist. I then went back to using olive oil and I was like..YESS!!..it tasted like the first 2-3 times when I made the cake. Tastes great when you toast the nuts (I used walnuts and pecans) and top it over the icing...YUM!!

This was a delicious carrot cake. I reduced the oil to 1 cup and added 3/4 cup crushed pineapple. Next time I'll try substituting applesauce for the oil as so many have suggested. The frosting was yummy, but I felt it was a little too runny. I had to put the frosting in the freezer for 45 minutes before I could spread it. Nonetheless, it got rave reviews and I'll make it again!

I bake often, but have always shied away from carrot cakes, thinking you had to be a real pro. I tried this with no trouble and boy did my family love it. The icing was incredible, with a nice subtle maple flavor that was perfect!

This was delicious. I grated the carrots with food processor, which made the recipe that much quicker and easier.

One day I was just craving carrot cake and I thought I'd try this one. It was so good that I've made it at least 5 times more. And EASY, and guests seem to love it!

Wow, a yummy, moist cake that's really easy to make! This recipe is a winner! For a slightly more blended spicy flavor I added about a half teaspoon each of nutmeg and powdered ginger to the full teaspoon of cinnamon leaving it as the dominant spice. I did this because the fresh ginger scared me a bit as I tend to over-spice my cooking and I wanted this cake to be palatable to everyone in the office. One suggestion on the frosting: keep the cream cheese and butter cooler than room temp so that the icing is less gooey and thick enough to stick on the sides of the stacked cakes.

Great recipe and really not too difficult to make. Everyone loved it and commented how flavorful it was and it really is better the next day! I would suggest going light on the fresh ginger so that it doesn't dominate.

I've never made carrot cake before, but I can't wait to try out this recipe. Could anyone tell me if/how I need to modify the recipe if I want to bake it in a Bundt pan? Thanks!

In an effort to really trim fat, I replaced all eggs and oil with Wonderslim (follow package directions). I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. I also added nutmeg and raisins, opted for pecans in lieu of walnuts and used 1 1/2 cups of white whole wheat flour( King Arthur) and 1/2 cup of wheat germ. I also increased the cinnamon to 2 teaspoons). The end result was moist, dark and fragrant. It's delicious and more nutritions.

This is the first time I've ever baked a cake from scratch (*blush*) and it turned out AMAZING. I took the advice on the apple sauce substitution (didn't miss the fat at all) and added about 1/4 tsp of all spice. Next time, I'd make the frosting less sweet and add some orange zest to the cake batter. Everyone loved this cake!

I added about a cup of sultanas to this recipe and it was a huge hit. The cake was moist and tasty. The icing was fantastic and really made the final taste extra special. The cake itself looked nice and high which is great for presentation.

My husband is the baker at a fine hotel in Key West and he loved it! It is very moist. I added a touch of allspice, ground cloves and nutmeg to the recipe for a little more of a spiced taste and I tossed in a few raisins, too. To cut the amount of fat in the overall cake I substituted low fat cream cheese and skipped the butter all together, I just adde a little oil to the cream cheese for consistency. I would definitely make this again...but, not too often, our waistlines would suffer.

Fantastic recipe - raves from all who tasted it. I had no ginger, but the cake was delicious without it. The frosting was so delicious that I have made it to accompany other desserts besides the carrot cake.

Wow, this cake was beautiful, incredibly moist and delicious, and garnered rave reviews from our guests! This was my first attempt at carrot cake, and will not be the last, since my husband LOVES it! I did not do any major changes or substitutions to the recipe--remember this is CAKE and it's supposed to be decadent! I did half white and half brown sugar and doubled the cinnamon-perfect. Save your calorie reduction for other recipes--not this one. The icing was delicious, as well. I would add a little more maple syrup next time, and balance that out with a little more cream cheese for texture. This cake was served to 7 people who were already groaning from a full meal, and there were no leftovers! Definitely a keeper.

I didn't have fresh ginger & used candied instead -- but no ginger taste came through -- too bad. Used pecans instead of walnuts but walnut halves on top, and put golden raisins in the cake. Put fresh coconut in the frosting, and only used about half the maple syrup cuz I ran out. So frosting was good consistency but there was barely enough of it. A pretty good carrot cake. No, a good carrot cake, if you like carrot cake.

I was excited to make this cake after all the reviews I had read. Taking everyone's suggestions, I substituted 1 cup unsweetened applesauce for 1 cup of the oil, and 1 cup chopped golden raisins for 1 cup of the sugar. I lessened the amount of ginger because I was worried it would overpower the cake. I made it in 9 1/2 inch pans, and baked them for 30-35 minutes. I only used 1 cup of powdered sugar in the frosting. I also used low fat cream cheese, but it was runny (even after being in the freezer for about an hour) so I will probably use regular cream cheese next time. This is a very moist, not too sweet cake with lots of texture (carrots, walnuts, raisins, etc.).

A few comments -- at least in my oven the cooking time of 40 mins was too long - next time I'll try 30. Also, too much butter in the frosting, so I'll trim that back a bit as well. Otherwise, absolutely yummy - I'll definately make it again.

I made this cake in a sheet cake pan for a birthday party and everyone loved it. I did take everyone's suggestions and (1) substitute 1 cup sugar for raisins (2) increased cinnamon to 2 teaspoons and (3) substituted about half of the oil for applesauce. Did not miss them. Very good and very moist. However, I was skeptical of a cake recipe that omitted baking powder so I threw in 2 teaspoons of baking powder. Does it work without it?

I have made this cake several times, and it turns out great every time...my friends and family love it, so they ask for it over and over. However, I think there´s just too much oil in it, so I reduced it between 3/4-1 cup.Also,sneak a little brown sugar,raisins and maybe a hint of ground cloves too.

Outstanding. I used non-dairy cream cheese (tofu cream cheese) and used a maple flavored pancake syrup by accident. Considering the amount of oil, I really only saved a few calories; but, I managed to make it dairy-free and hence, Kosher.

I made this cake together with a fussy, non approving Israeli woman who snickered as I added every ingredient. (I guess carrot cake is not so popular here in Israel). But the compliments did not end, let me tell you. People were SHOCKED!They had never tasted anything like it. We followed the recipe almost exactly except that we added more than the required amount of ginger. At the end we put chopped nuts around the perimeter of the cake and I created a little flourish using carrot shavings. mmmmmm!!!

As I am not a big carrot cake fan, but made this for my husband's birthday cake, even I enjoyed this cake, and everyone else raved over it! Very moist, very tasty and easy to prepare! However, I used this recipe as a basic, and amended it a bit to add suggestions from other carrot cake recipies I found - increased the cinnamon to 2 tsp., used 1 c. brown sugar and 1 c. white sugar, decreased the oil to 3/4 c. and added 1/2 c. buttermilk, added a bit of fresh nutmeg, added zest from a large orange, 1/2 c. chopped golden raisins, a small can of crushed pineapple, drained, increased the nuts to 1 1/2 c., and omitted the maple syrup in the frosting and didn't use quite the full amount of powdered sugar (depending on taste). I also put it in a bundt pan and frosted that, and it turned out beautiful! This amended version is a keeper!

Thank you, Marcie from Ann Arbor! I made this cake with all your changes - applesauce, raisins & crystallized ginger and added pecans. It was a major hit! Everyone loved it - called it the new holiday family fruitcake! Next time, I think I will make it in a 13"x9" pan so the soft frosting won't be an issue. My sister-in-law suggested making it in loaf pans and putting a light glaze instead of the heavier frosting. That would work, too. Anyway you make it, this is definitely a keeper!

This was great! Invited some family over for dinner. They wanted to take the leftovers home. Swearing it was the best carrot cake they ever ate. And the maple cream cheese frosting is delicious! I actually had about half of the frosting left over. If you are making carrot cake , make this one!

This recipe makes a very tasty carrot cake! I read a lot of the reviews before I started. The consistency of the icing seemed to present problems for a few people. I did not have any problems with icicng consistency. Perhaps those who had consistency problems used one of the "softer" spreadable varieties of cream cheese. I used the traditional cream cheese "blocks". I did take the advice of previous reviewers and used less sugar in the icing. I figured that I'd start with one cup and go up from there. One cup was just enough. I imagine 2.5 cups would have been much too sweet. Insted of the 1.25 cups of walnuts I used .75 cups of pecans (because I had pecans not walnuts on hand) and a .5 cup of raisins. Otherwise I followed the recipe and I am pleased with the result. I highly reccomend this recipe!

I saw this recipe on the internet and decided to give it a go. But due to my father being diabetic i have had to change some of the ingredients. I have used 1 cup of greated apple, which was a substitiute for the apple sauce that was already suggested. I also used Wholemeal flour as a substitute for the plain flour, and the sugar was taken out and splender (a sugar substitute ) was used. Due to the added moisture that occured due to the apple being greated i had to add about 1/4 cup of extra flour. I also did not use to the icing as it was too high in sugar. The cake was moist and light.

We made this yesterday for my husband's birthday -it was delicious. As suggested by another reviewer we made it more healthy - we replaced 1 cup of the oil for 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce-so we only used 1/4 cup of canola oil. We also replaced 1 cup of the sugar with 1 cup of chopped raisins - so we only used 1 cup of the sugar! We chopped the raisins in the Cuisinart. I used ginger that was preminced and in a jar - so I did not have to go through the pain of peeling it and all....We used sweet organic carrots. We did not use the nuts. Also we only used 8 oz. of cream cheese - as that is the amount of a bar of cream cheese. We used salted butter. Lastly I beat all of the icing ingredients at the same time and it worked out just fine. It was yummy. The best carrot cake I have ever made and I have made a lot of carrot cakes!

I still decided to try this recipe after reading all the mixed reviews. I have to admit, it was absolutely delicious. A friend unexpectedly showed up and stayed for dinner so we had that for dessert.

My in laws are English and had not tried carrot cake before so I used this recipe for a sample. It was a hit. I made some minor adjustments in that I substituted 1 cup of grated carrots for 1 cup of well drained, crushed pineapple and added 1/2 cup of crystallized ginger. I also used milk instead of maple syrup for the icing as I thought it would be too sweet. This is a very rich cake.

I am not a big carrot cake fan, but this cake turned out great. I made a lower fat version by substituting apple sauce for the oil. It turned out moist and very good, and not heavy at all. My husband really liked it and this is the recipe I will use when I make carrot cake again.

This was soooo heavenly. I ate it for breakfast, lunch and dinner! My parents loved it, too. It was a bit oily, but I think that was only noticeable to me because I ate so much of it. This is such a moist, decadent cake. As for the icing, I made the amount the recipe called for-- too much, which just meant I ate the leftover icing from the bowl with a rubber spatula. Bad, bad, but oh so good!

Really good. I added raisins and only used 1 cup of sugar in the frosting, which I made with low-fat cream cheese only. It made for a perfectly not-too-sweet, anytime-of-day carrot cake. Very user-friendly recipe, too.

I made this cake with pecans instead of walnuts. I used 2 9 inch round cake pans and the cake rose very well. The icing didn't seem to set up well. It was very thin but tasted great. I would definitely make this again but would surely try different icing. I also would try this as muffins.

I made this cake for a small get together, and got rave reviews. I deleted the nuts and raisins (made it too much like a bread and not a cake). Added a can of crushed pineapples, which made the cake ultra moist. I've added this to my cake recipe collection.

I have never made a carrot cake before, so I was not sure how high this cake was supposed to rise. (seemed a little flat to me). If anyone could email me with help on this, I would appreciate it. Regardless, the cake was a hit, I used the fresh ginger as well. There were, however, mixed reviews on the icing, I think next time around, I will use regular cream cheese icing, and substitute raisins for the walnuts. Very moist, flavorful cake! I will absolutely make this again.

At the mere mention of this cake, my boyfriend swoons with ecstasy. It was very moist and delicious! I used Grade A maple syrup in the icing, though, and while it tasted great, I didn't get much maple flavor. I think Grade B is probably the way to go. Because the icing was sweet, I iced it pretty thinly (I'm not big on gobs of frosting) and it was perfect.

This recipe is truly scrumptuous! My entire family enjoyed the moist cake with textured flakes of carrots. I added more sugar than is called for to add thickness to the icing, so it was rather sweet. But, the overall meshing of flavors compensated for the decadently sugary frosting. I will make this wonderful dessert again, especially for holiday parties! It is sure to be a crowd pleaser!
