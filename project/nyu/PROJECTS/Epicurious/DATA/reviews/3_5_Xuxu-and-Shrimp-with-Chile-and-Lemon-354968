My family LOVED this recipe. It is light and fresh and wonderfully "garlicky". I have made this several times.

This was my first time to use chayote, and I really enjoyed it. But the total recipe itself was bland, even after using two large jalapenos. And with all the knife work involved, I would hardly classify this as "quick & easy."

This dish was absolutely a winner with me and my family. I served it with Mexican/Spanish rice and it was a fabulous light but filling meal. I didn't use 3 chayote - 2 yielded plenty for this dish. I might try using lime juice instead of lemon next time just for a little twist.

This is a true winner. I served mine as is with no rice, mostly because I wanted a light luncheon dish, and was very happy with it this way.

I had never tasted Chiyote squash before and am now a convert. A little sweeter than cucumber, less starchy than Jicama, and holds up when sauteed a little better than some Summer squashes. I can imagine using it in any recipe in which the other vegetables are used. They're so good just peeled and eaten raw. On to this recipe; quick, easy and so fresh tasting. My family voted this a keeper to make again and again. The hearts of palm are a nice contrast, but thought to be unnecessary. One of us actually didn't think the slight vinegar taste added at all. One good sized jalapeno with seeds was enough heat. Finally, the lemon brightens the whole dish up.
