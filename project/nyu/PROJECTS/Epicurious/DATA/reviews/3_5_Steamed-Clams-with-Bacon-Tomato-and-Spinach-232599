Very flavorful and so easy to make. Pairs perfectly with fresh sourdough bread. I think this would work well with mussels as well. I'd also like to try adding a bit of white wine to the broth.

Excellent as appetizer. I think this would make a great meal too.

Have made this a dozen times. Wonderful. I have served it as a first course and a luncheon dish.

I didn't want to bother with clams so I made it with shrimp and it was wonderful! I have made it twice this way, and will probably never try it with clams.

Absolutely fantastic and easy too! I couldn't find clams so I used mussels instead and served it with crusty bread and olive oil. Next time I think I might try adding the white wine.

I ALSO MADE SOME CHANGES TO THIS RECIPE. I USED BASIL, WHITE WINE, AND ADDED SOME NUTMEG AND HEAVY WHIPPING CREAM AT THE END, THEN SERVED IT OVER PENNE. IT WAS WONDERFUL. EVERYONE LOVED IT.

The broth was absolutely delicious! I added 1/2 C white wine with the tomatoes and replaced the spinach with 1/4 C loosely packed basil leaves.

I give it a 2, my partner gives it a 3. We don't eat meat, so I made it without the bacon, and I served it over fresh linguine. I thought it was fine, just a typical garlicky sauce with shellfish and pasta. My partner really liked it and thinks we should make it again. We both thought the spinach was a highlight of the recipe. We ordered the clams from FreshDirect (NYC) and they were great. The crusty bread suggestion of another reviewer is a good idea. If you are looking for a very very easy (not exciting) recipe for clams, this would be good.

Stick with better existing recipes which (1) use dry chorizo instead of bacon and add minced garlic, skip the spinach, add 4+ TB each of sherry and white wine OR (2) skip the spinach and toss with chopped Italian parsley and feta cheeses chunks at the end. In either case, reduce the sauce slightly and serve all with good, crusty fresh bread. Think cataplana for show-stopping presentation - but either variation above has pleased guests aboard our boat for years.

Best steamed clams we have ever had. I can see using this recipe with linguine for a pasta course. Just fine as is with a great bread to soak up all the wonderful juice. With the local tomatoes ripe right now, just right.
