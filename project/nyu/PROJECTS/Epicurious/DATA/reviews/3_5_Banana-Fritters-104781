This is a wonderfully delicious recipe! I am shocked that someone chose to display anger and disgust at a group of kids' comments! How silly and boorish of you! I am a former teacher and it's hard to get kids motivated! If you have to use class time to do that, you've succeeded at teaching! Give me a break! No one is perfect, including yourself!

I find it odd (and a little sad) that so many people are offended by the spelling and grammar errors of a bunch of school kids, yet so few people bother remarking on the atrocious spelling, grammar and punctuation of the ADULTS who post on this website. I've been reading and posting on this website for so long that I'm almost convinced that I'm the only person left on the planet who can spell the word "definitely" correctly.

Worst case scenario: 30 teachers pick 30 random recipes for their class projects and each make their 30 students rate their recipe.

Good way to use up the over ripe bananas. Add a little rum to the batter and one has deep fried bananas Foster. i am glad to see a teacher is cooking different dishes with their students. Cooking may not teach grammer and spelling, but it sure teaches different cultures, some history, creativity, responsibility, and math. I was glad to see non food snobs rate a recipe. This is not an adults only site, but a site for those who cook.

I find canola oil is great for frying. Oh, and while I think it is wonderful that the teacher used this as a class project, I think it is appalling that he/she obviously did NOT check their students' work before they posted it for the world to see; I would be mortified if my students posted those reviews!

What is going on here? ...Insulting an obviously great teacher and his/her wonderfully culturally diversified stimulated students. This teacher not only got her students interested in cooking but also in sharing there opinions in writing to our epicurious internet family. As well as using a recipe that explores an African food slant. Plus many of these students made these at home with their own families. How ingenious! I for one (of I am sure many) welcome their comments and applaud both the teacher and his/her students. Thank you for sharing. Now I can't wait to try this simple little recipe!

Don't let the fact that this recipe (with some interesting additions) was someone's class project suggest that it's not worth trying. I've made it several times and it's really lovely with just a drizzle of honey.

Ah, yes, good food (marshmallows, chocolate and hot cheetohs) and quality time in the kitchen (hooray for "wasting" two class periods) certainly justify a classroom's use of the website to rate how "sweat" a recipe is. If a teacher is going to allow her students to use an adult site, she should have at least checked grammar, punctuation, etc. Reading these comments left me "sick in the stomach."

To "A Cook" on 12/13: While it would have been nice to see that the school teaches these kids spelling, grammar and correct punctuation, I'm really disappointed that you would admonish kids to stay away. If we don't teach our kids to cook and eat well, we diminish our society even more! My kids cook (and review) recipes from this site, and I will continue to encourage them to do so. If you don't like it, don't read them! (And kids' reviews are just as valid as adults, so don't make them feel like they're worthless!!). To the teacher, bravo for the cooking, but work on the language skills and typing!

The banana's were good and they tasted sweat. My family like banana fritters. We add fudge, cream, sprinkles, and other stuff. When I saw them I felt sick in the stomach. So after all, they were good.

It was a great dish we did in a class project. Make sure you don't put too much sugar cause then you get hyper. We added ice cream , chocolate, cinnamon and it was so good to eat. But it also makes a big mess to clean up! People should try it in case they haven't tasted it.

I liked your banana fritters they were very good. I put ice cream and put whip cream on my ice and choclate and marshmallows on it too. This is a good learning experince on how to cook foriegn foods. I want to be a chef when I grow up and cook other foriegn foods for other people. Your banana fritters are so good with ice cream thanks for putting the recipe online for people to make these tasty banana fritters. I hope I can make my very own recipe of a type of food. This was as a class project and you can put different sweets on itand chocolate syrup on it.

No offense, but these fritters were greasy and the batter was a little tough when fried. Basically, they're history.

I love this dessert because it's quick and it's hard to mess up. Before frying, I rolled the fritters in a little unsweetened coconut to add chewiness (this helped the batter stick to the bananas better, too). Make sure the oil is hot enough or they turn mushy. I also like that you can make this recipe with ingredients you're likely to have on hand -- I'm sure glad I found those bananas in the trunk of my car today. I bought them green a week ago and they slipped out of the grocery bag -- luckily I discovered them just as they were turning yellow-brown and soft, perfect for fritters!

This was tasty. We added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter and served them on ice cream and drizzled caramel chocolate sauce on them--which was delicious, but very, very rich. Even without the added ice cream and sauce, this recipe can feed more than four people (maybe six?). If you have leftovers, you can reheat them in a toaster oven and they are still good.

Wow - cooking in peanut oil adds SO much dimension to the flavor, it's worth the cost - though 3" is a bit deep(I used about 1/2). I speak as a chef of 18 years, and am of the school that simplicity is its own reward. The one other minor change I would make is to cut the banana into quarters. But that's just me.
