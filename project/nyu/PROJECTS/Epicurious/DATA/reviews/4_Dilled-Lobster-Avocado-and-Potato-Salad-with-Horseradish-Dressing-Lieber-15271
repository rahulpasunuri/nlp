I substituted shrimp green onion and sherry vinegar and also added a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice. It was even better with this tweaking

I used fresh cooked Dungeness crab instead of lobster. Everyone loved it.

Being true to the rating system, this dish was great, but not beyond compare. Just a very, very good and unusual potato salad. Being in land-locked Indiana where lobsters don't tend to show their briney little heads, I used a top quality canned lumpmeat crab. I also served this over blanched and chilled haricote verts, which was beautiful and delicious. I made the potato salad the night before, but added the avacado and crab at the last minute. The flavor of the horseradish was terrific!

This is a fantastic recipe if you can afford the lobster. It's rich and delicious.

We used a lb of shrimp and it was fabulous (3 1/2 *). We put it atop mixed baby greens with a light homemade vinaigrette (didn't use watercress, but will try next time). My husband guarded the leftovers!

The combination of dill, lobster, and advocado tasted terrific. The second time around I decreased the dill and increased the advocado. My husband and I enjoyed it better the second time around.

Also great when substituting shrimp.

This is a beautiful summer recipe. I serve the potato salad (without the lobster and avocado) on the bed of watercress and put the avocado and lobster on top (more colorful this way). I have also served a simplified version as an appetizer at cocktail parties on toasted french bread rounds (potato salad with a sprig of watercress and a chunk of lobster on top).

Tried this recipe for the first time and it was great. It was delicious and my guest thought so too. Used the red wine vinegar rather than the horseradish. This will be a standard dish when entertaining during the remainder of the summer.
