My son loves this cake. You do need to be careful not to overbake, and it is not very sweet. Better as a snack than dessert. My son also has extensive food allergies, and this cake works with his dietary needs. I also live at a high altitude, so I tweak the recipe a bit to deal with that.

This was a huge disappointment. The name implied an intense chocolate flavor, but this was very bland. I wouldn't bother trying this again.

It's hard to believe anyone at the magazine tested this recipe. Dry, bland, time consuming and very messy. I salvaged it by turning it into a very good bread pudding.Will not make again.

This is a tasty snack cake but would not consider a "dessert". I baked exactly as recipe indicated and did not find it to be too dry. In fact, I would recommend allowing to cool in the pan for maybe 30-45 minutes so it can set. I turned out onto a rack and it fell apart. Still good, but kind of a mess!

This was such a disappointment! I agree w/the last reviewer who said it was a "waste of ingredients". And, I wish I'd have read the other reviews; this was so time- consuming and just NOT worth the effort. There are other better chocolate desserts out there! Would not make it again.

This was not "deep" in flavor, bland and dry. Waste of ingredients.

I decided to make this pound cake this morning. I put it in the oven at 325 degrees and I also added a cookie sheet under the loaf pan to keep the cake from burning on the bottom. THEN I sat down at the computer, and read all the reviews. Don't ya love my timing? Ok, so taking all these comments into consideration, I started checking the cake carefully at 40 minutes and pulled it while the center was still a little liquidy. It firmed up as it cooled and as a consequence, this pound cake was not dry at all. However it was neither dark in color, nor deep in flavor. It would appeal to children, but not to me, a chocolate lover.

This is alright. It isn't the best cake ever, but simple enough for a weeknight dessert. The kids absolutely love it, though. Here's a hint--don't trust the tester for doneness. If you hit a chip or two, it will look wet regardless of whether the cake is done or not.

I too found it dry. So much work for so little reward. I could have made a 3 course meal with all the bowls and whisks this dirtied.

I made this the day after my issue arrived (quite late this month) and it sounded so good...the flavor was pretty good and the softened mini chips were great, but the cake was on the dry side. I'm sure I didn't overbake it because I tested carefully. There's a similar recipe in The Bread Bible (also in The Cake Bible w/out the mini chips) by Rose Berenbaum that has a much larger proportion of butter/eggs to flour and omits the milk/sour cream so I think that one will be much more to my liking.

Delicious using skim milk and light sour cream! I added extra chocolate chips and used 60% cacao chocolate.

I should have read the New Jersey reviewer's comments before baking this cake. It was very dry, and I should have suspected it would be, given the small quantity of butter and eggs. But it sure looked nice in the pan! No, I don't think I'll try it again either.

This seemed to take forever to bake until a toothpick came our clean, so I might have baked it too long. However, I bake a lot and have made pound cake many times before, and have never had one be so dry. It had little chocolate flavor despite the addition of chips. Don't think I'll try this one again.

When I saw this recipe in my new issue I had to make it TODAY. I took this cake out of the oven only 30 minutes ago, so it is still warm, but I had to dig in. Further analysis requires me to include a couple of cautionary statements: Don't use a dark loaf pan (like ones used to "brown" meatloaf - all I had - note to self - will throw away and buy normal pan), it cooks too quickly on the outside; don't over- bake as it will be a death sentence of dryness for this and all pound cakes I have ever made. Mine is right on the edge of "too done" because of the darn dark loaf pan (not thinking, bummer). As noted in the 3 forks, I still wouldn't give up on this one. This recipe has the makings of greatness; simplicity, ingredients in most pantries, fairly quick preparation. In all fairness, I subbed light sour cream, 2% milk, and used roughly chopped bittersweet chocolate for similar ingredients. All seems acceptable. Just watch that pan and don't over bake!!! Great flavor anyway.
