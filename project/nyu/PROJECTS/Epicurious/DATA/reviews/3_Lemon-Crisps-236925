Awful! I can't even give it one fork. So dry - slicing the dough was like slicing through a sand castle. What a waste of time.

The lemon flavor is strong, but I like that. That's all I can say about these though. The texture is weird and I question how healthy they are since they call for only yolks. There are plenty of lemon cookie recipes out there- I don't need to repeat these.

The dough was very wet so I ended up adding a little more sugar and flour. I didn't have time to let the dough sit in the fridge for several hours so I stuck it in the freezer. This seemed to work fine, and I was able to slice it thin enough to make more cookies than the recipe predicted. The cookies themselves needed a little something, so I made a simple glaze with OJ in it. They turned out pretty good!

These are kind of terrible. The taste doesn't balance out. It tastes floury and like raw lemons at the same time. I took the advice of the other reviewers...but really they just turned out to not taste good. We ended throwing the whole batch away. It was sad and disappointing. While they may be better for you than some other cookie receipts...this is one i'd pass on.

Oh-I also took the extra yolk & vanilla advice. Great help! Thanks!

Made these to temper all the chocolate cookies I made for Christmas. I added extra zest, lemon extract to the egg wash and still, they could have been more lemony for my taste. I cut them a little bit thicker and the texture was fabulous. Can't wait to make them again-but this time with more lemon. I used baker's sugar for the top which was delicious.

You just gotta love these!! Try some with egg nog.

These cookies are pretty yummy, especially for being relatively low-fat. I added an extra egg yolk as another reviewer suggested and the cookies came out cakey and moist. They were perfectly baked at 12 minutes.

These cookies have a very nice light lemony flavor, but are a bit dry. I'll add more fat (either more butter or another egg yolk) next time. A little more lemon juice might also be good. I also upped the vanilla to 1 tsp. and used the zest of 1.5 lemons. Tasty!
