My husband is a huge pepper hound and he's always lamenting the lack of available fruit-based salsas. I made this for him on a whim one afternoon and he couldn't scarf it down fast enough. I was a hero for like three days. It's a beautiful, easy, and sharply favored salsa. Highly recommend.

This salsa is a little unconventional, but I love it. Its very adaptable to whatever you have on hand. I often use mango instead of papaya, and I love to add tomatillos when they are available. It goes well with many foods; my favorite is with a breakfast burrito.

Very good, easy salsa recipe. It's good on grilled meats, with chips, and also with fried plantain chips.

Outstanding on all grilled fish! Served this the other night to company over halibut and once again got rave reviews from the guests!

I have been making this for years now, and it's one of my favorites. The raves never stop with this one. I never put any oils in it. I have simplified it to a one, one and one concept. To easy!

I made this recipe but used diced fresh peaches and honeydew melon in place of the papayas and pineapples. I also used a few tablespoons of canned Ortega diced chilies in place of fresh jalapenos and it turned out GREAT! It was a hit at our family reunion, where several asked for the recipe. Definitely a keeper.

This was a wonderful recipe, served it over grilled sea bass for a summer evening dinner party, and got rave reviews. The heat of the jalapeno contrasts great with the sweet papaya.

Fantastic! I served it over grilled swordfish, and then with scrambled eggs the next day. Delicious both ways.

I can't believe no one has reviewed this yet! I hope that doesn't mean no one has tried this, because it is great! I make it frequently and use on a variety of fish. Everyone loves it and it has a beautiful presentation.
