First time ever made, I used anchovy paste instead of whole anchovies, that way I can store it in my fridge for a while. I think I will use more than 1 TBSP next time. But will surely make it again.

I add chunks of onion to the pot first frying until soft. This is a great simple and fast recipe. I buy the pitted Kalamata olives that my local super market has in bulk.

Quick and easy sauce, but like others I add more garlic and red pepper. I also add 5 mins before serving some sliced zucchini and bell pepper that I cook separately

Very quick, easy and tasty, I added fresh chopped asparagus and sauted it with the garlic. I didn't have any anchovies so I added a little extra sea salt. I will make this again.

Very easy and tasty recipe. Made it last night for dinner party - guests really enjoyed it. I only made one change - doubled the amount of anchovies called for (no need to chop them). Also simmered sauce for about 30min.

The only mistake I made was not to serve it with crusty bread to sop up that wonderful sauce. I took the other reviewers' advice and used 7 anchovy fillets and upped the red pepper to 3/4 tsp. I also increased the garlic which I don't think was necessary. My husband is still saying how good that was.... and that is unusual. The sauce didn't thicken as much as I would have liked it to but I will try another brand next time. Yum!

An excellent puttanesca recipe! I made the recipe as written, and both I and my roommates absolutely loved it. Doubled, it made enough for four people with leftovers. I may up the anchovies and pepper next time, per folks' suggestions, and experimenting with meat or seafood sounds like it could be fun.

This was indeed exceptional!! After reading the other reviews, I too doubled the anchovies and the crushed red pepper. I also added some crushed tomatoes and pasta water and let it simmer for quite some time. My husband raved about it.. then I told him there were anchovies in it and he said "I hate anchovies!!" I was just very flavorful, delicious, and easy!!

Finding it hard to disagree with the 46 other reviewers who gave this four forks... really this is just SO easy and so delicious. The sauce cooks in exactly the same time as the pasta and it is so quick to get started. Just the weeknight dinner I've been hoping to find!

After returning from a trip to Italy I craved many of the dishes I had there. I searched for a highly rated puttanesca recipe and decided to make this one since it only took 15 min. This was one of the easiest and most authentic italian recipes I've created! I added chicken breast to the leftovers and loved it even more. I plan on making this often with just a few minor changes: next time I'll double or even triple the recipe and double the anchovies and red pepper for more kick.

Love, Love this recipe. It is a great quick go-to meal. I had all the ingredients in my fridge or pantry alraedy available. The flavors in this dish really come out..

I've made this sauce 3 times now, always great. Twice with pasta and once on fish which was excellent. Third time I mixed all the ingredients except the garlic in a blender first then added them to the pan. I would definitely recommend that if you like a smoother sauce.

I made this just as written. Next time I will up the olives (Kalamata) and the anchovies. I'll also consider on reviewer's idea of adding seafood, but will often just do it as it is. Overall, a very good dish.

Yep, this is my new Puttanesca recipe for life. I tripled the recipe to serve 12 and it was perfect with just a bit for leftovers. (yay!) I left out the anchovies as was serving vegetarians and increased the salty capers to make up for it. I think this is a fool proof recipe!

Definitely a quick and easy recipe. i used whole wheat pasta to make a little healthier... couldn't taste the difference. The key is San Marzano tomatoes and the anchovies! Delish!

A great recipe. I add 4 or 5 chopped sun dried toms. I also add shrimp, scallops, calamari, littlenecks and mussels and serve it over linguini. I soak a couple of pieces of bread with xvo and chopped garlic and grill it up to perfection on the gas grill. Serve with a Malbec or hearty Zin and GOOOD GOD ALMIGHTY!

This is excellent! Based on other reviews, I added an extra teaspoon of anchovy paste. I also simmered it for a bit longer than recommended in order to bring the flavors together more, and added a bit of rosemary and basil (none in the tomatoes). I also used black olives, to please the resident child. Luckily said child adored it. We'll work on the olive preference, but for now, it's great to have a flavorful, and super quick and easy pasta dish to serve.

Made for tonight's dinner and it was fast, easy and very delicious. Used about 6-7 anchovy fillets. I did not have Kalamata olives so they were omitted, but not intentionally. Also added extra tomato sauce only because I wanted it to simmer much longer than the suggested 8 minutes. Three-year-old gobbled it up! Will definitely make again.

Just great, and so easy. This is a favorite of my 11 year old. So easy he can make it with just a little mom assistance with the boiling water.

I made this dish for supper last night and it was a hit. I added 1-2 tsp. of sugar and used fresh basil instead of the one in the can. Also used linguine and it was delish!! Will be making it again.

I made this tonight for dinner and it is truly a keeper. One of the best pasta dishes I have tried. I use Italian tomatoes and added the basil at the end, as there were none in the can.

Made the sauce, then sauted chicken breasts (a la the Chicken Provencal recipe on Epicurious) and added sauce to chicken and simmered for 20 minutes or so. Then, I made risotto and served the two dishes together. It was divine!

One of my absolute favorite quick go-to recipes (though I do add more pepper flakes out of personal preference). I'd make this twice a week if I was just cooking for myself. Full flavors work well together, plus you have the comfort of a big bowl of pasta and crusty bread...what more could you want?

I have made this several times, and my family has loved it each time. Have used both anchovy paste and fillets and both versions have been great. My teenagers were not wild about the olives, so I used less and chopped them instead of halves. Also added a tablespoon of tomato paste

This was such a great recipe because of how easy it was to make and how delicious the outcome was. I followed the recipe except for a couple things: I added a can of artichoke hearts which I chopped just for fun, and I added an extra smaller can of diced tomatoes along with everything else so I can have more of it! The anchovies are definitely key. I've made puttanesca before without it and what a difference it makes! Also, try to use good quality kalamata olives. I didn't need to add any salt to the sauce because the olives were salty enough. I also used the leftover olive juice in the water to boil the pasta for added goodness in the pasta. I want to have a dinner party just so I can feed this to friends and family!

OMG this was amazing! I invited a friend for dinner who asked if he could bring mutual friends, one who is a Italian Restaurant owner and her Italian cheif boyfriends. Well I was a little nervous when making this because it was so easy. I also used the Anchovy paste. My guest could not stop raving! And my new friend the boyfriend cheif gave me a tip, drizzle the pasta with lots of olive oil right before serveing. It was great and so easy!

Delicious, and so fast! Remembering how much I loved puttanesca when I ate it at a place where I waitressed in high school and realizing I had all the ingredients around, I threw this together this afternoon. It's seriously delicious, and I cannot stress enough the importance of using the anchovy fillets as directed. The sauce does NOT taste fishy or even anchovy-ish, given the small quantity; the fillets just give a depth of flavor and meatiness whose absence might just make the sauce taste too tart and briny. Also, if you want a sweeter, thicker sauce, try using a can of crushed tomatoes with basil, as I did because it was all I had around, and simmering for much longer than the eight minutes listed minutes to let the flavors meld. I recommend omitting the parmesan -- it somewhat masks the piquancy and freshness -- and upping the amount of parsley, too. I think this just might be what turns my olive-averse boyfriend onto olives...

My fiance and I don't particularly like puttanesca sauce but had some capers that we needed to use. This was fantastic - we literally licked the plates! If you chop the anchovies quite well you won't know that they're in there, except for the fact that they add a lovely flavor.

This recipe was very easy and quick to make. I used anchovy paste instead of fillets, because I knew my boyfriend wouldn't eat it otherwise. I think for the speed and ease of cooking, while still tasting good and homemade, it gets four forks.

The sauce is delicious! Simple to make yet lively in taste. Not sure why other reviewers thought the sauce was thin. Used a 28 oz can of San Marzano's with remaining ingredients as directed and one exception, used .5 Tsp of Anchovy paste. Could not have been better if were in Italy.

Easy, sublime and flavorful -- everyone loved it -- even my 8-yr-old. Nice to add a main dish to my regular rotation that doesn't feature meat. It's not a "knock your socks off!" kind of recipe (hence only the three stars), but a good basic weeknight meal that tastes great. This will be a regular at our house.

I am not a fan of Puttanesca, but my husband requested it. I made it exactly as the recipe states and must say I enjoyed it very much. Doubled the anchovies om my husbands plate and he was delighted.

This is a very tasty and easy to make sauce. I added some tomato paste, as suggested by one of the other reviewers, which gave the sauce some more depth and offset the saltiness. I have found that the olives used will affect the outcome--the saltier and brinier, the more pungent the sauce. Finally, the second time I added some steamed, cubed eggplant (the steaming takes some bitterness out and it softens the eggplant so that it blends well with the rest of the ingredients). I guess it isn't a classic puttanesca that way, but we liked it.

Easy and delicious...my favorite combo. Served to individuals who don't like one or more of the stronger ingredients, and they loved it. I did simmer it for about 20 minutes to really blend the flavors. Couldn't find the tomatoes they called for so used canned diced tomatoes and added fresh basil. Was great.

Rating: 3
Delish. Doubled anchovies and sauteed them with garlic and chili pepper before adding rest of ingredients. Also added two tablespoons or so of tomato paste to thicken up a tad. (Still on the thinner side.) And was very liberal with parsley. All the elements seemed well-balanced and blended deliciously.

Very tasty. I used regular tomatoes and added dried basil, and I had fresh oregano on hand. Next time I make it, I'll use less red pepper and fewer olives.
