Delicious! Everyone loved it. I poured only 2/3 cup of the syrup (instead of the full 1 cup) over the top. Make sure you cover the rim of the pie with foil in the oven so it doesn't get too brown while the rest of it is still baking. Since it is rather a plain looking pie, I recommend sprinkling some powdered sugar on the top next time. Served it with strawberries on the side.

This is a wonderful dessert for a crowd. The sweetness of the syrup enhances the custard. Keeps for a while in the fridge.

Try topping it with fresh blackberries and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Yum!

This was so good - a perfect end to a Greek meal. My guests loved it. Don't worry if the custard seems undercooked at first. Once it cools, it is perfect. The sauce was delicious - just a nice hint of orange and it soaked into the pie once it sat for a bit. A keeper in our house, for sure!

I was going to make Baklava for our cooking club Greek dinner, but came across this. A nice change from the well know Baklava, and just as tasty. This is definitely a 'do it again' dish and it really didn't take all that much working time to prepare.

Made this for a friend's birthday. Galactoboureko is his favorite. Changes: I used a 1 1/2 batch of the custard (with less sugar) and assembled it in a 9x12 cakepan (the phyllo sheets are perfectly shaped for this pan), and used only about 1/2 of the syrup on the top. Tasted good and my friend was happy.

My family and I loved this and I'll definitely make it again. I think it would be a good holiday dessert.

Delicious! Thanks to the previous cook from Lesvos, Greece for the tip about individual pies. I used two sheets of phyllo buttered together, cut it into three strips and using a heaped tablespoon of custard folded it into a triangle shape all the way down the length of the strip. Yes, it took a long time to fold the 21 pies, but the individual size was perfect for our large group. Luckily there was lots of other food so there were a few over to enjoy the next day. I did find the syrup ran off quickly due to brushing it with butter before baking.

I'm from Greece and the way I make it is I prepare the custard (everyone has their own recipe). Then I cut the phyllo sheets all into two long stips. If it is thin phyllo, I take two strips, brush them both with melted butter and put one over the other. Put a heaping tablespoon custard at the bottom of the strip, turn in the sides (butter the seams), and roll up (butter the seam). Brush with melted butter and bake till golden. Then dunk the hot pies into cold syrup and let excess drip off. This makes individual servings and they aren't soggy because the extra syrup comes off. You can strain the extra and keep it in the refrigerator for next time.

I was disappointed with this recipe. It tasted good, but was very soggy. I served it at room temperature and wonder if I had refrigerated it, if it would have been firmer.

I made this recipe yesterday for a family brunch and I must say that I did not agree with the glowing reviews (and neither did anyone else in my family). It was just so-so, nothing spectacular. I found the instructions to be a bit vague; for example, I cut my phyllo sheets in half because a full sheet was just way too big for a standard-sized pie pan. The pie looked great and I thought the syrup topping was reminiscent of baklava but otherwise it was more work than it was worth.

My husband loves this dessert when we visit Tarpon Springs, Fla., but I would increase the custard quantity just a tad next time. Great flavor, and not too much fuss. Wonderful!

Outstanding recipe! Served at a family gathering and it was a huge success. Well worth the effort. I added a dash of Boyajian Pure Orange Oil to the syrup and custard.

This is the first recipe I have given a 4 to and it really is worth it. I have made it twice for Greek dinners. I made the syrup and filling the day before so that I could make the pie the day of the dinner. Don’t be afraid of filo! This one is worth the fuss.
