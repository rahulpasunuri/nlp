Followed recipe exactly. The best I can say for it is that it's edible and very healthy. I make a lot of vegetarian soups, and this is incredibly bland and not particularly enjoyable. Definitely not worth the effort.

I made this with canned cannellini beans, a bag of chopped kale from Trader Joe's, lo-sodium chicken broth (instead of water), and sauteed 4 oz. of pancetta along with a chopped onion before adding all the other ingredients. This is Italian style comfort food!

Had been looking for a way to add more greens and beans to my diet, and this meatless soup makes a great healthy lunch. I used a defatted homemade ham stock (but no ham) to replace about half of the cooking liquid. Very flavorful!

This was sort of icky with a curious slime-like gruel consistency and color. Followed this (and the other) recipe exactly, although I added some sliced Italian sausage at the end. Blech.

Terrific! I agree that starting with dried beans is the way to go! I soaked the beans overnight, and found that they were done in only 50 minutes. I also added about 2 cups of chicken broth to the soup along with the 4 cups of bean cooking liquid. I prefer less tomato, so I used 1 cup of canned whole tomatoes, without the liquid, and crushed them by hand into the pot. I'm looking forward to making the second pot tomorrow, and will try with Italian sausage!

Tasty, takes a bit of work and time but tastes great! It is tough to find a good kale soup that is meatless but still tasty.

Very good and a great way to use our Kale from the garden.

Love it! Made the kale and cannellini recipe and used those in the soup. What a combination of flavors. A little tartness from the lemon juice, kick from the red pepper flakes. It was a great soup. This is definitely going into my starting lineup for soups this winter.

This is a keeper. Take the extra step and use the dry beans to get the hearty thick vegetarian broth. My husband who claims he does not like kale was a big fan. It would be great with some italian sausage for a meat "fix"

Excellent, hearty, and very moreish soup! I improvised this from scratch as I hadn't made the Cannellini Beans with Kale prior to making the soup. In cheater's terms what this means is: - minced 5 cloves garlic - diced 2 small onions - chopped 1 medium carrot - chopped 3 stalks celery Sauteed above with olive oil and generous portion of Italian seasoning over medium until the onions began to yellow (about 15min) Added boiling water from my kettle along with 2 bay leaves, 2 tsp of vegetable bouillon granules. Simmered for about 10min Then added 2 cans of cannellini beans, 1 can of diced tomatoes in juice, and 4 packed cups of curly kale (thick stems removed and coarsely chopped). Covered the pot and let it simmer for about 30min while stirring ever so often. When the kale became soft I put my immersion blender in and whizzed it around until I had a nice consistency. Served into a bowl and topped it with parmigiano and it was good to go!

One of the best soups I have ever made! So delicious. Instead of using dried Cannellini Beans I used canned. For the cooking liquid I followed the "Cannellini Beans with kale" recipe but without cooking the dried beans. Started with cooking the onions and garlic in olive oil, added sage, salt, bay leaf and 4 cups of water. Simmered for 10 mins or so then added the chopped kale and simmered for another 20 mins or so. Finished with adding lemon juice and red pepper. Meanwhile I was cooking the carrots and celery in another pan. When the broth was done I added the carrots, celery, beans, tomatoes, and italian seasoning to the broth and continued to simmer for another 10-15 mins. It turned out so well without the work of the dried beans! served with a toasted baguette topped and toasted with leftover tomatoes and goat cheese!! YUMMMMMMMMMMMM Enjoy! http://crafterina.blogspot.com/

Great and I am not a bean lover. Maybe next time less beans for me. I did do the bruchetta and loved it. That was also the selling point for our five year old. Yum!

skipped the toasts and went straight for the soup - my self-proclaimed "kale hater" husband even loved it! definitely a keeper.

This is a keeper. We skipped the bruschetta part of the recipe and went straight to the soup with the cannellinis and kale. Like many soups, even better the next day.

Great soup for a cold Fall day. Vegetarians would love this. I ended up putting in a couple of slices of garlicy/smokey linguica to make it even more hearty.

A hearty, flavorful vegetarian soup that is easy to make. Kale was slightly bitter, so I might try the recipe next time with a "lighter" green such as swiss chard.
