I have been making the Grilled Corn Salad this recipe goes with since it first appeared in the magazine and this sauce really elevates the dish to something spectacular. I've used leftover sauce on grilled pork or chicken after, since we usually have quite a lot of sauce left over (We pass sauce separately from the salad, since our family gatherings often include lots of kids who can be particular.) I've even used to dress other salads.

We used it as a barbeque sauce on a boneless loin of pork. Apply it in the last five minutes and be generous. The sauce is then served at the meal for dipping. It was very popular at a gathering to which we took it. We made several batches for the freezer. You can oven-roast the peppers on a cookie sheet for 35 min @ 375 and the tomatoes same for 20 min.
