I used tinned crab meat and topped it with with flash cooked langoustine. I also used brown risotto rice which though it takes longer, is worth it for the flavor. Japanese dashi was the broth and if you keep the dashi watered down so it doesn't overwhelm the other flavors, it turns out nicely. I would make it again as I am on a diet and it is a satisfying and healthy dish.

I used the 8 oz of crab, plus a small collection of calamari, mussels, and shrimp. I also used a bit more parmesan and added one or two oz of pancetta to make it more rich. Really quite excellent!

This dish had a nice flavor but was not as flavorful as I would have liked. I would add more mint, lemon zest and cheese the next time I make it. I agree that you can't really taste the crab, but maybe when we go to heat the leftovers up the taste will be more apparent. Unsure if I would make this again.

This was simply delicious. Used store- bought Seafood Stock as the liquid. The combination of mint, lemon zest, and crab was greater than the sum of its parts. Of course, you need good-quality ingredients. Worth the time spent standing at the stove, stirring.

I made this according to the recipe and using the full 8 oz of lump crab rather than 6oz. The subtle flavoring is more evident after the dish has cooled to room temperature. When tasted hot it seemed to need more crab, once it cooled I could taste the crab, mint and lemon. I will make this again.
