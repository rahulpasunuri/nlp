I've been making this recipe for years now and make it at least a couple of times every summer. I disagree with other reviewers, though. Heirloom tomatoes are best, especially in a variety of colors. While I like it just as written, this recipe also adapts very well to whatever I have on hand. Oregano and thyme with feta cheese instead of basil and parsley is excellent also.

This is a great "base" for a good side pasta salad. My go to reciepe for events. Sometimes I leave out the olives, Very good adding grilled vedg and or feta - or other cheese. sometimes I throw in what it in the fridge - that is why I love it.

Orzo salads are so flexible..this one rocks. I did add some fresh corn to make it extra summery. Took the advice about cutting the dressing a bit.

Pfff.. heirloom tomatoes, I've made with any tomatoes and this is excellent. My quests always love it. Add, subtract oil to your liking. Peace.

I thought this was delicious after it sat at room temperature and marinated for a bit. I used fresh herbs and heirloom tomatoes from my garden, but a little less mint and more basil than called for. I also kept the olives on the side because my husband does not like them. It was good with or without olives.

Addendum to last review: the salad does turn out quite wet but I think if the tomatoes are seeded before adding to the orzo this problem will be solved. Do add feta!

"Heirloom tomato" is so faddish. I grow both heirlooms and hybrids, and they are equally good. That said, we like this salad. I followed Long Beach's advice to add feta (feta improves anything but chocolate) and we like ths salad enough to make it permanent repertoire.

I love reviews that add or change so much of the recipe. When a review starts out "I used beef instead of chicken," you know either the review is flawed or the recipe is. Anyway, there is a lot of dressing, but if you make this in advance and refrigerate it the pasta absorbs the dressing. Adjust the green onion to your taste, and a little more basil never hurt anyone. A good summer salad.

Using this recipe as a start with several changes turns it into the most delicious summer salad. I add chopped black olives, freshly roasted pine nuts and crumbled Feta cheese. I replace the heirloom tomatoes with whole cherry tomatoes and add about 1/2 cup chopped cilantro instead of the parsley. I also reduce the olive oil for the dressing to 1/4 to 1/3 cup. For spice lovers add a sprinles of ground chilies ... for extra protein add cubed skim milk mozarella cheese. Perfect fora summer garden party - and quick to make with chopped olives and crumbled Feta cheese from Trader Joes.

WAY too much green onion, overpowered the taste of everything else, which I realized the minute I stirred in the green onion (and then it was too late to fix). If I tried this dish again, I would add onion sparingly and rely on the flavors of the herbs, especially basil, to season the dish.

Next time I'll double the herbs, but I loved it! I also didn't "dump" all the dressing on - only enough to moisten the orzo... leftover dressing is great for regular salad...

I made this recipe several times last summer and liked it best when I used slightly larger pasta (such as the mini farfalle).

This was a delicious side dish.

I thought this dish would be a nice, clean way to showcase the summer's tomatoes, but instead the flavor turned out muddied, and the dressing measurements made way too much. Once the tomatoes started exuding their liquid, the whole dish began to border on soup.

This was a really nice way to use tomatoes when there are so many and you need a change. It's a pretty presentation too! I would add a little more spice and so much orzo and oil made it a little bland but overall really good.

This is such a light and wonderful summer salad. The flavors blend so well and my guests were very pleased.

This was a very nice simple dish and I will definitely make it again. I think the choice of tomatoes is key. I selected the last of the heirlooms at my local grocer, but I probably should have held out for the farmer's market. Also, I would add a smidge less oil and a bit more herbs.
