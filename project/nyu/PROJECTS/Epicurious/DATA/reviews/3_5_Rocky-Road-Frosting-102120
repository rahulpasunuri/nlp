This frosting is very good but almost too sweet. I tasted it when I had only added 2 cups of sugar and in my opinion it was better than with the 3rd. It had more chocolate flavor. If I made it again I would only use two. I believe that it will still thicken nicely if the ice bath is used.

Wow, what a great tasting frosting. I agree with the one chef who didn't put the frosting over an ice bath to cool. Mine seemed to come together after beating in the sugar. For an authentic touch, I chopped more marshmallow and walnuts into the frosting and covered jumbo chocolate cupcakes with it. It was a hit at my Chargers football tailgate, and easy for everyone to eat.

I made this frosting to cover a sheet cake for the 4th of July. I only had chocolate chips on hand, but my guests really liked it anyway. I found no need to beat the frosting over ice. It thickend quickly and I was able to pour it over my cake like thick glaze.

This is a fantastic, almost fudge-like frosting. Great for cupcakes! It thickened up as soon as I put in the sugar; I didn't need to beat it. Be sure to take it off the ice, however, once it's thick or it will lose its glossy sheen.

What a great frosting -- the kids love the marshmallow part! Unfortunately, the cake recipe that goes with this frosting isn't even worth mentioning....

This delicious chocolate frosting is a delight to work with. The marshmallows give it a consistency that allows for very smooth frosting. It is even suitable for an alternative base for cake decorating.
