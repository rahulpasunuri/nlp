I was glad for the warning that another thought it was a disaster. I envisioned the same situation as when a pie boils over and welds to the oven! I made the puree with Mango Snapple, a cinnamon stick, a little fresh lime juice, and sweetened after it had boiled down. After pureeing, I oiled the pan and spread the mixture to a depth of about 1/4 inch. At 200 degrees, after an hour, it still wasn't dry. I turned the oven off and left it overnight and by morning it was dry enough to remove. I sprayed Pam on the spatula when I push/rolled it off the pan. It is delicious and I imagine it will make a great substitute for the relatively tasteless store-bought dried apricots.

this was a complete disaster for me. i DO take full responsibility as i've never attempted fruit leather before. it did inspire me though and i have made a variation of this with store bought fruit [cherry] leather, a VERY soft mild goat cheese, and coarsley chopped pecans. i couldn't use the apricot leather for the hors d'oeuvre, but it was delicious as a snack.

This unattractively named snack, also known as "Amardeen", has been eaten and enjoyed by children and adults all over the Middle East for GENERATIONS. Don't expect a flimsy little fruit roll. This is a toothsome treat. If you do not have the time to make it yourself, it can be purchased at most Mediterranean markets.
