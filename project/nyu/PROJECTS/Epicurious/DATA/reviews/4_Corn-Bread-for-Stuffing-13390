I have been using this recipe since it was first published in Gourmet in November 1984. The only difference is that the 1984 version has you use 1 1/3 cup cornmeal rather than 1 1/2.

Really close to my favorite cornbread recipe, and not at all dry if you want to use it as regular cornbread. Toasting it in the oven gives it a nice "roasted" flavor that adds to the stuffing.
