This is a simple and healthy dish that comes together very quickly and tastes great. I made it as written using arugula, but I did use just half the amount of olive oil called for. In the future, I think I would saute the shallots and tomatoes in the oil first and then add the lemon juice and capers. I think that would enhance the flavor even more. I served it with a chickpea salad with kalamata olives, herbs, olive oil, onions. Good combination.

I sauteed the shallots and a bit of onion and added tomatoes and capers as per one cook's review and used half the olive oil in the recipe. It was delicious and we will definitely make it again.

This is a wonderful springtime recipe served with pasta with asparagus and snap peas. I have been making this since it was originally printed in 1992. Love it.

Truly yummy! Followed exactly the first time and really liked it. A year later, my hubby grew arugula and I wanted to use it with some super fresh salmon I'd just purchased. Didn't have shallots and substituted half clove of garlic, and and poached the salmon in half chicken broth/half worchestershire. Turned out delicious! Will prepare again & again. Absolutely simple, absolutely fantastic!

simple but brilliant flavor, presentation (Arugula is beautiful, IMO), and texture. A must-do redo.

Super easy and delicious week night meal. I lightly sautéed some Vidalia onions instead of the shallot and adding the capers and tomatoes with the onion to warm through and just slightly start to break down the tomato. Just before serving I tossed all with the arugula to make a nice warm salad to top the fish with.

very nice dish and easy. we did use arugula. basil and parsley are not my choices for a salad green. we also added shaved pecorino on top and some roasted potatoes on the side. fresh foccaccia would have really made the meal but we didn't have the chance to make it. would make it again for sure.

I think this dish was exceptional, especially for the ease with which it can be made. A simple, quick dinner night; or even if you need a dish for company but don't have all night to prepare. I probably doubled the arugula, but i love arugula.

Made it as written, except I used lime because I didn't have lemon. The flavors are exquisite. The shallot is a key ingredient.

I have to say, I was a little nonplussed with this dish. I would definitely make it again, but maybe add some more flair to the salmon with dijon mustard and add a little more flavor to the salad mix, perhaps with some balsamic.

I too have made this recipe many many times with a variety of different herbs. Always a hit and a great easy improssive dish.

i've made this a million times... to serve with fish (salmon or others) and also to have as a bruschetta type salsa... it's great every time and even better after a day in the fridge... i do tend to be much more liberal with all the ingredients added to the argula and tomatoes though... my heavy hand gives the recipe all the extra kick of flavor it needs...

Made some small adjustments: Sauteed sliced shallots with garlic sprouts and capers in olive oil. Added this mix to fresh baby arugula, halved pear tomatoes and warm orzo. Drizzled with a bit more olive oil and the juice of half a lemon then seasoned with salt & pepper. Spread at the bottom of a serving dish and topped with the sauteed salmon. Delicious, light and easy.

Pretty good, nice flavors, but you do feel like you're eating healthy (sacrificing a little). I served it with ciabatta with tapenade and a vegetable medley. I had extra tomato mixture so I served that on some toasted ciabatta. Good for something as healthy as this, but not a treat.

Light, lovely, and luscious......

Delicious. Simple to make and it presents well. I used both arugula and basil. Dice the tomatoes quite fine. Works well over any simply grilled fish-I'm going to try it on a grilled veal chop next. (I cut back on the oil and as another reviewer suggested-use a really tasty one!

Easy recipe but nothing special, moving onto something better.

This was so yummy! I used basil instead of arugula, and I actually sauted onion, garlic, canned tomates, basil and capers in a skillet with the olive oil. I added the lemon juice at the end, and then put it over the top of the salmon. The salmon took about 8 minutes to cook, as opposed to 4. I served it with balsalmic roasted asparagus and crusty bread. Yum :)

Excellent!! Very quick, easy and flavorful. I served with green beans and with the tomatoes in the sauce it was attractive as well as delicious. A winner!

I took some liberties with this recipe. First was a 14.5 ounce can of diced tomatoes, drained. Then I doubled the amount of arugula (the garden is producing a whole poop-load this year---a cleaned up version of an official unit of Southern measurement). Next, two 6 ounce salmon fillets for just the Fair Maiden and myself. And, finally---presentation! (I've been watching a lot of Great Chefs of the World this year since getting laid-off due to the Bush economic reforms). The salmon demanded to be served on top of the arugula mixture with a bit of lemon juice and the lemon slices for garnish---sliced to the center and slightly twisted.

This is a lovely dish. It has all the elements I look for in a recipe-quick and simple,healthy(cut back a bit on the oil but use a really good one),great flavour combination and attractive on the plate-what more could you ask for? It is a great week-night family meal and works just as well a the centrepiece of a summer dinner for friends.

I used the basil instead of arugula and it was delicious and a nice change from the way I often make salmon. I will make it again this summer with the basil from my garden. It's simple, but it is a nice touch to put a homemade mixture on top of it when grilled.

Nothing special. Rather boring. I'd rather use a little more effort to make something I'd enjoy more.

My family loves this dish. I've made the sauce with basil and cilantro also (depending on what's available and my mood!). Always reliable.

Tried this reciepe several years ago for a New Years Eve dinner party and it has become a standard favorite that always recieves high praise from guests.

This is a lovely dish. I would DEFINITELY not use the 1/2 cup of olive oil in the sauce however. I only used 1/4 cup and it was still a bit greasy in my opinion (salmon is a fatty fish to begin with). That aside, it is a unique and delicious way to serve salmon! I used 2/3 arugula & 1/3 basil and was pleased with the taste. Also used 2 cloves of garlic instead of the shallot. Served this to guests who all raved (& ate seconds) and my boyfriend said: "How do you come up with these amazing ideas?" Epicurious!

Easy and refreshing salmon recipe - here's tomatos for a change instead of cream sauce. Still, I wasn't fascinated with the result as other reviewers had.

This was really great and easy to prepare the sauce before comapny arrives. The only 5 min in the litchen while the fish broils. I used both basil and arugula. It was delicious.

I made this with basil and chilled it for a couple of hours before dinner. It was wonderful!

Now THIS is a keeper... I used it once with just arugula and another time with half arugula and half basil...both times it was superb. A lovely dinner party dish...presents well and no last minute thrash. All you need is a nice rice pilaf and you're set to go!

I'm constantly looking for new ways to make salmon. This is a great summer recipe. I made this with the basil instead of arugula...it was fantastic and easy! We had some leftover sauce which was excellent tossed with pasta or used for bruschetta.

A quick and easy last-minute winner. Make it now while tomatoes are at their peak. I used basil as my herb and it was very good. My husband and I were fighting over the leftovers.

Very tasty and presentable. It's easy to prepare, you can make the sauce ahead of time and the fish cooks quickly. Wonderful blend of flavors!! Will try this sauce on other fish while the tomatoes are in season!!
