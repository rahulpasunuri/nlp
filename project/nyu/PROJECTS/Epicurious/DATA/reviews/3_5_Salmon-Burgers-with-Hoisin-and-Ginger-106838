This is one of my favorite recipes and everyone I serve it to loves it as well. Use a light hand with the food processor.

Exceptional recipe. The first time I made it, I made it again the next night! Everyone I serve it to loves it - as is. No adjustments needed except maybe to skip the bun.

Wow, this is the typical Bon Appetit recipe I love! Make it the first time and it makes you look like a pro! I did not have Hosin, so I substiuted chili sauce, oyster sauce and a tablespoon sesame oil. The patties tuened out tender and moist. Rather than hamburger buns I used Ciabatta crusty Italian bread which has a a bit more presence and a stronger texture. The mayo and lettuce are a perfect compliment. Fianlly I served with a thai tamrind sauce for those who like to tart and the sweet and sour combination. That worked incredibly well! This recipe is easy, sophisticated, and suprisingly delicious!

Made this with a 2 1/2 pound salmon filet, so maybe didn't increase the ginger and hoisin enough, because those flavors didn't come through very strongly. Would make it again, but increase the flavorings. Had no trouble with it binding together- did not add egg or panko.

Great recipe. Added lemon juice and soy instead of hoisin. Then served it with a sauce of Thai sweet chili and soy mixed together. ALso, topped with avocado slices. Everyone loved it.

This was tasty enough but the patties didn't hold together at all.

These burgers are delicious! Although I did add grilled red peppers and mushrooms to the burgers. Would defenitely make again.

Good flavor and easy to make.

Try adding minced jalepeno to the mixture. Also used some mirin, 1 egg, and threw in some panko to help bind it all.

Wasn't too bad. It was my first salmon burger recipe. I thought it needed a little more spices (garlic, ginger and salt) to give it a little kick. I probably won't make this again.

A truly tasty treat. Especially wonderful with a fresh, soft, whole-wheat bun. The asian flavors take the monotony out of the grilled salmon fillet. Remarkably, although the burger mix is soft, it holds together very well in the pan and in the bun. We now buy a whole salmon fillet, about 3 pounds, make burgers and freeze them individually wrapped in parchment paper.

Ok, but needs some help. It has potential.

These are incredible. I served these with an Asian coleslaw but they would go with anything that fits with a very mild barbecue flavor. Where have I been on hoisin sauce, this stuff is amazing! These are also seriously healthful, low in fat & calories, but more than anything just yummy.

We really enjoyed this recipe. The strong asian flavor was a refreshing change from the usual salmon. I made them w/fresh salmoon and then froze the burgers, then used them later. I agree they can become dry if you overcook them. Maybe a tad more mayo would help. I don't think this recipe needs any more "zing" but a little more garlic can't hurt it either. Because they freeze well and are a quick meal are great reasons to make this again.

I have made this dish twice and loved it both times. It's excellent the next day cold as well. My two year old also ate it, though I did leave the onions and cilantro out of her portion. It has very strong Asian flavors and is a great alternative to the usual grilled salmon.

This recipe has potential. It was a little dry, but I think with a little more moisture and keeping on top of cooking time, this could be good. Two family members liked it, two didn't - a little more zing from garlic might be good too.
