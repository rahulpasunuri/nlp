This was so simple and so delicious!! I poured off about half the bacon grease because the quantity worried me, and there was plenty left to complete the recipe. SO YUMMY, and so easy. Great way to use the curly endive from my CSA!!!

Made this with half the bacon (good quality bacon), and it was delicious. Easy, hearty, healthy. Will be a staple for when a big head of curly endive appears in the CSA box.

Oh man this is good, reminds me of a pot of beans and bacon on the stove at my Momo's house in southern Mississippi! It's great as is... or if you can turn it into a pot of soup. I used dried northern beans and followed the recipe closely. Because of the dried beans, I cooked for 2 hours on low. I used curly endive and turnip greens from the winter greenhouse - what a crowd-pleaser this dished turned out to be! It's versatile, too - I thinly sliced the garlic and cooked it around the same time as the onions. Put the greens in all at once. Don't forget salt and crushed black pepper. Fresh thyme doesn't hurt either. ;-)

This was far better than I expected it to be. I didn't have endive on hand so I used red cabbage and I added garlic. The end result was strange looking and I was worried about it but when I served it to my guests they raved about it. There were no leftovers when they got done with it. The flavor of the beans with the bacon is reminiscent of a baked potato so if you can't have potatoes, make this dish!

This was delicious, but I made it with a few modifications. I used home cooked Rancho Gordo beans, and replaced the beef broth with the bean cooking liquid. Used arugula instead of endive. And I reduced the bacon to five slices, and poured off at least 2/3 of the fat before sauteeing the onion. It was an absolutely dreamy dinner with some good bread and a green salad.

Very easy and tasty. I halved the recipe and served it over whole wheat bowtie pasta for a main course for two (with leftovers). I prepared as written, except I added a bit of red pepper flakes, as suggested by other reviewers, and some halved cherry tomatoes. Flavors were very good... even my husband (who has never eaten a leafy green in his life) really liked it. Will become a staple in our house.

this is a great side dish. I used belgium endive (that's what I had at hand), and it worked fine. Next time I'll use the curly type.

Delicious - used spinach, as one poster suggested, as I didn't have endive on hand - and substituted red onions and chicken broth - again, what I had on hand. Loved it, as did the bacon-oriented boyfriend...

Wonderful recipe! Deeeeeelicious and a new weekly favorite. I will of course try to come up with something a bit more healthy, but oh so good and EASY to make.

I only used 4 slices of bacon to reduce the amount of fat. It still had a great flavor. I used endive from our CSA farm. I served it with Lundberg Farms Countrywild Rice Blend. It made a very easy, nutritious supper.

Really really fast and easy. I used swiss chard and chicken broth. I didn't rinse the beans but used a brand with little sodium. Added a pinch of red pepper flakes too.

Also very good with chick peas and some red pepper flakes. Or with spinach instead of endive.

This was easy to make and really good. Very hearty. My friends loved it. I used dried beans and simmered it for a long time for a very savory flavor.
