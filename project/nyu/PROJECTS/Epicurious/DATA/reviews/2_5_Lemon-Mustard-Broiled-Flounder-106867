Not good, Not bad. Wouldn't make again

This was very easy, but somehow we weren't too jazzed about the taste. The dijon flavor wasn't appropriate for the fish, and the choice of parsley as herbal flavor was a little wimpy. I think I'll use the concept again, but just use butter, lemon zest and a slightly bolder herb.

If I could give this recipe no forks, I would do it. Very bitter, almost inedible; the sauce basically ruins the fish.

A great quick recipe for during the week. I cut down a bit on the butter as well.

Easy to make but not much flavor. I found it bitter, quite tasteless. Maybe it was the fish?

what a great way to make flounder, i used frozen fillets (thawed), and didn't have the Clover spouts, but still delicious and super easy. Good iv you are in a hurry.

I think it was great! Dont cook the fish too long though, time it well. And dont over do it with the dry mustard. Will definatly try this with company.

Don't let the flounder brown or you will lose the fresh flavor. When the flounder was almost finished, I turned off the broiler but allowed the fish to remain in the warm oven. Very delicious.

I used fresh lemon juice in the sauce and it was strong but the flavors complimented the delicacy of flounder. It was also a very easy meal! I served it with blanched brocolli and rice -- perfecto!

This dish is simply delicious! My husband, who hates fish and won't eat anything but chicken, loved this dish! Thank god! Our marriage is saved because I think we are about to turn into chickens soon! He has tried many other fish dishes, made by his mother which I all liked, but continued to hate fish until I made this dish.

The flounder is not very good with lemon mustard. Flounder should be eaten more with a baked or broiled almondine flavor. I don't really think this is a good recipe.
