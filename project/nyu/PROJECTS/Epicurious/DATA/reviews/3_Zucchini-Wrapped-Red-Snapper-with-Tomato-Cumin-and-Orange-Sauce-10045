I thought this would be a impressive company-worthy recipe but, to me, it just seemed like rustic peasant food. It was fine, but it wasn't what I expected. I thought the zucchini would be the star of the dish but it was more like an "also- ran" or a "co-star." I used cumin seed, although ground cumin might impart more flavor. Definitely broil for the final few minutes to make the dish look more attractive.

This recipe was my favorite during my wedding diet days...and even now! The first time I made it I used tilapia vs snapper, it tasted just as delicious (it was also less fishy and cheaper). The cumin paired with the orange and cinnamon is so tasty! Slicing the zucchini is the trickiest part...a mandoline slicer would definitely be better than a veggie peeler.

Really quite good...and interesting, because this was not a standard tomato sauce. Would increase the cumin and orange flavors to add some pop - and perhaps broil the tops of the zucchini as the previous poster mentioned. But this is really a nice and different roasted fish dish.

I thought this dish was a delicious summer dinner with more complex flavors than some other summer tomato zucchini recipes. The thing for me that would make if four forks is some textural difference. I think I would like to broil instead of bake the dish nest time to try and crisp the zucchini a bit. or maybe make some fried shoestring zucchini strips for the top.

Wow! I was looking for a different recipe for red snapper, which is one of my favorite fishes. I was initially very sceptical about this one, with cinammon and zuchini -- I didn't think they were a good match for snapper -- but I followed the recipe and WOW!! Wonderful! Delicious! What a great variation from my white fish repertoire! My spouse was blown away. The only thing I did differently from the recipe was I doubled the amount of garlic and tripled the amount of orange zest. Absolutely wonderful recipe.

Very good. Added more spices - powdered cumin,more orange peel, juice and lots of salt & pepper. Looked very pretty too.

Cannot understand what the first reviewer means when she says she "substituted zucchini for snapper in the first paragraph" especially since neither the word zucchini or snapper appear in the first paragraph. None the less,this comment makes no sense at all to the preparation of the dish.

I substituted "zucchini" for "snapper" in the first paragraph and it made a huge difference.
