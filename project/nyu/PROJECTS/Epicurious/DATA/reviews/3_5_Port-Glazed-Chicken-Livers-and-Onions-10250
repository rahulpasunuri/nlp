Very good. I thought the sauce was slightly flat so I added a splash of sherry vinegar and - I think - improved the flavour. I used the hazelnuts but I think the nuts are not really necessary; it's already a very rich dish.

This was delicious, though there wasn't nearly enough port to taste it. My fault: I made it with pistachios, which I had, and they weren't strong enough to stand up to the livers. You really need the hazelnuts.

This was a very quick and tasty dinner. The trick not to overcook the chicken livers as they will become dry and tough. It's a winner!

I changed hazelnuts for sliced toasted almonds...great, next time I'll use hazelnuts.

Made this last night, and it was wonderful. It was quick, easy, and my husband actually commented on how good it was!

This is wonderful, a very inexpensive but elegant dinner. It's very rich, though--this recipe definitely yields more than two servings. I did serve this over rice, so maybe that made up the difference. I burnt the hazelnuts when I tried to toast them, so I just used "untoasted" hazelnuts, and it was still great.

wonderful flavor, nuts really enhance the flavor
