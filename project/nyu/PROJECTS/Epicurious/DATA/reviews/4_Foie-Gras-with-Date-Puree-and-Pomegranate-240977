The date purée was not that great. Granted, I did not splurge on foie gras and instead bought a more humble duck rillette pâté, but this just wasn't that tasty.

What an elegant, tasty, EASY hors d'oevres! Made these for our dinner club with a Thanksgiving theme. The date puree is a nice complement to the savory foie gras and the pomegranate seeds add texture. The challah toasts are nice as you can take a bite without the remainder breaking in your hand (like a cracker would). Definitely making this again.

These little bites were packed with flavor. Not the cheapest app to make but worth the money. The pomegranate seeds really made it a festive app to take to a party and so unexpected than the standard cheese dish/dip.

Like it but when it comes to foie gras, if you really want to taste it it's better to eat it without anything. That being said, I got lots of compliments for it. Next time I would probably use it with paté de foie instead of foie gras.

Delicious! The puree worked out perfectly. I seared the foie gras in butter (having first salt and peppered it) in a skillet on high heat for about one minute per side. Our local Whole Foods does indeed carry pomegranate molasses under the title "Pomegranate Paste". They also carry prepared pomegranate seeds.

This was a great recipe. Love the pom. molasses, and it's easy to find in Toronto - any Middle Eastern grocery has it! It's tartness with the sweet dates is just perfect. Also tried it with the topping on plain goats cheese, on rice crackers for a friend that has allergies....that's great too! A new staple, as far as I'm concerned!

I am anti foie gras because of the cruelty involved, so I used a pate instead, hoping it involved less cruelty. I also used pomegranate nectar that I reduced on the stove instead of pom. molasses. It was amazing tasting, beautiful, and simple. Trader Joe's sells pomegranate seeds in the salad section, so you don't even have to deal with the messy fruit.

This was so delicious and a beautiful presentation! My guests were so impressed. I couldn't find the pom molasses anywhere - including Whole Foods, but I found a recipe for pom molasses online (just google it).

OK Providence. I found the molasses at Central Market in Dallas. The molasses added mostly sweetness and some flavor. Bottom line; this is a great dish! Go for it pom molasses or not!

I made these canapes for Christmas and thought they were only ok. They looked pretty with the pomegranate seeds but I found the date and molasses mixture a bit strange in taste and texture. The only change I made in the recipe was using a Scottish smoked duck liver pate instead of foie gras for ethical reasons. My guests seemed to like the pate I chose but the combination wasn't memorable. I wouldn't make this again.

These were lovely and easy to assemble. Whole Foods carries pomegranate molasses.

Dear Providence R.I., Thanks for the idea for the substitution for molasses. I'll still look for the pomegranate molasses, but I'm glad to have your suggestion as an alternative. It's back on the New Year's menu! I'm giving it 4 forks based on the recipe. If my opinion differs, I'll post it.

Very tasty and pretty as the picture. I couldn't find pomegranate molasses so made my own by reducing Pom juice with some sugar until very thick. Served with a sparkling wine for an elegant start to the evening.
