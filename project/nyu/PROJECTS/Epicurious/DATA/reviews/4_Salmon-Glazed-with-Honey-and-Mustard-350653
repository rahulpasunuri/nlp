I took the advice of others and baked the salmon. I cooked the pieces at 350 for 12 min and then broiled for another 3 min. The pieces were pretty thick so they probably could have used 2 min more under the grill to brown and cook to a med. I also reduced the honey so it wasn't as sweet...taste the sauce as you go to determine the sweetness you prefer. My kids (who hate salmon) said it was really good and gobbled it up!! This was soooo easy, fast, and tasty.

I made this tonight with steelhead salmon filets (rather thin). It was excellent. I did broil it but not as long as the recipe called for. Mine did not burn rather I got a nice crisp on it. It was really tasty and beautiful! My 5 and 7 year old boys gobbled it up.

I followed the recipe to a tee and it turned out too sweet for my liking.

Excellent! We were looking for a change of pace from our usual ginger soy baste. This fit the bill. We grilled the salmon and basted it with the sauce. Very good!

I made this dish tonight and I thought it was great. I baked it at 425 as another review suggested (vs. broiling). It took about 20 minutes. I baked it in a baking pan w/ brussel sprouts (trimmed, halved, tossed w/ about 2 T of evoo, and sprinkled w/ s&p) and I thought it was a delicious, nutritious combination. I will definitely make this again soon.

There's honey it DO NOT BROIL! This could have been a great recipe but the recipe calls for broiling and I should have paid attention to others who spoke of baking instead. Of course, duh! There's honey in the glaze and of course it burned being six inches from the broiler. Will try again sometime...baking it would probably make all the difference in the world.

Added some mustard seeds to tarragon mustard as I did not have grainy Dijon mustard. Worked well. Served with grapefruit salsa, green beans and wild rice. The grapefruit salsa made the salmon sparkle. For the salsa, I used the orange salsa receipe (Chile- Glazed Salmon with Orange Salsa) elsewhere on this site and substituted grapefruit for orange in that receipe.

Really tasty. My husband liked it. Easy weeknight supper, but not spectacular or unusual. Honey mustard was the overwhelming flavor. I baked it at 375 for 10 minutes before turning on the broiler for 4 and it came out nicely not overdone, but not as rare/medium as some might lke. I think it needs the broiler to get the topping nicely bubbly. Will do it again.

This was absolutely delicious...I did not have caraway seeds but it still turned out beautifully.

Ever since trying this recipe a few months ago, it's become my favorite way of preparing salmon. I've made it using salmon fillet and salmon steaks. Both are good, but the salmon fillet wins out because it's simpler to eat and has a larger surface area to accommodate the mustard mixture.

Like others, I baked at 350 and finished off with a broil. Excellent recipe - tasted delicious! Will definitely cook again!

This is a very good recipe - not really exceptional but definitely a keeper. I thought the glaze was a bit sweet so I might back off the honey a bit and add a little more vinegar next time, but it definitely enhanced the fish, especially the caraway seeds. I used my mortar and pestle to crush the seeds - next time I'll roast/toast them first to enhance the flavor. Also next time might bake the fish first and finish it under the broiler. Cooking it under the broiler for the whole time seemed to overcook the topping. All that said - I am not a fish fan and I'm trying to eat more of it than I have been lately (used to eat it alot, but somehow lost my taste for it). Several times during the meal both my husband and I remarked on how GOOD it was - so it's a keeper!

I've made salmon many different ways, and this is a fantastic recipe. My dinner guests said that it was the best salmon they've ever tasted. I used a 1-1/2 pound flat piece and the amount of glaze was perfect. I suppose there could be too much sauce on a thicker piece with less surface area. Try to buy a piece of even thickness - it will be easier to broil. I used Maille Old Style whole grain Dijon mustard and it was the key ingredient - it really cut the sweetness of the honey. I set my broiler temp to 425 - and it was done in exactly 15 minutes - the top was bubbly, with little brown spots. I put the caraway seeds in a small zipper bag and then ran a rolling pin over it a few times to crush them.

OH MY WORD!!!! This is the best salmon I've ever tasted. Now remember, I was pretty scared of salmon prior to this recipe. I just didn't think I could do salmon justice. But this was easy and tasty. I would definitely make this again. DEFINITELY!!!!!

This was good although I used less of the sauce over the salmon as I thought it was going to cover the salmon flavor. I would use 3/4 of the sauce and its perfect.

This recipe is incredible. The glaze is very flavorful and will surprise you. I had a hard time crushing the caraway seeds (amateur ignorance?) so I just included them whole, but it was fine. I also had to cook the salmon a little longer than it recommended. I had a tail end of the salmon, so the middle part was a little bigger than 1.5". How I remedied this was after 14 mins of cooking, I cut the thinner portion and returned the larger part to the oven at 350 degrees (so that the glaze wouldn't burn from the broiler). I cooked for a few more minutes and it turned out fine. I highly recommend trying this recipe as is.

Sweet, gooey and disappointing. I grilled rather than broiled, so perhaps that made the difference.

I followed the recipe and it was great. Quite bold but still compliments the salmon. Use the seed it makes it "more" than a honey mustard sauce and takes the fish to a whole ...notha...level!

This recipe was so easy and turned out great! I substituted celery seed for caraway seeds since I'm not a fan of the latter, and it was still great. Will definitely make this again.

Oh. My. God. This was wonderful. The glaze carmelized beautifully on the salmon. The flavors mixed perfectly. I don't think you need to change a thing (except to make more for the seconds! I made the full pound and a half for three people and there were no leftovers! It goes really well with the nutty brown rice, also. My husband said this was the best salmon he's ever had.

Very tasty as-is. I over did it on the sauce, which kind of drowned out the salmon, but if you can strike the perfect balance this dish could be fantastic. Quick, easy, & healthy. Hard to beat!

Substituted 1/4 tsp of ground cumin for the caraway and regular Dijon rather than grainy, worked out excellently. Definitely will make again!

Extremely easy to make, quick preparation, and the result is simply mouth-watering. The salmon gets a wonderful crusty look from the sugary-honey cooking in the oven. Adds a nice crispyness to the entree. Everyone wanted seconds!

I generally don't like glazes or sauces on my salmon, but this was good. The caraway gives it a little extra something that makes it much better than typical honey mustard glazes. My wife absolutely loved it. Very easy to make, and though I usually like to tailor recipes to my own liking I think I'll keep making this exactly as it's written. I had never broiled salmon before (I usually grill it), but it proved to be a great way to cook the fish. The 1 lb filet we had came out perfectly cooked after about 12 minutes.

MAKING THE RECIPE EXACTLY AS WRITTEN GETS RAVES.

I was disappointed in the results. I used the "bake" method instead of broiling to avoid the risk of burning the glaze. Just didn't feel that the glaze enhanced the wild caught salmon we used. It was better as a leftover in a salad with a honey dressing.

I ate it. My 7 year old daughter said it tasted "weird". I knew she was talking about the caraway. For those with a penchant for unusual flavor combos- hope you enjoy this one more than I.

I made this recipe pretty much exactly as written. (I usually don't make variations until the second pass) It turned out extremely well, The salmon was moist and very flavorful. I really don't have any changes to suggest: I like it as is.

This was quite good. I used copper river wild salmon, and it did not overpower the true flavor of the fish. I thought it kept it moist, but wasnt heavy as other toppings for salmon that I have used did. Easy to prepare, fast, and I'll make it again.

Tasty and simple. Better than many other mustard based glazes which can overwhelm fish. Instead of broiling it, however, I roasted the salmon filet in a 450 degree oven for 10 minutes and then applied glaze and put it back in for another 5-6 minutes. That way the honey doesn't have a chance to burn. The brown rice accompaniment works perfectly.
