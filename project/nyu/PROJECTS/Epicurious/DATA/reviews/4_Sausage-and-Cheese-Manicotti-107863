OMG...so good...so easy...I used some Sicilian sausage nested of sweet Italian ...I like it zippy...we will be making this again!

super easy and a crowd-pleaser. make sure to boil down the tomato sauce and season generously with salt AND sugar, otherwise it's a bit sour. of course as with most italian dishes - quality products are essential.

Very nice + mild flavors. Premium ingredients of course, make a better dish. My 3 teens were fond of it. I thought it was easy to make + pretty fast. Maybe an hour total, but I cooked the sausage w/o casing and with the onions. Took some other short cuts with the sauce, and used whole milk mozzarella instead of provolone since that's what I had on hand.

I made this per the instructions and doubled the sauce. In my opinion it is just okay. Not very flavorful, rather bland. It took some effort to make this and I had higher hopes.

I never would have thought this provolone would have made a cheese-lover out of my daughter. http://homesandbabies.blogspot.com/2011/01/sausage-stuffed-manicotti.html

This is a wonderful and savory Manicotti. The sausage and provolone are great little touches that make it stand out.

Exceptionally delicious. We used local cheeses and sausage from our farmer's market and I substituted Muir Glen Fire-Roasted crushed tomatoes for the canned plum tomatoes--no need for a food mill, just dump them right in the pan.

Really great...I always get rave reviews from everyone (including the picky eaters) on this!

After reading the reviews of this I was excited. It ended up being way too much work for how it turns out. We followed the receipe but it was disappointing. We served it for a dinner party and received very few raves. While it was somewhat tasty, it was definitely not worth all of the work and I won't be making it again.

I have mixed reviews on this recipe. I made it per the ingredients but doubled the sauce. I couldn't bring myself to dice the sausage and add it to the filling so I crumbled it and added some of the cooked sausage to the filling and the rest was in the sauce. That worked fine. I should have followed one suggestion - half hot/half mild sausage. That would have made a big improvement. I filled 11 manicotti and could probably have stretched it to 12 which is what the recipe calls for. All in all it was good but I have had better manicotti. I like the versions with homemade crepes. I served this with a caesar salad and garlic toast for a nice Italian dinner.

Made it for guests - we all loved it! I doubled the sauce and used dried oregano instead of basil. I just tossed the canned whole peeled tomatoes w/basil in a blender instead of using a mill. Must use good ricotta, provolone and sausage. I also didn't leave sausage in the sauce the whole time, just till cooked thru, so I could take them out & let them cool, chop and whip up the filling and stuff, before the sauce was done. I will make this again very soon!

I've been making Italian food all of my life and eating it too and this is one of the tastiest and most accessible recipes for manicotti. I made it even easier by using chopped tomatoes rigt out of the can...the sauce was not smooth but still yummy. I also used half spicy sausage..and doubled the sausage and sauce. Definitely use the crshed red pepper...the bite of heat makes this dish special.

made this over the weekend, took the reviewers advise and used jumbo shells and doubled the sauce, awesome! the provolone that melts inside the shells is heaven, once you get going the stuffing goes pretty quick, made enough for some freezer meals

This was a lot of fun to make! I made this as one of a number of venison dishes for a venison party I had in downtown Chicago. I removed the venison sausage casings and stuffed the manicotti very carefully with the venison. It turned out excellent. For those sceptical venison first timers I find that this dish and another dish called Sausage and Tomato Quiche went over very well with venison substituted for sausage. Give it a try. Especially you Minnesota traditionalists!

This was a great do ahead recipe. We had friends over and they were definitely impressed. I followed the previous reviewers suggestions of doubling the sauce and only cooking the manicotti for five minutes. It was perfect!

Really tasty. I substitute small curd cottage cheese for ricotta.

Save yourself some time and use the Barilla no boil lasagna noodles to make this dish. Boil enough water to immerse the noodles, soaking them for about 5 minutes. Drain, pat dry and then spread the cheese mixture on bottom 3/4 of each sheet. Roll up the short side and viola! Magic manicotti.

Although time consuming, wonderful dish. I used ground italian spicy sausage with crushed garlic, sauteed minced mushrooms and fresh parsley in the ricotta mix. Also, I pureed the sauce with extra crushed pepper, garlic, and fennel seeds.

Excellent dish! While it was time consuming, it was very simple to prepare with fabulous results! I followed the advice of the other reviewers and doubled the sauce, doubled the sausage ( used a 2 to 1 ratio of sweet mild to spicy sausages), and used a disposable pastry bag to fill the manicotti. I also agree that using the best cheese and sausage makes a difference. Delicious!

Great recipe that can be changed up to suite mosts tastes. The one thing people should note is not to cook the pasta til its al dente. It will be easier to fill while still firm and will continue cooking in the oven. Also for my taste I used sharp provolone and a mix of the hot and sweet Italian sausage. For the sauce I use a can of crushed tomatoes with basil to save time.

One of my favorite recipes of all time.

This is a great recipe. I get requests for it all the time. I use jumbo shells because they are easier to fill. I also use good store bought sauce in a pinch. Also, good leftover if you are lucky enough to have any.

Stole all the best ideas from the other reviewers and it was a hit: doubled the sauce, mashed the tomatoes with a fork (no food mill), used a mix of hot and mild good fresh italian sausage, used high quality provolone (I used mild but next time might use sharp to jazz up even more), high quality fresh parmesan, and used the gallon baggie to squeeze in the cheese mixture into the manicotti (easy peesy!). My dinner party guests absolutely loved it.

I changed this slightly in that I was in a hurry and had no provolone, so used a sharp cheddar. It was delicious. Will definitely make this again.

I followed other reviewer suggestions and used crushed tomatoes and jumbo pasta shells, without any adverse effects. I thought this was tasty, but I would double the sauce portion of the recipe. After the tomatoe mixture simmers for over an hour, reducing to just two cups of sauce, it didn't seem like enough sauce to adequately cover the pasta.

Made this recipe with homemade fresh pasta rolled around the filling. Didn't put the tomato sauce through a food mill. Also used one hot sausage with three sweet. Made the cheese filling with organic ricotta, imported aged provalone, and Parmesano Reggiano. It was worth it. Delicious and relatively easy to prepare.

Rating: 4
This is one of our favorites - we've made it several times. We didn't mess with the food mill, just mashed it up after cooking directly in the pot. The key is to use the very best cheese you can find, and we found hot italian sausages add a tremendous amount of flavor. We also have found the manicotti too difficult to stuff, so we substituted jumbo shells instead and saved 15 minutes without sacrificing flavor.

this really is a 3.5. My 15 yr. old daughter made this for us it was very good and we just used regular ricotta and provolone and parmesan I'm going to have to try this with the quality ingredients and see if it can be better than what we had tonight. The sauce is excellent, need to double it.

This dish is easy to prepare (used 28 oz can crushed tomatos with basil and no food mill) and absolutely delish! Not only did my guests request 2nds, they actually fought over who would take home the leftovers! I made the sauce and filling in the morning, so everything was clean when my guests arrived. I cooked the pasta 5 minutes only and we all filled the tubes together. It was fun! They don't split if you don't cook them too much. After that was done, it was jus 30 minutes to dinner with a salad, bread and olive oil for dipping. Great party fare!

I made this recipe and the sauce was a huge hit and the filling was amazing. I didn't make the crepes because I didn't have time, but it was still fantastic, next time I'll try the crepes, but I can't imagine this dish being much better.

Great dish. We like a lot of sauce so we doubled this part of the recipe. We did not use a food mill we pureed the tomatoes in a food processor. We also did not remove the seeds. Next time we are going to try it with hot itialian sausage.

I make this dish once or twice a month...it's la bomba!!! If the recipe was more complicated to make, I would've awarded it 4 forks, but the degree of difficulty was just not there. Anyway, simply put-- delicious and very easy to make.

Have yet to make it; just a note to the cook from Temecula - Williams-Sonoma carries San Marzanos in their stores. You might check the next time you are near one.

Rating: 4
This dish was soooo good! The way the recipe is written makes the prep a bit time consuming. Instead of going through all the trouble of running the plum tomatoes through a mill then reducing I substituted a 28 oz. can of good quality crushed tomatoes instead. If I could get some good San Marzanos here instead of the mass-imported ones they sell here than I would actually follow the steps from the recipe... because then it would be worth it. The key to making this dish great is of course using the best cheese and sausage you can find.

About halfway through preparation, I found myself saying, "I should have just made lasagana; it's easier." But when you take the first bite, you'll realize the labor was well worth it. Even though I also used good-quality canned crushed tomatoes with basil, I still found myself in the kitchen longer than I wanted to be. I might buy cubed prosciutto next time... I found some small manicotti shells and cooked them for four minutes only. In total, I stuffed 20 shells which was actually easier than chopping the darn sausage! I am so happy I have leftovers tonight, and that feeling doesn't come about very often.

This was a very flavorful recipe and worth the moderate amount of work to stuff the pasta. Like other reviewers I used crushed tomatoes with no ill effects. I also used chicken sausage as my husband doesn't eat red meat or pork and it was still great!!

Good recipe, though some of the instructions seem superfluous; the dish can be prepared faster and more simply, with no loss of deliciousness. First, we didn't bother with a food mill, and instead used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes (recommend San Marzano). Secondly, reducing the sauce takes about 20 minutes, not 75. To our taste, the more sauce the better; a little red wine added never hurts, either. We also stuffed the mixture into large shells (12 oz box), cooked then rinsed in cold water to head off worries about pastry bags or breaking the manicotti tubes, etc.

Good Manicotti recipe! My tip for stuffing manicotti shells is to load your filling into a gallon-size ziploc bag, and then just snip a corner off the bag (to create a hole exactly the diameter of the manicotti shells). This works GREAT, and no clean up of a pastry bag! Just throw it away!

I didn't make this recipe but I'm sure it's good....but wanted to add my trick for stuffing manicotti....I use a Pampered Chef pastrey do dad and it works wonderfully....eliminates all the mess and takes less than 5 minutes to stuff.

Rating: 4
Just fantastic and easier to make than I thought. I was worried that stuffing the tubes was going to be difficult, and found it to be no problem. I ended up using bulk sausage (half hot, half sweet) as that all I could find at the store. Gives a nice hint of spiciness to the dish. I removed about three-fourths of the sausage with a slotted spoon before adding the tomatoes to the pan and this worked out just fine. Another keeper, my six year old loved it.

Rating: 3
I made this dish tonight exactly as written with sharp domestic provolone and the whole family loved it. Makes only 12(8 oz box of pasta) and hearty eaters will eat 3, lighter eaters 2. I found that as long as I used a pan that just fit the manicotti the amount of sauce was just right. This is a winter favorite for my family.

I doubled the recipe since we had a group of 10, and we wanted to have some as leftovers. I used 3 links Ital sausage and 1 lb. ground beef. I took the casings off the sausage before cooking so it all ended up crumbling apart while cooking and therefore it was a tad difficult to remove the meat and sausage separately from the sauce. But having some pieces of meat left in the sauce worked out just fine. I've made this before and both times I wish I had more sauce to cover the manicotti. Like other reviewers, I just used canned diced tomatoes for ease which were fine. All in all, a nice alternative to lasagne when you're looking for something different and a do-ahead dish. Now a staple! Served with caesar salad with herbed croutons from this site, which was a hit as well.

Rating: 3
It was good and improved with age (the third day was the best) and the provolone was a nice touch, HOWEVER, 12 manicotti was the max we could get and there is a lasagna recipe (Sausage, Cheese and Basil Lasagna) that tastes just as good and is much less work and expense.

Rating: 4
Yummy! Key is the provolone cheese. Also I was only able to stuff about a dozen manicotti with this recipe (though one 1b. equals 24 manicotti--they must use smaller ones). You don't need to use whole milk ricotta, part skim is fine. And I used jarred sauce (Classico Marinara) saves a step with making the sauce.

Wonderful! The cheeses blend well. I used fresh cheeses. Pre cut tomatoes are a good help. By the way these froze well to be used later.

Delicious and surprisingly easy to make! My only change was using a 28-oz. can of crushed tomatoes instead of whole canned tomatoes to avoid the food mill step. It worked out just fine. I will definitely make this again.

Followed the recipe to a "t". Made the tomato sauce a day ahead- didn't add the basil till just before assembly and baking. The first provolone I bought was far too strong in flavor. Found a milder provolone and used a 4/1 ration of mild to strong. Another winner from Bon Appetit!!

This was my first attempt to make manicotti, and I was a little disappointed with this dish. First of all, I found the tomato sauce to be too rich for my taste after simmering with the sausage for an hour. Next time, I will eliminate this process or the sausage all together. Secondly, I mis-read the ingredients and purchased fresh mozarella instead of fresh provolone. I went ahead and used it which made it gooey, which isn't bad, but probably contributed to the richness of the dish. Finally, the 3/4 cup of freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, which I absolutely love, just made it over-the-top rich. Perhaps a little less cheese would be better. I will attempt manicotti again, but not necessarily this recipe. It was just too rich for me. Good luck with your attempts!

Delicious! I made this for a dinner party, and the guests made me promise to give them the recipe. I used mild bulk sausage (not in the casings), otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I plan on making it again!
