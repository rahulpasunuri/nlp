Sorry, slechleiter, but Riz à la Valencienne means Valencia-style rice, and that's pretty much the same as saying paella. Saffron is what is used in Spain to make the rice yellow, as well as flavouring it. Unless the rice is supposed to be white or black (in which case squid ink would be used), this is the way they make rice in Spain. (And by the way, Valencian rice does not have shrimp or any other seafood in it-it does however have rabbit, white beans, and green beans)

Where's the saffron? Where'sthe Shrimp? It ain't Paella without at least the former.

I am sorry, but the lack of saffron comment was ignorant. WHERE OR WHERE does it say Paella, or right, it doesn't. This isn't paella, the Spanish have more than one way to cook rice.

Sorry, this recipe lacks many ingredients and way of preparing it! Saffron for instance, which is one of its main ingredients. The juices of all the meats left on the pan are also a must.

FYI - Trader Joe's sells bags of frozen artichokes in the frozen food isle. I always find great deals there for other recipes, as well.

I used frozen artichokes, all mussels and added a few shrimp. This dish makes a pretty presentation and tastes very good.

What I like about this recipe is that it contains very little fat, especially if one takes care not to use fatty chicken. It was also easy to follow - step by step. The preparation took time, but the actual cooking was fun.

We have tried 2 or 3 paella recipes and this is our favorite. I am not sure the fresh artichokes are necessary. Next time we are using canned or skipping as I too have no idea where to buy frozen (there are several gourmet food stores in my area). Added 1 1/2 pounds medium shrimp and next time I think we will add 2. Increased the garlic to 5 cloves. Used extra wine for the liquid when it calls for water. Next time will icrease clams to 2 dozen. We served 11 with enough leftovers that we could have served 15.

This is a huge recipe. I think it would easily serve ten. My family liked it with the following variations. I used bottled clam broth instead of the clam and mussel liquid and substituted 1 lb. of shrimps for the clams and mussels. Also added 1/2 lb. of smoked sausage.

I made this recipe last night (doubled it) for a first dish at a summer barbeque and it served easily about 25. It was the best thing I made. I did mildly modify the recipe: I cut the canned tomatoes in half; I used paprika and saffron; I used canned artichoke hearts (fresh or frozen would have been better), and I added to chorizo sausages and 1/2 pound of shelled shrimp. I also cooked the shrimp with the green beans and red peppers in a little butter and water instead of first steaming and then sauteing them to save a little work and time. I used Jasmine rice which worked very well. One of the best things I've eveer cooked.

This was fabulous! I couldn't find frozen artichoke hearts so I used canned (wish I used fresh) but other than that, the only change I made was to use all clams. I also used Arborio rice and twice as much wine/chicken broth for liquid. Can't wait to make this again. The husband LOVED it!

I took several big shortcuts, bottled artichoke hearts, frozen mussel meat instead of the clams and mussels, and pre-cooked chicken, as well as microwaved the greenbeans instead of boiling them and it was still delicious and impressive. I added 1/4 c. wine vinegar and extra chicken broth to make up for the lack of shellfish cooking water. I also added some lemon juice to the vege's to make up for the lack there. Now I imagine if I had made it according to recipe it would have been four forks. The plus side to the shortcuts is it took 45 minutes from deciding to make it to having it on the table.

This recipe is excellent and addictive. I especially enjoyed the paparika in lieu of the usual saffron. My only difficulty was finding medium grain rice. I ended up using risotto and doubling the amount of chicken broth. I think you could also use short or long grain rice successfully.
