I have made this for three years now with cookies for xmas. I sprinkle crushed candy cane on top to make it a bit more festive. It's easy and yummy:)

Everyone I've served this to has just raved about the recipe. I actually printed it out for two of my colleagues at work. I didn't quite follow the recipe as written but it was still to die for! I'm sure this won't be the only batch I make during the holidays.

This was so yummy, but I did have a problem with the carmel never setting and so much of it oozed out over the course of several days. Since my husband was responsible for the carmel part, I don't know what went wrong, but would definitely make again.

Love this bark. I made for Christmas gifts last year and got requests for it this year.

This is my second time making this in three days. It turned out incredible. I sprinkled the top with fleur de sel after letting the chocolate set for about twentyl minutes, otherwise the salt would disappear into the chocolate. I also used the microwave for both the chocolate and caramel. This will be making an annual appearance for sure!

The first time I made this recipe I followed the instructions, I did omit the rum and added more heavy cream as recommended it you are not adding rum. They were very good, but I had trouble getting the layers to stay together when I chopped it and the caramel got pretty hard. The problem was probably that I did keep it in the refrigerator. This time when I made it, I kept the rum, and adjusted the heavy cream to 2 teaspoons. The caramel was gooey and awesome! I also roughly chopped the pecans and added all of them to the bottom chocolate layer, followed by the caramel and then more chocolate. I then sprinkled a little bit of course sea salt on top of it. Oh my goodness, it turned out so well this time! All I can say is yum! Also, I do keep it in the refrigerator and the caramel still stays gooey the way I made it this time.

Excellent. I brought these to work and they were a hit. I used Johnnie Walker blue label whiskey but you can barely taste it. I doubled the recipe and used a whole bag of Nestle tollhouse 2lb, 4oz chocolate chips and it wasn't too much chocolate. Love these!

update to my review- it never hardened up over night, so i covered it and put it in the fridge, it hardened up and worked out just fine. easy to cut it in smaller squares too.

1st batch- used semisweet choc... roasted pecans 10 mins in oven.(no more than that for sure, 8 mins would probably be perfect) I used 9x13 pan. that was too big, will use 9x9 next time for sure. put rum in the carmel... 2/3 of choc for base and 1/3 for drizzle. it has set for 4 hours and has not really hardened up. I did cut it and will see if it does set up better later. i also drizzled a little white choc over the top. Taste is good, just expected it to harden up better and quicker. will try with milk choc for base and use different types of nuts on next try.

Even though I read every single review I encountered some different issues. One review did warn about overflow of caramel in microwave. I can attest it does that! Cooking time on caramel was much too long for my microwave. The two minutes would do it fine. I also found that caramel hardened very quickly so I had to re-microwave to soften it again. Fortunately I made it after the chocolate. Can't imagine doing it first. I felt there was not enough caramel relative to chocolate so I made 1/2 recipe more. I mixed the pecans into the chocolate reserving just a little to drizzle on the top. Using a cookie sheet to spread this out was important. You could make it much thinner this way. Now that I have some experience, it's easy and I will make it often. Thank heavens for husbands who will sit and open those d--- caramel wrappers!

Really good and really easy. I agree with others about there being too much chocolate. I ended up melting some more caramels and drizzling the liquid on top. I used a mixture of almonds and pecans because I didn't have enough pecans on hand. Yummy - I made 'em for a barbecue and they were snatched up -- with lots of oohs and aahs and me giggling because I knew how easy they were to make.

This was the crowds favorite! SO easy. It is not nearly enough to fill the whole size of the pan but makes plenty!

AWESOME. I accidentally used almonds and it turned out soooo good. Will try pecans in next batch. Maybe that vanilla too!

added a little vanilla to the caramel as well. REally really good recipe!

This is sooo excellent! I took the advice about melting the caramel and chocolate at the same time, but following the recipe's instruction for melting the chocolate correctly so it sets better. The size of the baking sheet is irrelevant since the chocolate is not runny so I just spread it out on parchment on the baking sheet I had used for toasting the pecans .. no problem, doesn't come close to the edges -- and you don't need it to be up against any edges .. Also, it definitely takes longer than 2 hours to set. I made this the day before and the chocolate was firmer and able to chop into pieces. Rave reviews!

After reading all of the helpful reviews, I made several modifications to the original receipe: 1. Split chocolate into two batches, 2/3 of chocolate for bottom and 1/3 for top. This was STILL too much for the drizzle, and would perhaps use 3/4 for the bottom and 1/4 for the top next time. 2. Used milk chocolate for the bottom and semi-sweet for the drizzle; this worked nicely. 3. As others suggested, melted the chocolate at the same time as the caramel mixture. 4. I have no idea how anyone is getting this to fit a 9 x 13 pan. Although I had increased the chocolate for the bottom, the only way you could possibly spread this to fit such a pan is if you're using pecan pieces instead of halves. I started out with a 9 x 13 and had to downsize to a 9 x 9. 5. As this was being made for children, used rum extract instead, and additional cream, in place of alcohol. It does look a bit of a messed, but tasted divine.

You can't go wrong with this recipe! I used spiced rum and dark chocolate chips and made it for a Christmas party. People were going crazy over it. I'm not even a candy person but I know I can't have this stuff in the house - it's addicting!

I've only ever had individual turtles, but this bark is out of this world! I don't have a microwave so had to improvise with a double boiler for the caramels, but this was gone before the plate hit the table! Delicious!

Rating: 4
I made numerous batches of this for the holidays - a few 'additions' made it even better: a little thicker chocolate topping kept the caramel neatly enclosed, lightly salted the bark with a flake salt (similar to a fleur de sel caramel) then drizzled white chocolate all over the top layer of chocolate to decorate.

Excellent, very easy and very yummy chocolate candy. Great for holiday gifts or hostess gifts throughout the year. Will try next year with milk chocolate as well.

This was really good, the only problem I had was the caramel was hard, almost like a toffee, I will try this again, but it was still really good, and I will keep it in the Christmas Rotation.

My first Epi-dud! I guess after so many years using this site and only finding one poor recipe it's not that bad. Oh well. It would have been nice for this recipe to include the size of baking pan needed as it makes a huge difference and the ingredients are *not* easily transfered into another baking if you happen to pick the wrong size intially (TIP: use a 9x9 ~ Anything larger and the mixture spreads way too thin) Also, it would have been much easier, as the below reviewer commented, to melt the chocolate badges in separate containers. Also, using half the chocolate to drizzle is way too much. The caramels and the chocolate really need to melt simultaneously as the caramel mix sets very, very quickly upon reaching the melting point. It does taste good, although not superb. So, in my opinion, it's not worth the effort, the trial and error, the amount of dirty bowls or the expense of ingredients.

Rating: 4
this was super simple and well worth any effort. However, the directions regarding melting half the chocolate, adding the rest and then splitting it again is ridiculous. Just melt the two batches of chocolate seperately. I could barely taste the bourbon I used so I will experiment with using more or better quality. also, I use very good quality caramel from King Arthur Flour company in a large block instead of the wrapped kind. well worth the expense and easier to deal with

Followed the advice of a previous reviewer- used a 9x13 inch pan lined with Pam coated foil, otherwise followed the directions of the recipe, and it turned out wonderfully! Super easy, super good!

Rating: 4
This is a real no-brainer. The most difficult part of this recipe is unwrapping the caramels. Of course the better your ingredients the better the outcome. Tempered the chocolate in a pyrex bowl over a saucepan, toasted the pecans in a 14 inch skillet on top of the stove as it's hot here. (Florida) Sent in Holiday packages, that is the ones that did not go down my throat.....

This was an easy and tasty recipe; however ratios need to be tweaked a bit. I had so much chocolate that I added at least another cup of nuts to the mixture before spreading on the pan. Also the chocolate reserved to top the bark was really too much. 1/2 of that amount is more than adequate. The second time I made this I followed the above mentioned tweaks (and used milk chocolate instead of semi sweet). I was able to yield a larger batch the 2nd time. It was also a much tastier and more substantial candy with the extra nuts. The milk chocolate version was fabulous!

Rating: 4
Awesome! I did simplify the process a bit. After doing the carmel in the microwave, I dumped all 1 pound of the chocolate (I used chips) in a medium glass bowl and microwaved on High and stirred in intervals until melted, then reserved some for the top in another small bowl. I believe by doing it this way, I didn't run into the problems of cooling/setting up that other reviewers did. The vagueness in this recipe regarding pan size was annoying. I put this on a cookie sheet, which was probably overkill. A 13x9 is plenty big. It doesn't make that much and you could probably fit a triple batch on a cookie sheet if you are making this to give away for the holidays.

These are soooo incredibly good - I make them every year for Christmas and I have to keep a wooden spoon handy so I can beat my family away when they try to steal it. So - if you are making some to give away I suggest doubling it to make up for the losses you will undoubtedly sustain (both from family and yourself)

Love these! Just remember to really follow the directions when it comes to microwaving the caramels -- if you heat it on high, the caramel bubbles over and gets all over your microwave :(

I have made this many times now since it is so easy with such good results. The only thing I've changed is that I just layer everything, layer of chocolate, layer of pecans, layer of caramel, layer of chocolate. It seems to all come out the same and I can knock out a double batch in the blink of an eye. The only problem with the recipe is that once it's made you can't quit eating them! This is one of those recipes that makes people think your a fabulous cook!

This is just yummy. I used this season's pecans direct for the tree and very good chocolate. It worked just as the recipe stated. It is a new addition to my Christmas treats for others with, of course, some saved for us.

Easy delicious addition to a holiday cookie tray. High quality chocolate is important. To make it even faster I mixed all the pecans with all the melted chocolate and drizzled the melted carmel over the chocolate pecan mixture.

I don't have a microwave either, but just melted the caramel on its own in a heavy sauce pan, then added the cream and rum and stirred until smooth - it worked just fine! I will definitely be adding this to my list of annual holiday treats...

I'm not a candymaker. If I don't have a microwave, how should I heat the caramel mixture? Would a double boiler work okay? I'm going to give it 4 stars because I don't know how this combo could be bad. (Potential user errors aside)

If you like the ingredients, you will LOVE this. I have made it as written and also with different types of chocolate depending on who would be eating it. All varieties worked well. I would recommend leaving the cutting until the last minute as my caramel tended to ooze. Still tastes great, just messier.

This looks and tastes great! The pecans toasted at 350 for 10 min just fine. I melted the choc chips as directed, added half the pecans to about 3/4 of the chocolate, and spread that onto parchment paper. Following advice from a previous review, I made sure the caramel and chocolate were warm at the same time, and I poured the WARM caramel onto the WARM chocolate I had just spread out, then pressed in the rest of the pecans. The only problem I had was that by the time I has pressed in the rest of the pecans, the leftover chocolate started to cool and was not easy to drizzle. This does not make a large amount of candy, I filled two decent sized containers with it.

4 Forks for easiness and can't-stop-eating-them-allness! Ten minutes was perfect for the pecans. I didn't use the alcohol, but I think I like it a little more chewy and will add more carmel next time. Next year this will be my Christmas treat to bring to the neighbors.

I made this recipe for the first time for an annual holiday dessert bake-off and I won!!! It was very easy to make,the only problem I had was figuring out what size pan to use. I ended up using a 9x9 baking pan.

We had a big bash on Christmas Eve. We literally served soup to nuts. Even though we were all so completely stuffed by the time we got to dessert, no one could resist these. I followed the recipe exactly, and they were easy and fun to make (and I am more of a cook than a dessert maker). Put these on a pretty plate, and all will be thrilled.

Easy to make but I would recommend melting the caramel while melting the chocolate as it hardened before the chocolate was melted. Also make sure to really push the second round of nuts into the caramel coat (I didn't do this and the whole top of the bark fell off).

I absolutely LOVED this candy, and so did everyone else that received it as a gift from me. I thought it was super easy to make, totally indulgent, and delicious. I used a knife to cut it into triangles, so maybe that works better than breaking it. Also, I didn't try to spread it out too much, so the bark was pretty thick. I'll be making this every Christmas.

This candy is really tasty. I used a very dark chocolate to offset the sweet butter rum caramel. I had no problem toasting the nuts for 10 mins (in the center of the oven). The layering directions were pretty vague, so I lined a 13x9 inch pan with heavy duty foil, gave it a quick zap of cooking spray and then made the layers as described. When it was cool, I could easily lift the candy, peel off the foil and chop it into small squares (I made 60).

I have no idea how this recipe can have bad reviews! Both my parents do not like chocolate but absolutely raved about this. I made it for my boss but luckily only half the batch fit in the tin I gave her! All left overs were inhaled! If you're problem is that it's not pretty, get over it! Bought bark isn't pretty, and this tastes much better than anything bought in a store! Make it now!

I will not be making this again. First, you don't need to reserve half of your chocolate for drizzle on the top. That is way too much. I would use more to form the bottom and would still have plenty for drizzling. Secondly, when I tried to break it apart after 4 hours of cooling it fell apart. The chocolate layer and caramel layer didn't stick together. I followed the recipe verbatim, so I don't know what happened. It was a waste of a pound of expensive chocolate.

Rating: 0
I'm puzzled by the review from guinnessgirl.......how can a pound of chocolate, 2 cups of pecans and a cup of caramel only be enough for 4 people? I'd like to try this, but wonder about what really happened (did it not spread thin enough, etc?)

Rating: 1
I tried this recipe as I was looking for something that was easy and that would ship well for the holidays. The measurements were completely off- This made barely enough for 4 people. Ten minutes is way too long to toast the nuts- I would do 6 or 7 tops. Because the nuts were toasted to long, it ruined the entire thing. Would not waste my time making again.
