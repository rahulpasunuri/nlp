Surprisingly delicious soup considering how simple it is. I just made the soup. Tastes very potato-y. I immediately refridgerated and ate the next day - helped bring out the garlic. Nice! There is no salt in the recipe which has to be added at the end - I added about 3 tsp. Make a lot of soup.

I only made the soup but that was delicious. I am now requested to make it often.

A lot of work for very average results. The Soupe was somewhat bland and the Salad, while creative, was not a hit.
