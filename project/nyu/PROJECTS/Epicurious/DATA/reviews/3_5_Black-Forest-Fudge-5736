As a follow up to my earlier review, I made this fudge again, and have one word of warning: DO NOT freeze it. I had a little left over that I wasn't giving away for presents, so I put it in the freezer to keep it for later. Just unthawed it after about 3 weeks in the freezer and the flavor was totally gone.

i don't see when you add the marshmallow creme. i am guessing it is in the bowl with the chocolate chips but it's not mentioned anywhere. anyone know the answer to this ? thanks much.

This was great -- really easy to make and delicious, and I don't really even like fudge that much! I chopped the chocolate in my food processor, so that cut out the only part of the prep that takes any time. I made it in a 9x9 pan, and I think next time I will press the chocolate chips into the top of the candy a little bit before I chill it, as some of them came off when I cut it later. Also, for me it didn't take anywhere near the 17 minutes the recipe mentions to hit 230 on the candy thermometer--more like 5 minutes. Also, I made this on a snowy day, and the humidity didn't seem to cause any problems.

This was a fun recipe to make and my family LOVED it! I let the sugar mixture cook a bit longer as I didn't use a candy thermometer and it set really well.

I loved this and so did my co-workers. I took the other reviewer's advise and watched the temperature closely. I also used a 9x9 pan instead of the loaf pan. It sat out all day for everyone to munch on at work and remained perfect. Next time, I may try melting the chocolate chips and piping stripes on the top though.

This continues to be an often requested favorite. Note: make sure the exact temperature of 230 is reached or it will not set up properly, it seems like it takes forever to go the last few degrees. And use a 9X9 pan.

Over the past four years this recipe has become the traditional "teacher thank you gift." We have had fun making mocha fudge, hot pepper fudge, ginger fudge, orange fudge, and of course black forest. It is a great starting point for experimentation. Never has a batch failed to set or to win praise. The candy thermometer is essential.

The flavor was super chocolate, which was great. I also had trouble with the fudge setting up. It was really gooey even a few days later. So, instead of cutting it into squares, I rolled it into balls and in cocoa powder like truffles. Next time, I would make this in a square 9x9, instead of the loaf pan.

We loved the flavor of this fudge, very chocolaty with great cherry flavor and texture. However, it didn't set up as firmly as I would have liked. Since I am new to candy-making, I am not sure how to fix this. Overall, everyone really liked it and didn't seem to care that it was a little gooey.

This is sooooooo good! I agree that it was a little thick, but otherwise it was fine. It set up quickly and peeled off the foil just fine. I made a double recipe in a 9x9 pan, and I think it would be thick enough in a 9x12 or 9x13. I'm making it for Christmas gifts this year. Try substituting half of the water with cherry brandy. Really tasty. Made in a 9x13 pan the next time and it came out perfectly.

To the cook in Sydney: You can buy "Fluff" at Coles, next to the Vegemite and peanut butter. It's a marshmallow spread, like marshmallow creme.

The flavor mix was great. Thr texture was soft,but managable. Fudge the way all of me likes likes it.

What is marshmallow creme? I would like to make this fudge but in Sydney I have not heard of this ingredient. Is there something I could use as a substitute?

THIS WAS A VERY GOOD CHANGE FROM "REGULAR" CHOCOLATE FUDGE. RAVE REVIEWS FROM ALL OF MY CO-WORKERS. LOVED THE CONSISTENCY.... VERY RICH

An excellent dessert, an interesting variation on traditional fudge. If you cook it correctly the fudge should set quite quickly; take care to transfer the final mixture to your final pan immediately.

Great recipe. Really easy and quick, and my boyfriend's family loved it!!

This is a great recipe. I have gotten raves from people who normally do not like fudge. I make it in a 9x9" square pan to make the pieces more managable. Definately a keeper, this is the third Holiday season I have made it and I doubt people mind this a s a repeat gift!

What a great recipe! I made this last year and everyone raved about it. I agree with the other reviewers who said it was easy. It's a breeze. My guess is for those who had problems getting the fudge to set, is they didn't use a candy thermometer, and they didn't cook it long enough. It takes quite a bit of cooking to reach 230! Not only did I have no problems having it set up quickly into a nice firm fudge, it keeps incredibly well (I did store it in the fridge). The pieces I managed to keep until Christmas looked just as nice as they did the day I made it (unlike some other fudges that start getting crusty, whitish, or grainy). Definitely a new tradition at our house.

I made this fudge for Christmas presents last year : Delicious taste and soft texture. I thought it was a "keeper."

I too had trouble getting it to set. It took at least 24 hours not the 3 stated in the recipe. Also the tin foil becomes imbedded in the fudge if you didn't get it perfectly smooth in the pan. Maybe plastic wrap would be better since it doesn't tear like tin foil. The 8x8 pan sounds like a good idea.

I thought this was easy and quick.Make sure the candy thermometer reads 230 degrees before taking from the heat. I used the 8x8 pan and found that to be perfect size. This recipe is EASY!!I had a hard time finding the tart dried cherries though. Used just regular dried bind cherries and they taste fine.

The flavor is great, but mine would not set, it turned out to be more like fudge sauce than actual fudge.

The fudge did not set, and was hard to get out of pan.

Don't know if I'd make this again. The flavor is OK, but making it in a loaf pan is a little overkill on the thickness, and also makes it difficult to set. Could probably be made in an 8x8 pan with more success.
