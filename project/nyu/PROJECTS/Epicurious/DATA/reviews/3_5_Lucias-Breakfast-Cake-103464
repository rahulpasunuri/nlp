This makes a really different, delicious addtion to a brunch menu. Macaroons or a pavlova are a good way to use up the whites.

Excellent! This is SOOOOOOOOOOOO good. It was gobbled up. Can't wait to make it again. Made it exactly as written and it didn't need a thing. Thou, I bet lemon zest would be a great addition.

Um...YUM! I know where every leftover egg yolk is going for the rest of my life! And sure...you can cut it into 12 servings if you like...then eat TWO of them! Also forgot to glaze it. It still looked nice.

Such a simple and delicious recipe! A real hit! I only baked for 45 minutes and the cake was nice and brown.

This is easy and wonderful as is. Use good quality butter. Baked 45-50 minutes. Next time I will experiment by adding Grand Marnier or Amaretto. But great as is.

This is a gorgeous, simple, dense breakfast cake that we also eat for a snack with tea/coffee, or for dessert. It's sweet but not overly so. Add 1 tsp. almond extract, and decorate the outer rim with 12 whole almonds before baking. Serves 12, not 6! (You don't want to super-size your portion of this rich cake.)

This is fabulous! Hey, folks, it's not supposed to overwhelm you with big fat flavors - just a rich, buttery shortbread! The only change I make is that I hold the measuring spoon over the mixture and overflow it a little with the vanilla extract. LOVE vanilla! I make it frequently for both places I work - people ask me, "Will Lucia be there? Then so will I!" Just eat it straight with a good strong cup of coffee. Heaven! It's also good the next day, if there are any leftovers. Generally there aren't!

I have made this recipe for friends and it turns out great every time -- I serve it with blueberry jam from Sarabeths -- yum!

This recipe just was not good- it was chewy, and virtually tasteless. I wouldn't recommend it.

I have made this several times and it turns out excellect every time. I usually have some left over so I cut it into serving size slices and freeze it. It is still very good after being frozen. Add some sliced fruit and it makes a wonderful breakfast!

This is wonderful - buttery, fragrant, and perfect with a foamy cappuccino. (I live next to a cafe that serves proper Italian-style coffee, and that seems to make all the difference.) A classic combination that takes me right back to Napoli!

This was boring and just not that good or interesting. -Just so-so.

The recipe is very well written, and it tastes pretty good when you make it, i say the more vanilla the better
