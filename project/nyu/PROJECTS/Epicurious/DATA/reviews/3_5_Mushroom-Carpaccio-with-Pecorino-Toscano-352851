This dish beautifully showcases the ingredients. I used a cheese from Italy called Piave Vecchio. I would suggest it, or any other good quality hard cheese. The one criticism that I have of this dish is the lemon. Drizzled on alone, it overpowered the flavors. Next time I would suggest whisking the oil and the lemon into a vinaigrette prior to drizzling.

I've made this salad twice, both times to rave reviews, but with the following modifications: I used truffle olive oil (so the reviewer who suggested truffle salt is definitely on the mark), but I also added a clove of crushed garlic and a small dollop of dijon mustard to the dressing, along with a half packet of Splenda (which slightly mellows the tartness of the lemon juice). This salad is just divine, and the perfect accompaniment to any summer barbecue.

Followed the recipe as written and it turned out great. Light, flavorful, fresh. Next time I would prepare the dish an hour or so before serving so that the mushrooms could soak up more of the olive oil and lemon juice. Be sure to de-vein the celery leaves so that they are more delicate. I will definitely be making this again.

Really nice and light starter. The mushrooms suck up all the flavor from the lemon juice and the olive oil. Just happened to have some truffle salt, so i used that...a little truffle never hurt anything.
