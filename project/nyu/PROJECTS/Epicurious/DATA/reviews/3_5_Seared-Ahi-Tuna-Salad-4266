I could eat this every day, seriously. I added a little extra soy & the dressing was perfect. The wontons were incredibly easy to make & very worth the extra pan. Just keep an eye on the fish. Mine did take about 3 minutes per side because it was kind of thick. Yum!!!!

This is a fantastic recipe! A few changes I made were to add some honey to the dressing (we like a sweeter sesame dressing). I added toasted almonds as another reviewer did also. AND be extrememoy careful with the cooking times for the tuna. I did the 3 minutes per side and it was overdone. This tuna becomes dry if overcooked so next time I will do 1.5 min. per side, and my tuna was about 1 inch thick!

Hubby said it gets five forks and he'd eat it every day. I had to make some changes because of what was on hand. Didn't do the wonton wrappers; cut a regular tomato into wedges in place of cherry tomatoes; used frozen peas in place of snap peas; didn't have any carrots so I boiled some small white and red potatoes and sliced them; nuked a sweet potato in the microwave oven and sliced it; used red leaf lettuce in place of baby lettuce; added some brown sugar to the dressing; finished cooking the tuna in the microwave. All- in-all it was deee-lish!

This recipe is fun, but there is one trick and that is searing the fish. The recipe calls for three minutes. This turned out to be too long for me. I would recommend testing a small piece of Ahi first to determine skillet readiness and time required for desired searing.

Never sent in a review before but this was great and everyone loved it. didn't bother with the wontons but still wonderful

A good, easy salad recipe. I added more ginger, substitued scallions for chives because I had them & added a teaspoon of rice vinegar to the dressing for a little extra zip. I added rice noodles & toasted almonds to the salad for some texture.

I didn't have the snap peas or the fresh chives, and I didn't bother with the wontons, but this was still very good! Instead of sliced carrots, I peeled carrot shavings into the greens. Try not to overcook the tuna - it's very easy to do!

I used half the amt of olive oil, added white wine vinegar to the dressing, and omitted the OJ. This was delicious and a snap to prepare! A local restaurant sells a similar dish for $15. This recipe is actually better.

As is, the dressing lacks zip. The guy with the rice wine vinegar and lemon juice had a good idea, or some wasabi. As for searing the tuna, I followed the review (Bainbridge,WA) that suggested searing for less than a minute on all 6 sides. I did for way less than a minute on ea side and it came out exactly as she had stated. This recipe is a good place to start but it does require tweaking.

This is a great recipe to build off of. I left out the OJ and added 1 T. of sugar and the juice of half a lemon. I also added a dash of rice vinegar. Delicious!

This turned out very well, however I made a few changes... after tasting the dressing, (minus the sesame oil) I thought it needed a little sweetness so I added some brown sugar to taste. This came out much better for my liking. For the salad, I added toasted almonds and sliced mandarin orange segemnts. I loved the wontons, so easy to fry up, and added such nice crunch. I do believe that this salad has great flavor, but next time I will probably maribnate the fish in some of the dressing before I sear it to add flavor. Tweak this dish to make it your own... I did, and the whole family loved it.

I don't make the wontons, I sear the tuna with sesame seeds, slice it thin, lay on a bed of baby greens with mandarin orange sections and cashews then drizzle the dressing over the top. It's awesome. Add a little wasabi-mayonnaise for a little more kick. Wow!

I made this for myself for lunch and felt like I gave myself a treat. It is so good! I used the sushi ready tuna. Make it!

I love seared tuna, but don't think I'll make this again because the pairing of the tuna and the salad didn't work. The dressing was delicious, but was so strong it overpowered the delicate flavor of the seared tuna. I liked both parts, but not together. Also, the wonton strips burned almost immediately--I generally don't deep fry, so don't have the intuition for it, but it seemed awfully hot to me. Finally, I wanted to give a tip for searing fish that I learned from an exceptional NW chef: oil the fish, not the pan. The secret to a great sear is to have a fairly hot (not scalding), dry (preferably cast iron) pan; rub some oil, salt, and pepper on the meat you're searing (this works particularly well with ahi); and lay it in the pan. You'll get a great sizzle and a great crust without smoking the oil, burning the fish, or making a mess, and it's far easier to control the cooking. I also turn the tuna so it's seared on all six sides, which means I'm searing for far less than a minute on each side. The tuna comes out beautifully, with a thin, crispy, spicy rim around perfectly pink, sashimi inside. If you want to use this trick and cook something all the way through, just sear it then stick it in a preheated oven.

Excellent. Agree that you can cut the onion by half. I served it in a martini glass(w/o the stem) and put a few root vegetable chips as a garnish.

I just used the sauce. I marinated a one-inch Ahi steak for 30 minutes in 3 T. extra virgin olive oil. Then I grilled it on one side for 4 minutes. Then I turned it and drizzled the sauce on the cooked side and grilled the other side for 4 minutes. Then I turned off the grill and let it sit with the lid down for about 5 more minutes. Served it with the sauce on the side and a mixed green salad with oranges, sweet onion and red peppers - wow! Fantastic.

The dressing was good but the tuna wasn't very flavorful. I would next time marinate it so that the flavor makes the tuna taste good. I even coated the tuna with wasabi and then the sesame seeds before searing it. So the extra spice helped, but the tuna definitely needed more flavor.

I did toast the sesame seeds, but I'm wondering what's the use? You are cooking them with the fish anyway... Well, it turned out very good, although the cooked seeds smelled a bit like burned popcorn. I added crushed red peppers to the seeds for coating. I also added steamed Dutch yellow potatos, seared asparagus and grape tomatoes to the salad. Bubbles loved it, so I will make this again!

This was delicious! Because of the soy sauce in the dressing, the only other time I added salt was a pinch to the wontons. I sear the Ahi so quickly that it hinges on the rare side. It just about melts in your mouth!! Didn't have any Japanese beer on hand but we had a nice cold Molson Golden!! Ahhh.......One more thing, I used grape tomatoes instead of cherry,I think they are a little sweeter.

Really good. Enjoyed by all. I did adjust several ingredients to suit my family - including cutting down the oil quite a bit. I only used 1/4 cup oil and it was plenty. I also used 1/2 Tbl. sesame oil - alittle goes a long way. I also added a pinch of sugar to offset the tartness. I included napa cabbage (sliced very thin), daikon sprouts and cherry tomatoes to the salad (it was what I had on hand). I didn't bother with the carrots or beans because I was in a rush. I forgot to put the sesame seeds on the fish - but I sprinkled them into the salad when I mixed my ingredients and it turned out great. This is a great recipe and one very open to variations! ps - There's a great gadget for toasting sesame seeds found in japanese or asian stores. It's a doll-sized hinged pan (maybe 5" across) with a mesh cover and a long handle. You swirl it on top of the stove - when the sesames begin to 'pop' they are done. For convenience, you can also buy 'pre toasted' sesame seeds.

As previous reviewers said, it is all about using the best ahi you can find and do not over cook. I used a spice infused oil to saute my ahi. I have made this 3 times and my husband always wants more wontons. Wolfgang Puck sells them at Gelsons so I don't have the mess of making them.

I love Tuna and this dish is great. I serve it every year at my christmas party and there is NEVER enough. My father always orders Ahi if it is on the menu at a restaurant and, so far, he says he has only found one he thought was as good as this. Remember, though, to only SEAR the ahi....a minute a side is about enough!

This is a very special dish. The presentation garnered "wows" galore! And the tastes are fabulous. Of course, the whole thing hinges on top quality tuna that is barely seared...I added tiny dollops of wasabi to the plate, which added a nice zest for those who wished to include it in their bites. Have made this several times and will continue to every time I'm able to get good tuna.

Another excellent recipe, not only tasty but pretty as well!! One recommendation, be EXTRA careful when searing the tuna so not to over cook it (as I did!). I too did not make the wontons and they weren't missed. I added tomatoes with the vegetables and garlic to the dressing. I served it as a first course and split one steak between three people. I will definitely be making this again and again.

People complimented this dish but didn't rave about it. I don't think I'd make it again.

This was a very refreshing dish on a hot summer night. I thought the wontons were so-so and not needed. Be careful to not over cook the Ahi. I bought mine at Wholefoods, they have a great selection of seafood.

WOW!!! Incredible!!! This was our first time making Ahi tuna, and we were a little worried how it would turn out. Not to worry - Epicurious to the rescue!!! We grilled the tuna (making sure it was RARE!), then used the salad dressing as a dipping sauce. Because we grilled the tuna, we did not encrust the tuna with the sesame seeds as directed, but sprinkled the toasted seeds as desired after dipping it into the salad dressing. We never made it to the lettuce or snap peas!!! We did modify the dressing a bit as follows: used only 1/4 C olive oil instead of 1/2 C, and we doubled the amount of chives and ginger. A couple of tips - be sure to salt and pepper the dressing before readjusting the rest of the seasonings; also, be sure to smash the ginger FIRST before mincing it, in order to release all the ginger juice. One more thing - do NOT marinate the tuna in the dressing, unless you want to "cook" the tuna (ah, the voice of experience...)! Absolutely delish!!!

This was excellent and I will definitely make again. Next time I will add some canned mandarin oranges or some fresh orange slices to the salad to add some more texture and flavor.

The recipe is fabulous. If you can't find FRESH, FRESH Tuna, try salmon--it's great as well!

I thought this was a great recipe, and it was easy to make. I didn't make the wontons, because I didn't have time. I also added more snap peas than the recipe called for. The key was definitely FRESH tuna. The sesame seeds added a nice flavor, too.

Wonderful dish! It reminds us of a wonderful salad we enjoyed in a small restaurant on a trip to Napa Valley. Very satisfying!
