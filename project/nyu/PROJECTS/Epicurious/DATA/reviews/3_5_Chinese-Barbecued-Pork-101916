This was really good and simple. Made extra and added it to the pork fried rice recipe from this site.

Suprizingly good and very easy. I used boneless country ribs, marinated overnight and roasted in a 425-450 oven. Will definitely make it again.

5 spice is sweet, sour, bitter, salty and pungent. Make your own 5 spice powder and go with what you like. It is easy. Add ground a touch of ground cinnamon with Bajiao (star anise), Huajiao (ground spicy (red) pepper). Rougui (ground cloves) and Sujiao (ground fennel). Be careful to remove just prior to completion as it will continue to cook.

Excellent-have used it for many years with great success! Do not overcook, as it continues to cook while it stands.

This is worth making. An interesting flavor - the five spice powder. I can understand how some think it's a little over-powering, but I liked the flavor and the sweetness. I roasted it in a 425 oven for 25 minutes or so. Juicy and a different treatment for pork tenderloin. Husband asked to make it again. I will.

I made this last night as part of our NYE's dinner. The meat was very tasty cooked on the grill. I did cut way back on the 5 spice powder, I used about a 1/4 tsp. and the flavor came through very subtly. I would make again.

I baked the tenderloin for 30 min at 425 on a rack over boiling water. The results, as one reviewer stated, were moist and juicy--perfectly cooked. I let the pork marinade for 2-3 days and did not think the marinade permeated the pork excessively. Cooking the pork over charcoal would more closely replicate the Chinese restaurant taste, but for an everyday meal the oven preparation is A-okay.

I just moved to Omaha from the San Francisco Bay Area, and there are no, absolutly NO, chinese delis in this town. But when we tried this recipe, it was great. Very close to the ones we had back in SF, and I only marinaded it for three hours. Also, I baked it instead of grilling it. At 425 degrees it took a little over 20 minutes for 1.25 pounds. turned out juicy and everything!

I think this recipe was awful. That said, I promised myself to make it every time I have company.

Definitely good -- added chili paste and lime juice, and used the remainder of the marinade to flavor veggies as they were cooking, too. Delish.

This recipe is a true keeper; we make it often, and usually double the recipe, and boil the marinade down to a sauce once the meat is ready for grilling. It's so easy, even my husband can throw the ingredients into a ziplock bag and have a great meal ready when I get home from work!

This was easy, delicious, and everyone loved it. I cooked it on a rack in the oven. I'm going to make it again for a special event.

Good. I skipped the five spice and brushed it with Chinese BBQ sauce instead, you can get it in Chinatown and it's called Cha siu sauce. The flavor is much better. Five Spice tastes better in minced pork.

Followed this recipe fairly closely. I will agree that the tenderloins were very moist and juicy, but I wasn't crazy about the flavor. Can anyone suggest a better similar recipe?

Used a grill basket to help with the flipping. Everyone scarfed it down (they loved it) before I could put anything else from the grill out.

Better than what you can get a a restaurant. Tender, juicy, tangy, a real treat.

We thought that this was mediocre, at best. Not wild about the blend of flavors. Even though we decreased the amount of 5-spice powder somewhat, it still seemed to be overwhelming and not quite right. Certainly not a favorite pork tenderloin recipe. We won't make this again.

Great flavor, moist and juicy. My husband isn't crazy about pork but loved this.

i think that this needs a little love to truly bring this dish to a level warranting its repeat appearance. perhaps the best thing about this dish is that it may be a starting block for new comers of chinese cooking that can give you an idea of what you've been tasting in stripmalls the world over. now add subtract sweeten saltitup make this one yo own. try a similar technique with poultry and some sea creatures

FOR THE RED TINT....USE A COUPLE OF DROPS OF RED FOOD COLORING....ADJUST TO JUST HOW MUCH RED YOU WANT

This is a nice recipe, nothing fancy. I would do this recipe again for the fact that I usually have all the ingredients on hand but would possibly explore other recipes before coming back to this one

This was good but lacked some presence. The flavor needed to be stronger or sweeter or something. I can't really put my finger on it. It just seemed like something was missing. It was good - just not mouth watering.

This tastes just like the restaurant, except without the red tint on the exterior. More moist than the restaurant, too.

Delicious! The five spice powder really makes a difference. I made the full recipe for the sauce (used two pork tenderloins) saved 2 Tbls. of it and added the 2 Tbls. of honey, heated it and used it for a little extra flavoring on the pork after slicing. We also used hickory chips on the grill which makes alot of difference.

This dish is so simple, yet so spectacular! My husband's birthday dinner was complete with many complements on this dish!

This was wonderful. Everyone raved about it. I served it with asian slaw and cold sesame noodles. Make extra. It's also wonderful as a leftover.

I made this recipe twice: Once with the 5-spice powder and once without. I much preferred it without as the 5-spice powder taste was overwhelming and too sweet for my taste (the primary flavor was cinnamon). I recommend it either without the 5-spice powder or with a much smaller amount.

This was a very easy and excellent tasting pork recipe. I used the full marinade recipe for one tenderloin and marinated it 24 hours. Very flavorful.

Perfect !!! Just exactly like my favorite chinese restaurant. They wouldn't share their recipe. You did and thank you. Pass the hot mustard sauce and enjoy.
