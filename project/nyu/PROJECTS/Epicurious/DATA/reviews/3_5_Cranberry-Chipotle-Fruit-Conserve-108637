I have made this numerous times and everyone absolutely loves it. Tastes better a few days old. Last Holiday season, I bought glass compotes at the Dollar store, and gave it out as gifts with a beautiful card suggesting how to use it and a big red bow. Very well received.

Yow. This is exceptional. Made just as directed, except it looked a little dry so I added some apple cider to loosen it up. I've never tasted anything like it, and it is addictively wonderful.

Made this and Cranberry-Ginger chutney. Both delicious. This is a bit more "savory" but I don't want it any sweeter! Most everyone seemed impressed. I would even add a bit more chipotle en adobo next time

Our family holiday gatherings are usualy about 20-25 people. I fully expected there to be some left to enjoy with leftover turkey. Nope. Not a drop. The flavor combinations are intriguing. And, the balance is perfect. This is now a holiday staple for our family. Like the other favorable review, I too used organic fruit.

Nearly perfect just the way the recipie is written. Maybe even a little sweet. I used organic dried fruit, so that may have contributed to the sweetness.

It needs more than just the maple syrup to sweeten it, otherwise it's waaay too tart!
