Blah. I suppose there are times when the simplicity of this recipe might be appealing but I wished I'd added something, anything--crushed red pepper, cumin, some sort of season to rescue this boring side-dish.

We really enjoyed this dish. Simple, tasty, and it doesn't get any easier.

I cut back on the oil and added orange juice(about 1/3 c) to squash while cooking. The squash took about 20 minutes on medium heat. Then glazed with orange marmalade instead of honey(more flavorful). Make sure you salt and pepper generously. The combination of sweet/tart/salt was outstanding with theshort ribs.

Great if you like plain cubes of squash with a little honey mixed in... Quite bland. I had to cook the squash a lot longer than 12 minutes; I don't like my squash crunchy.

Cut back a little on the honey, added a touch of cinnamon at the end for extra flavor. Overall a great recipie--delicious, simple, quick and pretty healthy. great for a college student like myself!

I made this dish on Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it. I substituted maple syrup for the honey and it was still a hit. I'll definitely make it again next year.

Tried this tonight with fresh garden butternut squash here in AZ. Too hot to use the oven and this was ideal. We loved it.

This was a hit in our house. It's a perfect, quick Autumn side dish. Just the right touch of sweetness with the honey. We will definitely make it again.
