Excellent! Used 1/2 of chipotle, otherwise it would have been too spicy hot for us, and did not puree the hominy.

Enjoyed a lot. Didn't have apricot preserves but did have fresh apricots, which I chopped and to which I added about a tablespoon of sugar, some water and apple juice (and of course the chipotles). Used corn instead of hominy, which needed help - perhaps, as others have suggested, some chicken broth. But overall an easy, interesting weekday meal. And by the way, I think the recipe means half of the sauce on each fillet (not half total), although I did have extra which I added to the corn/hominy mixture and put on the table as a condiment.

What happens to the other half of the glaze? Recipe says "spread half of glaze on salmon." Never mentions the other half...

I followed the recipe, except I used a slightly thicker cut of salmon, and I used a touch more chipotle chiles since we like spicy foods and my guest has a palate honed in Texas. I cooked the salmon an extra few minutes, and it turned out delicious and moist (flaking and fork tender). While my guest enjoyed the hominy, I was not a fan. I would definitely cook the fish again, and perhaps use polenta or potatoes instead.

Couldn't be easier, prettier, or tastier. Subbed peach preserves for apricot and minced scallions for cilantro,because that's what was on hand (also husband hates cilantro), but I doubt those things changed the character of the recipe. I've always loved hominy and had my doubts about pureeing it, but we loved it this way. This one will be a regular in our house.

was ok...didn't think the chipotle worked with salmon

This is really great! My husband who doesn't eat fish very often has talked about this recipe for weeks after I made it for him. Be careful...My husband can eat really hot spice food and I can't! If you can't eat mild Buffalo Wings (which I can't) then you need to go easy on this sauce.

This is a great glaze, but the texture of the pureed hominy was less desirable to me than if the hominy were left whole. I think next time, I will simmer the hominy in a flavored broth to infuse flavor rather than puree it. Overall, great dish.

What a great recipe! I had discarded the juice from the hominy, so I used chicken broth instead to thin the puree- it was delicious! And the chipotle glaze would be fantastic on pork or even brushed on to grilled chicken.

This has become a weekly dish during salmon season which is just beginning. (Copper River opens May 16-Yay.) I made as written the first time. Modified it slightly for the subsequent, reducing the apricot just a little and slightly increasing vinegar. With wild caught fresh Alaskan king salmon, this is just about the perfect dish. Because it is asparagus season as well, a weekly meal to rave about. Have used this glaze on pork and chicken also with great success. I don't bother with the sieve. Put the chipotle in adobos, cumin, vinegar and preserve in a food processor and simple becomes simpler.

OK, but the salmon/chipotle flavors just didn't do much together in my wife's and my opinion. Liked the hominy, though!

This was the easiest recipe I have ever made! I didnt change a thing, and I loved how it came out.

This was excellent. I used peach jam instead of apricot because that's what I had on hand. I would definitely make this again

Absolutely delicious and so simple! I used chives instead of cilantro in the hominy and it was great. I do think the glazed salmon would have been too sweet on its own - the hominy was the perfect foil. Easy enough for a Tuesday night, fancy enough for a weekend dinner.

I totally agree with the other reviewers. Easy and delicious! I'd never had hominy before (always thought of it as southern redneck food), but was pleasantly surprised. I think the sauce has possibilities on other dishes too such as ground turkey burgers or BBQ ribs.

Made this last night for my hubbie, who is a gourmet cook. Doubled the hominy and cilantro, but otherwise followed the directions as written. Would definitely make this again since it's easy and quick. I grilled asparagus drizzled with olive oil, salt and pepper- what a nice presentation as well. Absolutely delicious. We were licking our plates.

This is so good and so easy - my favorite combination! I made the salmon exactly as written but didn't have hominy on hand so I served the salmon over polenta with black pepper and parmesan. I love cilantro and I can't wait to make this again with the hominy. Excellent weeknight dinner and would be an easy dish to serve guests. Enjoy!
