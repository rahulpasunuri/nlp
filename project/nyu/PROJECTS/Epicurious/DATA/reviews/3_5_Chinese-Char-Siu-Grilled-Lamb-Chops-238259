I give the marinade high marks, but I only gave 2 forks for recipe because I think it completely overwhelmed an expensive cut of lamb. I will definitely use the marinade again....with pork.

This is my new favorite way to prepare lamb chops! The flavors are so unique especially with the lamb. Served with Lemony Sugar Snap Pea stir-fry, and Jasimine rice with Garlic, Ginger, & Cilantro (from this website). I started with Thai Cucumber Salad with Roasted Peanuts and Mussels with Coconut Curry Sauce.

We have a lamb marinade that is tough to beat but this one came in at a close second. WE enjoyed it, didn't find it too sweet at all. Yum.

I really didn't care for these. They just didn't taste very good. I still like marinating lamb chops in olive oil, garlic and rosemary.

I substitute curry spices for the five spice powder and throw in a little red pepper.

This is a fantastic recipe as is. I love just grilled lamb chops with salt and pepper but at times like to change it up a bit. The marinade does a great job of cutting the richness of the high fat content in lamb chops. I like one of the reviewer's idea of doing them as double chops. I'm going to try that next time.

We love this - I'm actually getting it to copy into my database. This, a bok choy salad, sesame asparagus and some grilled sweet potatoes - I served that to many a guest over the summer. Yum!

Excellent. Followed the recipe exactly except could not get the French lamb chops. Trimmed my chops well and marinated 24 hours. They were a hit with everyone. Served after the Halloumi cheese with fava bean and mint salad and alongside braised baby bok choy. Dessert was lime and lemon posset. Wonderful meal.

Bought Rack of Lamb and cut into two rib chops....substituted curry for five spice powder...this was fabulous with those modifications.

Not bad, but this recipe didn't really do it for us - too fragrant and sweet.

Delicious. I marinated the lamb for 24 hours. Will try this marinade with pork next time.

This was fantastic - I don't usually give 4 forks - but just made this for a party to rave reviews. Made exactly as described, except I did use it on chicken breast as well to round out the more expensive lamb. Yum!

I don't give out 4 forks easily and this recipe deserves it. It is so easy and the flavor is fantastic. I made the full recipe of marinade for 6 lamb chops and marinated for about 24 hours. The flavor really comes through and the chops are so moist.

I made this recipe for guests and we all enjoyed it and agreed we'd make it again. I used 24 lamb chops, doubled the marinade recipe, and marinated it overnight.

We made this with lamb tenderloin. I didn't taste much of the flavor even though it was marinated over 7 hours.
