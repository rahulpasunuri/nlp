Thanks for the pineapple tip. Didn't have oranges either and wouldn't have thought of substituting pineapple. It was delicious. I too heated the compote slightly (nuked it a few seconds) to take the chill out. My husband loved it. Fresh, flavorful and healthy.

Didn't have any oranges. Substituted pineapple. It was quite tasty.

Very tasty, low fat recipe for turkey tenders. Followed the recipe exactly. Love the compote with the combination of sweet oranges and tomatoes with the briney capers - nice contrast with the mustardy turkey coating. The picky BF liked it too.

Really excellent and simple dish. I was in a pinch so I used drained mandarin oranges. They were really good, but fresh oranges are definitely better. Also, I doubled the garlic and it was even better. My whole family loved this recipe, sans the capers.

I assume the "1/4 dijon mustard" meant 1/4 cup? Very tasty and healthy meal. Will make this again!

A most incredible compote! I grilled the turkey and served it with pesto pasta and a salad. The compote flavors sung with each part of the meal. At another meal, I served the compote over salmon and it was exceptional.

This went over really well at my last dinner party. Minor alterations: I left out the capers just because I don't like them, and I used blood oranges instead of regular. I didn't want the compote to be cold, so I warmed it up in a pan first - but not enough to cook it. People raved, and it's a really beautiful dish on the table.
