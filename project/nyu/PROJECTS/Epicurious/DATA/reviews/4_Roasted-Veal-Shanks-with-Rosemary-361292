Very delicious... and great for entertaining since you can make ahead. My husband (who is very picky) loved it. I did cook the meat at a lower temp (350) and for a longer amount of time adding stock as needed. Also I did not puree vegetables but just left them as they were... Will definitely save this recipe...

This was good, but not wonderful, I was disappointed as I was hoping for much more flavor. Very important to get whole veal shanks, which are hard to find and expensive, as pre-cut slices will disappear into nothing.

emeisel: this recipe uses whole veal shanks, while osso buco is cross cut into slices for cooking.

This is not a review; but a question. What is the difference between 'Roasted Veal Shanks with Rosemary' and "osso-buco"?? Thanks!

Would this recipe work almost as well with lamb shanks, which I can get easily? Not gamey lamb but nice quality.

I made the entire Fruili menu for a birthday dinner. The favorites were the veal and gnocchi, though everything was liked. I almost gave up on finding this cut of meat. Butchers told me it would take 2 weeks to order. Finally, I found it at a gourmet grocer, and the 2 shanks weighed 5 1/3 lbs total. The sauce and meat had a complex, rich flavor, and the veal had a silky moist texture. Doesn't require too much hands-on time.
