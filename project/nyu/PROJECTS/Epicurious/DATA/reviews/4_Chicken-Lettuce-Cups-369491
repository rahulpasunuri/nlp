These are great! I used ground turkey instead of minced chicken, fresh mushrooms in place of canned, and bamboo shoots instead of water chestnuts. Served a little extra hoisin sauce on the side. I also made five-spice beet soup to serve alongside, but this really could be an awesome light/simple dinner on its own.

Loved these. Made with ground turkey and bamboo shoots instead of water chestnut. Turned out great. Try and find a uniform head of lettuce, ours was hard to pull nice cups off of. I will add a little heat next time and might try some peanut butter like another reviewer.

so good and so easy. left out the mushrooms because my husband doesn't like them and used bamboo because i had it and not water chestnuts. added sriracha for heat at the end. delicious!

very tasty but really salty, even after cutting down soy sauce to just 1 tbsp and omitting the salt! next time i'd use just 1/2 tbsp of soy sauce. i'd also leave the water chestnuts a bit more chunky to give it more crunch. ended up using fresh shitake mushrooms rather than the canned, and used ground turkey to simplify. this was really tasty though--good flavor and the cashews and cilantro were an excellent touch! the hubby said this was one of the best dinners i've made in a long time...will most definitely be adding this to the rotation.

Fantastic recipe - I kept everything as is, but added a 1-2 tablespoons of organic peanut butter to give it a nuttier flavour. Gone within minutes!

Excellent recipe, with just a few minor changes. I used minced fresh shiitake mushrooms, no red onion, romaine leaves instead of iceberg, and a couple shakes of crushed red pepper in the sauce. I also served it with sriracha sauce for those who wanted a spicy kick. Whole family loved it and I've made it twice now. It's a keeper.

Man, these were tasty. And easy! The kind of thing that keeps you going back to the leftovers for another spoonful. I happened to have cabbage in the fridge and no iceberg, so I went with that. Extra crunchy, but I must say, I liked them that way.

Selected this recipe to make for a family dinner night. Since the dinner is on a weeknight I liked the simplicity and that most of prep could be done the night before. I carried all ingredients to the dinner location and prepared there. Unfortunately, I forgot the rice vinegar and had to substitute apple cider vinegar. Since I haven't made the recipe previously, we didn't know the difference. I doubled the recipe for a group of 11 adults and 4 small children and there wasn't a bite left even though we had many other dishes. I plan to make again next week for visitors and this time I'll remember the rice vinegar! I increased the cashews and incorporated into the chicken mixture just before serving. Served cilantro leave on the side.
