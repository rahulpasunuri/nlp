This dressing was so delicious that my guests were eyeing the last drops and each other...barely able to converse. One told me later that had he been at home he would have licked the bowl! And that my friends is a 4 star recommendation. :) My addition - the salad flavors are very balanced...salty, sweet, tart.

Good-the dressing would probably be better is blended as mine separated somewhat-addition of nuts would also be nice

Served this at Christmas dinner....best salad I've ever made, it was a hit. Added pine nuts and couldn't find the dried cherries, used dried cranberries (cherry flavored) instead!!

I make this frequently with fresh Bing cherries.it is terrific with good bacon, fresh fruit and gorgonzola.

The dried cherries and bacon were a perfect match, but I think the dressing needs a bit more flare. It was good though.

This salad went over well at a family dinner. I just used danish blue cheese and the dressing made the salad.

I made this salad for our Thanksgiving dinner this year. Everyone commented on what terrific flavor the salad had. It's festive to use for special occasions or easy enough to use for weekday dinners too. I can hardly get my fiance' to eat salads, but this one is a keeper. Besides, how can you go wrong with the bacon and the cheese?

Doubled the recipe for a dinner party of 8 and was the perfect amount. Added candied walnuts for extra flavor. Also this time I used crumbled blue cheese instead of the Roquefort and it was just as good. Everyone loved it.

Didn't like the dressing at all. My roquefort was too mushy to crumble and I didn't use anywhere near the quantity suggested in the recipe. Dried cherries were just ok, cranberries would have been better to lend more tartness. Threw half of it away, couldn't eat it.

Easy, extraordinary. Be sure not to over saturate with the dressing.

I love this recipe. I've made it for years. I lost the recipe, but today I remembered where I'd found it and I was so excited to be able to get it again. I will continue to make this salad, everyone loves it.

Excellent, hearty salad. Be careful not to overdress the lettuce, as the dressing is very rich but spectacular. A little goes a long way! I'll be making this again, for sure.

good recipe for Presidents' Day -- what with cheese ("something's rotten in Denmark"), the bacon (representing porkbarrel legislation) and cheeries -- for Geo. Washington of course.

This salad was absolutely sublime. Not usually a fan of fruit mixed with salty tastes, this combination was fabulous. I've been asked for this recipe more than any other. A definite keeper.

Everyone licked their salad plates clean with this one. Will definitely make this again, AND have already been asked for the recipe. A great winter salad!

This was a big hit at a recent dinner party. It is unbelievably easy and elegant. Some of my guests do not like roquefort so instead of mixing the cheese in with the vinaigrette, I served it to the side to sprinkle on as they pleased. I also added roasted pecans to each plate. I definitely would make this again. . .often.

Awesome!! made for Xmas dinner. Everyone loved it! I used champagne vinegar and added a bit of buttermilk and less mayo. When you're the salad queen, you have a reputation to live up to and this one was a hit!

Just made this salad and everyone loved it. The recipe yields way more dressing than you'll need for two heads of lettuce, but really de-lish! You can half it and still have enough.

This is fantastic just the way it is, but ALSO with fresh Bing cherries (halved and pitted). Sometimes, I even add cAramelized onions to it. The dressing, cherries and butter lettuce are terrific.

Outstanding!

I have made this recipe a number of times and each time I get rave reviews. I have also used light mayonaise and did not miss any of the fat. I am planning to make it again for Valentine's Day!

Rating: 4
Delicious! I agree with the reviews that say butter lettuce makes a difference - its smoothness can't be beat. I, too, use Hellman's Light if I'm in a hurry, but homemade mayonnaise raises it from very good to great!

Out of this world! I used Hellmann's Light Mayo and tasted rich and fantastic! My guests all were wowed by this salad on Christmas, thank you!

Outstanding! I have made this at least 20 times -sometimes I use gorgonzola and it is still wonderful. I have even used the packaged butter lettuce and raddichio salad mix in a bag (lazy cow) and people still love it.

This is a brilliant salad in its simplicity. Refreshingly different. I love salads with a minimum of ingredients but that are well-thought-out and complemented by a unique, not-too-heavy dressing. This is it.

Rating: 4
Fantastic. I made this for part of our Valentine's dinner & it was wonderful. I tasted the (recommended type) blue cheese on it's own & thought it was incredibly strong, but it was perfect in the dressing in combination with everything else. I used cherry flavored dried cranberries instead of dried cherries because they were sold in smaller portions and were less expensive. The butter lettuce was great & I wouldn't substitute any other kind. Enjoy!

Great salad-all my favorites represented here. Instead of cherries I used dried cranberries.

Rating: 3
Delicious! Served it with roast tenderloin - a perfect accompaniment. I agree about the preferred tartness of the sun dried cherries, but the choice of cherry is limited at the store -what I bought (not that tart) worked well!

I made this recipe without the bacon because I didn't have any on hand. My family and I thought it was delicious. Next time I'll make sure I have the bacon!!!

Overall, a very flavorful salad. I was a bit concerned with the color of the dressing (it was grey in appearance), however when mixed with the lettuce, you couldn't really tell. A nice start to a special meal.
