This was so easy and good. I skipped the celery leaves. I had lots of excess sauce and used it on grilled steak with the cauliflower on the side. Excellent!

Made a more traditional tarator sauce with just walnuts. This is a great idea for cauliflower, and also a great excuse for tarator sauce where seafood isn't really practical.

It is delicious but the sauce came out very thick and pale brown -- not very appetizing! I see that there is another recipe for tarator sauce using almonds that calls for about 3/4 cup of water. I'll add water to thin it to a pourable consistency next time. Note that the oil does have to be added slowly - like making mayonaise. (I used 1/3 cup, I might even reduce it to 1/4 cup, just to reduce the fat.) Instead of celery leaves I shredded the nice fresh leaves from the cauliflower itself - I recommend it.
