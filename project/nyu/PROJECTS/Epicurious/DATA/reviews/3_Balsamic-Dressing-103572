I gave this recipe 4-stars for the flavor of the dressing, which I thought was exceptional. I highly recommend processing the finished dressing with a little water though for a more fluid consistency. Season it with salt and pepper, and this dressing is a winner.

This was quite delicious. As with all highly flavored dressings, I tossed it gently with the greens so that the dressing evenly and lightly coated each leaf. If you do that, you'll love it! I served this tossed with spinach and arugula under sliced sirloin steak. Superb. Next time I will peel the tomato; the texture of the skin made it harder than I think it should have been to distribute this dressing evenly in the salad.

This is excellent and a keeper. I made crab cakes and served them on a bed of mixed greens using this as the dressing, it was a big hit. The key is not to reduce it to much.

I don't know what I did wrong, but my concoction burned. I used very high quality vinegar ($28.00 per bottle) which is quite thick to start with so maybe that was the problem.

I didn't have any ginger on hand so used shallots instead and this is now one of my favorite salad dressings. It's perfect with a roasted butternut squash salad with arugula and candied pumpkin seeds.

I've made this recipe numerous times and my husband raves about it. I make it in a batch, 5 times the amount every month, minimum. I don't always have some tomatoes on hand and have substituted them with tomato sauce. Excellent!

Obviously, this one isn't to everyone's taste, but my family has loved it since the recipe first appeared. The dressing is very thick, very strong-tasting, and does look like a goopy mess, but once you've mixed it well into a salad it is great (assuming you like these strong flavors). Make sure to use good lettuce that can stand up to all this garlic and ginger.

What went wrong? This was the goopiest, stickiest thing I have ever seen -- completely inappropriate to put on delicate greens. What a mess.

I love this dressing. Any good foodie worth their salt should have all ingredients handy. Made it on a whim one afternoon before 12(some unknown)dinner guests arrived. All raved! It is a breeze to make and the taste as well as the aroma is fantabulous! A little does go a long way...make sure and tell your guests.

I have made this many times already. It's the first fat-free dressing I've ever liked. Additionally, it is very good with grilled vegetables.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dressing alot. The consistency is quite thick and at first I didn't think it would be so great, but the flavor and texture worked perfectly. My suggestion is not to put a glop of it on top of your salad, but to toss the dressing thoroughly with the greens before you put the salads in individual bowls, then all of the greens are lightly and evenly coated and delicious. This was the perfect accompaniment to a very rich meal (cheese fondue). Tangy and light and very tasty.

Yuck. I love balsamic vinegar, but this was way too tart, thick and disgusting.
