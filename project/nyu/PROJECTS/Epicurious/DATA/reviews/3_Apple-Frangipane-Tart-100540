Apparently I'm in the minority, but I thought this was mediocre. Not enough almond taste, not sweet enough, and Golden Delicious apples didn't add any apple flavor at all. It looked beautiful but was just completely bland. I definitely wouldn't bother with this recipe again.

This was a beautiful tart (appearance and taste). Everyone loved it - including kids. It didn't last long. Used raw orange blossom honey for the glaze and pure european butter for the crust. Received so many compliments!

I brought this to a dinner party of 3 couples and even though I cut in in 8 pieces all 8 were quickly scarfed up. I am going to make it for a Thanksgiving gathering and will add 2 apples to the almond paste as was suggested by an earlier comment. Beautiful presentation!

One of my favorites, but plan for the time it takes to make.

I used Phillsbury ready made crust but made the filling as instructed and it came out grrreat! I'm definitely will be making this again in future.

very good, not too difficult. I think I will use some almonds on top next time, and maybe some pears. Like the suggestion to add apple to the almond paste. Will try that!

I found this cake quite delicious. I brought it along as a dessert to a dinner party and it received lots of compliments. It also looked quite pretty (I placed the apple slices in a sort of 'snail' pattern). I'm not sure if i used the correct type of 'almond paste' - in a Sydney supermarket I found 'almond flavoured paste' which is normally put under the icing of wedding cakes, but I think it is the same thing. Otherwise I wonder if you could substitute marzipan? I only used up one apple.

have made this several times and it's always a great success, both visually and taste-wise.

The crust for this recipe is great- easy to make, light, and crispy. I've made this recipe twice so far. The first time, I made it as stated and it was good, but nothing extraordinary. The second time I made it with pears- twice the amount of fruit on top and I boiled two small ripe pears in sugar water and mashed them into the pear mixture (needed some extra flour to compensate for the extra liquid) and then I sprinkled some extra sliced almonds on top. The second time was much, much better.

Try it with Grany Smith apples. Add 2 apples to the almond paste mix, It will really taste like a french frangipane apple pie.

This is both beautiful and delicious--and easy to make, too.
