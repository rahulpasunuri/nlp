This is a nice easy raita. I made with organic 1% yogurt from Trader Joe's. I added more cucumber than the recipe called for (I had a large english cucumber and just added the whole thing) and I wish I hadn't, but it was still nice with good flavor. It benefited from a few drops of lemon juice. Somehow not quite a wonderful as the cucumber raita at my local restaurant, though. Maybe I should have used full fat yogurt.

Yummy - and wonderful with the chicken masala and cumin carrots. Having made Raita before I changed it up just a little - Added more Cucumber, a dash of Cumin Powder and a squirt of lemon. Yumm Yumm!
