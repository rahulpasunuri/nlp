Love, love, love the flavors in this dish! I didn't have burrata, and don't know where I could get it, but I chopped up some fresh mozzarella and added cream to it. Poured that mixture over the pasta and it was fabulous! My husband was thrilled too. Will certainly be making it again.

This recipe was good, but not anything special. I will make it again because it was embarrassingly easy and I love burrata, but I'll definitely never make it for company.

well, obviously use more garlic, since most recipes are really skimpy when it comes to aromatics. i also suggest coarsely grinding the almonds so they coat the noodles consistently. otherwise, this is a wonderful way to prepare pasta. fresh burrata is a real splurge, but elevates this dish to a whole other level.

This was delicious, especially considering how little effort it required. I used fresh mozz instead of the burrata cheese, and just chopped almonds cuz I didn't have sliced. Took 15 min to prepare.

My 8-year old daughter and I made this for dinner for the family and we loved it. Don't skip the spinach because it is delicious with the lemon flavors. A perfect light summer dinner.

I listened to everyone saying use more lemon, but I guess I went overboard- it was WAY too lemony. I think I over killed the lemon zest too, so beware with the lemon. I added chopped asparagus as well, which gave it some crunch.

I just made it......one person dinner. It was tasty but not FAB. The cheese didn't melt. The best part was the lemon flavor.....fresh lemons from my tree.

Fabulous!!! I used the French brousse cheese which is similar to riccota. I never measure but I used a lot more of everything than the recipe indicated. The ingredients are wonderful--you just have to play with them to your taste. The grilled almonds are essential--don't leave them out.

This was pretty good, I used fresh mozzarella, I'll make it again if I can find Burrata. I would suggest increasing the garlic, lemon juice and lemon peel, but all in all this was a quick and tasty dish.

this is a very easy and fresh tasting dish. i pureed some basil with olive oil and tossed the entire dish before serving. i think that added the extra flavor some other folks were missing. must use burrata - it is amazing!

This has become one of our family's favorithe weekday dishes. When I can, I buy the burrata at Zabar's (NYC) or at Di Bruno Bros. (Philadelphia), otherwise, I use fresh mozzarela. Truly delicious either way!!

I've made this several times and it's gotten rave reviews from everyone I've served it to. I substituted shallots for the garlic and was generous with the lemon juice and lemon peel. I also used fresh mozarella and skipped the almonds. It has a great fresh taste and makes the perfect side dish to grilled steak.

Very bland. I couldn't get burrata so used fresh buffalo-milk mozzarella instead. Even though I doubled the garlic, it was a pretty boring, relatively flavourless dish.

This was easy and delicious. Substituted fresh mozzarella when I couldn't find burrata cheese. Otherwise followed recipe as is, and it was great. Kids and adults liked it!
