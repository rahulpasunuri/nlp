this is my first time making gelato/ice cream. I am very disappointed with the results, but think that it is something that I did and not the recipe. The flavor is good, but consistency is not creamy and smooth , but watery and icy. Does anybody have any ideas, what went wrong? Is it possible I didnt chill the mixture enough before putting it in the ice cream maker?

This gelato is absolutely delicious, that is not the problem at all. The problem is that despite claiming it makes a 'scant qt', I found that, incredibly annoyingly, it made less than half of that amount. For no more time or effort I could have doubled the recipe and certainly will next time. I might also add some form of chips at the last moment to give it some crunch - a good chocolate, toasted nuts or chocolate coated coffee beans would all work very well.

Based on previous comments I changed the recipe to read as follows I doubled the recipe; now it will yield 3 pints 16 oz hazelnuts 3 cups milk 3 cups cream 10 eggyolks 1 cup sugar I made it twice, once with straining and once without. With straining is definately smoother. Basically I added 50% more hazelnuts and added more cream. I put the mixture thru a chinois and with a ladle squeezed all the hazelnuts. DELICIOUS. Try this recipe you will love it

Does anyone know if this can be made without an ice cream maker? Can I freeze it in a different container?

excellent. i put the chilled custard through a strainer lined with cheese cloth before freezing it, removed a lot of the grit. doesn't make much, but worth the effort...next time I'll make at least a double batch.

This turned out fabulous! I loved it. Straining was definitely needed both times.

This was a good recipe. My friends enjoyed it for dessert with coffee. However, i felt it tasted a little like a peanut butter ice cream. But, i guess all nuts seem similar in taste sometimes. Was good though.

I have always loved hazelnut gelato, and have constantly bought them from ice-cream parlours. This recipe came very close to the gelato I adore. I found the correct recipe contained too much sugar (the original recipe is supposed to have an additional quarter cup plus 2tbs. of sugar beaten with the egg yolks). DO strain the chopped nuts out very well after you steep them, preferably with a cheesecloth. Other than that, I will make this again.

We're sitting here eating it right now. It's soo good we couldnt wait for the machine to finish before sticking in our spoons. A little long to prep before putting it in the machine, but well worth the wait.

MMMMMmmm this is outstanding. I used a cup of cream and decreased the milk accordingly so it would be even creamier. And THANK YOU to those who noted that the recipe was missing an extra 1/4 c plus 2T sugar to beat with the yolks. Definitely strain the nuts out. Too gritty otherwise. You won't be disappointed!

Fabulous! I measured the hazelnuts by weight instead of volume, and it was more than a cup, but the gelato had great flavour. Thanks to previous reviewers for pointing out the missing sugar in the recipe, that was very helpful. This recipe didn't yield anything close to a quart, more like a pint. I'll double it next time. My guests LOVED it.

To bertyg, re: doubling the recipe. The second time I made this I doubled the recipe and it turned out just fine. I think we only got 5 servings out of the batch as listed here.

Has anyone doubled this recipe? Or, is it unadvisable? Also, has anyone made it with only the 1/4 + 2tbs of sugar?

My husband and I thought this was out of this world. I made it to remind him of his favorite gelato in Italy, and we both agreed it exceeded our memories. While this involves an extra step in the gelato-making process, it is totally worth it. This is a fabulous recipe. I served it sprinkled with toasted hazelnuts--wow!

After reading earlier reviews I added one tablespoon hazelnut syrup, and a small amount of the steeped nuts. Wonderful! Next time I'll reduce sugar to balance the added sugar in syrup.

This tasted nothing like the hazelnut gelato in Italy. It would have been much better to leave the ground hazelnuts in the mixture for texture - in Europe true gelato is made from milk & cream that has not gone through all of the pasteurization processes USA dairy products go through and thus has an amazingly creamy, rich, dense texture. This was more like hazelnut ice milk.

Excellent! Very smooth and creamy with a strong hazelnut flavor. I think you could use the steeping technique for other nuts, coconut etc. As another reviewer noted, make sure you beat the yolks with an additional 1/4 c. + 2T sugar, which is not noted in the recipe ingredients online (although it's correct in the magazine).

This gelato is AMAZING. Simply divine! Smooth, creamy, decadent...There is a misprint in the online version, however. Altogether there is 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons of sugar (1/4 cup when pulsed with hazelnuts and salt and 1/4 cup and 2T when beaten with egg yolks). The only things I did differently was that I strained the hazelnuts out later (right before chilling) and I strained through an incredibly fine mesh sieve (actually, a gold coffee filter after straining through a larger sieve)...Bravo!
