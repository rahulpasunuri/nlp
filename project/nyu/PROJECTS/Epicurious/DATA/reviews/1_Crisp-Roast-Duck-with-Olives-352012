Duck was a little over done,but fat rendered beautifully. I thought the sause was way too salty. I'd cut the time to two and a half hours and crisp it for 20 minutes at about 450 F.

Followed instructions to the letter, but the duck was overdone;I've only myself to blame because something told me that a three hour and forty- five minute oven-time was excessive, but I went ahead anyway. On the plus side, the remarkably simple sauce (Hit it a few times with an immersion blender) was different and intriguing, quite tasty actually; also I recovered nearly two cups of golden duck fat which I look forward to using. Whether that makes up for fifteen dollars worth of duck jerky is something else again
