Delicious. Easy to prepare, and everyone loved it.

This is a fantastic dish and I made it for Easter with a ham and the asparagus and morel recipe. Invest in a mandolin or slicer becuase you want uniform and thin slides and you can quickly slice the potatoes without them turning brown. I made the recipe exactly as printed not adding any cheese.

This is a spectacular dish. I made it for my boyfriend (exactly per the recipe) alongside garlic chicken and a chopped Brussels sprout and kale salad and we were both amazed by how richly delicious the potatoes were. We ended up eating them as leftover for the next 3 nights! I didn't have a z slicer or mandolin and just sliced the potatoes with a sharp knife- took a bit more time but came out great and totally worth the effort. I also added some shaved pecorino on top just for fun . I highly recommend this dish.

Have made this recipe exactly as written for Christmas twice and both times it turned out AMAZING. Just tried a slightly healthier version and am very pleased with how it turned out. Simply substituted the heavy cream for 2% milk with flour added and a little olive oil (1 Tablespoon flour per cup of milk) and left the skins on the potatoes (I used red).

Just for fun I substituted a Maui Onion for the fennel, and then added "smoked" Mozzarella...and it all came together with a steak bbq & brussels sprouts. But thank you for the basic ingredients, and the comments by everyone...so helpful.

My sweetie printed out this recipe last night before I could object to the fennel, which we didn't have and which I detest. We halved the recipe and made it with about 2 pounds of trader joe's "gold" potatoes, but otherwise aimed to make it as written...except we didn't have heavy cream or rosemary sprigs. We don't have a mandolin, so I carefully sliced the potatoes, skin on, as thinly as I could, with a santoku knife. We substituted whole milk mixed with nonfat greek yogurt. (This worked fairly well, but it seemed to separate during baking, probably because we didn't blend it carefully. By the time it was done, it all looked and tasted great, however) We pressed one clove of garlic into the milk mixture and sprinkled in lots of dried rosemary. I think one other reviewer noted that they added salt. I'm not a big salt user, but felt the dish needed a little more than called for in the recipe. We sliced the garlic thinly and used a little extra, along with more dried rosemary on the buttered baking dish. During assembly, we added fresh shredded parmesan between each layer of potato. The baking temperature, method, and time was right on target. Very good dish, might be fun to make with kids (except the potato slicing part)

This dish was amazing! I added the Gruyere cheese as suggested. You know the dish was good when your guests go back for second and third helpings! Definitely a keeper recipe.

Unbelievably good. I made it for Easter and my family demolished the entire dish! I made no changes, nor will I in the future as they have requested this dish for Easter 2013!

This is just excellent. I've already made it half a dozen times, and have served it to several guests. I skip both the rosemary and the garlic, neither is necessary. The subtle sweetness of the fennel is lovely against the starch and cream. I do increase the salt to a full Tbs of kosher, but follow the rest as written. I do sometimes have to cook it longer during the high heat portion. You really want good dark color on the potatoes for the best flavor, and my oven can be finicky.

I made this dish over the weekend for a pot luck dinner and it was AMAZING. Replaced fennel with some sweet onion and added a bit of grated sharp cheddar right at the end. This is a "go to" potato side dish.

This was simply amazing! I had never been able to make scalloped potatoes that I liked. This one won the prize. I used the heavy whipping cream only and no cheese at all. I have also made a variation, where midway thru I added a layer of ground beef with chopped veggies. Turned out great!

Added some Gruyere and freshly grated nutmeg. To a person, everyone said this was the best thing on either the Christmas Eve or Christmas menu. Completely wonderful and flexible recipe.

I loved this recipe. The only thing I changed was to add a bit of parmesan cheese on both layers and it turned out great. Amazing dish.

This is a very easy receipe if you have a mandolin, which we do! From the recommendations I used 1 1/2 fennel bulbs, and also added some crumbly sliton to each layer. It was a hit!

Excellent! Halved the recipe, made almost even layers of potato and fennel.

This recipe was absolutely delicious. I loved the subtle flavors of the rosemary and garlic. I changed a few things by sauteeing the fennel with thinly sliced onions and then sprinkled a thin layer of gruyere cheese in the middle and top of the potatoes. I even cooked it ahead and then reheated it for our dinner party. Was a nice complement with the beef tenderloin we served.

Fantastic. Gotta have this again in two weeks. I combined ideas from the Ham, Artichoke, and Potato Gratin recipie. Use sauted leeks in the middle layer. Use a roux thicked sauce of stock, cream, and wine with lots of white pepper. Pick a high quality ham and add strips with the leeks. Awesome!

I rarely rave about a recipe but this one is a wonderful improvement on the standard au gratin or scalloped potatoes. The richness of the potatoes and cream are cut with the subtly sweet fennel. The texture is more delicate than the typical potato and cream dish. I grated some Nodine's smoked gruyere on top to accompany a Nodine's smoked ham from our local farm. My favorite comment from a svelte guest: " with all the fennel this is really a low calorie scalloped potato"...as she took a third helping!

I made this exactly as written and thought it was exceptional. Didn't skimp on the fennel and made sure everything was sliced thin on the mandolin. This is going to be a holiday staple in our house from now on. If you wanted to eat it 3 days later with a poached egg on top, well I certainly wouldn't stop you. Yum.

I thought this was just pretty good, but not great. I think next time I'll do something more interesting with the fennel - I found it got lost in this dish.

My husband and I made this today for his family's Easter dinner. It got rave reviews! Our 7 year old daughter loved it so much she had seconds. We did only use 1 fennel bulb as suggested by other reviewers and also added cheddar cheese for some zing! Definately will be making this again!!

I followed suggestion of using only 1 bulb of fennel and I dipped the sliced potatoes directly into the milk mixture, so I eliminated one step. Also I sliced by hand and left the skins on. Easy recipe. I served it with grilled steak and it was just right. If I were to serve with chicken,pork or fish I would add cheese. Will make again.

Like all scalloped potatoes this is a time consuming recipe. I made it last night and it received rave reviews. Per another reviews suggestion, we only used 1 fennel bulb...I was nervous about the fennel as I am not familiar with it, but it is a very mild and slightly sweet flavor that compliments the dish very well. We also added about half of the chopped fronds to the cream sauce and it dispersed a nice color throughout.

This dish is wonderful! I diced the fennel rather than slice and did 3 layers of potatoes. Added a little sharp cheddar and blue cheese into each layer, also, with some on top. Highly recomended!

Wonderful dish! Even those in our party who rather eat rice than potatoes loved this dish. Although fennel smells a little like licorice before it's cooked, it doesn't once it's cooked in this dish, but rather it puts in a sweetness that balances out the cream very, very nicely. The only modification that I will do next time is to use no more than 3 pounds of potatoes and to use only one large fennel bulb. I couldn't get it all in the glass dish that they recommended using.

I found the richness of the recipe delicious. In my slight variation I cooked down three leeks in a pan with butter and put them in halfway threw the layering.

Opps, my review below was NOT for this recipe. It was for http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Scalloped-Fennel-and-Potatoes-14550

This recipe is absolutely fantastic! Granted, it's a heart attack in a dish; it's worth it. It would be perfect for Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner. Don't bother with the dividing and organizing of it all. Just alternate layers, cook, enjoy then walk 50 miles to offset the calories. It's really worth it!

I have made this dish for years and it is always loved! Sometimes, I use 2%milk instead of cream and I sprinkle crumbled Stilton between the layers and on top for a little more kick. The blue cheese is a nice compliment to the fennel and helps the dish stand up to a full bodied red wine.

This is a fabulous recipe as is. This is a staple for all holidays ... as it is too rich for me for a week night dinner.

Made this for dinner last night accompanied by braised asparagus in olive oil and balsamic vinegar and baked ham (actually fake ham as we are vegetarians) and it was delicious. The recipe required no tweaking and we will definitely make this a mainstay in our household.

Made this for a foodie crowd and got rave reviews and many requests for the recipe. I don't usually follow recipes precisely, but did this time. No changes needed at all.

This was a great recipe. I was short on time, so I cooked all the ingredients in a large oven safe pan, then put it under the broiler for a few minutes to brown. It reduced the cooking time by quite a bit, and I recommend that alteration for those in a pinch. I also added a dash of pepper to liven it up a bit.

Very Delicious! I made for our Dinner Club and rave reviews from all; someone even thought there was cheese in the recipe. I usually have to add extra salt to just about everything I make and this recipe does not need it. Very flavorful.I purchased a mandolin and it was well worth it. I wouldn't make one change to this recipe.

This was only okay for me. Easy to make. Used a food processor for slicing. Could have used a little more zing for flavor.

I made this for thanksgiving and it is the first time I made a recipe with cream without substitutions. I did cut the recipe in half but it was sooo good. Everyone loved it and it was fairly simple to make. With the cream and butter it is definately a holiday recipe but it is good.

I shared Thanksgiving with a group of foodies and my contribution was the grilled turkey and this recipe. It was very simple to make (although I only used about 2 of the 3 pounds of potatoes) and didn't bother with the mandolin and used a knife to thinly cut the fennel and potato. It was a huge success. Even with the one diner who swore it was sacrilege to not have cheese in scalloped potatoes.

Rating: 3
This was a huge hit on Thanksgiving. The fennel melts into the potato, so it's barely noticeable to fennel haters, but adds a nice subtle flavor. Even my 5-year-old liked this. It's very rich, but still simple. My only complaint is that it's almost too simple to be memorable.

Delicious, even non-fennel fans loved it and took left-overs. I used black pepper, still great. Easy to make, even without a medalion. I will make again!
