THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST HONEY CAKE I'VE HAD IN MY LIFE AND I DIDN'T START OUT AS A FAN OF THIS TRATITIONAL CAKE.BUT FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS IT'S A MUST MAKE. IT'S SO TOTALLY MOIST AND FRAGRANT WITH IT'S SPICES,AND HONEY,AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT I NOW HAVE REQUESTS FOR IT. THIS CAKE GETS EVEN BETTER DAY BY DAY. JUST WRAP IT WELL WITH PLASTIC WRAP AND FOIL AND THEN PUT IN A HUGE FREEZER BAG TO KEEP IT REALLY AIRTIGHT (AND I PUT IT IN THE REFRIDGERATOR)(AFTER MAKING IT YOU DON'T WANT TO LET IT DRY OUT) TAKE IT OUT MAYBE 30 MINUTES BEFORE DESERT TIME,AND YOUR ALL SET.I PUT EVERYTHING IN AND MIX IT UP WITH MY ELECTRIC MIXER AND I PUT IN RAISENS,WHICH SOME HOW ALWAYS SINK TO THE BOTTOM,WHICH IN MY CASE IS THE TOP SINCE I USE A BUNDT PAN-.(BIG TIP-SPRAY BAKING PAN WELL WITH PAM OR ANOTHER BRAND AND IT COMES RIGHT OUT. THANKYOU MARCY! BYE NOW,JOAN

This cake was absolutely delicious. I made very slight modifications based on what I had on-hand. I cut the white sugar from 1 1/2 cups down to 1 cup as I don't like things oversweet. I also used canola oil instead of vegetable oil. The reason I'm rating 3 forks instead of 4 is that it stuck like crazy to my bundt pan (which was well-oiled) and there was FAR too much batter for one 10" bundt. It overflowed pretty significantly. I'll definitely make this again but will probably stick with a smooth-sided cake pan like the angel food and be more aware of how much I fill the pan as to not overfill. Our hosts for RH dinner said it was the best honey cake they'd ever tasted.

Loved this recipe. I don't love honey cake, but always feel compelled to make it for Rosh Hashanah. This cake was delicious. I followed the recipe and baked it for one hour exactly in an angel food cake pan. It was so moist and wonderfully spiced. My family loved it. I will definitely be adding this to our menu every year.

After 50 years of baking honey cakes this is the best one. It is moist and it did not sink in the middle . I made two . They both came out perfect Bravo

This was truly moist and lighter than most other honey cakes. The only change I made was to use 1 cup of sugar instead of 1 1/2. I used 1 Tbsp of instant espresso in 8 ounces of hot water and Wild Turkey for the whiskey since this is what I had available. I used a 9 x 13 pan and the cooking time was right on. I wouldn't leave out the whiskey as this gave it a nice subtle flavor kick. My mother-in-law took 1/2 the cake to bring to someone's home for the second night of Rosh Hashana.

Great success! I followed the recipe, but put in a little less sugar, and less honey (cause I ran out)and no whiskey. I made the chocolate/coconut milk glaze found on the newer honey cake recipe 2011. I must have added a little more flour. because my batter was not watery, the cake did not overflow my bundt pan and it came out easily in one piece. I have a very heavy duty Nordicware bundt pan. I also make little bees out of marzipan with almond slice wings.

This cake might be delicious if I followed the directions. Made it in a 9-in springform, and it took forever to cook (more than 90 mins) and it is still gooey in the center. Can't bring it to the dinner we're going to... Maybe next time I'll use the right cake pan.

I made this cake for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur and it was amazing  I got so many great reviews. it will be a must in our holiday dinners from now. I did add some pecans and made an extra strong coffee. I also used the whisky and it made a huge difference for the best! Next time Ill double it and bake some in small loaf pans and give as gifts. This recipe is a keeper.

I loved this recipe for it's complexity of flavours but simplicity of preparation. Doesn't get much better than measure, stir and bake. However, mine didn't bake in the right amount of time. I used a 9" Angel Food tin as suggested and baked it according to directions for 65 minutes "until springs back when touched". It did not overflow the pan. It looked brown and gorgeous and caramelised on the edges, it smelled divine. I cooled it in the tin 15 minutes, and then tried to turn it out, and uh-oh! Liquid started running from the centre !!! oh dear! Back in the oven again, another 20 minutes, another 20 minutes cooled in tin... Turned it out again. Seemed to be solid... Went to bed and cut it in the morning, and sure enough, it was still not baked through. So I cut off the undercooked parts and enjoyed the baked parts. My lunch guests thought it was very tasty. This cake is indeed tasty, but I really can't rave about it like the other reviewers. Maybe that is because I'm not Jewish and don't know what a New Year's Cake is supposed to taste like. To me it just tastes like a very moist gingerbread.

I have never been complimented so much before in my life! This cake is a winner! You will be the talk of the party! I used chamomile tea (I steeped two bags for a few hours). I didn't have vegetable oil and used olive. I baked the cake Thursday night for a Saturday night party in order to let the flavors blend (I wrapped it very well). It came out excellent and very moist! The cake does rise a bit so I split it into two pans which was excellent so I could keep one for me and take one to the party!

I made this for my son's first birthday cake as he was born on Rosh Hashanah. I made it 2 days prior to his party and it kept beautifully. I added a powder sugar honey glaze for the top to make it shine. The flavor was amazing and I had so many compliments. It was very easy to pull together and make.

Wonderful recipe. I used a springform pan lined with wax paper on the bottom and foil on the outside. This made removing it from the pan much easier.

Based on the reactions of my dinner guests, this recipe's a keeper. This cake is moist, delicious, with beautifully balanced flavors. Even better served two and three days after baking. The one down side is that it makes much too much batter for a 9x13 inch pan, contrary to what the instructions say. It overflowed the baking pan - good thing I followed the instructions and set the baking pan on a foil-wrapped baking sheet. I would have had a major disaster on my hands otherwise. I see that other bakers had similar problems. My advice? Don't fill your baking pan more than half-way unless you want to risk a baking mishap. However, despite this one issue, this is a cake I'll definitely make again. Delicious, and one your guests will enjoy and remember.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious. I agree with other reviewers that it can be a challenge to get out of a bundt pan. The only changes I've made are successfully using scotch instead of whiskey for the alcohol - both editions got rave reviews, but the scotch was not as deep a flavor as the whiskey... added the ginger as another reviewer suggested and used a darker honey. I love that I can make it ahead, 2-3 days is just the right amount of time to let the flavors develop. I haven't used the slivered almonds but am seriously considering adding either a small amount of almond extract or a shot of amaretto to next year's cake... this recipe's a keeper!

Rating: 4
I can't say enough about this cake. It is beyond delicious and was a huge hit at our dinner party. I added extra OJ and coffee to sub for the alcohol, and I did add an exta 1/4 cup or so of flour at the end (too soupy to pour into the pan). And it was just perfect. Reminiscent of gingerbread. We served it with sweetened vanilla whipped cream. Absolutely a go-to recipe.

Made this Monday to serve on Wednesday for Rosh Hashanah and it was a huge hit among all guests--even the 3 and 5 year old grandchildren. Upon serving, the cake was moist, somewhat dense, and delicious. I omitted the almonds because I didn't have any at the time and cut the sugar by 1/2 cup. The cake was sufficiently, but not overwhelmingly, sweet. As suggested in the recipe, I baked the cake in an angel food cake pan (65 minutes), which I liberally sprayed with Pam rather than lining the pan with greased parchment. As directed, the cake was baked on two, stacked cookie sheets. Other than to catch batter leaks, I was not clear as to why this was specified; perhaps the cookie sheets assist in conducting heat. After initial cooling, the cake was easy to remove from the pan and retained a perfect shape. This recipe is a "keeper" and will be my choice for holidays to come.

Rating: 3
The taste is very good, but my cake stuck to the bundt pan. I omitted the almonds but I made the recipe as written and used a bundt pan instead of the angel food pan. It was too gooey on the pan bottom, so the top of my cake ripped off. Maybe would have been okay if cooked longer, but I baked for 70 min and it seemed done, if not overcooked, from the parts I could see and touch. Would not recommend using bundt pan, even though the author says that you can. It's too risky.

This cake is incredibly quick and simple to make, as well as delicious. HOWEVER. It rises quite a lot in the oven. I tried making mini cakes, and this was disastrous. Don't fill your pans any more than halfway.

Excellent results; a keeper.Reduced OJ to 1/4 cup. Scant 1 1/2 cup sugar. Added rind of one small Rangpur lime (a sour mandarin). Spice change: 3 t.cinnamon, 1 t. ginger, 1/2 t. cloves, 1/2 t. allspice, 1/3 t. mace. Used Makers Mark for whisky. Toasted slivered almonds and dusted with flour before adding to batter (this will contribute to there suspension within the batter). Used angelfood pan, lined with parchment, sprayed with Pam.

I made a vegan version of this cake for a New Year's party, and it was a huge hit! For the eggs, I substituted 3/4 cups of blended silken tofu, and instead of honey, I used agave nectar. Delish!

Thought others might be interested to know that this cake can be made without any eggs! I *thought* that I was being so careful but I completely forgot to put eggs in the batter. To my surprise it looked and tasted wonderful and no one noticed the missing eggs. All the other ingredients and amounts were the same, the only difference is that I omitted the eggs.

Thanks lmpiquette. It was definitely not undercooked. Maybe the middle sank because the pan was too small. Anyway, we are still eating it and it is still moist and delicious. My husband says it is the best honey cake he has ever had (and I am an eperienced baker) so I will just have to try it again in a bigger pan.

I made this cake this weekend and it was moist and delicious but it seemed like too great a quantity of liquids (oil, eggs, honey, coffee, oj, whiskey, etc.) to the amount of flour. I obviously used too small a pan as it overflowed on the ends. I was more concerned that the center sunk dramatically and the batter was so loose that the almonds I had added mostly sunk right to the bottom. Does anyone have any suggestions? Thanks.

I had honey cake once before at my grandmother's house once as a child and it came with a yellow wrapper in a loaf form and tasted like sawdust. After reading this recipe and looking for something traditional for Rosh HaShanah, I thought I'd give it a try. OMG!!! My whole house smelled delicious. RH was on a Sat night. I made it Wed let it cool completely, wrapped it in clear wrap and again in foil and froze it. I took it out Fri to defrost (kept it wrapped). It was moist, dense, rich and wonderful! I made it in a tube pan, sprayed with PAM, subbed the booze with coffee, and served it with a light dusting of powdered sugar and a cinnamon-laced whipped cream. It was the hit of the night, even though I had also made tiramisu and layered cookies. My BF, hearing I was making honey cake, warned me that I shouldn't be insulted if no one ate it, as honey cake is usually awful. Needless to say, she took the leftovers home! This will be a new RH tradition for us-it's that good!

Rating: 4
Total deliciousness - with a few notes... I used the whisky, really good black tea and huckleberry honey which gave it a nice depth. I used half the brown sugar (had a little less on-hand than I had thought), but added maybe 2 tablespoons of molasses to compensate. Next time (and there will definitely be a next time) I will add a touch of ginger as well. I was also confused about the thickness of the batter - the molasses and an extra 1/4 cup of flour I added were intended to thicken it up, and that's the consistency I would go for again rather than the thinner one I discovered at the end of the instructions after the cake was already on its way into the oven. A guaranteed crowd-pleaser and easily a new go-to holiday recipe.

A wonderful recipe! My Hungarian grandmother used to send boxes of baked goods to us (from California to eastern Tennessee!) for Jewish holidays. There were always many rolls of strudel, huge sour cream cookies and honey cake. This was very much like what she sent. And it got better and better each day. I sent one to my 94 year old Dad for Rosh Hashanah. Before he tasted it it, he asked, "Does it have black coffee in it?" When I said yes, he said, "Then it's good!" Will make this over and over, no changes.

Made this honey cake for Rosh Hashanah this year. I was pleased that my high expectations based on the reviews were met. I made the cake two days before serving. It got better over the two days. The few pieces I have left from five days ago are still extremely moist. Amazing! This was my son's favorite dessert, even over a chocolate torte! The only changes I made to the ingredients were that I used orange juice to replace the whisky. I also used strong coffee instead of tea. I toasted the slivered almonds in the oven prior to adding them to the batter. I used a well greased and parchment-lined 10" tube pan.

Rating: 4
Best honey cake ever! Used coffee and left out the rye, but otherwise made it exactly as in the recipe. If making it in a tube pan make sure it is thoroughly baked around the inner tube before removing from the oven (I needed extra time.) As to the reviewer who wants to know if leftovers should be kept at room temp or in the fridge...couldn't say. There's never any leftover.

Rating: 4
As others have said, this is the quintessential honey cake recipe. The days of tinder-dry honey cakes is over! I cut down the white sugar to 1 cup and that was sweet enough. I subbed about one cup of White Whole Wheat flour for equal white flour, just to improve the nutrition, slightly. Also, omitted the optional booze. I baked the cake in two loaf pans (one extra long) and the batter just fit. Multiple requests for the recipe!

Rating: 3
To those who prefer the look of a bundt cake to that of an angel food cake, my cake removed easily from a sprayed and floured nonstick bundt pan. I also reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup. The cake had the perfect amount of sweetness for me with that reduction.

Rating: 3
This is a very good, extrememly moist honey cake. Excellent on all counts. As a previous reviewer noted, this is not the traditional, darker and stronger flavored honey cake - perhaps a buckwheat honey or some wheat flour would give it that taste. I also decreased the regular sugar to one cup. I used the 9" angel food cake pan but had to remove approximately 1/2 cup batter before baking because I feared it would overflow. I am glad I did because the cake did rise to the very top. And I felt, with this size pan, that it needed 70 minutes in the oven. Nevertheless, this will be my "go-to" recipe for a holiday honey cake!

Made this honey cake for Rosh Hashanah today, exactly according to the recipe with one adjustment. My husband and guests LOVED IT, but as is my complaint with all jewish cooking, its just really counterintuitive. Makes a REALLY dense cake that felt more like a banana bread than a cake though my husband said it was OUTSTANDING! The notes "spoon in the batter"? More like pour it in, seeing how thin the batter was I added an additional 1/4 cup flour (wondering if the author sifts hers which would account for the difference) Still was very thin and I was glad I placed the tube pan (angel food cake pan) on cookie sheets. As for removal, I used Wilton Cake Release and although it came out pretty well I can account for all the problems readers are having. This is more of a liquid than a batter, and a very high sugar content, that being the case the edges tend to caramelise, so no matter what there is some small adhesion. You will find that even running the knife down the side will disturb some tiny part of the shell and lead to an imperfection. I had only a small bit of this near the bottom. I compensated by roasting some sliced almonds then I microwaved about a 1/4 cup of honey, added the almonds and made a nice wreath pattern around the bottom edges and at the top. The result was a beautiful cake and no visible imperfections. I do make a traditional honey cake that to me, is absolutely gorgeous but as my husband liked this one, and he is the one having grown up with honey cake on Rosh Hashanah--I am happy. Honestly everyone loved it, just rather low on the recipe science for me.

Cake is fantastic. Since I found this recipe years ago I haven't used any other. When I make this I line up all the ingredients on my countertop and as I use them I put them away.

Although I am not a fan of honey cake, this cake really is exceptional. Moist and very flavorful. I used an aluminum tube pan with a removable bottom and prepared the pan as instructed; there was no problem with sticking. I used a little less sugar than called for (maybe 1/4-1/2 cup less total) but I do that with most baking recipes. My search for a good honey cake recipe has ended, too.

This was easy to make and as wonderful as everyone says. My 85 year old grandfather adored it and said it tasted like what his mother made. Only after putting it in the oven did I realize I left out the coffee. It was fantastic, so I'm curious to see what it will taste like next time with the coffee in.

really quite phenomenal! Made some changes: instead of 1 c. oil I used 1/2 c sour cream and 1/2 cup oil. I added a grated apple as others have suggested. I forgot the vanilla (oops!) For the honey I did half buckwheat, half clover. I had no OJ so I used more alcohol (rum instead of whiskey) and some lemon juice. I also made a caramel rum sauce and poured it over the top. This was decadent, moist, rich and GONE very quickly.

Based on someone's feedback that the cake is too sweet, I omitted the brown sugar, increased the honey to 1 1/2 cups, and decreased the sugar to 1 cup - still too sweet for me. Next time will keep 1 cup each sugar & honey only. Also found it a little too moist...but liked the complexity of the different flavours - coffee, o.j., spices, etc.

The best Honey Cake ever! I've made it many times since I've purchased Marcy Goldman's book. The "secret" is to use the "right" pan. I used two Anolon non- stick 9x5 loaf pans, because there is enough batter just for two pans. Greased them with a bit of oil and baked for about 50 min.I've tried this recipe in diffrent pans, the cake got stuck to the bottom. Non stick is the way to go.

There is only one good way to bake this cake and get it out of the pan. Use a tube pan where the bottom removes. I sprayed the empty tube pan and then put parchment on the bottom, with a hole cut out for the middle sticking-up part, and sprayed that too. When it was baked, I ran a knife around the outside and inside and pulled the pan apart. Magnificent. I will NEVER make another honey cake in a Bundt pan. It always sticks. This cake was fabulous, but very very sweet. I may try to cut some of the granulated sugar next time. Much better than the recipe I've been using for the past 20 years. I'm only going to buy pans that pull apart from now on.

Made this cake for my choir rehearsal last night, and everyone raved about it! I looked up the recipe on Marcy Goldman's website, www.betterbaking.com, because this version did not mention when to add the optional almonds. I took Ms. Goldman's version (4 eggs instead of 3; 4 tsp baking powder instead of 1 T, etc). FANTABULOUS! The almonds all pooled in the center so I would add after the surface is more baked, but the taste is incredible!

This cake was a winner!I made it for our holiday, and everyone raved how moist and delicious it was. I followed recipe exactly, and made it in a bundt pan w/ greased parchment.

Brooke from Chicago: My sister told me about this cake recipe but warned me that I needed to make sure that the Coca Cola was FLAT! She made the cake once and forgot to let the soda get flat and wound up with the same situation that you had. A messy oven and batter all over the place! The recipe does not state to make sure the soda is flat. But, apparently it makes a difference. Hope that helps.

I used this recipe this afternoon and it was wonderful. I have historically had difficulty removing cakes from my bundt pan. So, I have tried everything! What has worked for me recently is to spray the pan with Pam and then flour it well. I made sure that the center was covered as well. And, when the cake was cool I ran a knife around the center post of the pan. It came right out of the pan and it is lovely. I just wonder whether people use darker honey in their cakes. The cake is delicious but is not dark like a normal honey cake. It is more like a great spice cake. Not a criticism but I wonder if it is even better with different honey.

I gave this 4 forks because as far as tradtional honey cakes go, I thought this was exceptionally good. The cake was moist and very flavorful and loved the kick of the whiskey flavor. Used wildflower honey, coffee and substituted ground ginger for 1/4 tsp of the cloves. Served it with a little whipped cream. Baked it in a 10 inch tube pan, let it cool for the 15 minutes in the pan and then ran a knife around the edges. The cake came out of the pan OK. I have horrible luck getting cakes out of bundt pans so decided not to use one.

I was extremely disappointed with this recipe. The flavors all "seemed" to blend together well, but the entire contents spilled out over my angel food pan over the baking sheet and onto the bottom of my oven. How did this recipe work for anyone!!! Now I'm stuck cleaning my stove so I can use it for the dozen other things I'll need to cook. Not a happy new year!!

Hmm, Happybaker, it does not appear that we did anything very different in making the cake - I used English Breakfast Tea, which I would not expect to have made a difference in its ability to unmold. My bundt pan was a pretty simple swirl pattern, not one of those intricate designs. While I only let it rest for 10 minutes, when I examined the cake to pan interface, the cake was pretty well locked on to the pan. A soaking in hot water and a little dishwashing liquid lifted it in about 15 minutes, but I could see by the way I could not get my fingernail underneath the residue that it was fixed there. The texture of this cake reminds me a great deal of applesauce cakes and the like in its moistness. This is the first honey cake that I have made, and so I don't know whether this observation is valid. This tasted like a moist spice cake....from the name of it, I had hoped for it to taste vaguely like honey. Not a criticism, since all honey cake recipes seem fairly heavy on the spices.

Rating: 4
This is a definite improvement over traditional New Year honey cakes, both for its flavor and moisture level. I didn't have any problem unmolding it from my bundt pan...simply sprayed it with Pam for baking, baked for 80 minutes and let it rest 15 minutes before unmolding. I mixed in 3/4 c chopped pecans and skipped the almonds. I omitted the cloves, increased the cinnamon a little and did use the whiskey. I also chose earl grey instead of coffee. I think all of these changes helped to make this one of the most successful honey cake recipes I have tried in years.

Rating: 2
The cake is flavorful, BUT, as another reviewer noted, it would NOT leave my Kaiser bundt pan in one piece, despite the fact that (1) I cooled it for the requisite 10 minutes before umolding, (2) the pan is non-stick and (3) was also heavily greased. Since my Angel Food Cake pans all measure 10" and this recipe specifies a 9", I went for the bundt. The pan is still soaking. Tho the cake is moist, I would specify that it be made in only a smooth pan like an Angel Food (tube) pan. One glitch in the directions - first, the author says that the batter is thick and should be "spooned" into the pan(s). Then later on, she says the batter is runny. Mine was definitely a thin batter. It would be helpful if the author's description of the batter's texture were consistent. Maybe that's what I get for baking a Jewish cake in a German pan. Oy vey, such a shande.
