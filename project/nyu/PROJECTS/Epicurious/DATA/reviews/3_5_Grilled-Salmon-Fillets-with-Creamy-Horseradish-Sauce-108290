For two people, I made 1/4 the sauce recipe and still had a TBS leftover; anyway, it was "pretty okay" (1.5 forks). I marinated the salmon for about an hour in the fridge, then cooked it on the stove in a covered cast iron grill pan; it was "very good" (2.5 forks).

We tried to fillet our own fish and ended up with a bunch of pieces that we couldn't put on the grill so we baked the fish in the marinade... ended up too strong. But if I were to do this again I'd follow the instructions more closely because the flavours were right, just didn't work in our case.

The sauce makes this recipe. Excellent as is. The quantity of the sauce is certainly greater than what is needed for the salmon. However, this sauce would be good on so many things. It will go in the frig and probably not last long.

Just as represented..easy and very delicous. I made it as it was printed since I don't change a recipe around until I've made it once. Wait, I did leave the salmon in the marinade for almost two hours because I was talking to my guests. I would probably do that again.

Salmon isn't usually my favorite, but we try to eat it for obvious health reasons. So when I can find a recipe that really doctors it up, I'm happy. The sauce is delicious, but I cut it in half and still had a ton. We used the leftover sauce a few days later with kobe burgers on english muffins. (my husband's idea and REALLY good.) I'm making the salmon again this weekend with the recipe on this site for peas with spinach and shallots.

We liked this recipe a lot. I didn't have horseradish, and so I left it out and it was great nonetheless. My husband said it had more of a "steak" taste and texture to it than fish. We will make this again...but we'll make half a recipe for the sauce.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe. I admit, I totally improvised and "guesstimated" the quantities. I chose to marinate the salmon steaks in the soy/horseradish mixture for about 30 minutes; I'm convinced this helped to impart a little extra flavor and gave the salmon a gorgeous carmelized glaze while grilling. I also opted to leave the basil out of the horseradish sauce, but instead just sprinkled a little bit on top of the sauced salmon just before serving. IMO, this gave the presentation a nice fresh quality (similar to the shown image.) Make sure you use good salmon. If you live in the St. Louis area, I highly recommend Bob's Seafood! Highly recommended - quick, simple, delicious!

Enjoyed the marinade and sauce, and my diks did too. I found the quantity of sauce about 3-4 times what was needed however. Next time I will cut the quantities of ingredients in half. Maybe even one third.

My family and I loved this recipe. The only thing I would tweek is the sauce. I would only add a 1/2 cup sour cream, a tbsp or 2 mayo and up the lemon juice to a half a lemon. I found it too sweet with as much mayo. I served this with shredded potato pancakes with mushroom and onion. Was delish!

After years of marinating anything I think needs to be grilled, I have discovered an amazing thing. You don't need to do it. A squeeze or two of lemon, salt and freshly ground pepper is all you need. The sauce is what takes the food to the next step. This is exactly what happened with this recipe. I had salmon filets. I had arugula. We were hungry but enjoying a wonderful Saturday night. So....lemon on the filets with salt and pepper. No sour cream...substituted creme fraiche and plain Stonyfield whole milk yogurt because although I love mayonnaise, homemade or Hellmanns I don't want to use it in a sauce on this... Fresh basil, more lemon..a bit of soy sauce..... Salmon comes off the grill, put on a bed of arugula..topped with the sauce and a bit of fresh ground pepper. What an amazing Saturday night...we'll share this with friends next time...

Rating: 4
I have made this several times and have had good results (never tried the sauce). Yesterdays meal was outstanding and all I did was the marinate the salmon in the AM before work. My 12 year old eats this up without the usual tarter sauce. My filets are always thick so 4 min per side does not do it and I use a fish basket for easy turning. Add some grilled vegies and you have a wonderful low carb meal. Next time I might try cedar planking and marinating overnight.

I've made this a few times - very good recipe. I've given it to coworkers & they loved it. I however don't make the sauce & put the lemon & basil on the salmon. I also mix Panko in the horseradish mix & top it with fresh shredded parmesan or Asiago cheese. Very yummy & fairly healthy meal!

Forgot to mention...the touch of basil really is nice in the sauce...I might add just a little more next time....really complements the other flavors.

Probably next to the last time of using grill this season and tried this one. Used more horseradish as others suggested, used light mayo and sour cream (had thought about low fat Greek yogurt and may try that as someone else did). Used Atlantic salmon, wasn't quite inch thick so did 3 minutes each side...marinade kept it from sticking to cast iron grill...came out absolutely perfect.

Rating: 3
This is a very, very good recipe, and I would rate it 3.5 forks if I only could. Be sure to use wild-caught sockeye salmon and marinate it in the oil-garlic mop prior to putting it on the grill. We also did the salmon on a cedar plank, but it took at least 20 to 25 minutes at 350 degrees on my gas grill. Make sure to use fresh horseradish in the sauce, and don't be afraid to double it. You could also double the amount of garlic in the mop, which is outstanding. Bottom line: We really enjoyed this recipe. But there is NO WAY it supplants Pan-Seared Tuna With Ginger-Shittake Cream Sauce as the greatest fish recipe on this site. I just can't agree with the husband of an earlier reviewer on that matter. This recipe is good. Very good. But it's not THAT good.

I made this last night for some hard-core foodie friends and we all loved it. I substituted fat-free Greek yogurt for the sour cream, and that worked really well because it added an extra tartness. I used prepared white horseradish from Trader Joes and added an extra teaspoon. Delicious!

Wonderful way to make fresh salmon. As many others noted, the Copper River Sockeye Salmon is the best, whether using this recipe or not. I added extra basil and horseradish to the sauce. Also, I marinated the salmon in the mop sauce for about 2 hours. It was fantastic!

For many years there was a wonderful restaurant in Point Arena, CA called Panegea. One of their best dishes was salmon with horseradish sauce. I approximated it at home with horseradish and mayo. But this sauce was even better. I read elsewhere that salmon and basil have the same affinity as salmon and horseradish and it's true. I used almost all of my fresh basil in the salad accompanying the salmon, and with the full amount or even more, the sauce would be even better. I cooked the salmon in a fish basket at my husband's suggestion, but next time I'll omit the basket. It was more trouble than it was worth. Mine didn't come out at brown as the photo, but since the pieces were no more than 1 inch thick, they were perfect in the time recommended. I didn't see the comments about marinading until later but I would definitely double the mop sauce and marinading it is a great idea. With it I served the Barefoot Contessa's Panzanella Salad (tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, and basil) from her Parties book. Some garlic bread. An absoslutely perfect summer meal. We bought Costco's fresh Alaskan Copper River salmon from their fish cart. I'm not sure about using farmed salmon (which we try to avoid if possible). In a pinch I think you could use the frozen salmon patties from Costco also. That means you could have this on short notice and regardless of your access to fresh salmon. In summary: the best recipe for grilled salmon yet!

Rating: 4
Made this as written last night with some gorgeous fresh Copper River Salmon fillets. Divine! Wouldn't change a thing. We cedar planked them on our grill (350 for 15 minutes) and they came out so amazingly tender. My husband says this is now his favorite fish recipe(dethroning the pan seared tuna with ginger shiitake cream sauce recipe also from this site). Honestly the fish was so good by itself, we didn't think it even needed the horseradish sauce. But I'm glad we made it, because now we're looking forward to using it on hot roast beef or french dip sandwiches.

This is my second time to "rate" this recipe. It really is a wonderful way to prepare salmon and so easy.

I'm doing it again tonight.

This is a quick and easy dish to prepare if you want something nice for dinner but are in a hurry. I didn't use the bbq, just the grill indoors, and it was superb. We loved the sauce as well - we used some of the extra bits to stir into our mash. Delicious!

This was good, I would recommend using really good salmon, and I ended up with much more sauce than I needed. It's potential is phenomenal, sauce really compliments the salmon.

Count me among the cooks who thinks this recipe is delicious! It is not a recipe that enhances the flavor of salmon, though; it masks it. (I was glad I had bought coho and not the milder king salmon.) It is, therefore, a perfect dish to serve guests who are not enthusiastic salmon fans (or whose tastes you are not sure about). When cooking only for myself, I will use the horseradish marinade but not the sauce; I love horseradish, but I also love salmon. I used reduced-fat sour cream and mayonnaise, but the sauce was still creamy, rich, and delicious. I used plain horseradish in the marinade and both plain and cream-style in the sauce. I don't eat beef any more, but if I did, I would definitely make this sauce for beef too.

Unlike the majority of reviewers, this really didn't work well for me. I agree with the few who felt the sauce (quite tasty) would go better with roast beef.

This was good, but not great. I followed the recipe exactly, except for two things. I didn't marinate the salmon, and I broiled rather than grilling since our grill has yet to be replaced from our last move. And while the flavors in the sauce were good, I still found it to be a bit on the bland side. I'd kick up the soy sauce and the basil, and perhaps even the lemon juice. Just a couple of tablespoons of horseradish in all that mayo and sour cream just wasn't enough to impress me. That said, my husband loved it and I will make it again.

This has become a staple in our household. We grill at least 4 days a week, and salmon is almost always a part of the menu.

I have never used horseradish in a recipe before and bought horseradish sauce instead of plain old horseradish (duh!).

After so many different views I had to try this. It is OK not the best due to the horseradish sauce more of a pairing with beef or pork. It didn't rock my world or my husbands but I will make the sauce again for beef/pork and will use the marinade for salmon again. My slight changes after other reviews were using dill (seemed natural pairing rather than basil for salmon) and used creme fraiche. Had to add more hradish to sauce and a bit more lemon & soy since it was too mayonaise-y. I wouldn't serve this dish to guests unless trying first.

Easy and delicious! I'd give it 3.5, since I reserve 4 for OUTRAGEOUSLY SUPERB! I subbed dill and thought just about any herb would do fine. Up the horseradish if you like it racey.

This a definite addition to my culinary reportoire! I, too, did it on a Foreman grill and substituted tarragon since I have an abundance of it showing up in the garden. The flavor was excellent.

Excellent recipe! One of the better grilled salmon recipes I've had in a while. Many times when grilling salmo, it comes out a little dry. This was perfect & moist. The sauce is great as well!

Rating: 4
This was an excellent and super simple dish. I baked the salmon because it's still winter in Chicago. I used dill instead of basil and it was great. When I baked the salmon i put a sprig of dill on each fillet. I used light sour cream and light mayo for the sauce and didn't miss a thing

Rating: 4
I made this recipe with two small exceptions. The first is I cooked the fish in a George Foreman. The second is once fish was finished I sprayed lemon on it. I do not care for Dill so I made it with the fresh basil. The basil is a wonderful compliment. My husband agreed, the basil helped make the sauce.

Rating: 3
Very tasty and easy. I used 1/4 cup each mayo, plain yogurt and reduced fat sour cream for the sauce and substituted dill for the basil per others' recommendations. I added one Tablespoon of fresh lemon juice to the salmon marinade and marinated for one hour prior to baking (could not use my grill in the snow). Before baking at 425, I dried the salmon, spayed lightly with olive oil and rubbed it with a mix of chili powder, brown sugar, red and black pepper seasoning. I also finished the salmon by broiling it to crisp the top. Excellent!

With some minor changes, I thought this was awesome. I substituted the basil with 1 Tbs. of dried dill. I poured the grilling sauce on top of the fish and broiled it for 10 minutes. Very moist and flavorful.

I made this last night, my husband and I loved it. I used the marinade ingredients in the sauce and skipped the marinade and baked the salmon at 375 for 20 minutes. It was perfect. Will definitely use this sauce for many for types of fish and meat.

Good recipe. The combination of salmon, horseradish and cream is very traditional but the basil flavor just didn't work for me. I kept wanting to taste fresh dill. I will try that next time.

Rating: 3
Very good, and easy. I broiled the salmon, and added more horseradish to the sauce as others had advised (good call), but otherwise stuck to the recipe as written. Lots of flavor for not much work.

Rating: 3
Like other reviewers, I made the sauce alone as to accompiany a plain grilled salmon with a side of grilled potato, carrot and peppers. We thought it was delicious! Easy, quick and a lovely fresh flavor. Because we are horseradish fans, I added more to the sauce and loved the result. My only "negative" (if you can call it that!) is that it was an extremely rich sauce, almost too rich for our veggies and salmon. I look forward to making this again with a roast of beef.

Rating: 3
I must confess to making some changes to the recipe, something I usually try to avoid if I'm going to give a review. However, exceptionally, I simply baked the salmon plain and put all of the horseradish in the sauce (about 4T but add even more if you're a horseraidhs lover) and used dill instead of basil (dill is a natural partner of salmon and horseradish). Very satisfying served with buttermilk mashed potatoes and green beans in a grainy mustard/shallot sauce.

Rating: 3
I marinated the salmon for 8 hours instead of just brushing the marinade on before grilling. Also increased the amount of horseradish in the sauce to 3 Tbsp and accidentally used 2 tsp of soy sauce instead of 1. Quite tasty. I would definitely make this again for my family, though I'm not sure it's at the level at which I would serve it to company.

Rating: 3
After reading the reviews, I doubled the amount of horseradish in the sauces. I marinaded the fish for about an hour in the sauce before broiling -- about 5 minutes on each side. My boyfriend really liked it but I thought the horseradish was too much for the fish. Next time, I'll double the horseradish for the sauce but not the marinade or not marinade the fish prior to broiling.

Rating: 3
A really good recipe. I broiled the salmon instead of grilling, but think grilling might have been better. the horseradish sauce was extremely tasty.

Rating: 2
The salmon didn't retain the marinade well enough for me. I thought there might have been more of a horseradish flavor, as well. It was a good meal, but didn't meet my expectations on flavor. For grilled salmon, I tend to make a sauce of 1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream, chives, lemon juice and pepper, and I think I have a simpler palate when it comes to fish.

This was very good and received well by my guests. I was hoping for more of a horseradish flavo but it wan't there. It was good though, small hints of the radish. I would have prefered more, I think I might add more to it next time.

You have to like horseradish (and or wasabi) to really enjoy this dish. If you do -- you'll love it. If you're not sure how guests will feel about horseradish then stick with the recipe. Nice flavor, a good kick without being overwelming. Everyone at my dinner party raved.

Rating: 4
The horseradish cream sauce was beyond compare! We've had this sauce with tuna and swordfish as well. It is an elegant sauce that requires no last minute preparation so is perfect with a "meaty" fish for a dinner party. We just prepare it a couple of hours ahead and let stand at room temperature to meld flavors. The red pepper saffron pilaf is a perfect side dish along with a grilled vegetable. We outdoor grill all our fish (or I should say my husband does), and his fish always comes out perfectly done and moist.

Tried this with Dolphin. Dipped in flour, eggwash, and Japanese bread crumbs. Pan seared and then brushed with rosemary glaze, finished off in the oven. Served with sauce. AMAZING!!!!

This is my recipe of choice for potlucks. I pick up the salmon from Costco (usually a 3 lb slab) and bake it. The flavors really mesh well. A little sauce goes a long way which is great because we use the extra on roast beef sandwiches. I recommend using a gourmet prepared horseradish that isn't full of fillers - you find this in the refrig section as opposed to next to the mustard on the shelf. People love this and gush about it all night!

Rating: 4
I agree with some other reviewers that the horseradish sauce may be unnecessary, but the marinade/rub adds just the right combination of flavors to the salmon. Having tried this dish using varying qualities of salmon, I can attest that, as in most things, the better the ingredients, the better the result! This is a simple, perfect preparation.

Rating: 1
A big disappointment. The horseradish sauce is too rich for the fish,almost cloying, and doesn't complement it. The marinade/rub is great, however, and worth using alone.

It was so simple and the reward was beyond expectation. One friend said it was the best salmon he had ever tasted and another friend said she could eat the sauce with a spoon, it was that good! I think that I will try this sauce over a prime rib and if it works as well as I think, serve for the holidays.

I have never had horseradish before, and at the market I was faced with three kinds. I bought the "prepared 100% horseradish" over the 'sauce' kinds. It was very strong! The fish was absolutely delicious with the marinade, but next time I will add less horseradish to the sauce. We used a salmon fillet with skin (does it come any other way?), and the skin fell off during grilling - perfect! Served it with roasted red potatoes and broccoli. YUM!

Rating: 3
Don't be tempted to add any extra Basil as it will overpower the horseradish. Very tasty otherwise.

Rating: 2
I had to debate between 2 and 3 forks. I think this is very good, but not great. We absolutely love salmon, and my husband and I love anything with horseradish. The sauce is good - had to add much more prepared horseradish, and might try adding fresh next time. The marinade is tasty. We actually used arctic char - much milder than salmon, but it still held up to the sauce. Served it with roasted asparagus and roasted tiny red potatos, which also were good with the sauce.

Salmon was fresh and broiled 5-6 minutes on each side rather than grilled. Comments were it was cooked to perfection! The sauce caused diners to rave all around the table! Served with the Saffron Rice & Red Pepper Pilaf and Zucchini with Garlic & Crushed Red Pepper from August issue. Went well with a red Zin!

I read this recipe and new my husband would love it. I was right - I made 4 fillets, ate one, and he ate the rest! I substituted 1/4 cup plain yogurt for 1/4 cup of the sour cream, and I didn't have any basil. I did the fillets under the broiler since Hurricane Isabel was lashing us! This was quick, easy, and flavorful.

I've made this several times using a grill pan. I've used fat free yogert, but sour cream makes it a 4 fork recipe. It is especially good when I get the outside of the salmon a little crisp and the inside still moist.

Great recipe! I see why it is popular. We used coho salmon. It is very unusual for us to do this, but we substituted reduced fat sour cream and mayo for the real things, since we're counting calories for a while. It was still very, very good. The salmon picked up a good grill flavor and the sauce was very complimentary. With it we had potatoes, grilled green tomatoes, and watermelon, green onion, and mint salad (from this same issue of Bon Appetit). Surprisingly, Jacob's Creek Reserve Cabernet matched up well.

This was a really good and easy way to serve salmon. I was worried about the sauce being cold and the fish hot, however once the sauce was put on top of the salmon the sauce warmed up and it was great!

I made this a couple times before I got it just right. In the sauce I replaced the basil with mint and it was much, much better. In the marinade for the fish I added some Penzey's black and red pepper, increased the horseradish slightly and brushed the marinade onto a two pound trout fillet. It needed to broil close to 10 minutes, but developed a beautiful color and was a big hit. This is a great dish for entertaining because you can do so much ahead of time.

My husband loved this recipe, especially the sauce, which makes it. Normally he's not a salmon fan, but this was an exception. I thought it was very good as well.

I have a favorite grilled salmon recipe that I've used for 10 years but thought it was time to try something new. This turned out great. I made a few changes: I don't like mayo so I used all sour cream in the sauce, also I had some minced fresh flat leaf parsley, basil and oregano so I used all for the sauce instead of just basil; I did marinate the fish in the oil mixture for a few hours and I used olive oil because I don't really like vegetable oil. Salmon turned out moist and while I have a good bit of sauce leftover, I'll use it for a dip for raw vegetables. Very nice sauce.

I really liked the marinade, but next time I will let the salmon sit in it a while before grilling rather than just brushing it on. The horseradish sauce was really good, but it just didn't seem to work with the marinade to me. Both by themselves are great (my husband used leftover sauce for a steak salad dressing, was great.)
