maybe it was the brandy, but this tasted exactly like Dimetap cough syrup to me and all the other 9 people eating it. I suggest first, making something else, or barring that, tasting it as you go before adding brandy.

While I like the compote, I felt it was missing a bit of something. So, I finely chopped candied ginger and sprinkled that over the orange/ice cream combo. That did the trick.

I made this for a dinner, it was sooo simple but sweet and elegant. Buy good quality vanilla ice cream to accompany.
