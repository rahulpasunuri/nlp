Is a bit messy to make. You could get the same effect with much less bother by adding fresh mint to commercial cranberry juice. The recipe didn't mention whether to strain out the mint leaves but the mint leaves are too messy to leave in.

I made this for a Christmas tea and the ladies RAVED about it. I thought everyone was just being polite, but they are having me make it again for our 2nd annual tea.

I was looking for a mint tea recipe (I had never made fresh tea and my spearmint plants were looking too good not to take a stab at it). I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. My kids weren't crazy about it, but my husband and I loved it.

Be careful it can make a mess. Remember to strain out mint leaves otherwise you have to sip through them. Strong mint flavour. Pour over ice to dilute.
