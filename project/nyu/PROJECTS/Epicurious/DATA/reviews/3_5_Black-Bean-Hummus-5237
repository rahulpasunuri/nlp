Yuck! I made this recipe exactly as stated and it had the consistency of hard clay. I ended up adding water and more lemon juice, but it still tastes pretty bad. I wish I had read the reviews saying to use significantlly less tahini. That may have helped. As published, this recipe is pretty bad.

Cayenne pepper completely took over. Tried to add more beans, tahinni, etc, ended up with a mix with barely any flavor except for cayyene pepper. Will not use again, may use mix to thicken a soup because as hummus is not working out at all.

This recipe is easy, tasty and keeps well in the fridge. I dial up the garlic for adult appetites and cut back on it and the green onion for kids. It's flexible (add more beans, add less whatever) and it still turns out fine. I don't even measure the tahini (though too much makes it overpower the flavor). It's not appetizing to look at, but if you can always top it with chopped green onions to distract from the grey. Once people try it, it'll be hard to get them to stop eating it.

Just made this for a Superbowl party and it was a hit. I added about a half cup of roasted red peppers, which really gave it a nice consistency. The cayenne has quite a kick, so if you don't like spicy, then cut that back a bit. I thought the presentation needed a little something, so I diced up a green onion, some cilantro and some roasted red pepper and mixed it with a touch of olive oil, salt & pepper then spread it over the top of the dish. Definitely a winner!

I would give this recipe 4 stars if changed to 1/4 cup tahini and lime juice instead of lemon. So yummy and a nice change from the traditional garbanzo bean hummus.

This hummus is excellent. I made some minor changes - less Tahini (1/2 cup), more Cumin and Cayenne (doubled), added one can of chickpees, more garlic, some crushed red pepper and did not use the cilantro (because I didn't have any). I added the green onions after the food processor (chopped and mixed in).

I was really pleased with this hummus. I, too, used only a quarter cup of sesame seed paste as too much overpowers whatever it's in and imparts a bitter taste. I also substituted lime juice for lemon juice as suggested by another reviewer. Every other ingredient was the same. And, yes, it's gray in color. I just threw some scallions on top. All in all, a very good hummus.

Delicious!! I was looking for a different dip for a Cinco de Mayo party and this was a big hit. I did not have tahini, but after reading several other hummus recipes w/o tahini, I used 3/4 cup steamed pureed cauliflower. Additionally, I subbed the lime juice for lemon and left out the green onions from the blender, chopped them and used them for garnish with a dollip sour cream!

Rating: 4
I did as others suggested and used only 1/4C tahini which was just right and substituted lime instead of lemon juice. I left out cayenne pepper and added 6-8 slices of jalapeno pepper and pureed as directed, adding a dash of salt and giving it a great kick! DELICIOUS with tortilla chips or fresh veggies.

As many others have written, this is a really good hummus variation. A perfect combination of flavors. Will make it again!

Rating: 3
This is very good, especially after it chills overnight and releases the flavors. I used 1/2 cup of tahini plus a tablespoon of sesame oil, but realized that it needed more of the green onion, garlic, cumin and cayenne in order for it to not have the sesame be so overwhelming and bland. I'll try 1/3 cup tahini next time. I also added small sweet roasted bell peppers and their juice.

Rating: 4
Wow. This is amazing! I love black beans and love hummus, and this is the perfect combination. After reading the reviews I made the following minor changes: 1/3 cup tahini, subbed lime juice for lemon, halved the cayenne, doubled the cumin and cilantro, and added ~1 teaspoon kosher salt to the mix while still in the food processor. This is great with onion pita wedges, but I'd leave out the salt entirely if serving with tortilla chips or scoops. Some avocado and tomato garnish, and this is defnitely one that goes into the party dip rotation. Also good as a simple weeknight supper,..........which it is, tonight.

I just made this in a blender (don't have a food processor) and was missing several key ingredients (tahini & fresh cilantro) but it still came out super yummy! I threw in some sesame seeds and a shallot and ate it with tortilla chips. Highly recommend it.

I have been making this since '98 & everyone loves it! It's really good with sour cream and melted cheddar cheese.

Tasty, fresh, and different. I drained the oil off the tahini to cut the fat and it didn't seem to affect the taste. The color was not a turn off as others have indicated. Looks like bean dip to me only tastes much better. I did add more of the cumin and cayenne as others suggested. I only used 1/4 c of the tahini but think it could not have hurt to have more. Would keep this on hand for company.

I agree about the color...I used half a preserved lemon instead of salt and lemon juice, and half the amount of tahini. I agree this recipe has too much of it - Good change of pace from the normal hummus we're all used to.

I am trying to get my mom vegetarian, so I made this. I did not add garlic, I made the tahini myself by vitamixing sesame seeds. I have a photo here http://farm2.static.fli ckr.com/1203/1485000571 _ba6c398589.jpg

Overall this was a yummy twist on hummus, but I agree with the one reviewer who said it was too tahini-heavy. I also used 1 can black beans and 1 can chick peas, but found it too sesame pastey so I added another can's worth of green peas. They added more green color and a nice freshness. I also found it needed almost double the cumin and cayenne.

This was easy and quick, especially if you like cilantro. It's a nice variation to regular hummus. The color was a little weird as other reviewers have noted, but didn't bother me at all!

Wow...I've been making this for years and thought it was my own creation. I use one can of blacks and one of garanzos. NO Tahini, but 2 T of peanut butter and aout 2 T or toasted sesame Oil--I have that on hand all the time. Process everything but the cilantro till smooth, then put in the cilantro last so it leaves the green leaves peeking thru. I garsnish w/ a bit of fresh chopped tomato and onion in a swirl on top--seems to distract from the pinkish grey color- I've never had anyone refuse to try it on the grounds of lack of eyeball-appeal...maybe my friends know I would never foist somthing yucky off on them. Great as a spread on turkey and whole wheat too. Often eat it with marinated chicken chunked and Pinenuts as a light summer supper. FYI, Black beans have a bit more protein than Garbanzos, which is why I tried it.

Even if this tasted good to me, I couldn't get past the color. It is a dismal shade of gray and it looks disgusting. It is the consistency of wallpaper paste and to me that is what it tastes like. I hated this. GROSS.

Rating: 4
This is a wonderfully flavorful recipe. I took the idea of spreading the hummus onto a whole wheat tortilla shell one step further and added shedded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, shredded cheese and salsa or hot sauce on top of the beans before rolling it. This makes a great lunch or light supper.

Rating: 3
I'm not a big hummus fan, but I served this along side the regular hummus. It went! I liked it alot - there was a nice South-of-the Border flavor to it, and it was quite spicy. If you don't over-process it, it comes out looking quite pretty with some flecks of the cilantro and green onion in it, along with the black from the skins on the beans. It's especially good on celery sticks as they add a nice cool crunch to the smooth and spicy hummus.

The first time I made this recipe, no one ate it...I just knew it was its unappealing color. But because I thought it tasted so great, I made it again for my next function, and again no one ate it. I knew if they just tried it, they would get past the unappetizing color....so the next time I made it (get the idea that I'm tenacious?), I spread the mixture onto a whole wheat tortilla round, and rolled it up, there was not one left! And now I'm asked for these roll ups all the time....they should only know! The only change to the recipe I make, is to reserve about a half a cup of beans, then add them and half a chopped red pepper and half a chopped green pepper to the final smooth spread to give it some "tooth", it also looks good in the spriral slices.

Rating: 4
This has been an all time favorite of mine since it appeared in 1998. The only thin I do different is to not drain the beans. It is less of a hummus dip and more like the frito lay bean dip. I serve it with large scoop fritos and the kids love it. Good on toasted bagels too. Add more cayenne to make it hotter.

Treble the olive oil and cut the tahini to 1/4 c and you're somewhere near a good recipe. As written, you've got sesame seed paste on your hands.

This was terrific. I made this based on reviews here, and my guests loved it. Those who did not like hummus found something to like with the black beans, and those who loved hummus praised it for its slightly different take on a familiar favorite. It does look sort of grayish and unappealing, but that didn't seem to matter much.

Yum, yum, yum. I'm not one to follow a recipe exactly, so "as is" I can't rate it. But I played with the proportions and ingredients a bit - used lime juice instead of lemon, peanut butter instead of tahini, more cilantro - and found this dip DELICIOUS. Just keep mixing and adding until it tastes the way you want it to. Served this at two different parties and both sets of guests loved it.

Rating: 4
This was absolutely wonderful. Of all the hors d'oeurvres I had out at a party, this was the first to go. Don't avoid this recipe if you don't have a food processor; I made it by mashing everything together with a fork (include a little extra olive oil). If you do it this way, prepare at least several hours in advance to let the flavors blend. It's much better the next day. I served it with the sesame pita chips from Trader Joe's and they were the perfect complement. I'll definitely make this again.

Wow! Fabulous recipe. As mentioned, some extra lemon juice and some extra garlic really adds to it. I added some chili powder instead of cayenne and it really added some body to it. LOVE it..

This recipe is excellent and versatile. It went over well with vegetables and pita bread. I did leave the cayenne out because I didn't know my guests' preference for spicy food and it came out beautifully (tasting, not looking!).

This recipe was a hit! One guest declared it "addictive". As I was adding the salt to taste, I found it to be a bit too thick to stir so I added about 4 tbs extra of the olive oil to thin it a bit. When I make it for my wedding I'll pre-spread it on the pita wedges and garnish with diced tomatoes. Use about 60 wedges per batch. (I ran out.)

I have been looking for a delicious black bean hummus recipe ever since they closed Lost Planet in Columbus and this is it!!! I only made one substitution which was to add a fresh chili to the puree. We like it hot and garlicy. Four of us ate the whole thing last night with corn chips, MMMMM! I will make this often.

Rating: 4
I love this stuff! I substitue the tahini with peanut butter (yes, peanut butter) and leave out the green onion and two spices. I've found that the combination of cilantro, garlic, lemon and peanut butter create an addictive taste. Other cooks are right - it ain't pretty, but it's REALLY good - a great twist on the traditional hummus.

This is a tasty dish, a different take on traiditional hummus--It's thinner and has a unique flavor. I didn't have tahini, so I used 1/3 C. of hoison sauce. I think it works well. Easy to make and good to have on hand for a snack or guests.

This is a great alternative to standard garbanzo-bean hummus! It has a southwestern flavor and a nice texture. I went a little overboard on the cilantro, which turned out to be a good thing.

This was very good but I think the trick is to use black beans from scratch. It requires planning ahead but there's something very tasteless about canned beans. I used 15 oz. of dried black beans which yields slightly more than required. This dip got rave reviews from my guests.

Made for the second time this past weekend, and it was great, especially w/ the extra garlic I threw in. Because of its appearance people often shy away from trying it, but I don't mind because my roommates & I get to enjoy all the leftovers!

I echo the "less tahini" cry. Downright ugly, but quite good... I made it as one of four flavors of hummus as an appetizer for a Middle Eastern-themed dinner party... it was popular.

Rating: 3
I would recommend using 2/3 c. of tahini to start with and add as you see fit. 3/4 c. seemed to dominate the other flavors. I would also recommend adding about 1/4 c. of water to make it a more hummus-like consistency. Otherwise, I thought it was very easy and tasty.

I tried Gena's recommendation of one can of black beans and one can of garbanzos. Fabulous! I keep this in my fridge all the time now. It is a nice cool summer dish. It also makes a terrific veggie dip or sandwich filling. A trip to the store for fresh cilantro is worth the effort. It tastes even better!

After reading the other reviews, I made some minor alterations to the recipe - I think it improved it a great deal... First, I added 1 15-oz. can garbanzo beans and 1 15-oz. can of black beans. Secondly, to reduce the bitterness, I reduced the amount of tahini from 3/4 cup to 1/4 cup, and increased the lemon juice slightly. Turned out great!

Rating: 2
I also agree that garbanzo hummus is better. This needs more garlic and lemon juice and if you can get around the colour - kind of a dryer lint pink/grey its not too bad for a change of pace.

It did have a bitter flavor, I think due to the lemon juice. I added a little sugar and that took away a lot of the bitterness. I also added some jarred banana peppers for a little kickand whipped it up. It was great! Had it at a pool party.
