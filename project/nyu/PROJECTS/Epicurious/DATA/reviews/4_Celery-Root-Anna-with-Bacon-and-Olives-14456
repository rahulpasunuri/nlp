This was my first try with celery root, which tastes much better than it looks! I used Canadian bacon instead of standard bacon, and olive oil instead of butter. The result was a hit with our family. One recommendation: the recipe says that it should feed "4 to 6". This was just enough for three of us. I would use a bigger pan and double the recipe for 5 or 6 people. A fourth layer would be a good idea too.

This recipe is delicious! I'd never tried celery root before, and I will definitely make this again. My only change was to melt a little extra butter to brush on top of the celery root slices. It's very hearty - perfect for a cold winter's night.

Fantastic - I baked this in a gratin dish rather than a cast iron skillet with excellent results.

Unbelievable! I made this to go with a baked ham and it was outstanding. My husband doesn't like vegetables and ate three pieces (in other words half the dish). Definitely will make this again!

You can dress it up but you can't take it anywhere. The leftovers gave my dogs terrible gas.

Wonderful! I'd never tried celeriac, and wasn't much impressed with the taste of it raw, but this was extremely tasty. I sliced the root by hand, and it came out fine.

If you like celery root you'll love this dish! It makes an excellent replacement for a potato gratin, and can be made ahead of time and just heated up before serving. It goes especially good with lamb.
