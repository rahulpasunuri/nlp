Re: The recipe for hazelnut butter can be found within the recipe for Gianduia Mousse Cake (which is just fabulous).

This cookies require a bit of work but they are well worth it. I have been making them for my husband for the last 5 years. They are a treat that he looks forward to every Valentines day. If you can't find the hazelnut butter I have used almond butter which is good to.
