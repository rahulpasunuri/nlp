This dessert has been a great hit in our family. When rolling the crust, it becomes sticky as it warms and I end up pressing it into the pan. But overall, it is an amazing dessert and I have served it at many events, including an annual Valentine's banquet at our church. Lovely taste, presentation and a smashing success!

I've made this recipe twice now, and while it is rich, decadent and tastes amazing I think there is something wrong with the caramel recipe. Both times I've made it, it doesn't set and is way too watery and doesn't turn into a deep amber no matter how long I cook it. Next time I'll swap it for a standard caramel w/ just sugar, butter, cream and vanilla- no water..so it doesn't become a caramel river!

I think of myself as an experienced cook who can follow a recipe but this one was beyond me. The crust tasted fine but "melted" down the sides during cooking, even though it was well chilled. I used a spoon to push it against the sides of the tart pan and to pull it up again, which is not a pretty look. I also tried making the crust with additional flour and cream, as suggested by another reviewer of this recipe, but that was just as unsuccessful. Also, the caramel never browned though I tried it two times, so it tasted like melted sugar. After tasting the finished tart, I could not serve it to company.

I used semisweet chocolate and added the heath bar crunchies on top, definately a must! The crust was very easy to make and manipulate into the pan. The chocolate/carmel layers are so rich and chewy, taste like something out of the center of a top quality truffle or something. Makes a great casual desert to serve w/ coffee. Serve small pieces, it's rich. I couldn't find a removable bottom tart pan so I used a 9" springform pan and just kept the crust sides short, like 2" or less up the sides. Worked beautifully.

Used semisweet and drizzled crushed heathbar on top. Absolutely fantastic!!

Bittersweet was way too rich, even for my one guest who loves dark chocolate. Next time I would try semi-sweet or even milk chocolate.

Made this for Christmas dinner dessert. The caramel was very easy to make and I added about 1 cup chopped, toasted pecans to the caramel and it was yummy. An easy and yummy recipe.

Very good desert. I will be adding pecans next time to add to the flavor. I wish they showed a picture as I wasn't sure how to design the top.

Made it, it came out great, and it went over very well with a date who claimed that caramel was her favorite. The crust is a simple 1-2-3 tart/cookie dough, I don't think it's important to have the butter chilled. Room temperature would be better for a tender crust. You have to cook the syrup until it turns amber. Timing it is not very useful. Until it turns color, all of the water isn't evaporated out of the caramel yet and so the sugar is raw. If you have a thermometer, look for about 300 degrees. A really great-looking dessert, in my opinion!

Wow. I added about 1/2 cup ground pecans to the crust recipe, no problems with it. Definitely use bittersweet chocolate. Very rich and delicious.

This was quite good. I listened to the reviews and added an extra 1/2 cup flour to the crust recipe plus about 5 T of cream. I think it's important to make sure you only pulse the flour/butter mixture for short spurts in the food processor to avoid heating the blades too much and then melting the butter. As long as the dough was really cold, it was easy to work with. Instead of one big tart, I made 5 small ones so I was working with the dough a lot. The dough of the first tarts was much more easy to handle because it was chilled. My only issue came with the caramel. It didn't turn an amber brown even though I cooked it for over ten minutes. I feared it would get too hard when it cooled so I just added the rest of the ingredients but the color of the end product looked more like cheese then caramel. The taste, however, did not suffer. I will definitely attempt this one again and try to fix the caramel dilemma.

This is an absolutely fabulous dessert. Everyone who trys it asks for the recipe. The only difficulty I had was with the crust. It is a little too soft and so difficult to roll out. Also, be sure to follow the directions to double up on the sides - it defintitely shrinks!

I thought this recipe was great. I haven't made it in while and now I remember that the crust was a little tricky, but worth it. The sides really shrink up so next time a may add the extra ingredients as someone suggested. I wish they had a picture of this with the recipe, I think it would be great to see how they piped in the chocolate. I will make this again. I'm addind some comments after I have made this again. I added an additional 1/2 cup flour and 3 T cream to the crust and it turned out great. Also I used semi-sweet chocolate this time and it was very sweet. I would only use bittersweet next time to counter balance the sweetness of the caramel. As for putting dots of chocolate then using a toothpick to make a design, my chocolate was to thick and therefore my dots were pretty ugly to me.

This was one of three special desserts concluding a formal holiday dinner I had. It was by far the hit, though my friends are real chocoholics and this was the only chocolate one! Yes, the crust shrank, but it was precisely the right size to hold the filling. I didn't have any problems with it, as I too chilled and rolled it between layers of parchment (didn't have plastic). I made the swirls and dots using my trusty plastic bottles, but you could pipe them or use a ziplock. The picture (I have the mag) is of small swirls and dots. Any pattern would do! I don't usually repeat recipes, but this was so popular I think it will be repeated each year.

I´ve been making this for Christmas for.. 3? years now and for special occasions in-between. It IS very rich and it CAN be tricky... but if you like chocolate, dont mind rich once and a while, and work carefully, I think it is WONDERFUL! And despite what some others say I have never needed any special kitchen stuff to make it ... I detest food processors and I often find myself in kitchens far more primitive than my own, so part of my recipe ratings include the ability for something to be made without a 5 star kitchen :) (Also a side note... sometimes this is better a day after... served too soon it sometimes tastes more like sugar than what it is supposed to - at least that was my experience when I was in Germany!)

This is a fantastic recipe. I have made this countless times since initially trying it in 1997. I don't agree with the comments regarding the crust though. If it is chilled properly and rolled out between plastic wrap,it's a breeze. When decorating with chocolate, I just pipe dots on the tart then run a toothpick through them to make swirls. Definitely a keeper!

This is a fabulous dessert! People never fail to ask for this recipe when they sample it. I have one suggestion for making this a true "Turtle Tart". Use the crust recipe for "Almond Crust" from the June 97 issue of Bon Appetit, substitute pecans for the almonds, and leave out the almond extract. Sublime!

This tart is for SERIOUS dessert and chocolate lovers only - it is incredibly, almost unbearably rich, I thought. I couldn't get the chocolate drizzling part to look right but maybe I don't have the right equipment thingie.

I have made this several times, and was not happy with the crust initially, either. I now add an extra half cup of flour, and 3-4 Tbsp of cream when combining the pastry ingredients. I add enough cream so that large clumps of dough form, then press the pastry right into the tart pan, and chill before blind baking. The extra 1/2 cup of flour makes a generous amount of pastry, pressing the dough into the pan is much easier than rolling it, and the sides don't shrink when blind baking (perhaps because there is no stretching while rolling?). It's a delicious shortbread cookie-type crust.

I have made this dessert a number of times and it is always a big hit. The only problem is in making the crust. Rolling it between plastic causes the dough to stick to the plastic as it warms. I always end up just pressing it all into the pan, which is not even. I may try another crust the next time I make it. The filling is absolutely amazing, though and I would highly recommend it.

When I first saw this recipe I thought it sounded delicious. I just made it yesterday and it was very good. The only thing I was disappointed in was the crust. Sometimes crusts can be hard to do. I think any short dough crust will do in this case. But the filling is to die for. I will try this recipe again with the crust in the recipe and one of my own.
