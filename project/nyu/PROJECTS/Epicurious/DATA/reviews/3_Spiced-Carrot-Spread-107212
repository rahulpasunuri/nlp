This is a favorite as a snack with pita or crackers and as a sandwich spread with feta and greens. Spicy and interesting. I add a little extra cayenne for kick. For what it's worth, note that using prepared mustard will give a very different flavor than toasting mustard seed. I recommend the seed.

This is really good and has a little kick from the combination of spices. The carrots took a lot longer to cook than suggested. I only added an additional 1 tablespoon of oil to make the consistency a little smoother.

Yum! I substituted the olive oil by dark sesame oil, added some grainy mustard instead of the mustard seeds (didn't have any on hand), spiced it up with a little bit wasabi (run out of cayenne pepper) ... It's got something of an Asia touch! I like it and will make it again.

I really like this recipe and am going to make it for the third time in the last few years tonight. I think it is simple but elegant, and an unusual mix of flavours.

I thought the flavors were wonderful and it was naturally, pleasantly sweet. A nice addition to a Mediterranean mezze course. I served mine on whole wheat pita alongside hummus, feta cheese, olive tapenade, sliced tomatoes, barley salad (similar to tabouli), and warm fava beans with olive oil and lemon. I will most definitely make this again.

Very few people at our party ate this. The ones who did said it was just OK. I halved the recipe to begin with and still had to throw away most of it. This would be better as an addition to a sandwich rather than a stand alone spread. I'm taking this one out of my recipe file.

Weird. The flavor is good and I like the spices. I really don't think the spice is very strong. The texture is not as thick as I thought it would be. As another reviewer said it really does taste a little like peanut butter. In any case I entertain often and it will be nice to have an appetizer that is not fat laden.

The flavor grew on me as I kept eating it; it's strong, and might overwhelm those with more conventional tastes. Oddly, it reminded me of peanut butter (but of course much classier). I think it tastes better at room temperature or warm, and it needs to be served on a crunchy cracker or toast that can stand up to the heft and flavor. I'm going to try it as a vegetarian sandwich spread next (it wouldn't pair well with meats).

This is perfectly spiced, slightly exotic, and definitely elegant. The toasted spices pair really well with the sweet and salty carrot base, and the flavor is mild enough to serve to anybody without being the slightest bit boring. It's a lovely bright orange color, too. I really would have given it at least a 3&1/2 forks if we didn't have to stick to whole utensils! I'll be serving it with sesame crackers and crisp toasted pita wedges, but I agree with the previous cook who said it would be great with veggie sticks as well (and that it could easily be varied to be a sweet spread with cinnamon). It would be lovely next to Indian dishes. I reduced the oil to 1 Tbsp and used extra virgin, adding 1/2 Tbsp to the pot and the other 1/2 Tbsp to the puree. I also ended up adding extra water to the pan as the carrots were cooking, and a little extra water to the puree--probably a little more than the missing 3 Tbsp of oil. Oh, and I only used 1/2 tsp salt and the spread is more than salty enough. I'd happily make it again the same way in the future!

Delicious, and Easy! TOASTING THE SEEDS certainly is key to bringing out a complex, aromatic flavor. Substituted powdered mustard since didn't have seeds on hand. -Served warm with toasted pita triangles brushed with olive oil, but I know it will be just as good with fat-free saltines, or even crudites cut for dipping. I like it as much for the nutrition, and think it would do fine without olive oil if you wanted it fat free and don't mind a slightly less-smoothe texture. I'm looking forward to trying it chilled to see if it's as good. If not, I'll microwave a bit. Should also be good amended with summer herbs, or maybe adding other vegetables. -Good base for a soup with addition of broth or (fat-free) "half and half". Or for a sweeter touch, I may add a bit of honey or brown sugar, cinnamon & nutmeg, and serve with toasted cinn/ sugar pita wedges.

To cook from PA..I would serve this similar to hummus with toasted pita bread or bagel chips. It sounds very interesting and a nice change of pace to the standard chips and dips.

I have not made this, but was wondering how it would be served? On bread, as an appetizer? Just curious.
