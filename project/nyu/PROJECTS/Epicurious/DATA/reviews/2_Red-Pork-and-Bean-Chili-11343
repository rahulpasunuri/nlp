I thought this dish was more like pork stew than pork chili, but that might be because my grocery store only sold pork roast, not the more tender/fat pork shoulder or butt (and my husband generally refuses to eat fattier cuts of meat). But that being said, it was very good. A topping of grated cheddar and some corn bread on the side made a hearty meal. It tastes good as leftovers, too!

I've made this dish, and similar. One variation is to omit the tomatoes, and add 1/4 of white vinegar to create tenderness and melt-in-your-mouth texture. Serve beans on side, and wrap in flour tortillas.
