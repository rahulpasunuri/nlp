AMAZING!!! This was easy, spicy and a nice presentation. My husband loved it. I added extra chipotle peppers and boy was it hot. A great game day or cocktail party food for the guys. I added a dill pickle chip on each and used baby arugula.

Amazing - we all liked it: two adults, a teen and a child. Yum! Easy to make too.

I made the recipe essentially as written, and it was *way* too spicy for my kids. My husband and I liked it, but it was even a little on the spicy side for us (and we both generally like spicy food). Then I looked back and realized that most of the previous reviewers had already taken out the chipotles! I will try it again, with much reduced chipotle

Not the most exciting recipe, but my 4 year-old gobbled these up, so it's a keeper! I swapped out the sprouts for wild arugula and the chipotles for a can of mild green chiles to make it more kid-friendly.

Made as written it did not have enough flavor for me. I added a lot more BQ sauce and chipotle. It was better the next day. I toasted the buns on a grill pan brushed with butter, that added a lot to me. Also, the addition of dill pickle. I agree with niania, it is a good base recipe. Probably will make it again with these additions.

Great base recipe! Though I made a bunch of mods to make it weeknight, in a hurry, friendly. I used rotisserie chicken (only the breasts), shredded. I forgot to pick up chipotle in adobo... sub'd chipotle tobasco (about 1/2 tsp), 1/4 tsp oregano, 1/4 tsp cumin and 1/2 tsp salt. I added the chicken to the sauteed peppers, onion and garlic (which I sauteed with cooking spray vs. oil) and then added my "improvised" chipotle flavor. I added a couple of splashes of chicken stock, covered and let it simmer about 5 mins to cook off the liquid and heat through. I then put the buns, chicken mixture and fat free cheddar cheese under the broiler for a couple of minutes....served with a quick cole slaw... on top of the sandwich instead of the sprouts, tomato, etc... dinner done! My family devoured it!!

I thought this recipe was fabulous. I left out the green pepper but otherwise followed the sauce recipe (using boneless skinless chicken breasts). The chicken and sauce was just spicy enough. I topped the sandwiches with some homemade cole slaw. In fact I am having company on the sailboat this weekend and I am making this for a nice easy dinner.

This was just OK for us. We were expecting more somehow. the cheese wasn't necessary, though it was pretty.

Wow, this was a huge hit at our house! We had some leftover canned chilis from last year's garden, so we used those instead of the adobo sauce, and I used the idea of just putting coleslaw on top instead of the tomatoes and sprouts. Fantastic! We're already discussing either doubling it next time (and freezing half) and/or turning this into a slow cooker meal. Any way you slice it, this was fantastic!

Loved this recipe, my family enjoyed including my picky 11 year old. I made it with minimal chipotle peppers and it came out great. Definately yummy!

Soooo good. Like other reviewers, I used a couple of boneless skinless chicken breasts, which worked just fine. I also served these on larger sandwich-sized buns and used coleslaw instead of the tomatoes and sprouts. The coleslaw nicely complemented the heat of the chicken filling. Overall, these were delicious and I'll make them again soon.

I made this for a very hungry group so I used 4 boneless chicken breasts and doubled all but the chipotle peppers and it was extremely spicy. It was delicious but the peppers were a bit overwhelming. I will definitely make this again but I will take the advice of one reviewer by using only a small amount of the adobo sauce and a couple peppers instead of the whole can.

Made this for dinner and the combination of flavors was a big hit. Stick to two peppers if you don't want too much heat - three with a couple of tablespoons of adobo sauce was on the spicy side, but still great.

This recipe is quite delicious and easy to make. I used a boneless chicken breast (about 7 oz) instead of bone-in chicken and it worked well. I also skipped the chipotle peppers and instead sprinkled crushed red pepper on the chicken when it was finished. I'll likely make these sandwiches again next week.
