It's okay. If I were to make it again I would use less soy sauce and more lemon juice + marmalade. I didn't find the flavor too intense, but this may depend on the marmalade you use.

I followed another reviewer's tip & used lemon marmalade plus I added some cayenne, black pepper & minced garlic to turn the heat up a bit. Easy, moist and full of flavor.

Smells great, but glaze a bit strong for my tastes, would be better paired with a blander side dish. Chicken nice and moist though.

I used reduced sugar marmalade to cut a few calories, delicious!

This is a favorite with family and friends and a staple at our house.

Very Disappointing. Chicken was surprisingly dry and though I marinaded it overnight, it was pretty tasteless.

This is so rich and delicious, and healthy to boot. I had lemon marmalade on hand so I substituted that, with boneless skinless breasts, and broiled instead of baking. Adding the reduced glaze at the last minute really makes this special. This could be a company dish. Kabobs would be yummy too.

This is great used in a Chinese Chicken Salad. I used skinless/boneless breasts, pounded the meat to 1/4 inch thickness, marinated for 24 hours, then grilled it over the BBQ. Everyone loved it.

My Mother-In-Law has been doing this for decades :~)

Very tender and with a nice sweet taste! I added a few more tbs. of marmalade than the recipe called for and some pressed garlic. I baked at 350 then raised the temp to 400 for the last 10 min or so.

This makes a very nice addition to a picnic basket. These days, chicken has absolutely NO flavour unless you marinate it or cook it in a stew. This was very tasty. I prepared the marinade and left it 24 hours in the fridge and baked it during the evening news. Very easy.
