I'm also a bit mystified by this "recipe." I wish it at least included directions for/links to the celery seed & honey-cream dressings it mentions.

Um, get some fruit, cut it up, put it on a tray, serve some dip... Great food... don't get me wrong, but I wouldn't exactly call it a recipe.

What am I missing here? This doesn't look like a "recipe" at all to me.
