Made this for Christmas dinner tonight because there were only three of us. It was just what I hoped for, and I will definitely make it again. Super easy, and tasted great. I used Stayman apples and cooked the syrup down so it wasn't runny at all. I cut the puff pastry with a scalloped edge, so it looked pretty.! My husband thought it tasted like French toast

This is my go-to for a quick dessert that looks and tastes great. I use rum in place of the water. Sometimes I oversize the pastry and drape it over the ramakins then invert the whole thing onto a plate and serve as a pastry bowl filled with the apple and sauce

Very good. I substituted 1 tbs cream for the 2 tbs water, and still found it a little runny. I misread the recipe and sliced the apple instead of halving it, but it worked out fine.

Was delicious. Did exactly as per recipe except I added cream instead of water. As some of the other reviewers noted, the sauce was a bit runny. Think I will reduce the quantity of butter to 1 tablespoon the next time. Less liquidy and less fat that way (I hope!).

This is a brilliant interpretation of a classic recipe. The results make a beautiful presentation. I'll definitely make again.

Add a little grand marnier to the sauce while the apples are simmering. This is superbly tasty, if not 100% authentic, and so easy!

Sauce is a bit thin as others have noted.. even when made with cream. I used Ida Red apples and they were delicoius.

These are incredible. I made these at 1 AM for my guests on new years after quite a few glasses of wine and it still turned out great. I highly recommend this!!

I am NEVER going to tell anyone how easy this is because I enjoy all the praise too much. Like previous posters I used a different apple (jonagold) and replaced water with heavy cream. This will be a staple in my culinary repitoire.

I've only made this once and I made a couple of changes to the recipe. I used Granny Smith apples and, instead of water, I used whipping cream. Served it at a family dinner with vanilla ice cream and everyone enjoyed it very much.

My mother, being from France, used to make this dish for me as a child. It was one of my favorites (though almost every day was a different French Pastry). I was happy to find a recipe that was almost as good as hers!!!

This was a wonderful recipe, especially for the amount of prep time. The crust was flaky and delicious, and everyone raved about it. I did need to add more brown sugar to the sauce, as it was not thick enough when I made it according to the recipe specifications.

This was ok, but in my quest for the perfect tartre tatin years ago- the ultimate was the Polidor's Tartre Tatin recipe from the May 1994 issue of Food and Wine-the Best of Paris issue. I have made it dozens of times and it has never failed to delight.

It's OK. Agree that the sauce is thin. I'm going to keep searching in the tarte tatin realm for something more authentic. But for a first go, it's worth a shot.

I almost chose to make a different desert because I couldn't believe that, with so few ingredients, this could be as wonderful as all of the other reviewers said. Luckily, I did make it and it was AMAZING! It was so easy...almost too good to be true. I didn't even remove it from the ramekin. Instead I put the ice cream right on top and then we didn't miss a drop of the delicious sauce. I will be making this again and again!

This is a great dish and very easy. I often make it at the last minute if I want something elegant and easy. I saute the apples a long time in the brown sugar and water.

I agree that this was easy to make, but I didn't think that it was that great. I didn't realize that the sauce would be rather thin, so be careful when inverting -- or you may spill.

A terrific desert that is so easy to make. It would have been worth the effort had it required any! I served it hot from th ehoevn with vanilla ice-cream and it was amazing.

What I loved about this great treat was how my freinds and family raved. I love it when a recipe is so good but soooo easy. Thanks for this treat.
