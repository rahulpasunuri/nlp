Excellent recipe, . . .I added a chopped sweet onion, some allspice (11/2 teaspoons), less raisins, and some chopped dried apricots, and I used brown sugar...

Quick easy and very nice mild flavour that is a fantastic complement to cold ham.

I was very pleased with this recipe. I did add some cinnamon (as recommended by earlier reviewer) and substituted dried apricots for the sultanas. Excellent! Also cleared my sinuses with the vinegar vapours, too.

This recipe has a nice flavor to it and warmth that will work with as a condiment to meats. I think I would add diced onions to it in the future. It seems to needs just a little bit more of something. but it was very good! this would be great on a cornbread sandwich as well with melon and some southern ham. it doesn't have that Indian sort of flavor. I'm going to make several apple chutneys so this is a great one for not having the indian flavor. I also doubled the recipe and got enough to CAN 6 PINTS. CAN'T WAIT!!! TO PULL IT OUT THIS AUTUM AND THEN THANKSGIVING. MMMMMMMM.

Delicious! I didn't change a thing on this recipe. I started bringing this to the Thanksgiving feast about seven years ago. Only those who were brave enough to try it raved about it. Now, everyone practically demands it every year! One year, I made the mistake of bringing another sauce to accompany the ham. I'll never do that again. I would be fired from the family!

I couldn't even give this a "just so-so". It was awful. Maybe it will mellow after a couple days in the fridge. I kept thinking the 1 1/2 cups of vinegar to 1 1/2 pounds of apples didn't seem correct. I noticed on another recipe on this site it called for 3/4 c. vinegar to 1 1/2 pounds of apples. That seems more like it. Don't waste your time or apples.

You really have to like this sort of thing. Perhaps I don't understand the concept of a chutney but I really like the mango chutney that I get at Indian restuarants. This one was really tart and vinegary, as one other reviewer noted, and I used less vinegar than called for. It wasn't horrible but it is probably an acquired taste. Perhaps it will taste less "biting" tomorrow.

This dish was OUT OF THIS WORLD! Me, a semi-pro cook was looking for a chutney for Thanksgiving. I wanted something interesting with apples. Just a few pointers, add a little bit of cinnamon,allspice and extra rasins.

A great recipe! It has become a welcome staple at my family's holiday get togethers. Yes, while the cooking process does lead to a rather strong odor, the end result is well worth it! Also- it's best when made ahead of time and refrigerated for a day or so... I recommend it!

VINEGAR!!!!! My house **reeked** for a couple of days as well. This one definitely takes a while to mellow. A little goes a very long way, as most guests are wary (I suspect due to the mustard seeds, which give it a suspiciously figgy appearance). I've since found a crock pot recipe that doesn't involve vinegar, which I will try instead next time.

Made this the Sunday before Thanksgiving, thought I would pass out from the terrible odor of vinegar and all the garlic cooking together, Wasn't too impressed with the taste either, although it wasn't bad. It took about a day to not smell it in the house. Refrigerated the Chutney and brought it out for on Thanksgiving to have with cheese and crackers. Have to admit I was afraid to try it because of the experience on Sunday. However guests raved about how excellent it was so I tried it, truly amazing what 4 days in the refrigerator did to mellow out the taste. A great accompaniment to cheeses. Will definately make again(with the windows open).

Fabulous. I made this for a Fondue and it tasted terrific with beef and pork. Everyone at the table loved it.

Wonderful with pork. Be careful though if you double it, don't double the ginger. I have made this several times and people love it. Its definitely a condiment though and not a side dish.

I have made this dish several times. Guests are a bit wary at first, but by the second bite, they're addicted! I've used it with everything from poultry to cheese trays.

I used less vinegar, about 1 1/2 cups, and it was plenty acidic. We all thought it was a wonderful accompanyment to Thanksgiving turkey.

I made this chutney several Thanksgivings ago. Now I'm asked to bring it every year. It has become one of our family traditions.
