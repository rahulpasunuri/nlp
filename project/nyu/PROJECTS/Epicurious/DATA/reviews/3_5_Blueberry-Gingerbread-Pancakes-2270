I made this as a surprise for my boyfriend for Thanksgiving breakfast and we we're both surprised! They we're absolutely delicious and I would definitely make these again!!!

A good buttermilk substitute is regular milk with about 1/2-1 T lemon juice. I had very good luck with this recipe and everyone thought it was delicious, except my husband who thought they were too sweet, but still tasty. I may try them again with him and cut the sugar/molasses quotient. As others have noted, the pancakes are quite difficult to turn. One gets around this problem by using two spatulas (one to lift up a bit of it, the other to slide under) and by turning them over more than flipping them (get under a corner and simply move that corner, rather than the whole pancake). This turn-not-flip technique requires the pancakes be quite small or else you get mushed up folded pancake. They also have to be pretty thin, but if you get them too thin, the blueberries will be thicker than the pancake. I suspect this is why another reviewer recommended wild blueberries especially for this recipe. I had good success with PNW blueberries and I think I prefer the flavor of the PNW berries with the complex gingerbread spices; having fresh big blueberries explode juicily in your mouth amidst the gingerbread spices is just fantastic. I'm sure they'd be good without the blueberries, but I reserve the fourth fork for the blueberry version. A really great idea for a topping came from Cottage Living, whose gingerbread pancakes lost out because they had beer in them and we were out. Mix about 1/2 c. sour cream with a similar amount of real maple syrup for a delicious drizzle that cuts the sweetness. Everyone at the table chose "the drizzle" over the plain syrup. This requires using real maple syrup though; I don't think the flavor of the fake stuff would stand up adequately to the sour cream.

Made some adjustments based upon what I had available and previous comments on this site. Result was a wonderfully delicious pancake. "Can't recall ever having had a better pancake" per my husband. He told me to register on Epicurious just to submit the changes so I can pull this recipe up wherever we are. Substituted buttermilk with equal parts of 1) sour cream and 2) 1/2 tsp vinegar plus milk to make up the volume and lighten the mixture. Substituted light molasses with 2/3 part Old Plantation molasses plus 1/3 part light corn syrup. Mixture was lightened with ~2Tbsp whipping cream before frozen blueberries were added. Also cooked with just a touch of butter w/oil creating delicious crispy edges.

These pancakes tasted great. I used 1/2 C nonfat plain yogurt instead of the buttermilk thinned a bit with 1/4 C nonfat milk. I still prefer my cakes a bit thinner and added water to make them the consistancy that I like. They have great flavor and are a different spin on the standard breakfast pancake.

DELICIOUS and a big hit at the holidays for a break from pumpkin everything. As other reviewers said, they do take longer than usual to cook but are worth it if you follow the following instructions: a) definitely add extra buttermilk to lighten the batter -- I added another 1/4 cup; b) make sure your pancakes are SMALL (3 inches wide tops), c) flatten them like the recipe says so they aren't too thick, d) add another 1/4 cup of buttermilk, d) use small wild blueberries (thaw & drain them if frozen). Some substitutions that worked for me: I used 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. cloves instead of the 3/4 tsp. pumpkin pie spice. I subsituted 1/2 cup dark molasses and 1/4 cup light corn syrup for the 3/4 c. light molasses because I couldn't find the light molasses the night before. Once, when adding extra liquid at the end, I accidentally used 1/4 cup lowfat eggnog instead of a 1/4 cup buttermilk, and it was just fine! I doubled the recipe with no problem, made it the night before and covered it tightly, and added the blueberries to each pancake while cooking instead of folding into the batter. That way, if batter does unused, you don't waste all those great blueberries!

Batter was very, very thick, and cooking took forever, giving the cakes a very dense, eggy texture. Flipping was nearly impossible. Next time I make these, I'll add more buttermilk - thanks for the heads up from a cook from Warsaw!

The batter was too thick, so I added another 1/4 cup of buttermilk and it was better, made turning them alot simpler too. I would make this recipe again, but would use less molasses, say about 1/2 cup (although my husband thought is was just fine). This recipe uses alot of blueberries, which ensures that each pancake has plenty of them to thrill your tastebuds. Great flavors.

Actually I haven't made this recipe yet but I certainly plan to. I just wanted to suggest that if anyone is truly a pancake nut like me, you must go down to Target and get family-size electric skillet. For about $35, you'll be able to flip out 6 6-inch flapjacks at a time on those weekend mornings when everybody's hungry and simply can't wait!!

This recipe was delicious (if you like gingerbread), but the pancakes were very difficult to turn--the batter is thick and sticky, and it was difficult to slide a plastic spatula under the pancake. Next time I would use more buttermilk to make it a bit thinner, and I would use a well-seasoned cast iron or an enameled pan in order to have a semi-non-stick surface and still be able to use a thin metal spatula. This recipe would also be easier to make with small blueberries, like wild blueberries, rather than big ones.

Refreshingly unique pancakes. They did take ridiculously long to cook all the way through, though. So to avoid working over the stove all morning long, consider using two skillets! Finally I gave up and baked the remaining batter in a cake pan in the oven. I even had defrosted my frozen blueberries before adding, based on another reviewer's comments. Instead of using 3/4 t commercial pumpkin pie spice, I tried 3/8 t cinnamon, 3/16 t ginger, 1/16 t nutmeg, 1/16 t allspice, 1/16 t cloves. If it weren't for the cooking time issue, I would try this again with less ginger and more of the other spices.

I loved this recipe. It was loved by our children and adult guests for a fabulous brunch get together. They were easy, light and fluffy. Can't wait to make them for my husband and I for a romantic breakfast with some Champagne with clementine juice. It doesn't get much better!!!

These were great, light, and unusual pancakes. Mine took less time to cook than suggested.

One of our very favorite breakfast recipes. Blueberry maple syrup is the way to go with this recipe. They also freeze well if you have leftovers.

I loved this recipe! The pancakes were good with unsweetened maple syrup. Sprinkle granola for a good garnish! I also used Alaska blueberries, which worked better than Maine blue berries, appearently. But then again in order to get good blueberries in this state, you have to go at least l00 miles to the middle of nowhere to get them, so I guess I can pack them in better condition.

Disappointing. Took too long to cook through, tasted rather bland, and worst of all, a waste of Maine blueberries carefully transported more than 300 miles. A better bet: make good gingerbread and serve with blueberry sauce.

These are delicious pancakes. I used 2/3 C. of dark molasses (I didn't have any light) and 1 C. of buttermilk. They were great!

Featherlight, delicious and easy to make. These will be the pancakes I make from now on!

A fantastic pancake. My only concern was difficulty cooking due to a very thick and sticky batter. Next time I'll try to thin the batter out a bit with more liquid. Left-overs are great! Just like a cookie!

Wonderful!! Can't wait to fix these for my grandchildren.

The flavor of the pancakes was wonderful. My 17 daughter immediately declared this her new favorite pancake recipe (high praise from her). The only problem I had was with the frozen blueberries - ours were very large and very cold and made cooking the pancake a problem because the pancake around the blueberry stayed uncooked. Easily solved by serving the blueberries on top or defrosting the berries first.
