I made this with half the stick of butter and added 1/2 cup of frozen corn. It's moist and yummy.

Pretty flavorless. I can't believe somebody thought that this was dry!

Delicious, perfect.

I didn't find it overly buttery--the bread was dense and had a great crust and a subtle flavor that was the perfect foil to some jam. Made my kitchen smell amazing and made my boyfriend like me a lot more the day I made it :) This one's a keeper for sure

I have to admit that I made a few changes. I didn't have buttermilk so used milk and vinegar, I added a small tin of whole corn and heaped my tablespoon of sugar (I do like my cornbread just slightly sweet - not very!) This worked very well and looked very pretty and rustic in the skillet.

I don't know why this recipe gets positive reviews. It has okay texture, but no taste. And it is waaaaaay too buttery. I think it might work in a sutffing, but as a side, no way. I will be removing this one from my recipe box.

Will definitely make this again. I think the cast iron is key.

I doubled this recipe because I'm making corn bread stuffing for thanksgiving and I need a lot. It was downright disgusting. It was SO saturated with butter that I had to throw it away. Inedible.

My southern born husband really liked it, and so did the kids. Would make again.

My husband, a southerner, loved it. Said it was what he remembers from childhood. To me, it seemed a little bland, like it needed more salt. Trying to curb saturated fats, I used half butter and half canola oil. Melted the butter in the skillet as directed and allowed it to brown. That added a nice flavor.

This is authentic Southern cornbread, and a very easy recipe to boot. I often substitute milk with a little vinegar OR milk mixed with sour cream or yogurt for the buttermilk.

I couldn't find buttermilk at my grocery store so I used sour milk (milk curdled with vinegar instead) and it turned out fine. Also added some jalapeno and corn. It wasn't as sweet and moist as I am used to, but my boyfriend couldn't get enough of it. Makes an impressive presentation in the skillet and looks great cut into wedges - nice change from the usual.

Good "southern" cornbread - not that sweet cakey stuff.

cornbread with the nice crispy brown bits around the side. I did add some honey to the wet list to bring up the sweetness a bit..just my preference though.
