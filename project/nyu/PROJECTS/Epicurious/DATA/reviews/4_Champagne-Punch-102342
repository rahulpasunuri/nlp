Don't know how anyone could not find this practically perfect. Made this for my mom's 70th. Family members re-named this "giggle juice" and asked for the recipe. People are till talking about this punch 4 years later!

Had this punch recipe at an annual Christmas party and it has become my go-to entertaining punch. Careful: it's super, super boozy, but doesn't taste that way, so you're likely to get sloshed early. Everyone who had it though loved it, so I'd be happy to make it again!

Perhaps my taste but was looking for something lighter.

I've been making this punch for holidays for at least 10 years now. So good! Guests always ask for the recipe and I never have any left over at the end of the night. I follow the recipe to letter, except use diet ginger ale.

This is so delicious but I like to use sparkling apple cider instead of ginger ale.

I had such high expectations for this recipe, and tested it out before serving at my son's engagement party. I could barely choke mine down, and my husband threw his out. This was way too sweet and the flavors did not compliment each other at all. Now it's back to the drawing board to find the perfect champagne punch recipe.

Made it for a big Christmas party. Outrageously good. And so easy! I used a Creme de Framboise that I had on hand in place of Chambord... aren't they pretty much the same? Otherwise followed to the letter. Made a pretty ice block with carambola (starfruit), fresh raspberries and mint.

An excellent party drink! I made a double batch and kept half in the refrigerator in pitchers to refill the punch bowl throughout the party. The guests raved about it and several asked for the recipe to make for their upcoming parties. I used diet ginger ale to reduce the calorie count and it was still great. I didn't want to dilute the punch with ice cubes melting as it sat out, so I made some star shaped ice cubes with pineapple juice and cranberries (for color) and floated a few of those in the bowl. I had an ice bucket on the side for guests to add their own ice when pouring a glass. My new party staple!

This punch was fantastic! I made three batches for about 50 guests. I was initially worried about adding ice to the punch bowl for fear of diluting the punch, but it went so quickly that the ice didn't have time to melt! My guests could have easily downed another 3 batches if I had them...

Help to those who have made this: I am concerned that this punch will be too sweet - thoughts on substituting one of the bottles of gingerale with club soda? I haven't made punch before and given the cost of the ingredients, don't want to experiment. Thanks for any suggestions.

I make two batches for every party and it's always the first to go. Perfect as is.

Served this for a bridal shower - the ladies seemed to enjoy it. It did look pretty in the glass, but I didn't think the punch was a very pretty color in the punchbowl. Some of the Chambord I used was from mini bottles that had been in my liquor cabinet for years and that may have affected the color. Thank goodness I had a back-up nonalcoholic punch for the pregnant guests! I used prosecco instead of champagne.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious! Enjoyed by all. Made 2 batches in advance of the New Year's party and at first sip recognized that a third batch would be required, so quickly mixed that up to let sit while we consumed the others. Would definately make again. Cheers!

Made this for a Halloween party in which many foodies attended. It was a big hit from the beginning to end. I doubled the recipe but was short one bottle of champagne, so I only added 3 bottles and it was still plenty strong. It did not have a strong liquor punch taste, which is nice but still packs a punch. Ha Ha! Would definately make it again.

oh crap-this was a hit at a bachelorette party! instead of chambord and brandy (too sweet!) i used "x-rated" -flavored vodka. this.was.fantastic. i also made an ice ring with summer fruit to offset the pink punch. Everyone loved it! 3 stars only because i changed a large part of it.

I threw a party for my sister's 50th birthday and served up this drink. We had a blast and giggled all night long. We've officially renamed the punch "GIGGLE JUICE". P.S. buy an extra bottle of pineapple and gingerale in case people stay a little longer!

Made this for a cocktail party/fundraiser for 120 guests and it was a hit. I made four bases the night before and told the bartenders that all they had to do was add the ginger ale and champagne. I used a "generic" chambord and the cheapest Triple Sec available to cut down on cost. Can't wait to have a reason to serve it again!

Well this has been a MUST SERVE at all our parties for years. This New Year's Eve will be no exception. Since "stars" are my decorating theme this year, I will freeze a pre-mixed batch in a large star-shaped silicone mold with slices of carambola (star fruit) and raspberries --that way the "ice" won't dilute the yummy cocktail as it melts but will just add more to the bowl (and there NEVER seems to be enough!!) I've bought some LED flashing ice cubes to add drama to the punch bowl (wanted star-shaped ones, of course, but they were waaay too expensive for the effect.) We use diet ginger ale (hah!) and don't find it too sweet at all. Happy New Year, hic!

Rating: 4
Made this for Christmas Eve; it was festive and much easier than making mixed drinks for twenty-one people. I used half Triple Sec and half Cointreau (what I had open). Next time I think I will use half Cointreau and half Grand Marnier to cut the sweetness just a bit.

I've been making this recipe about 5 years. Did it exactly as written first time, but froze the base overnight. Since then, I freeze the base and leave out the ginger ale. Every time someone new tries it, they ask for the recipe.

Do not hestiate to make this recipe. I have served it three times this holiday season and EVERYONE loved it. I really is better if the pinapple juice mixture can sit overnight. But if you need a cocktail quick, it's still good. And don't let the "punch" name fool you---this is one strong drink! Perfect for a party---be prepared to at least double the recipe for a crowd.

I've made this punch for the past 3 Christmases, and can't wait to make it again this year. The chilled boozy mixture is like a thick, sweet nectar, and when the champagne and ginger ale are added (I always pick a DRY, cheap champagne like Brut), everything comes together beautifully. People love this punch. I serve it in kitschy cut-glass punch bowls, and I make a decorative hunk of ice by freezing raspberries in a small copper molding ring. Gorgeous and so good!

Okay, I thought, with so many good reviews, this punch MUST be fabulous! Well, it was not fabulous, it was dreadful. Too sweet, a peculiar color, a nasty aftertaste, and WAAAAAY expensive. Don't bother.

I served this for my Christmas party and wow, what a hit! I'd thought that I'd fiddle with the recipe a bit, perhaps add Alize, or fresh lime juice, but it didn't need a thing. It reminds me of the raspberry sherbet punches you'd get at bridal showers. I floated ice rings with orange slices and cranberries frozen in them, but you may wish to substitute raspberries for the cranberries so that you can eat them without a big pucker!

Nothing better for a bachelorette party. Cool, fruity, delicious, and so alcoholic that even the bride wasn't annoying for long.

Excellent! We made the base the day before so it had plenty of time to meld together. The punch is so tasty and those that didn't plan on having any, they were enjoying it too. I look forward to making this again for my next party.

I made this for my friend's bridal shower - doubled the recipe and used blackberry brandy instead of chambord, threw in 2 bags of frozen raspberries and lots of ice - it was a HUGE hit. We should have at least tripled it.

I made this for a formal lunch and everyone loved it. I did not mix anything ahead of time, just refrigerated all ingredients for 24 hrs. An ice ring w/berries and mint was beautiful and appreciated by all.

I make this recipe as often as possible. It's not so much champagne punch as a champagne cocktail made in a giant bowl. It's wonderfully delicious just as the recipe says. I use frozen berries as ice.

I made this for a friend's birthday party with about 20 guests and it was gone before the party was 1/2 over. A huge hit! I also did an ice mold with fresh rasberries which added a visual wow factor too.

I made this as a last minute afterthought for 30 guests at Mom's birthday brunch. I froze a ring of water in a saverin pan filled with raspberries as the ice in the center and this was a huge hit! Not a drop left.

This punch was sublime at our New Year's Eve gig! The ginger ale's carbonation didn't work with our newly purchased Champagne fountain until about 2 hours into the party, but as the fizz went down, no one cared about the fountain, only the punch anyway:)I actually ended up doubling the recipe on the go (which meant no overnight marinating for the 2nd batch of liquor) and it was still great!

We make this every year for our New Year's Eve festivities. It was a huge hit when we introduced it 6 years ago and remains so to this day. We substitute another bottle of Champagne for the ginger ale - so our version is a tad stronger and moderately less sweet. We use a brut champagne.

I have made this over the holidays and for many special occasions in the last few years. It is always a spectacular hit - and it seems no matter how much I make it is always gone. I normally feature one "special" drink at our parties and this one has always been the star performer. I will use it for our holiday open house this year.

We doubled recipe and added "ice cubes" made of tangerine juice to the punch bowl. Raves, raves, raves all around and not a spare drop at the end of the evening. Three guests walked away with the recipe in hand. Best punch I've ever tasted.

THis punch was a BIG hit. I made 6 batches of this recipe for our New Years Eve party and everyone loved it! They loved it so much that they never even touched the wine or other alcoholic beverages we provided. My husband was very impressed!

If you want to be the most popular person at any party you go to, just make and bring this champagne punch. In less than 1 month I've made it for 3 separate events and everyone has LOVED it!

I made three batches of the mix. Two were used on Christmas Eve and the third the next day. Everyone seemed to enjoy it. It was a great alternative to expensive ($10.00 per bottle) wine or mixed drinks, which can render some guests dangerous. A word on economics: I made enough for three batches, using 6 bottles of $7.00 champaigne. I used extra dry, which was on sale and I don't think it made a difference in taste. The whole recipe cost $85.00, but a good shopper could probably get the ingredients cheaper. Between now and next Christmas, I'm going to experiment with different ingredients, but I enjoyed this recipe and recommend it highly.

This went over very well at my holiday party. In the past I've struggled to make mixed drinks for a crowd and decided to try a punch recipe this year. It went over so well, that guests who would normally choose beer or wine went for the punch instead. I made a double batch and it was gone after the second hour - should have quadrupled the recipe!

Wow -- this was delicious! Thanks to all the previous reviewers who swayed me to make this. I served it at a tree trimming party and it got rave reviews -- people loved that it wasn't too sweet. Many asked for the recipe. I used Cristalino, which is an inexpensive, but quality champagne. This will become the annual event's signature drink -- everyone loved it. All the beer and wine I bought went untouched. Lesson learned.

I made this punch last Christmas for a neighborhood party. It was so good I almost couldn't keep up with how fast people kept returning to the punch bowl. I agree the color isn't the greatest, but after a few glasses, no one will care. It DOES pack a bit of a "punch" that sneaks up on you - if you aren't careful you can end up tipsy. However, in moderation, it's EXCELLENT.

Very good although I changed the recipe a bit since I didn't have all the ingredients. I substituted cassis for the chambord and 7up for the gingerale but the punch still got rave reviews.
