We loved it and have made it every Passover. It is an easy recipe to make with children.

I made these as well as the "Decadent Fudge Brownies" and compared - these were much drier, less fudgy. The taste was fine but not the texture. The "Decadent Fudge Brownies" were definitely the winner.

I made these brownies and they came out wonderful. They were moist and I have already been asked to make them again next year.

Unbelievably good. I couldn't find Kosher ofr Passover chocolate chips, so I chopped up a semi-sweet baking bar. I made two batches, one with nuts, one without. Everyone loved them. I think these are worth making all year long.

HEAVENLY. Definitely too yummy to be kosher for passover but THEY ARE. I read other reviews and just as someone else i added the extra TBSP of sour cream and cooked only for about 25 minutes and am so excited to eat them and have everyone at the seder enjoy them as well.

I made these and the "decadent" passover brownies from the Marcy Goldman recipe on this site and have to say I preferred the other to this one. The other brownies turned out richer, moister and with slightly less of a matzoh meal aroma.

Made these for the kids for Passover, and they were a hit. The brownies were not dry at all. Flavorful, rich, moist, chocolatey...not just for Passover. I will make these every Passover!

For Pesach- as good as it gets. I made Parve w/ light mayo and margerine but still tasted great. I also had a very heavy hand with the melted chocolate and the chocolate chips. I don't know about making it during the year-- lets get real people! But for Passover- 4 forks.

Delicious--moist and chocolatey! Easy to make also.

I have baked for years and this is truly one of the very best brownie recipes ever. My family loved them. I will make them all year.

These were very easy to make...I baked for a large group and quadrupled the recipe and it still came out great. They also freeze well!

These brownies are superb. I consider myself to be a fairly experienced baker and don't rate anything to be superb unless they are unusually good. I served them for Passover and everyone loved them. I will definitely make these again during the year. Extremely moist, yet cakey. Yum.

Very yummy!!!! This is the second time for making them and I forgot to reduce the cooking time as suggested. They were not as moist this time. Our solution was to add some pareve chocolate frosting. Now they are really decadent.

I just took them out of the oven and plan to freeze them for passover cpming up in 10 days. They're still cooling but look wonderful and rose beautifully. After reading other reviews I'll have to test one to be sure it isn't too dry before I make the 2nd batch. Thanks for an easy recipe, I'm about to forward the recipe to my daughter to add to her menu.

I made these during Passover and thought they were fab!!

These brownies are unbelievably good! I have made them again since Passover, and will save this recipe as a year-round keeper. They are not too sweet, and perfectly in between the fudgy and cake-y consistency.

I added raisins and baked for a little less time to ensure moistness and was not disappointed. I made these once for the Seder and then again later in the holiday for a brunch we were going to. My gentile friends thought they were wonderful and my husband said he really could not tell the difference. I emailed the recipe to a friend who was equally as pleased. This is a keeper for sure!

I wanted these to be parve, so I replaced the sour cream with mayonaise. They were delicious. I will make them next year. Perhaps, I will shorten the cooking time a bit to see whether they stay more moist. But, actually, my guests loved them as they were!

This is such a good recipe that I would use it all year! It got raves at the Seder.

I am not quite as high as everyone else over these brownies. We ended up making an apple crisp using matzo meal instead of flour--that was much more popular than the brownies. I thought they were a bit dry, too. I would definitely only cook for 25 min at most. Will try adding the extra sour cream next time, though.

These left my usual Passover chocolate covered macaroons in the dust! Making these on a trial run before my Seder, I found them to be slightly dry, so the second time around I added an additional tblsp of sour cream and it made all the difference. I also cooked them in about half the time indicated. They were wonderfully moist, very chocolatey and am enormous hit with my friends and family. Definitely a reason not to toss your cake meal! These will make it to the dessert table every year!

These brownies are amazing. I served them with three other homemade desserts and the brownies were still completely eaten. Even by the skinny women who never eat dessert!

Very easy...could hardly taste the matzah...was a little dry but hey, it's a Passover recipe.

This is my second year making these brownies for Passover -- they were a huge hit last year! They taste fantastic and are so easy to make. I left out the nuts (personal preference).

Not only an easy recipe, but an incredibly delicious, light yet rich brownie. Would make again and again, even if it's not Passover! Bravo!

Sensational. Such a huge hit at Passover and now actually requested for Thanksgiving. What other Passover recipe could boast that?

Awesome! Fudgy and airy. Good enough to not throw out my cake meal and make it year round!

Delicious! My whole family agreed that these were the best Passover brownies they had ever had. It was a big hit and I'd definitely make them again.

Not the traditonal tasteless Passover desserts from years past!! Made them for family and the requests poured in! Very fudgy, almost truffle like!

I could not believe the richness and creaminess of this recipe!! It was a knock-out at our Passover gathering. Very easy to prepare!! Gave the recipe to everyone!!

These are the best brownies in the world. I love them. So do all of my friends. I hope I can find Passover Cake Meal all year. Gosh, they're good. Gosh darn.

It was excellent. I made it for Passover for the children's dessert. I used paerve margarine instead of the butter and kosher mayonnaise instead of the sour cream. This way it was acceptable to have after a meat meal.
