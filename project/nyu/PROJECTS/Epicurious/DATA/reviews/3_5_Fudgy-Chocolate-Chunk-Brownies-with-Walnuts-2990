These were disgusting. Oily, and couldn't even cut...just a mess and waste of expensive chocolate and butter.

This is a family favorite since it was published. Just made it today for a meeting and everyone loved them. Trader Joes was out of bittersweet chocolate so I used their dark chocolate instead and they turned out great. Easy and always delicious. Thanks.

I agree with evelynizo from Ohio---this is a terrible recipe that resulted in dreadful brownies. I can't even cut them into pieces, they just crumble into bits. Waste of expensive chocolate indeed.

O.M.G. Delicious brownies. Not cakey, very fudgey. I brought them to a cookout yesterday. I was nervous at first because no one was touching them, but next time I looked, there was nothing but crumbs left. And then I ate the crumbs. And because they are so rich, I think the one pan was enough to satisfy a large crowd.

These are the best brownies I've ever had. I left out the walnuts for folks with nut allergies, and they were exceptional. Very fudgy, not at all cakey. They are very rich, so I cut them into pretty small squares. When I cut them, they looked like they weren't completely cooked, but it's just because they are so fudgy. I can't wait to make them again.

These have been my favorite brownies since the recipe first appeared, but this week I made them for Passover simply by substituting matzo meal for the flour. I probably transgressed with the baking powder, since it is a form of leavening, but am not strict about the Kosherness. These absolutely must be allowed to cool overnight, covered with foil once they're no longer warm. That's the only way to cut them without ruining all your work. We had raves all around at our table, and requests for some to take home.

I have to update my review. Made these again last night, very good, but they rose in the middle and then completely collapsed after I took them out of the oven. I even baked them on a lower setting because it had happened last time as well. Still delicious, but 0 forks for presentation.

After 2/3ing the recipe, converting the whole thing to grams, leaving out the coffee and walnuts, and screwing up on the baking (oven was on broil instead of bake), my boyfriend still asked for seconds. Can't wait to make them again! (the right way)

These were probably the best brownies I have ever made. The coffee is a great addition-they don't really taste like coffee, it just makes the chocolate taste better. I made the recipe exactly as printed, and they were perfect. I brought them to a barbeque, and people were fighting over the last one. The texture was perfect, not dry at all-be sure not to overbake them and, as other reviewers said, somehow they get better when they're chilled. Great recipe-this will be my go-to brownie recipe.

This satisfies a deep, dark chocolate craving in a way generally only a flourless cake can. One of my stand-by dessert recipes. (I do not use the espresso powder or the 6 ounces of chopped chocolate & still have consistenly lovely results.)

The brownies looked greasy when I put the batter in the pan. After they were baked and cut they fell apart. They were horrible. ARe you sure the amount of flour shouldn't be 1 1/2 cups instead of 1/2 cup as the recipe calls for. What a waste of expensive chocolate.

I made these for my boyfriend because he said he was homesick for his aunt's brownies that she always made during the holidays. I used pecans instead of walnuts and he liked the results. I highly recommend this recipe

These really are incredible -- and really do set up better after a couple days. My only advice would be to not cut the brownies largely as they are indeed very rich. Everyone who tasted them raved about the incredibly rich chocolate-y-ness.

These are hands down the best brownies I have ever tasted! They are rich, but not too sweet. I followed the directions to the letter with the exception of the 3 oz of unsweetened chocolate for which I substituted semi sweet. These were so good that I refrained from adding my standard chocolate glaze.

The very best brownies for grown ups. I brought them to a big picnic, and watched a kid pick one up, take a bite, and spit it out on the ground! Not the best manners, but very funny, and a good testament to the fact that these are serious, dark, not-too-sweet brownies.

Pretty darn stellar brownies! Everyone raved about them today. Chocolate by death with walnuts is the new name of this recipe, if you ask me. I drizzled a mix of butter, semisweet chocolate chips and chopped unsweetened chocolate that I heated in a sauce pan, afte letting it cool some. Anything else would have been too much. YUM!!!

DELICIOUS!!! I didn't have chocolate chunks so I used the miniature Reese's cups for baking. I also topped these brownies with a chocolate cream cheese frosting! Absolutely sinful...and, guess what?!? They were even better the next day straight from the fridge! I don't know why, but a night in the fridge made these brownies even fudgier, with a texture almost like a truffle! I will definetly make these again!

Bummer, this was just ok for me. Not as moist as I would have liked it. It was ok right out of the oven but after it cooled, not so good. My husband still ate it all, but I'm still searching for the perfect brownie recipe :-(

well, I was expecting GREAT things, but sadly I was VERY DISAPPOINTED! It could be my fault, as I didnt use a glass dish (just got some new silicone heart shaped beak ware and wanted to use that) But i didnt think that would make too much of a difference...cause i ended up with brownie soup. The top finally cooked (after over an hour of baking) but the bottom was totally uncooked when i tried to take them out of the pan (and i waited a few hours before attempting to remove them) However, i did get a good review for the taste, but i definetly wouldnt make them again, even in the right pan, cause it wasnt like the taste was unbelievable. So maybe it was just the choice of bake wear, so a word of caution, do not use silicone for these brownies!

These are incredible! This is the brownie recipe I have been looking for my entire life. If you don't have unsweetened chocolate on hand, you could use bittersweet chocolate instead and reduce the amount of sugar to just under one cup. Make sure you don't overcook these. They are best, slightly under done.

I don't think regular brownies could possibly be any better. Rich, moist, fudgy, with a beautiful-looking top. No tweaks to recipe suggested! I used Trader Joe's Pound Plus bittersweet chocolate from Belgium because after a group of us did a bittersweet chocolate blind taste test of Baker's, Ghirardelli, Lindt, Scharffen Berger, Trader Joe's, Valrhona, the $2.99/lb Trader Joe's brand ranked right at the top with (the pricier) Lindt! To bring this up to the 4-fork level for me personally, I would need some special add-in, like a liqueur :)

I was a pastry chef in a coffee shop for some extra pocket change and fun. We used this recipe and got raves from all of the customers. They are the most lushious brownies one could ask for. Be sure to use good chocolate. I have found Ghiradelli good, and the best I have ever used: Valhrona. It is superior chocolate in all regards. The brownies are rich and moist. We would drizzle threads of dark chocolate on top. Frosting would overwhelm. They stand well on their own or with a dusting of powdered sugar. A small scoop of vanilla ice cream or boysenberry sorbet would also be a nice addition on the side. They cut and remove from pan easier if you allow them to sit in the pan, covered with saran wrap overnight or for several hours after they have cooled.

This is the best brownie recipe ever. I made it when I got the Dec. '96 issue and it has become my only brownie recipe. I haven't made it for a while and couldn't remember which issue it was in, so looked it up here on Epicurious. When I remembered how delicious these ALWAYS come out I had to add my review. A definite 4 forker for me!

This is a great brownie recipe. The bittersweet chocolate and coffee makes it very sophisticated and not overly sweet. I took them to a party last night and one woman pulled me aside and demanded to know where I got the recipe. Good chocolate is a must-- I used Belgian.

These are fabulous brownies. But be sure you cool them thoroughly before attempting to slice and remove them. Otherwise they could crumble, and while they will still taste wonderful, they will not look as attractive.

I am a new cook yet I found this recipe so easy to follow. The brownies were a hit!!!!! My family thinks I am the next Betty Crocker.

Hands-down, the best brownies I've ever baked. I used Valhrona bittersweet chocolate, and Hershey' semi-sweet bits for the chunks folded into the batter. My only substitution was to use a tablespoon of Godiva chocolate liqueur in lieu of the coffee, as I had no instant coffee powder. Dense, moist, fudgy - definitely an adult brownie to savor.

These brownies turned out chewy on the inside with perfect outter shell. The chololate flavor was intensified by the coffee. Sooooo good and we will definitely indulge in them again! I wish I could take this recipe to each boulangerie in France. It would be an asset.

I expected it to be so much better based on the rave reviews. It was very light and I prefer a denser, chewy brownie. It also needed a little more sweetness to it. I was disappointed.

These brownies were fantastic! Using epsresso powder and bittersweet chocolate is highly recommended. I also used toasted hazelnuts instead of walnuts. Hazelnut/chocolate combo is the best!

The best brownies I have ever tasted!!! Beyond compare. Bittersweet chocolate is the way to go.
