Used this as a little side for Chicken Pot Pie, and everyone loved it. Realized I left the brown sugar out after the first cook taste, and decided not to add it. Also ommitted the cinnamon due to some guest tummy concerns. Guess my point is that this is a versatile one, and don't be afraid to adjust the flavors to complement the main dish. Would probably add the brown sugar for a pork dish. Will also try chopped walnuts as mentioned by another cook. Yum.

Simple. Good. Will make again.

Yummy fall side dish!! Perfect with pork tenderloin with a maple glaze. If we had had any leftovers, they would have been great on oatmeal the next morning. We used only maple syrup - 3 tablespoons - with cinnamon and nutmeg. Delicious. Local Macintosh and Honeycrisp apples were a terrific combination.

I made this recipe to go with pork chops, and mostly I needed a starting point for proportions. I sauteed the apples as directed, then added the honey (no brown sugar as there isn't any here in France, but I didn't want it dessert sweet any way), cinnamon and 1/2 the nutmeg and I sprinkled in a little dried thyme to add some savory. It was wonderful! I will make this again as directed for a sweet treat on pancakes and such.

Just what I was looking for. Used a tablespoon on orange marmalade instead of honey and orange peel...worked great!

Great recipe. What I was looking for was the proportion, as I did not want a too heavy hand with the cinnamon. I have made this a few times now. Great with pork chops. Like most recipes you can add a few things, or subtract if you wish. I like to add about a dozen golden raisons. I have dried orange peel in tiny cubes and I have added a pinch(not too much) of that ( I soak them first) I find you do not have to add the Brown sugar or honey. I have tried this with 1/4 teaspoon white sugar and that worked fine. I also make this ahead of time and then just let simmer on very low until the rest of the dinner is done. So with pork chops, I would do the apples first before the chops and veggies. I prefer this to apple sauce.

My family really loved this dish. I made it with honeycrisps and macs that we had in the kitchen and used maple syrup as suggested by another reviewer. I substitied mace for the nutmeg and stirred the spices into the maple syrup before adding to the apples.

These were very tasty and fast. Nice easy treat in the Fall, could have used a little more zing perhaps. I served them over vanilla ice cream and we had the leftovers spooned over oatmeal this morning. YUM! Definitely recommend the oatmeal option!

Really easy and tasty. Used some leftover Empire apples I had. Serve it with my New Year's day pork and saurkraut

I used a combination of Cortland and Macs because that's what I had. Instead of brown sugar and honey, I added maple syrup and chopped walnuts. It was like eating dessert! Served with smoked ham and sweet potatoes, it was a great match.

I used Paula Red apples and the dish was awesome. Cooked the apples a little longer than was called for and the consistancy was close to apple sauce.

I really enjoy making these apples with baby back ribs on the bbq. I mix everything up and put in foil pan and bake directly on the bbq. I bake them for 10 minutes covered with foil and then 5-10 minutes with out a cover. Every time I make them they seem to be a little different, I imagine it has something to do with the amount of juice from the apples. Granny Smith`s are great cause they don`t lose their texture.

I'm not a huge Granny Smith fan, but I know they hold up well so I tried it. It was good, but not great. It tasted like Granny Smith apples with cinnamon. With so many recipes out there, I'd rather keep one that I think is fantastic.

This is so easy and oh-so-good! Next time, I'll try a less butter and/or cooking spray to save on calories. Quick and yummy.

I actually made this with peaches that I needed to use up, and it was fantastic. Super quick and easy, great with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream. I will definitely make this again (and also try it with apples!)
