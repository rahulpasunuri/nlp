Wow I should have read the description before making these... I was just like-- these are crepes, not pancakes...? But if you're looking for a thin yummy crepesque breakfast or snack, these would be good. I have no idea what English Pancakes are supposed to be like, but I guess they taste alright. I put in some apricot preserves and a little cinnamon to play with the flavor and it was fine. I bet it would be awesome if you folded them with a creamy filling in the middle.

Growing up my 3 siblings would compete to see who could eat the most pancakes. This matches my memories perfectly. Butter, lemon and sugar (altogether) or treacle (Lyles Golden Syrup) were the two topping options in those days.

very tasty!! I'm no fan of syrup so pancakes with lemon are fantastic. I typically double pancake recipes but there was no need with this one. This recipe yields a lot of pancakes!
