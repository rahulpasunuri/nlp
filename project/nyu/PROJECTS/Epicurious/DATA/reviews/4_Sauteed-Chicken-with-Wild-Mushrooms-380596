I was so excited to find this recipe and have all the ingredients on hand. Rosemary from our garden, homemade chicken broth,porcini oowder!The only thing missing was truffle butter (which I usually have in my freezer) I substituted truffle salt and just used butter. If I ordered this in a restaurant and paid top dollars would I be disappointed. Absolutely not! I served it with Trader Joe's Brown rice Medly Wonderful meal!

This made a delicious weeknight meal. I did not use porcini powder or truffle butter. I'm sure if would be great with both, but I did not have either. Go ahead and throw a whole can of beans in and a little extra broth (I used salted broth and did not find it too salty). Served over farro with green beans. So good.

I made this tonight and it was delicious! I grinded up some dried mushrooms in my bullet processor. For salt I used some truffle salt that I had already. I used only truffle butter and eliminated altogether the plain butter called for. I doubled the entire recipe and served it on orzo. For the orzo after it was cooked I added a Tablespoon of truffle butter, some fresh chives and a little pecorino romano cheese. Plenty of sauce and plenty of flavor, Served it with green beans. I will definitely make this a regular in my rotation of chicken recipes!

Tasty and quick but I will not make it again. It needs more sauce and doesn't have depth of flavor but is very good.

Just perfect. It was easy and amazing, such a quick dinner. Doubled the recipe to use full can of beans and make enough for leftovers. Interesting and delicious. Will make many times again!!

This is by far one of the easiest and most delicious recipes that I have tasted. It is quick to make, and when served over long grain and wild rice, makes an excellent weeknight meal for two. I did not have truffle butter, so I used truffle salt combined with unsalted butter. For the porcini powder, I ground a dried mushroom with my morter andn pestle.
