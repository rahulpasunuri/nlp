Pie crust is tricky. I've tried several recipes and found that experience is key. This recipe was close to perfect - flaky, tender, buttery... Some tips: 1. spoon flour into measuring cup and level off 2. do not overwork or process dough 3. do not add too much water. 4. be sure to chill for at least an hour. 5. use COLD butter/shortening. 6. I roll out the dough on the plastic wrap and then flip it over across the pie pan - the plastic wrap peels right off and the dough is easily transferred to the pan (and clean up is easier)

I used this dough recipe for the Rum Raisin Apple for Thanksgiving. It looked beautiful and tasted like paper. Everyone just ate the filling out.

This was my first solo foray into pie crust, and I was very pleased with how this turned out. Perhaps not the flakiest crust I've ever had (at least when prepared in tartlet pans), but very good and extremely easy for a novice to work with.

This is very similar to my own personal "best" pie dough recipe, although I usually use 10 Tbs. butter & 6 Tbs. shortening. If you found the dough did not hold together, you probably did not use enough water. The amount of water needed to get the dough to just the right consistency can vary a LOT, depending on how much moisture the flour has absorbed from the air. I generally start in the food processor, but dump the dough out into a bowl before adding the water. It's easier to control the dough consistency that way. Mix in the minimum amount of water, then gradually mix in more until most of the dough is holding together in clumps, but you still have some "dry crumbs" left. When you squeeze a bit of dough, it should not be dry and crumbly. It should hold together and be just a bit soft and "squooshy." It's O.K. if it's just a little bit sticky, but it shouldn't be really sticky. It also helps to chill the dough for at least an hour before rolling it out.

I don't usually make pie crusts, so my interprattion and execution of the blending may have been off. But after chilling, the roll out made little islands of dough instead of a continent. We pitched it and bought Pillsbury refridgerated which was very pretty and easy to work with. Not that flacky and tasty.
