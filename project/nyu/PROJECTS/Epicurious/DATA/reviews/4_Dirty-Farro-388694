Wow, what a great dish! I didn't have any cumin so I used 1 bay leaf, some thyme and Tony Chacere's Cajun spices. Interesting, different and tasty. Also suprisingly easy. Loved it!

Fabulous!! I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was great, but next time I will increase all of the vegetables.

Delish! I used chicken sausage to reduce fat, and followed all the other instructions except used a separate pot for the veggies to reduce cooking time and omitted the red pepper.

I was a bit hesitant when putting this together especially when it came to the chicken livers (so was my boyfriend as he saw me making it, infact I believe he referred to me as Hannibal Lecter as I was chopping them up!) but both of us were pleasantly surprised at how hearty and filling it was. I am officially a turned "liver lover" but will def be sticking to chicken!
