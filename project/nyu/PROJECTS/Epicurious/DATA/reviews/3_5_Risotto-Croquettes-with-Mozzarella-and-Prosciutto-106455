I first had arancini in Brooklyn six years ago. I have been chasing those arancini ever since. This recipe is good. I can't say that these arancini equal or exceed the lovely little rice balls i got from the pork store oh so long ago, but they are good. Messy, yes. But worth it. They could use more flavor. maybe peas. maybe garlic. tomato? I will definitely be serving these with a side of sauce. However, they will still need something. p.s. set aside time before you start this recipe.

I have made this recipe a number of times for dinner parties and it is always a hit. I usually serve it with a good chicken marsale recipe and the sauce from the chicken adds a nice touch to them.

We fell in love with arancini in Sicily, and this is the best recipe I've found. The ones we had in Sicily were filled with a little bit of tomato sauce, peas and sausage. Be sure to flavor the risotto as if you were going to eat it..it'll keep the end product from tasting bland. I also used seasoned breadcrumbs. Delicious!

I made these for a dinner party I had and they were well received. They actually changed one guest's opinion on rice...I also made these for a dinner party I was catering and the guest there raved about them. My only suggestion would be to serve them warm, not room temperature. I feel the warmth enhances the wonderful flavor.

I would definitely use this recipe again - but just for risotto (although I think I'd substitute a little of the broth for a bit more white wine, and definitely add some fresh garlic). Once made into croquettes (which made QUITE a mess!) they were rather bland - definitely needed a flavorful sauce accompaniment... or something!

My husband and I thought these were great. They were time consuming to make, but worth the effort. To simplify things I used Panko instead of bread crumbs. I'll definately be making these again.

I made a double batch of these & froze them.My family has always loved rice balls.They were as good after being thawed out as they were when I first made them.I reheated mine in the oven and they crunched right back up.

A lot of work and constant attention, but well worth it.

To the cook who thought these were bland: use a strong sauce next to them. I had them once at a small Northern Italian restaurant,and they were fantastic!! They were served with pork tenderloins in a very strong lamb reduction sauce... The croquettes absorbed just enough sauce as a side dish to be divine. On their own, they would've tasted like tater tots. I can't wait to try this one out!

To the cook in Atlanta... just an opinion, but I'd worry what would happen during the thawing process. Thawing them outside the fridge may not be healthy, and thawing them in the fridge, or cooler, may turn them into mush. But I'm not a health expert, just a cook who wouldn't try it.

I will be a dissenter on this one. I made this dish exactly as set forth in the recipe. It is not that hard to make, but does take the effort of dealing with the mess of breading the rice balls. The problem with this recipe, in my opinion, is that it is bland. It desperately needed some "punch" but the ham did not supply it. Perhaps using some Virginia country ham instead would be a better choice. Neither my wife nor I saw anything special about this recipe -- a waste of good ingredients.

Do you think I could do all of these steps (up to the cooking part), freeze and then defrost and cook? Want to take it camping this weekend but don't want to do the work while I am out there.

My family and I loved this! I substituted brown rice, added garlic, and used seasoned bread crumbs instead of fresh. My only problem was forming the balls, the "filling" didn't really stay inside while rolling in the flour / egg / bread crumbs, but it didn't matter at all. Maybe next time I will also make them a little bit smaller for appetizer-size. Delicious!

Growing up in an Italian house my mom made these all the time. She would use chicken parts that would normally get thrown aaway in that she would make a sauce from chicken necks and giblets. She would then use the sauce to color the rice (too much makes it soupy and then you can't press the rice together). She'd discard the necks and cut up the giblets and also use those in the rice and then stuff them as indicated with the mozzarella. I was wondering if anyone has tried to bake these as I try not to fry anything.

Suppli - are so called when orangini are filled with cheese which melts and form "telephone wires" when bitten into. As one of Sicilian background, I am most accustomed t o whose f illed with minced meat or with fresh peas. In any variation they are a delight hot or cold. As for the version from Catania, they do use eggplants in a zillian ways. Kathryn

I lived off of arancini during a recent 3-week trip to Sicily. These Sicilian treats are an incredible hand-held meal, cheap too (~L1500). Feel free to experiment with the filling. My favourite arancino of all was in Catania, it was stuffed with eggplant. For authentic Sicilian arancini, form them into a cone shape.

Haven't made it yet, but it sounds delicious. My husband's aunt made something similiar, but the meat inside was cooked bits of sausage. How do you figure how much prosciutto you need for 1/3 cup? About an inch thick slice? (Just curious!)

Being Italian, I have known this recipe all my life, but we call it "suppli di riso" and it is eescellant eating!
