These were delicious and simple! We made them for dessert after an Indian meal and served them with mango ice cream.

A very simple yet elegant dessert. I cooked it as a small celebration on a family dinner, and everyone was guessing the spices. Make sure you have best quality spices.

This isn't difficult and is fabulous. Be sure to use a pan wide enough to hold 4 puffs without crowding. It can be made a few hours in advance and refrigerated on the parchment with parchment on top and a light plastic wrap drapped over. Don't skip the pistachios.
