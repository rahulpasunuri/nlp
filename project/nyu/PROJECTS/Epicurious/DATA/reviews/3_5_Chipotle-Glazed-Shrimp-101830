I made these last night for a dinner party and served as an appetizer. I blanched snow peas and folded the snow peas over the grilled shrimp and skewered them with cute little toothpicks I found at Sur la Table. These were the first to go from the appetizer table and the snow peas helped cool down the spicy flavors.

This was excellent! At first taste, I was afraid it was too spicy but my nine year old son gobbled it up in spite of the heat. Really good flavor - sweet, smoky & spicy. I think I will increase the OJ next time just because I love orange and as it is the orange flavor is very light.

This is amazing. I served the shrimp over a salad with cilantro-lime vinaigrette & manchego cheese. It's sweet, yet smoky and a little spicy. Huge flavors all belnding together. Fantastic

My friends mom made this recipe for her birthday tapas party. Aside from making the shrimp, she made portobello mushrooms too. They were sliced and grilled, although she said she didn't marinate them, she just brushed it on as she grilled them since mushrooms soak up so much water. They were DELICIOUS. They barely lasted a few minutes on the platter.

The sauce is delicious, but very spicy as others have warned. My husband and I like the heat, but I would definitely cut the amount of chipotle in half if I were serving it to others. I added a little more sugar to the sauce, along with just a splash of Grand Marnier to boost the orange flavor.

The recipe is awesome! I make one minor change. Before grilling, I wrap a paper-thin 1/2 slice of prosciutto and then skewer. This is a recipe staple in my family!

While I am waiting for this to marinate, I hope someone will answer if they found the glaze to be more a sauce than a glaze. I noticed lots of reviewers called it a sauce, so I'm assuming I didn't do anything wrong. If the finals result tastes as good as the sauce does, it'll be a knockout!

Very good, but my family prefers the Grilled New Orleans-Style Shrimp recipe on Epicurious better.

I did actually serve this with chicken instead of shrimp, but I do want to say that I just loved this sauce. I'll try it again with shrimp or maybe even pork!

I didn't think this dish was very spicy. Actually, for all the work, I didn't think it had all that much oomph at all. It was just so-so. Not worth the effort...I could marinate the shrimp in a store bought sauce for better flavor. Disappointed.

This dish was sooooo Excellent!!!! My husband couldn't stop praising me. As barbaric as it sounds, he licked his plate! I followed the directions until the thickening of the basting sauce, then I added a little sea salt and a touch of honey. I strayed from the recipe for personal taste. I plan on making this with chicken very soon. Enjoy!!!!

Oh my! To repeat the words of a previous reviewer - This Recipe Rocks!! My husband and I devoured these shrimp. I too served them as a filling for fajitas and I made a black bean salad to serve on the side, but we wound up filling the tortillas with the delicious shrimp, some of the black bean salad and drizzled on the glaze - positively divine! I did remove some of the seeds and all the ribs from the insides of the chipotles, which helped to reduce the heat a bit. Please try this recipe - you won't regret it!

I have to agree with the cook from Chicago, it's ridiculous for people to rate a recipe that they have drastically changed and I've also seen ratings from people who haven't even tried the recipe! I've been wanting to get that across for a long, long time. This recipe wasn't bad. I like very spicy but it is so hot I would be very limited on who I could serve it to. My husband agreed and he's Mexican:) I did make a slight change and that was to increase the oj & sugar after tasting the glaze, hoping to cut the heat a bit. We ate the shrimp alone, but using with fajitas may be the way to go, otherwise I'm reducing the chipotles before I serve to company.

How can you rate it at all if you changed the recipe?

Rating: 2
I am only rating this two forks because I had to change it a bit since I was missing some ingredients. I did not have any apple cider vinegar or o.j. so I omitted these two. I simply pureed all ingredients with some lime juice and cilantro/parsley mix and marinated for 2 hours, then grilled shrimp with shells on and used in fajitas. They were great and I will make them again following directions to the "t" next time.

This recipe ROCKS! Watch out if you don't like spicy food because these are very hot. I also use them in fajitas. Everyone loves them.

I used these shrimp for a fajita filling and got rave reviews -- they went much faster than the chicken. I bet this sauce would be good with chicken, too, as the other reviewer suggested.

I used large shrimp, because that's what was on sale. It's probably a lot better with jumbo size. It still came out very good. Everyone loved extra dipping sauce on the side.

An excellent dish. As long as the grilling time is just perfect the shrimp are yummy. Perfectly spiced and beautifully tender.

I served the shrimp along side a Black Bean Tart with a Chili Crust. It was an excellent combination.

This is a keeper! We thought the spicy sauce was wonderful with the shrimp.

I would definitely make this with chicken instead of shrimp. Mabe I am a purist, but I thought it gave the shrimp an odd taste. Liked the seasoning, quite easy to put together. Bottled?!? Ick!

Excellent Flavor -Hot, but not enough to bring tears to your eyes! Best when charcoal grilled.

My family and myself certainly enjoyed this recipe. It is simple to make and the glaze is fantastic. I wonder if the person that suggested purchasing bottled barbeque sauce would substitute a hungry man frozen turkey dinner for a real turkey on thanksgiving? Oh well, just wondering.

This was a good recipe. It was too spicey for me and my family. If I make it again I will use less chiles.It had a nice flavor, but the heat overpowered it somewhat.

I made two different grilled shrimp recipes for a party. This one disappeared the fastest and I had several requests for the recipe. I added an extra pepper, and will add more garlic next time I make this dish. Definitely a keeper!

This was spicy (I, too, am generous with the chipotles) but good. I found it to be quite easy and quick--didn't let the shrimp marinate any longer than it took the grill to heat.

This recipe was good but not worth the trouble. A good bottled barbeque sauce with a little Tabasco added would accomplish nearly the same result without the bother of the sauce.

I just got Bobby Flan's book and this tops any Chipotle recipe he has! And so easy!

Actually I made this with chicken instaed of shrimp. I doubled the orange juice and brown sugar so that it wouldn't reduce down. I baked the chicken at 350 for about 25 minutes. Very good. Very spicy (but then I tend to put in a lot of chipolte. My family says "its good, but its really hot".
