I make this every year for Thanksgiving, and it is very well received. It's a nice departure from the pumpkin cheesecake (which I replaced with pumpkin bread pudding). I make the recipe in two smaller spring form pans, since it is so rich you want to serve small pieces, and I can either freeze one for Christmas or give it away. I add pecans to the crust,and serve it with whipped cream made with a little maple sugar and ground vanilla. (FYI,Trader Joe's sells house brand Vermont and Canadian B Grade syrups). I'm considering playing with the crust, still with the pecans or walnuts,belgian waffle butter cookie or making a maple shortbread nut crust.

haven't made this.... but will soon. are any of you using a water bath/water filled pan on the bottom oven rack? I used to commercially make cheesecake and this REALLY helps...

I was not terribly impressed with this recipe. The maple flavour didn't come out at all. Also, although I baked it for 1h 40 minutes, it was still under done when I served it the next day. As a result, he texture was smooth where fully cooked, but a little too soft in the middle. Disclosure: I used grade a maple syrup instead of grade b and I could only find light cream cheese. My tempermental oven fluctuated between 300 - 350 degrees and back again during baking time which is why I added the extra baking time. I might try this recipe again to try and get the fab results others have raved about.

This is great! I think I would try one because I really like maple syrup because it has lots of health benefits. The only problem is that pure, real maple syrup is very expensive that more individuals can't afford to have some for their consumption. The cost of this syrup can go as high as $100 per gallon and because of its sky-high cost, there are those individuals who take advantage with the situation. In fact, a man is now facing costs of deception after attempting to market flavored cane syrup as "real" maple syrup. The Food and drug administration and state DOA in Vermont both tested samples of an item promoted as "real" maple syrup. The item, however, turned out to be sugar syrup. The incident pushed some to be very careful in purchasing the product and in fact, it is now being worked in the senate as initiated by Senator Leahy trying to strengthen maple syrup law. This law, if approved, would be of great help for the consumers to get rid of fake maple syrup in the market because it would strengthen protections for the brand of Vermont maple syrup.

I'm originally from Vermont so I've had many versions of maple cheesecake. However, outside of Vermont it's either unheard of or just not quite good enough. This one was great! I changed only one element and that was to replace 1/3 of the cream cheese with good quality sour cream. New England style cheesecake is a little softer and not as sweet and should never be made without sour cream! The crust was a little mushy but still tasted wonderful. Everyone loved this, the maple flavor was very subtle, some people didn't know it was maple until I told them.

This is an amazing good cheesecake. Everyone loved it including the non-sweet lovers at my place. Vermont Maple Syrup is the best kept secret. It wasn't too sweet and the creamy texture was incredible. This will be my go to cheesecake.

I made this wonderful Cheesecake this year at Christmas. I varied the crust a bit. I used Le Petit Beurre( butter biscuits) instead of graham crackers, and added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts, essentially making it a maple walnut crust. It turned out wonderful. The filling could have perhaps cooked a few minutes longer, as it was ever so slightly gooey in the middle, but no complaints. Extremely smooth, and insanely rich, but not too sweet. Loved it!

A fool proof recipe for an outstanding desert. Made this with my 11 year old, and the biggest hit at the bake sale! Then my husband, who is the real chef in the family made it- even better. And also made it as mini cheesecakes for a class celebration.

This was really great! I try only to use natural sweeteners such as pure maple syrup, honey, etc...I toasted some slivered almonds on the bottom of the pan and used those as my "crust," instead. This is really great, and nice and easy!

I didn't care for the syrup in the crust. I thought it made it too sticky. But the maple flavor in the cake was perfect. I would make this again, with minor adjustments to fit my own taste.

This cheesecake, my new favorite, was a huge hit with both adults and little kids. I couldn't find Grade B syrup so used dark amber Grade A, which worked well; we could definitely taste it in the cake. The syrup in the crust moistened it and made it carmelize beautifully; it was a delicious touch that I'll use in other recipes that call for a graham cracker crust. One cautionary note: This is NOT a dense, crumbly, New York-style cheesecake. It is creamy, custardy and silky.

Simply delicious! The maple adds a unique and special touch. Rich flavor, smooth texture, a wonderful cheesecake. Being a native Vermonter, I'm a little biased, but everything is better with maple syrup!

Fantastic. I was heaped with praise. Made it for the barbecue the night before my daughter's wedding. We were having hamburgers and hotdogs, but I wanted somthing special. The wedding was at our cottage in New England, so something local like maple syrup had to be a part of it. Definitely go with the grade B (I previewed it a month before the wedding, making it with Grade A and the difference was quite pronounced. Did take a little longer to bake as others suggested, about 10 more minutes in my oven. I added nuts to the crust (ground up some toasted almonds into one of the three I made - I preferred it to the graham-cracker-only one.

I cant get b grade maple syrup down under, but this is subtle and delicous with the commercially available a grade. I make it in muffin tins with pretty liners and everyone gets their own mini cheesecake. This way it is also portable for picnics and pot lucks.

It was delicious, just sweet enough but not overpowering. I had no graham crackers so it was crustless, but still wonderful!

I was a little reluctant, thinking this cheesecake would be overpowering. It was fabulous! A great "swing into spring" cheesecake. Because I live in the northeast, it was perfect to make last month. My family enjoyed the fresh maple flavor and I made a second for friends at work that love to sample my creations.......it got a two thumbs up!

Absolutely wonderful recipe. Easy and delicious. Subtle maple syrup flavour and creamy cake. I took advice from earlier reviewer and served with maple syrup / cream sauce. Used good, old fashioned Grade A Canadian Maple Syrup from Manitoulin Island which I always have lots of because my grandfather makes it on his farm.

I made this pretty much as is, except I subbed some finely chopped walnuts for some of the graham crumbs, then baked in a "bain marie" for about the recommended time. Turned out great, even though I made it 3 days in advance. I served it with the blueberry compote off this web site (also made 3 days ahead), and the flavours went together marvelously. Great use for my current excess of maple syrup (I used locally produced Canadian Grade B, which has a wonderful depth of flavour!) and made a nice ending to my dinner party!

This is a classic recipe with a twist. The maple syrup replaces sugar and adds a dash of sweetness to the cheesecake, and the maple in the crust is a brilliant--and delicious--touch. I carmelized the top using brown sugar and would definitely recommend this approach--the cake is a little bare without any topping. A huge hit with everyone who tried it. I'm already fielding requests to make it again.

Never made a cheesecake, was always too afraid. I had this gorgeous flavorful syrup given me by a friend who scored it in Vermont and had to use it. What a cheesecake! It was the best I had ever tasted! Being a typical cook, I did substitute a fresh shortbread crust instead of the graham cracker one, and it was heavenly.

I made this as a thank you gift, and it was very well received. All present requested the recipe. The small amount I got to taste didn't have a very strong flavor, even though I used grade B as suggested. Maybe it was the syrup...I used Canadian as that was what I could find. I'll definitely try again. No problems with it setting up, although I did bake about 7 minutes longer.

This cheesecake is a huge hit with my family. In fact, they have requested that I make this particular cheesecake recipe over all others I have baked - and I am an experienced cook. I need to say to those who rated this recipe with less than four forks -- perhaps it is because the cooking time specified is not long enough - found this out with first try - it did come out "sort of soupy". Bake this at 325 deg.F. for 1 hour and 15 minutes; then, proceed to test center of cake (a stick of uncooked spaghetti works well) every 10 minutes until tester comes out clean. Then, turn off oven, open oven door slightly and allow cake to cool off in oven. Cake comes out perfectly done and wonderfully scrumptious!

Just another note to the cook from Ann Arbor, MI. Don't worry about the mold. Just pour the syrup through a sieve to remove the funky green stuff then bring it to a light boil. Watch closely so as to avoid a mess!

This is the most amazing cheese cake I have ever made and tasted. It was very moist, had a nice strong maple flavor, and had a wonderful crisp maple crust. I modified the recipe slighty. Instead of using a 10" spring form, I used a 9" (made it extra thick). Plus, I added additional extra grade A dark to make it even sweeter. This is a must recipe for all sweet addicts. I really don't eat cheese cake that often, until now. :-)

Just a note to the cook from Ann Arbor, MI, about how to keep mold off her maple syrup... Just store it in clean mason jars of 1 and 2 cup sizes (dependiing on the amount you'll be likely to need for cooking) in your deep freeze. To thaw, just remove from freezer a couple of hours before using and leave on the counter,or overnight in the fridge, or if you're in a hurry, microwave for several minutes on medium power, stirring a few times. It should keep in your fridge for a few weeks with no problem. If not, maybe check your fridge's temperature to be sure it is as cold as it should be. Good luck! This recipe is delicious and I'll definitely make it again.

Someone gave me a jug of Vermont maple syrup for a gift, and I have been saving it for a recipe like this, which calls for a lot, because I know that once I open the jug, the leftover syrup will get moldy, even if I refrigerate it. This seemed like a good place to post my question - is there anything you can do to keep the syrup from geting moldy? Or any way to get the mold out of it, or off of it, so that the rest can be used? I must confess that I usually use maple-flavored pancake syrup in recipes that call for a small amount, because I hate to buy the real thing and throw most of it away. Suggestions??

This was the most incredible cheesecake I have ever made (and I've made quite a few!) and possibly the best dessert I have ever tasted! My family practically beat each other to a pulp for seconds! I definitely recommend a drizzling (or in my Uncle's case, a DRENCHING) of maple syrup on the top to finish it off, as well as a dollop of whipped cream.

I to was disapointed in this cheesecake as I love maple flavor. I used Grade B syrup. It seemed way too sweet and the texture was mushy. Perhaps it was under cooked. I'd make it again if I knew how to get it right.

I've been making this cheesecake since it's debut in Gourmet (March 98) and it's the best one I make. I've converted non-cheesecake lovers with this recipe! Yes, I did read the non-flowery review and I can only reason that Grade A syrup must have been used and that it wasn't properly mixed and baked. It is important that everything be room temperature and not overbeaten because the eggs will create a souffle-like texture, not creamy as it ought to be. Do not over bake it and you'll have a silky, sensuous cream that you'll swoon over. Grade B syrup can be found at Natural Food markets.

I have made this cake several times, and it is just incredible. It is a little time consuming, so I save this for holidays, but I always get great reviews and second requests. Tip: I have found that if you don't soften the cream cheese, it doesn't blend as well.

Rating: 4
I thought this was a great cheesecake. Definitely use the Grade B syrup though. I would make it more often but I can't get the syrup around here and have to order it from vermont and it gets costly. It was very rich but that's better because then you don't eat as much at one time (less fat in one sitting)

Cheesecake is my favorite (and my husbands) and I LOVE maple syrup, so I coulnd't wait to make this. It was so disapointing! The texture was terrible (granular, not smooth at all) and I could bearly detect any maple flavour. What a waste! I would rather make a plain cheesecake and drizzle syrup over the top.

I love cheesecakes and do it quite often. This is the worst cheesecake I have ever made. This one is a way too rich, I wouldn't add the heavy cream. The texture is too soft. The maple syrup flavor is great though. I wouldn't do it again. I practically threw it away....

OUTSTANDING! Definate maple syrup flavor! Suggestion: use the Grade B as suggested. Us "locals" know that Grade B is thicker, heavier and a more pronounced maple flavor than the Grade A. Even us native Vermonters rave about this one. If it were possible, I would rate this one 5 forks!

I have made this receipe numerous times and the results are always consistent. My husband and kids love all kinds of cheesecake and this is by far their favorite because it is not too sweet, just a rich maple syrup flavor. I use the best quality maple syrup that I import from Michigan every fall.
