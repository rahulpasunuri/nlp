I made this tonight and it was okay. everyone thought it was edible but not exactly the best dessert. i'd recommend using lemon peel in place of the orange for a better taste. the biscuits turned into slightly burnt cookies although they were only baked for 11-12 minutes! I'd chose a different shortcake recipe.

Absolutely great! A unique and delicious take on strawberry shortcake. Be prepared that the biscuit dough is very wet.

I don't know if I did something wrong but my biscuits were very bad. They had an almost salty taste. Not sure why.

Wonderful. I cut back the sugar by half except in the biscuits (why ruin lovely, fresh strawberries), omitted the orange peel in the cream because I'd used it all up in the biscuits, and it was sublime. I did make about 20 small biscuits, however, to make it go around our crowd better. Will definitely make this again.

this is just awesome. a total hit at our bbq. I was in a hurry and bought store bought biscuits (shop rite no less) and it still rocked. totally eclipsed the rest of dinner. everyone's new favorite. I will for sure be making this again.

I have made this several times. Cut the sugar in the berries way back - at least by half. Also, I double the strawberries, and use a single recipe of the shortcake but make 12 cakes (instead of 6) with a 3" fluted cutter. Portion size is more appropriate. It is also better with coarse sugar on top of the cakes. I have used lemon rind in place of the orange.

Our guests said this was the best strawberry shortcake theyd ever had, and it certainly was for me! Lacking a biscuit cutter, I formed 6 lumps from the kneaded dough for a more rustic look. The result was adequate, but if you can get a round cutter Id recommend it, if only to make the sandwiches prettier.

I made this for a dinner party of 10 and it was lovely. Very light and flavorful. Everyone asked for the recipe. A winner and easy to do.

Made this for my mother's birthday upon request. Excellent though REALLY, really rich and filling. Because we had a large crowd, I just decided to double the recipe and make a "layered" cake by pressing each half of the dough into a circular baking dish. Instead of using the orange zest in the strawberries, I just used the juice of one rather large orange I had zested for the cake. I stacked the layers on top of each other and spread a layer of whip cream and strawberries in the middle. It was pretty easy to cut the "cake" into slices and looked pretty too. If you do choose to go my route to make a large cake, beware that all doubled recipe will not fit into a 7cup food processor. I ended up taking it out and add the rest of the cream by hand (the shortcake still came out great, though).

I agree with many of the other reviewers; don't roll the dough and mix it in the food processor(but not too much). Another thing I do is use ice cream instead of whipped cream. This is truly my husband's favorite dessert. When I tried the grand marnier recipe, he was very disappointed, so I just stick with this one now!

I agree with River Hills, this recipe has too much liquid. I assembled mine in a food processor, too, and dropped the biscuits instead of rolling them because the dough was too moist. It produced a low rising, long baking (though nice) shortcake. Hmmm...

Rating: 0
This recipe did not work for me. Was it because I used a food processor to blend the dough? The dough came out overmoist so I had to add 1/2 c more flour. The texture of the finished shortcake was very dense.

Rating: 3
I have made both this and the 'Shortcakes with grand marnier strawberry compote and chantilly cream'. I find the strawberries tastier in the other recipe and the shortcake tastier in this recipe. So I will merge the recipes from now on.

Made recipe to specifications except reduced the amount of sugar on the berries. I have made this many times and is always greatly enjoyed by my family. Is it fancy??? No. But it is absolutely delicious.

Rating: 4
It was a smash hit!!Use half of the sugar for the filling. Has anyone tried this with frozen berries whenffresh is out of season?

Rating: 4
one change to recipe: i wouldn't bother rolling out the dough. just form the biscuits into rounds and bake -- more homey, and also less handling leads to more delicious texture.

Rating: 4
awesome. so delicious and easy -- great to cut up the fruit and throw together the biscuits to make right before you sit down to dinner. then, all you have to do is whip the cream and plate it up and your guest are totally impressed. strawberries looked a little out of season, so i made using a mixture of white nectarines and blueberries to great success. added some lemon juice and a little less sugar to the fruit since i wasn't using strawberries, and it came out great. the shortcakes are a great basic to have in the repertoire for a quick dessert using whatever fruit looks delicious and is in season.

These are ethereal, gorgeous little golden cakes (light in texture but definitely not light in calories). The orange zest in the biscuits and mint in the berries are nice touches: the only change I made was reducing the amount of sugar in the berries dramatically, squeezing half a fresh orange over them, omitting the orange zest and spooning a generous blop of homemade lemon curd on the bottom biscuit before loading up with berries, cream and the top "cover" biscuit. The two citrus flavours played well together...it's a suprisingly subtle combination but even my staunchest foodie friends loved it.

I made this tonite for the first time. It was perfect. I am "shortcake challenged" and these shortcakes were easy, delicious and came out perfectly. I agree, do not leave out the orange zest and the mint. They make this dessert truly special.

I've made this 3 or 4 times over the last couple years and everyone always loves it. It gets 4 forks from me because it's really good but also very easy, a nice change from the norm, and really lets the beauty of seasonal fruit shine. I would never skip either the mint or the orange zest; they make this stand out from other shortcake recipes. Do taste your strawberries before adding sugar, and reduce the amount accordingly. I used some maybe-not-quite-ripe enough berries, so the amount in the recipe was appropriate for me, but in the past I have cut it by as much as half. Definitely give this recipe a shot!

This dessert was absolutely AMAZING. Very simple but tasty :) However, instead of making my own biscuits I went to my nearest Whole Foods and bought their fresh made ones from their bakery section. It still turned out just as well. I loved the orange and mint with the strawberries, they all seemed to taste perfectly with each other. I'll definitely be making this next time I need to impress someone with my cooking

A great summer dessert. I skipped the mint but added lots of orange peel- got raves on the orange-y flavor of the strawberry syrup. Next time, I will try the mint.

Rating: 3
Wow! These are so good. I made them for dessert tonight with my 4 and 6 yr. old sons. Even with all of their "kneading" and rolling of the dough, the biscuits were perfect! Very tender and flavorful. The mint was a perfect accompaniment to the berries. I cannot wait to have the leftovers for breakfast tommorrow! The biscuits reminded me so much of a scone. My only change to the recipe was to use Italian orange/vanilla flavoring that I get from the Bakers Cataloque in place of the orange peel. I LOVE that stuff!

A hit at the dinner party I went to! I deleted the orange,the shortcakes crumbeled a little, making it hard to assemble, but other than that, perfect.

I made these shortcakes and they were so great!! Very easy in the food processor. My friends who don't usually like shortcake because it is too dry loved this recipe. It is very light and super yummy. I will definitely be making these again.

7/23/03: Made this for a party (so easy!) and got rave reviews. The fresh orange peel and the mint put a lovely spin on what people expect to be a fairly ordinary dessert. The amounts of orange & mint were perfect. Biscuits were delicious! I suggest making extra strawberry filling, as it helps balance the rich biscuits--I doubled the recipe & ended up using only 9 biscuits but all the strawberries. Other reviewers are right: need only 1/2 the sugar in the strawberries (even less if they're very ripe) & whipped cream. Update on 4/5/04: A 3-inch cutter makes large shortcakes and thus quite a substantial dessert. I served this last night after a dinner party, and while delicious, it was too much food. For serving after a filling meal, next time I'll use a smaller cutter.

Made just the shortcakes and put strawberry ice-cream in the middle, whipped cream (no mint) and epicurious strawberry sauce... thought cakes would be softer, spongier, but they were good. Will make them again.

I decreased the amount of mint and the amount of orange peel in the biscuits. Next time, I may add orange to the whipped cream, instead of vanilla. It was an easy summer desert (or brunch item).

Way too much orange in the shortcakes. It took away from the breads sweetness and the flavor of the strawberries...would eliminate it next time. A light touch of mint was unique.

To the BerryLover: This recipe is from Bon Appetit, not Gourmet. I often have success when using Gourmet's recipes; don't know if that's what you meant.

This is the best strawberry shortcake I've ever had! I was going to leave out the mint, because I tend to only prefer it in tea and with chocolate, but I was daring and tried it. It was *amazing*. If you're not sure, just use less, but *don't* leave it out. Also, use fresh peppermint, not spearmint and not dried. I've never used a particularly successful recipe from Gourmet, but this one is my new standard. I can't wait for our next potluck. This'll dazzle them!

Yummy, yummy, yummy! We have gotten a few nice days in between the rain, so I thought I would make this. The mint and orange zest gave it a real fresh summer taste. I bought fresh picked strawberries from a local grower, so I only sprinkled the strawberries with sugar and it was plenty since the strawberries were already so sweet. The fresh whipped cream really tops it off!

Only thing I will change in the future is to lighten up on the sugar. Reduce by at least half.

The orange zest is the ticket in this recipe. My cakes came out a little flat, but everyone enjoyed the flavor (& texture even)immensely. Hurray for strawberry season!! p.s. I left out the mint for the sake of picky eaters, but will throw it in next time.

Very good, and pretty simple. Making the shortcake was easy. I left out the orange peel and the mint. I also used a smaller cutter, and served everyone two.

This dish was delicious, and so easy to make! Don't think of skipping the orange zest in the strawberry mixture or the shortcakes--it added extra flavor and was really yummy. This will be added to my "impress the guests" dessert list!

Wow! This simple and delicious dessert was the hit of a back-yard BBQ. I used strawberries and blueberries and a dash of cinnamon too. I cheated on the biscuits and used Bisquick and the result was great. Everyone went back for seconds and thirds. Can't wait to try it with other berries or fruit like peaches.

This is a great recipe. Probably the best dessert recipe I've pulled off Gourmet. It is pretty easy to make, and the biscuits are a hit even without the strawberries. Love it!

The homemade biscuits were perfect, and the orange added so much to the taste. The mint in the strawberries was a little too overpowering, but that's simple to fix: I'll just leave a little mint out next time. And there definitely will be a next time!

What an easy and DELICIOUS recipe. I didn't use the fresh mint, and it was still yummy. Even the in-laws raved! This is the perfect summer dessert. My children ate the shortcake all by itself, it is that good.

The homemade biscuits make the difference in this recipe - the best we've ever had! Also, I tried using half and half in the biscuits, and 3/4 cup was perfect. We do agree with those who thought it was extremely rich, so we now mix the strawberries with only 1/4 cup of sugar.

This is a very tasty rendition of a summer classy -- but it's also incredibly rich! None of us could finish a whole portion. Still, it's worth trying...
