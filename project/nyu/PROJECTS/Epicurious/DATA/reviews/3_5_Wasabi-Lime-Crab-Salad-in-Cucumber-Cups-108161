I finally made these for a Christmas party this year and they were a big hit! I made the wasabi mayo, prepped the radishes and pea shoots (I did a very fine dice on the radishes rather than slice into strips and chopped the pea shoots into ½ pieces) and made the cucumber cups the day before the party. The afternoon of the party, I mixed the salad together and spooned into the cucumber cups. Although there is a big kick to the wasabi and radishes, the cucumber does a nice job of cooling it down. Delicious!

Just what was needed to start off the menu! I made this w/o the sprouts and it was very good, I love the wasabi and lime together, and the coolness of the cucumber. Simple, quick and delish!

If you are using the wasabi/mayo dressing as a drizzle/dressing on it's own, cut the salt in half. I drizzled it over ahi tuna tacos made with wonton wrappers, stuffed with an asian slaw with the ginger vinaigrette from this site - yummalicious!

This was delicious and my guests were impressed with how lovely they looked. They were easy to assemble. I made what I could the day before (the mayo, the cucumber cups, prepped the sprouts) and was able to quickly put it all together shortly before my party started. I highly recommend this recipe!

I made these twice. Fortunately I made a test batch before making them for a large party because the Wasabi as indicated in the recipe was overpowering. Some of my "testers" did not even know there was crab in the recipe! I would not bother to make these with really good fresh crab, but to doctor up less than great crab, for a large crowd, its fine--but start with half the wasabi and taste test from there.

I thought this dish was great! Really need to season the salad to taste and not too much effort involved. Very nice presentation also.

I thought that the presentation was beautiful, but the overall result was just mediocre. Everyone commented on how elegant they looked, but did not seem to really enjoy how they tasted. I found the cucumber cups "mushy."

This appetizer was a hit! I brought it to a party and everyone was absolutely blown away by the presentation plus they were delicious as well. They were the first thing to go and people were asking about them all night. The cucumber cups take some work but overall the recipe is not very difficult and definitely worth the effort.

Made this is an appetizer, but can't wait to try it as a party hors d'oevres, it was perfect! Did without the radishes and sprouts, but sprinkled a bit of chopped cilantro at the last minute for color. Yum!

I cut the amount of wasabi in half and thought it added a nice zing without overpowering the crab. Presentation is great!

Very simple to make and very tasty. I couldn't find a cutter to make the pretty pattern so I peeled the cucumbers, then before slicing them, I used the side of a zester that makes strips and ran it down the sides of the cucumber a few times and when I sliced them, I got the desired effect. I didn't have any sprouts so I used chive blossom instead.

I really liked this althouh I used non-lump crabmeat. Will make it again, only I'll be truer to the recipe. The Lime wasabi was awesome!
