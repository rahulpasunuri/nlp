VERY IMPORTANT! The ingredient list was improperly transcribed from the magazine. They omitted 3/4 c. heavy cream. You add this at the same step as the milk (as noted in the directions). If you omit the cream, it won't become a sauce (per the Cook from Seattle's complaint). Do make this recipe, but make sure you add the heavy cream!!!

This recipe was awful. It doesn't make a hot fudge sauce. It makes a goopy chocolate mess. I should have read the recipe more carefully. When it tells you to add the cream, but there isn't any cream in the ingredient list, you know there's a problem somewhere. I trusted the 4 fork rating. Big mistake. Find a different recipe!

This was very easy (took about 10 minutes total) and so delicious. It tastes like an artisanal chocolate sauce that you'd spend a lot of money on. Just FYI, it only took a few (3?) minutes for the sugars to reach 265 degrees- definitely not 8-10 as the recipe states. Make sure to watch the candy thermometer!
