I did make changes for a fat free version. I sauteed the vegetables in fat free chicken broth (no butter at all) and after everything was cooked and pureed, I added a carton of fat free half and half to the soup for some more body. It didn't need the cream topping either. It was delish!!

This was good but I didn't find it as wonderful as so many others did. I didn't do the dollop of cream since I didn't have any, but other than that I followed the recipe pretty closely. Not sure the cream would have made the difference anyway. Maybe a dry sherry or a sauterne instead of just a dry white wine would have given it a little more distinction. I also like the idea of adding mushrooms.....

This was delicious. The leek flavor was subtle but amazing. I used an immersion blender to blend the soup to a creamy consistancy and used only about 1/4 a cup of parsley as I found that the flavor can overwhelm the simmered leeks. Over all I've made it multiple times to rave reviews. Goes particularly well with a white sauce cheese pizza.

I have made a LOT of recipes on this site & this is one of the best! Decadent. Used half the butter the second time I made it & did not miss it. Will try subbing some of the remaining with olive oil next time for health reasons.

This was delicious. I didn't have enough leeks so I added all kinds of other oniony type things. It still came out well although I think having enough leeks would make the flavor even better. I did end up adding some onion and garlic powder at the end. I didn't have any whipping cream on hand so we used sour cream which added a fabulous flavor. I don't know that it needed that much butter. Honestly I couldn't really taste it. Next time I will probably spray the bottom of the pan first and just add the butter at the end. Great cold weather soup!!!!!!

Delicious! Served it without the cream and this soup still had a lush, creamy consistency. A new favorite!

My husband was doubtful about this soup... the onion-y smell while cooking was a bit much for him. I must admit, I was doubtful too. I didn't have any parsley so I used thyme instead. This soup was surprisingly delicious! I will definitely try it again. Thanks for the recipe :)

My first time cooking leeks so I mistakenly cooked the whole thing instead of just the white and pale part which darkened the color but didn't negatively affect the taste. I like texture so I only pureed half of the soup and I used white grape juice instead of the wine. Of the three soups served at my party though this one was the favorite!

Very good cold as vichisoisse, without the whipped cream. I added a little half and half to the soup before chilling.

Threw a chile into the leek, onion, carrot mixture and it gave the soup a nice kick. I forgot to add the cream when I served it, and it did not suffer from the omission. Will be fun to try it with the cream today.

This soup is absolutely incredible. After I cooked it, I left it in the fridge overnight and then pureed it in the blender the next day. Since it was cold, I pureed all of it in one go. Makes it a little easier. (Not that it is a difficult recipe in the first place!)

I made this soup recently for a crowd of 12 and it was fabulous. I followed the recipe exactly except that I added the dark green parts of the leeks and it turned a deep green. I was worried that it wouldn't have a creamy velvet texture and that it would be bitter because it looked nothing like the photo, but it was fantastic! The whip cream added a delightful touch. We served it with cloves of roasted garlic and homemade bread and everyone went back for a second serving (some went back for 3).

Am on my 2nd bowl and can't believe how tasty this soup is! Did vary it slightly by adding mushrooms instead of carrots and omitting a few ingredients, including the cream,but it isn't lacking for it. Also used tarragon instead of parsley. Definitely gonna make it again!

Delicious and easy - added an extra potato instead of making roux which simplified the recipe. Use an immersible blender for creaming the soup quickly and easily.

Rating: 4
Really good. The whole family loved it. A couple of lessons. I used 4 leeks (all I had) but see how more would definitely define the richer flavor. make sure to put the parsley in after the 15 minutes of simmering, as the recipe calls for...so the parsely doesn't play such a strong flavor in the soup. I used the hand blender to puree the veggies right in the pot and it worked well. Also didn't use the cream at the end. Will make again for sure!

I had to deviate from this recipe and it was still fabulous! I only had 3 leeks, but lots of shallots on hand, so I substituted what was missing in leek weight (went by a previous reviewer who noted that once trimmed, she had 2 lbs of leeks) with shallots and 2 small potatoes. I still added the add'l potato recipe calls for. Used 4 cups of stock and 2 cups of water. Stock came flavored w/white wine and herbs so I didn't add more wine and just added an add'l 1/2 cup of water to make up for the liquid measurement of the wine. Had to cook my roux longer than 3 min. to get it golden. Whisked it approx 8-10 min.Pureed in food processor instead of blender for what that's worth. Instead of the whipped cream, I put sour cream on top and it was great. My husband and I both agreed crumbled bacon would be good on top also! I'm not sure how anyone could consider this recipe "bland" as a few reviewers have. It has wonderful flavor and I highly recommend it, as published or with your own twists.

Divine!! Instead of 8 leek, I added 12. Beautiful flavour....even more so after a few days in the refrigerator. Don't buy heavy cream, instead use creme fraiche.

I did make some changes to this soup. First off, I got distracted while cooking the vegetables, and got very close to burning them, as it turned out it was a happy accident! It added a deep caramelized smoky flavor to the soup. I added a few sprigs of rosemary with the bay leaf. yum. I also used about 3 medium sized potatoes to beef it up a bit. I like hearty soups, so I only pureed about half of the soup. It turned out great, and is even better the next day. I will be making this again!

DELICIOUS! A few modifications: I didn't have a regular potatoes but I added purple potatoes, about 6 of them, cut into 1/2 inch cubes. I didn't puree the soup -- I prefer my soups chunky. I added 2 tablespoons of dried marjoram when the first liquid is added. I only had 4 leeks, so I added extra celery and carrot. I didn't do the heavy cream garnish. It was hearty and satisfying, and the broth was great. Can't wait to eat the leftovers!

Made this as written -- it was really good, especially for a rainy Bay Area evening with crusty bread. Boyfriend is not a soup person but loved it. Used an immersion blender instead of a blender. Works very well.

Just finished making this for tomorrow's dinner and after a (few) taste tests I must say it is excellent! I added an extra potato, a TB of garlic and instead of chicken broth I used better than bouillon. Just had my husband and father-in-law taste it and received a universal "Mmmmmm!!!!" Can't wait to see how it ends up tasting tomorrow, we'll definitely be making this again!

I halved the recipe but added a can of cannellini beans before pureeing it -- delicious. Also left out the white flour and used a corn-based mix instead. Really good!

Same as the others: delicious....I topped it with smoked mackerel instead of cream. We liked it!

Simple and delicious. I didn't have celery or carrots, but used homemade stock made with lots of both so didn't miss the flavors. I omitted the cream but stirred in some evaporated skim milk before blending. It's so rich and creamy it almost seems like it has a little cheese in it. Really good. I get lots of leeks from my CSA, so I'll be making this again.

Fantastic, but it depends on some TLC. I've made this twice, once as is, and it was a little on the bland side, and this last time with homemade chicken stock, a few thyme sprigs thrown in for the simmer, and the juice of half a lemon at the end to brighten things up. And I skipped the whipped cream, because that's just stupid. Crusty bread was the perfect accompaniment.

Fantastic! A rich and hearty soup. I think it would be just as good with a little milk or no cream or milk at all. I will definitely make it again.

I'm not really a soup person but I had some leeks sitting around and wasn't sure what to do with them. This soup was exceptional; however I omitted the potato because I didn't have one, and also didn't add parsley because I didn't have any. Those things aside, I loved it. I put some homemade garlic croutons (courtesy of Alton Brown--highly recommended) and the combination was excellent. I definitely will be making this again!

With 6.5 oz of leeks in the fridge I had to cut ingredients the best I could. . .and it still tasted great. Easy to make and a keeper for our family.

Delicious, absolutely delicious. Made exactly as called for except I used creme fraische instead of whipped cream, and I blended the soup in the pot with a hand blender. Easy! Served with warm french rolls and a salad as a main course. One of the best, will be a staple in our house from now on (creme d'asparagus soup on this site is another keeper).

This was wonderful. I only used 1 tsp butter to saute the vegetables to cut the fat content. I also did not use the cream (although I can imagine it would be a heavenly addition).

Prepared this soup as course #2 of a 7 course Valentines meal for 6. Overall result excellent. Certainly one of, if not the best leek soup I've had and my guests said the same. Prepared exactly as receipe calls for. At first I was confused about the quantity of leeks, whether 3 lbs was cut or uncut, and how big a medium leek was. So I used 9 leeks and they weighed 2 pounds after being cut. I was happy with the result. I prepared about 3 or 4 hours in advance -- just enough time to bring the soup down to about 35 degrees, and then reheat. Perhaps this was enough, because I frankly can't imagine it being any better with time. Served with heavy cream as suggested and the result was exactly what I had hoped for.

Wonderful soup. I used all stock like many of the reviewers here and the flavor was great. If serving for guests, I would use the whipped cream or creme fraiche but found that for my family we/it didnt' need the extra calories.

WOW! This was amazing. Prepared EXACTLY as described. At first when I was testing for seasoning I was a tad bit disappointed...but alas...once in a bowl with the fabulous whipped cream, it was wonderful.

Excellent soup! Perhaps reviewer named Quatfaux referred to soup as bland because of the pale coloring. He/she did say it was tasty... My 6 yr old and I loved it... so much so that she had a second bowl and asked for some in her lunch this morning. She never eats the same thing twice in a row. I didn't buy the right type of cream (for cooking instead of whipping) so I made a design in the soup with the cream. To add to the coloring (I had forgotten to buy fresh parsley for the soup), i sprinkled dried parsley on top and it added to the coloring. I have been requested to make some more today!

Rating: 4
quatfaux... Respectfully, I'd say go back and try it again!!! This one was exceptional and I've made it twice again since then... and my guests asked me for the recipe. Might add that as an American cook living in France and cooking for French people, that's a pretty good recommendation for a recipe!

It was fine, tasty, but nothing to either write home about or to make again. My entire family found it rather bland. It didn't excite us more the second day, either. The whipped cream was our favorite part, and we saved some for our coffee afterward.

The easiest part of my multi-course dinner, and everyone raved over this one the most! Definitely do ahead, definitely add crumbled blue. This is a great soup!

Really wonderful! The whipped cream at the end made a nice presentation (but you could go without it or just add unwhipped cream). Took another reviewer's advice (thanks!) and topped it with a little bit of roquefort crumbled on top. My guests looked unenthused about eating soup, but by the time they finished, they were all raving about it. Also toasted some strips of whole wheat/walnut bread until crisp to serve alongside. Yummy!

I made this for my girlfriend and myself and both of us absolutely LOVED it. Add lots of black pepper for a soup that's hearty, flavorful, filling, and still has some bite to it. Going out right now to buy more leeks for a big batch that I'm going to portion and freeze.

Delicious... I also skipped the cream.

Velvety smooth, complex flavor. Not too leeky as someone mentioned below. Definitely follow the directions and make at least 1 day before serving to allow the flavors to settle. Thought this soup was amazing - so did our guests. I took the advise to add crumbled blue on top, then I added leftover chopped parsley for color. I agree with another reviewer, that either way you add the cream would be good: whipped or stirred into the soup at the end. I'm pretty sad there aren't any leftovers, as I'd love to have another cup right now. Mmmmmm good.

A great master recipe for a french soup. I've also made it with pumpkin and butternut squash with fantastic results. I like to add a chopped apple to the squash/leeks and vary the spices to fit my menu, and since the cream isn't incorporated until serving time, freezing the soup is no problem.

Great, Easy, Flavorful soup! I used an immersion blender to puree and it worked fantastic. Sometimes you may have to strain after using an immersion blender, but with this soup it worked perfect. No straining required! Velvety smoooth.

I am a huge fan of creamy soups without the cream and this was no disappointment. I loved the complex flavor, and it actually lived up to the "velvety" claim. The hardest thing about the recipe was chopping and blending, and that's not too bad! This is a keeper.

i actually thought this was kind of bland. i think that there are too many leeks so you don't even taste the other veggies whatsoever. next time i'd cut down on the amount of leeks and add more carrot and probably more spices.

This is the most delicious leek soup I've ever made. And considering I lived in France, where leek soup is a stapple each autumn, this is a lot to say. It's already rich enough without the cream. Next time, I'll skip it fur us or add a tiny bit (1 teaspon) if I serve it to guests, just to add that touch of elegance.

I made this recipe for my family and they couldn't get enough of it. The first bite was "this is good" and by the third it was "this is really REALLY good" The only change I made was using salted butter. Do whip the cream as it really adds to the presentation and differing textures. Very easy but remember if you use a blender (I used a food processor) "stand" on the lid so you won't have hot soup on you and the ceiling.

Absolutely delicious! I did not whip the cream, instead I simply added it before pureeing and it worked great. We ate it immediately rather than waiting, but I have plenty left over so I will taste it after it sits in the fridge a while and see if it is really better.

Wow- so elegant and tasty! Felt like dining in a fine restaurant. Pureeing is a must. I added extra pasley, which was delicious- kept it 'alive' tasting. Whipped cream on top, while pretty, added nothing in flavor. Literally- could hardly taste it next to the exquisite soup. I would much prefer creme fraiche. I made this 2 days ahead, and it was delicious.
