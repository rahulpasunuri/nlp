This is an amazing dessert! Every time I make, everyone has to know all ab out it, the recipe, the procedure, the ingredients. That said, I do not do the oranges step. Also, since we don't eat grains, I substituted almond flour for the wheat flour and they still came out beautifully. The cracker step that called for the dough to be frozen is unnecessary. I usually take it straight from the bowl to a piece of parchment paper. Cover the lump with another piece of parchment paper and roll it out to the size of the 9 x 13 cookie sheet. Pull the top layer off the bottom and presto, you have cracker stuff on two sheets. Forget scoring it, as broken angles look a lot more fun and it'll break around the toffee pieces anyway, though sometimes I can cut through them with scissors. I just serve mine in the cups I froze it in.

If you do not know what else but bred & butter works to let a particularly great honney reach the pallate, this is just the thing! Perfect! Spectacular recipe... Easy too. I did not make the wafers - puled the toffee to add crackling interest to the dewy [Hic!] semifredo. Had peeled plums in sirrup as garnish instead of orange... The sum total worked rather well (cannot ompare with the original, as I have not done it to the letter). Intend to make the wafers separately. And next time, there will be stuffed dates next to honneyed semifredo [dates, stuffed with almond paste, encased in cracking melted suggar - a memory from the south of Spain]. All in all, this my top honney desert right now, and I suspect it will hold its rank for a long, long whie.

The clean honey taste is a hoot! I got lucky this autumn to get some particularly flagrant honey [easy down here] and this was the only recipe I had the heart to used it for, as the sum total flavor of the desert is mostly about the honey. As hoped, it did honey justice, and even how... For a change, I did not do the wafers, pulled the toffee in strings as a crackling accessory to the dewy [Hic!] semifreddo. Quite effective. Now, those wafers are quite tempting to try on their own (with caramelized, chopped walnuts, say). Seeing in believing...
