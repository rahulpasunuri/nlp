Loved most of the recipe. Pericatelli is not as good as spaghetti. It's thickness makes it harder to handle and the hole in the middle adds nothing but trouble. Stick with Spaghetti. I also endorse making the meatballs a day ahead of time. Otherwise, timing becomes more complex.

I don't think people believe it a mediocre recipe or even a template. I think that we all believe it it good--we just have different tastes. If everyone had the same tastes then all recipes would get the same ratings, exactly, from each of us, and no one would recommend any changes to any recipe. In this instance, some people have a taste for more this or less that, so they recommend more this or less that to suit their tastes. That's all. And just because someone says "Use less of X' and someone else says "use more of Y" doesn't mean that the recipe needs both less X and more Y. Just that those people found it more to their tastes if they did those things. And some recommendations are just cool ideas. Baking the meatballs doesn't make them better, but it does mean you can cook them all up at once rather than in batches. So, I'm afraid, I very much disagree with those who take these suggestions and see in them either people patting themselves on the back for creating a new recipe or people viewing this recipe as a template and not a real recipe to follow. People are doing what I see people do in every, single recipe--making suggestions to suit their own tastes and maybe suit yours...or not. That the recipe allows this without losing its integrity or essential flavor--namely mushrooms and rosemary--speaks well of it. It deserves its high rating for its flexibility and the fact that it inspires people to play with it.

It's a shame that such a mediocre recipe, in some opinions, receives such high ratings based on making such gratuitous changes that it no longer even resembles the original recipe. To then award it 4 stars is likened to patting oneself on the back and saying "good job!" With that said, I have made this recipe dozens of times over the years and the only two changes I ever make is to use 2- 3 English muffins (because it is difficult to find English muffin bread) and to use spaghetti in place of perciatelli (because it is just more readily availalble, even though perciatelli is more fun). My meatballs always come out moist, fluffy and delicious, and fare well with the well balanced, flavorful sauce. I have received many compliments and requests for the recipe over the years. I am willing to take into consideration some of the more constructive suggestions, but to deviate away from the original version so completely is tantamount to writing one's own recipe. Rating and commenting on recipes should be a sharing experience, not an opportunity to flaunt one's self ascribed abilities, in my opinion.

As can be seen from the addendums, this recipe is more of a primer to terrific meatballs than a perfect recipe as is. Like many here, adjusting the recipe is what gave me the best meatball recipe ever as compared to following the recipe slavishly. I came to the same conclusions as many here, including that the recipe works better if one cuts down the eggs to 2, the milk to one-and-a-half- cups, the bread down to one, or one-and-a-half muffin and, my own recommendation, the parmesan down to 1/3. I also tend to up the meat to a 1lb beef and 1lb sausage. It's only 1/4 more but it makes a difference. Following the recipe as written, my meatballs came out too soft and easily fell apart. With the above changes, they held together and had a heartier flavor. Baking is a great idea. It speeds things up as you can make all the meatballs at once in the oven. It also cuts clean-up if you line the sheets. One other idea, the recipe calls only for dried porcini mushrooms, but I like to use 1oz dried porcini and 1oz mixed dried mushrooms. It doesn't change the texture or flavor of the meatballs or sauce all that much, but it is fun and flavorful to have a melange of mushrooms.

This recipe makes a marvelously good spaghetti and meatballs, but you only need one extra-large muffin (less bread), and I use regular ground beef rather an veal. I also like to saute fresh mushrooms with the onion in the sauce to make the sauce even more mushroomy. Make sauce and meatballs a day ahead of time as, like all good sauces, it become more flavorful overnight. this also means that you've only to heat it up and serve over the spaghetti when dinner time rolls around.

This is an excellent recipe. My husband is 100% Italian--although born in southern CA--and this recipe has become the standard in our house. We don't use pericatelli because he's a mostaciolli guy, but everything else is right on. When he makes the meatballs they always stay intact. The only problem with this recipe since it was first published in BA is that it's become harder and harder to find english muffin bread. We've substituted slices of hearty breads of various kinds, including La Brea Bakery Olive Oil Rosemary.

I made the recipe as written except, based on reviews, I used half the amount of milk called for and I did bake the meatballs rather than fry them. They were dense,moist and did not fall apart. Overall I thought both the sauce and meatballs had and 'odd/off' flavor. Maybe it's the porcini? I just can't put my finger on it. I made the sauce only once before and didn't care for it but the meatballs and reviews sounded good so I thought I'd try again.

I think the Italian sausage overwhelmed the delicacy of the ground veal. I think I would use beef if I make this recipe again. Also, I think using the porcini mushrooms is overkill and too expensive.

Wonderful recipe...I made this for my mother-in- law's birthday and she was thrilled. I used the ground turkey & sausage that another reviewer suggested with great results. My meat mixture was pretty runny even though I reduced the milk to 1 1/2 cups and the eggs down to 2. So, luckily I had some fresh bread crumbs on hand and I added those. Also, as per another reviewer, I baked my meatballs on a cookie sheet. I lined mine with parchment paper and baked at 350 for 17 minutes. Since I didn't use beef, there wasn't much grease. The meatballs came out flavorful and tender. The sauce was easy to make. This recipe is a keeper! My five year old declared this "delicious mommy!" and my 70 year old mother-in-law was happy, what more could you ask for? :-D

I have made this recipe several times and it is a favorite. The one problem I have had is that my meatballs always fall apart during both the browning and the cooking with the sauce. They seem to be too moist. This is not too much of a problem because the taste is excellent and you still get small pieces of meatball. This time I reduced the eggs to two and used 1/2 cup less milk. I also reduced the size of the meatballs to 1 1/4 in. I realized I had been making them too big--2-3 in. All these things helped. This is a great recipe.

I have been making this recipe for over 10 years and I still love it. I have had die-hard Italians rave over my sauce and the meatballs are so flavorful and delicious. I make the recipe as stated and it's perfect. I use angel hair pasta because I prefer it. The meatballs and sauce can be frozen and they are just as good defrosted. Enjoy!

This recipe is fabulous! The meatballs are excellent.I used a differnet knid of dried mushroom(Trompettes de Mort)because I had them on hand, and they were fine. Froze some of the meatballs, and they were great defrosted as well. My sister served these at her restaurant to rave reviews.

The sauce was great but the meatballs were more like meat saucers. I made the meatball recipe exactly as described. The mixture came out very moist and difficult to work with. I had to add more meat to stiffen it up. Would recommend starting with less bread and egg. You can always add more as you need. The end result was quite tasty.

This recipe is awesome. Not a big fan of Rosemary so I substituted oregano. Didn't find it that complicated and the sauce was DELICIOUS! Used a mixture of ground pork,veal,beef instead of just veal. Definitely will make it again.

These are the best meatballs I ever had. Ever. In addition to being delicious they are so unique that they will surely be a significant part of your dinner party conversation. The mix of meats and sausage is great. The rosemary is wonderful. And the english muffins give the meatballs nice firmness and texture. I wouldn't change a thing. Oh, and the sauce was great too.

I follow this recipe exactly, and it has never failed to please. It is time consuming, and cooking the meatballs in oil can be messy, but still worth the effort. I love rosemary, and this is a great recipe to use the rosemary I have growing in my house.

I didn't rate this recipe because I only made the sauce and it seems the meatballs are the big hit. The sauce is okay but there are better ones out there. The porcini mushrooms add a nice twist but not worth a repeat. I had premade meatballs in my freezer that I wanted to use up. I really don't like going through all the work to prepare meatballs - and I REALLY do love to cook!!

I have made this recipe several times, it is an all time favourite of friends and family. Instead of adding just the cheese to the meat balls, I make up some pesto and add it too the mixture. I also added some chipotle chili peppers with adobe sauce for some added spice. As other cooks have mentioned, I also bake the meatballs. Mmmmmm....

I'm glad I read the other comments, and avoided a bland meal. I spiced it up with cumin and cayenne. Added a Habanero in which I ran a fork through it (to the sauce.) And used broiled shrimp instead of the meatballs. Some Parm. cheese freshly grated at the end. It was awesome!

Fantastic and easy to make. These meatballs consistently get raves from friends & family. If dried porcini mushrooms are not available, dried shiitaki mushrooms work fine as a substitute.

These meatballs are wonderful with these substitutions: I used lean ground beef instead of veal, and only 1 egg. I also added a bit of garlic powder. As another cook suggested, I baked the meatballs instead of frying them in olive oil. I made my own sauce omitting rosemary.

Awesome as is! Although, we baked the meatballs on a wire rack on a cookie sheet instead of frying them. The sauce was not runny - we used Cento crushed tomatos and it was very thick. The mushrooms were awesome and we loved the simplicity of the sauce -- just rosemary instead of the usual mishmash of "italian" spices.

For great meatballs, pulse your bread in the food processor & remove. Put some mushrooms (I like portabellos) into the processor w/ some onion and fresh garlic. Pulse this up and add to bowl w/ bread, egg, milk, etc... . I don't think you need so much milk and egg. Add a small sprinkle of dried, crushed rosemary, salt, pepper & maybe a small sprinkle of dried Italian spice. I also use Very low-fat "Maverick" ground beef(only about 4 grms. fat per serving). Also, Bake them in oven @ about 350, for 10-12 minutes (saves on fat, and the meatballs retain their shape & don't turn into little SQUARES when you try to turn them in the frying pan! After all they are meatBALLS- not meatSQUARES!!). Yum!

these were the best meatballs i ever had. we made them with ground beef because that was what we had on hand. it was the porcini mushrooms that make the difference.

The sauce was much too runny. I added some sun dried tomatoes to it and that helped the consistancy and improved the flavor. Then I added some oregeno and it was better; however, by that time, it was more my recipe than theirs. The meat balls were satisfactory...not great.

Not a bad meatball recipe. Substituted ground beef for veal (personal preference)and grated one yellow onion. Omitted the rosemary for oregano and only used 1 egg. Overall it depends on the kind of sausage one uses and its quality! Also, a good pinch of hot red pepper/cayenne added a nice zip!

FOr my Italian and food loving family, this has become a standard! The meatballs are ranked the best they've ever had, so go ahead and give this a try. It'll be worth it. If the porcini in the sauce put you off, I've made it without and it turns out equally wonderful.

I was disappointed in the meatball recipe. I definitely think the rosemary added a strange flavor to them meatballs - I think I'll just stick with good old parsley. I also think there were too many eggs - one or two at the most will do. Lastly, I think there was too much sausage flavor. Although I liked the flavor it added, I felt like I was eating sausage rather than a meatball. I do have to say, though that I liked the texture of the English Muffin rather than white bread or bread crumbs. If anyone knows where I can find a great meatball recipe, let me know where to find it - I'm in search of the perfect meatball!

This recipe had a great flavour. I hate cooking the meatballs this way but the taste was the payoff. Living in Australia, veal mince and sausages were cheaper than beef mince, thus it was all the better for it. The sauce needs work, but I'll make it again regardless.

Great dish! I make the meatballs with beef or pork instead of veal -- still very good. Perciatelli is a little challenging to eat, however. If it's cooked properly (al dente), it's very difficult to get it twirled on your fork. Don't wear white while eating this dish!
