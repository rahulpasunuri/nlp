A fresh combination of flavors, savory sweet with wild carroty appeal. Used chicken broth. Added bay leaves and thyme, also 1/2 c white wine just after rice was added. added herbs and S&P gradually throughout stirring process. Worth making again, perhaps with chicken or lake fish.

I used these ingredients to make a risotto per Barbara Kafka's microwave instructions (Microwave Gourmet). Don't know if this entitles me to actually enter a review but it was delicious. Loved the sweetness of the parsnips.

It was my first time making Risotto, and it came out exceptionally. I followed the directions and used 8 cups of broth, which at first I thought was a lot, but then I learned that Risotto is supposed to be very creamy. The flavor is light but rich, and the balsamic vinegar adds a zesty sweetness.

Pretty dull. It definitely needed the balsamic to add some flavor.

I had the same issue as stephmartin and jilbait - too much broth led to a horrifying texture. The flavor of the risotto was fantastic (and my Thanksgiving guests gobbled it up despite my embarrassment), but some definite chemistry adjustments are necessary!

I really like parsnips and I am in LOVE with just about any kind of risotto sooo I was excited about making this for a pre-thanksgiving meal. I am so glad it was just me and my boys as this was about the biggest disaster I've ever had on the stove. I make risotto about once every two weeks so I think I know what I'm doing. I'm not going to blame myself for this calamity. The parsnips started to burn on the bottom of my saucepan almost immediately. I compensated by turning down the heat which resulted in a dish which took twice the time and the parsnips burned anyway. The texture was, and I quote my son "disgusting and lumpy". Be wary of this dish!!!

Made this for my monthly cooking/knitting potluck. Even the "I don't think I like parsnips" people loved it! Made it to the recipe, except for using less rosemary (3t) and less butter (4T). I think the butter could be cut another tablespoon and it wouldn't suffer. Leftovers are tasty cold, too!

I'm not big on root vegitables, but this was really good. Served for company and everyone loved it.

Delicious. I loved this. Great texture and taste. I cut the recipe in half. Rob liked it but not as much as I did.

Loved this, but I can only review it with the changes I made. Couldn't run out to get a few things because I was waiting for a phone call that never came, so I had to substitute for what was on hand. I used brown rice instead of Aborio which may have taken longer to cook as it certainly took longer than the recipe said it would but which was maybe a happy accident because is it was delicious and healthy. Also had to use chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, but will make it with vegetable broth next time. I added mushrooms as per another reviewer which I sauteed with the onions, substituted olive oil for part of the butter, and - this is key and will do every time - substituted dry white wine for at least a third of the liquid. I didn't add the rosemary at the end because I find rosemary "raw" to have a bitter taste. I also salted and peppered throughout, tasting as I went rather than at the end. This is a wonderful dish and as I will be making it for a crowd of 20 in September, I was thrilled that the test run came out so beautifully. Excellent!

Wonderful recipe! I think I might have used too much parsnip than it called for, but it still turned out delicious. I think I might prefer it without the balsamic vinegar on top.

I didn't include rosemary and didn't peel the parsnips (which might have been the reason for a slightly bitter taste), but neither of those had to do with my real problem with this recipe: WAY too much broth. The recipe on my rice box had half as much, which seems like it'd be much more appropriate - my rice stopped absorbing at around 4 or 5 cups. I found that this was much better when cream was added at the end (maybe half a cup). Also, it's delicious when topped with extra parmesan and broiled for a few minutes.

OK just had to share one more huge success. It has been a number of years since I made risotto, and I only had Trader's Joe's vegetable broth concentrate packets around the house, but it turned out to be a huge success. Maybe the TJ's packets were the key? They are these little tubes with a shot of concentrated veg broth that you add water to....I had to tear open 8 of these little buggers and add 8 cups of hot water. It makes a pretty savory broth...darker and more strong than your typical broth from the can or box. I was also intimidated by the parsnips. It takes some time to chop them up. My fiance kept wondering if maybe I was in over my head, what with the veggie broth boiling, and all the parsnip cubes. I also was worried about over-processing the onion...you know when you overdo it in the food processor and you end up with an almost onion "soup"...strangely enough I think that also may have been a factor that made for a very smooth and delicious risotto. This cooked a lot faster than I thought...I just had to keep tasting the risotto while cooking until I got it right. I have to say I am new fan now of parsnips! The taste is like a cross between cauliflower and potato in flavor. Very mild and sweet and creamy. A huge hit, even with my fiance, who claims to not like anything with rice. I will definitely be making this again! I ate it for dinner and then for lunch for 2 more days and it just kept getting better.

I've made this three times so far. It is now what I make one or two days after roasting a whole chicken in the crock pot. I make chicken broth in the crock pot overnight and use it the next day in risotto. The first time was the best - followed the recipe exactly except for adding some cream at the end with the parmesan. The second time didn't have parsnips, it was good but not as good. Last night I used a lot less parmesan because my H kept saying he doesn't really like a lot of parmesan cheese. We had it with filet mignon and asparagus. He liked it better the first time with the correct amount of parmesan! It wasn't until after dinner that I noticed for the first time that balsamic vinegar is called for! Next time I will use the right amount of parm, I will try using half EVOO instead of butter, I will have cream on hand and I won't forget the balsamic!

This was so absolutely delicious I had to have seconds! I followed the recipe exactly and would not change a thing. This will definitely become a regular feature in my cooking repretoire. We served it with sirloin and grilled asparagus.

Really delicious -- but it does help to follow the recipe for the most part. You could cut the butter in half and replace with olive oil, easily. The first time I made this I realized (belatedly) that I was out of arborio -- substituted orzo, which worked out very well (made in effect an orzo risotto). Fresh rosemary makes all the difference. I've skipped the vinegar with no ill effects.

Used olive oil instead of butter, dried rosemary, ementhal and goat's cheese and normal balsamic. I couldn't finish it. Edible just. Yuk.

This was very good and relatively easy. Making do with the supplies I had, I substituted turnips and a smaller amount of crushed dried rosemary for the fresh, both of which woked fine. I used homemade vegetable stock, unfortunately having made risotto many times I didn't keep track of the amount of stock or cooking time. Served with roast chicken, guests found it an impressive side dish.

In addition to the ingredients given I added one carrot, a few button mushrooms and substituted red onion (about 1/2 C) for the white to add a bit of color. I remembered from past experience that parsnips can be a bit sweet that is why I included some mushrooms to add an earthiness. It turned out fabulous. If it gets a little old in this form I may make risotto balls and stuff a piece of chicken into the middle or make risotto cakes and fry them up with some panko crumbs.

This delicious Risotto was a lovely addition to both Salmon and Chicken. Dicing the parsnips and using fresh Rosemary from a friend's garden made it an unusual and yummy addition to our party dinner menu and one that I will be using again soon.

I made this for Easter dinner and served it with leg of lamb. It was really very, very delicious. We love to have parsnips with lamb and this was a nice change of pace from the roasted parsnips that we usually have. I had to add about one more cup of stock than called for in the recipe and this required about 10 extra minutes of cooking.

I really enjoyed this. I am always looking for a new way to serve rice and this was excellent. Parsnips can have an overwhelming flavor so I reduced the parsnips by half and diced them very finely so that by the time the risotto finished cooking, they were indistinguishable in appearance from the rice but they imparted a delicious flavor. I think the vegetable broth can make a big difference. Get a good quality broth with some tomato in it.

This was my first experience with parsnips as well as risotto. It was not difficult, and we all enjoyed the taste of the parsnips. The dish had a flavor reminiscent of the winter holiday meals.
