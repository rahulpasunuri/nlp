These eggs are Devine! I had a brunch and each guest ate five eggs. Even the skinniest girl there. I served it with homemade hummus and tabouli. Every time I make this meal the crowd goes wild! The homemade hummus is very time consuming but so worth it, do a day ahead for better flavoring?

Wasn't sure how the ingredients/flavors would all work together, but they did! It was delicious and unusual. Unfortunately I did not have fresh sage on hand, so I used a bit of dried. Yet, the herb flavor still came through.

This was such a delicious lunch in the fall with fresh sage from the garden. Can hardly wait to try it again with olive oil as suggested by a previous reviewer.

Well, I finally gave in to "health" and tried this dish with olive oil instead of butter. I was apprehensive because I love the butter (who doesn't?) but I'm here to tell you it is just as FANTASTIC with olive oil - maybe even better because it is not as heavy and the olive oil adds a nice flavor (if you use a high quality oil.) Yes, another year has passed and I am still making this dish! Now that I've modified it to make it healthier I will eat it more often with less guilt. A side of a few slices of raw cucumber and tomato goes nicely with these flavors.

I had my apprehensions about this dish when I saw it, as I couldn't imagine how the eggs and yogurt would complement each other. I'm certainly glad I gave it a shot anyway, because it was delicious. I will definitely make this again.

This gets four stars from me as it is yummy - great combo of flavours - and very quick. Start to finish 5 mins. I use greek yougurt and follow recipe except for the sage leaves in butter. IMO its a waste to take butter off heat just sizzling. Keep going and fry up those sage leaves untill crisp. I usually double sage leaves as we love to eat them.

I think this is fantastic. The first time I made it was over a year ago and it has remained an absolute favorite. I get authentic Greek yogurt from the organic grocery store, and chop up a pretty good little amount of raw garlic. Personally, I do not like poached eggs, so I fry the eggs and leave them loose - over easy to over medium. YUM! I don't think I will ever tire of the wonderful flavors of this dish.

This was great! Some of my favorite flavors. Plus it's so easy. My partner loved it (he was sceptical at first). Warm pita is a must. Note: as I cannot ingest raw garlic I sauteed it in a little olive oil before adding it to the yogurt. Worked fine. This will becme a staple "quick weekend supper" meal.

we love this recipie and have made it several times. i suspect it would work as well with olive oil substituted for the butter, which would be more heart-healthy.

great brunch. great flavors. have made it with vanilla yogurt a few times as well. any ratio/combination of spices that you have around seems to accomplish most of the special tastes. it lead my girlfriend towards becoming my wife.

We've made this recipe half a dozen times, and love it. It's an ideal breakfast on a cold weekend morning. Substitute chicken for the eggs and have it for dinner.
