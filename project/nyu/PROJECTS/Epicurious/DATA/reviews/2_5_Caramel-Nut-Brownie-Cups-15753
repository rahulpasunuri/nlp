Disaster for me too. Huge pain in the neck, and not very tasty in the end. I like the idea of the Dulce de Leche substitute, but I have so many brownie recipes that are so much better that this one might never surface again. :(

DISASTER. I completely recommend against this recipe. The repeated chilling of the dough is ridiculous for the end result of a brownie. And that caramel was a nightmare--it kept hardening and was very difficult to work with to fill the cups. Then, when served several hours later, the caramel was hard as a rock. Everyone was making funny faces as they struggled not to crack a tooth on it. I'd never, ever make again.

Tasty, pretty, easy-to-eat bites for a party. I made the brownie exactly as called for, except that I wasn't obsessive about grinding the nuts so fine. However, I cheated and used a high-quality dulce de leche (a nice thick goat's milk variety) to spoon into the cups instead of making my own caramel. I also sprinkled on the nuts before baking the cups. They were tiny and lovely--very good.

These were delicious. The caramel was a "pain" to make it does harden easily, but once baked in the cakes, its great.

The taste and presentation were both good, however, the caramel became too hard, it turned out like a Big Daddy. I may try again and see if I can get the caramel to a softer consistency.
