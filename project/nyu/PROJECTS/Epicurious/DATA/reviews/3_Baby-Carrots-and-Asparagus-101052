visually nice combo although I prefer steaming...sometimes it is refreshing for vegetables to taste like vegetables!

If this is a recipe, then I should write a cookbook. It'd be called, The Uninspired Cook. I mean, really, I come here for ideas to get away from simply throwing some butter on the veggies...

Steam the veges and add 2TB maple syrup. Easy and a touch of sweetness.

This was a simply elegant and colorful dish. I served it with baked t-bone steaks and smothered summer squash. It was delicious!

Nothing special, but then I guess one could tell that by the ingredients. Maybe add a little lemon juice. I steamed the vegies.

What "recipe" are you people reviewing! Cooked carrots? That warrants comments? You liked the idea of adding them to boiled water? You liked the lack of a single herb or spice in the recipe? Let me guess...back to basics?

Nothing special - the glaze didn't add much taste

I followed the earlier suggestions and did all the work ahead and just warmed everything at the end. Worked great. Also added the shallots. Very good and simple. Good side dish for the Roast Leg of Lamb with Olive and Rosemary Paste recipe.

To streamline preparation with the rest of the meal, I prepared both the vegetables ahead and chilled. I also sauted a minced shallot in the butter and set it aside. Just before serving I warmed both in microwave and poured butter mixture over veggies. Then sprinkled with chopped fresh cilantro. Excellent side dish with Lamb.

I, too, added sugar snap peas, sauteed red onions and dill. Several people had seconds!

Simple and pretty. Saute a minced shallot in the butter before tossing with the veggies. Also, good with sugar snap peas and baby carrots.
