I've made these sweet potatoes for several years now. They're delicious if you prefer non-cloying sweet potato recipes. I'm not a big fan of the candied or marshmallow variety! One thing I did notice, there is no salt called for in either the topping or the mash. I have always added a bit of salt - lets face it, even if you are making something as sweet as a cake or cookies, salt is included. It does't make it taste salty it just brings out a ton more natural flavor...which could be the reason some reviewers think there isn't enough flavor the way this recipe is written. Try it with a pinch of salt and taste as you go. Also, I just made them now for Thursday. It says only a day before but I always make the mash and the topping on Tuesday and keep them separate till I put them in the oven Thursday. I'm a caterer and like to get as much done in advance as possible! They're delicious! Plus I think the extra time helps the flavors develop.

I've made this several times for holiday meals and its always been a hit. The recipe is easy, doesn't have too much stuff to inhibit the yam flavor, and the streusel makes a nice crunch. As is my way, I always adapt, so I usually use pecans instead of almonds, and even better, carmelized pecans with a little cayenne in the pecan sugar mix. YUM!

Here I am at 11:45 at night trying to find this wonderful recipe. I make this every year for Thanksgiving. The orange flavor adds such a great taste. Even our kids who do not like sweet potatoes love this dish. By the way, the website is great. All my holiday dishes come from Bon Appetit. I am a fan.

This was a terrific recipe although after reading some of the reviews I would agree that cinnamon or even allspice would have been a good add in the streusel. Perhaps a few marshmallows too. Overall though it was a hit with my husband and a definate do it again.

This is a Thanksgiving Dinner winner every year!

I doctored the streusel a bit by adding a handful of oatmeal to it. I also added cinnamon to the puree. It was delicious. Thanksgiving isn't complete without this sweet potato dish.

This was good, but like the previous reviewers stated, the streusal needs doctoring up. I used extra paprika and extra brown sugar. Although I doubled the recipe for Thanksgiving, I didn't need to double the topping and I threw a lot out unfortunately.

I had to add ALOT more Sweet Paprika and brown sugar in the topping/struesal to get any sort of flavor. (We like lots of flavor!!!)Definately use fresh orange juice!!!And you can add small marshmellows on top of half for your little ones too!!

Delicious! The spicy paprika offsets the sweetness of a normal streusel. Not your typical marshmallow and sweet potato casserole. Much more lively and flavorful!

I made it for Thanksgiving. It made an nice addition. Nothing spectacular, but it was yummy.

I love the orange flavor with the sweet potatoes. I now routinely mash my sweet potatoes with orange juice. The streusel topping is a nice bonus. A friend brought this to my house for Thanksgiving and it was devoured by adults and kids alike. It's the kind of recipe where people say "oh I don't really like sweet potatoes" and I just tell them "try it, you'll like it!" (and they do) I think it is plenty orange-y, and I did use dried orange peel and good paprika - perhaps the reviewers that didn't think it had enough flavor had old spices.

I made this ahead of time and it was almost too easy to just spinkle on the streusel and pop it in the oven! My guests really liked it. I added just a little more brown sugar and it was just right. It was a pleasant change from my traditional yams with mandarin oranges and marshmellows.

I was really disappointed with this recipe. It was a nice presentation but the taste just wasn't there. It was lacking in flavor and not as rich or savory as I had hoped.

I tried this recipe for a dinner I prepared for my father and one of his friends. It received much praise - especially from my dad who's the world's pickiest person when it comes to trying to convince someone to sample a new dish! The orange added a nice zest, the paprika a surprisingly good flare....I might add more streusel the next time around since there didn't seem to be enough when I first prepared it. Other than that - YUM!

It was OK. I didn't think that the orange juice or rind added much to it.

I used pecans instead of almonds (emergency substitution) but I also expected more orange flavor in the potatoes so I added some orange juice concentrate. They were good but I'll probably go back to my old recipe (also Bon Appetit and listed on this site) which has alternating slices of sweet potatoes and granny smiths. Those are truly fabulous!

My wife made it for thanksgiving and it was great. Would we have it again? Yes, we already have, last week.

This was a great holiday side dish to serve. I think the streusel makes the presentation lovely. The orange zest definitely adds a freshness to the taste of the dish. I think that this will be a holiday staple for me going forward.

Delicious and easy, everybody at my Thanksgiving table liked this dish. A welcome alternative to the brown-sugar-and-marshmallow standard, plus you can make it the day before. This will likely become a holiday standard for me.

This recipe was incredible and so easy to make. I heard a comment that it could have been desert! I loved the fact too that it could be made ahead of time. Try it!! I did leave out the Hungarian Paprika... don't know if it changed anything...

Awesome dish! I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the puree and used pecans instead of almonds. It was the talk of Thanksgiving dinner!

Wonderful flavor, very easy to make. My family and friends loved the topping and the flavor of orange really worked well with this dish.

The best sweet potato recipe we've ever tried! This will become a family Thanksgiving staple.

The flavor of the puree was very good, and maybe I goofed it up by doubling the recipe and putting it in too large a dish, but the topping just wasn't as amazing as I thought it'd be. It was nice to have a sweet potato dish that wasn't so cloyingly sweet, but there was something missing. Again, maybe the doubling is where things went wrong...

This was a big hit with a picky Thanksgiving Day crowd!!

This was the first Thanksgiving dish I ever made. I am 8 years old. It turned out very well, with the sweet potatoes and the topping. I added some sliced almonds to the topping, too. My dad, who isn't a fan of sweet potatoes, actually ate a lot of it!

The potatoes were delicious but the topping just didn't work. I would not make this again.
