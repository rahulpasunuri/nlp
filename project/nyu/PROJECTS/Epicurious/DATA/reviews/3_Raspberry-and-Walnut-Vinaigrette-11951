Excellent! Although I didn't have any tarragon. I also used honey and mustard since I didn't have honey-mustard. I used it on a mixed green with dried cranberry, blue cheese and candied pecan salad. The roasted walnut oil flavor was prominent in just the right amount.

Served this dressing over salad of spinach, dried cranberries, finely chopped red onion, slices of red delicious apple, topped with roasted pecans. Very tasty. Left out tarragon, didn't feel it was appropriate for this salad combination. Very nice presentation with the reds!
