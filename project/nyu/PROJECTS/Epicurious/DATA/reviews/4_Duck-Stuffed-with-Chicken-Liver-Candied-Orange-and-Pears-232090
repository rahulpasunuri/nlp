This was quite delicious. I did make a few alterations however. I used duck pate in place of the liver, and added a few cornbread crumbs and dried cranberries to the stuffing. I also added a cup or so of red wine to the drippings and reduced the sauce a little. Served with a truffled polenta, and broccoli rabe this was an excellent supper.

After getting theses babies into the oven I remembered advice about never stuffing a duck because of the grease factor. Wrong - delightful recipe, delicious results. Added a chopped toasted pita to the dressing - seemed a bit heavy to me. As usual, 2 ducks for 4 people. Use excess shreds for ducklava or duck tacos.

A great success. I added breadcrumbs from a stale loaf of raisin walnut bread to the stuffing.

Wonderful!! I was curious how the flavors of the stuffing would pair when I decided to make two ducks for New Year's dinner last year, but the combination was wonderful. The scent of the cooking garlic, sage and liver was an appetite stimulant. Eating later that day was a wondrful fulfilment of my anticipation. I would reccomend preparing the candied orange slices ahead of time. Both times I made oranges and duck the same day and find that it is a bit much all at once. Well worth the wait, but an earlier start is a good idea.
