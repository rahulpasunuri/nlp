This is a great recipe and easy to follow, the flavors from the ingredients make this meal very tasty and satisfying. An easy to prep meal, and enjoy the compliments from the family. I marinated the steak for about 2 hours with an mixture of Olive oil, chopped jalapeno peppers, chushed red peppers, minced garlic and a bay leaf. After frying the steak, I cut it up in bite size pieces. To accompany the tacos I used Canned Black Beans, and added half a chopped onion, 2 minced jalapenos, (we leave the seeds in), minced garlic & chopped cilantro. A great meal if you like southweatern spices.

This was decent, but nothing spectacular. I found it needed some embellishing a bit at the end to make it more palatable..more herbs and spices, lots of salt and pepper, etc. I would add fresh garlic to the sauteed veggies for extra flavor. The dish comes together quickly, but there's quite a bit of time and work involved with the prep, so I didn't find this to be as "weeknight friendly" as I had hoped. These are very much like fajitas, and in light of that, I probably won't be making these again since I already have a fajita recipe that I love, although I do admit the addition of corn was a nice touch. This did taste better reheated the next day after the flavors had time to intermingle (the mixture tastes good over rice too), but overall, I found this recipe to be unexciting.

Use skirt steak, much better than flank. I have made this one many times, it's closer in spirit to fajitas than tacos. Easy and tasty. The fresh jalapeno is very important but I seed it. Cilantro is optional especially if you use a fresh style salsa that uses it as an ingredient.

I used rib-eye steak as someone suggested. Made a few modifications and it was great!

These have become a family favorite!! Be sure to keep the corn, I also add black beans. We wrap these in flour tortillas and top it with a Chipotle Sauce: 1/2 c sour cream; 1/2 cup mayonnaise; add chopped chipotles with adobe sauce to taste. We can't get enough of these!!

Great recipe...make sure to keep the corn in! The lemon juice and worcestershire sauce are good additions.

This recipe is very easy and it tastes delicious. My husband and I make this when we get bored of our usual fajitas. I serve the tacos with sour cream, fresh salsa, black beans and rice and plenty of margaritas!
