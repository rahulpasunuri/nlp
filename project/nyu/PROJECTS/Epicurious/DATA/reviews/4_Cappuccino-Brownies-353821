I love this recipe. It was so easy. I cut the sugar by a half cup because i didn't want them to be super sweet. They came out more cake- like than fudgey but the were still very yummy. Love the subtle espresso and cinnamon flavors. Also, i didn't have white chocolate so i just used semi sweet chips for the ganache and it turned out perfect.

I made these as part of my holiday baking treats for work and friends. A major hit, especially with my boss. I love the coffee essence and the rich ganache. Best when served in little bite sizes...I find the tray empties fast that way. I will make these again, definitely.

These are good "2 fork" brownies, (there is nothing wrong with them), but they are not exceptional.

I have made this recipe twice, with great results. Good twist on the traditional brownie.

I made these with white fluffy frosting to give it more of a foam appearance and I think it is easier than dealing with the ganache. Everyone that has tried them liked them, including the six judges at this years California State Fair. I won the Best of Show with them.

Hands down the best brownies I've ever had. Everyone loved them, even my husband who prefers a cakey texture (these are fudgy) and I've had several requests for the recipe. One thing to beware of, though it doesn't affect the taste - I used a Ghirardelli white chocolate bar and the result was more yellowish in color and soft, like icing rather than ganache. Make sure you keep them refrigerated or it gets runny.

FANTASTIC. Even the chocolate haters in my family raved about them. I made mine in a 9x9" tin and got slightly thinner but very moist brownies. I've been receiving requests for another batch since the last brownie was devoured!

these have GREAT flavor, and actually pretty gooey in texture. the ganache doesn't really harden, it's more like icing. still, very good...rich.

I enjoyed this recipe very much and it was a hit. It's really important that you closely read the instructions to this recipe. It states "Bake brownies until puffed and dry-looking and tester inserted into center comes out with some moist batter attached, about 35 minutes;" If you do that,you'll have delicious brownies with no baking issues whatsoever.

OK, but not fantastic. The Fudgy Cappuccino Brownies from Bon Appetit Sept 1995 are better. Thought the cooking time was off - had to add 15 minutes, and even burnt my elbow checking my oven thermometer to be sure it was 325!

Delicious! The brownies were moist and dense, almost like fudge with a subtle hint of coffee. I made it in an 8x8 pan and the brownies were almost an inch thick. Next time I'll use a 9x9. Definitely a keeper!

I thought these were so good because the coffee was just the right amount with the white chocolate ganache. I almost did not put the cinnamon on bc I am not a fan of coffee and cinnamon but it was delicious! My ganache did not firm up like my regular chocolate ganache. They were gone very fast and people wanted the recipe.

Moist, rich chocolate flavor with just a hint of coffee. Not over- powering so everyone loved them; even my 13 year old. The blend of flavors was delicious right down to the cinnamon. Great with coffee! The recipe is on the small side but they are so rich it was fine for a family of 5. Any more than that and you might want to double it.
