This recipe is flawed but is definitely made better with LESS work! Instead of making the cake, I filled zip lock with the egg white mixture and clipped off the end of the bag. Then I made medium round shapes (like hershey kisses) on a baking sheet. To put it together, I used a shallow bowl, put in one meringue, topped it with the rhubarb puree,the whipped cream, and a sprig of mint. It was a beautiful presentation - and MUCH easier to eat. The mint added great flavor to each bight. Highly recommend the addition. Enjoy!

I have made this recipie several times, with minor adjustments. My family loves rhubarb. This recipie has great tastes-sweet, tart, and textures- crunch of the merengue, smooth rhubarb and whipped cream and tender raspberries. As a prior reviewer notes, it is impossible to cut the layers of merengue when there is squishy stuff between. I have found that merengue cups work the best, really, mini Pavlovas. One could also use small merengue disks, however, you're only transferring the cutting issue to the diner. In our family, it is a celebration of spring.

Too much trouble for unimpressive results. Concept seemed good, but didn't seem to come together.

This was very tasty but as I feared, it is very difficult to cut. It gets very messy slicing it up. Maybe someone out there has a clue to cutting meringue. Serrated knives don't work.

I have made this recipe twice - it is a gorgeous and impressive presentation, yet quite easy to prepare. The end result is a light and delicious dessert.
