I really wanted this to be excellent - it sounded almost exactly like a really good salad I had at one of my favorite restaurants - steak, arugula, parmesan, balsamic, it was all there. Good things: this is SO easy to put together, cooks in a flash, and looks beautiful. Less impressed with: the flavor. The balsamic was so overwhelming, and entirely too sweet. I wanted the sauce to be so much more savory - I considered adding worcestershire, which might have helped. The parmesan butter did nothing for me. Still, I'll try this again. Next time I might use a mix of red wine and balsamic, or maybe add some chicken broth. I was dissatisfied with the balsamic glaze as a dressing - will have to think about that one. I will definitely first saute the shallots in butter, which I think will replace the parmesan butter nicely, and add a nice rich flavor.

My husband thought this was 3 or 3.5 forks as it did not allow for the farm-fresh, grass-fed steak to speak on its own -- however, I thought that the balsamic glaze, parm cheese and arugula were an outstanding combination.

This was fantastic all around. Perfect balance of sweet and salty/cheesy bite. First recipe I made from this site, and it turned out exceptionally. I would make it again, but would recommend placing the parmesan butter on the steak before slicing.. first time I made it, the steak had cooled a bit too much while I reduced the balsamic glaze and the butter did not fully melt.

I Made this for Valentine's Dinner, it was excellent. I did as other had suggested and doubled the sauce. I like my steak cooked a little longer, so I place the steak back in the sauce, I would suggest this option. It adds a little flavor to the steak while glazing it. Since this was I special evening, I used one steak and serve this salad with a lobster tail and red potatoes! I will make again, a keeper!

I have never reviewed a recipe online before, but believe this recipe warrants it. This recipe tastes like it's way harder to make than it is. The flavors all go together perfectly: the parmesan butter, arugula, lemon, balsamic....it's incredible! You can taste each part complementing the others as it all melts together in your mouth. I make the recipe as written, except double up on the balsamic and brown sugar to make more sauce. If you need to impress someone- make this for dinner. Like to make it with roasted red potatoes. :) Do yourself a favor ad make this tonight! :)

Fantastic and easy! Since the meat wasn't warm enough to melt the butter, I served it on the side with some fresh baked bread. Great compliment, and adds a nice starch, not as heavy as potatoes or rice.

Who knew parmesan cheese and balsamic vinegar go so well together? It's SO EASY, it's amazing how wonderful the flavors are! The only change I make is using mixed greeens instead of only arugula. My entire family loves it.

This dish is a winner for several reasons. Number one, it's fast and easy to put together on a weeknight. It's healthy, refreshing and bright with the arugula and lemon, rich and flavorful from the steak with parmesan butter and balsamic reduction, with wonderful textural and flavor contrasts throughout. The shaved parmesan curls are key also. To round it out, I served with baked sweet potatoes.

I made this for company and everyone loved it. I used well-marbled rib-eyes and Wegmans "GD" spice blend. I dry-rubbed them and let them sit on the counter for about 2 hrs before searing them in a cast-iron pan. The glaze was delicious, however it took more then 1 minute to reduce to a syrup consistency. Instead of the arugula salad, I made the Buttermilk Ceasar dressing on this site and served with romaine. Overall, the meal was delicious and so quick and easy for a very yummy outcome.

This was a perfect dinner to prepare for valentines day, since is was a weeknight I needed something easy to make after work. The only thing I changed was added slices fresh shiitake mushrooms with the shallots, they were delish in the sauce. Feel free to use other cuts of beef aside from rib eye-this would be great with tendorloin and a lot less fattening!

Rating: 4
This was delicious but required some adjustments. The proportions for the balsamic glaze seemed off; how could 1/4 shallots work in 1/4 cup balsamic? I doubled (maybe tripled) the balsamic and used a heaping tbsp of finely diced shallots. Besides the required adjustments to the sauce this dish is easy and amazing. I will make it again and would serve it to guests, although perhaps with higher quality steak than ribeye.

This recipe is SO wonderful! I have never cooked steak before -- and it was very easy and extremely delicious. I admit, I made a few changes, but the essence of the recipe is the same. I used NY strip steak instead of rib-eye (it was on sale at Whole Foods); bleu cheese instead of Parm (which I HIGHLY recommend -- so tasty); and I added some baby shiitake mushrooms with the shallots. Overall, a very impressive and easy weeknight meal that would be great for a special evening with a loved one. My boyfriend raved. I served the steak and salad with roasted baby turnips from our CSA box, some crusty french bread, and a nice red wine. It was a wonderful Monday meal! I'm still smiling from it.

I made this recipe for my husband's birthday. He loves steak and potatoes, but I am so-so on steak.

Great, easy, quick. To short-cut the balsamic vinegar, shallots and sugar step, I sauteed shallots in steak skillet while steaks rested and deglazed pan juices with shallots into a bowl, to which I added store-bought balsamic glaze. Parmesan butter a nice addition but can be skipped if you're watching sat fat, calories. Food critic sis wants this for birthday dinner - a keeper!

Not only was this delicious and truly "simple and sophisticated", but got the 4th fork for being quick and easy. Served this as part of a lovely, relaxed New Year's Eve late dinner menu for 4. Used ribeye, aside from subbing "bold" lettuces for argula (not available) did not change recipe. Good presentation.

Seriously delicious, especially for how simple this is. I will make this again and again. I don't see the point of the parmesan butter - put more parm on your salad and/or top your steak with butter, but save yourself the work of making the butter. But, shame on BA for not telling you to put the pan juices into the glaze.

Rating: 4
Just finished eating this dish. Super easy, quick, awesome. Some thoughts: I used a mix of arugula and butter lettuce (not enough arugula in the house), which was fine, but I think the peppery arugula is really the right leaf for this salad; ribeye is very fatty, so depending on the makeup of the steak, you may want to get one a little bigger; because of the fattiness of the steak, there's really no need to use any oil at all in the pan when you fry it up; while I feel the parm butter is a nice touch, it's kind of overkill if you're counting calories or on a diet, etc. The recipe is great without it. I'll definitely be making this often.

6 forks, if I could! Had husband grill filet's outside. Doubled the balsamic with a bit of oil and the shallots and sauteed on the stove. Boiled it too long...lost some of the glaze - but it still had tremendous flavor. I added far more parm (2X ?) to the butter than it called for and it made a nice melted layer on the steak. I also added a bit of tomato and cucumber to the salad. It was the best steak salad ever! Will make this a thousand times over! If you like arugula and steak you MUST try this!

this was awesome. i added some pencil asparagus cut into 2 inch pieces (blanched for 1 minute) to the salad. I also let the meat sit out for 1 hour covered in olive oil, salt and pepper. i will definitely make this again. my boyfriend loved it.

I made this recipe at my friends house with angus steak since where i live(puerto rico) dont sell rib eye and with a regular salad since here doesnt sell arugala either. the parmesan butter was a bit strong but the balsamic glaze mellowed everything down to its great taste. everyone liked it. i would surly try it again just not with angus.

This is officially my favorite steak. I've now made this recipe twice and it is official. I'm not a steak eater but I could eat this every day! We made this with Cook's Illustrated french fries and it was a perfect dinner. We realized mid- cooking process that we were out of shallots but it didn't matter. Also, made with strip steaks and on the grill. This was really on par with bistecca I had in Florence, Italy!!!

This has become a staple in our home - my husband requests it regularly. The glaze is fantastic and the leftover steak (if you have any) retains the sweetness of the glaze next day for adding to eggs or quesadillas. A keeper!

I doubled the recipe and had it serve three people but otherwise I followed the directions to the T and it was perfect. I suggest having the oven on warm for the meat while you make the glaze so the butter melts. My boyfriend said this is a must to put into regular dinner rotation because he loved it so much.

Delicious! We loved this recipe. Made it on a whim since I had most ingredients on hand. A great way to use arugula (although I do wish I had fresh farmer's market arugula, but it was still good with my boxed stuff). No shallots so I just used a bit of yellow onion and sauteed it for a few extra seconds before adding the vinegar. Out of brown sugar too so just used a bit of honey. Oh, no lemon either so I just squeezed a bit of orange on top. Everything was wonderful! We loved the parmesan butter too.

I loved this salad. I would say the only thing I would do is double the amount of rib eye. rib eye can be extremely fatty and so when i trimmed the fat my friend and i barely had any meat left to eat. it was super delicious but am wondering how do you make it and the vinaigrette and keep the meat warm enough to melt the butter after slicing?

Excellent meal, easy to put together- makes the cook look awesome I used a few extra splashes of the vinegar and the sugar as well as the butter, it dicipates quickly

Rating: 3
Quite good,but a note of warning... Between the lemon and the vinegar,this dish turned out tasting a little on the acidic side. Also, you do have to watch the glaze,because it loses its liquid quickly when you cook it and you don't want to use too much of it because the flavor is so strong. Also, I agree with one of the other reviewers that the parm butter gets lost a bit.

We loved the recipe but I made two steaks - a rib eye for my husband and a NY strip for myself. Both turned out excellent. I also doubled the glaze. I didn't think the Parmesan butter added a lot but my husband thought it was a nice touch. A nice easy week night dinner!

Great and quick recipe. I liked the glaze a lot. A question though, how much is the glaze suppose to reduce to? I think I heated it too long and I lost a lot of the liquid. I'll try to improve my technique next time. Thank you very much.

I loved the glaze. I served this at a dinner party, and in my haste to plate all of the dishes I let the glaze cook down too far and i was short on glaze. I would turn the glaze off sooner to prevent that from happening again.

I have made this dish twice now. The first time, I made it exactly as written and it was perfection. I made the ribeye medium-rare (although normally I would prefer it more well-done) and it was the right preparation for this salad. I LOVE the shallot balsamic dressing and I did top it with the parmesan butter (you don't need much but I enjoyed the flavor it added on top of the meat). I used aged Parmesano Reggiano and would not use any other. The second time, I made it with some variations. First, I used skirt steak which I had on hand. I did not enjoy this steak prepared in a pan (it was not as delicate and rich as the ribeye but would have been great if grilled). I also added some sauteed asparagus (cut in quarters) which I finished with the parmesan butter and added to the arugula base (this was a very good addition and made the salad a bit more of an entree). The shaved parmesan is a must as is the squeeze of lemon. Next time I'll make it with the ribeye again but definitely add the sauteed asparagus to the mix. I will be making this dish a lot!! One of my all time favorite Epicurious recipes.

I made this for Valentine's Day dinner and it was delicious! I used NY Strip due to availability at the butcher and it worked nicely. Unlike some of the other reviews, I did use the parmesan butter and would do so again next time I make it. It's a subtle taste along with the balsamic glaze but you can definitely taste it. Really impressed my husband with this one & can't wait to make it for guests next time!

This was terrific especially since we have tons of arugula in the our garden. I also used New York Strip steak in the recipe and it worked beautifully. For those who don't like arugula, the combination of flavors mellows the bitterness of the arugula. Next time I am going to skip the parmesan butter and use a more parmesan shavings. The glaze really makes the dish. Lovely combination of salty, sour, sweet, bitter...delicious.

Excellent flavor and very simple to make. The only change i made was using red onion instead of shallots since i'd run out and i skipped the arugula for the same reason.

Phenomenal! The Parmesan Butter and Balsamic Glaze are the perfect combination for steak. I used NY Strip-so I had to cook it on a lower heat for a tad longer because of the thickness. Steak goes well with salad the next day. Made with brown rice with green onions for a side.

Oh my God, I loved this recipe! I followed the directions, but ended up making it just for me. It was a little bit too much for me, but if I were going to make it for two, I would probably buy two bone-in ribeyes. I am not the greatest at cutting steak, so mine did not look as pretty as the picture, but it tasted oh so good and it was so easy to make. I highly recommend this if you are dining with one other person or you need something quick to whip up on a weeknight. I love the combination of the flavors between the lemon on the arugula (I used mixed greens I got fresh from the farmer's market), the balsamic vinegar and the parmesan butter. I ended up only using a portion of the parmesan butter, because I did not want it to overwhelm the other flavors. This is definitely a keeper!
