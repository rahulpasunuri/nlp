I really enjoyed this recipe! I had to cook the fish for about 8 minutes extra (I had large fillets). It was very flavorful and delicious. Might be best served over rice or with corn tortillas. Yum! Also, to those who were confused about the number of bowls called for, the recipe does say 2 bowls on *each* of 2 baking sheets.

The fish kind of got lost in all the flavours; the mole verde stood out but it wasn't a fantastic flavour.

I did notice it only said two fillets. I just put all the fillets together and then the mushrooms and tomatillo sauce over all of them. It was pretty good. I tried pretty much all the tomatillo recipies from this issue. They were all good but they seemed to mellow out what I love about tomatillos which is their puckery bright flavor.

Anybody else notice that the recipe directions only cook 2 of the 4 filets? Place 1 filet on top of mushroom/tomatillo filled bowl. What about the other 2 filets?
