Keep in mind, one fork is "okay" and that's what this is. If you've got a hankering for a flavorful veggie dish along these lines, check out the Mediterranean Eggplant and Barley salad (also on Epicurious) instead- considerably better (and grain instead of pasta is always a good thing, healthwise). Maybe not as rainbow-pretty as this dish, but much better for omnis and veggies alike.

Absolutely divine -- at least once I added a dressing. I used about a 1/4 cup each of lime juice, soy sauce (tamari) and toasted sesame oil. I think next time I may also add some hot peppers and/or mushrooms. However, this is such an adaptable recipe (as is) that I could see dressing it up with any other potent vinaigrette (e.g. lemon-rosemary, lemon-dijon, soy-mirin-ginger, garlic-herb, truffleoil-redwine-thyme, wasabi-miso, shallot-pepper-lemon, caper-mustard-parsley, etc, etc). Also, I substituted quinoa (whole grain) for the couscous.

This was wonderful, although I did use olive oil and made a honey vinagrette

This recipe was okay. I found that adding the couscous made the meal a bit mushy. The second time I made it, I added feta cubes, substituted orzo for the cous cous and made a lemon-olive oil vinagrette to use instead of the red wine-canola oil. It was much tastier! I will only maje this again using the above mentioned substitutions.

I made this dish sans the mint and made the couscous with chicken stock and seasoned the broth with a little garlic powder. It was great, light, yet still filling.

For winter version I used sun dried tomatoes and frozen peas,I also used balsamic vinegar. Even my kids love it!

This was great with a few changes: balsalmic vs. red wine vinegar, additional garlic, and definitely a small amount of gorgonzola crumbled in. The mint and basil are wonderful with this dish, even in the winter.

A great way to use fresh vegetables from a summer garden. Based on other reviews, I added feta cheese and a little splash of lemon juice to give it more flavor.

I wish I had read the review about adding the gorgonzola before making this. That might have given it the extra kick it needed. As is, it was a little bland but very colorful. Might be good as a cold pasta.

I made the couscous in vegetable stock instead of water, and added some gorgonzola cheese at the end, which melted into the couscous. It turned out great - flavorful, with a nice light sauce. Even better reheated the next day.

Amazing!! I served this as a side dish with baked alaskan salmon and it became a main dish for the evening. Amazing flavors, especially with the fresh mint. I have had several people ask for the recipie.

Both I and my husband loved this dish. We will definitely have it again.

Eh... too much prep time for too little taste. I would tend to use this as a side dish, definatley not as a one-dish meal.

hey, don't count on this as an easy way to get rid of those deadwood husbands--my husband loved it! (and I'm glad 'cause I didn't really want him to leave)--I'm back for a second try. I'd say, Rutherford, there might have been something else going on and you're well rid of him!

Whoa, Rutherford!! Does this mean that if I cook this I get to get rid of my husband? I'll pass it on to all my gourmet friends whose better halves just won't leave ......

This meal was so bad that, my fiancee broke it off after eating it.

So much prep time; so little flavor! This recipe sounded wonderful, but I was disappointed at completion. I added lots of feta and grated asiago cheese, more basil and some oregano, which perked it up a bit.

This was bland and horrible.

I left out the broccoli and basil and added canned (drained) chick peas and just before serving chopped fresh coriander (leaves and stems). Very nice.

Regarding the salting of eggplant, when it's garden fresh then salting is not at all necessary. When you buy it from a regular supermarket, etc and it was likely picked days before then I usually find salting comes in handy, particularly if I'm making something that includes a fair amount of oil.

I made it for my vegetarian boss - he was impressed and others who shared it asked to take some home!

Delicious, and I agree with the person who skips the salting process on the eggplant. I find it extraneous and unnecessary.

Salting, rinsing, and draining eggplant also prevents it from absorbing excess oil and becoming greasy. You can put the salted eggplant in a colander in the sink instead of a bowl and not worry about it sitting around in the water/juice.

In response to Cook from Orange County -- when you sprinkle eggplant with salt it gives off water. It's also supposed to "draw off the bitterness." I always skip this step and have never had a problem.

"Toss eggplant and 1 teaspoon salt in medium bowl; let stand 30 minutes. Rinse and drain eggplant. Pat dry." Is there suppose to be water in the medium bowl or just let it sit there ??
