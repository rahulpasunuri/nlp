wanted a fun, light-hearted dessert for my NYE party and I came across this recipe. While i would definitely tweak the recipe next time (increase the crust volume and cook for a little longer so it hardens more) i would most definitely make this again. It was easy to make and a sure crowd pleaser. I am eager to try someone's reco of oreos, and I bet toasted coconut wouldnt be so bad either!

We first made these for a camping trip on a particularly dry year where campfires were not allowed. They were perfect for that, and even some people who normally don't like smores liked these. A substitution that works pretty well, but really makes it a different dish: Instead of graham crackers, use oreos (and leave out the sugar and salt).

Just okay. If your going to invest the time I would make Something else.

Made these to take on a boy scout camp-out. They were the first dessert to go, and received many compliments and recipe requests. I admit this is a very easy recipe, and my audience easy to please, but sometimes that is just what's needed--I highly recommend them!

So perfect! I increased the crust by 50%, and added more salt to really get that salty/sweet taste going. I also put the pan in the oven while the broiler was heating on a low rack. This helped the marshmallows melt a little more before they got brown. I put the whole thing in the fridge for about an hour before cutting and serving. Make sure to make really small cuts - this is very rich and sweet, but perfect!

Yes, it's sweet. But if you've had real s'mores lately, so are they! I had leftover s'more ingedients from July 4th and wanted to recreate the taste with slightly stale graham crackers and without building a fire. These were perfect! And easy.

I followed the revisions made by another reviewer and combined the crumbs with the melted chocolate, baked only once with the mini marshmallows on top. It was still crumbly. The flavor combo was good, just like a smore, but I won't make this recipe again. I'll keep looking.

A real disappointment. The crust does not hold together at all. Tasted overly sweet. Next time I'll just make smores.

Very good. I made a mess with the crumbs, and the chocolate, so I finally mixed them together and layed it out on non-stick aluminum foil, over a baking sheet. I put the marshmellows on top and broilded it for a few minutes. Since the crumbs were mixed with the chocolate, I didn't have the problem of crumbs falling. I used semi-sweet chocolate melted. Folded the cracker crumbs into it, skipped the sugar, salt and first baking, and then added the marshmellows. I cut it with a pizza knife while warm, and then chilled. I would make this again.

This is a wonderful simple recipe, great for casual family picnics! I will make it again for my smore's loving sister!

When they say broil two inches from heat, they mean two inches. My distance was slightly less and I opened the oven door just in time to see all of the marshmallows go up in flames. They were ugly, but really good.

I made this recipe for the 4th, everyone loved it!! Very easy to prepare. I used semi-sweet chocolate instead of milk chocolate. I had to send the recipe home with everyone.

Yikes! This was way too sweet! I used only 1 cup of the mini marshmellows and it was still over the top sweet. I would not make this again.

Ugh. I knew it would be sweet, so that part was not a surprise. The crust is gritty and crumbly, and is absolutely horrible sprinkled over the marshmallows. WAYYYY too much chocolate in the middle layer. Now excuse me while I go remove this recipe from my recipe box.

We subsatituted milk chocolate and used less marshmallows. Yummy, easy, but a little goes a long way.

This easy recipe has become a staple for our July 4th picnics. Watch the marshmallows carefully as they broil, it's easy to overdo.

I brought it to a picnic, set it down, and next time I looked, they were gone. Definitely a hit.

Not really worth the effort. Too messy and really, too chocolatey. These aren't so much bars as candy.

Too marshmallow-y and messy

I made these for a 4th of July party and they were a HUGE hit, with both adults and children! Cutting the bars at room temp and then chilling in the refrigerator before removing from the pan seemed to help eliminate some of the "crumbs all over the place" problem.

My children and I did not think these bars were anything special. I found them very hard to remove from the pan without having graham cracker crumbs all over the place. I would not make them again...there are far too many other good bar recipes out there.

Very easy and always a hit whenever I make them. Perfect for summer barbeques
