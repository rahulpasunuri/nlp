Excellent! Used 1/2 of the dill.

This was a delicious recipe. My girlfriend and I made this because we are trying to eat healthy. She was skeptical before she took the first bit, but she said it was so good it could make her forget red meat. Our grocery was out of bulgur, so we substituted millet, and also added some fresh peas from our green grocer. Next time I make it, I will probably add some green onion to give it a little more zing, but aside from that, this is a definite repeat dish, either for a meal at home, or for a picnic lunch or potluck

This was good, adding feta cheese to it made it great! Will definitely make it over and over.

Very simple, filling vegan recipe that I make regularly since I first discovered it here. The crispy fresh vegetables and dill are great with the bulgur and chickpeas.

Easy and Delicious!

This is another easy and healthy recipe. Make changes and additions as items you like which could be vegetables, olives and various types of cheese.

Enjoyed this as a main dish for dinner; was even better the next day. The fresh dill played a major role and complimented the veggies. Sliced toms to impart more flavor - perfect. Many grains would work with this salad; next time I'll try pearled barley or quinoa.

This recipe is so good! I substituted the bulgur for quinoa because I had it on hand. My husband loved it and it will be added into our weekly meal rotation!

What a delicious recipe! I didn't have any white balsamic vinegar or fresh dill so I used sherry vinegar and fresh cilantro - it turned out great!

Something the recipe fails to mention is that when you make anything with bulgar, it's really important to press the water out of the wheat. If you don't the flavor will be substantially watered down/bland. You'd be amazed at how much water the bulgar holds.

I eat a lot of salads of all types - grains, beans, cooked, raw, you name it. This one is better than two forks but not good enough for three forks. I made minor changes to the base recipe to enhance the flavor, without sacrificing the original flavor palette or the proportions of the ingredients. To do that would be to make an entirely different salad. First, when cooking the bulgur I used canned low sodium chicken broth for the cooking liquid. Second, I chopped a bunch of green onion and added that to the vegetable mix. I left the rest of the recipe as is, and my observations are these: the tomatoes would be easier to handle with a fork if they were halved. There juice would add a nice flavor element to the dressing, too. The taste of the white balsamic vinegar, dill, and cumin dressing is very nice. The cumin taste is not heavy and the dill of course, is refreshing. The white balsamic vinegar is a little tangier tasting than I like. I want it to blend in a little better. (Perhaps tomorrow it will have done this.) Right now as the salad is, however, I am thinking when I make this again, I might try it with just a few tablespoons of the white balsamic vinegar and the rest would be lemon juice. I might also consider zesting the lemon and adding that. My own preference is to keep the level of acidity and a little of the vinegar taste, but to mitigate the tangy-ness and to bring in a fresh, bright citrus note. I think the initial changes I made to the recipe improved the taste of the final product. If I make this next time with all of the modifications I have mentioned here, I think the resulting salad might merit three forks.

Great salad, I'm looking forward to leftovers.

I thought this recipe was good, but a little bland. I think next time I would add some spices.

I was a little skeptical at first, but when I took the first bite I was delighted! I took the advice from previous reviews and added a little feta. For just two people the recipe could be cut in half. Super fast and easy to make. I will make it again!

I agree with all the comments, it is a very fresh and healthy salad. I served it with different tarts for dinner, I am sure it would go great with grilled meats.

Healthy eating can be as easy as cooking some bulgur wheat, mixing a simple dressing, and adding a few fresh ingredients and a couple of items from the pantry. This light salad is something you would expect to find behind a gourmet deli counter. It would be a perfect vegetarian main dish, or as an accompaniment to a baked fish or roasted chicken salad. Hothouse cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, and dill are available all year long in the produce section at supermarkets, so this is a nice idea for any season. http://michaelbeyer.wordpress.com/2010/10/23/bulgur-garbanzo-bean-and-cucumber-salad/

Great recipe! Simple, fresh, healthy and delicious. It makes a huge amount; I doubled the recipe to make a side dish for 25 people. I used less dill.

I finally tried this last night, and I agree with everyone - it's delicious. I wasn't sure I'd like the dill, but I did! I cut the recipe in half, otherwise followed it - and I have leftovers for lunch. Perfect!

Delicious and easy. Followed the recipe exactly but added a little lemon pepper and tarragon. What a yummy, healthy dinner!

So yummy and so easy! Perfect for lunch for work and with a little salt in the dressing (like the recipe suggests), it has plenty of flavor.

This is good and healthy. I added chopped kalamata olives. Next time I'll use the cherry tomatoes instead of the chopped tomatoes I had on hand, feel like the salad would be less 'watery' that way.

I really like this dish. I made it to take to work for lunches for the week, and found it to be very satisfying. I do agree with some of the commenters about the need for a little salt, but I'm not really sure it needs feta (though I did buy some to add just in case). I will definitely make again, and it's inspired me to do more with bulgur, which I've never used before.

Great recipe! Very light yet satisfying. I am gluten free, so substituted a cup of quinoa and a cup of black rice. Loved the texture with the rice!

I couldn't find bulgur so I used quinoa instead and it worked very well. We really enjoyed this and are looking forward to the left-overs tomorrow.

My fiance made this for dinner last night and it was spectacular. It's fresh, healthy, and very filling. I loved the addition of the white balsamic vinegar. Today I added fresh mint and some kalamata olives and feta cheese and had the leftovers for lunch and it was sooooooo amazing. Highly recommended!

This was just okay. I agree with previous reviewers that it needs either some feta or some liberal salting. Or maybe something a bit sweet like dried fruit. I probably won't make this again.

Dried dill, red wine vinegar, and chopped tomatoes were on hand, bell peppers were not. Delish!

I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this recipe. It has a great balance of flavors and textures; I served it with grilled chicken and it was a perfect accompaniment. A word to the wise- it needs quite a bit of salt before it comes into it's own- once the seasoning is right it's very flavorful!

Good basic recipe in want of a little embellishment, in my opinion. Some chopped Belgian endive, mint and fresh coriander (aka cilantro) should do the trick.
