This was wonderful. I used our own beef shanks - in case you raise your own beef :). And only had a 1/2 bottle of red wine on the counter, so that's what I used. Otherwise, I followed it exactly. Next time I'll cut back on the red pepper since I have a few eaters who aren't fans of "hot". But it was rich, earthy, not thin at all, and a keeper.

I thought this was a fabulous recipe with a couple of adjustments. First, I made the sauce one day ahead and degreased it before continuing. Like the other reviewers, I found the sauce too thin, so I cooked it down for a while and added a can of tomato paste. I also added some sauteed mushrooms, which complemented the earthy flavor of the beef. I did not use any of the meat from the bones, as I had used soup bones and the quality was not that good. But the beef flavor left behind from the use of the bones was outstanding. I have passed this recipe on to my daughter and would definitely make it again. In fact, I am planning on canning it up next time.

Sorry to say this dish was not worth the trouble. Had to track down beef shanks (seasonal), which were overpowered by the flavor of the sausage anyway. More like a pot roast, sauce itself very running and did not adhere to the poasta. Won't make again, would not recommend.

Easy to make, rich with layered flavors, a sophisticated comfort food with the nutty/sweet pasta complimenting the fennel. I love this recipe so much, I traveled with it to Sonoma to host a dinner party for a group of friends at a house we rented. It was a success, until I realized the recipe was lost somwhere between CA and WI. Hurray for Epicurious! It is now found.

This is a GREAT pasta recipe and it works perfectly with the whole grain spaghetti. I read all the reviews and can't really identify with the complaints. My beef shanks were barely a inch thick so I reduced the cooking time. The sauce looked a little odd but after stirring it everthing blended together. What a hit and I would definitely serve this to company for a casual dinner. I served a salad and garlic toast as accompaniments.

This is a bit of a mess of a recipe, as written. It kind of depends on what you are expecting out of it. If you're looking for a spaghetti sauce (because you think that is what goes with spaghetti), then this doesn't work because there is insufficient filler (tomato paste, tomato sauce, etc.) to gel the ragu together. If you're basically expecting beef stew, and you don't mind putting that stew over pasta, then this works. I found the dish to be exceedingly runny for any purpose, and I don't buy the "it depends on the cut of meat you buy" line. That is 100% true for a nice beef tenderloin; but for shank braised north of two hours, it's not going to vary much from one cut to the next. I wouldn't do this again, but for those of you who feel compelled, if you want a ragu with more heft, perhaps add some tomato paste. Another option would be to do as they did in the Pasta with Veal, Sausage and Porcini Ragu dish (a great recipe), which is to process half of the meat. I thought that was crazy while I was doing it but it turned out great thereafter -- maybe something like that is what is needed for this recipe.

Definitely worth the effort. The whole wheat pasta made a difference.

Substituted venison for the beef and used mild sausage instead of spicy to accommodate my 4 and 8 year old nephews. Next time I'll use spicy sausage. Also only used 1/2 bottle of Cabernet wine.

An excellent dish to make on a winter day! I made minor adjustments. After browning the sausage, I discarded the fat. It ended up being about 1 cup, so I thought the end result would have greasy had I not done that. Next time I think I will pour myself a glass of wine then put the rest in the pot. A full bottle was just a tad too much. I also added 1 28 0z can of crushed tomatoes. I made mini rigatoni and mozzarella garlic bread. It was very yummy.

I've made this twice now and it is amazing. But like every recipe you make the ingredients make the difference. If you're going to use low quality sausage and you don't get the shanks trimmed well - you'll end up with a greasy mess. I'll definitely try using veal shanks next time and pushing the marrow into the ragu, that's a great suggestion. Also, using whole wheat spaghetti does add depth. Substitute on the pasta if you like, but it's really great with the whole wheat.

I have not been big on meat sauces, but the picture of this spaghetti made me want to try it. I thought it was fantastic. I couldn't find beef shanks, so used short ribs and browned them well first in a heavy Le Creuset type pan. The sauce was not greasy, the wine not overwhelming, the meat was not gray. It was perfect. Again, this is from one that typically prepares sauce without the meat.

I have made this 3 times since the magazine came out. Absolutely delicious. So good that my husband wants me to learn how to preserve it so our cupboards can be filled with jars of it. I used veal shanks instead of beef and pushed the marrow out of the bone and into the sauce after braising. I do this when I make pasta sauce out of leftover Osso Buco as well. I find using a good pot such as Le Creuset helps with some good searing leaving lots of delicious browned bits to scrape up. I put the pasta on one side of the bowl and the ragu on the other side so you grab some pasta and swirl it into the ragu. Made for nice presentation as well. This is a definite keeper that I will make time and time again.

I thought this recipe was good, not great. My husband loved it. In all fairness, I am not a meat sauce lover and he is. But I found this to be very greasy, despite the fact that I pulled the beef from the fat by hand. I will make this again for my husband, but will use a leaner, higher quality beef. The sausage added a nice zing. I also used an italian brand of crushed tomatoes rather than diced.

I couldn't agree more with the last reviewer! For all of the work that goes into this recipe we ended up adding classico tomato sauce in order to make it look and taste a little less scary!

This is prison spaghetti! If orange grease and disturbing gray meat bring back fond memories of your favorite correctional institution, then you're sure to enjoy this. You won't shed a tear over the unforunate meat-to-tomato ratio or the overpowering taste of the wine. After all, you've got your freedom now.

Loved it. Couldn't wait to eat -the house smelled wonderful. Like most, I used short ribs instead of beef shanks and I used all sweet italian sausage. It is only 2 of us and it made enough for 4 meals. I ended up freezing individual pouches that could be thawed and reheated. Those pouches are already gone. My husband loved it so much I may double up the recipe to freeze and thaw later as needed.

Excellent recipe! I have been salivating over this recipe for several weeks in the May issue. Spotted some very nice beef shanks at the Whole Foods and wham! off we went. We made a few alterations: added a few short ribs to round out the shanks and a small piece of lamb for depth of flavor, used half hot and half sweet sausage, and added a bit more diced tomato and a chopped carrot. Would have liked to have cooled the sauce and heated it up tomorrow so that it would thicken some, but absolutely could not wait. The whole house was permeated with the fragrance of the ragu. The entire family enjoyed it; the teenagers ate until they could eat no more. Then we carried some to the married son for their dinner. Next time we will modify it a bit more: a different blend of meats, mushrooms, some red bell pepper and who knows.

Delicious! I did make some changes based on what I had on hand. I couldn't find beef shanks. I used lamb shanks & chicken sausage. Also didn't braise in the oven, but on top of the stove. This reminded me of a dish I had at a little Italian restaurant in the Bowery. So good! Would be great for a dinner party.

Exceptionally good! I say that even though I made it with stew meat, turkey hot Italian Sausage and left out the fennel, because I don't like it that much! Used twice the olive oil... everything else remained the same as instructed. Fantastic!! Wow

Wow! This was so so so good!! The beef shank is a pretty fatty meat so I wouldn't make this often, but every once in awhile is perfect! The flavors & aromas were awesome. Can't wait to make this again for a dinner party!

I was highly skeptical about this while making the ragu. The amount of grease was off putting to say the least. I made the ragu a day ahead and skimmed both when it was just out of the oven and again when it was chilled and that made a world of difference. We used short ribs in place of shank as we could find any at the local shops and would likely make this again should the mood for an extra meaty pasta dish strike in the future.

Very good but not the best sauce I've made from this site. It's very chunky and meaty. The flavors are good but the depth isn't as impressive as I'd like. Maybe some dried porcini would give it what it's missing? Don't bother with the cheese on the pasta before the sauce, I couldn't taste it at all. Better to put a little on top, I think. Beware, this makes a ton of sauce. More than 12 servings in our house.

This made a huge amount of ragu and I thought I would freeze it but we ate it all in two days! I thought it was fabulous.Intense savory flavor. I'm not a big fan of whole wheat noodles so didn't use them but think this sauce would make them palatable.

This was a wonderful ragu and pasta dish. We loved it and can't wait for the leftovers. I did not have the shanks so used beef short ribs and just was careful to cut off the fat and really spoon it off before serving. I too just made 1/2 the recipe and there is plenty leftover (thank goodness). I will make this again and again.

Awesome recipe and relatively easy to make. Good flavor that got even better as a leftover.

This was wonderful - one of the best I have made. My husband and several coworkers LOVED it. I modified slightly: - I used sliced stewed tomatoes (crushed them a bit), and I used Mild Italian Sausage. I also cut garlic to 5 cloves. I don't normally use whole grain spaghetti but I did this time. It was worked great with the sauce. It made a very large batch - I froze some (We'll see how that goes). I will make this again for sure.

Wow! The absolute best spaghetti I've ever eaten! But having said that, a couple of modifications. (1) I couldn't find beef shanks, so I used ox tail. (2) I was going to be out all day, so after browning, everything went into the crock pot on low for about 9 hours. (3) I had a handful of mushrooms, so I diced them & added them. I halved the recipe, and it served 7 with seconds. Everyone raved about the ragu.
