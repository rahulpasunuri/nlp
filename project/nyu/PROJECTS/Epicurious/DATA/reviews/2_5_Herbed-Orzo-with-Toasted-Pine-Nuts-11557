Very good side for our fish recipe. I used 1/4 cup of orzo with 1T butter, the toasted pine nuts 2 wedges of lemon juice, 3T coriander and no mint. I also added 1 pressed garlic clove and about 1 ounce parmesan.

2 1/2 forks would be perfect. I tweaked the recipe based on reviews and it was a great side dish for our fish dinner. I made this recipe for 2 using 1/4 cup orzo; 1T butter; 2 lemon wedges; about 1 oz parm; 1 pressed garlic clove; the toasted pine nuts and coriander. Quick and simple.

This is a good, basic recipe. Quick and easy. Very forgiving if you're missing an ingredient or want to add something you've got on hand. I like it with olive oil, feta and mint. I skipped the coriander (cilantro) because I didn't have any.

Since there was just the two of us, I halved the orzo but put the same amount of herbs in and a good splash of lemon juice. It didn't need the butter. It was delicious.

This was flavorless and a disappointment.

This wasn't worth the time it took to make. No flavor and way too greasy. Blech.

This is a great dish with rack of lamb which I have used many times. I use 4 TBLs of mint(instead of 3) and add a little fresh grated parmesan cheese to the dish. Add roasted carrots as well and you get a very colorful plate.

This was not very good - lacked taste.

A tasty side dish. We found half of this recipe to be plenty for four adults.

One thing to commend this recipe is that it can be made in less than 10 minutes! The combination of flavors is wonderful. I did add one clove of garlic (through a garlic press) and only used mint instead of coriander. The addition of the garlic made all the difference
