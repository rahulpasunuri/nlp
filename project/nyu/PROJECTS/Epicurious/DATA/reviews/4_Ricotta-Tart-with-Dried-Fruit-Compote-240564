Yum! This dish was the perfect fall accompaniment to the gnocchi/mushroom/butternut squash recipe. I made it as specified in the recipe except that I replaced dried cranberries for the cherries. I used a handy trick from a friend- instead of pie weights I used coin change on top of the foil. I packed some extra for a dinner guest- she didn't think she could get home without eating the third piece. Full confession- I have had two and might have another shortly.

I made two of these for a party -- the perfect amount for about 20 guests. I made one with sliced strawberries on top and the other with chocolate drizzled on top, and served them with sliced strawberries and nectarines on the side instead of the compote. Please, please make the ricotta from scratch. It is so easy and rewarding! I made a batch from the homemade ricotta recipe on epicurious and it was enough for two tarts.

dee-licious! made this for a new year's eve party with fresh ricotta (which is surprisingly easy to make). the dried fruit compote was a nice complement to the light cheese base. I'll definitely make this again.

Doesn't get any better than this. Used dried cranberries instead of cherries in compote. Delicious.

this is a great recipe and a great base for other flavors. My children love it as a chocolate tart when I melt in choc chips. You could add grand marnier, almond paste or fresh vanilla bean. Anything to change the flavor - and ditch the compote.

I loved this recipe! The tart dough was a little tough to work with, but I have an 11-inch round tart pan and had to multiply everything by 1.5. It might be easier in a smaller tart pan. I refrigerated the dough for a bit (a common step in tart recipes that was not included here) and that made it somewhat easier to work with. I also added lemon juice (maybe 1T) to the filling, which was really good, and made it a bit brighter tasting. I had to use mission figs, because I didn't have time to go searching for Calimyrnas, and I think they would have been better. Still really good though. The compote was also delicious over vanilla ice cream. I think I also upped the lemon juice in the compote, because I tend to prefer things less sweet and this is definitely on the sweet side. The tart would make a good base for other toppings, too - I'm going to make it with fresh glazed blueberries this weekend.

It is absolutely worth it to make your own fresh ricotta for this recipe -- the recipe for that is on this site, just milk, cream, salt, lemon juice and about 10 minutes is all it takes. Easy and impressive! :- ) This is a light tart that goes well with the dried- fruit compote but would also work with berries or other fruits. The filling will also work well in custard cups and baked in a water bath.

This was one of the six desserts we had for Thanksgiving. I didn't have an extra tart pan, but did have 4" individual tart pans. I used frozen puff pastry dough this time but will definately make the tart dough from scratch next time. They were recieved well by my guests and hold up lovely to eat later as leftovers. The compote was amazing.

i made this using splenda for a diabetic guest and it was a definite hit! the crust was perfect and the ricotta filling delicious (used fresh)

I actually made my own ricotta for this recipe: overkill, perhaps, but it did make a difference to use fresh ricotta, since the flavor of the tart filling is delicious but subtle. This is a wonderful dessert: the combination of the creamy filling, crisp crust, and vanilla-scented fruit and syrup is entirely satisfying. I made it for my reading group (people who are jaded by years of eating my desserts) and they all raved about it.
