Hens were excellent! I served them with wild rice and sauteed sugar snap peas. Didn't change a thing about the recipe.

Funny thing...I enjoy game hens, and I like oranges but...I didn't like the combination together. True enough the marinade was very flavorful but I just didn't care for it at all. Decided to grill the hens instead of baking but think that it would've burnt easily either way because of the honey in the marinade. Thumbs down on this one.

Love this recipe! We had it for dinner last night, after I found it here on the Epicurious site. I was also browsing my recipe notebooks, where I found my notation on the clipping that I cut out of the magazine. We enjoyed it 10 years ago, as well! Last night we grilled them instead of roasting, and left them whole. We also had snow peas, angel hair pasta with lemon and ginger, and a citrusy chardonnay.

I see mine is the only 2-fork review to date. Perhaps I should have cut the hens in half as directed, but I doubt that would have made the skin crisper. We like crispy skin, and this was not. As I did not have orange honey (could the recipe have meant orange "blossom" honey?), I combined regular honey with orange marmalade as suggested by another reviewer. The sauce was a bit too sweet for our tastes. I'd hoped the garnish of sesame seeds at the end would result in their getting toasted; they did not, and added little. We still somewhat enjoyed the dish, but there are many other tastier recipes on this site for Cornish hens. I'll go back to those. They are easier, too.

This marinade is full of flavor. I used 1/4 cup of clover honey and 1/4 cup of orange marmalade to substitue the orange honey. Tasted great!

This recipe is a keeper, the reduced marinade is perfect for Cornish Hens. I look forward to trying the marinade on chicken.

The spouse chose this recipe for his Valentine dinner. It it one of his favorites. The recipe has a nicely balanced teriyake flavor.

The marinade is excellent for the cornish hens. However, since its late spring and the weather is warmer, instead of baking the hens in the oven I cook them on the grill and base with the marinade. It's a change from chicken and turns out great! The entire family loves it.
