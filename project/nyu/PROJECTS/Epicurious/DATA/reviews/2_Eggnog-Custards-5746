I found it a little bland. I served it topped with raspberries, and that was the only saving grace.

For the person who wanted to substitute milk for 1/2 and 1/2, the only alteration to the recipe is going to be a little bit to the taste. However I would suggest reading the labels on whole milk and 1/2 and 1/2... for most brands there's not a lot of nutritional difference. You can substitute skim milk even, the recipe will still work, it just won't taste as rich.

I often use Land O' Lakes fat free half and half in recipes calling for regular half and half and sometimes (depending on the preparation) use it instead of whipping cream. It tastes great... and I like fattening food!

In response to the previous post, to cut the fat, I would suggest using low fat canned evaporated (not condensed) milk. I have tried this in other custard recipes, and it works really well.

Does anyone know if it's OK to substitute whole milk for the half-and-half - in an attempt to make it slightly healthier?
