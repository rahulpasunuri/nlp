This is a good recipe and yes it is a little runny and that was okay. I halved the recipe and 10 ounces of plum tomatoes = 3 so I only got 6 halves. I followed some reviewers advice and diced more (4) and processed 2. I added 1 1/2 serranos to half the recipe. If you have the time (it's quick) make this to serve with the Crispy Pork recipe.

A nice, solid version of a classic sauce. Not spectacular, but very good.

Fabulous! To make it not so watery, what I did is increase the amount of tomatoes by just a little bit, seed and dice almost all of them instead of just part of them, and dumped most of them in the food processor and just left a few for chunks. My friends like a milder flavor, so I just used one chile. I also added a garlic clove, which made a great change.

I made this last week for a summer family function and everyone loved it. I'm making it again this weekend for another party. Yum.

This is the perfect summer salsa. I have made it many times since the issue came out and it has always been a huge hit. Very flavorful, authentic, and fresh. I add a bit more lime and cilantro for my personal taste.

I loved this salsa! The bright flavors are a wonderful contrast the roast meats in this May issue. It takes about 10 minutes to make too. Also I have to say when we were in Mexico one of the things I noticed was that their salsas are much more liquid than ours so for authenticity this gets an A. I will make this again and again and again.

Too liquidy; just so-so; there were other better salsa recipes in the May 2003 issue.
