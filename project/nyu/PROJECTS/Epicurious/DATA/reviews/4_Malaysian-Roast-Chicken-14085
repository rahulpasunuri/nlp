Delicious! I didn't have oyster sauce on hand, so I substituted it with half fish sauce and half tamari. I'm sure it would be better if made properly. I can't believe one batch is enough for a whole chicken, I used one batch for two chicken breasts and some sauteed bok choy. I also only marinated for 4 hours. Longer would be better.

Excellent. I took some reviewers suggestions and doubled the marinade and marinated for 2 days. So much flavor and so moist! I served this with Mushroom Fried Rice and Asian-Style Spicy Coleslaw both from Food & Wine.

First time I made it I marinated it for a couple days because I didn't get around to cooking it. It was excellent, so I've done the same ever since. Every time I cook this everyone loves it.

Very easy & delicious. The chicken had a great flavour & remained moist. My son loved it. I used a vertical roaster so I didn't need to flip the chicken & it took less time to roast.

summer version - marinate chuncks of chicken, thread on skewers with fresh pineapple, red pepper and red onion. Holy cats, it's good.

I used the marinade on boneless, skinless chicken thighs and it was delicious! I let them marinade for about 1 hour, then baked them, which created lots of pan juices. Made the house smell fantastic!

2X sauce, 4hr version: 2 forks until tasting leftover meat: delicious. Will definitely make again, marinating longer. Considerably more fuss than typical roast chicken but worth it at least for leftovers. Smelled great roasting.

Something very different other than your ordinary herb/lemon roast chicken. Marinade flavor permeated the chicken throughout. Roasted it at 350C for an hour and a half, flipping it over at 45 mins. Also I held back the remaining marinade in a bowl, and basted every so often instead of pouring it over the bird all at once. When done there was a little sauce left in the pan, but found that the chicken was flavorful enough on it's own, and didn't need any additional on the side. The sauce baked onto the crispy skin and presented beautifully. The longer you can marinate it, the better. Served with steamed brown jasmine rice, and garlic and ginger stir-fried chinese long beans.

Very tasty, and a great make ahead dish. Disappointed that there weren't any pan juices to serve with the chicken (they had cooked onto the foil). In the summer, I'll try marinade on chicken breasts (with bones) on the grill.

I used legs and thighs rather than a whole chicken. I marinated for 24 hours...it came out great. My family loved it!

Very nice marinade. I doubled the garlic (as usual) and added some fresh ginger.

pretty good and darn easy - in regards to replacing oyster sauce, it is a unique flavor, but replacing with hoisin or plum sauce and cutting sugar elsewhere (use sugar-free ketchup?) would probably work.

This is easy and wonderful! Instead of cooking it on such a high heat, I cooked it at 350 and for half an hour per pound. It came out so tender and delicious that my guests ate every last bit of it. I also used it for fish, and it turned out great.

Made it several times and love it. A great make ahead dish. The marinade is even great with a fryers chicken. I've had a hard time finding chili paste, but tomato paste with chili powder work fine.

I made this recipe using Cornish Hens. I used one marinade recipe per two hens and cooked them breast side down 25 minutes at 450, turned them over, and cooked an additional 25 minutes at 350. Marinating overnight not only added to the flavor but made preparation for a dinner party the next day a snap.

I cut the chicken skin in several places and covered the entire bird with red banana peels and the peels from the mango and pineapple. This sealed in the flavor, kept the skin from charring and made for a nice presentation at meal time. Definitely marinate this dish for as long as possible and make sure the marinade gets under the skin.

what can you use as a substitute for oyster sauce? can't eat shellfish.

Like I did the first time I made this dish, I placed slices of Sweet Papaya, Sweet Pinneaple and Mango around and on top of the chicken to prevent it from burning and drying out. However, I did double up the sauce and marinate the chicken for 48 hours, and the juices from the tropical fruits toned the spices down just right and the chicken's skin was not burned at all. Every once in a while, I used the basting syringe and squirted the juice all over the chicken. This gave the chicken a zesty taste of the tropical flavor as well.

I doubled the marinade, marinated the chicken for two days and rubbed the marinade between the skin and meat as suggested. The flavor was wonderful and flavored the meat throughout. I did reduce the temperature to 375 because the skin was turning too dark.

I loved this chicken. I didn't have oyster sauce so I used hosin sauce and fish sauce mixed together. I doubled the sauce recipe and after skiming of the fat, I thicken the sauce with a little cornstarch. My husband and daughter really loved it. I will absolutely make this chicken again. I also served it with curried rice and put a little of the sauce on that, yummy!

I made this dish for dinner last night and it was delicious. The marinade seemed a little flat, so I added a tablespoon of sherry to it, as well as 1/4 tsp Chinese five-spice powder, both of which added a lot to the flavour. Also used plenty of garlic! I marinated the chicken overnight and rubbed the marinade under the skin, as suggested. This gave an excellent depth of flavour, especially for anyone who is trying to cut back on fat a bit as the flavour of the marinade penetrates into the chicken very well and removing the skin from my portion did not remove the flavour. (You can always give the skin to the person - and there always is one! - who can eat all the fat they please without gaining weight!) I did find that there did not seem to be much of the marinade and wondered how there could possibly be enough to pour over the chicken before roasting, so doubled the amount, and at the end skimmed the fat off the pan drippings, poured the drippings into a saucepan, and thickened with corn starch and water. The sauce was wonderful on the chicken and the rice, and makes me want to triple the marinade next time for extra sauce. I served it with the curried squash, as suggested, which was delicious. My husband, who cannot manage very hot spicy food, really enjoyed this dinner. All in all, a real hit!!! Will definitely make again.

this is the first roast chicken recipe i have used that i felt had a truly original taste to it. the seasonings were perfect and you could taste it in every bite (most recipes once you get past the skin it tastes like every other roast chicken recipe) and the gravy was most delish. i actually thickened the gravy with flour and water, and added a dash of pepper to give it some body. i have passed it on to my mum and sister, and will be making it again soon.

Entire family thought this was great. I followed the advice of a reviewer and rubbed the marinade under the skin of breast and thighs. Served with a stirfry of broccoli, red peppers, snow peas, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts and baby corn.

If I could bottle the aroma of this dish cooking I would make a fortune. Overall, the recipe is easy to follow. I found myself licking my lips an hour later after eating it. It is not a super spicy dish. Although it sounds like it is. I really enjoyed it served cold. A keeper.

This dish is GREAT!! It's best when marinated overnight. I couldn't find shallots, so I substituted green onions instead and it was fine. This was a definite "hit" with the entire family!

This dish was fantastic. The chicken was moist and the marinade rich. I suggest rubbing the marinade under the skin thoroughly. Place foil on extremities to prevent burning.

It is an okay dish. It sounded more delicious in writing.

this will become a family staple. The flavour goes through the chicken and it is great to put in the fridge and pick at later.
