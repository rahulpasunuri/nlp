Easy to prepare, fairly bland. Recommendations: 1. Broil the eggplant before roasting it, to get it browned. 2. Make sure each vegetable is correctly seasoned. 3. Make sure to get all the dry layers of the onion removed before roasting the onion. 4. Top with a portobello mushroom. The skin of the eggplant and the drier outer rings of the onion made this dish very difficult to eat without having the entire thing cover the plate. it really needs a sauce.

Made this several times... always a hit. To make the eggplant better, slice and salt the slices to draw out the bitter juices on to papertowels. This will take a least an hour, so allow time. It's a definite plus to the taste.

I haven't made this in years, because it is so time-consuming, but the fact that I remember it 10 years after I made it shows you how amazing it is.

Excellent for dinner parties - have made several times. I use mozzarella with proscuitto and add shredded parmigiano reggiano cheese to the ricotta mixture. And definitely use a wooden skewer to bake, then insert the rosemary sprig.

I used basic idea (grilling each vegetable first) to make a layered casserole. Added other veggies, more spices and more cheese second time I made it. Great for a party!

way to much work for mediocre results. looks reasonably impressive but taste was bland, as another reviewer cited, even when drizzed with a balsamic reduction. won't bother to make again.

Excellent. A real stunner. I didn't use the potatoes but the recipe was fabulous without it. And my husband who doesn't like eggplant loved this dish. Will definitely make it again.

This is the standard "first dinner party of the fall" centerpiece recipe each year for 6 years running. I serve it with Olive-Tomato Ragout, a cheesy polenta, sometimes add fresh grilled halibut, and a deep rich red wine. Perfect and impressive every time. Definately use the wooden skewers while cooking. Sometimes I use a lavendar sprig if one is still around, or a blooming rosemary....

If I thought I could make a dish beyond compare, I'd give it 4 forks, but I'll leave that to the pros... I'd say it does look very impressive and restaurant-y, and best of all tastes delish. I put the rosemary in at the end so as to not burn it. A real favorite at the dinner table!

This was very good and is a good make-ahead dish. one change I made was to use portobello mushroom caps for the bottom layer. I would also use more tomato next time. I would also use a wooden skewer during the baking of the napoleons, remove and insert the rosemary sprig before serving, as another cook suggested.

Delicious and easy! It could've used a touch more seasonings, but it was great. Very attractive as well. I have served this as a main dish as well as a side dish.

Excellent dish when entertaining! Or any other time. I absolutely love it, its VERY presentable and always goes over well with everyone. I've made this dish many times since I saw it on the cover of Gourmet in 96. (Its the picture that really made me want to try it in the first place!)

I made this one new years eve and it went over well. It looks like something out of a five star restaurant! However, the vegetables need to be wide enough to hold the shape of the napoleon and I would recommend using a wooden skewer to hold it together while baking as the rosemary did burn. I would add the rosemary after it has been baked. I served this as a side dish and everyone loved it.

I'm writing this review as I prepare to make it for the secind time. The first time I made this recipe was for a tennis luncheon. I "customized" the napoleons for some who had allergies, or just didn't care for certain veggies. The preparation was so simple for such a great final product! I served it with a reduced raspberry balsamic glaze simply drizzled before serving. This time I'm layering it "lasagna-style" for the family with a side of smoked turkey sausage. Don't hesitate to try this recipe!

This recipe is missing something. Love the roasted veggies. Definitely recomend large & wide veggies in order to have a stable napoleon. The rosemary burned in the oven so that wasn't too cool. Think the napoleon would be nice if it was accompanied by a tomato sauce spooned around it. I served it with a lemon, parsley orzo & it worked for me. Had a better one in a restaurant.

The nice part about this recipe is it can all be done ahead of time. I thought all the chopping of the vegetables and cooking would be so time consuming but I did it all on the grill in about 40 minutes. The presentation was beautiful and it had wonderful "wow" appeal. The only mistake I made was I made this as the vegetable part of a meal and people thought it could be a meal itself.

Showy presentation and delightful taste. I like to serve to people who ask in all seriousness ask, "But, what do you eat?" when informed I don't eat meat.

Very good. I was skeptical that all of the vegetables would take the same time to roast, but it all worked out. I added plantain, which lent a little bit of sweetness, compensating for my not having sweet onion. Don't shirk on the tomatoes!

This looked impressive and tasted great. If you roast the vegetables ahead of time give them a little more time in the oven before serving. Everyone raved and asked for the recipe.

I made this dish for a medium-sized dinner party (along with other things) and people really loved it. They were very impressed with the presentation and the flavor combo. I also served lasagne for those who can't do without meat. I highly recommend this for people who like vegetables!

My wife found this recipe in the Philadelphia Inquirer but she couldn't believe it when they said to cut everything one inch thick. However, it mentioned Gourmet Magazine and so I looked it up on the Internet. The real recipe asked for 1/3 inch thick slices. It makes a lot, but we made it all and found ourselves eating it four nights in a row. We never got tired of it!
