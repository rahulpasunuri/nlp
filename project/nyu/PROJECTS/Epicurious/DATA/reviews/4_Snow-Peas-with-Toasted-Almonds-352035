This seems almost criminally good for how ridiculously easy it is. Definitely don't skip the lemon juice.

Loved this. Quick and easy. Even the kids ate it.

Excellent - so simple and yet so flavorful. Don't skip the lemon juice at the end as it really helps intensify the natural flavors of the snow peas. I followed the recipe exactly and had no trouble with toasting the almonds to perfection. A keeper!

Wonderful easy recipe that tastes great. My boyfriend really loved this one. Just make sure you don't burn the almonds, they will cook really quickly. I used a lot more shallots than the recipe called for (about 3x as much) and it tastes great.

The last time I used toasted almonds with anything green, it was green beans. I wasn't impressed then, but they compliment the snow peas in this recipe perfectly. I'm guessing it has something to do with the texture/thinness of both the peas and the almonds. In each bite, you get a lovely balance of both -- one doesn't overpower the other in taste or in texture. Best the same day, though. There's just something odd and wilty-like about leftover snow peas...

I make snow peas often, and they are always good, but this recipe is GREAT. Who would have thought adding almonds and a tiny bit of lemon juice would make such a difference?

Went with snap peas instead of snow as a result of being a little confused / drunk about the difference between snow and snap peas. Kept them on the fire a little longer as a result and turned out fine. Super easy.

As a vegetarian with a picky boyfriend, I have a hard time figuring out side dishes considering our entrees are often glorified side dishes! But this recipe is GOOD. I didn't have any lemon juice and without the lemon juice the dish left a bit to be desired...so I added just a few shakes of Spike (all-purpose seasoning) and it was SO MUCH BETTER! In fact...I made this when my boyfriend was gone because I wanted to try it before making it for dinner (considering I've felt kinda bad about serving him nauseatingly- cooked kale and the like) and...I must confess...I ate all 4 servings by myself. Exceedingly easy and quick (otherwise I would have undoubtedly screwed it up), and really tasty.

I loved this. My daughter ate the peas out of the shells before they were cooked and would eat them after they were cooked. But this was an easy, different side dish to make. Will definitely make this regularly.

One of the best ways to serve snow peas! The almonds and butter raise this delicious vegetable to a sophisticated side dish.

I made this recipe last night as written and served with the 5 spice chicken and ginger rice from the menu. The snow peas were ridiculously delicious and easy. Can't wait to have my "rice bowl" for lunch today.

Simple and Delicious. My 2 year old kept asking for more!

I made this for a big group dinner this evening and it was a total hit. The only thing I changed is cooking it in olive oil (be careful not to burn the almonds) and adding a touch of garlic salt. Ridiculously easy and I could not believe how tasty it was.

This dish was fabulous! Not only was it quick and easy, but the flavor was exceptional and light. Definitely a keeper.

This is the first recipe I have made from this site and it was absolutely delicious! I made it for dinner last night and am eating leftovers as I type&heavenly. I blanched the snow peas for 1-2 minutes other than that I followed the instructions faithfully and after one bite it became my new favorite side dish, perfect with some baked chicken strips and rice. The almonds, butter, shallots and lemon merge to make a lovely sauce. Light and vibrant and really easy to make. Highly recommended. k
