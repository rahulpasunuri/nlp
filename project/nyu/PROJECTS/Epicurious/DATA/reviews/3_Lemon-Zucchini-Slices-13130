This was a plain dish. However, it was so easy. If you have a lot of zucchini and need a light, fast dish, this is the one for you.

Easy to do--and the flavor of the delicate flavor of the zucchini isn't lost.

I also liked it. Not spectacular, but easy and tasty. I had a red pepper that I cut up into similar sized chunks and added, worked well.

I tried this recipe and used the advise of the first review, using bakers rack. It was quick, easy and very tasty. What a great snack or side dish.

Given that zucchini is often plentiful in the garden, and recipes are often elaborate, this is a breeze! It's delicious. I baked the slices on a baker's wire cooling rack, eliminating the tedious turning, and oiled and salted before baking. The lemon as a last touch going to table is great.
