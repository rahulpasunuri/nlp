Fantastic! Made this for Easter. Absolutely the best Lamb ever. Will definitely make this again!

This was a HUGE hit for Easter. I followed the recipe exactly. To answer another users question, it is 1T sugar. I was so nervous that I had ruined the recipe when I saw salt in the instructions. I was going to sprinkle it on the chops before broiling but forgot. Broiled for 4- 6 mins on each side. They were AMAZING and very tender. Everyone loved them so much... I had to print out a couple of copies of the recipe.

Made this last Easter and it was phenomenal! Looking forward to serving it again this year. Way to go Michael Symon.

This is my "go to" recipe. Can be used with any cut of lamb. Serve with the "tzatziki". You won't be disappointed.

this is REALLY good. I was concerned about too much minty flavor, and I'm not usually a fan of fresh oregano, its got a pungent taste, but it all worked together well. I went the mix all and marinate route, worked great. I did sprinkle extra salt and pepper just before grilling. Next time I will squeeze fresh lemon over when they come off the grill.

Refreshing!! My husband made this for my birthday dinner, served it with couscous and steamed asparagus. What a perfect herb and citrus combination for the lamb chops! A nice break from the mediterranean-rosemary-thyme marinade that you see frequently with lamb. This is my easy go-to recipe for lamb chops from now on.

Another perfect recipe from Bon Appetit. I used loin chops as they were half the price of the rib chops. Like others, I only had five-six hours before grilling. They were fabulous...

I just returned from Portland Or. visiting our daughter. Spent Saturday morning at the Farmers Market downtown. Bought the Lamb there and all the other Herbs. Wanted to serve it that evening so only marinated for 7 or 8 hours and it was wonderful. Served it with the tzatzki and fresh roasted asparagus. Don't let this pass you by if you love lamb. Enjoy

This is by far the best Lamb recipe I have ever made. Wonderful!

I didn't have any mint. This is a four-star recipe even without it. In fact, I can envision reserving the mint for the tzaziki. Following the suggestion of another reviewer, I mixed the shallots, garlic, herbs, salt and sugar with olive oil, lemon, juice, and zest. I grilled half of the chops after four hours of marinating----delicious---and served them with baba ganoush and sauteed zucchini sprinkled with feta cheese. I grilled the rest of the chops the next day---still delicious and just a little more flavorful. They were also good cold for lunch. I wish I had had time to make the whole menu; maybe next Easter. These would be great hors d'oeurves for a cocktail party.

Excellent! Exactly what I was looking for in a recipe for lamb chops! Made it as directed, turned out perfectly. Cooked slightly longer as we like lamb a bit more "done" than rare. Was a hit with our neighbors for Easter luncheon!

Perfect! The only change was that I had to use loin chops, but the flavor was just wonderful! My family loves lamb and this will be my "go to" recipe for lamb chops from now on!

This is my new favorite recipe for preparing lamb. I was going to go the "cheap route" and buy shoulder chops (the o-bone kind) but couldn't find any decent cuts so I went with the riblets as specified...it made for a fantastically delicious and easy meal. I paired it with roast asparagus and roasted radishes (with brown butter, radish tops and lemon) and a salad. Flavorful and light Easter dinner.

Made this yesterday and didn't start until 1pm. Only marinated for 5 hrs, but outcome was very nice. Overnight would be even better. Used center-cut lamb chops, so grill time was much longer. Will make a tzatziki next time and serve w/Greek sides. Look fwd to making this one again soon!

The recipe instructions call for a tablespoon of salt to be added to the marinade,but there is no reference to the salt in the list of ingredients. If anyone has any insight into whether the salt is intended to be part of the marinade,I would appreciate hearing from them as I am about the make the marinade! Thanks.

I made this recipe with lamb shoulder chops, from a local farm, instead of rib chops and my husband and I both thought the flavor was outstanding. We will definitely make it again when we have more good lamb.

The flavours in this marinade are phenomenal!!! I mixed all the herbs, garlic, shallots, oil, zest and juice together and marinated lamb leg steaks for about 6 hours and the result was absolutely superb. Otherwise followed the recipe as written. Highly recommended.

Made this with loin chops instead of rib chops because I did not want to butcher a rack, but the results were fantastic. The cooking time is a little longer, but the flavors were well worth the extra cooking time. I made a full recipe for 12 chops, which was just about right. I would not change a thing and will be making this again and again. I did not make tzatziki, but will try that next time.

I loved this recipe. I always am changing recipes, but this one is perfect.
