The cookies turned out very good but were very complicated. Also, I made the cookies too big so be careful to get the right size cookie cutter.

These cookies are delectable! They are so popular now with my family and friends ever since I started making them every Christmas. The first time I made them, I had one relative surprised that they were homemade and not store bought. They make an impressive presentation as well as being delicious.

So much work! But oh so yummy! As others said, I had way too much ganache and will cut back on it next time. I'd also make the wafers smaller than I did. And the dough needed returning to the refrigerator multiple times to firm up. Delicious. Definitely a cookie to make while on vacation though.

This is the most high maintenance cookie I have made, but it is also the most delicious and the one most raved about. It is so worth all of the time and effort. After all, I only make them once a year at the holidays!

These are very time consuming, but well worth it. I continue to make them every year for cookie platters. They really do look great and they are always a favorite. Delicious!!

the dough after chill was too soft so I suspect the amount of flour should slightly increase. if you have all the time in the world make these cookies. Also I found the did not yield the number quoted and therefore take way too much time for the quantity.

These were everyone's favorite cookie last christmas. I ended up having to make them 3-4 seperate times because of all the requests. I didn't use a cookie cutter at all. I just rolled the dough into a log about 2" in diameter and cut enough 1/8" slices to to fill the baking sheet, then put the dough back into the frige while they were baking. Sometimes the shape wasn't perfectly uniform but no one seemed to mind and it cut down on a lot of the work.

These cookies are dynamite to eat and impressive to look at! I have made them a number of times and everyone always raves about them. They are VERY rich, fairly time-consuming, and definitely messy, but if you like a project (and chocolate), these cookies are for you. The cookies do tend to spread a bit when you make them and the butter does seep out so don't skip the parchment, which soaks up some of the grease and keeps the cookies from spreading excessively. (On one occasion, having run out of parchment, I used brown paper grocery store bags; they worked very well, maybe even better than the parchment!

The recipe got rave reviews, and presents nicely. I had about a third of the ganache leftover. Although the cookies take a long-time to prepare, I'll make them for special occasions in the future.

This recipe was the first cut-out recipe I have tried. The cookies did get a little larger upon cooking, but this was not an issue. They held their shape well. However, I made some of the cookies too thin. The flavor over all was nice. They were not spectacular. I made about 1/2 of the chocolate and that was plenty. For all the effort, I will most likely not make this recipe again.

Time consuming - yes. Rave reviews - too many to count. Second time I made these, I reduced the sugar a little and substituted some apple sauce for the butter - came out lighter in colour and did not spread while baking, still yummy. Had 1/3 ganache left over.

Great cookies. The dough does spread when baking. I re-cut the cookies as soon as they come out of the oven. This ensures perfectly shaped cookies that are all the same size.

These cookies were time-consuming and difficult to make. That said, I doubled the recipe and my guests ate them up. In fact, I wish I had made more (if only I'd had the time...) I used fun-shaped cookie cutters and used the chocolate to decorate, the cookies were beautiful and tasty. Isn't that always the way with time-intensive recipes?

These were delicious and incredibly popular. I doubled the recipe for a party with 30 people and ran out of cookies way too early on. The cookies are incredibly time consuming, and I found they came out ok without the extra step of chilling the dough again after shaping the cookies.

The cookies are YUMMY!! Baked this cookies several times already. The only changes that I made were to reduce the amount of sugar and butter a little bit. Make about 35 cookies. I also broke out the steps so they are not too time consuming. Baked the cookies the day before and filled and dipped them the next day.

Taste great. Made about 25 cookies. Used only half the ganache and had some left. Only problem was w/baking..they spread in oven, so no matter what size cutter I used, they were huge and lost their shape.

I made these cookies twice - the first time I made them as the recipe directed and it required alot of time and energy. The second time I made them I bypassed the ganache and just dipped single cookies in the chocolate and almonds. They looked great, took less time and were even tastier - I think the ganache almost made them too rich.

I've been making these cookies since I seen them in the magazine the are just great...

While a little on the high maintenance side, these little confections were most delicious. I made them for a cookie exchange (with 15 other bakers) and these were the cookie to have. I noticed however, that I ended up with a ton of ganache but was a little short on the chocolate for dipping the cookies into afterwards.

Chocolate was a bit bitter - would use sweeter next time. Took a little longer than planned but was well received! Only got 20 cookie sandwiches out of batter. Little Miss Baker

I used heart-shaped cookie cutters and this made about 20 cookies. There was nearly a cup of filling leftover, so I remelted it and used it for the dipping, too. I would recommend both toasting and chopping the almonds much more finely; leaving them in raw slivers didn't work for me. If I make these again, I suspect I'll stir a bit of almond extract into the chocolate to intensify the flavor.

Everyone is right - definitely a lot of work. However the finished product is beautiful and great for the holidays. For almond lovers - I accidently put the 1.25 cups of almonds in the batter instead of the .25 it called for -- a liitle dry, but it worked. They turned out great, but they do break up a little when bitten into. Tip: after cutting the cookies out put the dough in the freezer for a little while, they come off the paper much easier than when refrigerated.

This recipe is a lot of work, but every time I make it, people ooh and aah over the finished product. Definitely a good recipe, but only make them if you are not constrained for time.

I thought these cookies were delicious but also had trouble with the dough. I'll try them again using the suggestions of the others.

Although this recipe was a bit challenging to work with, the compliments I got for it made it all worthwhile. I doubled the recipe, added some more flour when I rolled out the cookies, and left them a little thicker so they wouldn't fall apart when I transferred them. I didn't think they tasted so special, but everyone else really loved them. I served them at a party, and sent some to a relative's party, and I have gotten rave reviews from everyone who tried them.

These cookies are good, but they are messy and take a while to put together. I prefer thinner cookies, so I'd rather just dip each single cookie in the chocolate & almonds and skip the filling part.

This was too much work for just a okay tasting cookie-it seemed to harden up too fast and wasn't really soft and chewy, what I like.

I haven't made these yet, but I have a suggestion for an alternative to letting the dough reach room temperature before rolling. I have made similar cookies in the past. Before chilling, I form the dough into a big cube. When it comes time to roll it out, I slice off a half-inch slab at a time of the chilled dough, leaving the rest in the fridge. It is very easy to roll out such a thin piece. If you keep the tray with cut ready-to-bake pieces in the fridge while rolling out the rest, every piece stays chilled.

The dough is a bit tricky to work with. Definately a better recipe to make in the winter b/c you can keep putting the dough outside to cool off. Of course having an empty refrigerator will work too. I added more flour when I rolled and that made it easier to cut out the cookies, also I dipped the cutter in flour. My family went wild over this recipe. My husband had to make a rule that each could have only one cookie at a sitting! I've had to hide them so they'll last more than a day. I also doubled this recipe. Also next time I'll cut the cookie smaller. Very rich. I used the chocolate filling also for the outside dip. And instead of walnuts I used pecans.

This is my new favorite cookie recipe. It is a bit of extra work, but oh so worth it! This cookie vanished almost immediately! The ganache is rich but wonderful. The cookie itself is quite tasty too and holds up well to the filling. I used round cutters since I didn't have oval ones, and it still looked beautiful. This is a definite keeper!

Speak for your own grandmother, Erica from Milwaukee. Both of my grandmothers make the most delicious cookies. I would be disappointed if I didn't have the opportunity to munch them down at the holidays and throughout the year. Lucky, lucky me!!

I made these cookies as part of my menu for a cocktail party and they were a hit. I decided to change the recipe to fit my favorite cookie . . .white chocolate-macadamia nut. I just switched the nuts and chocolate, wow were they great. Very rich & delicious, definatly not the boring cookings your gradma makes.

Rating: 3
Although these cookies were labor intensive the end result is wonderful. I find them a little to rich for my taste but my fiance, who loves chocolate and nuts, loves them. Don't be stupid like me - after refrigerating the dough allow yourself enough time in your schedule for it to come to room temperature to be able to roll it out.

If your looking for RAVE REVIEWS this is the receipe. I made the dough and refrigerated it 2 days before baking. I used waxed paper on top and bottom of dough to roll out. No problems there. I also used a round scalloped edge cookie cutter. Very cute, crushed candy canes and dipped the finished cookie into that instead of nuts. Labor intense,also I think next time I will not share the oven with both trays of cookies. 1 sheet seemed browned slightly, the other not. I added 2-3 more minutes of cooking time.

The final result of these cookies was a very decorative and tasty treat. I gave these cookies as gifts and have received such praise, that I will make another batch this season. Although, the preparation is time consuming and involves numerous steps.
