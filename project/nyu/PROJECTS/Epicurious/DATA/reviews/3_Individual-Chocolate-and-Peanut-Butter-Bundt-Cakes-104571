these were really really good! I tried them to see if they would be a good bake sale item, and that's a definite yes. nice and moist, and not overly sweet. the chocolate cake part by itself is also a winner.

After reading the mixed reviews, took a chance on these because the ingredients sound delicious! But they turned out just okay - a little dry and not very sweet. Definitely not as decadent as they sound, although cutting back the baking time helps. Overall not worth the effort and ingredients.

After reviewing the previous reviews, I increased the chocolate & sour cream a smidgeon (1 oz) and decreased the flour (by 1/2 cup) in the cake, not the peanut butter and used 6 mini bundt tins and still had batter left to make a bundt cake too! So super moist!! Had to bake a bit longer and used a scoop instead of the plastic bag to layer chocolate then the peanut butter. Oh yeah, still used lots of bowls, won't make this often, but it is a winner!

I'm in culinary school for pastry and tried this recipe as I was thinking about incorporating it into a plated dessert. They came out dry and flavorless - nobody in the class liked them at all. The peanut butter mixture started releasing its oils from all the fat before I even baked them, and after it was baked they were very hard almost cookie-like on the outside yet not cooked on the inside. The chocolate cake part was alright but not quite sweet enough and dry as well. Not recommended at all.

These bundt cakes were amazing! The chocolate cake was exceptional. They were moist and very dense. Everyone I served them to loved them, including several friends who are not the biggest dessert fans. I served them with whipped cream and fresh raspberries. I made some in mini bundt cake molds that cooked in the suggested time, and some in muffin tins that took about 10 minutes longer. Their pretty dense, so the cupcake style needs more time for the heat to distribute all the way through. I will definitely be making these again.

I was staying over at a friend who never bakes, so we thought it would be fun to bake something together. Unfortunately, we chose this recipe. I should've listened to the other reviews that said it wasn't good, but I didn't. So I warn the rest of the people reading the reviews to heed them: these muffins were terrible! (And they weren't even better the next day.)

This is the second time I've made these little cakes, and everybody always loves them, serve warm with vanilla gelato!!!!

I thought this was a great recipe! I served this over the weekend with a scoop of vanilla and topped with hot fudge. Everyone LOVED them and finished every last bite. I expected the peanut butter to be smooth, rather than cakelike, so I will try to it next time with less flour.

This recipe was a sort of a clunker. Too dry for my taste and not all that interesting in terms of flavor. It did not live up to its potential!

They taste good, but nothing that spectacular, especially considering all that's in them--cream cheese, sour cream, butter, 2 kinds of chocolate--they sort of just seemed like rich brownies in a different form. Also, fairly time consuming to make. It was sort of funt to experiment with the placing of the peanut butter filling though... But won't make again.

I love the Reese's combo of peanut butter and chocolate, so I eagerly tried out this recipe. I have to say I was disappointed--it was OK, not great. I won't bother making it again.

This wasn't as difficult to make as I thought it would be, but the result wasn't as wonderful as I had hoped. It was very good fresh out of the oven. I didn't care for it as much the next day.

The instructions were too complicated for their own good. Next time I will know where to cut corners. The baking time was incorrect too. It took twice as long to bake in muffin tins. Peanut butter center recipe should be halved. Luckily, they were a hit with my guests and I love peanut butter and chocolate. They improve with age and vanilla ice cream. Note: butter the pans by melting butter and brushing the tins.

This recipe sounded better then it really was. I made the cakes in muffin tins which worked fine. The cakes turned out dry. I think this recipe would be better as a bundt cake.

I found this to be a more-complicated-than-necessary recipe for a "snack food" and I couldn't get them out of mini bundts or muffin tins. Was I missing something? Also, they took longer to cook than the recipe indicated. For a similar result, I would make a half batch of the filling, then spoon into my own favorite chocolate cupcake recipe - and I'd use cupcake papers!

This recipe sounds delicious. Is it possible to make it in one large bundt pan, and if so, how long would the baking time be?

I made these for a Super Bowl party and they were a hit. As indicated, they improve after 1-2 days, so they're a great make ahead. Used both large muffin pans and the mini bundt pans called for; both worked fine but the bundts were prettiest. Pastry or plastic bags make it fast!

These were fairly easy, I halved the recipe and used muffin tins (1 pan for 6 large muffins and 1 pan for 6 small muffins). I used plastic bags instead of a pastry bag, and I found piping the batter both speedy & neat. I would make these for a casual event, kids, or for snacking.
