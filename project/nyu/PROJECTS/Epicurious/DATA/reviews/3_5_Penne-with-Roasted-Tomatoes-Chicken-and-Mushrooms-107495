Needed a quick lunch. This was easy and very tasty. I used whole wheat rigatoni and added a pinch of crushed red pepper. We like things kind of spicy here in Texas. I used good quality parm and feta. The flavor was really good and not at all bland.

Just returned from a trip to Italy. Fantastic food! We purchased some high quality ingredients such as olive oil and parmesan and were looking for a recipe that would be worthy of them. This fits the bill. Use the best you have and this recipe will be great. Only thing I changed is to add some black olives.

This was bland and lacking flavor. We ate it, but it wasn't anything I'd make again.

One of our favorite weeknight recipes. I use grape tomatoes and roast them whole. Other changes are 1 lb of whole wheat penne, 1/2 yellow onion (sliced) and regular mushrooms. Delicious and so easy!

Rating: 4
A touch bland. Feta is a great idea. No need to roast tomatoes, diced tomatoes from can are more than good enough. Takes a little more mushrooms than called for as they reduce in size. Will use a lot from now on!

I really liked this dish very simple yet delicious. I can see where people think it was a bit bland because I did feel the need to season alot. But what I seen was that the chicken was the one that gathered the most flavor. So next time I suggest adding the wine and broth and incorporating the cheese first then add the pasta so it gathers the flavor. Then continue adding everything else and leave the chicken for last. My mom also had a great suggestion of adding capers, which I think would definitly add a little kick to it

YUM!! This was delicious pasta! I used chopped onions instead of green onions, and skipped the chicken broth (since I didn't have any on hand)and added an extra splash of wine. I think that the feta cheese really added to the flavor of this dish. I will definitely be making it again!

I thought this was lacking in flavor, even though I grilled the tomatoes and chicken, added arugula, and crushed red pepper. My finicky husband liked it, but not sure he will get it again.

I make this recipe all the time. I also roast the shrooms and a whole clove of garlic with olive oil, rosemary, pepper, sea salt, and crushed red pepper, to add to the sauce! I like greens, so I throw in arugula or spinach at the very end. It is just heavenly! Thanks for the recipe!

In addition to the tomatoes, I roasted a whole clove of garlic and all the mushrooms with olive oil, rosemary, pepper, sea salt, and crushed red pepper. It tastes like heaven!

Oh yummy!!! I was a little short on feta so I used the full cup of parmesan, plenty of pepper, and 5 cloves of garlic total. My balsamic vinegar leaked onto the pasta from my salad and was so good that we started sprinkling it on the pasta itself. Delicious!

Excellent! We used whole wheat penne (awesome), and 5 cloves of garlic ... we'll add more mushrooms next time ...

Wonderful - made this for some friends, and we all enjoyed it! I substituted tomatoes for a can of whole tomoatoes w/ basil. Turned out really well. Also added fresh spinach towards the end of the cooking and used about half the parmesan. Very easy and full of flavor. Definitely one to keep when you need a quick meal!

The first time I made this, I thought it was very promising but just a little bland. On the second try, I reduced the cheese by almost half and increased the mushroom mixture and the tomatoes a bit. Excellent! One of the few dishes everyone in my family can love!

Excellent....very quick, perfect for children, really accurate on the timing....20 minutes from start to finish tops!! I also, did not do the roasting of the tomatoes, but rather did the diced tomatoes in the can...and next time would even consider getting the ones in the can that already had the spices to even simplify more....fantastic

A keeper! I substituted a can of diced tomatoes (added them and the oregano after adding back the mushroom mixture) and only used 8 oz of pasta. Will probably cut parmesan in 1/2 next time. Easy, quick and tons of flavor.

I used a very large shallot instead of the green onions. It was delicious.

This is an easy, delicious dish. I had boneless, skinless breasts instead of tenders which I sliced into strips. I used about twice as much broth and wine and I added a bag of baby spinach for the last few minutes of cooking.

This was excellent and easy to make. I used leftover breast meet from a roasted chix and turned up the white wine and tossed with 16oz. of penne---we're fighting over the leftovers tonite!

When people ask for seconds, you know it's a hit! This was pretty easy to make and didn't take very much time. I added some asparagus and a touch of cream to give it a richer taste during a chilly October night and I think it turned out well. I also prepped the chicken with additional seasoning to give it a little extra kick since my family is big on spicy flavor. Dusting the chicken with cayenne pepper gave it just the right boost.

Very good recipe. I added just a bit more wine and chicken broth along with fresh asparagus. This is a keeper for our family of 4.

Very good and quite simple to make. I used a regular brown onion instead of green onions and used a little sherry vinegar instead of the wine. Both changes seemed to incorporate well. My family loved this, I will certainly make it again.

Incredible. I did not have portabellas so I used regular mushrooms and it was just fine. I made this dish for my husband and then went to a meeting, when I got home he had eaten everything!!

Rating: 4
Thought this was delicious and very fast! I am also a busy mom and try to create meals that my kids (5 and 6) will like, especially healthy ones like this. One addition to try with this recipe is to add several (4 or more, depending on your tastes) handfuls of fresh baby spinach leaves to the just-drained pasta (put it back in your cooking pot). Toss a bit to wilt the spinach and then you can transfer it to the collander while you make the rest of the recipe. The spinach reduces quite a bit and the kids don't mind its addition at all. This recipe with or without the spinach is a keeper in this crazy household!

This was easy and very tasty. Next time I will add a little more stock and wine to make it "saucier". Also to save time, I would saute the mushroom mixture and then the chicken in a separate skillet while the penne is cooking, rather than letting the cooked penne sit in the colander while using the same pan.

Rating: 3
Very tasty, but not nearly enough tomatoes. I would make again, but I would use twice the tomatoes, and more portabellos while I'm at it. The sauce is delicious with both the parmesan and feta cheeses. Very easy for a weeknight meal (although next time I'll skip roasting the tomatoes and used drained diced), and I would certainly serve for a casual meal for company.

If you are looking for a quick meal that's attractive, good tasting, and filling, this is it. If you are looking for a dish to impress your company, keep looking.

Liked this recipe, but made some alterations to separate out the flavors a bit. Instead of mixing in the chicken, I grilled the breast separately and served it sliced on top of the pasta and sauce. Also made the stock 1/4 c. instead of 1/2 c. For the off season, I used the tomatoes from a can of organic whole tomatoes. I tore them in half with my fingers, took out the seeds, and baked them as directed. 1 1/2 to 2 cans (28 oz) was the perfect amount of tomatoes.

I thought this was great. I think the only reason that some reviewers may not have considered it suitable for company is that when it is in a big pot it doesn't look special. In an individual bowl it looks fine (particularly with a bit of parmesan and some chopped basil). A few changes I made: roasted a few garlic cloves with tomatoes instead of sauteeing in oil (I put them in mini-chopper for a second after roasting); added chopped leftover chicken thigh meat at the end of the cooking process (no problem); added fresh basil at the end (thankfully a friend had just harvested her last batch of the season). Not as quick as I was expecting, but good.

This was a wonderful dinner that my family enjoyed! I added black olives and capers, and used light feta to cut down on calories.

Good, solid family food. I've made this dish several times, and use a creamy danish feta that really smooths out the sauce. Not great for entertaining, but good for comfort food.

Rating: 3
GOOOOOOOD! I had a leftover chicken breast, so shredded it up and added at the end with the tomatoes. Easy peasy, too. The tomatoes can be roasted in advance, and I'm just thinking of lots of ways to use them, and lots of different herbs to roast them with. The only thing lacking was something green in it; next time I think I'll add brocolli.

This is a really nice meal and you can experiment a lot if you want to. The roasted tomatoes are full of flavor. I have made this twice and will keep on making it as everyone that has tasted it has been impressed.

Great recipe! My fiancee thought it was so good! I omitted the feta cheese, but next time i make this i will add it. My fiancee didnt really like the mushrooms and i hate mushrooms so i think i will leave those out next time! With some tweaking i think this could be a great addition to my dinner rotation!

This came out great! The roasted tomatoes added a fabulous flavor. I follwoed the recipe but used a little less feta. I used a good wine and cheese and very fresh portobellos. My husband who is a tough crowd to please loved it too. I will make this again without a doubt.

very good. we didn't have portobello 'shrooms so used button. Well worth the effort and calories. (and there are a LOT of calories...)

This was delicious! I will definitely be making it again. I followed the recipe as written, but made a few modifications. :) It was served with a green salad and rosemary focaccia. 1.) I used a 16oz. bag of pasta so I increased the liquid - 3/4 of chicken broth and just under 1/2 cup of wine. 2.) I seasoned the chicken w/ poultry seasoning before cooking. 3.) I used herbed feta instead of plain - it gave it an extra boost of flavor 4.) I added a few sprinkles of red pepper flakes

Rating: 3
My husband is not a huge fan of feta cheese, so I substituted goat cheese, and skipped the oregano on the tomatoes and added chopped fresh basil at the end instead. Try adding a little of the water from the cooked pasta...it helps thicken the sauce slightly. We would make this again...if you roast the tomatoes ahead of time (try the oven-roasted tomato recipe on this site), it's pretty easy to assemble as a quick afterwork meal.

Rating: 3
This recipe is really delicious and easy to make. I made a couple of changes and it still tasted great. First, instead of roasting the tomatoes I reconstitute some sun-dried tomatoes and add those. This cuts down on time but adds a nice flavor. Second, instead of green onions I've used regular white onions, simply chopped. Third, I like to add capers. These alterations and additions don't hurt the recipe at all, and I've gotten great feedback from those who've tried it. I love it!

This is a delicious vegetarian recipe without the chicken. I also tried roasting red bell peppers with the tomatoes and may try other vegetables the next time. My teen aged sons loved this and I will definitely make it again.

Fabulous dish. I brought it to a pot luck dinner my friend was hosting and I was the only one who left with an empty platter! The only caveat is that the cheese tends to clump in spots and is not always evenly distributed -- however the sauce adds enough flavor throughout to compensate.

I'm just getting ready to make this dish this evening. It was delicious last time I made it about a month ago. My husband is not a huge cheese lover, so I did use less feta and less Parmesean (about 1/2-3/4 cup of each). It worked out great! Definite keeper!

This was a simple and tasty recipe. Roasting the tomatoes brought out flavor even in the blandest of winter tomatoes. Definately a keeper - the taste is worthy of a company meal, but easy and quick enough for a weeknight dinner.

This recepe was very easy and quick to make, and tasted OK. The mushrooms were extremely tasty, however, I found this dish very rich due to the amount of cheese that goes into it (perhaps "light" feta would have been a good substitute. I was quite disappointed with the roasted tomoatos as the flavour was overpowered by the cheese, and it did not add the "tangy" flavour to the dish. Not a dish I would serve for a dinner party.

This was easy to make, and very good. My coworkers helped me finish the leftovers and everyone liked it. Instead of portabello mushrooms, I used something I already had on hand which was a wild mushroom blend (pre-sliced) and that worked out fine.

Yummy! exclaimed my picky 8yr. old Hannah, brother stevie gobbled this up as well-they compared it to alfredo, I liked this because the sauce base did not have all the butter and cream-roasting the tomatoes added a depth and richness to the sauce-not quite a "guest" dish-4 forks for family dining-we'll make this again! we used the finest parm reggiano and feta-really fab.

This was very very good! I asked my husband how many points and he said 3. If I didn't make so many dishes off this site, I'm sure he would have said 4. I'm not sure I would make it for guests but it hit the spot tonight and I will make it again. The house smells wonderful!

This is an easy and elegant recipe with a gourmet taste that will appeal to a broad range of palates. It's perfect for a casual dinner party or everyday. I used about 3/4 cup parmesan cheese and stirred it in gradually with no clumping problems. Otherwise I didn't change a thing. This is going in the permanent file!

I think I'd cut back on the parmesan to 1/2 cup. The dish was a bit too dense and dry after the cheese was added. My friend and I enjoyed the dish, however, and I'd definitely make it again.

This recipe sounded wonderful, even started to taste wonderful, until I put all the ingredients together. Everything except the pasta stuck together! If I were to ever make this again, I would put the Feta & The Parmesan cheese on the side. I think then it would be a great dish! Give yourself plenty of time, this dish takes some time to prepare!

With wonderful ingredients like these, how could this not be great? Very easy to prepare and colorful too. I served this with a healthy salad and crusty bread with dipping oil. My neighbor was my guinee pig and absolutely loved it. She asked for a copy of the recipe. Looking forward to making it for more guests.

This is serious "comfort food", cheesy & dense. I expanded the recipe by 50% to serve six. Judging by the amount leftover, the "as-is" recipe will easily satisfy six. I served the pasta with a green salad and crusty french bread alongside. Everyone enjoyed it. Note: this recipe is not for those watching their weight.

This was delicious and not difficult to prepare. Since I'm on Weight Watchers, I made small modifications to cut down on some of the fat and calories: cut the 5 tablespoons of oil to 2, 10 ounces of pasta instead of 12, 1/2 lb chicken tenders rather than 3/4, cut the feta from 4 oz to 3 and used 3/4 cup parmesan instead of 1.
