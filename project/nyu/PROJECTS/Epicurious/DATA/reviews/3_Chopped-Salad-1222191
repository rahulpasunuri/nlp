Not bad and fairly easy to make. It does make a lot though. I followed the other reviewer's suggestion and added an extra tablespoon of lemon juice and I replaced the cider vinegar with red wine vinegar. I also added some red pepper for color.

Easier to make than you might think, a lot of the prep and cooking time can happen at the same time. It makes a HUGE amount of salad - ten generous servings. I'll be eating it for a week, but I'm not sure how a person would go about reducing it. Next time I make it I will amp up the vinaigrette, either make more or add another tablespoon of lemon juice to make it brighter. Great texure, color.
