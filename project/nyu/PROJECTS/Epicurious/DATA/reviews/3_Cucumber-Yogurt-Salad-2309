I liked this recipe, but deleted the sugar and added about 5 oz. of sour cream. I mixed it all together and let it sit in the fridge for about an hour.

If you are making this recipe ahead of time (the recipe says you can make it 2 hours ahead) and would like to avoid it becoming watery....simply mix the yogurt with the sugar, salt and any spices you may be using ( like roasted ground cumin) and refrigerate. Chop up the cucumbers, cover and refrigerate separately. When ready to serve, simply add the cucumbers to the yogurt, mix and serve. When the cucumber is allowed to stand in the yogurt for a long time, the sugar and salt tend to cook the cucumber and release its juices making it watery. And remember that yogurt is a tenderiser too. This is the reason why it is so often used to marinate different meats. With added yogurt this recipe makes a raita. But since it claims to be a salad you could add boiled potatoes, blanched sweet corn, peas, grated carrots etc. Simply treat the yogurt mix like a dressing.

This very plain recipe needs some spice to perk it up, perhaps the mint, some cilantro or garlic powder would help. Very bland.

Great! I used a processor to get the cucumber finely chopped, so the dish had the consistency of a creamy chutney. Also added a bit of mint per the earlier hint. A big hit with the guests.

I was afraid this would be "watery" because I had to make it ahead, but seeding the cucumbers must be the trick with this. Not watery, not difficult, not fattening. What's not to like?

This is about as easy as it gets. very light and refreshing. great for hot summer days. However, I would use more cucumbers (maybe just large ones) and a little less yogurt. Also, some chopped fresh mint is a nice addition.

This made the perfect side dish along with the curried chicken. It was light and delicious and really balance out the overall flavors of the meal. Also - it's a snap to make!
