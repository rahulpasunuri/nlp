Loved this with a few changes. I didn't peel the potatoes and left them to boil for 8 minutes. Was generous with the cheese. I didn't have an egg, so I melted 3 T butter, whisked in 3 T flour and slowly whisked in the milk. Cooked until browned on top. It got nice and crispy on top. Will do this again as it was quick and delicious.

I made this as directed but somehow what should have been a creamy sauce turned into scrambled-egg-like clumps. It was unappealing to the eye and bland, to boot. I "saved" it by baking for another 15 minutes to soften the potatoes, then adding milk and extra cheese and mashing it all into mashed potatoes.

I've made this before, but this time added 2 sliced leeks to the mixture. Also added more cheese. Leftovers were great as hashbrowns for breakfast the next day.

EAsy. Next tome I will cut down a bit on the liquid. Maybe by about a 1/4 cup or so. Very nice dish. Simplw flavors. Doesn't overwhelm the other foods.

Never made a gratin with an egg--now I know why. This would have been better with a bechamel sauce. Even added bay leaf and nutmeg to infuse the sauce but it was not worth it. Reserve your gruyere for another use.

I really think these potatoes were delicious! I did add more cheese and I didn't add egg,I added flour to the milk to thicken the sauce. I buttered the baking dish heavily and salt and peppered liberally. Was not bland!!! Next time I will try it with the egg,sounds even richer! I served it the the lamb suggested on this site.

Noting the problems previous chefs had, I made some modifications. As I was serving 8, I quadrupled the potatos and the Gruyere, added parmesan and garlic, and used only two eggs for 4 cups milk. I tripled the boiling time and doubled the baking time, allowed the dish to cool and reheated later, topped with breadcrumbs, and the result was fantastic! A great way to make gratin without butter. The longer it sat, the more it absorbed the flavor. Better as a "made-ahead" dish.

Agree with previous reviewer. Potatoes do not absorb the cheese, the milk does and you have gobs of milk/cheese along with bland potatoes. Doesn't taste that bad if you keep your eyes closed.

We made several additions to this recipe. We doubled the cheese, added the shavings of one black truffle and added approximately one half teaspoon of freshly grated nutmeg. It was a hit!!!!!

Don't know why some found it bland. It does tell you to add salt and pepper to taste. We had it with the Rack of Lamb with Caramelized Shallot & Thyme Crust, and Stir-fried Spinach with Ginger & Garlic. It was a wonderful meal to celebrate our grandaughter's fifth birthday.

Good but not right. I agree with Maggie that it was bland... need to add more spices. Also, when cooked I could see and taste pockets of egg... not what I wanted in my potatoes!

This gratin is delicious, though next time I'd add a bit more cheese. I also added a slight sprinkling of cayeene, which was delightful!

This recipe was OK but we found it very bland, even with alot of salt&pepper.
