I used wheat bread and 2 teaspoons of dried sage. I thought the sandwiches were easy and delicious, especially when paired with the asparagus soup with lemon creme fraiche.

Good flavor but I used Challah and did think the texture was quite spongey. I placed finely minced sage on the tomato-not in egg.

The mediocre taste does not justify the amount of fat in this sandwich. One might be well-advised to put the fresh sage leaves, a nice touch, on top of the tomatoes and eat the sandwich uncooked or press or grill it without the egg batter on a slightly greased grill.

Make sure fresh sage is finely chopped. Easy; great for supper!

Quick and delicious, although not exactly healthy. Great presentation, too (thanks to Boby from Matthews, NC, for mentioning that the bread should be browned - I had to turn the heat up a bit for that and it made all the difference).

This recipe has become a favorite at my house. It's easy and quick to prepare and it is DELICIOUS! Perfect for a work night meal.

Very satisfying even for a meat lover as myself. Substituted the milder Deli-Style mustard per my individual preference. Prepared this recipe twice this week and will make it in the future for guests. The browned egg dipped bread makes for an attractive and appetizing presentation.

I have been reading the magazine for years and just started using the interent for cooking. This was an easy recipe to make. I had no sage, so I used instead some Italian seasoning and the meal turned out wonderful. Very easy to make and being single meant that I could easily halve the recipe for myself. I encourage all to try the recipe for it's easiness and quickness. Plus with only two pans to clean you are out of the kitchen in no time flat. I look forward to trying more recipes.
