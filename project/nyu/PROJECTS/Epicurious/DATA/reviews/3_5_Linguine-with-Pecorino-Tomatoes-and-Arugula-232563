Loved this. I used rotini and chopped the arugula before marinating it in the olive oil mixture.

Roasted the tomatoes tossed with olive oil and garlic at 400 for 15 min. let them cool a bit. Used spinach pasta noodles and tossed everything together. SO YUM!

Great summer dish, especially on a hot night. I just used grape tomatoes that I cut in half to keep it really simple, and halved the amount of tomatoes. When I made it in the past, I used 6 cups of mixed and that worked fine too. Great recipe

I thought this recipe was easy to put together and the flavors worked well together. Be sure to use the best ingredients that you can find.

I won't make this again. Although it certainly wasn't bad, I thought the proportions were way off. I used a pound of pasta and was left with a TON of tomaotes and juice. Just thought it was a bit acidic and juicy.

Classic. Simple. Used garlic instead of shallot. Enjoyed by all.

I agree with Mary from Milwaukee. Delete the comments that deal with the incorrect ingredients. Editors are human, too! This dish is great! It's a quick meal, good for weeknights. The flavors blend well together. Store-bought, pre-washed arugula makes this a breeze. Crisp the greens in cold water for 30 minutes while you prep the rest. I used pecorino and fresh tomatoes from the garden. Perfect August/September meal!

First thing I want to say is the negative reviews based on a previously incorrect recipe should be removed. That said this dish makes a wonderfully flavor summer side dish.

This recipe was really good, very different from pasta I usually make. I used a combo of heirloom and cherry tomatoes, and served it exactly as suggested, with some grilled italian sausages and a bottle of pinot noir, yum! Will def be making this again, husband and friend already requesting it:-)

This was so simple but SO good. Tomatoes in season made it excellent. I salted the pasta water but it didn't need any other salt.

Fantastic! Good pecorino is essential. It was a big hit with company- i added a clove of garlic and 1/4 tsp. sugar.

We had this for dinner last night - so tasty. We cut the recipe in half for the two of us and there was more than enough. We used the Pecorino Romano and it was delicious.

Substituted spinach for the arugula and used freshly grated parmesan cheese. Loved it as did my husband and coworkers.

the recipe as it appears in Bon appetite is right. This is wrong. There is no orrechiete in Bon appetit version. this is a great recipe. it's a shame that its wrong here.

The recipe has some obvious errors - focus on the ingredients and reasonable proportions. Don't use liguini and certailnyl do not use uncooked orichiette If you get past these - a very good dish Agree - the proefreader messed up

Please consider this my application as recipe proofreader. Duh

Yo! Who's doing the proof reading at Bon Appetit? Apart from that it's a good end of summer dish. Serve it with or grilled salmon or chicken and it's a winner!

Too much pasta! And I would add a sprinkling of pancetta or prosciutto.

I would hope that if you combine the first five ingredients as the recipe states. I would have to conclude this would be a very crunchy dish, because this recipe states no where to cook the orecchiette. Yummy!

How did those sneaky ears get past the proof-readers? Good thing we know when something doesn't "look right" - the dish is otherwise GREAT!

Orechiette or linguine? It is possible to replace argula with mozzarella and basil.

Rating: 0
Huh? Is the orecchiette really supposed to be in there?

Rating: 0
I'm assuming the first ingredient listed (1 pound orecchiette) is an error?

Rating: 0
Think there is a mistake in the instructions. The first step is to mix the first five ingredients but one of them is a pound of uncooked pasta. Think this is just a typo since there is another pasta -the linguini-mentioned later. FYI

I believe the first ingredient (Orchiette) is a mistake!!

Excellent summer pasta dish. I have made it numerous times.delicious combination of flavors, with the summer tomatoes, peppery arugula, and pecorino (I used some of each-ricotta salata and pecorino romano. The whole recipe makes a ton, but it is even good as leftovers.

Excellent summer pasta dish. The cheese sounded like a lot, but it was perfect...used the pecorino.
