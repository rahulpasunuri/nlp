Excellent. I put it over some rice with a little hot pepper mixed in, which was perfect.

This was a quick and delicious recipe. I had little time, and some green beans in the fridge that had to be used. I added some a grated carrot because I didn't have all the tomatoes the recipe calls for. The result was great: light and tasty. I made it for dinner along with pasta and my hubbie was very pleased!

This recipe was modified by cooking the green beans in boiling salted water for one minute and then immediately plunging them in a bowl of ice water. The crunchy texture worked well with the rest of the recipe as written.

This dish was outstanding and really does use up the summer bounty of tomatos and green beans. Unlike the previous reviewer, I used more bacon than called for, and I used maple bacon which game the dish a subtle maple flavor. Also, I had some extra mushrooms in the frig, so I sauted them in with the onions. I plan to make this dish a summer staple.

I didn't use the bacon as called for in the recipe. I thought it was a great side dish. Very nice flavors. Summery!
