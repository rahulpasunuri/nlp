Followed this exactly. Fantastic!! Served with quinoa and not a bite left. Might double the sauce next time and toss it with the shrimp and quinoa or have on top of greens for a salad of sorts. Great, easy dish

Regularly make this for a week night dinner or summer entertaining. Use frozen mango for ease and add it shortly after the onion but before the spices to help thaw it. Always a hit.

This was great! I followed the recipe as-is, and my whole family loved it. My children are young, but really enjoyed it. I know some people did not like the vinegar reduction, but I'm a fan of vinegar, so I guess that helps.

I was not a fan of the combination of cumin and the vinegar reduction.

Delicious. I used less cider vinegar.

I cut back on the cider vinegar as suggested, added some white wine for liquidity, balsamic for flavor, lemon zest and juice as I had no limes. Served it hot. Cold would be a great contrast to the hot shrimp. Wife & I were pleased. 15 y.o. Daughter said the sauce was too spicy.

Great recipe!!! I slightly modified it. I reduced the vinegar to 1/4 cup and added only a dash of cinnamon and omitted the allspice because I didn't have any and I served it hot. Fantastic!

this is a great tasing dish. I used a bit less vinegar. It is also weight watcher friendly. Only 6 points for a good sized serving.

This dish is amazing! The only thing I don't do is refrigerate the sauce before serving. Excellent and easy recipe!

Nice balance of flavor. I added just a touch more sugar to the sauce to take the edge off, but otherwise very good.

A very disappointing experience. While the promise was there it never delivered. Nothing but a mundane mixture with no mango flavours - subdued by the vinegar reduction.

Had to substitute orange juice for lime so can't comment on exact recipe. I will say, though, that some very picky eaters (most notably, our 13- and 15-year old girls) loved the flavor as did my husband and I. Agree with other reviewer that it's worth experimenting by dialing back (though not necessarily eliminating) the cinnamon.

I loved this dish, and made it two times (once with shrimp and the other with fish). I thought I needed less vinegar and will adjust the recipe next time.

The recipe sounded yummy and smelled pretty good while cooking. I was very surprised, then, that the sauce tasted almost exactly like chunky apple sauce. My wife thought the same. If we try it again, we'll eliminate the cinnamon -- for the small amount used, the flavor was too noticeable. This sauce might be OK with pork or chicken, but was far too much a distraction for the beautiful plump shrimp we used.

I made this sauce as an emergency for mahi mahi when one of the ingredients for a glaze I intended to make was bad. Believe it or not, we had most of the ingredients, most critically the mango, and we're pleased serving the sauce over fish over rice.

This recipe is so good, light and fresh, but meaty and substantial. I followed the sauce to the letter, except for adding a dash of cayenne. I did substitute scallops for shrimp, because they looked better at the fishmonger, and didn't think the dish suffered for it. I made it with saffron rice and the avocado/hearts of palm/red onion salad on this site, with pineapple/mango rum cocktails for a weeknight caribbean getaway!

This was delicious! I think I might have added to much vinegar to the mango sauce, but the dish was still wonderful. My friend and boyfriend loved it and I'm looking forward to making it again.
