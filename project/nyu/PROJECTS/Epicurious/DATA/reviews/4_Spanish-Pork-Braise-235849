I'm so excited ~ it's officially fall and time for slow braised sunday meals. This is definitely a keeper - rustic soul warming meal. Don't skip the garbanzo beans and gremolata - they really take the meal to a 4 fork review! Enjoy!

This was AMAZING. I had home-made ham steak (about 2 inches thick), so I used that along with a ham hock for this recipe. It was incredibly delicious. I lowered the cooking temperature to about 250F and braised for 4 hours, and I skipped the prosciutto on top of the finished dish, but otherwise, the flavours are just incredible. I love the smokey sweet paprika of the pork, and the saffron-garlic of the chickpeas, and I found that the gremolata just perked everything right up. Not a quick dish, but not labour intensive once it's in the oven.

Delicious! I didn't have pork shanks, so I used chunks of pork. I put all the herbs together in a bowl, stirred them up, added the pork, stirred and then lightly fried them. After I poured off the oil, I used a mixture of red and white wine instead of the sherry. Fabulous! Fabulous!

This is a delicious meal. I followed the recipe with two exceptions. I used 4, 2 pound pork shanks instead of the 2 1/2" pieces and after 1 hour I turned the oven temp down to 230 degrees and cooked for 3 more hours. Made the pork a day ahead, put in fridge and removed all solid fat from the top the next day. Served with a loaf of crusty bread to clean the plates and a side dish of spinach, ricotta cheese, garlic and basil blended together. This was one incredible meal and everyone was amazed at the flavorful tender meat and the flavors that permeated the pork and Garbanzo beans. Now I just need an occasion to make this again.

I love osso buco, and my CSA had pork "osso buco" so I decided to buy it, and ultimately, try this recipe. Bottom line: It was very good, Yes, I would do it again but with some reservations. First of all, it is a very heavy dish. All Osso Buco is, but this has the added component of the pork which is by definition fatty. My assessment: 1) Do not fail to make the gremolata as the acidify of the orange and the parsley are essentail for cutting through the heaviness of the dish. 2) I spent some significant time sourcing the smoked ham shank/hock, but I am not sure how much it really contributed to the dish, I think we could have gotten the same depth of flavor from adding some pancetta to the braise. 3) Think about portion size. Unlike veal osso buco, pork shanks are basically the higher end of the pig thigh (with the hock being being the lower portion, and thus less meaty), Definitely plan for at least 2 per person as they are not as meaty as veal. 4) I made the chick peas but a bit differently than the recipe, basically, sauteeing the proscuitto, garlic, and saffron first, then adding the chick peas until they were a bit crispy and toasted, They were stellar. 5) Interestingy we had this dish with some sauvignon blanc which I would not have picked but was actually perfect as it cut through the fattiness much like the gremolata did. 6) as the rest of the reviewers said plan for it taking much longer than 1.5 hours. I cooked it for at least 3.

Very good dish. I made it with pork shanks as indicated in the recipe. It took a good 2 1/2 hours to cook (longer than in the recipe).

I made this as part of a Spanish tapas wine pairing dinner, so substituted short ribs in place of the shanks (too large for what I needed, and hard to find enough of them for the crowd I was having). I did use the pig's foot, though. I have to say that my house smelled wonderful for 3 days! I served the small plates with the saffron garbanzo beans and the dish was the highlight of the evening. Fall-off-the-bone tender and a delicious flavor you can only get with the slow roasting. Will definitely add to my recipe list.

Not a big pork fan, but I'm a fan of this recipe! The kitchen was filled with the "smoked" smell, so I was a little worried, but this dish is flavorful without being heavy. Well worth it! However, I am happy making this without the prosciutto and doubling the gremolata. Went well with something green and slightly acidic like tabbouleh.

Fantastic dish as prepared, and adapts easily to a one-pot meal (skip gremolata and prosciutto garnish and stir beans into pot just before serving. I've also made it with chicken legs and turkey kielbasa instead of pork shanks and ham hocks. I used smoked paprika instead of the chili powder for a more intense smoky peppery flavor.

This recipe while a little time consuming was technically easy and delicious. I substituted pork shanks with center cut chops as shanks were not available.

A really unique recipe. A different and great take on osso bucco. My husband said it was the best dish he had ever eaten (and he has tried most everything.) The ingredients are not that difficult to find. Most supermarkets carry them or a good pork store will. I would suggest making it a day before at least -- that way all the fat will have congealed in the fridge and you can easily scrape it off. Something new and great. WORTH THE EFFORT.
