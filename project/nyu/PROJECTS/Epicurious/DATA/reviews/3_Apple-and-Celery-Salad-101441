Fresh, inventive and easy. And it looks lovely! Pairs well with the curried pork and onion.

Since I had run out of cilantro, I threw in a few handfuls of arugula for some spicy kick. It turned out awesome! The mayo was nice and light, not too mayonnaisey at all. Am making this again tonight!

Very quick and easy and tasty

Unusual and very refreshing. The quantity of lemon juice should be determined by how tart the apples are.

This was a nice salad. My sister-in-law devoured it. I doubled the recipe, which made for a lot of apple chopping, but it turned out very well.

This is a very good recipe. Given the non- elaborate, easy to prepare, nature of this type of salad we found it be very enjoyable. Like the previous writer, we found it to be refreshing as well. As others have mentioned, cilantro is the ingredient which the recipe calls for in the right amount. Though I didn't do this, adding soaked raisons could be a pleasant addition.

This was quick and refreshing. I thought the cilantro really made this dish. I used a nice Fuji apple; maybe the disappointed SF cook used a different apple?

I like this much better when made with celery root instead of the stalks and with Italian parsley instead of the ubiquitous and fashionable cilantro.

Refreshing and delicious!

A good, refreshing, simple salad. Once I decided to make it I realized I didn't have any of the dressing ingredients all of which I usually have on hand. I used salad dressing, dried cilantro, and lime juice. It tasted great.The dressing is just a light coating.

I don't know what I did wrong, but I thought this was AWFUL! I threw it out. I used good quality ingredients, but the flavors just didn't seem to go together, especially the cilantro. And I LOVE cilantro.
