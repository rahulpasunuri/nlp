This tart was good not great. The crust was delicious- I'd defnitely make that again. I didn't like the way the strawberries slid off the firm chocolate ganache when you tried to serve and eat it. I think that next time I'll halve the ganache and do a second mascrapone/cream cheese layer flavored with strawberry and then add the fresh stawberries on top of the cream layer after it's set.

this was good, the chocolate ganache was yummy! I had slight difficulty spreading the jam on a hot crust, maybe next time I will let it cool slightly before spreading the jam. I think a "glaze" over the berries would look nice also.

This is a fabulous dessert. The only problem is that the crust does not roll out, so I would just pat it into place the next time. Used a springform pan and raspberry jam, but otherwise followed the directions. Would definitely make this again.

I made this for a picnic with a group of friends. It was tasty enough, but not amazing. Just seemed too bulky with chocolate--even with my adding in a dash extra whipping cream.

The best tart for your time. Everything works together perfectly - the walnuts, the jam, the chocolate and the berries. One reviewer was disappointed in the separateness of the layers, but not me. Sure they don't mingle on your plate - they do it in your mouth. I much prefer that to having a big jumble of stuff on your fork. And it was beautiful. People who don't like dessert had seconds, and even thirds. I would skip the whipped cream, though. Seems like overkill.

I've already made this tart twice. It's quite easy and very popular. The ganache makes a great filling. I would recommend using a higher quality chocolate, since that is most of your flavor. I also used more jam than recommended. It looks pretty too!

This tart was easy to make and presented well. However, the taste was mediocre. The berries just sit on top of the chocolate and aren't integrated in the filling. I can't understand the fuss. I would definitely not waste my time on this one again.

This is the first tart I have ever made.....very easy and elegant. Everyone loved it....My daughter thought it was the best dessert I have ever made!! I put the strawberries on the tart just before serving although I think it would have been fine hours before..I topped each slice with a little whipped cream and chocolate shavings.

Mmmmm! This was the first tart I've ever made. It was easy and turned out GREAT! I have since made it twice ... always to rave reviews! Once I was stuck with not so ripe berries (courtesy of the grocery store) but I tossed them in a little powdered sugar and grand marnier and then put them on, it was terrific! Enjoy!

Everyone loved this recipe. Easy and delicious. Could use a regular pie shell and it would be even easier and quicker, but not as elegant.

Very delicious and simple to make. I made it with fresh raspberries and raspberry preserves instead of the strawberries and preserves, and I think it turned out even better. With strawberries, you must serve the dish very shortly after putting the cut strawberries on the filling. But with whole fresh raspberries, you can store it longer before serving (as long as the raspberries are fairly dry). It looks very nice with a dusting of powdered sugar. My guests were very impressed, but it was not at all difficult.

I have made this recipe many times and everyone always raves about it. Plus, anyone can make this tart it is that easy.

I've made this several times now and it's always a hit. Pretty easy to do and it tastes as good as it looks. You can make it ahead, just don't put the strawberries on until just before serving.
