I made this with a lamb roast instead of a rack, and it came out great. It was gone in about ten minutes.

Delicious dish. We reduced OJ from a carton rather than using FCOJ, and it worked just fine. Also served this dish with orange wedges as a garnish for extra juice. The red onion didn't add much. Could take it or leave it.
