This was a very quick meal, and it reheats very well. I didn't have chicken broth, so used water (though broth would have been better, I know), and nixed the raisins. It was especially good when mixed with garlic yogurt dip. My only complaint is that the chickpeas were dry and had a weird texture. I think they maybe should have been cooked in liquid first to soften them up?

Perfect way to enjoy couscous and chickpeas. Very easy to make. I skipped the chicken broth, and next time might try skipping the butter to make it vegan. I used whole wheat couscous, cooked the beans instead of using canned, and used golden raisins (sultanas). Surprising how good this is for such a simple dish.

I used knorr chicken cubes, omitted the tomatoes and put all ingredients in boiling water. Turned off the heat and let it sit. I did not put it in the oven and it was amazing. Added some pine nuts after the liquid was absorbed. I prepare this at least twice a month and make enough for leftovers. Goes well with spicy pork chops or chicken.

I love this recipe. It's a great, quick weekday dish. To keep things simple I always use canned diced tomatoes. I also am pretty liberal with the spices, adding extra of everything plus cayenne. I always omit the butter and have made it with and without fresh lemon juice. I like it either way.

I can't believe how good this recipe is given the simple ingredients. It sounds kinda boring but the subtle flavors are really a treat. Worked wonderfully as a meatless main course, but will have again as a picnic salad. I did omit the cinnamon - I find it can often be overpowering in these types of dishes

Very good with minor changes. Used a whole can of chicken broth, with just enough water to make the 16 oz. total. Then added 1/4 tsp. of salt before the couscous, and some lemon zest with the herbs.

This dish was GREAT. I served it as a side with Moroccan chicken (which is equally yummy). Quick, easy and loved by everyone I served it too. Tastes even better the next day!

I used the juice of one lemon, and took the suggestion of doubling all the spices but the cinnamon and it came out as nothing special. I might have done something wrong, but it was not great.

This is an excellent couscous recipe! It's in my book as my new favourite comfort food that is both yummy AND healthy!! I doubled the chickpeas, and added a handful of toasted pine nuts for extra texture.

I doubled all the spices but the cinnamon and added 1/2 tsp each of cumin and red pepper flakes as many reviewers suggested and the spice seemed just about right. Also followed the advice of a handful of people and added 6 shrimp chopped, 1 green onion and the juice of one lemon. Stuffed the mixture into hollowed out tomatoes, baked at 350 for 1/2 hour and it was beautiful and tasty. Thanks everyone for the suggestions!

Very tasty. I also added some cumin and chilli (flakes). Served it with feta cheese on top.

Even good before I went in the oven. A great, quick and tasty dish on its own or as a side to fish or poultry. A little lemon juice gives it a punch but the recipe great as is. Next time I'll add shrimp.

I can't believe that anything this delicious can be this easy. I just love this stuff. For those in my gang who are vegetarians, I just used a good canned veggie broth, and it was just as good. But I'm always fussy with ingredients and use the best tomatoes, if possible from my garden, and sometimes I soak the chick peas from the dried ones, which gives a much better texture and flavor. And a few times I ran outside and broke off a few stems of fresh spearmint and chopped the leaves in too.

A great way to use up leftover chick peas. A nice side dish, but not exciting enough on it's own. I think some lemon would be nice for next time.

I made it according to the recipe and thought it was okay but not very exciting. Perhaps it needs more seasoning as others have suggested.

Easy to make and delicious. Even my husband and son gave it high marks and they don't usually like anything vegetarian. Like another reviewer, I increased the spices and bit and added cumin and chili powder. Also added some chopped green onions. I also added a bit of tomato juice before baking to moisten it as it looked a bit dry. Served it with some sliced canteloupe on the side and some cucumber. Definitely worth repeating.

very easy and tasty. I would use golden raisin instead of regular, and maybe a little less broth (I like my couscous a little dry). Also, some cumin and chili powder can add a little kick.

I have made this several times as a main dish and as a side dish-the spices really dress up couscous. I don't like raisins, but they taste great in this recipe.
