outstanding. we always used a different recipe for sweet potato latkes but this time tried something new. no complaints at all. these came out perfect. we serve with a chili-lime sour cream (sour cream, fresh lime juice, and a lil bit of jalapeno...exquisite!

Followed the recommendations for adding some spices - cumin, ginger powder - and doing a combo bake/fry method. Cut down on the amount of oil needed and time in the oil so it was a bit less greasy while still having that nice authentic pan-seared taste.

Loved them! I followed the recipe except I doubled it cuz I love sweet potatoes! If they are fried as fast as the recipe states , they were hardly any more greasy than baking and still had a great crisp texture. I think if i changed anything, it would to be add some spices to complement the potatoes. Just needed a bit more kick but a condiment would do the same.

These were a little better than ok. They had the sweet potato flavor that I love, but the great thing about sweet potatoes is that they are so good even if they aren't prepared with a bunch of extra stuff (including calories from frying!). They looked pretty fried, and I used peanut oil which was good, but they are definitely something to make simply to 'do something different'. I added some brown sugar, cumin and ginger powder and will probably try baking them next time only to cut back some calories.

I was dubious but gave the baking method a shot, and although they were still quite soft and limp when I went to turn them over after 15 mins, they came out with a nice texture in the end, and they were delicious!

Tasty, but very greasy. I will try baking them next time just as another reviewer said.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I halved it (one big-ish sweet potato, one egg) but I used the same amount of pepper and the two scallions. Like other reviewers, I will add more scallions next time. I also added a touch of cumin, per other reviewer's recommendations. I found that I needed moderate-high heat to get good color on the latkes.

Make these with Hawaiian purple sweet potatoes. They look awesome!

Excellent dish. I used a gluten-free flour mix and it worked fine. Also I baked it as I had 11 people to feed and wanted them all done at the same time plus it's healthier than frying. Everything turned out wonderful.

Wonderful recipe. I changed it a bit as I don't fry anything. I used 1 egg + 1 egg white, added two TBS of canola oil, and in addition, an entire bunch of minced scallions. I baked on a cookie sheet sprayed with canola oil at 425 degrees for 15 minutes on side 1 and 10 minutes on side 2. These came out just right. A perfect blend of sweet, savory and crispy. This is my new favorite side dish for year round use. Lots tastier than regular potatoes or even Yukon golds

Flour? Yuck. 1/3 c. of matzah meal does the trick. Matzah meal gives this and all latke recipes a more "authentic" (to Ashkenazi Jews, anyway) taste.The addition of scallions is gimmicky. Regular old onions work just as well with sweet potato latkes, and if that is too sharp a taste for you, use a Vidalia. I guess I'm just a potato latke purist but...I do like the baking instead of frying idea. I'll try that for sure. Oh, one more thing: draining latkes on a paper towel allows them to become greasy. Try this: Put paper towels under a cooling rack and place the latkes directly on the rack. The oil drips down onto the paper towels and off of the latkes. Mmmmmmm good.

This recipe is easy to change to your own taste. I often use a mixture of carrots and zucchini. I spray the pan with cooking spray. The texture isn't as good with the spray, kind of limp, but I feel better about giving that version to my 3yr. old. He loves them!

These were really good, and held together well when cooked. I made them in a cast iron skillet, which I think is ideal--they don't stick at all and brown very nicely. I followed the recipe as written, but added a few additional flavors: cumin, nutmeg, ginger, and brown sugar--just a touch of each, to bring out the sweet potato flavor. I served them with applesauce, which was perfect. A nice variation on the standard potato latke.

Great recipe! Not as sweet as I thought they might be! I added 2 pinches of cumin which added "just a little something extra" and really gave it a greater depth of flavor. Definitely a keeper.

Easy and fast to prepare. Cooking time took longer than anticipated. I probably need to raise the heat under the pan. All my guests loved them and I will use this recipe again and share it as well.

These were a hit! A healthier take on the Chanukah classic :-)

Delicious! A great change from traditional latkes. Even my kids, who won't ever touch sweet potatoes in anything else, loved them, and would love for me to make them again. You can be sure I will.

good dish - a change rom regular latkes. Next time I would cut down on the pepper. Sweet potatoes have their own flavor... Also, 1-1/2 min on each side?? It took me much longer!

Used Cornstarch instead of flour to help hold it together (must eat gluten free). Also, try adding your favorite chopped nuts and some dried fruit, such as raisins or cranberries!

I made a double batch ahead of time. They were they quick, easy, and delicious. They froze and reheated well, and then the leftovers reheated well again! How bout them latkes!

Easy and delicious! Definitely a keeper to be made again for the end of Hanukkah (I tried them for the first time to start our celebration this year) and many years to come. I added a little fresh grated nutmeg to taste, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly, other than tripling the recipe for 5 adults and 5 LITTLE kids (ages 16 months to 9 years). Much to our surprise, we ate ALL of them. And because they were made with sweet potatoes (more nutrients than regular potatoes), we felt like we weren't totally wasting calories!

not the same as yukon golds or russets. if you are going to use sweet potatoes, you need to make these more savory: cumin, cinnamon, cayenne would all make this a more successful recipe.

I have been making these every year since it was first published -- due to popular demand. My family insists. I usually quadruple the recipe and still every one is gone. This is a real winner

I quadrupled the recipe, used 10 scallions, fried them in canola oil. Topped them with a dollop of sour cream and a healthy dash of caviar. Upon tasting, everyone in the room was instantly verklemt. I mean, people went back - not just for seconds - for THIRDS. This is the recipe to use when you simply must hit a home run. If there was an option for five forks, I would give it five.

This is my second Hanukkah making these latkes (along with the traditional potato) and man are these good! I use a whole bunch of scallions instead of just two and it's perfect.

Latkes served under a pork chop? Oy...

Really yummy even my kids ages 2, 5 and 7 LOVED them!!! Perfect combination. I used 3 different types of sweet potatoes for varied color and taste. Garnet ,Yams and White Yams but any 3 types or even 2 types would be great! Cannot disappoint with this one!

Rating: 4
Excellent! I used Jewel yams and olive oil to make this recipe. With the first batch, I cut down the amount of oil, using about 2 tbls. The following batches, I didn't use any oil at all and they still came out great! I loved the sweet taste of the sweet potato combined with the spicy flavor of the black pepper and onion. YUM! Leave out the scallions and black pepper to make for breakfast. I served this with broccoli rabe and chicken. Would be great with black bean soup!

i'm sort of a sucker for sweet potatoes. but i think if i were to make this again, i'd do less egg, less pepper, a little less salt. i wanna taste the potato! i cooked this in big pan sized pancakes and topped w/ sour cream or pure maple syrup.

Fantastic! I loved these! I ate the first batch at the stove while making the 2nd batch. I didn't use any flour but noticed the latkes broke apart when frying so next time I will use the flour.

This is my new favorite breakfast! I used regular onion instead of scallion and that was just fine. It's really good with epicurious's recipe for savory applesauce. YUM!

These were really good. I did exactly as the recipe said and they were different. I'd definitely make again along with regular latkes.

Easy to prepare and delicious. I made these as well as potato latkes for a family party, and they were a big hit. I did not add scallions to this recipe.
