One of my husband's favorites! We had this for breakfast on Christmas Morning. A note for those planning to prepare this ahead of time: Mix up the custard and bread and apples but try to avoid putting it all in the buttered loaf pans until just before you bake it! I prepared the pans and poured the mixture in and then refrigerated it overnight. When it came out of the oven the next day, a large amount of the butter had been absorbed and the result was a bread pudding with very crispy edges!

excellent. Can be made ahead. may be a tad short on the liquid so we added a little extra. Served it with vanilla ice bream and a little butterscotch and caramel sauce.

What a delicious dessert and so beautiful served at the table - it was about 8 inches tall - I served with vanilla ice cream. I usually like make- ahead desserts but this was fantastic. Yum-yum - so good

I used a rather old loaf of bread and the recipe worked out great. It's a "keeper."

I'm not a big bread pudding gal, but we made this for a party and it got rave reviews from many guests, even in contest with an amazing tiramisu. I agree that the maple flavor was minimal, especially disappointing considering the price of maple syrup. Our finished product would have benefited from some cream on top, too. Three forks because it was a party hit.

I used apricot brandy instead of the Calvados and it came out great. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly an it was written. This recipe would be easy to substitute ingredients without much risk. Making it ahead is a big plus. Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/notes/Apple-and-Maple-Bread-Pudding-356873#ixzz0fdBCteLg

I don't know how anyone could call this bland! It was exceptionally rich. A wonderful dessert! I used rum instead of brandy as suggested by another reviewer. I did have very tart apples and a good quality maple syrup. Did not use a loaf pan but a small casserole dish instead. GREAT!

My brother-in-law made this for a holiday party and my wife & I agree that it is the best bread pudding we've ever had (and we love bread pudding)! A key change he made to the recipe was to bake it in a lasagna pan rather than a loaf pan. This change gave a very nice crunchy crust to soft insides ratio. He also substituted dark rum for the calvados and served it with vanilla ice cream. This recipe will definitely be something I will be making in the near future.

It's a good bread pudding -- my family loved it -- but if I made it again, I would either bake some chocolate shards into it or drizzle a caramel sauce over it once done. It needed something that I think the maple syrup was supposed to provide, but I really didn't get much maple flavor.

This recipe was nothing special and it wasn't quick considering the apples needed to be cooked. Neither the cinnamon or maple flavor stood out. The texture of the bread and apples is very important too.
