This got rave reviews around the table and is a great go-to recipe. I made it for Thanksgiving, and it was a great make-ahead dish. We made the dressing, tried it, but left it off. The flavors of the veggies with the herbs was perfect. I added a head of garlic (during roasting, then peeled it), added celery root, and used pearl onions instead of a red one. The recipe is very flexible and should go nicely with whatever veggies you like.

This is a great recipe. Did a mix of yams, carrots, parsnips, golden beets, butternut squash, leeks and red onion. Was delicius! It is a little bit of a challenge to have all veggies the same doneness at the same time -- we had to pull most of them out and leave the carrots a little longer. Also, added a few whole cloves of garlic during the cooking (pulled out before serving) and a tiny bit of dijon to the vinaigrette to help it emilsigy. Great recipe -- will definitely make again.

This beautiful orange, red/purple and yellow vegetable dish, livened with balsamic, lemon and parsley presents itself very well. It is always popular with our guests and is so easy to do early in the day before the oven is doing double time. An excellent choice for the holiday menu.

Superb vegetable dish. Great for winter meals. Serve with rib roast or along side of or stirred into beef stew. Some vegetables can be substituted as long as you have enough in the pan!

This has become a must-have for Thanksgiving. We love all the unusual veggies and like the balsamic sauce, too. Tried some beets with it; taste was fine but things turned red. You can halve the recipe.

Such a wonderful recipe .. festive, different, delicious, and healthy! People love it .. I've been asked for the recipe a dozen times. It's a staple in demand at holiday feasts.

Made the veggies sans vinegarette. The marjoram and thyme was delicious and the vegetables came out perfectly cooked. My only recommendation is to skip the nonstick spray and use aluminum foil instead as the vegetables turned black where they touched the oil spray!

So flavorful! I love the aroma that fills the house after being in the oven for only a few minutes. Great leftover too.

Excellent recipe.I have made it many times and always a hit in small diners and big buffet parties.But I disagree that it doesn't look good on a buffet,it does and also tastes great.But it needs less cooking time 40 minutes to be exact, otherwise the vegetables will be mushy.

It's reasonably tasty. But, certainly not suitable for entertaining. At least, not on a buffet. It isn't very attractive and there is just no way to dress it up enough to make it visually appealing. I put it on the table for a buffet and only two guests even sampled it. My dogs sure enjoyed it though.

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner. Yummy! I roasted it ahead of time and warmed up prior to serving. The only changes I made were using turnips instead of rutabagas and I added an acorn squash. Even my guests who don't like root veggies gobbled this up. A great fall side dish!

just took this to a thanksgiving dinner. Everyone loved it. Its easy to make early in the day and just warm up. We added some baby beets and celery root.

Very, very good. Served this dish warm for 10 person dinner party with pork tenderloin with cranberry/port wine sauce. Delicious. Started with butternut squash soup with a roasted red pepper puree. The meal was really great, got raves from all, and everything was made ahead exept for the actual roasting of the meat. Since these veggies did not have to be piping hot, timing was not an issue and I was able to relax.

I've made this but don't like turnips or parsnips, so have substituted beets and potatoes, and have this hot or cold, year around and LOVE it. This was a great hit at Thanksgiving!

Like it, don't love it. Ordinarily I'm a huge yam lover, but was surprised to find that I didn't care for the sweet, mushy-soft texture of roasted yams in this dish. I'll substitute white potatoes next time. Will also skip adding balsamic vinegar, as I didn't care for the sweet-sour note. With those comments out of the way, the addition of fresh thyme, marjoram and lemon peel is genius! The herbs blend well with the roasted sweetness of the carrots, parsnips & ruabagas. I'll also add a little minced garlic to the olive oil next time.

Perfect dish for a pot luck since it can be served at room temp. Just bring the lemon and parsley, as well as the vinaigrette, in a separate container and garnish on the buffet when you arrived. People were actually seeking me out at a party for the recipe! I couldn't find parsnips and rutabaga, so I substituted butternut squash and celery root - fantastic!

This is my family's favorite and gets raves from guests year after year. We serve it at every holiday meal. Fresh herbs are a must. I freeze marjoram from my garden to add to this recipe during the holidays. Have tried it with dried herbs - just isn't the same. Excellent prepared exactly as described.

Rating: 4
The best way to prepare this dish is on the grill in a ALL-Clad type saute pan. The combination of the direct heat from below and the hot air surrounding the food result in deliciously carmamelized, tender vegetables. Don't skip the vinaigrette or the lemon. Well worth it!!

I have made this dish 3 times now, as an accompaniement to a fall meat dish. Twice with beef, and once with venisson. Each time it's just lovely. It is a bit time consuming, especially the turning part, but it's definitely worth it. Who knew root vegetables could taste this good!!

We have made this for several large dinner parties and everyone loves it - like most veggie dishes can be adjusted with what veggies you have on hand but the lemon and balsamic vinegar are a must! Already on the menu for this Thanksgiving feast.

Loved it! I didn't make the vinaigrette based on previous reviews. I added thyme (fresh), and marjoram (dried), salt and pepper to the oil that I tossed the veggies in before roasting and that gave them more than enough flavor.

This was delicious. I added red peppers and asparagus for the last 25 min to brighten it up.

Loved the vegetables, but didn't care for the balamic vinaigrette so much. They were better with just some sea salt and pepper sprinkled on top. I probably won't make this again since they were good, but not spectacular.

This recipe was a really great twist to the usual roasted vegetables I serve at Thanksgiving. Everyone absolutely loved it.

This is a keeper! What great flavor. I made if for a family dinner and everyone wanted the recipe. I adjusted the recipe slightly and left out the carrots and used regular potatoes instead of rutabega. Absolutely superb!

GREAT!! My kids requested these for Thanksgiving for next year, too. So much better than the old marshmallow-brown sugar sweet potatoes (Yuk)

One of my all-time favorite oven roasted veggie recipes. I like the marjoram in it and the balsamic really brightens the flavors.

I couldn't find rutabega, so I ended up with more sweet potato - certainly agree that a baking pan would not have sufficed. The lemon zest was key to making this a special dish.

This was definitely a keeper. I couldn't believe how good it was.

Rating: 3
The recipe was poorly written. The rutabegas should be added first and the yams should be added later to avoid getting mushy. You should also use a rimmed pan, not a baking sheet, because it drips. It tasted good, but it was not worth the enormous effort of peeling and chopping all those veggies.

Rating: 4
I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was heavenly! I left out the sweet potatoes (there were already 2 other sweet potato dishes), and I don't think that the recipe suffered at all without them. The lemon zest was a perfect compliment to the root vegetables! I will be making this very often this winter!

Rating: 4
Great dish but next time I will add the yams 10-15 after the rest of the vegetables. They cook too fats for the rest of the vegetables and can get mushy.

Rating: 4
This has become our new favourite. I can't wait for an excuse to make it again. The balsamic adds such a wonderful taste to the veggies. I made it for a large Christmas gathering and it got rave reviews. Sweet potatoes are not that popular in Canada, but they were that night!!

I have never had parsnips, sweet potatoes or rutabaggas and neither had my husband. We made this with a standing rib roast for Easter dinner, and it was a huge hit! We absolutely fell in love with it and can't wait to make it again!

I made this last night for a dinner party. I paired it with a pork loin I roasted on the grill. This was the easiest dinner party I ever hosted because I cooked the veggies in the afternoon and simply reheated them when the roast was about done. You could easily add/change any veggies you want. What was great was everyone could nudge aside any veggie they didn't like, but my guests liked them all. You would not believe how many people have never had parsnips before. But everyone loved them! I didn't use rutabagas - added eggplant instead. This was a huge hit and I will definitely make this again and again.

My guests and I loved this! Followed the recipe exactly. Boy did it make a LOT of servings! I'm making it again tonight with roasted fresh kielbasi (less the carrots and parsnips) for my daughters return home from college. I predict a suceess!

I really liked the flavor of this dish. It was my first adventure in parsnips, and they were great. I used parsnips, yams, carrots, added a peeled head of garlic and a white onion in large chunks, because that's what I had around-and if I'm roasting veggies, by God I insist on getting some roasted garlic at the end of it. Anyway, ate it with good bread and butter, and liked it a lot. The only drawback was the texture-I cooked it for less time than the recipe recommended and the yams were just mushy.

Fantastic! Added asparagus spears after the first 20 minutes. Served with baked salmon fillet and garlic bread. Beautiful color and presentation. Fast, easy weekday dinner.

This is excellent. It's a nice way to feature winter root vegetables. They get such a nice caramelized crust to them. The herb mixture is delicious. I would not leave out the rutabaga, as I personally enjoy it. I did substitute large shallots for the red onion as someone else suggested.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was an unusual--and delicious--addition to the meal. Cooked it before the turkey went in, and everyone picked at it as the turkey cooked throughout the day. It was practically the only dish my sister-in-law ate (she had it in lieu of turkey!). My mother-in-law said she preferred the way the vegetables tasted before I put the dressing on, although my sister-in-law disagreed. I had to use all dried herbs, as I didn't have any fresh available, so that may have impacted the flavor. Regardless, this ones a definite keeper.

This was a great addition to Thanksgiving dinner! I made it before I put in the turkey and saved oven space....with delicious results. A few suggestions: it makes a LOT - I would omit the rutabagas next time. Also, would substitute shallots for the red onions as they carmelize nicely. Also nice to have an 'adult' vegetable dish that kids will eat (even if they just pick out the carrots!)

Excellent. We added beets (which we roasted separately). Definitely would serve again.

I made this dish for company and everyone loved it. No leftovers! I eliminated the carrots (due to Sugarbusters diet) and substituted eggplant for the rutabaga and it was a delicious, colorful fall vegetable dish. I would make it again in a heartbeat.
