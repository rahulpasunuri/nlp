Great! I've never been huge on greens, but as a vegetarian I'm always trying to incorporate as much variety as possible. I followed advice of previous posters and subbed fresh, baby heirloom tomatoes for the canned tomatoes and squeezed half a lemon over the finished product. I served mine over a bed of white bean + orzo pilaf with sauteed shallots and red bell pepper with a little garlic and oregano for flavor. I was also inspired to pair it all with some warm naan with just a touch of Boursin. I will definitely be making this meal again!

This is a great way to serve greens, if you like cumin. I used kale, fresh grape tomatoes (halved), doubled the garlic and used garlic salt & fresh ground pepper to season. Served with tamarind garlic chicken.

Used rapini and found that the flavours didn't work too well with the bitterness of the green I chose.

I paired this recipe with Curry Sliders and although it went really well, I could definitely taste the canned tomatoes. Next time I make this recipe I will most certainly be making it with fresh tomatoes. Good side dish for Indian recipes.

Wonderful dish! Served with curry chicken and brown basmati rice. We wished we had some naan to go with it...next time!

This was very good. I didn't measure the greens (Just wanted to use up what came in my CSA share). Very easy.

Considering that these are leafy greens, and leafy greens are really good for you, this is a quick and easy way to get all those nutrients. Versatile recipe, I used garlic salt (fresh out of garlic), ground cumin, and sun-dried tomatoes in oil, splash of lemon juice at the end. Very pretty dish, very tasty, felt very noble eating it.

These greens are great! I used turnip greens and a fresh tomato. For the cumin, I used half ground and half whole cumin seeds, which added a nuttier texture. I highly recommend adding fresh squeezed lemon juice just before serving, which really made the flavors pop. Easy, healthy, delicious!

This was a delicious recipe. I used rapini as the green and oven roasted plum tomatoes. The tomatoes were not as flavourful as I had hoped. Next time, I might tried sun dried but overall, this was wonderful and my guests were asking for seconds. Good for you too!

I really liked the cumin sauteed with the spinach and garlic. It was a nice change from the way I usually prepare greens. I didn't have tomatoes though, but it made a tasty side dish without them.

I made this with toasted cumin seeds and took others' advice and roasted a few roma tomatoes, instead of canned. Would be good with a squeeze of lemon.

This is a great dish! Took the suggestion of "cook from SF" and used fire roasted tomatoes, along with mustard greens and broccoli rabe. Combined it with a Cajun Prawn recipe that we have and served it over pasta. This will become a regular.

This was a great change of pace with greens. I wouldn't use this with tender greens, but it was super with collards and kale. I used "fire- roasted" canned tomatoes. Added a nice extra flavor. As a leftover, nuke this with some crumbled feta.

What a surprisingly exceptional dish! I used fresh beet greens (which if you have never tried, you don't know what you are missing!) and very small cherry tomatoes. Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of using 1/3 of the oil called for.

Very,very good! The only diced canned tomatoes I had on hand also had jalepenos in them, so instead I used sun-dried tomatoes (NOT in oil) that I reconstituted in warm water. Used beet greens and swiss chard, and a tiny bit of baby spinach. Really guite good!

Wow, we're so lucky to have morluv on here to teach us how to cook! I loved these greens; I followed the recipe (the one from Epicurious, not morluv's) and they turned out great. I'll try the pinenuts next time; great idea.

So, maybe make it, then review it?? Easy and delicious. Salt was added at table.

Add a can of rinsed and drained cannellini beans for an added twist!

I would NOT use kale or mustard greens as they are too strong for this treatment, in my opinion. Then I would saute an onion in the oil, add the garlic and cumin for 1 minute and then add the tomatoes to simmer for 3 minutes so they would gain complexity and flavor. Then I would remove most of the tomatoes until the end and saute the greens in a bit more oil for just a few minutes, adding 3 Tlbs. of chicken broth (or better - 1 t. of that great product that comes in the glass jar - Better Than Bouillion - chicken flavor) mixed with a couple T of water (replaces the salt and adds a LOT of flavor) to steam them a bit before adding back the tomatoes. I loved the reviewers addition of pine nuts, which I would lightly toast in the toaster oven or saute lightly in butter before adding to the top of the dish. Add sea salt (if you don't use Better Than Bouillion)and fresh ground pepper to the greens.Plate by layering greens, tomatoes and pine nuts. Maybe some fresh ground parmesean woud be good here as well? YUM!

I haven't made this yet but I imagine it needs salt for better flavour.

Loved It! Made it with swiss chard and tossed in a handful of toasted pine nuts -- delicious. Even my child thought it was great.

I got some greens in this week's veggie box and am always looking for quick and easy recipes so I can use them before they wilt. This one filled the bill. All the ingredients were on hand. The cumin gives the greens a nice additional kick. A nice change of pace.
