It being winter here, we broiled the steak. No capers, so we subbed in minced green olives...and of course made a double batch of sauce, going a little light on the olive oil. The resident vegetarian had the sauce over roasted potatoes and mushrooms. Easy and tasty! We all cleaned our plates.

I've made this three times: over seared pork chops, roasted pork loin, and grilled rib-eye. All were fantastic and received rave reviews from our guests. This is a new favorite.

The vinaigrette was amazing and the steak was flavorful. We paired the steak with garlic/rosemary potatoes and spinach. Loved the vinaigrette on the potatoes as well!

This was wonderful! The sauce is particularly delicious. Guests were eating it with a spoon! One note is that grassfed beef definitely cooks quicker than non-grassfed. Delicious!

The vinagrette was a fresh take on what to do with a steack, very delicous.

I made this last night and received rave reviews. Surprisingly, the sauce seemed liked an afterthought to the delicious steaks that stood amazingly well on their own. Will make these again minus the caper sauce and serve with a horseradish cream instead.

One of the best steaks I have ever had! The sauce is to die for.

Simply fantastic flavor--from someone who normally dislikes beef steak. My husband, who over-indulges in food only during holidays, ate two servings.

This was just a flat out amazing recipe. I used regular rib-eyes, and they came out just great. My guests gobbled their steaks down! I will be doing this again on the grill throughout the summer!

Not sure what i missed but we definitely did not like this dish. The vinaigrette was one dimensional with the sweetness of the balsamic taking center stage. For us, it ruined good rib eye steaks. I will admit that I did not use smoked paprika (used sweet instead) so maybe that made the difference? Wont be trying this again.

This recipe is so amazingly good! I've made 4 or 5 times now for company and people just flip for the flavor. This is such an easy recipe for entertaining. I think the smoked paprika makes it special. Even my meat purist freinds rave.

We are purists, thinking that good beef doesn't need accompaniment. But this is the very best I have ever had in a steak with significant sauce. To improve the vinaigrette, reduce the amount in the recipe to half or even a third, then add more balsamic and reduce it again before going back to the recipe's instructions. That way, the vinaigrette still has the vinegar flavor but less pungent and a bit more sweet, which is good against the smokey paprika. I've served this for very high-end dinner parties using a cut called a Petite Tender, a shoulder cut that performs almost like filet mignon but at a lower cost. Raves from the most intense foodies. Whole Foods sells it bacon-wrapped by us, but I do it without the bacon. Bon Appetit!

At first bite, I thought the spice rub on the steak gave a delicious flavor, but with subsequent bites I found it to be a little overpowering. Although the vinaigrette was tasty, I thought it also overpowered the flavor of the meat. What I am really searching for is a subtle spicing tha brings out the flavor of a really good steak without covering up its essential nature. Any suggestions from others???

Absolutely fantastic! I didn't have smoked paprika so that may have added another dimension but it was delicious with plain paprika. I'd give the vinaigrette 5 forks if I could.

YES! YES! YES!! The combination of the rub and vinaigrette make for a scrumptious steak. At last I've found an alternative recipe to our favourite "Grilled, Korean Steaks with spicy cilantro sauce" Thank you Epicurious!

This steak recipe is AMAZING! This ranks right up there with steaks we've had at some of the country's best restaurants.

YUM, YUM--this is a keeper! We used tenderloin because I prefer that cut of beef and it was fantastic. Not terribly complicated either. I put the meat over sauteed spinach, toped with vinaigrette, and served polenta on the side--DDDEEEEE-lish! We will definitely make this for guests.

This is a fantastic recipe. The vinaigrette was really easy to make. I didn't have the time or the ingredients so skipped the fresh parsley and thyme and it was still delicious. I used the extra to dress some roasted asparagus. The paprika rub was also fantastic, and if you don't have time for the whole vinaigrette, your steak will be delicious if you simply do this part of the recipe. I didn't grill, instead I pan fried a sirloin then finished it in the oven. My boyfriend and I agreed that we hadn't had steak this good in a restaurant for as long as we can remember! We'll definitely be coming back to this recipe again and again.

We made this using New York strip steaks and it was exceptional. I made the vinaigrette ahead of time. We had it with braised fingerling potatoe coins and brocolli. The smoked paprika gives it a fantastic 'punch'
