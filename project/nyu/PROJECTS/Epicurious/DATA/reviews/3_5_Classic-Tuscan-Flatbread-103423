Hmmm...So easy a child could make it, good texture, nice presentation but rather bland. I even added a bit of salt to the flour/yeast mix. Needs some tweaking or a healthy dip in oil and balsamic.

I've been making this for years--I do the first part in my bread machine and go from there. Very easy, and the results are consistently good (but not always perfect). Every once in a while, the bread comes out rather dry--can't put my finger on why. Will consider other reviewers' suggestions.

The recipe as-is is excellent. Very easy to follow and easy to make. The only trick is to make sure you knead the dough well enough. Variations I've used when making my own version of this is to replace the kosher salt with table salt like another person suggested. Works just as well. This bread goes great with apperitiv.

Has become a staple recipe - I love it! I only have fresh yeast and it needs MUCH less time if you use fresh. For the first rise, just let it double (for me, 25 min) and for the second let it double again just 10 minutes. I put salt and rosemary directly in the dough.

Not very good when made exactly as directed. Definitely needs salt (and maybe sugar) in dough.

I have made this x6 now, & have several tweaks: 1. add 1 tsp garlic salt to the flour 2. Add 1 T olive oil to flour when mixing in the yeast solution. 3. Add 1 T dried oregano & 1 T chopped fresh rosemary to the flour. 4. While the dough is proofing on the pan (final proof) press into the surface thinly sliced red onion pieces and fresh rosemary sprigs- the dough will rise around it & they'll stick once the bread is baked. 5. Sprinkle romano or parma cheese on the top before baking, as well as a few pinches of kosher salt. 6. As soon as you pull the finished bread, brush more olive oil onto the top-it soaks in and makes it a little less dry. 7. Try replacing 1 cup of all purpose flour w/1 cup whole wheat flour.

I am typically unsuccessful with breads. This, however, was easy and delicious. I made it just as the recipe suggested although I did add a bit more salt.

Very good and easy to make. It came out beautifully golden brown and the texture was excellent. I added 1 1/2 tsp salt to the dough which worked well. However, I thought the 2 tablespoons coarse sea salt sprinkled on top was way too much. I ended up brushing almost all of it off. I guess it depends how salty you like your bread but my boyfriend and I both thought it was almost uneatable with all that salt.

This bread is really excellent, and also incredibly easy. We went through a phase where we ate it every week, and today a *super-foodie* friend of mine asked me to bring it to the dinner-party she's cooking for her boyfriend's birthday. You can also adapt it by putting rosemary or thyme or whatever on top. It is a big winner.

Easy to make and great served with Tuscan beans. I also turn this into a pizza dough -- just slather on some sauce, anchovies, mushrooms -- whatever you have -- and it comes out with a crispy crust.

many people say this is bland. add 2 t. salt to the flour; end of problem.

All I get is rave reviews for this simple bread. Add a pinch of salt to the flour (I also added fresh sage leaves) Never knead out of the bowl because I get the bread to a slightly sticky consistancy and then knead it in the bowl using olive oil instead of flour. The oil gives the bread a crunchy outside and a soft and spongy inside. Drizzle with more oil and salt before putting in the oven and you can't go wrong.

The texture and crust were great. It did lack flavor. Very bland for my taste. I would add herbs and salt next time. Even the olive oil did not help much. I have to agree exactly with the other reviewer on the flavor. It needs something to give it a kick!!!!!!!

easy and fast. I always use 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1.5 cups white. I generally top with salt and fresh-cracked pepper. This is a fast and easy bread. My husband and I usually eat the whole loaf in one night, but leftovers store well. Regarding the olive oil comment: this is how my grandmother taught me to make bread. just drizzle a little in the bottom of the bowl and roll the dough in it. when you knead it out, the dough won't stick to the counter (so no need for flour) but your hands will smell wonderfully of olive oil.

I followed the green olive tip and I think that is the only thing that really saved it. It turned great texture wise, but it was bland. I would make again, but in the future I would add some herbs.

Doubled the recipe and would certainly make again. Easy, fast and VERY tasty!

I actually live in Pisa, Italy and they use this bread for everyday life. One way the Italians use this bread is with ham and cheese. The bread has such a good flavor that you don't need anything else on it. My family loves this bread. It's one of the easiest recipes to make. I would recommend this to everyone.

I make this 3-4 times a week. A nice touch is silced green olives pushed into the dough.

I thought this flat bread was okay -- certainly easy to make. But putting 1 tablespoon of oil in the bowl where the bread was rising? It sat in a pool on the bottom and made it kind of an oily mess when I took it out to knead. This was good with a cold seafood salad.

I've made a bread similar to this one for years. However, it does need salt added to the dough. I also sometimes kneed in either pitted kalamata olives or sliced sun dried oil cured tomatoes (well drained saving the oil to make the bread) with fresh rosemary from the garden. Don't bake it on a baking sheet either; let it rise on a piece of parchment paper. Preheat baking stones in a 400 degree oven for at least 30 minutes before baking the bread. After punching indentations in the top, sprinkle with the olive oil from the drained tomatoes and salt. Then bake the bread directly on the baking stones for about 30 - 40 minutes. Now, that real Tuscan Flat Bread.

I just made the bread. The texture of the bread and the crust turned out great but the flavor is a little flat. I recommend adding some salt to the flour before making the dough.

I think that this is one of the best breads I have ever eaten. I surprised my family with it one afternoon and they couldn't believe it. So simple, yet so good. If only all breads could be this great. I also agree that some herbs in the bread gives it a great new flavor and is a wonderful way to experiment.

I have tried quite a few foccacia and flatbread recipes. This was absolutely the best! We loved the salt on top.I will make this frequently, especially with the addition of fresh herbs.

Really liked this recipe. A breeze to make and tastes great too. I added some thinly sliced onions that I had boiled in ruby port for another recipe... hated to throw them out and they looked attractive on the bread.

Great bread. Recipe sounded a bit strange - so much yeast, so few ingredients - but it works. In my experience (twice) it does not need 1 1/4 hours to rise - more like 30 minutes first time. It was too salty for our taste first time. Second time I used only 1 teaspoon (table salt) and added fresh rosemary.

This bread was so simple and had such simple, common ingredients that I couldn't believe it when I first tasted it. It was SO good!!! I would definitely make this again.

The bread was easy to prepare and simply wonderful to eat. The texture is delightful and the olive oil and salt give is a very simple and earthy flavor. I substituted table salt for sea salt.

This bread couldn't have been better if I had cooked it in ashes of the hearth. I added herbs to the butter. The next time I bake the bread I'll hollow out the center and add a spinach dip. This will make a great party dish.
