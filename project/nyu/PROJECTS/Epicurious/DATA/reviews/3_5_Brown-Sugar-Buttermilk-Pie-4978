Really easy and tasty. Definitely a keeper!

I used the buttermilk pie crust for this pie and yet still felt that it turned out very subdued in flavor. I love custardy pies, so it was a slight disappointment. I remedied this by brulee-ing the top of it and served with wine-poached pears. I would say that this pie serves well as a base for a delicious dessert, but is not a showstopper on its own.

I get more requests for this pie at holiday time than any other. And, it's so easy to make, I'm always happy to oblige. It's just the right combination of sweetness. Superb!

Very, Very easy to make. Didn't have a processor so I just mixed with mixer. Needs to cook for at LEAST as long as it says. Great flavor.

This has become my favorite pie recipe! It is easy to make, delicious to eat, fun to share. Since frozen pie shells come two to a package, I always double the recipe and make two at once. When doing so, I will use 7 whole eggs rather than 6 and 2 yolks.

So easy and simple. I use leftover buttermilk that I have on hand from a cake recipe that I frequently make. It's a nice dessert for a spicy dinner...I always serve it with my famous chili! I also heat caramel sauce (the kind for ice cream sundaes) and drizzle over slices of pie...really ups the taste factor.

The sort of dish that redefines and deepens your love affair with pie. A friend brought this to a potluck style get together and guests fought over the last pieces, no really. I've made it for myself several times and this thanksgiving while hosting my husbands family for the first time I know that even if I ruin the turkey all will be forgotten once they have this pie. The best! Done!

this is easy enough to make but doesn't really taste like anything... not buttermilk, not caramel. husband didn't like it, and though its not bad i doubt i'll make it again. there are better ways to use up excess buttermilk

I have had the buttermilk pie at Sellers Market and this particular recipe not only has an incomparable taste but a texture that can be labeled as "exquisite". The Sellers Market product is one-dimensional in taste as well as overall "mass-appeal"...I have made this pie several times for my employees and they nearly beg me for this recipe!

If this dish doesn't taste absolutely delicious, then you're either making it wrong or your taste buds are just insane.

I love this pie. It is a must for my co-workers and holidays. I end up cooking it longer too and chill it before serving to make sure it sets.

Good but plain & not sweet enough...

I've made this recipe since last year with rave reviews. My 7 year old LOVES it and she's a chocolate fanatic. I took it to a party and again, everyone loved it (that time I substituted milk with lemon juice and let it set first). It looks very pretty too, if you flute the crust very simply and carmalize some brown sugar on top.

I have never had a pie like this. It is different. The top of the pie is kind of crunchy and the middle is creamy. Not bad but not great. Don't think I will make it again though. I did have to bake it longer than stated. About 55 min.

i used the buttermilk pie dough recipe for the dough. also, for easier clean up, i put the filling ingredients in the blender and used room temp butter instead of melting then cooling...was wonderful.

We were rather disappointed with this recipe. We had an unbelievable buttermilk pie the day before at a Seller's Market, so I looked up this recipe. This pie was no where near the other one in neither in taste nor texture.I'll stick to Seller's Market.

I used milk that had gone sour in place of the buttermilk. Two of us finished the pie in a day. It was that good!

Delicious! I love the basic, simple ingredients and the mellow,creamy flavor that comes through. I have made it twice and I am going for a third right now!

Some people loved this -- some people hated it. The main complaint was with the texture. Make sure the pie is not too loose in the center or it won't jell all the way. Great flavor.

I substituted Egg Beaters and egg whites for the whole eggs. I found the pie to be best when still warm and fluffy, with a slightly crisp top. I served it with frozen yogurt. After cooling and setting, the pie became smooth and creamy, but also very flat.

It had at smooth taste. I enjoy it.I'm you have people cook the crust before they fil it , it give it an extra texter t feel.
