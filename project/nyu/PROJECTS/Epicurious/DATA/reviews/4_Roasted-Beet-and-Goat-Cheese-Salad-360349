Yum! Great reviews from the family dinner last night! I didn't have sherry vinegar, so I used white wine vinegar and a splash of Sherry from my cabinet (which is probably vinegar at this point...). I also subbed olive oil for the grapeseed oil since I didn't have any. The rest, I did to a T. Light and tasty. Will absolutley make this again.

Finally, a beet recipe that compares to a local restaurant . . . Izakaya Den in Denver. OMG. Fantastic. I also did not have fennel bulb nor grapeseed oil however, everything was spectacular! I whipped the dressing w/o a blender. Used olive oil. I only had red beets. Not only did I have garden fresh arugula but also added spinach and some mesculan greens - fantastic. I agree with previous reviewers, the dressing is wonderful and light. Goat cheese crumbles better is first frozen and then thawed. Will make again and again!

I really like this dressing as well. I've added toasted hazelnuts, shredded carrots, and whatever else is on hand. It's the first time I've tried fennel - I'd been avoiding it because of the licorice smell - but it turns out that I love it!

This has become an instant staple at our home. It's great as-is, but also as a base recipe to modify with whatever you have on hand. I have subed the fennel for red onion and added roasted tomatoes. I can't rave enough about this one!

This is an excellent salad -- so flavorful and beautiful. A wonderful way to enjoy beets and goat cheese. Have made it many times, to rave reviews. Love it!

I've made this twice already in the past week and can already see that this will be a mainstay in my diet. The dressing is light, not overly sweet, and the goat cheese is a great addition. I roast the beets with the oven timer set to turn off when cooked and assemble days later when I'm ready to eat. This is so easy to make--I am no longer intimidated by beets!

Great way to use some CSA veggies. Ended up boiling the beets to save some cooking time and they were still delicious. Also, didn't use the fennel bulb. Dressing is subtle used in the small quantity recommended and really lets the tastiness of the rest of the ingredients shine through. Also, I love goat cheese.
