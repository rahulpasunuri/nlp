Bummer! Mine turned out to be little sugar bricks. I admit that the disastrous results are probably my fault... but I don't know where I went wrong! Serves me right for going the pre-made route.

I am so excited to find this recipe. I used to make it years ago when our boys were young. Now our youngest is 37 and they are all coming for Sunday brunch and I thought it would be great to have these sticky buns. I could not find my original recipe but I think this is identical to the one that I had! Yahoo! Alice in Phx

I made these with my son on a frigid Sunday afternoon to eat by the fireplace. Couldn't be better. I used 2-3tsp cinnamon. Yes, they do taste a little like they were made with artificial dough (but I believe that was on the list of ingredients, right?). Gooey and sweet and easy to make.

Yummy when you're in a time pinch! It is way too sweet, though. I'd also recommend increasing the cinnamon and lemon juice to improve the flavor.

Quick alternative to real homemade sticky buns, but when i crave sticky buns, this is not the recipe i would use....

Wow! Just the carmel roll recipe that I've been looking for! Being a southerner, I used pecans instead of walnuts. Since I wanted little rolls for a brunch buffet, I rolled from the long side and cut the dough into 16 pieces. I made multipe recipes in large glass casserole pans, let them sit in the pans overnight, and reheated and turned them out in the morning. Worked great!

I was most disappointed in these. Especially after reading the other reviews. I folllowed the recipe exactly but found them to be nothing special at all. Not something I would bother with again.

These are amazing -- the syrup turns into a wonderfully sticky caramel that oozes all over the buns as you turn the pan upside down on a plate. I'm afraid I ate a full four buns before they even cooled!

This is by far the best and easiest recipe for sticky buns that I have ever made. Forget about the rest of them. These are the "best".

After reading the great reviews for this recipe, I was really disappointed with the results. They didn't taste anything at all like cinnamon rolls, they TASTED like they'd been made with an artificial dough (which they had been), and they weren't too great in terms of aesthetics, either. the flavor was ok, and they were definitely easy, but i'll save the recipe for desperate situations.

Didn't feel like rolling out the dough so I just tore each triangle in half and scrunched it into a ball. I put them in the pan after pouring the syrup in the bottom. Then I used 1/4 cup white sugar (by mistake) and poured in on top of the balls. Also I used 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of 1/4(again by mistake) in the syrup mixture. This variation was even better than the original recipe.

I tried these for Valentine Days breakfast. Hubby just loved them, said they were almost like the original Pennsylvania ones.
