The pot pie part of recipe was very good, but the dilled biscuit topping was dry, and I followed recipe exactly. Next time I would use an Epi recipe for biscuits that I have made before and just add some dill. So, I'd give this 2 forks for the biscuits and a 4 for the pot pie, which I made in a casserole instead of individual dishes.

This pot pie recipe is totally killer. The biscuit topping, the warm, creamy filling, all of it is delicious and soul-warming. I don't like mushrooms so I substitute fennel for the mushrooms and put them in at the same time as the onions to saute. I also like to make this in a large casserole dish so people can help themselves to as much or as little as they want without being limited to a ramekin-sized serving. I cook it at 400 for 40-50 minutes when cooking in a large casserole.

Pretty good recipe. It allowed me to use up some things I had in the house. I thought it was too much liquid in the bottom of the dish on the first day. But the biscuit soaked some up as I ate.

Great recipe. Used olive oil instead of butter. Doubled the veggies. Used rotisserie chicken and added carcass to 1L of chicken stock for broth. Used 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream. Made dumplings/biscuits using Bisquick. Family loved it!

Great recipe. I didn't add peppers and doubled the frozen vegetables. I skipped the heavy cream and the sauce was delicious regardless. I hadn't thought about how much fat goes into the biscuits. I will try reducing it next time. My husband loved this recipe!

Not much to say other than this was a great recipe. Still searching for my perfect pot pie, though!

a fantastic "model recipe" for chicken pot pie. i've already made it twice in two weeks! i added some more veggies and used whole milk instead of heavy cream. it really is worth making the biscuits, but they don't need shortening. i just used an extra 1/3 cup of buttermilk, and they were excellent.

Very good basic recipe. Needs a bit more flavor. I would add white wine to cook the chicken next time and some more herbs. Like others, I added some additional vegtables and used Bisquick which worked great. Instead of the cream, I used non-fat sour cream - it gave it the same amount of creaminess, texture, etc... Worked out great.

I made this last night using leftover roasted chicken and Bisquick. I followed the recipe pretty closely - except I used fresh thyme and baked it in a large casserole instead of individual dishes. My husband and children raved and finished it all in one sitting! Will make again and again.

I used frozen biscuits, baked seperately, and used boneless breast of chicken to poach in the broth. This was a quick and easy meal that my whole family enjoyed. It will become a regular!

Wonderful! I used rotisserie chicken from the store and that saved a lot of time. Next time I think I will add some more vegetables. It's a great easy weeknight dinner.

The basic recipe is good. I make it in one big pot with store bought pie crust on top. It does, however, need tweaking of the flavor. I add garlic and hot sauce to the saute along with more frozen peas, and more peppers.

I didn't use salt because of a diet, and this recipe, shared with my daighter, was a real winner for both of us......Don & Cher

This is one of my favorite recipes. My husband, who usually doesn't like pot pies or chicken, adores this. I'll make only 2 servings at a time, since it's just the two of us. I've also had the problem with the dough not being completely done. The trick is to make sure the filling is hot and the biscuit dough at room temperature before you put it in the oven. This is especially true if you're re-heating the next day.

Excellent. Sometimes I use puff pastry instead of the dill buscuits when in a hurry. Added brocoli, baby corn, and crimini mushrooms. Was a hit!

i was missing some key ingredients so i used this recipe as a template, with what was on hand for the filling. i added a little sage since i had no dill. it got rave reviews and every scrap was gobbled up!

Instead of store-bought broth, I used home-made broth. To cut down on the fat content, I used 2 tbsp of butter and 3 tbsp of margarine, and skim milk instead of whipping cream. I also used this recipe with a smaller chicken (3 lbs) without changing other quantities, shiitake mushrooms instead of button mushrooms, frozen peas instead of frozen mixed vegetables. Turned out great! For an even lower fat recipe, I may used skinned chicken parts next time and just white meat. I had it over rice instead of biscuits to cut down even more on fat.

This was pretty good, and VERY easy to make. The store did not have buttermilk, so I used Bisquick and added fresh dill. It turned out great. The filling could use a little more flavor, although what, I couldn't say.

addendum to my previous comment... the link for the dilled biscuits did not work, but i found the recipe for the dilled biscuits after doing a separate search... i hope this recipe turns out as good as i am anticipating after reading all the positive reviews.

I've made this three times now - always to excellent reviews. Even for company! My biscuits came out perfect - I used the food processor to combine the ingredients. The only change I made after the first time was to cut down on the thyme.

I've made this several time to excellent reviews. Plus, you get to use the joke that you're making dill biscuit dough.

I made this recipe without the cream and it turned out great. I also added a number of other vegetables, the more the better. Make sure to taste test after adding the chicken broth and before baking, I found that the spices needed adjusting. It was a big hit with my family -- they keep asking when I'm going to make it again.

Great recipe. If pressed for time substitute frozen buttermilk biscuits on top.

This was a snap for a quick hot meal.I cheated and used store bought biscuits,used fresh dill,and thyme.I also spread the biscuits across the chicken mixture in a casserole dish instead.I turned the oven up to 400 to make sure the biscuits got cooked thru( watch they don't burn) My picky boyfriend loved it.

This dish was delicious--but the biscuits were not cooked all the way through as someone else mentioned. I think next time I will precook the biscuits for a few minutes. I substituted whole milk for the cream.

I was disappointed in this recipe. Smelled wonderful while it was cooking--but somehow didn't deliver. I, too, had problems with the biscuits. Mine were extraordinarily dry. Agree with the comment that the cream doesn't add anything except calories. I will not make again.

I used some of the ideas here and just used b/s chicken breasts and cut down on the dill in the biscuits. The pot pie was fabulous! My picky kids even gobbled down the biscuits. Next time I'll skip the cream that's added to the chicken mixture at the end. I don't think it added anything other than unneeded calories. Yummy!

I took a couple of shortcuts for this recipe. I prefer chicken breasts, so I just boiled them in the canned broth. I didn't have any buttermilk so I used bisquick and added dill to it. It turned out wonderful. It was everything I wanted a pot pie to be.

For some reason, my biscuits didn't come out fully baked. My guess is they were too thick. In fact, the top was a perfect golden brown while the bottom was totally raw (?????). Next time, I'll just bake the biscuits separate and place them on top of the warm chicken mixture....also, replace the butter with Olive oil and add a tsp. or so of sugar, tastes good and is a little more healthy.

I was in a hurry and skipped boiling the whole chicken. I used cooked chicken breasts and the canned broth. The results were great. The biscuits were wonderful although my family found the dill taste too strong. Next time I will replace the dill with a little garlic and shredded cheese.

Yum. Didn't have individual baking dishes, so I actually made it in two loaf pans with two biscuits atop each. Kind of labor intensive, but turns out just like chicken pot pie should - hearty and comforting. Leftovers were pretty good, too.
