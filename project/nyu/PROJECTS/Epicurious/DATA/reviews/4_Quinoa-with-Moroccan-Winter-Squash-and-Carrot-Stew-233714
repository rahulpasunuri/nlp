Very good recipe. I ended up puréeing the leftovers with some vegetable broth (quinoa and all) into a soup that I could freeze. Might have even preferred it as a soup.

can only rate this based on making the quinoa, which was easy, yummy and the best quinoa that i have made, used a pressure cooker

I've now made this twice: once with sweet paprika as the recipe calls for and once with smoked paprika as many reviewers recommend. I can say unequivocally that the recipe has it right - use sweet paprika. It is far, far better with sweet. It is delicious, beautiful and easy.

My family loved this. Nice spice with just a bit of heat. Added chickpeas near the end of cooking time. Very hearty and flavorful.

This is a delectable dish as the recipe is written. I've shared it several friends and been thanked for doing so. It was much better with red quinoa, which keeps its shape and nuttiness, than with white, which can get gluey if you don't cook it very carefully, usually with less water than the package calls for. I skipped the minced carrot in the quinoa once to speed preparation and didn't miss it, but do use the onion and turmeric, and by no means omit the cilantro from the finished dish. The mint is a nice touch too--not sure whether I'll shell out for it when I can't get it from the garden, but it does add an appealing note. Note that this recipe is not only vegetarian but also vegan and gluten free, but it's delicious enough to satisfy those who don't have those preferences. It was popular even at my church supper, where meat and carbs are more or less required and vegetables almost never appear.

Absolutely delicious! Highly recommend it. I followed the recipe exactly except I halved the cayenne and left out the cilantro. We were having a friend over and I was not sure what her stance on spicy and cilantro were. I thought it was perfect with the half cayenne. I bought a brand new bottle of paprika just for this and I think it helped because it is a primary spice in this dish. Made some sauteed Swiss Chard with garlic and currants to have on the side, and it was a really nice complement visually to the meal. Make this dish!

I think using smoked paprika instead of sweet is a huge mistake. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used smoked instead and then found myself wishing it had a bit of sweetness so added some cinnamon and ras el hanout. Given how easy this was to make (and how beautiful it is) I will try it again w/o the smoked paprika, but I would not make it again with it. So my 2-forks are for using smoked. Probably will be higher with sweet paprika instead.

Rating: 4
Really delicious and incredibly healthy. Unlike other reviewers, I found the quinoa to be perfect under the stew. The texture of the quinoa was an important addition. I had to make a few substitutions and changes. Omitted turmeric and saffron. Used smoked paprika instead of sweet. Raves from everyone! 5 ample servings.

One of my absolute favorite recipes! So easy to make and it is fantastic. As an added bonus its even better the next day when teh flavors have melded a bit more. I usually serve it on a bed of kale as a bonus. I love it.

I made the stew with all the ingredients I had on hand(regular paprika, not the sweet kind. I also didn't have lemon juice or cayenne pepper, and I substituted the butternut squash with zucchini because that's what I had). I followed the measurements mentioned in the recipe, and the stew turned out great! Absolutely delicious.

Rating: 4
What a great dish! On the advice of several reviews, I added a can of chick peas, which turned out to be a great idea. I also used vegetable broth instead of water in the stew, and added a whole 28-oz can of diced tomatoes instead of the 14-oz mini-can called for. If you're not crazy about heat, cut down on the cayenne; if you like it spicy, add more. I can't wait to make this again.

Rating: 3
The stew was amazing! Added the chick peas and raisins, but would try it with couscous instead. The quinoa has such a distinct taste that it actually muted the stew instead of enhancing it. Next time, couscous or rice.

What did I do wrong? I followed the recipe almost exactly and was expecting to be blown away. Visually the colors were very appealing but that was about it. Wasn't bad just not that great. All I could find was sweet smoked paprika. Maybe that's what changed the flavor?

Rating: 4
Wow. This dish was very tasty--and I'm not even that fond of squash. Will definitely put into the rotation. I was careless with my spice measurements (rounding down) but it was still very flavorful. Took the suggestion of others and added a handful of raisins - which were good but it would have been great without them. I think next time I'll try it with pearl couscous.

Rating: 4
OMG, the stew is one of the best things I've ever eaten. I read the reviews, looked at what was in my cupboard, and made the following changes: Smokey paprika instead of sweet -- incredible! Cut the salt in half. Gebhardt chili powder instead of cayenne. Added a can of rinsed and drained garbanzos and a 1/2 cup of currants. Tried it with and without the cilantro and mint. I like it better without. The stew by itself is wonderful. I ate a small bowl as soon as it was done and then I ate another small bowl. I made the quinoa at dinner time. It's very good. Here's the kicker. I like both of these dishes separately more than I like them together. The stew doesn't need the quinoa and the quinoa doesn't need the stew. The stew will become a staple for me. It's that good (and that easy).

Wow! This is a delicious, healthy and satisfying meal. My 3 year old, husband (who's a butcher) both loved it. I will be making this again!

I made this because I had squash and carrots to use. I thought it was very good - but needed some brightness to the heavy flavors. I added golden raisins on top for garnish and that was just what it needed. (That said, I didn't have fresh cilantro or mint on hand, so that's probably what was missing.) Next time I will make it with fresh herbs and add the raisins. Currants would be delicious too. I only used half the cayenne because I was worried it would be too hot for the kids. Even at half, it was at the top of my hot tolerance. Maybe mixing in a bit of coconut milk would help temper it. I'll have to try that next time when I have a better stocked pantry. All in all, a fulfilling, tasty, nutritious meal.

I love Moroccan cuisine and this did not disappoint me. The cayenne gives the stew just a hint of heat without overwhelming the other flavors. I followed this recipe verbatim. The idea of using quinoa to replace traditional cous cous turned out beautifully. Next time I make this I will add a small hand full of golden raisins to the quinoa. Raisins are an integral part of Moroccan cuisine and would complement this. Adding 3/4 c. of chickpeas to the stew would give it more authenticity as well. One could still make this as is, however, and have a lovely dinner. This was so comforting on a chilly autumn night. mmm.

This was really good, not over the top though. I doubled the recipe because I had a large crowd. If you do double it, I would not double the cayenne pepper. It was too hot. The quinoa was fabulous. I will make that part again.

Great stew with great flavors! I didn't have turmeric or saffron on hand. Also, I added some extra kick w/ hot chili paste just for a thrill. I might try it with chickpeas next time as the other reviewers suggested.

Quite easy to prepare with already peeled and cubed squash from whole foods. Followed suggestions from previous reviews and added a drained can of chick peas, a handful of currants and a handful of slivered almonds. What a wonderful balance of complex flavors and textures! We are carnivores and LOVED this dish!

My grandmother sent me this recipe to try because she loved it so much after finding it on epicurious. I was hesitant as I'm not a big squash fan. However, grandma was right! My husband and I both surprisingly enjoyed it! I added chickpeas after reading another review suggesting that, and think that gave it more substance. But it was a great recipe and I will make it again.

Rating: 4
This was exceptional. I used fire-roasted tomatoes, since that's what I had on hand, and I think it added an extra level of awesomeness to the stew. I also found that I needed to cook the stew for an additional 10 minutes to get the veggies to the desired doneness.

This recipe is definitely a keeper. My only substitution was using smoked paprika instead of sweet. The smokey flavor combined with the middle eastern spices to create an intensely flavorful, complex and satisfying dish. Perfect for a cold or rainy night!

This recipe is great. Per others advice, I added golden raisins and chopped almonds to the stew, which gave it added flavor and texture. Also added 2 italian mild sausages, with casings removed since my husband does not allow me to make anything vegetarian! Next time I'm going to try it with some ground lamb in it... Additionally- per the reviews I read, I doubled the quinoa - this is very necessary for the amount of stew that it makes!

I served this with Naan bread last night. I increased everything by 1/2, including the quinoa, for a family of 4.About one serving left over. You can taste the cayenne, but it wasn't too hot. I increased the spices overall, and it had a great flavor. A LOT of chopping though!

I made this for the family this weekend, and it was delicious. I am not a vegetarian, so instead of 2 cups of water, I added 1 cup water 1 cup beef stock. I also served it with a grilled flank steak that was marinated in a moroccan inspired concoction. While this was cooking, I was thinking that the cayenne was going to be too much, but the fresh mint and cilantro at the end really brings things together nicely. I like hot and spicy dishes so when I do this again, I am leaving the cayenne. If I were cooking it for people that I knew were sensitive to it, I'd cut the cayenne in half. This really is a great dish, and something that I am definitely going to do again.

Rating: 3
A great vegetarian recipe with a couple changes. To the stew I added whole almonds for texture and raisins for sweetness a few minutes before serving. As others recommended I also cut the cayenne in half. I didn't have ground ginger so subbed allspice. I'll definitely add to the veggie rotation.

Rating: 4
Delicious blend of spices. I went with many recommendations to increase the spices and cut the cayenne. I couldn't find information about the # of servings. I doubled the recipe for 7 women and there was barely enough quinoa (not large servings) but lots of left over stew. Suggest doubling the quinoa to stew ratio.

Rating: 3
I made the recipe as stated, except I didn't have diced tomatoes, so I used tomato sauce (8 oz) and used dried mint. I thought it was good, but not great. It is pretty hot, and the quinoa was delicious, but over all it lacked something... I think it would taste great with meat. I did see other reviews noting they added raisins and nuts, and I do think that would be yummy. I agree that even though I cut the squash and the carrots smaller than directed, the carrots were not soft enough...

Rating: 4
Yummy! This is definitely staying in my recipe box forever! I added dried cranberries & walnuts to the quinoa (I didn't have raisins or almonds, but it was delicious nonetheless!) And I also added a can of white cannellini beans (as someone else suggested). Super good & even better as leftovers! **Note: I would say to beware on the cayenne pepper - I would add less of it than what the recipe calls for.

Fantastic. Just the simple Quinoa recipe alone is worth making, but the stew is wonderful. I used really delicious, sweet Hubbard Squash. Added yams and sweet potatoes. Would add corn next time. Go easy on saffron because just a few strands can overpower the dish. I also ground fresh coriander which really gave it some voom. I will be making this dish over and over for the rest of my life. GREAT!!

Can't say enough about how good this is. Add raisins or currants to the quinoa - the flavors play off nicely with the veggies. Yes, you can increase the spices (go easy on the cayenne, esp if you use smoked paprika). I double the quinoa and had way too much leftover, so I don't think you really need to do that.

This was lovely! Thanks to all for the great ideas. Made the stew the day before and doubled the spices, (not the cayenne). Added left-over barley, raisins, currants and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the quinoa. Next time I'll add slivered almonds or pine nuts. What a wonderful dish, and someday I'll read ALL of the reviews!

The squash and carrot stew is delicious and easy to make. The only change I amde was to omit the coriander (all out) and substitute 1/2 vegetable broth for 1/2 the water. The only reason I didn't give it 4 forks was the quinoa which I did not care for at all (and wasn't particularly healthy considering the butter and oil). The stew is great with brown rice - eating the leftovers now!

Excellent!! Doubled the spices (except the cayenne) and wasn't too spicy. Didn't have mint on hand but I think it would have enhanced the dish. Added chick peas and green beans. This was my first time using quinoa (hard to find in my area). Used black quinoa; had a really different and interesting flavor.

I was expecting great things from this dish due to the excellent reviews however I was disappointed in the end. I didn't have the saffron on hand, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The stew was too spicy and it took a lot longer to cook the carrots through than 20 minutes. The quinoa was my favorite part. I ended up throwing out the stew, mixing the quinoa with proscuitto and ricotta salata and stuffing the mixture into a roasted red pepper. Overall, a big (time- consuming) disappointment).

Rating: 4
As others have mentioned this is a tasty, simple dish that's easy to tinker with depending on what you have on hand. I also doubled all the spices (except the cayenne). The quinoa portion of the recipe would work well alongside other African inspired dishes. It's a delicious way to prepare this grain.

Rating: 4
Major yum. I make the stew as written with the following changes as suggested by other reviewers: lessen olive oil to one T; double spices; substitute chicken broth for water; use 16 oz. of baby carrots (unchopped) and add two 15 oz. cans of drained and rinsed chickpeas. I saute the onion and garlic in a skillet, then combine with remaining ingredients to finish cooking the stew in a crock pot on low for a couple hours until flavors have melded. As directed, I cook the stew and quinoa (reduce oil by half; skip mint and double fresh cilantro) separately then make my own frozen meal by placing 3/4 cup of the prepared quinoa in a 1 qt. freezer bag with 3/4 to 1 cup of the stew, then freeze the package for a fabulous work day lunch or quick dinner. The aroma while cooking fresh or reheating in the microwave never fails to produce food envy! My calculations place this meal at about 340 calories and a million times better and healthier than any prepared meal available store- bought. I have lost quite a bit of weight by preparing other meals in this manner and hope this tip will be useful to others.

This was exceptional, but only with some modifications. I followed the lead of other reviewers: add chick peas to the stew about 10 minutes before finished. Add 1/4 cup of raisins to quinoa before steaming. Double all spices EXCEPT cayenne, which I omitted since I'm feeding a toddler. Double the quinoa recipe. I also used caramelized onions in place of onions for both recipes since I have them on hand and needed to use them up. I was going to follow the spices as written, but tasted halfway through simmering the vegetables and was completely disappointed with the flavor. Reviewer who went to Morocco is right; you need to double the spices for the stew. Other review was also right: you have to double the amount of quinoa if you want enough to serve with the stew. You could easily cut this in half for two people, but the leftovers are going to make a divine lunch. So, I'd make as stated. Also tried the yogurt with it. That was good. But it does muddy the delicate flavor of this exceptional (with revisions) dish.

Rating: 3
I used some of the suggestions from previous reviewers. I followed the recipe except that I used chicken stock instead of water for both recipes. I made a yogurt "sauce" with plain yogurt & feta. I'm glad I did because this was HOT. I'd cut the cayenne in half next time. (I can handle some heat, but WHOA NELLIE!) The quinoa was delicious. I'll make that again. The stew was flavorful, but a lot of work for something that wasn't stand-alone. In my opinion, the yogurt/feta sauce made it. I might make this again, but it's not something to keep in rotation.

This was good but not super outstanding. I missed the meat. It improved in flavor the next day though. Next time I'd cut the carrot and squash smaller.

I've been to Morocco twice and adore vegetable tagine, so this recipe made me very excited. However, it turned out blah. There was little juice and we could barely taste the spices. I added the garbonzos and raisins (thank goodness!) If I make it again, I would at least double all the spices and cut the vegetables smaller. I had big carrots and the 3/4 inch chunks took about 40 minutes to cook, rather than 20 stated in the recipe.

I made this several days ago and am still enjoying the leftovers (it makes enough for eight). Like others I cut the cayenne in half and it still came close to obliterating all the other spices (and I like hot). So you might start with less and add as needed. I also added the chickpeas and golden raisins. Lovely color and presentation. Nice winter vegan dish for all those who've resolved to cut meat out of their diets!

This dish is incredibly simple, yet it always impresses. I didn't think this could get any better, until I subbed 1 preserved lemon, diced, for the lemon juice. It was exquisite.

I have followed some of the other reviewers' suggestions and added cinnamon, raisins or cranberries, and chick peas, and all have been delicious. As far as the recipe being labor intensive, I buy pre-cut butternut squash at one of my local grocery stores. It's pricier, but worth the time saved. My family loves this recipe!

Agree about the garbanzo beans. This is a rich, savory recipe that could use another bland note. They work great. Agree with all the comments about the spice level. Use half the cayenne and you'll be fine. Your guests will probably still comment about how spicy the dish is if you use half the cayenne.

very pretty for presentation. equally as delicious as enticing. made it twice, first time without mint (didn't have it), second time with mint. I think I liked it more without the mint. Fresh coriander (cilanro) is very necessary. will make again. Looks like something for a holiday.

This is quite good as written, but could be even better. I didn't have the mint or cilantro on hand, and I used frozen cubed butternut squash instead of fresh, which saved on the prep time. Like other commenters have said, this is a good, versatile base and will be fun to experiment with. Next time I might use sweet potato instead of the carrots or add garbanzos or raisins, whatever. I'll also try upping the spices (except the cayenne--this has a nice level of heat already) and adding a little cinnamon. Glad to have another meat-eater-pleasing vegetarian recipe to add to my collection. Yum!

I wish they would allow 3.5 forks. I really loved this base recipe. I added chick peas, some cinnamon and raisins. I probably added 25% more butternut squash and broth but didn't up the spices since some said it was too spicy. I should have increased the spices. A bit too sweet so I will definitley make it again with adjustments. A good recipe to play with. Husband loved it and beautiful presentation for guests.

Yum! So good. I took a lot of the suggestions from previous reviews - I added a small sweet potato to round out the squash and added a can of garbanzos. Also used chicken stock and the juice from tomatoes. I doubled all of the spices. So good. Next time I will double the quinoa and omit the carrots entirely. And there will be a next time.

Definitely not quick! I added one large sweet potato and a small turnip, so had plenty of peeling and chopping to do.. but I asked for it. This was terrific. I bumped up the spices, added raisins into the quinoa and made a raita with plain yogurt, mint, feta and cumin. The quinoa needs to be doubled, this was really only enough for 2 hungry people where there were at least 4 servings of the stew.

Not exactly "quick & easy" as there is plenty of chopping involved as well as some careful timing, but one of the more completely satiating recipes I've whipped up in awhile.

This was a huge hit with everyone in the family; including my picky children! As other reviewers suggested, I substituted 1 c. chicken broth for the water in the stew.

I did all of the chopping ahead of time and also mixed together the spices ahead of time. Then, the actual meal came together very quickly.

PERFECT! I loved it! This one is a keeper! I substituted chicken broth for water :)

I made this as part of my Rosh Hashanah menu. It was a HUGE hit! I omitted the butter (used olive oil instead) and the garlic (preference). This is a recipe I am adding to my repertoire for sure! The majority of my guests were Moroccan, and they all raved! Oh, I would agree with the other reviewers regarding the cayenne pepper. If you are sensitive to spicy, definitely reduce (for us it was perfect!)

I make this dish at least a few times a year. (I'm someone who rarely makes anything twice.) A fantastic fall/winter staple. I like it with chickpeas and sometimes with a less sweet, meatier squash like kabocha. I sometimes use a bag of "baby carrots" to save time. The quinoa is nice as a side dish on its own.

Rating: 4
My husband and I really enjoyed this dish. I added about a cup of chickpeas as other reviewers suggested and omitted the saffron (too $$). It was a little time-consuming peeling and chopping, but well worth it. I made a cream cheese and fresh herb soup to go with it but my husband wound up spooning the soup over his stew, which was really tasty and complimented the heat from the stew. I wil defintely make it again.

This is a very labor-intensive recipe, but it was well worth it in the end. I cooked the quinoa in a rice cooker--perfection as usual. I also used fresh tomatoes. Don't leave the squash in chunks that are too big, like I did. They cooked well at the bigger size, but you want them bite size.

Rating: 4
This recipe was SO yummy! I took the advice of the other posters and added chickpeas, golden raisins, and garam masala. Also upped the spice, left out the cayenne (couldn't find it in my cabinet- no big loss), included sweet potato since I only had one squash, used mint olive oil. Cooked it all together rather than doing the quinoa separately, per one of the other posters-- it was much easier, but it took the full 35 minutes to cook (I put extra quinoa because I didn't like it so soupy). Also used red quinoa (what I had on hand)-- the made the colors of whole dish gorgeous.

Delicious, easy, and healthy. This has become one of our staples. I serve the stew with whole wheat couscous from Trader Joe's, as it is much cheaper than quinoa.

Rating: 3
I didn't really see much point in making the quinoa and stew separately. While it looks nice, it's kind of a time wasting step. Now I just add 3 cups of liquid to the stew instead of 1 and add 2 cups of quinoa at the same time as the vegetables. And like other reviewers I add a better variety of veggies, chickpeas, whatever I have on hand. Serve it up in a bowl and you have an easy weekday dinner.

Rating: 4
I forgot to include I made a mint/cucumber raita which was a lovely complement to the stew, and I did find the amount of quinoa that the recipe provides is way too little for the amount of stew. Definitely, at least double the quinoa.

Rating: 4
So many helpful tips in the reviews. I made it pretty much as written - I did up the spices, cut back some on the cayenne. Used chicken broth instead of plain water. I only had a small squash, so I added one small/medium sweet potato to the squash and carrots. While looking through my fridge - I came across a little bit of cooked chicken that got thrown in, as well as a red bell pepper and some frozen peas (at the last minute to keep their color.) Added raisins and chick-peas per so many comments - they were a great addition. The quinoa was fabulous - made it just like the recipe and I wouldn't change a thing. Rice or couscous would be fine, but this grain was great. This is the dish for my next dinner party.

WOW! Loved it and will serve it for my bosses very soon! I licked my plate ;) Doubled all spices except for salt and pepper and fresh herbs. Even doubled cayenne and thought it was fine (but I like spicy). If making for 4 people, I would double the quinoa recipe and have leftover; otherwise you are kind of left with 2:1 stew to quinoa. I am SO full now! Very tasty.

This is a simple and healthy vegetarian recipe, but I didn' find the flavours anything too special. Would probably have been more interesting with a greater diversity of vegetables, especially zuchini and spinach, and maybe with some raisins thrown in too.

I have made this many times but with a few additions that I just love. I add more water, more veg (usually sweet and regular potato, parsnip, zuchinni), a can of (drained) chickpeas, a handful of chopped cilantro and about a 1/2 can of coconut milk. Delicious, hearty, vegetarian and my kids love it too!

I made this last week and followed the recipe almost exactly - substituted sweet potato for the butternut squash and added some zucchini at the end. It came out delicious! My husband said it was one of the best meals I have made!! We ate the leftovers next day and the spices and flavor were just as good as the night before. Love it! Will definitely make this again.

Rating: 3
My first quinoa cooking experience (first review as well!), and it was delicious and satisfying (this, coming from a meat eater). Lengthier process than suggested though. Rinsing and draining quinoa is not savory in and of itself  little buggers just want to drain through every mesh strainer I had. Had to research draining methods. I upped the spices  half more than suggested  and thought it wonderfully aromatic and probably better suited to the sweetness of the cooked squash. Do not skip the fresh herbs! If you've already undertaken the other dried spices, why deny the final finishing glory of fresh ones? Lovely complexity to a vegetarian dish. Bravo, Bruce and Nancy.

Rating: 3
A very good weeknight dinner, especially when I have a large squash taking up space in my fruit basket! I used a whole Buttercup squash, and had to double the recipe to accommodate for the amount of it! Also, I had no Quinoa, so I used couscous, though I would to try this Quinoa in the future, to see the difference in taste. I found the carrots added nothing to the dish, as the smooth, sweet taste of the squash in the spicy broth was enough for me, but it's just a personal preference. Next time, I will probably just leave the carrots out.

Rating: 4
I absolutely love this recipe and make it often. For the cook who thought the squash is too hard to peel, get a good peeler. I find it a quick weeknight dish. I use baby carrots, so they don't need peeling and take the same amount of time to cook as the squash. The heat can vary depending on your taste. Be careful. My husband thought it was too hot, but I love it. Chick peas would be a good addition. If you don't have quinoa, use couscous. It is faster, but you loose the protein. The only thing I think might be missing is a little salt. I go heavy on all the spices.

Rating: 3
This was so good. I used no cayenne as I have kids who ate this all up. Made plain quinoa tossed w/cilantro. Added whole almonds. I can't imagine making it again as the squash took WAY too long to peel.

the recipe is great. it was my first go at cooking quinoa and i was suprised at how easy, quick and delicious it was. as for the stew- though it was not as quick as the quinoa it was equally as delicious. i did not find it to be too spicy at all (and i can be quite the baby when it comes to spice.) i did, however, feel as the something was missing as far as the spice combination...nothing really made my taste buds explode as i thought would happen. i think that when i make this again i will experiment with the spices and definitely top it with a dollop of yogurt. also, i did not use any mint and i regret this. i will definitely make this again. p.s. the colors of the final dish are stunning.

Rating: 4
Watch out for the cayenne, this recipe should come with alternatives based on the level of heat desired. I used less than a 1/4 tsp & it was a little too hot, too hot for my son certainly. A 1/2 tsp would have been totally over the top. I'd start with a pinch & add more if you like more heat. Otherwise, we loved the recipe. I served a green salad with cukes & made a yogurt dressing using the herbs, some fresh garlic, S&P. The yogurt was a nice compliment to the heat.

This stew is excellent. We served it with plain couscous, which worked well, and a drizzle of yoghurt which was a soothing complement. Not cooking the vegetables too long is key, as well as chicken broth instead of water. We used a delicata squash instead of a butternut once, which was also successful. The spice blend is the definite keeper part.

Rating: 4
I took other reviewers' suggestions and added half carrots/half sweet potato, broth instead of water. I never measure, but I'm sure I used extra spices. Didn't find it too hot at all. Just right! My hubby normally won't eat squash but he loved this so much, he took leftovers for lunch today! I shared with my veggy neighbours and they're making it tonight! A definite Autumn/Winter keeper!

This is absolutely amazing. I made it for my girlfriend and I and we loved it! I then made it for a party and everyone loved it. I used fresh tomatoes (I don't do canned) and I didn't have any cilantro to top it off and instead used parsley. It was a huge hit!

Lots of chopping involved here.. but a delicious and filling result. I made a few changes: Instead of 2 cups of carrots, I used a sweet potato and two carrots chopped up. I forgot to add paprika, but didn't miss it. Broth instead of water (didn't add additional salt). 2 cups instead of 1 cup of water so make sure there was enough liquid. I also added a tablespoon of tomato paste at the end because it's not tomato-y really at all. ALso added a 1/2 tablespoon of Garam Masala for a little more spice (versus just "hotness"). Served it with goat cheese sprinkled on top. Yummy!!! Froze a few servings for later. ALso, I had more stew than quinoa...

This was fabulous. Like other reviewers, I added a can of chick peas, used a 28 oz can of tomatoes- and didn't drain them, and used vegetable stock instead of water.

This was a wonderful recipe. I used sweet potato instead of squash, they are similar in taste and texture anyhow. The only other change I made was doubling the amount of cumin because we really like cumin. I did not add the carrots and sweet potato at the same time. It has been my experience that sweet potato or squash cooks very qucikly and I did not want mushy sweet potato. So I followed the recipe, added the carrots, covered and cooked 10 minutes, then added the sweet potato and continued cooking until done. That way, both the carrots and sweet potato were done perfectly, just cooked through but firm and not mushy. Some have complained this recipe is too spicy. Heavens no, in fact, I could use a bit more heat, might increase the cayenne next time I make this recipe. I served this with chicken breast and some green beans. Colorful on the plate and very tasty.

I make this dish frequently and have switched it up a little over time: I add a can of chick peas and use a 28oz can of tomatoes (undrained) to make it a little saucier. (I up the spices to compensate for the extra tomatoes). This is a delicious, healthy, satisfying dish. My vegetarian and non- vegetarian friends love it equally. It freezes well also, so I make a double batch.

I absolutely loved this recipe! It was very flavourful and the cayenne pepper added the perfect level of heat. I used freshly minced ginger instead of the ground ginger and vegetable stock instead of water. The stew looked beautiful served in my dark blue dish. A feast for the eyes! The only problem I had was the length of time this dish took to prepare. Next time I will make it on the weekend. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This recipe is bursting with spices and colors. The squash is more a vessel for other tastes than its own flavor, but this dish is great. It's a bit more work than the boast of "easy to make, but well worth it. Tip: If tongue-tingling spice isn't your thing, halve the cayenne pepper.

Beautiful to behold and delicious. Key is to not overcook the ingredients. I cubed and roasted the butternut squash earlier so that squash was still firm, followed the recipe omitting the squash, and added the squash once the carrots were almost tender. Used whole Italian plum tomatoes that I chopped. Those who don't like it hot should use less cayenne. Raita (even tho not Morrocan) would go really well with this. I added additional salt and oil to the quinoa which otherwise was a bit bland. Great comfort food on a cold and rainy day.

This recipe is wonderful but I had a few issues. I cut the cayenne in half as suggested by others and thought the heat llevel was perfect. I omitted the safron & coriander because I didn't have either. However, I used pre-cut "baby" carrots and found that the squash cooked far faster than the carrots. I eventually took the squash out of the stew altogether in order to give the carrots time to cook. And I still ended up with much of the squash being fairly mushy (though very tasty). So I next time I may parboil the carrots in advance or add them to the pot for five minutes prior to the squash.

Love this dish. It's exotic, beautiful to present, tasty, and easy to make. Consider adding dried fruit - such as raisins, currants, dried apricot. The sweetness really compliments the spicy nature of the dish. Making the stew and quinoa with broth instead of water is definitely a plus.

I loved this recipe. What a perfect blend of spices! I am not really sure why people seem to find peeling butternut squash so dreadful; it took me about five minutes (here is a page that will tell you exactly how to do it: http://www.preparedpantry.com/peelcubesquash.htm). At any rate, the dish was delicious. I added golden raisins to it and also made the yogurt-mint topping for a condiment. Fantastic.

I loved it as is. But the second time I added red peppers along with the onions to the stew and liked the sweetness it brought. I also added frozen corn at the end once and that was good too. You can easily use frozen cubed butternut squash that we get that is organic, and just add it about 15 minutes after you add the carrots. I HATE peeling squash and this makes it a quick easy dish.

Wow. I just made this dish and I absolutely loved it. VERY flavorful. I only had spicy hungarian paprika (not sweet) so I used that instead, and cut the quantity in half (all reviews said this dish was plenty spicy). Delicious. I agree with others that you should not skip the mint. It really seemed like an essential flavor (though I skipped the cilantro). Seems like a shame to make without quinoa, as the fluffy, nutty flavors really worked with the stew. I'm adding this to the permanent rotation...

I tripled the stew and sextupled the quinoa for a big casual dinner. Would have been fine with quintupling the quinoa. Added garbanzos and made peppermint yogurt topping with a tea bag as recommended below--brilliant! No other changes. This stew was a *huge* hit. My only regret was the time I spent beforehand worrying that I'd have a party guest like the woman's boyfriend below who didn't like the dish. I think he must be a very rare bird, since I had compliments from all along the vegetarian-carnivore continuum.

I didn't have enough quinoa for this so I added extra brown rice to fill it out and it was delicious. I didn't drain my tomatoes and I continued cooking the veggies until they were soft but firm.

I've made this twice now and I really like it. This time I added a can of drained chickpeas for protein and upped the cayenne as I love spicy food. The quinoa is sooo good and I really like that the carrots stay a little crunchy and the squash is not mushy at all. I did think of not draining the tomatoes and maybe next time I won't. I didn't have saffron or mint so I omitted and I still really enjoyed it. Definitely a keeper...

This recipe is so impressive it's moved me to write the first recipe review of my life. I was looking for a spin on a stew and this met the criterion beautifully--easy to make. Don't let the ingredient list overwhelm, once these spices are in your kitchen, they'll be used for many moroccan and indian dishes in the future. The dish can also be made without turmeric or saffron just fine. The flavors of this stew are stunning. I've had quinoa before, but never has it actually tasted good until prepared in this manner! This is a dish I would crave, and have already passed it on to friends who have raved about it.

I followed the recipe exactly. I thought it was great. I love butternut squash, quinoa, saffron, and other flavors in this dish. However, my boyfriend couldn't even eat it. He usually eats everything I cook (even the things that don't turn out so well). He had to force himself to even try it as the smell was repulsive to him (not to me!). He said it just tasted spicy, but it had no flavor - everything tasted the same. I did make the stew a day in advance so the flavors would richen. As others said, I would make more quinoa if I ever made this again. But unless I'm hosting vegans (who expect different things from their food), I will not make this again. I've never seen my boyfriend totally unable to eat something even when he's hungry. He has generally broad tastes so there are probably others like him who wouldn't like this.

My family really likes this recipe. However, guests have found it too spicy for their tastes so I tone it down, following some of the suggestions from other reviewers. I've also found that it helps to serve with yogurt on top - especially if you mix in a bit of mint (straight from the tea bag is my trick) and honey.

I've made this dish 3 times now. It's really yummy and a great, novel way to incorporate butternut squash into main dishes. I've omitted different spices, depending on what's in my cabinet, but the real trick is to cook the squash and carrots well enough that they are tender but not squishy. I get the quinoa from Trader Joes and love using it because it is very high in iron.

This is a fabulous cold-weather recipe! I agree with other cooks in that the mint rounds out the flavour of this dish. It's easy to add or subtract spices according to personal taste as well...lots of room for substitutions! I've made this several times and it's always been really yummy.

Very nice ! I laughed when reading the reviews, some of them made so many changes ! ;o) However, I did make a few: following some advice I cut down on peppers and that was a good idea. Too much water is called for in the stew: as the squash tends to "liquify", I waited until the end and the 1/2 cup water I had used was plenty. Also there was too much lemon juice, I'll put less next time (but there'll definitely be a next time). And as others: not enough quinoa for the stew.Great recipe ! Yum yum

Made this for supper tonight to use my butternut and carrots that remain from my CSA shares at the end of the season. WOW! A HUGE hit!The flavors were fabulous - I can hardly wait for leftovers. I did not have any saffron on hand so I skipped it. Hard to imagine how much better the flavor can get!

This is a wonderful recipe, but unless you like your food REALLY spicy, I would recommend cutting back on the cayenne. I used 1/8 teaspoon (instead of 1/2 t) and it was delicious. I would not have wanted it any hotter. I used stock instead of water in the stew and for the quinoa, which added a nice depth of flavor. I also agree with another reviewer who wrote that more quinoa would be better. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Wonderful! The spices are lovely. I recommend using a rather generous pinch of the saffron. I followed the recipe exactly - except that I added about 2 cups of cooked chickpeas, which was very good. I also added about 1/2 cup of raisins, which I liked. Next time, I will add more raisins - maybe more like 1 cup. I served with couscous, as I didn't have quinoa on hand. That worked well, but the stew is also fantastic on its own.

Great, simple fall meal. We ordinarily love spicy food, but I would take down the cayenne to 1/2 or even 1/4 t. It was tolerable for my husband and I, but our daughter struggled with the spicy carrots. I agree you can reduce the fat in the quinoa with little effect, although I would be more inclined to increase the amount of quinoa & save for leftovers -- we had plenty of stew, but no grain left after dinner.

This is just delicious. The mix and amount of spices was just perfect. Instead of cayenne pepper I used about a teaspoon of hot sauce as I didn't have cayenne. I made it without the cilantro and mint as we don't like either. I used a little less the amount of carrots and squash required but I cooked the stew much longer as I prefer softer vegetables. The quinoa was delicious - i've never made it or tasted it before. I would also make more next time. This is definitely a keeper and I will make it again.

This is one recipe that doesn't need any changes or additions...and I'm known to get creative. A side of kale or chard is a good addition if you want greens. Resist temptation and make it exactly as is: one previous reviewer was right-- it really doesn't need any adjusting or substitution, and is very satisfying even for carnivores.

hmmm-- i don't think that adding raisins, green beans, chicken sausage AND scallops AND shrimp would make many people really love any dish! Sorry, this dish is just great. and very simple to prepare as well! Quinoa is loaded with protein and flavor, and a perfect side dish for fall or winter evenings. I'll definiteyl make this dish again.

The stew recipe is amazing (I did not make the quinoa). I didn't have saffron so didn't use any, and just used normal paprika. While I did all the other prep work, I cut the squash in half and put it in the oven to roast. It made it easier to cut when the time came to add it to the recipe. I did not find this recipe to be too much work as others did. 20-25 minutes of prep time, that's all. I highly recommend this recipe.

This dish was good, but like other reviewers, I was not 'wow'ed. I served it for a dinner party, and my guests seemed to like it, but not everyone finished theirs. I thought it was a tad too spicy, and I do like spicy food. I subbed veggie bullion for water (in both stew and quinoa) and added a few handfuls of golden raisins, as well as some green beans for color. I liked these changes and would keep them. I also topped the stew with some sliced chicken sausage for the landlubbers, and some seared scallops and shrimp for the seafood lovers. Next time I would cut the cayenne, but keep the rest of the spices. I do think it needs a little something on top. Maybe some caramelized shallots and tofu would be a nice addition to keep it veggie but feel more exciting.

Delicious, yes, (especially the next day) but exhausting without benefit of Trader Joe's pre-cut butternut squash. I used veg broth in the quinoa and doubled that recipe. Also added more lemon juice to the stew, but thought it was lost in the midst of so many other flavors. Also added swiss chard to stew and chopped prunes to quinoa as suggested by others; both were nice additions. Would I make it again? Nope-way too time consuming for the end result.

Made this at a dinner for some vegetarian friends and it was a huge hit. The only modification I made to the recipe was to use vegetable broth instead of water in both the stew and quinoa. I doubled the recipe and it turned out great. It does take a while to prep (all the chopping) but you can save some time by buying the Trader-joes pre-cut butternut squash. A very hearty and flavor-packed meal for the colder season. I agree with another reviewer that you should double the quinoa to have enough for the stew.

Nice vegetarian meal but nothing extraordinary, at least in my opinion. I followed the recipe exactly, something I rarely do. The next day I decided to blend the leftover stew and serve it as a soup, topped with fresh cilantro and some sour cream...That was better, yummy!

Yummy! I substituted vegitable broth for the water and a variety of small summer squash for the butter nut (with the result being very colorful!) Also added about twice the lemon (love that lemon!, fresh hot red pepper, fresh ginger and used an Ayurvedic spice "Vata Churna" in place of some of the spices I didn't have on the shelf. TUrned out AMAZING! Yum!

This is simply the best quinoa dish I've ever made. The quinoa is richer, nuttier, creamier than rice, and blended with the winter vegetables and herbs, makes a gorgeous dinner party dish. 10 out of 10 guests went back for seconds, even the confirmed carnivores. Don't use couscous or rice, don't substitute spices (increase what's there if you like), really, just don't mess with it. This is one of the few perfect recipes on epicurious.

I did a test run with this dish before serving it at a dinner party. I substituted hot paprika for the cayenne and sweet paprika. I also substituted short-grain (Calrose) rice for the quinoa. In this recipe it gave a slightly more chewy texture than your typical simmered rice . The final dish was excellent. It has a slightly exotic flavor, but isn't so unusual that it turns off finicky eaters. The cilantro and give it that extra bit it needs to go from simply a good stew to a truly flavorful dish. I would also double the quinoa(or rice) to get a 1:1 ratio of stew/quinoa.

AWESOME. The quinoa is an excellent addition-- the texture of quinoa is incomparable: slightly chewy with a little pop. It is an essential part of the recipe and I wouldn't substitute couscous for it in this one. I will decrease the red pepper next time.

I love the flavors of this dish, but I wanted to make it low-carb. I use 5 cups of cauliflower, which goes very nicely with these seasonings, instead of the squash and carrots, and do not include quinoa (which I do love in other dishes). I prefer it a little less spicy, so I do not use the cayenne. It makes a wonderful side dish.

I made this recipe for a sedar when I was searching for vegetarian Passover-friendly main courses and it fit the bill perfectly! I doubled the recipe, left out the saffron and instead of doubling the squash, kept the amount called for and added some crimini mushrooms and swiss chard. It is nicely spiced and has a little kick to it. Yum!

This was truly awesome. The only thing I skipped was the saffron. Quinoa has a nice flavor and cool texture. The stew was flavorful and a nice meld. The overall dish was hearty and satisfying. I did cook the stew about 10 minutes longer to have tender veggies. You really need about 1.5 to 2 of the Quinoa recipe for the amount of stew, but the leftover stew will be good by itself. Definitely give this one a try.

I made this recipe sans saffron, but it was fantastic. If I made this for a crowd, I would probably double the quinoa. I will definitely make this again.

I thought this recepie was wonderful. I got rave reviews from everyone, except my friend who hates spicy food. I actually increased (slightly) the amount of spices because I like spicy food, but that's just my taste. As a vegan, this dish was a breath of fresh air. Highly recommend.

Beautiful to look at and very satisfying. The only change I made was to use red quinoa which has a nuttier flavor then the yellow. Definately a keeper.

Good flavours with the use of coriander, cumin, etc., but wasn't particularly outstanding or interesting. Needed more contrast than just the combination of carrots and butternut squash.

Lovely! Didn't have any mint, but otherwise made it as-is. Took a little longer than I'd thought it would, but the end result was worth it. I'll definitely make this again.

Absolutely delicious. Agree with other reviewer -- tasted even better when reheated. Used a slow cooker (set on high for 3 hours and then low for an additional hour) and threw all ingredients in at once, came out great. Served with asparagus in garlic butter and a spinach/pear/gargonzola salad. Beautiful presentation. Big hit with vegetarians.

Delicious, and quite flavorful. I omitted the saffron, and swapped quinoa for cous cous, but otherwise made it to the instructions. It was very filling, and bursting with flavor. My husband loved it, so it's going in the 'make again' pile!

This dish was fantastic and even better the next day. Simple to make and relatively quick. I did omit the carrots because I ran out but it was still fantastic. I also used half sharp paprika, which likely made it spicier which I like anyway and I trimmed the fat in the quinoa to 1 tsp butter and 2 tsp olive oil. Nicely complex unique blend of flavors, hearty, an excellent winter meal. Will definitely be making again and again.

This was great. I didn't have quinoa, so used couscous, and made it just like it said to make the quinoa. I also didn't have saffron, but there were so many spices going on, that it was hardly noticeable. This is a healthy, delicious dish that I will definitely make again. With the cilantro and mint it's so colorful. Next time I might add diced apricot to give it a little sweet kick.

This dish was flavorful, healthy and simple/fast enough to make on a week night. Outstanding!

I was so happy to find this recipe since it nearly duplicates a favorite dish at a local Mediterranean restaurant. To match it more closely I added a diced red potatoes, a can of garbanzo beans and used cous cous instead of the quinoa. I reduced the red pepper by at least half. It was wonderful; my husband is also a fan, though usually not crazy about vegetarian dishes.

My picky eaters were delighted with this dish. We especially enjoyed the quinoa. I admit I didn't have all the ingredients--substituted cardomon for coriander, omitted cayenne and used sweet potato in place of squash.

Someone wrote they used prunes instead of apricots. I did not see apricots in the recipe. Am I missing something?

Really great, healthy recipe; I'll defintely make this again. I added TVP to give the stew a little texture. This dish is quite spicy, but maybe that's just because I used white instead of black pepper. I think I'll also halve the amount of oil in the quinoa in the future ... it just seemed like more than was necessary. I loved the brightness of the lemon juice contrasted with the sweetness of the squash.

I loved this dish! I made it just as the recipe instructed- which I rarely do, but thought it was perfect. Just be careful to use the correct amount of saffron, as it can be overpowering if you use more

This is a time intensive dish. The flavors are rich and complex and the quinoa is a lighter and healthier alternative to rice. DH and I ate this as a main dish with a salad and a 2001 merlot.

Awesome. I cut back on the red pepper some to control the heat, a good choice as the flavors are delightful. Would make the quinoa without butter next time.

This was really good and quite spicy (a little too much for one of my boys)and the quinoa had a great flavor with the sauteed veggies. I had the leftovers during the week for lunch and it kept getting better.
