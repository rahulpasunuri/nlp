Halved the recipe and served it over not-too-sweet organic vanilla ice cream. Delicious.

Simple and delicious. Follow the recipe as directed--don't omit the lemon zest and juice. It will produce a nice balance of flavors!

This is sooo good! Like another reviewer mentioned I skipped the lemon juice in the end, and didn't miss it at all.

An excellent standard recipe that easily meets a wide range of needs...

Yum! Cut down on sugar. Used strawberries instead of blueberries and fresh mint. Didn't bother with lemon juice. Very good mixed with plain yoghurt to balance sweetness.

This was wonderful. The mind boggles at the adaptations one could make, using different fruits, and perhaps mint or orange instead of the lemon. A big hit.

This is delicious if allowed to chill, for a cold blueberry soup. It's a delicious dessert on its own! I make this "soup" every month or so using frozen blueberries we picked last summer.

Delicious is the word. I didn't have any lemons but substituted orange zest, and a little extra than the recipe called for. Other than that, it was perfect! Nice flavor and texture, will make again. Would likely be fantastic drizzled over your favorite cheesecake!

Substituted 2 cups ripe strawberries and only used 1/4 fine sugar. Served it warm on French Toast. My guests loved it and it was simple to prepare.
