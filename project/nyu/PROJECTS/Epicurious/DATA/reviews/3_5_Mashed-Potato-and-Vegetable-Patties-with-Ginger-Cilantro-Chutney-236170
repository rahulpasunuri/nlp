I agree with the previous review, the patties are bland and really just potato...though I made the recipe with the a spicy mango peach chutney and they balanced each other out well. If you know the key to making the patties a bit more interesting...go for it. Otherwise, a hassle for nothing.

I made this dish thinking it was a great recipe for using leftovers but found the patties rather heavy and devoid of flavor. I changed the chopped chile to chili flakes and used packaged bread crumbs but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. Also for the chutney I was a little confused on the description of how much ginger to use. I used 1 and 1/4" piece of ginger sliced thinly but it was also about an inch thick and it was way too much.

All I can say about the Ginger-cilantro chutney is "WOW!" This was a delicious recipe and I will definitely make it again.

Delicious! Even though they were fried, mashing the potatoes made them incredibly light and fluffy. My carnivorous parents loved them, and my mom doesn't like Indian food. Since I made these on whim, I didn't have all the ingredients on hand and I didn't get to have them with the ginger-cilantro chutney, but with what I did have, I still made a very tasty patty. I will *definitely* be making these again, and will make sure I have everything I need.

I love this recipe! I've made it several times and my guests always rave about it. It's my favorite part of any cook-at-home Indian meal. I serve it with a Hot Mango Chutney instead. Yum!

These were a big hit at a potluck. I cooked them in advance and reheated them in the oven. The one change I made was to add some spinach to them. Next time I'll microwave the potatoes -- 20 minutes of boiling wasn't nearly enough. The chutney is excellent and I'll make that for other dishes, too.

This too was our attempt to make Indian food. The Chutney has a distinctive bite to it and could be used for other dishes as well. Everyone raved about it....I felt quilty, it was so easy to make! Very "fresh" flavors.

This was part of my first ever attempt to make indian food and it worked really well and tasted good! Just follow the recipe! I will definitely make them again!

I made this for an Indian potluck and the patties were quite a hit. I added about 1 tsp garam masala and doubled the hot peppers, and they were delicious. I'd suggest pairing this with a raita as well to complement the flavors.
