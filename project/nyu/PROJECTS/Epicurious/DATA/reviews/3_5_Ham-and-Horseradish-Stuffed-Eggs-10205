Not only do I like more horseradish, but also more lemon juice. I am bring these to every party I attend.

Great way to use up extra holiday ham. I also added extra horseradish.

Yum Yum Yum! Don't use the pastry tip though, the ham clogs it up!

Great twist on deviled eggs.

This recipe was lovely. A nice change of pace from regular deviled eggs.

I liked this recipe, but like everyone else, it need more horseradish. I decided to replace the horseradish with two tablespoons of Wasabi. Now that's a kicker.

Delicious! I also think it needs more horseradish. These were gobbled up at a Labor Day picnic.

yum! Great as-is. If pressed for time it would also be good with whites chopped up - egg salad- on toast points or also as a killer sammie.

I brought these to a baby shower and everyone loved them. I used a high-quality smoked ham and decorated each half-egg with a small sprig of curly parsley. Very pretty and delicious!

I made these just after Easter with some leftover ham and, of course, hardboiled Easter eggs. My husband hated them, saying that the texture was weird with the pieces of ham. I did mince the ham extra fine, but he still didn't like it. I thought they were really good, but I'm not going to make them again because I would be the only one eating them in my house! 5/10/04 I made these again! This time for mothers day--omitted the ham and added more horseradish--rave reviews from everyone! Now it's a "keeper!"

This was a hit at a Superbowl party. I made 40 halves, and they were gone. I added a little more horseradish.

Great for parties, very easy to make, very tasty.

These taste great-they were inhaled at my last party. I think you could up the amount of horseradish. I have added some diced celery for crunchiness but they are good without it.

I will never make deviled eggs without horseradish again. It was delicious. I didn't have any ham, so I made it without - still great.

This recipe is wonderful!! Made it for two different parties over the holidays and it got rave reviews. My family has already requested this again for Easter!

These are delightful and easy to prepare, which is always a plus in my book. They are a step above the typical deviled egg.

I don't care for deviled eggs, but these are absolutely delicious. The ham and horseradish is a winning combination. I made these for a tailgate party, and they disappeared quickly.

Very good. The amount of horseradish can be scaled up.
