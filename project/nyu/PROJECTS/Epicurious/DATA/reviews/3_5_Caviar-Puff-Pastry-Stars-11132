Easy, quick, and probably would impress party guests at first sight, but not complex enough to warrant a repeat, or wasting good caviar, for that matter. The sum isn't greater than its parts.

These were delicious (I used creme fraiche) but the puff pastry only looked good whole. Once you start cutting them, they look ugly so I left them intact and made my guests do the cutting, which was ok but not ideal.

Super easy and no need to use a star shape if you don't have one (we used some juice glasses to make rounds). These are great 1-2 bite snacks and the variations are endless. But I really like the good quality, small egg, black caviar. Check out www.collinscaviar.com for a great variety!

An excellent hors d'oeuvre during the Xmas season - second time I've made it and it was a hit again. Looks impressive and so easy to make.

A very easy versatile 'starter'-- I used some smoked salmon and some salmon caviar with creme fraiche and minced chives! Delicious!!

Easy! & very pretty! I did this with smoked salmon pieces & dill...was a hit! Also, I was able to cut 12 stars out of the puff pastry for a total of 24 hors d'oeuvres.

Perfect appetizer to accompany champagne on New Years! Everyone LOVED IT. I didn't use expensive caviar and no one noticed. You could use a different shaped cookie cutter on the pastry and make it compliment any theme party. Angels=baptism, clover=St.Patty's Day, etc. Will definitely make again!
