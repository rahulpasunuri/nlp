We make this every winter and serve it over goat cheese or baked brie - leaving out the orange.

We love this recipe - we make it as an appetizer with goat cheese and pita chips. The only change I've made is substituting red wine - Pino Grigo, usually, for the white wine. I've made it both ways and prefer it with the red. And the color when it's made with red wine is lovely, too!

This chutney is amazing. Excellent alternative to the cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving and really great on top of cheese & crackers for appetizer. yum!

I followed the recipe exactly, and found it very flavourful, however lacking a bit of the zing that I like in chutneys. However, I would make it again, and would recommend it with pork or duck.

This is marvelous. I added three cardomon pods to the poaching liquid at the beginning, (I recommend this if you have them on hand.) My final product was runnier that I would have liked, so I strained the liquid, returned it to the stove, and reduced it to a honey-like consistancy. I'll go even thicker next time. Rave reviews all around.

Wonderful, wonderful chutney! Easy to make, and a great alternative to boring old cranberry sauce. I left out the dried pears (couldn't find any) but stuck strictly to the recipe for everything else. This would also be good with pork and chicken. Yum squared!

Chutneys are not always our favorite thing. This is DELICIOUS!

I've been making chutney for years and this was probably the most average recipe of all I've tried. The dried fruit was pricey, and the taste wasn't nearly as good as it should have been considering all that went in it. It was quick, I'll say that, but I'd rather take more time and make something really god.

Outstanding. I served this with Herbed Goat Cheese tarts (also from Epicurious) for my Christmas Eve dinner, and it was absolutely delicious.

It was hard to part with the customary gravy served with our Thanksgiving turkey, but with the grilled turkey recipe, this was fantastic!

Everyone loved this recipe. It produced the most delicious aroma in the kitchen when I was making it. People kept walking in, asking what it was that I was making! and when we served it next to the BBQ Maple Glaze turkey-- it was a hit! Another thanksgiving permanent for us!

This is a very quick and delicious dish. I substituted the raisens with dried cranberry raisens. I made this for the first time last Thanksgiving and everyone liked it so much that from now on, this dish will be on our table every Thanksgiving.
