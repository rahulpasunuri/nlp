well I am Bulgarian and Greek and all of the ingredient variants exist though may not be "purist". stuffing for vine leaves, cabbage leaves, peppers and eggplants varies regionally and nobody has the monopoly on it

We have had stuffed vine leaves in my family for years and they are either with rice, meat and spices or with rice, raisins and pine nuts (without meat). I had never heard of a recipe with all the ingredients together.

I have lived in the Middle East for several years. After returning to the USA I searched for a recipe so that I could make them myself. I have never heard of raisins or egg in the Vine leaves. I am so glad that I knew the basics of preparing them as well as the ingredients because if not I would have been very upset after using this recipe. I agree with the cook from Cairo..Lots of Lemon juice and Chicken Stock.

I am Middle Eastern and we do not use pine nuts or raisins in our stuffed vine leaves. We cook the stuffed leaves for about an hour, with uncooked rice, but I think that the suggestion here to cook the rice first may work out well. I recommend using LOTS of lemon juice!

I am Egyptian and this recipe bears absolutley no resemblance to any kind of stuffed vine leaves recipe from Egypt or anywhere in the Middle East. Nobody uses nuts or raisins, the egg is disgusting, and the rice should be flavored with tomato puree, parsley and spices. Also in my family we do not use olive oil, we use butter and chicken broth with lots of lime juice.

I LOVE RAISENS but the kids and hubby don't. when cooking remember 2cups liquid to every one cupof rice. no need the saute, simply place ponted side down to keep closed. then pack in and cover iwth chicken broth and lemonjuice with a pyrex pie pan or an earthen ware plate. in a large dutch oven. cook about 20-30 minutes till rice is tender. your'e the cook you can test it. you can serve cold or warm i prefer either the others like them warm. i like lemon sauce they like plain. i love the garlic yogurt too. i've made hundreds of times that's what you get for being a good grek cook!

As a vegetarian I would omit the meat, the raisins are a bit passe. Try grated zucchini, a blend of rices,assorted herbs, soy grits or buckwheat, or other grated vegetables can be added to the mix. Fill the vine leaves with the RAW rice mix, wrapping neatly, place in ovenproof dish with a few torn leaves on the base, cover with water, leon juice and tomato paste, weight down with a heavy plate, cover the lot with alfoil and bake in low oven for 1-11/2 hrs, checking the water occasionally. Makes neater rolls with less fuss. Does anyone know the recipe for pickling your own vine/grape leaves?
