Yummy. I will definitely make these again because they're very easy and good. I always have these ingredients around the house. Next time I will try substituting oil for the butter and see how they turn out. I didn't have whole cumin seeds, so I just used 1/2 tsp. ground cumin and put it all in the batter.

I've made this recipe a number of times, and have always been pleased. These make a great quick bread to go with the curried sweet potato soup recipe that is on this site. Yummy!

Incredibly delicious! I've made this recipe countless times, and it's always turned out marvelously. Sometimes I omit the spices and make plain popovers.

These were just plain EASY to make, FUN to have on the table, and TASTY to eat. The kids didn't like them, which is fine -- more for the grown-ups! I didn't believe for a second that they would actually puff up, but they did!! Use them as a side dish to a juicy curry recipe -- they're good for sopping up the extra sauce! Enjoy!
