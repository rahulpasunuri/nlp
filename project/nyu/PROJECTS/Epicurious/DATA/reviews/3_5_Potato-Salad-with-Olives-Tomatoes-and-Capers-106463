I made this and topped it with grilled, large shrimp that I had marniated with olive oil, garlic and fresh lemon juice. It was a huge hit - delicious! You may want to add a little extra olive oil and vinegar, but great recipe. A beautiful, tasty meal when served with grilled bread.

This recipe was a hit at my recent Labor Day cookout. Left off the sardines because some would be turned off but when I make it for myself will put back in . This is a keeper!

Very tasty. I would add a bit more tomato next time. There will be a next time. I used fresh oregano because I had it. I added the vinegar and 1 tbsp. of the oil to the sliced onion to mellow the flavor. Yum.

I really like this recipe, and always get rave reviews, even though at first glance the combo doesn't sound great. The key is fresh vegetables that have good flavor. And make sure you don't skimp on salt to bring out the juices!

I have made this several times this past summer and really enjoy it. I agree that garlic helps as well. Guess I'll try the anchovies next time as well.

I'm a big potato salad lover and have made several others of the Italian oil and vinegar variety. This one is just OK, nothing special. I made it as stated and no changes, which is the only way to judge it. As a few others have mentioned, it needs a bit more of an oomph, probably with some garlic, if I do make this particular one again. You can make it like a salad nicoise, by blending in some anchovy paste or use whole anchovies, which would be entirely consistent with a Sicilian dish.

This was so yummy. A fantastic change from creamy potato salads. I'm a vegetarian so I served this as a side dish for family, main dish for me. I added garbanzo beans for a bit more protein. Not so good as leftovers - but there wasn't much left, so not a biggie.

Family fave! Love this! Wouldn't change a thing!

There is a small but important error in the instructions. When making this or any potato salad involving vinegar, it is crucial to add the vinegar first and to do so when the potatoes are still quite warm. The application of vinegar should be followed immediately by salt. (This recipe, like too many others, fails to even venture a guess about how much salt to use, though. I got good results with 3/4 tsp. of sea salt.)

My husband loved it! Took some time for all the chopping, but still an easy recipe and worth every minute.

First I made it to use up some capers I had. Have made it a few times since. It's best in the summer with the really good local tomatoes and cucumbers. Wish mine looked as pretty as the picture!

I really enjoy the different textures and flavors in this potato salad. So different from the mayo-based ones.

With added garlic this is a multi-repeat salad in my home for BBQ's and potlucks. Perfect!

Great for a weeknight supper! I've made this 3 times now; tonight I added pepperoncini; another time, feta. Think the oil-cured olives are a must to give it a great Mediterranean flavor.

Pretty Good. I changed white wine vinegar for a combo of balsamic and red wine. I crushed two cloves of garlic into the vinegar as well. Good advice about not letting the potatos get mushy. Make sure you make this an hour ahead of time so that the flavors sink in a bit, and so the eggs and potatos are room temp.

Not my thing. Would be much better with pasta (minus the eggs). Flavours just don't meld with potatoes very well.

This was a beautiful and delicious salad; I'd definitely encourage anyone to try it (also soooo easy). Use good summer tomatoes and be careful not to overcook the potato. I served this as a first course of a mediterranean summer feast (all recipes from the May 2002 issue of Bon Appetit) and it was a smash hit.

The picture in the magazine looked so good, I couldn't resist trying 'another potato salad'. What a pleasure! Packed full of flavor - I can imagine many things that will go with it. As always, the better the olive oil, the better the flavor!

Very good summer dinner. Made it last night - my friend and my husband both loved it. Next time, though, I will add crushed garlic because, well, I love garlic! Oh, ricotta salata is a nice companion to it, and we had it with a Pinot Noir. Great combination.

This is "I want to thank the academy" good. I prepared it as written,one bite and you are in Italy again. So much better than the usual mayo type potato salad. I couldn't think of a thing that would make it any better. Cudos!!!
