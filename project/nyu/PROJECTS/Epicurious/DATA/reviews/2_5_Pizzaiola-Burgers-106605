This was terrible! It was bitter and bland, two things a burger should never be. Next time try sauteing the chopped garlic with light olive oil, then process it with the basil. Also, for toppings, fresh mozzarella, a nice green, and balsamic vinaigrette marinated tomatoes.

I think this is a great burger. I have made it several times now. The better your ingredients are the better the finished product is, so if you weren't impressed the first time try better meat and cheeses (motz or provalone on top is a must :-) Last time I made the patties too thin and didn't have topper cheese, and it wasn't as good, but I will continue to make this one!

Mixing the meat in the food processor broke down the texture (and in my opinion) the flavor of the meat. If I make them again, I would mix the seasonings and the meat together by head to keep the flavor intacted. Also, cut the sugar, it gives the burger an odd after taste.

After adding the usual burger fixings, mayonnaise, tomatoes, lettuce and onion, I thought that would a delicious change. Wasn't crazy about them before that. They do fine under the broiler too.

This recipe is ok but as far as burgers go, the simplest and tastiest I've had was very simple: i lb ground beef, 1 paket dry italian dressing mix. Mix and grill as desired. tasty and simple.
