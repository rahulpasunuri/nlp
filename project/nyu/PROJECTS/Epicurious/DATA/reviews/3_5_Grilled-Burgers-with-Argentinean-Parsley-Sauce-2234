I made double the sauce and added half to the mixture and it was fantastic!, I also substituted the wine vinegar for Chinese rice vinegar and it was yummy!! Def make again.

We made a mistake while making this burger. We mixed the sauce in the meat mixture and it was great. We never made it correctly after that.

The burger is a standard burger, but the sauce is delicious! I subbed 1-1/2 tablespoons dried parsley. Some of it got on the "Green Beans with Pancetta" I served on the side, and that made the green beans SO delicious!

Really good for a last minute, kinda different burger. I used balsamic instead of red wine vinegar. Nice change.

Although the burger itself isn't exotic, the sauce makes up for it. It's also great if you're looking to avoid the bun. The sauce is a great flavor enhancer!

Not a bad burger, however I punched it up a little with balsamic vinegar instead of the recommended red wine variety. The sauce was even better the next day.
