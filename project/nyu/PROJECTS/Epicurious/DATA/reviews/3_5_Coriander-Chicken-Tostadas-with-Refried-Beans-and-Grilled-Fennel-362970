Great in every aspect. I added guac and that was the only change I made. No need to alter it for great taste.

VERY good and fresh, pretty on the plate and delicious. I used fresh Celantro instead of the dried Oregano and it was great.

Totally agree with kim in MN! Very tasty dish that will become a weeknight go-to favorite. Instead of romaine, though, I used Napa cabbage because I like the crispy texture. I followed Kim's advice and did not use radishes, added shredded cotija cheese, and reduced the oregano in the beans. I substituted black beans for pinto beans because our family likes them better. Powdered coriander works fine instead of seeds.

eh. i thought it would be better. the coriander was kind of weird and the beans even with the amended oregano were kind of bland. i say double the chipotles and the garlic and add some lime juice. the chicken could have been lime too.

This will be my go-to recipe for refried beans. I also reduced the oregano to 2 tsp.

Very good and light. I also rinsed off the beans and used broth for liquid, and I used only one can of beans (effectively doubling the other ingredients in the beans). The beans were superb, and so was the chicken. However, it seemed to be missing something. Maybe a sprinkling of Cotija cheese.

I will definitely make this again. Based on the reviews, I reduced the amount of oregano in the beans - 2 teaspoons. I also used ground corriander because this was the first time I made it for my family and thought the ground spices would go over better with my kids. The combination of the beans, chicken and fennel was great. We didn't use radishes but added some shredded queso enchilada. My 17 year old at 10 tostadas (with fennel and everything) so I think it was a hit.

I made this as soft tacos with warm corn tortillas and served the beans on the side. I couldn't believe how good the beans were for so little work (and yes, I think the 2T oregano must be a typo; I used 2T fresh). Was worried the coriander would be too much but it was really tasty and as other reviewers said, it blended perfectly with all the other unusual flavors. Fresh and delicious--look forward to making again.

WOW.. maybe I did something wrong! I am never disappointed with the recipes on here, especially when I make things with high ratings, but this was WAY over the top with the spices and flavors. Too much.. and I like herbs etc..

Made the recipe without fennel - it was delicious! Refried beans a definite 'must' for the chicken, it completes the taste. Not sure if I would still use dried oregano in the bean mix, as it did not contribute anything authentic to the flavour. Maybe I'll try fresh cilantro instead next time.

Should've read the reviews...the amount of oregano was way too much for the beans. However, the beans still were very good, but would've loved them had it not been for the oregano. Used a cast iron grill pan for the fennel and chicken, and both came out great. Only changes: made these as tacos and added some grilled red bell peppers.

Thought this was great. We added avocados and left off the radishes. We fried our own tortillas instead of buying the pre-made ones. We'll be making this over and over again!

we made ours in corn taco shells and think the flat shells would have broken pretty easily, but we'll try those next time. Very tasty and not hard to make at all. The fennel and coriander make this dish!

I put only a smidge of oregano and added cilantro but other than that followed the recipe. I liked how the flavors complimented eachother. It was fun and different. Sweet and spicey. I think I'd rather just stick with cumin instead of coriander. Wasn't real kid friendly. but it was good.

Only did the beans, but they turned out amazing! I didn't want to make a mess in the kitchen so I just cooked the beans in a pot without mashing. I also added about 1/4 cup fresh cilantro to the recipe and yum yum yum! Put that over brown rice for a quick, tasty, healthy meal.

Just made this tonight and I thought it was very good. My husband liked it more than I did. Made exactly as written except I could not find tostada shells so I got small corn tortillas and toasted them. I agree with the other reviewer that there is WAY too much oregano in the bean recipe, so much so that I truly wonder if it is typo. Next time I will use less and probably add some cilantro.

Really tasty combination, though I wouldn't go heavy on the lime or it overwhelms the gently spicy coriander chicken. A special meal, and so quick and easy. Made it one night because I happened to have every ingredient on hand, and what a pleasant surprise.

Very tasty, but what exactly are tostada shells? I couldn't find them anywhere. Also, the recipe for the fennel should have read "cut vertically through the core." I cut it horizontally -- both cuts are "through the core." It didn't affect the taste, but the slices are not the same.

The description sounded delicious. I had major doubts when it was on the plate. It was delicious. So many great and distinct flavors between the cumin, coriander, chipotle, and fennel, yet no one flavor overpowers/dominates. They remain distinct, not muddled together, yet work together. The cilantro, crisp lettuce and radish clean and cool the palate. We'll make this one again for sure and will probably use the non refried bean mix as a dip for a party.

I enjoyed this quick recipe with the following changes (some from the recommendations from the reviews here): 1 - I used cilantro instead of oregano for the beans - I'd say about 1/3 cup fresh. 2 - I used a bit more olive oil in the pan that cooked the beans instead of using the bean liquid reserve 3 - I used 1/2 a can of chipolte chiles in adobo 4 - I thought I had coriander seeds but I only had ground coriander, still delicious! 5 - I do not have saffron oil, I used olive oil instead. I don't think I noticed a difference! I will be making these beans again, so wonderful!

My family and I loved this recipe. We added a dollap of sour cream and slices of avocado to make it even more delicious. The coriander seed "crust" and the radishes brought it all together.

We made this tonight - it has potential but a couple things just seemed way off. We like bold flavors but the beans were so over Oregano'd (is that a verb?) that we could barely eat it - maybe two Teaspoons of Oregano..... Also it was a bit dry - maybe tostadas are. I did the chicken right (cooked but juicy) and it still really needed something and dousing it with salsa was the easiest cure. Overall: not great.

I rarely cook with coriander, but loved this recipe! I didn't have chipotle chiles in adobo, so I substituted a small can of diced HOT green chiles and added some A1 steak sauce to the bean mixture while in the processor. I know that sounds strange, but the steak sauce added a tang to the beans that I felt was missing since I omitted the adobo. I also used 1 can of pinto beans and 1 can of black, since that's what I had on hand, and it turned out fine. Also, used EVOO instead of safflower oil, soft corn tortillas instead of tostada shells, and grilled the fennel on a grill pan. The coriander coated chicken was delicious, and really made the recipe!! My family loved this, but if you like heat make sure to have some hot sauce on hand.

This is a lot of taste for not a lot of time. In our 2 cook kitchen, we sat down to eat in about 35 mins... Don't skip it because you don't have fennel--there's enough goodness without it. The beans are easy and delicious, an I'm so glad to know about the coriander chicken crust option!

This was very good; I made only minor adjustments (using veggie broth instead of bean liquid, and a bit of palm sugar in the beans to tone down the bitter note from the adobo). We needed more coriander seeds (I bought a good size bag for cheap at the Indian market) - about 1/2 cup total. The recipe was fairly quick, and easy. When I make this again, I think I might make more fennel, and make 8 tostadas (there's enough chicken for eight, at least for my tastes). As a stand-alone dish, my boyfriend and I each ate two tostadas. Overall, the flavors were well-balanced and complemented each other; the coriander was strong, but not overwhelming.
