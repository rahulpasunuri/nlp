Did not have any radicchio, so substituted 1 thinly sliced red pepper. added the seeds of 1 pomegranate - delicious.

I think this salad is so delicious and refreshing, but others have said they find it bitter. For myself, I wouldn't change a thing.

Thought this was a bland dish.

This is a wonderful salad for the Passover seder. Light and refreshing, and it can be prepped in advance. Toss with dressing before serving. I use 1 head of Napa cabbage with a small radicchio and only 1 (large) bunch of parsley.

Great Salad!! Love this salad recipe. It tastes very refreshing with the lemon flavour. Best thing about this salad is that it keeps until the next day and doesn't wilt.

This was much better than I expected and I will definitely make it again. I was asked to make something green, so this is what I choose. Everyone liked it. I do not care for the bitterness of radicchio, but it did not overpower this dish. I chopped the cabbage and radicchio in the food processor and I hand chopped the parsley.

This was a huge hit at the sedder, I'm making all summer long!

This is a fantastic, fresh coleslaw-type salad that I make frequently. I usually use only a little radichio (or substitute carrots) because its bitterness overwhelms the other flavors for me.

Fabulous summer salad. Add blue cheese and you have a near meal!

Good contrast of textures with the spiced lamb in the menu. The vinaigrette was delicious, and the salad was easy and beautiful. My guests are not big salad eaters, so we have lots left over, but 2 days later, the salad is still good, and great with leftover warmed spiced lamb on top!

Delicious, light, a wonderful complement to the heavy passover dishes. I would definetely make it again, any time of the year!
