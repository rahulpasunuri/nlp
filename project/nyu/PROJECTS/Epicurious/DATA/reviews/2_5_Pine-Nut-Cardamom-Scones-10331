After reading some of the other reviews, I decided to dr. up the recipe a little bit. I used 3/4 cup heavy cream instead of the milk, and a full stick of butter... obviously not a particularly light recipe, but I didn't want dry scones. I also increased the sugar content by a couple tablespoons, then drizzled a brown sugar/cinnamon combo on top. The dough is sticky, but still manageable if you flour your hands. They came out lovely. The only other thing I would suggest is if you're not crazy about cardamom, increase the amount of cinnamon to balance it out.

I agree with several others that these scones are not overly sweet. Also, that they are very dry. Not sure how to remedy that... because I do like the cardamon/pine nut combination

Love the pine nut / cardamom combination, but the scones aren't moist or sweet enough for me. I'd either up the butter and sugar or just go with my usual scone recipe, adding these two great ingredients.

I ground the cardamom seeds instead of using pre-ground, and 2tsp was maybe a bit too much. Went very nicely with lemon curd. Co-workers raved and scones were gone within moments!

Wonderful if you like cardamom (and I love it). I used buttermilk but otherwise followed the recipe. Big hit - I had to make another batch because they were all gone (hungry friends with great taste)! I'll make them again.

These scones were the first that I did not enjoy from gourmet. The cardamon was overwhelming and you had to slather with butter and jam for moistness and sweetness were missing within the scones. 2 Forks for being nice to dunk in tea plain, but on their own, try something else.
