Some loved it and some sure didn't. I love beets so took a chance. I served it as a first course. Mine was like pureed beets - very thick. It wasn't hard to make - but did take time and mess. Also, I needed 6 fennel bulbs - those can be costly. Overall, although it was good, I didn't think it was worth the effort/expense/time.

Used grand marnier instead of the OJ and Gilka-- was very well received at a dinner party

I've been making this soup since it appeared in Gourmet in 1994. I have substituted other liquors or left out the Gilka altogether with no problems. I'm not a big fan of fennel, but it is perfect in this soup. Everyone loves this soup, even people who think they don't like beets!

Probably easier to find is a caraway liqueur called aquavit from Scandanavia

Great, easy to prepare soup. Wonderful beet color. Very nice with the rye bread. Good luck with the Gilka?!
