Interesting was to put sweet potatoes on the Thanksgiving table without another heavy "starch". Flavor and texture good. Cherries were tough to keep in the dough. Did not care for them leftover so would question the feasibility of making ahead

Rating a recipe that has been changed beyond recognition is neither relevant or fair. I've been making this recipe since it first appeared in the magazine. Not only are these rolls tender and delicious with only a touch of sweetness, everyone who has ever eaten them requests the recipe. The cherries paired with the cardamom and sweet potato base are positively scrumptious.

I thought these were only OK, but all my guests raved. I skimped on the kneading and they still came out fine, I ended up adding almost 4 cups flour and I think that made them too heavy.

These are wonderful! I love the texture. I was looking for something more savory, so I used only 2 1/2 tbsp sugar, left out the fruit, and replaced the cardamom with rosemary. They smell fantastic. They were a little more sour than I was expecting, but I love that in yeast bread, and I served this to six other people of 3 generations and everyone thought they were fantastic. With these modifications, they were delicious with a sausage and tomato fritatta. I also let them rise overnight before forming into rolls and that worked fine.

We really enjoyed these and will make again. The sweet potato imparted a tender crumb and pale golden color. My only changes were using golden raisins and sprinkling them with coarse sugar before baking. I served them for breakfast and they were not too sweet -good alone or with jam.

I've made these rolls for Thanksgiving and sometimes Christmas every year since 1994. They perfectly compliment other autumn and winter flavors. I've made the mistake making just one batch instead of two! There are never any left over and are a favorite with the kids and the adults at my holiday table.

I also agree that 1 tsp salt is plenty. I did like the dough sticky and I used maybe 3 1/2 cups of flour. It is also important to use a kitch aid, or other product, because it blends well and kneads well. These went great with a cold fruit and bell pepper soup........

Made these once and plan to make them again. As for other comments: yes, there are often mistakes, but not significant ones. This recipe went just about the way it reads, except for the excess salt. Who said anything about chopping the cherries? They are whole, and work fine that way. We thought these rolls were very tasty. Just another commment: the Epicurious food dictionary (and other sources) say yams and sweet potatoes are NOT the same, yet this recipe says sweet potato (yam) as if they are interchangeable!

This recipe is good but needs some help. First, use 1 tsp of salt (both 1 and 2 tsp are called for). Next, I used just over 4 C flour, not 3 1/4, and recipe possibly could have used more. For those unaccustomed to sweet potato breads, the recipes are always relatively sticky even when done. No mention was made of this. Also, agree with other poster, cherries do not work well here; I would use golden raisens next time. Finally, the cooking time is botched up as is process for determining if done. Pick up an undone roll and tap the bottom? Come on folks. And check halfway through at 15 mintues? They were nearly DONE in TWELVE minutes. I am finding an increasing number of Epicurious recipes that are OK for ingredients, but are written as if by third-grade students. Beware. Other than that, this recipe is tasty....if you don't blow it because of how it's written.

These were quite yummy, a big hit with all my boys. I used 1 teaspoon of salt instead of 2 and I used raisins instead of dried cherries.

I have been making this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner since it first appeared in Bon Appetit back in November '94. My family and friends love it! I have on occasion replaced the dried cherries with dried cranberries. PLEASE NOTE THERE IS A TYPO--ONLY USE TWO TEASPOONS OD SALT; that's how it is written in the magazine! Lastly if you have a bread machine let it do some of the work for you. Go through the dough cycle, remove and form rolls.

These rolls were a hit! They would go well with a Thanksgiving turkey. I only used 1 tsp. salt, however, and it tasted fine.

This roll recipe is not good. The flavors just don't blend well and they are unattractive (chopped dried cherries aren't pretty in rolls!)

Is there a mistake on this recipe? Salt is listed twice, after the butter. Two teaspoons seems like alot for rolls, but three!
