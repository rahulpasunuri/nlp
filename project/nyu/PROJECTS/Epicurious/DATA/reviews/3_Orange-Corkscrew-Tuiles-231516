This recipe was easy to follow and made beautiful spiral cookies. I used essence of orange in place of vanilla and they had a wonderful orange flavor. They were not as crisp as they might have been, having a slightly chewy texture. I served chocolate mousse, topped with fresh whipped cream, finely grated orange zest, and the orange tuile stuck into the cream. Beautiful presentation!
