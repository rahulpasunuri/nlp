to answer a previous cook's question, hulled barley takes twice as long to cook but nutritionists say has more food value than pearled. I followed the suggestions of thyme and bay leaf and more dried mushrooms. I also used mushroom broth from Pacific Natural Foods. Smells delicious but haven't tasted it yet. Molly Katzen adds soy as part of the salt which I may do.

Everytime I make this recipe it meets with great reviews. Just a note, I've made it with everyday fresh mushrooms and chixken stock instead of beef. When the author referred to the 2nd avenue deli I checked out my cookbook from the same and they used chicken broth. Hearty and full flavored.

I have made this soup before and everyone loves it. I do doctor it a little. I simmer stewing beef until tender and use that as the stock liquid. I always add more dried mushrooms. I like the Stir Fry mix which offers a variety of flavors and textures.

ok, I finished making this and my soup came out to deserve give a single fork score. What I ended up with was flavorless and watery. I know i didn't have the correct ingredients (substituted cremini mushrooms for porcinis and could not find dried of either), but other chefs that have offered reviews substituted different mushrooms and had success. I even added the bay leaf one cook recommended as well as a splash of sherry, and salt and pepper but ended up with bland and watery. And please explain these instructions to me: do you soak the dried mushrooms or the fresh ones? If you soak the dried ones, then why is the second instruction to "chop the dried mushrooms"? How much water does one reserve after soaking the mushrooms? I had a quart - I decided to save two cups thinking that I would use that to cook one cup of barley. Perhaps that's why the whole recipe ended up watered down. One cook recommended sauteeing the vegetables in the soup pot and then just pouring the stock into the same pot. Excellent idea!! otherwise you will end up using about 6 pots, pans and prep bowls. Why add the mushroom mixture out of one pot into another one cup at a time? makes no sense. anyway - I hate to be a downer, but this was a pain to make, and tasteless to boot. in fact, it tasted like a boot.

Actually this is not a review but a question before I even start (I'm giving the soup 4 forks so I don't throw off its score)!! Is "whole barley" different from "Pearled barley" (which I have in my cabinet and wonder if I can just exchange in this recipe)?

This is an excellent soup, very hearty and tasty. I also add a potato and even some leftover lamb if available to make it even more special. If the soup is too thick for you, leave out the flour.

This is am excellent soup but not the very best mushroom barley soup. My favorite is from the Soups volume of the Time-Life The Good Cook series. But, sigh, now I am a vegetarian and that recipe calls for a broth of meat and chicken bones and so I have been on the hunt for a vegetarian mushroom barley soup, which you wouldn't think would be so hard! This one is very good. I have the cookbook that this comes from (Jewish Cooking in America) and have made many of the recipes, most of which are annoying because they leave out either ingredients or steps or have other unconscionable mistakes in them. So, this recipe's lapses are not a surprise. I followed other reviewers suggestions, doubling the dried mushrooms, carrots, and celery, added bay leaves, thyme branches, and LOTS of fresh ground pepper. I also deglazed the pan (after the flour step) with some white wine and the liquid from the soaked mushrooms. I found that I needed to saute the veggies in a 6 qt. saute pan so that they didn't steam and then transfer the whole to the stock pot with the vegetable broth. A little bit of a pain -- my kitchen is a mess. I thought, though, that I would take this opportunity to thank all of you for your helpful suggestions. I have come to rely on the insights of this community of cooks and as a result, nearly everything I make has been tested and improved before I even start. So, of course, I am a good cook! Thanks for all your contributions.

I love mushrooms! I followed some of the reviewers' additions (bay and thyme and only 1/2 cup barley) and even though I used what I had, dried shiitakes (2 tbs? I used 2 cups.), fresh creminis and it is excellent. I used leeks, shallot and onion and the other ingredients except I used my homemade turkey broth. I couldn't wait to eat it so the barley is a little al dente, but when it's done it will go in the fridge over night and be better tomorrow. Oh, and I soaked the mushrooms over night, used all the liquid I could squeeze out of them in the soup and chopped up half to put in with the veggies. I will make this again and again, trying different mushrooms each time. THANKS ALL!!!!

This is the best mushroom barley soup I have ever made. I did not have dried mushroom so I had to skip them and just used fresh but even without them it is delicious. I made one other adjustment, I added more carrots.

Rating: 4
This soup was better than perfection. Best ever! My modifications were taken from various other reviewers: I doubled the dried porcini mushrooms and water at the start, doubled the celery and carrots, used sliced white mushrooms with the vegetables, used some cognac to deglaze my stock pot after removing the veggies to make way for the broth and barley step (I used just one pot for the recipe), for my broth I used 4 cups of water and one Tbsp of Penzey's vegetable soup base and one Tbsp of Penzey's beef soup base (Penzeys.com), added a bay leaf to the broth and barley (bay leaf was of course Penzey's), then I added leftover LEG OF LAMB. I let it simmer for a few hours and refrigerated overnight. The next evening, the soup had thickened up to a splendid consistency. While I am sure the soup would have been wonderful without it, the addition of the lamb was "crazy good" and I think beef would be terrific here as well. Off the charts good. A definite keeper.

This recipe is a good start. The vegetable roux is a genius technique, and the dried mushrooms and liquid add deep mushroom flavor. But, without some modifications, I also found the soup is bland. I needed to add a splash of white wine, a few dashes of soy sauce (my soup secret - adds depth and richness), a bay leaf, more carrots and celery, and some diced rutabaga to turn this into a four-fork soup.

Rating: 3
This soup was wonderful! I used a mixture of beef and chicken stock and added 1/4 c sherry at the end per another review and it made a big difference! I also used 1/3 c dried porcini mushrooms and added with barley. Also doubled the carrots and celery and would add even more next time. I will definitely make it again!!

Rating: 3
I doubled the carrots & celery. Soaked twice as many dried porcini mushrooms in boiling water for an hour. This gave me close to two cups of mushroom juice. Added a bay leaf, some dried thyme & sherry. The flavor was full but I still want more. Next time I make it I'm going to add a variety of mushrooms.

This is great. Love the veg-roux method. I added a small bunch of fresh thyme while sauteing veg. And I deglazed the pan with a little sherry which enhanced the earthiness of this soup. To serve, toast a thick slice of crusty bread. Place it in bowl and pour soup on top. Wonderful!

Agree about the instructions, they are too vague. You're supposed to soak the dried mushrooms and after you chop them, add them in with rest of veggies. Only change I would make is using veggie broth instead of beef- I think I personally would prefer it. Needs pepper and added a bay leaf (thanks for suggestions!) Also added in lima beans to make this a hearty lunch. I think the soup was good- nothing to rave about though.

QUESTION: The recipe never states what to do with the coarsely chopped dried mushrooms --- do you just add them in??? A lot of recipes will have you discard the dried mushrooms because they are tough. THOUGHTS on this?

Loved it! Took other reviewers suggestions and added stewing beef to make it more of a main dish soup. I purchased pre-cut stew meat at the supermarket and cut it into even smaller pieces. The beef requires a longer simmering time. You want to make sure it's not stringy or chewy. Will definitely make again & I've already shared the recipe.

I also love this soup. I tend to have portobello mushrooms around so I substitute about 1/2 of a pound of these. I also add about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of cream and some brandy (sometimes Conjac)...its delicious. NLIEDEL, here is a recipe a friend of mine gave me for their brownies....you will have to let me know if they are as good as the ones at Zingermans.... Zingerman's Brownies from Midwest Living 13 T butter 6.5 oz unsweetened chocolate 1.5 C cake or all purpose flour 3/4 t baking powder 1/2 t salt 4 eggs 2 C sugar 1.25 t vanilla 1 C coarse chopped walnuts, toasted 1.

In a small bowl sift together flour, baking powder and salt. 4. In a large mixing bowl, beat eggs and sugar with an electric mixer on high speed for 5 minutes or till light yellow and fluffy, scraping side of the bowl occasionally. 5. Add cooled chocolate mixture and vanilla. Beat on low speed until combined. Add flour mixture; beat on low speed until combined, scraping sides of bowl. Stir in walnuts. 6. Spread batter in pan. Bake 30 minutes or until brownies appear set. Cool in pan on wire rack; cut into bars.

This was great although I tweaked it a little. Browned 2 lb of eye round prior to adding beef stock and beef broth. I didn't use fresh mushroom but did have some dried porcini on hand which did add some depth to the broth. Added the beef back in to simmer with the barley. The end result was a delicious soup that my father couldn't get enough of and my husbamd raved about.

I made this, with a few modifications, and it was very good. I used beef soup base with water, fresh crimini and button mushrooms, a mix of barley, brown rice and other whole grains, and finished it with just a touch of cream and brandy. Several people commented on the wonderful smell when I heated up at work for lunch today. A nice change from my usual "heavier" mushroom soup with more cream and sherry, and healthier, too.

This is a fantastic soup. The directions aren't specific enough, just follow what the other readers recommend. I use a 0.5 oz packet of dried mushrooms that i boil in water for about 10 min. In the meantime, saute the veggies. I use all the water from the reconstituted mushrooms, and add enough broth to make 2 quarts of soup. Add the barley and simmer for 1 hour. It's a hit with all of my friends and family!

I made this with some modifications and it was really good! I started by browning about 1lb of beef stew meat cut into 1in cubes, set it aside and added it to the mixture just before it was time to simmer. I also doubled carrots and celery as I like some color in my soup. I used dried shiitake mushrooms instead of porcini and a few fresh bay leaves. Veggie stock and the water the mushrooms soak in add a lot of flavor. I let it simmer for 1-2 hours. By the time I served it, the soup was thick and delicious!

This is one of my absolute favorite soups! Use the stock, not just water for a very full flavor. I like to add a bay leaf in while the barley is cooking as well. I don't understand why so many people say that the recipie is difficult to follow.....it couldn't be easier. Enjoy! This ones a keeper!!!

Zingerman's is a local institution, and rightly so. Still, I detest going downtown too often, wanting to cut it to once a month, if I can. This recipe is spot on and delicious, allowing me a bit of a fix, without the crowds. Thank you. Now, if you will kindly post the recipe for their brownies...

I love making homemade soups, and this recipe is a great one. I also only used 1/2 cup of barley. My grocery didn't have dried porcini, so I used a 1 ounce packet of dried oyster mushrooms instead, and used fresh portabella and shitaki as well. I also made it vegetarian by only adding veggie boullion instead of beef broth. The recipe is a little hard to understand, but I read the other reviews to help me along.

Like everyone else says, the directions are absolutely awful. But the results are fantastic. I coursely chopped all the veggies because I like them still firm. I used dried Chantelle mushrooms (I was out of Porcini) and added them at the same time as all the other vegetables since it wasn't clear what to do with them in the directions. For the fresh mushrooms I used oyster, shiitake, and enoki mushrooms. It gave the soup a great variety in texture and flavor. Also, I used olive oil instead of margarine.

Rating: 4
I can't imagine getting through fall or winter without making this soup at least once - usually lots more. If you aren't kosher it's perfectly fine to substitute butter for margarine. The margarine is only to separate dairy from meat to comply with kosher laws. And butter will make a richer soup. I coarsely chop all the mushrooms and finely chop the onion. Also I soak the dried mushrooms in 2 cups of hot water and strain it through a fine mesh strainer and add it all for a stronger mushroom flavor. I'll use whatever fresh mushrooms I can find, but usually like a mixture of wild mushrooms and baby bella for a deeper flavor. Plain white button mushrooms would be boring. Also I don't see any reason to dirty two pots. I just saute the vegetables in the soup pot first and then add the broth, mushroom water, and barley.

Rating: 3
I am a New Yorker and thought this was really very good. I agree the recipe was a bit unclear as written. As with other reviewers I felt that the dried Porchinis are an essential part of the recipe. Do not scrimp on them. I chopped them in a food processor after soaking and sauteed them along with the rest. Don't skip the vegetable roux step. It really improves the flavor and texture of the soup. I used olive oil to saute the vegetables and 1 quart each of mushroom broth and vegetable broth due to my basically vegetarian lifestyle.The results were excellent.

Rating: 3
This is so delicious. I agree that there is a LOT of barley, and since the broth is so delicious, I may cut the barley down to 1/2 or 2/3 cup next time. Instead of 2 T of porcini, I used a full 3/4 oz package, which added the perfect amount of wild mushroom flavor.

I can't believe so many people liked this recipe! I thought there was way too much barley in it. It was like barley soup - it tasted vaguely of mushrooms, but mostly of barley. I love barley in soup, but as a thickener, not as the main ingredient! This soup has seriously ruined my night.

Zingerman's would NEVER use margarine. Not if it was the last fat on earth. Don't bother with this if you've had a bowl of the real stuff at the deli.

As suggested by other reviews, I added 1/4 cup sherry and a splash of red wine at the end. I also added a splash of soy sauce. I used 3 types of fresh mushrooms - white, portobello, & cremini in addition to the dried porcini. I added the flour after the mushrooms softened and it mixed in nicely. Since the shape of the mushrooms seems discretionary from the recipe I finely chopped half in the processor and roughly sliced/chopped the other half. Came out terrific with a nice texture. I also used at least 1/2 pound more mushrooms than required. Will definitely make again - great on a dreary day.

To the cook from Southfield, MI: Do you know the definition of "succinct"? You need to. Look it up on websters.com, and give it a try. It's just soup, after all, not your college thesis.

To the reviewer with the "Bambi rule" - the purpose of reviews is to share our opinions so that we can learn how to improve the recipe. That said, the use of margarine is atrocious in any soup but it really ruins the delicate taste of certain mushrooms. I would use a very light olive oil. Also, the more variety you use in selecting mushrooms, the more interesting the soup! There are much better recipes out there.

Rating: 3
This has become a staple in my house in the winter, or anytime fancy mushrooms are on sale. With a loaf a crusty bread you have a fabulous meal, and it tastes even better the next day. The recipe is poorly written, but it's not too hard to figure out. Chop all the mushrooms coarsely, add the reconstituted porcini with the other mushrooms. You may have to add more beef broth as it cooks if the barley absorbs it all, but I personally like it rather thick.

Rating: 3
Atrociously written recipe, but not so incomprehensible that anyone with common sense wouldn't be able to figure it out. That said, this soup is WONDERFUL! Never having made mushroom barley soup before, I was a little nervous, especially since I could only find the dried porcini mushrooms and nothing more interesting for the fresh than button. I added about four times as much butter as called for to saute' the vegetables, since 2 tablespoons would never have worked, but otherwise pretty much followed the recipe. Next time I'll add the sherry or white wine suggested by others, and more beef broth, since mine was nearly all absorbed by the barley. But my husband asked me to marry him all over again, and ate three huge bowls of this stuff. Definitely a keeper!

I made this for a group of 6 and everyone loved it!. I used swiss brown mushrooms and the fresh ones, and added a splash of sherry and a splash of white wine (as suggested by one of the earlier reviewers - thanks cook from Fremont). And best of all - there's nothing hard about it! Yum.

The soup was great. I recommend it.....I'm not a master chef, but was able to figure out how to simplify the recipe. After reading unnecessarily negative comments so many times on this site lately, I'd like to remind the angry people about the "Bambi rule": "If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all." Or at least suggest improvements without sounding angry. It's just food. There are plenty of real problems in the world to be angry about.

First of all, this isn't Zingermans' soup; it's Joan Nathan's soup and unless Zingermans has made the necessary amount of changes that allows them to give it their name, they need to call it Joan Nathan's soup served at Zingermans...or at least say adapted from Joan Nathan. Or maybe it is Zingermans' soup and they gave Joan Nathan permission to use it in her book. In the credit after the recipe, you cite Joan Nathan and the the title of her book, so maybe this was never in one of the magazines usually represented on this web site. I wasn't aware the recipes from cookbooks were presented here. Much too complicated for me. Regardless, this is one of the poorest written recipes I've ever seen and whether it's Zingermans' or Joan Nathan's, whoever is responsible should be ashamed of theirself. Now as to the recipe. The reason Joan uses margarine to saute the veggies is probably because she writes a kosher cookbook, but no cook who knows anything, would saute in margarine versus butter or olive oil. Next, the onions should be chopped and the mushroom sliced. Who wants big slices of onions and whole mushrooms in a soup? Adding more carrots and putting them in with the barley is nice. Doing it at the beginning, destroys them, They're overcooked by the time the soup is done. I would only put them in with the onions and celery if they were chopped. I don't understand the flour and heating the broth. It's suppose to be a soup, not a roux and when making a roux, the flour only has to be cooked for two minutes, not five to get rid of the raw taste. A better alternative and easier way would be to mix a little butter and flour and add it prior to adding the barley and carrots. Who ever heard of using two pans to make a soup? How can the onions, celery and garlic saute when you put them in with the mushrooms? They're stewing in the mushroom liquid. All things considered, the soup was decent, but any novice cook would have a hard time with this recipe.

The recipe is poorly written in that it doesn't have very good directions, but the soup is delicious!! And easy to make! Slice the onions thin and then roughly chop them so you don't end up with long strings in the soup. Coarsely chop the mushrooms.

Big hit with the hubby, who considers himself a soup expert!

Some sour-dough olive bread and a bit of cheese and a wonderful dinner for a cold, gray night. Now, time to light a fire.
