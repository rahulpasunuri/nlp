I made this wonderful recipe when it came out in June 1003 and I was surprised to see it in the "Buzz Box" which I check out semi-regularly. Nina's review was posted 19 times! Epicurious - why does this keep happening? It completely skews the results and thus the purpose of this interesting part of the sight.

Tastes great! I too had difficulty getting it hot enough, because I could not find the peppers I needed (used 7 Serranos for double the recipe, and def not enough bite!) I also decided at the last minute to sprinkle some brown sugar on the skin side, which gave it the sweetness of the jerk recipes I have loved. That did make for a lot of charred carbon to clean off my pan though (did it in the oven). Would make it again with some heat adjustments.

my first jerk chicken ever and it turn out beautifully. Easy recipe to follow and what a nice taste. Didn't get Scotch bonnet r habanero chiles so used what's available in this part of the world - small green chiles from India (used 6!) and it was just enough heat. Thank you. This made my hubby's Bday extra special. Will definitely make it again at our next BBQ party.

This was a fantastic recipe! I used boneless, skinless breasts and let it marinate about 5 hours. Had fresh jalapenos from the garden, so I used them (but would definitely add a bonnet or habanero next time for a little extra heat!)instead. Also added a handful of fresh spinach and a grab of fresh parsley as well; skipped the shallots since I didn't have any and added some extra garlic and scallions instead. As you may be able to tell, I use recipes as a "guide" but I followed the directions pretty exactly for measuring the spices and also added some red pepper flakes and ground white pepper. My husband demanded that this be added to the regular rotation!!

I've made this recipe for years and it's always enjoyed by all! Marinate overnight and use gloves when cutting the chili peppers -- or you'll risk tingly fingers for days. Best on the BBQ but the oven is good as well.

I can't comment about the authenticity of the dish, but I thought it was quite tasty. I made a small batch (two leg quarters) and scaled the recipe to approx 1/3. There was some extra sauce, but not a ton. In the future I will add more peppers as I thought the spice was *very* mild (child friendly in fact!). I marinated the chicken for a day and grilled it over charcoal with a mix of apple and mesquite wood chips to add smokey flavor. I made jamaican rice and peas (using canned coconut milk and black beans) and grilled sweet corn to go with the chicken. Overall it was a really tasty meal and something different. Will definitely make again!

This recipe is absolutely delicious. I made a small portion tonight for dinner just to test it out. I will definitely make it tomorrow night with all the fixings for a delicious family dinner. I loved it. Only thing I changed is jalepenos instead of habeneros (only because the store was out of habeneros) and wings instead of legs. Delicious!!!

This is one of the best jerk recipes I've ever tasted. Just a tad too much ginger for me, but that's a personal taste thing. I loved it.

This was a delicious Jerk. In deference to a relative who can't tolerate the heat like I can, I reduced the Scotch Bonnets. Just as well as it ended up plenty hot for me. I prefer skinless chicken breast to thigh meat or breast with skin. I was worried that the meat would dry out on the grill but it came out fine.

I was really excited to make "real" jerk chicken (I usually just use a rub from Penzey's spices), but this was really disappointing. I've had it at roadside stands in Jamaica, and this wasn't even close! I followed the recipe exactly, except that I added two coins of fresh ginger to the food processor (because it's a common ingredient in other recipes). I marinated a half chicken for two days and cooked it for 20 minutes in a smoker bag on the grill to approximate the wood-grilled flavor of the real thing, then finished over direct heat to get it brown and crispy. It looked right, and the smoke flavor was good, but it wasn't even spicy! Maybe it would have helped to leave the the seeds in two of the peppers (I used four habaneros). A tip: since this is all going in the processor, there's no need to chop the chiles first - I just carefully cut the stems and top off, and while holding the pepper from the bottom (no exposed flesh) used a small paring knife to cut out seeds and ribs (similar to cutting the core out of a tomato), and threw the chiles in the processor with the other ingredients. One might want to wear gloves anyway, but using this method, you don't have to touch the chile flesh or seeds with your hands. Anyway, I thought this recipe was pretty boring and not worth the time investment - next time I'll just use the rub.

This is an exceptional recipe! I did however use jalepenos the first time. I will use a combination next time for a bit more kick.

I have spent a lot of time in Jamica and have had the most mouth-watering jerk at the roadside stands there! This is the closest thing I have found to the authentic flavor. Serve with rice and peas and collards (couldn't find the callaloo)! Toppa toppa mon! I would suggest marinating overnight for best flavor and getting the juicy inside/crisp outside when grilling. Grill very slowly. No hurry no worry mon!

This was just so-so. I usually love jerk flavor because of the combination of spicy and sweet. This is completely missing the sweetness. I've tried this twice and it just doesn't do it for me. I'm trying a different recipe next time.

I have made this recipe about 3 times now and I just love this recipe with the papaya salsa which was it's featured accompaniment. It's just a fabulous combination. The reason I like it is I do everything the day before and let it marinate overnight and the next day, you just have to grill it on the barbecue. The only tip that I have for other cooks who have never used scotch bonnet peppers is that they are so hot that while slicing these peppers, when the any juice or seeds of these peppers happened to land on my hands. They burned for hours afterwards. So be careful. Use a thick plastic bag for marinating for this reason as well.

Used this recipe for a catering job I had a few months ago; it was a big hit. Because of the diversity of the crowd, I did not add peppers, but it was well-received anyway. I cooked it over direct heat using chicken legs and thighs (cut apart)since they cook fairly quick anyway. There's a Jamaican restaurant near my house, and their recipe doesn't even come close. Thanks!

I love jerk chicken but this version I found to be too heavy on the lime flavor. I used fresh lime juice and marinated it for 6 hours. I followed this recipe precisely except I used jalapeno pepper. It was OK, just not great. I served it with red rice and fresh mango on the side. I wish I could find the other jerk recipe I used to use. I think it had soy sauce (!) in it.

This is some of the best jerk chicken I've ever made. It's on par with my Jamaican friend's recipe which, though unworldly spicey was so good that I sweat through it! Lots of flavor whether you go for nuclear spicey or not. Makes for great BBQ kabobs.

This was good, but not great. I've had better jerk chicken recipes.

This is an authentic recipe. My first exposure to Jamaican jerk chicken was at a dive called "da bus" in Negril. It's call "da bus" because the jerk stand is just behind an abandoned bus in the lot in front. Anyways, if you want the real deal, you have to use the hot chiles and be sure to marinate a minimum of 2 hours. Have some Red Stripe on hand and a friend named "Crispers."

I made this with an extra haberano, it was SPICY, but very tasty. Everyone I made it for loved it!!

Great taste and not too spicy as we used jalepeno because I couldn't find the others. I served this with grilled pineapple and peaches - perfect for outdoor dining.

I went to Jamaica and tasted authentic Jerk. I altered the recipe a bit with a little tomato sauce and pureed the ingredients to make additional dipping sauce. It was extremely close to the real thing. Excellent taste and brought back great memories. Awesome .. a must try !!

Have tried a few recipes for jerk chicken and this is a fantastic recipe. I have marinated the chicken for as little as 6 hours and had great results. Very flavorful and easy. I also remove the skin from my chicken prior to marinating. I start my grill out on high, just to create the grill lines and then turn the grill to low for an amazingly juicy chicken.

I thought this was good. I only used two habaneros because I knew the kids and one of my guests don't like the kick, but next time I'll def use more. Fantastic :)

WOW!! This was so good! I didn't have habaneros, so I used a large canned chipotle pepper. Very tasty.

I have made this recipe 2 times. The first time the grocery store didn't have Habanero Chiles, so I just used some other kind. I made it for the 2nd time last night & this time I was able to get habaneros. I made the serious mistake of touching my eye after chopping/seeding the habaneros & I almost ended up going to the local E.R.! Habaneros are VERY hot! After about 45 minutes of eye washing, etc., I went back to the Marinade & took 1/2 of the habaneros out. Cooked the chicken tonite & it was still too hot! I have since learned that one should always wear gloves when slicing peppers like these. My eyes are now fine, but my hands are still burning! Should have this warning with the recipe!

First time making jerk chicken. Cut boneless, skinless breasts into chunks and marinated for 6 hours, then skewered with mango, pepper, and cherry tomatoes. Had to broil (no grill), but it came out great. My husband had to take a break in the middle b/c it was too spicy for him, but I think most of the spice actually came from the black beans mixed with the pickled onions (and habanero) also on this site. I'll definitely play with this marinade again, especially when we get to use our new grill!
