We made this for our holiday party this year with great success. The preparation can be tedious and time consuming but the results are worth it. Using a good quality loaf is definitely key, and the larger cube size (2x2 inch) suggested by the previous reviewer is a good idea. Makes the stuffing process easier. We prepared them the night before and then heated them in the oven for the party. Turned out perfect and tasty.

Yuk! Too much butter, looked ugly, not attractive at all. Tried these out before a big party, and didn't make them - really yucky.

Husband and I made these for a New Years Day celebration and *everyone* was delighted by them. After a practice batch 1x1 inch, we made ours more like 2 inches wide by 1 inch depth, so we could stuff lots of cheese in. Yum!
