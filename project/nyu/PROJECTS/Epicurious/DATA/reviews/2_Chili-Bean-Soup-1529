I think the previous reviewer may have mistaken chili powder for chili flakes or cayenne. I used chili powder (found in the spice aisle, used to make...well, chili). I always make a recipe as is the first time I make it, then adjust seasoning. Made as is, it tasted full of promise, but needed the additional adds: 2 boullion cubes, 1 tsp oregano, 2 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp onion powder, and a pinch more cayenne (just enough for a hint of heat). This was a good winter soup with biscuits.

i FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS AND PREPARED THIS DISH AND FOUND THE RESULT UNDESIREABLE. i ENDED UP PUTTING THE SOLID INGREDIENTS IN A STRAINER AND RINSED WITH COLD WATER AND USED THESE INGREDIENTS TO MAKE CHILI. tHE SOUP WAS TOO HOT.
