I've made these several times and have loved them every time. This time I used fresh dates. The bars are a huge success and everyone seems to love the crunchiness of the almonds and sesame seeds, and the chewiness of the dates. I make it exactly as the recipe states. Great tea time treat!

I found these to be okay, but not really what I wanted. They were a bit too chewy and dry.

the recipe as written (with all the changes the cook from israel made i'm not sure we're talking about the same thing) results in a cakey bar. i was expecting sublime, deep flavor, but these were light, sweet and indistinct, almost bland. i think i'll try classic date bars on this site next.

These were great. I substituted whole wheat pastry flour,1/3 cup oil for the butter, and reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup to make them healthier. I also cut them into smaller serving pieces. A winner!
