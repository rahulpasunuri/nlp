Where did it all go? This was a big hit at our holiday dinner. I used the Grade B and was just very careful to keep it from over-reducing. Followed the recipe exactly aside from using the Grade B, and everyone was thrilled.

I made this for Christmas dinner and my family loved it! My aunt, who has made many a cheesecake in her day, said it was the best cheesecake she had ever eaten!

This was a very easy cheesecake to make. Made it for Thanksgiving this year. I baked it in a water bath like I do all my cheesecakes and it did not crack. Didn't have any graham crackers at home so I made a pecan butter crumb crust. Didn't have a single slice left for the next day. My guests couldn't tell me enough how delicious it was.

I made this cheesecake twice for Thanksgiving last year, and it turned out perfectly both times. Mine were about 5-10 min shy of needing the full baking time, and both times they did crack on top, but don't panic, after letting it cool and refrigerating it there was absolutely no sign of the cracking--the top was beautiful, actually. I found the crust to be a great match, it was light and remained a bit crunchy, and I also personally enjoyed the cheesecake more without the cranberry compote. And as with any cheesecake, even if you're in a rush, make it (at the very least) the night before; the flavors will be much stronger this way.

Awful! What a waste of fabulous expensive maple syrup and cream cheese. If you try it--get ready for SWEET cloyingly Sweet! Overwhelmingly Sweet. If I ever tried it again I would more than half the reduced syrup and make sure the topping was very tangy. Sorry the flavors were a huge miss for us! And I am a cheesecake fanatic.

I made this for Christmas, and it turned out fabulous. The cranberry compote was also excellent!

I wish the author of this recipe had amplified the fact that you simply want to incorporate the eggs into the cake batter to ensure a dense, creamy texture. I made the mistake of over beating the eggs, which resulted in a too puffy/not as dense cheesecake. Furthermore, the cooking time seemed off as stated in the recipe. In my case the cake's top cracked when baked the entire 1 1/2 hours as called for in the recipe. Not the most expertly written recipe.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was perfect. Very decadent with subtle maple flavor. The maple cranberry compote was delicious on top -- and I even had extra that I served on top of steel cut oats for breakfast the next couple of days. Perfect cheesecake. Will definitely make again.

Given the several cautionary reviews, I almost didn't attempt this recipe. My curiosity won out and I (and my family) am glad that it did. I made the recipe exactly as written, using brown sugar. The syrup reduced to one cup in 5 minutes (I used a rather large, heavy pot and stirred it occasionally), the texture was firm yet creamy, the maple flavor was subtle but nice, the compote was excellent. I served creme fraiche as an additional topping -- heaven. It was an utterly perfect cheesecake.

This was great!! I made the crust with 'nilla wafers - no graham crackers and the store was closed- and it was very well received Christmas Eve, no time to make the compote so i can't comment on that.

Mine is in the oven now, I just wanted to comment on the reduction process. Mine, too, took a very long time to reduce by 1/2 c. And the first time my husband stirred too much and it turned into hard sucre moue. The second time I stirred very occasionally and it turned out fine. I hope mine doesn't fall!

I made this for Thanksgiving. The cheesecake was DELICIOUS! Everyone loved it. I was not as wild about the Cranberry Compote. Next time I am going to try it with a sweeter cranberry mixture as a topping. I had no problem with the maple syrup not carmelizing.

Made this exactly as directed and found it easy and delicious. Maple flavor was more subtle than anticipated. Lovely consistency and very simple to make.

This was the first cheesecake I have ever made and it turned out perfectly! I used grade A dark amber maple syrup (Archer Farms Brands from Target) and didn't have any problems with the syrup crystallizing. I did use light brown sugar in place of ridiculously expensive maple sugar and allowed the cake to cool in the oven after turning it off for about 20 minutes- other than I followed the recipe as written. The cranberry- maple compote was a perfect complement and I plan on using the leftovers on pancakes this weekend! I've already had requests to make this again!

In response to previous reviews about the reduced maple syrup--you're supposed to use Grade A maple syrup. And you don't have to let the syrup cool down COMPLETELY. I made this cake for Thanksgiving and everyone ranted and raved. They especially loved the paring of Maple-Cranberry Compote. Next time I make this, I want to reduce additional maple syrup to drizzle on the top of the cake for a thickened caramel effect. Will DEFINITELY make this again

Don't attempt. This was not a well tested recipe. I made $12 worth of maple sugar by mistake,following the instructions exactly. I measured my syrup after 5 min. and had at least 1 and 1/4 cups, so I let it go an additional 2 minutes to get an exact 1 cup measure. When it was cooled to room temp it was a block of sugar. I continued the recipe with 1 cup of not reduced maple syrup (grade A dark amber) and the result was a disappointment. Mine also fell. Of the hundred or so cheesecakes I have made, this was the worse.

This was delicious. I had never made a cheesecake before and was a bit intimidated, but it really turned out perfect. I kept a close eye on the maple syrup while reducing and let it go for about 12 minutes on low. It did not fully reduce to a cup, but I just used one cup of what I had and it turned out well. I used Grade B syrup from Trader Joes. I added a little maple extract to the compote to bump up the maple flavor. I also ran a hand blender through the compote and used it as a glaze for the cake rather than serving it along side. I threw on a border of toasted pecans and it looked beautiful.

I experienced the same problem as the cook from Cambridge, MA. My maple syrup (Organic A Grade Amber Color Whole Foods brand) resisted reduction and crystallized after it was reduced by 0.5 cup. Initially I had to spend at least half an hour reducing it. The quick method (5 minutes on medium-high) did not work for my syrup at all - I measured the remaining syrup and it was still 1.5 cups. It took me 30 min on low setting to reduce it to the asked volume. I agree with the Cambridge's cook that the flavor of the cake considering all the fancy preparations of the syrup is underwhelming. I wonder how would it taste like saving you some time and money with just 1 cup of an unreduced maple syrup. Additional complaint is that the cheesecake fell, although I followed all the instructions. I am not sure if this is the recipe or my oven. I would err on the side of caution and attribute this failure to my oven. Maybe I needed to use higher over temperature more typical for cheesecakes (325) and let the cake cool in there for some time before opening the door of the oven.

BIG (but fixable) PROBLEM WITH THIS RECIPE. The problem: The syrup almost completely crystallized during the reduction step, making a maple sugar-y sludge. (I used grade B syrup--- perhaps that's the problem?) Also, boiling over is a huge problem, so I'd advise using a large saucepan. The syrup holds an amazing amount of heat (more than simple sugar syrups), so even if you take it off heat, the boiling keeps getting more vigorous for an anxious minute or so. The fix: I added the maple sludge to the cream cheese at the very beginning of mixing (the filling) and made sure it dissolved completely before proceeding with the recipe. Taste-wise, the cheesecake wasn't as maple-y as I expected. I used brown sugar, not maple sugar, though. But the accompanying compote is seriously tasty, esp. with a pinch of salt.

Made this exactly according to directions; it turned out great. Everyone raved. Consistency was perfect.
