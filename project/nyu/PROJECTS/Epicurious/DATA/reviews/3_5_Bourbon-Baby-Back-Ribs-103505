I made this recipe for our memorial day BBQ. It was my first time making ribs, and I was concerned that I wouldnt get the crowd pleaser results I wanted forom a "Quick recipe". I wasn't disappointed. The ribs all went and everyone loved them. I boiled the ribs for 30 min in a bath seasoned with a bay leaf, peppercorns and some sea salt and then seasoned the ribs themselves with a quick rub (suggested by Kathi way down at teh bottom of teh reviews) before slathering them in teh modified sauce. next time I think I'll add a touch of brown sugar to the sauce as I like a sweeter BBQ sauce...but otherwise - thumbs up! I'll definitely make these again.

The four forks are for the SAUCE. Easy and wonderful and I like to add some honey or brownsugar depending on the kind of bottled sauce I begin with. Pair this sauce with the "Southwestern Style Baby Back Ribs" and you have a total winner.

I agree that the sauce is abosolutely worth the effort. I've made this with a number of different bottled sauces and it always comes out great. I too do a slow roast, with a rub, for about two hours and finish the ribs on the grill. That's the reason for three forks; the sauces is great but the rib recipe isn't.

I boiled the ribs for about 15 minutes before putting on the grill...this cuts down on the cooking time and you have less chance of burning... the sauce was ok, but it was a bit too sweet..I will try another BBQ sauce next time..one that has a more smokey flavor. I will make again.

The sauce is great...HOWEVER...I really don't understand cooking ribs...and having them be done and tender....in 23 minutes. I did as someone suggested and cooked the ribs in the sauce. At a low temp and for 2 hours. Great flavor.

Delicious. Just made these tonight. Took me a little longer to get the ribs really tender. Used Penzeys spices. A keeper.

The hassle of buying all the extra ingredients and stewing them up for the BBQ was WELL WORTH IT! And it made so much that I froze the left over sauce and used it on ribs three additional times. For some reason I accientally used rum instead of bourbon, but it tasted great anyway. Try to plan ahead on this one, my husband was extremely hungry by the time I finally finished brewing up the sauce.

Made my tongue slap my teeth! Used Rick Bayless Topolo Roasted Red Pepper&Honey as the sauce base, hickory chips on the gas grill. These ribs are all mine!

Tried Kathy EK's rub and found it a bit too spicy. I think I'll back off the 2TB of pepper (tried doing this to the chili powder, but it made no difference) to 1tsp next time. I also doubled the sauce and used it to make BBQ'd chicken the next day. Great tasting sauce. 3.5hrs in my oven wasn't enough for fall off the bone ribs. Very tender though.

well, hot damn. i always thought baby back ribs were supposed to be a pain in the ribs to make: boil, cook forever, etc... not so. in fact, this recipe's cooking time is a bit longer than necessary. the sauce was super, but then it had two of my fave ingredients: bourbon and cilantro. i hate to admit that i used "Crawford, Texas, The Western White House Bar-B-Q Sauce" (made by Eddie Dean & Co) since I am no fan of our Misleader In Chief. but the sauce was great (especially after the doctoring up as this recipe ordered). Mmmm. I hate the whole rack myself. And washed it down with a liter of Belgian ale, a perfect complement to this dish (though if you prefer a wine, I recommend a gewurtraminer... you snob).

Super easy recipe, great flavor. They still came out a little dry so I will cut the grilling time down a few minutes next time I make these. Served alongside rosemary potatoes, this made a great dinner for two.

This was great! used rum 'cuz i didn't have bourbon. remember to skin the membrane off of the back of the ribs before cooking. I cooked mine for about 40 minutes over indirect heat on my gas weber with the lid down. Will make this over and over. I guess the kind of bbq sauce you start with will make a difference also, but these were very tasty and tender. I used Napa Valley Vintage bbq and baking sauce. I also use Sweet Baby Ray's.

I made these ribs for my husband last night and it is our new favorite baby back rib recipe. I used the previous reviewer Kathy EK's rub recipe and baked the ribs covered in the oven at 325 degrees for 2 hours and 45 minutes. I then removed the lid, slathered the ribs with the barbecue sauce and then raised the oven temperature to 375 degrees cooking them for 30 minutes longer. They were fall apart tender and absolutely delicious! This is a definite make-again recipe!

these were good, I guess. I cooked them in a roasting pan in the oven instead of on the grill per someone's suggestion. They cooked for close to 3 hours. A couple of tips if you do decide to cook them this way 1) Buy many more ribs than you think you need - they shrink quite a bit. I bought 4 pounds for 5 adults and 2 children and it wasn't enough - v. embarrassing 2) Make at least 3 times as much BBQ sauce and don't put it all on the ribs. Save some. When the ribs came out of the oven the pan was black and the sauce was thick and sludgy - not good for eating. I had to make additional BBQ sauce for the actual meal. I usually have much better luck with ribs.

Reduce the amount of sauce by half. Reduce the amount of cumin - there's too much. We substituted shallots for onions. We also used a mixture of gourmet chile powder and chipotle chile pepper powder. For charcoal, we used the Matchlight Mesquite and one block of hickory wood. Reduce the cooking time to 20 minutes total and allow them to sit for 5 minutes after cooking before serving.

My husband loved these ribs. I made three times the amount of sauce to completely cover the ribs and baked them in the oven for 3 hours. They came out extremely tender and had just the right amount of spice and flavor.

I have made these several times for all sorts of occasions, but, am just now lending comments. I love these ribs, though, I make several changes. I always double the recipie - I love a lot of sauce. And, I bake the ribs in the oven. I just cannot see how they would fall off the bone after only 30 minutes on the grill, so, I've never done it that way. All I can say is that in the oven for 3+ hours they are very succelent.

... and we have a new first place over the calypso pork loin as my favorite Epicurious recipe. These ribs were fabulous! I accidentally used scotch instead of bourbon, oops, and I doubled the cumin, we love it, and it came out wonderfully. I can't wait to try it with bourbon (so, what's the difference again?). I agree with the reviewer who said it largely depends on the bbq sauce you start with, since it's the foundation of your flavor, and I used Stubs, original recipe for a bold and luke-hot kick. Thank you Epicurious!

I have never rated a recipe before but this is absolutely the most DELICIOUS - TASTE BURSTING barbecue sauce I have ever eaten. I used KC Masterpiece - Original as my base. I have since tried it on chicken and hamburgers and it is terrific. My only recommendation is triple the recipe you will never throw the sauce out.

What a nice surprise to have a succlulent rib ready for "bone sucking" in a relatively sort period of time. The neigbors hung over the fence, literally seduced into rudeness by the aroma. I will also use this recipe on shredded chicken for my "health conscious" guests.

Since we were having guests, I doubled the sauce recipe and thought it was just fantastic, as did my guests. However, after the ribs were grilled, we couldn't taste the sauce! Be sure to keep basting the ribs during the grilling process (as I told my husband while hitting him with the barbecue tongs). The sauce tasted so good that I'm going to make this dish again for the Fourth of July weekend - making sure that the ribs are appropriately basted.

I made this recipe 2 years ago and then lost it. My husband kept after me to refind this and make again. I made this 4 times, for us, a dinner party, and family visiting. All reviews were the same. The best ribs ever. It is simple and amazing. We served with roasted corn, potato salad and lemon blueberry cake. A winner!

I think the ultimate flavor of this dish depends on the type of BBQ sauce you being with, obviously. I used Jack Daniels' Spicy Smokey sauce, and it had a kick of heat, which I like. Also added more bourbon and a touch of cinnamon (secret ingredient, try it!). Served with a broccoli slaw with red cabbage, carrots and pineapple, the cool offset the heat perfectly. Added roasted asparagus and began with baked shitake mushroom polenta (also from this site). Finale was espresso chocolate swirl cheesecake (another from this site). It was a father's day to behold, again thanks to Epicurious!!!

This sauce was GREAT! (and really easy) I ended up putting the ribs in the oven for two hours at 350 because it was too cold to use the grill (snowstorm) and it was still wonderful. The cilantro makes the sauce.

I gave this a 4 foks becauce it was not only fabulous flavor, it was sooo simple to prepare. I followed the recipe with the exception of rubbing the ribs with Emeril's Essence. We have a fabulous grill (DCS) and I'm sure that makes a difference in the cooking time. As for flavor, we used RUDY's BBQ sauce (from Texas)the BBQ sauce you choose will make a difference - ours was really spicy which we love. We served the ribs with Potato & Pea Salad with Chive Aioli (BA 7/01) for a great menu.

Might consider pureeing the portion used as a dip, but the little crunchy pieces of onion on the meat while it's cooking are great. This is really an interesting, unusual, but not threatening BBQ sauce. Might also consider a little cayenne next time. Definately a keeper.

This recipe was fairly easy and delicious. We love cilantro. I served cole slaw and corn bread, my family loved it.

There is a much better recipe in Bon Appetit for Bourbon Barbecue sauce, I believe its in the July issue for '00. I'm kind of against using recipes which require purchased products.

This was a good and easy recipe. I would however reduce the cooking time.

Incredibly good, easy and quick to cook on the grill because you cut them into 2-rib sections. The June 2000 issue of Bon Appetit has some really great recipes...aptly named, "Foods We Love". We used hickory chips on the grill to enhance the smokey flavor. Using Makers Mark Bourbon did not hurt either! The only change I made was to substitute parsley for cilantro since my husband does not like it. This is on our favorites list!

I rubbed the ribs with spices. Used everything, including Bourbon which we don't drink. This was just okay, we thought. The flavor just wasn't spectacular, and there are so many rib recipes that are better.(I really kind of hate to say this when most everyone raved, but there it is.)

Rating: 4
Exceptional! I too tried my own rub spices: Montreal Steak Seasoning, white pepper, sugar, cumin, allspice, red pepper flakes and as I have had an unused bottle of 5 spice powder, I dusted the ribs librally with it. Changed the marinade too (no bourbon so just 2 teas red wine vinegar and garlic and olive oil). It was spectacular! First time ever I made ribs right and thanks to substitutions suggested by other reviewers,and otherwise strict adherence to the recipe directions it was delicious. I just went nuts with this one and had fun. Served this with homemade cornbread, macaroni salad and followed with a wild blueberry pie. Guests are still talking about it.

Here is my secret to making this recipe a real winner...first, parboil the ribs for at least 30 minutes in water seasoned with the named spices; then grill until crispy and add the sauce at the end thus avoiding burning. Yum.

They were great! I grilled them the exact time given in the recipe which made them a bit too done. Next time I would grill them less.

These ribs were incredible. This recipe is definitely a keeper. The bbq sauce was great.

Truly excellent!! Just the right amount of zip. Kathy's spice rub (see below) certainly added to the overall flavor and I would highly recommend this added touch.

2 and a half forks, really! These were good, but the ribs were burned by the time the sauce went on them. I think this may be our fault, though-- I suspect the barbecue was too hot for the meat. The sauce was excellent, though I couldn't taste the bourbon. Tasted like it had been simmering for hours-- no one would know it was bottled sauce with a few spices thrown in. I'll try these again and monitor my grill more closely next time.

This sauce was great! We doubled the recipe and used it on country ribs. My husband was going to tamper with the recipe (he didn't think the flavor was potent enough) when we mixed it, but we let it stand in the fridge for a few hours before using and the flavors blended nicely in the meantime.

I combined this recipe w/one I found on the readers' forum. Basically, I used the rub from the other recipe, baked the ribs undisturbed in the oven for about 2 hrs @ 325, then used the doctored BBQ sauce from this recipe to finish on the grill. They were fantastic! The dry rub is 2tbspns ea of salt, sugar, ground cumin, pepper, chili or mesquite powder, and 4 tbspns each of paprika and sugar. Try it!

This recipe was outstanding and very easy (although I am not an expert on barbeque sauces). Doctoring the purchased BBQ sauce is simple and dthe ribs are spicy and delicious.
