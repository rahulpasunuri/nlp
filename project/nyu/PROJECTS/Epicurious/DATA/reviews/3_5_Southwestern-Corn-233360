I thought the recipe was so-so but my family LOVED it. My husband says my best recipes are not appreciated by our large family gatherings, so convinced me to do something less sophisticated. He was right. This dish was a hit at Thanksgiving.

I like to use this as a base. I add a can of organic black beans, a little cumin and some zuchini to the saute. Delicious, and a complete protein!
