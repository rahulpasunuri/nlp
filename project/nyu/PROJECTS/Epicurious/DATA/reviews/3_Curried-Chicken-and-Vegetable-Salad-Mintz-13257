I made my own curry powder which had a fresher taste - I have a granite pestle and mortar so can used whole spices. Use a really good brand of curry powder if using ready mixed. I omitted the carrots and added some currants for a little sweetness. This is a lot of onion and potato - you might want to moderate that.
