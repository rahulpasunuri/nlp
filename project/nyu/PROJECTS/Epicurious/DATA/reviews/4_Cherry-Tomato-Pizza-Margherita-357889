Made this last night for my brother's birthday, and it was a hit with the whole family! They even said they prefer this pizza over the pizza you'd get from a pizza parlor. It was my first time making it, and I will make it again soon, hopefully. Tons of flavor, delicious.

This was a great recipe. Used frozen pizza dough from Fresh Market and added some chunks of chicken breast.

This was really great. Don't use a tube of pizza dough. Buy fresh from your grocery store (Wegmans is great) or pizza parlor if you don't feel like making your own. I doubled the red pepper and ground it and the fennel with a pestle. It seemed easier than smashing that small an amount with a huge rolling pin. I also tripled the garlic. We really like garlic. The sauce was son delicious and easy I may never buy bottled again. You could probably use a bit less basil than called for. A third cup is a bit much. I love basil, but a quarter cup is probably sufficient.

First time ever I was not thrilled with an epicurious recipe. If I had read the reviews more carefully I would have known they were for the sauce, not the dough. Disappointed is an understatement. Will try another pizza dough recipe until I find the right one. Living in the U.K., that is one thing I really miss about America - good pizza!

Great simple pizza recipe that small children (3-6 y/o and up) can "help" you make. My granddaughter is in the kitchen grating and mincing toppings( with a butter knife;)) for this pie as I type. She'll have the pleasure of adding topping ingredients to the pie at her own discretion before baking the pie. The cherry tomato sauce is SLAMMING and will certainly show up as part of our regular roster whether at home,on the grill or incorporated in a pasta dish. Believe it or not, this pie will have roasted beets, mushrooms and carrots amongst the toppings. Many of the veggies are items I have difficulties getting her to eat solo. In the interest of time yet w/o sacrifices, I bought the pizza dough from WF; worthy!

Really good pizza. I make this for my kids during the week and use flatbread instead of making the dough to save time.

This is fabulous as appetizer, light dinner, or a girl friend lunch. Easy & roasting the tomatoes until they are a bit charred adds wonderful flavor. Definitely a family favorite.

I will never make traditional pizza sauce using canned tomatoes again. This tomato topping is made lickety split, intensely flavorful and fresh tasting. Tomatoes get tossed in a hot wok til skins are charred, giving them a couple minutes to soften and fresh garlic and fennel seed thrown in at the end. Easiest, tastiest tomato topping yet. It's that good.

Just terrific. Like another reviewer, I used pizza dough from Whole Foods and it worked perfectly. I was feeding a 5-year-old, so I omitted the red pepper from the tomato mixture, but I imagine it would have been a great finishing touch.

I've made this pizza about 4 or 5 times now and we love it every time. I usually make this pizza at the end of the week to use up any remaining vegetables I have (bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, artichokes, etc.) The sauce is delicious. Two thumbs up. One word of caution - More than once, I've created a large flare in the skillet when adding the cherry tomatoes to the oil. I'm sure it's something seasoned chefs know how to avoid, but I've come to take a step back during this step.

How have I not reviewed this pizza yet? We make it about twice a month! Pizza is one of my favorite ways to eat vegetarian, so I was excited to see this recipe in Bon Appetit. My old margherita pizza recipe was a little tired, and this sure did the trick! The cherry tomatoes are sweet and go well with the fennel and crushed red pepper. The only thing I do differently was sub a 7 oz ball of buffalo mozzarella for the other cheeses. Also, I used whole wheat pizza dough from Trader Joe's and cooked the pizza according to the directions on the crust (which I would definitely recommend). Yum!

A pretty good pizza, but I found the tomato sauce too sour. I used storebought tomatoes, and next time I would use homegrown perfectly ripe tomatoes or else add a little sugar to the sauce to balance out the acidity.

I've made this three or four times exactly as written and it's legendary. It gets special requested by visitors all the time.

Really delicious. I added pepperoni to half the pizza (my boyfriend insisted) and while I preferred without, there were some meat-lovers that gobbled up the pepperoni half. Doubled garlic and probably used a whole tsp of red pepper, but otherwise followed recipe exactly. Will definitely make again.

This is a great pizza! Definitely one to splurge on a little with nice ingredients, since it's so simple and the quality of each piece is more important. I used Whole Foods dough, which I always love. The fennel adds a nice touch and the heat of the red pepper keeps it from being boring at all. I did add an extra clove of garlic c - one just didn't sound like enough. I will definitely make this again!

I was inspired to make something with the fresh basil harvested from a friend's garden this afternoon and this was perfect. I used a quick-rise recipe for homemade dough that requires a tsp of sugar and only takes 30 minutes and it turned out amazingly well, even at altitude. The savory garlic and crushed red pepper mingle perfectly with the cheese and sweet crust. I added aged parmesan to the cheese mixture and didn't have any fennel seed so I substituted with fresh oregano from the garden and it was delicious!

Delicious, fresh and a little spicy. Used W. Puck's pizza dough recipe, which was crispy and complemented the sparse toppings (which is good thing...) Not too much cheese making a soggy crust, and the fresh, yummy tomatoes were beautifully balanced with a little spice from the peppers! Definite do-again!

amazing pizza! a little spicy too.

I loved this recipe. Relatively easy, and worth it. I used homemade dough (from the book My Bread). Only change I made was that we didn't have fennel so I used herb de provence instead. The flavors were delicious. I would also make the sauce again for pasta.

Have made this many times as a quick weeknight dinner. Sauce is fantastic as is the double cheese. I like to sprinkle the basil on mid-way through the cooking, but sometimes I just toss it all in/on and laze it up. I either make dough, or more often than not (laze it up), use pizza dough from the local bakery.

I had a sinking feeling when there was no mention of treating the baking sheet beforehand. Sure enough, the TJ pizza dough I used stuck like glue to the pan. The finished product looked great but the meal was a loss. I plan to try it again, this time with a little cornmeal under the dough. Any other tips or suggestions? Thx.

Try Flatout flatbread for the crust, don't put on too much topping, cook in convection oven directly on the rack @350 or so. Yum.

This recipe is okay with the refrigerated dough being its downfall. The basil cooks too long making it soggy.

Loved this recipe! I was afraid it may be a little bland, so I used 2 cloves of garlic, and some extra crushed red peppers. Delicious! I used the refrigerated dough, which worked fine, but plan to make my own next time.

I found this pizza to be very blah. It didn't taste bad it was just kind of boring. Definitely make your own dough. I liked the tomato sauce, but the pizza is missing some things. As is, I probably won't make it again.

I really liked the sauce and will definitely try this again. My only problem was the refrigerated dough...I could only find Pillsbury and it was crap.

Love the sauce, cheese combo - not in love with the canned dough and, surprised actually, that Bon Appetit recommends it. Even a Boboli or other store bought crust would be better. Probably worth the effort of making your own dough, purchasing from a pizza shop or using frozen pizza dough.

Loved the toppings, but I am not wild about canned refrigerated dough. It all seems to have the same taste to me (like those biscuits that come in a can). But the toppings, cheese and tomato were great. I think I'll try to make this on a more standard homemade pizza crust. Takes a lot more time though.

The sauce alone is 4 forks worthy and can't wait to try it out in other dishes. I made my own dough, and added some homemade ricotta to the cheese mixture, and topped the final product with a sprinkling of olive oil before baking. I also preheated the oven and baking pan, cooked the pizza at 450 for 15 min, and then cranked it to 500 for the last 10 or so. Resulted in a super crispy crust, with golden cheese.

This was simple and delicious. I didn't have fresh basil or fennel seeds so I just mixed in some dried basil while cooking the tomatoes. Very fresh:)I will make it again for sure.

Delicious and easy to make. Definitely a keeper. I followed the receipt exactly and wouldn't change a thing. YUM!

Super easy! I like my crust a little thinner, so I think I'll stretch it out a tad more next time (more than the 12x8 recommended, that is). I considered not buying fennel seed, since it's not something that I use, but after trying this sauce that will definitely change. The sauce itself is delicious, and I will try tossing that with some capellini and chopped basil in the future. The cheeses are in just the right ratio. Oh, and the other reviewers are right: cut the time down. Fifteen minutes made my pizza a tad too brown (but still delicious).

This was my first time making a pizza, and this recipe made it super easy! I was a little concerned about the tomato sauce, but it worked out perfectly. I went to Trader Joe's to get the herb pizza dough and mini heirloom tomatoes. Added more fennel seeds. Also, I added Tofurkey Italian Turkey Sausage. It was delicious! Reduced cooking time. I like my dough a little doughy.

Another note, I also had a lot of liquid, but turning on the convection and leaving the pizza in longer evaporated it up. Trade off was crispier crust, but that is not a bad thing!

Very easy! The tomatoes had a subtle fennel taste that lended a complexity to the flavours. This was even better the next day as 'cold pizza'.

Delicious and very fresh tasting. But the specified cooking time is far too long, at least in my oven (and according to the times given on the pizza dough tube). Mine was done in 15 minutes.

This is so good! However, between the tomato water and the liquid exuded by the cheese, there is way too much liquid, and caused the center of the crust to be too soggy (and ran off the pan as it cooked). I ended up tilting the pan to let some of the liquid run off, and used a turkey baster to remove a couple teaspoons worth. I would definitely make this again, but the amount of liquid has to be reduced; perhaps by boiling down the tomato water a bit?
