Super easy! I use a grill pan on the stove top for the chicken. I also tweak the recipe a bit, adding a couple of crushed anchovies to the tomato sauce, a few capers or chopped green olives and a splash of Pernod. I use fresh plum tomatoes during the season and canned, diced tomatoes otherwise. My family enjoys this with crusty bread and a big green salad.

Nice change of pace, easy to make. I will use crushed tomatoes next time instead of diced so that the flavor of the spices can blend better with the tomato.

This was good. I did need to doctor it up a bit with some crushed red pepper. My two year old enjoyed it, pre-peppered. Served the chicken along side the potatoes as recommended.

I picked this dish out because I thought my wife would like it, even though I knew I wouldn't. She didn't like it either. Oh well.

This dish was full of flavor and easy to prepare! Very fresh tasting and healthy. I also seared the chicken in olive oil and baked it with the sauce. The chicken was tender and juicy, the sauce tastes great over white rice!

I've made this a few times, and it always turns out great. I prefer to serve it over noodles, with some steamed veggies on the side.

We both enjoyed this one, though the second time I made it, I used breadcrumbs on the chicken. I think they gave a little more life to the chicken cooked separately, and a little more texture to the dish.

This is NOT a tasty recipe! First, the sauce has too much oregano in it. Second, the sauce dries out. Third, since the chicken is cooked separatley, it is unatractive. We didn't even have seconds on this one. I would recommend one of the other chicken provencale recipes- i saw 2 when i searched.

Fantastic, made with turkey breast cutlets (after thanksgiving sale). Quite melt in your mouth. Threw it all together and put in oven to bake slowly since I was making it for a dinner party of twelve. Served with saffron rice. Went over very well.

this dish is just wonderful -- whether for a quiet dinner or for guests. the sauce is simple but delicious -- i add some lemon rind in addition to the orange rind, and that gives it a nice zip. i also saute the chicken just enough to sear and brown it, then put the chicken and half the sauce in a baking dish, and bake til it's cooked through ... this makes for very moist chicken and infuses the flavors well. this is definitely a favorite, and a snap to make in a hurry.
