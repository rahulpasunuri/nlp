The flavors of this were good (I used a gingersnap crust which I find compliments tarts better than a regular crust, and is easier to make!), but I had trouble getting the custard to the right consistency. When I chilled it it got so firm it wouldn't spread on the crust, and I had to re-warm it to loosen it up, and after that it never quite set again. I think the white balsamic tart on this site is better, but the combination of ginger and tropical fruit was a good flavor.

This is a delicious fruit tart, and it looks beautiful! My husband is always seeking out the perfect fruit tart and he thinks he's found it! I didn't put ginger in the crust, and I used apricot jam instead of ginger for the glaze. I also used different fruit (kiwis, peaches, strawberries and blackberries). I substituted low-fat milk (even though it says not to) and it turned out just fine. I have already madet this twice in two weeks and will certainly make it again!

I made this for a summer barbecue party, and everyone loved it. I was afraid the ginger in the pastry cream would be overwhelming, but it added a wonderful flavor. My only complaint was the ginger preserve/brandy syrup on the top of the fruit slices never really "set", even after several hours of refrigeration. It remained somewhat liquid and syrupy. Maybe I didn't cook it long enough, or it was too hot when I brushed it on the fruit. Oh well, it didn't diminish from the look or taste of the overall product very much. Recommend this one. Crust stayed crisp, and wasn't too sweet.
