Each year I make mint brownies for the family Christmas get-together. Always seeking a combo of flavor and ease, I settled on this one for 2010's batch. Like an earlier poster, I used a modified Mark Bittman basic brownie recipe (which has recently been my go to brownie recipe). Suggest you use whatever your favorite brownie recipe is instead of the one shown here. I used Trader Joe's bittersweet chocolate in both toppings. They were fantastic...there are none left, two days later! Note for next year: double the batch. With these mods three forks for easy minty topping idea...

Just a note...the small amount of cinnamon in this recipe is definitely noticeable. If you don't like cinnamon-chocolate, I'd recommend leaving it out. The three textures together are delicious, however.

This was really good. I froze a few of them and they were awesome!

Excellent dessert. Everyone who ate it loved it. I did not have a 8 in sqr pan, so made it in a round 9 in spring form. Brownie base was thinner. Only problem, it is messy lots of clean up.

Mine wasn't as pretty as the picture but the taste and texture made up for it. For serious chocolate cravings, this recipe does not disappoint! Awesome flavor, very rich and decadent, but very hard to eat just one small piece! Still excellent 3 days later kept at room temp. Used bittersweet chocolate and I had no peppermint extract so substituted finely crushed peppermint Altoids with no problem.

I made this for a family get-together and everyone loved it. I made it with a whole teaspoon of cinnamon, and I put it in a 9" square. Using high quality chocolate (Lindt for me) really made a difference because the flavors are so important in the ganache-type layers. It was the first time I had worked with real white chocolate and was a little afraid when adding the mint extract (horror stories of adding any liquid to melted chocolate, especially alcohol based) but nothing happened. My family raved about it! They told me it was one of the best recipes I've ever made--which is a lot. It did get better on the 2nd and 3rd days, so try to keep come pieces around. I loved eating all the layers separately to appreciate all of the flavors before devouring the whole piece (we did 12ths it was so rich.) Recommend this to anyone with a chocolate craving.

After reading the reviews, I decided to look for another brownie recipe and was surprised to find that Mark Bittman's recipe (from How to Cook Everything) had nearly identical ingredients and amounts. So I used the epicurious ingredients and Bittman's preparation and the brownie base came out soft and chewy very good. Main differences seem to be more gentle mixing (melt butter and chocolate together, transfer to mixing bowl and stir in sugar; beat in eggs and mix in other ingredients by hand) and less baking time (20-25 minutes; I used 21). You can also use aluminum foil instead of parchment. I used a small saucepan over VERY low heat instead of a double boiler and this worked well for all 3 layers. Just remove from heat before chocolate is all melted and continue stirring to finish melting. This is a delicious brownie/cake. You may be tempted to have more than one serving, but 1/8 of the pan is plenty!

At first i was disappointed with these.. mostly because of the brownie base. But after a few days (2 or 3) they got much better... and thier were none left by the 4th. If I make them again i'd probably try it with a different brownie recipe.

This was no great shakes; very disappointing. The cake part was pretty bad; if I did make again (and I doubt I would) I would use a different brownie recipe. The white layer was a waste of good white chocolate (confectioners sugar and margarine would have been cheaper and just fine). For some reason, it improved a little with age so it wasn't a total loss. But I will renew my search for a good mint brownie recipe.

The first time I made this recipe, I did it exactly as printed. We all loved the mint and ganache layers, but were thoroughly unimpressed with the cake layer. I now make the recipe using my favorite homemade brownie recipe for the base, with the mint and ganache layer as printed. Everyone raves and asks to have this recipe made over and over.

Wonderful! Definatly among the best brownies Ive made, very very rich though, almost like candy. So I cut them into tiny little squares.

The frosting and mint layer were amazing! Not as impressed with the cake part, but it was still tasty. Definitely use the parchment paper. I didn't and the cake stuck so i just left it in the pan and frosted the top.

I've made these brownies several times, cutting them into bite size squares. They are so rich and decadent, like a dessert in a swanky restaurant. If I'm taking them somewhere, I give the brownies a clean edge by cutting off the sides-they're a bit tough and raggedy anyhow. In response to the reviewer wondering if a metal pan would eliminate a sunken middle-no luck....mine sink every time.

This dessert is wonderful, the flavors are perfect and the textures are divine. I used crushed candy canes as a garnish. The only thing I would change is the title. I made it for my husband's birthday, and as soon as I saw how flat it was I stopped referring to it as cake lest people laugh.

This was fabulous and easy to make. I didn't have a metal cake pan so I used a glass one. The only problem was the center of the cake sagged a bit while cooling on the rack. I don't know if that would have happened with a metal pan. Anyway, it didn't matter... the white chocolate icing filled in the dip and you couldn't tell at all once the chocolate glaze was added. It looked even better when cut into pieces so you could see the layers. Every single bit was eaten and everyone wanted the recipe. A previous reviewer accurately described the taste as similar to a "junior mint". Yum! Next time I will save a little white chocolate icing to drizzle on top for extra decoration.

I brought this cake to two different parties and it won rave reviews by all! It's pretty easy to make as well. I made a little extra white chocolate mint and drizzled it across the top for fun...

This was easy to make. A great dessert if you need one for a potluck picnic or BBQ. Good way to end a meal - the mint is refreshing and overall it was not too sweet. I like the suggestions for other flavors given by other reviewers.

I made these for a party and when I came back to the table of food about 20 minutes after the guests arrived they were gone. Everyone raved about them, I even found a friend looking in the fridge to find more of them. The only problem is they are a little hard to cut, the chocolate tends to break. You definitely need to keep a bowl of hot water to dip the knife in when cutting.

Gotta make this one yourself as it is a wonderful recipe! I used the best chocolate I could find (Valhrona and Scharfenberger) and it paid off. This tastes like a gourmet "Junior Mint" brownie cake. I took it to a party and everyone asked for the recipe. I am not even a big chocolate cake eater and loved it. I can't say enough about it than to do this one yourselves.

One of the richest, most sinful desserts I have made. Won raves from everyone (and a few suggestions that I should sell them!) I left out the mint entirely for a "black and white" bar effect, and it was just as good. I loved the cinammon addition to the brownie; it gave it a slight difference that really set the cake apart. Will be making these again ASAP!

This was absolutely devine. My family said it tasted (and looked) like it came from a professional bakery! At first, I was afraid the white chocolate layer was not thick enough and the layers would not show--but upon cooling everything came together perfectly.

As per the previous reviews, these are marvelous indeed. The double layer of white chocolate mint and bittersweet ganache really makes for an elegant looking dessert. My only regret is that I didn't double the recipe.

This recipe was so delicious! I brought it to a party and everyone thought it was amazing. I would make it again in a second!

This recipes yields a great-tasting treat - and I would make it again, but it is definitely a 'brownie' not a 'cake'. The flavors are great (I followed the recipe exactly, but added some green food coloring to the white chocolate layer for St. Patrick's Day). The finished look and texture are much more like a brownie than a cake. It will be a great addition to a cookie platter.

Since I don't like mint much, I substituted almond extract instead of the mint. It was wonderful. My kids thought it was better than a birthday cake! (way-better!) My husband liked it so much, he didn't want to send any to his office to share. Personally, I think just about anything covered in chocolate ganache is great, but I think the flavors blended well and the layers looked impressive. It was pretty easy to make too, so I am going to make it again as a second dessert for Easter dinner.
