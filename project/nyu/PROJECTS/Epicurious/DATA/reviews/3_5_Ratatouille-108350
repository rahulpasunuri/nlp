Great recipe. Great flavor. Great way to use up fall veggies. One caveat: read the recipe before you decide it's for dinner. You need the afternoon free. This takes some effort and some time. The only reason I gave it three forks instead of four is that it's quite time-consuming. Note: I sort of spoiled the vegan purity of the thing. I added a slice of applewood-smoked bacon to the skillet and left it there through the preparation of the veggies. Then I minced the bacon and added it to the pot. So sue me.

This is a good recipe but I gave it 3 stars because the directions would have you cook it way too long. Once everything was together I brought it to a boil and then simmered it only 5 minutes more. Every ingredient in this dish came from my garden except the parsley. It will not grow here in the summer.

You forgot to add the fresh thyme: Without that it will hardly taste authentic!

A good recipe that needs a few mods: add a serrano pepper; use less oil, about 2/3 of what the recipe calls for seems right; simmer the veggies for 20 mins max, not 1 hour; drain the liquid off at the end of the simmer and boil it down by about 1/2, then add it back in. Then, it ain't bad.

This was actually a very good recipe, and a fantastic dish, but I did change a few things. I added just one can of stewed tomatoes to the sauce, and I don't see why the onion, garlic and bell pepper can't all be sauteed together. Last, I briefly sauteed my veggies, then lined them in a dish and baked them at 400 until they were crisp, when I took them out I poured the sauce on top and served them over rigatoni noodles, with grated aged white cheddar on top and parmesan. It was actually extremely good. I agree about the oil, that much isn't needed. But that is easy to sort of eye and make your own judgement.

This dish was fine, but it was a little offputting. The veggies ended up a bit overcooked.

I have tried several different recipes for ratatouille and found this to be my favorite so far. I added fresh thyme and herbes de provence during the final simmering. Stir gently so as not to crush the sauteed vegetables, and for best flavor, serve the day after preparation. I heated the leftover ratatouille along with some leftover grilled sausage links that I cut into pieces. Served over basmati rice, it was delicious.

Rather than basil, use herbes de provence or thyme and lavender - makes all the difference.

I made this a while ago, following the recipe. It tasted really good but was extremely heavy- I would cut the olive oil down to two or three tablespoons total. Also, I love basil, so I did use it and probably wouldn't change it. I might try some herbes de provence instead next time.... But I think I will try the suggestion from the Epicurous recipe that deals with roasting the vegetables instead of sauteeing them.

This recipe had a lot of steps and took some time, but it tasted great. Not a quick weekday meal, but worked out well since I had a ton of late summer vegetables that needed to be used.

I tried this the other day and only made a few changes...1) The amount of oil called for is absolutely ridiculous, so I eye-balled the amount mixed in with the tomatoes and used PAM Olive oil spray for the veggies (GASP!). 2) I didn't cook the veggies as long as was called for because I just did not have the time, in the end it made for less mushy veggies. 3) I reduced the amount of basil and salt and added thyme. The result was probably the best veggie comfort food I have ever had...I will definitely make it again!

it shouldn't be this complicated...the jist of it is here...saute the onions and garlic till golden and add the veggies I ADDED CORN CUT FROM THE COB just because and I see another reader did...cover, cook till desired tenderness...maybe 1/2 hr and wallah... we had leftover linguini we warmed in it while it simmered at the end and a side of meatballs and it was fabulous...and forget 1 cup of olive oil...what a waste! I doubt we even used 1/2 a cup while sauteing the onions...covering it steams the veggies beautifully...adding a fresh basil as a touch or stay authentic and do thyme as another reader mentioned...

This is THE best ratatouille reicipe. I have made it many times. Roasting the vegetables deepens their flavor. The delicate tomato sauce doesn't overwhelm the other vegetables. One word of advice: watch the salt. I elect to add a little salt only at the beginning and to taste before serving.

I still can't reconcile the enormous amount of olive oil that this includes. As with others, I'm surprised about the inclusion of basil. It appears to have become a standard ingredient . . . I found it listed in most of the ingredient lists of the Internet ratatouille recipes. I was distracted when I was adding it and only thought about it after I put it in. I did add fresh thyme as well and I think it makes for a much more ""French" flavor profile. If you are entranced with basil I would suggest that you only stir it in at the very end otherwise the flavor is diminished. Even better, toss it on top so you get the most bang for your buck. P.S. The directions are too cumbersom. Saute your onions and garlic, add the chopped vetegables, cook until the level of tenderness you desire, season and serve. It's that easy - it's supposed to be a rustic dish. Let's keep it that way.

I was cooking ratatouille in advance for the upcoming week along with sunday evening dinner for a friend at the same time. After the meal, I had extra white corn sauteed in milk. As a joke (he is a great cook) I dumped the extra corn on top of the cooling ratatouille just as a contrasting garnish... the next evening i was surprised at how the little bit of corn on top added sweetness and flavor to my vegetable stew. I am going to make it a standard garnish from now on (heresy I know LOL.)

My sis and i tried dif recipes ..i chose this "complicated" one & mine was better by far. only thing i did dif was only used the amount of oil necesarry TO "lube" the veggies. worth frying veg 1 by 1

nanopanko from Milwaukee, WI has made this a great recipe. I too am from Milwaukee, WI Born & Raised...but I roasted the veggies, but also tried like in the Disney movie..it looked so pretty. I sliced all the veggies & roasted them the oven with all the lovely aromatic ingredients!! It was fantastic

I made ratatouille yesterday, but followed Cook's Illustrated's ecipe more closely- oven roasting the zucchini and eggplant really helps deepen flavors and maintain texture so you don't have soggy mush!

I followed this recipe exactly, and in the end what I got was a bunch of mushy vegetables. This recipe is way to time consuming, and I thought it was costly. If you are looking to make a great ratatouille, look for another recipe!

The kids that I nanny for help me cook dinner one night a week. One of them hates pretty much every vegetable-- especially creepy colored ones like eggplant and zucchini :o) They chose to make this recipe for a French themed dinner because we saw the movie Ratatoille and they loved it! It was my first experience making ratatouille, but I figure if it's a recipe kids can help make and then love because they helped, it's worth the time and effort! We will be feeding them their vegetables this way again!

Forgot to say - I used 1/2 red onion, 1/2 yellow onion.

I also made modifications to this overly complicated recipe as per the other reviewers: I consider this an easy three stage recipe, as folows: one, make the sauce; two, at same time, cook the onions and sequentially chop and add/cook the rest of the vegetables and oil, salt, pepper to taste; and three, add the sauce to the vegetables and simmer, and adjust the seasonings. For tomatoes I used one cann of peeled plum tomatoes and small can of tomato paste; six cloves of garlild, ev olive oil and tomato, basil, and oregano; simmer 30 mins and break up tomatoes. I adjusted the spices during the final simmering by adding salt & pepper, bay leaf, thyme, liberal quantities of red wine, and 1-2 tsp sugar. Husband LOVED it!! I wiould make it again, but my way.

I ignored the recipe - and closely followed the first reviewer's instructions, which made a very respectable ratatouille. She's "the man"!

I made incredible ratatouille last night (first time) without recipe but wanted to check with epicurious what I did was correct. The only vegetable I sauteed was red onion and garlic but I did salt and drain the eggplant. Threw the eggplant and onions/garlic in with peppers, courgettes, fresh tomatoes in Le Crueset pot and simmered with olive oil and 2 tins of peeled plum tomatoes and its juices. Added a bit of red wine, a bay leaf and lots of tomato paste and Herbs de Provence (twice as much as I would have thought). I also added a bit more olive oil towards the end of the cooking time. The texture and flavour is out of this world. So, no need to sautee anything but onions in my book! Husband loved it, has asked for this to be a staple.

Not only is this more complicated than classic ratatouille, the taste is way inferior. Check out the first reviewer's recipe.

Fabulous recipe! As for canned tomatoes, the real payoff for fresh produce is felt directly in this recipe - fresh, garden grown tomatoes, zucchini, bell peppers and basil shine in home made ratatouille. Don't skimp on the olive oil, garlic, basil, or the cooking time, you'll be surprised at how good it is.

Way too much oil! There are ways to simplify this dish. Too much work for vegetables in tomato sauce.

Rating: 0
The Better Homes and Gardens cookbook (the red and white plaid one) has a simple ratatouille recipe that I make all the time. It seems to be healthier, gives the option of using canned tomatoes, and it serves four rather than 8-10. However, it's very easy to double (or more). It's delicious no matter what temperature it is.

Agree with previous reviewers-this recipe is a bit complicated, and if I may say, for those who like nice and easy... I've used a recipe in the Betty Crocker cookbook that was easier and still delicious! I'm a Greek-American currently living in Greece, and can testify this is definitely a mediterranean recipe, most Greek cookbooks use LOTS OF OIL, and I usually adjust the recipe to using half the oil the cookbooks recommend, and it doesn't sacrifice any taste!

I thought this was great, the best ever but I did not cook it any more. I made it ahead up to the point where it was all combined, then stored it in the refrigerator. I took out the amount I neede, reheated it in the microwave and it was just right. I think the extra 30 minutes "stewing" would make it too mushy. It is great topped with shaved or grated cheese which melts while reheating.

Loved it!!!!!!!!!Recommend it to everyone who loves mediterranean food...

I agree wholeheartedly with the previous reviewer. What an oily mess! Also, I would use two small cans of diced tomatoes or, better yet, tomatoes with roasted garlic and basil already in the can. What could be easier? Technique-wise, though, the other reviewer has it just right. This recipe is needlessly fussy.

This recipe is needlessly complicated, and ultimately less tasty, than classic ratatouille, as taught at the Cordon Bleu cooking school in France, where I was lucky enough to attend a couple of classes. There is no need to cook all the vegetables separately or to use anywhere near this much oil. Start with about 2T oil, then add the vegetables one at a time, cooking gently, and ending with eggplant (which doesn't need presalting) and garlic. This recipe lacks tomato paste, a critical ingredient, and also needs a tablespoon of sugar, a bay leaf, and thyme. There is no need to precook the tomatoes. Just add them to the pot. You can finish cooking it on top of the stove, but it is best if you put a piece of buttered parchment paper, cut to fit, atop the vegetables before covering the pot and putting it in a moderate oven for an hour or so.
