I had two issues with this recipe, maybe someone could help me out. 1. The salt mixture would not adhere to the chicken on the sides and wings. it fell off in slabs and I kept having to work with it. maybe it was too dry of a mixture and needed more egg whites. 2. I cooked a 5lb chicken for 80minutes and the thigh registered 170 degrees however, while carving, the breast was very raw on the inside. obviously it needed more time but I thought the thigh took the longest time and i would be safe. anyway the cooked portions were very delicious so its worth trying again.

Yes, it was juicy. And the flavor was good. And it was cool to try a new way to roast a chicken. I used rosemary, lemon and garlic in the cavity and added some cayenne to the salt. The flavors came through nicely. But... it wasn't any better than my usual roast chicken that doesn't call for all those egg whites and all that salt. And the appearance was off-putting after breaking away the salt (which was fun). Soggy, raw looking skin is not something I'd want a guest to see. This was definitely a one-off.

I had a slew of leftover egg whites thanks to creme brulee making and I stumbled upon this recipe so I figured "Why not?" Easily one of the best roasted chickens I've ever tasted! Filled the cavity with thyme, rosemary and lemons, sprinkled additional dried thyme on the skin before crusting with the salt. I imagine you could play with the flavor profile with any herbs/spices you prefer. It took me all of 5 - 10 mins to prep this and when it was done, it was succulent, juicy and perfectly salted without having to brine or anything! I'm pretty sure I overcooked this because I totally wasn't watching the time, but it was still marvelous! I'm never throwing out an extra egg white again! It's worth the cost of some extra salt and carton of egg whites to give this one a try...you won't be sorry!

Instead of using fresh egg whites which would waste or cause an extended day of cooking, maybe pasturized egg whites could be used...?

This was really good. Nice and moist, easy, and tasty. I used the herbs that I had on hand, thyme and parsley, with a bit of lemon. I think that you could use less egg whites, and add a bit of water for the salt mixture, which does form a nice dome over the chicken. I used a 5lb bird that was finished in 70 minutes.

I suppose you could make zabaglione with all of those leftover egg yolks...

Also have not tried this recipe. Just wondering if using so much salt and egg whites can possibly be worth the end result. 7 cups of kosher salt? 18 egg whites? For 1 chicken? Seems wasteful. Just thinking out loud...

Havent tried it, but do wonder how you find the thickest part of the thigh under all that salt crust.

This chicken was truly delicious, so juicy (even the breast) that there wasn't a shred left on the table. I didn't have marjoram or tarragon so I used parsley and thyme and a few lemon slices--divine. Will add to our monthly rotation for sure.
