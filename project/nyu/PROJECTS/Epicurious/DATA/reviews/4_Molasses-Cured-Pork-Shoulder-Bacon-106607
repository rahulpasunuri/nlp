delicious. My first home-made bacon experience. A winner. I brined the shoulder for three days. A bit on the salty side. What would you expect. Didn't use Instacure. I cold smoked over wood fire for four hours. Good smoke penetration.

Wow! This is easy and delicious. I made per the recipe. I used apple sawdust in my offset smoker. It is a delicious cross between bacon and great country style ham. Highly recommended.
