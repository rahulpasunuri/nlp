Missing part is: "In a blender purée adobo and remaining olive oil in a thin stream. Stir purée into salsa and transfer to a jar with a tight-fitting lid." I made this for my parents 50th Wedding Anniversary party in California - 3 years ago. To this day I get requests for it.

This is a poorly written recipe. The rest of the 1/3 cup of olive oil never materializes. The recipe indicates one should puree all the ingredients used at one point, then add them to the "salsa." I ended up making a salsa from the tomato, cilantro, lime and green peppers, then pureeing only a little of the other ingredients and adding it to the salsa. Pureeing the whole amount of the other ingredients would take away from the hearty appearance and color of the dish.

i think there's an error in the recipe ... it doesn't explain what you're supposed to puree in the blender and what you mix that into. I mixed everything together then pureed a cup of the mixture in the blender and stirred the puree back into the remaining salsa. Tastes quite nice.
