Simmer potatoes in a small amount of milk instead of covering with water? Why have the hassle of worrying about the milk burning and the potatoes being covered? This technique certainly didn't add any flavor to the dish which I found to be pretty one dimensional.

this is one pretty potato side, the green peas and soft red skins makes for a pretty compliment to most entrees. although red potatoes are not generally the best type for mashing, as they have a lower starch content than most, i didn't have a problem with them in this recipe. i would recommend boiling them for at least 12 min rather than the suggested 8. make sure to use good quality butter and this dish is fine without additional seasonings. the flavor of the peas, potatoes and scallions were simple and a perfect pairing with the cornflake fried chicken.

Following the recipe exactly I found it a little bit bland. I added some garlic powder, salt, and black pepper. Then I added a bit of cream cheese and sour cream to make it a bit more creamy. Then it was quite good and a nice change of pace from my other mashed potato recipes.

Although this was quick, easy and straight forward, I found it a bit bland. I will try it again, but will add thyme as a similar recipe for smashed potatoes and peas on this site called for. Then I might try adding cooked bacon. Not overwhelming, but a basic worth trying again with a few tweaks.
