I thought the sauce was delicious, and the sandwiches had a lot of potential. To me, the fresh mozz was over powered by the sauce a little bit and so it didn't quite have that punch of flavor. I'll definitely make it again, though. I made one for my son with shredded mozz and pepperoni and then put it in the toaster oven.

Something was definitely missing from these sandwiches: Pineapple! You cannot have a delicious pizza without pineapple hence you cannot have a delicious pizza sandwich without pineapple.

I thought they sounded like something would be missing, so I added extra garlic, oregano and red pepper flakes to the spread. Also used fresh basil leaves instead of arugula and I placed a slice of fresh tomato in each sandwich. They were a hit! Easy and tasty.

The sauce for this recipe is excellent. The leftover sauce was wonderful on pizza and other sandwiches. The sandwiches, as listed, were okay. I felt like something was missing.
