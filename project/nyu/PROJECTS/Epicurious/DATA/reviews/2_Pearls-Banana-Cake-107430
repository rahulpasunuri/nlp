i found the cake to be a bit dry and plain tasting. i doubled the frosting, which made more than enough. not a very interesting dessert, i will not make again.

The bananas on my tree are all ripening at the same time, so I've been making banana recipes all week. This is the one I enjoyed most. The cake it self was a light and perfect texture. The combination of bananas and whipped cream is glorious. Next time, and there definitely will be a next time, I will triple the measurements for the icing (whipped cream). I can't imagine how anyone got by with as litte icing as called for in this recipe. It's too good to be skimpy.
