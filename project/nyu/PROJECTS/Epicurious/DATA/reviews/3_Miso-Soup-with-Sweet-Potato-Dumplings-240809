I don't know why, but I couldn't get into this one. I liked the dumplings, but I felt like their flavor overpowered the miso soup. Maybe the soup would have benefited from dashi broth? I used a mixture of veggie broth and water. I also used red miso, because I had that one hand. It wasn't bad, it just seemed like something was off.

This is my perfect comfort food. it's the best on a cold night, when you have the sniffles. it also doesn't pack nearly as many calories or fat as your usual comfort foods. the dumplings got kind of messy because I couldn't close them all the way, but it didn't effect how good it was. I thought the soup was perfect, but I replaced the bean sprouts (my boyfriend would never touch it then) with carrots and celery, and that may have added a little extra flavor. the only thing is that this is a pretty time consuming recipe, so I don't have the time to make it as much as I'd like. :(

Made this last night for a dinner party, and it was a hit! I've had this soup at Green Zebra, and while I'm sure mine didn't turn out as well as theirs, it was pretty darn good! I added the white miso to good-quality vegetable broth, which really punched up the flavor. I also cooked the sweet potatoes in the microwave to save on time. And the open dumplings added to the visual charm of the dish. I'd double up on them next time, as everyone wanted seconds.

I made this recipe the other night, it was easy enough but somehow it took longer than I imagined-somehow an hour had passed like nothing. I didnt bother oven roasting the potatoes, I microwaved them and frankly I doubt the difference would have been noticeable. My husband liked it more than I did, I am japanese, if I ever make this again I will definitely use brown miso instead of shiro (white)

This dish was delicious, and I would certainly make it again. I sealed my dumplings with a few drops of water, and they held up perfectly. I tweaked the soup a little by adding soy sauce and extra miso to the recipe until it tasted right. I would love to experiment with different soup bases- it would be wonderful with a yellow coconut curry, or a slightly sour mushroom broth. Next time I will probably add more veggies to the soup, and cut down the cooking time so they stay crunchy.

For those of you that believe the soup is bland, I have made this the perfect recipe. Each item is extremely important to the end result: 1) I used Miso Master Organic - Mellow White from Central Market. Drop 3 ROUNDED tablespoons of it into the water. If you add up how much miso I added, it may come up to about 3.5 tablespoons. 2) Even after the rounded tablespoons, the broth was definitely missing something. I added one Knorr Vegetable Bouillion to the miso soup. Add a little sprinkle of pepper and maybe a little sprinkle of salt. Perfect! 3) For the sweet potato, my shallot was a big piece not a measly size shallot. That makes the dumpling very tasty. So make sure when you saute shallot with the garlic the shallot has to be big. Maybe the size of a gigantic jawbreaker?

Great taste and very good for you. We make this all the time and it always turns out great.

Yum, had friends over for a dumpling soup party. This made it all go very quickly, with changes that others suggested: prepared the dumplings closed, used veggie stock for the miso broth and added soy sauce to taste. With all the extra hands, the cooking went by fast! Everyone enjoyed the soup and someone even ended up making it again the next week

As everyone else noted, the wontons were wonderful - especially when fried in sesame oil. Will definitely make the wontons again...will stay away from the soup. By the way, I made the soup with veggie stock and red miso paste and it was just ok.

White miso is very mild...I'm going to try this recipe tonight with red miso. Will review afterwards.

As was, this was pretty bland. The dumplings, as everyone else noted, were FANTASTIC, but the miso soup was horrible. When I first saw this I was quite confused at noting a broth made solely from miso and water. Next time, I think I'll make it the traditional Japanese way by making a dashi stock out of kombu seaweed and bonito flakes, and I'd suggest anyway making this to do the same.

The soup I could take or leave, but the dumplings I will make again and again. I fried some leftover filling in wonton wrappers in coconut oil the next morning, and the crunch around that delicious filling was even better! Try a dipping sauce of peanut thai sauce, honey, and sweet chili sauce.

Yum, yum and yum!! One of our new favs. I completely closed the dumplings which made them hold up much better. Really good and good for you soup.

I only made the dumplings and they were yummy. I added a little minced ginger with the garlic and shallot, closed the dumplings at the top, and steamed them. they have a kick to them with the red peppers, and the potato gives it a surprisingly nice texture.

so good....I pan fried a few of the wontons and added those on the side...

Quick and easy recipe for a weeknight meal. I closed up the wontons and added ginger to the potatoe mixture as others recommended. The vegetables needed some salt, so I'd recommend either fish sauce or just a little salt added at the end. To save some time, I just microwaved the potato instead of baking it which didnt seem to affect the final product.

Wonderful! Went over super well at my friend's "Soup Buffet" party. The only caution: Make sure you're getting the super bright orange sweet potatoes. I didn't pay attention and mine I picked up a pale yellow color. Very delicious, but not as pretty as the picture.

I agree with previous reviewers-- the dumplings are amazing (and yes, I did close them), but the soup is so- so. I'm going to make a batch of the dumplings to serve with a dipping sauce this weekend.

Although I am a fan of miso, I did not like the miso broth in this soup. I think it would be better with a solid chicken or veggie broth. I added way more miso than called for and it sill lacked a considerable amout of flavor. The dumplings were really good.

I followed the recipe almost exactly (added a little ginger to the potatoes) and it was a huge hit. Do close the tops of the dumplings- they are the best part. Easy and delicious.

While preparing this recipe, I discovered too late that I didn't have any miso. So, I used chicken broth and flavored it with garlic, onion and ginger which I also added to the sweet potato dumplings. It was a big hit!

The dumplings fell apart and were too difficult to eat with the soup. Plus, I thought the flavors contrasted in an unappealing way - the dumplings being too sweet. Shrimp dumplings would be much better. Also, I would close them, I wouldn't shape them into little baskets as the recipe says. Overall this was too much work and too little satisfaction.

Personally I found this soup rather bland. However, The potato filling is delicious and I might consider doing the dumplings as a stand-alone dish.

I didn't make the dumplings like they said because I didn't believe they would be workable, so I folded them over into double triagles. It tasted great and everyone liked the soup.

The trick to this recipe is to have a large enough pan to accommodate the dumplings...they will indeed try to stick to each other. Nutrition foodies will love it, it's packed with rich veggies, and the colors are very presentable. Worth a shot, for a weeknight meal in my opinion.

The mix for the dumplings is great, but I could not cook them as recommended. They stick together and are unworkable.
