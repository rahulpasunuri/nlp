We really enjoyed this soup however I was rushed and did not read the reviews I asked my husband to pick up the 4lbs of Kale. I will make this again but will try some of the suggestions made here but found the base soup to be quite good.

Super easy to make. I did like the others - put ton of basil, oregano and thyme. Used Swiss chard, beans and lentils and used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and no pasta. I did not use any frozen veggies; used fresh ones instead. Love it!

Loved this recipe, but made a few changes. Added 2.5 oz of Beech mushrooms, 2-1 lb frozen Mediterrean vegetable mix(instead of 1 lb frozen Italian), 1 32 oz vegetable stock and 1 32 oz chicken stock (instead of 51/2 cup chicken broth), added 1 cup of diced red skin yellow flesh potatoes, added 1 tsp of basil and oregano. Served with Asiago cheese bread. Superb. My family ate it up!!!!

This is a great starter recipe for Italian vegetable soup on a week night that I have changed slightly for better results. I omit the pasta and beans and use red lentils instead, which makes for a hearty yet healthy substitution. I also prefer to have a little bit of meat in my soup, so I use either rotisserie chicken pulled off the bone or ground turkey that I brown along with the onion and garlic. I think I'll also take another reviewer's suggestion and add some fresh carrots and celery since I have those laying around in my fridge. Adding some Italian seasoning also helps bring out the flavor. Definitely heed the warnings about the kale - 4 lbs is way too much.

A great tasting soup. Like an earlier poster, I added a tablespoon each of oregano and basil. I also used additional chicken stock in place of the water. I forgot to buy the frozen italian vegetables, and used a full head of escarole in their place. (No kale at the grocery store.) I used a 1/4 c less pasta, and if I make this soup again, I may leave it out entirely. The ditalini expanded too much and made it into sort of a stew. Otherwise, highly recommended for a hearty, easy soup.

In the October 2006 Gourmet magazine, the orginal recipe reads, "4 oz. prewashed and cut kale (6 cups)." The previous poster is certainly correct; 4 pounds of kale is WAY too much!

4 pounds kale?!?!? you must be mistaken? i subbed with only 2 pounds of collard greens and lordy did i have WAY TOO MUCH stuff and not enough liquid for the recipe as written. i ended up using 2 qts of stock plus some extra water to help out and a large 28 ounce can of tomatoes. granted, i also used 2 1# bags of frozen veggies but i'm glad i did b/c otherwise i would have had greens soup! definitely bland so expect to spice it up to your taste - we found Tabasco sauce helped it alot. i might make it again but with some major adjustments.

I just made this and it is delish! Definitely agree with a previous reviewer that the addition of white wine (I used white vermouth which I prefer) makes all the difference - it adds another layer to the flavour. Decided to forgo the frozen veg for potato, carrot, zucchini and green beans. I used baby spinach but think something heartier like kale would be better. I also added about 1/2 cup freshly grated parm and a 4" piece of parm rind. Fresh thyme added a nice note. Easy peezy!

I intertwined this recipe with the winter minestrone recipe. I added 1 cup of carrots, 1 cup celery, and swiss chard instead of kale (because swiss chard tastes soo good!). I also added 1 T of oregano and thyme. It was soo good! It's healthy but it took me 2 hours to cut everything up and cook it.

I have used this recipe for the last two years and have enjoyed it. It's a great jumping off place for soup making. I tweak here and there. Some are better than others, but play with it and find out what you like!

This is a great basic recipe but I found that I had to wake the flavor up a little with added spices. I used Penzeys Italian spice blend and extra tomatoes. I also added a parmesean cheese rind to the pot. I didn't use any water, I substitued chicken broth for the water for extra flavor.I imagine vegetable broth would be a good substitute for the chicken broth but I wouldn't use water alone for the soup base.

I made some adjustments I used the what I had on-hand. I did not have kale so I used an organic spinach that I had in the freezer; it was perfect. I had fresh zucchini, carrots, celery, and elbow macaroni, but also added a small diced Russet potato. Since there are two of us we had it for lunch the next day. My prep time was more than 10 minutes because I added fresh vegetables.

This is a week-night fave. I just make a few minor adjustments: I use 6 cloves of garlic instead of four, saute carrots with the onions and garlic, don't use the beans, and use fresh instead of frozen veggies (zucchini tonight). The other thing I do is make a paste of a mashed clove of raw garlic and some salt and add it to the pot right before serving. YUM!

I used fresh veggies and substitued baby spinach for the kale. I sauteed the veggies in the onions and garlic with white wine then added the tomatoes and broth. It came out delicious but it was a litle bland, so I added hot pepper flakes to spice it up it up a bit.

Like this soup very much!!!! However, first time I made it, I got a chicken broth from Whole Foods, that was bland and tasteless. The next time I made it with Swanson's reduced sodium chicken broth, it was 100 percent better!!! I put a chicken bone, and a parmesan rind in when it was simmering, (about 30 minutes.) I used fresh squash and zucchini instead of frozen. Crucial to this dish is a GOOD canned chicken broth.

We make this recipe about 3 times/month. It makes a ton, so we sometimes freeze part of it. It's hearty and filling and makes a complete meal. Super easy to make, too. Like many of the reviewers, we add more liquid than the recipe calls for. Sometimes I add more broth; sometimes, I just add more water. We also use whatever pasta we have on hand. Can't mess this recipe up really.

absolutely delicious! a few changes, i only added 1/2 the amount of spinach (didn't have kale). i used frozen spinach to make it even easier. i also added more salt and 1/2 tsp of oregano and basil as it was a bit bland. will definitely make again - the whole family enjoyed, even the picky one!

Quite good. Substituted fresh baby spinach for the kale. Was a bit bland until I added more salt which brought the flavors out nicely.

My roommates nearly lost their minds when I served this up. Serve with baggette, manicotti shells stuffed with Italian sweet sausage (fresh from the Italian store/deli, if possible) and some rose vino with a few scoops of spumoni as a finishing touch. I wouldn't substitute the chicken broth for just water but if so, add a boullion cube. Also, I added sea salt to the stock as it boiled to cut the kale and give the base flavor. Do it while cooking and at intervals until meets your taste. Roommates didn't reach for any shakers. Bon Appetit!

I really enjoyed this. I loved the addition of kale in the soup and would make this again. I added way more stock as I think when it sat it got too thick.

Does anyone out there think that water can be substituted for chicken broth and have the result still taste like minestrone? I try to make soups using only a water base, which is possible with some soups but not with others. Thanks.

Considering the minimal work involved, this was quite tasty. I will certainly come back to it.

Even quicker if you use frozen kale or spinach. This is a great winter standby for lunch or a light supper. Some good bread and a quality imported parmesan to grate over it make it a complete meal and delicious meal.

Fast & Easy, Hearty & Delicious. I used collards instead of kale. I love this soup!

This was so quick, and with grated parmesan added at the table, and some whole grain bread, made a full meal. All it needed to bring out the flavor was some more salt. A box of frozen, chopped kale would make it even quicker.

My wife and I could barely finish a bowl, because it was so bland. The broth needs herbs or something to take on flavor and impart it to the vegetables. The yield was way more than four servings, which was unfortunate, because we didn't enjoy it.
