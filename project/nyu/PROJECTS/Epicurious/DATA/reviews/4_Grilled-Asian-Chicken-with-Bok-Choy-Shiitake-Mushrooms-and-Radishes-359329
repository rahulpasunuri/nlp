This was okay. It was a lot of work for a so-so payoff. I probably won't make it again.

Really did not like this recipe. I didn't think the flavors went together well and the sauce was cloyingly sweet. It seemed like an odd match for the bok choy and radishes. Would not make again.

Great meal, but it takes longer to cook on the grill than recipe suggests - 20 minutes for vegetables, 30 minutes for the chicken if you do 10 minutes direct, 20 minutes indirect to get to 155 degrees.

Great combination of flavors with the charcoal. I served it with brown basmati rice studded with pine nuts, and it was a complete meal. I will brush the vegetables heavily rather than lightly with the sauce the next time, especially the bok choi. I added a little soy sauce to the sauce. If I make the cold salad, I will add peanuts and cilantro.

Wow, beautiful outcome and the dressing is great on salad for lunch the next day with grilled veggies. Used my Williams-Sonoma grill basket and vegetables came out perfect (grilled onions first, alone, for a good 10 minutes, followed by other veg). Spooned about 1/2 cup of finished dressing back into mini processor with several chunks of mango (from frozen bagged mango - Trader Joe's) which thickened the dressing & made it extra rich for topping the finished veggies. Served this as a side with Cider- Glazed Lamb Chops, terrific pairing. Hubby and guests were impressed!

Excellent, healthy and delicious.

Just made this recipe and it was awesome! Since it's winter and too cold to grill, I broiled the chicken and veggies in the oven, per another reviewer's advice. It was amazing! This dish is light and refreshing. Served with plain white rice. My 13- year old loved it. Tomorrow I will try to make the chicken noodle salad. Mango dressing tastes amazing...it was not spicy or heavy. You only need to drizzle a little bit of dressing when serving food as it adds tons of flavor. Can't wait to make this on the grill in summer. Bok choy and radishes (which I don't normally like) were fabulous! Definitely a keeper!!

This was very delicious. The dressing is particularly fab. I found it a little strange to BBQ Bok Choy. Be careful to baste the greens before grilling else they will brown and taste quite bitter. I found my grill space at a premium for this recipe and had to do things in batches. The radishes were finicky to get on and off grill without dropping between the grates. The dressing really makes the whole thing. I too used less oil, half rice wine vinegar half apple cider vinegar and accidentally used way too much soy. It still tasted great.

Easy and delicious! I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts. They worked fine. I also forgot the red onion and used yellow. No problem. I couldn't find the specific brand of mango chutney, so I used another. Great combination of veggies. I also made the cilantro rice. Great with chicken. The mango dressing is excellent.

This is a great recipe. I made it pretty close to as written, but reduced the oil by 50% in the mango dressing per earlier reviewers. Good call. I had to be a little stingy with the dressing to save some for the noodle salad. Next time I would still reduce the oil in the sauce, but make 50% more. The sauce is killer. I'm trying to figure out what else to use it on. Perhaps on a bruschetta with thin slices of beef or lamb and grilled onions? Don't be afraid of the radishes, even if you don't like them raw. They transform when grilled.

I made the Grilled Asian Chicken with Boy Choy etc the first night which was very good, but even better was the Later in the Week Asian Chicken Noodle Salad with Snap Peas using the leftover chicken! It was a wonderful quick dinner for a warm summer night and tasted phenomenal with the udon noodles and left over sauce! I will be making this again this summer!

Great presentation, very tasty. Easy to make. Didn't know what Mr. Soandso's chuney was, so for the dressing I threw in the meat from one mango, and one apricot just because it was sitting there next to the mango (huh?). Anyway, it turned out great! Leftover grilled veggies were great on sandwiches.

This was delicious. I couldn't find boneless breasts with skin on so I just used bone-in thighs. I was totally suprised that I liked the radishes. After tasting the sauce, which was good to begin with, I added a little grated fresh ginger and liked the sauce even better.

Loved it! I made the dressing as stated in the recipe, and it turned out perfectly! The vegetables were wonderful, especially the bok choy. Instead of chicken breasts I used chicken thighs, and they worked very well.

I really did not care for this dish. The dressing did not taste right. I ate two bites and the rest went in the garbage. Will never make this again.

Rain halted the grilling, but the broiler worked well, so consider this recipe for winter cooking. When converting this to indoor cooking be vigilant about removing excess moisture from the pans to keep the veggies crisp. I also split the skinless, boneless chicken breasts so they would cook faster and have more surface area for the glaze. I cut the oil in the sauce to about half and added more hot pepper flakes. The result was great but I used all the sauce without any for leftovers, so adjust accordingly. Served simply over white Basmati rice it was a tasty dinner enjoyed by my very spoiled and picky boys!

This was great as everyone said. The dressing was delicious amd so were the grilled veggies. I used baby portabellas instead of shitake and left out the radishes as they do nothing for me. The next day I took the leftover chicken, veggies and dressing and had a fabulous Asian salad. Also added the Cilantro rice, which was amazing as well!

I agree with everyone else that this recipe is damn near perfect - it was absolutely delicious, easy and adaptable - however, I also agree with a previous reviewer that you can reduce the oil by about half or so and not miss it (as written, the dressings for the chicken/veg and the cilantro rice are both a bit oily-feeling). We also used skinless chicken breasts instead and sub'd (to avoid a trip to the store) homemade hot pepper chutney for the mango (I know, big change, but it worked!) and used regular white mushrooms. The dressings on both the chicken/veg and rice really make everything taste exceptional.

This turned out great. Skipped radishes and added peach and mango to the grill array, which were delicious. The dressing is easy and yummy, but I cannot see how or why you would need the amount of oil recommended. I used a third of it and it was perfect.

I agree with every glowing review of this dish. I would only add that a grill basket makes life much easier, as the veggies cooked down much more than I had expected. And the boneless, skinless chicken breast was perfect. Although the recipe says to expect leftovers, we had none - a good sign!

This dressing is great. I used it on baby bok choy and asparagus, and loved it. I tweaked it just slightly by adding a bit more vinegar, chili flakes and soy, to taste. Looking forward to trying it on a noodle salad.

Used a mango chutney with less added sugar (check the label on major grey...). absolutely delicious dressing. We had a "disaster" - grill suddenly not working - so had to broil the chicken and roast the veggies in the oven. Recipe still tasted great. The mango-sesame dressing makes it: that dressing is definitely a keeper.

I made this for Sunday dinner tonight. The mango-sesame dressing was so good that I could have eaten just that for dinner! The only changes I made was I used boneless skinless breasts and because I couldn't find shiitakes, I substituted portobello mushrooms. I too thought grilled radishes would be weird but they were de-lish! I made the cilantro-ginger rice as well and the whole meal was a five-star winner according to my family. It was super- colourful and sooo yummy. I will absolutely make this again. It's great Sunday dinner but is also spectacular enough to serve to guests.

My household is mixed vegetarian and non-veg. I made with tofu and chicken breasts. Everyone was happy. The only thing - i would double the amount of veggies next time. They were a big hit. They seem like a lot when you cut them up but obviously they cook down a lot.

Made this last night and it was fantastic. The dressing is delicious. Used a grill pan on the bbq so as to not lose the tiny (local) shiitake mushrooms. Thought grilled radishes were strange - but actually quite yummy. Would definitely make this again.

The mango sesame dressing is what makes this dish fantastic, and it certainly would be fantastic with grilled salmon as well. The dish is terrific for summer because everything can fit on the grill with ease. I also made the ginger cilantro rice with it, which was fabulous. I certainly will make this again!

this recipe was fantastic. we loved it. it looked gorgeous on the platter, we made the salad already too and had it the next day as a side dish. the salad needs alot of dressing but great. i will surely make again.

I made this today and it was delicious - we are looking forward to the noodle salad later in the week. The baby bok choy was particularly good - I didn't have shiitake mushrooms or radishes so we just did without, but there was plenty. I also could not get boneless skin-on breasts and used a mix of boneless breasts and thighs, which worked well

I made this tonight and it was absolutely fabulous.I did make some changes. I used skinless boneless breasts and they were great and moist and the mango sesame dressing gave them a nice glaze. I didn't use the radishes--cooked radishes seemed odd to me and I am lukewarm on radishes anyway--but I did peel and cut up one sweet potato and cooked that along with the other vegies and it worked well. Our grill is not well so I did all of the cooking in the oven on hot with 3 rows of large cookie sheets. I basted with the sauce and transferred the pans.Cooked it hot at 400. I also made the cilantro rice and it all was very good. I will definately make this again. I think Pacific salmon would work really well in this recipe.

We loved this and can't wait to make it again. I couldn't find baby bok choy, but there was still plenty of food without it. Served this with the cilantro sesame rice (also delicious).

This is a great great dish (the dressing really makes it), but there are a few logistical problems to solve with the veggies. Though the recipe suggests putting all those veggies on the grill, I was able to recognize early that my grilling skills are not up to the task of managing that many tiny pieces of food over an open flame. Instead, I broiled, which worked out pretty well. Next time, I am considering cutting up the veggies into slightly smaller pieces and putting them into a grill-wok. 2nd issue: not sure how to make the bok choi cooked all the way through but not withered at the tops. I couldn't get baby bok choi and went with a large bok choi instead, so maybe this was part of the problem. The upside is that the bok choi still tasted good, the problem was mostly visual. Another side note: I didn't use boneless skin-on chicken breasts due to convenience, but I bet skin on would have been good. The dressing-glaze caramelizes really nicely on the chicken, and I bet the skin would be an interesting component in that mix.
