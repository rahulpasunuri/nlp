I had high hopes for this recipe but, as written, it is too bland. The principal problem is the broth base. It desperately needs some kicking up. I made it a second time and added a bunch of chopped green onions, which helped a lot, along with a small sprinkle of red pepper flakes. That helped but next time I am going to experiment with some ginger or, perhaps, a few teaspoons of hoisin. Bottom line is work on the broth.

this is a tasty and light dinner that's really easy and quick to make. the aioli is perhaps a lot to make for using only a few teaspoons, but it was tasty in the dish.
