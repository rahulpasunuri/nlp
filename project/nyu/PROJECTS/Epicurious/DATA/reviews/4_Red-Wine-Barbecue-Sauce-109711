This is a good and very easy to throw together recipe for people who do not like the sweet store-bought bbq sauces. However, as written, I thought it was kind of boring. Taking the suggestions of another reviewer I doubled the wine, added about 1 tbs of maple syrup and worcestershire each and simmered the sauce longer. I also omitted the liquid smoke because I'm not a big fan of it. Served it on a tri tip roast and everyone really enjoyed it. With the changes I would definitely make this again.

Very good and also very quick. Good flavor for such a quick sauce and, yes, it is glorified catsup but isn't that what bbq sauce is.

As written, it was rather like glorified ketchup. After tweeking: I doubled the wine and reduced it to give it a richer flavor and I added at least 1teaspoon of the spices, 1T worcestershire sauce and 2t maple syrup. Really was excellent and will make it again

I thought this was ok. Just ok. It tasted like doctored ketchup, which is basically what it was. On the plus side, though, it was super quick to make. I think, though, I prefer the concentrated intense taste of red wine that has been significantly reduced.

Used a leftover bottle of Shiraz. Skipped the cumin and clove and added just a teaspoon of brown sugar and a small shallot instead. Marinated some steaks for about an hour in this sauce and threw them on the grill. This was amazing and I will be making this again.

Wow, this was great. I substituted cayenne for the chipolte powder and omitted the liquid smoke. We put it both on chicken and hamburgers. Even better the next day. And so great that it doesn't need sugar.

This is a really good recipe. I'll try a bit less cider vinegar next time. I added 1 tbsp dark brown sugar. I did not have any liquid smoke, so I'll try that next time as well. Ths is quick and easy and tasty!

I made this without the liquid smoke and it was great. So easy to make, it was perfect for a quick weeknight meal. Visit http://joleneeatshere.blogspot.com for pics and details.

I have made this for a 3rd time now - this time with barbecue beef ribs. I have made a few minor alterations to suit my spicy palate. I used canned chipotles in adobo sauce that I diced up, added a little worchestershire sauce, and some crushed red pepper. This kicks it up a notch. I highly recommend this bbq sauce.

This is an amazing and very versatile sauce. It gets rave reviews everytime I make it and it goes well with beef, pork, ribs, you name it. It's so easy to make and suprisingly healthy because there's no sugar in it like most BBQ sauces.

I've made this sauce 2-3 times now and it always gets rave reviews. People were dipping crackers into it! As others have said, not a lot of work, but really worth the results.

Excellent flavor! I'll make this again and again. It only takes a couple minutes, too.

Delightful! Added Chipotle Smoked Tabasco in place of liquid smoke and it was fantastic

Fabulous - this was so easy - we just grilled steaks with it. What a flavor! What make s it better is that it is all ingredients we always have on hand. I am looking forward to grilling with pork tenderloin.

Great BBQ sauce. Made it to go with Tri-tip and it elevated the good (but not great) tri tip recipe. Next time, I'll double (or triple) the recipe and marinate and cook the meat in this sauce. Note: I didn't have Chipotle powder, so I used a Chipotle hot sauce and some crushed red pepper flakes.

I tripled the recipe for 2 big tri tips and to have some left over. I thought it was a bit too tangy (vinegary) so I added some dark brown sugar and then another splash of the zinfandel to taste. Fantastic!

??? The carb free diet may have affected your senses. This was not a favorite and won't be in the near future. I used liquid smoke with hickory and that may have been the mistake. Regardless, this recipe was disappointing after reading the reviews. Preparation was very simple.

This sauce is amazing. I literally ate it with a spoon. Haven't even gotten round to putting it on anything yet...lovely as a drink though.

This is fabulous!! I am so glad I found this recipe! I usually add stuff and change it a bit as most chefs do. Not this time. I followed it exactly. It is a little spicy (which I love but not everyone does) by itself. But when you put it on the meat it calms down and is just right. My family came to visit for New Years and I made this and put it on brisket. Everyone loved it! Even my Grandfather who can't eat spicy stuff gave it rave reviews! I will make this recipe from now on when I have a BBQ. Definatley a keeper here!!

This is a quick and fantastic barbecue. Baste it on the meat for a real tasty dinner.

This is the best sauce, the power went out while I was preparing for a dinner party so prepared it in a saucepan on top of the grill and thats how I've prepared it every time since then. The tri tip and onions were also fabulous.

This sauce was incredible -- very flavorful and very aromatic. Incredibly easy to make. Went very well as a marinade and as a basting sauce. Wow!

A wonderfully flavorful accompaniment to the BBq tri-tip! I used a Zinfandel in the sauce and then served it alongside the tri-tip-excellent summer fare.
