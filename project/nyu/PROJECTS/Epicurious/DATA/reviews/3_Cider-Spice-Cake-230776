The cake was okay, nothing super special and barely tasted like cider, but pretty good. The problem is the frosting... it's basically eating butter! Gross. My guests were polite, but mostly didn't even eat the frosting. Wouldn't make it again.

I was a bit disappointed after all the work that goes into this recipe. The cake is fairly flat and a bit too bland for my taste but it is moist... add more spices and extra baking powder! The frosting is too buttery... next time for the frosting I would substitute brown sugar, and mix with the cider, & the corn starch on top of the stove, then poke holes in the cake and drizzle the mixture over the top of the cake. I would consider making it again with those changes.

Because my kids aren't frosting fans (????!) and because we wanted something quick for dessert, I made this in a 9x12 and skipped frosting. It doesn't rise much, but was moist and full of flavor; has a caramel undernote from the brown sugar. it's a good snack cake, and my picky kids both went back for seconds immediately.

Yummy cake! Not your typical, definitely on the heavy side, but my cake hating father liked it. Ramped up the spices some, but not tripled like some reviewers. Also cut back the butter in the frosting recipe, wished later I had added some powdered sugar for better texture. My advice to those considering this recipe, don't make it if you don't live in apple country. The cider needs to be the real thing.

well, I haven't tasted this cake yet, but the reveiws are kind of scary. I did change the frosting and thought that might help those out there, I am using a cream cheese frosting like that of a carrot cake, cream cheese a bit of butter and powdered sugar. its always yummy I just hope the cake turns out okay.

I recommand to add lemon zets and one cup apple sauce. and just cinamon... it came simple and great. I didnt even bothered with the icing. one more thing is to spread sugar to the pan

The cake was very flat, and the icing tasted mostly like butter. None of my guests wanted to try it. I asked some to give me an opinion, and they all said not to bother making it again.

I was disappointed with the texture of this cake. I added diced apple and walnuts and baked it in a bundt pan. It turned out very heavy. The flavor was OK, but I won't make it again without modifying the base recipe - possibly more flour and only 2 eggs as suggested by another reviewer.

I think this is a wonderful, delicate cake that I would make again. One reason for other readers' disappointment may be that the photo is somewhat deceptive. The cake is small so you need to scale down your expectations, but it is very rich. I made the layers in 7 inch pans, which did make them a bit higher, but they do not rise a great deal. The cake is very light and flavorful. The only other change I made was to use 2 cups of high quality butter intead of 2.5 for the icing - a little goes a long way.

Surprisingly delicious cake. I thought that the icing would be too sweet for my husband. Not so. I did use two drops of pure orange extract in the icing and it perked it up a notch. In fact, I recommend it.

ok i tried this and first off the cake did not rise all that much as a matter of fact, it was flat as a pancake. that being said, i collapsed the two pans of cake together to make one. the only saving grace was my own homemade buttercream frosting. fortunately i was able to disguise it well enough so no one even noticed that it was supposed to be a two layer cake. oh well. tasted ok, but won't do it again.

After selectively following love4vino's advice (I replaced 3/4 of the butter with unsweetened applesauce and tripled the spices), this recipe yielded one of the best spice cakes I have ever tasted. It was very moist and full of cider flavor. As for the frosting, I just whipped some cream with a little sugar and maple syrup. I also added minced crystalized ginger on the top and between the layers of the cake. Fantastic.

in my review below, I meant to refer to 1.5 cups of flour, not sugar

Rating: 1
First I suspected something was wrong when I saw the recipe called for only 1.5 cups of sugar and 3 eggs. I hadn't read the reviews (searching on this recipe by just 'cider' or just 'spice' didn't turn it up, it only came up under 'spice cake')but I knew that with so little flour the layers would be thin, so I made it in a bundt pan and baked it a few minutes longer. Still came out puny, but I was saved the frosting between layers, and I just made a glaze out of brown sugar, vanilla, butter, and a little heavy cream (glaze was yummy). Cake itself wasn't spicy enough (and on my own I'd already added extra including some ginger) and I didn't like the texture at all, lots of air holes (due to the 3 eggs I'm sure, and I DID rap the pan on the counter) and not moist enough. Flavor and texture was slightly better 2nd day, but not enough. There are many better spice cake recipes out there.

I really liked this cake. Like many other reviewers, I doubled the recipe and so had four generous 9 inch layers. I made a three-layer cake and a one-layer cake. I think the buttercream was just fine but it may be because I used a very high quality, unpasturized, organic, just-off-the-farm-truck cider. And I frosted the cakes sparingly, just a little between the layers and piped out swirls on the top. The cake itself was great--very moist in my case. I live in a large religious community so I just left them out on the counter one Sunday afternoon and 15 minutes later they were gone, even the crumbs. I had no complaints, only requests for more, so it's on the menu for Thanksgiving. Again, I think the cider made the difference.

I really enjoyed this cake and think the buttercream was great, too. The cider made a great addition and my coworkers that I made it for (at a cafe & caterer that also houses a mini-bakery)all raved about it.

Absolutely loved it!!! Made cupcakes & a 9" cake out of it. Easy to make cake; nice to have an alternative to the complicated & time consuming process of Italian Buttercream.

I guess this was the recipe for this year ... despite its shortcomings. i followed the one who said she used whole wheat flour but didn't use applesauce. I also sweetened with 1/2 grade-B maple syrup & 1/2 sucanat, (tripling the spices) and it was such a nice winter cake. For the frosting, I replaced the butter w/ cream cheese & at the end added maple syrup (instead of confectioner's sugar) - it really went with the cake, and since someone mentioned candied pecans, I made pecan praline & put the crushed sprinkles along the side. We're loving it! Next time I might try the applesauce though.

Rating: 2
Agree with several other reviewers; the cake dried out within a few days and the buttercream frosting (which I purchased instead of making) did not add to the experience. I used a double recipe, to make sure that the layers weren't too thin. Unfortunately, since the cake didn't turn out well, I ended up wasting twice as much on the extra ingredients.

made it with homemade allplesauce instead of butter-used creamcheese icing with cider & cinnamon in it- pretty tasty- would make it again, and put apple slices on bottom of baking pans

Okay, I read the reviews and I took love4vino's advice. I eliminated the butter and used applesauce instead. I didn't have access to cloves and allspice, so I just put in a lot of nutmeg and cinnamon and a dash of black pepper. I used Treetop brand cider - and it worked just fine. I used unbleached flour and I used eggs straight from the refrigerator. Since everyone complained about the frosting, I made a cream cheese frosting with vanilla extract, cinnamon and cider. I turned out great although the layers were thin, I'll just make more next time. I also like the idea of putting sliced apples in the bottom of the pan...I think I'll try that next time. My family doesn't usually like cake and neither do I, but this turned out nice and apple-ly tasting. love4vino made my cake taste great - listen to 'em!

Cake only: I needed an everyday cake for a sick neighbor so skipped the icing and baked in a "Danish" pan, a longer pan that holds the same amount as a standard loaf. Because American recipes are too sweet, I halved the sugar and doubled the spices in order to end up with a "spice" cake vs one more sweet cake. It was okay ... still not that spicy, dried out quickly. I do like the idea of sauteed apples, that might make this really shine.

Not a fan of the BUTTERcream - but the cake is great. Very moist and flavorful - added a little more spice, and doubled batter for bigger layers. The second time I made it I added apple slices and brown sugar to the bottom of my cake pans before I poured in the batter - very yummy!

This recipe isn't that great but a few changes fix it. The icing for this cake was very disgusting, but easily fixed. I just added three cups of powdered sugar to the buttered stuff which changed it to a more traditional frosting with a hint of apple cider to the taste. I like the cake, but the layers were very thin, so I made a double batch of the cake and made three layers. With these few changes I got rave reviews when served at a birthday party.

awful. The icing was too buttery and the cake was bland. I wish I would have taken the time to read the reviews before making it.

Cake layers needed a little more spice. Icing required too much butter. If I make this again, I will cut the amount of butter for icing to 1 cup and add some apple brandy to it.

The recipe is excellent. I did make two changes - because our household is a Vegan one I used soy margarine instead of butter and egg replacer instead of eggs.

I used cream cheese frosten, that was extra good.

I took the base recipe and revised it a bit - it came out wonderful. 1) In the cake - replace all the butter with unsweetened apple sauce. 2)triple the amount of spices called for (I even threw in an 8th teaspoon black pepper for some kick) 3) use HIGH quality unfiltered Cider (I love Barlow's) The quality makes the difference 4) Use Whole Wheat Flour - it gives it more texture. As for the Icing - I make a buttermilk frosting with a little creamcheese and the trick is to add some vanilla bean and cinnamon to it. I have yet to try any recipe verbatem from a magazine of cookbook - sometimes you get lucky - sometimes you don't. I belive in making the recipe 'yours'. Don't let one bad cider cake spoil your bushell of apples. I topped the cake off - by covering the frosting with crushed candied pecans.

Huge waste of time! The only taste was a greasy butter one in the icing, the very thing the recipe text said would not happen. There was FAR too much butter and far too little sugar in the icing. As for the cake - in spite of my having added extra spices, the end product was dry and tasteless. As my 13 year old daughter said as she dumped her piece in the garbage - "I don't taste anything but butter." The cider was not even noted in either the cake or the icing. Surely there was an ingredient or two missing from the recipe for it to be this bad. This truly is THE WORST recipe I have ever used from a GOURMET magazine, and I have been a subscriber for many years.

Wow - what a disappointment! Dry, floury cake, frosting that indeed tasted like nothing but butter -(don't get me wrong, butter is my favorite food group - but more flavor was needed here.) I think I could remedy some of the issues with a dark rum/sugar syrup on the cake, and replacing some of the butter in the frosting with cream cheese and adding some apple brandy, but I don't know that this is worth the work to modify it. I'll keep looking.

Layers had a nice flavor, although I did add a little more spice than called for. Cake was a little too dense for my liking and the frosting was like using pure butter. Blegh. Might possibly make the cake itself again but use a cream cheese frosting instead.
