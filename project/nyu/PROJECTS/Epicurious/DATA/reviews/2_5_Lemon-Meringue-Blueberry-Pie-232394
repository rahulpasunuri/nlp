Made this pie for Thanksgiving, it was a real hit! No problem whatsoever with the lemon mousse. Made the curd and compote two days before assembling the pie. Used more like one cup heavy cream for the mousse. No propane torch so preheated the broiler and ran the pie under the broiler for a few seconds to brown the meringue. Came out beautifully and was delicious, a keeper for sure.

I made this for my husband's birthday and it was amazing! Definitely a lot of work but it was worth it. I cut the recipe in half and made it in 2 individual tart pans. It was beautiful and I loved the combination of sweet & tart.

Complicated recipe, but I was up for the challenge. Still, considering all the hoops I had to leap through to create the curd, the compote and the meringue, I was not at all satisfied with my result. The mousse never set up, so compote sank to the bottom and it all became a soupy mess. The meringue topping was pretty, but so what? It couldn't hide the fact that the pie was a disaster. After a couple of slices, it sat untouched in our refrigerator until it got tossed in the garbage. The only part of this pie I'll make again is the lemon curd, which was fantastic.

I had the same problem as many others with the runny mousse. I would either have a) added unflavored gelatin or b) skip the mousse part altogether and just fill the pie with the lemon curd and the blueberries. Also, I would double the meringue next time. The pie is very very good and will be made again.

I made this for a dinner party following the recipe exactly and was very disappointed in the results. The biggest problem was in the lemon mousse layer. It came out thin and soupy. The compote yield was about 50% of what I needed, the texture of the meringue was grainy and overall the pie was way too sweet. Lots of work for a dismal result. I don't recommend this recipe. One would be better off making a regular lemon meringue pie and serving blueberry compote on the side.

First of all, this pie is very delicious! However, it is the most labor-intensive thing I've ever prepared! In hindsight, you can just prick the pie crust with a fork before baking (for only 20 min) and bypass the pie beads or beans. I worked on this pie for two days (not continuously) and decided to forgo the meringue because I did not have a pastry torch. We enjoyed it immensely with whipped cream. One question though ... couldn't the meringue be spread on with an offset spatula instead of using a pastry bag to pipe it on? Couldn't the meringue be browned in the oven?

The best way to avoid runny mousse is to make sure that the cream is quite cold when you beat it. Make sure that the cream has formed stiff peaks (these should not droop when you pull the mixer out, but be careful its very easy to overbeat at this stage), you'll need this structure to keep the mousse from falling apart. Also, be gentle while folding in the lemon curd. Being too rough with it will cause the mousse to collapse you'll end up with the soupiness described below.

I had some problem with the filling being runny. But I think the problem lies with the blueberries. When I make this again I will add a thickening agent, such as a touch of plain gelatin to the berry compote. Because not using the juice only solves part of the problem.

I live on the shore in Cape Cod; think high humidity & temps. This pie seemed the perfect end for a brunch party we hosted. I started it two days ahead (curd) & had no problem with this step. The mousse had to be made in the morning (recipe said chill 2 to 6 hours). It chilled for about 3 hours but was soupy as I spread it around the pie. It stayed refrigerated for about 3 more hours but the mousse never "set up". The meringue takes a LONG time to achieve stiff peaks but is worth the effort with the shiny & spectacular mounds on top of the pies. Lots of oohs & aahs from the guests before I cut it. That's when I despaired because it ran all over the place & I had to serve it with spoons. It's a great idea but I strongly recommend everyone to read all of the comments (I only read the first 3.) and be warned about the mousse problem. I sure wish someone would let me know (& the others with the same problem) how to fix the mousse.

Like the others I saw the cover and had to make it. I kept waiting for the lemon to set up, didn't happen. Not even by the next day. Needless to say I served it in bowls with a spoon and my guests thought it was good but it was not up to my standards.

This was wonderful! While this was a lot of work I found the taste very rewarding. I was very careful with the ingre. for the custard part and did not have any trouble with it being "soupy." Definitly plan to start this the day before. The only change I made was adding less sugar to the berries. This is a great summer pie!

I agree with other cooks that this is too much work for what you get unless you skip the meringue and blueberries. If I make this again I will skip the meringue and serve berries on the side if I make them. I had trouble with the curd loosening up with the blueberries too even though I drained them well. On the plus side, the lemon curd is perfectly tart and the mousse is a nice change of pace.

I first read this recipe at a cousin's house and could not get the idea of this combination out of my head. She sent me her Bon Appetit and I made it at the first opportunity. What a disappointment. Although others liked it, it gave me what feels like terminal indigestion. Way too over the top for me. Although I made the whole pie over the course of one day, I didn't have any problem getting it to set up. since I did not have a pastry torch to brown the meringue, I glooped it (decoratively!) onto a piece of parchment paper on which I had traced an outline of the piepan. I baked it at 350 for 15 minutes until it had browned nicely. It stuck, of course, but I was able to detach it with a hot, wet long bladed knife and transfer it to the pie with little damage. It looked pretty but was way too much work for the results.

After seeing the picture in my July Gourmet, my son begged me to make this for his 30-something birthday party...I gave it 3 stars as he said it was the most delicious pie he had ever eaten! I told him I was delighted he loved it, and hoped he remembered it, as I would most probably never make it again! Two days and 5-6 different processes??? Don't think so, tasty as it is! BTW I made it in a non-air conditioned, very hot kitchen on the Eastern Shore of MD - I did not have any problems with weeping, and it did indeed look quite impresive!

I doubled the recipe for our annual 4th of July party and made two pies which everyone loved! However, I did have the same problem as the others in that the pie became soupy overnight. Also, this is a very time intensive recipe. I had a problem with the crust after the inital baking process- it shrunk considerably. (The pie filling covered it so you couldn't tell.) Perhaps use another crust recipe that you like.

This was disappointing. My biggest problem was the presentation. First, my meringue didn't fluff. (This was my fault, as I don't think I let the sugar melt enough.) Then, the lemon curd/mousse mix was completely soupy, leaking all over the place when cut. Where did I go wrong? So presentation was lousy. Taste was OK, but definitely too sweet. More lemon, less sugar. And can someone help us fight the runniness? It did seem to set more after 2 days in the fridge...

I thought this recipe looked and sounded delicious. I had just recently picked fresh blueberries so I thought this recipe would be perfect. I agree that it was a time-consuming recipe. The curd was easy to make and tasted great. The pie crust was just okay. Upon assembling the pie, I thought everything looked great. Like the cook from Houston, the lemon mousse after being refrigerated became really soupy and the pie was a mess to eat (with a spoon). It was sweet, but tasted good. Probably will just make the curd and use it in miniature tarts in the future. Does anyone have ideas as to what made the mousse get soupy??

I love to cook and always look to Epicurious for new and different recipes. Lemon and blueberry are perfect flavors for summer...especially when combined, but this recipe was very disappointing! I wouldn't have minded how time consuming the preparation was, if the result was worth it in the end. (This was a VERY labor-intensive undertaking--don't think you can throw this together the morning of your event.) First of all, the crust was not impressive in taste or consistency. The main problem with this recipe, however, was the overwhelming sweetness. Individually the components of the pie were delicious...the curd, the mousse, the meringue...but together, even in the smallest slice, it was sickeningly sweet. It was so impressive to look at, but once tasted, it lost it's stature!!

I liked the concept of this pie and the flavors were good, but I did have some problems with the recipe. The mousse that was made by combining the lemon curd with whipped cream never did set up for me. I chilled it for about 3 hours before spooning it onto the pie, but it just ran (making for a very messy pie to cut!) I also added about a teaspoon of water when I cooked the blueberry compote b/c the only liquid in that was a 1/2 tsp of lemon juice - not enough in my opinion - it was scorching in the pan. The curd was delicious and made more than enough for this pie. I combined the leftover curd with more whipped cream and made parfaits with fresh blueberries. That was delicious and it didn't require the mousse to set up!
