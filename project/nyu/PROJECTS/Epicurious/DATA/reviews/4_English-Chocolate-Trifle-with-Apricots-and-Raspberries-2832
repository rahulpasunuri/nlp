I have been making this trifle every Xmas for over 20 years. The only change I make is to bake my own pound cake instead of using a store bought. The left over trifle is in more demand than the next day turkey sandwiches. Best trifle I've ever tasted!!

There is nothing unhealthy about this trifle. Obviously, you make it for a special occasion; no one eats like this every night. Leave out the liquor flavorings? Totally unheard of in any culture, especially in the culture of merry old England. Merry Christmas all.

I used this recipe to make individual trifles for my book club. It was a huge hit. I didn't have any rum or brandy, so I boiled down the juice from some frozen raspberries, and poured that over the cake, it was terrific. This is a lot of work, but worth every bite. I only made 1/2 the recipe and it made 10 small desserts.

The trifle overall was very good but I didnt like the white chocolate custard - thought it was too rich. I would recommend making the custard omitting the white chocolate and stick of butter - it tastes great and is not so terribly unhealthy! I made it that way 2nd time around and it was a big hit for Thanksgiving party.

This recipe takes quite a bit of time to make, but it is worth it. I made it for Thanksgiving 2 years ago, and it was hit. I'm making it again for this years Thanksgiving.

I use recipes on this site almost weekly and this is the first one I have ever reviewed - because it was so spectacular! Made it for a special dinner party for 18 people - everyone loved it - and ate it even though already full. Amazing blend of flavors - and I don't even like apricots! Used Lindt white chocolate and 2 boxes Betty Crocker pound cake mix (some leftover). Like another reviewer - I omitted the whipped cream - didn't need it - garnished top pastry cream layer with candied apricots and mint leaf. Added a little extra booze - why not?

I hate to be the odd (wo)man out, but I didn't think this was that spectacular. It took a ton of time to make and I just didn't think it was worth it. It made a HUGE amount, enough for probably a good 20 people and after a big dinner nobody wanted that much of it. The apricot puree was delicious, the dark chocolate mixture was good, but I didn't really like the white chocolate pudding once it thickened up. My guests said it was good, but nobody raved about it and I certainly didn't think it was worth the time and effort I put into it. I would not make this again.

I made this recipe based on the reviews it received and am so glad I did! It was a wonderful finish to an elegant dinner party, and my guests were wowed. It does take some time, but it's a fairly straightforward process. I made the pudding and apricot puree Friday night, the chocolate cream Saturday morning and assemble the whole shebang around 2 p.m. Served it at 10. Omitted the whipped cream, as I felt the dish was rich enough without.

I have made this dessert several times since it first came out in 1991. It is a sectacular dessert!!! This last time I did add a tiny bit more chocolate, though. I can't remember how much, maybe 1/2 square of unsweetened chocolate. I do use the white choc pudding for banana cream pie and any other time I need a vanilla pudding. Lindt chocolate is the only way to go!! I did find some nice white belgium choc at Trader Joe's in Portland, OR recently.

I have been making this every Christmas since the recipe first appeared. Everyone loves it!

everyone just loved it!! The white chocolate pudding took almost 6 hours to thicken, so I will start earlier when I make this again.

Fabulous! I made this for Christmas dinner and got some of the best reviews ever! I agree with the other reviewers: it is time consuming but not terribly difficult, particularly given the wonderful end result. I altered nothing to the instructions except that I added a little confectioners sugar and some Godiva white chocolate liqueur to the whipping cream... YUM! I've already gotten requests to make it again.

In a word: unbelievable! The flavors in this trifle complement one another perfectly, and everyone in a large dinner party of picky eaters absolutely loved it. The presentation is gorgeous as well.

This is one of the most delicious desserts I have ever made. Well worth the effort.

One of my all-time favorite recipes. I have made this at least once a year since I got the magazine. A wonderful mixture of flavors!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner, as an alternative to the usual. It was received with raves by both the children and the adults, and was just GORGEOUS on the table. Lots of work, but totally worth it. (I made my own pound cake from scratch, which I would recommend).
