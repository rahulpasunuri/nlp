Had this tonight with crispy tofu sticks. SO yummy!!! Used quarter grape tomatoes. Added lemon zest to the sauce in addition to the juice.

Excellent as is. We will definitely make this again. Even my husband, who doesn't like many vegetables, especially zucchini, liked it.

I made this last night with ribs that we put a dry rub on and as much as we loved the ribs, we couldn't get enough of this dish. I was great and super easy. The only thing I did different was use cherry tomatoes cut in half and I cut the zucchini smaller as well. I just happen to have more cherry tomatoes that I wanted to use up...either way, it was great. We will keep it and make it again!

Please spare your efforts to prepare this dish. The oil - citrus -honey - chili- cumin mixture of the sauce tasted like what I imagine a bad science project to taste. It was disgusting! It doesn't even deserve one fork.
