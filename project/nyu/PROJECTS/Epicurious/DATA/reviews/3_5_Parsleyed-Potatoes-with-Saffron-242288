Simply delicious! I modified the recipe with Yukon Gold potatoes and Irish butter (you can buy in most stores these days). They were great compliments to corn beef and cabbage on St. Patrick's day!

It was great with a rich main course such as the Beef Tenderloin with Morels and Tarragon-Marsala Sauce. I really liked the potatoes- I used Buttercream instead of Red. Next time I will add a little more saffron.

So simple and delicious. I made with some small Yukon Gold potatoes instead of red. Texture was perfect -- soft but with just the right amount of firmness to them. The saffron adds a nice subtle flavor. Served with a chicken cooked in salt crust, was delicious.

Easy, subtle, and truly delicious. I will absolutely make this again.

i was very underwhelmed with this recipe. it was bland, and I'm not crazy about the texture of steamed potatoes. There are a lot of other ways that I would rather prepare potatoes.

After steaming the potatoes for 18 minutes, they seemed to be kind of soggy for my liking, so I threw them onto a baking sheet and roasted for 15 minutes. Happy I did.

Wonderful. They pair well with the Chicken Breasts Provencal from the same issue.
