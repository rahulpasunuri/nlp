I love this recipe! I make it a day in advance and refrigerate it overnight. The next day, I skim the fat off the top, shred the pork chunks by hand, and reheat on the stove top before serving. I set out a bowl of extra BBQ sauce, along with spicy slaw, pickles and/or pickled onions, so folks can dress their sandwiches however they please...

I agree with the other reviewers, this pulled pork comes out like a stew. The spices are weak and there is not a lot of barbecue flavor. You need to add more spices and barbecue sauce if you want this to taste like a traditional pulled pork sandwich.

After 10 hours in the slow cooker, the pork looked more like a stew than what you would put into a roll as a pulled pork sandwich and although very, very tasty, it did not have the taste of barbecue. So, I did the following: 1. Strained the contents and mashed it with a wooden spoon 2. Added about half a cup of off the shelf barbecue sauce. 3. Let it sit on warm for about another 30 minutes. Result: Yum! I also toasted the rolls, added some grated cheese and served with home-made cornbread ;-) Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/notes/Barbecue-Pork-Shoulder-237286#ixzz14GFK5P5g

If you like a saucy pulled pork, you'll want to doctor this recipe, but the foundation is good. Not especially spicy, so upping the seasoning is a safe bet.

First time making a pork shoulder and while the meat was a great texture I had to add BBQ sauce when served and I was hoping with everything I put into the sauce that it would have the flavor.

This recipe was OK, but nothing really special. I used Boston butt, which works really well in a slow cooker, but this needs more zip.

I found this recipe delicious. I substituted a tart green apple for half of the onion and it added a delicious fruity undertone to the sauce. We served it with green apple slaw (another recipe from epicurious) and it was quite tasty.

This was delicious! I think the only thing I changed was I used some kind of milder pepper from my Dad's garden rather than the jalepeno. Even one of my 3-year-olds loved it (the other is sick so her opinion doesn't count).

Really liked it. Used 2 kilos (4.4lbs) of pork shoulder... cleaned the fat (lots). Used an additional 50% -100% of spices, Tabasco, and brown sugar... Realized that I didn't have any garlic or bay leaf, so omitted that. After 10 hours of slow cooking, the meat looked amazing but the sauce was nearly as thin as water! So I took the meat out with a slotted spoon... then took the sauce and reduced it by a TON (maybe 50%?)... simmered it for 50 minutes. Then dumped it back in with the meat and it was GREAT! I like the spices, but still prefer a lot more sweetness, so would add a LOT more brown sugar next time. And, of course use garlic next time.

We just made the meat recipe for my Memphis family (pulled pork sandwich lovers) and got rave reviews. Our modifications: 3 ham hocks in addition to the recommended bacon and shoulder for a nice smoky flavor, as well as 3 cups of chicken broth. We drained the meat before shredding. We used store bought sauce, cuz we already know what we enjoy (a red, sweet one works well). Yum!

This is a great slow cooker recipe. I did omit the bacon and jalapenos for my own preferences. The family loved it and couldn't wait to dig in! Meat was extremely tender and unlike some of the other comments, my sauce was a perfect consistency. The next time I make this the only thing I would do differently is cut back 1/2 the salt and double the brown sugar.

I only gave it 3 forks because I rubbed the meat with Penzeys BBQ 3000 before putting it in the pot. I also cut back on the spice level a bit. But other than those modifications I thought it was great. I thought about taking the meat out, pulling it and then reducing the sauce after a few pulses in the food processor ( it is a bit chunky) to smooth it out, but it smelled too good and my family and I wanted to dig in right away.

My wife and I thought it was great. I added 1 teaspoon of smoked Spanish paprika and omitted the bacon. I drained the meat, then reduced the liquid to a thick consistency in a pan on the stove, then added it back to the broken up meat.

I liked the recipe and the meat was delicious. I have to admit that I used bought BBQ souce when assembling the sandwiches - I don't expect to recreate in one slow cooker recipe what BBQ afficionados spend their lives developing!

Like other reviewers, I had to tweak this recipe a bit. Skipped the bacon and jalapeno, and had to add BBQ sauce at the end of thicken the sauce more. It was still a hit with my family and the meat was delicious.

This was very good, but like the other reviewers I felt the sauce was very thin and not all that flavorful. I did cut back on some of the "hotness" so maybe that was my problem. Pork was very flavorful- skip the bacon though, not necessary.

I love slow cooker recipes, but this one was a little disappointing. The bell pepper flavor took over and it needs a lot of salt. The pork did turn out tender and moist, but the "sauce" flavors disappointed.

This is a great slow cooker recipe. I did all the prep the night before, turned on the slow cooker in the morning and came home to perfectly cooked, extremely tender meat. I agree with previous posters that the sauce was a little thin, which can be remedied by adding some bottled/homemade BBQ sauce to the meat when it's done. I used the full amount of jalepeno and Tabasco and did not find it to be too spicy at all. The only change I would make is to skip the bacon. I don't think it added much flavor, and pork shoulder has plenty of fat on its own.

I followed the tips from prior posters and cut out the Jalapeno and Tobasco to make it more 'family firendly' for kids. It had very good flavor and the meat was fork tender. However, I agree that it was not the 'traditional BBQ' flavor we love here in the South. Yummy though and easy. I left out the bacon and after braising the meat seperately and draining fat, this had NO FAT at all on the surface after even 6 hrs of cooking. Good recipe, easy and tasted better the next day. I'll make it again, but would keep it as a family 'weeknight' recipe, and not one for entertaining.

I really didn't think this was that great. I thought the flavor was a little heavy on the chili powder. I'm not sure that I would make it again...I think I'll probably search for a different pulled pork recipe for next time.

I am surprised that no one has mentioned that with two tablespoons of hot chile powder, a teaspon of Tabasco sauce and a jalapeno pepper with seeds, this barbecue is incredibly hot! I mean, almost uncomfortably so. It definitely needs coleslaw to cut the heat.

This makes fabulous bbq...I substitute hot smoked paprika for the chile powder to get that smokiness. Having eaten 'the real thing', my family are picky about bbq. Even the skeptical English gourmets fall for this. I'm asked for the recipe time and time again.

This was very good and easy! The only problem I had was that the barbecue sauce was thin. After shredding the meat I added a bottle of barbecue sauce to the meat.

I used boneless, country style pork ribs and they worked great. This dish is a real keeper; tastes great and is super easy!

Leftovers? Since I only made this for 2 I had lots of pork left over. I saved the sauce/peppers/tomatos too and made a rice casserole the next night. Mix leftovers with approx. 3 cups cooked brown rice, one can black beans (drained) and shredded cheddar cheese. Place mixture in casserole dish. I put a thin layer of sour cream and then more cheese on top. Bake in oven about 20 min or until heated through. Yum.

Very easy to make in your crock pot. The barbecue sauce was good but a little thin. I reduced the sauce by removing the cover and placing on high setting for the last 1/2 hr of cooking. Fortunately the ciabatta sandwich rolls soaked up the liquid. The flavor itself was very good. I also substituted beef short ribs for the cubed pork shoulder. Be sure to trim the fat before you put the ribs in the crock pot. The meat fell off the bones perfectly in the same amount of time. Unbelievably easy to make and simultaneously tasty.

I personally did not care for this recipe. It wasn't like traditional pulled pork, as I was expecting. I strained off all the peppers and onions after it cooked, so the sauce wasn't chunky. The meat was good, but the sauce wasn't anything special.

I gave this recipe four forks. It was incredibly easy, very tasty and minus the 10 hours in the slow cooker, very quick. I followed the instructions exactly and everyone loved it. I will definitely be making this again.

Aside from me, my family isn't a big fan of spicy food, so I omitted the jalapeno and cut the chili powder in half. This was delicious; it still had a hint of heat and a wonderfully complex flavor. Even the kids had seconds, and I'll definitely make this again.

This was certainly an easy, pleasing crock pot recipe that didn't require browning the meat ahead of time. Really good with lots of pickle relish on the sandwiches.

Wow, this came out really juicy and tender. I have never made pork shoulder before, and was really happy with the results. I followed the recipe but omitted bacon, and used ancho chili powder instead of regular chili powder. If you like a lot of barbeque sauce or a thicker consistency on these, you may want to double the sauce ingredients and save some for topping the sandwiches (and don't forget the coleslaw!). Definitely a keeper.
