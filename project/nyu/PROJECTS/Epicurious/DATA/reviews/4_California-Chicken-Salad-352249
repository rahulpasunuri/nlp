Really yummy salad and so easy to make! I had some chicken breasts leftover from a previous meal which made this a fast weeknight dinner. I added an avocado to the salad.

This one's a keeper! I grilled the chicken a few hours earlier, and then just removed from fridge and thinly sliced it - still great cold in the salad. I also added sauteed mushrooms, as for some reason i thought I saw them on the ingredient list, and they were afine addition. My hubby and I loved it, a great tasty way to get your veggies in. I will definitely make again.

Very good...labor intensive. Probably best made with friends sitting around, drinking wine.. Tasted great...especially with the white zinfandel rose.

Yum - this was really great. I dusted the chicken breasts with a little flour to help hold the flavor. Can't wait to make it again!

Forgot to say that I grilled the chicken ahead of time, cooled it and then sliced it.

I tripled this recipe for a group of 9 and there were no left overs. I used an equivalent amount of grape tomatoes and reduced the amount of honey in the dressing.

This was really delicious. I didn't have asparagus, so I used brocolli which i currently had in the fridge. Worked fine i thought. The dressing was really nice. I was worried about the raw onion and sourness of the tomatoes, but i had nothing to fear in the end. My husband was licking the plate! TOok it to lunch the next day and it was still yummy.

loved it. the dressing really tastes like the McDonald's honey mustard dip I remember in Happy Meals. The second time I made it, I subbed sesame oil for olive oil and threw in orange peppers, golden raisins, fresh basil and chopped apples for an asian (and appropriate seasonal) twist.

Loved this recipe. So simple and so adaptable. Served at a bridal shower and everyone loved it. On a large plater,started with a bed of fresh baby spinach , tossed lightly with my favorite vinagrette, then layered the tomatoes (red and yellow), grilled asparagus, chicken (marinated and grilled) corn, bacon, avocado, and nuts. Drizzled with the dressing (very good; I thought it would be too sweet) Kind of an adaptation on Cobb salad. Super easy. Will use again soon!

Delicious. The dressing is excellent. I poached the chicken instead of frying to save some calories and keep it nice and juicy. Added the garlic and a bit of cayenne to the chicken broth. Doubled the tomatoes and the pine nuts, as plums here are really small. Next time, will serve this over a bed of lettuce, as I missed my greens.

This was outstanding! With leftover roasted chicken on hand I was looking for a weeknight meal and came across this. I used a can of corn (instead of fresh) and just 1 tomato (since they are not that flavorful yet) and walnut pieces instead of pine nuts (had none at home). I had leftovers of it for 2 days (my work lunch). This salad is very satisfying, and pretty to view. This recipe is a keeper.

I already had bone in breast roasting in the oven and I wanted a different chick salad for sandwiches... I added the chili and garlic powders the the dressing and 2 tbl light mayo...didn't have fresh tomato so I omitted it; added red bell pepper instead of corn. I shredded the chicken and added it too the dressing, red pepper, red onion and asparagus bits..Served it on toasted 9 grain bread..Yum.. Will also try the original recipe in the summer as it was written...sounds really good!

My Book Club was licking the Plate!!!! My Husband devoured the leftovers, Everyone wants the recipe! A Big Hit at my house. I didn't have pine nuts so I used pumpkin seeds, but that's the only change I made. Yummy

I enjoyed this but I found the dressing a bit sweet. And there was too much of it. But it was simple and great for my take to work lunches!

I am a graduate student who doesn't have much experience in the kitchen and a tight budget. This was quick, easy and delicious. When I make meals I am usually eating the same leftovers for the rest of the week so I was thrilled to find that the left over veggies make an awesome omelet AND chicken stir fry! The dressing of course goes well on any salad. This is the perfect multi purpose recipe!

No asparagus, so used avocado instead, and substituted commercial smoked chicken fillet. Our guests loved it for lunch!

This salad was wonderful!! The only thing I added was some sliced avocado. My friends loved it, my family (all men) loved it. There are so many textures and the dressing is perfect.

This is surprisingly delicious and very pretty (much prettier than the picture on this site). I used frozen corn (corn and asparagus are not in the same season, people!) It was lovely. Yes, the dressing calls for 6 tablespoons of honey, but it's delicious-- you do have to use a blender to blend in all that honey. Excellent ladies' lunch type dish.

This salad is great. I made it for a potluck dinner and everyone loved it and went back for 2nds. It's so fresh and light. I accidently bought horseradish mustard instead of dijon mustard and went ahead and used it. With the sweetness of the honey it tasted great. I think it might be better than with dijon. I will definitely make this again this summer. Next time I plan to add red bell pepper and avocado.

The dressing was very mustardy for my taste. I thought the chicken was very moist and delicious, though! I will probably make this again with no dressing. It really doesn't need one.

Easy to prepare, my 22 and 14 year old sons loved it, as did my spouse. Husband said, "I feel like I just ate at a really upscale restaurant!". Very healthy and low cal. I increased corn to five and asparagus to one pound. Delicous!

I used a precooked chicken from the grocerie store and canned corn. It took about 10 minutes off the cooking time and tasted great.
