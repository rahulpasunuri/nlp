I happened to have an excess of green beans and found this recipe but thought it looked to mild for my tastes so I jazzed it up... 1st I doubled the recipe except for the soy sauce and added an additional Tbsp of chopped ginger rather than 2 Tbsp, 3 Tbsp. I marinated the chicken in 1 Tbsp fresh lemon juice, 1 tsp paprika, 1 Tbsp grnd cayanne pepper for 30 min. I also stir fried the chicken with 7 chopped green onions. For the sauce I used 1 cup chick broth, 3 Tbsp soy sauce, 2 Tbsp coconut amino acids, 4 Tbsp rice vinegar and 2 Tbsp arrowroot. I also added the beans into the stir fry after 1 minute of stir frying the peppers for around 3 minutes, then pushed the veggies to the side and added the sauce to thicken, finally adding the chicken and mixing all ingredients. Delicious!

This is very light and quick to prepare. I blanched asparagus in the microwave instead of beans. The sauce was a little thin and tart so I added some plum sauce; I might tighten it up w/ some cornstarch next time

Very good -- even with Morningstar veggie chicken strips. I also added stir-fry rice noodles to the wok.

Great and really easy - perfect for weeknight meals. I added sugar snap peas (same quantity as beans) and some chillies (no seeds) and next time will use more ginger and garlic. Just get the rice boiling before you start - it's really fast to make!

We thought this was great. I doubled the amount of soy sauce and rice vinegar to make it a bit more saucier.

Made this just as is except I used powdered ginger (all I had) and added about 1/2 cup pineapple with some of the juice. I also sprinkled sesame seeds on top. The sweetness of the pineapple complemented the flavors deliciously. My husband loved it! I will certainly make it again.

This stir-fry makes a delicious, healthy and relatively inexpensive mid-week dinner. The flavors of the ginger, garlic, rice vinegar and soy sauce go very well together. However the next time I make this (and I will) I plan to marinate the chicken in those flavors beforehand. Every bite was great but the chicken it was just plain old bland. Marinating the chicken will fix that I'm sure.

i have made this dish many, many times. it's fast , simple and delicious. kids like it too because of its simplicity. i substitute other meats occasionally too.

I leave out the chicken and use this as a vegetable accompaniment to a meal. I put a few Tbsp's of water in a cast iron skillet with the green beans, cover them and let them steam there, then I add the rest of the vegetables right into the beans and follow the rest of the recipe as written -- except I double everything else. Yum. And easy. You can really use this simple sauce with any veggies really.

Although this recipe was easy to prepare, it didn't have much flavor despite the fact that I added some red pepper flakes to jazz it up.

This is my husband's favorite dish, out of everything I make. I love it, too. It's easy, healthful, and delicious. A weekly staple in our house, served over rice. I follow the recipe as written, but it's easy to dial the flavor up or down to your personal taste.

Great for a mid week meal. We used pea pods and broccoli instead of beans, added more soy and vinegar, as well as a bit of corn starch to increase and thicken the sauce.

I thought this recipe was very easy to make and quick. Nice for a week night's meal after work.

Followed the recipe as written and was disappointed with the result. The sauce was not great - too much of a vinegar taste. Will not make this again.

It is a simple, delicious weeknight dinner. We are going to have it for our every "Friends w/ Asian food" night.

I added more garlic and ginger, but this dish is very easy to make. It is excellent for a quick weeknight meal and its colorful enough to serve at a casual dinner party. I also added cilantro while cooking the chicken. It adds more color and a little tang to it. Great recipe!!!

I've made this several tiimes and am cooking it for dinner again tonight. I double the sauce ingredients, and we put the extra over rice. I use a combination of regular sesame oil and spicy sesame oil, which gives it more zing. Very easy and reliable standby, and it tastes great!

I used a store-bought stir fry sauce and added sliced scallion to the veggies. Really quick and really tasty weeknight dinner.

We sprinkled additional rice vinegar in which I had been steeping some jalapenos over the rice and vegetables--it gave this recipe the kick it needed. Without the additional vinegar, we thought the recipe was bland. We made it vegetarian using tofu in place of chicken.

Everyone seemed pleased with this recipe and I'd make it again. It was certainly quick and easy. I sauteed some dried red chillies in the oil before I added the chicken... and minced some lemongrass to go in with the ginger and garlic -- just to give it a little more zing.

This is a great basic recipe for a weeknight dinner. The flavors blend well and the seasame oil add a snap to the chicken. I used red, yellow, and green peppers and zucchini. I'll definitely used it again as a baseline recipe for cleaning out the veggie drawer.

I have made this dish a couple of times, once with chicken and once with tofu. The "sauce" is quick and easy, although I would cut back on the ginger just a bit and I would add in some chili oil or some red pepper flakes.

I thought this was good - but it was too salty. Next time I would not salt the chicken or the water for beans, and use lite (less sodium) soy sauce.

Rating: 3
Very colorful, quick and easy... we enjoyed it on a weeknight and it would be great to serve to guests another time. Definitely use fresh ginger and garlic and throw in extra if you like those flavors. The recipe doubled makes enough "extra" sauce that we used it on the rice, instead of more soy sauce. Very yummy and smelled great while cooking too!

I love it. I added 1/2 lb jumbo shrimp to the chicken . also added yellow/orange peppers for color. Sub Long Beans for green. Made a sauce to poor over stir fry over basamit rice. equal parts water to soy sauce, quarter part sugar, large jalapeno ( seeded and diced), red chile flake, 1 large lime squeezed and grated ginger (boil 4 min) let stand to thicken. This dish was awesome. You have to try it.

This has to be one of my very favorite stir fry dishes. I've made this many times and it's always very tasty. I don't understand why other cooks find the flavor bland, I've never had a problem-don't skimp on what the recipe calls for, use fresh garlic and ginger-don't use powdered or pre-packaged spices.

I had to alter this to use 2.5 lbs. of chicken and it was very tasty. For those who need to feed more - here's the combo...1 lb. green beans, 10 Tablespoons sesame oil, 40 ounces chicken, 3 red bell peppers, 1+ Tablespoons ginger, 7 garlic cloves, 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/2 cup rice vinegar.

While this dish is very colorful and easy to make, it was lacking in excitement. I'd make it again, but I'd add more garlic and ginger when cooking the chicken and perhaps a little more vinegar for the sauce.

A very colorful dish, but kind of boring. I added more garlic, ginger and red pepper, but it still was not all that exciting. Basmati rice goes well with this light dish-- any suggestions are welcome.
