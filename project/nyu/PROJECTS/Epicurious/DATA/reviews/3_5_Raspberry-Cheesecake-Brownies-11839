I really ENJOYED this recipe. I thought the brownies were delicious and the cheesecake was awesome. Next time I make them I am sure I will increase the cheesecake layer as suggested in previous reviews.

This recipe was very delicious! However, I used a Betty Crocker brownie mix instead of brownie recipe mix given. I found it tasted much better and was more moist. The cheese-cake topping was exceptional! Would deffiently make this again!

I've been making these brownies since the recipe was first printed in the issue I received in the mid 90s. It has ALWAYS been a hit and people ask for them time and time again. That said, some of the variations suggested here in the reviews such as increasing the cheesecake layer by 1.5x, are very helpful. I think I'm going to try the raspberry jam layer suggestion to the batch I'm making today.

Did not like this recipe at all. Brownies came out extremely dry. A lot of work for a not-so-great brownie. Would not make again.

The chocolate layer, while it does give you a moist, rich brownie, was a little too sweet for my taste. I also found that 1.5x the cream cheese layer was unnecessary. The search for a great cream cheese brownie recipe continues.

These brownies rocked! I used Valrhona chocolate so the brownies were like rich fudge from the refrigerator. I like the idea of adding raspberry jam between the brownie and cream cheese layers and I will try that next time. Everyone at work loved them!

These are by far the best brownies I have EVER made! My little sister just turned 18 and she hates cake, so I made her these and she's never tasted anything this good! TWO THUMBS WAY UP!! Oh I put a little extra lemon juice in the cream cheese to make it a little more lemony! Great Idea

These are very easy to make and they taste great! The cheesecake layer is just a little bit too thin for my taste... I will probably use 50% more cheesecake batter the next time.

These looked beautiful. However, they tasted blah. So many better recipes for brownies with or without the cheesecake layer. Don't waste your time on these.

Rating: 4
Yum, yum, yum! Thses were so good. The first time I made them I made as directed (except for using 6 oz bittersweet and no unsweetened chocolate) and the second time I made them I doubled the cheesecake part. Both times were good but I think I actually prefer the recipe as written. There is just enough lemony cheesecake and tart raspberries to cut through the richness of the brownie without overpowering it. Yum! Try it, you won't be sorry.

Rating: 3
Taste great. I made a few alterations based on other reviews: a thin layer of raspberry jam between the chocolate and cream cheese, and I added the raspberries after baking. Also, I cut down on the sugar significantly. The result was sweet enough for me. I also doubled the lemon juice to give the cream cheese a little citrusy flavor. I'd recommend!

It was a lot of work for some so-so brownies. I'm not a big fan of baking (although I love to cook!), so this recipe just wasn't for me.

these are pretty wonderful (oh, and flagstaff, I think your experimentation sounds lovely--it's so much fun to play around with these recipes!) (sidenote to greygrey: is this really the place for such venom?)

i've made these at least a dozen times... my trick for making them look pretty is to pipe the cheesecake topping on top so it's as even as possible and to lay frozen rasberries in neat rows so after they are cut, they don't look messy...

These brownies are really good, and easy enough to bake that anyone can do it. Try these modifications, I think they turned out very well 6 Oz. Ritter Sport Marzipan (Instead of bittersweet and semi-sweet chocolate) 1 tsp Almond extract (instead of vanilla) 4 Oz. Low-fat Cream cheese 4 Oz. White Stilton with Cranberries, crumbled.

Made this without raspberries (didn't have any) ... I thought the brownie and cheesecake layers would be about equal but the cheesecake was like a thin cover of frosting on top. Would make again, but next time either half the chocolate layer (and put in smaller dish), or double the cheesecake layer. The brownie part was delicious (very rich and solid) it would get 4 forks! I also cooked it for longer than in the recipe, turned the oven up at the end to make it just go golden. I think it would have been even better served with raspberries/raspberry sauce!

Rating: 4
I would advise making this recipe without the raspberries cooked, or perhaps adding fresh raspberries at the end. I made these for Christmas with crushed peppermint candycanes. Just crush the candycanes and add just before it is fully cooked. Very festive. It is also wonderful without any topping at all. I have also added chocolate chips to it with wonderful results. You must use parchment paper or butter and flour real well to get it out. My suggestion is to put it in the freezer for about 30 minutes prior to cutting it and this will really help cut it easier(use a really sharp knife). Happy eating.

Putting the raspberrys before baking was a super bad idea. It doesnt let the brownie cook. I am not happy about this. I wish my brownie came out right.

in terms of taste, beyond compare. i think these brownies are incredible. however, i agree w/ the reviewer who says they are difficult to get out of the pan...but worth it anyway.

I have made this twice now and really love the flavor and the looks. I do have a little trouble getting them out of the pan and the first time I underbaked them, but I would say they are worth it.

These were so good! Not being a big baker, I was slightly worried I would mess these up, but everything came out perfectly, they all got eaten, and they looked and tased great even with defrosted frozen raspberries. I did only bake them for 30 minutes, I think underbaking tends to make brownies taste better though...

This dish was good but not great. I thought the top looked unfinished with dots of rasberries. I ended up frosting it with cream cheese frosting. The brownie was a little dry. I followed other advice and used parchment paper and had no sticking problems.

These brownies are amazing and were instantly devoured by everyone at work, with everyone wanting more. The brownie part is very dense and almost like a flourless chocolate torte, not really brownie-like, but so rich and delicious! The cheesecake topping was so good and a perfect counterpart to the super rich brownie. I may tinker with this and bake individual brownies in mini-springform pans and wait to top them with the raspberries until they are cooled. This recipe was easy too, so try it! You won't be disappointed!

Rating: 2
All of the components of this recipe were good: the brownie base is great and the flavor combination is terrific. But, I didn't find the finished product to make a nice appearance. With the raspberries somewhat sinking into the cheesecake, it sort of looked like the finished brownies had a case of the measles. Some folks did rave over them, though. I'll definitely fiddle with putting the raspberries in between the layers and making extra cheesecake topping. Again, wonderful flavors are at work here!

My partner adores these brownies--I think he fell in love with me before he fell in love with me! (tee hee) He requested that I make them with strawberries for his 30th, so we'll see how they turn out. These brownies are simply marvelous! and oh so yummy!

I love these brownies. The people I work with love these brownies. I even got a marriage proposal because of these brownies! I'm already married, but it just shows how amazingly good these brownies are. I make them as written and have never had a problem with them sticking -- they come right out of the pan every time.

Delicious! A perfect mix of my three favorite dessert items... Cheesecake, chocolate and raspberries! I will definitely make this one again and again!

To the cook that had problems getting her brownies out of the pan. Parchment solves that, but in case you don't use it and have a stuck product, just put the pan on the stove for about 20 seconds, moving it around to heat evenly..the cake/brownies should then loosen easily. In the case of a glass pan, you'd be safer to set the pan in about an inch of boiling water you've poured into a larger pan or a sink.

The idea of cheese cake, chocolate & raspberries is extremely appealing but this recipe didn't work for me. Tastey, yes, but seemed a little soggy. If I ever try it again, I might put the raspberries in between the layers OR add jam in between and add raspberries late in baking as someone else suggeted. p.s. My faux pas...I dusted with powdered sugar and then refrigerated the pan for final chilling. Sugar melted, of course!

Rating: 3
Made these for a friend's birthday. Very nice presentation and tasted v. good, too. Use lots of raspberries!! My raspberries sat in the fridge too long and I only had 8 to put on top of the cake -- but they taste fantastic mixed with the chesecake and chocolate. Must remember to buy the berries sooner to the use date next time!

Rating: 4
After several variations on this recipe, I think I finally found perfection! I used cooking oil to grease the pan and then floured it and had no trouble getting the brownies out. I added a thin layer of raspberry jam in-between the brownie and cheesecake layer. I then made 1 and 1/2 times the amount of cheescake to spread on top of the brownie layer. Lastly, I waited until after baking to put the rasperries on top and placed one berry on each square. They were fantastic and looked picture perfect!

I made these for a party but had so much trouble getting them out of the pan that I took a bottle of wine instead. I buttered and floured a Pyrex baking dish and refrigerated the brownies for 6 hrs per instructions. Any suggestions?

I love these brownies. The tartness of the fresh raspberries is so good with the sweet/richness of the brownies. They are easy to make and I always recieve rave reviews when I serve them.

While this dessert is probably more fitting for Valentine's Day, I made them for the Super Bowl. I used frozen raspberries (unthawed) which bled a little into the cheesecake part, but it still came out fine. Next time I might try dollops of raspberry preservesinstead. I recommend serving these chilled.

Rating: 4
These are excellent, easy to make brownies. They hold up well, so you can make them 2 days ahead. I am making these for Valentine's Day, but I am turning them into cheesecake 'bites.' I am using a heart shaped cookie cutter to make the hearts and will position the raspberry in the middle of the heart AFTER they bake. Set into a red foil cupcake liner - they will be just beautiful.

Absolutely Delicious!! I made these to take for a dinner party and everyone raved about them, and I only had a few leftover. I used frozen raspberries straight from the freezer and it turned out great. This is a keeper!

the recipe was good, but i'm just not crazy about raspberry seeds in my teeth. if i'm feeling more ambitious nest time i'll ouree and swirl the berries into the cheesecake. or perhaps i'll just use cherries or strawberries. the recipe itself is well worth making in my opinion.

This never fails to wow guests. I have substituted blueberries to great success. This is a favourite in our household.

This was easy and delicious. They were gobbled up at a birthday party. I overcooked it just a smidgen at 40 minutes. They never browned and puffed on top, which threw me. Should have stopped at 35 minutes.

Addictive! It was even better a few days after making, and I liked it at room temperature, rather than straight from the fridge. Be sure not to overbake; my batch was done in 30 minutes. So good in the afternoon with a cup of tea. Mmmm, think I'll go cut a square!

Made this for Easter and used strawberries instead of raspberries and it was great.

Fab-o! Didn't have correct chocolate on hand so substituted 4oz. unsweetened and 2oz. german chocolate. Added 1/4c. sugar to compensate. Used frozen black raspberries from my garden-put whole berries under cheesecake layer then pureed some in with part of cheesecake, then swirled in with rest of cheesecake layer for marble effect. Baked about 10 extra minutes. Was hard to cut brownie layer. Tastes fantastic chilled. Family loved it!

Holy cow! These were great! My kids even helped me with these. We used blueberry pie filling from a can and not quite so much of the cream cheese mix. Our only problem was waiting until they cooled enough to eat!!!!

Absolutely delicious! I love the combo anyway. I used raspberries straight from the freezer (didn't even thaw them). The center took some time to cook but I put my brownies in a 12x8-inch pan because I like them thicker. Would make again. I would probably use less of the Cheescake Topping though, making it less runny/gooey.

Used a box brownie mix, and doubled cheesecake topping. Wonderful!

Delicious! I followed someone's suggestions and added half again as much of the cream cheese topping and spread a thin layer of my homemade raspberry jam between the brownies and the cheesecake layer. I baked the brownies about 43-45 minutes because of this addition. Even with the extra few minutes the brownies remained very moist. I served these at a party and everyone said I should quit my job and open a bakery!

definately the best brownie recipe ever. Everyone raved and fought over the last few. I had no problem with either dried out brownies or removing them from the pan-they were perfect. I did, however, use baking paper to line the pan.

Rating: 3
Someone asked how to keep the brownies from drying out. In between the brownie and cheesecake layer dab or squirt on some slightly diluted rasberry jam. I dilute a whole a jar of jam with a little OJ and slip it in. Sometimes I put jam on top or combine it with fresh berries in a levkar and spoon on top. If you want to be completely sinful... add a macaroon topping to the very top and drizzle rasberry puree or diluted jam over the top.

These brownies are delicious!!! I even dared to use frozen raspberries (well drained) as fresh ones were unavailable. Next time I make them...more raspberries and perhaps extra cheesecake layer.

Loved these brownies but I don't like raspberry seeds so I used a puree of raspberries between the chocolate and cheesecake layers. Also added swirls of raspberry jam mixed with framboise across the top. Don't overbake-the chocolate layer turns..awful. Next time I'll add half again as much cheescake. Too good!
