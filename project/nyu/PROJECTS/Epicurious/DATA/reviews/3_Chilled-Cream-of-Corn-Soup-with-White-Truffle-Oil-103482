First rule for this soup: Do not make this if you cannot get your hands on fresh, peak of the season sweet corn...I did and loved the way it turned out. I used a mixture of white and yellow corn, because that is what I could get. The white here is sweeter than the yellow. I tweaked the recipe in two ways: I sauteed the corn in the butter with the shallots for a few minutes before adding the liquid and I used half home made chicken broth with half water. Ours turned out great and I actually like it better sans the truffle oil (and that is amazing, because I love truffles.)

quite a bit of work for something so pedestrian or may I say bland. it needs heat, it needs cheese...something.

My guests make me indecent offers when I serve them this soup. I only make it at the height of fresh corn season in my area. I follow the recipe, and either strain or don't depending on how fancy we're feeling. Chives from my garden decorate the top, along with the magical truffle oil. I'm thinking the freshest possible corn is key.

Followed advice and did not strain it after blending--PTOOOEY texture. So I put it thru food mill, added some more fresh cooked kernel. So-so soup. Truffle oil "saved" it as palatable. Wouldn't waste time energy or even $.17/ear for corn again.

An excellent alternative to Vichysoise. The soup is rich and creamy. I also did not strain it and enjoyed the texture of the dish. You MUST use the truffle oil - it completes the soup and takes it from ordinary to elegant.

This is a good start, and turned out great with some changes. The corn needed to be cooked for closer to 25 minutes, and instead of water I used chicken stock. Then I blended it (after cooling a little) and did not strain (why strain?), added half-and-half and chilled. This made for a delicious chowder, and went well with the truffle oil and chives.

I didn't use so much water and it tasted wonderful. Also, didn't strain it as much as per previous posters suggestions!

I haave made this for company many times and always get rave reviews. The key to making it really special is the truffle oil.

This is a good soup, although it was a bit thin. I emptied at least a cup and a half of the water once the corn was cooked, and next time I'd take out a bit more. The truffle oil is definitely worth adding.

I made this as a starter for an informal dinner party. Everyone thought it was great!

The basic flavors were very good, but I found the soup to be thin and a little anemic. It would be better slightly thickened, maybe by straining less.

This soup was very sweet and refreshing. I needed to add yellow food coloring. I used white corn and when I added the 1/2 & 1/2 it looked like milk. The texture was completely smooth and I think next time I might not do such a good job of straining ALL the corn. It looked and tasted wonderful with the fresh chives. Excellent for a summer dinner party.
