Dressing was yummy on a slaw made with one large julienned jicama, a few shredded carrots, a little bit of diced cucumber, and one finely chopped serrano chile. I put in a little extra lime juice but followed the recipe otherwise. Everyone liked it.

This is nice and fresh and tasty. I made enchiladas and served this on the side. The only change i made was substituting agave nectar for the sugar.

Ypu definetely need to sit overnight for the flavors to develop, but it was very tasty and refreshing after all.

Not my favourite thing to do with a jicama, but well-balanced and tasty. If you have a mandoline it will speed things up.

I eliminated the sugar and instead of 1/3 cup of olive oil I used the roasted sesame oil. I also upped the fresh lime juice. It was excellent and even better 2 days later.

This has always been popular when I make it for summer get-togethers. People are very interested in "what is jicama?" and find it to be extremely fresh and simple tasting. Even my super-finicky in-laws loved it!!

My husband loves this recipe! He is not a fan of mayo but sometimes you need a nice slaw to set off the meal. I am not a fan of cilantro but we've found a happy medium by subbing italian parsley. I also substituted a light vege oil for the olive oil!

Light, flavorful summer dish. I agree with the previous poster that you must make the dish well ahead of time & let the dish sit to properly blend the flavors. I used the jullienne disk on my mandoline slicer to get ultra-thin slices of jicama. The paper-thin slices better absorbed the dressing. Not to mention it made preparation that much easier!

I really enjoyed this. I also substituted sesame oil for the olive oil and I think it enhanced the flavor...a nice, light summer slaw.

I used dark roasted sesame oil with this - much more complimentary flavor than the olive oil

I just made this for two guests from France and they raved! Light, flavorful - a perfect summer side dish. You absolutely need to let it sit for at least an hour, though.

I was ecstatic to find a fresh jicama in Seattle where they mostly rot like shriveled prunes in the produce sections. Unfortunately, this jicama spent its evening as the Lockhorn's dinner special. Extra virgin olive oil with jicama? What an aftertaste. It totally overwhelmed the fresh flavor of the sweet radish. I tried to resurrect it with a julienned green apple. It helped. Not alot. A nice light oil could save this dish. Or another apple to what's left.

This receipe actually provides more than 8 servings considering many people do not have a well developed knowledge of jimaca. I increased the lime juice and did what the other reader set, let the flavors set (refrigerated) for about an hour. Taming the onion in salt water worked nicely. Be careful when purchasing the jicama. I didn't know what to expect but it became clear when I had two of them that one had previously been frozen. Not a good idea. I did slice it and leave it in the refrig for the 6 hours and it was fine. A smaller jicama with the same dressing worked fine the second time I made it.

Great salad! I served it with salmon and it was the perfect light accompaniment. Next time I'll make it a few hours ahead to let it soak up the lemon and cilantro flavors!

I traveled to California and discovered tis great veggie. I have noticed many recipes for jicama in Gourmet lately. I made this and found it to be great, easy to prepare and I can't wait to make it for an upcoming catering party!!
