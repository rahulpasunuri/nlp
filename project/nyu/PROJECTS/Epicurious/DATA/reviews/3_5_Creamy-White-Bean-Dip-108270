Just good, not great. I used dried beans, which made a nice consistency over canned. It was simple to make and healthy, and my vegan friends liked that I offered a non-dairy dip. However, I noticed there was a lot leftover at the end of the BBQ. I'm sure you could add many things to make it more flavorful and interesting. As is, it's nothing special.

Very simple but quite tasty. I used fresh rosemary and fresh thyme in the mix. I think it might be bland as written, so since I had some peppadew peppers I chopped them and added to the mix along with a shake each of cumin and cayenne. Garnished with a bit of fresh thyme and mint.

Don't use canned beans for this. I made that mistake and it turned out much too soft, so I had to add some chickpea flour to thicken. I added fresh scallions, some roasted red pepper, and lots of garlic--tastewise it turned out great and better the next day.

Made this for a family holiday party I hosted several years ago. I needed some meatless appetizers for the vegetarian guests, and this looked to be a quick and inoffensive offering. It turned out to be as easy as it seemed, but with a lovely fresh flavor that everyone appreciated. I've made it many times since, always to high marks. It's a great recipe to have in your pocket, as one can make it in a pinch with ingredients on-hand. I like to put it in sandwiches and wraps as well as use it as a dip for veggies and pita chips.

Delicious and easy. I used parsley instead of the mint and dill, and put everything in the processor with the beans. A delicious option is to add about 1/4-1/2 marinated artichoke hearts to the food processor.

I think this is very good. Two forks sounds too low, but two are for good, and three are for delicious... So I would have said two and a half, given the choice. Or maybe I'm being to difficult. Anyway, I substituted a bit for the herbs to use what I had on hand, and at the end, because it was a bit bland, added a dash of red pepper and salt. And I must say, it was good! And, to the other cooks who don't want to get out the food processor for a simple dip, being similarly minded, I used an old fashioned potato masher, which worked great and made a nice puree with little effort.

This is very good. Instead of sprinkling the herbs on top I mixed them in. Looked pretty speckled. Added a garnish of fresh mint leaves and served with peppered water crackers to rave reviews.

I played around with the seasonings also and wasn't too impressed, either. It is better the next day, after the flavors melded but still not great.

Bland. Would not make again. I tried amping up the cumin, lemon juice and salt, but it didn't help a great deal.

Yummy! This was somewhat difficult to do in a blender, but that's all I had. I added about 2 tbsp sherry, extra lemon juice, thyme, and 2 tbsp plain yogurt just because it was a bit thick. No mint or dill on hand, sadly. This consistency was as light as the flavor. Just wish it didn't have so many calories. I'm looking forward to how it will taste tomorrow!

this is good but not earth shattering. i probably won't make it again on my hunt for the best bean dip in the world. still, it was tasty and went quickly at the party.

Whipped this up after work because I had all of the ingredients. We enjoyed this very much with a glass of wine and baby carrots for dipping while we were preparing our main meal. Wonderful fresh flavors.

This was very tasty! I made it Friday evening and it made a delicious and healthy snack all weekend with raw carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower!

This was the perfect recipe for a guest on a very restricted "heart healthy" diet and everyone liked it. I used thyme instead of dill because I had it available and Butter Beans instead of Cannelli because I couldn't easily find them. I would parboil the garlic next time to "gentle" it slightly. I added a little plain yoghurt to it to make it a little more creamy. Another easy, quick recipe that I would make again!

What a nice change from hummus and black bean dip! The mint is nicely refreshing and like another reviewer,I thought that thyme was a much better addition than the dill. I also added a splash of white wine to thin it a bit. I served with some homemade sesame lavosh crackers and it was a huge hit.

i really enjoyed this dish, and just put all the ingredients in the food processor and it was very tasty. I look forward to tasting it tomorrow. I'll happily make this one again.

Perfect dish. Very good, very easy. I had everything on hand, except the dill. Left it out and still was good. I don't like overwhelming garlic flavor, so use half of medium sized clove.

I loved this recipe. I thought it was eveb better than a lot of traditional "hummus" recipes. I added a little more oil to help loosen it a bit because I was mashing by hand so I had a little more rustic (i.e. lumpy) dip. But it was so delicious. Any legume would work great. Adjust all ingredients to your taste. Oh ya - I made it the night before and it was perfectly good the next day.

Easy, added more fresh garlic, eyeballed the other ingredients. Made it with chick peas, made it with red kidney beans..all good. Keeps well in the refrigerator. Spread on whole grain bread for a good snack.

i put 2 and half cups of fresh-cooked white beans (boiled with 2 garlic cloves and bay leaves) in the processor with all ingredients exc dill -- none on hand. amped up the cumin, zest, lots more lemon juice, considerable salt and pepper (since beans not canned) and a couple shakes of tabasco. the lemon + cumin + mint is a good combination -- just needs to be made a little more assertive. tasty stuff.

This is great! So easy and delicious Goes with chips, crackers, and veggies. I think it tastes better a day after you make it, after the flavors have blended overnight in the fridge. I made it for a party and used the leftovers as an improvised salad dressing for my cold chicken salad.

This dish is amazing and so simple to make. Big crowd favorite - great with potato chips (homemade or store bought), veggies and pita chips

I made this for an appetizer on Thanksgiving, and everyone loved it! I served with baby carrots, celery and pita wedges. I will definitely make this again soon.

Yumm. Left out the garlic and my garlic loving family still raved, as did everyone at the party. (looks better garnished with fresh mint)

I thought this was so tasty...and my friends who were foodies at my party also loved it. But...it doesn't look very appetizing and therefore didn't appeal to the less adventurous. I had a lot left over. I served with toasted whole wheat pita triangles, lightly salt/peppered and brushed with olive oil. The nutty taste and texture complimented this very nicely!

This dip was so easy to whip up from ingredients that I tend to have around that I'd make it again...but next time I'd leave out the garlic and add a little more lemon juice. Overall it was good, but not great.

I love this with my own variations. I think garlic way overpowers the delicate herb and lemon taste, so I leave it out completely. But I increase the lemon and lemon zest. Party guests will not be left with garlic breath! Try it without garlic and you'll be surprised how dazzling and bright the flavor is. I agree it should chill overnight. Also, play around with other herbs. Rosemary and lemon are great partners for white beans too. But make sure you salt and pepper it well. Beans can take a lot of seasoning.

Simple and delicious. I brought this as an appetizer to a dinner party and every single person raved! A keeper! (I added a bit more garlic and 3T white wine as recommended. Herbs on top not a must but make for nicer presentation)

A nice change from hummus. Didn't have dill & used thyme instead with additional garlic. Easy and very tasty.

I made this dip and served it with crudites and pita triangles. It disappeared. I inadvertently forgot to sprinkle the herbs on it before serving, but my guests never knew the difference.

Really great dip! I added about 3 tablespoons white wine and increased the lemon zest and mint. The flavors are much better once the dip has sat overnight.

Nice taste and easy to make. My guests also thought it was hummus. (I cut the herbs to 1 teaspoon each and only used 1/4 teaspoon lemon zest.)

This is a great dip. Made it for a party and asked for ratings - many people thought it was hummus - but lighter and creamier. I am definitley adding it to my permanent file.
