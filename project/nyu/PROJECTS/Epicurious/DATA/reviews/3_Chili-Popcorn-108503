Very tasty and the right amount of spice - but we kept coughing because of the chili powder! Not sure how to avoid that

We like this combination--simple yet nice flavor. I don't use butter on my popcorn and it can be a bit dry, but family really enjoys the spices on buttered popcorn--I think white popcorn is the best. Importantly, as I find in most recipes here, I double the spices!

The seasonings weren't a steller hit on popcorn, a bit bland if you ask me. Although, I tried this mix on fried potatoes & chicken. & it was much better. Definitely a keeper in those catagories compared to spicing up popcorn.

This tastes a lot like taco seasoning, and I always loved to put taco seasoning on popcorn.
