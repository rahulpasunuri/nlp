I was a little disappointed in this recipe. I found the lamb to be very gamey tasting, so if you like that, then this recipe would work for you. I would have liked this cut of meat better marinated first. I also found it to be extremely rare with the cooking time/temperature. It was better the next day. Potatoes were amazing!

If I made this again, I would omit the gravy. I think it obscured the interesting flavors of the olives, lemon, et.

Made this for Easter - I loved it, but boyfriend, who is not a huge fan of lamb, thought it was only okay. I boned my leg of lamb (made stock with the bone) and doubled the amount of paste so I could spread it inside and out. Delicious! I used garlic stuffed olives as a time saver and added rosemary to the mixture. Potatoes were fabulous. I also doubled the gravy by using more flour and some of the lamb stock I made. A keeper! To those who found the cooking time to be too short, I cooked mine for almost the exact time specified, which brought it to 135 internally, and it was overdone to my taste. Use a meat thermometer!

Great Recipe. As other reader wrote, the cooking time is off. I like lamb on the rare side, but this recipe barely cooked the lamb. I added approx/ another 45 minutes. Potatoes are awesome. Served this with a side of roasted red peppers and country greek salad. great combination

This recipe was delicious! Everyone raved about it. I had a couple of doubts about the green olives, but it was perfect. I boned the leg of lamb myself and put the olive paste in the lamb, then tied it before roasting it. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and it turned out beautifully.

Very Greek, very delicious. This would be great for company because it takes 15 minutes to prepare but tastes like you spent a long time in the kitchen. I used black olives and eight cloves of garlic. I had a 4.5 lb leg of lamb, but followed the cooking time on the recipe anyway--and the lamb was so rare that I had to put it back in the oven. Definitely lengthen the cooking time. I also used a corningware casserole dish, so the cleanup was easier and the gravy was just as delicious.

This was absolutely fabulous. All the melding of flavors was beyond compare. For the gravy, I added a little Dijon mustard, and Worcestershire sauce to make it richer. I would make this again in a nano second. Wonderful.

Delicious! The potatoes were nice and crispy and the gravy savory. I added thyme sprigs which added depth. The lemon brought out nice flavor. My Brazilian husband thought it scrumptious.

Re pitting olives . . . .place olive on cutting board and crush using a ramekin or other small, flat bottomed dish. Makes the job very easy.

The green olives really make this dish, it is now one of my husbands favorites.

A wonderful recipe, a perfect combination of easy preparation and exceptional outcome. Nicely complex flavor springs from the combo of simple ingredients.

This was so delicious, I'm about to make it yet again! I used lamb steaks instead of leg. Cuts down on cooking time. Added a little lamb stock to yeild more gravy. Absolutely fantastic!!!

The cooking time on the lamb could be extended quite a bit, to get it a bit more tender. Other than that, yummy!

This was a very simple recipe that provided a unique flavor to the lamb.

This year I tried your lamb on Tian recipe, and it was delicious. However, last Easter & the Easter before that, I used this recipe. My grandson who was then 6 & 7years old helped with the olive rub & peeling & mixing the potatoes. The family loved it! Next year it will be hard to decide which one I will use.

I loved this recipe. For an easy time saver I found green olive stuffed w/ garlic and pureed those. Also, I did add more fresh herbs as we like really spicy food. I used boneless leg of lamb and smeared the olive paste all over the inside as well. I say spice to fit your own taste. The gravy was different. I loved it , but I am not sure if everyone would. It is different.Also my yield was low on the gravy. Any suggestions?

Very nice indeed. If anyone wants the variation which is ROAST LEG OF LAMB COOKED IN THYME AND FINISHED WITH FRESH ROSEMARY then email me. / Basically basted with tomato puree, oil and thyme sauce three times and after 1-1.5hrs, fresh rosemary twigs placed over for last 15-20mins. Make it every December 31st. I use lemon grass instead of lemon (less acid). Cheers

While I am only giving it two forks, I will make it again and use some of the other cooks' ideas. The flavors were good but I overcooked the lamb so it turned out tough. I like the idea of stuffing the lamb with the tapenade. Marinating sounds good too with basting to keep moist.

I have to agree that the olive spread should be used as a stuffing rather than as a topping, and the roasting time should be longer. I found this rather bland, much different from what I had expected, and was a little disappointed. There are more interesting ways to prepare lamb ...

My rating of this recipe is based on changes I made to the recipe. First, I used a boned leg of lamb and I doubled the olive, lemon zest mixture, using it as a tapenade stuffing/seasoning. I reformed and tied the meat and let the tapenade do its work, while at the same time marinading the lamb in some chopped onion and a bottle of chardonnay. Roasted at 275 to well done (about 4.5 hours), this lamb was wonderful (in my opinion, lamb needs to be well done and the slow roasting ensures that, as well as tender, moist meat, not to mention hours of wonderful aroma). I will do again but will probably make extra tapenade to serve as a condiment with the lamb.

I loved this! I would defiantly make it again. Then only draw back is pitting the olives. I'm sure there is an easier way to pit the olives I just couldn't figure one out so it took a while but once I got that done the rest only took minutes. Everything else was very easy. The meat tasted great and taste even better warmed up.

This is the most delicious lamb recipe I have used where it is not a necessity for hours of marinade. The taste of the olive paste is better than the traditional garlic-infused versions of spice, but delicate enough not to overcome the taste of the lamb. Delicious!

I think this is one of the best lamb recipes I've ever encountered. Instead of rubbing the olive mixture over the lamb, after deboning the lamb, I spread the mixture over the flat butterflied meat and then tied up the roast. When sliced, the guests were certain to get more of this special olive mixture. Originally, I served this to my guinea pig friends, then to my catering clients. Try this one. I'm sure you'll find it a keeper. I did.

Very good. I cooked it slightly longer than the 1 hour recommended in the recipe and it turned out a wonderful medium rare.

Although this was good, I am returning to my original method for roasting: my effort with this recipe ended up overcooked - inclement weather and other problems delayed my guests. I learned from grandma to roast anything as follows: 300F oven one hour (this kills surface bacteria). Reduce oven to temp you want internal to end at - i.e. 130F and roast. This is more like "acclimating" the meat to the desired temp, much as you bring something to room temp. The theory behind this is that fat cooks faster than meat and reaches higher temps. It constricts, squeezing out juices. To keep a more tender meat, this slow cooking permits all to cook through without the constriction. I like this, not only because it produces a more flavorful, tender meat, but because it is a more flexible and forgiving method, in terms of time. One can always turn the temp up - but this takes a long time. You can get your meat off the counter early while you work on the other dishes. Try it once - with any kind of meat. Adele Davis gives more accurate times based on meat types and poundage, but I never have to refer to it. Just put it on early and slow, and adjust upwards when necessary.

Everyone loved and keeps asking me to make this again. I tried it with black olives as well and everyone thought it was equally as wonderful.

Absolutely the best leg of lamb I've ever made. I did not have any white wine for the gravy, so I substituted a light dry red wine with excellent results. I was a little worried about the garlic overpowering the lamb, but it was great!! Two of my guests requested the recipe. I will be happy to serve this ne again.
