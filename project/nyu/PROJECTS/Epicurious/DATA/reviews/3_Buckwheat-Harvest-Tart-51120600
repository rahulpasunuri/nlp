I already had a crust so I just used mine and this recipe is super good! I must say I was a bit surprise by the taste.

The prep is very important as there are a lot of components. My buckwheat didn't hold together well after chilling and I ended up patting it into the pan. It wasn't a problem. Once made, it's delicious!

This tart was delicious, but it does take a lot of work. The prep is worth it.
