Substituted greek yogurt for mayo and black kale (or any other tender kale) for romaine lettuce. Delish! The kale and yogurt are strong enough to support one another. Makes for a hearty, quick & easy, entree salad.

Whoa. It's just a salad. And not much of one. The only "green" thing in it is Romain lettuce. Regardless of percieved authenticity the dressing has to be better than anything you can get in the supermarket, or even a boutique kitchen shop. It's fresh. I would like to know however, what a good substitute for the anchovies would be. For vegetarians. Any suggestions. Or, is just leaving them out OK?

I gave this recipe 3 forks, because the dressing is just so-so, but the croutons are fabulous. I've been making them often to garnish other salads and soups. They actually enhance the food, unlike those hard, dry, tasteless cubes that seem to get carelessly tossed on top of otherwise lovely dishes.

heh...I knew once I read the list of ingredients in this Caesar salad, that it would be followed by many a "review" written by those with seemingly superior and infinite knowlege stating emphatically that this is not a caesar salad. lol. ...regardless, this ever-so controversially bastardized recipe makes a yummy salad. :)

I just made this salad and it was very good! I omitted the anchovy since I didn't have any on-hand. The dressing was still quite tasty.

Good flavor and easy to make. The croutons are great - lots of garlic! When you toss the salad the 'muddiness' of the balsamic vinegar pretty much disappears.

This was delicious - but I do have a big visual problem with "muddiness" in almost all balsamic dressings. I use the Kirkland brand from Costco which is outrageoulsly full-bodied - but in all dressings the color is awful. Have tried a few white balsamics - and they are not the same. I would appreciate any ideas others could give me!

This was just about the worst Caesar Dressing I have ever made. There are way better ones out there.....keep looking.

I tend to coddle an egg for my caesar (or caesar-ish) dressing, but the mayo really is a good, simple substitute for a lunch salad. This may not be the right choice for company if you are a dressing purist, but hey, who makes 'company quality' food for everyday dining? I roasted the croutons while I went jogging, came home and was eating in under 5 min. Excellent.

Delicious. I followed the recipe exactly. I used a lot less parmesean with this recipe, than with others, but didn't miss the extra cheese- even though I am not willing to sacrifice 'tasty' for 'healthy,' generally speaking. The quantity of dressing was a concern, but I found that a little went a long way. Even though another friend is very proud of his Caesar recipe, a guest said this was even better.

I served this salad lastnight and we all agreed it's wonderful... has such a nice flavor....no arguements of whether it was "real" or not. Really no need to get all bent out of shape about the ingredients when friends gather to share a meal made with love! Yes, I too will be making it often and plan to have the dressing on hand in the fridge. God Bless! Enjoy!

Sheesh- much ado over nothing. I found this recipe good, not great. The debate gets tiring. Add an egg (coddled or not) if you care to. I've worked with James Beard House chefs that have not uttered comments as snotty as I've seen here. No one said this was a "true Caesar"- get over it.

True Caesar, fake Caesar, what does it matter, the dressing is delicious. I plan to use the dressing and croutons with the Blackened Steak Salad recipe from this site. Maybe I'll call it Blackened Steak Caesar Salad!

For you that say that true Caesar salad is just anchovies, coddled egg, garlic, lemon juice, dry mustard and oil, that is actually incorrect. There are many vairations, but the original Caesar belived by most food history experts was invented by Caesar Cardini in Tijuana, Mexico, in 1924, and contained: romaine, garlic, croutons, Parmesan cheese, eggs, olive oil, and Worcestershire sauce... NO MUSTARD OR ANCHOVIES. actually he was supposedly staunchly opposed to having anchovies added. so with this said, almost every person that has said this is not a true Caesar salad, have probably never had a true one themselves!

I had never made caesar salad before and this recipe was so easy! The dressing was wonderful! The croutons were delicious...although next time I will cut the salt in half...the seasoning was a bit salty. Other than that....this recipe was absolutely delicious!

Hi from Australia. I made this salad to go with cold corned beef, it was delicious.

Authenticity set aside, the dressing was flavorful and delicious. The croutons were also quite good.

Ah, the great Caesar Salad debate . . . . best of both worlds: the food snobs get to strut their "superb food intellect" even though this recipe clearly makes no claims to be authentic; and the ignorant people who fear that even being in the same room with a raw or coddled egg will kill them and their entire family, when in truth you have better odds of winning the lottery. So that leaves the rest of us who can sit back and laugh at all the yahoos, comfortable in the knowledge that we can make good decisions about what we eat and feed our families for ourselves.

Good grief! For those who are criticizing this recipe to death because it isn't a "traditional" recipe for Caesar Salad Dressing, please stop being so anal and just enjoy a tasty salad dressing recipe. Ever heard of adapting a recipe to suite individual taste? That is how new flavours are invented.

Not Ceasar, not even a variation, but quite good. Second time I made it I added quartered pear tomatoes that I deseeded. will keep on making it!

Thought this was a nice variation of the Caesar dressing. It is what it is, a spin off from the basic Caesar and the name is clear and forthright. It is a Caesar with a twist. To those reviewers caught up in the name, why don't you try it and review the recipe instead.

We thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. The garlic didn't overpower it, which often happens with many caesar dressings. Will make this often. It's a keeper.

Very good variation. Will make it again. Ms.Grits! This is a VARIATION, and a good one. EVERYONE knows the BASIC recipe for Ceasars.

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but certainly will. But to the aficionados out there... true caeser salad dressings have lemon juice not vineger, no oregano, just anchovies, coddled egg, garlic, lemon juice, dry mustard and oil.

You would make your own croutons but not "boil an egg" (really, you'd only coddle it) because there is a health risk from undercooked foods for people with various health conditions or the very young or elderly. DUH!!! Not everyone has access to pasteurized eggs in the shell, either.

The dressing is wonderful. The balsamic gives it a very nice flavor. Easy to make and I will do so often. Used anchovy paste instead of fillets.

Very good. Easy. That was my first try at making homemade Caesar and my testers loved it. To closetcook, If I am not mistaken, traditional dressing is made with raw egg and some people won't eat that.

I believe that Alexis is right on the "ball". The dressing may not be Caesar, however, it is simple to make and is delicious

So why would you go to the trouble to make your own croutons and then not be bothered boiling an egg to make real caesar salad dressing?

At first glance this recipe calls for an exorbitant amount of mayonnaise as well as balsamic vinegar (perhaps to offset the mayonnaise). My family has been making caesar salad almost every night for 20 years. We have tried many versions but always resort to the tried and true. We never measure but go on taste. One consistency is always use red wine vinegar instead of the over powering balsamic. Use a seasoned woooden caesar salad bowl. Scrunch garlic (1.5 - 2 cloves) and anchovies (same) on the bottom sides of the bowl, whisk in olive oil (sometimes extra virgin) a dash of red wine vinegar and few shakes of worcestershire and a generous tablespoon helping of dijon. Whisk to combine. Taste. Toss the very dry greens gently and as little as possible. Serve immediately always with Parmigiano reggiano. There also is a great blender recipe in the Gourmet magazine published YEARS ago. From memory, it calls for many whole anchovies (I think 6) an egg and a generous portion of lemon juice. The best ceasar salad I have ever eaten (should be for 30 dollars) was at the Bull and Bear Waldorf Astoria in NY. The ingredients of the recipe requested included oregano. The server tossed bread crumbs in the dressing before tossing with the greens. Delicious.

Just a question: Where are the anchovies?

I wish people would stop calling romaine lettuce salads "Caesar Salad" when it doesn't have a Ceasar dressing! A Caesar Salad is a very specific thing and this isn't a Caesar.

Just mediocre, in my opinion.
