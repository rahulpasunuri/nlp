I am concerned that anyone would eat a hamburger that is not thoroughly cooked. The Medium Rare worries me.

Wow. As a burger lover I always used my soy sauce, groud ginger & powdered garlic for my recipe. Tonight I chose this--the dumb bunny simple. Just to test it. We closed our eyes & were in our favorite buger shack. The condiments were enhancing--not over powering. The burger meat is the center of attention. If you want the meat to taste like blue cheese or whatever--fine. But if you want a HAMBURGER, this is the recipe. And I am considered a "gormet cook"

the secret ingredient: salt. last night we picked up some burgers from the local butcher, and did nothing to them, grilled them and boring! today i set sail on epicurious expecting some 10 step process to make my burgers great, and here it was in one word- salt. it really brought out the flavor beautifully. added some cheddar cheese, put it on an english muffin and boom. was almost as good as shake shack in nyc. sometimes simple is best. didn't even have the mesquite.

About as useful as the instructions on a handiwipe "Open and use." or perhaps "buy meat, put on grill, eat meat"

Good basic recipe. Anybody that can grill should know how to cook "Michael's Burgers"

This is from a cook in California who is severely annoyed by a cook from Indianapollis. First of all, this is a fantastic, if basic recipe. It has very good flavor. Second, why the hell do you boil a perfectly good hotdog?????

Granted, it's simple, but that's the point. I was browsing for different hamburger recipes and found this one, and figured I would try it. It is delicious--We didn't have mesquite but grilled on our gas grill. The gentle handling of the freshly ground meat and the ample salt brings out the flavor of the meat. A great fix if you're craving a hamburger!

Let me save you from reading the reviews. Some are noteworthy and some people just don't get it. I wonder if the people who write the asinine comments conduct themselves in the same manner in public? Hhhhmmmmm, I wonder...It's a great recipe written exactly as is. And remember, recipes are ONLY guides! Make them you're own and stop bitching!

Yes, less is more. The flavor in this recipe is the flavor of the meat. The determinant of that is the quality of the meat (aged prime chuck will taste better than supermarket "ground beef"). "Better" cuts have less fat, but generally less flavor, also.

Just to respond to "A Cook on 01/07/04". I am college senior who is studying microbiology at UCLA. These people are not wackos when they are worrying about e.coli. One of my instructors gave us his recipe for cooking a rare burger. Get the freshest piece of unground meat (steak or chuck) you can find. Sear the outside of the meat in hot pan. This will kill the bacteria on the surface of the meat. Then grind the meat and cook your burger as soon as possible. Even there's still a chance of bacteria, not just e. coli still be alive in your burger. I myself would much rather get a burger at In-N-Out.

This method is so bland. I expect Michael also gives intructions on how to make a glass of chocolate milk. Whay is this in here?

The # of forks is not important. But what is, this is a simple, quick & easy recipe I have used over & over. While it's fun to experiment with various ingredients, you don't always have the time. So my point - enjoy the simple things of life once in a while :)

Just a comment to add to those below worried about the safety of hamburger. Even if you grind your own, you still run the risk of e-coli unless you cook to well done. The reason for this: The outside of the piece of meat you are so carefully grinding at home may still have been exposed! The grinding then mixes it throughout the meat. Any burger, regardless of the meat source, should always be well done. (Steak can be rare, it only needs the outer layer cooked to kill the e-coli.)

I totally & completely agree w/ EVERYTHING said by "A Cook on 8/8/02". Commercial hamburger meat is deadly - full of disease & bacteria, thanks to careless processing. AND, what a stupid, pointless recipe! This is almost better than the 1 for boiled water! But it IS refreshing to know that somewhere, amongst all the annoying pop-up ads on this site, is someone with a dark sense of humor. This IS laughable, at best.

WORST. HAMBURGER. EVER.

After reading the reviews all I have to say is what a bunch of whiners. This is just a good simple way to make a hamburger. If you change the recipe and add all those other ingredients then submit another recipe. Everyone needs to read a good grilling book by James Beard. I know a guy that puts Tabasco sauce on everything too.

Don't give me this "simplest is best" line and don't insult me with a K-tel reference! Yes, if you want baby food (i.e. no flavor), this is it, but when you eat a hamburger, you want to taste flavor and this has none. Find another recipe. p.s. if you aren't using meat that you ground yourself, NEVER cook to less than medium! Ground beef, due to meat processing plants "standards", can harbor many bacteria.

Try 1 pound of ground chuck to 5 ounces ground sirloin and make 4 hamburgers from that. Read this in a cooking magazine (Fine Cooking), and have used it ever since. Also helps if you can buy the ground meat from a good meat market. Yes, sometimes simple is best.

Best hamburger ever. Simple & excellent. Add nothing to the burger. Feel free on condiments.

My husband and I both have found that we like our burgers much more after reading Michael's "secrets". I had always bought a leaner meat and we also formed our patties too much and pressed on them while cooking! The result of using the chuck, lots of salt and pepper and then gently forming the patties has really paid off!! Sometimes nothing is better than a good burger with good fresh toppings!! You taste more this way!

If you are a REAL hamburger lover then this is the ultimate recipe. Sometimes less IS more! If you are a pretender then try adding a lot of other stuff to your ground beef and form patties in a K-TEL Patty Maker!

While this qualifies as a recipe, it is as basic as: 1. put water in pot 2. Heat to boil 3. insert hotdog.

I use ground sirloin, it's substantially better than ground chuck.

I have been making grilled burgers using ground chuck, salt and pepper, for years, and when mesquite became fashionable some time back tried using it with the burgers. I found it added a slightly bitter taste that is not terribly appealing. To my palate, hickory is much better.

Hi, I don't mean to be one of those that adds to the "Comments" section without making the recipe, but an interesting side note to this recipe is that it was submitted to Gourmet magazine by the editor's husband, who is admittedly not a gourmet cook. The editor, Ruth Reichl, refers to "Michael's Hamburgers" in the magazine's opening comments and includes his recipe because it is simple, freshly ground and their family enjoys it. The cover photo for June's Gourmet is a lucious looking hamburger! I think the mesquite chips probably give it a lot of flavor.

I agree with the review. I haven't made the hamburger and I would probably add something else to spice it up. I hate it when a recipe recieves 4 forks and the person who rates it adds their own rendition of the recipe. I think the key to this recipe is in the 'freshly ground' meat. It's also the ratio of lean to fat in the meat that makes the difference.

I always watch for the new recipes and when I saw this one all I could think of was - here we go, this will probably take up a place in the "most comment" section of this site by people who feel compelled to complain and make snide remarks about its simplicity. Can some just view it, use it if you would like - and review only if they actually prepared the recipe - I did only so I felt I could respond - it was okay, but we like more spice in our burgers.
