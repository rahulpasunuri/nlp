Unbelievable. Cold, sweet, spicy, tangy - a taste sensation. Sorbet is highly recommended. I served with tropical sorbet.

This is very very good. Vanilla bean had gotten a bit dry, but it reconstituted nicely in the hot syrup. Used a Sherelle melon (pale cantaloupe type); hate to waste, so strained the seeds when I scooped them out to save the juice. The juice wasn't very sweet, but when I added some of this syrup: WOW. Cantaloupe juice, this syrup, and some vodka would be INSANE. Just a thought. As is, the dish makes a great light dessert, or simple but fancy breakfast item.

A wonderfully refreshing summertime finisher. I didn't have a vanilla bean so I used some pure vanilla extract and it still tasted great. Even with a not-so-sweet honeydew it was excellent. And simple to make!

I could eat this for breakfast, lunch, and/or dinner. If you already think you'll like it, you're right!
