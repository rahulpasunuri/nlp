This was a really great receipe. I found it yielded only 6 cakes not eight and I was pretty precise. A great leftover sandwich the next day. Toast some bread of your choice, add shredded lettuce, sliced tomato and remoulde sauce (Boar's Head is great) ! Don't reheat in microwave it comes out mushy, use traditionl oven or toaster oven

Good stuff! Followed the advice of others, put the bread in a food processor, added closer to a cup to the mix and let it set overnight. I made mini crab cakes, and they stuck together fine and tasted delicious.

I used Panko crumbs, and it was tasty, but the crab cakes didn't hold together. I made them ahead and reheated them at 300F for 15 minutes. I added fresh basil to the store bought fresh salsa. It was very good, but we will still make the Downeast crab cakes with curry from another source.

I had trouble getting these cakes to hold together. Next time, I'll try forming them and then refrigerating for a while to let some liquid drain off. We like our crab cakes very crabby, so I significantly cut down on the onions, bell pepper, and mustard. Also, I used cilantro (about 1 T) instead of basil. With these changes, I thought the flavoring was excellent.

This turned out fantastic. I served it with the basil aioli sauce from this website which brought out the basil really nicely. I also used panko breadcrumbs instead of fresh since I was short on time. But they ended up delish. I would make the patties smaller so people can pick them up. Mine were too large and required a fork and knife.

We all really liked this. Included 2 kids. I didn't do the peppers and used Panko instead of breadcrumbs to coat. I also used 1/4 cup instead of 1/2 to make the cakes. Very easy and delicious.

I've always had fresh dungeness crab on salads. Due to a large abount of fresh dungeness crab I decided to try something different. My family loved it! The cakes didn't fall apart and the crab didn't lose its distinct flavor. I will make it again.

Excellent!! I made these in a hurry with canned crab, 2% fat mayo, and store bought crumbs (I'm a huge fan of fresh crumbs but when you are out of time...) I made them smaller (1/4 cup)placing them on a plate in the freezer for a few minutes as I made the others and fried them up with no problem. I've had crab cakes fall apart on me in the past and these were no problem. I skipped the salsa due to lack of time and whipped up a quick side of mayo, ketsup, relish and hot sauce. Less than half an hour from start to table and delicious.

Made this as one of my "seven fishes" for Christmas eve. It was marvelous! I followed the tip from the Warren cook to partial fry a day in advance and then reheat in the oven. No loss of flavor at all and they did not dry out. It's the fresh breadcrumbs that do the trick. Squeeze them a bit when forming the patties so you can easily turn when frying. Deeelicious!

This recipe worked out great! I used a 1/4 cup of 1/4 inch cubed french bread instead of crumbs in the mixture. This made the cakes lighter, everyone loved them!

This is an excellent recipe which I have prepared many times for my friends and family and they love it! I do divide them into 1/4 cup portions instead. At times,I also prepare them ahead of time by cooking them only about three minutes per side and then re-heating them on a cookie sheet in the oven for about 15 minutes at 300*. They turn out wonderful every single time and it saves alot of time especially if serving at a party. I suggest serving with basil aioli(great recipe also found on this web site...you'll love it!!!!!) Enjoy or "smachnoho!" as we say in Ukrainian.

This was delicious and so easy!! I had a dinner party, all of my guests wanted to know where I got the recipe. I mixed all ingredients together the night before(except bread crumbs) These cakes did not fall apart like some. I added 1/3 cup more bread crumbs. Also I doubled this recipe to serve 8 people had a lot left over. Definately a keeper.

I thought all the herbs and flavoring kind of overpowered the crab flavor. I did use canned crab, so perhaps I was starting out with less than steller crab. I did have trouble keep the cakes together, even though I made it a day ahead and had ample fridge time.

Delicious! This recipe is excellent. This was my first attempt at crab cakes and everyone loved them - even my guest from Maryland! I made these in appetizer sizes for a group of 6. I would recommend an additional 1/4 cup bread crumbs (MUST be fresh) to help keep the cakes together. Putting the cakes in the fridge definitely helps to keep them together. I also cooked the cakes in butter only, this gave them a GREAT brown color.

I like to search this site when I have an idea of something that I want to cook for dinner or for a dinner party. I have many crab cake recipes that we quite like but I thought I would give this site a try. Found this recipe and we liked it enormously. Will make these again for sure!! I also had bought a HOT salsa by mistake and since my husband doesn't like hot food I considered not serving it with the crab cakes but in the end went ahead anyway. "Ooh that's hot", he said and proceed to gobble it all up. I didn't bother to mention that it was the hot salsa!

These crab cakes are fantastic! We followed the recipe exactly and had no problems with them staying together. We served with corn on the cob, and a green salad--easy, delicious dinner! We'll definitely make these again.

After reading the earlier reviews about the cakes falling apart, the following worked for me: used very high quality canned backfin crab, diced the vegetables (instead of chopped) used the blender to make finely ground fresh bread crumbs, and added an extra handful of the breadcrumbs to the crab mixture. I cooked them in a big cast-iron skillet, and they held together beautifully - we cooked a double recipe and not one fell apart. Also, by accident I ended up using fresh wheat bread instead of french, and it was very tasty; especially the crispy pan-fried surface! Served with basil aioli (also found on Epicurious) Everyone loved them - even someone that swears he NEVER eats canned crab!!! :) A definate repeat recipe.

The taste & texture on these is great. The only reason I selected 3 forks vs. 4 is that they are very difficult to handle in the pan. I'm a very experienced cook and had a pretty difficult time turning the cakes and retaining their shape. Everyone loved them.

Excellent. They do tend to fall apart; make sure you chop your red peppers finely and that will help. They're pretty good without the salsa, but I found the tomatoes really added something.

Difficult to get the mixture to hold together. Cut amount of breadcrumbs down by, at least, one cup.

These crab cakes were simply the best I have ever made. If you like crab cakes with more than just breadcrumbs, mayonnaise and crab, then these are for you. This recipe makes crab cakes that don't taste too heavy because of the veggie content. I have made these for numerous occasions and people can't get enough of them.

The best yet. I value brutally honest reviews on this Web site and in that spirit, I have to say these cakes are excellent - even on their own (I didn't serve with salsa). But you'll need far less bread crumbs for dredging.
