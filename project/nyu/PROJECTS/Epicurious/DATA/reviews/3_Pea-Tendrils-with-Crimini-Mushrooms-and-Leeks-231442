Fabulous! I added a little water while cooking and I served it over quinoa. Highly recommended.

I couldn't find pea tendrils in november, so used baby spinach and added a chopped yellow pepper. it went very well with the moroccan chicken i made.

It was a nice dish for a change of pace, and a good excuse to get me to check out the local Asian supermarket, which I definitely enjoyed. And I personally liked the leeks... However I added the mushrooms a little earlier than the recipe suggested, and added a dash of chicken broth. I like my mushrooms cooked down.

We did leave out the leeks and I thought the dish was very delicious.

I would make it again, however, I would leave out the leeks. The sweet flavor of the pea tendrils is overpowered and doesn't need enhancement by leeks. It can be a delicate dish wihout them or a heartier dish with them.
