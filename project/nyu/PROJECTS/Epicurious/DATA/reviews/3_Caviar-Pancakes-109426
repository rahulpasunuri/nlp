So good! I made a shredded beet salad to go along with it and ended up with a wonderful dinner.

I found this recipe as I was flipping through an old Gourmet looking for a different recipe. sounded good so we just had it for brunch--great flavors, easy to make (once you get everything together). It would be fun to have for a Brunch party.

I did not like the flavor combination of pancakes, sour cream, and caviar. The egg yolk and browned butter make it worse. I would not make this recipe again.

I've made this dish twice before and will make it again, tomorrow, for Mothers' Day. It makes a beautiful presentation and everyone that I have served it to was extremely complimentary.

Had some caviar that was a gift and decided to give this recipe a try. Followed it almost to the letter, adding some grated lemon zest to the sour cream and it was superb! Served it as an appetizer for a special aniversary/Valentine's dinner with champagne cocktails and got rave reviews! Great presentation and flavor!

What, taco shells took that day off? Pancakes are too thick for this recipe as is. I used won ton wraps instead with success.
