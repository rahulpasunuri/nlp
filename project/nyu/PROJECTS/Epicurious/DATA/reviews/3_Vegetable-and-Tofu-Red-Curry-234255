This is a good basic recipe. Suggestions - first saute the tofu so it is browned. I used fresh veggies (snow peas, portabella mushrooms, little corn, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots) I also added more curry paste than called for. Next time, I will make it even spicier because it was a bit bland. Nice easy dish to make!

This curry was a bit too watery. The fish sauce at the end overpowered the flavors of the dish. Also, I prefer my curries less salty and more spicy.

This recipe was amazing. The only thing I changed was the amount of curry paste. I added 3 tablespoons instead of 2 teaspoons. I LOVE curry.

I agree with the reviewer who suggested adding sugar, chili sauce, chili flakes, ginger, and more curry. I made it and it was amazing. Don't let the 3 forks review deter you.

As written, this is very bland. I thought it was great, however, with the following modifications: add 2 tsp sugar, 1 TBS curry paste, 2 cloves garlic, and 1 tsp of chinese style chilli sauce. The lime and cilantro are really essential at the end as well. Next time i will mince some ginger and saute that with the onions and garlic. I also uesd fresh veggies - sugar snap peas, sliced carrots and sliced red bell pepper. Very good.

The worst. Living in the Bay Area we have so many great restaurants that one can get spoiled. This recipe lacks flavor! It's a quite pathetic attempt at Thai food. I would never waste ingredients on it again. That bad.

This recipe was good, and I didn't even have to go to the store to get any ingredients! It is perfect for a weeknight supper. I used 1 tablespoon curry paste and two large cloves of garlic, plus the lime, cilantro, and fish sauce, and it was flavorful without being too spicy. My husband liked it and said he would eat it again (and he is not a tofu person). Something about the coconut milk makes the tofu extra creamy and smooth. Be sure to use firm and not extra firm tofu.

This was ok but didn't have any real flavor I usually expect from curry. I don't think I would make it again even though it was pretty quick.

This turned out very good. For the vegetables I used fresh carrot and mushrooms sliced in about 1/4 in slices and fresh red pepper cut into 1/2 in pieces. I also dry fried the tofu in 1/2 in slices until a nice mottled brown crust formed which I then cut into 1/2 cubes. I used twice the amount of curry (we eat things very spicy in our house) and served it over quinoa. The flavors were really clean and bold. The lime (I used lemon) and cilantro round out the dish nicely.

This is a good recipe to use as a guideline for how to make Thai red curry, but I wouldn't follow it exactly. My curry, paste, for example, is quite mild (Tesco brand, in the UK), so I needed about 2 tablespoons/can of coconut milk. I'm sure that packaged curry pastes vary considerably, so add yours to taste. I also would only use fresh vegetables, unless you're in a big hurry. Lastly, I'd say it's pretty important to sear the tofu in a pan with a little oil (until browned on all sides) before adding, otherwise it tends to disintegrate in the sauce. Definitely give the recipe a try, though, because it's easier to make Thai curries at home than you might think!

this was very, very bland. I was extremely disappointed.

This was a HUGE hit, AND it was easy to make low-fat while boosting the nutritional content. Following the recipe almost to the letter, I substituted low-fat coconut milk (reduced 50% of the fat content) and used a variety of fresh veggies including red pepper, carrots, bean sprouts, broccoli, basil, eggplant, + the baby corn and frozen peas. I also substituted brown rice, and the dish was a HUGE hit with my guests. Serve it with a little cucumber salad, and you have an instant easy meal. I agree with the others that it needs salt, lime, and cilantro to give it the extra kick. (thanks for the tip on frying the tofu first!)

I also made it into a green curry because I had green paste. I used bok choy, Chinese leaf (lettuce) and a red pepper (all fresh). Easy, peasy, double squeezy.

Great meal. we kept the basics, but switched to 3 tsp green curry paste, chopped bok choy, fresh mushrooms, baby corn, cauliflower, and freshly chopped ginger. We also switched out to noodles...voila!

This is a perfect weekday meal. Couldn't be easier and so delicious. Better than any takeout! I substituted shallot for onion which were great. The lime at the end really kicks it into high gear.

You HAVE to add the fish sauce, and I definitely recommend adding other veggies (I like broccoli). For those that said the sauce was too thin, you have to serve it with brown rice!

This was OK, but the sauce tasted like hot coconut milk and otherwise didn't have much flavor. It was quick to prepare, though. I might try it again using some ginger in addition to more garlic, and adding the cilantro as suggested in the recipe.

This dish was fine, but lacked a lot of the flavor I normally expect from red curry. (Although to be fair, I did omit the fish sauce.) I used firm tofu, and I browned it before adding it to the curry, which helped keep the tofu together. The sauce was also a lot thinner than I expected, so if I were to make this again I might omit the last 1/4 c. water and boil it a little longer.

This was quite hot, but it didn't have much flavor beyond that. Not really worth the ingredients.

This was a nice, easy and relatively quick dinner. Added frozen garden peas for color but otherwise followed recipe but next time would brown tofu before combining - the tofu as written wasn't firm enough.

Followed the recipe just as written, and liked it. A really easy weeknight dinner, and faster than waiting for takeout!
