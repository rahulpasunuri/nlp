These were so much fun! I only refrigerated dough for one hour. I used flour to make it less tacky when rolling it out. I used cookie cutters to do two hearts, but also other cookie cutters and used a knife to hollow out insides. I smashed peppermint candy canes between a dish towel and put very fine layers of candy making sure not layered higher than the dough. It is fun to watch them bake. Takes about 8 minutes and if any bubbling starts to occur, pull them out. After one minute cooling you can slide a ribbon through the candy without touching to have something to hang it by. A few more minutes and you can trim any excess candy, but don't wait to long or it will be too hard to trim. The mint and ginger bread made for a yummy combination of flavored, will make every year!

I wish I had read the other reviews before I started this. I liked the concept and thought it would be a fun thing to do with the kids, but as others have commented the dough was extremely crumbly and difficult to work. I ended up making all the ropes and let the kids shape them and fill with the candies. I gave this two forks because, despite the problems, the kids had a great time and the end result was OK. They also thought the cookies tasted good even though they were bulky and strange. I will look for a different ornament cookie recipe for next year.

This was a great idea, but we followed the recipe to the letter and our dough was so crumbly that we couldn't form ropes small enough to make shapes. We rolled them in sugar and flattened them to make a gingersnap type cookie, but it was still awful. Definitely needs more butter and probably some white sugar as well. That being said - it was a great idea and I will probably make the ornaments using a butter cookie dough.

Terrible. The dough was tacky after 12 hours in the fridge. When I used a scant amount of flour it was overly dry. No matter how thin I rolled out the "lead" when baking it swelled up and looked horrid. I finally gave up and let my nephews and nieces have fun with it. I used life savers like the recipe called for and crushed them with a mallet. The end taste.. aweful. Even the kids didn't want to eat them after the first bite. My suggestion, follow some of the other posters and use cookie cutters and different candy. As the recipe is they're horrible. So bad I took the time to register just so I could warn others.

Another option, add crumbled candy cane in place of broken colored candies. A very festive result and they melt perfectly.

I found these incredibly easy to make. I think the estimate of how many cookies can be made from one batch is off - I consistently got about 60-70 cookies from each batch and had to use double the amount of Jolly Ranchers called for. I did handle the dough differently than the original recipe called for - I just broke off pieces from the dough and rolled out each shape individually with my hands. You can see the technique I used here: http://www.storiography.com/journal/gingerbread-ornaments/ I also found Jolly Ranchers to be much better than Life Savers for both color and transparency.

Impress your friends with these beautiful, easy to make cookies. Follow the recipe exactly and refridgerate for a few hours. You won't really need flour to roll the dough. I recommend 1/4 inch rope because they spread. Jolly Ranchers worked very well for "stained glass." If you want ornament hoops, leave a little extra dough for loops and use a tooth pick to reform the hole after you pull the cookies out of the oven.

Use cold dough, minimal working with your hands, easy on the flour. I use a silpat instead of foil...will never stick. Be creative. that is what it is all about. I love this season!

I make these every year - Try using cookie cutters: Stars 1 large and cut the inside with a smaller star. remove the center cookie dough. Please the small star cutter back down and use that as a guide to fill in with the crushed candies. Jolly rancher melt the best.

As written, this recipe does not work.There is no way one can make anything that looks like the picture. The dough spreads, making the "lead" about 3/4 of an inch wide even when rolled into a less than 1/4 inch cylinder to lay on the design sketched on the foil. A three year old who had never been in a church or seen stained glass might be happy with the results, but I was not. I have spent the last four hours trying to create something that looked even vaguely like the picture -- to no avail. Piping the dough (hard to do)in less than a 16th of an inch around the design, resulted in something like the photo with the article -- however expect a 50% failure rate getting the cookies off the foil. I went to the web and found several recipes to make stained glass cookies -- the best being a rolled cookie cut in a circle, then having a star cut out of the center. The star was filled with ground candy, resulting in a stained glass edible ornament. I had always assumed that epicurious recipes were tested -- this one clearly was not. I will continue to attempt to "debug" this recipe as the idea is fantastic, and will post any solutions I find.

These cookies were a complete disaster. After having some problems with the first steps (that I complained about in an earlier review), I switched from Jolly Rancher to Life savers candy. It was considerably easier to crush, so I thought all was good. Wrong. After a full 24 hours in the refrigerator, the dough was still too sticky to work with. I liberally floured the work surface, and then the dough immediately dried out, to the point where it crumbled when I tried to roll it into ropes. I ended up rolling it with a pin and using cookie cutters (one big, one small, to leave a space for the candies), and, after ALL of these machinations, the cookies didn't even taste very good. Never, ever will I make this again.

These were a bit of a challenge to make but not impossible. I found the dough rolled out easier at room temperature than cold. They did come out looking a lot like the display picture which was nice. Great as a decoration, however, as a cookie they are a little hard to eat. The candie portion is hard, obviously, but still overall prety as a novelty cookie...give yourself lots of time for these! Oh, and a meat pounder works much better than a rolling pin or blender to crush the candies.

Full disclosure - I haven't actually finished making this yet. That said, it better taste good, because it's a major pain. The dough is sticky and viscous and the candies turned into a brick of sugar in the blender.
