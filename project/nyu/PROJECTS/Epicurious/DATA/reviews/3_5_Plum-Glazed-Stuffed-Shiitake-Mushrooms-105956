Exceptional. So easy and delicious. I added some red pepper flakes and a tb of soy to the glaze. I used crimini mushrooms. Wow, I can probably eat the whole thing by myself.

A go-to appetizer recipe for me. I can my own plum sauce in the summer. It has more flavor and texture than the store bought kind so I can see how some are not fans. I always use baby bellas or white mushrooms and "spicy" sausage. Always a hit with family & friends.

I have saved this recipe for so long as something I have wanted to try, but now that I have I am very disappointed. I think this is a case of a recipe being so simple, that if any ingredient is lacking, the whole thing fails. I couldn't find plum sauce at my grocers, so picked some up at an Asian market. It had no flavor, just a pale, sticky, sweet substance. I would have been better off with apricot jam. The sausage wasn't terribly exciting, so inevitably the finished product was quite dull. I am sure these can be very good with the right ingredients, but this time around they were a waste of time.

Great and easy. Always a crowd pleaser.

My guests all suggested I make this again.We did need plates and forks to eat them as it wasn't finger food as the picture suggests.

Bland! These were fast to prepare, but dreadfully bland. Didn't keep the recipe.

Do you use light sesame oil or dark toasted sesame oil for this recipe. HMMMMM? Any advice?

Used Crimini (baby portobello) and was very good. Since the sausage was mounded it required longer cooking, about 30 minutes.

Made these for a dinner party last night and not one was left, even though they were a bit tricky to eat (wasn't my house but we should have put out forks). Certainly couldn't be easier. I used hot chicken sausage. Definitely a great quick to put together treat.

This was really good. Made it vegetarian with bulk soy sausage.

This is a very simple yet delicious appetizer. My guests loved it. I, too, used Jimmy Dean hot sausage (which isn't very hot.)

EASY AND ELEGANT! I used hot sausage. They looked pretty and tasted great. A wonderful appetizer that tastes like it was a lot of work...but it wasnt. A KEEPER!

Delicious & easy! I used shiitakes and will continue to use them for this recipe (unless I can't find them) since I love the distinct taste. I used 1/2 mild + 1/2 hot Jimmy Dean brand sausage. The hot was weak, so if I use that brand again I'll use all hot. But first I might try another brand and use 1/2 mild + 1/2 hot again. I plan on making this recipe a lot in the future, so I'll keep experimenting.

As the woman drinking cosmos said...this is absolutely fool-proof! I broke the rule about trying something new at a dinner party. I made the mushrooms way too early and just kept them in the oven to warm...they were still perfect! You must try it.

For any novice cook who wants something good and doesn't want to worry about the chances of a dish being a flop, try this. It's delicious, impressive and practically no-fail. I even accidently cooked the sausage before stuffing the mushrooms (too many Cosmopolitans while I was cooking) and it still turned out great. I used half hot sausage and half regular sausage. The fresh, chopped chives on top make a nice presentation. This would look nice served on a square platter.

I served this at my holiday party and it was a hit. It was very simple to prepare, and I cut costs a bit by substituting cremini mushrooms for the shitake, and it worked well.

Excellent. My guests loved this. I had used a little pot sticker stuffing I had left over with pork and bok choy, etc. Plum sauce does make a difference I choose to use a recipe from Emeril and made my own with plum preserves and a few things.

I made these again for the second time this month. Following the advice of someone who posted here, I used baby bellas instead of the shiitakes. Made for a much better presentation. Any nuances of taste between the two mushrooms was minor. I highly suggest the change.

have made this with ground pork and with ground chix and prefer the chicken over the pork any day. The plum sauce IS essential, since i have done it with the wrong kind (the fake kind form Trader Joe's) and it was awful. make sure you got the authentic sticky plum sauce that almost looks like jelly.

Loved these with Crab Meat. Easy to make, prep in advance and cook quickly. What more could you ask for. Oh, yes, everyone loved them...the leftovers were good too. Just 20 secs in the microwave and still good!

A hit during the holiday party. The plum sauce made the dish much better. You must have the right brush to spead the plum sauce, it can get alittle mess. Only a 15 minute hold time...only negative

Had a holiday party...the plum glazed mushrooms were a big hit...My husband loved them...I would definately make them again...and...they are easy...easy... easy...although a little messy if you don't have the right brush...

I liked them! I think this is an appetizer that pleases a variety of palates...The sweetness of the plum sauce was a nice counterpart to the spiciness of the sausage. I also increased the sesame oil by 1/2 tbspn. These are great if your time is limited.

I usually make the original recipe before trying variations; but had fresh crabmeat on hand, so mixed that with sauteed green onions & subbed for the sausage. Very tasty! Used baby bellas for ease of stuffing & guests really enjoyed total package!

This didn't quite meet my expectations but it was ok. Just remember that shiitake mushrooms have a very delicate flavor that you could overpower if you stuff too much sausage or use a sausage that is heavily flavored. But overall, I'd say this is easy to make and I'd make it again for friends over for just drinks.

Received many good comments from guest on this recipe-so simple and yet so good! A plum sauce with a higher sugar content works the best.

Along with the Flank Steak Chimichurri from this same article, these were a hit! Added a bit more seasame oil than what the recipe called for, along with a healthy pinch of red pepper flakes. Liked the added kick.
