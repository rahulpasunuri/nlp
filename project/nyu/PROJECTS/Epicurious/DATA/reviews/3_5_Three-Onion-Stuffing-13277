My sister, mother, and I have made this for the past few Thanksgivings and we all love it. For the cooks that strictly adhere to recipes, this might not turn out well. It's a good base to build on, and we usually call it our five onion dressing (leeks, shallots, garlic, red and white onions - or whatever we have around the kitchen). A lot of times we've added roasted chestnuts, different fresh and/or dried herbs, sauteed pancetta, or anything that sounds good at the time. The bread can be anything you want, but we typically use half sourdough and half cornbread. Have fun with it and don't be afraid to add more salt and broth.

I thought this was terrible. I made it twice thinking I made a mistake the first time. Nope. It tasted just as bad the second time I made it. Like another rater said, with all of those onions, you would think it would have more flavor. I definitely would NOT make it again!

For so many onions, this was pretty bland. I even added more sage and thyme to try to give it more flavor, but it didn't help.

If you like just as many vegetables as bread in your stuffing, then you'll probably enjoy this recipe. I personally like a higher bread-to-veggie ratio in my stuffing, so I added another 5-6 slices and more broth to compensate. Also, I love stuffing in the turkey, so I put about half the stuffing inside the turkey and baked the other half in a buttered dish. The stuffing in the turkey came out too soggy, and the stuffing in the dish came out too dry. Mix them together and Voila! Well, almost. I will revert to my more "traditional" stuffing recipe next Thanksgiving and not cry any "onion tears" over it. ;)

This was an unexpected hit at my Thanksgiving. It was very tasty, and not very difficult to make. I also added some bread to the recipe.

I made this for some friends who insisted that we having stuffing for our mock Thanksgiving, even though we didnt't have turkey. They loved it, even the picky eaters said it was great. Some of them had two and three helpings. I did add more bread, and had to add more broth because of that to keep it moist, but everything else I did according to the recipe. Made it the day before and it worked out wonderfully.

Easily the best stuffing I've ever made. I have a family of very picky eaters (who would never eat leeks or shallots if they knew they were in the redcipe), and everyone gobbled this up at Thanksgiving. Beautiful and wonderfully flavorful!! This will be my standard stuffing recipe now.

We had out family competition on Thanksgiving and this one won! Hands down! Later I made it again and, as a variation, I added a pint of oysters cut into 3/4" pieces and it was good too.

I used less onions and more bread than the recipe called for because my b/f said it looked like a salad. But the taste was wonderful and flavorful - almost like eating an onion ring stuffing style. It's a pretty easy recipe, and I will definitely make it again.

I made this stuffing last year for Thanksgiving for the first time - now, people are looking forward to my Thanksgiving dinner again this year for this stuffing alone! It was incredible! My whole family loved it and the leftovers were gone by noon the next day! Will be our new holiday stuffing.

This stuffing has become a Thanksgiving and Christmas favorite ever since it first appeared. It also makes great leftovers!
