simple, fast, easy and seemingly light. My friend who normally hates dessert lapped it up!

simple and easy! but next time I will use less maple syrup and add lemon peel. Will make it again... I really liked it... I served it in martini glasses... Impressive!

Spectacular! And so easy! My two favorite things. Will try to the Greek yogurt idea next time... if you can save a few calories, why not?

This was delicious. I subbed blackberries and raspberries for the blueberries because that is what I had on hand and, instead of adding more maple syrup to the whipped cream, added a bit of Chambord. Yummy and light. I was hoping there would be leftovers to top waffles for breakfast the next morning, but nobody left a bite!

I made this without any alterations and I thought it was delicious and sinful. I love the idea of using greek yogurt and adding candied ginger and lemon zest. Great ideas! I should always read the reviews, the tips are right on.

Fabulous! Used small, fresh blueberries from New Hampshire.

Excellent. Next time I may add some grated lemon peel to the blueberries.

Wonderful, simple dessert. I mixed half Greek yogurt, half whipped cream. I also used frozen wild blueberries for the cooked portion of the blueberries. I added some candied ginger on top, along with the ginger snaps. Garnish with a mint sprig and you have an easy, refreshing summer dessert.

Outstanding. Guests who usually don't like dessert because it's too sweet loved this. Great balance of flavor and texture.

Very good and simple recipe. Will be making it again. Next time I think I will let the blueberry mixture chill in the fridge before serving.

Delicious sauce, and in an effort to make it a healthier dessert, I used fat free Greek yogurt instead of whipping the cream. I mixed a couple of tablespoons of maple syrup into a cup of the yogurt and blended it well. Then used the yogurt instead of the cream in dishing everything up. I'm sure the original version is excellent, but we felt that this was a healthier variation that we could easily justify!

Outstanding dessert. Very easy sauce, and my teenage daughters loved the assembly process. I used pyrex custard cups, and the layers looked lovely. Lovely, light summer treat that got raves from my entire family. The leftover cups didn't suffer one bit from an overnight stay in the refrigerator, and in my opinion, tasted even better.

A light,spectacular dessert. I have also eliminated the heavy cream and used Blue Bell vanilla ice cream. Also very good. Use the blueberry mixture for a great blueberry shortcake as well. Bisquick buscuits work very well. This is a very versatile sauce!!!

This was a great, light desert. Wouldn't make until ready to eat so the ginger snaps do not get soggy.
