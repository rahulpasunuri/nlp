This was the ittiest-bittiest little clump of dough I've worked with in awhile. My husband would've skinned me on the spot if tried to serve this for both of us! Automatically had to start another batch going to have any chance for some later as a snack. Tasty though~

The heat was there-but not a lot of anything else. A good accompaniment for another dish.

Good. Will try and use stronger/sharper cheese next time, and maybe a touch of mustard powder. The cornmeal gives a pleasant crunch!

I added a little more grated cheese and cayenne (just to kick it up a notch) as well as some fresh thyme and chopped green onion. Served with poached eggs served over asparagus and crumbled pancetta and drizzled with a balsamic/grainy mustard vinaigrette. Delicious!!

I served these at breakfast, and they were an excellent accompaniment to light fare (plain scrambled eggs). I don't agree with those who think the regular recipe makes skimpy scones. I doubled the recipe to serve 14 people, and the scones were ample, even cutting two wedges in half to make 14. I used extra-sharp cheddar made with 2% milk, and I like how the scones were substantial, but not greasy. I leaned on the cayenne generously, and it went well against the bland eggs. The idea of these with Black Bean and Chorizo soup sounds terrific.

These are the cutest little scone guys imaginable. They taste very good, too. I substituted whole milk yogurt (Brown Cow brand, my favorite) for the milk, then added a few dribbles of 2% milk to make the dough come together. They were done in exactly 17 minutes. I wouldn't double the recipe, as some suggested, unless I was cooking for more than 4 people; in this case we were 2. Scones are heavy, hearty fare. To reheat to their best advantage, wrap closely in foil and heat until thoroughly warm throughout. This was my first attempt at making scones and I am pleased. Note: My dining companion wishes another half a fork could be added to rate these scones.

I doubled the cheese and used extra-sharp cheddar and added a little paprika for extra flavor. They were great! Light and fluffy, compared to many scones I've had.

My gosh these are good - I used the sharpest Vermont cheddar I could find! Will make these again and again - you've gotta try 'em! Make sure to make a double batch :)

I followed the recipe exactly, and the end result was a nicely textured, savory scone, but the flavor just wasn't very impressive. These scones really beg to be paired with some flavorful/spicy food, but standing on their own they are just "ok". If I had to eat them on their own again, I would slather some raspberry jalapeno jam or some hot pepper relish on them. Really though, I think these scones are best served as a bread to complement an appropriate dish, like a spicy bean dish, as some other reviewers have mentioned. Recommednations: 1) double salt to a full teaspoon, 2) use extra sharp cheddar cheese and maybe even add a little extra, 3) use dry cornmeal on bottom of scones wehn baking, 4) double the recipe and make 8 scones, because as is, the recipe only 4 average sized scones, not 6.

These are just great and a must with potato soup.

This recipe makes a rather small batch of scones. They were good but not out-of-this-world, not very cheddar-y, but something a little different.

This, along with the black bean and chorizo soup another reviewer mentioned, has become one of our most favourite (and most often made) meals. I put the scones in the oven when the soup is just starting to simmer, and they're done in perfect harmony! How many dishes can you say that about? Plus, the crumbly texture of the scones sops up all the soup liquid perfectly. A fab recipe for both taste and ease.

I didn't have any milk and so used yogurt. Excellent. Light and fluffy and savoury.

I made these tonight to go with the quick black bean soup (also on epicurious). What a great combo! These were quick and easy. I will be making more to take to a potluck lunch later this week!

Absolutely delicious, and so easy to make! They afe a perfect accompaniment to soup, particularly the Black bean and Chorizo (available at this site), and good old Navy Bean. My husband can't get enough of them! I agree with doubling the recipe. At this rate, the next time I make them, I may have to triple it!

I make this recipeoften, but I find the scones way too small. I just double the quantities and make 6 large scones. Easy and popular - a nice savory bread for a tea or brunch party.

Excellent savory bread that is quick to make. An excellent substitute for purchased bread when having dinner.

Yum, yum, yum! We loved these scones. I followed the recipe exactly except didn't have any milk so used buttermilk instead. They were light and tasty. They would be wonderful with a large salad for lunch. We had them with dinner (green salad, spare ribs, mashed potatoes and asparagus. I will be making them again and again. Easy to make too.
