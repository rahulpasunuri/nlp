Interesting combination. I wasn't sure I wanted to try this after reading the reviews, but I had veal and pears I needed to use and wanted a quick recipe. It was actually very good and came together very easily. My husband thought it needed more curry, not less, so the curry factor is a matter of taste. It was definitely different from the usual veal scallop recipes, and I'm glad I tried it.

Not sure why I tried this one but won't do it again. Curry and veal are not good partners in my book. sauce would work better with chicken.

A fantastic dish. The tastes blend wonderfully, and it's very quick and easy to make. The only change I made was not to sautee the curry powder dry for 1 minute as recommended, but to add it with the wine and cream. It saved my kitchen from smelling like curry for the next 3 days.

The curry overwhelmed the rest of the flavors -- including the veal. If I were to make it again (which I won't) I would try letting the wine boil off before adding the cream.

We served this dish with curried rice and a nice (not too oaky) Chardonnay--it was a fantastic meal.

Shallot pear sauce isa natural with veal. This dish can be made without the curry for those that do not enjoy curry. We served this with a simple corn dish and the two paired well.

Easy, elegant and delicious. Try using red pears and garnishing with cilantro for a colorful twist
