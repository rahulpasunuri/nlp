After reading the comments about needing spice or more almond flavor, I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and half a cup of blanched slivered almonds to the fruit/lemon/sugar mixture. Came out yummy!

fairly simple recipee to follow, i forgot to ad baking powder and it was still delicious, my husband ate it up. He said he thought about it when he was at work and couldn't wait to come home for more. A great sign of a good cake is when none is left.

I took this to work, and it went over really well. I would have liked to taste more almond flavor, so maybe next time I'll try doubling the extract. The cake was moist and sweet, the nectarines were delicious.

Yum. I'm writing this review because I had to leave the kitchen, otherwise I would have eaten it all! This is more of a homey coffee cake than a classy dessert. My nectarines sunk into the batter - it didn't look like the picture, but I didn't mind. The cake was light and fluffy with a crispy top. That little bit of almond gives a lot of taste. Used creme fraiche instead of sour cream. I'm going to eat the rest for breakfast. Very easy and delicious,

I actually missed the sour cream when I wrote the recipe down, but it was pretty good anyways. The tartness of the nectarines really blends well with sweet cake. However, the first piece I ate was on the edge and had hardly any nectarine, and it tasted sort of...sort of like a health food sugar cookie. I don't know how well it'd blend with sour cream or yogurt, but the way I made it I think cinnamon would be a great addition to the batter. Also, don't be sparing with the nectarines! Go ahead and use three; they make the cake.

Very nice lite dessert. Next time, I'll add some sort of citrus - maybe some lemon zest.

Very nice finish after a heavy steak dinner party. Used 3 firm nectarines and sliced very thinly. The ice cream may have taken away from the subtle flavors. I enjoyed a second piece w/o

I enjoyed this cake, the nectarines added a nice sweet element. I used yogurt instead of the sour cream.

This was GREAT. I tossed some chopped up marzipan into the batter which worked really well. My nectarines were very sweet... I think more tart ones would have been better. I also used 3 of them - 2 were not enough enough to cover the cake.

What a lovely recipe. We had very good nectarines, so I am sure that added to the overall flavor of the cake. I assumed that I had sour cream in the fridge (never assume!) but when I realized that I didn't, I just used yogurt. I loved it - so I can't wait to try it with the sour cream... maybe even better!

This has became a summer time favorite. Now that nectarines are coming back in season, it will be the first recipe I turn to.

I made this with nectarines when they were in season, We liked it so much, that I made it with Italian prune plums a few weeks later. I halved them and put them skin side down in the batter. I also sprinkled little cinammon on the plums. Also very good.

I made this for a dinner party and a luncheon. Everyone loved it and several people asked for the recipe. I served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
