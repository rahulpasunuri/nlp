This was an excellent, easy, recipe for rice pudding lovers. LIke others, I extended the cooking time to 90 minutes and I didn't worry about the skin, I just stirred it back in. The addition of the cream at the end is key to a luxurious, creamy texture. This is a keeper.

This was very, very good and simple to prepare. For those who had poor results, turn down the temp to 300 after about twenty minutes and cover the bowl(s) so there is no skin. Turn the heat off after about one hour and let it finish cooking in its own heat. And stir every ten to fifteen. Delicious!

I have never made rice pudding before, and the recipe should be written as if that is the case--meaning, I just GUESSED that the white arborio rice should be uncooked. I followed the original recipe instructions to the letter, and the rice turned out both crunchy and crumbly, however that works. Maybe the rice I bought was junk, I don't know. When the hour in the oven was up, and the rice was still a bit crunchy, and the pudding thin, I decided to follow one reviewer's suggestion to add an egg. It ruined it. Until the addition of the egg, the pudding had delicious flavor. I had to add more sugar and more vanilla, and even then, it did not recover. I should have just let it thicken as it cooled. The addition of cinnamon and vanilla was nice. I'd make it again--try a different brand of rice, maybe... but no freakin egg.

This was great, my husband who does not like rice pudding asked for a second helping. I made some changes -- substituted in some coconut milk for the milk, added more cin'mon. It was creamy and good.

I will never buy store bought rice pudding again. The Arborio rice is key to making this the most luxurious pudding possible. Everyone who's tried it commented positively on the chewy texture. Results having followed the recipe as written left flavors a little to be desired - definitely fix-able,however, with a few personal tweaks here and there. I loved reading about the variations of the recipe from the other reviewers (coconut milk? Mmmmm) and look forward to trying them all.

Delicious. I doubled the recipe, used half coconut milk and half 2%, omitted nutmeg and baked it as suggested in one dish. Next time I'll slice bananas on top with a sprinkle of brown sugar and broil for a few miutes.

I adore this recipe. I could probably eat the entire thing by myself! As I dislike nutmeg, I leave it out. The dessert is also tastier if you take it out and stir every ten mins. or so.

As a rice pudding lover who married a rice pudding hater, this recipe is my salvation! I can make just one or two servings at a time. It's creamy, a little chewy and wonderful! I followed the advice of a few other reviewers and added cinnamon and vanilla with the nutmeg, but still cooked the pudding in ramekins. I think the full hour cooling time is excessive. It's perfectly edible in 15 minutes.

This was a great, easy pudding to make on a cold winter day. I followed the modifications that purplelips mentions and it was a great pick - me - up on a brisk winter afternoon.

Great rice pudding! I made 1 1/2 times the recipe and baked in 1 dish so cooking time was longer. As suggested by other reviewers I also added cinnamon and Meyer lemon zest. I stirred every 15 minutes per other reviewers comments and the resulting pudding had no skin. Creamy, sweet and delicious!

Okay - I know it goes against the whole rating system thing (hence the 3), but rice pudding is an important part of my good mental health so I cannot be unpartisan. This CAN be perfect rice pudding. I made it as a single batch. Stir every 15 minutes - peeling the skin off at the end is a desperate and uncouth cooking technique. Add a well-beaten egg during the last half hour or so (when the rice is only just slightly undercooked). And, for me, I need the raisins, 1/4 cup or so, added with the egg, which have been simmered in water or something more interesting for 5 minutes - although I will accept dissenting arguments on those. Add some vanilla once it's cooled (can you have sweet things without vanilla?). And whip the heavy cream before folding it into the only-just warm pudding. (chill the dish in ice water for quick/desperate results). I make mine with cinnamon and never nutmeg for reasons I cannot fully justify. Perfection.

This deserves a 3.5 star in the comfort food category. Like the previous reviewer I made it in a single dish. I did not remove the skin and we ate it cold from the fridge. It is creamy and dense, and luxurious.

3.5 stars, really, but I am overcompensating for the sake of refuting the negative review. My advice is to adjust the recipe to suit personal tastes. For example, I omit the nutmeg and instead use vanilla sugar and a modest amount of Meyer lemon zest for flavor. Second, I bake the pudding in a single casserole, stirring every 15 minutes. This is crucial during the last half hour. During the final 15 minutes, I add golden raisins that I had left soaking in warm water until that time (you could be creative and soak them in rum or add a little Meyer lemon juice to water). Drain and stir into the pudding. DO NOT discard the skin, it's lovely. However, stirring pudding as it forms tames it. Cool in front of an open window in the dead of winter and you needn't wait a whole hour to eat slightly warm. Even better for breakfast, ice cold. This is the British way to make rice pudding and better than the wonderful dessert my stepmother prepares only *because* of the fabulous chewy texture.

Very creamy! Perhaps the other reviewer didn't bake the pudding long enough.

Worst recipe-skip it! Rice was chewy, pudding not creamy and it was tasteless.
