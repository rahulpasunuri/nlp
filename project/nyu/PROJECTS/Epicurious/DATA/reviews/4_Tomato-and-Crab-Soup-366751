Very good soup. I would change the following though: double the coconut milk and lemon grass. I served it warm, and so I added the crab to the soup a few minutes before serving to warm it up. I also put the soup through a sieve, as it was too chunky.

Oh my gosh!!I followed the recipe and then added 2 small garlic cloves and some fresh ginger. Strained in a seive. I thought my family would lose their minds. They loved it as did I.Everyone had to taste as soon as it was pureed, then when it was served with backfin lump crab and snow peas , Well, needless to say this is a keeper.

LOVED THIS. I stuck pretty closely to the recipe as written, but my grocer didn't have Fresno or Thai chiles, or pea shoots. I used one Anaheim pepper without seeds, and I liked the spiciness level, but it was admittedly weak. (My boyfriend added Sriracha to his bowl.) I also used 1 can of coconut milk and 1 can of chicken broth, and pureed with my immersion blender (so easy!!!). And used TONS of snow peas. Also: I'm not sure how much a half-pound of crabmeat is, but I picked up an 8 oz container from my deli ($13!) and was worried it wouldn't be enough -- and it was plenty!

Underwhelming... Made as written except added, 1 roasted orange bell pepper with the tomatoes, used more coconut milk and topped with avocado along with the crab. It really lacked flavor even with the addition of soy sauce. Maybe I'll try it again with much less chicken broth, maybe even using clamato to help punch up the flavor profile.

Amazing! The only change I would recommend is to either tie the lemongrass together and remove it after simmering or to strain everything through a fine mesh sieve after blending... the little bits of blended lemongrass detract from the texture. Otherwise YUMMM!

I made this soup for my family, I have a VERY picky husband when it comes to new dishes. But this soup was by far one of the best I have ever made. You will laugh, but I forgot to add the chicken broth so it came out really creamy, but believe you me IT WAS DELICIOUS. I added a little bit of croutons and it was perfect, I will make this soup over and over again! I give not four but five forks!

I substituted the crab for shrimp, left off the lime and juice as felt it was too sour with it. Tasted like Tom Yum Gai (Thai soup)-- I served it with thai chicken curry and Jasmine rice. Perfect Thai meal!

Followed the recipe exactly and served it at a dinner party, and it was delicious!! Served it hot. I found dried Thai Chiles in a jar in the International Food Section. They were very small but very spicy. Beware of using more than just 1, but don't leave it out,it was great! I used some alfalfa sprouts on top as garnish instead of the snow peas and pea tendrils because they were easier to find, but I didn't love how they wilted when they hit the hot soup.

Loved this soup. Made as stated except could not find Thai chili so used Jalapeno from my garden. My upscale grocer did not have or know of pea tendrils so left those out. This was good both hot and cold. Oh, and after the first bowl, to my second serving, I added Creme Fraiche. My, was that good.

I think this is one of the best tomato soups I've had. It's a very bright, fresh taste, with a subtle smokiness, from the fish sauce I think. Very light, yet satisfying as well. It feels like it's missing something as I prepare the bowl, but on eating, it's not wanting for anything at all. I didn't have enough tomatoes, nor were they beefsteak, so used a tin of tomatoes to fill out the recipe. I couldn't really find pea shoots, so used cress instead, along with plenty of fresh lime juice and about 6 snow peas on top of each bowl; I like the crunch they add. Definitely going to make this again.

This was the best I have tasted in a long time. Even my Grandson, who does not like veggies, enjoyed it.

okay, really? you dont like tomatoes or crab but you make a tomato and crab soup recipe and then give it a one star review? maybe just a TEENSY bit unfair. this recipe is amazing. i used two whole peppers with seeds and it was HOT  probably could have left the seeds out on the second pepper. but it was delicious. skipped the pea tendrils and just used more snap peas. SO good.

Not sure if I'm missing something here. While it wasn't horrible, I wouldn't bother making it again. May be an unfair review as I'm neither a tomato or crab fan, but I'm just trying to mix it up a bit so I thought I'd make something I wouldn't typically pick! I try to be very healthy so the menu can get boring. Anyways, again, the tomato base was just lacking flavor (and I made according to directions minus the Thai chile, couldn't find one so used Jalapeno). If you love tomatoes and crab, may be worth it for you, but for me...the wasn't a keeper!

I made this recipe mostly as is except for using a jalapeño instead of the Fresno or Thai chile. I found it to not have enough heat so next time would use two. it tasted wonderful either hot or cold. The crunch of the slivered snap peas on top was a definite plus.

This recipe was a hit. Made if for my summer soup party and served it cold. There wasn't a drop left.

This soup was wonderful. We served it hot with crab to garnish. I had to use an Anaheim chile instead of a Fresno, so there wasn't much heat, but my guests loved it. Plus, I froze the other half can of coconut milk, so I can make it again very soon.
