Have made this recipe twice and it is excellent. I serve it on roasted brussel sprouts with some toasted hazelnuts on top to make a warm salad starter during the cold months! Super easy and looks gorgeous layed out on a cauliflower puree.

Made this as a stuffing for a butterflied pork roast tenderloin. All at the table proclaimed it a hit. I increased all ingredients by 50% to have enough to use as a glaze. To the extra I added some orange marmalade and dijon mustard.

This was a hit for TG. Followed the recipe but put in more figs. As it cooled, it set up fine so I'm not sure what other did wrong to make it to liquid. The flavor was fantastic but use a Pinot you'd drink. I can imagine if you use a cheap wine, it wouldn't taste all that great. it was the only dish with no leftovers - and I made tons. Everyone asked for the recipe.

This was the star of Thanksgiving dinner - it is now my new 'go to' recipe for cranberry. Boiled it a little longer than recipe called for after seeing the comments about the extra liquid but I don't think this was necessary. Not sure what folks were doing wrong (expecting it to be thick right off the stove?) but mine was the PERFECT consistency after it set. I made it the day before and chilled in the fridge - even better the next day.

The recipe is a winner, for ease and taste. I hadn't made this chutney before, but made it for Thanksgiving to rave reviews, some proclaiming it was the best cranberry condiment they ever tasted! I made a double batch, using a package each of Calimyrna and Black Mission figs. The slight chewiness of the figs and crunch of their seeds gave the sauce a more complex and interesting mouth feel, and the sweet/tart/spicy/earthy balance achieved among all the ingredients was spot-on. I usually diddle with recipes, but I was glad I didn't with this one. I think I am going to make some jars up and water process them to give as gifts this year.

Just made this according to recipe. Though I boiled it at the first stage with cranberries for a bit longer. Can not wait to eat it with our dinner. Remember chutney thickens(sets up) as it cools down so it is going to be a little runny right off the stove. Mine is setting up nicely.

This recipe is delicious! I only used 3/4 cup water listening to the other reviews. Also, I added a few more figs. The consistency was perfect and made my kitchen smell amazing. I paired it with a brie cheese and served with crackers.

This is very tasty. Based on the comments about the amount of liquid,I made a few changes. I used the standard bag of cranberries but, I measured them and after picking out the ones that weren't ripe, I found I only had 3 generous cups so, I cut the liquid to 3/4s of that stated in the recipe. I also reduced the water by a third (so, I used 3/4s cup of water because of the overall reduction). You can always add more while it cooks but, mine came out perfect. I also increased the cooking for the first round of cranberries by about 3-4 minutes. Also, don't skip the pepper but, do add just a little bit at a time.

This is delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and was afraid it was too runny, but it thickened when it cooled. I made it for Thanksgiving but I'll serve it with pork tenderloin and baked chicken too. I think of chutney as a bit sour. This is tangy and sweet. Excellent!

I followed the directions exactly and mine is not at all like a chutney. It has a lot of liquid. Perhaps the directions for the amount of wine and water are wrong.

this is very very very deliciuos,& i will be making it every year now. i however don't think i kept the heat high enough, because after jarring the batch, i had almost 1/3 of a cup of syrup left, and the recipe did say it would "scrape" out of the pan.i'm also 1/2 tempted to throw in the rest of the figs next time, there were only 9 left from the round package. thanks for the great recipie
