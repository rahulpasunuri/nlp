I would definitely reduce the maple syrup next time. Though to reduce the sweetness, I added more cream, pumpkin and egg yolk. Nice smooth texture. It worked out well.

My rating isn't for the finished product but the crummy directions. There is no way these set in 40 minutes! Argh--I can't stand inaccurate directions, which is why I normally stick to Gourmet's tried-and-true recipes. I am making these ahead for Thanksgiving dinner and my schedule is completely screwed up now. Am trying to rebake them for a more set custard. The photo shows them not in custard cups but crème brulée ramekins, which are much shallower--perhaps those would set in the time cited in the recipe, but I can't imagine how you'd get those in a bain marie.

Thanksgiving dinner is just not complete without a bite of pumpkin pie... but since I don't usually like the crust, I often make just the custard and was excited to try this recipe. I also had a lot of gorgeous pumpkins this fall, and decided to start from scratch by baking one for about 45 minutes and pureeing the cooked pumpkin for this recipe. It was just perfect!! As others suggested, it was a tad sweet, but in a small serving size with a dollop of unsweetened whipping cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon, it's just delightful! Try adding a little sugar cookie on the side - it was a huge hit at our table!

Should've taken the suggestion to use cool tap water from the start or something. This curdled. Tastes ok. I'll stick with plain flan-type custard.

Very nice and silky. I use a grade B maple syrup for a little stronger flavor.

This was too sweet for me the first time I made it. So the second time I reduced the maple syrup by about 25%, and replaced that volume with extra milk. It worked out really well. I also baked it uncovered, first at 325F for 30 min, then at 300F for another 35 minutes. I added really hot tap water as the waterbath, rather than boiling water -- in the past that sometimes gave me overcooked custards. Finally, I served these with ginger thins, which went really well together.

Wonderful recipe and so easy. I served it with a dollop of real whipping cream - PERFECT!

We made this recipe for Thanksgiving - I thought it was only ok. It tastes like creamy pumpkin pie filling with a little bit of maple sugar. It just seemed like a lot of work to get that result. It tasted better the next day, so maybe this dessert is better made a day or two in advance.

Way too sweet! You can cut the cholesterol in this recipe by using whole eggs and whirling them in the blender. Can't believe anyone likes desserts this weet - all you taste is maple syrup and cream.

I have made lots of different kinds of pots de creme. The trick to get a smooth texture is to temper the egg yolks. This one is a great alternative to making pumpkin pie.

I recently made 55 of these baked in those little ornamental pumpkins. They were a big hit.

I wish I would have read other reviewers' comments before I made these. The flavor was lovely, but the texture was curdled and chunky! I was disappointed.

first time I made these the flavor was excellent but they took over an hour to set and the texture was "off". I tried again today (thanksgiving) with EXCELLENT results. I only filled ramekins 3/4in high and I increased the temperature to 375. I didn't have a bain marie so I just used a cake pan with water and I covered each individual ramekin with foil. the flavor is so unique and texture is amazing... I can't believe I made these- they are SO good!! like pumpkin pie only more delicate... I'm not even a big fan of pumpkin pie but I love these!! inspired by my culinary success I wanted to increase their visual appeal so I garnished them with whole star anise and a dollop of sour cream. whipped cream would work too but sour cream (or cream cheese) adds that salty sweet combination that I find irresistable.

I followed the recipe but baked uncovered as the previous reviewer suggested. Great tip...they turned out nice and creamy. A nice fall do- ahead dessert.

Rating: 4
Excellent. However do not cover as that results in overheating and curdling (I ruined them the first time I made them). I mix all ingredients without heating and then bake in wated bath at 300F, uncovered, for 60-70min. Put paper towels in the pan so the remqeuines do not touch the bottom of the pan. A pinch of ground ginger is also a good idea.

This was delicious and smooth even though I accidentally mixed the egg yolks in with the milk and cream. So I just whisked all the ingredients together and heated it to just shy of a simmer before pouring into custard cups. My guests never knew I goofed. ;)

This is fantastic and easy. Perfect for the holidays when you need items you can cook ahead of time. When serving I would add a mint leave or dusting of powdered sugar. It needs something to dress it up. These were a real hit though and definitely use real maple syrup.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe a number of times and it is always a huge hit. I dress it up a little, by serving it inverted (like you would a creme brule)and pour real Vermont or Quebec Maple syrup over the top, artificial syrup will not have the same impact at all. Real Maple syrup does not have the heavy sugary sweetness that artificial syrups do. My guests lick the dish clean.

A French classic gets a traditional American update. I needed two water baths to hold all the ramekins, and found that the two batches did not bake evenly (one required an extra 15 minutes).

The flavours marry wonderfully. If I hadn't been so full from the main meal, I would definitely have had seconds (or even thirds!)... I had comfort food appeal, but with just the right touch of sophistication. And so easy.

This was a good recipe but a regular pumpkin pie is just as good. I put it thru a fine sieve but wanted to know what it tasted like if it wasnt done so for the last one I did not. I discovered it must be put thru a fine sieve. Also, I used Pure Birch tree syrup harvested from my own trees. I might make this once more with maple syrup just to see the difference.

I made this for my 8 year old pumpkin pie lover and his words after the first bite were "mom, this is so good, I don't have words to describe it". My husband agreed. Yummy!

Lovely dessert...Terribly easy to make...instead of ramekins...I bout mini tart tins...I worried a little about the metal as opposed to the porcelain...but they turned out great...I topped each with whipped cream and nutmeg....Everyone loved them...It was an impressive dish for it's simplicity...

I once heard Julia Child remark that home cooks have often approached her and said they would love to make this or that recipe of hers, however, they haven't got or can't get the ingredients. Her response, "Well, for heaven's sake use what you DO have!" So, since I was making this at the 11th hour before Thanksgiving dinner and I found to my horror that I had forgotten to buy pure maple syrup, I wound up taking Ms. Child's advice. I used what I did have -- Mrs. Butterworth's -- in other words, maple flavored corn syrup. I was worried the dessert would be overly sweet, but it turned out fine. The meal ended with the sounds of happy spoons scavenging every last bit of ever lovin' pumpkin goodness out of the ramekins. Whew!

I have made this twice; the first time they were wonderful - they had a smooth, creamy, silky texture and looked great, the second time they were lumpy and grainy - apparently due to over cooking. As soon as they are firm and the knife comes out just wet/shiny (not coated with custard) they are done. To the cook who had issues with the spices sinking: possibly your sieve was not a fine mesh, I used a fine mesh sieve and the spices were left behind but the flavor was not. These are excellent... when not over cooked.

I've made this three times already...awesome. But, I've been looking for a great pumpkin custard pie recipe and, with the addition of an another 1/2cup of pumpkin, this is incredible baked in a pie shell. My family's new pie favorite and they are quite demanding!

Rating: 4
Wonderful dish! Rave reviews from all my guests. Two issues I came across that were my own fault: 1) my ramekins must be huge because I only filled four, 2) the spices seem to have collected on the bottom of the dish (still delicious). Will try again with other, smaller ramekins and see what I can do about the spices sinking.

Served this for Thanksgiving. A big hit. Quicker than creme brulee, creme caramel,or flan. Added 1/8tsp ground ginger, but I'm sure it would have been fine without too. And the small servings are just right after that huge dinner. Creamy as can be. Custards come grainy only if you overcook them, I think.

Wonderful, spicy custard. Mine came out smooth and creamy. I tried whip cream (to cover the obvious knife mark where it was tested for doneness), but I think it's better without as the flavor is more intense.

made this for thanksgiving. i thought it was quite good, although i like the texture of a creme brulee custard better. didnt think it looked as appetizing as the picture though, kind of grainy and there was also shrinkage as the other reviewer mentioned.. a little whipped cream on top improved appearance. probably will try other recipes before making this one again.

Rating: 3
Couldn't get over all the comments from people who didn't even make this recipe. I actually did! It's incredibly easy, and quite delicious. Only thing I would do again, is to be sure that custards are filled to the top, as they shrink back a little after they're chilled. Why not try it, and then add your comments?

Dear Chloe, Everyone knows if you want good maple syrup it has to be from Quebec. Really.

Rating: 3
Followed the recipe as it was written and ended up with something more akin to custard - rather than the silky textured cream I was expecting. It was very good but so much like pumpkin pie that I'm not sure it was worth the extravagance of maple syrup and 7 yolks. I would recommend it but probably won't make it again myself...

It worked well, and was a big hit at out dinner party. The only change to the recipe is that I found the cooking time longer than specified to have them harden. Excellent, would definitley make again.

I'm afraid I agree with TriBeCa. Since they are applying the French spelling of pots of cream (pot du creme), then the traditional French presentation of the dessert should be observed - which according to Escoffier and Julia Child is thick liquid like heavy cream. This is not flan, or creme brulee. Custard need not be firm to be called custard. It just means it's got eggs (or parts of eggs)as a binding agent. We Americans are so used to things like flan, creme caramel and creme brulee, that we don't think of custard in any form other than firm. By the way, churn custard over very cold temperature . . . . ice cream!

Rating: 0
To the TriBeCa cook, here's the definition from Epicurious: pot de crème; pot-au-crème [poh duh KREHM; poht-oh-KREHM] French for "pot of cream," this dessert consists of a creamy-rich custard prepared and served in tiny (about 3-ounce) pot-shaped cups. Though the classic flavoring is vanilla, pot de crème comes in many variations including chocolate and coffee. To me, custard is not liquid.

I just ran to make this...My daughter loves hot pumpkin pie with cream, I would make this for her doesnt take long to cook, that's exactly what it taste like pumpkin pie. great for thanksgiving. I think it would be really cute in minature pumpkins...

I made a half batch of this for dessert tonight, otherwise following the directions exactly. It was simple to prepare and delicious. Nice texture, terrific flavor. My mother said that it may usurp creme brulee as her favorite dessert.

I made this in traditional pots de creme for a dinner party. Got rave reviews. I did add a dollop of whipped cream and sprinkle of cinnamon sugar on each.

Not only does it sound good, but I AM making it today. And to the cook from NY, Custards need not only be baked in ramekins - I have made "old fashioned pumpkin pie", which is a custard baked in a pumpkin shell, many times to great effect. So to the cook who asked - go for it!!

I did not make this, but to the last reviewer: this is clearly a custard and must be made in ramekins, not pumpkins.

I haven't made this but would like to. I'm wondering if it can be baked inside those small mini pumpkins or gourds. Any ideas?

I think you need to treat these like creme brulee. Slowly, a bit at a time, while whisking, add hot cream mix to egg mix then continue heating. Don't simmer this mixture or the eggs will curdle. Whisk constantly, preferably in a double-boiler until the mixture gets hot, thickens, coats the back of a spoon and surface foam disappears. Hot water bath, uncovered. If you cover the hot water bath, moisture will water-down the flavour and form bubbles on the surface. Should be ready in 25-30 minutes depending on the depth of the ramekin. Otherwise, this sounds like a nice idea.
