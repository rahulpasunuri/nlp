This is a delicious dessert and I hate Jello. It is intensely flavored and refreshing and takes minutes to make.

This was the best gelatin dish that I've ever tasted! And I hate Jello!

Made this for Thanksgiving; everyone loved it! (Although several of my not so bright family members thought the grapes were olives at first.) The recipe DOES say to strain the raspberries; not doing so would probably be why the previous reviewer could not get hers to set. I doubled the recipe & made it in a big lasagna pan instead of the custard cups. Admittedly it was not as firm as Jello, but the flavor was so much better.

I made this and the gelatin never did set, even making it the night before. It did not say to drain the raspberries but I would suggest to do so. This was not good enough to try again, even if I could get it to set.
