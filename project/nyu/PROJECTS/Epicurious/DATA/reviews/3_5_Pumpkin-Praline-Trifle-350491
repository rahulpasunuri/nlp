My daughter decided to make this instead of pumpkin pie this Thanksgiving. Amazing! I made it the day before Thanksgiving and luckily we still have some leftovers. It really is so much better the second day. Praline mixture is a bit tricky just keep cooking until it is light and bubbly (takes a while), but so worth it. Yes, it's a bit sweet, but we didn't add all the praline so found it perfect. Kids loved it!

Made this for a Harvest dinner and it was a huge hit! Everyone wants it again on Thanksgiving. Was a little on the sweet side and I would cut back on the sugar next time. I made it in the morning and served it the same evening even though it says to make ahead and it was delicious. Can't imagine how much better it will be if it sits for two days. The praline pecans were easy to make and worth the extra time. If you want something that looks really extravagant but doesn't take all day to make give this a try!

The DISH, of course, not the dis...

I made the praline recipe 3 times and followed the instructions to the T. It would NOT turn hard -it simply was like a caramel. Didn't taste bad or anything, it just wasn't a praline. I ended up just using a praline recipe from the Joy instead. The dis was ok.

Everyone loved this dessert when I made it on christmas. I used hard ladyfingers and they softened overnight in the juices of the trifle and tasted excellent. I also did a few extra layers, just till I filled the bowl I was using, This recipe ended up being pretty quick and easy and definitely looked and tasted like something that took a lot more time!

I made this, and it turned out fantastic. Everyone enjoyed it, including those that aren't crazy about pumpkin. Next time, I would actually not make the pralines, and just use chopped walnuts, you woun't even tell the difference.

I made this with a couple of substitutions. I'm not a fan of lady fingers, so I used pound cake. Also, I don't care for allspice, so I replaced it with ground cloves. It is sweet, so next time I will cut back on the sugar in the mascarpone cream, but it was very good, and everyone liked it. I used very little rum, I'd probably add a bit more next time.

Great recipe. I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit! Made my own ladyfingers as well. I skimped on the rum because I was worried it would taste too strong -- but next time I will definitely use the suggested amount. Will make this again.

Halved this recipe for 5 of us and it would have served 6 or even 7 generously. I left out the rum b/c my kids don't like the taste of raw alcohol (and it's not like we're anxious for them to cultivate that taste :)). My trifle looked nothing like the picture - it had beautiful stripes of pale orange and white with the ladyfingers inbetween. Made it Tuesday and kept opening the refrigerator to admire it. I thought it was okay but nothing to rave over, but the family LOVED it. DS18 kept saying, "This is really, really good, Mom." And that was after glutting on a heavy T-day meal. I think I am going to have to make this every year. Note: chop praline by hand, don't try to be smart and put it in the processor to save time like I did. It pulverizes it.

I made this for a work event. Was delicious, however extremely sweet. Will make it again cutting back on some sugar throughout each step. Display of the desert was a big hit.

I can't believe this is considered kid-friendly when it contains rum and is uncooked. Granted its a small amount and some parents may decide that's okay. However I imagine many parents would not serve this to children as written. I cannot rate it on taste, however it does sound delicious. My problem is with the kid-friendly rating.

It is truly a beautiful looking holiday dessert, but it is missing something to make it truly spectacular. My suggestions -- When ever I make a trifle or tiramisu, I bake a cake (two 9" pans), split them in half horizontally and I have four fresh layers of cake instead of store- bought lady fingers. I use a tupperware container the same size as my trifle dish, push the container onto the cake, and voila -- perfectly round cakes to go where the lady fingers go. There are many different steps to this cake. I baked my cake, and while cake was in oven, I began the pralines. It took about 12 minutes of stirring, not 8 minutes, to reach the correct temperature. When the recipe called for 1 Tablesppoon of rum drizzled on the lady finger layer, I poured the rum in a bowl, brushed the bottom of the cake with rum, placed it into dish, and then brushed the top with rum. Then I layered as recipe states. I think that the pumpkin mixture needs more of all seasonings -- cinnamon, nutmeg and perhaps some powdered ginger. The additional seasonings might give it a more "holiday" flavor, and I might have given it a four fork rating. I, also, let it sit in fridge for 2 days as suggested in the recipe.

Yummy. I made this tonight for an event in 2 days. I couldn't wait to try it ... delish. I did make the pralines and they are fabulous and easy. I didn't use the rum (I didn't have any) and didn't miss it.

Fabulous! I made a couple of desserts for a crowd and hands down this was the winner. It has been added to the Thanksgiving menu. I made it two days in advance to let the flavors develop. I didn't make the pralines - I bought them at Whole Foods instead. The only other change would be to use a little more rum on the lady fingers. Yum!
