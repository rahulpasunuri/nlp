I think this recipe was good, but fresh beets are a must. The goat cheese at the end was the perfect touch, but if there were fresh beets used I think I might have given this dish four stars.

This is ridiculous for ONE person to put 20 of the same review - not a true test of this dish!

This soup is wonderfully refreshing and flavorful, quick and easy, and makes a stunning visual presentation. I made a few slight changes; red onion to replace the shallots, briefly sauteed in a tiny spray of olive oil, 1 tablespoon of frozen apple juice concentrate, and about 1/2 cup of extra orange juice. I also cooked my own beets, skinned them, and strained the cooking liquid through a coffee filter. Garnished with the goat cheese, some orange zest, and the chives - our guests loved it. Will definitely make again during beet season.
