Agree, it is fussy - but not a lot of 'work'. My sandwich bread was thin sliced home-made whole grain and made a delicious sandwich but I like the idea of using a pita pocket or wrap. Will definitely try this again. Can think of endless options for substitution or additions.

Just ok. A lot of work for a so so sandwich.

This is a fussy sandwich to prepare, but it is special and delicious. Lots of flavor and texture in each bite.

Mmm mmm.... even with substandard American bread this was super yummy. Will definitely make again when I've bought some better bread!

I made this as a wrap for an evening picnic at Ravinia. It was perfect.

Just an editorial comment...oklindaloo, you obviously really liked this recipe but really, did you have to send the same review a kazillion times? Great sandwich and thanks the reviewer who suggested toasted walnuts. Great addition. Toasted sliced almonds also work well.

Very tasty sandwich and loved the different flavors. A couple changes: I forgot to buy a lime and I don't like mayo. I used hummus instead. The only thing I would add is something crunchy because this sandwich had a very soft texture, so something like lettuce, bell peppers... doritos.

Yum. I followed recipe, except I skipped the Mayo, as I don't like it, and added the lime to the beans instead. I highly recommend toasting your bread, otherwise your bread may fall apart. I think I may try this as a wrap next time. My favorite epicurious sandwich so far!

this was delicious! i followed the recipe exactly...well, except for the part where i put everything into pita pockets and then added toasted walnuts on top (the walnuts were incredible. i highly recommend them!) quick. easy. healthy. delicious. perfect!

Followed the advice of other reviewers and made this into wraps using whole wheat tortillas. Figured it would need some crunch, so added thin slices of red and yellow bell peppers. Turned out to still need more in the way of crunch, so went on to add carrot and jicama. It's good, colorful, definitely healthy, but will it rock anybody's world? No. To be fair, though, is it possible for any wrap to be that good? Probably not. Most likely, won't make this again, except maybe for a picnic or other case that calls for a sandwich-type item that can be made ahead without getting soggy or going bad.

This was delicious! I seasoned the beans but opted not to puree them. I also turned the sandwich into a wrap which worked really well. The pickled onions and chipotle-lime mayo were standouts. Overall, worth the effort!

Rating: 3
Excellent sandwich for meateaters, filling and satisfying. I had some trouble pureeing the beans; I thought it needed more moisture. I also did not cook the onion, just used it raw. I agree that the sandwich paired well with the Pasta and Garbanzo Soup.

Rating: 3
A nice little sandwich with a "fancy deli" air about it. I used plain yogurt instead of mayo and skipped the onions. It's a little messy when served on crusty bread, though ... would probably be a bit more dignified as a wrap. Delicious with the Pasta and Garbanzo Bean Soup!

I made this sandwich in a wrap and it was very delicious... almost like a burrito. The next time I make this I won't bother to add the mayo... maybe just the peppers and the lime juice instead. I found it overall a little too creamy especially if you happen to have an avocado that is perfectly ripened. Also, I probably won't bother with preparing the onions in the boiling water/vinegar. I love red onions and preparing them this way made them less tasty...in my opinion.

I just made this for dinner and it was delicious! I used raw onions, rather than soaking them in vinegar (I was too hungry to wait). I also omitted the mayo and squeezed the lime juice on top of the veggies. Great sandwich - very filling and healthy!
