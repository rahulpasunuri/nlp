Delicious! Hearty and very tasty. The pepper and the pancetta (I couldn't find any at the store so used regular bacon) were key ingredients. I will make this again! Made just as the recipe says except for the bacon-pancetta sub.

Dish of the Year? Just finished a 6 mo. kitchen remodel and so excited to start cooking again. First real meal? Bon Appetit's Dish of the Year. Really? It was ok. Good. Decent. But not a dish of the year unless making it 15 minutes or less with food you already have in your kitchen are part of the requirements for Dish of the Year. I may make it again for a quick weeknight meal, but was it special? NO. Oh..and can someone please tell me if they think the recipe was supposed to be with broccolini (kind of looks more like broccolini in the photo). Broccoli rabe is more leafy isn't it? A bit confused.

okay, so i used bacon and broccoli and i'm sure it is really good with the correct ingredients, but as it was this was a great easy recipe which was devoured by entire family. so, was it really 4 stars? not sure, but definitely will make it again, and will try to find the proper ingredients.

Excellent pasta recipe. I used fresh wide egg pasta that remained delightfully al dente, to my surprise. The Italian salumeria where I got my pancetta had some dried morels so I threw in a handful of these, to lovely effect. The only thing I had a problem with was keeping my fried eggs from overcooking. By the time I used them to top the pasta their yolks had set. I love brocolli rabe and found this a perfect way to use it. Bravo!!

This is on the rotation too. It is easy to make and the fried egg, while over the top, is a nice touch. I like this version of carbonara much better than other versions I have had with a cream based sauce. I had a neighbor years ago from Italy, and his carbonara was very heavy (lots of cream). I never liked that version. When I tried this, much better.

Followed recipe as is. Used fresh fettucine. OK. Not great but not bad either.

Quite yummy. I am a sucker for any pasta with egg and cheese. The pancetta was great and frying the egg in the pancetta fat was decadent. Yummy all around.

We loved it - it goes into regular rotation. The egg on top makes it!Used only the pasta part of it - no veggies. Had a Caesar salad on the side. DH went nuts with it - wants it once a week. Will save a little more pasta water next time for creaminess. YUM!

We love carbonara and really enjoyed this twist. Definitely would do again, and definitely with the egg on top. We really like it! (easy and tasty!)

I would like to find the photo of this dish that was on the cover of the January 2009 magazine. It shows the pasta without the egg...which is how I would make it. Does anyone know where to find the other photo?

Fun dish to make - but I would not want it very often. I could not find broccoli rabe in my hometown so I ended up using kale for flavor and broccoli for texture. That may have taken away from the finished product.

Sorry but this dish did nothing for us. Okay so I didn't put the fried egg on top but I did everything else the way the directions said and I was very disappointed.

Yummy but I don't know how much the fried egg on top really adds. I didn't want to spend the extra few dollars on pancetta so I cooked this with regular bacon instead. Perhaps pancetta would have made the difference. I did love the broccoli rabe though.

What kind of pasta do people recommend? Fresh or dried? I'm not sure what "egg" pasta is.

Please just don't call this dish a carbonara! It may be good (although I personally find the fried eggs too muchp) but a carbonara doesn't have anything other than eggs, cheese and guanciale (or pancetta, as it is easier to find in the US).

I agree that the fried egg can probably be omitted for the sake of convenience, but the gooey yolk coating the pasta was worth the extra bit of timing for me. The egg/cheese sauce had a better cheese flavor than many of the alfredo recipes I've tried.

We enjoyed this recipe. Recipe of the year? Probably not. Maybe easiest recipe of the year. It was light and fresh tasting instead of heavy and greasy as with a cream sauce. I made more than the recipe called for- 12 oz of pasta, 6 oz of chopped pancetta instead of thinly sliced, and 3 cloves of garlic. I skipped the fried eggs altogether- too much cholesterol for us. This recipe lends itself to changes- basil, Italian parsley, spinach, chard, bacon, etc. Have fun!

I have to agree with the cook that called this dish "dreadful, insidpid". I cooked it two consecutive nights - thinking I'd missed a step the first time. After all - this was "recipe of the year". It really just had no flavor and I used good cheese & fresh pasta. disappointing!

This was pretty good. We made the mistake of using Trader Joe's chive and spinach pasta which gave the dish an "off" flavor. Will make again with PLAIN pasta.

Very simple and tasty. Surprisingly rich with no milk/cream.

Dreadful, insipid. In fact, signed up just to write this. Have to say I'm surprised by the reactions above. Made this because it resembled a Carbonara I had in Aix en Provence and I wanted to replicate it. Definetly fell way short of the mark. That said, I did learn a few things, like broccoli will cook at the same rate as pasta so you can use one pot. Good to know. If you want a truly superior Carbonara use the one in Marcella Hazan's classic "Essentials of Classic Italia Cooking" and add your own eggs. I also add sautéed sliced mushrooms. Super delish!! Happy cooking. btw, you can find it here: http://articles.latimes.com/2002/oct/02/food/f o-carb2 Substitute a good Egg Papardelle noodle instead of the spaghetti and you'll be a happy camper.

I thought this recipe was great tasting. Love the egg on top. It was nice to have the creamy sauce without the heavy cream too. I will definitely be making this again!

Followed the recipe, and used rapini for the first time. Surprisingly tender stems, and delicious flowers and leaves. The fried eggs are a real change from the usual carbonara recipes. We will definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe the first time and it was wonderful! Could subsitute regular broccoli and bacon for a cheap and easy dish.

What a wonderful recipe. I made this with homemade fettucine; and the cooking time was greatly reduced. We enjoy broccoli rabe rapini instead of regular broccoli; this recipe is a "keeper".

Not only was this a quick and easy weeknight dinner, but I love the fact that it's a carbonara without cream or even milk. I also left out the fried egg, but may try it next time. My only issue was with the instructions in the recipe, since I had never cooked broccoli rabe, I trimmed off all the stems and leaves, based on the photo .

This recipe was delicious and super easy. A great weeknight meal!
