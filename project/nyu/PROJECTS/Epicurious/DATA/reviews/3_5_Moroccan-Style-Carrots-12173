A fresh and flavorful recipe. Of course fresh produce is always better but if you are pinched for time, frozen carrots worked nicely in this recipe. I did thaw them before adding them to the skillet. Double the seasonings if using a 1lb frozen bag of carrots. The lemon juice is a wonderful addition. I served this with Mustard and Herb Crusted Rack of Lamb, creamed peas, and couscous. A suprisingly quick and easy though incredibly delicious dinner.

Wow! Great flavor. Recommended for kids who won't normally eat veggies. Fresh farmers market carrots work well here.

I've made this several times substituting curry powder for cumin, and it turns out well.

I served this at a dinner party and people raved about it. Even the carrot avoiders liked it. Easy, quick, and serves well hot, cold or in between.

Different and interesting. I made this sort of last minute to accompany grilled lamb, tabbouleh, and orzo salad. It fit right in to the eastern Mediterranean theme and tasted great. I doubled the recipe and three of us finished it and could have eaten more.

I"ve made this recipe numerous times since it first came out in 2000. It's tasty without being too spicy; pairs beautifully with any moroccan dish. I like it because its a colorful, easy, make-ahead side dish. Even my kids like these carrots! Careful not to over cook the carrots, though. Mushy carrots are awful no matter what!

It was a nice change from plain ol' steamed carrots, but I can't say I loved it. Was better cold the next day.

Yummy. It's just like what our Morrocan restaurant serves as part of their first course. Don't make the mistake of adding too much cayenne, like I did - it takes away from the carrots. The restaurant serves this with a cucumber salad and an eggplant salad all on the same dish, then serves it with a thick bread. You are encouraged to use your thumb like a spoon and eat the bread and salads together. We used flatware in our home, but the taste was still super!

I thought these carrots were okay, but then again, I'm not a big cooked carrots fan. I made these for my boyfriend who likes carrots, and he gobbled these up along w/ my leftovers.

As you can see I didn't give it any forks.. Won't be making again.. ever.

I'm always looking for ways to spice up carrots and this is definitely one of my favorites. It was a huge hit, I would make this again and again and again. I served it with Pork tenderloin with mojo sauce (also from this site) the two go so well together. This is a keeper.

Great twist on 'boring' old carrots. The oil adds moisture and the spices just enough flavor but not too much. Instead of steaming the carrots, I microwaved them for 3 minutes with a little bit of water and they turned out great!

I've made this a few times now as part of a dinner party menu. For a side dish it is flavorful, easy, and can be done slightly ahead of time -- very important criteria when the rest of the menu might require special attention. I buy the carrot "chips" to cut down on prep time and serve them room temp -- I will definitely keep this in my repertoire!

I made 6 times the recipe for a party and should have followed Canadian Caterer's suggestion of slightly reducing the oil when multiplying. Still, they had great flavor and were a big hit. The flavor actually improves noticeably as they sit and cool to room temperature. I tried a couple when they were hot and was disappointed, but loved them 2 hours later. They're the perfect party/buffet fare since they really need to be made ahead.

I just love this recipe! It has become one of my entertaining staples because of its great taste, ease of preparation and the fact that the dish is served at room temperature. I add chopped cilantro for both colour and lift. I also am careful not to use too much oil when making the carrots in quantity. This recipe goes very well with vegetarian moussaka, crusty bread and a simple salad.

We loved this simple carrot recipe. Followed the recipe exactly. After tasting, I can easily see how some of the recommendations made by other reviewers (i.e., adding parsley, raisins, cilantro) would work wonderfully with this basic recipe.

Great flavor and very easy to make. They went great with Chicken Marsala and Rosemary Herb potatoes.

This was a welcome change from plain or glazed carrots. The flavors blended well with my curried chicken & potatos and, let's face it, how much easier could it be?!

I feel bad, but I was just not impressed with these carrots. I made them for a vegetarian African-themed buffet and, unlike everything else on my menu, they just got passed over by my guests. I ended up pitching the leftovers rather than saving them.

We loved this dish! We had it with the spiced-rub butterflied leg of lamb in the July 00 issue of Bon Apetit and some saffron rice!! yum!!!

I've made this several times, and just made this for a party for 80. People love it - got rave reviews. I add chopped parsley for both color and taste - definitely at least on top for presentation. Yummy as well as economical and easy.

I have made this numerous times and get rave reviews every single time. The first time, I served it room temperature at a pot luck barbeque and every single carrot was inhaled. It is quick, easy and inexpensive.

Nice flavors --- instead of steaming the carrots, I microwaved them for just a few minutes.

This was so easy and the flavors were nicely complex. I did add some minced cilantro, for color. Everyone loved it!

We really like Moroccan food but find it time consuming to prepare. This dish is so quick and easy and makes an excellent side to many main dishes. I also added raisins that had been "plumped" when cooking the carrots.

Really good. Be sure not to overcook the carrots -- mine were just crunchy and just the way I like them. The cinnamon and garlic mix of flavors (with the lemon and the olive oil and cumin) is really special. Just exotic enough to be charming, but still delicious. Very pretty around Halloween with the black of the Black Olives with Harissa (in the Epicurious recipe file). Great leftovers!

I agree with the previous review - the spices complimented the carrots nicely, and it went very well with a Moroccan-themed dinner!

I don't normally care for cooked carrots, but these were great in flavor and texture!
