We grow blackberries and apricots so I make this every summer. It is a huge crowd pleaser! I use fewer apricots and I cut them into smaller chunks. Other than that, I follow the recipe pretty closely and it turns out delicious every time. Ripe, organic fruit makes a big difference!

I am an apricot junkie and the filling was a disappointment. The crust on this is pretty good, but not worth the calories. I will stick with the Apricot Cherry Crisp from Green's cookbook (add a little almond extract to the filling).

This was awful despite having followed the recipe to the letter. What a waste of good fruit and ingredients. I was embarrassed to serve it. I gave it one fork b/c the topping was OK.

Very tasty recipe, I would use just a mixture of berries, but man alive was it tasty!! I love the idea of the stars cut out of the dough, very festive.

This cobbler is divine! I used slightly less sugar, as the fresh berries and apricots were very sweet. The biscuit topping is heavenly. I rolled out the dough and cut stars, and served with vanilla ice cream. This is a beautiful summer dessert.

3 1/2 forks. Really a fabulous and easy dessert. We made it with blackberries, nectarines & peaches, added 1/2 t cinnamon to the biscuit mix, and laid the biscuits out on top rather than in a lattice.

This has been my standard cobbler recipe for years--look no further; this is it. I usually make with peaches and sometimes other fruit, such as cherries. Easy to double, too.

Oh my - made this cobbler for a Summer dinner party - and our guests went crazy. It was fantastic!!! Wouldn't make any changes, other than the biscuit topping - instead of making lattice, I just spread the biscuit topping evenly over the fruit. Came out incredible!!!

I prepared this for Fourth of July dinner to absolute RAVES and second helpings. Instead of making a lattice, I rolled the dough 1/4 inch thick and cut with a star-shaped cookie cutter, sprinkled them with sliced almonds and baked separatly, then served the berry mixture in a flat soup bowl topped with the star 'cookies'. I should also mention that I omitted the apricots and used only tons of blackberries. YUM.

Excellent! My whole family loved it. It was easy to prepare and the biscuit topping was excellent.

Amazing! If I did this again I would just make the filling and spoon it over shortbread bisquits and top with ice cream. I was unable to purchase fresh blackberries but frozen was fabulous anyways. WOW. This was just to die for! You have to try it!
