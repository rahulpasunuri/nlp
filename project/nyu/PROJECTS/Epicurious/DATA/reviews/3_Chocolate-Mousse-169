I picked this recipe because my client wanted a chocolate mousse that was low fat. This is the one! It doesn't have the mouthfeel of a traditional mousse, but I think it's very good considering it's only 7g. of fat per serving. It's easy to make, and I didn't even have any cream of tartar. Thank goodness for the Cuisinart hand mixer with the balloon whisk! You can increase the intensity with the chocolate you use.

This was pretty good, but not nearly as satisfying as the real thing. To those reviewers that said it was gummy, didn't get the volume, etc....BEAT BEAT BEAT the custard mixture until it triples! Also, if the liquid is too hot, it won't mount, so watch your temperature. As for grainyness...you weren't supposed to use coffee grinds...brew the coffee and melt the chocolate in it.

I'm with the other NYC reviewer. Low volume, gummy, and altogether unpleasant. I'll stick to cooked mousses.

WHEN MAKING MOUSSE ITS A LOT EASIER TO USE PASTURIZED EGGS WHITES AND YOLKS ELIMINATING THE NEED TO COOK EGGS. JUST WHIP EACH SEPERATLY WITH SUGAR, FOLD TOGETHER, ADD MELTED CHOCOLATE AND BUTTER, AND THEN FOLD IN WHIPPED CREAM. FOOL PROOF.

This was fantastic and really easy to make. I was a little intimidated by the whole double boiler thing, as I've had very bad luck in the dessert department in the past, but this was very simple and really fabulous.

This recipe was delicious and not too difficult to make (compared to any other non-instant mousse. I served it between layers of a butter rum cake and loved the way the dessert turned out.

I can't help but wonder if the person who just rated filtered the coffee or just added coffee grains. That would explain a lot. The recipe doesn't say to filter the coffee but one would assume... I thought it was wonderful and have friends ask for it over and over again. And, it is quite easy.

This recipe did not go well for me. There is not enough instruction in the recipe for cooks who have never made a mousse before. Even though I used an electric beater, I only yielded two cups of mousse instead of six. So the coffee grinds were over-concentrated, and the dessert was heavy and grainy. A disappointment.

Difficult? If you want simple, buy a Knorr mousse mix. Otherwise, have fun in the kitchen and give this one a try. Also, I can't think of a better combination than coffee AND chocolate. Some people are just too uptight, no?

Some of us don't like coffee in any way, shape, or form -- to be served a chocolate mousse with coffee might be considered an affront.

Oh please....mousse does not have to be that difficult to be good.
