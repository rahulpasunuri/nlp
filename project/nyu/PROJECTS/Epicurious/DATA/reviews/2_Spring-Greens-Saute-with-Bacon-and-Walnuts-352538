I'm not a huge veggie fan but realize I should integrate more into our diets. I substituted pine nuts for walnuts and used lemon infused olive oil and topped with blue cheese. It was a nice side with pork.

I would give this a zero fork rating if they had one. My husband and I never tried dandilion greens before and we were very disappointed in the taste of this recipe. I followed the recipe to a 'T' including adding a splash of vinagar, regaurdless the dandilion greens were VERY VERY bitter. I used all dandilion greens, out of a choice that was given of three different types of greens. Maybe this dish was supposed to taste bitter and my husband and I just don't care for that much intense bitterness??? Im not sure if this is just a personal dislike of dandilion greens or if indeed the recipe is no good. Somone who is a fan of, or knows more about dandilion greens would be useful to gather an opinion from. As for us, it is a 'NO'.

Excellent use of my CSA spring greens. I added a splash of Balsamic vinegar at the end and used Ementhaler instead of Gruyere (had Ementhaler on hand.) Delicious recipe!
