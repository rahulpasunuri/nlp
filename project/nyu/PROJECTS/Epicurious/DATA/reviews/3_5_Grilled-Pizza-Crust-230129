Easy & delish. We don't have a grill or grill pan but put the crust on the back of a cast-iron skillet & stuck it under the broiler. Used 1 tbs of salt, which still seemed excessive. Will try again gradually reducing the salt to a healthier & more palatable level. Definitely a keeper, in spite of the salt issue, which is minor.

As my first attempt of this recipe--I was intrigued by the lack of "rise" step--I would certainly make it again. That said, my pizza crusts came out more the consistency of roti Indian bread. Before combining the yeast and flour mixtures, I added a good couple teaspoons of garlic powder, teaspoon dried oregano, and a tablespoon of chopped fresh chives to the flour mixture. I look forward to making pizzas out of it, but it will be a very versatile bread--I would serve it with Indian food, use it for sandwiches, will be fantastic with hummus or any dip...

Very easy and very tasty. Appreciated the notes on the salt which I cut in half. I used a grill pan on the stove top with excellent results. Added toppings and finished in the oven at 425 degrees for about 8 minutes. Just wondering: has anyone frozen the dough?

This is a great recipe - but be real careful with the salt. Way too much salt for our taste. If using regular salt, reduce to about 1/2T

I'm still apologizing to my family for this one. Run, don't walk....it was a strange texture and never developed to a real pizza crust. Ick.....If you want a good one try to find Fresco's recipe from their cookbook. That one is delish we've made it many times so we thought this one might compare because of the molasses. Similar component but it ended there. We threw alot of this away.

My eight year old son made this for dinner tonight. It's that easy and really good. Baked in the oven at 425 degrees.

They do mean teaspoons with the salt. Also, when I ran out of salt, I used garlic salt, tastes great! I reversed the proportions of regular and whole wheat flour, works just fine. Now if anyone has tips on how not to kill the yeast?

The crust turned out a bit tough - I'm not sure why.

I have no idea how this recipe works without needing a rising time, but boy does it work! I used rye flour instead of whole wheat, and used only 1 tsp sea salt to avoid the "pizza syndrome" of gulping water all night to remedy over-salty pepperoni pizza. That 1 tsp was perfect. I did have to add 1/4 c extra water to make the dough form. We loaded on the toppings, so we baked the assembled pies in the oven at 375 for 30 minutes: amazingly, that gave stellar results. (We made two 16"-diameter pies.) Great flavor, crunchy and thin. Tip: brush the crusts with olive oil before topping with mushy things or with sauce: it keeps the crust crisp by protecting it from any watery substances.

Great pizza crust! I even substituted all regular flour and it came out great! I also cooked it in the oven because it was storming today. 11 minutes at 425f and then about 7 minutes with the toppings.

Love this recipe, yes, too much salt. But once you adjust that, it's great. It's a good staple to have in your repetoire. I usually divide into 4 portions and freeze 3 of them. Great for grilled pizza.

good catch on the salt. The maximum would be 1 1/2 TEASPOONS. Could use less if trying to cut salt. Otherwise the recipe looks good.

I have not tried this recipe yet. It calls for 2 1/2 tbsp of kosher salt. Could this be correct. please advise
