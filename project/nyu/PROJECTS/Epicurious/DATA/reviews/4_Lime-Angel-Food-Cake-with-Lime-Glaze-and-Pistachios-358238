I made this recipe using boxed angel food cake mix, adding the lime zest. It was fantastic. Angel food cake is one of those things that I don't think tastes any better making it from scratch, so I saved on the time and expense.

I always make creme brulee with extra yolks. Or homemade noodles, cream pies, ice cream.

I've made this cake at least 10 times....in fact I made it today per a request, it NEVER disappoints. Sometimes the Angel food cake doesn't rise as much as other but the pistachios with the lime is such a great flavor combination. It is a crowd pleaser every time.

Made it with lemon instead of limes and lightly toasted pistachios. Wonderful. The recipe calls for 1 1/2 cups of superfine sugar, but ends up using only 1 cup in the method. I used only 1 cup as the method described. I also used a nonstick pan because its the one I have; the cake did not raise as much as the one on the photo of the original recipe but it tasted delicious and had a very light, feathery texture.

I hardly could find cake flour here in Kuwait, so I used all purpose flour and made it 2 cups eggwhite. Very good result. I also flavored it with orange and almonds. The cake is so juicy. Excellent!

I followed the recipe as written, then made it again with grapefruit in place of the lime and almonds in place of the pistachios. Both were delicious-even the folks who don't particularly care for angel food cake loved it. What's not mentioned is that this is also a temptingly beautiful cake.

This was my first angel food cake, and it was a hit. Nice and light with a beautiful presentation. Followed the directions exactly with the exception of 1) using roasted salted pistachios (since i couldn't find unsalted raw) and 2) probably preparing slightly more pistachios than needed.

i sort of wish there were more reviews because i ruined my cake. it was just a frothy runny mess that never stiffened. i suppose i didn't beat my eggs long enough before continuing with the other step but i am not sure. i did add a bit of lime juice to the whites, vanilla, sugar mixture before cream of tartar. maybe a chemical problem? pretty disappointed.

Great recipe. It was hard to find unsalted shelled pistachios even the health store didn't have them. I put lime zest in the glaze and syrup which made it taste and look better.

Fabulous, light beautiful dessert! I forgot to buy pistachios so I left it out. And I served with homemade lime curd (good way to use the yolks!).

Wonderful recipe!! If you are in a pinch, use an angel food cake from a box (I know--cop out)

Love it! Made for Mother's Day and it is fantastic. Served with lightly sweetend whipped cream as the finish to a Caribbean-themed meal. Perfect proportions of light texture, sweetness, crunchy crust, tart refreshing citrus. I'll definitely make again.

I've made this cake three times! The first time I used lime since that's what the recipe called for. The next time, I started making it and, horrors, had no lime. So I used grapefruit instead and it was delicious. The cake in the oven right now is also made with grapefruit. I'm thinking any citrus fruit will be good. I've yet to use pistachios as we aren't that crazy about nuts around here. And, I also get my egg whites from making ice cream - all those yolks!!!!!

I also made this for Easter, it was sooo delish - I couldn't find raw pistachios but it didn't matter - cooked worked great...the lime flavor and the airy and sweet cake - you can't do better for subtle and tasty combined.

I can not find a non-stick angel food pan anywhere! Did anyone make with a non-stick? Can't wait to try this recipe . . .

Everyone loved the flavor of this cake. I didn't have any pistachios so I left them off and it was still great. Very lite and tasty

I have never made an angel food cake before, and was thus a little nervous, but this recipe produced a very tasty and fluffy cake. I even used a dreaded non-stick cake pan, and had no trouble with the cake rising. The cake didn't even fall out when inverted, but came out easily with the help of a sharp knife. As for flavor, I think the pistachio coating really makes the cake. I ended up using salted pistachios, and the crunchy, slightly salty layer is a very nice counterpoint to the lightly-flavored cake.

To the reviewer wondering what to do with the leftover yolks: make ice cream! I actually have a bunch of leftover whites in my freezer from making ice cream that I plan to use in this recipe.

I made this recipe for Easter with rave reviews, and then I brought it last night to book club. This recipe is a hit. The lightness of the angel food cake, the tangy lime, and the crunch of the pistachio. You will love it.

This was our Easter dessert. It was delicious. Light and fluffy and best of all healthy! We served it with lemon sorbet. Yum!

Any suggestions as to what to make with the left over yolks?

Perfect spring-time dessert. The lime in the cake is not too overpowering, but just right to give it a delicious flavor. Definitely need more than 2 oz of pistachios to coat the entire thing.

I made this recipe for a dinner party with 8 guests. They loved it! It was easy and taste was great and so light!
