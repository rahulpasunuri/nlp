Way too sweet! if I would make this again I would use regular coconut milk wit a bit of brown sugar, less lime juice, extra garlic, extra cumin but I guess it is easier to just try another recipe..

I had a wonderful Jamaican curry chicken which tasted as if it would have these ingredients. I am looking to try it. Can anyone tell me what kind of curry to use or whether that matters here?

Marinated chicken overnight in the sauce which I made exactly according to the recipe & saved some for dipping. Really good stuff!

Whoa, good stuff. I marinated tilapia in this for an hour then covered it and popped it in the oven. Turned out great with no modifications and very low stress.

I don't know what the Vegas cook did, but I get so many request to make this with chicken that I don't even need the recipe any more because I know it by heart. In fact I am doing it for company tonight. I use Tyson Chicken fillets that are already flattened. This makes the chicken all the same thickness so that it cooks evenly on the grill. The chicken is always moist and I have yet to hear anybody that does not insist on the recipe or wants me to cook it every time they come over.

I am really surprised that this got 15 good reviews. It was edible, thats all I'll give it. Coconiut cream is super sweet, like pure sugar syrup. If thats okay with you then maybe you will like it. I had to tone it way down with some unsweetened coconut milk and more curry powder.

Used this sauce on shrimp kebobs with pineapple and red pepper... Phenomenal! I couldn't make 'em fast enough for my tropical-themed summer party.

FYI... Coco Lopez is more readily available than you think. It's usually near the bloody mary and margarita mixes in the grocery store.

I gave this a 3 because coconut cream isn't always readily available and I had to do quite a lot to make up for it. So, I too used coconut milk and had excellent results by doing the following: use only 1/4 C fresh lime juice, 1 Tbsp lime zest, 1/4 C light brown sugar, 1/3 C unsweetened desicated coconut. In the sauce to pass at the table I used the suggestion of adding fresh cilantro. Excellent, EXCELLENT! I'll definately make this again. Perhaps tossed with pasta under the chicken next time.

I did not read this recipe closely enough and used coconut milk instead of coconut cream. I'm not even sure what cocnut cream is, but this recipe was no good without it! Since it was so easy to make and received such rave reviews, I'll retry with the right ingredient.

This was yummy! I used it to marinate shrimp then grilled. Going to make coconut shrimp next time and use this as a dipping sauce.

This was soooo good. Made it for a dinner party and everyone absolutely loved it. We tripled the recipe and used half as a marinade on quatered chickens. Served the balance as a sauce. Really so good. This will become a standard for us.

I used coconut milk instead of cream and I add honey to this sauce. I used thin slices of boneless chicken breast and I let it marinate for 8 hours. The chicken was delisous and my family and I really like it. It is an easy and quick recipe that I will make again.

I thought this lacked a punch. It needs something else, but I am not sure what. Maybe garlic? I will make again, but will play with it some.

This sauce is great! I used it as a chicken marinade overnight; put the the chicken, sauce and some potatoes in a baking bag for @45 minutes; serve with rice and beans, and sweet plaintains! perfect Sunday dinner!

This is one of summer favorites, great with chicken, fish and pork. We like to serve it with some spicy black beans and rice. Its a fast dish to prepare as you don't have to marinate the meat. You can put it together while the fire is getting hot. ENJOY

Try this with salmon. It's excellent. I marinated the salmon fillets overnight then baked the salmon with the marinade in a 350 degree oven for 15 - 20 minutes. It was great over a stir-fried rice with carrots. This marinade froze well.

I've used this marinade many times, and it is excellent with shrimp or chicken. It is easy, but much more interesting than most marinades.

This is a quick, easy and absolutely delicious dish. The sauce is addictive - make certain to leave some to pass around. Very good with a nice jasmine rice.
