the fish and the salad were both bland, but the rice cakes were crispy and full of flavors. Will definitely make the rice cakes again, to go with some other mains

VERY VERY labor intensive. The fish was okay, the rice fritters were the real hit!

This is a great meal, really tasty, and pretty enough for company. I highly recommend preparing all the sauces and fritters the day before. Then it is actually a really easy, delicious dinner.

This was okay, but not good enough to make again. Skip the pea shoots and jicama and use the dressing on some other mixture of vegetables. The rice fritters were good, but not worth the effort. The marinated mahi mahi was the highlight of the dish.

Wow, great recipe. I will make this one often. I substituted the slaw with baby greens, avacado slices in a fan. Tasted great! The fish has a wonderful color.

Excellent! We served for New Years Eve, with everyone in the kitchen helping to cook. It was great fun! After trying several markets, I could not find pea sprouts. A good substitute was thinly sliced pea pods. In fact, we liked the extra crunch that the pea pods gave, so I wouldn't bother looking for pea sprouts again.

This was just another terrific meal from the January 2007 issue! We couldn't get Mahi-Mahi, so we used Alaskan cod and it was really quite nice. The fritters and sauce are really oustanding. I also couldn't find jicama or pea sprouts, so I used sunchokes and red peppers in the slaw dressing--it's just a nice crunchy contrast to the fish. Great meal!

I LOVED this recipe, but it was labor intensive.The fritters were wonderful. I used Splenda instead of sugar. I bought pre-made broccoli/carrot/red cabbage salad mix and added red and yellow peppers to the jicama and sprouts. I am going to try this with chicken next time.

I loved this preparation. The rice cakes are what made it, I also think the slaw was incredible. The fish was fine, however the standouts were the rice and slaw. Be great with grilled shrimp, or scallops in same marinade. The flavors went on and on and on.

The mahi mahi & slaw were good, not over the top. However, we LOVED the rice fritters & sauce - we will be making these again.
