I didn't make the wontons, but I enjoyed the ice cream. I found it a bit eggy by itself, but it was great with cherry sorbet. I served it for a dinner party and everyone loved it. Next time I think I'll just steep some ginger in a non-custard ice cream, though.

You'll grow old waiting for the custard to reach 170 degrees on a low setting! Turn it up to medium and stir. If you don't have the thermometer handy, use your wooden spoon. When the custard is ready you should be able to coat the spoon rather thickly and take your finger and run it down the back of the spoon. You should see a clear track in the custard. This made a nice, simple ginger ice cream.

Although I didn't make the ice cream, i did make the wontons, although it seemed that they tasted a bit stale... is there any way to avoid this?

This recipe was a little time consuming but well worth it. I didn't change the wonton at all but I did add some finely chopped crystallized ginger to the ice cream. The contrast of the rich gingery ice cream together with the crisp chocolate wonton is fantastic.
