I made this for a New Year's Eve party since I was looking for something relatively easy and using champagne as an ingredient. I found the peach ice cream, but of course not the white peaches. I decided to use frozen peaches as another reviewer suggested - UGH, I won't do that again, they were completely digusting. The ice cream, cassis and champagne were all fine together, but fresh peaches are a must. Next time I'll try what I almost did: raspberries and either a raspberry sorbet or just plain 'ol vanilla. You can switch this up using any flavor you want, I expect.

My guests with sophisticated palates were wowed by this dessert. It's fantastic. I couldn't find peach ice cream so I used a good quality raspberry swirl ice cream. It needs the creaminess of ice cream to melt into the champagne (rather than a sorbet). I served it in large martini glasses and used a mini-ice cream scoop to make smaller balls of ice cream (I made 3 ice cream balls) so that it wasn't too much to eat. Just arrange all the ingredients in a pretty way and presto - a very sophisticated taste and presentation. I'll definately make again and again during Ontario peach season.

The best adult ice cream float I have EVER had! I used Ben and Jerry's Peach Cobbler ice cream...DEE-LISH!

I absolutely love this recipe! Peach is one of my favorite fruit flavors, so I was excited to find this dessert. I had to look EVERYWHERE to find peach ice cream, but the creamy texture it gave when it melted into the other ingredients was well worth the search. I also used sparkling wine (I have never been a huge champagne fan) and added a splash of peach schnapps for a little extra peach flavor. I will definitely keep this recipe in my collection for future use!

Served this to a large crowd and they loved it. I did use frozen peaches which worked out great.

This was absolutely delicious!! Couldn't find any peach ice cream, instead substituted with peach sorbet. First time I made this, I sliced up the peaches & followed the recipe exactly. Minus using Collins glasses, tall pilsner ones work just fine. Once the sorbet melted a bit into the champagne & the cassis it was heaven from there on. The second time I whipped this up, I pureed the peaches. Ehhh, probably won't do that again. The drink lost a bit of texture when the peaches were pureed. I loved the bit of peach chunks that were sucked through a wide barrel straw. Definitely will use this recipe for entertaining & relaxing by the pool.

This is my new favorite quick, easy dessert for hot August nights. But after trying it made some changes that I think really improved it and my guests seem to think so too. Instead of champagne, which can be too dry, I've been using a local sparkling wine, Kramer Vineyard's Celebration Sparkling Muller Thurgau. The sweeter wine really goes better with the peaches and ice cream. In keeping with the Oregon theme, I use Brandy Peak's Oregon Blackberry liqueur and Tillamook Fresh Peach Ice Cream. Use any size clear glass and just adjust the amounts of everything to fit the glass and your guests' appetites. On a hot night there is no better dessert.

The temp hit 99 in Central Park yesterday prompting an attempt of this recipe. Then again, anything with peaches in it is worth a try. There must be an enormous collins glass available somewhere that could accomodate an entire peach, three "scoops" of ice cream and the rest... However, tweaking the vessel requirements provides for better melding of flavors and easier access to the contents. Make sure the peaches are quite ripe. Our floats weren't quite as elegant as the photo, but our ale pint glasses substituted nicely. Maybe it was the heat, or maybe it was the peaches, but we were quite refreshed.
