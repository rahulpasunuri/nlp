While the mix of strawberry and vanilla ice cream was lovely, this just didn't work out for me. The ice cream didn't stick to the popsicle stick, meaning we had to scoop it out with spoons. A big disappointment! Next time I'll just make strawberry swirl ice cream or serve vanilla ice cream with jam on top.
