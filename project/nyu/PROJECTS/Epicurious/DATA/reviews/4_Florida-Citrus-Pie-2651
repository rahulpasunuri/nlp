Be careful making this recipe because it leaves out one of the steps. You have to whip the 1 1/4 cup of cream and then fold into the cooled grapefruit reduction/lime juice and chocolate mixture. Aside from that, the recipe is fantastic. Very tart and refreshing. I only used 6 oz of chocolate instead of 8 and the texture and consistency was perfect and it set perfectly too. Everyone loved it. I think it makes a perfect Easter dinner desert.

I made this pie back when it was featured in Bon Appetit back in 1992 and it was a big hit. I lost the recipe and was delighted to find it online. Thanks for the previous reviews that point out the missing step in the filling, after a 15 year time span in making this pie I would have been at a loss without it! It really is a yummy pie, I highly recommend it.

Well, this was a very weird dessert. While the tanginess was nice, it might have actually been better without the white chocolate (I used Lindt, so the quality was fine). The crust was delicious, although I used almonds because I didn't have macadamia nuts. While this was original in flavor, I can see why very few pies/tarts use grapefruit in the filling!

Thank you to the previous reviews! I made this for Easter brunch and it was great. It was light and refreshing after a feast but also decadent if you can believe that! Use a good quality chocolate. The crust is to die for.

This recipe is missing a step! I added the whipped 1 1/4c cream to the chilled mixture (on the advice of the other reviewer - thank you), but I didn't know that at that point it needs to be chilled AGAIN - probably overnight - and then add the whipped cream topping. I served it after about 4 hours refrigerating, and it wasn't totally set. The next day, however, it was perfect. Everyone loved it anyway - it tastes great & it's really unusual.

I have been making this pie for Thanksgiving for over 10 yrs. I lost the edition that had the recipe. I have requests for this pie year after year, I used to be a pastry chef and I must say I have never had a pie that was reequested as much as this one. It is expensive but how wonderful....

The integral part of the filling has been ommited from the posted recipe. The 1 1/4 cups of cream in the filling needs to be whipped to soft peaks and then added to the cooled chocolate/juice mixture. Then the mixture is to be poured into the prepared pie shell. If you follow the recipe with this little additional step then you are sure to have a hit on your hands.
