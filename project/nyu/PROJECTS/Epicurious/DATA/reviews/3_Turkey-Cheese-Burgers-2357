These are delicious for a weeknight meal. I make a whole bunch at once and freeze them. I find they they are much better cooked in a pan than on the grill.

This will be a keeper at our house. Our 3 kids loved these burgers.

These were good, but my husband didn't care for the tarragon. He suggested rosemary instead.
