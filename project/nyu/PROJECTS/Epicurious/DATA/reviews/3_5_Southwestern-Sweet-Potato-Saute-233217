It was easy enough to cook, I just cut the recipe down to a personal serving. I didn't have any pepitas, but it tasted great without!

Large skillet? Try a heavy stew pot. This is a lot of sweet potato, and it took longer to cook than I anticipated. I added the leftovers to a moroccan-flavored stew, and that was tasty too. This is a forgiving recipe with many possibilities for improvisation.
