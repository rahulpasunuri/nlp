Very simple salad with great flavor. Used Honey Crisp apples and romaine. Dressing is great! The simple but very tasty; worked very nicely for dinner party salad. Will definitely make salad as is again. Will also use the dressing with other salad ingredient combinations!

This had a wonderfully light, refreshing flavor. I increased the olive oil to 3/4 cup for a more classic 3-1 oil to vinegar ratio; then had leftover dressing, which was fine w/me! Served over a Passover salad of romaine, endive, radicchio, chopped parsley, and thinly sliced apple. The sweet and bitter flavors balanced each other perfectly.

I love this salad - I used honeycrisp apples and have added honey goat cheese or feta and/or pine nuts - all turns out great. Everyone loves it.

I love the dressing! Great flavor. I also added walnuts, avocado and feta! Simple but great flavors.

I really liked this recipe. The dressing is excellent with the apple. I suspect that it would not be so delicious without the apple. I halved the dressing and greens but added a whole Macoun apple. Will make this again and again. Guests enjoyed it too.

I was looking for a cider vinagrette to serve w/ my spinach salad w/ bacon & honeycrisp apples - -this was a perfect complement! I made it exactly as is (ok I eyeballed the honey - - probably was only 1 tsp). I will make this again.

Made this for Thanksgiving, and it was very nice. Perfect light salad to start the meal. The dressing is great, and I have made it several other times. I have also adapted it for other salads; used clementine infused oil Very tasty.

Don't like shallots so I left those out and I think that's what it was missing. I kept thinking that it needed something. Feta would have been nice, the one time I don't read the reviews! May try again if I have any leftover cider.

Very simple and VERY tasty. I added thin slices of red onion and pumpkin seeds to my first attempt, and it was enjoyed by all! It's a keeper!

I was looking for something light and different to serve at Thanksgiving. It certainly "fit the bill"! I followed the dressing portion of the recipe exactly, but as previous reviewers mentioned, I added the pomegranate seeds (from Trader Joe's)and goat cheese to the greens and apples. It received rave reviews from everyone and my daughter-in-law asked for the recipe for a potluck she was going to a few days later.

I took this to my husband at work for a spring picnic outside, along with some toasted pita and white bean dip. It was so refreshing and flavorful -- piquant, yet sweet, and just all-around enjoyable. I used a gala apple, which was great. I did not add cheese, and I'm glad I didn't....it would have clouded the crisp flavor medley. Some toasted pecans would have been quite tasty, however, had I had time. Definitely give this a try!

This salad received rave reviews from my family. I substituted the red apple for a golden delicios, added gorgonzola cheese and candied walnuts.

Delicious! I made this for a big Thanksgiving dinner where it was a huge hit and have already made it twice since then for just myself and my husband. I added a little more honey to the vinaigrette per earlier reviews, and serve the dressing on mixed greens with apple pieces, pomegranate seeds, goat cheese, and chopped walnuts. It is an amazing combination.

Good basic salad. Was nice as a light starter for a Thanksgiving meal. I added walnuts. The dressing was good.

I made this for dinner last night and thought it was delicious! I made the dressing ahead of time and added a bit of sugar to it (I like my dressing a tiny sweeter) and added crumbled feta and candied almonds to the salad. Fantastic.

An elegant salad course for Thanksgiving or any other dinner...instead of apples, we used ripe pear slices. The pears, along with some goat cheese crumbles and some walnuts, were placed atop watercress, then given a splash of the dressing. Very easy to make as well.

I really liked the dressing and the way the apples complimented it in the salad. I agree that some goat cheese and walnuts or pecans would be a good addition to the salad.

The dressing really makes this salad special. The second time I made it, I added some almonds and goat cheese and liked it even more.

This has become a standby, especially in the winter months. I usually toss in some toasted almonds and use a nice quality olive oil. Goes well with everything from grilled meats and roasts to lasagna.

I made this salad for a dinner party and it was great! Very easy and tasty. I used an organic braeburn apple and organic baby greens.

Thank you to everyone for your suggestions. Granny smith apples were a good choice. Make sure you use a good quality Apple Cider Vinegar and you will achieve good results. The flavours worked perfectly together. Unfortunately, I ended up eating the entire salad myself!

I enjoy making different salads and this will be a keeper. I used a fuji apple and also used some spiced walnuts-Cayanne and sugar flavorings. I think the guests really like it and it is so easy. I made the dressing the night before and just let it come to room temp. b/f serving.

I first made this recipe several years ago, and we now call it "our house salad" since it's our favorite salad. It's excellent. I gave this recipe to my sister and she's taken it to dinner parties where it outshines the featured entrees.

This was alright but not the best. I found the dressing a little on the heavy side, however I must say I did use regular olive oil rather than light oil oil. Next time I will use light olive oil.

I clipped this recipe from my Bon Appetit magazine when it was first published and found it the other day in my recipe box. It sounded easy, so I tried it out for a dinner party last night. Everyone asked for seconds. I used romaine, endive, and red leaf lettuce (for extra color). I used a Braeburn apple, because they are usually very crisp, and sliced it a little ahead of time (sprinking with lemon juice to prevent turning brown) because my other dishes needed last-minute attention. I made the dressing a day ahead to enhance the flavors. All in all, very good!

This salad was fabulous! Made an elegant presentation, and was finished off quickly. The dressing is delicious and will make it as a "stock" recipe for other salads. Also, browned some Pederson's Apple Smoked Bacon and crumbled atop salad. Yum Yum!!!

I personally thought this was a nice update on salad. The vinaigrette was wonderful, and would do very well as a sauce for meats, etc. I served this to three other people- one person really liked it, one thought it was okay(but really liked the dressing), and one took only a couple of bites. I liked it!!!!

This is an absolutely delicious salad for a change. We really enjoyed it. We used the extra dressing on a steak salad the next day and it was equsally delicious without the apples. Very nice.

Oh my gosh, this was good. My husband and I really enjoyed this salad. I would suggest making the dressing a little ahead of time to let the flavors blend. I made the full recipe for the dressing, (more for later, yum) but just made enough greens (spring mix) for two. I used a Braeburn apple, which is red, but I agree also, that although green, for taste the Granny Smith would be great. Whatever apple you use, this is yummy.

The salad dressing makes this salad. I've made this salad two thanksgivings in a row, and I have people asking me for the recipe for the dressing. Also, the granny smith apples are perfect for this salad.

Very tasty and easy to make! Nice change from the traditional cole slaw. Received great reviews. Not sure what a "crisp red-skinned apple" is, but when I make it again I will use a granny smith apple, since I know what that is.

Top this salad with toasted walnuts and crumbled blue cheese - very tasty and light first course or side dish with any autumn or holiday meal! Maybe add dried cranberries or golden raisins, too?

Don't listen to KS. Try it out for yourself. For such a simple dressing it's pretty tasty -and a nice change from the usual oil and vinegar dressings. Use a high quality cider vinegar - it makes all the difference.

Very tasty and extremely easy. I have already made it again and again. First with fresh lettuce mix and then with baby spinach. I make the dressing ahead and shake in a covered jar.
