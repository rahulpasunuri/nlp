I found the crust difficult to work with, so I recommend rolling it out between 2 sheets of wax paper.

For a more spectacular presentation, I make this in a springform pan, which of course requires making a bigger round of dough to line the pan, and more layers of ingredients. I usually add red peppers from a jar, and sometimes other thinly sliced meats or colorful vegetables. Then I make dough cut-outs in decorative shapes to put on top of the top crust. The whole thing is great for a party buffet. Also, I don't bother to cook the ham and use fresh spinach, which I quickly saute and then wring out. I find pillow-size bags of clean fresh baby spinach a whole lot easier and more fun to cook with than the sad, frozen kind.

I thought this was very tasty, though my daughter found the mustard just a bit overpowering. I used store bought crusts which worked out fine. I really enjoyed the combination of flavors. After reading other reviews, I limited the spinach to one package, but think you could definitely get away with more if you like spinach. I do find myself thinking about ham substitutes for my vegetarian relatives. Portobellos instead of the ham? I almost feel like you could do this with a wide variety of different vegetables.

I must have done something wrong, as I thought this came out incredibly dry. I didn't even drain the spinach as much as they said to. I like the combination of flavors, just not the texture.

This was delicious and IMHO the amount of spinach was just right. But I love spinach. I used a smoked virginia ham and crust that I already had made, and it was in the oven in 30 minutes. It was even better as leftovers.

I made this recipe to use up some Swiss cheese and baked ham leftover from a party. I cut and trimmed the ham into julienne strips and lightly cooked it in butter. I also took it down to one package of spinach which worked well for me as I cheated and used two store bought deep dish pies, rich in butter for the bottom and top (prick the bottom crust several times before filling and defrost the shells to remove your top crust.) I also used some shallots with the onions. This was a really tasty pie to take to my monthly potluck dinner. The egg brush gives it a beautiful gloss.

This is a nice change from pot pies. Use 1/2 or one box of spinach, 2 boxes is too much for this recipe.

The ingredients didn't indicate how much carrots to use-I tried 1 cup grated and it worked out well. I recommend using a bit of galic as well
