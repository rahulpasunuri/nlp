Yum! Easy, quick, and simple. My very picky, foodie husband told me this was a keeper. Used Sockeye Salmon and forgot to buy green onions (would def. add them next time) I could not find yellow miso, so used red (not sure what kind of difference that makes?) and added fresh ginger (maybe .75 tsp). I had to cook a little longer. Next time I think maybe 5 min uncovered and 7-10 covered. A note on other reviews - under no circumstance leave out the orange zest, it really helps to make this dish!

I glazed this too thick and added more orange juice, both detracted from the dish but I see where this will be a keeper once I get the finesse of it.

I've made this recipe many times over the years, with very high quality wild salmon (here in Seattle we have access to great salmon). I found a couple tweaks that I find really add to this - 1) using mellow brown rice miso paste and 2) covering the top completely in green onions _before_ putting it in the broiler. This

I didn't care for this recipe. I don't know if it is because I burnt my miso, though, as I typically love things broiled in miso (eggplant comes to mind). Not sure if it was me who goofed here as I waited for it to blister and brown.

Miso paste is a little thick. Flavors are a little too salty, and the orange juice doesn't remedy that.

Wonderful recipe! Made it exactly as instructed and my entire family loved the salmon, even the non-fish eaters liked it. Would definitely make it again.

This was such a winner! I followed the miso glaze ingredients to a T, and then topped the salmon with some panko crumbs to add some texture. Perfect! Serve with your favorite green veggies, sauteed, & topped with soy sauce **To avoid bitterness from the orange peel, make sure to use a zester. The orange zest is flavorful, the white is bitter.**

yummy. very strong flavors. i like to cook with my kids. they have fun grating the orange peel. we tried this with halibut and also with red snapper. both were great.

This is very good. We have had it several times. The flavors balance nicely. I would caution against letting the miso glaze get too thick on the fish. It can be pasty. Also, mirin was easier to find than I thought. Our Safeway had it with the soy sauces and other asian foods. Lastly, this is similar to another recipe on epicurious: a lime and miso glaze on sea bass. That other recipe is a little lighter, if anyone was curious to check it out.

Very nice, I marinated for 20 minutes and then let the excess run off - it would have been too much otherwise.

This is absolutely wonderful and no additions or subtractions are necessary. If your fish is "fishy", its not fresh...period. And no amount of anything will make it less fishy. Use a micro plane for your orange zest. If you found this bland...your taste buds must be dead. Try it on any kind of fish, and a cedar plank on the grill is perfect.

Very tasty and simple. We loved the freshness the bit of orange added, and I liked another cook's suggestion for some ginger. The miso sauce is also excellent uncooked on plain, pan fried salmon. We'll make this one again.

i've made this dish twice and passed the recipe onto others. everyone loves it! simple, easy, and quick. good when paired with mashed potatoes and some sort of grilled veggies.

Yuk! Why didn't I listen to the reviews about the orange peel. Don't use it! It was bitter orange flavored miso. A waste of Salmon.

this was a fantastic recipie, one of the better salmon recipies i've made from this site. i paired it with some bitter greens (kale with apples and nutmeg) and wild grains. i added thyme and a little extra brown sugar and mirin to the recipie. i added white pepper and ginger which mellows it and gives it a more complex taste. i also cooked it in a pan on the stove which kept it really moist. really fantastic.

My family and I found this dish to be pretty unappealing. We are not fond of sweet dishes and the recipe did not seem to be too sweet, but the final product sure was. The shame of it is that I bought some expensive wild salmon for this dish and we were disappointed. I guess we are more the olive oil and fresh herbs on salmon types.

This is almost a weekly staple for my fiance and me. The combination of flavors is incredible. We always serve it with quinoa (with tamari and flax oil) and a cooked leafy green like kale or chard. We also bake it at 450 degrees for about 10 minutes rather than broil, and cut the sauce recipe in half if we are cooking for just the two of us. Enjoy!

Easy to make the sauce. Finding the miso paste wasn't as easy task. The sauce is a little too orangey flavored, I'd leave out the grated orange peel next time. But overall it had a very good taste.

Very nice dish. I used maple syrup instead of brown sugar. Hey, I'm Canadian, can't help myself! The orange and miso work very well with each other. Very simple dish - doesn't need to marinate two weeks to work ;-) Try it!

The fish was a bit dry because our filets were thick and we had to broil it longer. It did have a "fishy" taste, so maybe next we will try adding the ginger, as suggested below. We served a salad topped with orange slices anda sesame oriental dressing that complimented the fish perfectly.

We thought this recipe was very tasty. I added a little bit of wasabi paste the second time I made it and it was a good addition.

Don't understand why all the praise for this dull, nothing special, relatively bland tasting dish. (I followed the recipe to the T). So many other ways to enjoy salmon! Won't make it again.

This recipe was a very good start to a great dish. The miso, being very salty, required a tad more sweetness to offset it. Also, in Asian cooking a little ginger is always good for cutting the fishy-ness of seafood. My solution: in addition to a little grated ginger, I mixed in a spoonful of Dalfour's Ginger Orange Marmalade to the glaze. Poured onto a 2.5+ lb salmon fillet and broiled. Delish! Six adults and a 3-yr-old raved.

So delicious! So easy! I could eat this (and make this) time and time again. The orange adds so much to the miso marinade. yummy.

Easy recipe for a quick meal. To make this better I first seared the salmon, skinside down in a pan and then placed the pan under the brioler with the glaze. The result is a crispy skin and a perfectly done salmon still pink inside.

This dish is so easy and so delicious! The glaze takes seconds to prepare and tastes wonderful. I had to leave the salmon in my broiler for about 5 more minutes than the recipe calls for, but my broiler may just be slow. I highly recommend this recipe. Very tasty!!

This recipe is so easy. The only thing time consuming is traveling to the nearest Asian market to get the Miso and wine, but it's worth the effort. It is so delicious and light, nothing has to be added. The Miso lasts for at least three more times.

So delicious. So easy. Absolutely yummy! Don't forget to top with the onions!

Fast, easy pre prep, fresh for the summer and the cooking time is perfect. No dried out fish! Served this to guests with coconut ginger rice and cold veggie salad.

It was OK. I would make it again because it was different, but nothing to rave about.

Made this for dinner last night and both my husband and I really liked it. You have to watch it closely while it's in the broiler. I think I left it in for 1 1/2 minutes and it was bordering on burning. I had to broil the foil covered fish for about 10-12 minutes but it was just done with perfect texture and moistness. The flavor of the fish and glaze really blended well and the browned top added to the overall appeal of the recipe. Easy and quick too.

2-1/2 forks I thought it was good a bit salty & too much miso. Added more OJ and peel. I baked first and then broiled because the fish was too thick and I was afraid it would burn.Might have been a drop overcooked - I like it raw inside. Next time I'll just broil on top rack so it "crust" quickly.

I made this dish 2 times and my family loved it. I added a little extra grated orange peel. It is quick and easy. Will definitely make this dish again!!!

My husband couldn't get enough of this and although my 9 year old daughter didn't love the sauce, she liked the salmon. It was quick, light and simple.

We also really liked this dish... the citrus and miso work really well together, and the sugars in the sugar and the mirin give the glaze a nice depth. Just make sure to blend the miso and sugar *very well* to avoid lumps.

The recipe was simple and elegant. Australia's position and abundance of good seafood makes the asian-pacific fusion a natural. I did however, feel the warm, mellow miso base flavour of the sauce needed a little hot-spicy highlight to brighten it a bit. So I added a 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of finely grated galangal (if you can't get it fresh use the dried powdered variety)to the sauce just minutes before it is finished.

i dont know what everyone else it talking about. this recipe is wonderful. have made this a number of times and all my guests LOVE it. extra green onions are a great addition.

I liked the glaze ok, LOVE fish, just felt these two never 'got along'. The sauce was too emphatic... not good with an equally bold fish. This just wasn't a match made in heaven. Sea Bass with Oriental Sauce from here is not only easier but LOTS tastier.

I didn't think this was anything special.
