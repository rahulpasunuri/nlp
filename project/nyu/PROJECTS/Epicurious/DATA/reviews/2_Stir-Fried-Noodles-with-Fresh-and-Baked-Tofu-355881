Haven't made yet this but perusing for tofu recipes noticed that a few people had a questions about baked tofu, so thought I'd chime in. It's found in refrigerator cases and sold pre-baked in a few different flavors such as Savory, or teriyaki. Don't recall seeing it at general purpose supermarkets but Trader Joe's and Whole Foods both carry it. I've used it most in stir frys when I don't have time to flavor fresh tofu and it's key ingredient in summer rolls (on this site).

I found this pretty bland, as I expected from the sauce to veggies ratio. I added some chili paste and lime juice, though, and that helped.

I was interested because the ingrediaents look good. But I don't understand how the tofu is baked.

I haven't even tried it yet, but it's a little confusing. What's the deal with the baked tofu? Is it part of the package of tofu that's in the recipe?
