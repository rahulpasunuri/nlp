Kutia is a very traditional Christmas Eve dish, and is even believed to predate Christianity in Ukraine. So many variations of this exist. Some families eat this at the end of the Christmas Eve meal, rather than the beginning, since it is sweet. The cinnamon in this version is an interesting addition, as are the apricots (I'm not sure why they look green in the photo). My own family adds rose petal preserves to kutia.

In Canada, Ukrainian families who follow the traditional Christmas Eve meal always start with a serving of kutia. I make mine like baba did just simmer slowly adding water as needed (only I use my slow cooker) and then I sweeten with honey and sometimes add the poppyseed. Our family never added the fruit although many do.

To the previous reviewer - this dish is a traditional Christmas dish you only eat once a year if you celebrate the old-school Orthodox way.

I have lived my whole life in the Ukraine and have never seen this thing before.

All my attempts to cook poppy seeds so far have resulted in them being of rock hard sand-like texture. In my experience, the best creamiest texture is achived if you soak them overnight in cold tap water, then grind in a mortar with a teaspoon of sugar.

The poppy seeds taste better to me when boiled in milk with a little honey.

A quick great version! My family always added chopped walnuts (instead of the sliced almonds.)

Not quite like my babcha makes, but still very good. Tradition dictates that the man of the house takes a spoon full of kutia and throws the kutia onto the ceiling. If the kutia sticks it will be a good harvest year on the farm.
