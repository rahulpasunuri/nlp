The recipe as presented is really bland and boring. I added 1 tsp. garlic powder and substituted 1 1/2 tsp. celery salt which makes them much more flavorful. But I am still looking for something to top them with. Maybe a sour cream and chive combo to garnish using a decorative tip or something. They are pretty easy to make and it's great to have something to pull out of the freezer, it just needs to be jazzed up a lot.

I LOVED these! Used most of called for ingred. except I only had regular bread crumbs, and to make them even easier, I used the 1 lb. 4 oz. bag of Simply Potatoes Shredded Hash Browns. They worked perfectly and I think these are just great!! Think next time I will add a bit of chopped parsley to the mix. These will be made over and over... KIMBER

Basically the same ingredients as potato latkes (traditional Jewish food). I much prefer latkes for consistency and taste. If you are going to make them - add pepper.

I was quite disappointed in these after reading the reviews. I made them for a brunch and my guests and I did not like them much. I thought the taste was odd. The Hash Brown Brunch Casserole was gone in seconds, but I had tons of these leftover.

These are great! I love the fact that you can make them ahead of time. I've made them a few times for company and there are never any left overs.

Lots of changes but still yummy. I couldn't find Yukon potatoes so I substituted sweet potato (kumara here in NZ). Also couldn't find matzo meal so I substituted breadcrumbs. And lastly didn't have muffin tins so I just dropped rounded tablespoons on a well oiled cookie sheet - still stuck terribly but a spatula helped. They weren't the prettiest looking things but guests thought they were delicious. Also they did reheat fabulously in the oven.

A good basic appetizer. Needs more salt and a touch of pepper or cayenne. I also tried it in a full sized cupcake pan, and it came out just as good.

Made it for company, everyone liked it. Easy if you use food processor.

This side dish was very good and very appealing alongside my rack of lamb! My guests really liked them and it was worth the work. I just had troble removing them from my "no stick" pan--that was well sprayed with Pam --that took too much time. I am sure that you could spread this on a well greased "no stick with a stilpat pan" and cut it into shapes: stars, squares, circles with a cookie cutter!

I used this recipe for my holiday party. They disappeared quickly! I will definetely make them again. I also made them in batches and they turned out fine.

I'd like to try this, but am resisting because I don't really want so many mini muffin pans! Has anyone tried just placing the mixture on a baking sheet? Would it hold its shape well enough to do this? Help!

Easy and delicious, they make for a perfect little "bite"! They freeze and re-heat quite well.

This a recipe worth having in one's cooking repetoire. My family and guests Loved it ! This a wonderful accompaniment to a standing beef rib roast.

Very good. Used these as a base w/sour cream and caviar. Use more spices.

My husband loved these. A great change from mashed potatoes or (gasp) tater tots (kids have to eat too!). Will definitely use these for entertaining.

Delightful & tasty recipe. Looks like it took a lot of work, but doesn't. Also the mini-muffin size really allows a dieter an easy portion control method.

These are outstanding. I made them last year for a holiday party and they were gone in minutes. I will make them again this year. They freeze very well. Just be sure to crisp in oven them after they are thawed.

Even though the potato bites stuck in my well greased mini muffin tin, they taste good - especially served piping hot with some sour cream on the side (that was essential). I'd make it again because it made an easy party dish, minimal fuss, and my husband really liked it.

I don't know what matzo meal is but the remaining ingredients didn't sound too exciting by themselves so I added grated cheese to the mix and sprinkled some on top, was very tasty.
