I found this to be wy too sweet, even after adding more rhubarb. I used fresh rhubarb from the garden, so perhaps that made difference. It tasted good under all that sugar, and I am going to make it again, just cut down on the sugar.

I thought that this filling would be delicious for a fruit cobbler. I used an 8x8 dish and topped the fruit filling with a basic oatmeal, flour, brown sugar, butter and pecan topping. Baked as directed and the cobbler was excellent! The filling is tangy and very clean tasting. I will definately make this again and I appreciate that is is quicker to prepare and a nice change from the usual apple filling that I prepare.
