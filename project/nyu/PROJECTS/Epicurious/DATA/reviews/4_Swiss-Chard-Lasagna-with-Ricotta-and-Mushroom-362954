I used this recipe to make stuff shells instead of lasagna. It worked really well! I still added about 4 cups of milk to make the sauce. In our case we had some sauce leftover for put on the shells that were a little dry.

WOW! What an amazing recipe&even my kids loved it! Reviewers are correct - definitely double the bechamel sauce as well as the garlic. I loved the stems with the onions - it added more body to the greens. To lighten the recipe, I used fat-free condensed milk as well as fat free small curd cottage cheese. I prefer cottage cheese in lasagna as it is easier to spread. Also, combing the bechemel with ALL of the cheeses saves time and the mixture is easily "spreadable." Spreading the cheeses separately became a tedious and "clumpy" ordeal. My total prep/clean-up time was one hour and 15 minutes. Well worth it!

I made this last night for dinner and all the reviews are correct -- it's an effort and absolutely delicious. I rarely review recipes and felt compelled to share, simply amazing. I also increased the bechamel and added shitake to deepen the flavors. The full fat ricotta and milk are not necessary, 2% and low fat ricotta are plenty rich. To serve, I sprinkled a very small pinch of red pepper flakes on each serving.

Ridiculously tasty. Seriously, so good. Yeah it's a pain in the neck to make. I got the prep down to just under an hour and a half, but I'm a veteran of many white lasagnas and know their wicked ways. Lasagnas just take forever; no getting around it unless you're defrosting a Stouffer's tray. Anyway, I increased the milk in the bechamel to 4 cups without messing with the amounts of butter and flour. This was the right amount and thickened up fine. I also took the last reviewer's advice and sauteed the chard stems with the onions, which made a great texture. Went with no-boil noodles, using a trick I learned awhile ago -- soak the noodles in very hot water for a couple of minutes before assembling, and they won't get crunchy. Result was an EXTREMELY boss lasagna. A+ will make again in seventeen years after I finally get all the pans washed.

This is a truly great lasagna. Like other reviewers, I increased the bechamel sauce by half. I sauteed the chard stems with the onions, and made the first layer onions-and-stems and ricotta, which I had lightened with one egg and 1/4 cup of milk, as well as bechamel. In the second layer, I used the mushrooms (I had some wild mushroms because they were available at the market) and then the chard leaves, followed by the fontina and more bechamel. Top layer was bechamel and all of the parmesan. I find that making each layer different is easier, ensures better evenness across the dish, and more fun to eat. I used no-boil fresh lasagna sheets, which sucked up more liquid than expected. With fresh noodles, I'll make the bechamel a little thinner next time.

Taking into account some of the other reviews, I made a few changes and I have to say, it was really good! I like pumpkin, and figured it would go well with this, so I added pumpkin puree to the béchamel, which I think turned out great. It's a heavy meal, but with warm earthy flavors perfect for a cold day. I made the following changes in case anyone is interested: doubled the béchamel recipe (as suggested by others) but used only 5T butter to 1/2 cup flour, added 4 cups warm milk, and 1.5 cup (1 can) pumpkin puree (add the pumpkin after whisking in all the milk- whisking well and cooking to thicken) then the spices (I skipped the bay leaf, and didn't double suggested spice amounts). I subbed kale for the Swiss chard, and used a mix of porcini and criminal mushrooms (8 oz. of each). I prepared and arranged everything else the same. It's a little time consuming, but not difficult. If you break up the steps (like making the béchamel and preparing veggies in advance) it comes together quickly. Then you just have to pop in the oven. Makes a good meal for a potluck or group.

Excellent and so worth the effort...as long as you start first thing in the morning. Made the sauce first, then the veggies and refrigerated everything until 2 hours prior to serving. I assembled the dish and let it sit out, covered, until it was time to pop in the oven. Rave reviews from guests and husband who normally doesn't like vegetarian lasagna. My changes: made 1.5x amount of sauce; added some already cooked chopped rapini to swiss chard mixture because I felt it needed more greens (next time I will just double the swiss chard); added white wine to mushrooms; will go easy on the fontina next time because I find it gets oily as it melts.

Yummy, Yummy, Yummy - definitely worth the time & effort. Next time I would make ahead when I wasn't so crunched for time. A great dish for entertaining as you can prepare it ahead of time and enjoy spending time with your guests away from the kitchen. Next time I will make two - one to eat & one to freeze for a later date. Great with a deep blended red wine! Perfect meal for all seasons!

I ruined beautiful fresh swiss chard by pouring rich gravey over it and added tons more calories by adding cheese. It was too rich for my family although I doubled the bechamel sauce as recommended. Too time consuming and rich to make again.

Rating: 3
The other reviewers are right: definitely double the amount of bechamel. I did double it and I had just enough for a 9x13 dish. The other reviews also mention increasing the garlic and I did: 9 cloves. I cannot imagine how bland this would have been with only 4 cloves. This does need more vegetables and a great way to incorporate them is to not discard the center ribs and stems of the chard. Instead, chop them up and sautee them with the onions, garlic and chard leaves. It gives the vegetable layers a little extra bulk and flavor. Next time I may use a combination of criminis and shiitakes to give a bit more earthiness. I made this over a period of three days and what a relief. Take the time to make the bechamel a day or two ahead of time. I also prepped the swiss chard the day before as well. Rather than boiling the chard leaves, I lightly steamed them, drained them well and chopped them one day in advance. They will keep refrigerated for one day. Do not overcook the chard leaves! They only need a quick blanching or steaming - a minute or two at best. They will continue to cook a bit more when baking the lasagna. Overall, this was delicious. I would definitely make it again. Making the bechamel a day in advance is better because the bechamel is far more flavorful the next day. It sort of rounds out the flavor profile of the final lasagna.

Rating: 3
Practiced making this earlier for a big party tomorrow. I learned these things: Double the bechamel but use less than twice the butter. Otherwise, it's too fat tasting. Use part skim ricotta and 2% milk. Triple the chard; just microwave it, don't bother to saute, and no reason not to use the less tough part of the stems, separate them and microwave longer than the leaves. It's not simple, but it's fun to make and tastes very good. Make it a day early; it's better the next day.

Wonderful! Can't wait to make it again. Just make sure you have plenty of time!

I made 1.5x the amount of béchamel, added a layer of Italian sausage, and doubled the mushrooms. I used 1 lb Swiss chard and supplemented with some spinach i had on hand. I wish I would have tripled the amount of greens because they shrunk up so much! For a vegetarian lasagna I would have expected a whole lot more veggies! Everyone really liked it, but I prefer a tomato based lasagna. This would be good with a meat sauce and then topped with the béchamel. If I make it again I'll do it that way.

Rating: 4
Oh man, soooo good! I actually cannot have cow milk and cheese, and my husband does not like to go without meat so I actually changed this recipe a bit. I do think that the bechamel sauce made the dish though. (I can have some butter) I used rice milk in place of cows milk in the sauce. Then browned some ground beef added some fake sour cream along with more rice milk to make a sauce in the meat then added the Swiss chard, mushrooms and such. I also added the herbs basil, rosemary, sage, thyme and nutmeg to the meat mixture. Making the meat have a sauce made the bechamel be just the right amount of liquid. Oh I used goat cheese crumbled and sprinkled throughout the layers too. This is now one of my favorite recipes, even my picky boy ate it, well all except the mushrooms.

Took a lot of shortcuts to make life easier: Noodles: 9 no-boil noodles. Bechamel: let milk come to room temp, then add it directly to melted butter-flour. Add bay leaf & keep on whisking until thickened. Allow to cool. Veggies: love the idea of chard & will use it next time, but I had frozen spinach on hand and wanted to use it. Defrost spinach in microwave while sauteing onions & mushrooms together. When onion/mushroom (+ garlic & spices) are done, add barely defrosted spinach & mix together. Layer up and cook as directed. Came out beautifully.

this recipe was delicious! i was cooking for a crowd so i took a few shortcuts. i doubled the vegetables per the other reviews, and used a food processor to get the whole mess prepped. i didn't have lasagna noodles, so i boiled a pound of ziti and tossed the noodles in the bechamel before layering the other ingredients. the other reviewers were right, there isn't enough sauce. i made 4 cups of bechamel and it was just right. the fontina and nutmeg flavor of this dish is fantastic! but, even with the food processor, it still took 1 1/2hrs to get it in the oven. i would imagine using no-boil lasagna noodles would reduce the time further. this recipe is worth the time, we found it's so rich it served twice as many people as a regular lasagna.

I thought it was brilliant. So far I have made it twice, once with a little spinach.

I just wanted to follow up my post to say that I made this lasagna without cooking the noodles first. Make about 1/3 more bechamel, layer the ingredients per the instructions only with uncooked noodles and cook it for the same amount of time indicated. It's fabulous (without the work of pre-cooking the noodles).

Rating: 4
This lasagna is amazing - especially for those averse to tomato sauce (not the case with me, but I still loved this recipe). A couple of things I did to make it out of this world: Add an egg and about 1/4 c. milk to the ricotta as well as a bit of the Fontina (this makes it fluffier) Add a bit of chili power to the bechamel sauce - this balanced the sweetness of the nutmeg and gave it a little kick.

Rating: 3
This was a tasty and unique dish. I made it for my husband and my parents who all liked it a lot and all had second helpings! I liked it but didn't love it. Nutmeg and cloves are not my favorite flavors though. It took me 1 hour of active cooking time (as the recipe said it would)...and lots of dishes! My grocery store didn't have Fontina cheese - so I looked up substitutes and used Edam cheese instead. I had actually just made "Double Dutch Macaroni" which had swiss chard and Edam so I new it would make a good match! By the way...I LOVED the "Double Dutch Macaroni" - I'll make that a second time instead of this:)

Rating: 4
This was very good and I will make again. I doubled the amount of chard and I will agree with other reviews that there needs to be more white sauce but not double the amount. The sauce thickened a lot while I prepared the rest of the lasagna so I had in pour some hot milk on it to thin. That provided me the additional sauce which was needed. My guests loved it as an alternative to a more traditional lasagna with red sauce.

This was DELICIOUS - the only thing I would recommend is doubling the "meat". That way you get more mushrooms and more chard and the cheese is less overwhelming. i'll definitely make this again. I loved it!

I always tell my family the food is better when we eat in, and in this case it definitely was. This recipe is one to make again and again. Although it did take longer than an hour to prepare, it is well worth the effort. I only added a few more cloves of garlic (I almost always do), otherwise, I didn't change anything and it turned out perfect.

I regret following other reviewers' recommendation about increasing the béchamel. The resulting dish seemed like butterfat garnished with a few vegetables and a couple noodles. The bay/nutmeg/clove combination was lovely. But the mushrooms and chard were completely swamped by the heavy, mild milkiness of the béchamel, ricotta, and fontina. I think it would be better if followed precisely as written but I will not try this recipe again. It took me THREE HOURS to chop, cook, and assemble -- and that's not counting the time afterwards to wash multiple sauté pans, saucepans, stockpot....

This is very very good! I was looking for something different than ordinary lasagna, a vegetarian side dish that I could make ahead for company. The first time I made this lasagna, I tested it out on my in-laws and husband's family. It got rave reviews from everyone except my BIL who prefers traditional lasagna. I made my second lasagna today and froze for company in a couple of week and thought after making it twice now would give my thoughts/suggestions. 1) Agree w/ many reviewers. Make more bechamel. I make 1 1/2 times the amount the recipe calls for and that is the perfect amount (for me). 2). I don't necessarily follow the order that the directions lay out, for example, I prepare the lasagna noodles and blanch the swiss chard first (to cut down on bowls, I use the same large stock pot. While the noodles are cooking, I heat the water in my electric tea pot so that when the noodles are done, I can get the swiss chard done rather quickly). 2) While the swiss chard is draining (in a collander), I start my bechamel. 3) When the bechamel is done, I do the onion/swiss chard mix. 4) Again, to cut down on dirty pots (that don't fit in the dishwasher), I remove the swiss chard/onion mixture from the fry pan and put in a bowl. I then cook the mushroom mixture in the same fry pan (don't need to wash). This is time consuming, but if you're organized, and get familiar w/ the recipe, this took me about an hour and a half to prepare (without cooking). I don't think there is too much to improve upon, but I always like to try. Today I added a bit of dry white wine to the mushroom mixture, and cooked off. Will post to let you know how the new crowd likes this lasagna! If you like lasagna and mushrooms and looking for something different it's definitely worth trying. Enjoy.

WEll, I hate to be a nay-sayer but I made this exactly as written and thought it was mediocre. Yes, it was very time consuming but I was willing to put in the effort. I will not make it again. I can't imagine how I could have gone wrong. The chard was tasty, as were the mushrooms. The bechamel came together flawlessly. I HIGHLY suggest trying the Greek style eggplant and lamb lasagna. Takes about the same amount of time to prepare and is WELL WORTH IT!

Rating: 4
Absolutely sublime! I will make again and again. The nutmeg perfectly complimented all of the flavors . . . the fontina was rich and nutty . . . the ricotta added little touches of creaminess throughout the dish. It is a bit labor intensive, however, so I do recommend thoroughly reading the recipe before attempting to get your 'plan of attack' down.

This is clearly not a Rachel Ray recipe. I spread the process out over two days. I think I used just about every pot, bowl and spatula I had. And the dishwasher proved it by needing to have two separate loads run. That being said, it is very good. I felt three noodles were skimpy and used four per layer. We have a garden so I was able to use our own chard - which I feel the dish needed more. Now that I made it as written, I'll play with it next time. Maybe add other veggies (green and/or yellow squash, eggplant) to see how they work. I like it sans meat but I can see how the addition of sausage would be good. It's also not a dish for calorie counters. So folks, line up those pots, bowls and spatulas and have a good time making this!

I had a bunch of beet greens and radish tops to use up, and they worked great in this. Does take a while but is pretty low key, and this is great as leftovers. I will definitely be making this again. I made this in a ~8x10 pan and had just enough bechamel sauce; I would second other reviewers' comments about making 1.5x the bechamel if you're doing this in a 13x9 pan.

This is definitely time intensive. I made (and used) 1 1/2 times bechamel. I used skim milk and low-fat ricotta and those worked great, as a previous reviewer said. At my first bite I decided this needed one more thing - toasted pinenuts. I wish I had mixed some of those in with the chard mixture. I used chard and kale to amp up the greens.

This got rave reviews from my husband, definitely worth the prep time, I had not read any of the reviews prior to making. I also steamed the swiss chard with the onions to save that step of blanching and pressing the water out of the chard. I used the non cooking version of lasagna noodles and added an additional 1/2 cup of milk to the sauce and the noodles came out great. I'm looking forward to the leftovers.

Rating: 4
I read all the reviews and learned a lot; e.g., double the vegetables. I used kale and it was great. It looks bland coming out of the oven, so I dusted it with chopped parsley and added a few tiny tomatoes to each plate. Served with a mixed tossed salad and a crispy French baguette. Dessert was jellied pure orange juice with fresh berries mixed in 1/2 way through setting period. Wine was a Chilean Pinot Noir. A stunning meal!

Rating: 4
This does take time! I'd allow at least 2 - 2 1/2 hours prep work. I followed other reviews and added a lb. of sausage and did not blanch the Swiss Chard, just coarsley chopped and steamed with the onion mixture (2 minutes covered). If you made this without the meat, I'd agree with other reviewers you'd want to increase the amount of Swiss Chard and Mushrooms (by another half of recommended amounts.) Lastly,I really didn't have enough bechamel for the top. Next time I'd measure before layering and thin a bit if need be.

This was ALOT of work, but since I enjoy cooking, I enjoyed the work! It was worth it, this was amazing. I had swiss chard and didn't know what to do with it, so I found this recipe.

What a delishious recipe. As one reviewer suggested I added both sweet and hot Italian sausage to the mushroom mixture.

It's a nice change from regular lasagna.

Agree with the review "people were almost dumbfounded at how delicious it was". WOW almost didn't make this so glad I read reviews and did. Couple of shortcuts, start with an empty dishwasher!!, put the pasta water on to boil, preheat the oven, use an egg slicer to cut up mushrooms, steep the milk in a very small saucepan, make bechamel in medium saucepan leave whisk in no need to chill, roast chard about 5-6 minutes in oven in the lasagna pan drizzled with olive oil then no need to oil pan, use very large skillet for sauteing the onion and scrape onto a plate and use same skillet for the mushrooms. Save some pasta water for thinning the béchamel when reheating. This is so delicious and after years of cooking its nice to be so wowed by a new flavor combination. I upped the chard to about 4 bunches of baby rainbow chard and think it was ¾ of a pound of stemmed leaves.

This is delicious! I made it last night for dinner and served with an Italian Montepulciano d'abruzzo red dry wine and it was so enjoyable. Prep time is definitely 1+ hour but easy work. The blanched kale was great and its hearty leaf held up well in the lasagna - seemed more sturdy than traditional spinach. My only change to this recipe was increasing the portions of vegetables (thanks to prior reviewers' suggestions!) and making a larger lasagna that was 4-layers in a bigger pan so we could have even more leftovers for another night. I will definitely make this again.

Loved this lasagna but it was very rich and could use nearly double the amount of veggies. I made this with dinosaur kale and a mix of crimini mushrooms and chanterelles which gave it a great complexity.. Guests loved it but I would have preferred a bit more greens thane the recipe called for so the richness of the white sauce is evened put by the greens.

This lasagna took a fair amount of time (probably 1 solid hour of prep), but ended up being absolutely delicious. I assembled the lasagna and immediately froze it, saving it for a ski trip 3 days later. It cooked up marvelously and people were begging for more. I will definitely be making this again. I have a big lasagna pan, so I used a total of 12 noodles, and felt like I didn't have quite enough filling. So I will probably multiple everything by 1.5 next time I make it.

Rating: 4
I, too, prepped everything the day before, so assembly was a snap. Amazing results! Definitely worth the effort. I used skim milk, low- fat ricotta, and no-boil lasagna and it turned out great. Also used half chard, half Tuscan kale; added a splash of truffle oil to the mushroom mix. A keeper!

This is truly gourmet and delicious. People were almost dumbfounded at how delicious it was meat eaters and vegetarians alike.However as others have said, it is a lot of work and a lot of pots, like someone else said (thanks for the tip) I made everything the night before and warmed it all up again before assembling the night of the dinner. I followed the recipe exactly, but for one thing: I added a little tomato sauce (Trader Joe's with basil) on top of each layer of noodles. Somehow it felt like it would go and it sure did. Again, absolutely delicious and worth the effort, just be sure you allot enough time.

Loved it! Forgot to get Swiss Chard at the store so used tow bags of spinach I had on hand. Skipped one layer of lasagna in the middle and just had a big layer of vegetables then the mushroom. It allowed me to use less ricotta, less cheese and less bechamel to make it a bit healthier. We loved it! This is probably good w a variety of leafy greens

I've made many, many recipes from BA and Epicurious. Loved this one so much I felt obligated to have it be the first recipe I reviewed. Varied it only by adding a bit more milk to the bechamel (seemed a little too thick) and by adding spicy sausage in with the mushrooms (thanks to previous reviewers!). I will also echo other reviewers and comment that the active time is way, way too low.

This is a great recipe, but the reviewer from Stevens Point has a great idea. Have a partner help in the preparation because it certainly takes longer than an hour if you're on your own. I can only imagine someone at Bon Appetit having all sorts of behind-the-scenes help doing the slicing, stiring, and washing up to keep it under an hour. But the end results were great and I'd make it again. I would also do what I did this time: make everything except boiling the lasagna a day or two before and then assemble on the day needed.

Here's an idea... Have a really great friend who loves to cook as much as you do come over and make this lovely concoction with you. It definitely takes more than 1 hour prepare, but it's well worth it. Rich, creamy sauce and lotsa yummy mushrooms and nutmeg. Ran a bit shy on the bechamel sauce. Meat eaters liked the addition of sausage.

This was some spectacular lasagna! Took a long time to make, dirtied a lot of pots and pans, but ultimately I'd say it was worth it. I found my bechamel needed more salt than called for, and I also used whole grain lasagna noodles. Otherwise, stuck to the recipe and it turned out amazing.

Wowie! Made this last night for a dinner party, and it was a huge hit. I lowered calories & fat by using 1% milk for the bechamel, and part skim ricotta (fresh organic). And it still was utterly delicious. And lighter than traditional meat/tomato sauce lasagnas. The women all agreed that we were full, but didn't have that heavy stuffed feeling that you sometimes get from lasagna. But the prep time was closer to two hours than one. Time consuming, but worth it. Next time I may splurge & try it with whole milk & ricotta!
