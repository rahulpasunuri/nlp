I didn't have enough cranberries, so the taste leaned over to the walnut side, and I'm not crazy about that. It was easy to make, so I think I'll try it again, and make sure I have fresh walnuts and plenty of dried cranberries. The rolls are rather large--sandwich size. I might make them smaller next time, too. I will also add more sugar.

followed recipe to a T. dough rose well and performed well. i think there's too many nuts and berries in this. will try again. would rather they were airy-er.

We made these rolls for Thanksgiving and they were outstanding. As Christmas gifts, I made bread loaves instead of rolls, and gave them to friends. One batch made three medium-sized round loaves...I ultimately made 15 loaves (5 batches), and everyone apparently loved them. This recipe turned out consistently delicious, easy, beautiful breads. It will remain in my rotation for a long time.

These rolls were tasty. I didn't have cranberries so I used some dried cherries that I chopped very roughly. The rolls are a little dense, which isn't surprising since it's so full of heavy ingredients. Still an interesting recipe that's a nice addition when you don't want just plain rolls.

These were really easy and seem impossible to mess up and turned out really good. This was the first time I made rolls and it was worth it. I don't have a stand mixer and I made by hand and it couldn't have been easier. Don't even know why you'd need a mixer for these. Really good sliced and toasted with jelly for breakfast too!

I made these for Thanksgiving last year and they were a HIT. Everyone was singing their praises all night. This year my mom requested them again!!

This is my new go-to roll recipe. They are perfect for breakfast or turkey sandwiches. They came out HUGE. My only alterations were fat-free milk and dark brown sugar because that's what I had on hand. Still delicious.

Probably the best bread recipe I've ever found. Easy, seemingly impossible to mess up, a perfect crunch with the crust and then a soft gooey inside... I've never gotten so many compliments on my cooking as with this recipe! I make it all the time - totally worth getting through the rise time. I like to swap out different things for the cranberries sometimes too - try it with fresh rosemary for example!

I made these rolls for our Christmas Eve dinner and they were a big hit. Very easy recipe to make and the results are delicious. I might try making some a little bigger next time because I think they would be delicious for sandwiches - especially with leftover Thanksgiving turkey!

The restaurant at the Four Seasons Hotel in Boston serves a cranberry nut bread (not quick bread) and I have been searching for the recipe. This is it and it is excellent. Like another reviewer I substituted 1/4 cup of the flour with whole wheat flour for extra flavor and like another reviewer I made it in my bread machine (although I didn't reduce the ingredients the way that reviewer did). It made a huge loaf but my machine can handle up to a 2.5 lbs. For those with smaller machines I would suggest cutting the recipe in half for your first try.

These were great! I was pleasantly surprised at the tender texture and crunchy (from the sugar) top. The only thing I changed was to brush the tops with butter, not egg, because I accidentally forgot the salt and thought that might help. Despite my mistake, these were still delicious. I will be making these again for Thanksgiving and will be adding a bit of orange zest to the dough.

I haven't tried this yet but could is substitute pecans for the walnuts?

easy to make and delicious, especially when warm. i substituted in 1/4c wheat flour (i like wheat bread texture) and added orange zest (because i love the orange-cranberry-walnut flavor) and they came out nicely. 12 large rolls.

Loved this recipe... easy to make and everyone enjoyed it. Easy to make even without a mixer and can easily be doubled. Can also be cut into smaller rolls... just adjust the cooking time slightly

This was easy to make. I don't have a mixer (I don't bake often enough to have one) so I used my food processor. The only change I would make next time is adding the nuts and cranberries later in the mixing because they got chopped up a little too fine for my taste - - or maybe add them during the kneading so they stay whole. I made 24 rolls because they were indeed huge as the others say.

I took a chance on this recipe, and made it in a bread machine. After reviewing the capacity of my machine, I reduced the recipe by one fourth, and the results were spectacular!! This was the best loaf of bread I've ever tasted, much less made myself. The reduced reciped filled my 1 1/2 pound breadmaker to capacity, with a light, airy, fragrant bread that is delicious, whether simply sliced, or toasted and buttered. Try it. You will not regret it!

These were excellent, very popular with everyone. I also made the same recipe and shaped it into a loaf and baked it in a bread pan. I didn't put the sugar glaze on top because I thought it might burn because of the longer cooking time needed for a loaf. I baked it for 35 minutes. It rose nicely and developed a round dome and lobes. It had great texture. It kept for about four-five days before beginning to dry out, but there wasn't much left by that time. Be sure to toast the walnuts as directed. It adds to their flavor. Any dried fruit could be substituted for the cranberries, maybe even add some candied ginger.

Just took these from the oven, couldn't wait-they are beautiful and delish! Only having 12 will be the problem. Followed the directions exactly, used King Arthur unbleached bread flour, great dough. Its a great addition to the bread basket.
