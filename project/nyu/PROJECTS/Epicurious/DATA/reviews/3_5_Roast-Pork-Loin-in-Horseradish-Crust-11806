Followed this recipe to the letter with excellent results. It was perfect: very flavorful with excellent texture on the outside and moist tenderness on the inside. A beautiful, crusty look to the pork, as well. My family raved and made me "save" it to my recipe box. Be sure to drain your horseradish as they state in the recipe. I did, and the crumbs were perfect.

I didn't make the cabbage side dish, but the horseradish crusted pork tenderloin was AMAZING (and quite simple to prepare). I felt like a gourmet chef serving this to my family. The only addition that I made was that I added a little fresh rosemary to the crust. (lots of it in the herb garden right now). So delicious and too easy not to prepare again.

I also used panko crumbs instead of fresh bread crumbs. I loved this it was very tasty. I browned my panko crumbs in butter, olive oil, salt and pepper. I mixed in the horseradish (I used more), I let it cool while I was browning the tender loin. After I coated the tender loin with a pretty good douse of the mustard, I added shaved parmison cheese to my crumb mixture and coated the tender loin... Yummmmmm it was awesome. I served peas, rice pilaf, and rosted granny smith apples with lemon juice sugar and cinnamon. A side of sour cream with more horseradish. Great meal would do it again!!!!!

I've made this recipe many times over the years, and it is my favorite recipe for pork loin. It's easy, flavorful, and everyone loves it!

I cooked this for a dinner party & it was delicious & easy. I used panko instead of homemade breadcrumbs which worked great. Adding more horseradish is good if you like it spicy! Great with rosemary polenta, green salad & Oregon Pinot Noir!

Fabulous and easy recipe. Used store bought bread crumbs that are super fine so they suck to the mustard pretty well. Cooked the cabbage much longer and added a finely chopped apple and bacon to up the flavor.

I just made the pork, and I thought the crust was pretty bland and unimpressive. I even doubled the horseradish, but that just made it taste too much like horseradish! I thought this was pretty bad.

Don't break glass into the mustard. That ruined it for me. Now I can only use it for sandwiches.

Only cooked to 135 to a perfect medium rare;rubbed dry loin with garlic, salt and pepper and let sit to room temp first; would pre-cook bread crumbs only slightly to avoid over-browning during baking. Want to try with beef tenderloin. Very tasty and a definite keeper.

This was a good and easy recipe but i think the homemade crumbs were not worth the trouble because they didnt add to the recipe. I think they may contribute to keeping the moisture in ; this was a very moist pork, but flavorwise...??? I would use store bought coarse crumbs. Very easy either way . Oh and i used a roast not a loin so timing was a little longer but taste was the same .YUMMY

Outstanding. I upped the mustard and added rosemary, tyme and basil. I also used half soft and half browned crumbs and the crust hung right on for dear life. When I roasted, I added sliced onions, potatos and celery to bottom of pan.

I made a lot of changes to this recipe, as part of my ongoing quest to find a crust that stays on roasted meat from cooking to slicing to plate. Success! Here's what I did: First of all used a pork loin roast weighing 5.5 pounds, so doubled the recipe. For the breadcrumbs, I used dense, slightly stale french bread without the crusts and spun in the cuisinart till medium fine, but not dust. I pan-fried one half of the bread crumbs as per the instructions and added to the remaining soft bread crumbs and horseradish (plus a little olive oil for a bit more moisture). (this was due to an earlier theory that soft bread crumbs work better - the 50/50 combo worked splendidly). I more than doubled the mustard and added chopped chives, basil, thyme and pepper to it and liberally spread it on the top of the roast (don't worry - there's isn't a strong mustard flavour after cooking). Then pressed the crumb mixture into the mustard and cooked per instructions. The crust was perfect! Great structural integrity during slicing and plating - taste was good, but would probably up the horseradish next time and play around with some herbs as well.

Just finished licking our plates, and will definitely make this one again. We used a pork tenderloin which reduced the cooking time significantly. We took a reviewer's suggestion and made slits in the meat to insert garlic pieces - highly recommended! We liberally slathered the meat with a wonderfully flavorful French "ail et persil" (garlic and parsley) flavored mustard and had no trouble with the crumbs. We rolled the meat in the crumbs and lined a Corning ware with foil to avoid the mess that others warned about. This was so tender, flavorful, and perfectly matched with the cabbage. A fabulous fall dinner! One tip: make sure you are using HORSERADISH, not "horseradish sauce." We were puzzled at the "bland, flavorless" aspersions cast upon this dish and can only wonder ....

I didn't have any problems with the bread crumbs, but you do need to add much more mustard than the recipe called for. This was great the next day on sandwiches!

we loved it - followed the recipe to the letter but the bread crumbs didn't stick so we just sort of spooned them over for serving. Wonderful and plenty of food for two people.

So, so. Perhaps I used the wrong kind of mustard.

I followed the recipe exactly, using it for an invited dinner guest. We ate every morsel. The only complaint I had was that the crust wouldn't adhere totally to the meat. (especially on the bottom, it stuck to the pan) If there was one way of making it more a crust, instead of just a "topping," presentation would have been nicer, but it was delicious and the cabbage was perfect. (Good balsamic helps.)

try mixing horseradish with all ingredients except bread crumbs...instead of browning loin i just coated it with wet mixture and then rolled in bread crumbs....scrumpdilicious!!!! add just a touch of anchovy paste to mustard and you are set!!!

Followed some of the previous comments - yes, do add more horseradish, slit the meat and put garlic right into it for more flavour - went easy on the salt. The balsamic-braised red cabbage & onions was wonderful! The bread crumbs stick easier to the roast when you're generous with the mustard. Had no problem getting them to stay on.

Made this one a couple years ago and for some reason remembered it and wanted to try again. Followed the advice of others and bumped up the amount of horseradish and used a grainy mustard. I've decided this is a really dumb recipe. The breadcrumbs that you manage to get to stick fall off during cooking, then the rest fall off when cutting the meat. It had a nice flavor, but really was pretty ho-hum. Thought the cabbage was way too vinegary for my taste. Even after adding extra sugar.

I served this for a dinner party, and it was very well received. Quick and easy to make. I did add extra horseradish to make the breadcrumbs stick if nothing else.

I had great results with this recipe. I did pierce the tenderloin and inserted slices of garlic before cooking, which gave the pork a boost a flavor. Make sure you use a good grainy mustard, and go a little heavier on the horseradish. The cabbage was a perfect compliment.

I've made this twice now. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it WAS positively bland. The second time I used 6 tablespoons of horseradish and it was just okay. The best thing about this recipe is the side dish of cabbage. It's very flavorful and the only reason I'll hold on to this. I'll make the cabbage again but I give up on the pork.

I used an extra amount of horseradish and had no problem with blandness. The recipe was easy to follow and most importantly could be made without preparing a shopping list and doing specific shopping. all the ingredients were already in my fridge!

It proved to be extremely delicious with a unique taste among my entire family. The cabbage salad was very appropriate and it accompanied the dish very well. The work in making it was not too extreme, and the results were outstanding, and I have already received requests to make it again --soon!

I have made this dish several times and really enjoy it. It always comes out very tasty, however, I roast the pork at a lower temperature (usually 375). There is a comment about the dish being rather balnd. I always use Polish or Kosher horseradish, which tends to be stronger, and therefore more tasty, than the variety sold by Kraft and Heinz. Also, never use the horseradish sauce that contains mayonaise, as it is very bland. It is not always very clearly marked as such. If you don't have ethnic delicatessens in your area, you can usually find Polish/Kosher horseradish in the deli section of your supermarket near the pickled herrings and pre-packaged nova lox.

Very good and easy to prepare. I used sourdough bread for the bread crumbs, gave it a nice zest. I would make it for company. Maybe next time I will use japanese panko bread crumbs.

the crust was so good i could have skipped the pork..i felt it needed some kind of sauce however but my mind is in a stall and i can't think what to do. There were crust crumbs all over the roasting pan so didn't want to add burned crumbs to anything, but guess you could deglaze with wine and add some broth and cream

My husband and I really liked this dish. I used a 2lb. roast and took it out of the oven at 154deg. but I think it was slightly overdone. I'll aim at 150 next time.
