not a crowd pleaser for sure. the texture was off and it was not sweet at all. the recipe has potential thought. next time i will double the honey and use gelatin instead of agar.

This was very odd. Obviously it is not very sweet. The goat cheese flavor is over powering. If you are looking for a crowd pleaser this is not it. Try it before you serve it to others.
