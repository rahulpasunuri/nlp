I used clementines instead of oranges and powdered ginger instead of fresh but it was wonderful. You do need more time to make the glaze. Even the kids ate it!

This was really delicious. I didn't have any white wine, so I used a mix of white wine vinegar and sherry... pretty good. I'd like to try it with wine. I also accidentally put more sesame oil on the fish... thought I'd reached for the soy sauce when it came out of the oven. I stopped right away, as soon as I noticed, but that little bit tasted amazing. I also used more soy sauce than the recipe recommended, which cut the sweetness and I think got rid of the orange juice and fish taste that some reviewers complained of. All in all, pretty good. Easy because the fish spent some time in the oven and out of the way. I'm still going to tinker with the glaze a bit.

I expected more with this one. I served it to some guests and apologized since it wasn't as impressive as I thought it would be. To me, it was bland, flat and a bit too sweet. The soy sauce and white wine didn't seem like it did too much. I just felt like I was serving orange juice and salmon. I was disappointed and expected more. It wasn't as good as some of the other recipes I usually make. I didn't taste the sherry either. I have to admit, I was a bit embarrassed on this one.

My 6-year old asked if I would make pink fishy-fishy this way every time we have it (he ate it w/o the sauce). That's all it takes for me -- something he'll eat that's good for him. (Still working on my 4-year old.) I liked it too. Next time I'll cook the sauce longer; it was good, but not glaze-y. By the way, I was in a rush and used regular orange juice and ginger from a jar w/ no detrimental results.

Definitely a keeper! I combined a little bit of organge rind, organge and lemon juice with the soy sauce and wine marinate. Put the salmon into the oven and drizzle about 1 tablespoon of hot oil onto the fish when it's done. Also use cilantro on the orange sauce. YUM!

This really is delicious! I've made it several times now, and it is always a hit. I agree with the other reviewers that the sauce needs to simmer for a while before it becomes a glaze (a little longer than the recipe indicates).

Most delicious! Even my 12 year old asked me to make this again!! My only suggestion would be to simmer the orange juice, zest, sherry and ginger for much longer...

This was fantastic! The orange is a perfect balance to the salmon flavor, and the citrus-y sauce kept it very moist!

The sherry really overpowers the orange in the sauce -- I didn't like this dish much at all.

Uhhhh...nope. I won't make this again. The combination of flavors didn't work for me, and all of it obscured the taste of some otherwise fine salmon.

This worked well for serving family on very restricted low salt/fat/carb/calorie diet. "Glaze" is a misnomer, more a sauce - but very good. Tasted better than it smelled. Added sea scallops. Very good reviews. Searing then baking in liquid "holds" well, very moist and flavorful.

Excellent!! Very quick and easy to prepare. A definite make again.

I deleted this one from my recipe box! It was bitter for some reason, the orange rind or ginger? and the soy sauce gave a weird taste to the salmon that didn't go with the sauce. I won't be making it again.

another excellent salmon recipe from this web site. A great weeknight meal. Fast and simple with outstanding results.

Very tasty! The salmon has beautiful color when seared in this way. My sauce never seemed to thicken up enough to be called a glaze, but it was still delicious. I served it with this site's "Mushroom Medley with Spinach, Ginger, and Soy," and brown rice.

This was just plain yummy! The salmon was moist and the sauce flavorful. I was only cooking for my husband and myself, so I only prepared two filets, but did not reduce the sauce ingredients by a third because I was afraid that the salmon would be dry. Turns out I didn't have to worry, but it still left us with plenty of delicious sauce that enhanced the brown rice I was serving with it as well. I substituted port for sherry, as I didn't have sherry on-hand. Probably made for a sweeter sauce, but that was okay by me!

This recipie was yummy, but I reduced the sauce a bit much. I will definitely make it again and this time double the sauce!

ICK! Not sure if it was too much soy sauce or what, but the flavor combo was just not working!

Tasty (and healthy) recipe. I left it in the hands of our nanny (who does not have English as a first language). I suspect she didn't reduce the sauce by much as it was very fluid. Nonetheless the taste was good.

I made this for the first time tonight and brought it over to a relative's house for dinner. It was a huge hit and everyone commented on how flavorful it was. I seasoned the salmon with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper. I added the soy sauce and the wine to the glaze. Other changes included adding bit of brown sugar (to taste) to the sauce, and I didn't quite boil it down to half. I didn't have sherry so I substituted Chinese (Shiao Xing) rice wine. I also added more orange slices and I thickened it with a bit of cornstarch dissolved in water.

I've trying to cook more heart healthy to lower my husband's cholesterol. This recipe fit the bill, salmon which is highly recommended for healthy omega oils and a tasty, low fat sauce! It was a very easy recipe to prepare, I used white wine instead of sherry. It was delicious!
