I thought it was a little bland - so I added cheddar, more chives and cream - still needs something IMO however everyone else loved it. Very easy!

I really liked this. Used an emersion blender rather than moving stuff in between the pot and the blender. Very good basic potato soup recipe - I added 5 crumbled slices of crispy bacon, 3/4 cup of shredded two cheese blend and a dollop or two of sour cream. Wonderful.

I agree with everybody -- the soup is tasty but definitely needs additions. I didn't measure my broth, just using what homemade stock I have. It didn't seem to need much thinning, so I added only a bit of milk. Fresh-cracked tri-color pepper does the trick, as well as extra chives and maple-smoked bacon.

I'm not sure what all the raves are about. This soup is tasteless and watery as written. I would suggest throwing about 10 pieces of bacon into the soup crumbled, adding 2-3 cups of cheddar chesse, reducing the chicken broth by 1/2 cup. At that point you may be able to use milk. But the recipe as listed w milk comes out extrmely watery. Potato soup you want to be creamy. I would suggest using cream instead. Good luck expirimenting.

Perfect soup for a chilly day. Easy and delicious. Recommend to double the recipe.

I enjoyed this soup! Although, I will agree with the other reviewers and say that it DEFINITELY needs the cheese, bacon and sour cream to make it complete!

Served with cheddar cheese, crumbled bacon, and additional chives... I enjoyed this hearty, cold-weather soup. However, alone, the soup was somewhat bland and uninteresting. The texture and flavor are a great start to use as a potato soup base. The recipe is a keeper... however, I thought "add-ins" were a must(especially if you intend to use to soup as a main course meal).

Creamy, earthy; this soup had the ability to simply be drunk! I used about four times as many chives. I don't have a large blender, so I just poured the potato-broth mixture into a large bowl and blended with a hand mixer.

This was good, but a bit bland. On the one hand, this is good, because a subtle flavor to begin a meal leaves you with a clean palate. However, when I make it again, I'll add some more salt and perhaps some crumbled bacon.

This recipe is great comfort food . For extra flavor I puree roasted garlic into the potatoes and garnish with bacon for extra crunch and flavor . Enjoy!

Good and hearty...definitely a main course soup. We served it with crumbled bacon, shredded cheddar, and more chives as garnishes, and it was raved about!

This soup is wonderful. I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I made a double batch and froze small portions for lunches. It is really great.

This was the perfect potato soup, understated but not bland. I think it is important to let the soup stand for a while (or overnite) to let the chive flavor infuse.

Added some sauteed leek, only put in about 3/4 cup milk. Put dollop of sour cream on top to each individual serving - just delicious!

I took this to a cookout this weekend....the weather has just turned chilly, and this soup was a big hit. My husband calls it "the best soup you ever made." It's good even with low fat/sodium canned chicken broth and low fat milk and reduced-fat sour cream.... still very hearty and rich-tasting. The best use yet for my homegrown chives!

This was a great recipe that I used as a starter for a wintery chicken dinner. Everyone loved it... even my father, who doesn't otherwise eat sour cream! And the best part... it was EASY!!
