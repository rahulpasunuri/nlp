I tried this,replacing yogurt with buttermilk and soy milk. I enjoyed it; so did four friends. i created a similar recipe 30 years ago, in Berkeley. It was much better than this recipe. he only differences were: I used watercress, rather than cilantro, used kefir, rather than yogurt & water, no jalepeno. I like my version better--watercress and kefir make all the differenc; omitting jalepeno permits other flavors to meld and project their character.

This didn't do much for us at all. It basically tasted like cucmber and cilantro yogurt. I sprinkled some crumbled cotija on top, which gave it some body. Neither my boyfriend nor myself could bring ourselves to finish it. We do think it might be a good sauce for chicken breasts, but it's not enough on its own.

I've made this soup with avocado as per the recipe and it was good, though it sort of felt like we were eating guacamole soup. On a whim I tried the recipe suggested by a cook from New York - using dill and buttermilk. (I used a lot more lemon and didn't add the ice cubes.) Wow! The soup absolutely hit the spot for a hot summer afternoon. Thanks for the hint.

This is a delightful soup. I took some suggestion of other reviewers and made the following changes: used chicken broth in place of water, added 1 extra Tbsp of lemon juice, and added the cilantro after blending. I also let it sit for a while for the flavors to blend. This is a mild soup (it is, afterall, cucumbers and avocado), the flavors may be a bit subtle for some but, it's quite refereshing.

This was a perfect treat for a hot humid summer night. I followed the recipe exactly, though I would def. add some cubed cukes and avocado for texture. A few days later I used this recipe again, but used dill instead of cilantro, left out the avocado, used 1/2 cup yogurt and subbed buttermilk for the chilled water. Even more delicious, since this version was lighter. I've made both soups several times already this year.

I could not get the comment of "paste" from another reviewer out of my head when eating this. Could be due to letting the yogurt drain too long and omitting the water and ice. Was too thick and chalky. Smells good though.

Reminds of a chilled avocado soup I once had in Mexico, but lighter and more refreshing. Has become a part of my summer repertoire since it first made its appearance.

Yuck. This can be likened to eating green paste. I followed the recipe as written. What a terrible waste of delicious avocados.

This soup was great, I made it for St. Patricks Day, since it was green, and it is really hot in San Francisco right now. I know it's not exactly Irish, but it made for a great mood setter. I did make a few modifications...I used a little bit of fresh parsley and a pinch of dried dill instead of the called for herb. It honestly only makes two servings, so if you have more people you should double the recipe. I think next time I will double it and serve it with a small salad for a full meal. I also added some chopped cucumber and avocado to give it a bit of texture before serving.

Careful with the garlic--we like it that way, but just be warned. Go all the way to the green with the scallions, or add a little more to bring out the flavors. Needed more lemon juice, nice upper. Thought with silken tofu instead of yogurt would be interesting to try one time. We never added the ice and used half as much liquid, since we liked that smoother consistency better. It needed something a little sweet, so we added a dollap of honey. Then a sprinkle and a half of cumin, a sprinkle of cayenne for zowz, and of course we're saltaholics so we were generous with that and the pepper. For me, I liked even more cilantro (add at the end), and I'd leave some bits of the cucumber and avocado separate, mix in at the end so you can have a little chunk.

Good, simple soup. I like the fresh taste of the cukes on a hot day, and thought the avacado might make the soup taste a bit too much like green goddess salad dressing. So I added a bit more cuke to the mix-- perfect! This isn't a strong-tasting dish, so serve it as a light firtst course before the main event... it'll be a hit.

just made this for a quick and easy lunch and will definitely be making it again. So quick, tasty and healthy. I substituted fresh oregano for the coriander, as it was all that I had in hand- and did add a touch of cumin as well for an interesting twist.

Yum! Very refreshing on hot nights. Plus, the combination of yogurt, avocado, and cucumbers makes it delightfully healthy. Lemon juice would have been great if I'd had it, but the soup was fine without. Also subb'd parsley for coriander, which worked out fine.

Great recipe-- refreshing & light. We had melon & procuitto for a first course, followed by this. I used the whole avacado, added a bit more lemon juice, and dried cumin instead of the coriander. yum! Will definitely make it again & again.

Easy and a show stopper -- I served this as a first course at a dinner party, and everyone was impressed. It's improved by upping the amount of lemon, avocado and coriander, and serving with lemon sedges.

Very refreshing especially during this heat wave of '02. I never would have thought to put avocado in a cold cuke soup. It gave the soup a very rich taste. Unbelievably there was some left over and I had it the next day -- even better cause it was colder!

An easy, elegant and delicious cold soup. I make it for friends and relatives as well, and I always get raving comments

With a few modifications this was wonderful. I used the whole avocado and sour cream. Also, I added Tabasco which added a spicy-vinegary kick. Yum. Added lots of cilantro, too.

I liked this -- the ingredients are recipe are simple -- but I thought the soup tasted a bit watery. I might try more avocado than the recipe calls for, less water, or maybe chicken stock instead of water. Thoughts?
