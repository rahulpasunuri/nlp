I really wanted to love this soup - a healthy choice and so easy to make . Unfortunately it tastes pretty much as it reads. It wasn't at all bad, but it wasn't really good either. Considering that I used a homemade chicken broth, extra garlic, fresh from the field broccoli, chives, parsley and lemon juice ffrom the garden, a nice piece of grouper, and a very good olive oil -it was a disappointment.

This was a big hit with me. The broth, water, garlic ratio produces a lovely light fishy broth. I used a mix of cod and sockeye salmon since that's what I had. I only had larger shells and they were bigger than the broccoli florets, so next time I'll use smaller ones specifically to keep the pasta/veg ratio correct. Topping with a favorite herb (parsley, basil or dill) adds another flavor layer as well.

This is a great super fast and easy weeknight dinner. I did add s&p to taste and I ladled the soup over a very generous amount of fresh basil. The lemon really made it.

This was a HUGE hit with my husband and 2 year old. I pretty much followed the recipe exactly except only had sole on hand and no lemon juice. Oh, and I did add a couple of eggs a la egg drop soup. REally hearty, filling, and healthy. This will go into our regular meal rotation!

Made this recipe, but with a few changes. Added fresh ginger, a little fish sauce, fresh cilantro and carrots because I happened to have some around. I like heat in my food, so I diced up half a habenero and added that too. Oh, and I also added some diced onions. Delicious!! Served with some homemade bruschetta. So good and filling. I will definitely make this soup again.

This soup is even better with lots of fresh herbs (preferably dill) and 1 or 2 eggs beaten and added like in an egg-drop soup.

Easy and tasty! It has become a staple for me. Sometimes I add shrimp, a bit more garlic, whatever strikes me. It is versatile and good just as is.

I made this recipe for 2 reasons 1) I happened to have the ingredients on hand and they needed to be used before going bad, and 2) I couldn't believe there was ANY way a soup made with these ingredients could taste good. What a surprise! The soup was easy, quick, and so tasty. Healthy, too! I'll make it again for sure!

This is a goog, quick healthy meal. Like the other reviewers mention, the olive oil is an essential ingredient. I ended up using frozen broccoli and cauliflower mix that I had on hand since I didn't have any fresh. It was a light healthy meal. I would definitely make this one again.

This soup was delicious even though at first I was worried that the broth would be bland and tasteless (like my soups usually turn out) but it was excellent. The lemon really makes a difference.

This soup is really good; I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted wild halibut for flounder/skate based on availability. We used good quality (organic, free-range, etc) chicken broth and a generous tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil for each bowl. The soup needed only minimal seasoning and tasted so satisfying; the proportions (pasta to fish to brocolli) seemed perfect. A perfect quick meal for the two of us, and no leftovers!

Exactly as advertised. A great dish from start to finish and extremely easy to make. The olive oil gives it a wonderful last-minute flavor.

This recipe was perfect, quick and easy, used ingredients I had on hand and I thougt it was very, very tasty. I don't use chicken broth, so instead I sauteed, just for a few minutes, some veggies (carrots, kale, mushrooms-- what I had readily available) and then added the wated and rest of the ingredients exactly as the recipe is written. It is true that the drizzling the olive oil at the end is essential and I also sprinkled a bit of parmesean cheese before serving (I know, an Italian no-no, but yummy nonetheless).

I confess that it sounded weird,and the only reason I made it was that I had all the ingredients on hand and wanted to use them while still fresh. It wasn't bad,nobody left it,or complained about the taste. It required twice the lemon juice,and lots of pepper. The olive oil at the end is essential. I'd make it again only if I found myself with the ingredients again.
