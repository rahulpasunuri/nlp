This was pretty good. The flavor was nice, (love the lemon and mustard seed) but the consistency was not to my liking, too thin, and didn't puree well (I thnk the carrots needed more cooking time). If I make again, I think I will add some potato, cook longer, and reduce broth.

Rating: 4
This is an excellent recipe. I never would have thought of using mustard seed - and love the flavor. Only changes I made were to use olive oil and light sour cream. Addition of some spinach might bring the color back to bright broccoli green, so will try that next time. I'll definitely make this again.

This soup is excellent. I made a few changes based on what I did or didn't have in the house. Celery instead of carrots, no lemon and added 1 cup of cheese instead of sour cream. It is really fresh and excellent. Will definitely make again!

This was a disappointment -- ended up throwing it out. I am surprised, there were so many positive reviews...

This is easy and you can make additions and alterations, as others have suggested. I used some white wine and garlic, a dash of tabasco, and topped the soup with a dollop of sour cream instead of mixing it in. Fast and easier than other similar recipes, I will keep this one! Good broth makes a difference.

I also added the wine and 1 mashed garlic clove. I took the soup off the heat to add the lemon juice and plain greek yogurt instead of the sour cream - the soup was plenty hot at the table without reheating it.

OMG - delicious AND easy! I omitted the mustard seed and lemon because I just didn't have any in the house and added a smidge of garlic. YUM!

This is a frequent go-to recipe for me -- healthful, delicious, and very quick to put together on a weeknight. I generally make it as described in the recipe, though some of the additions and changes in the comments sound very appealing (garlic, white wine). On occasion I have used prepared mustard when I don't have mustard seeds on hand. I like that piquancy. I frequently use reduced fat or fat-free sour cream, with no change to the final product and lightens up the calories and fat. Planning to make this tonight with the accompaniment of cheddar cheese toasts.

Wonderful! Used white wine instead of water, little extra broth, added 2 cloves of garlic.

This soup is perfect for spring - light and flavorful with a great tangy finish from the sour cream and lemon. I made it as directed with two small exceptions that I think improved it just a bit...I added a diced garlic clove and used about 1/2 cup of dry white wine in place of 1/2 cup of the water. (I added the wine before the broth and water and allowed most of it to evaporate, just leaving the flavor). I used homemade chicken stock, which I think is crucial since the stock really stars in this recipe. Using an immersion blender made this a cinch to prepare, too.

Yummmmmmmyyyyyy! This was wonderful soup. I made a few changes as per other reviewers. I added 2 cloves of garlic and a potato. I also added another cup of water because there wasn't enough liquid to cover the broccoli but that might have been because I used a large pot. I also substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream as I was trying to get rid of it. Served with some crusty warm buns and cheddar on top and it was perfect for the first day of snow!

The taste of this recipe was delicious! This coming from a person that is not a big fan of broccoli (I only made the soup because it is a nicer way to get the daily veg intake). The only thing I would change is adding half the water as it would have been better a fraction thicker. Unreal how good this soup is!

Both my boyfriend and I were blown away by this soup. It had beautiful color, a great consistency, and amazing flavor. Yes, it's a little piquant, but that's part of what makes it so uniquely tasty. If you're used to gloppy cream of broccoli soup from concentrate, it may not be a recipe you'll like. But we'll definitely be making this soup again, and often! Minor changes: I used 2% Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, since it's what I had on hand. I also used three cups of chicken broth instead of two cups broth and one cup water.

This soup was too thick and blah for my family's taste. And that was after I added extra liquid, both broth and water. I have a broccoli cheese soup recipe they like a lot better. Of course I am sure it is not as healthy!

Great-tasting, simple weeknight soup. My children love it, too, and we make it regularly. I use lemon scented olive oil, instead of the fresh lemon, but otherwise just as written. Oh, and NOT covered - the broccoli retains much more of it's lovely green color if left uncovered.

I made this recipe almost as written, and found it absolutely delicious. I added a clove a garlic, and since I had some extra homemade chicken stock, I used 3 cups and eliminated the water. Great use for leftover broccoli! I love the taste, but next time I make it I will add a little flour or something to make it a little thicker.

i followed the recipe to the letter...except that i added a hand full of kale for a little added iron and green color. pretty tasty stuff. dunno if it was the kale or if i was a little heavy-handed w/ the cracked pepper (maybe the mustard?), but there's a little kick in the soup that adds a welcome zip. i plan to serve leftovers w/ some diced roast chicken and maybe some pine nuts for crunch.

This soup was great. To make the soup a tiny bit creamier I added 1/4 cup of light cream. For taste I also added a touch of truffle oil and three sprigs of lemon thyme. This one is a keeper.

This is a very tasty, low cal/fat soup. I made a few modifications. I added in a few cloves of garlic to the onions and carrots. I also added in some cauliflower at about a 2 to 1 ratio to the broccoli. Just before adding in the broccoli, cauliflower and liquids, I also added in about 1/4 cup white wine. I let this cook until the wine was evaporated/absorbed into the onions/carrots/garlic. For seasoning, I added in ancho chili power, parsley, basil, and bay leave. I did not like the texture after I pureed with the immersion blender so I put the soup through a food mill. It was still a little too grainy for my preference but I think that could be solved if passed through a fine strainer.

Rating: 3
3.5 forks! I doubled the recipe, and made a few small changes- added garlic (2 cloves), cayenne and some dried thyme. Also I added 2 smallish potatoes with the broccoli. Actually this became a dish I made over 2 nights, immediately after I added the broccoli and potato, I realized I was out of stock and sour cream, so i sauteed the veggies for a couple of minutes, then set aside to cool. The following night I picked up broth and sour cream after work, and the soup was done quickly! It was so thick with the addition of the potatoes that I couldn't really bear to add the sour cream to it. We added it at the table. Easy and delicious!

Rating: 4
Made this for the second time a few nights ago. Mine did not turn out as low-fat as written in the recipe because I had 1-1/2 cups of 2% milk that I wanted to use up (so I subbed all of it for the 1 cup of water). Also, Hubby (bless his heart) brought me a WAY too big potato (11-1/4 oz., after cleaning), so I decreased the frozen chopped broccoli to 2-1/2 cups. Added a good sprinkle of ground cumin and a good squirt of Oriental red hot sauce. Had to thicken it with a bit of flour mixed with a bit of the milk. At the end, just prior to adding the sour cream, I added 2 slices of Sargento deli-sliced medium cheddar cheese. DELICIOUS, but the 2 VERY large main-dish servings were almost too much.

Rating: 3
Lovely and easy (what would I do without my hand blender?). I made this for post-wisdom teeth extraction eating. The fact that I could eat it twice a day for 3 days straight, and still feel like I would eat it again is a testament to how tasty it was.

Rating: 2
Not as enthused as a lot of the other reviewers were - way too thick and did not like the color - turns an unappetizing mustardy color from cooking....Followed previous suggestions - added a bit of garlic, Dijon mustard instead of mustard seed, leeks instead of onions, one potato and a bit more carrot and added a bit of Greek Yogurt a the end instead of the sour cream. Way too thick for our liking, a very thick potage. Only good thing is that it included organic broccoli, carrots, etc. and easy way to eat vegetables. Would not make again.

Rating: 2
Made soup with additions suggested by reviews (sherry, mustard powder, all broth) and chopped the veggies in my food processor, cooked as directed, and then used hand blender to finish. The soup tasted fine but was decidedly grainy. My husband liked the texture but I did not. Perhaps the soup would be softer if the broccoli were steamed before adding to the soup?

Rating: 3
this soup was delicious, after reading some of the previous reviews, I decided to try a few of the variations recommended, I added a few cloves of garlic and whisked in a half cup of pepper jack cheese, finished the dish with a dollop of freshly grated parmesean reggiano. the pepper jack gave this soup i nice spicy kick.

As written, this soup is just OK. However I doctored it up with some of the suggestions from previous reviews and it was VERY tasty. Used 1 leek instead of onion. Used 2 teaspoons mustard instead of mustard seed. Added 1 russet potato, doubled the carrots. Used all broth instead of 1 cup of water. Added extra sour cream and a few ounces of Colby cheddar cheese. Served with shredded cheddar, a dollop of sour cream, and toasted almonds. Very good soup. My 2 year old daughter loved it!

Partially because of what I had on hand, I made these substitutions: used ½ broccoli and ½ cauliflower, substituted 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard for 2 tsp mustard seeds, used all broth instead of using 1 cup water, and used lime juice instead of lemon juice. I thought it was outstanding. I was so sure when I went to taste it that I'd be wanting to add a spice or herb or something, but I loved the flavor as it was. Some reviewers said it needed cheese which would be a divine addition, but I don't think it needs it at all. I never like when a recipe says salt & pepper "to taste"  give me a baseline! The amounts I used seemed perfect with the amount and type of chicken broth I used  ¼ tsp salt & 1/8 tsp black pepper. I definitely consider this a keeper and will make again.

Rating: 3
Good, but too salty, and I used the canned low salt broth, next time I would only use about 200mls of broth and the rest water. I used plain yogourt instead of cream, that was fine. The baby ate it--nice way to sneak in some veggies!

My husband and I absolutely LOVED this recipe! Very easy, and rather healthy. I incorporated a lot of fellow reviewer's suggestions: 1. use garlic, sherry, and olive oil (not butter) when sauteeing the carrots and onions; 2. substitue dry mustard powder for the mustard seeds; 3. Use all chicken broth--no water; 4. add both curry powder and chili powder; 5. use low fat sour cream. The recipe is fabulous, and it reminds me of the phenomal soup at Sam's by the Sea in Okinawa, Japan. Happy eating!

This recipe was Amazing!!! I decided to double everything, except the broccoli to have it last and to share with my neighbour, and good friend for her and her family. I added a couple small potatoes, 1 leek, 3/4 c red and 3/4 c white onions,shredded the carrot instead of sliced, added a few pieces of celery, a few garlic cloves, used extra virgin olive oil instead of butter, 1tbsp oregano and 1tbsp basil for added flavour, and omit the mustard seeds. After puree, I put back into the pot, and added 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese and whisked it in, and then let simmer for about 15 minutes. When I served it, I added a few unsalted crackers. There was none wasted, and I will definately make this again!!!

I agree, this soup is good, not great. But it is a good base for making something more flavorful. On my first try, I followed advice here and added more onion, no water, and shredded cheddar. I still think the soup could use more flavor. Next time around I am adding more broccoli, even more onion,and something else for more flavor - I like the recommendation for leeks.

I made this on a work-night while cooking another meal. You can't beat the ease of this recipe plus the fact that it tasted pretty darn good. I'm hoping the next day will prove to be even better.

I did put in a splash of rice vinegar and a clove of garlic as well.

In my epicurious search, this soup matched my on-hand ingredients best, but I was intimidated by all the criticism. Well, it turned out just fine. My only substitution was more chicken broth instead of the water, and I used half-and-half because I had no sour cream. For those who think it's bland, I think eliminating water and using chicken broth instead would help.

Came to this recipe to look for ideas to "rescue" a similar one I had made and didn't like. Mine had a couple of potatoes as well. Well the little "extras" of this recipe saved my horrible pureed broccoli so-called soup. I added dijon and lemon juice and a hint of nutmeg and darned if it isn't just delicious. I used balkan-style yoghurt in place of the sour cream since that's what I had (and it's pretty similar in texture just not as tart). I will definitely come back to this recipe for my future broccoli endeavours!

This is a very thin cream of broccoli soup, so keep that in mind when making this recipe. It is a nice change if you do not want something heavy. It had a lot of flavor, but looks a little unappetizing. Definitely use the lemon juice. I used fat free plain yogurt instead of sour cream. I also loved the mustard seeds! Don't think it is going to be more than it is!

I carefully read all the other reviews and made the following changes: added a celery stalk, nutmeg, salt & pepper, and a massive clove of garlic to the onions + carrots sauteed in a small amount of light butter, added a small potato and simmered it along with the rest of the vegetables, used vegetable stock and then after pureeing everything, added enough skim milk to thin back to a nice consistency. Then I added about 4 tblspoons of low-fat sour cream for flavor. Really delicious. I was out of worcestershire, but it would be perfect addition!

3 1/2 forks, very good. I made a few changes: I sweated the veggies in 1 tbsp butter and used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream (great flavor, half the fat) in order to cut down on fat.

I loved this soup! So healthy and with such a delicious, light taste. The only variation I make to this recipe is to add just a bit of cayenne pepper. It kicks up the taste without making it too spicy. It freezes really well, too. I've made this at least six times by now, and it's always wonderful. Recently I tried this recipe to make a cream of spinach soup--the only change I made was to add nutmeg. The texture was gorgeous & velvety, but the taste didn't somehow impress me as much as the broccoli. Worth a try, though.

Rating: 3
If you like a pungent soup, you will like this. Mine may have turned out more sour than was intended because I increased the sour cream a bit (had some low-fat that I wanted to use up). Used frozen chopped broccoli (instead of fresh), substituted 2% milk for the water, added some bottled Maggi Hot Chile sauce and a dash of ground cumin. It did not need any additional salt. Did not puree anything or add any cheddar cheese (original recipe did not call for the cheddar). Thickened it with a mixture of flour and water. Overall, it was VERY GOOD, but not a 4 forker. (I think that a small chopped potato would be good in this soup.)

Rating: 4
This soup is very European in style. I prepared the receipe as described After pureeing the vegetables (that I prepared in vegetable broth instead of chicken and water) I added a little chopped garlic ( not sauteed) and few drops of Hot Sauce for a kick. I continued to simmer for 10-15 minutes (until ready to serve) and then added a small amount of 1/2 and 1/2 and about a tb. of butter to refine the soup. Serve in beautiful bowl and added fresh basil and shreaded cheese as a garnish in the center. Served with cheese toast and a glass of wine over a candle lit table on a cold night.

Yes, overall this recipe was easy and very tasty. However, I also give it only 3 stars due to not having the cheddar cheese in the recipe. I added about a cup or so of a lowfat cheddar which made it very yummy! Perfect for a cold day...

I doubled the recipe and followed many recommendations below: I sauteed the onions and carrots together until soft, added 3 minced cloves of garlic, sauteed until fragrant, substituted and equal amount of dijon mustard for the mustard seeds and added that to the sautee with about 1/2 cup of dry sherry. Cooked that mixture down, added the broth, half and half (instead of water) & broccoli. After pureeing, I added a little grated fresh nutmeg, a pinch of cayenne (not too much, I have a toddler) and, after adding the sour cream it was so, so good that I was afraid to add the grated cheddar so many had suggested. So I served it on the side - it was excellent both with and without it so no need to run out and buy cheddar if you don't have it around. Delicious!!

Pretty good soup! However, if you really want to make an improvement, try substituting the cup of water for a cup of half-and-half. Then add 1/2 tsp. of Truffle flavored Extra Virgin Olive Oil. It adds a wonderful full flavor to give the soup just a little more zip! My wife loved it so much she had me make it for lunch, again for dinner the same night, and then had another bowl before bedtime! (yes, she is still very thin!)

I can't tolerate cow's milk and so I substituted the sour cream and water with a little more than 1 cup goat milk. I also used veggie broth instead of chicken. I used the suggestion to add red pepper. Wonderful! The second time around I was out of goat milk, so I substituted a cup of soy milk for the water/sour cream and threw in a few chuncks of goat cheese for tart as I was also out of lemon. The tart of the chevre was a nice substitution. I also did not have carrots, and threw in two small peeled and diced red potatos...it had a lovely texture and nice tang from the cheese. Great recipe!

With the ability to buy pre-cut broccoli florets in the grocery store this recipe is very easy. If you are trying to avoid meat, substitute the chicken for vegtable broth. I skipped the carrots, added dijon musturd after the puree, then added the sour cream. A coiple of twists of white pepper and this was a perfect quick meal on a weekday. This soup was far from blah for me.

This is a delicious soup, but others were correct in saying that it needed a flavor boost. I doubled the recipe, subtituted olive oil for half of the butter, skipped the sour cream and added a little chili powder to the soup, which was perfect for our tastes. From another soup recipe (Jan/'03) I borrowed the idea of adding a dollop of plain yogurt and fresh cilantro leaves to the bowls of soup. I will definitely make it again with these additions.

I thought this recipe was wonderful. I actually loved the lemon juice addition, and squeezed in about double the amount called for.

Well excuse me, but I followed the directions exactly and it was perfect. Have learned to trust Gourmet after thirty-five years. Only suggestion I have is never to cook broccoli in a covered pot, it gives it a rancid flavor, otherwise, this is a great receipe just the way it is written. Cream soup without the cream. Great!

I've made this soup several times and gave it out to lots of people who've sampled it. It's a well-balanced soup. I substituted canola oil for butter but otherwise kept the recipe intact. The sour cream addition is small enough to make little difference in the individual servings and, let's face it, fat carries flavor!

I should have listened to the first review. I did not like this soup. Sadly, I doubled the recipe because so many other's raved about it. I threw the whole thing out, yep, right down the sink!

I thought this was quite delicious. I wanted to make it a little less fattening, so I used a little more than half the butter and put in low-fat sour cream at the end (and used less of it). For flavor purposes I used all chicken broth (my own not-too concentrated broth). I will definitely make this again. A winner!

I eliminated the mustard seeds and used dry a bit of dijon mustard and it was great. For those not interested in the sour cream, years ago Bon Appetit gave out as a supplement I believe to their magazine subscription a book called "light soups" To keep the fat down and the flavor okay, instead of the sour cream, try a 1/2 cup of low fat MILK blended with 1/2 cup of either ricotta or cottage cheese and then add to a slightly cooled soup. I have used curry power and it does add a special taste to the soup. Add a minced garlic clove or substitute vegetable broth for the chicken broth or a combination of both. Shredded sharp cheddar passed at the table does work nicely.

I made this as written and it was good, but next time I will take into account all the various suggestions. The lemon did give it a nice zing but it was close to being too acidic.

Did add the cheese as garnish which was good, but i'm unsure about curry & cheese together.

This soup was good, next time I would go easy on the sour cream and fresh lemon juice...it was almost a little to acidic and sour at the end. I added some extra sharp cheddar which was a great flavor enhancer and because it was so sharp you only needed about 1/2 a cup- the stronger the cheese the less you use so the less calories!

This is an excellent soup as the previous reviewer said. I made a couple of changes, also. I used a 1/2 t. of dry mustard instead of the seeds. I also used two (10 oz.) boxes of frozen broccoli spears instead of fresh since I didn't have it on hand. I cooked the broccoli in the microwave until it was just about done and put it into the soup. I also added a peeled and diced potato before I boiled and simmered the mixture. Came out great and a good recipe to serve to company!

This soup is excellent. Great success. I used fennel seeds instead of mustard, which I didn't have, and heavy cream instead of sour. Light and easy.

We loved this soup. I used leftover broccoli stems from another dish and subbed almost a half tsp of mustard powder. Used a hand blender and garnished with cooked carrot slices and broccoli florets.

Here is one I made up that makes my mouth water every time I think about it: I Fill a standard dutch oven 1/2 with water add together 1 minced onion, 2 bags frozen chopped brocolli (or you can use 1/2 brocolli and 1/2 cubed potatoes), 2 cups cubed ham, Boil brocolli/onion(potato) mixture until brocolli or if using potatoes are almost done about 5 to 8 min. while boiling: Make a flour gravy mixture with cold water well mixed (a blender works well), reduce heat to low boil stir in flour water mixture with a steady stir to keep from lumping (thicken to your desire) I usually make it very thick almost 1 cup of flour for mine. Add 1/2 bar (or more if you like) creme cheese and stir it in until well melted add 2 tbsp of butter, add ham and season with garlic salt and pepper to your taste... MMMMMM! It's a Great tasting full meal takes about 1/2 hour and has easy ingredients. You will be surprised..

Before attempting this recipe I carefully read all the reviews and I implemented many of the suggestions offered. I then added fresh cilantro leaves when blending the soup. Broccoli and cilantro are wonderful companions.The soup was delicious. Instead of adding salt I used liquid soy all-purpose seasoning which added to the flavour of this soup.

This is a quick and easy soup which lends itself to adding a few extra veggies. The carrots give the soup nice color. My only addition was about 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes. This recipie is a keeper.

Very good, simple soup. A perfect consistancy - a thick, rustic potage. I added a fat clove of garlic, and had creme fraiche and curry powder on the table for stirring in individually (I loved the curry, my boyfriend is of the non-curry powder camp - hence, the at-the-table decision). Also, since I used frozen chicken stock, it needed quite a bit of salt.

Yum! Easy, quick and good. Make sure to add enough salt and freshly ground pepper.

i really, really liked this recipe. indeed so very easy to make and decidedly exquisite in its flavor. i had to omit the lemon because my husband doesn't like in his veggies or soups. so i added some leftover parmesan cheese and jack--my we all loved it, even my little boys!!!

This is the best cream of broccoli soup I've tasted! Very easy to make. I used a bit more broccoli as we are broccoli-lovers. I added potatoes and also blended it with the mixture. Used half & half instead of sour cream. Will definitely make again.

I added curry powder to the onions and carrots and a potato as suggested by another reviewer. I thought that gave it good texture and good bite. I will make again, varrying the amount of broccoli, potato and carrot that I use.

Added 1 garlic clove as suggested and a dash of nutmeg. Use mustard seeds if available. Also added 2 peeled, diced potatoes with the broccoli, for thickener. Would not ommit lemon juice as it gives soup a zing...would have been too bland without lemon and garlic. Also garnished 1 batch with curry powder...excellent! The only drawback to this recipe as that no matter how long you cooked the broccoli and puree, it never seemed to get really smooth...would need to strain if texture is an issue.

I love this recipe and have been making it since it was first published in Gourmet in 1993. I took the author's advice and added some curry to the recipe (she suggested it in a sideline). Spectacular! Also: I used nonfat or lowfat sour cream (I can see the frowns out there... but really it is very good this way as well!) Try it. So simple! I may try a bit of sherry in the sauteeing veggies next time.

My husband and I had a similar broccoli soup during a trip to the British Virgin Islands and we loved it. Hoping to recreate the soup, I tried this recipe and it is wonderful!! I've made this recipe (exactly as written) several times and it just gets better each time! I also made it this past winter after a serious snow-shoveling for my family and neighbors and it was a great hit! It's also very easy to make so give it a try!

I made some changes. I did use the carrot, but I also used garlic and chopped fresh parsley. I used a good french mustard instead of the seeds. I added vermouth during the sauteeing process. I used heavy cream and a little milk in place of the sour cream and I added shredded Gruyère and parmesean. A dash of worcestershire sauce gave it a little zip. At the end, I thickened with flour and served with more shredded cheese and parsley on top. I also reserved some of the large pieces of cooked broccoli and added those back at serving time.

To simplify, I also just added dijon mustard instead of seeds, and left out the carrot. I added cream instead of sour cream. I like creamy soups, and this was not too thick. Thick soups, the kind that you can stand your spoon in, look gross after a while, but this soup was creamy in a light, tasty way.

Wonderful. My husband and two year old loved this. We stirred dijon into the onions instead of using mustard seeds and added a little flour to this as well. Also reserved some broccoli flowers for the soup and served with grated cheddar on top. Just soooo good.

Fantastic. Rarely does my husband want seconds but he did when I made this. I made a few changes. I substituted one-third of the broccoli for cauliflower. I added 2 cloves of garlic. And, I used heavy cream (close to a half cup) rather than sour cream. Using fresh chicken stock I had on hand was likely a plus.

Wonderful soup, but I did make a few changes. I used dry mustard instead of the seeds, added a couple of tablespoons of flour to the cooking vegies in order to thicken the soup,left out the sour cream and used one can of evaporated skim milk to give it a creamy texture. I also added about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese. The kids loved it!

This was my first time making cream of broccoli soup, and I was a bit disappointed. I used cream instead of sour cream and the mustard seeds I used weren't very fresh, but I found the mustard taste overpowering and bitter (could this be because they were not fresh?). I was looking for a sweeter creamier recipe- any suggestions?

Loved this recipie, but instead of adding mustard seeds, I ground the mustard seeds and added it as mustard powder. I would use more than the recommended amount to give it a stronger flavour. I also left out the carrot to simplify the recipie.

This soup waas very good, but I agree that next time I will leave some larger peices of broccoli.

Loved it. Added 2 cloves of garlic plus one leek and also mixed 1 teaspoon lemon with 1 teaspoon dijon mustard and that made it special.

I have made this recipe a number of times. I found the mustard gave it a bit of unique taste. As for the lemon, start off with a small amount, then add to suit your taste. Will make again

This recipe was not very good. The lemon was overpowering and the sour cream and mustard seeds made the soup bitter.

This recipe was great, the only suggestion I would make would be to leave larger pieces of broccoli in the soup (I plan on doing this next time I make it). Also, be careful with the lemon - if you add even a little too much the taste can be a bit overpowering. My entire family loved this, even my 2 yr old!

This was so easy to make, and I was surprised by the how creamy this soup was with only some sour cream in it. It's very good with some cheddar cheese on top.

I made this soup two evenings in a row. Both times I substituted celery for carrot and the first time I used bottled Dijon mustard instead of powdered mustard. I liked it better the first time--the mustard flavor was more intense. Either way, my family and I really enjoyed the soup. The lemon, although subtle, definitely makes it more interesting.

Excellent base recipe! I made this using broccoli leftovers. I used the broccoli tops for another recipe and decided to try making a soup using the pealed stalks. I didn't have enough broccoli so I added celery - added a nice depth of flavor. Also, didn't have mustard seeds, used dried mustard - worked fine. Loved the addition of lemon! I topped the soup with toasted break crumbs--good texture. Quick and easy lunch or light supper. This is a keeper.

Wonderful soup, my roommates went out to eat and then had this too when they came home!!! The lemon juice is a must. I didn't have mustard, but used three cloves of garlic, threw in two cubed potatoes with the carrots (thickened things up) and used the last of some half and half and whipping cream at the end. A great recipe for cleaning out the fridge, and tastes so good that I will definitely make sure to overstock on veggies again!

This was a very easy and satisfying soup. I added some shredded cheddar into the soup at the end, which was very yummy. I'd definitely make this again.

This was SO easy and quick, I used a bag of frozen broccoli parts and cleaned out the fridge... Adding potatoes, celery and scallions. The potatoes helped to thicken the soup. Topped with shredded cheddar and the green tops of the scallions, it looked and tasted great!

This is a very tastefull soup. It could be a little creamier. I used a handheld blender and it worked just fine. I will definately make it again, but i would have to be in the mood for it.

This is a good basic recipe, but it needs some additions to make it more flavorful and creamy. I made the following substitutions/additions: 1/4 tsp dry mustard instead of mustard seeds, also added 1 tsp granulated chicken bouillon, a dash of garlic salt, onion powder, and Worchestershire sauce prior to blending. At the end when you wisk in the sour cream I also added 6 oz. cubed velveta cheese.

To save even more time and lock in nutrients, I put all ingredients in a pressure cooker for 5 min. or so, then into the blender and season to taste!

Perhaps it was the type of broccoli but as I chopped, cooked and pureed the vegetable a rather pungent odor was released. This can best be described as next day broccoli smell--the kind of whiff you get from emptying the garbage. With such a strong association, the soup didn't come across as very appetizing at all. However the taste was not bad. The texture was a little crunchy. When I try this again, I will either cook the broccoli longer or leave out more of the stem.

I made this soup again days later! Yum! I used mustard powder instead and added a couple cloves of garlic with the onions. Also, another option is to add softened cream cheese while blending. Second batch I also added sharp and mild cheddar cheese. Love this recipe as is, and I've also enjoyed trying a couple variations.

It's very fast and easy to make. A tip though, it comes out much creamier in a blender than in a food processor, at least in my case. The lemon juice is a personal thing, but I liked lots. Recommended for a novice soup maker.

Great recipe; very helpful reviewer comments. Changes I made to minimize fat: replaced sour cream with nonfat yogurt, & sauteed the vegies in hot pan with a little chicken broth instead of butter. No sacrifice to flavor or texture. I also added a tsp. of chopped garlic with the onions, I substituted 1/8 tsp dry mustard for the seed, and reduced lemon juice to 1 tsp.

This is a wonderful soup. I usually go a little lighter on the lemon juice than the recipe calls for, and I've found that substituting 1/8 - 1/4 teaspoon of dry mustard powder for the mustard seeds works well, though the mustard seed version is good too.

I loved this recipe! but I have a habit of altering recipies so I used mustard powder and to thicken it I used half & half and a couple of tablespoons of cornstarch and a few chicken boulion cubes. My kids and my husband loved it! Oh, and I also added some thinly sliced mini carrots for color. Thanks. Colonia, NJ

MY KIDS EAT IT! I can't believe it, but my picky picky picky 9 year old and the toddler LOVE this soup. I usually add a couple of potatoes for fun and I never seem to have mustard seeds, only powder. Also, I whisk in a bit of milk to make it extra creamy at the finish. Oh, my husband likes it, too. ;)

This is a very tasty, nutritious soup. Because the lemon juice affects the taste so much, I cut lemon slices for guests to add juice to their individual bowls of soup. This worked out very nicely.

We enjoyed the soup. I saved out some whole broccoli to add to the soup after it was pureed to give it texture.

This recipe was easy to make and it's so healthy. I didn't put as much lemon juice as suggested. Instead, a dash of ground cumin seeds were added to expand the flavors. I have found that adding Crimini mushrooms to this receipe thickens the soup without having to add as much sour cream.

It's a very good soup although it is not what one usually considers a "cream" of broccoli soup - it's simply not that creamy. It is, however, quite healthy and tasty!
