This recipe takes a long time, and it also tastes quite bland. Maybe tomorrow it'll taste better. It's just a basic curry recipe, nothing extraordinary.

With one exception of using curry leaves instead of kaffir lime leaves, I followed the recipe up until the "do ahead" part. That created a wonderful curry sauce to really do anything you like with. Then I used cauliflower, carrots, peas, tomatoes and spinach. Sprinkled cilantro on top. Great recipe, I'd encourage anyone to make this and either follow the recipe, or just make the curry sauce and improvise with the vegetables.

Cooked this on a Scout camp. The kids loved it there was nothing left even though it was vegetarian!

I agree with magpie77... better after it simmered for close to 1 hour. I changed it a little by adding about 2 tbsp of sweetened flaked coconut (all I had on hand) and 1 can of chick peas (protein) as suggested by someone else... Tasty and easy... Definitely a keeper!

Just posted a review, but forgot a couple of other changes I made and wanted to add: Didn't use any white potato at all, added a whole red bell pepper instead. Next time I may add some paneer cheese and/or green beans. This basic curry recipe would be suitable for just about any combination of vegetables.

Made this recipe with a few changes and it was AWESOME! Used a red onion, substituted 1.5 cups coconut milk for the vegetable broth (actually used chicken broth), also used a can of whole tomatoes including the liquid. This recipe really needs to simmer for closer to an hour to bring the flavors out and it tastes even better the next day. After 25 minutes, the curry was actually quite bland and the sweet potatoes had very little flavor, but after an hour or so all of the flavors really came together and the spices began to soak into the sweet potatoes creating a really nice diversity of spicy and sweet.

Making this dish in accompaniment with the Cilantro Coconut Rice. Here's what I changed: Didn't have the sweet potatoes, tomato paste, hate carrots and no spinach (or similar leaves). I added 1/2 yellow bell pepper, green bell pepper, to blender with onions until chunky like salsa. Added another clove of garlic. Substituted Catsup for the tomato paste in a pinch, diced 3 1/2 red skinned potatoes, yellow and green summer squashes. I also used mock 2 C. Mock Chicken Broth, 1 C. Coconut milk. I also added about 1/8 tsp of this Garlic-Siracha-like sauce. Used sweetened coconut (all I had on hand). The result? Sweet, a little spicy and delicious. =]

My husband & I absolutely loved this - SO full of flavor! We made it pretty much as written - found it by searching for a recipe that used both sweet potatoes & spinach, which we had just bought at the farmers' market. DELISH!

This turned out fabulous. My roommate and I couldn't stop wanting seconds, and thirds...however, it's very filling! I used what I had in the house, which was most of the ingredients. The only differences were using lime juice, coconut milk (half a can) and 2 Tbsp of dried coconut flakes, a can of chopped tomatoes instead of tomato paste or fresh tomatoes. I used frozen chopped spinach too. Chicken broth instead of veg broth. I also used jaggery instead of normal brown sugar, since I happened to have it, and figured that was more authentic. This recipe is delicious!!

I don't like this dish it's kind of strange & unpleasant tasting. I am normally a great LOVER of Indian & Asian food. I used my food processor to grate the coconut as recommended & the texture of it remained too hard & too chunky even after cooking. I didn't like that hard texture of the coconut in the stew. I've made much better Indian food using Indian recipe books that I own. I still have a lot of leftovers {ugg..} because I had doubled the recipe. I made this recipe exactly as written with two VERY MINOR substitutions: I used 'chicken' broth instead of veg. broth, & I used 'beet greens' substituted for spinach.

This was really good! I followed the recipe as written, with the exceptions of using dried flaked coconut (unsweetened) in place of fresh, and accidentally omitting the spinach. It was hearty and flavorful, and not at all difficult to make.

Yum.I always thought that making my own curry paste would be difficult, but this wasn't. Totally delicious. I used coconut milk instead of a coconut and lime juice/zest instead of the kaffir lime.

My boyfriend made this recipe, and it turned out delicious. He left out the garam masala and substituted the lime leaves with the lime zest. He also used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. Aside from a rather unique experience opening the coconut (which we should have videotaped), he said the recipe was very easy to follow.

Super yummy! Followed the recipe, except for adding a package of frozen spinach (instead of fresh) and 2 cans of chickpeas for protein. I used the zest and juice of 2 limes. Served it with cilantro coconut rice, and it was outstanding. My 3-year-old and 13-month old loved it!

maybe it would have been edible if instead of garam masala curry powder (or curry spices )was listed...as is, tooooooooo bitter

This is very, very easy, especially if you have many of these ingredients on hand, as I do, and VERY delicious! I made this without potatoes, tomatoes and lime leaves and poured it over plain brown rice to rave reviews! Next time I will definitely add spinach and/or peas and much more heat, and serve it over coconut rice or a fragrant sweet rice, with a yogurt raita on the side. This dish would simply sing with a lovely sorbet finish, so consider making a nice mango or other fruit dessert.

This was surprisingly easy to make and very tasty. If you don't have cardamom pods, you can safely leave them out and still have a yummy meal, but I have no doubt it would be better with them. Used microgreens (because I had them) instead of spinach.

The ingredients list may look daunting, but this recipe is actually very easy to make. The smells the will come from your kitchen are delightful; it really is a delicious curry. The 'fragrant feast' menu has side dishes that complement this main beautifully, and I'd especially recommend the rice. Four forks!

Having a lot of potatoes from my organic basket, this recipe was ideal to accomodate them. Made as written, the spice mix was fantastic and my friends loved it. As suggested in another comment, I served this with the Coconut Cilantro rice from Epicurious and it was a delicious combo. Very pleased to have leftovers to reheat tonight!

This is really delicious and not as labor-intensive as some other reviewers have suggested. I used a can (13.5 ounces) of coconut milk instead of the coconut, and that was a great addition. Used cauliflower, peas, yams, and carrots for the veggies and the whole thing was delicious!! Brought it to a dinner party with an Indian theme and it was a big hit!

AMAZING. we added one can of chick peas (for protein), 2 tsp of red curry powder instead of cardamom seeds and one tablespoon of crushed red pepper for heat. there is enough sauce to keep it juicy and enough veggies to make it hearty. the perfect balance of sweet and spicy!

This is terrific. It is labor intensive, but I divided things into smaller tasks - made the vegetable paste the night before, made the broth the the next AM, and added the chopped veggies later in the day. I omitted the tomato and the spinach, added a cubed butternut squash - but the sauce is what makes this, regardless of the vegetables used. I could see using peas, cauliflower, etc. I did not look for kaffir lime leaves and used the recipe's substitute suggestion of lime peel and lime juice. Wonderful and healthy comfort food.

This got rave reviews at my event--the first time I ever made it. I added CASHEWS for protein. They made the dish! It is very simple, and can be made simpler by using dried coconut (not sweetened). I just didn't have access to fresh. Even better a few days later when the flavors blended.

ho. ma. gah. This dish tastes GOOD. Great combination of flavors, will most definitely make again!

This is a great, easy, and healthy recipe. I made a few changes to it, replacing the garam masala with some extra cumin, as well as exchanging the kaffir lime leaves for half a lime cut into quarters. I also exchanged the coconut for creamed coconut and omitted the tomatoes... so, practically a different recipe in fact (!), but it still came out really tastily!

Overall, I liked this curry and might make it again but it came out slightly too sweet for my taste. I changed a bunch of things--cauliflower instead of potatoes, added chicken b/c I had extra, used Thai curry paste instead of garam masala. I also used an immersion blender to smooth it out a bit. Very good but needs some more tweaking next time around.

I thought this was a really well balanced spice blend for the sauce, and will definitely use it as a springboard for future curries. Two things I did differently: I added my tomatoes before the other vegetables and then used an immersion blender to puree everything into a silky sauce. Then I added the rest of my vegetables (sweet potatoes and a mix of other root veg from my CSA) and proceeded as written. Very tasty!

I used large flake desiccated coconut, twice the amount of garam masala and omitted the kaffir lime leaves (loathe that smell and taste!). It was tasty, but I don't think I would make it again - just not "wow" enough.

Made as written, except I used store-bought coconut rather than fresh and coconut oil (good at high heat) rather than sunflower oil. This was a lot of work, but turned out to be an excellent vegan meal. I froze some of the leftovers and hope they will be good defrosted. I suggest doing this recipe over two days by making the sauce one day in advance.

Made it as written except, I substituted cauliflower for the russet potatoes and did not add coconut to the curry. Instead, I served it over Cilantro Coconut Rice (also on Epicurious) and got the coconut flavor from the rice. A delicious combination! Both of us liked it alot.

I thought this was delicious! The coconut was key, as were the garam masala and tomato paste. I added extra veggie broth to make it more saucy. I would have added chick peas if I had them for some extra protein. I'm recommending this to all my friends!

This was pretty good. I thought it needed a lot of salt to bring out the flavor of the spices. Also I think I could have pureed the spice paste longer b/c I had pretty large chunks of ginger that weren't too pleasant. I didn't really taste the fresh coconut either.

Was really fragrant but I too was imagining it to be more spicy or more acidic. Still a great curry. I made it with the coriander and cilantro flatbread and indian raitia and it was a good combo.

Very easy to make but a little short on the vegetables. I added some leftover cauliflower and chick peas. It was delicious!

I substituted fresh coconut with coconut milk, and tomato paste with canned tomato sauce. I also added more vegetables (green pepper, swiss chard), and seasoned it with a little bit of chili powder (was not very spicy). As sides, I served basmati rice, cucumber salad and raita. My family (4) loved it, and it is a great vegetarian meal. With the modifications above, this made at least 8 servings.
