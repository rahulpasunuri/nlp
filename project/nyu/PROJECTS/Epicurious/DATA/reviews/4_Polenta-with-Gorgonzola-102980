Love this recipe. I use 1% milk and skip the cream. The gorgonzola is rich and salty in itself. I serve this with veal shanks, veal stew, beef shanks. It would be great with any type of braised meat.

This was very, very good. I took a reviewer's suggestion and made it ahead, put it in the fridge, then warmed it on a low microwave setting before putting under the broiler. Used mostly 2% milk, and it came out in neat slices. Not firm enough to pick up though.

Fabulous...one of the best parts of my totally do-ahead entertaining menu off Epicurious. Antipasto Stuffed Baguettes for the appetizer, Osso Bucco with Tomatoes, Olives and Gremolata, Polenta with Gorgonzola, a salad - tricolore works well and then the dessert that always wows - Raspberry Semifreddo Torte. Make the polenta the day before, put it in a pie dish and then warm it the next day while reheating the Osso Bucco. Top it with the cheese once it's warm turn on the broiler and melt the cheese. Voila! Always a hit with guests and you've done ALL the work days before!

Wow Wow Wow is this so amazing. The flavor is out of the world and it got such rave reviews. I ended up using 2% milk and the whipping cream and it was perfect. The only thing I would have done differently is put it in a more shallow baking dish as the dish I used was too deep so you didn't get enough topping with each bite. The topping makes the dish.

Whoo-wee! Verrrry rich! This needs to be balanced on the plate with a nice crisp salad, fresh tomatoes or something that will help cut the creamy richness. That being said, it is delicious - and the walnuts are key. We had it as part of a vegetarian meal along with stuffed zucchini, cherry tomatoes, and fresh asparagus - no one missed the meat!

I reduced liquid by 1/2 cup (and used 4 cups fat free cream) and put mixture in a glass pie dish to broil. (no nuts) I sliced like a pie and served under fish with spiced green beans - yum!

We loved this recipe! Definately use a good gorgonzola if possible. I used 2 cups cream & 2 1/2 cups skim milk, as that's what I had on hand. Also added 1 T. butter to the cooked polenta. Definately will make again!

Oh gosh, this was amazingly good! I've made it many times, for us two here at home, fancy dinners and potlucks and even doubling the recipe usually isn't enough. Yes, it's a creamy dish, though reducing the liquid can change that somewhat. I disagree with the cook who suggested plenty of salt in the cooking process. Gorgonzola is a salty cheese, and part of the dish's appeal is the contrast between the piquant saltiness of the melted cheese and the creamy sweetness of the polenta. Oh, and I use Costco's domestic gorgonzola, works fine and isn't expensive at all.

Note to the others who left reviews regarding the consistency of this polenta...it's suppose to be creamy!!! This is a "bowl" of polenta.

Just a quick note to the cook from Michigan, if you make polenta with milk or cream, you can't pick it up, that's why it's called creamy polenta. You have to use stock or water if you want to cut it up into handheld pieces, or to grill it, etc...

I followed the instructions to a "T". I used the dulce goronzola. This was an expensive disaster. I was ashamed watching my guests pick it up and see it fall apart in their hands. If this is supposed to be served as a mush, I don't see that information in the reciped anywhere. I am swearing off polenta for ever more!

I first read about this dish from the Union Square Cafe menu. It sounded so incredible and it is. The flavors go together well, I served it with italian sausage and grilled vegetables. I found another version on the web that adds marscapone, so I added that as well. I will definitely make this again and I will especially make it for company.

I normally dislike polenta, but I loved this recipe. We served it with filet mignon in a roasted red pepper sauce and it was amazing. I used cambanzola (sp?) cheese rather than the gorganzola - it is creamier and "softer." For a leftover appetizer, we cut it into little squares, reheated it, and drizzled balsamic vinegar over it.

I've made this several times, both for occasions and simple meals at home. I'm a great fan of polenta, and this is one of the best recipes I've found....easy and quick to make. Last time I tried using fat free half & half (from Trader Joe's), and it worked perfectly while taking out much of the fat. Yum!

This was wonderful in my view, but interestingly enough, this is one recipe that people either gobble up or don't eat at all. Probably the blue cheese, which some don't like. I did use the gorgonzola dolce, which was very good.

Super-rich, but worth it! Delicious, easy to make and a wonderful pairing with the ginger-mint crusted lamb chops from this site.

For a cocktail party, I poured the polenta mixture into miniture muffin pans. When slightly cooled, I made a very small indentation with my index finger and filled it with a dab of gorgonzola. I covered some with a half of a cherry tomato (cut side up), the others with the chopped walnuts. Broiled them to melt the cheese and garnished the tomato ones with a sprig of basil. They were a big hit, and very easy to make ahead of time, except for the broiling. Some people have mentioned that they don't like the strong flavor of gorgonzola - perhaps they were sold an over-ripe piece, or they might try using a sweeter and milder version called gorgonzola dolce. There's a big difference.

This was heavenly. Make sure to season the polenta liberally with salt and pepper. I like mine a little on the thin side, so I added a bit more milk which made for an extra creamy texture that never turned rubbery.

This was served at our gourmet dinner club, we all loved it and I have made it several times since. A hit wherever it is served.

Very very yummy, and easy too. Made a big fancy meal, and heard back that as wonderful was everything was, this was the best of it. You do need to like gorgonzola though.

I made this as a first-course to take to a friend's house who was cooking dinner. assembled it and just did the final broil in their oven, and it traveled well. it really is the best polenta, very creamy. my only complaint is that with the cream and the gorgonzola it was very rich. we found ourselves rather full after only the first course--perhaps it may be better for a side dish. would have rated a 3.5 if possible.

My husband and I both disliked this recipe. It was too starchy, and the cheese wasn't very good either. I ended up throwing 90% of it away...since it was so bad.

My husband and went to Union Square cafe, where this recipe originated, right after he proposed to me, so I had to try it. I've made it for dinner parties 2 times and both times, my guests raved about it. My only problem with it is it sticks to the heavy pan I boil the polenta in and is hard to clean up. But it's worth it!

This is wonderful and so easy. I even made the polenta ahead of time (stopped before topping w/the gorgonzola), refrigerated it in the pie dish, and then microwaved on a low setting just until lukewarm again before finally topping w/the gorgonzola and broiling right before serving to company. This makes this an excellent dish for entertaining if you want to minimize your time in the kitchen after people arrive. My only changes were that I rubbed the pie dish with olive oil before adding the polenta (I was worried that it might stick) and I did not add the toasted walnuts (just because I ran out of time, though - it is probably even better w/the walnuts).

This is the best polenta!!! My husband also loved it. Remember to gradually mix in the polenta cornmeal. If you pour it in all at once, you will get unmanagable clumps.

This dish is absolute heaven.

delicious. the milk and cream refine and smooth the polenta and distinguish it from the more rustic traditional version made with water and/or stock. i placed the polenta in individual ramekins rather than the one dish and this made delightful individual servings which could be refrigerated for later use should not all the portions be required. overall, this is a recipe to keep for its ease of preparation and delicious qualities!

I had never made polenta before, I found this dish was easy to make and oh-so delicious. I think this recipe says it's supposed to serve six, but it served 3 when I made it! It was so good everyone had seconds and some even had thirds! I maybe have stirred the polenta too long because it was a little rubbery after I baked it, but I think I was the only one that noticed.
