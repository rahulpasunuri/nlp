Very good recipe but I did make some changes. I used coconut milk instead of heavy cream (trying to avoid dairy), also used gluten free spaghetti, added 2 cloves of garlic (minced) after the onions simmered by themselves for maybe 2 minutes. I also added the zest (shredded lemon peel) off of 1 lemon and a tbsp of white wine. I added the salmon last (and I increased it to 1/2 pound of smoked salmon, don't cut the pieces too small, it shrinks quite a bit while cooking). I tossed the pasta with a 1/2 tbsp or so of olive oil after draining. Then I added the salmon mixture and if I added a tiny bit more coconut milk (and put the flame back on) to make sure the pasta had enough sauce. I used a bit of grated parmesan over the pasta (but only per each serving, my husband hates grated cheese!). Definitely try this dish if you like smoked salmon, I love the taste of it with pasta!

I didn't have heavy cream on-hand, but I had lots of plain yogurt. Used that, and just a little splash of half & half since we did have some. Delicious, and healthier.

This has become a GO TO quick dinner. It's so adaptable and I've incorporated some of the ideas from other reviewers depending on what I have on hand. We enjoy spinach added at the end, makes a great one dish meal. I use a skillet large enough to accommodate, and add it at the very end when everything has been tossed together. Lay the spinach on top and cover it till the steam cooks it down. A real favorite.

VERY BLAND and disappointing. This is an over rated recipe and not healthy with heavy cream. A better smoked salmon recipe is called Zesty Smoked Salmon With Spinach Fettuccine at alaskasmokehouse.com

I was trying to make a pasta dish similar to my favorite restaurant's. I used red onion, added additional salmon, and put about 2 T Vodka. It was sweet and yummy.

I NEVER make variations the first time I try a dish. Either I make it as stated or I don't make it. this time, I had nothing in the house, and something had to be made for lunch. I eyeballed it. Used red onions. had no heavy cream or milk so used a gob of cream cheese. my capers were in salt, so skipped adding salt anywhere else. skipped the parmesan and the tossing w olive oil. as another reader stated the salmon did not need to cook, so I threw in in at the very end. IT WAS GREAT. My 2 year old loved it and so did I. he passed me his capers.. ( so much for never modifying recipies)

This was exceptional, but I made the following changes: I used more smoked salmon (by ~50%) and less cream, by~25%. I added saffron to the cream, and used asparagus: very thin, chopped small, and steamed before adding before the cream. My guess is that made as written, it's good but not all that.

Rating: 3
I threw in some lemon zest and a little lemon juice. I also added a little tarragon and chives from the garden.

I like to make this with edamame instead of capers. You don't really need the saltiness of the capers on top of the smoked salmon, and the edamame adds a little nutrition (and tastes great). I also like to add a little white wine to the sauce, and the salmon doesn't need to be cooked before adding to the hot pasta. Overall this is a super easy & quick dish that's easy to customize to your tastes.

Love this meal, we've made it lots since discovering it here, and absolutely second this as a dinner party recipe--it's not a time suck so you get to spend time with your guests AND your guests will love it. We use my dad's AK smoked salmon so we really start out with quality ingredients. Because of dietary restrictions, we actually use soy creamer instead of the real stuff--doesn't take away from our enjoyment!

Yup. Absolutely lovely. I didn't deliberately adapt the recipe but just happened to have on hand half a red onion - always a classic flavour with smoked salmon and better sliced rather than chopped - and a tub of mascarpone instead of the cream (requires that the sauce is then thinned out with some of the reserved pasta water). I served this with a slice of lemon and freshly grated ITALIAN parmeggiano reggiano on the side (if it's not Italian, it can not be parmesan!). Tasted it first with neither lemon nor parmesan ... delicious. With lemon ... delicious. With cheese ... even more delicious (and I hope none of my american friends whom I have told never to serve cheese with fish are reading this). Super mid-week supper.

We have adapted this recipe as follows: use one or two tablespoons of olive oil rather than a quarter cup; substitute two chopped green onions for the white onion; add two tablespoons of chopped dill with the capers; reduce amount of cream to 2/3 cup; add grated zest of half a lemon at the end; skip the parmesan cheese. We serve this with 4 ounces of pappardelle pasta for a very delicious rich dinner for two.

This recipe is quick, easy and oh so delicious! Will definitely be making this again. Like other users have mentioned, you do not have to use as much olive oil as listed in the recipe - 1 to 2 tablespoons is more than enough. Great quick pasta to throw together for guests that will definitely impress!

I did not add any salt to this recipe, some nutmeg instead would make it taste great. did not use any oil. Try sauted mushrooms instead of capers for a small variation - without onions. very good and easy recipe indeed

Great ingredients for a quick and tasty meal. The recipe is porly written, however it is pretty simple. I was born and raised in Italy and I can confirm. Parmesan will ruin this dish. You don't need another salty ingredient and more cheese. You can also do without the cream for the more health conscious people.

After reading the reviews and suggestions I chose to go with a slightly modified lower fat version that hopefully would not skimp on flavor. First, 1/8th cup oil is more than adequate, and I went with a Vidalia onion for a touch of sweetness, I used 1/2 a cup of cream and replaced the balance with a cup of 2% milk mixed with q teaspoon of Better Than Boullion Lobster Stock Base reduced to 3/4's of a cup. I added thawed frozen peas and to not mar the texture of cold smoked salmon, added it last. The result was delicious.

Easy to cook and a crowd pleaser. Added roasted pine nuts for crunchy feel and added half a bottle of (four brothers) Alfredo sauce to make it nice and thick (I like it that way). Alfredo sauce is optional, but pine nuts definately add to it.

In addition to the recipe, I added garlic and spinach leaves, about 1 small handful per serving. I added the spinach just a few minutes before serving. Wonderful!

Using sliced salmon, it was best to add strips at the very end when the pasta and sauce have been mixed. Also, double the amount of capers. Otherwise, a great, simple recipe.

At the risk of sounding repetitive it was a very EASY delicious dish to make! When I talked about tweeking it a bit (stronger smoked salmon, peas,.... my husband who is my best food critic said.."no way"! I did use a leek + 2 green onions but that was the only change I made.Having everything ready ahead of time makes this meal one of those eating experiences that makes you realize it really doesn't have to be complicated to be good. All of these ingredients except the heavy cream would be available at home, at your cottage , in your boat galley, etc. Try it!!

Had a filet of smoked salmon and looked up this recipe.Delish!I did do it with the leeks instead of onion, the lemon zest + juice, garlic, capers a must. Had everything prepared ahead. Also added the smoked salmon at the end. I think this dish would work with fresh salmon or leftover cooked filet of salmon.I will def. make this recipe again. I used the Barilla Farfalle as suggested earlier. Don't you love this website? Awesome!!!!

Some readers may blanch at this, but I replaced the cream with fat-free half-&-half. And it was still delicious! I also added frozen peas, and their sweetness perfectly complemented the salty salmon and zing of the capers.

I made this dish according to the recipe (with the exception of adding a bit extra salmon). I used salmon that I had smoked on our smoker at home, so there wasn't any translucent color, more of a chunky texture (like tuna). I don't know how it tastes with "east-coast uncooked smoked salmon", but everyone loved it. I would like to try it again, reducing the amount of olive oil and using 1/2 and 1/2 -- just too many calories there! Also, I like the idea of adding the lemon zest and some dill. Will try those next time. Thanks!

My best friend VERONIQUE from Sarasota/France made this for me last night and it was simply delicious. I would suggest serving immediately as the pasta absorbs the sauce. I will make it adding red pimentos and a touch of fresh garlic and black pepper.

Woohoo! Finally, a salmon dish that got raves from a mojor salmon disser. Even the capers, another dis, were not enough to fend off "Wow, really good!" followed by "There's more left, isn't there?". Totally easy, and even modifiable, yet totally grand. Again, Waahoo!

This was soooo good! I sauted the onions in 2 tablespoons of olive oil & 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter. Also used ff 1/2 & 1/2 & whip cream. Added a bit of pasta water to the sauce. No extra salt needed, but freshly grated black pepper. I added the smoked salmon at the last minute. It was perfect. I also served it with the parmesan. :) Great use of left over smoked salmon. Plus it only takes the time to cook the pasta to prepare it!

Two forks - and tha's with doctoring it up! Used butter to saute the onions, added lemon zest and dried dill (fresh would have been better). The smoked salmon came out with a rubbery texture which was not appealing. On the bright side, it's quick and easy.

Have made this 3 times, the first 2 exactly as written. The 3rd time, I didn't have enough heavy cream, but had just enough sour cream to make up the difference. Also had a lot of fresh dill in the fridge, so chopped about 3 Tbsp. and added it with the capers. Heavenly all 3 times. Added NO salt, except what was in the pasta water, and this was just right. Reduced the olive oil to 1 Tbsp.without sacrificing flavor.

This dish was my dinner solution on what to do with the leftover smoked salmon and light scallion cream cheese from our Sunday brunch. My only change was to use the cream cheese mixed with some light sour cream instead of the heavy cream called for. And no salt, as the salmon and capers provided plenty. The sauce was thick, but thinned out nicely without losing flavor with the addition of some pasta cooking water. I used Barilla farfalle for the pasta, and simply poured the sauce over each portion individually. Very nice indeed, with a mesclun salad for accompaniment. My husband doesn't like capers and thus picked them out, but I loved it.

This was great! So easy! To finish, add a squeeze of lemon over each serving. Try it with and without the lemon - you'll see. It's unbelievable! Also used less olive oil and more half and half - plenty rich without heavy cream! Very quick and delicious!

I found this dish to be a bit heavy, but good overall. I added Paprika to the cream to give it a pinkish tint, and I used veggie-stock instead of water. Bowties work really well for the pasta.

I used less oil. 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream. Added garlic with the onion, and then a large tomatoe. Also added cooked peas with the cream and capers. My goal was less fat and salt and more flavor. It was a success and very easy and quick.

I tinkered with this recipe, added a clove of garlic, cut back on the amount of olive oil to about a tablespoon, used leeks instead of onion (white parts of three leeks), and added about a tablespoon of grainy mustard before adding the cream, also added a big splash of black pepper vodka at the same time as the mustard. Used spinach linguine to give some contrast to the cream sauce.

I loved this recipe, but I added and subtracted a few of the ingredients. I used gemelli pasta and only used 8 ounces-I am only. I used regular salmon filet instead of smoked (smoked is too salty for me). Also, I used only 1/2 cup of cream because that was all I had in the frig and it was not dry at all. I omitted the olive oil, too, and replaced it with low-fat butter. I added one diced tomato. Turned out sooo delicious and pretty! I wouldn't make it for company, though.

Although my friends raved about this dish, I would make some modifications next time. First, I would add the smoked salmon right at the end, so it retains some translucency and doesn't look like canned salmon. Also, the recipe calls for way too much oil, after I added the cream, a lot of oil floated on top and I had to spoon it off. I wouldn't add any salt because the salmon and capers are really salty as the recipe says. I had to dilute it with more cream. That said, this was super easy to make and the result was a crowd pleaser.

I made this recipe with non-fat half-n-half instead of cream and omitted the salt altogether. I used the bow-ties and the Parmesan cheese.I also used flaked salmon from a whole smoked salmon that I received for Christmas instead of the lox-style salmon. It was very tasty. I thinned the sauce with more half-n-half. I love capers, so this recipe rates a 4-fork, but because I needed to defat it, I gave it three forks.

This recipe was excellent. I used Asiago Cheese instead of the Parmesan Cheese. A few suggestions: I used a cup of the cheese and more milk to give it an alfredo texture. I also added a little dry vermouth to make it creamer. This dish was a hit. My mom, who isn't a real pasta fan, loved the dish. I will definitely make this again.

I give it 3 stars for my own variation. First, I am cheap, so I used canned salmon! :O Second, I used just a small amount of fat-free half and half instead of cream. And I added some lemon zest, some lemon juice, lemon pepper, garlic powder and tarragon. Plus the capers of course. Now that is a good recipe!

. . . until the salmon turns opaque? Oh, I get it--this is made with East Coast uncooked smoked salmon. The recipe is good as it stands, but it could be better--witness the regionality mentioned above.

Although I only gave this dish 2 forks, it was tasty. It just wasn't very special. I think 1/4 cup oil is too much and you could get away with less. I also think adding a hint of garlic would kick up the flavor a bit. I didn't add any salt, but did add lots of black pepper and that helped. I would make it again, but not right away.

I prefer to add the smoked salmon right at the end. The salmon just barely cooks in the heat of the pasta. Add chopped parsley if you want a bit more colour. Cheese with a seafood pasta sounds odd, but Parmesan definitely works with this recipe.

Very quick and tasty!I served it with a simple mixed green salad which really complimented the rich flavour of the smoked salmon and also added a bit of colour to the plate.
