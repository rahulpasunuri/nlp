Loved this recipe! It was slightly oily for my tastes so when I made it a second time I drained some of the oil and used a little more avocado. It was so good on mahi mahi. If you drain a lot of the oil, it's great on tacos too!

Almost perfect - it needed an entire avocado! It was delicious on the homemade chicken quesadillas I served last night.
