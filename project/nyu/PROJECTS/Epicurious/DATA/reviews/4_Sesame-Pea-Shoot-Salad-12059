Loved it! Took the advice of other reviewers and added some carrots to it. It's a definite keeper.

Four forks with a few additions & julienned carrots, spring onions and sautéed sea scallops. This make it a suburb entrée salad. I went with the ½ TB of light brown sugar, more would have been too sweet. I also prefer my veges crisp tender and reduced the blanching time to suit that preference.

I kept my snap peas fresh (used 3 cups), omitted the snow peas and green peas, and added in 1 cup edamame. I really liked the salad, although the dressing was not profoundly exhilarating. The stars were the fresh veggies. Love pea shoots here.

I am always looking for different pea recipes this time of year. Made this recipe with fresh peas from the garden (snow, snap, and shelling). I didn't want to overcook the peas so I cut the blanching time in 1/2 (cooked snap peas for one minute, then added snow and shelled peas for 30 seconds). I couldn't imagine cooking them longer. The salad was so easy and tasty. It good reviews at the BBQ I took it to, but in the end, I think I would prefer the salad fresh and skip the quick blanch. Dressing is super easy and tasty. I'll make this again for sure.

I forgot the forksit's my first review! I look eagerly in the Asian market nearby for pea shoots, just for this recipe.

This tastes so GREEEEN! Our faculty salad club loved it.

WOW. I made this after my farmshare box contained peashoots, which I had never eaten before. It was SO easy - I literally threw it together after running late at the gym - and my husband and two-year old son loved it. We actually served it over rice with pan-fried tofu, which was very nice. I wished I had chopped up the peashoots a bit, though - they were long, and my husband said it made him feel like a rabbit.

Used as a basis for a "clean out the fridge before vacation" salad. I used sugar snap peas, carrot matchsticks and finely chopped romaine for a salad that everyone ate up. Used a bit less brown sugar, but kept to the other proportions and the dressing was a big success. (And the veggie bin empty!)

This salad is a fantastic spring salad! I used less brown sugar and more vinegar than indicated. You'll certainly want to adjust the dressing to taste before adding to the peas. I couldn't find pea shoots so I used a combination of bean sprouts and some sprouted beans (served as a snack usually - I found them in Whole Foods). The salad gets better as it sits over the course of a day.

Dressing has a very nice flavor that matches with the pea shoots. We did not like the mix of textures between the pea shoots and snap peas. (I'm not sure how someone would use bamboo shoots instead of pea shoots, though...pea shoots are the delicate leaves and tendrils of the snow pea plant.) In the future, I would use the dressing on the pea shoots only, as a salad, or tossing the shoots and dressing with a handful of pad thai noodles.

A very nice starter for an Asian dinner. Eye appealing and loved the texture/crunch. An out-of-the-ordinary salad that awakens the appetite. Will go in my favourites file.

This is a lovely salad - really enjoy the medley of peas. Have also made a variation - served on a bed of mesclun greens rather than pea shoots, drizzled with creamy cucumber/dill/lemon dressing. Have also subbed fresh mint for the dill. Very refreshing and eye appealing salad no matter which dressing you use.

This is one of our favorite salads. I cannot always find pea shoots so I substitute bamboo shoots. You can substitute just about any green or oriental vegetable but the frozen peas and snow peas are essential.
