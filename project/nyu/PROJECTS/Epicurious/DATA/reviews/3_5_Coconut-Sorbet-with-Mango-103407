Having made many drinks with cream of coconut, I knew it would be too sweet for me if left undiluted, so I added a can (14 oz.) of unsweetened coconut milk to the mix. The result was tasty although a bit too much like a pina colada w/o the rum, which is nice, but I wanted a more straightforward coconut taste. Next time I will either greatly reduce or eliminate the lime juice.

To the cook from Mill Valley, try using coconut milk (not light). It is made by straining the liquid out of coconut meat--pure coconut! And, great flavor; no need to add sugar.

Yes, it is sinfully awful from a nutrition standpoint, but sometimes you just gotta live a little. For something so easy, this was really, really good. All of my guests loved the sorbet, and yes, it was sweet, but you don't gobble up huge bowls of it. I served a small scoop alongside a tropical fruit salad, and it was perfect. I didn't notice that this sorbet melted fast, after it had sat in the freezer overnight. What I noticed was that it didn't freeze very well in my Cuisinart ice cream maker. It was pretty runny and never froze very well in the machine. I wound up putting it into my freezer and stirring it up every hour or so until it froze solid.

I may be the only dissenting voice here, but the only thing I liked about this recipe was the ease of preparation. Other than that, I found it to be far too sweet for my tastes, and was also rather horrified when I read the ingredient list on the cream of coconut can -- the main ingredients are sugar and hydrogenated palm oil. Blech! I went ahead with it because I had already committed to a menu for a dinner party, but I would not make it again. I'm sure there are better recipes, with better ingredients, for coconut sorbet out there. It will probably be more work, but it will be worth it.

We loved it. I am allergic to milk, so it was nice to find something with the creaminess of ice cream, not just the standard fruit juice sorbet. I served it to friends as part of a vietnamese menu. Everyone raved. We will make this again and again.

I just had to add my two cents to the rest of the rave reviews! This may be the best dessert ever. Its easy and different from the usual sorbets. A definite hit with family and guests. I didn't have trouble with meltdown, but I also gave it another 12 hrs in the frezzer before serving. A perfect summer quencher!

I have made this twice in the last week and it is great! Goes very fast around my house. I transfer it into a plastic bowl with a lid after the Krups machine does its thing. It firms up very well. Someone left several airplane bottles of rum at my house last summer and I have been throwing one of those in a double batch and it gives it a good flavor and is not too rummy for the kids. This is definately a keeper!

This recipe is both easy and delicious. While it is definitely not low fat my husband said that it was the best thing he's ever tasted. Who could resist that? As the other reviewers mentioned, it does melt very quickly...if made a day in advance it does firm up a little bit more.

I can only agree wholeheartedly with the previous review...I too had reservations about using all canned ingredients but this recipe is a real winner. We have it all the time with Thai and Indian food (my husband is from Calcutta) and it makes a light, refreshing finish to any meal. It does melt quickly, but your guests will probably eat it up so fast they won't notice.

Don't be put off by the use of canned ingredients. This is a lovely light dessert that is perfect with Thai, Indian or any type of asian or pacific cuisine. Goes together in no time and is just delicious! We have served it again and again and gotten rave reviews each time. One word of caution--scoop and serve FAST. This melts very quickly.
