as I made several deviations, I will not rate it but it was a 4 for us. Eliminated the bread exc to dust the bottom of a buttered pie pan. Roasted as suggested and used processor w. a few extra eggs and then added some tips and onions (unprocessed), worchester and tobassco and topped w. extra Jarslburg cheese and more roasted aspargus tips. Was more of a custard than a quiche at the end. Worked well w. ham and the upside down pineapple pancakes. Enjoyed by 18-95 yrs age.

I don't know what I did or didn't do, but this was awful -- the color and texture reminded me of babyfood.

I made this for the 2nd time to go with ham -I got the flavors to pop by cooking the tips per the recipe & roasted the onion & chopped asparagus in olive oil s&p-& added a few drops of tabascoto the mix -yum!

I made this again for Easter dinner, and everyone LOVED it. Rave reviews from all the guests, even those who don't normally like asparagus. I used a pie pan and cut it into wedges instead of making individual tarts, and it was fine. (I also added about 1 cup of cooked shrimp, which actually didn't add all that much to the dish. I'll keep it asparagus-only in the future.) This recipe is a definite keeper - enjoy!

I tried adding Spam to this recipe and it was really killer! I didn't have any of those fancy cheeses on hand, so I used American and Swiss deli slices from Kraft. Let me tell you, my guests didn't know the difference.

What a great recipe and easy to make. For the person who said is was spongy, this was most likely due to using a hand mixer or low speed blender. After blending it in my new blender on high it was very creamy. Yum.

I served this as a separate course at a dinner party. It was a real winner. A lovely smooth texture. I added basil oil on the side and surrounded it with thin slices of roasted red pepper.

I served this as an Easter dinner first course. We loved this dish - even the kids liked it! It came out very creamy and smooth - I think the trick to avoid keeping it from being "spongy" is not to overcook. I used fat-free ricotta and it turned out just fine. Adding lump fin crab meat and serving larger portions would make a terrific brunch dish.

My mother has been making a "sformato" ever since I can remember but has always made a large one in a springform pan instead of individual ramekins and has cut it like a pie. What she has also added to it is some cut up salami and ham (probably about 1/4 pound of each). I like the idea of individual cute servings.

I thought this was okay but not fantastic, but I could see where a lot of people might think it was fantistic. I would not make it for a dinner party as it is something that is just too iffy--people will either like it or hate it. I do, however, disagree with the Columbus, Ohio, cook who said it was "spongy." Mine came out very smooth.

I made this over the weekend to serve to guests, and everybody seemed to like it but didn't exactly "rave" over it. I found it to have a very nice and surprisingly rich flavor, but the texture, although nice and light, was almost spongy, which is probably the only element that kept it from being what I consider a real winner. Definitely good, though, and probably one I'd try again.

This is a wonderfully elegant dish and very easy. Made for a dinner party and everyone was raving. Will definitely make this dish again. This would be lovely as a brunch dish as well.

Wonderful flavour!! (hint, instead of buttering the ramekins, spray them with cooking spray -- the souffles in buttered dishes did not unmould as well as did the others)
