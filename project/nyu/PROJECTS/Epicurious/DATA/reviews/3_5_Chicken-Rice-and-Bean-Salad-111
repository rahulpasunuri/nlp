I just made this salad today with a few chages. First of all, after reading the other reviews before I assembled the salad, I decided to cut the dry ingredients in half. (Chicken, rice, black beans pepper and onion.) Then I DOUBLED the dressing. This seemed to elimanate the complaint of dryness of the salad. It also increased the flavor! Especially the garlic! Yum! I also took the advice of another reviewer and grilled the chicken breasts for more flavor. These are the other changes I made: While grilling the chicken, I rubbed the breasts with equal parts of cumin and cajun seasoning. During the making of the dressing, I used equal parts of cumin and cajun seasoning instead of just cumin. I added coarsly ground pepper, and more salt. I used a rice medley which included brown and wild rice. Other additions were black olives, and blue cheese. The chicken broth was 97% fat free with a garlic flavor. (Swanson's) Even cutting this recipe essentially in half it still makes a lot. I thought my version was very tasty!

I was unimpressed with the dressing. The dressing was definitely missing something. However, this was a beautiful salad. I will try again - perhaps with a dressing from another recipe.

Not gourmet by any means, but simple to make. I used a whole Vidalia onion, and marinated the chicken overnight in a ginger soy marinade (store-bought), using the rest of the marinade to toss in before serving. Grilled the chicken on charcoal grill for better flavor. Recipe as is is quite dry and somewhat bland, need to at least double the liquid. The next time I made it, doubled the rice, too. Good summer meal that you can prepare ahead of time.

This recipe produces a large quantity. It could easily feed 6-8 If I make it again, I would ABSOLUTELY add more flavor. I tried some ginger salad dressing on the leftovers which improved it greatly.

This is one of those great recipe's that you can substitute whatever you have on hand. I added some Chardonney Vinegar and some lemon juice for some added acidity. I used leftover brown rice and leftover baked chicken. I was out of Cilantro so I tried some mint leaves and parsley. My family loved it and I'll be making it agian for the football party this weekend!

When I made this, I used only one can of black beans. I also added more salt and cumin to the finished salad. It was a great party dish. I added some tomato and jack cheese to the leftovers and used it for a stuffing for baked green peppers - very nice!

I enjoyed this very much. easy to prepare, fresh taste and low fat. The dressing could use a bit more of a kick -- I added some sliced jalapeno over night.

This recipe was easy and simple to to make. I used a grill pan to make my chicken rather than the broiler. You could substitute leftover chicken or turkey. It makes a ton of food! Great for a buffet. The next day it tased a bit dry and needed additional dressing. I made the dressing from the "Mango Jicama Chopped Salad" which is lime based. It needed more liquid.

I made this with some good quality leftover converted rice. I cooked my chicken over a low flame on the grill for 1/2 hour and served it on a bed of chopped lettuce and green cabbage with some additional Greek style vinagrette dressing on the side. Avocado goes well with it too and a little salsa with chips on the side.

This is good, but I feel it's missing something. Maybe some flavored vinegar or maybe it needs more lime juice. It makes a ton of food, and it's pretty healthy, too. I detest bell peppers, so I omitted them. My husband loves it.

Yummy and healthy. This is a lot of food. I halved the reciped and it made enough for 4 people. Red bell pepper works better and is prettier than green. By the way, if you halve the recipe, the cooked rice turns out fine, but only needs about 18 minutes of simmering on VERY low heat. No other adjusting needed. Just 1/2 everything.

Made this one by the book the first time out and it was delicious. Next time, we'll probably skip the oil in the dressing and increase the onion to include a whole onion. Funny thing we noticed is that this dish makes a more-than-serviceable black bean and corn salsa before you add the rice and chicken.

I found this to be a nice, easy, healthy family night dish. Leftovers are good. It is an adaptation of a similar vegetarian recipe. I'll make it regularly.

Loved the way this tasted, but it's a lot of work!! Lots of chopping, dicing and mixing - and it makes LOTS of food! Plenty for leftovers, which are even better than the first time around...
