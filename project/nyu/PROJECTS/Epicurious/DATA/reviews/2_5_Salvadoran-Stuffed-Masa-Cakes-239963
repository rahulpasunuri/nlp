I have just watched this video and can't believe what an embarrasement this is. I am from El Salvador and cannot believe how this chef has butchered my country's authentic dish. From the picture alone, I knew this was not a pupusa. For anyone to ever post a video on any type of dish, I think they should do research and give the proper respect to a country's culture and food.

I am honestly insulted by this recipe. No one bothered to do a little research into one of the most loved dishes from El Salvador? It's fine that the chef is Mexican and that he wanted to do a twist on the pupusa. However, he should have followed some basics but what he did here is like a mix of an empanada and a taco. It's not recognizable as a pupusa at all. The pork rinds, the mozzarella, the tortilla press, the deep frying...none of these things are part of pupusa making. Do an internet search for pupusas and you'll find better recipes elsewhere.

I am a native Salvadoran. This is certainly not a pupusa recipe at all.

Where are these Pupusas from??? Definitively not from El Salvador. This is the worst video on how to make Pupusas I have ever seen!!!!! That kind of chicharron and that type of beans are not used to make them and the cheese is never just plain mozzarella. Where is the curtido? Where is the salsa? Is the chef Mexican, making Gorditas!?!?!?!? I love each recipe I have made from epicurious but this one is very disappointing! As a salvadorian I find it horrifying to see a completely different recipe presented as our national dish. Please do your research before you make a video like this. For anybody who wants to follow the video, feel free to try it. It might taste good. Just don't serve it to a Salvadorian and call it a pupusa or you will get laughed out of the room!

I really think you need to invite an authentic Salvadorian chef. This is way too far from being a pupusa. Starting from the filling ingredients and preparation. Please invite a Salvadorian to cook the real pupusas if you are a serious website.

With all due respect, if we are going to take on making recipes from around the world the proper research needs to be done! First, beans are not kidney, they are small red beans. Second, there are no pork rinds in pupusas! It is pork meat which is fried not fat. To add insult to injury pupusas are made on the grill not fried!' I am Salvadoran by birth and my great grandmother made the best pupusas in San Salvador. I appreciate the thought of including my country in your recipes... but you have us a great injustice!!!!!!!! Shame on Sergio for having so little pride in his work!

This is a pathetic example of how Anglo-American culture mixes up "Central American" food with "Mexican" food. Chef Sergio Remolina (the guy who supplied this recipe) is MEXICAN. Pupusas are SALVADORAN. BIG DIFFERENCE!! Salvadoran food is NOT Mexican food. REAL pupusas are made with masa flour rolled into balls, carefully indented with the thumb, filled with beans/cheese, and flattened by patting it carefully with your palms. It is a carefully honed skill and art. If you use a tortilla press like this Mexican chef, you are not making pupusas. Tortilla press = tortillas = not pupusas. It's as simple as that. I'm really disappointed by this recipe, and I'm really upset that Chef Sergio Remolina knowingly gave a false recipe. My husband is Salvadoran, and seeing pupusas butchered by the ignorant masses is really upsetting. "Central American" food is not equivalent to "Mexican food". Epicurious - you need to brush up on your cultural knowledge.

I agree with the others, this is not a pupusa.

This is false, this is not what a pupusa looks like nor how you make it. The video is incorrect, what you are teaching people how to make is called a pastelito in El Salvador. Your website should actually hire people from the native country to show others or you can visit the country and see for yourself. ***THIS IS NOT A PUPUSA***

So sad... this are not pupusas.. I cannot even rate them because I cannot give even a 1 fork to a recipe that is wrong to begin with! Please do not think that you are making pupusas when using this recipe!! I am Salvadorean and it is very sad to see this recipe in epicurious as I had always held them to a higher standard than this! If anyone is looking to learn how to make pupusas, I would definitely recommend they look for another recipe as this is not it.

OMG!! ESAS OBVIAMENTE NO SON PUPUSAS! I'M SLVADORIAN AND I'M DISAGREE! TO MAKE PUPUSA YO DON'T HAVE TO FRY THEM! ESTO ES UN INSULTO A LA COMIDA SALVADOREÑA V.V

I agree with iinteriano. I've eaten a gazillion pupusas made my many of the awesome Salvadorean chefs in LA, and ALL of the legitimate ones are NEVER fried, only griddled. The only oil that goes into Salvadoran pupusas is the oil that sometimes oozes out of the cheese onto the griddle. Epicurious, hold yourselves to the high standard I hold you to...PLEASE!

I'm sorry but Pupusas are NEVER fried. The tortillas are NEVER pressed in a tortilla maker, as are the mexican tortillas. The Salvadoran pupusas are hand made, starting as a ball. A hole is pressed in the center and the filling is put in. Then with the hand the round shape is formed and the tortilla is thick, ... See Moreabout 1/4 inch. You can put on a griddle, but never with oil. When the masa is cooked, it can be lifted without problems and flipped over. It it usually served with pickled cabbage called CURTIDO. I can't believe that a site like yours didn't do any legitimate research....oh yes, maybe you saw Taco Cabana pupusas...well THOSE ARE NOT PUPUSAS!!!! Sincerely, A 100% Salvadoran.

this are not pupusas. the are call empanadas. Pupusas are a thick round flat disk stuff, the are never never fry, they are cooked in the skillet. It is a shame they bring a chef who donot know what is doing.

Omg, the video and techniques here... superb! I did make a few changes based on my preferences and would even venture so far as to say I'll make *more* adjustments next time, but this is such a great start for me. I cheated by using already-mixed masa and, even though I bought a comal expressly for this purpose, I ended up "shallow-deep" frying them in canola oil until medium-brown (perfect!) and drained on paper towels. The reason the comal didn't work was because the pupusas don't lay perfectly flat on either side using this "fold over", half circle shaping method. The surface doesn't make uniform contact with the pan, therefore, they don't cook evenly. I think if you made the pupusas the other way (two round layers of masa, filling in between and sealed on the edges), one would be more successful browning the entire surface of each side. Also, the cheese was a total non-event even though I used fresh mozzarella. I believe it's just too mild to make a statement here. I'd use a more flavorful cheese next time, and more of it for a better consistency. With the curtido (Salvadoran Coleslaw), it was very good and will only improve as I do!

Traditionally these have diffrent fillings all are yummy. My favorite is Laroca (a kind of flower) These are best with a light red sauce that gives spice and gordito a cabbage slaw that is sour add a little cremea from a latino market, get the stuff from the dairy case a diffrent texture that regular sour cream and more sour. Stop in at a pupusaria and try out a traditional favorite.

as i remember, there is a tomato sauce to go over the slaw and pupusas that take this dish from very good to exceptional. try to include that sauce if you make this dish.

I used fried pork rinds which i bought in the chip section of a grocery store. I assume this is not the same thing as chicharron but it's all i had access to. I really enloyed eating and making them. I served them with the coleslaw which was also good
