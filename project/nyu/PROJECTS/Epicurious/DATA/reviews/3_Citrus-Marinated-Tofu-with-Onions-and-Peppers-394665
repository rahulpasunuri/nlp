Delicious! I was worried the marinade time would be too short to create any serious flavor but I was wrong, it was fantastic. I added a splash of orange juice to compensate for too few limes and grilled the tofu---even my boyfriend raved (and he is new to tofu). Didn't have any paprika but I will definitely use next time, delicious without it and probably mind blowing with it. Served with quinoa and will make again and again!

This was really yummy! The sauce is so fresh and tangy, my whole family loved it. Instead of the full amount of lime juice, I used 1/3 cup of mandarin juice and 1/3 lime....and it made it slightly sweeter. I recommending roasting the veggies and tofu longer than 25 minutes, so that the onions and peppers really get a chance to caramelize and the tofu dries out and gets more of a chewy texture. We'll definitely repeat this one!

Definitely good. I see the other guys point of being too sour but just don't drench the cooked tofu with the lime juice cilantro puree and your fine. Drip it on. I used firm tofu, poked it with a knife, and marinated it for 20 minutes. It was awesome. The tofu doesn't get at all crispy so pan frying the whole time or searing it after may fix that issue. Smoked paprika was a good idea and may be my new favorite spice. Thanks for the recipe.

I enjoyed this dish a lot. Will go into our weeknight rotation for sure. It was pretty healthy and easy to make, and tastes great too. Next time I will try it with firm tofu, the medium didn't have enough bite to it for me.

This dish is just delicious: a bright, fresh alternative to throwing tofu into a stir-fry. I served it with quinoa to rave reviews. I did not find the tofu sour or the paprika overpowering. This will be a regular vegetarian dish in our household.

I followed this recipe exactly and was not pleased with the result. The lime juice made the tofu very sour (even the bit of honey didn't offset this) and the smoked paprika made for a god-awful combination. Don't waste your time with this one!

DELICIOUS! Would really have given 3.5 forks, as I generally reserve 4 for extraordinary dishes, but definitely could be worth 4 forks. I always look for an alternative tofu marinade to the usual soy or balsamic vinegar marinade. This was bright, fresh, and different. Definitely a recipe that I intend to make again. Served with brown rice. I pan-fried the tofu instead of baked because I was concerned it might not be ready in time. Was delicious with the crispy edges and contrary to mu expectations, the cilantro came out great even when fried. Definitely recommend if you like tofu.
