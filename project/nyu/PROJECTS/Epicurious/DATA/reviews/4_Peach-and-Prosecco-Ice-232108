Delicious, fun to make, different, a very nice treat. Super easy and a little elegant. This was my dessert in a meal where all pairings were different kinds of sparkling wine. GOOD TIMES!!

Love this drink, as did everyone else at my Christmas dinner last year. It was very easy to make as well.

OK, I cheated. I heard someone talking about this on the radio and instead of making the sorbet I used purchased sorbet. It was amazing. Yum!!!
