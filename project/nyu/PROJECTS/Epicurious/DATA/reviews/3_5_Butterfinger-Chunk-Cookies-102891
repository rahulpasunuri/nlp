I thought they were average, but maybe that is because I don't like butterfingers that much (made for friend who loves butterfingers). Cookies did turn out nicely though. Not too crisp, not too soft. I doubled the recipe and used 3/8 baking soda and added 1\2 c chocolate chips as one reviewer suggested.

Best. Cookies. Ever. Recommend doubling recipe, can use a little less sugar, and generously add crushed Butterfinger candies. Watch carefully at end of baking time as they continue to cook while the parchment paper is resting on the cooling rack. Peel off parchment when cool. Wipe any crumbs off the parchment paper and re-use. We keep frozen logs of this dough handy at all times!

This is one of my favorite recipes! My only change is to use a Butterfinger Bar and crush it. The Butterfinger pieces melt nicely with the chocolate. These don't last long in our house.

My husband loves these cookies, I think they're good but not fantastic. Last night we made them with Reese's BB's because we couldn't find Butterfinger BB's and the chocolate peanut butter taste was not throughout the cookie. Tonight we made them using crushed Butterfinger and they were a lot better, taste and texture. Hopefully they will be a hit at tomorrow night's Oscar party

The cookies were great my family loves them. When I bake them in the oven and they were finishing baking. They didn't come out flat. You have to mix the dark brown sugar, granulated sugar, butter. And then add the egg and the vanilla extract and beat it until it's fluffy. I use the butteringer candy bar and chop into chunks.

Suggestion to the folks who had trouble getting the cookies off the parchment without them breaking up. Maybe you're not chilling the dough long enough. Try making the dough one day and baking the cookies the next (or put the dough in the freezer for a while) Also, you might not be baking the cookies quite long enough. Also, it's very important to IMMEDIATELY remove the cookies, parchment and all, to the cooling racks when they come out of the oven. When they're totally cool PEEL them off the parchment don't use a spatula. Oh, and be sure not to re-use the parchment. Start with a new sheet each batch, on totally COOLED baking sheets

I agree with everyone this is a keeper. But I also have a very hard time getting them off the parchment paper. They always spread very thin and then break when they cool and I try to peel them off the paper. I have only used chunks as I can not find the BB's in my local supermarket. Even broken my family does not care and devours them instantly.

I made these for a family BBQ and they were gone in 2 hours! I made them with chunks of Butterfingers instead of the BBs and it turned out great.

I made these exactly like the recipe called for. They were delicious. I baked one sheet at a time in the middle of the oven. I had no problems with them being too crispy and etc. I also used a middle size ice cream scoop which was very helpful. That may have made a difference with the way they turned out since they do spread. Very good. Taste so buttery. I liked it with the BBs. This is a keeper.

They're a little tricky on the baking side; done them several times, USE WAXED PAPER and be sure to wait for them to cool before getting them off the paper. Keep a very close eye while they're in the oven and take them out a little after when the little bubbles on the cookie are popping. They're worth the trouble, definitely, though they can be too sweet for some people!!

I too was disappointed with this recipe after reading all the rave reviews. I also used this recipe for a cookie exchange and now wish I hadn't. The cookies are not chunky at all and they were a little to crisp for me.

This is the best cookie i have ever made or tasted. I made them for several people who could not get enough. I too used cut up Butterfinger bars instead of the bb's, and I loved the chunks.

This is by far the best cookie I have ever eaten. I use butterfinger bars(and plenty of them)I also flatten them as soon as they come out of the oven! Parchment paper helps too. I can't tell you how many people pull me over at parties and say "how much will it cost me for a dozen?"

I enjoyed this recipe with the bb's but the dough is even better used as a chocolate chip cookie base. The outside is crispy and the inside chewy. For some reason the recipe is better with margarine - it makes the dough chewier.

These cookies were excellent. My Husband loved these, his new favorite. My only suggestion is to let the cookies cool completely before even attempting to tranfer off the wax paper. Also, make sure you chill the dough!!

I also had difficulty finding Butterfinger bb's, so I chopped up one and a half cups'worth of regular Butterfinger bars. The cookies were delicious.

I advise you not to use the bb's but rather chopped butterfinger candybars, my bb's burnt so bad that the whole bb came out on the pan when i lifted up a cookie and not with the cookie- that was disappointing.

Everytime I make these cookies people rave about them! They have been the hit of many parties. Only suggestion is that the more time in the fridge before you bake the better.

Great Recipe! I also used chopped butterfingers vs the bbs and choc chips too! My husband is a huge fan of crispy cookies and was not disappointed! They are now his favorites!

I have tried these with Heath bits and with Butterfinger BBs, with a handful of chocolate chips tossed in for good measure. Both taste great. I agree with another reviewer that the recipe as written resulted in cookies that seemed a little too flat. I reduced the baking soda to 3/8 tsp. and found the thickness to be just right for the big candy pieces.

I made two batches of these cookies today after reading all of the rave reviews this recipe received and I am disappointed. I had never eaten a Butterfingers candy bar before and now I know I never will again. It ruined the whole taste of the cookie.

Rating: 4
This is a great cookie recipe - soft and chewy. Thanks for the recommendation to take them right off the pan. I didn't have parchment so I just lightly sprayed my insulated cookie sheet and seemed to be fine. I used crispy m&m's this time with chocolate chunks! Next time I'll try the BB's!

I've made these numerous times and each time they've been a hit... I brought over 100 to my office of 10 people and they were gone within 2 hours! These make regular chocolate chip cookies look boring :)

This recipe was amazing!! I couldn't find BB's so I chopped up 2 and a half jumbo Butterfingers chocolate bars and a handful of chocolate chips for extra yum. I brought them to a BBQ and I was the only one with no leftovers! You have to make sure though that you pull the parchment (and cookies) paper off the cookie sheet and right onto the cooling racks as soon as they come out of the oven because if not they continue to bake on the cookie sheets and they won't be moist and chewy. The Butterfinger part makes them taste like they have a peanut buttery taffey in them. Bet you can't eat just one!!!

Very good. I made these last night and they were even better today. No problem finding the Butterfinger BBs - also threw in about a half cup of semisweet chocolate chips. Yum.

I couldn't find Butterfinger BBs, so we used Heath Bar "bites" instead. My ten-year-old daughter and her friend insisted on making these without any help, and they turned out great. Definitely couldn't be easier.

I brought these camping with a big group of people and they were gone before I put the dish down. The best cookie I have ever had. I use this recipe with plain chocolate chips to.

These cookies were great! I agree that they were a little too crunchy though, the BBs seem to be too big. Next time I think I will try them with regular Butterfingers crunched up. I added some chopped walnuts too, which worked really well.

I guess I am the only one to give this recipe a so-so review. I found the cookies to be way too crispy and not very special until I added the chocolate chips. Unfortunately, I made them for a cookie exchange and wished I would have chose something different. While the taste wasn't BAD, it didn't knock my socks off. :o( Oh, well. I'll try another!!

These dissapeared so fast! I went to 3 stores and nobody had the butterfinger BB's so I used the reeses bites and they were really good. Next time I see the butterfinger BB's I'll try it with them but if you cant find them i definitly reccomend the reeses bites.

These cookies were excellent. Easy to make and REALLY easy to eat. I baked them in the evening and they were gone that same evening. My brother was the only person besides me who got to taste them and obviously he loved them!!! (as did I)

I have made these cookies several times now - using the suggestions for BBs and additional chocolate chips - and they are a hit every time. They barely last half an hour in my office...or around my husband! I've found that using the mini-morsels instead of regular chocolate chips works great.

Using Butterfinger BBs in cookies is a great idea. I just think that this recipe falls short. I will try substituting BBs in a very good chocolate chip cookie recipe--I think this will give the cookies more body.

What a great twist on a classic cookie recipe. The cookies came out moist and chewy. I have a feeling they won't last very long.

I made gift plates of 4 cookies, this being one of them. I used actual Butterfinger bars, 2 huge ones and one regular size, sliced. I made it a bar cookie in a parchment lined 13x9 pyrex pan. I ended up cooking it for nearly 30 minutes at 350, after cutting off the edge pieces after 20 minutes. It seemed like the center wasn't cooked. They came out fine anyway. small little chewy squares. Very tasty. I'll make them again!

Very good! The candy melts and tastes almost like toffee. I tried the suggestion to add chocolate chips which worked very well...

These are best served within an hour from the oven. However, they're still soft & chewy the day after baking. The candy & dark brown sugar add a lot to the standard recipe.

These cookies were really good--a nice change from everyday chocolate chip. The candy pieces got quite hard after baking, but my husband and I are such butterfinger lovers, that we really didn't mind. Everyone has loved these.
