Everyone loved them, but I prefer another recipe that I had made in the past. The sauce was rather bland even with the addition of extra mint and garlic. The dolmades were tasty, but again, I felt that something was missing. Maybe I'm just used to the pre-made version at the supermarket.

These are always the first to go. The kids especially like them. I also cut out some of the olive oil and use vege broth for my vegetarian friends and family.

First time I ever made these, and thought they'd be more difficult than they were. I also cut way back on the olive oil, and didn't miss it. Part of a Greek-themed dinner party, and these were the first thing gone!

Mmmmmm....ham and hot fudge. Sounds great! Not quite as good as this recipe, but great just the same. FYI: "dolmades: From the arabic word for something stuffed" referring to grape leaves, vegetables or fruits stuffed with a savory, well-seasoned filling. Sounds to me like anything goes...

I have made this one several times over the years. I lightened it up by using half or less of the olive oil. I left out the cumin and the pine nuts (personal taste and couldn't find the nuts). If you drain the yogurt (put a coffee filter at the bottom of a small colinder and let it sit for an hour or so) it becomes much thicker and more dip like. This may take some time. But its worth it.

Very easy and very tasty and even better reheated a day or two later. I would recommend using yogurt from a Medditeranean market if you can find one. The consistency is much thicker than what you can find at the supermarket and tastes much better.

I agree with the reviewers who don't have a problem with the "authenticity" of the dish. It is wonderful as it is, a refreshing addition to an appetizer party or a great warm weather meal. I will definitely make again.

Who CARES whether this is authentic or not. The important thing is that this recipe is delicious beyond compare, and friends ASK me to make these! It's a bit of work, but worth it.

Not quite Greek, a bit Lebenese (the nuts), the extra ingredients that I wasn't used to seemed a bit Iranian, but overall quite good. I changed the chicken stock to veggie stock, but didn't seem to change it too much. And yes, it is generally served cold (as it is a rice dish), but they are good cold or warm, as are meat versions. My grandmother is Syrian and I have grown up with a different version of dolmas, but this version is the best meatless (excepting the chicken stock) I have eaten.

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipie as well as my company. Since I'm vegetarian meatless is always the case. I substituted the chicken broth for 3c vegetable broth and 1c white wine and then served cool (Uh oh! Not "authentic".) I also omitted the cumin as a personal preference and served with a lemon tahini sauce. I feel the other reviewers were way to harsh in judging the dish. So cultural diffusion played heavily into the meal. So what. The dolmades were a crowd pleaser and a wonderful appetizer.

I can't believe that people like the reviewer before me have to be so negative and insulting in their reviews. This dish may not be authentic, but I found it delicious, easy to make, and heart-smart. So to the cook from Toronto, try to make your reviews a little more constructive. Nobody learns from hearing someone go "Hated it, yada, yada, yada".

This is ridiculous, who ever heard of nuts and cumin,etc. in a "greek" dish like this. Nobody liked it and I won't do it again. Sorry!!

Who CARES whether this is Greek or Turkish, or violates the rule of meat/warm, no-meat/cold. It's easy to make my guests have loved it, and some actually go so far as to ask me to make it again.

A note on the last reviewer's comment. I've lived in Athens, Greece for 10 years and love to cook the local food. In my experience, meatless "dolmades" are served at room temperature with plain yogurt and "dolmades" with ground meat stuffing are usually served warm or occasionally at room temperature with egg and lemon sauce. And out of all the wonderful cooks in my husband's family, none of them puts cumin or currants or nuts in their dolmades. This sounds to me more like a Turkish or Arabic twist. The Greek foods are not as spicy and seldom mix fruit and nuts with meat or other savory foods.

This is the equivalent of serving baked ham with a hot fudge sauce! If made meatless as in this recipe, dolmas are served cold, accompanied by lemon wedges only. If made with meat, they are always served hot, accompanied by cool yogurt or a hot egg-lemon sauce. I don't know what this is.

These are some of the best dolmades I have ever made (or tasted). Rave reviews from a vegetarian friend I served them to. I also made some with cooked ground lamb, and these were wonderful too. The sauce was the perfect accompaniment.

I made these as an appetizer for a christmas party...and they went fast! I've tried a few dolmas recipes, and this has been the best so far...I left out the currants. The sauce was only so-so, but I used dried mint instead of fresh, which probably was a mistake.
