My ground cardamom was over the hill so I substituted ginger for that and lime zest for the orange. Then I glazed the cookies while they were still warm with icing sugar mixed with lime juice instead of milk. Think they needed more ginger but otherwise excellent. I do NOT think however that you can get by with less butter. And to solve the "rolling out" challenge, I formed the dough into logs, froze them for an hour or so and then sliced them like ice box cookies. In my oven, they baked in 10 minutes.

Completely agree with previous review. The dough was sticky and it took me until the third batch to get it right. Lots of extra flour to keep the rolling pin from sticking. I used plastic wrap to finish my rolling. The cookies are delicious and received rave reviews from expert cookie makers

Delicious flavorful cookies. After the third batch I got the hang of the cookie rolling and cutting. Make sure your dough is 45 minuets chilled. I have a wood counter and the dough was sticking so I put a layer of wax paper on the counter and then rolled quite quickly with both surfaces floured. Don't push too hard with your roller and roll in every direction in short, quick movements. Also don't try to make it too thin. If you follow this - the dough around the shapes comes right up and so do the cookies.

I just realized that there are two orange cardamom recipes on Epicurious that are incredibly similar, though one calls for 8 oz. of butter vs. this one that calls for 12 oz. I think 8 oz would have been better. I would also add more orange and cardamom. Having said that, it was a delicious butter cookie. I chilled the dough overnight and rolled it into small balls. I pressed the balls flat with a glass dipped in flour. So much easier than rolling! I liked these cookies without the added sugar.

Happy Holidays...I just finished making the Cardamon-Orange Sugar cookies and along the way I figured out how to handle the over sticky dough. Flour your surface then place the chilled dough on the flour. Take a piece of parchment paper and put it between your rolling pin and dough. Then start rolling away...Carefully pull the dough off the paper and your dough is ready to cookie cut. I also added more orange zest since we are all crazy about citron zest in our house. I used a whole orange. Then I used the orange to squeeze a bit of juice to add to the powder sugar for the glaze. I also baked the cookies around 8 minutes...Love these cookies..I

These sugar cookies are delicious, light, buttery and citrusy! After reading the reviews I made a few small adjustments, but nothing major. I doubled the amount of orange zest because I love the flavor, and added an extra pinch cardamom to balance it. I had a ton of extra zest at the end (always double check the amounts of each ingredient needed!) so I rubbed it into some sugar and used that to sprinkle on the tops right before they went into the oven. They're delicious! I didn't have the time to roll out the dough, so I took another reader's suggestion and formed the dough into two logs, wrapped it in plastic wrap and stuck it in the freezer like an icebox cookie. They sliced beautifully with a sharp knife, and were extremely easy to handle that way! Keep the dough as cold as possible when working with it; as soon as it warms up it does get sticky like other readers mentioned.

This is the first sugar cookie recipe I actually enjoyed the taste of. I used the zest of 1 orange, so probably more than 1-1/2 tsp. And used salted butter (didn't read the recipe close enough before I went shopping). Dough was quite sticky, so I rolled it out between 2 floured sheets of waxed paper, which made it manageable. Also learned after the first batch to not roll them too thin (if they are thicker they are easier to cut out and move to the cookie sheet).

These were delicious. I usually cook recipes exactly as written the first time but after reading all the reviews about people having trouble with too-soft dough, I deviated a little. I omitted one stick of butter. Dough was perfect and they baked up to perfection. I also made one day ahead just throwing the dough in the fridge after mixing and letting sit overnight. Then, just roll out and cut. Could maybe use a little more zest?? I also added some orange extract. Would make again.

This is a great change from the ordinary flavours of ye olde sugar cookie. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. I did find that the cookie dough is very very soft and so I followed other reviewers' instructions and kept putting it in the fridge between batches. I also had to keep washing my cookie cutters every so often as the dough tended to stick to them even with a liberal coating of flour. Flouring your board and pin is the key.

These cookies are amazing and everyone always wants the recipe. To kick up the orange flavor I frost them with a glaze made from powdered sugar, fresh squeezed orange juice, and orange zest, using a plastic baggie as a piping bag to drizzle the glaze over them. I didn't find the dough difficult to work with at all, as long as I flour the board and my rolling pin.

This is the second time I've made these, and they are a hit. I had no trouble handling the dough. I chilled it for 15 minutes in the freezer, then 45 mins for the second chilling , + used enough flour for the rolling and did that on parchment, picking up the dough and turning it frequently. The dough also took the cutters beautifully. You do have to work fairly quickly, because the dough does soften rapidly once you start working with it. I agree with others, though, that a little more orange would be nice. The cardamom and orange are a great variation--much more interesting than the usual bland sugar cookie.

These cookies are a nice change from the traditional sugar cookie, and are a crowd pleaser. To give the cookies a little extra orange flavor, we mixed orange zest with the raw sugar and sprinkled on top of the cookies.

These cookies were the hit of the evening. I doubled the orange used, and since I produced them for a parting treat for guests, partitioning dough for about 8 cookies on parchment for each. I only waited the hour before flattening, then refrigerated again for the day with the parchments stacked. I cut the cookies with a knife without rolling out so the end result was more like shortbread. Excellent!

I think these have the potential to be 4 stars which is why I gave them 4. However, they tasted salty to me. I don't know if anyone else had that problem or not! I could have added too much salt as I was yapping to my brother while I was making these, or they might have too much to begin with. I'll definitely try them again as I loved the spicy cardamom, and the freshness of the citrus!

These were delicious sugar cookies... but honestly they were a pain to make and did not taste very much like either cardamom or orange. The dough was extremely sticky and required being put into the freezer and fridge several times in order to keep it a roll-able cut-able consistency.

I made the dough the night before baking and refrigerated; I thought it was easy to roll out. The cardamom smell was strong in the uncooked dough, but not overwhelming at all in the finished cookie. I thought the orange, cardamom, and butter flavors were very well balanced.

I just was not a fan of these cookies. I went easy on the cardamom (1 t) and I still feel that's all I taste. I went a litle heavier on the orange zest (2 t) and I barely taste the orange. I too thought the dough was hard to work with and finally gave up for the last two dozen and took the advice of another reviewer and rolled the dough into a log and cut off slices. I also think this is not a sugar cookie recipe but more of a butter cookie. To me, sugar cookies have a softer texture and this is a rich butter cookie, more on the crisp side. They will be a good with a cup of tea. But I will not be adding this recipe to my recipe box. I do recommend the triple ginger cookies from the same bon appetit issue.

I love this recipe! Huge hit with guests and when I brought as a dish to a party. The dough must be refigerated after it is rolled out- just like the recipe says do. Fragrant, buttery and deeelish. FYI: I drizzled mine with orange glaze!! Even better.just confectioners' sugar and a few TBL. fresh OJ.

I had no trouble with the dough being too sticky. These were a big hit with friends and many asked for the recipe. I did bake mine one sheet at a time on the center oven rack for 15 minutes. Very buttery and shortbread-like. Yum!

I made these cookies according to the recipe and didn't have any trouble whatsoever. My dough was not too soft or sticky at all. Everyone who has tried these has absolutely loved them ... they are very shortbread-like and have an excellent butter flavor. The orange and cardamom is subtle and surprising. I would recommend these with no changes.

As others noted, dough is so soft it's almost impossible to work with. I wound up keeping it in the fridge overnight, then cutting it into sections, rolling those out, then freezing the flattened dough, then cutting them. All very labor intensive. They do cook up fast, at 1/8 inch thick 16 minutes is too much, more like 13 to 14. I personally like sugar cookies a bit more done as they crisp up nicely that way. I liked the flavor of the cardamom and orange, but found it a bit heavy. Mixed reviews from guests that tried it - some loved it, others wish it had been just orange. I did a second batch (with what I learned from the first) without the cardamom and everyone like them better.

I do not think this is a successful recipe in regards to the cookie part (the dough is too soft to work with) but the orange and cardamom flavors are inspiring. I now make my great grandmother's sugar cookie recipe and add the orange and cardamom. Less butter and flour and super yummy!

What was I thinking by baking these for 16 minutes? Only 6 out of two full large cookie sheets weren't over-baked. After I turned the sheets around in the oven at 8 minutes I should've been watching them like a hawk. But no. What a waste. I do plan on making these again and being on top of the time. The dough smells wonderful and worth trying again. The scraps were almost impossible to work with after chilling again, very sticky.

These cookies are tasty. The dough is very sticky to roll out even after chilling and rolling between parchment. Instead, make a log, cut and shape each cookie by hand and add flour as needed. The cooking time needs reducing to appoximately 10 - 12 minutes otherwise the outer edge of the cookies browns too much.

Rating: 0
The cookies are excellent; however, if I make them again I would add more orange zest and cardamom - I can barely taste the orange. I also thought the baking time was too long. I gradually reduced it for each batch and ended up with beautiful cookies after 10-12 minutes.

These cookies are great--but they definitely need some more time in the fridge and less time to bake than called for--more like 8 minutes. Also, I added 2 tsp orange juice, a tsp of orange essence and a extra cardamom. They have a great flavor, but BOY is there a lot of butter!

I had the same bad experience with these cookies. I thought I had done something wrong as well. Even putting the dough in the freezer didn't work.

I tried making these and the dough was too moist. I followed the recipe except for adding a bit more cardamom and orange zest. Does anyone know what I did wrong?

These cookies are amazing! We made them into snowflake shapes with an amazing cookie cutter I found. They are beautiful and the orange is a nice twist on traditional sugar cookies. The Cardamom wasn't as strong a flavor as I thought. Very good.
