Super delicious, and super messy to eat. These seemed a lot of work, but having never made this before, perhaps I should have expected it. My boyfriend loved it and he's a meat lover. It was very satisfying and, again, delicious, but just messy and time consuming for the ultimate end.

I thought this recipe was great but my husband found it a bit too greasy, so next time I think I'll try baking the eggplant or at least frying it in less oil. It's a good way to use up leftover tomato sauce.

I used Egg Beaters instead of the five eggs indicated. This is a delicious hero sandwich - a lot of work, but worth it.

I used this recipe just as a refresher on cutting and breading and frying the eggplants. It was great, but there is one problem. The recipe calls for WAY too much flour, breadcrumb/parmesan mixture and eggs. I only used four eggs, and one cup flour and had a lot leftover for each. I cut down on the parm/breadcrumb mixture too and had lots leftover on that. This is the most annoying because parmesan is so expensive. i suggest setting out a third of each. you can always add more if you have to.

I made this for me and my husband last night, using just a small eggplant. I cut down on the prep time by using my favorite brand of prepared pasta sauce. however, i roasted a red pepper, diced, and added to the sauce - which was really good, and skipped the onions. I also brushed the bread with garlic butter since i didn't add any to the sauce. when i baked them, i put the mozzarella on the open top sides, and a layer of sauce topped with the eggplants on the other side, and baked all at once, that way the eggplants stayed crispy until you put the sandwich together on the plate. delicious!

I made it with the frozen breaded eggplant slices from Trader Joe's and it was simply delicious and sooooo easy!

Frying is always messy but I loved this recipe. I used my mother's old way of frying eggplant - flour, egg wash then fine saltine cracker crumbs. Sauce was simple and light. No need for herbs because eggplant has special flavor. I completely left out the parmesan but made sure I had plenty of mozzarella on top. We are not vegetarians but this recipe was very filling. My husband took 1/2 sandwiches to work for 2 days. Thank you for the freezing tip.

This takes too long to make for dinner on a weeknight, but it's a nice idea for company on weekends. Delicious, though.

We love eggplant parmesan and cook it about once a month but like other viewers, I agree how time consuming it is. Thanks to the cook from Long Island on enlightining me on freezing eggplant! I bake my eggplant with only a little bit of olive oil then assemble the parmesan. Can I freeze the baked eggplant before assembling it? Thanks.

Too much work just to make a hero. Will stick to the old fashoned, simple methods. I have started using the oriental,long,slender,purple,eggplants. They are less seedy and less bitter.

Tried 5 times (after discovering you had reversed the 2 parmesan recipes) but still cannot get recipe to print properly. Other sites print just fine. Emily (gcollines@vt.edu)

A couple of friendly tips: -5 eggs for one eggplant is way too much, a one egg eggwash preparation (w/milk or water) is enough (maybe two eggs depending on how thick you slice the eggplant) -use olive oil for frying, it adds great flavour -use a food mill for the tomatoes -use canned tomatoes imported from Italy, they are generally vine-ripened and much sweeter

This is too long just for sandwiches. Go ahead and just make Eggplant Parmigano the regular way you like as part of a dinner course and use the leftovers for the sandwich bit....and don't go through all this trouble with only one eggplant.... make several......it freezes very well. Hardly ever have leftovers. Family loves this so make 4 or more eggplant at a time especially if you have an over productive summer garden. Make lots of sauce which keeps well in the frig or buy your favorite brand.

It's a mess and it's time consuming so when I do eggplant parm I do 6 or 8 at a time and freeze the cooked slices for future use. This recipe while good is a lot for a couple lousy sandwiches. When the homegrown eggplant start coming in in the yard I'm doing it weekly. Sometimes I bake, sometimes fry but take from both when I use them. Gotta have a little oil!

I made some changes to this recipe. I added Italian blend spices to the egg mixuture. Also, I did not fry the eggplant. I lightly greased a a jelly roll pan and baked in a hot oven (400) until lightly brown. I flipped the eggplant over during half time. Takes about 20 minutes then I baked according to directions uncovered. tlyffparsely, grli
