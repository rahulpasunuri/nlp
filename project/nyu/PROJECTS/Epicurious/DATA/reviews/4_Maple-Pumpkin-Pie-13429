to allison27 - I no longer bother boiling the maple syrup to soft ball stage. It didn't make a difference in my pies. I boil slightly and then let it cool. Cooling is important because if it is added hot it may pre-cook the eggs and affect the texture.

I love this recipe, but every time I make it the maple syrup seizes when I add it to the pumpkin mixture and I end up putting the whole thing over a double boiler. Has this happened to anyone else? I used Grade A syrup and maybe I'll just skip that boiling step next time. Not sure what it adds besides a headache.

My favorite pumpkin pie recipe - everyone loves it! I've been baking it for years now. I double the spices and add 1/4t cloves. I found the amount of heavy cream too much - the pie wouldn't solidify as much as I like. So I prefer slightly decreasing the liquid added and using these proportions: 7 ounces milk and 4 ounces heavy cream. It totals about 1 1/3C, which is plenty. I also bake for 70 minutes instead of 60. It works beautifully with either fresh pumpkin or canned. I've tried both grade B and grade A maple syrup and I have to say the grade B results in a much richer taste. No question the maple syrup is the secret of this pie's success.

This pie was marvelous! The caramel flavors combined with the pumpkin make for a terrific variation on the traditional pumpkin pie. I also like that this recipe is not heavily spiced - I don't like clove or too much nutmeg in pumpkin pie. I made two alterations to this recipe: I used a real pumpkin instead of canned, and I used the "best-ever pie crust" recipe instead of the one suggestion, which I think is superior. Highly recommend this recipe, for a pumpkin pie that is not 100% traditional, but very good.

I couldn't find grade B syrup, so I tried to follow the maple syrup instructions using grade A, but it didn't work. Therefore, I instead just whisked 1 cup of Grade A directly (no boiling step) into the filling and the pie still came out great.

oh...forgot to say that I used fresh pumpkin from a cinderella pumpkin grown by a local farmer. it made it much lighter than canned pumpkin.

This pie was great! I also used the gingerpecan crust from the Pumkpkin Chiffon recipe. The maple syrup really adds an element that for all these years the traditional pumpkin pies havevbeen missing. I will always make this in the future when needing a pumpkin pie.

I have made this recipe for at least 8 years I decided to try the suggestion by another reviewer for the gingersnap crust from the pumpkin chiffon pie on this site. I had a little trouble with it in my deep dish pan (nothing a little tweaking won't fix) but the flavor is awesome. This pie is strong in spice and the gingersnaps and pecans pair with it harmoniously. I have never really been a fan of the crust recomended with this recipe anyway.

much too sweet, even with over double the spices.

I used the Best Ever Pie Crust recipe and substituted baked squash for the pumpkin. It was easy to make and the maple complemented the squash beautifully.

This is now my standard pumpkin pie recipe. I love it, though I don't think anyone else I made it for appreciated it to the same degree. (I am a big maple fan.) One of these days I'll try the gingersnap crust recommended by a reviewer, but for now, the lazy pre-made pillsbury crust is fine for me.

Everyone loved this! The maple syrup was subtle but made the difference. Even better the next day...will definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I used Pillsbury pie crust. (I even opened a 2nd can of pumpkin to get the 2 cups.) I made this pie and the pie off of the Libby's Pumpkin can. My initial reaction was that there was very little difference between the two. My sister-in-law preferred the Libby's back of can version. HOWEVER, the next day, I did decide I preferred the Maple Pumpkin Pie; I liked the undertone of the syrup and the texture, but thought it could use more spices. I plan to make it again, but next time I'll use the amounts of spices called for in the Libby's version.

This pie had a great flavor. I cooked it longer by 10 minutes and it still came out a little runny, but my guests still liked it better than the traditional more solid pumpkin pie I made.

I made this pumpkin pie last Thanksgiving and I got rave reviews on it. My mother, who does not like pumpkin pie, loved it - since it had the maple syrup in it, it really made it a different kind of flavor which she really liked. I'm making it again this year!

This is hands down the best pumpkin pie I've ever had. The grade B maple syrup definitely makes the filling. This pie doesn't last more than a day in my house!

I use evaporated milk instead of the cream, and the gingersnap crust from the pumpkin chiffon recipe on here. I can't even begin to describe the level of good the gingersnap crust takes it to.

THE best pumpkin pie! The syrup adds a wonderful depth.Took a bit longer in the oven (about 15 minutes more). My guests claimed it was the best pumpkin pie they had ever had!

OK, if you're looking for some RAVE reviews, here it is. Especially if your family likes the traditional Thanksgiving pies, here's a way to add a whole new twist. The secret ingredient is, of course, the maple, and it's wonderful. Silky, smooth, everyone went beserk for this pie. Go for it, it's easy

I really liked this recipe, although it didn't come out as firm as other pumpkin pies I've made. Maybe this was due to not heating the maple syrup to the soft ball stage? The flavor is excellent.

This is a wonderful pie. It has a far richer and deeper flavor than any pumpkin pie I've ever tasted. It took me a while to find the Grade B maple syrup, but I eventually did find it in a "higher end" store in my area. Now, whenever I want a pumpkin pie, I think this will be the one I make. Truly exceptional!

Rating: 4
this is an unusual recipe - the grade b maple syrup makes such a deep but subtle caramel flavor that other pies simply don't have. don't let the "candy-making" part of the heating the maple syrup deter you - i think there's alot of room for error as long as it doesn't reach Char Stage! i should add that i substituted soy cream and milk to increase tolerance, and it came out pretty creamy and dense textured anyways. i've given out the recipe and those who made it raved about it as well.

Fantastic! Easy, though not quick (I forgot how long it takes to bring syrup to 240). I did cook the syrup to the actual soft ball stage-240, not 210, and had no problems incorporating it into the rest of the recipe. The maple flavor is subtle, but the overall taste of this pie is fantastic.

I've made this several times, always to rave reviews. I don't whisk the filling, though--I always put it in a blender (I use fresh pumpkin, not canned, so it's not as pureed to begin with) and that whips more air into the cream as well. I also jettisoned their pie crust: instead, I used 1 1/4 c flour, 1 1/2 tsp sugar, 1 tsp salt, 5 tblsp butter and 3 tablsp crisco, and the results were outstanding. I didn't bother with the maple leaves after the first 2 or 3 pies--too much trouble for no real payoff. Be sure to use a LARGE saucepan for boiling the maple syrup--it will boil over otherwise! I don't tend to take it all the way soft ball--I usually include it at the "starting to solidify" stage. I once overboiled it, which made it incredibly thick and difficult to work with, but again, using the blender on the filling came to the rescue.

Pumpkin pie is my favorite, and this recipe is a winner. I just made it last night and plan to re-make it this weekend! As for the maple syrup I wasn't able to get it to form balls once dropped in water, I just added it after it had been boiling for a while, still tasted great. The maple syrup gives a molasses-like sweetness. I doubled the spice measurements, to my taste, and it was perfect. Texture also came out well.

This pie is fantastic! Just the right amount of maple syrup...found Grade B easily in supermarket. Will make again for Christmas.

As stated by a previous reviewer, yes, soft-ball stage for candy is 240 but do not, I repeat, DO NOT exceed the 210 that the recipe calls for or else the syrup will "seize-up" and be difficult (although not impossible) to mix with the pumpkin mixture. It did eventually dissolve with prolonged mixing. But be forwarned! Otherwise a delicious pie with a wonderful carmelized sweetness. Will increase the spices next time and use a different pie crust recipe.

Wow - The subtle maple flavor is fantastic! I used grade A maple syrup because that's what I had, and a 15oz. can of pumpkin as others noted without problems. I also cooked it an extra 5 min so it was firmer - browned slighty in the center but tastes great. I will be making this one again and again!

Soft-stage maple syrup added wonderful depth to filling flavor. Found the crust made from the given recipe too tough. Suggest substituting Crisco for half of the butter. Next time will use my old (45 year) reliable, tender family pastry recipe. Filling is first rate.

Everyone is right! The pie is fantastic. Grade B maple syrup is pure magic. The lack of nutmeg in the filling is very refreshing. I made mine in a cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg crust. Even my pumpkin pie-hating friend had two servings. Definitely make extras!

very yummy, indeed. my filling came out a little too soft...more of a custard...and i would guess this is because i used 1% milk instead of whole. i didn't really think about it, it was just what i had in the fridge. can someone confirm whether this is the cause or not? the only other thing i did was use 15 oz of pumpkin instead of 16 oz. still, the taste was awesome!

Wow, this pumpkin pie is delicious!! However, I wonder why it is necessary to heat the maple syrup to the soft ball stage. what would happen if the maple syrup is added without being heated to soft ball stage first? I would appreciate if someone could answer my questions.

O.K. I did substitute a couple of things here, but this pie honestly was the best pumpkin pie I or anyone who had had it, had had. You can't move after eating one slice, but it is so wonderful!

What a fantastic pumpkin pie!! The hint of maple just adds to the wonderful taste. I did use a different crust (try it with the cream cheese crust, it's out of this world) and I will definitely make it again.

Best pumpkin maple pie I've made, but yes, the soft ball stage is 235 to 240 degrees, not 210. This one is now our official Thanksgiving dessert.

Rating: 3
I make this recipe every Thanksgiving now. However, The 210 degrees for heating the syrup is incorrect - and this is crucial for the recipe. It should read 240! - which is the soft-ball stage on a candy thermometer. Otherwise, a great recipe & forgiving of measurement changes - such as a 15 oz. can of Pumpkin instead of 2 cups (16 oz.), etc.
