Outstanding!! Well worth the effort. Thanks to the reviewer before , I used a 2 cup tin of french chestnut puree (plus vanilla) with a two quart container of vanilla ice cream and refroze it in a glass bowl with the surface covered with saran wrap and an extra layer of saran wrap on top of the bowl. I made this two days before I needed it and made the sauce about 2 hours earlier than when I needed it. I reheated the sauce on a simmer and ladeled it on the ice cream to serve. My husband said he was glad he married me after tasting the first bite and my guests just oohed and aahed.

I had'nt had this high amount of calories on a spoon in my life! But it's absolutely worth it :-] I made the candied chestnuts myself. Just take roasted and peeled chestnuts, sugar and water at the rate of 1:1/2:1/4 cup. Cook a syrup with sugar and water and drizzel it on the chopped warm nuts while stirring. Really heavenly!!!

Gorgeous - there's some sort of fantastic natural affinity between marrons glaces and chocolate! When pressed for time, I've also done a super quick & dirty version of these flavors, using a tin of sweet french chestnut puree, whipped cream and shaved dark chocolate. Heavenly!
