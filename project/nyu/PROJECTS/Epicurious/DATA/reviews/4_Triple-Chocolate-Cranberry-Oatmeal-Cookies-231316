This has become my fall oatmeal cookie. I think the greasiness is minimized by using only 1 stick of butter. I substitute chopped, dried cranberries that are as moist as raisins for the fresh or frozen recommended. And I use only white chocolate chips and nix the chocolate drizzle. For me, they are perfect!

LOVE these cookies! I've made them 5-6 times, each time tweaking a bit to my taste. I've cut the butter back to 8 tbsp because 10 left a greasy film on the bottom of the cookies. I also use just 1 cup of chips (usually all white rather than a mixture). 1.5 cups was way too much for the amount of batter. I also love dried cranberries in this cookie for the chew. Next time, I'll probably cut the white sugar back to a 1/4 cup to see if I can keep the texture of the cookies and lighten up on the sweetness (which can be tooth-achingly sweet if you eat more than one cookie, which of course I do!).

Some of the best cookies I've ever made. The only adjustment I make sometimes is to reduce the sugar by an 1/8 of a cup - the white chocolate and milk chocolate combine to make a super sweet cookie.

Excellent cookie! Made these for a cookie exchange, and they were the hands down favorite. Like many reviews here, I added lots of extra cranberries, but you could also add other dried fruit for a variation.

This is my go-to cookie recipe. I typically just use regular chocolate chips and dried cranberries, and do not have time for the drizzle icing. You can also cut back to 1 stick of butter to avoid a flat cookie. My 4 year old loves them!

These made flat, crispy cookies, even when I put the dough in the refrigerator to help them set up. I would have liked something softer and chewier.

After all the rave reviews, I think my expectations were set high. I thought these cookies were okay -- nothing spectacular. They sound great with the combination of tart cranberries and different chocolates, but I was not over-the-moon with the finished product. With all the other holiday cookie recipes out there, I think I will take a pass on this one next time.

These were not as tasty as I hoped they would be nor as attractive as the picture. Unfortunately, they didn't make the cut for the Christmas cookie platter. I did freeze them before cooking as suggested by other reviewers.

Rating: 4
Simple and delicious! The tart cherries are a great contrast to the sweet chips. I used Ghiradelli chips - our favorite - with great results. I threw frozen whole cranberries in the food processor for very coarsely (and unevenly) chopped berries, which were fine. The dough was not very sticky; I found myself squeezing it into balls rather than just scooping it. Because I wanted to stack and ship my cookies, I did not use the glaze, and did not miss it.

These cookies are easy to make and delicious. I make a big batch, freeze the dough balls, and bake them as needed.

This is the very best cookie recipe ever. I never make only one batch--it's now everyone in my family's favourite. I usually benefit from wild cranberries from Baie Comeau, Quebec...they are tiny and don't need to be chopped. I usually skip the white chocolate drizzle...they are good just plain.

Rating: 3
This was a great recipe, and SO easy! I totally stuck to the recipe for the main part of the cookie (flour, sugar, oats, vanilla, cinnamon, etc), but changed a little with the added bits. I did 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips, 1/4 cup white chocolate, 1/4 semi-sweet chocolate, and 1/2 cup walnuts... along with the 1/2 cup cranberries. I tried to drizzle the white chocolate on the top, but it wouldn't stay melted long enough and made them look ugly, so I gave up. I think next time I'll cut down on the sugar, add more oats and cinnamon, cut down 1/4 cup chocolate, and add more nuts and cranberries. My husband thinks maybe we should try nutmeg also. They are delicious just a bit too sweet for my taste. I like my oatmeal cookies to be less sweet and more spicy. The basics are here though! Now it's just a matter of tweaking to perfection!

Rating: 4
I can't stop making (and eating) these cookies. I've made two batches in the past three days! I don't know if anyone else had this problem but I was unable to drizzle the white chocolate as shown in the photo with a spoon. Instead, I found that melting white chocolate and piping it out of a Ziploc bag with a corner cut off was the way to go. Overall, fantastic cookie, very festive for the winter holiday season. Yay cookies!

Um...I mean- it is an oatmeal cookie. Given all the raves I thought perhaps maybe there is some magic here. But there isn't. It is a perfectly fine oatmeal cookie with chocolate and cranberries. If you can imagine a decent oatmeal cookie with chocolate and cranberries, then you know exactly how these taste. Is it the most awesome cookie...? No.

Rating: 3
Wow an excellent oatmeal cookie - finally! I have had a hard time finding a recipe that I enjoyed - this is it!!!! I doubled the recipe for starters as I was making some for a friend. I omitted the drizzle as it seemed like more than enough chocolate for one cookie. I used only semisweet chocolate chips as that is all I had. Delicious! Maybe even a 4 star!!! The kids loved them.

Rating: 4
My kids usually hate oatmeal cookies, but they LOVED these! The fresh cranberries make them really different. My only changes were to use 1 cup frozen cranberries (cut them each in half), all semi-sweet choc chips, and refrigerated the dough before baking. Best oatmeal cookies ever!

Such a great cookie! Rainy afternoon, so must bake. I was using up supplies I already had on hand, so instead of all cranberries, I used a dried berry mix of cranberries, cherries and blueberries. Next time, I will increase the amount of fruit by about a quarter cup. I used only dark chocolate chips since that was what I had on hand. Really, really good.

Unbelievably awesome cookie. I didn't do the drizzle, because come on, enough is enough already with this cookie. Loaded up with chocolate chips, great tangyness from the craberries, just a really great cookie recipe here.

I will start off by saying I did make a few changes, My local grocery store did not have fresh OR frozen cranberries, so I subbed unsweetened tart cherries (which I doubled). I also replaced the milk chocolate chips with pecans, doubled the cinnamon, and replaced the extra 1/4 stick of butter with about 2tbs of shortening. These cookies were incredible, they were delicious the day I made them, but what is even better is that they actually got BETTER after a few days. I layered them in zip-lock bags separated by parchment and instead of going stale and hard like most cookies, they just kept getting chewier and better :D I have made several batches and everyone who has tried them loved them. I have also frozen the dough for later use and they come out just as good. Highly recommended,I do not give out a 4 fork rating lightly. As a note: These cookies spread A LOT, so be sure to give them plenty of room on the pan

Rating: 3
I mostly followed the recipe and these got rave reviews. I mixed dried and fresh cranberries as I had some to use up, replaced all the chocolate chips with semisweet and white chocolate chunks and didn't bother drizzling choc after. I didn't measure the cranberries, but I'd say I put in more than 1/2 cup, as per the previous suggestions. I also refrigerated the dough before baking, easy and satisfying; the cranberries balance the sweetness of the chocolates nicely. While I wouldn't say they were greasy as one person said, I'd wager that the butter could indeed be cut down if one wanted.

Made these cookies to go in holiday treat baskets that I give to friends. Had to make another batch to keep for myself. Incredibly satisfying - tart berries with dark chocolate, not overpoweringly sweet. I have a new favorite cookie.

Rating: 4
Been making for years and have decided this method is best: 1 cup of cranberries, all dark chocolate, no drizzle on top and most of all, FREEZE DOUGH BEFORE COOKING, slice frozen dough, then quarter. Freezing seems to enhance cranberry taste and help crisp.

Rating: 4
These cookies were so easy to make and were wonderful right out of the oven! I loved the cranberries in them, so the second time I made them, I added an extra quarter cup of cranberries. Also, I left out the white chocolate because I don't care for it. I had to make them twice because my family would not stop eating them all... by the end of the first day, I only had nine left! So I froze these nine and, tonight, made some more and froze them! I think this speaks for itself!

Rating: 2
Considering the rave reviews (and blue ribbon), this recipe was a disappointment. I made it twice just to give it a chance. The proportion of butter to flour/oats is way too much. The second time I made it I used only 1 stick butter, increased the cranberries to 1 cup, and increased the oats by 1/4 cup. I think I could have added another 1/4 cup oats, because the cookies were still kind of greasy. For my money, you're better off making your favorite oatmeal cookies and adding chocolate and cranberries. And don't forget the nuts, I don't see how a Christmas cookie recipe can have no nuts.

Rating: 4
I'm a horrible baker but was invited to participate in a cookie contest at work so I broke out the scale, converted the flour and butter volume measurements to weight, and made these exactly as written. They were fantastic - sweet with a touch of tart from the fresh cranberries... so much so that I improved my previous last place finish to take the "master baker" title.

Rating: 3
These are OK. I'm not as impressed as previous reviews. I did make an error in the butter but it should not have made that much of a difference. I used salted instead of unsalted. I read through it too quickly. I did not add white choc. to the recipe but drizzled on the top after cooling. Also again I didn't pay attention - I baked 2 pans at a time - that is why it took about 7 min longer to cook. My bad. I doubled the cinnamon as suggested. I added a bit more choc chips of the semi-sweet to make up for not adding white chips. I also boosted the cranberries a bit more, also as reviewed. Also, didn't care for the texture. I think I'll try the cranberries in a toll-house choc. chip type recipe though. Good recipe, not great.

Rating: 4
Yummy cookie. I took the suggestions of previous reviewers and doubled the cranberries and omitted the white choc. chips in the batter. I also used only a half cup of semi sweet choc. chips. They turned out perfect.

I made these yummy cookies last year. This year they seemed flatter than I recall, but the flavor was still delicious. I will double the cranberries next time as other reviewers have suggested. Also, it is hard to keep the melted chocolate at a consistency for glazing. I have a recipe for chocolate glaze that would work much better (Combine 6 ounces semi-sweet chocolate chips, 3 tablespoons hot water, 1 tablespoon butter, and 3 tablespoons corn syrup in a microwave-safe dish, cover with plastic wrap, microwave for 2 minutes, whisk until smooth and drizzle) that I will try next time. Still the best holiday cookie ever!

Rating: 4
A yummy cookie that has crunch and softness. I can't get cranberries around here so I "substituted" a cup of toasted macadamia nuts. I left out the semi-sweet and milk chocolate and substituted one cup of white chocolate chunks. I also reduced the white sugar by almost half. Will definitely make these again.

I would have given these four forks for the taste, but I was a little disappointed that the cookies spread so much and came out thinner than I'd hoped. I made sure the pans were cooled when I put the dough on them and I even chilled the dough in the fridge after scooping onto the pan. That being said, the cookies were delicious. I made a few small adjustments: As suggested by other reviewers, I mixed just the milk chocolate and semi-sweet chips into the dough and just drizzled with the white after they'd cooled. I also doubled the amount of fresh cranberries; the tartness offers a wonderful counterpoint to the sweetness of all the chocolate. A good cookie!

This is, quite simply, the best cookie recipe ever. I have cooked them for a variety of functions and they upstage everything else on the table! I cut each of the chocolate chips down to a 1/3 cup as I feel it gets a little too chocolately (didn't know there was such a thing!) and overwhelms the cranberries. They are also great dropped onto the cookie sheet in little one inch balls and made snack size for parties.

Everyone loved these cookies, they disappeared instantly at a party. I did make a change, after reading reviews I halved the sugar. My American friends said they were "healthy and oaty" and my European friends said they were "very sweet"! Next time I think I'll try just white chocolate with an increased quantity of cranberries.

Rating: 3
I just used bittersweet chocolate chips, because that's what I keep in the house. They were a great combo with the cranberries. I doubled the cranberries (fresh) which were my favorite part. I feel like there was a lot of chocolate for the amount of dough though... next time I would probably decrease the chocolate. I would also up the cinnamon maybe 50%.

Rating: 4
WOW very good! They have everything you love in a traditional oatmeal cookie, chewiness, spiciness, and that caramelly sweetness but with a little extra holiday flair. I didn't have problems with them being too crisp (other viewers might've baked them too long) The white chocolate and red cranberries look so pretty! I used the craisins instead of fresh cranberries and left out all the chocolate chips except for the white chocolate drizzle. They were plenty sweet and I think all that chocolate might've been overkill (although I know I would've devoured them anyway, who am I kidding). They're super easy, super pretty, and super delicious! What more could you ask for in a cookie?

Rating: 4
This cookie was amazing! Many other reviewers suggested to add more flour because the cookies came out too thin. I found that adding about 1/4 cup flour did the trick. Also, I didn't bother using the milk chocolate chips, the other 2 types were plenty, however, I did double the amount of cinnamon. Oh and most importantly, I only baked this cookie for 12 minutes, any longer and the bottom would have been brown.

Can't say I loved these. The cookies were too thin for my liking. I made nice scoops but as soon as they started baking they thinned out and overlapped onto each other. I also found them too crunchy but that's a personal preference. I put cranberries and semi-sweet chocolate chips which is a nice combo.

These cookies are unbelievably good. I was looking for an oatmeal raisin cookie recipe and am so glad I tried this one. I substituted raisins for the cranberries and did not use the white chocolate drizzle. The base recipe is so good and could be made with various combos (like chopped walnuts, just chocolate chips, etc.). Definitely my go-to cookie recipe from now on!

I LOVE these, and make them every year around Christmas! I don't bother with the white chocolate drizzle on top because mine never looks very pretty, and white chocolate is a little too sweet for my taste. I'm also liberal with the cranberries, I love the tartness of fresh cranberries...that is what really makes this recipe special.

Rating: 3
Very good. I used dried cranberries & the cookies turn out well. My only complaint is that the white chocolate chips didn't melt very well. Of course this has nothing to do with the recipe but with the quality of the white chocolate. Suggesting a brand of white chocolate would have been ideal.

Rating: 4
These cookies were absolutely delicious. They're by far my new, favorite Christmas cookie. I accidentally forgot to get the semi-sweet chocolate chips from the grocery store, so I simply substituted 1/4 of a cup of white and milk chocolate, respectively. After trying the first batch (which seemed to get even better over the next few days), I decided to make three more batches for friends. This is definitely a recipe that I'll be using for future holidays.

Toronto: I chopped the white chocolate, put it in a small ziploc and set it on my warm oven. When the cookies were ready to be iced and chocolate was melted, I snipped a tiny hole in the corner of the ziploc and squeezed. Super easy and no mess.

I made to the exact recipe and it produced thin cookies that spread all over the pan. My friend made with extra flour and the result was perfect. I used fresh cranberries--made all the difference. I used white, milk, and dark chips, and I drizzled with white and dark. I melted the chips inside small ziplock bags (in hot water) and snipped the end (barely) for my drizzle technique. I will make again and use more flour. Three forks because they tasted great but were too thin.

Rating: 4
These are great cookies. The cranberries really cut the sweetness. One problem: how did you all get the thin drizzle of chocolate at the end (as in the picture)? I tried with a spoon, a fork, etc. but all I could get were clumps of chocolate to fall on top of the cookies.

Made these for a Christmas cookie exchange and won the prize for best tasting cookie! I am not usually a fan of white chocolate so I made sure to use a good quality white chocolate bar. They were fabulous. The combination of the tart cranberries and the sweet white chocolate is perfect. I did drizzle white and dark chocolate on top which makes them look like something straight from a bakery!

This is a great recipe! I have made it a couple of times and always get requests to make more. I used fresh cranberries (if you want to remove the seeds, you can dunk the cut up cranberries in a big bowl of water - the cranberries float and the seeds don't), and I used Ghirardelli chocolate chips. The chocolate chips were a little too big so I chopped them up. I also did not have any parchment paper, so i just lined my cookie sheet with tin foil and kept a close eye on them. These cookies are veeeeerrrrrrrry thin in batter form - they spread a lot when you scoop them out (not so much when you cook them). I did not drizzle the chocolate on top, as these cookies really do not need them. I did do a sample size of ten cookies with the white chocolate drizzle, and, while pretty, it made the cookies extremely heavy. I would try maybe using a simple white icing for the drizzle if you really want that look, but these cookies are excellent as is, without garnish.

Liked this recipe. Followed previous suggestions and cut back on the milk and white chocolate in the cookie, as not to make cookie too sweet. I used fresh cranberries and wish I hadn't chopped them so finely. Didn't realize how festive the cookies appear until I added white chocolate drizzle.

As usual, I should have read the reviews first to see how to modify the recipe! I made them as directed, except that I used 3/4 cup white chocolate chips and 3/4 cup dark chocolate chips. I didn't spread any chocolate on top because there is already enough and it does overpower the cranberries, so next time I'll cut back on the choc chips. But really... there are worse problems than too much chocolate in your cookies! They're still fabulous. Dipped in milk they're downright heavenly.

These were pretty good, but man oh man were they sweet. I substituted dried cranberries for the fresh/frozen cranberries and that is what definitely saved the cookies - the tartness of the cranberries balanced the overly sweet mixture of chocolate chips and sugar. I also substituted apple sauce for the butter to try to make them healthier, but I think next time I'll probably take the substitutions a bit farther by replacing the milk chocolate chips with dates or perhaps figs. Overall I think these were pretty good and I'd make them again.

I used dried cranberries and only went with white chocolate chips as I prefer them. The cookies taste good but disappointing not so different from regular oatmeal cookies. I found them a bit too sweet and so it overwhelmed the cranberry taste. Next time I would reduce the sugar to let the other ingredients shine through.

These cookies were so yummy! I skipped the milk chocolate chips... 1 cup of chips was enough for the amount of batter. I also added about 1 tsp of orange zest which was delicious! 16 minutes is way too long to bake, 12 minutes is perfect. The fresh cranberries make the cookie!

I've found my new favorite cookie! I replaced 1/3 cup of flour with whole wheat floor, replaced 2 tablespoons oats with flax meal, and added an extra 1/4 cup cranberries. I also left off the drizzle on the top--which I'd do for special occasions. In my opinion, if these changes up the health benefits without sacrificing flavor or texture, why not? Yum! I haven't found a successful replacement for part of the butter, but I may keep trying. These cookies are best fresh and didn't hold up for me when I made them several days before Christmas. The dough stores well in the 'fridge for several days, though, so you can bake smaller batches.

These are amazing! The only negative is that my family started eating them before the drizzle of chocolate was on and thought they were "too healthy" to be Christmas cookies. The drizzle of white chocolate made them look more festive and taste a bit less healthy. When I gave these out in gift plates, several people contacted me for the recipe because their families wanted more. Do, however, follow the suggestion to add a bit more flour so they don't get overly thin. I used unsifted flour, tapped the cup to settle it and also added 1/8 cup extra.

Delicious even though I use dried cranberries, instead of fresh. The 3 different types of chips made the cookie more complex tasting. Crisp on the edges and chewy in the center.

I took 6 dozen of these to a cookie exchange, drizzled with milk chocolate and they were gone at the end of the evening while others remained. I call that a success! I followed the recipe exactly except for the chocolate drizzling (I scooped the melted chocolate into a ziplock sandwich bag with the corner snipped off and squeezed it onto the cookies in thin zigzag lines). They were not too flat. I am not a fan of making cookies (usually too labor-intensive) but I am a fan of eating them and this recipe will go in my personal recipe file. They were delicious: crunchy and chewy, sweet and tart, and, except for chopping the cranberries, as easy to make as a regular chocolate chip cookie.

I'm going to a cookie exchange on Saturday and just baked 14 dozen of these cookies! They rock! I read a lot of reviews, so added a bit more flour and was a bit more liberal with the oats, chips and cranberries. I made two double batches and doubled all ingredients. The cookies do indeed flatten out, but I was happy about that as they make them look bigger and I could conserve my dough! It was interesting to see that the cookies baked on the silicone liner were flatter than those on parchment, so I switched to all parchment. Baking time ranged from 12 to the full 16. Now that I'm a day early with the cookies, I may actually drizzle the chocolate on top. They are good with or without.

Thanks to the reviewers...I tapped down my flour when measuring, and the cookies weren't too thin. The fresh cranberries are absolutely fabulous - made the recipe! I used a combo of white, milk and dark choc chips, and also added grated orange zest - will probably add a little more next time. Baked according to the recipe, even though they looked like they could use another minute or so. They were prefect! Will definately be a Xmas cookie I make every year - rich, delicious, but yet different from the average cookie. I drizzed w/white choc - looked as good if not better than the pic. YUM!

Delicious, and I had no trouble with them. Made a "practice" batch this morning to try them out for the holidays. I admit, I very lightly tapped the measuring cup with the flour on the counter twice and re-filled it to the top. My cookies were thick and mounded. Added chocolate-covered raisins in lieu of the milk chocolate chips. I didn't quite trust the 16-minute baking time because they weren't yet golden on the edges, so I baked them for 18 minutes. Wrong. Keep it to 16 minutes or less, as others have suggested. No question I'll be making these again!

Yum... These are awsome! I didn't make the chocolate drizzle and they were still great.

Make a double recipe since these will be gobbled up. If you're not a chocolate lover you can cut back on the chocolate to reduce cost. Doesn't hurt them a bit. Use fresh cranberries, I am buying extra to freeze while they're available by me--you'll want to make these later in the year long after fresh cranberries are not available.

This is our favorite year-round cookie. I highly recommend it. Everyone wants the recipe. I find that it doesn't need the frosting.

This is the best cookie that I've ever tasted...I followed this recipe exactly as directed, it was fabulous, I used fresh cranberries which is the best use for cranberries that I've found yet! They did cook flat so on the last couple of batches I added 1 tabl. of flour also added some orange peel which made the wonderful taste between orange (citrus),cranberries (tart) chocolate (sweet)such a fine mixture of taste!

I thought these were delicious. I doubled the recipe and had no problems. I did NOT add more flour or oats. They flatten, so what. Makes them crisper. Also, I would not switch to dried cranberries ( unless you had to). Fresh are tarter. I added orange zest to batter. I also had a hard time dribbling the choc. on top the cookie. It was too thick. i tried adding orange extract and it glommed up. So I added fresh orange juice till it was dripable and it worked fine. I loved the cnsistency of the cookie. It has so much stuff in it, it is crunchy yet soft at the same time.

My family loves these so much they all ask for these cookies for their birthday. I use dried cranberries and reconstitute with a little rum.

I didn't have any problems with spreading - I used 1 cup dried cranberries and 1 cup dark chocolate chunks. But I wonder if the cinnamon is what knocked it just a little sideways for me? I think next time I'll keep it to just the chocolate and the fruit, to see if it puts it in the "wow" zone.

Wonderful recipe. Cookies are soft and moist. I used frozen cranberries and white & milk chocolate chips. I'll try adding orange zest to the next batch for a little extra kick.

I've been making these cookies the last three years and they are yummy! Lately I have been adding Lindt's dark chocolate with orange peel, in addition to adding 1-2 tablespoons of orange zest. They are a hit every Thanksgiving.

These cookies were fantastic. I used orange flavor dried cranberries and they added such great flavor to the cookies. I also added a little extra oats like other reviews mentioned but next time Ill add the extra flour as well since they do flatten out quite a bit.

These cookies are great! I always make some changes based on what I have and used nuts instead of cranberries, plus I put about 1/4 cup of ground flax seed in place of an equal amount of flour and cut the butter to one stick. They were still fantastic.

Actually, I'd give these cookies 3.5 stars. They're fantastic! I used frozen cranberries, and they provide just enough tartness to balance out all the chocolate. I thought all the chocolate made these cookies a little too sweet, so I'll probably reduce the total to 1 cup next time and perhaps use 2/3 semisweet and 1/3 white chocolate. It's worth keeping a bag of frozen cranberries around so you can make these all year long. I can't wait to make these next fall when fresh cranberries are in season.

Not sure why I didn't try this recipe sooner; I was looking for something new and stumbled upon this in an old Bon Appetit. These were a hit in my house and elsewhere this past holiday season. I made several batches and they went as quickly as I made 'em (my hubby in particular loved these). I used the dried (vs. fresh) cranberries, although I may try fresh next time just to see if it's better or not. Don't skimp on the chips; that's what makes these cookies so good. I also didn't bother with the drizzle effect; while it looked nice, it seemed like too much effort for a cookie that is fine "as is."

I thought these were great! Next time I make these I will try the suggestion below of adding more oats. Not only would they not flatten out as much, but I like my oatmeal cookies to taste pretty oatmeal-y. The cranberries are a great foil to the sweetness of the chocolates!

I can't keep these in the house. I add an extra 1/4 cup of flour and oats so they don't flatten out. I also add 1/2 cup of walnuts. I've had to freeze cranberries so we can have these all year round.

I've made these the last 2 years. 1st year: the flavor was good but they spread too much & were pretty flat but received rave reviews even from folks who aren't big chocolate fans. This year: did not use the parchment paper, just non-stick cookie sheet and made the cookies smaller. This worked perfectly! These are definitley on the keeper list.

Really easy and delicious! I used dried cherries because that's what I had on hand and the cookies were great! I think these are wonderful autumn/winter cookies - and a different way to use cranberries rather than just out of a can...

delicious, I'm a baker always trying new receipes. Next time I might used dried cranberries they're more tart that fresh or frozen or increased the frozen amt by 1/4c. a keeper...

I was told that these cookies were delicious, but my husband and I think they were just being polite! I followed the advice of other reviewers to only bake for 12 minutes, and I'm very glad I did because they were still a bit overdone. Maybe I'm just not a big fan of hard cookies. I think the flavors are great, though, so I would like to give them another chance.

Wow! I give these 3.5 stars because I'm not sure how they would have been if I followed the recipe exactly. I only had milk & semi-sweet chips (which I increase to 3/4 C. each), and dried cranberries (used a generous 1/2 C.). But the recipe turned out delicious! Next time I will include white chocolate and fresh cranberries and see if it's even better.

These cookies are wonderful. The fresh cranberries are what really make these stand out.

I was looking for a festive cookie that I could make ahead of time for a holiday gathering, and this recipe is it! My store was out of white chocolate chips, so I used bittersweet chocolate and milk chocolate chips which worked out fine. I will try it with the 3 types of chips next time. Some reviewers used dried cranberries, but I think the tart crunchiness of the fresh berries is what makes this cookie unique. Like several others, 12 minutes baking time was perfect. YUM!

So fabulous. I agree. I baked it for 12 minutes. Yummy!!!

Up the cranberries to 3/4 cup, reduce chips to 1 1/4 and forget the drizzling unless it's for company or a gift. After being on Atkins/South Beach, sweets seem magnified x 2 so I want more tart cranberry.

Amazing recipe. No modifications needed. I made them last year for a bake sale and have had multiple people ask me if I'm making them again for the event this year.

I couldn't find frozen cranberries so I used dried cherries instead. I also left out the white chocolate and used 1 cup semi-sweet and the 1/2 cup milk chocolate it called for. These are the most delicious cookies I have had.

Yummy! I made this recipe for numerous groups of friends during the holidays, and they all loved them. I drizzled with semi-sweet instead of white chocolate, though, since I find white chocolate too sweet. I kept the chocolate ratios the same, but doubled the cranberries to cut through the sweetness a little.

Loved it! But I kind of made my little adjustments to this recipe: 3/4 apflour & 1/4 whole wheat flour (for the nuttiness & texture) 1/4 tsp cloves (for the smell) used dried cranberries instead of fresh/frozen!

This cookie was very tasty. Nice hint of cinnamon. I usually make recipes exactly as they are written the first time, however, I didn't this time. But I only changed it a bit... The main thing I did was cut the amount of chips and cranberries - I used all three flavors of chocolate, but used a heaping 1/4C of each instead of 1/2C each. (I did the same with the cranberries.) Also did not put the drizzle of white chocolate on the top. I wanted to taste the cookie too- not just the chips and chocolate. But I'm sure they're great the original way too - just A LOT richer! They were absolutely delicious and enjoyed by all who tried them. You got a different flavor in every bite. They were so easy and a sure hit.

I have made these cookies 3 or 4 times now. Very easy to make and every time they are a huge hit. Perfect for the holidays.

Making these cookies with 1/2 cup toasted almonds made these even more delicious. Very filling!

Best cookies ever! I prepare them exactly as directed, except I bake them for slightly less time at 325. These are always a huge hit, loved by all. The fresh, sour cranberries really compliment the sweet chocolate.

Everyone loved these cookies. The only change I made was to drizzle dark and white chocolate on each cookie from plastic bags with the corner snipped off. Much easier than the fork method!

I made the cookies exactly according to the recipe. My only alteration was the baking time. They seemed just right at about 12 1/2 minutes. Delicious!!

My husband was skeptical but ended up loving these cookies. I made them as shown except I forgot to buy semisweet chips and just used white and milk choc. Tasted great!

I thought these were very good. I didn't use the milk chocolate chips either and used fresh cranberries chopped in a mini-prep. Definitely use the parchment paper, I did one batch w/out and they were a little brown on the bottom.

I thought these were fantastic. I also used dried cranberries, and the cookies turned out just fine.

I thought these were very good (and so did others) but I did make some modifications. I didn't use any milk chocolate in the cookie nor did I drizzle any on top. And for the cranberries I used dried. Also ran out of old-fashioned oats, so about a 1/3 of the oats were quick oats.
