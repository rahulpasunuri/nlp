I make these on New Years Eve every year. They take a lot of patience and if you're not vigilant, the potatoes could burn. But, this recipe is definitely worth a try.

Of course the caviar and creme fraiche was delicious; however the potato slices became extremely rubbery after just a cople of hours of sitting (after cooking). The potatoes were delicious right out of the oven but are not something I want to do at the last minute. Also, they burn easily. Generally, a pain to make.
