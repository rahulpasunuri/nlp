This is a really classy dessert, when prepared right. It isn't supposed to have that fluffy texture of a traditional chocolate cake. Like most food, quality ingredients are key. In order to get that "cake" feel, I bake it in a spring form pan in a water bath. I do not have the "deflating" issues that arise in a loaf pan when prepared this way. I occasionally add a tablespoon of strong coffee, per another DL chocolate cake recipe. Serve with berries, sorbet, or simple whipped cream. So easy and always impresses friends. David Lebovitz is a genius and making the recipes from his books is a lot of fun. Read Sweet Life in Paris. It gives a better context for this cake, it's texture, and is a great read for anyone who loves food.

This recipe was easy to make, and I followed the directions carefully. It rose well in the oven, but fell drastically while cooling and turned out looking rather pathetic and sad. Cut it up into brownies, which tasted ok, but I won't be making this recipe again.

Very easy, a good cake to make if you want to create something out of your pantry without having to go to the store (at least in my pantry, which has far too much chocolate in it). This came out as a very brownie-like cake, but hey, who doesn't like brownies?

Great and easy chocolate cake. The first time I made it everyone raved. The second time, I used dark chocolate that had too high of a percentage of cocoa and the cake tasted bitter. I had best success with Lindt dark chocolate in the white wrapper.
