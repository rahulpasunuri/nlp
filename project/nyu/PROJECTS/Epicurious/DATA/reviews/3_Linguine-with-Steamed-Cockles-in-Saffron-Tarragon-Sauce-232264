A little tarragon goes a loooong way. I would cut the tarragon by half. I'd also love to try aluver's suggestion and sub parsley. Its a good base to play with. Definitely easy. I found it begging for a sprinkle of red pepper flakes.

This is a favorite of mine! The saffron really kicks it up, I don't put in the cream and have to stop myself from putting the bowl of broth up to my mouth. This is a real treat!

This is beyond yummy. Have made this several times and it is always a hit! Not a drop of sauce left.

Divine and so simple!! Have made this two times; the first time I followed the recipe to the letter (very unusual for me). The tarragon gave such a fresh flavour. The second time I substituted 1/4 cup minced parsley for the tarragon.As well replaced the linguine w/ orecchiette; nice change as the sauce nestles in the pasta and not a drop is lost.

This was an amazingly delicious and simple recipe. The little cockles in their shells scattered over the top of the pasta looked beautiful. I made it exactly as written. This could be a main course in a romantic dinner for two. (It was at my house!)
