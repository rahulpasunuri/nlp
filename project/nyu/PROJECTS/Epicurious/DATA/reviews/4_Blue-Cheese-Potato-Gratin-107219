This was amazing! I used Danish blue cheese, half heavy cream and half half-n-half, and Monterey jack cheese. I made 1-1/2 times the recipe and packed it into a 4-quart casserole - had to put it on a cookie sheet as it bubbled over and dripped onto the oven floor. I baked it about an hour and then browned the top as directed, then left it in the turned-off oven. It stayed hot for another 1-1/2 hours until it was served. People LOVED it. Guests who have always been very polite and modest were eating three servings. It's that good.

This recipe is excellent as is and gets rave reviews every time. I tweaked it slightly to make it more kid friendly on Boxing Day and substituted the Maytag Blue for Borgonzola which is milder and creamier as kids don't typically appreciate blue cheese. I then added parmesean to make them even cheesier. One of my guests was a professional caterer and she was so crazy about this she asked for the recipe. If you don't have a vegetable slicer (they're cheap, mine was $14 and works great), it's worth the investment for this dish to get nice thin and consistent potatoes in a snap.

This Gratin is FABULOUS! Pairs nicely with steak and red wine. I will definitely make this again and again.

Truly a reliable and popular dish. It re-heats great (top with more cheese if 'crust' has been eaten). Flavorful and delicious. Don't skimp on the Maytag-it makes all the difference and you might add a bit of sour cream in place of a heavy cream for even MORE flavor!

OMG! You've found it. This is the BEST gratin recipe!

I used all half and half instead of cream. This was delicious and we'll definitely make it again. Next time I'll do an Irish cheddar instead of mozzarella, however. The onion was delicious in it. I'm assuming some people who hated it didn't cook it properly before adding it to the gratin.

I loved this dish. Make sure that you use a good quality blue cheese and don't scrimp on it. I didn't have the right tool to slice the potatoes, so I thinly sliced them with a knife. It worked ok, but the potatoes needed to cook a bit longer as a result. I'll definitely make it again.

Absolutely delicious. Being too lazy to head out for the exact cheeses, I used Picos Cabrales (a spanish blue) and a part- skim mozzarella- I loved the result. I had to remove the serving dish from the table, lest all time on the elliptical be in vain.

The guests loved it! They thought the onions sealed the deal, but everyone agreed it could do with more rocquefort (which I used in lieu of blue cheese to make it more french). I would double the amount of rocquefort in future.

I made this for a dinner celebrating my daughter's Confirmation...everyone loved it! I used part heavy cream and part half/half and it was still extremely rich. I also made a smaller dish that was a little more "kid-friendly," using white cheddar cheese and eliminating the onions. I have passed along the recipe to three others!

I would make this recipe again but I would not put any blue cheese in it - thus I guess the name would have to go - I found the blue cheese repulsive, which I know is not the fault of the recipe, only personal taste - but no one mentioned previously how incredibly strong it would be and I felt my review might warn someone else. I will try this again and use milder cheeses.

This is really supurb. I tend to change recipes, but here my only change was to use canola as I was out of olive oil. Our family all loved it including kids. Not overpowered by blu cheese.

Very good! I made this twice, once for Easter dinner and again for a potluck. Rave reviews both times. It is very rich though, no doubt loaded with calories, so I would only make it for special occasions.

Excellent with roasted meats. I tried it with the onions as stated in the recipe and it was fine but next time I might use an onion confit instead of carmelized onions.

Rating: 4
Great recipe! I reduced the onion like others suggested, but wished I hadn't. They need to carmelize longer...more like 25-30 minutes. I also added a little nutmeg. Big hit with the boyfriend.

If you want to cut the fat without compromising the tase or texture, use lowfat evaporated milk instead of the half and half. The flavor stays rich and the sauce is not runny.

Rating: 3
Fantastic, foolproof and decadent - serve with any plain meat. I use half the onions and assorted remains of shredded, leftover, white cheeses in the freezer, Rosenborg Danish Blue in oil (always somewhere in the back of the fridge). Quarter potatoes lengthwise and run them thru the feed tube of your Cuisinart. I cut the baking time in half by simmering the potatoes in cream on the stove for 20 minutes while I do the onions and assemble other ingredients.

Made this dish for dinner tonight. Based upon earlier reviews, I only used two onions. It was amazing. Next time I will try a combo of cream and milk to lighten up the fat a bit.

Rating: 3
Terrific -- but, used *only* fat free half and half, and it was definitely a little too runny (even with a spoonful or so of flour sprinkled over each onion layer). Overall, great flavor, and I'm sure I'll give it four forks when I follow the recipe to the letter (or closer) next time!

Rich, creamy, completely awesome. I thoroughly caramelized two medium onions and they melted into the layers of potatoes and cheese. I also substituted Emmenthaler and fontina for the mozzarella.

Rating: 4
Excellent! Great flavor! I took the other reviewer's advice and used a combination of cream and fat free half-and-half. I would definitely consider using only the fat free half-and-half---- I think it would be just fine. Another piece of advice is to use only one small onion and chop it into fine bits before carmelizing. I have no idea why it calls for 3 onions (I only used two and cut them like the recipe said, and they ended up stringy and very unappetizing, but with good flavor).

Fabulous! With a steak and red wine, yummy! It's the dish everyone at work asks me to bring to pot-luck lunches - a favorite of the whole office - even without the steak and wine!

Rating: 4
One of my dinner guests, an excellent cook, said this was the best thing she had ever eaten! Definitely caramelize the onions. Substitute either 18% or 10% cream if 35% seems too much of a good thing. Stir occasionally while bringing the cream to a boil as the bottom layer of potatoes tends to burn otherwise. Try adding a bit of fresh rosemary.

Rating: 4
This was wonderful. I halved the onions as other reviewers suggested and used a combination of cream and fat-free half and half. Next time I'll try it using only fat-free half and half and see if it affects the taste. All in all, an easy recipe that wows everyone.

UNREAL! Have made it twice now at dinner parties and it is the rave of the evening. So good so easy! Use fresh mozz cheese - it really adds to it! It is a staple now in our house!

Have tried many potato gratins, and this is by far the best! Have made it twice now. The first time I made it exactly as written, and found it excellent. For those who thought that it was too "oniony", make sure to carmelize the onions. If you use a non-stick skillet, this may take longer. The second time I made it, I used fresh buffalo mozarella, which I much prefer.

Yes, this one is a big-time winner. If you've done a gratin search and aren't opposed to blue cheese, stop looking -- you've found it. I made two trivial changes: halved the onions as someone mentioned and used a Pt. Reyes blue instead of a Maytag. Then I took it upscale by baking it in six 2-inch deep individual-sized custard ramekins and topping with a fine dice of fried applewood bacon and a chive garnish. Nice.

Delicious change of pace. Agree with reducing the onion. Next time will add only about 1/2 of the recommended amount. Still, a wonderful dish!

wow! we LOVED this recipe. used whole milk for the cream and a combo of (local) great hill blue cheese and cheddar. yum!

Substituted 2% milk for half the cream and sliced taters with a box grater and it turned out amazing. Unfortunately, I used a domestic blue cheese which overpowered the dish and made it too salty. I definitely will make this again, but will experiment with the cheeses, such as a good sharp cheddar/mozzarella blend or a smoked cheese. Very rich. I may try all milk next time, too.

I belong to a gourmet club and served this dish with a grilled chicken breast with corn salsa and it was a huge hit! My guests loved it and would make it again. My only suggestion would be to reduce the amount of onions by 30%.

i made this for dinner for my husband and I in November and it was excellent. i used Yukon gold potatoes, crumbled blue cheese, and Gruyere for the mozzarella because that's what I had on hand. the step to boil the potatoes in the cream may not be necessary. After doing that step the cream was really thick and not pourable. Great dish for entertaining.

We thought this was delicious, but it was definitely a heart-attack in a baking dish so we'll save it for special dinners. I cut the potatoes thinly by hand, and it was fine.
