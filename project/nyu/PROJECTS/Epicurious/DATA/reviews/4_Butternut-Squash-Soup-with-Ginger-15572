I've been making this sourp for a couple of years now- I usually double the carlic and add 1 cup of light or fat-free cream to thin, my husband likes soup thinner, and then dollop some sour cream on top and serve with fresh rolls. While I agree with some other reviewers that the soup was on the blander side, I would say that of almost all Butternut-Squash soups I've ever eaten, so I sort of expected a lighter taste.

Rating: 1
I made this exactly as written: I usually rate most epicurious recipes 3 or 4, probably because I recognize what I'm going to like, but this recipe is not worth the trouble. In spite of the garlic and ginger, I found it to be extremely bland, sort of like hot baby-food. Roasting the squash ahead of time made for a very nice consistency, but it was a lot of work peeling the soft squash without getting squash everywhere. I am sure that the suggestions made by several reviewers would enhance the recipe (more garlic, more ginger, apple cider, etc.), but as is, I won't be making this version of butternut squash soup again.

This recipe, on its own was nothing special. However with a lot of doctoring up, became quite good! I added: 1 C Milk 1/2 Stick Butter Freshly Grated Nutmeg 1/2 C Dry Sherry (possibly more!) It's far too bland on its own - be prepared to get creative!

Very nice, used extra ginger and sub 1c of stock with 1c apple cider. Used celery and green onions. Remember a recipe is only a guide line.

Nice fall/winter soup. For a little more depth of flavor I added a little celery and chopped carrot and a little half and half at the end. The night before I made it I ate butternut squash soup at a local restaurant, but the flavor of this soup was much better!

Rating: 3
Delicious. Like so many others I didn't follow the recipe all that closely, though I'm sure it would have been great as is. Used about a tablespoon of ginger. Added a small sweet potato because I like them with squash. Thought the idea of using apple cider was cool but didn't have any so cooked a diced apple in the broth, then used about a half-cup of dry white wine in addition to water to thin soup at end.

This soup was delicious! I made a couple of changes- I doubled the garlic and cinnamon and tripled the ginger, and substituted a cup of fresh pressed apple cider for one of the stock cups. A dollop of creme fraiche and some chopped scallions topped it beautifully! Will definitely make again and again!

My guests loved this soup. I added about 2Tb or more of ginger and 1/4 tsp cayenne. Also added low fat coconut milk to thin.

This is a well-balanced and exciting butternut squash soup. I measured my onion, garlic, and ginger roughly, so I may have added more, but the flavors all work together very well. Also I accidently added the cut up squash in with everything else, but I don't think this really affected anything negatively. Looking forward to the leftovers!

Very good. To save time, I cut and peel squash into chunks and add to chicken broth cook until tender then add the rest of ingredients. Oh added more ginger per other reviews.

This is a pretty good recipe. We all liked it, it was comforting and tasty. I doubled the ginger but otherwise followed the instructions. I'm only giving it two forks ("good"), because while the soup was good, it wasn't really particularly outstanding. I'd make it again, though.

I too added additional ginger because I love it. I served it with a dollop of balsamic sour cream (just mix the two together). People licked their bowls.

A Big hit! I scooped the cooked squash from the peel into a large pot, added the onion, garlic, ginger etc. and cooked them all together with the stock. I pureed the whole works in the pot with my Bamix and it was fabulous. A sprinkle of chopped parsley on the top.

Rating: 0
This was delicious, and even better if you let it rest after you make it and then heat it up later. I agree, double the ginger, and add a bit more brown sugar. I also think that chives work better than parsley and a dollop of creme fraiche is perfect.

My neighbor and I both had a couple of butternut squash to use - I chose this recipe and she chose one from the food network. We both agree this one won hands down! Simple, easy, nice flavor.

Rating: 3
Used veggie stock instead of chicken. Needed a second T of brown sugar and a full stick of cinnamon to achieve the desired level of sweetness. Also, per other reviewers, doubled ginger. Ended up grating fresh cinnamon over each bowl -- this was the kick that the soup needed. Hearty and creamy, just a little low on the flavor profile.

Its the day before Thanksgiving for me and if you are thinking of doing a soup - RUN OUT AND GET BUTTERNUT SQUASH!! I just pureed mine and it's delicious. Can't wait for tomorrow. I used the pre-cut/peeled from a local store and baked the suggested time so that made prep all the easier.

A simply delicious soup that is easy to throw together midweek, particularly if you use pre cut butternut squash (Trader Joe's). My husband, not a huge vegetable fan, loved it. Also tastes great reheated as leftovers.

Great recipe. Very easy to make. Easy to double. Used precut, peeled butternut squash for ease. Doubled the ginger amount and added some powdered ginger. Added roasted, chopped hazelnuts on top with the chopped parsley for a little crunch. Tried sour cream, too. Will definitely make this again.

Rating: 4
So I am not much of a squash fan but I loved this soup and so did my family! It was super easy to make. I made two adjustments. I only had 4 cups of chicken broth so I used apple cider for the last cup and I used pumpkin pie spice, a couple of dashes, in place of the cinnamon. I will definitely make this again.

Rating: 4
Great soup - I have made it twice now with a few tweaks: I threw in a delicata squash for a different texture this time and it was a nice touch. Upped the ginger to about double and added a dash of dried ginger as well. I was actually looking for a squash/pear soup recipe, so I added two pears (fresh, peeled) at the point where the squash was returned to the pot. I may try adding pear juice/nectar for a bit more pear flavor next time!

Rating: 4
We love this soup and make it a couple times a month. I did make a couple of changes. First, I changed the chicken broth to vegetable broth, use chinese pickled ginger instead of fresh and ground cinnamon. This way I have all the staples on hand and it's totally vegan--lazy I know; but, still good.

Fantastic soup. I have made this a couple times, using a stick blender, and I find it needs to simmer for an additional 10-15 minutes after you puree. It's a great soup course, or with crumbled bacon and pumpkin seeds, a main course. With only 2 cups of chicken stock on hand, I simmered carrots for about 30 minutes, discarded all but a handful of the carrots, and mixed that broth with chicken stock. May do that again on purpose next time.

This one is a keeper. I did not use the brown sugar but instead added a crispin apple. It was delicious. I roasted the butternut squash from scratch - but using the already cut squash would save some time.

This is my favorite butternut squash soup recipe. I usually have to add a little more stock and I use minced chives instead of parsley for the garnish. Other than that, I don't think any changes are necessary. Today I served it in mugs so we could eat it while watching a movie in the living room with a blazing fire going. Yum!

really nice start to TG meal. I have another recipe that uses a *lot* of cream. I have to admitt it does taste a bit better but basically after eating it, it's a struggle to eat anything else. This was a perfect lead-in to the rest of dinner.

Great soup, had my parents over for dinner and they loved it. I omitted the sugar (the squash is way sweet as is) and added 2 leaks, a parsnip, a cup of white wine and doubled the ginger like another reviewer mentioned and the result was great!

Just love this recipe and have made it many times. I do tweak it just a bit. I add one large apple cut in chunks to the onion mixture while cooking. It adds a great touch of sweetness and texture. I also add about 1/2 tsp. of cumin to pureed soup for that extra flavor and zest. Serve with a dollop of creme fraiche or mascarpone cheese. Bon Apetit!

This soup was scrumptious! I added 1 cup of carrot juice to the chicken stock and topped the soup with a dollop of creme fraiche, a few chopped chives and a tiny drizzle of 15 year old balsalmic vinegar. The sweetness of the vinegar with the creme blended nicely with the soup.

This was very good. I added two diced carrots to the squash as it was cooking, and it was plenty sweet; it did not need any sugar at all. I also added shallots with the onion and I think that added to the flavor.

This soup is delish! I cheated though...Trader Joe's has cut up squash in bags. I used 4, roasted for 15 min. at 400, and used thawed, diced onions. This cut the cooking time down a lot. Then at the end, I added a "splash" of milk. This soup is a huge hit.

A great fall soup. I cut the squash in half , the entire piece if it has a "neck", and bake cut side up covered with foil. Then scoop out the meat with a spoon. I added 1 Tablespoon each of heavy cream and butter, just for indulgence; garnished with fresh tarragon. Excellent. A bumper crop of butternuts will alllow more variations, as suggested, with the spices. I was just thinking curry would be great!

The second time I made this, I used pre-cut butternut squash cubes (more expensive, but a lot easier). I tossed them with a little vegetable oil and roasted them in a single layer in two 9x12" glass Pyrex baking dishes. I also doubled the amount of ginger and substituted minced chives for the garnish. My guests raved. Excellent!

Rating: 4
This was SO good. Velvety smooth and delicious. After the dinner plates were cleared, I grabbed a spoon and began eating the remainder right out of the pot. I used minced chives for the garnish instead of parsley; otherwise, I made it exactly per the recipe. I'll make this again, maybe next time taking the suggestions of other cooks and upping the ginger and/or garlic. And I'll definitely try roasting pre-cut butternut squash cubes to make things easier. This will make a fabulous first course at Thanksgiving or any fall dinner.

Rating: 4
An excellent recipe, but I like adding a couple of sliced parsnips and celery to almost any soup. A cup of wine makes this a richer soup as well. Also, this soup is more easily blended by using a hand blender right in the soup pot. Finally, I think this soup is much more elegant if you skip the parsley at the end and sprinkle pine nuts onto the top of each bowl that you serve.

I have made this soup at least 25 times since 1998. I double the ginger and omit the cinnamon, otherwise make it as is. It is wonderful. It is best made with homemade chicken broth. A hand blender is the easiest way to puree it at the end, but leaves small pieces of ginger that give a bite to the finished dish.

Rating: 4
About the GINGER PROBLEM: Use only fresh ginger. Just peel it and grate it using a microplane. I only added about a teaspoon or less with the onion. But I add about a teaspoon or two more at the end about five minutes prior to the end of cooking the soup. This way it retains the heat. Try it. Amazing soup and great way to use a huge butternut squash. I too roasted a head of garlic and added that to the soup. Added a few small potatoes boiled in with broth (and a parsnip getting bored in fridge) to smoothen it out a bit. I would not garnish it it with parsley. Fresh Coriander is the thing to do and a little bit of 0% yoghurt to cut the sweetness. Amazing stuff.

Rating: 3
we liked this soup. i topped it with sour cream and crispy sage leaves. i probably at least tripled the grated fresh ginger, and used an apple that i wanted to get rid of. also, coriander, some cayenne. it was zesty, but not too much so. husband loved it, kids didn't, but that's how they usually are with veggie anything!

I made this soup tonight for the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday and everyone is dipping into the pot because it smells so good! Per other reviews, I doubled the ginger (could have used more), subbed leeks for onions and skipped the cinnamon but added some ground coriander and nutmeg. I also added a ripe bosc pear, which I tossed in oil and roasted along with the squash. Immersion blender worked beautifully. I plan to garnish with fried sage leaves. Delicious and easy!

With modifications, this recipe becomes a four forker. I used leeks instead of onion (about 2.5 cups of leek), grated the ginger (more good juice that way) and used about 1 tablespoon, ignored the cinnamon and threw in about a teaspoon of freshly ground coriander and 1/2 teaspoon of freshly ground cumin and a couple of dashes of very good cayenne. The squash is easily scooped out of the skin after baking; no need to mess with peeling and cubing it. An immersion stick blender, right in the cooking pan, simplifies preparation, too. Very rich and spicy.

I used the butternut squash and an immersion blender and got a perfectly smooth consistency. I added 2T ginger and feel that is appropriate. However a little less garlic seems warrented to my taste. Perhaps my garlic cloves were too big as the were quite plump and large. A dollop of sour cream on top goes nicely too.

I really enjoyed this recipe- it's tasty yet healthy without the heavy cream. I recommend puree-ing twice. I was in a rush and only ran the whole batch through once, and it came out a little thicker than I would have preferred. The fresh ginger makes a difference, very aromatic & tasty.

I am as carniverous as can be, but I'm going to have to *strongly* advice folks to use vegetable broth instead. The sweet, delicate flavor of the butternut squash was overpowered by the chicken flavor of the broth. It is otherwise a perfect recipe that I intend to use again soon. It was super easy to make and is a great excuse to whip out the hand blender.

Very easy and very good. Two suggestions...take it light on the cinnamon and (of course) added a touch of half and half to make it a bit richer.

Deeelicious! I made half the recipe, using one Butternut squash. The soup came out a bit thick, so I needed to add a litle extra chicken broth. It is excellent served with sour cream and chives.

This soup is excellent and very easy to make. I have made it several times for family and friends - even people who are not fans of squash loved the soup! To make things easier, I just use a hand blender right in the soup pot to puree it (instead of transfering soup in batches to the blender) Makes a great fall or winter meal - I usually add a little spoonful of sourcream in each bowl.

I made this for my husband and friends on two occasions. Everyone raved about it. The 2nd time I made it,I added 1 1/2 tsp. curry instead of the cinnamon. I also added a little half-and-half to each bowl as was suggested earlier. It was GREAT! We plan to serve it to the whole family at Thanksgiving.

Very tasty indeed. I added a bit more ginger than the recipe asks for. I think next time, I'll put a bit less sugar as the squash is already a bit sweet. My guests loved it and everyone had a second helping!

This was a very easy recipe but the results were somewhat bland for my taste. If I were to make it again, I would add more ginger and leave the cinnamon stick in longer for more flavor. A dollop of sour cream may help.

I made this for my wife and friends. None of us are squash lovers but this soup is fantastic-thick and rich with very little added fat! The whole pot gotten eatten and we've since made it again to eat with bread as a meal.

Excellent! Line baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup, use a small scooper to scoop out squash rather than peeling. Also since I didn't have homemade chickstock, I used a fabulous stock made by "Kitchen Basics" it's rich flavored and not watered down.

Great recipe--easy even for a novice cook. I had to use powdered cinnamon instead of a cinnamon stick. It worked fine. Will definitely make it again. The oldest (31 years old) and the youngest (1.5 years old) members of my family loved it.

Very easy and relatively quick to make. Forget about peeling the cooked squash, just scoop it out. Adding a little half and half to each bowl is a nice touch.

Made this soup for my family at Thanksgiving. It was light and delicious and we will definately have it again as an appetizer. Several people commented that it would be great as a light dinner with salad. I wasn't sure squash soup would be a hit, but this was. The ginger really adds a nice touch.
