If you could choose ) forks, I would! I tried making this recipe twice and it was terrible both times. Perhaps it was because I used frozen vs fresh shrimp, but even then I don't think the flavors were good...it just tasted salty!

I'm not sure if the oil/vinegar mix I used was not quite right, but I thought the dressing was somewhat cloying and overly bright. I used rice vinegar and olive oil.

Excellent - cool for summer and Easy to prepare. I halved the soy and used peanut sauce (2 TBL) instead. Also drizzles some on top with extra basil. Colorful, cold, light, easy.

Very good flavor, but not a lot to it. I added a few other vegtables to spice it up. Also, it doesn't really make that much. If you are used to large portions, it barely feeds two. I recommend adding more noodles.

Very light dish, not too strong on flavor. But it was a nice easy dish to whip together on a weeknight. We enjoyed it!

Can't imagine why anyone with good taste wouldn't like this recipe. Great summertime dish because it's so refreshing and easy to make (especially if you use frozen salad shrimp).

My sister made this recipe and my husband and I found it a very tasty and refreshing salad for summertime. I have since made it for a dinner party and a family reunion and every bite was eaten. I have also been asked for this recipe by those who have tasted it.

What a waste of shrimp. This was a horrible dish. I couldnt even eat it. If I could give it zero forks, it would be more appropriate.

Everyone loves this salad, it is so simple you wouldn't think it would be so great.
