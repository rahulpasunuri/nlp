I chose this bread as my giveaway bread for the Holidays and have now made about 10 loaves so am very experienced. Here is what you should know: 1) When they say the dough will be very soft, they aren't kidding. It is practically batter. I would recommend using 4 cups of flour in the mix before turning the dough out. 2) The dough is so soft that a "lightly" floured surface will not cut it. Expect to use flour liberally at this stage and a dough scraper will be esp. helpful. 3) I did not have a mixer with a dough hook; I used a food processor with a dough hook. 4) I found that it was more helpful to use spreadable butter (as in a tub) rather than melted butter when sprinkling the cinnamon and sugar mixture. 5) I ruined 2 loaves by baking for 45-50 min. I needed the full hour to cook it all the way through. 6) Don't forget to cool the bread completely before trying to cut it. Many hours of cooling. Overnight even.

Ok, this stuff is amazing. Once you get used to all the melting and warming and waiting, it's worth it.

Great recipe! The dough rose beautifully and the loaf was soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside, perfect! Keep in mind it's a big recipe! But to get all those swirls, you need to get the dough to 1/16 in, which a couldn't due to lack of counter space. I also added raisins to the swirl!
