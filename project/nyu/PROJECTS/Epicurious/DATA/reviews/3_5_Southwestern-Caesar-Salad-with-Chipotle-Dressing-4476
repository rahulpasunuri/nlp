A substitution for the recipe's dressing is the Easy Caesar recipe with added chipotle in adobo to desired taste. Easy Caesar: # 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan (about 2 ounces) # 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil # 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons vegetable oil # 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice # 2 garlic cloves # 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 1 T. minced chipotle in adobo (or to taste). I do not like the soy sauce in the original recipe's dressing. Also, adding avocado wedges and black beans was great. Delicious!

After reading the reviews I was sceptical about following the receipe as written. I did leave the stock out fo the dressing and added croutons made with garlic to the salad. I was really very tasty and I will make it again.

Been making this recipe for many years; from Sunday afternoons on the patio to elegant dinner parties - always great and well-received. I sub the Parmesan for crumbled Queso Fresco cheese, use grape tomatoes, and arrange individually on single-serving plates. I also use whole-leaf romaine (about4-6" long) and pour dressing over top and garnish with cheese, corn and tomato. Beautiful presentation.

Very good although I made some modifications. I eliminated the soy sauce and added 1.5 tsp of minced anchovies, cut the sugar in half, added two minced garlic cloves, and added an extra tsp of minced chilies. I tossed part of the dressing with romaine then topped with grilled chicken breasts, sliced roasted peppers, diced sweet onion, the Parmesan, and then drizzled some of the remaining dressing over all.

Flavor was good, although the dressing seems a bit too mayonnaisey. I used a little more adobo sauce to kick up the smoky spiciness. I used fresh corn kernels and tomatoes from my mom's garden. Everyone at our family gathering seemed to like the salad. Next time I make it, I'll try to get my greens a bit drier and maybe seed the tomatoes, as the recipe requests, because it ended up more watery than I like.

The chpote flavor is VERY smokey and way too strong for me. It is an odd taste especially with the soy sauce and i do not like the combination.

Rating: 3
I agree w/ the other reviewer that soy sauce is a very bad addition. It made it taste like Chinese food. However, I managed to mask the taste with more lemon, broth, and adobo sauce from the chipotle. Freeze the extra broth and chipotle in ice cube trays and keep for later. We added chicken and avocado to the salad to make it more of a meal.

Wonderful twist on a caesar salad. I server this with Mexican Black Bean Sausage Chili recipe from Cooking Light 1/2006. Don't skimp on the chipotles.

I divide recipe into 2 halves and put peppers in one (for me) and leave them out of the other (for my wife). The recipe works for us with light mayo, but not fat free. We add a few good black olives too.

The soy sauce is really odd in this recipe. I think the dressing is much better without it. I also added garlic an little more of the chilies. It was spicy and good.

Although this is simple, it's loaded with flavor and gets raves every time I make it!

What a great combination of flavors. I never would have thought of putting corn in a salad but it was great. Used frozen white corn. Great dressing but gets a bit hot if it is made in advance. I would cut down on the chipotles or remove the seeds next time.

This is excellent! I had left over grilled chicken and was looking for a quick salad dressing recipe. I found this and within 15 minutes I made a wonderful salad. I immediately knew this was something i would be making again because it is so EASY! HOWEVER, I DID NOT HAVE chipotle chilies and omitted this from the dressing. A bit unfair to rate. It was excellent without the chipotles. I used grilled chicken with grape tomatoes, black beans, baby spinach and chopped romain lettuce!!! You know those great salads you find at a retaurant and think this must be easy to do at home? This is one!

Just a delicious change to the standard, and very refreshing!

This is always a hit. I get many requests for the recipe and people usually take seconds or thirds. I usually use chipotle hot sauce as it makes the recipe easier to throw together on short notice and if I am feeling really fancy I add bacon and great big garlic-y croutons. Mmmm...

This is a weird combination of flavors but it was strangely good, and good enough for me to go 3 forks. I will definitely cut down on the soy sauce next time because it was a little overpowering for a "southwestern" dressing.

I love this dressing! I freeze small amount of the chipotle's that I have left over from the recipe. I seem to be able to tolerate the hotness from the seeds too! It's my very favorite

The cook from Tucson must have done something wrong because this is a great dish. The dressing is what makes it so good. I almost always have those ingredients in the house. And you can add so many things to change the salad slightly. Some chopped, roasted red bell peppers add color and flavor, black beans, crushed tortilla chips, green onion... And the cilantro is a must. A very versatile, delicious salad.

My husband couldn't get enough of this salad - he rated it A+. To the salad I added avacado, cilantro, green onion and topped with shredded cheddar. Dressing was great - but was a little thick. Thinned with more broth and added garlic powder. Would be great with grilled chicken or shrimp on top, and served as an entree.

I've made this twice, but have thought about it more! Yum. Adding some fresh cilantro is nice.

I have made this a countless number of times. My Thai in-laws came to town and I had to cook it for them, but (SHOCK) the store here stopped carrying the chipotles! I had a bottle of the new Chipotle Tabasco, and used 2 1/2 Tbs of that and it STILL was a rave hit. This recipe is un-stoppable!!

This is my most requested recipe. My husband and all my neighbors LOVE this salad. It is quite spicy, but you can control that by the amount of chipoltes you put in. We love it. I have also added toasted pine nuts which is great also.

Rating: 4
I have made this salad quite a few times and it is always a crowd pleaser. I have found that it is really important to rinse the seeds and membranes out of the chipolte before I add them to the dressing or it is too spicy for most people. I add some of the adobo sauce from the can to give it a really smokey flavor. I will be making it again tomorrow for a dinner party with friends. It is really quick and easy.

I made this dressing as a Christmas present for my dad who happens to love any and all spicey foods. I knew he would love it, so I quadrupled the recipe and added a 7 oz can of chipoltes instead of the 3 or 4 Tabelspoons. It turned out EXCELLENT. It was so good I now have everyone asking me for the recipe. You can also use this dressing to baste meats for an extra kick.

Rating: 4
This is very good. I made a few minor changes, I used dried chipotles, softened with hot water (no canned available without a special trip for me), I also used fresh corn since I had it. The dressing was spicy, maybe because of the dried chilies instead of canned, but darn good. I don't get a "yuck" sense at all. But you need to like smoked jalepeno flavors for sure.

Yuck. I washed the dressing down the drain before making the salad.

Very good! I roasted fresh corn and added cilantro for the salsa. I also added a little brown sugar to the dressing. Excellent!

The chipolte chili made the dressing too rich and smoky for the light salad I had envisioned. I like chipolte in dips, but I'm steering clear of it in salads after tasting this one.

Yummy. I added 1 tsp dijon, extra chipotle, minced garlic, cilantro & substituted lime juice for lemon, and fresh corn (parboiled) for frozen - based on other reviewers comments and were they ever right on! Even my sister, who is known for preferring her foods on the mild side when it comes to spiciness, had two helpings. Will try this again with bbq chicken or flank steak.

The salad is wonderful, but the dressing is EXTRODINARY! I make it with reduced fat Mayo and the flavor is still excellent because the chipotle peppers carry the load.

I think I am the only cook who tried this dish and did not like it. I was surprised because I am a fan of chipotles. Maybe I should have let the dressing sit overnight to allow the flavors to blend. When I served the salad, the dressing tasted too much like mayonaise.

Rating: 3
This dressing and salad are terrific, and there are never any leftovers, no matter how much I make. In the dressing, I see no need for the chicken broth, I substitute fresh lime juice for the lemon, and add fresh coriander and crushed garlic. Also, I use fresh corn off the cob either roasted slightly or parboiled. The corn should still be crisp to give an interesting texture balance. Don't skimp on the freshly grated parmesean cheese. Yummy.

Rating: 4
Super recipe. Dressing makes it; I also added some dijon mustard as well as a small amount (to taste) of the chipolte "sauce" depending on how spicy you want it. All other reviewers' ideas seem great. Have had a delish salad like this at a good restaurant in Virginia in which greens were topped with marinated skirt steak and roasted corn and this dressing is almost identical.

Fabulous! I added garlic which only improved a wonderful recipe. I added black beans and scallions to the salad and the dish was the hit of the BBQ. I served a great rasberry-lemonade punch which received rave reviews. It is also found on this site.

This a great summer,or any time, salad. I also served it with black beans and grilled chicken. Will add avacodos next time. The dressing was not too spicy for us. This is the salad I'm bringing to the next get-together, which happens to be this week-end!

If you love chipotle chilies and want a Caesar salad with a kick and maybe something a little different, this is it! This does pack a good punch, so beware!! It makes definately more than 6 servings, so adjust the salad and you will have left over dressing for the next day. I increased the chipotles to 3, added 1 large garlic and 1 tsp of Dijon mustard. Hint: freeze chipotles individually then wrap in plastic...take out what you need

This salad is wonderful. Served it this evening with chunky guacamole from this site. Added half can of black beans and leftover steak from the weekend. Also the corn was roasted from the same cookout. Fantastic dinner. Had dressing left for another salad later this week. Do try this salad.

I've made two batches of this in 4 days, and ate both servings all by myself. This is really delicious with ripe avocados, croutons and tomatoes. I might even try adding some black beans. This is one of those things that you can have all the ingredients handy, and just whip up any time. both times I made this, I used about 4 of the chipotle chilis just to make it hot - the mayo seems to dilute the spiciness.

I've made this salad several times and each time I do, I'm always surprised by how great it is. This is a highly compatible salad to any of the additions that others have recommended. Also, I don't think the dressing is too spicy. If you're concerned, just lighten up on the chipotles.

This is a great recipe with the addition of garlic which I did add, i'd give it a four. Mash it to a paste with salt and add to dressing. I added black beans and bacon too which gave it more texture and made it a meal. I also used tortilla chips as a last minute addition on top along with chicken breasts. Marvelous!

This recipe was awesome! My husband could not get enough of it. I didn't think that it was to spicy as most critics thought but then agian that is a matter of taste. I also add some left over flank steak from your recipe Grilled Flank steak with Rosemary which is also a four fork recipe, the two married very well in this recipe. Definitely a keeper!

This salad is outstanding! We add a half can of drained black beans and chicken to make it a meal by itself. It was a bit too spicy for our kids, so we substituted a tablespoon of raseberry/chipotle sauce for the chipotle peppers. This was excellent and easy to make. Guests will rave.

I loved this recipe! Instead of parmesean I used cotija cheese and sweet white corn instead of regular. After tossing, I added crumbled tortilla chips.

Our dinner guests fell in love with this salad and dressing. I substituted garbanzo beans for the corn kernels, used 2 teaspoons of brown sugar instead of one and removed the seeds from the chipotle chilies prior to mincing them. With the seeds removed, I was able to put more chilies in the dressing than called for in the recipe.

After all the high praise I really thought this would be great. I love chipoltes and the ingredients sounded good. I was disappointed that it was so blah. I'd even added extra chipoltes to make sure it had kick! Even with grilled chicken sliced on top, we didn't find the appeal.

Delicious salad, though I would not call it a caesar. The dressing is wonderful and I can think of many other uses for it. Using water instead of the chicken broth does not seem to change the flavor at all.

I visited the Hyatt Regency at Gainy Ranch and had this wonderful Southwestern Caesar Salad last year. I was delighted to find the recipe, and my guests have enjoyed this Caesar very much. Just be warned Chipotle chilies are hot, start with half the amount listed in the recipe and adjust to taste

I had a dinner party for my mom's birthday. This was the salad course to a very rich meal. It was WONDERFUL. I am going to be making it again for my sister in law's birthday in mid-Feburary. I think it might be replacing my "famous" caesar salad I have been making for over 20 years.
