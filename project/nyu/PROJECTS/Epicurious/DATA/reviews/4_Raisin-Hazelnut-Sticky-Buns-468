I used only half as much filling and they were still super yummy!

Worked perfectly just as advertised (well, I made my own bread dough, but otherwise as stated). Just the right level of stickiness; the hazelnut flavour is needed depth.

I am making these great sticky buns for the third time as I write this. This is an excellent recipe. I don't buy frozen bread dough, I used Hodgson Mill's Wholesome White Bread Mix for the first batch -- my standard white bread recipe for the second,and am trying the basic white sandwich bread recipe from the current Epicurious. Use 1/2 recipe for sticky buns, make a loaf of bread from the second half. The glaze/filling is the secret -- it doesn't matter what bread recipe one uses. I prefer to bake sticky buns in a pan -- not muffin cups. If you want to do this, bake for 30 minutes instead of the time in the recipe. Pecans can be substituted for Hazelnuts in a pinch.

My husband I have decided to make this a tasty Christmas morning tradition. I made these last Christmas before we were married...they are definitely fattening and bad for you - BUT OH SO GOOD!!!!
