These were awesome. I used grain sweetened chocolate chips but other than that followed the recipe exactly. I love the ground flax seeds as a binding ingredient, it worked great. Almost a little too well, the dough was like putty and ended up winding the arms of the mixer. I moved to a wooden spoon as I was mixing in the dry ingredients, and at the very end i was using a knife to cut and fold! I also just about doubled the bake time. But so good, will definitely make these again.

Great recipe. I did a lower-fat version replacing half of the butter with applesauce but did use an egg. It worked great! Yum.

These were absolutely delicious!!! I used regular butter, a mixture of chopped semi-sweet/unsweetened Baker's chocolate (mixed with some chocolate chips). I did not really measure the amount of chips/chopped chocolate, but I know I put a lot. I also added unsalted sunflower seeds which gave these the perfect crunch. I also used a bit of agave syrup as sweetener and less sugar. My only downside was that my bake time was almost double, not sure why but it could have been because I used sillipat instead of parchment. Regardless, best cookies I have made in a while!

These turned out great! I did not have whole wheat pastry flour, so I used a half cup of white flour and 3/4 cups whole wheat flour. I also used a vegan egg substitute. My boys loved them.

although the batter and resulting baking was tasty, they were crumbly and didn't stay in cookie format. Very frustrating!!

These cookies are amazing! Rich and delicious ... you won't miss anything from more traditional chocolate chip cookie recipes. Made these for the family over Christmas, and nobody even knew they were vegan until I mentioned it.

I was overcome with an intense craving for chocolate today and these were just the thing! Very easy and fast to make, though I will be sure to try them with peanut butter chips next time. Extra points for metrics in the recipe, it leaves the guesswork out of baking for me. (My scale I trust; my measuring cups, not so much.)

Great vegan cookie recipe.

mmmmmm...chocolate. I just made these and this is a very good chocolate cookie recipe, compared to others I've tried. I made these non-vegan i.e. used normal butter, egg, chocolate. I like the consistency (not cakey). The batch I made has a kind of melt-in-your-mouth quality, but that may just be because I creamed the butter and sugar and egg a lot, and made smaller cookies. Next time I might handle the batter less and bake it for a slightly shorter time to try for a more chewy consistency. The only other changes I made were to use a bit less sugar (slightly under 3/4 cup) and to use chopped chocolate instead of chocolate chips (I didn't measure, though). By the way, one batch of this makes around 24 2.5-inch cookies.
