I was disappointed in this recipe. I baked rather than grilled (at 375 for a little over 30 minutes) because there was a winter storm outside. Neither kid ate the drumsticks and I thought they were just okay. Tender, but way too much salt and the lemon flavor was hardly discernible. No, I won't make this again.

This was a great recipe but I used only 1 tbsp oregano & then added 1 tbsp fresh tarragon and about a teaspoon of thyme. I also softened the flavor with about 2 tbsp of greek oregano. Everyone loved it

Super easy and ohhhh so tasty, the herbs really come through and the lemon adds the right bright note. This is a keeper for sure.

Everyone raved over the chicken. I double the recipe and used drumsticks and boneless skinless thighs. It came out great. I will make this again.

We are chicken breast eaters but decided to try this drumstick recipe - it was FABULOUS !! Will definitely make again!

Super tastey and super easy recipe. My whole family loved it and it will certainly be one of my staple recipes.

Hands down my favorite boneless skinless thighs recipe - use whole recipe for 1 lb.+ of thighs. Everyone raves, and it's so easy. Can marinate for only a half hour or hour, and the flavor still comes roaring through.

went on the grill 2 to 3 hours after room temp marinating. Easy! Delicious! Isn't that what makes summer glorious?

Couldn't put it on the grill because it was pouring rain outside, so I baked it. Other than that I followed the recipe pretty closely. Came out delicious, no meat was left on the bone when we were finished!

This was my first time marinating something in a plastic bag. First off, it was easy because I could go ahead and prepare them on the weekend and have them for the week. Second, the cleanup was easy without an oily container to wash out. A delicious recipe that I will definitely make again.

So so tasty. My husband and two very picky children devoured them. I will definitely be making it again and again

This recipe was really good and very easy. I didn't have fresh oregano, so I used just under a tablespoon of dried. I thought it was a little too salty, so next time I will use less.

I will be hosting a large crowd and need the grill space. Is it possible to grill for about 10 minutes then bake in oven for the remaining time?

These are fabulous. I couldn't get over how tasty they were and so easy! Hands down one of the best chicken dishes we've had. Excellent cold the next day.

This recipe was a smashing success with my children and mom-in-law. We had none left and sad faces when everyone realized it was gone! Easy. Delicious. Fast food.

Good, easy recipe. I followed the recipe directions exactly, and marinated the chicken several hours in the refrigerator. They came out very nice and tasty. I agree that fresh oregano is a must in this recipe. I think I'd like to try using thighs sometime.

3.5 forks - surprisingly good for the minimal work, and I'm not usually a fan of chicken dishes. I marinated only for a few hours and I think it was enough. I'm sure they would be fine marinated overnight or longer, I'm just saying that it's not necessary. Made exactly as written, although increased quantities by 50% to get better coverage on the marinade.

This is a new grilling staple in our house. We've tried it with skin-on thighs and breasts also, and find that the thighs are best. They do take some tending on the grill but are well worth it. The marinade is easy to put together, but don't be tempted to use dried oregano - the fresh herb is part of the charm of this recipe.

Easy & tasty. Got thumbs up from both the adults & the young kids. We used bone-in legs & thighs, took the skins off (so the meat would really absorb the marinade) & marinated them for about 4 hours before grilling them. We all liked the garlicky-lemony flavor. The next day, everyone agreed the leftovers made for a good lunch. Now, I'm making them again for a dinner with guests for tomorrow night, and this time am marinating them overnight to see if that makes a difference. Will definitely keep this on our easy-dinner & good-for-guests recipe list.

Not bad. I used boneless/skinless thighs as they provide a lot more flavor than boneless/skinless breast. I only marinated them for about 3 hours and why I found them to be pretty good, many of my guests found them to be too "lemony" & tart. I will try again maybe toning down on the lemon and adding a little more spice.

I rated this a 7.5 out of 10, and followed the recipe exactly, marinating for about 10 hours. It was good but not spectacular. It was a refreshing change from the spicy dry rubs we usually use, and had a nice clean, fresh flavour which was nice on a hot summer day. I'd do this again, and wouldn't limit myself to legs. I would use pieces that were the same size to aid in the grilling. It did take about 30 minutes of near constant attention over the grill.

This recipe is best when the chicken marinates overnight so flavor is more intense. I used all pieces of a chicken not just drumsticks. The family really enjoyed it.

Followed recipe exactly - these were delicious and a big hit with the family! Will definitely make again.

I used whole chicken legs and fresh oregano from the garden and it was excellent. I marinated the chicken overnight, which I would recommend. It was even better the next day served cool for a picnic.

This light refreshing marinade was a great alternative to your typical bbq sauce. Followed the recipe exactly and they were extremely moist. Marinated for 1 day. Saved some for the next day and they were also great at room temp.

I was diappointed with the marinade. I let the drumsticks marinate for almost two days and it was still pretty blah. Moist, yes - very. Did take the full 30 minutes to get done. They just didn't have that much flavor for waiting for two days.

I disagree with previous reviewer. This was one of the best easy quick marinades we've ever tried. I used fresh ingredients and minced the garlic instead of pressing. Also, instead of just drumsticks, we tried it on skin on breasts, thighs and the drumsticks, marinating it in the fridge for only 2 hours. Grilled it for about 30 minutes as recipes states and it was one of the most moist chicken meat we've eaten. Even my picky teen loved it. We'll definitely make this again...and often!

Pretty bland marinade - could have used more ummph. I'm used to doing more of the rub thing on chicken drumsticks, which has more powerful flavor.
