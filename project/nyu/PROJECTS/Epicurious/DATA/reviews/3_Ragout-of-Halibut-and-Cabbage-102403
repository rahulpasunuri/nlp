I followed the recipe to the letter. This dish is simultaneously mild and flavorful. Simple and hearty, it's great for chilly autumn or winter dinners.

I've made the recipe twice and loved it both times--a good winter weeknight meal. It is easy and healthy and quite tasty. Though the recipe is for two, the two servings are quite generous--I've had leftovers both times. The second time, unable to find halibut, I made it with grouper. I think it was better with halibut, but the grouper was quite good too.

This is sort of like a light version of all those fall dishes I love using cabbage, potatoes and sausages. It's not going to be a bang of flavor in your mouth. It's comfort food. One thing I did change is to use vegetable stock instead of clam juice. I hate clam juice, it doesn't taste anything like clams.

We liked this dish so much that I gave the single serving leftover to our next door neighbour. He asked for the recipe
