I subbed spinach for the kale, used a bit more mushrooms - otherwise followed the recipe. Flavorful and delicious, would make again - yummy!

Nice consistency, easy to make, liked the combination of ingredients-but way t00 much rosemary for our group. Would have been fine without, and possibly even better with the addition of veg sausage. Will make those changes next time.

I hated this. It must be some weird thing about me, but the combination of mushrooms, tomatoes, and greens always tastes like vomit to me. I had hoped this recipe would be different but I was wrong...I had to throw this out :(

Love this - have made it with barley and once with lentils - both are delicious. The broth is very fragrant and tasty! Definitely one of my favorite soups.

Wow, this was such a nice surprise. Judging by the ingredients list, it seemed a little bit plain, but it turned out to be incredibly flavourful. I'll definitely be making again.

QUINOA, instead of barley, and it's a one-dish meal! Just make sure the quinoa is still al dente when you stop cooking...it will continue to soften a bit from the retained heat. I used one cup, and that was perfect. What a great recipe, and even tastier for lunch the next day.

This was delicious. Especially on a cold winter night. And definitely healthy. I added wine toward the end, like others suggested, as well as a dash of ground chipotle chili powder for a little smoky flavor. I also added carrots and used chicken broth instead of veggie for a little more flavor.

This was wonderful. I added one mild Italian sausage but I don't think it really needed it. I would add more leeks and maybe more mushroom and tomato or else use less barley just because I like the veggies more.

I love cooking stews especially healthy veggie ones. this one is a good basic start and totally depends on the freshness and quality of your ingredients. I'll keep this recipe in rotation, but know that I'll have to doctor it up. I added fresh diced avocado and it was delish. Cooking time needs to be longer for the barley to open up. Maybe make it 1 day ahead knowing it'll be super tasty the next day.

I added half a bottle of beer to add some oomph. I used cable car small batch pale ale approx $5 for 6 pack at whole foods. (it was what was in my fridge). Also, instead of adding all vegetable broth, I used some porcini bouillon cubes. I also added celery and Italian sausage.

Rating: 3
Tastes great and is an easy way to get greens into vegetable-haters in the family. I followed other people's advice and added white wine at the end and served with grated parmesan on top. Perfect for dinner on a cold night with some bread and cheese and the rest of the bottle of white wine.

Great hearty soup. I used beef stock and the fake beef bouillon and worked great. Beef and barley has the nice ring.

Really great - added a lot more leeks, garlic, and rosemary, twice as many tomatoes,. Used what I had on hand - shitake mushrooms and mustard greens, black barley. Also added dried urfas and marash pepper and parmesan rind to the broth. Topped with lemon zest and grated parmesan and served with corn bread!!

Rating: 3
Super easy and very hearty as is. Definitely add around 1/2 c white wine at the end if you're going to thin it (earlier if you're eating it right away and it hasn't thickened yet). No need to deviate from the recipe (can't even see what meat/pork products could add) but it obviously lends itself to improvisation. Served with bread, cheese and more white wine, it's a keeper!

Wow! This was superb. I made it as directed but added carrots for some sweetness and more color. Served it with romano and some hot sauce. Hearty, filling, delicious, and great for you to boot. Wow.

This was an easy & hearty weeknight meal, perfect for a cold night. I added a diced carrot with the mushrooms since it was on hand, and only had half a bunch of kale (which was plenty for me). The barley did take longer to cook - closer to 45 minutes as some others suggested - but the result was tasty. I didn't add extra stock and the consistency was nice and stew-like. Yum!

Wow! This is great. I'm not a huge fan of kale, so the amount was a little off-putting, but other than that, it was fantastic. I gave some to a co-worker and she immediately asked for the recipe.

Delicious! I added some old parmesan rinds that I had in the freezer and they rounded out the flavor of the stew.

This was delicious and fairly easy to prepare. I used Better Than Bouillion vegetable base for the vegetable broth and this gives a lot of added flavor. I did serve it with a little grated parmesan on top but it was tasty even without this.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I added in 1/3 or 1/4 cup white wine just before it was done cooking. It was yummy before that, but wine is never a bad thing. Also, I would suggest 1/4 the the mushrooms instead of slicing. They have a more robust flavor that way.

Rating: 4
The whole bland thing is eliminated by using the Rich Vegetable Stock (which I made over the holidays in abundance [for the Vegetarian Shepherd's Pie] and froze by the pint). It is on the Epi site and worth the trouble to make because never again will you have bland vegetarian anything which requires stock. This is seriously comfy healthy comfort food.

The only thing I changed was to use chili ready tomatoes and we loved the flavors. It was a very quick and easy recipe and I will make this dish often.

This recipe made for an absolutely perfect cold weather day meal. It was pretty fast and easy and just happened to be made up of all of the things that just had to get used up in my kitchen. Almost at the end of cooking I added just a bit (maybe a third of a cup) of white wine to add a little more dimension as well as a few strips of turkey bacon that I browned first and then added. The bacon was very nice but to be honest I think that it tasted just as good before I added the bacon. What a tasty way to eat my vegetables!

Rating: 3
Very rich-tasting, even though there's very little fat in it (1 T olive oil for the whole recipe!). I only made 2 additions -- a little worchestshire sauce, and a little white wine instead of water at the end to thin it a bit. I also cooked up some sliced turkey sausage and added that at the end (ok, that added a little richness too). So good that my husband asked me for the recipe so he could make it while I am away.

Rating: 4
I added chopped 6 oz. salted pork right before the leeks and 1.5 teaspoons smoked paprika with the garlic and mushrooms. It was AWESOME.

Rating: 3
after reading the reviews and noting some complaints about blandness, i decided to spice it up. i added about 1 T chopped chipolte peppers in adobo sauce. i omitted the rosemary and at the end, i tossed in a generous handful of chopped cilantro and a sprinking of lime juice and it turned out great..nice spicy flavor. i also used some smoked turkey sausage, adding that to make it a bit more meaty...very happy with the results.

Rating: 4
The proportions and cook time are right on, but keep the lid on the pot while it cooks if you want a product that is more soup than stew. Otherwise, a lot of the liquid boils off. But, the flavors and consistency are great. If your supermarket doesn't sell pearl barley, Goya brand barley (which may be 'pearl' although not stated explicitly) works perfectly. Great dish!

Rating: 4
Very tasty! I too grated fresh parmesan over top. Still I wanted a bit more savoriness (a nod to Umami) so I added a few shakes of Soy Sauce to the pot at the end....it went from delicious to incredible!!! I recommend this yummy, healthy recipe!

This was very easy and really good. I did use chicken stock because it is what I had. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. One complaint I have is that the barley actually took more like 45m-1h to cook all the way. Now I know.

I was looking forward to making this, and it was fun to put together. I added more garlic and a bit of red pepper, as some reviewers cited blandness, and I used chicken stock. The dish is good--wholesome and healthy. With a good dose of grated cheese on top, it's excellent.

Rating: 4
The only thing we altered: I got a 28 ounce can of tomato by mistake, so I used it all and I ended up using about 4 cups of broth. The barley took a little longer to cook than listed. The end result was a real stew (not a soup.) We did grate some Romano cheese on top. The rosemary was lovely. Everyone really enjoyed it and we will make this again.

Rating: 3
To avoid lack of flavor, I adjusted. I used fresh sprigs of rosemary, and 4 garlic cloves, 1 large leek (i would even use 2 large next time). When it was time to add canned tomatoes I used 3 x-large fresh tomatoes, Letting it cook for a good while until it formed a nice thick sauce. I added 1/2 serrano pepper and 1/2 a lime cut into slices, cooked in with the stew, added the kale for the last few minutes. Really perfect, I didn't even use broth, only 3 cups water since the tomatoes produced so much sauce. This was FULL of flavor and so nicely balanced. I think the only other addition I might try next time is some toasted nuts for crunch texture, Try it!

Snowy night here in Mpls - this hit the spot for dinner! I didn't have leeks, so I chopped one medium sweet onion and sauted with 2 or 3 sliced (on the bias) carrots and chopped celery, about 5 minutes. Then I added in the sliced mushrooms, 1 heaping teaspoon of Penzey's dried rosemary, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and sauted some more. I didn't use the tomatos. I added in 4 cups stock (had beef stock on hand) and 1/3 cup lentils and 2/3 cup barley. I didn't have kale, but would have used if I did. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 20 minutes. I topped the bowls of soup with fresh grated parm. Very good!

Rating: 3
Very good. I served it as a side dish and it was a big hit. I think we only had about 6 cups of kale (maybe even a little less) and I don't know that I would have wanted any more.

Rating: 3
This was pretty good and definitely gets extra points for being so healthy. If you soak the barley overnight and add the kale or other relatively tough green at the same time as the barley, the timing in this recipe works. I added some fresh lemon at the end. If I wasn't off dairy, I would definitely add some Parmesan or similar cheese. That would probably lift it into 3.5 fork territory.

Changes: Sub chicken stock for veggie stock, add 1/2 c. red wine, add 1-2 extra c. stock Absolutely superb and very easy to make.

Absolutely loved this dish!! In fact, my husband asked me to make it a 2nd time in one week! It's easy to make and very healthy. I added alot of pepper and more rosemary to make it more flavorful, but will try suggestions for adding carrots or use collard greens instead. I hope to see many more recipes like this in Bon Apetit.

I found this recipe on my iphone while rushing through the grocery store. Read all of the reviews and took some of the advice-- added about 1 C. red wine, and some extra garlic. It turned out great- not blah at all! Great texture and very savory- saved my night! I did end up cooking it for a full hour, which gave the barley enough time to get soft, and I substituted swiss chard for the kale. Served it with homemade sourdough bread and sourdough bread croutons, and some shredded parm cheese, which was a nice touch. Very hearty and very wintery.

I loved the simplicity and versatility of this recipe, and how good I felt after eating it. So healthy and tasty, with a nice balance of flavors and textures. I added carrots, burdock root, extra garlic, and a bit of hijiki seaweed because that's how I roll. My husband even added sesame oil and gomashio to his after cooking, which was super-tasty.

I liked this very much - it was hearty with an excellent texture. I used more garlic and leeks and at the end, instead of adding more broth, I added about .5 cup of red wine and stirred it through for about a minute.

Quite good, and the quick and easy moniker is earned. Not too many ingredients to pick up, and very easy for this non-chef to throw together successfully, to my and my friends' delight. I also used almost twice as much broth, and it was still fairly stewy. I used yellow onions since the store was out of leeks, and I also added lemon juice, a little wine, and some cayenne pepper. Healthy and full of flavor. Great for this weather.

This was all right. I liked the texture and another good use of kale, but the flavor was a bit blah, despite many attempts and suggestion to make it a little more exciting.

Rating: 2
While it's a breeze to make, it's not the most exciting dish I've ever had. The textures are nice, but the meal is somewhat bland, so try more spices. Some tips: 1. Barley should be cooked longer than the 20 minutes that is recommended -- try 40 to make sure that it's tender. 2. Instead of 2 1/4 tsps of rosemary,1 to 2 tsps should be plenty. 3. Kick up the spice level with either more garlic, more salt/pepper, some lemon juise and maybe a bit more olive oil 4. Make sure to cut the kale into bit size pieces. I simply threw a bunch of kale in from the bag and the pieces were way too big. Good luck!

Prepared exactly as directed. Wasn't sure what to expect in such a "healthy" dish, but was very pleasantly suprised to find something hearty and tasty. Rosemary notes are great and mushrooms bring a meaty flavor. It's cold outside and this soup warms you right up. I'll make it again.

I used spinach in place of kale. Delicious winter stew. Yum.

Rating: 3
I rate this just a smidge under 3 forks. It is a tasty but different take on a winter stew. I did notice that in the magazine and on this website, the ingredient list calls for "1 tablespoon olive oil, divided" yet the instructions only mention using the olive oil once (at the beginning, to saute the leeks). So I put the entire 1 tablespoon oil in the pot as I commenced making the stew. I made it exactly as stated; however since there are leftovers, I will take several reviewers suggestions and serve the rest with grated parmesan, some truffle oil and perhaps the dash of vermouth. I suspect these additions will surely bring my rating up to a full 3 forks!

Rating: 3
This soup has an amazing balance of savory flavors with the smooth mushroomey-ness complementing the barley consistency. Like many other reviewers, I added broth to taste (about 42 oz total) but think the dish could be equally good cooked down to a moist grain mixture.

Made this as written, except added more broth and topped with grated Pecorino Romano. It's a thick soup -- don't thin it out very much, you'll ruin it. This was perfect for a snowy night in Maryland. It was so good that, although it says it serves 6, 2 of us managed to eat enough that ony one serving is left for tomorrow.

I followed the recipe more or less as is, though I used a mix of crimini, shiitake, and oyster mushrooms. I also used one extra garlic clove. Definitely needed a LOT more vegetable broth (and I used some vegetable stock because it's what I had) - altogether I used probably 8 cups. I also added a bit of red wine. Overall I thought it turned out really well, though of course so far I'm the only one who has eaten it. I'd definitely make it again - very simple to make. Hearty enough to eat alone. Perfect for cold nights.

Very good! As it happens, I did forget about it while it was on the stove, so the barley was good and tender by the time I added the kale. Otherwise, I pretty much stuck to the recipe -- re: earlier complaints: it does say to simmer until barley and kale are tender and add more stock as desired, btw. I like the earlier suggestions for vermouth, truffle oil, and parm -- I tried the goat cheese, and think it would be better with a less creamy addition. But def v. good, and a wonderful veg meal, as is!!

MMMM, MMMM, MMMM!!! I made this recipe last night to serve three. It was a huge hit, and I can't wait to eat it again for dinner tonight! Thanks to all the comments, I made some changes to the recipe: Used TWICE the broth (8 cups)-- Added an extra garlic clove-- Used less rosemary-- Used Swiss Chard-- instead of Kale (Publix was out of Kale)-- Added red pepper flakes for some kick!-- Added half of a large shallot-- Used a little extra leek-- Used a half cup extra of barley-- Cooked the barley for 45 minutes (instead of 20min as the recipe says)-- This is a hearty soup that's filling, but not heavy in your stomach. I'm definitely going to make it again because my roommate will demand it!

Rating: 3
Very healthy and hearty! I made a big pot for some friends on a lazy Sunday night and everyone loved it. I agree with the below comments, it does take longer to cook then the recipe indicates and requires much more broth (I used chicken) I also decreased the rosemary and still found it slightly overpowering and added cheese on top, which was very necessary. I will definitely make this again!!

This was a good hearty vegetarian dish. It'll be one of my staples. I started by simmering the barley in the broth and let it cook while I sauteed other ingredients. I also blanched the kale before adding it to the pot because I was afraid the kale may emit bitter taste.

Excellent, filling, and healthy! The only change I made was to use 1 oz. dried mushrooms, rehydrated, instead of the fresh (to save a trip to the store), and I used the mushroom soaking liquid as part of the broth. I think this would also be good using farro instead of barley. Will definitely make again!

Provided you follow a vegetarian diet then this recipe as a base to start from is great. This stew was prepared two ways as my dinner guests were both vegatarians and meat eaters. With the vegatarian I made my own stock with carrots, celery, 1 sweet potato, 1 yam, onion and garlic with 1 gold potato. (This is my standard stock recipe.) Additionally, I added fresh tomatoes from my green house. Served with fresh green chili cornbread we started our meal off with smiles all around the table. Enjoy!

I thought this was a nice stew with substance, but not heavy. I used home made chicken stock and added a little water as well, cooked it longer than the recipe called for to reduce the kale and soften it up, so by the time I served it the barley was soft. I served with crusty bread and salad. I'll make it again for sure!
