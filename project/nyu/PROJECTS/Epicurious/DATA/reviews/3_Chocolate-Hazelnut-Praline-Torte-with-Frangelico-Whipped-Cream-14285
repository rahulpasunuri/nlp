I was a bit disappointed by this recipe. It turned out fine, but wasn't anything I'd make again. I'm not sure that the process of making the praline really mattered; I think the results would have been very similar just using hazelnuts and sugar.

I have made this at least four times. It is truly one on the most delicious cakes I have ever tasted, guests rave about it, and I yearn for it!!!

This is a great torte. It's easy to make, and is an elegant end to a dinner. It's not too heavy like some other tortes I've tried. Everyone I've made it for loves it.

Is there something missing in this recipe? There is no flour. This seems odd to me.

This is a great dessert! It's chocolatey, but not overwhemingly so. The praline makes it just a bit crunchy, which is a nice change. I made this for a party, and they liked it better than the other desserts!
