I made this recipe minus the fennel (didn't have any) and added sauteed shrimp. It was delicious! A good base to start from. Tonight I'm making it again and adding sauteed red onions and spinach. Roasting the pepper makes it especially tasty. I simply held it over my gas burner until it blackened.

Surprisingly good. I made this to the recipe except I didn't have the fennel seeds. Do the oil to taste it might be too much. Ground sea salt on top perfected the flavors.

My fiance and I had a fight tonight. I made this recipe and she loved it! I'm forgiven. That alone gives it 4 stars.

needs more of everything with flavor (capers, basil, fennel), needs less oil.

This is a recipe I have made over and over again, for family, for guests, you name it. It's really wonderful and really easy.

This recipe satisfied all my criteria: Satisfied my finicky vegetarian husband, allowed me to use up odds and ends I had in the frig, was easy to make and tasted great.
