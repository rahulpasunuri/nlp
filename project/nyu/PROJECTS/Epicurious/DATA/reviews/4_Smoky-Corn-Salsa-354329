I had to make a couple of changes to this salsa just because I didn't have access to two things. I could not find chipotle sauce (which was odd, since normally I have little difficulty finding ingredients), just ordinary Mexican-style hot sauces, so I used a half-teaspoon of ground chipotle peppers. I also do not have a grill, so I charred everything in a cast-iron pan. It's a very tasty salsa, but needed some salt and pepper to bring out the flavors (both of these are usually in hot sauce, so I suppose that's where they'd come in in the recipe as written). It's very good - we're having it with steak tonight, and I'm sure it'll go wonderfully with my leftover beans tomorrow.

I loved this salsa. I first made it to use up some corn on the cob that was about to go bad, and we used it to top tacos. The next day we just ate it with tortilla chips as a snack. They were both delicious. I made 3 changes to the recipe, based on what I had on hand. I only had 1 red pepper, so to add more veggies to the mix, I add 2 diced avacados. The second change I made, was that I didn't have green onion (I don't care for it that much anyway) and instead I grilled a half of a sweet vidalia onion, cut into two quarters. The third change was that I didn't have any chipotle sauce, so I used some Franks Hot Sauce and added to my taste. Fantastic!!!!

Love this recipe. but we make one change which we feel makes it better than original--instead of bottled chipotle hot sauce, we use the liquid and 1 pepper from a can of chipotle in adobe sauce. this is a small canned item in the mexican/hispanic section of the grocery store. it adds to the smoky flavor and improves the depth of the sauce. served tonight with fish tacos.

Not amazing, but very good salsa. Its versitile and is a refreshing departure from the normal salsa. I am going to make this again, but plan to try adding a grilled, (diced) tomato to it and see if it gives it a little bit more moisture.

This dish was great. We served it with burritos made from ground bison and it was a wonderful addition to the meal.

WOW! Great idea to bring to a party. I grilled the corn and onions but left the red peppers crunchy. Chipolte hot sauce found in the international section of the market. It makes a big difference. Oh - rave reviews from the teens in the crowd. YUM YUM YUM

EXCELLENT SALSA. I MADE IT 3 TIMES ALREADY. I TOPPED THIS OVER GRILLED CHICKEN, GRILLED PORK TENDERLOIN AND GRILLED FISH. THIS IS A KEEPER.

I'm making this again to serve as a tapas topping. Take a baguette, slice into serving pieces.Rub with a cut clove of garlic and the juice from a halved tomato and top with this salsa. Amazing flavors!

Delicious and easy to make. Great way to use up grilled veggies. Ours may not make it to dinner to go on the tacos!

Really great salsa. The grilled veggies give it a good smoked flavor. It also puts leftover grilled veggies to a good use.

Excellent salsa. My husband made it while I prepared the rest of dinner. We served with tri-tip, but it would be great with chicken.
