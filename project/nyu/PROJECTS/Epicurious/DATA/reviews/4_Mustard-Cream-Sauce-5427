Made this receipe using 1/2 c half and half, 1/2 cup 2 % milk and a touch of cornstarch to thicken, without the heavy fat content. It is an excellent sauce to add to many meats-- I have used it with a spiral cut ham and, and as a "hollandaise" for steamed asparagus. Very versitile, very easy, very flavorful.

This is very much like a sauce I make, except I add whole grain mustard instead of Dijon, and tarragon instead of the other herbs. I think I would use only 1 tablespoon of fresh tarragon, however, but since it's added at the end, you could add more if it tasted like it needed it. Other than those changes, the ingredients and method are the same. And you can use half-and-half if you want to cut back on the fat.

I did this for the Pistachio-crusted chicken with herbs recipe and it was wonderful. Make more, it is yummy. Fresh herbs probably make a real difference.

This has become a favorite of my family. I put the sauce together and in a separate pan saute scallops and peeled, deveined shrimp. I drain the shellfish and toss it gently in the sauce and serve over pasta. It rivals a favorite restaurant of ours! Even my picky eater children love this dish...

I didn't have white wine once so I used cream sherry and I thought it gave it a little depth.

PS-to my review-I put this in the fridge and used it on the bread for leftover ham sandwich instead of mayo. Wow. Now that is a great sauce!

Ok, am I the only one who noticed that this calls for 1C cream, reduced to 1C? Not possible! I used 1 1/2 cups and it was perfect. Let it come to room temp and served in a tiny pitcher with room temp Bourbon Molasses pecan glazed ham. Oh, my gosh. Nirvana! Drank a Mulderbosch Rose from South Africa with it, and it couldnt have been better. Our Easter company was very happy.

Very good. I doubled recipe to go with more meals in the same week. I thought the cooking time was longer than published to get to a thicker sauce. I used on pork roast one night and the next used in Smoked Haddock Stuffed Potatoes. I got the recipe from bbc.co.uk and it is fabulous. Basically just scoop out the potatoes from shell, combine smoked fish, mustard cream sauce, grated cheddar, fresh chive, salt & pepper. Refill and bake as usual. Superb!

I used this recipe for salmon the other night. Great compliment to the fish. Tasty! I tested a little of it before serving. I couldn't stop testing.

I've been trying to replicate the Linguine con Pollo I used to get at the now defunct Delphina's in Portland Or for years and this sauce is perfect. Saute chicken breast chopped into bite size pieces and steam some broccoli florets combine with the sauce over linguine add parmesan cheese and serve. I love it.

Very versatile sauce. I use it on salmon. Would also be good over beef (alternative to bernaise). Used more fresh dill than called for. Could try a little nutmeg. I am planning to try cutting fat by using half-and-half plus a little cornstartch.

YUUUUUMMMMY! Am calorie counter, so used low fat sour cream instead of the whipping cream and added after liquids had been reduced. Warmed up right before serving. Also, I forgot to buy fresh dill, so used dried. I may have only used a half tablespoon but can't remember for sure (Senior Moment!). Served this with another recipe from this site, Pork Medallions with Mustard Cream Sauce, which had great ratings for the pork and a mixed bag for the mustard cream sauce recipe that was suggested. Also, with this we served slices of zuchini dipped in egg and dry pancake mix and pan fried in vegetable oil. This reciped would be awesome with any deep fat fried vegetables (mushrooms, zuchini, cauliflower, etc.) I also plan to try with various types of fish.

Any idea how this would go with thyme-encrusted pork tenderloins? I'm looking for a sause to go with my favorite pork recipe. Thanks.

This is a great, quick sauce that works very well with pork loin. I used slightly less seasoning than called for.

Great sauce! I replaced the basil & dill with frsh rosemary. I poured it over pork tenderloin & served with baby red potatoes. A hit.

SOO EASY! Be sure to use whole grain dijon mustard. It makes all the difference.

Excellent! My boyfriend (who doesn't like mustard) hasn't stopped talking about it since we made it in December.

Excellent! I'll definitely make this again.

The recipe tells the cook to evaporate the liquid. It took longer than ten minutes and scorched my pan. Very confusing.

Great sauce for chicken.. Would work well with pork and lamb.

great recipe . you can also substitute no fat sour cream for the whipping cream if you want to cut the calories and fat content. Just add after reduction is done and slightly cooled .
