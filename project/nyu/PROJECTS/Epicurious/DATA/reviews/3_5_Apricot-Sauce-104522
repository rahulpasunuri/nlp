The only difference I make with this is to replace the vanilla extract with Grand Marnier. Then it tastes just like the apricot sauce I grew up with in Europe, which was always a staple with a turkey dinner(like cranberry sauce is here in the US). Not only does it remind me of childhood, but I've made some US converts!

Try this recipe with fried zucchini. It rocks. I promise.

This was awesome!!! You definitely have to refrigerate the crust a bit longer than 20 minutes. I had a bit of trouble peeling the 2nd piece of parchment paper off because the dough was a little too soft and stuck to it. Also - watch the tart as it bakes. The ends of the crust began to burn and I had to cover it with foil. The apricot sauce on the side was well worth it and the extra can be used for ice cream. I made this for dessert for our Christmas dinner and everybody raved.
