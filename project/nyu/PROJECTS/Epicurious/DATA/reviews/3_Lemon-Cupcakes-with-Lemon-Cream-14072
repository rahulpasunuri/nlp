These are alright.. I used the mixer instead of doing it all by hand.. added a bit of vanilla.. i think they are dry.. next time will add some oil... i doubled the recipe.. and was blown away by the 4 egg to 1/1/2 cup flour ratio.. I added poppy seed to the cream cheese filling and will make a lemon cream cheese frosting.. they are worthy of a try..

I clearly did something wrong, as these were light, tender, and delicious. I added a raspberry cream cheese frosting which really wasn't necessary with the lemon cream filling. As other cooks have mentioned, beating the sugar/butter in an electric mixer and then beating the batter is better than the instructions given, same with the cream cheese filling.

1.... i tripled the entire recipe to make a dozen. 2.... i doubled the amount of zest & juice (since i luv lemon). 3.... i made a double batch of the filling, as one review stated it needed more filling. 4.... the cook time was indeed longer. about 7 minutes in rental oven. be careful- the filling oozed out of top (too much) with extra bake time. this created unsightly crater holes in top. 5.... i did not measure out amount of batter as a base, but simply eyed guessing on size of baked muffins. 6.... there was enough batter & filling to make 4 more cupcakes (total 18). 7.... the cake was dense, even though i beat the batter a long time. does this have to do with the cake flour? i prefer a fluffy airy cupcake. 8.... i would certainly make the filling again. it was lovely and zingy, however i would find a better cake recipe.

I'm not giving this a "fork review" because I did not make the cream cheese filling. Instead, I made 6 cupcakes -- although they were on the small side; 5 would have been the right amount. Perhaps because I omitted the cream cheese filling, the cupcakes cooked in only 20 minutes (i.e., I did not have to increase baking time). I followed aliptac from SF's advice and beat the butter, sugar, and eggs with an electric mixter. The cupcakes were a bit dry and dense, more like cornbread than cupcakes. Other recipes, when scaled for this quantity, have you add 1/4 cup sour cream or milk alternately with the flour mixture. I have found that has produced much better results.

I would of rated this in the negatives, but they don't let you do that. One of the worst recipes of ever done, I would never do this again. With it only making 4 cupcakes, the recipe has you use hard to use mixing utensils and ingredients that don,t mix well or easily.

This is a classic epicurious recipe... great idea, but technique is from a real dunce. I wonder whether the recipe was written for an article on making cupcakes while camping? Seriously, making cake batter with a wooden spoon??? Beat the heck out of the butter with egg beaters, and again with the eggs, as readers have suggested, and the cake batter will turn out right. Also, beat the heck out of the cream cheese and it will lighten.

These cupcakes were pretty dang tasty. The cake itself was really yummy and moist, and putting the filling in the middle was much easier than trying to frost them. They were made even better topped with candied lemon peel and powdered sugar.

easy enough to make with the kids; i also doubled the amount of lemon juice and zest and whipped batter and cream cheese filling - they came out fluffy and delicious (kids loved them too)

Good receipe, only thing I did was add about 3X the lemon juice, and more zest.

Rating: 0
Although the yield is a bit smaller than a typical recipe...the flavor was FABULOUS! I will definetely add more zest next time because I really like a tangy lemon flavor. As for the cake part, I whipped my butter/sugar/eggs a little longer than usual based on the previous reviews and they came out fluffy enough!

I made this exact recipe and got enough batter and lemon cream out of it for 12 mini cupcakes and 2 regular-sized cupcakes. The cupcakes can easily be made lighter and fluffier by whipping the butter/sugar mixture until you think it looks good - then continue whipping it a bit longer. Do the same once you've added the eggs. The more air that is whipped into the eggs, butter, and sugar, the more volume you get; making for a less dense cupcake (if that's what you're after). My fiance loved these, and he's not usually big on baked sweets. The taste is delightfully tart, I will definitely make these again!!

The cupcakes were not light and airy, but quite dense... not the way I like them...

Let's see if I have this right. I dirty 3 bowls, 2 measuring cups, a sifter, a microplane rasp, a whisk, a set of measuring spoons, a wooden spoon, 2 forks, 2 spatulas, a knife and a 2 piece juicer and I get 4, countem, 4 cupcakes.

I made this in my brother's miniscule NYC kitchen. They were delicious! This recipe made 12 mini-sized cupcakes, and would make 6 full sized cupcakes. We added lemon flavored cream cheese frosting - yummy. We didn't bother with the exact 3T batter and burying the creme - we just put a dollop of the lemon creme on top. The better came out perfectly - we did use cake flour. We're making them again today!

I made these for a lemon loving friend's birthday - they were a HUGE hit. I found the cake to be a little dry and heavy, but she absolutely raved. I topped them with a lemon cream cheese icing, also from this site. They were definitely easy. Also, the recipe makes 5-6, not 4, as other reviews have mentioned.

I am not sure what I did wrong (or if I did anything wrong) but my cupcakes turned out pretty tough. I only baked them for 15 minutes and took them out when I tested them. The creamy centre was suited more to a bagel as indicated by another reviewer. I think there are fluffier, tastier and richer recipes out there. I will keep trying!

Rating: 1
I think I'm the lone dissenter here. I found the lemon cream to be something better suited to a bagel. It did not seem dessert-like at all to me. The cupcake itself was nice (27 minutes to bake, and I got four cupcakes total). I don't think I'll make again, though.

I really liked the recipes, I also had 6 cupcakes instead of 4 but the taste was good. I would just add more lemon juice to the batter because I am a big lemon fan!

I realy like it, it's great, in mine I did a mistake; I doubled the lemon juce witch make it alittle bit acid.

Gave these a go, and had made the mistake of not reading the reviews throughly- certainly needed to bake longer than stated. Made six cupcakes, but had to make a bit more filling. They were OK, and I might give these another go, but I found them to be a bit eggy tasting. Looked nice, and didn't have a problem with sinking in the middle.

TWO MISTAKES IN THIS RECIPE: The amount it makes and the cooking time. This recipe makes 5-6 cupcakes. Second, they take 25-28 minutes to cook. With these two notes, the recipe is wonderfully refreshing. I tripled the recipe and used the Kitchen Aid mixer to prepare the batter, scraped it into another bowl and then reused the mixing bowl to prepare the cream cheese filling. Easy and delicious.

These area nice little cupcake and the filling is a great touch. A must for adults occasions but my lemon loving eight year old did not care much for them. I did make six instead of four and still had to bake them an extra 8 minutes. With the previous review, mine did not cave in at all, they came out looking perfect.

I made these cupcakes the other day when I had a sweet craving. YUM YUM YUM and so easy! Thank you to the cook who suggested serving them sprinkled w/ powder sugar. That was a nice touch since they don't have frosting. My boyfriend and his sister liked them too, I am making them again tonight for a party. Hope the recipie triples well!

Did anyone else have a problem with these falling in the middle? They looked beautiful up until their last few minutes of baking (which was about 26 minutes for me). They taste wonderful and would be fine for home, but unfortunately i'm taking then to a casual dinner party tonight. i'll just have to make my apologies for their appearance since i have no time to make something different.

These are very good, relatively simple, cupcakes. I'm not too thrilled by they way this recipe was written (I found it a little hard to follow when running around the kitchen), but it worked nicely. I really liked how you bake it with the filling. As a nice, seasonal touch, I cut out harts out of paper and used them for templates and sprinkled powered sugar over them. Very persentable. I think I may try making this as a cake, I'll let you know how it turns out!

An update: used this recipe exactly and got two regular-size cupcakes done in custard cups AND one dozen mini-cupcakes. Baking time, however, was longer than I expected -- 20-25 for the minis and 30 for the regular. Check as they bake.

My husband was invited to an "office bridal shower". Everyone had to bring something so I made these delicious cupcakes. They were a HUGE hit not only with the women but with the men as well. (I always figured men for liking only chocolate!) I dusted them with powdered sugar and sent them in to the office - 8 hours later I got back an empty tray and requests for the recipe!

This recipe makes very moist, tender cupcakes. The cream cheese filling is a nice touch. You get the taste of cream cheese frosting without the mess --which is especially beneficial if you're transporting them.

Great! I used Organic whole grain pastry flour & crystalline fructose instead of sugar. My 2 toddlers loved themas did my sugar phobic husband. They were moist and very tasty.

Very good cupcakes which were also easy to make. I served mine sliced in half and slightly warmed with a side of vanilla ice cream because they were so lemony.
