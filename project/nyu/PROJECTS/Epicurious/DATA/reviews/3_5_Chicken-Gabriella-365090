Holy Moly is this awesome!!! I took a lot of the advice and made some changes: * Cooked onions first - got them good and soft then combined them with the chicken * Added three chopped garlic cloves to onions (pre-chicken) * Added sliced mushrooms to the chicken * Added oregano to the rosemary and sage pile and added all three to the chicken * Served with leftover wild rice and arugula salad * Used only drumsticks (3) and boneless, skinless thighs (6) * Added 2 medium chopped red onions also * Skipped the olive oil altogether (I was out) and used a few sprays of Pam

This is kind of an odd recipe. I agree with earlier reviewers that the recipe as stated really doesn't work. It's nearly impossible to get the chicken to brown in the same pan as the caramelized onions (I used the broiler like others have) and if the chicken being used has any skin on it, the sauce is likely to turn out excessively fatty. That being said, with a few tweaks, this recipe could be a decent weeknight dinner. I would use boneless, skinless thighs instead of the whole chicken and probably cook the onions down separately while the chicken gets browned, then combine them. Also, for something more sauce-like I would add a little chicken broth and something to thicken it. As I said, not bad, and the flavors are all classic, but the method certainly leaves a lot to be desired.

My sister made this for me with Arugula on the side. When we reheated it, we tossed Arugula (an entire bag) in and wilted it in the sauce - double A1 Delicious! I am making it tonight again with the wilted Arugula and have also tossed in sliced mushrooms. I think it will be best yet! Love that this is Low Carb by the way......

After reading some of the reviews, I cooked the chicken separately and then put in onions with the last batch of chicken. I also added thyme (had it in the frig). The sauce was amazing and great with rice. I steamed green beans with chicken stock and it made a wonderful meal Definitely a keeper and good for company!

I have cooked a ridiculous number of recipes from epicurious.com (and, have to say, am a pretty good cook) but I have to say that this one was not good. It was bland, and just boring. I would NOT cook it again.

I've made this four different times and I am an experienced home cook. I've come to the conclusion that you cannot get this recipe to brown the way it is described. The onions can carmelize but the only way I've been able to brown the chicken is to remove it from the pan and put it under the broiler for a few minutes. Otherwise, it is stewed and sorta slimy. The flavors are excellent and it is delicious.

We liked this, but didn't love it. It was fairly quick and easy, but I thought it was pretty bland.

This was an awesome and easy dish. It doesn't taste as easy as it is. I will definitely be making it again. Served it over a little ball of rice. I agree with everyone else that the sauce this makes is fantastic!

Needed to make something for dinner, lest I make macaroni and cheese Yet Again. Surfed Epicurious while at Whole Foods, looking for things that were labeled "quick," "chicken," and "main course". This came up with a pretty good rating and only 7 ingredients, several of which I already had! Score! So, it was ridiculously easy (as in, I could do the prep with the toddler underfoot), and especially given how simple it was, it was very yummy. This was not a fancy dish, but I've been having ideas of how it could be altered and maybe fancied up (shallots? bacon? mushrooms? wild rice?). I did add carrots, and I served it with pasta, which I decided really wasn't ideal; I think rice would work better for the sauce and the feeling, or maybe a very rich, eggy pasta. I didn't have time to read others' reviews or suggestions, but I will and see how I want to make it next time, because based on the reactions, I'm guessing that there will be a next time.

This recipe is fabulous!!!!! I love it,the only thing I changed was to use a whole preserved lemon cut in quarters.this will be my one and only chickrn recipe. Thanks a million for the recipe.

Excellent dish in no time at all. I added a teaspoon of fresh minced ginger for an extra hint of flavour and served it on a bed of orzo.

I've made this dish many times and its great. I use skinless thighs and drumsticks. The key is the brown them lightly, bake in the over, then turn to broil so that you can get more color on the chicken. Also, I use 2 lemon slices and allow that to cook with the broth. You don't need that much olice oil. using rosemary, thyme, sage and fennel seeds made this dish very tasty.

Left the skin on for more flavor, but still very very bland dish. Very surprising due to the amount of herbs required. If I made again, why probably won't happen, I would add more salt, less olive oil, and use a larger skillet.

This was just ok. I agree with the other reviewers that the sauce was excellent. I sopped it up with some homemade sourdough bread. However the chicken itself was just bland. I skinned it and browned it and then caramelized the onions. If I made it again, I think I will keep the skin on the chicken and season it well and then brown it. I think that if it is well browned and seasoned that the skin will not get rubbery as another reviewer said. I think that crisp chicken skin would add flavor and texture to the dish.

I wouldn't call this "quick" with the amount of chopping. To me this was just okay. I followed the recipe and instructions to the letter, except for the obvious olive oil typo. Nothing browned, it was more like the chicken and onions boiled. I would definitely brown the chicken first, remove and then carmelized the onions, add the chicken back, etc, if I ever make this again.

This was delicious and easy - loved that I only needed to use one skillet! I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and 1/4 cup olive oil. The thighs didn't brown as much as I would have liked, so in the future I may use a little less olive oil and/or brown the chicken and caramelize the onions separately before combining them/adding the wine. Served w/couscous and snow peas - sauce was awesome!

Delicious enough to serve to guests and quick/simple enough to cook on a busy weeknight. Definitely will add to my list of go-to recipes.

the beau and I both thought this dish was a little boring with the chunks of chicken but the sauce was very good! It definately needs a carb to soak up the sauce with.

Wow! Relatively easy to prepare - wasn't sure how to cut chicken into 3 inch pieces leaving bone whole. Used bone-in chicken breasts which I cut into three pieces. Used red onion which looked lovely on the plate. Tasted great. Lots of delicious sauce.

Excellent dish and easy. I served with thin roasted potatoes and a zucchini/tomato gratin.

Perfect weeknight meal. I thought the sauce was addictive and would definitely second the recommendation of serving with crusty bread to sop it up. Yum! Even my 3-year-old gobbled it up.

Wow, what a simple dish but oh so complex in flavor. I took the 1.4 cup of olive oil to mean 1 quarter of a cup, and it turned out perfectly. I doubled the recipe using 1 chicken and extra skinless boneless chicken thighs. I served for dinner for friends and visiting family to rave reviews. Will make again and again with no changes. Serve with a good bread to sop up the tasty sauce.

This was quite yummy. I took the olive oil amount to be a typo and only used 1/4 cup olive -- it turned out great that way. Take the time to really cook the onions, in order to caramelize them and develop the flavors! I am surprsied to see that someone complained about the skin, since the recipe calls for removing the skin from the chicken, (which I did). I just left those pieces whole but I did remove all of the skin! We made this last week and we are having it again tonight, for guests.

There must be someone out there who likes mushy, squishy chicken skin judging from all the recipes I come across for braising bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs. Funny tho' I haven't met a one. Next time I would use skinless chicken or just remove the skin myself. I suppose the skin adds fat and flavor to the chicken while cooking - the ONLY reason I can see for leaving the skin on in this type of recipe. Flavors were great. Pretty simple dish. The fresh squeezed lemon really adds alot to the dish - don't skip it!

Very good with rice and some crusty bread to dip in the sauce. And there's lots of sauce! I actually only used 3/4 cup of olive oil. Over a cup seemed like an overkill. Still yummy!!!

So good and so easy! I have to second the artichoke suggestion - I added a whole seasoned jar (no juice) a few minutes before the wine and they caramelized perfectly.

This was fabulous! I sprung for the fresh sage but used herbes de provence instead of fresh rosemary. Great with couscous! This is being filed in the "make again!" drawer...

Fabulous, but change it a bit, used 1 large onion cut into wedges (the root end still in tact) and 1 preserved lemon, cut into quarters, didn't have fresh rosemary and sage, used dried, Cooking just for one, so,used 1 chicken leg quarter. Will definetly make again, and again.

It is a great weekday dinner. My kids (age 6 and 9) loved it. It is a keeper. I added the lemon 10 minutes before finish.

This was a fairly quick and relatively easy recipe to pull off after work for a couple friends. The flavours all came together quite nicely and my guests commented on the tenderness of the chicken and the lingering flavour that kinda creeps up on you. The presentation of the dish is quite underwhelming as there are no bright colours to jump out at you. I recommend a colourful side dish to accompany the chicken on the plate. Overall a pretty good dish, I will make it again due to its simplicity and the unique taste. I am however only giving this dish a 3 fork due to the in accuracy or unclear measurements with the oil. 1.4 cups of oil? What it that? a quarter cup? It would be excellent if Anna Boiardi could clean up the measurement again. Thanks!

I added a can of quartered artichoke hearts, used dried rosemary instead of fresh, and served this over rice. It was outstanding! Incredibly easy, quick and delicious. I will definitely make this many times.
