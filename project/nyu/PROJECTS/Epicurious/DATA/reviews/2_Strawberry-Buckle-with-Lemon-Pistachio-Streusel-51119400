Just Okay. After reading previous review, I omitted salt from the cake (did use it in the streusel) and used 4 cups of strawberries. I made it three days ago, and there is more than 3/4 of it left. The blueberry nectarine buckle, also on this site, never lasts long.

I should have trusted my instincts on the 3/4 tsp salt called for in both the streusel and the batter. A misprint? The dessert was too salty, and the 1 cup of strawberries were barely discernible within the main cake, overwhelmed by the topping. A waste of time, effort, and good ingredients. Would never make this again.
