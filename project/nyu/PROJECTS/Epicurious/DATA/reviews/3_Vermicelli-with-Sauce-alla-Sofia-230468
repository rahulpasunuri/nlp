I was very disappointed with this recipe. Perhaps I overblended the ingrediants because it looked and tasted "murky", and rather bitter. I much prefer a traditional basil-garlic-nut pesto.

This was delicious, especially the next day. I used only kalamata olives, and omitted the anchovies. I used the linguine, and topped it with fresh ground pepper and parmesan. I've been eating it for days!

Delicious!! Very easy - my husband said the leftovers were even better the next day.

The flavors in this dish are subtle. Excellent taste and easy to make!

In our restaurant/Yoga & Meditation retreat at The Expanding Light @ Ananda outside Nevada City in Northern California I make a similar dish, but w/a vegetarian approach: substitute Kalamata olives for anchovies! I'm making this dish tonight for 50 guests. Grazie, Sophia!

I enjoyed this dish very much...I did change the green olives for black only because I prefer black olives. It also looks fresh and unique. You can't taste the fish in the dish by the way.
