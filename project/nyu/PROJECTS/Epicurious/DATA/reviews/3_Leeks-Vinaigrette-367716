I thought this was terrific and had not prepared leeks often. The white wine and eggs were fantastic complements to the natural flavor of the leeks. I would also use less water next time but lets not throw the leeks out with the extra water! And my food adventurous kids loved them, requesting them for Thanksgiving.

This recipe was such a disappointment. It is exactly something my family would flip over. Everyone took a bite and we tossed the rest. I am not sure what the confusion is over the water - you add 1 cup with the stock. I thought the recipe was clear on that. I would agree though that just the stock would be enough and probably give the dish more taste.

I had to re-read this recipe several times to make sure I wasn't missing something. The is no 1 cup of water called for in the recipe, but there is in the instructions. Maybe they meant one cup of water OR Chicken broth? Anyway, I made it only with the wine and chicken broth and it was heavenly. The leeks took on a natural sweetness I have never tasted before.

I made this recipe this afternoon for lunch. I LOVE leeks, with a passion, but this recipe almost ruined them for me. The egg mimosa topping was surprisingly nice. I had been worried about it since I am not usually crazy about hard-boiled eggs in my salads, etc. The problem wasn't the eggs, but the recipe itself, which, if made as directed, makes the leeks a bit soggy. I used medium to large leeks, and the exact quantities of ingredients called for. I would use less liquid in the future, especially the extra cup of water. One cup of stock is enough.
