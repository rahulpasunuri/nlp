I am loath to try anything with phyllo, but this didn't turn out too badly. Mine didn't look nearly as pretty as the photo here, but the sugar topping covered up a bunch of the flaws. It was quite popular (there is none left over) and I think I would do it again, perhaps using yufka to avoid dealing with the dreaded phyllo.

The cake received good reviews from my guests. The recipe was easy to follow however the phyllo dough I used was not the same size as the one called for in the recipe so instead of folding it in thirds I folded a third of one sheet over and alternated which sided I folded when putting to gether the 4 layers before rolling in the paste.
