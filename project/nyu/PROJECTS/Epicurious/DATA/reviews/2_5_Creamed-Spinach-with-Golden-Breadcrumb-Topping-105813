I added 4 cloves of garlic and sauted with onion. Baked whole recipe in large cassarole for about 90 mins. It really helped the flavor.

I usually like spinach but this dish was not very good!

I wish I could give this zero forks. The WORST recipe I have ever made from this site.

This made a big hit at our Xmas party!!Added pimento for a little red color. Thanks to the Kerr family for sharing from another Kerr family!!! Judy Kerr

This dish tasted more like a dip..Didn't like it that much, tasted too oniony (and I reduced the amount of onion called for in the recipe). Needs something, but can't quite pinpoint it..Definitely better spinach dishes out there!

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and am looking up the recipe again to make for this year. Those of us who like spinach thought that this was very good. The only change that I made was to saute the onions before adding to the spinach mixture.

I thought this was a great Thanksgiving side-dish and it will probably show up on the holiday table every year now. Even my step-daughter, a rather picky eater, has been asking for "that cheesey spinach stuff"!

I am surprised by all the bad reviews. I made this for Thanksgiving for an ex-pat group in Sweden and was asked for the recipe several times over. I halved the whole recipe except for the cheese and added extra nutmeg and pepper. I also cooked it longer than suggested - about an extra 20 minutes.

An unfortunate waste of ingredients, based on the amount I threw away after Thanksgiving. Too dry, too bland and too much raw onion for my taste.

Boy, I wish I would of checked the reviews before making this dish for Thanksgiving. What a disappointment! I am glad I cut the recipe in half since I ended up throwing away 90% of it. It wasn't creamy at all, it was dry and tastless and I love spinach. Oh well, you win some and you lose some, this was a definite lose.

I halved the recipe and it came out quite tasty. My only problem was that it had to cook 50 minutes instead of 30 in order to set and then 10 minutes cooling time was required before it was ready to eat. My boyfriend loved it, but was a bit miffed that dinner was late.

Disappointing. Didn't care for addition of sour cream.

No Good. Too dry. Didn't like it. Waste of time & money.

Glad I didn't read these reviews before making this. I didn't find it as bland as others seemed to. But I did change recipe somewhat. Added more spinach and 1/2 the amount of sour cream. Also used low-fat milk and only 1 cup instead of 2.

This recipe is a terrible waste of time and spinach. It was incredibly bland, and the cooking time is way off. I didn't think you could mess up spinach this badly

I made this for Thanksgiving exactly to the recipe and it was dry. No one ate it!

This was just okay, and not a hit at all over Thanksgiving. It was bland and the texture was not creamy at all! The raw onion flavor was a bit overpowering, as well.

I added an extra cup of cheese, more seasoning to taste,and doubled the breadcrumbs. It was very bland and watery out of the oven and recieved poor reviews.However the next day as leftovers it was microwaved and the same people loved it .This dish is better made the night before, cooked, refridgerated and re-heated the next day. Based on those changes I would definetly make it again.

I definitely agree with some of the cooks that sauteing the onions first is better. And I also used 1 cup cream and 1 cup of milk. Makes it more creamier and less oniony tasting.

This recipe was only okay. I love spinach, so I could eat the entire thing by myself, but it didn't seem to be a big hit at Thanksgiving dinner. I sauted the onions first, which I'd recommend, used a little extra cheese, and substituted skim milk for the whole milk. I probably won't be making it again, as my fiance won't eat it.

So far I have made this twice, both times using fresh spinach boiled for 30 seconds, and using cream where the recipe calls for "whole milk" with a slightly generous hand. I used half an egg for two-ish servings so if I were really cooking this for eighteen people I'd up the egg count for a lighter more fluffy texture!

This recipe was great. The one thing I would do differently is saute the onions before mixing into the spinach. I thought the onions were too crunchy after it was cooked.

Used steamed fresh spinach and halved recipe. It was fabulous. I don't even like spinach.

This was a hit at our Thanksgiving dinner. I forgot to include the eggs and it was still good! I would add a little more sour cream it tends to dry out slightly after baking (maybe it's because I forgot the eggs :)

Simply fabulous! I can't say enough about this recipe, except that even my kids loved it. I halved it and used regular cheddar and it was more than flavorful. And because it can be made in advance (always looking for a little help that way) I will definitely be making it again and again.

I made this last weekend and thought it was really good. It needs all the sour cream because I ran short and it was a little dry which was my fault. I think some whipping cream would have been good in it, too. Good flavor--my husband love it1

To the writer from NJ: Good grief lady, you don't follow the recipe and then you complain that it wasn't that great! Anyone who would substitute low fat sour cream for regular shouldn't be allowed in a kitchen anyway.

I did a test drive on this recipe because I thought it sounded good for T-giving, but I think I will try it again with some adjustments, because it wasn't that great. First of all, don't skimp on the sour crea,, I used low-fat and it wasn't as good. I'll use the real thing next time. Also, I would recommend using a lot more cheddar cheese than called for, and make it extra sharp as the recipe says. I used just Sharp, and it didn't come through well enough. The breadcrumbs were not bad. I quartered this recipe, and maybe in the translation, it just didn't work out as well, 18 servings is a lot!
