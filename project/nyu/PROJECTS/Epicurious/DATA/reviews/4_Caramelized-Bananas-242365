Because of weather, I could not grill these so the disappointing results could be from grilling on stove. My guests loved them, but I was disappointed by the texture of the bananas (mushy on outside, firm on inside)and lumpy caramelization. I served them with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce

Just like bananas foster. I didn't use the liqueur but did put it over a scoop of ice cream. So yummy!

Easy and amazing. I made just as described.

Make sure to use dark brown sugar and ripe bananas (just as they are begining to get brown spots.) 5 min per is too much for me. I do 2.5 min per side...just enough to brown. Sprinkle with Grand Marnier and I swear you will have a piece of heaven.

I have been making doing this for years. Now I see it as a recipe here. If making it for adults I use Frangelico.
