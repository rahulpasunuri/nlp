I made these (green grapes) as the centerpiece of a holiday cookie tray. They were a huge hit; healthy with a little sweet crunch. A dozen party-goers asked how to make them. Who knew something so simple could be so elegant? I just dipped the grapes in a deep bowl of pasteurized egg whites, and hand painted the topmost few, to save time. I tried them first with colored sugars, but they really didn't look appealing. Next time, I'll try a larger grain sugar, to really make them stand out.

I haven't made this yet... The reason in the past was because I simply didn't know how they got the sugar to stick to look like it was frosted!!! NOW I know how to do it and I WILL be making this beautiful and festive dessert this season!
