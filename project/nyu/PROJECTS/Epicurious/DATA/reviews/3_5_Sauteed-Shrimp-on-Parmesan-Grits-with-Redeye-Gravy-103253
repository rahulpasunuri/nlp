I didn't use ham, green bell pepper, or grits. I added garlic and used red wine instead of coffee. Brown rice. Oh and I cooked the sauce a bit longer then required. Came out good! Will try again with some ham and green bell pepper

I was disappointed with this recipe. Even with sausage instead of ham, it didn't have much zip. I added some vinegar which helped (lemon juice would've been better) but I still found it mediocre. On top of that, the coffee made the dish an unappetizingly muddy brown color. I'll try a different shrimp/grits recipe next time.

I am in my 6th year of retirement and I love learning to cook. Epicurious is Paradise for an aspiring cook. I took some liberties with this wonderful recipe. I used it for a ham steak only. Had to sub' roasted reds for the green pepper, used a red onion, and Merlot sub'd for the Maderia. Very good. My bride (of 34 years)loved it. I think I am a keeper. Thanks. Don

Wonderful dish. I operate a cafeteria in an office building in the city and my customers loved it. Don't be afraid of using shredded cheddar and lots of garlic for the grits. I used mushroom stock instead of chix broth. It worked well.

I was so excited to get this recipe for my favorite dish at my favorite restaurant! Making it at home the presentation was not nearly as breathtaking as at jack fry's, but the taste was not compromised in the least. It was fabulous, my date (who doesn't cook) even asked for the recipe. Put your hesitation aside and try this dish. You will be thrilled with this fantastic dish.

Traditional red-eye gravy is made with coffee. The coffee was made first thing in the morning, folks had a cup of joe and went off to do chores. The leftover coffee was used to make the gravy. Just a little food history.

Great dish! I was a bit concerned about the coffee! Strongly encourage usage of shitake mushrooms (pair nicely with the ham). I purchased a 1/4" slice of danish ham at the deli which worked well. If you like hot sauce, I would definitely double up the hot sauce on this recipe. I too minimized the amount of butter.

I also used regular mushrooms and about half the butter called for. We enjoyed the flavor of this dish. I especially like to cook with grits when potatoes get boring--I like to make au gratin potatoes, substituting white hominy for the potato. Anyway, the reason why this dish didn't get more forks from me is because of the color of it when it was done. Did this happen to anyone else? It was a brownish green baby poop (I'm sorry, but it was) color that was totally unappetizing. Other than that, it tasted great.

My family thought this dish was really tasty. I used regular mushrooms as I couldn't find the shitake but they would probably enhance the flavor. Only used one tbs of butter and cooked the shrimp in the gravy, the separate cooking seemed unnecessary. The cheese grits were delicious with the gravy, you gotta go for it. If you're not from the south, just pretend it's polenta.

I made the gravy the day before and added the the shrimp once I reheated the gravy. The flavours were rich and full. Top notch meal.

What a fantastic brunch dish! I served this to my "twenties" children on a visit home, and they loved the spice, texture, and uniqueness of this New Orlean's style dish. I, too, used half the butter, but we all added extra cheese on top of the entire dish for a creamer result.

This is excellent! I didn't use all the butter, but I did use plenty enough to feel guilty. Then I read the other reviews, and I agree completely. It doesn't need all the butter that it calls for. Next time, it will be fabulous without being too incredibly fattening! YUM!

I made this as an appetizer for our supper club's KY Derby Dinner Party, and it was a complete hit! I too used less butter than called for, but this didn't compromise taste at all. I have made it since, paired with a salad and french bread for dinner. Even my 6-year old liked it!

I made the dish with 1 tablespoon of butter, rather than the larger amount called for in the recipe. It was a very good creole dish. The children enjoyed it as much as I did. I serverd it over rice, rather than the grits.
