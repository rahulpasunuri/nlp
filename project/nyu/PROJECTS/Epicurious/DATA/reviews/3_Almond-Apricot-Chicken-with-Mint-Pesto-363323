This dish is absolutely tasteless. I was so disappointed. The stuffing needed garlic, breading needed something (cumin?) and pesto was dreadful.

"OH. MY. HEAVENS. This meal is absolute perfection." - those were my husband's exact words. "I can't think of a single thing I'd do differently." - me, verbatim. WOW. SO so so very good. We substituted out a few things so I wouldn't have to go grocery shopping :) Used mozzerella instead of goat cheese. Didn't breadcrumb it but instead, stuffed, spinkled remaining mixture on top, pam'ed le crueset, baked in oven at 375 for 35 mins or so (until golden edged). We also added a couple squirts of lemon juice to the pesto and served all over brown rice. GORGEOUS presentation and absolute PERFECTION. Wow, wow, wow. Can't wait to impress my in-laws with this one!!
