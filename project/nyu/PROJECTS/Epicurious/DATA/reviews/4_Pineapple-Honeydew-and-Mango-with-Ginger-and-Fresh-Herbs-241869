This dessert is absolutely magnificent. When I first read it I thought it would be really good but when I tasted it....the level of flavors...the delicousness of every bite...OUTSTANDING.

I used the mint (instead of the cilantro), used a dusting of sugar (instead of the honey), and omitted the seeds. I served it at brunch on a bed of baby spinach, with a dollop of Greek yogurt laced with sugar-in-the-raw. Very refreshing "fruity salad".

This is delicious! I left out the red bell pepper (it's literally the only food I don't like) and used the cilantro. Packed it into mason jars and took it to the beach. I've made it three times in less than one month!

Wow! This is exceptionally good. I was a little leery of red pepper with sweet tropical fruit, but with the basil and mint, and candied ginger, it was incredible! Served this as a side for Mother's Day brunch, and it was a hit. I omitted the cilantro and sesame seed, as others recommended. Can't wait to have leftovers tomorrow with yogurt. I think there's potential to use cilantro and jalapeno in this for a fruit salsa.

This is a very refreshing recipe for breakfast or for desert. I personaly like to start my day with fresh fruit every day. You can add plain yougart and make it your entire breakfast. Simply wonderful

After reading all of the rave reviews, I was pretty disappointed. I thought the mint, basil, and ginger flavors were overpowering and I didn't enjoy it. These are great flavors for a cocktail maybe, but not a fruit salad. A much better dish would have been the chopped fruit (pineapple, melon, and mango) left on their own.

Go with the fresh mint vs. cilantro and add finely sliced fresh rose petals for a beautiful springtime brunch/luncheon presentation. Make sure flowers are pesticide free and remove bitter white portion of petals. WONDERFUL!

I made this for a birthday brunch party and people absolutely loved it. Several friends asked me for the recipe and planned to make it themselves soon. The salad was really delicious.

Refreshing, interesting mix of flavors. I have prepared this salad when mangoes and honeydew were tasteless and yet the ginger and mint magically made it work. A favorite of all.

This was delicious and so refreshing. Chopped the fruit small as other reviewers suggested, which is a great idea since fruit in big chunks prevents one from taking bites that include all flavors, which is the point of a salad, isn't it? Used fresh ginger and omitted the seeds. Between the fruit and the dressing, there is a lot of juice to this salad, which you may want to drain off for better presentation (the juice is great to mix with champagne for a gingery, tropical mimosa, btw!). Guests at Easter brunch eyed this suspiciously, and didn't eat much of it. Think they just didn't get it, which was fine - more left overs for us!

Well, fruit salad can only be as good as the fruit, and my honeydew just wasn't any good. Other than that I thought it was really refreshing. I used lemon basil and mint instead of cilantro. The red pepper is a nice touch. I also left out the sesame seeds.

A perfect dessert--light, so flavorful, guests will be wanting more. And a great breakfast for the next morning if there are leftovers! I used mint instead of cilantro, and didn't do the sesame seeds. Everyone absolutely loved it, I will definitely be making it again.

Wow. Beautiful. Refreshing. Don't overlook the red bell pepper for color, crunch and contrast. Made a few hours ahead and it worked great.

We used mint and garnished it with mint sprigs. The red pepper makes it so pretty!

Delicious. The cilantro and pineapple work really well together. The basil isn't an expected flavour but it works really well.

Scrumptous and very refreshing! With fresh ripe summer fruit I omitted the honey and didn't miss it a bit. Added additional minced red pepper for the mild crunch. The fresh herbs and ginger make this so special.

This was more than awesome! It was an explosion of flavors that delighted my taste buds in every way! I served it in wine glasses for dessert that followed a salmon dinner.

This is so refreshing. I substituted simple syrup for honey and used a bag of frozen mango to eliminate some of the prep. everyone loved this dish.

I made it for my book club pretty much as written except I didn't have time to find sesame seeds. It was a huge success and everyone wanted a copy of the recipe. Very flavorful and fresh and easy to prepare.

Excellent concept, well proportioned. The sesame seeds are unnecessary and a distraction. Otherwise very good.

DELICIOUS! I replaced crystallized ginger w/ fresh minced ginger and omitted the sesame seeds. It was so refreshing and yummy I'm glad I made extra! I will definitely make this again!

This was interesting. I disagree that it makes a good dessert. I think it makes a much better side dish, which is how I used it. I followed the recipe exactly (used a combo of mint & cilantro) and served it alongside a Thai-style chicken dish.

I opted for mint rather than cilantro and it was a huge success.

we love doing fruit salad, and like it even better when we cut the fruit very tiny, something we first had in mexico. Out neighbour does it that way too and serves on top of crepes spread with your favourite yoghurt then rolled up - yummy
