I like that this recipe is so easy! It's not that much more difficult, but adds a lot of flavor, to use ground pork, veal and beef chuck, like this one: http://imunchie.com/cyndib/munchies/marvelous-meatloaf

I do not say this lightly, but this is the single most disgusting thing I've ever made from Epicurious. The hot sauce turned the meatloaf into a heartburn bomb. Zero texture or real flavor, just a hunk of soulless crap. If you care about your loved ones then for their sake move along to something else.

This recipe is fabulous! Bereft of all the ingredients, or time to make a grocery run, it's great even without the Worchestershire and with chili powder substituted for the American chili sauce. Perfect as leftovers on a wheat bread/arugula sandwich, as also suggested by the website.
