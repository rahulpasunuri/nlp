To the first reviewer...recaudo, reshmado...all this political correctness is driving me insane. STOP!!! This marinade is just plain GOOD! I did the Glass Skinned Grilled Chicken. It is insanely good! I used ground annato and skipped the soaking step. Worked out great! Like other have said, this would be great with pork and other meats too! Keeping it in the regular rotation

I thought this was a delicious marinade. I used it for the glass skinned chicken. I would like to try it on some other meats too though.

I own this cookbook. I used the recado for grilled squid yucatan style and chicken en molcajete. It's a delicious marinade. That's overnight on chicken (watered down with olive oil)then grill, and baste with grilled squid. Try it!

This was a very flavorful dish - not difficult to prepare at all. Definitely make it again ! I must correct comments made by previous "reviewer." Recados do indeed exist in Mexican cooking. It is a spice paste and comes in three varieties: recado rojo (red), recado de bistec (a dark green) and recado negro (black). If you travel to Yucatan, you can by them in the mercados. The paste should be rubbed into the meats - no need to thin - as a marinade.

The recipe needs to have more achiote, I made the recipe to crust a pork loin and wasted my time, I had to fix the recipe and added 4 times the amount of achiote, This recipe is a rub or a dry marinade, there is no such thing as RECADO, Recado means Message in Spanish, Recaudo in Mexican cuisine means A highly flavorful well seassoned broth and yes it is spelled RECAUDO, this was not a good recipe if you need good recipes get some good jerk or caribeann dry marinates instead or email me for some good recipes
