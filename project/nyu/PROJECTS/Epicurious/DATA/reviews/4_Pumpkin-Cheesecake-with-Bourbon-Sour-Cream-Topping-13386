I have been making this cheesecake since the recipe came out in Gourmet in 1990. It has been a great favorite with family and friends. This may sound like gilding the lily, but a little bit of leftover homemade cranberry sauce on the side gives a tart contrast to the pumpkin that is wonderful.

This recipe got rave reviews at my Thanksgiving dnner. I did alter the spices; I rarely measure my spices anyway and eyeballed them. I also skipped the topping altogether; seemed like guilding the lilly to me. Everyone loved it and now, two days later, I'm making it again!

Maybe it's my own tastebuds or a dislike of the bourbon and sour cream combo that makes me suggest skipping thw topping in this recipe. The crust and the cheesecake filling were delicious and successful. However, the taste of the sour cream rather ruined the overall experience. Another reviewer suggested adding vanila to the sour cream. Maybe ... or even a nice liquer. As is, I am going to remove the topping altogether.

I made bit-sized cakes in tiny paper cups with this recipe. After letting them sit over night, the crust was greasy and soggy. I took them all out of their cups and rolled them in ginger snap crumbs to "save" them. I sprinkled some with cayenne and some with cinnamon. They came out ok, but I guess you really need to stick to the large spring form to make this one work.

I've made a variation of this recipe for the last 4 or so Thanksgivings. It's awesome! As many have mentioned, it's not over-sweet, but rather a little more "adult" dessert. It goes really well with a glass of bourbon too. Anyway, the best improvement that I've made (but didn't see listed here) is to use store-bought ginger snaps in lieu of graham crackers with the pecans in the crust. Very festive!

I have made this recipe since it appeared on Gourmet's cover in 1990! It is a family favorite that always turns out perfectly. I use low fat cream cheese instead of regular. This is definitely worth making.

This cheesecake was excellent! We doubled the spices, as other reviewers recommended and tripled the bourbon. The one other change we would make is to put chopped pecans sprinkled over the whole cheesecake, as this will give it a good texture. This is definitely a seasonal hit and we will be making it every year!

I thought this was pretty good. Very mild, not too sweet. I could eat the crust all by its self! My husband isn't a big sweets fan but he really really liked this recipe. I added some cream cheese to the topping to enhance the flavor a little.

Absolutely divine! I made this gluten free, substituting the graham crackers with GF ginger snaps. I also cooked in hot water bath. I also added another TB of bourbon. Everyone wants the recipe now!

I had a terrible time with this cheesecake. When I poured the sour cream topping on the cheesecake it was like a volcano. There was a big hole in the top and even baking the topping didn't remedy the hole. It was like a big puddle of soup. I should have also followed the previous reviews recommending to double the spices. I too found the filling extremely bland and not terribly pumpkin-y. I won't bother with this recipe again.

Rating: 1
I was really dissapointed that I used my wonderful little sugar pumpkins and made such a bland dessert. The crust was the only part that I really enjoyed! I felt that the filling did not really have nearly enough pumpkin flavor (despite the wonderful pumpkin flavor of my puree), and the bourbon (I used my husband's expensive stuff!) didn't really shine. I will either find a different cheesecake recipe or return to traditional pumpkin pie.

I made this for the first time for Thanksgiving this year, and it will definitely replace my old pumpkin cheesecake recipe. I used Swedish ginger cookies for the crust, and used maple syrup in the sour cream topping instead of sugar (I am a Vermonter, after all). Otherwise, I made the recipe exactly as written. I also used a fresh pumpkin puree from a roasted pumpkin and homemade cream cheese. It turned out absolutely amazing.

As many others have mentioned, this has become a holiday tradition. I make this recipe with egg replacer, since we have egg allergies in the family. It has worked every time and rises beautifully. I too use extra spices along with a gingersnap crust. So delish.

I have made this recipe many times and always love it! Substitute ginger snaps for the graham crackers, gives the crust that special bit of spice. Once we were out of bourbon (my dad must have just visited, haha), and so I used kahlua instead...still tasted great, kinda like a pumpkin white russian.

I made this to take to a Thanksgiving dinner and it was a huge hit. I chose to make a gingersnap crust rather than graham cracker as I think it's a lovely compliment to pumpkin. I also did a water bath and had no problem with cracking. This was much lighter than your typical cheesecake which everyone loved...not so heavy after a big meal. I'll definitely be making this one again!

I just came home from yet another Thanksgiving where my contribution was this cheesecake. I have to say that it was the dessert hit of the evening. I didn't have bourbon, so I used cognac this time, and it made no difference whatsoever in the outcome. I've been making this dessert since 1990 and it is absolutely the best holiday cheesecake out there. Just be sure to wrap the outside of the pan in a couple of layers of aluminum foil to catch the leaking syrup.

Just made a large & mini taster version of this. Outstanding!!!! I used gingerbread crust, doubled spices, tripled bourbon. Used 16oz of cream cheese & 8oz of marscapone. will use 16oz of marscapone & 8 of CC next time.I, also, made a marshmallow SC topping, nicked from another recipe, added bourbon. Just absolutely fabulous, to die for cheesecake. I did use a water bath just because. No problems with cracking, cooked in 1 hr.

Some deflating will happen as it cools but there are a few things you can do to help avoid the significant deflate and crack. The first is don't overbeat your batter. Blend till it is combined but don't overmix. Baking in a water bath will help ensure even baking and when its done (or sometimes I'll do it when it is just slightly underdone) turn the oven off and crack the oven door. Leave the cheesecake in while the oven cools down. This will result in a slower cooling process and your cheesecake will be less likely to crack. GREAT Recipe. For thanksgiving i'm going to substitute sweet potatoes for the pumpkin for something new :).

This was delicious. Only 2 things - advice would be appreciated. The cheesecake rose beautifully in the oven but one I took it out to cool before adding the sour cream it deflated about half and inch. It also cracked. Any tips to avoid both from happening?

I have been making this for almost 20 years and it is my favorite holiday dessert. The only change I make is to the crust. i do not kike a sweet crust so I double the grahm crackers, nuts and butter in the crust and add only 1/4 c brown sugar (no other sugar).

This cheesecake was so simple and so de-lish. I just wanted a plain pumpkin cheesecake so I left out the bourbon and the topping and it got rave reviews at our Thanksgiving dinner. Everyone really loved the crust. After reading other reviews on this site, I decided to bake it in a water bath and I increased the bake time to almost 2 hours. I checked it every 15 minutes or so until it looked done. It came out absolutely perfect with no cracks or anything! I also think in the future I might bake the crust first for around 15 minutes because the filling did make it a little mushy....still, it was delicious and I will definitely make it again!

I found this recipe years ago in a country living magazine and have been baking it every year for thanksgiving since. Anyone that's tried it said I should sell it thats how good it is....it's not easy to make I can tell you that but it's definatly worth it and worth the expense as well.

We have made this pumpkin cheesecake every year since Thanksgiving 1990 -- it has become a signature dish for Thanksgiving Dinner at our house. However, for the last few years, we replaced the graham cracker crust with one made from gingersnaps. Unlikey! But the cheesecake freezes well -- cut slices, spread slightly on the bottom of the springform pan and freeze. When firm, wrap each slice and put back in the freezer in a freezer bag. Simply replace graham crumbs with an equal amount of gingersnap crumbs. The crust stands up to liquid better and keeps the crust from becoming soggy if you have left-overs.

I first made this recipe for Thanksgiving Nov 90 and have made it for many Thanksgivings since them. I have even made it and shipped it from Cape Cod, MA to San Diego, CA for my niece. I am planning to make it again this year. It is always a hit and always comes out perfectly.

I wish I had read the review of "a cook from Colorado Springs" prior to baking this... It's 4am, and here I am, baking a leaky cheesecake...at the end of October with all of the windows open and fans blowing...desperately hoping the smoke detectors don't go off and freak out the neighbors and smoke out my blue-and-gold macaw who's sleeping in the other room... This could turn out very, very bad... On the bright side, the batter was really tasty... I'm keeping my fingers crossed!

Another cook from Boston who mourns the loss of Gourmet. I also have been making this recipe since it was first published. It makes my girls want to come home when I tell them I'm making it. Use fresh pumpkin, not canned, and freeze any extra so you can make it again at Thanksgiving or Christmas. I'm not much of a baker except for this recipe.

With a heavy heart, I write my first Epicurious review, having JUST learned today of Conde Nast's decision re Gourmet magazine. The pumpkin cheesecake with bourbon sour cream was the first ever "fancy" dessert I made in my adult life...I remember taking great pains to duplicate the cover photo from the Nov 1990 issue EXACTLY. The cheesecake was perfect: creamy and spicy and sublime and consumed in an instant. I would not change a thing. Long live Gourmet, forever in our collective bakers' hearts! (SIGH...)

I made this recipe the first year it was published in Gourmet and it has become a tradition ever since. The fun is that it's really an assembly process, easy to do and it gets raves every time.

one of my favorite holiday desserts. what's not to love about pumpkin cheesecake. the topping is fantastic- i didnt overdo it. i also used a modified crust by using a pre made graham cracker crust and then topped it with the pecans/sugar/butter mixture as a layer on top of the graham cracker crust.

Rating: 0
Just a note: I did not make the sour cream topping, nor did I have any burbon in the pie at all, which makes me very sad, my the adjustments I made based on the comments before made for a great pumpkin cheesecake nonetheless. Instead of using 3 packages of cream cheese like this recipe calls for, I used two and folded in some whipped cream. I also used gingersnap cookies and crumbled them up into the filling since I neglected to make a crust. It turned out very light and airy and I threw on some more gingersnap crumbles that I mooshed with honey and it turned out quite well! It didn't end up being the same recipe at all, but it was tasty!

Very good. Not out-of-this-world, but quite enjoyable. I used gluten free ginger snaps in the crust instead of graham cracker crumbs. That was delicious! I didn't feel like the bourbon added much to the topping, even though I doubled it. I wish I hadn't spent the extra money for the alcohol.

amazing recipe. yummy. but i advise putting foil or a foil lined baking sheet underneath while baking-- the first time i made it, butter leaked out of the springform pan from the crust and smoked up the house!

This cheesecake is fabulous! I took a lot of hints from the comments, and it came out absolutely... fantastic. I used ginger snaps for the crust -- took a double handful of cookies along with a handful of pecans and threw them in the food processor, easy as that. I cut the butter in the crust by about 25%, so 3 tbsp. Prebaked 15 minutes at 350, came out perfect. I was liberal with the spices for the pumpkin filling, and I think it came out perfect. Probably half again as much cinnamon, nutmeg, etc as called for. Perfect. I used Bailey's Irish Cream instead of bourbon, as that's what I had on hand, and the flavor works great. Another change I made to the topping was to grate a bit of fresh ginger into the sour cream mixture. Everyone loved it -- the zing compliments the sweetness of the filling, as well as the ginger in the crust and filling. All in all... Four forks. Simply incredible, and I'll be making another for Christmas.

I first had this shortly after the recipe came out in Gourmet at a potluck. I was one of about 30 people who asked for a copy of the recipe. I have made it at least once every year since. I prefer fresh ginger to grated (so double volume). That's the only change I have in 25 or 30 times making this (not the only attempt, just the only keeper). Canned pumpkin works better than roasting. A little carmel drizzle on top is not necessary but adds to the appearance. Glad to find it here because I am trying to plan my Thanksgiving shopping list while on a conference call at work.

We've made this countless times. It never fails to impress. Use good stuff like Makers Mark for the "bourbon" and don't skimp! I've found it takes a bit longer in the oven to actually set. Devine!

This truly is delicious- creamy, fragrant, perfectly spiced and just sweet enough (the sour cream topping, a touch tangy, really balances the sugar). And of course, lest too much attention go to the cake alone- the crumb crust is (with one - two tbsps less butter) PERFECT!! I added caramel, nuts and chocolate chips to the top- ridiculous I know, but go big or go home! :-) For anyone feeling skeptical...this is definitely worth making :-)

This has been my go-to thanksgiving recipe for over 5 years. Everyone raves about it, but I usually warn people that the topping is sour cream as it can be jarring to take a bite expecting whipped cream. The crust does "leak," but I just wrap the springform pan in foil and live with it--its worth it!

btw ... cracking of the top is caused by cooling too quickly. If you turn off the oven a couple minutes early, open the door a stich and let it cool in the oven it will have a better chance of not cracking.

Always a classic. I prefer a cream cheese top rather than the sour cream (1 package CC instead of sour cream). Other than that, used ginger snaps instead of graham for the crust and baked it for 10 min to give it some texture.

This is a great recipe. I also increased the spices, which is terrific. Once I made it without squeezing out the excess water from the pumpkin and then again squeezing. It was much better with the less water. I didn't do the waterbath, and it was just fine both times. I also used the convection feature on my oven though...

I made this lovely little number for Thanksgiving and what a hit! At another user's suggestion, I reduced the butter in the crust, but only by a smidge. I also roasted the pecans prior to using them by tossing with a couple tbs melted butter and some sea salt, then roasting at 350F for 15 min -- a step well worth the extra effort (I will never buy pre-roasted nuts again). The next time I make this cheesecake, I'll also increase the bourbon in the topping by 1 tsp for a little more zing. Overall, what a beauty! Everyone loved the way that the three layers were decreasingly sweet: against the candy-like crust, the filling seemed mildly sweet while the topping seemed to loose it's sweetness altogether, bringing out the tang of the sour cream and bourbon. Furthermore, the textures were fabulous. The crust was alternately crisp (it reminded me of praline) and moist with its own syrup, the cheesecake was both dense yet fluffy and the topping was smooth and subtly springy. Delicious!

This was a fantastic tasting and impressive looking cake. It was met with rave reviews by everyone at our Thanksgiving dinner.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year (2nd time) since we don't like pumpkin pie and it was a major, major hit!!! I was in a major hurry and put all the ingredients in at once in the Kitchen-aid. However, the texture turned out great and I particularly liked that the cheesecake wasn't too sweet. I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and like the previous reviewer, I used gingersnaps in the crust. My cheesecake cracked (next time I will do a water bath like the previous reviewer) and since I absolutely hate sour cream topping on cheesecakes, I covered mine with light cool whip (wanted something lighter than whipped cream) and everyone thought it was the perfect combination. My husband asked that I make this every Thanksgiving and I think we have a new tradition! Serve with coffee.

This cheesecake was EXCELLENT! I used gingersnaps in the crust and walnuts instead of pecans because that's what I had in the house. I doubled the spices and it was on the edge of being too much so next time I will use one and a half times what is called for. Also, since I didn't have pecans, I garnished the top with the leftover gingersnap crumbs from the crust. I kept a pie tin full of water on the bottom shelf of the oven and had no cracks in the top. I did have to cook it for an extra 15 minutes or so, but don't know if that's because I am at altitude. Will make this one again!

I tried making this 3 different times now, and using the original and making adjustments and replacements just didnt work for me, or any of my testers. The pecans were too raw each time, and created a bad taste sensation in 3 peoples opinion (out of 6). The crust never stayed together (maybe egg white would help?). Overall, it was just too sour, and neither here nor there in the pumpkin category or the cheesecake category. It was a hard sell to my friends. It is a good thing I tried it out in advance! Im sticking to a standard pumpkin cheesecake recipe this year.

I've made this for Thanksgiving and Xmas every year for the last 7 years. Everyone enjoys it and it is easy to make. TIP: Cut the margarine in the crust by 1/2. If you don't eat it all right away, the crust gets soggy and greasy. TIP: I also double the cinnamon because I like the spiciness.

I've make this cheesecake MANY times since 1990 - always to RAVE reviews. This is the one thing my Mother-in-Law has requested I bring to Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner EVERY year. However, having family w/nut sensitivities, I have left the nuts out of the crust (just added the same measure of extra graham cracker crumbs instead) and off the top. I've also been substituting 'Bailey's Irish Cream' in place of all the bourbon in the recipe. It gives both the cheesecake and topping a much more subtle 'liquor' flavoring that is quite pleasant and very complimentary. I haven't tried ginger snaps for the crust yet but it sounds like a YUMMY alternative.

My favorite cheesecake..I'm not fond of dense, heavy cheesecake or overly sweet desserts. I use the entire can of pumpkin (closer to 2 cups), use 3 T of flour instead of cornstarch, organic sucanat instead of white and brown sugar, 1 1/4 C gingersnaps and half the sugar for the crust, and bake it in a 10" pan. To be time and space efficient, I throw all the filling ingredients in a blender.

No Fail recipe. I made this for the first time last year before Thanksgiving and made it about a dozen times between then and Christmas. I followed the advice of others and used ginger snaps instead of graham crackers, and doubled the amount but NOT the BUTTER! The sour cream topping did not seem to add much of anything so I used a combination of rum and cointreau with a little orange zest along with the pecans (to the topping) and that added a freshness to it. I think I will try a ganache next. The basic recipe is so good that no matter what you will have a great and memorable dessert.

I have made this cheesecake probably 30 times since the first publication in 1990. Last weekend I made it for unexpected guests. I had everything on hand except the pecans. With no time to go to the store, I just made the basic graham cracker crust recipe found on the box. The results were FABULOUS and so easy that I will make that crust from now on, maybe adding a few chopped pecans or gingersnaps. However, without the pecans for decoration, the presentation wasn't the same. I won't skip that step again if I can help it!

After all the rave reviews, I had to try this recipe. It made the menu for Thanksgiving and was everything you great cooks said it would be! WONDERFUL! I doubled the crust as suggested by some but shouldn't have doubled the butter. Despite the overkill on animal fat, it was SO delicious that only a slice was available for leftovers. I will absolutely make it again. All ingredients at room temperature definitely made for less mixing and the result was not a hint of a crack in the top. Hurray!

Found this recipe and decided to make it for Thanksgiving this year. I had now idea it would be such a big hit! Was told by a couple of people that it was the best cheesecake they have ever had. Made a few changed per some of the previous reviews. I had doubled the crust and made it half grahm-cracker and half gingersnap crust without doubling the butter, instead of rum, I used some of my portuguese grandmothers home-made anise, and I sprinkled some of the remaining crust and crushed pecans over the top after it was done. It was excellent! Definately a keeper recipe for the holidays. Thanks epicurious!

I made the cheesecake and it was wonderful. I added twice the amount of bourbon to cake and sourcream topping. I also adjusted the time as suggested by another by first at 425 and lower to 350. I live in Holland so I used ground Dutch speculaas (like gingersnaps) in both the crust in ground with pecans as a topping, it was great. I agreed with everyone, too much butter in the crust, I would decrease amount next time.

I have been making this recipe every Fall since it was published in 1990. It is an often asked for request for family gatherings. I recommend making it at least 48 hours in advance so that the flavors have time to blend and come out and the cheesecake has time to set and mold. When travelling far distances, I do not use the topping, I cart it in the pan and remove the sides when ready to serve. I sometimes just use cool whip with a little shot of bourbon and the pecans. When making the topping, I make the cake 48 hours ahead and frost it the night before I'm going to serve it.

I wish I could give this 3.5 forks...OMG It was GREAT!!!! I did follow the advice of other reviewers and doubled the crust recipe but kept the butter at the same measurements.....It was very buttery...I also used mostly gingersnap crumbs and WOW :) I did not have bourbon so I used Appletons rum in the cheesecake and Grand Marnier in the topping.

I made the following changes with great success: (1) used a gingersnap cookie crust; (2) baked the cake in a bain marie (water bath) sealing the springform pan with heavy-duty foil; and (3) substituted Meyer's Dark Rum for the bourbon. This cheesecake is very rich but not too sweet. Best served in small slices - although I've had people ask for seconds!

This is one of the best cheesecakes I've ever tasted! I've made this twice now, once using bourbon and once not. In both cases rave reviews followed. In addition to reducing the butter in the crust, I found that pre-baking it for about 15 minutes was helpful.

Delicious and excellent! I can't wait to make it again..(after some hard exercise.) The reviews and hints are so helpful and I appreciate Epicurious so much for this excellent site. I did forget to decrease the butter in the crust but fortunately I had purchased a new springform pan (from Williams-Sonoma) that was called "leak proof" which it really isn't..it just runs outside of the pan into a crevice but that helped keep it from running into my oven. My daughter took the little bit of leftover cheesecake to work the next day and everyone hunted her down and asked her "What was that?"..they said it was so good! And it truly is!

I got tired of pumpkin pie for the holidays and decided to make this pumpkin cheesecake, since I had all the ingredients in the house. All I can say is that's this a recipe to die for, the best cheesecake I have ever had, including at restaurants. When I make it again, I will add a bit more bourbon to the cheesecake & the topping. Also, I might use chocolate graham crackers or chocolate wafers for the crumbs, and I might drizzle some melted chocolate over the sour cream topping at serving time. And I would definitely make it again, even though I don't have a stand mixer.

I make this 3 or 4 times every Holiday Season and I love it. It has a wonderful flavor and very creamy consisancy. I use a bit more bourbon in the topping and sub crushed gingersnaps with ground pecans for the crust. Sometimes I drizzel homemade caramel sauce on top. The caramel recipe with the "pumpkin bread pudding" recipe on this site is THE BEST and very easy to make.

A wonderfully simple cheesecake, which might be why I didn't think it was outstanding. I couldn't taste the bourbon in the icing, not enough spices in the pumpkin layer, and FAR too much butter in the crust even though I halved it. The texture, however, was perfect and the presentation was lovely!

Delicious and creamy. Perfect for Thanksgiving. I halved the recipe and made it in a 6" springform and it came out beautifully. The reviewer tips were extremely helpful. I took their advice and made more crust, doubled the spices, sprinkled chopped pecans under the topping, and reduced the butter to avoid any seepage or sogginess. No problem with a water bath and 18" heavy duty foil. I'll certainly make this again, but we really couldn't taste the bourbon so I'll skip that and the topping in the future.

Deliciousand creamy! Perfect for Thanksgiving. I made a half recipe in a 6" springform and it came out beautifully! The reviewer tips were extremly useful. I took their advice and made more crust, chopped the pecans and sprinkled them under the topping, doubled the spices and reduced the butter so it wouldn't leak or get soggy. No problem with the water bath and heavy duty 18" foil. I'd certainly make this again, but we couldn't really taste the bourbon so I'd probably skip that and the sour cream topping next time.

REALLY good, but I think it could use more pumpkin & bourbon next time... I baked it at 350 for 1 hr, 15 minutes (maybe it's my oven) not in water bath but had a pan of water in the oven for steam. Added more vanilla, and about a pinch or so more of the spices. Also added vanilla to the sour cream topping... I'm looking forward to making this again! Everyone loved it!

Everyone loved this cheesecake during Thanksgiving. I'm not a fan of pumpkin pie but really enjoyed this. I doubled the crust and used 6 tbsp. butter. Used 1 tbsp. to grease the springform pan. Baked the cheesecake at 450 for 10 minutes with a pan of hot water on the lower rack. Turned the temp. down to 350 and baked it for another 1hr 15 min. No cracks, turned out wonderfully. Candied some pecans to decorate with and crushed the rest to sprinkle on a simple vanilla bourbon whipped cream. Will definitely make again.

Yummy with a capital Y!!! The only three things that I changed were the following: 1) Increase the crust!!!! The crust is undoubtedly the best part, and the above recipe only makes a very thin layer of crust. Make 2 times what the recipe calls for, except for the butter which you shouldn't double (you can just use the 1/2 stick of butter or increase to no more than 3/4 stick). Otherwise, you'll have a pool of butter leaking from the pan. 2) MIX IN GINGERSNAP COOKIES!!!! Make sure you use a 50-50 mix of gingersnap cookies and graham cracker crusts. Just today I won a contest at my office and people kept asking about the crust. It gives it a totally unique and scrumptious flavor! 3) GARNISH!!! If you're looking for a showstopper, it's fun to use something other than just nuts. I used chocolate leaves! Enjoy this divine dessert!

This was the 2nd time that I made this cheesecake; the first time I followed the recipe exactly except for doubling the crust and the spices (nutmeg and cinnamon); the crust was soggy! However, it was still a delicious and spectacular cheesecake!! This time, my 2nd time, I did all of the above except I did not use brown sugar in the crust( just extra white sugar). And, I cooked the cheesecake for 10 minutes in a preheated 500' oven.. then I turned down the heat to 250' (leaving the oven door open until the temp. dropped )and cooked for 45 minutes longer. This kept the crust from being soggy, kept the cheesecake from cracking and made the cheesecake denser (instead of mouse-like) Yum!!!! I also followed other viewers suggestions by doubling the sugar in the sour cream topping. Thanks Epicurious!!!!

Rating: 4
This cheesecake is delicious!!! I've been making it since it was originally printed and everyone raves about it every year. It does tend to leak and it helps to cover the bottom in foil and to make one and a half times the crust (but not the butter). There is never any left over!!!

After reading the other reviews before making this cake, I made the following modifications. The results were "Super Fantastic!" Not having bourbon I used Tuaca instead, and alot of it! In the cake I used 1/3 cup and left out the cream. I also added 1 tsp. more of cornstarch, no white sugar only lt. brown, and much more seasoning. This I did not measure, just made to taste. In the topping I again used Tuaca 1/4 cup, lt. brown sugar instead of white and added a small amount of corn starch. It was very hard to let this cake rest over night! It smelled so good while it was baking! Oh, I also added cinnamon and cloves to the crust along with extra graham cracker crumbs. I baked the crust for about 10 minutes at 350 then slightly cooled it before filling and baking the cake.

My mother hates pumpkin pie but loves this cheesecake, so I've had to make it for Thanksgiving EVERY YEAR since it first appeared on Gourmet's cover in 1990. Other cooks may have tweaked the spices with good results, but whatever you do, don't skip the bourbon!

I've been doing this recipe since 1990. It's a command performance for both home and office. I only use half the butter for the crust. You might add additional nutmeg and ginger as it may be bland for your tastes. Garnish with pecan halves. "DON"T FORGET THE BOURBON" and I don't even like the nasty stuff. A bowl of water in the oven does work well.

For the first time since it appeared on Gourmet's cover in 1990, I did not make this cheesecake for Thanksgiving this year, and my family was really upset with me. I have been asked by friends for the recipe over and over again. It's easy and beautiful -- everyone will think you paid a fortune at a specialty dessert store. (Tip: Before baking, wrap your springform pan with foil -- as the crust bakes, the butter and sugar create a "syrup" that will leak and cause smoking in the oven.)

Years ago when this first appeared, I made it. It was the first cheesecake I ever made and the pumpkin so balances the cheesy intensity, it's a keeper! Thia year I'm growing "Cinderella" Pumpkins and I hope to use the flesh for this recipe. Made this in a vacation rental overlooking a small rocky Pacific cove in Fort Bragg, CA and I'll never forget it.

Made this for Christmas dinner. I've made loads of cheesecakes but this one was disappointing. The crust dripped and leaked, even though I pre-baked it for 15 minutes and lined the pan with foil. The pumkin cheesecake part was okay, and everyone thought it was good but I wouldn't make it again. There are so many better cheesecake recipes and I'd recommend a different crust recipe if you were going to make it.

I chose this recipe because it doesn't require baking in a water bath. Everyone at Thanksgiving liked it, but it didn't get finished as quickly as the apple pie (in fact, I still have 2/3 of it in my freezer). My crust came out soggy, and so it was kind of a mess to slice. Very tasty though. Will try to fix the crust in the future.

Cook from Colorado Springs! I had this same problem last year. This year I sprayed the pan with Butter flavored Crisco Spray and then cut a round of parchment paper and stuck it to the bottom of the pan. I then put another coat of the spray on the paper. It slid off onto a serving plate like a dream. Good Luck!

I don't like pumpkin at all but I loved this recipe. I used regular bourbon in the cake and the topping. The only trouble I had was cutting the cheesecake. The crust stuck to the spring pan. Don't know what I could have done to avoid this. Any suggestions? By the way the crust was delicious.

This was the hands down favorite at our Thanksgiving Feast. I'm not even a fan of cheesecake and I loved it! I did substitute Neufatchel cheese for cream cheese, but I didn't use low fat sour cream ( most taste inferior).

Made it for Thanksgiving for the 2nd year. I tried Brooke/San Francisco's idea of using a layer of plain cheesecake at the bottom to keep the crust from getting 'soggy', but - while delicious - the crust was still soft. Now I think it might have to do with the brown sugar caramelizing with the butter, and not the moisture from the pumpkin. I used gingersnaps for the crust; I meant to cut down/out the sugar but forgot to do so. Next time maybe half gingersnaps/half graham cracker, and use more crumbs for the butter, omit the brown sugar. The cheesecake and topping were perfect; I made it 2 days ahead of time. Cooked it about 15 extra minutes. Mmmm.

Have been looking for a good pumpkin cheesecake recipe, since I've found other recipes disappointing--this one is it! Followed other reviewers' suggestions (extra dry ingredients in crust, cut the pumpkin a bit) and it turned out great. A nice light smooth even texture, and the topping is tasty. Might cut the sugar in the crust a little next time. Yum!

I am going to try this recipe this weekend. But noticed that one reviewer was not able to find a bourbon liqueur. Wild Turkey makes a liqueur now, it's Wild Turkey and honey. It's fantastic on its own, but I think will great with this receipe. I will let everyone know.

I just cannot make a recipe without modifications and the main change I made to this was the addition of a strudel topping consisting of brown sugar, pecans and a tiny amount of butter. For the crust I used cinnamon sugar graham crackers and omitted the brown sugar. I always bake my crusts for about 10 minutes before pouring on the filling. It gives the crust a nuttier flavor and is not as prone to getting mushy. This is a very delicious recipe and have made it at least 5 times (with the strudel, of course) and have been asked for the recipe on each occasion.

I made this for Christmas Eve for 11 people and everyone loved it. It is has a unique flavor with the bourbon and it has a ice presentation. I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and FF sour cream to knock off a little of the cholesterol. It does take longer to bake than noted. I think mine took about 1 1/2 hours. Te recipe does not indicate the number of serving but there was about 1/4-1/3 of the cheesecake left after serving 11 people. it is rich so a small slice goes a long way.

I have made many varieties of cheesecake, and this one takes the cake! Wow! The fluffy yet firm cheesecake, the crust that keeps everyone begging for a recipe, and the contrasting and sensous topping make this a favorite for the many lucky folks who have partaken.

I made this for our family's Christmas Day dessert and it was a hit. Made it 2 days in advance. I doubled the crust ingredients (including the butter) and then used all but about 1/2 cup of the entire mixture when forming the crust. The butter leaked as a few people mentioned. THANKS FOR THE HINT! I lined an 11" tart pan with foil and put the springform pan on top of that. Everyone really loved this recipe. It was so pretty too. I dusted it with finely grated dark chocolate. I added extra bourbon to the topping as it tasted great. I don't even like bourbon, but I liked it here. Couldn't taste it in the cheesecake itself. Also, this was incredibly simply to make. Finally, I took a few folks' suggestion and put a small bowl of boiling water in the oven (same shelf) and the cake did not have even the slightest crack in it. Just perfect. Bon Appetite!

Baked this for a potluck and they loved it, but they love every cheesecake. Here's how I adjusted the recipe - I increased the crust by 50% (all but the butter which stayed the same). I increased spices and vanilla also by 50%. I used ultrafine sugar in the topping and doubled the amount. Sprinkled pecans under the topping, and left off the pecan garnish (lazy). I wrapped the pan in foil, but that was unnecessary with the reduced proportion of butter in the crust - no butter leaked out. Although I pre-baked the crust 10 minutes, it still came out soggy. Next time I'll cover the crust with a layer of plain cheesecake batter because the pumpkin may be sogging the crust. To do that, I'll change only the order of ingredients in the filling - mix together only the sugars, cream cheese and eggs, pour a quarter of it on the crust, then add all the other ingredients to the bowl and mix some more, pour all of that on top of the plain cheesecake batter, etc. I didn't find my 9-inch pan so used a 10-inch pan, which took 45 minutes to bake. The bowl of boiling water in the oven prevented cracks, but next time I'll use a souffle dish since a Pyrex bowl seemed unstable. Next time I may bake it in two 7-inch pans unless there's a big party. (My friends love to hear I have an "extra" cheesecake.)

Rating: 4
This is a great Thanksgiving dessert for people who are not particularly fond of pumpkin pie, although my husband (a die hard pumpkin pie fan) could not stop eating it. Next year I may double the crust recipe to make it extra thick. This recipe is for everyone, pumpkin pie and cheese cake lovers alike.

This cheesecake has definitely become a family tradition in our house. I have been making it for years and it is always a big hit. Even people who don't like cheesecake love this one.

I don't make any additions or try to kick it up a notch....just follow the recipe and it is always just perfect.

I read some of the reviews before making this and I followed the advice and it came out delicious! I only used one cup of pumpkin, I doubled the ginger (not the cinnamon because my boyfriend doesn't like cinnamon), I doubled the vanilla and I added a little extra sugar to the topping (it definately needed that!) I didn't use pecans because I didn't have any. Everyone LOVED it! They said it's the best thing I've ever made! I asked them all about the pecans and they said it was perfect without them.

I was not as taken with this cheesecake as were other reviewers. I utilized many of the excellent suggestions---more spices, Drambuie, gingersnaps --- but the crust, though tasty, absorbed all the moisture from the pumpkin and was soggy. The overall result was sweet and certainly pleasant, but it really did not seem to be all that memorable.

I made this once to practice for the big night. It wasn't quite right, so I adjusted the recipe before making it again. I doubled the crust without adding any more butter.

All our Thanksgiving guests raved about this decadent treat. I made it with fresh pumpkin puree from Halloween pumpkins that had gone uncarved. This made the cake very light and fresh (though some extra liquid was weeping out of it after its night in the refer) I also used fresh grated ginger instead of ground which gave the whole thing an extra kick. I too had to bake for quite a bit longer than directed. I would add more bourbon to the sour cream topping or cut the sour cream in half. All in all, very good. Everyone asked me for the recipe.

This fabulous! Someone thought it looked professionally made! I sprinkled chopped pecans to form a circle about 1/2 inch from edge once it cooled. I used a non stick springfoam pan...other cheesecakes got burnt on the bottom...this did not. I used fat free sour cream & regular cream cheese. It actually got better after a few days, and more dense, which is how I prefer cheesecake. I might experiment with baking it longer @ a lower temperature for a denser texture. I would even make it a few days ahead, because as delicious as it was...it really got better 2 days later!!!! Highly recommended!

After reading all of the rave reviews for this recipe I decided to make it for Thanksgiving. It was fantastic. As most of the other cooks did, I made some changes - used gingersnaps instead of graham crackers and the crust tasted like candy. I discussed it with my friends, in between bites, and we all thought there should be more crust because it was so tasty and the cake is so thick. Also, next time I make it I will double the spices in it. I had to cook it about 15 minutes longer than the recipe suggested and I cut the bourbon in half for the kiddos and wished that I hadn't. Even though there were 2 pumpkin pies and an apple pie at our feast, this cheesecake is the one everyone ate.

One of the joys of Epicurious is finding a great recipe and making subtle changes to make it your own. Such was the case with this scrumptious cheesecake which I made for Thanksgiving last year. After combing the recipes and reviews of all pumpkin cheesecakes, this was the winner. My touches - gingersnaps in lieu of graham crackers in the crust; kicked up the spices a bit and added cinammon; Drambuie for the liqueur; and a circle of tiny candied ginger pieces on the topping, concentric to the larger circle made by the pecans. I did wrap the springform pan in foil, alerted to the possibility of leakage and smoke in the oven. Good thing, as there was a pool of butter in the foil. While the outer crust was crisp, the bottom was a bit soft -- but no complaints from the crowd. It looked and tasted beautiful. A real keeper. This year, I made the Chocolate Cocnut Pecan Tart from this site. while delicious in its own right, everyone still raved about my cheesecake from last year!

This is a wonderful and *forgiving* recipe. I made a couple of changes: some on purpose, some not. I used cinnamon graham crackers instead of the regular kind, becuase I really like them much better than the regular. This made the crust extra special, I think, because it complimented the cheesecake. While making the cheescake itself, I forgot all about adding the heavy cream, but upon tasting, it didn't suffer at all for not having it. I also followed advice and doubled the sugar in the sour cream topping. It was a tremendous hit with every one. I will definitely be making this recipe again and again.

I am among the unfortunate who have to work the day after Thanksgiving. So I brought this cheesecake to the office for my fellow unfortunates and I to drown our sorrows in.

Oh my! ! ! I made it for Thanksgiving dinner. This was simply delicious - would have given it 5 forks. I've made the brandied pumpkin pie from this site for years but this year decided to serve something a bit different. I took the advice of others and doubled the crust (had a bit too much but used it all anyway so the crust reached almost to the top) and I substituted Cognac for the Bourbon - a matter of taste. Truly delicious although it was more like a mousse than a cheesecake but that's fine too and received rave reviews. I think pie may have now gone by the wayside for future holidays.

Made this for thanksgiving and everyone really liked it. I used ginger cookies instead of grahm crackers. I doubled the crust per others suggestion and I had leftover crust ingredients.

I used calvados instead of bourbon because that is what I had on hand. Very good, not too strong. MAKE THIS

We all loved this, but as many have noted, it's not really a cheesecake (consistency-wise, anyway) -- it's more of a pumpkin-cream cheese mousse. Whatever you call it, it was great. I, too, doubled the crust, which I thought was a bit TOO much, so I would do 1 1/2 next time. I also increased the spices, and decreased the bourbon. Actually, I eliminated it in the pumpkin part, and used half as much as directed in the topping, and we couldn't really taste it at all (we had many children at this feast, and I don't particularly like a strong liquor taste.) So next time, I will try to be a little braver with it!

I make a LOT of cheesecakes, and this is the best pumpkin cheesecake ever!!! As I was preparing to make this cheesecake for Thanksgiving Dinner, along with two very delicious pies (apple & pumkin; there are some people who don't like pumpkin or cheesecake... believe it or not!), I decided that I'd best plan ahead to avoid having any desserts go to waste, so I split the crust and batter into thirds and made one medium cheesecake with 2 thirds (served 8), and one small one with 1 third (served 2). I froze the small one for another time, and it turned out just as good as the first one, a whole month later! YUMMY!!!

After all the great reviews, I couldn't wait to try this. I was disappointed, however. Even after increasing the cook time 15 minutes, the center never set, and the sour cream topping slid into it, making a sour cream well.

Pumpkin cheesecake is SO much better than pie!!! To achieve a crack-free top, be sure to tap the batter before it goes in the oven and when it comes out, run a knife along the edge while it's still hot.

I won't be making pumpkin pies anymore! This cheesecake was a huge success, and it was not difficult to make. The bourbon sour cream topping was an excellent complement to the pumpkin.

I live in Bangkok, Thailand and made this recipe for a Thai/American Halloween lunch. It was delicious. Here some ingredients are non-existant. I found a box of cinnamon graham crackers and doubled the ingredients for the base...putting a bowl of water in the oven while cooking the cake did the trick on avoiding a cracked top. What a great recipe.

I made this cheesecake as one of 4 desserts for our yearly Oktoberfest. It was fantastic. There were only two small pieces left and many requests for the recipe. I will prepare this dish again for Thanksgiving. It took longer to bake (20 minutes) and I, too, used Drambouie instead of Bourbon. Yum! I used a combination of gingersnaps and graham crackers for my crust and doubled the crumb recipe. I also used fresh nutmeg.

This recipe is FABULOUS!!! My Father-In-Law had 2 pieces and he rarely eats dessert. I too used ginger snap cookies for the crust. This is a must! I made 1 1/2 times the crust recipe for a thicker crust and it was just right. I didn't add the heavy cream, because it was elimintaed from the directions. Whoops! It wasn't missed. I forgot to bake the last 5 minutes after adding the topping and it wasn't a problem. If children were not enjoying the cheesecake, I probably would have put a tad bit more bourbon in the topping. This will be a Thanksgiving choice from now on.

I have made this cheescake several times and is it delicious and foolproof. I made the following changes with great success: (1) used a gingersnap cookie crust; (2) baked the cake in a bain marie (water bath) sealing the springform pan with heavy-duty foil; and (3) substituted Meyer's Dark Rum for the bourbon. This cheesecake is very rich but not too sweet. Best served in small slices - although I've had people ask for seconds!

I doubled the crust amount and it seemed to be just the right amount. Definitely use foil wrap underneath as it does leak the butter while baking. Placed a pan of boiling water in the oven while baking and it did not crack. Used drambuie instead of bourbon and it was good. Received compliments from all at Thanksgiving dinner, though next time I wouldn't make cheesecake as a dessert after a big meal...everybody is too full to really enjoy it. Was very creamy and lighter than most cheesecakes. Would make again.

I made this once when it first came out in the magazine. I think I'll make it again for this year for our first Thanksgiving in our new house! It was a tad strong on the bourbon, but cutting that down (especially in the topping) is the only change I'd make.

I must agree with Pacific Palisades' review and say that after the high marks this received, I was really disappointed. The consistency of the filling was good, however, it was bland and lacked the spicy flavor of a pumpkin pie (I couldn't even finish the slice on my plate!) I am really glad I tested it out before serving it at Thanksgiving!

I'm not a big fan of pumpkin, but absolutely love this cheesecake. I've made it every year for the holidays since it hit the cover in 1990! I've passed on the recipe to many many people. The pumpkin pie gets passed up every time this cheesecake is next to it, and the crust is perfect.

I was a bit disappointed with this recipe after reading all the rave reviews. I love cheesecake and I love pumpkin pie so I thought I'd love this. I didn't! I'd rather have a regular cheesecake or a regular pumpkin pie. The crust of this cheesecake was soggy. Maybe precooking it would make it crispier (it was a delicious crust, but, as I said, it was soggy and stuck to the bottom of the pan). The cheesecake itself was good, but I prefer a stronger pumpkin flavor. I brought this over to a friend's house for dinner and although people liked it, nobody raved about it. I've made much better tasting desserts. I won't make this again.

This cheesecake is fabulous. I am actually getting kind of tired of making it, since everyone who tastes it then asks me to bring it to their next party. The only thing I would mention is that a Pypex pan filled with some hot water and placed on the shelf below the cheesecake will prevent the top from cracking, which happened to me the first time I made it. Also, it did not freeze well. Make it and eat it! I love the gingersnap suggestion for the crust - maybe I'll try that this weekend, since I have been asked to make it AGAIN!

This is a wonderful cheesecake. As per other use comments, I added 1/3 more of the cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. Also, I suggest using at least the full amount of sugar in the recipe (I frequently find desserts too sweet, but this one seemed *almost* not sweet enough). Also, I only used 8 pecan halves and then put three in the center which was gorgeous. Oh, and I regret adding the pecans a few hours before serving (little cracks developed around them).

I make this recipe every year and although it takes some time, it is well worth it. My guests demand that I make it each thanksgiving.

LOVE it LOVE it LOVE it. Served this @ a dinner where all of the food was GREAT and I was so afraid for everyone to try my cake. It was super. I hate pumpkin pie and this is so smooth and delicious. Maybe 1 thing I'd do differently is to bake the crust a little before baking the cheesecake. A little wet on the crust but good nonetheless.

I thought this was a very good recipe, but didn't make me swoon the way some cheesecakes can (see the New York Cheescake recipe on the site for cheescake heaven). The crust was excellent and the filling was creamy and rich. I just felt the sour cream topping didn't add much and that it didn't really compliment the filling as I'd hoped it would. I would say the recipe is still very good, just not to die for. If I were to make it again I'd skip the topping.

I made this dish the first time in an attempt to impress some very snooty in-laws. It was truely amazing how well it worked. In an instant I was being asked how to prepare not only this cheesecake, but a zillion other recips as well. Since then I make it once a year or by special request on special occasions. However I have since made some personal changes. Instead of canned pumpkin, I pick, cook, cut and scrape fresh ones if possible. Also, instead of using Burbon in the sour cream topping, I use Brandy, usually Christian bro's. Also, I have (when using too much brandy in things other than the cheesecake *hic*) gotten to the habit of instead of using the oven to carmelize the glaze, I use a mini blowtorch about 6-8 inches away, then chill immediately for 10 min, then cover and continue to chill overnight.

I made this recipe about 7 years ago, and forgot how good it was until I made it for this year's Christmas. It was so delicious, the best cheesecake I've ever made! I also made the Cinnamon Apple Pie from this website and everyone went for the cheesecake! It was so good, my mother and her friend took home a quarter of it each to eat for breakfast! Taste and presentation beyond compare. I also followed several previous suggestions by making more crust with less butter, and I used 2/3 Neufchatel cheese and 1/3 regular cream cheese, and 1/2 low fat sour cream 1/2 regular for the topping, plus extra sugar. Since we're not big on bourbon taste I reduced the amount to 1 tsp. for the filling, and 1 tsp for the topping. Turned out great. You MUST use a cookie sheet underneath while baking in case it leaks (butter), and also while in the fridge. This cake is to die for!

I prepared this cheesecake for Thanksgiving and most everyone liked it. However, my pumpkin-hating husband would not even try it! Next time I, too, will add more sugar, as it was not really sweet enough for my taste. I have baked many cheesecakes and never once have I had one crack. Why? Because I bake cheesecakes in a 200 degree (F)oven for four hours, turn the over off, let them set for 30 minutes, take them out of the oven, then refrigerate them for one to two days before removing the springform ring. It works every time.

I used lowfat sour cream and cream cheese (neufchatel), and baked it for 10 minutes longer than indicated. I think there was just too much water in the lowfat versions of the ingredients, as even the extra time didn't firm the middle. The crust was delicious, but I'm not thrilled about the filling or topping--in fact (even though I used Southern Comfort as suggested), no one could taste the bourbon. I might make it again using the full-fat versions of ingredients, or I may just stick with chocolate cheesecake instead.

I helped my husband make this cheesecake for a pot luck dinner at work. We made it exactly as directed... except for adding extra crushed pecans to the crust.

I plan to make another... just for me.

I hate to be the lone voice of dissent, but I personally found this cheesecake highly disappointing. I think my springform pan was too cheap, because I ended up with a huge mess in the bottom of my oven, due to the cheesecake leaking. It leaked again as it chilled overnight in my refrigerator (no, I didn't learn my lesson from the oven fiasco), leaving a sticky ring that took forever to clean up. I, too, found the sour cream topping to be way too tart. Although the consistency of the cheesecake was just right, I felt it could have used a double dose of the spices to hide the tartness of the topping. Too bad this recipe was disappointing to me, but at least I also had the triple layer carrot cake to offer to my guests -- THAT dessert was devoured with hardly a crumb left!

This recipe is fabulous!! I can't imagine anyone not wanting to make it again. It turned out perfectly. I followed some of the suggestions from other reviewers - boiling water in the back of the oven to prevent cracking, and skimped a bit on the sugar and butter in the crust. I also wrapped the bottom of the springform pan in aluminum foil to prevent leaks. Next time I will double the crust because it is fabulous! This will become a holiday MUST!

Loved this recipe. IT was a huge hit with the family. NOTE: I had to make about 1-1/2 times the crust that was called for because I wanted the crust to go almost to the top of each slice. Turned out perfect, EVERYONE raved about the crust.

This was my husbands first attempt at baking :-)! Being novice cooks, we didn't know what was a good sign that the cake was "set". The recipe doesn't really say? I'm sure it's obvious if you've baked cheesecakes before. However, it still came out great!! I also added more bourbon to the sour cream mixture and still found it a little too tart, only added about a tbps to each slice. But all in all, it was a great addition to our Thanksgiving dinner, we'll be making this again!

Rating: 3
Two favorite desert recipes in one! I tripled the recipe and it came out fine. I used a pre-mixed pumpkin pie seasoning and added the ground ginger to it. Adjustments could be made to the crust to keep it crispier, and doubling the recipe would allow for the crust to be higher up on the sides. We liked that it wasn't overly sweet. Cooking time was right on while using convection. A light sprinkle of cinnamon along with candied pecan halves for finishing touch.

This is so decadent! I made it exactly as the recipe specified and it was excellent.

Don't make the same mistake - the smoke detectors were blaring!

this is a great dessert. don't put bourbon in the sour cream topping if you want to freeze it for use later. for an extra decadent touch, serve with a drizzle of caramel sauce. another idea is to use small chopped pieces of toffee on top of the sour cream topping. to avoid cracking, put boiling water into a small dish when baking and allow to cool by turning off the oven and leaving door open slightly.

I too used less sugar in the crust to prevent it from becoming to syrupy. I HAD to use 1/4 cup of sugar in the topping instead of the 2Tbs it called for. It was actually still to sour tasting for my taste next time I will increase it to 1/3 C. My kids really liked it.

Wonderful light texture. Purchase a small 50ml btl of bourbon if you don't usually cook with it (like those small "airplane" size). I used suggestions 1) bowl of boiling water in oven while cooking 2) lessened amount of butter in crust and 3) layered the pecans between the pumpkin and sour cream topping. Also piped whipped cream around edges since they looked a bit ragged. Will definitely make this recipe again. Received wonderful reviews from guests!

Unable to find a favorite recipie for pumpkin cheesecake that was given to me by a good friend, I turned to the internet and 'epicurious' to save me from any anticipation that may have been created for the upcoming office potluck two days before Thanksgiving. I typed in 'Pumpkin Cheesecake' and choose this recipie from several selections. A few of the ingriediants are different from the one I've used in the past. It was after midnight when the pie sat on the lowest rack of the refrigerator. A short while before the blessing, my wife walked in with a wonderful contribution to the feast. I was the first to cut a small sliver and enjoy the outcome. When all were finished I went back to collect the left overs to take to my wife. Oooops! The only thing left was to say thank you, for all the compliments. The only problem was that I should have cut the first two pieces, sorry honey, we'll make another one. Thanks Epicourious, you saved the day.

This cheesecake has become a holiday tradition - I've been making it since it debuted in 1990. The flavor combination is sublime, and the cake itself is a beauty.

It wouldn't be "fall" without the recipe. Have made it time and time again and it is always good. Even finicky eaters who claim they don't like pumpkin always come back for more. Only change I make is during the cooking sequence,when the cheesecake comes out of the oven for 5 mins when you put the sour cream topping on it...before I put the topping on I sprinke a few tablespoons of chopped toasted pecans on top of cheesecake and than put the sour cream on for it's last 5 mins in the oven. I don't put the pecan 1/2's on top as recipe says. Makes a nice texture combo.

This has become a Thanksgiving staple at our house. It looks tough; follow the directions and you'll have no problems. Two helpful hints, though: (1) skimp (a bit) on sugar and butter in the crust, lest it come out hard and syrupy and (2) save yourself a smidge of sour cream topping to "caulk" the incidental cracks that will form (I promise) on the top as the cake cools.

This was a delicious alternative to the boring pumpkin pie (which I do not care for). Everyone who had some loved it! I did not use the sour cream topping, but rather made a home-made caramel topping and topped it with roasted pecans.

Excellent cheesecake! This has become a tradition for Thanksgiving dinners for the past eight years. One variation I tried recently with great success, was to use ginger thins (thin giner snaps) in place of the graham crackers and less sugar. Another substitute was to use cognac instead of bourbon, and to use maple sugar instead of brown sugar. Using fresh steamed or baked pumpkin that has been purd and strained overnight in the refrigerator (using a fine seive or strainer over a bowl) has always made the best cheesecake.

The taste was divine but it seemed to be very soft. Christmas Eve it sat out for 2 hours and slumped. I've only made 2 cheesecakes in my life and wasn't sure it cooked long enough. When I took it out of the oven it was still jiggly. Was it suppose to be firm? The topping was definitely sour cream and could have had a touch of sweetness to it. Would love to hear a reply re: firmness when baking is over.

I have been making this cake since it was first published...and everyone loved it...I also change the pumpkin to pureed apricots (soaked in apricot brandy) and on top of the sour cream in put apricot glaze and dried apricots. I've done the same with raspberries, too. It's the best cheesecake recipe!!!

I have used this recipe many times. People who either do not like cheesecake or pumpkin seem to like both in this recipe. I recently went to find this recipe but was unable to locate the issue of Gourmet that had it. Thanks to this service, I'll be able to satisfy some cravings (my own included).

Perfection. I didn't try the bourbon topping, but I can't imagine this cheesecake tasting any better.

A fabulous cheesecake! This one will be a staple at my Thanksgiving table each year. My husband loved it, as did the rest of the family. I will make this one again often.

This recipe has been a Thanksgiving tradition in our family for the past five or six years. I have a few modifications: 1) Double the crust; 2)Use rum extract instead of bourbon; and 3) Use half the amount of the latter. The only complaint I've ever had has been too much rum flavor. Wonderful recipe!!

I brought this dessert to my family's Thanksgiving and it got RAVE reviews. I omitted the frosting (it seemed a little excess) and it didn't seem to be missing a thing. I'll make it again next year.

IT'S THE THIRD TIME I'VE MADE IT AND IT BLOWS EVERYONE AWAY! I USE SOUTHERN COMFORT IN PLACE OF BOURBON LIQUER BECAUSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND.THANKS MUCH.

Everyone raved about this recipe, which combines the traditional Thanksgiving pumpkin pie with the cheesecake. I decided not to add the Bourbon (I live in Bourbon country) because I did not see how it would complement the flavor of the cheesecake. After making this dish, I am glad I omitted the Bourbon. I also did not make the sour cream topping. One scoup of vanilla ice cream is great. Make sure that you use plain graham crackers and crush them. My crust was the weak part of the cheesecake.

This got rave reviews, and someone asked where I bought it! Personally, I did not care for the sour cream topping but others said they liked the contrast. The crust and the filling are very yummy; I might add 1 c. sour cream to the filling next year and top with fresh whipped cream. But I will make this again!

Delicious! The alternative to (boring) pumpkin pie at our house. I like to double the crust too.

I HAVE TRIED THIS RECIPE FOR A THANKSGIVING DINNER SEVERAL TIME AND IT ALWAYS RECEIVES RAVES!! IT IS CERTAINLY ONE THAT IS KEPT IN MY SPECIAL DESSERT FILE. A NICE WAY TO HAVE THE BEST OF TWO DESSERTS...PUMPKIN PIE AND CHEESECAKE!

This is the second time I have made this cheesecake and both times it has been a big hit. It will be put in my favorite file. I brushed the pecans for the top with burbon and sugar and roasted for 10 min. they turned out very good.

This is a WINNER and has had repeat performances at our Thanksgiving table. I have substituted crushed gingersnaps for the graham crackers for a nice change. Also I have found prebaking the crust avoids the sogginess I have had in the past. Just a great dessert recipe, well worth the effort.

Great for Thanksgiving dessert. Everyone loved it and I usually do not care for plain pumpkin pie. Easy to prepare. I garnished the top using crushed pecans and stencils to decorate it then some whole pecans. Looked like it was commercially done at a bakery. Excellent creamy dessert.

Wonderful alternative to pumpkin pie. All of my guests raved about it. It was the highlight of our Thankgiving meal. One suggestion: use chopped pecans as a garnish rather than whole ones; you will find it is easier to slice.

I will make this recipe every year!!! It was a huge success for Thanksgiving. I used fresh pumpkin in my cooking & it really turned out light & fluffy! Verrrrrry Good!!! I'm eating some right now.

The cheesecake was very good, as all comments below stated. I did not have any luck with freezing it for 2 weeks prior to serving it. I defrosted it in the refrigerator for a day but it was all watery when I went to serve it. Next time I will make it one day before and refrigerate it only. No freezing

THE BEST! Has become my "signature" cheesecake. I have been preparing this receipe since 1991 and have truly enjoyed making it! Wonderful mix of flavors, very creamy!

delicious when I made it in 1990 for Thanksgiving. The pie is smooth and the cream cheese topping is just right. The only reason I might not make it again is that it was labor intensive.

This recipe has become one of my Thanksgiving traditions since the recipe was published in 1990. It has always been a winner!! This cheese cake is very light and doesn't give you that "heavy" feeling. I misplaced my recipe when I moved and was distraught that I might never find the recipe. I decided to try "surfing" for it, and thankfully it was on the website!!! Now my tradition can continue! I hope you will try it, too.

I've made this every Thanksgiving for years now. Even my very traditional sister-in-law who thought she'd never give up her pumpkin pie now requests this cheesecake. It's very pretty when garnished with the pecans and with the base decorated with ivy as shown in the magazine.

Great change from the usual Pumpkin Pie! I brought this into work and it's going quickly. I will definately make this for Thanksgiving.

I've made this twice and each time it gets rave reviews due to the great crust and the creaminess of the filling. I always use Wild Turkey Bourbon Liqueur instead of regular bourbon and it makes it special.

Awesome. My girlfriend, a former airborne ranger, has been looking for this recipe for some time and vouches for this - with four forks.

Made this recipe for last Thanksgiving. It was given rave reviews from all the family. We loved it. Plan on making it again, but would double the crust recipe.

I thought the actual cheesecake was delicous, however found that the sourcream topping didn't go with the cake. I would go with fresh whipped cream next time.

I've made this cake twice. The first time, I omitted the pecans and just increased the graham cracker. The second time, I made it with the pecans, and it made a world of difference. Also, the second time, I doubled the crust portions so I could have a thicker crust and have it go higher up the sides. Both times I opted not to make the sour cream topping, and it was still delicious.

This fabulous recipe works just as well with neufchatel instead of regular cream cheese, and 1/3 less fat sour cream instead of the full-fat stuff.

I made this cake for my own wedding cake in 1992. It was a highlight for my guests. One guest had me make it for his wedding (encased in white chocolate). It's now an anniversary tradition

This is one of the best pumpkin cheesecakes I've ever had. And it's SO easy to make. I've passed out the recipe to several friends who've requested it. I usually substitute crushed gingersnaps for the graham crackers in the crust. YUM!

The entire family loved it...the folks who don't like pumpkin loved it & the folks who, believe it or not, don't like cheesecake loved it. I make it every Thanksgiving or Christmas by popular demand.

I've made this every Thanksgiving since the recipe was first published. Like almost every other Gourmet recipe, the results were as expected--terrific! Now my siblings demand this item each year, and because it's easy to make, I'm pleased to make and serve it.

I have made this cheesecake a number of times since it first appeared, and it's always a success. Our daughter usually requests this for her birthday.

This recipe is so good and so consistent it is in my permanent file. It was the first cheesecake I ever made, and one of my favorites still. It is equally good without the topping, and just some caramalized pecans for garnish.

we make this cheesecake every thanksgiving since we first found it.
