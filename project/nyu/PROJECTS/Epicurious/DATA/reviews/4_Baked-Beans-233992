Love this recipe. I substitute salt pork with 1/2 pound bacon - quarter inch dice.

I used lardons for the pork - worked fine. The beans are pale (I used haricot) but delicious. I like the combination of flavours and the sweetness was just right. My only problem was a very little bit of drying out the very top at the end when the beans were uncovered - this time I think I'll leave them covered up throughout the cooking.

I'd give it three and a half forks. I used dried pinto beans, because that's what I had on hand, and added a few dashes of tabasco in place of some of the ground pepper. Also, because I had it, I used a good- sized slab piece (close to 1/2 lb) of pancetta instead of salt pork. Didn't even need to bother with salt or vinegar. The sweetness of the beans was an accent to the overall flavour, not the first thing you noticed. I used grade B (amber) syrup, suspect those who found it too sweet used pancake syrup instead or something. Very tasty, and color was perfect (but then, pintos are darker than navy beans). Would LOVE to try this again with the endpiece of a prosciutto.

I followed the recipe carefully and didn't like these beans at all. They were too sweet for my taste.

I have always wanted to bake beans but was afraid I would end up with a hard, dry, grainy mass like the baked beans of childhood bbq's. To make these beans I tried to overcompensate on the soak and I am alive to say everything worked out pretty good. At 9pm i boiled beans for 15 min and left them to soak overnight. At 9am I put all the ingredients together in a heavy casserole substituting 1/4 cup molasses for the 1/4 of syrup I didn't have. The beans baked for 3 hrs. I added more water to the beans with about 1 hr of baking left to go. I had to run out at noon so i left the beans in the oven, temp turned off. When I got back an hour later i tested the beans and they were saucy, nicely moist but still just firm enough not to be mushy.

Pretty good, but not quite what I was hoping for.

Based upon the few bad reviews and the fact that I am not a baked bean fan I made this three days before my company BBQ at which I was fingered to bring the baked beans, so I made a tester batch. Outcome was excellent, and will be making the other batch to bring it up to full portions and can't wait to hear the rave reviews I know these will get! only thing I did different was to brown the salt pork, add some (1 tbls) of tabasco and add some 1/4 bbq sauce. cooked it for 8 hrs in a slow cooker and it was a absolute TREAT!!! tonight before the BBQ when I make them again I'll leave out the bbq sauce not necessary

We thought these were delicious. I usually use a new england recipe that calls for molasses so used that instead of the maple syrup. Note for those using the quick soak method... after soaking for one hour, simmer until the beans start to become tender. Also, after putting in the oven, keep the reserved bean liquid and add it as needed while they are cooking to make sure nothing dries out. Served with brats that I parcooked then grilled. Delicious!

These beans require additional seasoning aside from the ones stated in the recipe. Didn't care for the pale, unappetizing color, and bland taste. Were made eatable for one meal after adding 1c. BBQ sauce, 2T. Dijon mustard, 2T. Worcestershire sauce, and 1/2c. brown sugar. Served with BBQ baby back ribs. The leftover beans went straight to the garbage.

these are great - i tried following the recipe exactly but, as luck would have it, the salt pork i had went bad and all i had was thick-sliced bacon. I briefly left the bacon slices in the oven to render some fat and to get them nice and browned before i added everything else. i doubled the recipe and used about 6 slices bacon - more would not have hurt, but 6 was good. It was incredibly easy to put together and, about 5 hrs later, it was done! The house smelled great, too. I did need to add a little more water, but that's it. Oh, and i didn't soak the beans AT ALL - it's really an unnecessary step, so if you forgot to soak them, don't even bother with the "quick-soak" method. Beans will not take any less time to cook.

Simple, delicious, I too added 2 tbsp molasses because I couldn't find grade b maple syrup but it was great. Would definitley make again.

Tried making this with 1/3 navy beans, 1/3 black beans, 1/3 kidney beans -- and used smoked pork loin instead of salt pork because I couldn't find salt pork. Delicious. I was trying to emulate a dish the Epicurious Scrum team had for lunch during our Planning Meeting last week (from Daisy Mae's in NYC) ... close, not exact, but still very yummy.

D-I-S-A-S-T-R-O-U-S! My fault, I'm sure, because everyone else's reviews were so good... I used too large a pot and, I presume, the liquid evaporated too quickly. What a waste of food, and of the time that it took to clean out the burnt-in black brick of beans!!!! I doubt I'd ever get the gumption to try this recipe ever again, and I'm so glad that I didn't attempt it for my annual bbq -- back to the tried and true corn fritter recipe from Tony Roma's!

Delicious. The first time I made this was for Easter 2008. Found the Grade B syrup at Trader Joes. Added molasses for color and a little richer flavor. Also some brown sugar if you like sweet/salty combo baked beans. Just made this recipe again for July 4 bbq. Doubled the recipe and still added "a pour" of molasses for color and a heavy scoop of brown sugar. No other alteration of original recipe except to double.Used overnight soak method and quick soak method. no problem with either one. Mmmmm!!A keeper.

Grade A maple syrup was all I could find, and it is so light that the beans looked pale and unappetizing. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I will stick with dark molasses which looks and tastes better from now on.

this is a great receipe and very easy - i did the quick soak method and it works great - make sure you work in enough time for this though- it's well worth it

Can't fail! I used what I already had: lentils and bacon. Cooked in a crockpot, then saved for three days in a cooler while we were camping. Then boiled off the water over the camp stove. Delicious! Everyone had seconds.

Wonderful taste, added molasses as suggested because I could not find 'Grade B' maple syrup. It was just right, not too sweet. The second time I made it I added 28 ounces of crushed tomatoes, a little more molasses and mustard, that too was wonderful.

I used my slow cooker instead of the oven (it was hot that day) - I used the quick soak method and cooked it on high for about 4 hours, and then took the lid off (still on high) for another hour. Delicious!

I agree that this is a GREAT recipe! I, too, am a New Englander who has been brought up with both canned and home made baked beans. The first time that I made it, I used the quick soak method and the second time, the overnight soak. I only needed four cups of water with the quick soak but needed the extra half cup with the overnight method. Additionally, I, too, only had grade A syrup so I added a TBS of dark molasses. I used crushed red pepper flakes instead of black pepper.Also, I added about a teaspoon of Maggi seasoning instead of the salt. That said, I'm sure that the recipe would be just fine as written. It's a real keeper. Thanks so much!

I made this recipe and it was delicious, however I had to add more water to the beans twice because they were not done. Consequently, I added a little more maple syrup and mustard to keep the flavor. I would definitely make again.

In spite of making a huge error and adding too much water at the start of this recipe these beans were spectacular. I am a life long baked beans lover and, given the time, will never go back to canned again. These have a great combination of sweet and spicy with the small addition of the pepper called for in the recipe.

This is now my favorite baked bean recipe. I used Grade B syrup and I strongly recommend that you do as well and don't cheat. Grade B syrup has a stronger maple favor and is better for recipes. (The letter rating is for sugar content and not quality.)

Make sure you get real maple syrup. I didn't think it was worth the trouble to get grade "B". To get the effect of "B" syrup, add a teaspoon of molaasess. Or, do what I did: omit salt at end and add 1 teaspoon "Kitchen Bouquet" or "Gravy Master". Adds salt, and gives a more traditional dark color. Great receipe. Also, I would start with 4 cups of water, and add the extra half cup if necessary.

Excellent recipe. I did not have (nor would it be worth buying) Grade B maple syrup. (Whatvever you do, don't use something gross like "Aunt Jemima"; use real maple syrup.) At the end, you could add a tbl of molasses to get the same effect. Or, do what I did; add "Gravy Master" or Kithchen Bouquet" instead of salt at end. 1 teaspoon adds both salt and gives a darker color. Also, I think 4 1/2 cups water is too much. Add 4 cups,and the see if you need the other 1/2 cup at the end.
