Despite the amazing ease of this recipe (actually took LESS than 25 minutes), it has a great flavor. We served over white rice as suggested. My husband is usually reticent to accept new recipes into our repertoire, but he was a hands down fan. This was in spite of having to make my own chili-garlic sauce as there is some debate as to whether this item made it onto the grocery list.... (consisted of white vinegar, dash of white sugar, red pepper flakes and chopped garlic - I've heard this can sometimes be hard to find even when you remember to look :). Would make a little extra sauce next time so that it goes further with the rice. Otherwise, can't wait for leftovers and to make again.

Excellent! Made with chicken thighs. I particularly liked the sweet taste of the 5-spice powder.

What a very easy recipe for all the flavors and very impressive, too! I served Mustard roasted potatoes and roasted Aspargus with Parmesan Cheese. The mustard was a great complement to the spicy, sweet sauce of the pork tenderloin. My parents loved this "casual" meal as it took little time to put together!

Don't like 5-spice, so maybe that's the problem... but one of the least successful Asian pork dishes ever.

This recipe has been a perennial favorite at our house since we first made it. Easy to make, and very satisfying. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

We like our pork done about medium, so I sliced tenderloin in 3/4" slices and didn't pound. For the chili-garlic sauce I used what I had, which was The Pepper Plant chunky garlic hot pepper sauce. I didn't have green onion, so I used about 2T minced yellow onion and added 2T chopped cilantro at the end. The cilantro was a wonderful addition. I served the pork with baked sweet potatoes, as another reviewer suggested, and the combination was great!! This will be one of our go-to pork recipes. Would also be good served at room temp.

I did this a little lazy-I mixed the maple syrup with Sriracha, and poured it over the pork when it was almost done cooking. I made homemade toasted five-spice, cooked it all together. Omitted the broth and green onion. I don't think I'll ever make pork any other way. =)

This recipe is so easy and has tons of flavor. I cooked the pork a little longer to get fully cooked (160 degrees).

Can't say enough good things about this recipe. Very tasty, especially if you get all of the flavors right. Try this one soon.

This was really good! I will definitely make again. Very simple and easy. I made jasmine rice, sauteed garlic spinach, and a sweet and pungent asparagus to go with it and my husband loved it. Because it's so simple, I think I will make it often.

This was great - quick, includes ingredients readily in the pantry and most importantly, was delicious. Unfortunate for me, but I had no chili-garlic sauce on hand so had to make some up on the quick with garlic, chipotle peppers/sauce, bit of sugar and white wine vinegar. Rave reviews from the spouse. Will definitely make again.

This is simple to prepare and quite good BUT you do have to know your audience and the heat of your chili- garlic sauce. I served this with baked sweet potatoes instead of rice and thought it was a good choice.

This dish is so easy and super yummy. Go easy on the chili garlic sauce or your mouth will catch on fire. This is a wonderful, complete meal with jasmine rice and broccoli, green beans, etc.

Very good recipe and so simple. It would be good with shrimp or chicken too. I did add a little more chili-garlic sauce to spice it up. I will make this again!

This recipe is now in my meal rotation. It is spicy, but a very nice change from "everyday" meals. Lately, I have been substituting the Pork Tenderloin for thin, center cut Pork Chops. They are less expensive and still good. Granted, they are not as good as the tenderloin (of course), but provide a good sub that is lighter on the wallet. I cook each side for 2 minutes and then cook for 1 minute on each side in the sauce at the end to capture more of the flavor. I would not sub anything for real Maple Syrup. There is no substitute, so leave your Aunt Jemima and Mrs. Butterworth's at the supermarket. I serve it over cous cous. Great recipe.

I used Michael Lomonaco's idea of sour with the sweet and added 1 T. balsamic vinegar to the sauce. The five-spice made this flavor perfect. I also doubled the sauce.

Wow, the cook from London really wanted us to read their review!!!! Posting NINE times is bordering on obsessive!! When will people realize the reviews they write don't get posted immediately? Patience, people!! Anyway, on to the important stuff: this recipe was good for a fast weeknight meal, but I wouldn't call it company worthy. Nevertheless, all family members enjoyed it. PLEASE don't use the fake corn-syrupy garbage for this or any other recipe. Real maple syrup is in a whole other category.

This is the 4th time I've made this recipe and it will definitely stay in my culinary rotation. An exceptionally easy, yet extremely flavorful dish. Given the small amount of maple syrup required I always use the 'real' stuff, but do double the sauce recipe as it's so good to drizzle over rice. Love it!!

Rating: 4
Excellent flavor and pretty quick to pull together. I reduced the sauce until it would coat a spoon and there was enough to cover the meat with a little left over. Next time I will probably return the meat to the sauce and coat thoroughly and then drizzle whatever little is left over the top.

Is it me or is the chile REALLY HOT in this recipe??? I can't even taste the sweetness, and am using all my rice to knock the heat down. I'll try it again b/c I think the basis is really yummy, but maybe with less chile sauce and a little more maple syrup??

Rating: 4
We LOVE this recipe, and continue to repeat it. We do not go buy the expensive pure maple syrup, but use the "fake stuff." It's still absolutely delicious. This is also pretty easy to make, which is always a bonus!

Yum yum yum yum!!!! We loved these. The only change I made was to use boneless center-cut pork chops pounded to 1/4". I can't wait to make these again.

I thought this was great...made it for Moms on Mother's Day so it was a bit more effort serving 16 but worth the extra time. The combination of flavors was delicious. Served with smashed pots w/garlic, mozzarella and parmesan cheese to soak up the juices! Another keeper!

This is very pretty and tastes good, but if you make it exactly as the recipe says, boiling down the sauce to a scant 1/4 cup, the note to serve with rice to soak up the yummy sauce is a joke, because there is hardly any sauce. The sauce barely covers the pork. It has a slight kick to it, but very slight -- it basically tastes like pork.

Yum ! Yum ! Yum! Very tasty. I made exactly as written. I little on the spicy side but still very good. As it is so easy to make this will definately be on the top of my list.

The 2 things anyone would want in a new recipe are ease of preperation and amazing taste. This has BOTH! I do not eat meat (just the cook), my wife however kept asking "are you sure you can only give it 4 forks....are you sure?" It will be on the table again VERY soon!

very easy and quick. i made more sauce by upping broth and syrup, kept the chili sauce the same b/c as another user, i had the wicked spicy thai variety. i also undercooked the meat initially then put back in thickened sauce and let it finish in the saucy. was v good. served with black and white soba noodles and steamed veg.

Really great dish for something so simple. Used a one-lb tenderloin cut in five to make a week's worth of lunch portions, with some roast sweet potato slices and haricot verts. The short cooking time keeps the pork juicy. Definitely a keeper.

It's very fast, easy, and tastes great! I did not have the chili-garlic sauce on hand so I used 1T of Chili oil and a clove of garlic. The second time I made it I forgot to include the green onions - Do not forget the green onions!!!!! They make the dish

This was a quick, easy meal. I loved the crust on the pork with the 5 spice powder. I also loved the sauce, but cut back on the chili-garlic sauce since I have a Thai variety that is very hot.

This was really quite easy and had a delicious flavor - quite spicy. It's an attractive looking dish as well, with the flecks of red pepper and the green onions on top.
