Made it twice. Couldn't find serranos, so used twice as many jalapenos instead. Had to put in more chile water as it was still too mild. Did not strain the soup. Used only red tomatoes. Served in demi-tasse cups to guests with other nibbles - very summery and good. Next time will make some small croutons to throw in. VERY easy to make.

Fantastic! Great to wow your friends and guests. Make sure you make the Kalua Pig Grilled Cheese sandwiches.

Very easy to make - roasted the tomato slices in the oven for a bit longer (15 minutes at 350) along with a few cloves of garlic. Rather than making the chile-pepper water, I just added a little garlic chili sauce, a small piece of fresh ginger, some red wine vinegar, and a little sugar. Pureed it all in a blender and strained through a sieve. By the way, don't throw out the solids - make an awesome spread for crostini or a filling for an omlette.

I have actually had this soup at Alan Wong's and its absolutely fabulous. Locally, its very difficult to find yellow tomotoes -- but when you do, difenitely make this soup. It's perfect.
