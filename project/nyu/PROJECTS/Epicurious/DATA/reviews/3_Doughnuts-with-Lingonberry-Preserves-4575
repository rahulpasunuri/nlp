This recipe creates a light, fluffy, bread-like doughnut - just what I wanted. A powdered sugar glaze could make it like bakery doughnuts. I made this recipe in my new bread machine, on the dough only cycle. Then I dropped rounded balls of dough on a cookie sheet, covered with plastic wrap & refrigerated overnight. The next morning, to reduce fat, I BAKED them in the oven @ 325*F instead of frying at the same temperature. Delicious!

Foodies, I think I have an answer to your doughnut plight. Check out the Food network's Gale Gand's SweetDreams. If your looking for something a little more cakey, try Martha Stewart's cakey doughnuts. Hope I helped!

Okay, I'm being unfair in not trying this recipe first. But I did read the reviews and agree with the previous comment(s) - Why are there not more doughnut recipes in Epicurious? Or anywhere? I just used a Joy of Cooking recipe to make my 2nd- ever batch of doughnuts, and they were so-so. We doughnut lovers want options! We're looking for fabulous doughnuts! Surely we're not alone??

I was thinking these would be like doughnut holes but the dough isn't even sweet. The preserves are a must. After I got over my initial surprise I decided they tasted good, but not what I had in mind. Too bad there aren't other doughnut recipes on epicurious. I have a vat of fat and would like to experiment!

I was disappointed, they seemed more like fritters than doughnuts. I was hoping for the type of doughnuts you can get fresh baked from a bakery. Any recipes like that?

I've made home-made donuts before, but these are much better. Yum Yum.
