Good recipe. Next time I make it I will not puree everything, leaving some whole beans. It was a little too thick for me, so I may add some additional broth as well, and probably some additional onions and garlic.

Decent basic recipe, but for its second time around I gave it some love. I used leeks instead of onion, and cooked cannelini beans from scratch with chicken broth, garlic, and bay leaf (no garbanzos). Left out 2 cups of beans before pureeing, and added sliced Tuscan kale along with the spinach. Taking the advice of others, I topped it with sage fried in brown butter and a generous swig of balsamic. The fried sage is a MUST. Seriously--if you haven't tried it before this is your chance!

Very subtle but great texture and highly enjoyable. I'd probably add more garlic next time, but I say that about everything. Very easy to make as well.

I altered this recipe by adding two stalks of celery while simmering, because I had a bunch in the fridge. I also added a teaspoon or so of thyme as well as a a splash of lemon juice and a few drizzles of balsamic vinegar. I pureed the whole thing because the idea of stringy spinach in an otherwise creamy soup didn't appeal much. For me, the best addition was a dollop of plain non-fat greek yogurt to my bowl --- that added the zing that this recipe needed . . . for me anyway. Great recipe --- for those of you who found it bland, just be creative and make it your own! Happy cooking . . .

It was a bit bland- I added fresh lemon. Red pepper flakes should be added when onion, garlic & rosemary are sauteeing. Frying sage in brown butter was a great suggestion by another cook. Tomorrow when it's reheating I may use balsamic vinegar and eliminate the lemon. It really needs a kick.

Great soup. I will definitely make it again, but I'll pay closer attention to my ingredients to make sure they are low in sodium. Mine was more salty than I would have liked. Also - I doubled the amount of rosemary.

Very easy and good for lactose alergic people. I add a little, OK, a lot more garlic. Also Brown a few whole sage leaves in butter until the sage is crisp and the butter browm. Ladle soup into bowls and drizzle with butter and sage.

This is a good easy soup recipe that can be made with what you have on hand. It is also very quick. Use vegetable broth and you have a vegetarian soup. I will make this again.

Rating: 4
Very easy recipe with delicious results! I left about 1.5 cups of the beans/broth out of the blender so that there would still be some full beans in the soup. I also used veggie broth in place of chicken broth, and added some fresh thyme since we had it in the garden. This was quick and easy.

This was a great recipe and so healthy! My fiance and I devoured it and had lots of left-overs. It doesnt' look like it would be very hearty but it was...an hour after eating we both were so full still. I would certainly make this recipe again. A few notes about the recipe: * When cooking the onions, medium-high heat for 15 mintues was far too long/too much. The onion and garlic started to blacken, so I had to turn down the heat. Probably med-low heat for 15 mintues is best. * I didn't used low-sodium chicken broth, and the flavour was still a little bland, but you can always add more salt and pepper, which I did, not only to the pot but to the individual bowls when served.

This came out better than I thought. Like other, this was very much a pantry dish with the exception of the greens - I added some kale because it complements the beans so well. Also, a great plus is that this recipe can easily be made vegetarian and vegan with the omission of chicken broth and parmesan cheese. One suggestion though, if you are using canned beans watch out for the salt content - you don't need to add much salt if you're beans are already salty.

Good, hearty soup. 3 forks because it is so healthy, quick, easy & uses ingredients that are always on hand! I add thyme, increase all the herbs & garlic. I leave it semi-chunky with my wand blender. Also, I prefer it without the olive oil & cheese. This soup also gets better the next day... perfect for work lunches.

This soup is excellent and will become part of my standard repertoire, BUT I did not use canned beans or broth. I used dried navy beans and cooked them with aromatics (bay leaves, onion, garlic) and salt, and then used the bean cooking broth instead of chicken broth for the soup.

I love garbanzos, cannellini and spinach separately, but somehow this combination just didn't work for me. It was somewhat better with parmesan or garlic croutons, but I still won't make it again.

It was rather bland. but it could be because I only used one onion and skipped the parmesan cheese. I'm gonna give it one more try, adding more onions and the cheese. I'm sure the cheese is what makes the dish.

This is a fast, easy, and filling soup for a quick dinner. I'm fixing it tonight for dinner guests and serving with fruit, cheese, and a good crusty bread. It's perfect for when you get home at 5:30 and dinner's at 7! The flavor is subtle, but I think this soup would lend itself well to customization with your favorite flavors.

Great pantry-staple recipe. I used dried herbs instead of the fresh, but stuck to fresh baby spinach. I've looked forward to having it for lunch this week. I may try another herb (basil?) the next time I make it.

This is delicious and easy. I used frozen chopped spinach and my immersion blender. The fresh herbs make it lively. The creamy texture is rich without the dairy or calories. Even the kids liked it.

Yummy! This was a "pantry" recipe for me, except for the spinach which I picked up at the Farmer's Market. Used a package of dried garbanzo beans, omitting the white beans, and dried sage, rosemary from the garden. Garnished with shaved parmesan, omitted olive oil. So good I ate it for breakfast!

This was really good ... very easy to make and very simple yet hearty flavors: suprisingling addictive and filling, not to mention healthy. I couldn't stop refilling my bowl! I followed recipe exactly. Definitely include the toppers: Parm Cheese and Olive Oil ... they really add a whole new level to the soup. Perfect for a cold winters day.

This soup had just the right combination of herbs. A very flavorful meal in and of itself. The only thing I did differently was chop up the spinach before adding so that it was less stringy and clumpy when serving.

My boyfriend and I both enjoy this recipe. We are not vegetarian but do try to limit our meat intake and I feel that this soup is flavorful and very easy to make. Don't forget the drizzle of olive oil and parmesan on top though.

This was a very good, soothing soup.Definitely use the full amount of fresh herbs--or more. Using a stick blender makes it extra simple.

I really didn't add enough rosemary, salt or pepper as I was rushing. My 6-yr-old son proclaimed this to be the "best soup in the world," which I think is worth noting! Make sure the spinach is very young to avoid stringy stems after pureeing. I also forgot the parm and olive oil.

Agree with Cambridge. Healthful, but very bland and boring.

Very EASY weeknight meal. Both of my daughters (8 & 10) loved it and wanted thirds... usually one loves something and the other hates it. I'm thrilled when I find something they both like. Husband and I had seconds. Not bad for canned beans. I added more seasoning during each layer of cooking.

The thing I really like about this recipe is that it is a great diet recipe and it is differnt. I did use more rosemary then suggested. It is yummy and worth trying. - Espically if you have someone over who is on one of the countless 'no this no that' diets, it is a pretty safe bet that they can eat it.

We loved this soup! We added about 1/2 butternut squash cut into 3/4 inch squares after we added vegie stock. Then we simmered the squash about 20 minutes before we added the beans. We followed the rest of the recipe until the end when we added the juice of one lemon. Yummy. Great vegetarian meal.

WOW! I think this is my third four forks review ever. If you're looking for "pow" from a soup, this is not for you, but if you want something smooth and simple and comforting, this is a total winner. Since I didn't have garbanzo on hand, I used only white beans (cannelini). I also added a bit of fresh basil with the spinach and sage, and sprinkled chopped sundried tomatoes on top along with the cheese and olive oil. Can't wait to share this recipe!

Very much enjoyed this recipe, especially since it was so easy. I didn't have spinach to add. I did, however, cook up some tubetti pasta and added about 1/4 cup to the bowl before ladling the soup in. With a finish of olive oil, parsley and grated parm, it made a nice modified pasta e fagoli.

Rating: 4
Great recipe! When I made it, I didn't have enough rosemary, had no sage, and no parmesan. Instead, I used the 1/2 T. of rosemary that I had and used Thyme for the other 1/2. I substituted tarragon for the sage, and sprinkled goat cheese on the top in lieu of the parmesan. From this, and from reading the other reviews, I have concluded that there is no way to make this soup taste bad. It was delicious with the substitutions!

WOW!!! THE FLAVORS ARE TO DIE FOR!!! The fresh chopped rosemary leaves releases all those oils and gives this soup a special flavor that brings you back for more. It's very creamy and adding the spinach is a nice touch. A week later my family asked me to make it again. We skipped the sage and pouring of olive oil over the top and just used a little grated cheese. Most surely a keeper and a new tradition for our family. Share more of your families secrets with us!!! From another Italian who likes good food..... buon appetito i grazi.

It was more of a cream soup than a bean soup. Just too creamy for my taste.

Rating: 4
Surprisingly creamy though contains no cream. I garnished with crunchy bacon crumbs and parmesan shavings. I practically pureed the onions and garlic before sauteeing and cooked them until they were almost caramelized because I don't like raw onion taste. I didn't add the spinach at the end but served soup with a spinach salad. This is perfect for brunch with salad or quiche.

Easy, delicious, low fat, and healthy. I used borlotti beans instead of white beans however as they were in the cupboard.I had a very similar soup at Chez Panisse a few years ago which I loved and wanted to re create.(although it was probably made with a bit of cream)

I loved this soup: hearty, filling, and flavorful. Like others, I ate it without oil or cheese and didn't miss them. I also reserved one can of white beans to add after pureeing, but I think it would be good completely pureed as well; it just depends on whether you like your bean soup smooth or chunky. Makes a LOT of soup (maybe 6 large bowls) - next time I'll make half for just my husband and me.

Wonderful winter meal. Like the cook from Santa Ynez, CA I pureed 1/3. In the footsteps of Cara Brunetti Hillyard of Hamilton, VA I too hail from Scranton area and a lineage of greats cooks from my Grandma Nonna and Great Zia to my Mom, so I started with some bacon and panchetta to fatten this dish.

This recipe was fast and very forgiving -- we used 3 parts garbonzo to one part white beans, along with frozen rosemary, sage and spinach, as we had those on hand -- and the result was still fabulous. Garlic infused olive oil and parmesan reggiano were a nice touch, but not really necessary. Very, very nummy!

I'm always looking for a healthy, light yet satisfying dish, and this one certainly fit the bill. I altered the recipe by using regular chicken broth and plenty of dried sage as I had no fresh sage on hand. I thought the base was fantastic, and although I love spinach, it seemed overpowered by the flavor of the soup. Next time I'll keep the spinach out and make a side salad with it. I served it with an artisan bread as a main course, keeping it lighter by refraining from adding the extra olive oil - did add the parm though! Yummy, and I was still full hours later.

A decent, healthy weeknight recipe. I only pureed half of the soup...a good choice because it made the soup a little more rustic and interesting texture-wise. I think I will bump up the fresh herbs a little bit next time. The olive oil at the end is a must.
