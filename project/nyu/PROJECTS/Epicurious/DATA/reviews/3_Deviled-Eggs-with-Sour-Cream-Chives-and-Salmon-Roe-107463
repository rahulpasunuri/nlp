I made these for Easter dinner appetizer- only used 6 eggs. I did not use the Salmon Roe- I wanted a deviled egg recipe that used chives (since I have some growing on the side of my house!). Nice fresh taste- perfect for spring and just a little different than the 'usual' deviled egg recipe. Will make again!

My husband makes this for many of our cocktail-type parties. Well liked and often requested.

Very pretty for my Holiday party. Lots of people asked what the red "things" were. Some kids wouldn't eat it once they found out! Very colorful and delicious. I skipped the step about chopping in the egg whites with the yolk, as I didn't find it necessary.

it was a great and easy dish to serve at a cocktail party! i added more mustard though. and i used japanese tobiko roe instead of salmon roe as they were smaller, and cheaper and more easily available..

Liked the eggs, not the fish eggs, i subbed some chopped Olives for the roe.

I agree with the reviewer who said that this would be a wonderful appetizer for a lavish party, but I don't see someone like Jay Gatsby serving deviled eggs at one of his parties. You see, while most people seem to love deviled eggs, deviled eggs aren't considered sophisticated party fare. Only a true Epicure like David Rosengarten would serve them at a lavish party. Gatsby's no Epicure, and he's certainly no David Rosengarten.

Deviled Eggs are a wonderful appetizer for a lavish party...Do you know what reminds me of lavish parties? The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. A story of love and deception, longing and dreaming and ultimately a death that shakes a man's world forever. The Great Gatsby gives an insight to the life of Jay Gatsby, a wealthy mysterious man who lives next to a curious and nice guy named Nick. As Nick takes the reader through the tale of Gatsby's sordid past, we learn about how Gatsby climbed the ladder of success, and the one thing that brings him toppiling down.

A winner in our kitchen, whitefish roe & all!

I substituted mayonnaise for the sour cream - I was afraid they might be too bland using the sour cream. I served these at a cocktail party, and they went quickly.

We love these deviled eggs, and either salmon or whitefish caviar is fine.

This was a ok, However got to leave out the Roe. I will try it with bacon or a ham next.

Very tasty recipe, although it definitely needs a bit of a boost. Perhaps a few drops of hot pepper sauce would help.

My husband's Russian tradition - simply scoop out the yolk (save for something else) and fill the white with salmon roe - looks beautiful, very easy to prepare, low fat

The filling was very bland, so I added some horseradish mustard & that helped a little. Didn't think the salmon roe & deviled eggs were a good mix.
