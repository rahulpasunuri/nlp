Even though I loved the flavor of these, they were so dry they fell apart and only the very middle of some of them were a bit chewy. I think the 4 cup measurement needs to be adjusted. The not-so-sweet slightly lime flavor is wonderful, though! I would make these again and use less coconut or more egg whites.

I made these macaroons and they were great. I used Splenda for the sugar and it worked very well. They came out crispy and were really good.

I made these for our Seder and they were just delicious. I do have a couple of changes,however. I thought they were going to be too dry with just 2 egg whites, so I used 4 instead and they were the perfect consistency. I also added some fresh lime juice, about a teaspoon, which really added to the flavor. Next time I'm going to try dipping them in some chocolate.

Big disappointment. I love mascararoons and made these for a large Passover dinner. They were so DRY and fell apart. They had zero taste and tasted as though something had been seriously left out even though the recipe had been fallen to exact. Do not make these.

After 1 botched batch I remade these & they turned out fantastic! 1st batch would not hold together & was VERY dry. 7 ounces coconut does NOT equal 4 cups! I made w/ 4 cups & there was no coming back even with more egg whites. There is no mention of lime juice but I added juice of 1 lime during the mixing of egg white w/ sugar. I substituted Coconut Palm Sugar (as I have an allergy to cane sugar). I also mixed in a stand mixer until very frothy. This only made 12 (1 tbsp) macaroons, not 24.

I used the lime juice and because I was using 14 oz of shredded coconut (couldn't find the unsweetened chips) I think it helped these stay together a bit better.

I made these with organic ingredients and added the 1 T of lime juice to the egg whites that people below have discussed. We think they're a great new dessert--will make again after Passover! The pan on the bottom rack did cook the bottoms too quickly (even though I alternated them as suggested in the recipe)--next time I will use the next rack up to prevent any burning of the bottoms.

Something seriously wrong with this recipe. Macaroons were very dry and fell apart.

These are so delicious! I can't stop eating them and I don't even usually like macaroons!! I've got my fourth batch in the oven right now. So yummy and so easy...only "tricky" part is getting the little mounds of coconut to stick together. I used a small cookie scoop and then my finger to stick any "stray" coconut chips. I cannot wait to serve these at our Seder!

The BBC version of this same recipe calls for 1 tblsp. of lime juice. Probably a good idea. I made it with Whey Low, a sugar substitute, for even fewer carbs.

RavenMaven was right, but they've fixed the error except on the side column (to the right) where if you look "at a glance", it still mentions the mysterious lime juice (for now anyway.)

@Raven--Re-read the original post. They are asking about lime "juice". Where on the recipe does it call for that?

@ RavenMaven. Check the second-to-last sentence in the first paragraph: " Whisk in lime zest and salt."

Have not made this recipe yet, Question? In the short list of ingredients you call for lime zest and lime juice, yet the recipe has no lime juice in it.Misprint or mistake in the recipe??
