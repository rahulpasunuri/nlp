I made this without the syrup, and it was fantastic! The syrup was unnecessary. I didn't have cinnamon graham crackers, so I just sprinkled cinnamon over graham cracker crumbs (which were a bit finer, but on hand). The next day I finished the peaches and topping without ice cream, and it was still awesome.

I've been making this since it first appeared. The key is to have ripe peaches that are bursting with juice and flavor. Instead of using the cinnamon sticks I use 1/8 teaspoon of cinnamon. Make sure you reduce the syrup as instructed. Don't serve it with a lot of syrup - naturally it would be too sweet - but you need a little. This keeps for a number of days, so when peaches are in season we indulge ourselves. Serve with a good quality ice cream - french vanilla isn't necessary, but it doesn't hurt.

Wonderful Summer Time dish. BBQ today in the backyard with 11 guest today. Everyone had fun making their own Sundays. Set-up the Sunday station with the syrup, peaches, Breyer's Vanilla ice cream, special crumb mix and whipping cream. Everyone loved it and some dare I say went back for seconds. A good sign that it is a good recipe. =)

Great recipe -- easy to do and a crowd-pleaser. Some recommendations: 1) Use plain vanilla instead of French vanilla ice-cream. French vanilla is a bit too sweet / strong, and holds back some of the natural peach and cinnamon flavors. 2) Agree with the other cooks who omit the syrup. You won't lose anything at all by doing so, unless you want more of that "sundae" feel and want something syrup-y in it. 3) Be generous with the graham-cracker crunch. That was the thing that truly made this dessert a treat.

Following the other suggestions, I omitted the syrup and this was divine, albeit very simple. It enhances the peaches without overwhelming them.

I made this dish as directed (scaled to 2 servings), but added 1 tablespoon peach schnapps to the peaches. Unfortunately, my peaches were a tad underripe. I did find the dish to be very sweet... I think it would be better with vanilla frozen yogurt. (Of course, I'm not used to eating full fat desserts - I thought I'd "splurge" this evening, and I think my tastes may have changed).

This is a fabulous recipe -- perfect end to a summer barbeque. Been making it for years now and learned after the first time that the syrup is superfluous. It's just as good (better, in fact) with the juices from the peaches.

We love this recipe. Have made twice and am making again this weekend. Both times the results and the reviews were excellent. This is simply the best use of fresh peaches I've found.

These sundaes were the absolute perfect scrumptious end to a recent summer dinner party. The entire crew scrapped their dishes clean. The nice thing was there was enough crunchies and syrup left over to make seconds the next night for me and my husband.

Although I rated this recipe a "3" I did have a slight problem with it. I made the syrup portion the night before and cooled it and covered and refrigerated it. It became hard as a rock! The next day prior to serving I put it into the micro (which would be the only way to soften it as I couldn't put it on the stove in the container I stored it in). When we put the sundae together the syrup once again hardened to the point where the guests couldn't really eat that portion of the sundae! The rest of the sundae was delicious but why does the syrup harden up?
