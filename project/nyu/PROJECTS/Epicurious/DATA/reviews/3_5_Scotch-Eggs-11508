A proper Scotch egg shouldn't have any spice - I tried it with the cayenne and it wasn't right. Also it's very difficult to get the correct type of sausage here; we bought British-style pork sausage from a free-range pig farmer and used organic free-range eggs. It's meant to be a summer picnic food, not for Easter, and you NEVER eat it hot in Britain. Also, it shouldn't have herbs - the beauty of it is that you use top quality meat and eggs and not disguise inferior ingredients. Sadly, the American palate likes a lot more spice than the British, so where we go for the genuine subtle classic, most Americans we know would add lots of spicy stuff.

Just had these at Hooley's Irish pub in San Diego, amazing! Not sure if I'd want to deep fry for just the two of us, but being able to order them and try them was great!

These Scotch Eggs are a Christmas tradition in my family. We make a dipping sauce containing mustard (whatever kind you have on hand), sour cream and horseradish. Excellent!

OMG! These were awesome! I used medium sized eggs and 2 pounds of italian ground sausage. I was able to get 12 Scotch balls. We are serving them at our Taste of Cherry Grove picnic today...everyone has to bring a dish from their cultural background. My husband is Scottish so that's why I picked this recipe. I had to try one after frying them up and OMG!!!! Simple and easy to do, not to mention delicious! Will make again! Thanks for a great recipe! Oh, I took the advice of others and dipped mine in spicy brown mustard. YUMMY!!!

These tasted great, but wow, they were a lot of work and time. The recipe is great, but I'm not willing to wait an hour for breakfast (guess I'm not as fast as a professional chef). This is one of those foods that I would pay someone else good money to make for me because they taste so good but are so much hassle to make. Too bad we don't have any English pubs in Charlotte.

We have been using this recipe for about ten years now. We reheat them for Christmas morning with an assortment of mustards. This has become a great Holiday tradition in our home.

I pan fried the scotch eggs, and then wrapped them in refridgerated pie crust and baked them at 350 for 20 minutes to finish them off. They turned out great! Definately serve with a hot mustard dipping sauce.

Didn't change a thing, and it turned out great! Just like we had at an English Pub- style restaurant. We cut it in quarters and served with an English mustard. We warmed up the leftover eggs in the oven for breakfast the next day, yum!

Wow. These were fun and tasty. I doubt I'll make these often, but they are a great use of dyed Easter eggs...

I used mild breakfast sausage in this recipe. If you don't like too much spice, I recommend cutting down or eliminating the cayenne. It would be excellent with or without it. I don't use a deep fryer, so I pan fried them and finished them in a 350 degree oven for an additional 15 minutes. One per person is plenty!

Perfect as is. I ate these many a Sunday afternoon back home in England - Very popular and common over there - these tasted like home. Although I'm sure mustard would be great as a dip - In England we use HP Sauce (a little like A1) Tip - use small eggs or if using larger after cooking and cooling quarter them - much better served very cold. Guests will love them.

I made these for friends and used more expensive but smaller quail eggs. I also wrapped the egg first in grated cheddar cheese then the sausage. Baking them helps to reduce the fat as another suggested. They were raving about this treat! Not for the calorie/cholesterol counters.

YUM! the sweet/hot mustard suggestion was a good one. However, to add insult to injury, thought about substituting scrapple for the ground pork, then topping with squeezy cheezy.

I had searched for this recipe after having some delicious Scotch Eggs at a Brewpub back home in Broadripple, Indiana. This recipe is very tasty and definitely worth the effort! A must for all of those Easter Eggs that the kids hunt for but don't want to eat! An annual favorite!!!

This is a great recipe. I made this for brunch and it was a real hit. I didn't have any bread crumbs so I dredged the sausage covered eggs in flour seasoned with garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, and cayenne and they came out very yummy. A little bit of ketchup and mustard worked really well for the dipping sauce.

Use a sweet/hot mustard for a dipping sauce, it's awesome!!

An excellent appetizer. We took it a step beyond this bar snack item by cutting the finished eggs in quarter wedges and topping them with a dollop of mayonnaise and spoon of black caviar. The eggs can also be baked if you do not wish to deep fry.

This is a fairly traditional recipe and yes, it is chocked full of fat. As an alternative, I roll out 1 lb of sausage and roll 6 eggs at once into a roll, I coat with cracker crumbs and place on a cookie sheet. I bake it for about an hour at 350. I slice on a bias 1/2" thick and serve cold. It's always a hit at parties.

This is probably a major no-no to scotch egg enthusiasts, but I substituted ground turkey sausage for the pork sausage and it turned out great. In the end though, this is so fat-laden that you might as well eat it as the Scots intended! I'll try the orginial version of the recipe just as soon as my arteries unclog.

This version is definately heavy on sausage - 12 oz for 5 or 6 eggs works better. But, folks these are noot just for breakfast anymore - I first had them in an Upper Penninsula brewery as part of a snack platter with other bar food faves like potato skins and cheese sticks. Quartered and dipped in honey mustard they are fantastic paired with a good thick wheat beer or better yet, stout!

Was excited to try this interesting recipe. Had a 12 oz pkg of 50% less fat sausage that worked fine. I DID add additional spice/herbs to add dimension. Since I had less sausage to go around... it took less time to deep-fry. Made a milk gravy to pour over AND had a side of hash browns. Was a very interesting recipe that I would make again. But only maybe once/twice a year. My husband really liked it and I think kids would think it was cool.

This is not for those with any cholesterol or heart problems, but for those who are not "faint of heart" well, once a year or two shouldn't kill you. I would recommend going for broke and topping with a homemade hollandaise sauce, and for some relief from the artery clogging feast, try garden fresh sliced tomatoes and orange slices on the side. Then, forget lunch and go for a power walk instead!

A fried lump larger than the size of an orange. The sage overwhelmed the sausage. It was amusing to serve Easter morning.. but no one ate more than a bite of it.

This recipe preparation goes fast. After wrapping the eggs with sausage, I froze them overnight to be prepared the next morning. I served them with a packaged Bernaise sauce to which I added hot sweet mustard. It was great for a fast Easter morning breakfast.

I found the receipe and a co-worker JJ made them this past weekend. This recipe is "To Die For" Safeways Country style sausage was used. Once the mixture was made wax paper was used to roll out the 4 sections of sausage. A cheese sauce dribbled over would be great. THIS RECEIPE, IT'S GRRRRRRREAT!
