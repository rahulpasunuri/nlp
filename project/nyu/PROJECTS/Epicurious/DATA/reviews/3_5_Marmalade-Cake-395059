I am an experienced baker, but unlike others, I found this cake dry and floury. Perhaps I made a mistake in the measurements, especially since I reduced the amounts as well as the size of the pan. That being said, it was a waste of time and ingredients. If I were going to make again (which I'm not), I would make a larger amount of the orange syrup, poke holes in the still-warm cake and spoon some syrup over to be absorbed. I also thought it would be even more attractive with candied orange slices on the bottom of the pan,or topped with them afterwards.

A light and moist cake with the crumb texture of a pineapple upside down cake or rum cake, but not too boozy at all (yay, i'm not a fan of strong boozy flavor). Easy to make and presents well with a subtle orange flavor. Can star as part of an upscale dinner or a simple potluck.

This is a delicious and moist cake. I used dried cranberries instead of currants. The candied peel on top is a must, don't skip it! This was heaven on a plate.

A great cake -moist & flavourful. Made as written except replaced the currants with raisins.

Delicious and moist, wonderful rich flavor. I didn't make the orange peel however. The cake was wonderful on its own.

Made this for Easter dessert. Very rich, moist and dense cake and tastes a lot like the Grand Marnier. Don't need too much of the sugar syrup on top because the cake is pretty sweet. Think it would be better for brunch than for dessert, but really enjoyed the cake and will definitely make again.

This was terrific. Made it for Easter dessert and everybody raved. I baked it on Saturday, let cool, then stored it in an airtight container. Sunday afternoon I put the candied orange peel on top and, because I thought I'd overbaked it a tad, I drizzled quite a bit of the syrup on top. The cake soaked it up and turned out wonderfully moist. Will definitely make it again.

Well, as it cooled, the cake absorbed the syrup that was boiling around it. (Note that I didn't mistakenly add the candied orange peel syrup to the cake!) I wouldn't call this a cake. The texture was a little gummy but not unpleasantly so. Overall, it was pretty good, but I probably won't make it again.

I can't rate this yet because I haven't tasted it. It's been in the oven for 40 minutes now. You don't often see a cake boil while it bakes. I keep checking the recipe to see whether I added too much liquid, but I seem fine. There certainly was no need to smooth the top of the cake when I poured the batter into the pan. When it says you can brush with syrup, I thought it meant from the orange peel -- not that the cake would bake in its own syrup!
