This is a foolproof custard that I use for my Christmas Trifle every year. My Scottish mother passed this recipe on to me and it is delicious. So for those who thought the recipe produced too much custard, you haven't invited enough people for Christmas Dinner !

This recipe is used in Cranberry Trifle, also found on this site. It was not meant to stand alone.

Pretty good stuff, but unless you're cooking for an army, why do you need five cups of the stuff? I halved the recipie. This stuff wouldnt hold up in a custard pie, if that's what you're looking for. But it tastes really good!

This custard is mellow with a fruity wine
