Excellent! I added a few more peppercorns and dill. It was outstanding.

I read several of the reviews before i made the recipe. although most people liked the lemon mayonnaise, a couple of people didn't like it at all. so i made a compromise: i used less mayonnaise but didn't cut the other ingredients. i also cooked the liquid down to a roux (really! i didn't mean to but turned my attention away for a minute and it cooked down to almost a paste) before i added it. The dinner was a huge success!!

I found the salmon too try but think I over-cooked it. I agree with the last reviewer and didn't particularly care for the lemon mayonnaise. I will try this again with a different topping (and like the previous reviewer's idea of covering the salmon with the sauce and cucumbers.)

Salmon was pretty good but I thought that the lemon mayo was terrible. I would make the salmon again but would find another sauce to serve with it.

I have had only raves about this one. I found that if you let the salmon cool in the poaching liquid the salmon will be very moist. When I prepare this for a large crowd I use my large roasting pan with a layer of heavy duty foil under the large side of salmon. Wheh the salmon is done and cooled just use this foil"lifter" and it will come out in one nice unbroken piece. The mayo sauce is really excellent.

This was a great, super easy recipe that I quadrupled and made for a recent brunch. I would however recommend getting the special fish dish to poach. I had to use my largest 10 (?) qt pot and do it in batches. I also poached the fish the night before and didn't realize that salmon will stick together (I stacked them after poaching so the next morning, it was kind of messy to seperate them). The other person that recommended spreading the mayo over the fish and topping with cucumbers was a savior because that is how I hid my mistakes (broken fish). Got lots of raves about this and I even liked it and I'm not a big salmon eater.

I have made this dish a number of times for brunch and for dinner to rave reviews from all my guests. I usually split the mayonaise in two and add some spice (carribean sauce and/or Asian chilli sauce) to one of them--it goes very well with the fish

The clam juice can be a little stinky, but the finished product is just lovely. I did not think that thinning the mayonnaise mixture with the reduced poaching liquid was worth the time or the smell in my kitchen, but the mayo did make the recipe just great!

Served at a Christmas party- uniformly rave reviews

Made this last summer for a family gathering and was asked to make it again this year for a Easter brunch. I borrowed someone else's idea.....coated the cooled fish with a layer of lemon mayonnaise,(covers a seam if you needed to poach in pieces) then covered with overlapping rows of thinly sliced english cucumber for a "scales" effect.Really makes an impressive presentation! Extra sauce on the side.

Wonderful dish. The sauce is so fresh tasting. Perfect on a warm summer evening. My guests were licking their fingers.

Fantastic, and so easy to modify for quantity. I made for a group in the oven. The sauce is so good, I could drink it. But that would be gross.

I found the salmon too dry, but I did get distracted and left it in too long. I tried twice, because I forgot I had tried the recipe before, and all the comments were so good. Can't stand the sauce, way too sour.

Great recipe for poaching salmon. I made a mustard dill sauce instead, but next time I'll try the mayonnaise from this recipe.

Made this for a party and was a big hit. Will make again. So easy to make ahead. Used a 3 1/2 pound of salmon. Simmered for 20 minutes. Loved the mayonaise sauce!

I made this for a dinner of 12 and everyone just swooned. That heavenly mayonaise is a must repeat in itself.

Made this for a girls-night-in dinner. Everyone loved it! Made the salmon a few hours before serving to chill. Very easy to make.

I thought this recipe was wonderful. I went to reach for the emergency clam juice I always have on hand and realized that I must have forgotten to replace it last "emergency"...so I went ahead with the recipe using water. I'm sure the clam juice would only have made it better, but it was supurb as it was. And the mayonaise was fantastic!! I poached the salmon steaks a few hours prior to the meal, and had time to trim and clean the dark flesh off of the pieces. I served it on a platter garniched with lemon wedges, fresh dill, and a small crystal bowl for the lemon mayonaise. I will make this again and again.

This was wonderful and got raves. I poached a whole side of Salmon in pieces, re-assembled on a plate, covered the salmon with lemon mayonnaise (like icing a cake), then used super thin slices of cucumber and assembled shingle style as "scales" on top of salmon. Very pretty and tasty. Surrounded by fresh dill and extra lemon mayo on side. Great for large parties.

We prepared this several early afternoon and served it around 7 pm. We served it with a broccoli salas, purchased at the supermarket (Bashes in Tempe) and very good. We loved the fish, it was easy and we will do it again.

This is so simple and so great. I've made it several times and each time my guests have raved. The nicest thing is that it is a do-ahead recipe.
