I guessed "1 cup" but I note the left arrowhead is on the same key as the "," so perhaps it was supposed to be "less than 1 cup". Either way it smells fab! I used lychee liqueur instead of calvados because I had it.

Wise readers, can anyone help? It says to reduce the liquid to " , cup" - one cup? half a cup? What did you do? I can't wait to make this for Thanksgiving, but don't want to screw it up... Thanks!

This is a great fruit compote when pears are in season. I halve this recipe (It does make a lot) and serve it with an assortment of cheeses and fruits.

I made this to accompany a cheese course in a multi-course meal and it was simply fantastic. Everyone enjoyed it very much.

I made this to top the New York Cheesecake (which is outstanding) and it was really nice. I didn't have figs, but I still think it came together well. Also, I used kirsch, which was nice with the cherries. I really think this tasted best when I first made it. I refrigerated it overnight and served it warmed with the cheesecake, and I think it lost a little something.

This was a nice addition to the Thanksgiving table but I made some changes....I added 6 cracked allspice berries, an entire 8 oz. package of figs and about 10 slices of crystallized ginger (Chopped). Also, I didn't have Calvados so substituted Grand Marnier. And I garnished it with halved slices of fresh grapefruit. Everyone loved it.
