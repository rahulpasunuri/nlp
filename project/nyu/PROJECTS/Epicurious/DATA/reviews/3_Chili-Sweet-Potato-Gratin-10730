This was absolutely delicious. I do agree that the sweet potatoes were a little overwhelmed with flavor, but some bites were out of this world. I would add a lot more cheese. And I actually used an adobo red sauce that already had chiles and garlic in it, which was very nice.

Delicious and SO easy. I craved it for days after I made it. You can alter the heat to your liking.

I used butternut squash instead, and threw in some jalapenos. It was excellent.

I used New Mexican red chile, instead of canned enchilada sauce. It's like cheese enchiladas with sweet potatoes, instead of tortillas. Very tasty, but the flavor of the sweet potatoes was somewhat overwhelmed. I would like to try to version in the notes with cream and chipotle chile.
