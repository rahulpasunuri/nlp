True Southern Cornbread is ONLY made in cast iron. Period.

This is not Southern Cornbread, Southern cornbread has neither sugar nor creamed corn. True Southern Cornbread is made from stone ground corn meal with baking powder, and no flour. Flour is only used with cornmeal in breading, catfish, etc.

I served this at a summer barbeque at my home to rave reviews...of all the food I made, this one was the recipe they requested. I did prepare my own peppers per the recipe, and use all of it on top, which looked crowded, but added moisture. I also ended up using 1/2 of a can of creamed corn, only because I was making 2 and just didn't want to bother with what little would have been left over had I measured. I suspect this added the moisture that appears to be 'missing' according to the other recipes. Try it with 1/2 a can, and see if it doesn't fix that.

I didn't give it four forks because it needed adjustments. I followed the cook from Palatka's instructions after reading several reviews that said it was too dry, but I would also suggest adding 5-10 minutes extra cooking time. Other modifications were: I finely diced the pepper and mixed it and the onions into the batter rather than topping it and I I used bacon fat instead of vegetable shortening to line an iron skillet -- it turned out really well. I used half of it to turn out a batch of corn bread dressing and everyone raved!

Tis is good,but dry. Use 2 eggs, 1 stick butter, and 3/4 cup of buttermilk. Moist,crispy, and delicious.

Just a word to the cook from Nashville, a seasoned cast iron frying pan works great for this recipe or any other cornbread one for that matter. greasing and heating the pan first ensures a nice crispy crust.

I thought this corn bread sounded and looked great, until I cut into it and found it to be very dry. It did have a great golden color and crunchy crust, but the inside dryness was disappointing. I am still searching for the perfect corn bread recipe! Gioia

I thought this was quite good. I honestly don't think that an oven-proof skillet is necessary to bake the cornbread in. I searched high and low to locate one in the stores and concluded that I could have baked the cornbread in a standard baking pan.

This recipe was just okay. Not worth repeating!
