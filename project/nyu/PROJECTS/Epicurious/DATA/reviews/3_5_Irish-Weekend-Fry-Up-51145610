A fry is not a fry without baked beans, in Ireland, in England, in Scotland.

Hilarious, a recipe for a fry up! Don't think I'll ever understand why Americans insist on putting sugar on tomatoes, you won't find it on any fry in the UK.

You really should get the proper back bacon from Ireland or at least cured in the Irish style - it is completely different than Canadian bacon or "rashers" streaky bacon. to Lynska from Amherst, NY - you can get all the Irish meats by mail order if you don't have a local store carrying them. I get Tommy Moloney's out of Maspeth, NY out west in Seattle at a local market. http://www.tommymoloneys.com/irish-specialty-foods/corned-beef-traditional-puddings?___store=default

Nine paragraphs to describe how to make bacon, eggs, sausage, mushrooms and tomato? Here's my version. Bung everything into a frying pan in roughly this order: meat & mushrooms, egg & tomato. Cook til done. Put on plate. Pour Guinness. Consume everything.

For a more authentic "fry-up" before emptying the bacon and sausage drippings, fry the bread in them. Not good for the arteries but mmmmm does it taste good.
