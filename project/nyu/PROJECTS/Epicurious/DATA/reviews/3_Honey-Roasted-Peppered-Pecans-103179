I reduced the pepper to 1 tsp, reduced the cooking time to 10 min., and sprayed a sheet of foil with non-stick cooking spray, which eliminated the sticking problem. These turned out great. Theyre for this recipe... http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Mixed-Greens-with-Pecans-Goat-Cheese-and-Dried-Cranberries-108714.

This recipe with alterations- a little less pepper and less cooking time- is fantastic. I got addicted to a similar product in my local grocery and knew I had to start making it myself. Very, very easy and everyone raves about it! I eat almost the whole thing myself though and must hold back making it too often. As sweets go, this one is close to being healthy.

Awful. 15 minutes burned the pecans and then they stuck to the wax paper - I had to throw the whole batch out. At least I knew from reading it that 2 tsp pepper was too much. I cut that in half, but in the end it didn't matter. House smelled like burned pecans for hours.

I made these for a party, and people really liked them. Keep an eye on them when they're cooking--I nearly burned them.

I didn't use as much pepper as the recipe called for, as per the advice of previous reviewers. Still, these pecans are rather ho-hom. For a much better candied pecan recipe, use the one that requires balsamic vinegar, from "SPINACH SALAD WITH MANGO AND CANDIED PECANS." Now those are yummy. Also, the suggested cooking times were much too long; I took the pecans out of the oven at least 5 minutes before they were supposed to be removed and they were EXTREMELY toasted (i.e. dark on inside).

As suggested by the other reviewers, I cut the pepper in half. I also substituted maple syrup for the honey to give the dish a Canadian spin. It was a big hit with our dinner company.

I normally like hot stuff but this was way too much pepper for me. Next time I'll cut the pepper in half. Also, I spread them on wax paper to cool and it was very difficult to get them off of the paper, next time I cool them on non-stick foil.

I made this recipe to give to my customers as a Christmas gift, it was a huge success and easy. Far better than store bought. I put in a mason jar with a small ribbon and piece of material around the top. This is the best of the best

These are great and easy. I didn't have allspice, so I substituted a little cinnamon. Worked fine. I think people who don't like things super-spicy could cut the pepper down quite a bit without hurting the flavor. The pepper in them will pep you up!

I made for a party. They were quickly gone. Received a lot of posituve feedback. Next time I will cut back on the pepper just a little. I like to learn how to keep them from remaining stickey.

I won't make it again because I hate working with the honey, and there's other pecan recipes that don't call for honey. It's pretty good. Be very careful about measuring that pepper, though. It was almost too much. And mine didn't need to cook quite that long.

Quick to make and nice to have out on the table for cocktail hour. Took to an easter dinner and everyone liked them.

I made these for my husband who is a real pepper-freak! He was CRAZY about them. I made another batch to take as a hostess gift - she and her husband loved them. Even I, who am not wild for pepper, really enjoyed them. They did stick to the waxed paper until they really set up. Next time I will simply turn them out onto the drainboard. This is a "keeper".
