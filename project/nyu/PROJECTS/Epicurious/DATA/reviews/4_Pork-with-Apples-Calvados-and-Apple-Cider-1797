I made this last night for a dinner party and it was a terrific hit! I made it simpler by browning a whole pork loin, then browning the shallots in the same pain; browned the apples quickly in same pan, and put them all together and roasted them in oven. When finished cooking (about 20 min), I deglazed pan w/ apple brandy* and cream. *I couldn't find the apple brandy so made my own w/ 1/2 brandy, 1/2 apple juice concentrate. Served w/ mashed potatoes and sauteed leeks & carrots (sauteed in olive oil & butter, seasoned w/ nutmet and splash of lemon). Super easy and good!

Fantastic dish. Served for friends over lunch and everyone cleaned their plate. Used a bit less butter than listed and less cream in the sauce (1 heaping TBSP). I doubled the apple cider to compensate but I should have trippled it and put 2TBSP of cream for there to be more. I was surprised by the amount of apples but ended up making the 4 which was great to go with the pork. Served with spinach and bulgur on the side. Will definitely make again.

Loved this dish! Can use half the apples as there were far too many. We used regular brandy as apple brandy was not available. Next time we will half the cream or double the brandy/apple cider to allow more of the apple flavor to come through in the pan sauce.

Roasted pork whole. Cut WAY back on cream-1/3 cup! Then it's excellent. Recipe as written has too much cream!

This is one of our favorite meals & I make this a few times each year! It is fantastic exactly as written but is also wonderful with pounded chicken breasts if you're in the mood for chicken. Have used Herbs de Provence a few times instead of just thyme - either are nice. It's also relatively quick & easy which is always nice.

Everyone loved it, and will be making again. Delicate flavour, no need to change anything.

Made as written save for adding triple the amount of thyme (just left my fresh thyme on stems then pulled out of sauce when completed). I thought this was very easy to prepare, even with the pounding and 3 separate cooking steps (apples, pork, sauce). Sauce was very flavorful with thyme and apple essence, guests loved it and I paired dish with roasted carrots and a fruited basmati pilaf. This is going in my recipe box!

Easy and very tasty. I roasted the tenderloin whole as other reviewers have done which saves a lot of effort without diminishing the taste. I served it with roasted potatoes and crunchy peapods. The only change I suggest is limiting the apples. With only three apples, we still had too many left over vs. the pork.

Rating: 3
Excellent flavor and fairly easy to make. My only complaint in the half and half I used (instead of the whipping cream) looks a little chunky after it is cooked. Other than that, yummy.

Excellent recipe as written, and suitable for company. Not at all difficult to prepare, either--just have all the ingredients prepped before starting and it's a very quick, and elegant, dinner.

WOW! This is wonderful stuff. The dish is as good as any five star dining spot would serve - and in your own kitchen with a nice bottle of French wine - Superb! Don't change a thing and use fresh thyme in the sauce.

While this was a very tasty and easy recipe, I found it worked better when I cooked the whole tenderloin, and sliced it afterwards.

I made this recipe as written with the exception of the pork tenderloin. Instead of cutlets I used a pork roast. I sauteed it in the pan with butter and a little olive oil so the butter would not burn as easily. I finished the recipe in the same pan so I would get the pork flavor. We were underwhelmed with the result. The pork was good, the apples were good, and the sauce was good. But there was no WOW factor. For some reason, the dominant flavor was cream. I used the correct amounts of everything except more fresh thyme. We liked the sauce but felt it was way too delicate to stand up to the pork and apples. The dish is not complicated but there are several steps and I felt it was just not worth the effort. Good, but not one I would make again.

Fantastic!!! This dish really impresses my guests each time I serve it. In a pinch I once substituted blackberry brandy for the calvados and it was tasty!

Rating: 4
This was absolutely incredible. We made it with a roast pork, and as we were finalizing the sauce, we incorporated the pan drippings which gave it a nice meaty flavor. Other than that, we made no modifications and it was positively heavenly. Will absolutely be making this again.

Difficult to source all the ingredients here so I use dried shallots and thyme and apple juice. I also make a pork roast and then slice it, adding the sauce and apples on top before serving. I wish I could try this recipe with all the correct ingredients but my husband loves it anyways!

Made two subs, Granny Smiths plus a bit more sugar for Golden Delicious, by choice and Cognac for Calvados by necessity. Will probably do the same next time. Served with baked potatoes and Brussels Sprouts for a lovely meal.

Another great recipe to serve guests. It is no wonder we like to cook at home, it's hard to find a restaurant that could make a dinner that compares. Oh Soooo Good!

I made this recipe using the porkchops I had on hand. I simmered the pork chops in the sauce. I added a small container of Cider Confit with Apple and Calvados instead of cider. At the last moment I decided to add a handful of dried morels we had on hand. I served it with fresh steamed brussel sprouts. There was not a drop of sauce left by the end of the meal. My in-laws are visiting from Normandy and they raved about it. Will definitely make again.

I was not impressed with this recipe. Although the pork was yummy, the sauce was a bit bland and didn't seem to add much to the dish.

This is very good! I've made it twice for guests. A hint if you don't want to spring for the Calvados but don't want to use cheap brandy either, substitute Pommeau de Normandie for both the Calvados and the cider (so use 1/2 cup.) It's a cider-based apertif from Normandy and cost less than $30 at my local (Canadian) wine store - way cheaper than Calvados. Nice to sip while you're cooking too!

Rating: 4
A all time favorite. The apples and sauce are divine. Goes great with mashed potatoes to help soak up extra sauce. I agree that calvados is very expensive and another type should work fine.

Rating: 4
So good and so easy to make! I've made it camping (wow!), at home, and at a special annual gourmet meal with other friends, not to mention that I make it about once every 2 months. The cream sauce is subtle, but delicious. When we were camping, it was unbelievable! And sitting around the campfire with a cup of coffee and a small glass of Calvados after dinner was fabulous!

We returned from apple picking today with a cartload of Northern Spy apples and some fresh cider and chose this recipe to try out our bounty on. Superb! Excellent with the Spys, as they kept their shape and had good combination of sweet-tartness. Beautiful dish made as is, and also with a little extra cider added for good measure.

Rating: 4
Tried this when it was published in Bon Appetit years ago. Decided to visit it again and it just gets easier and better. Calvados can be obtained at any better wine shop -- but it is expensive, any apple brandy will do. Save the Calvados for after dinner in a snifter.

I thought this dish was excellent! I, too, doubled the sauce and simmered the cooked pork in it instead of just keeping the pork warm in the oven. My entire family LOVED it! Not hard at all to make, which makes it even more appealing. Bought my pork tenderloin at the butchers, not Stop and Shop (huge difference!)

Rating: 4
This was SO good! I made it for a friend's birthday dinner--did change a few things: I roasted a pork loin, doubled the sauce recipe, and about 10 minutes before serving mixed together the sauce and apples. I sliced the pork loin and arranged it on a platter and spooned the sauce down the middle. I passed the extra sauce around for those who wanted more. The presentation was beautiful and the flavors of the apples and sauce blended so well. I would definitely make this again. My friends loved it.

Doubled the recipe, cooked for 6 Adults 2 kids. all but DH loved it. i added carmelized onions which defintely added to the meal. Didn't really need 2 c. of cream for doubling the sauce, i had plenty. I guess i didn't pound the meat to the correct thickness though, cause it wasn't cooked all the way through, but it was still awesome. Had to substitue brandy (i added liquid from teh sauted apples back to the sauce too) for the calvados, couldn't find ANY apple liquor. Any one from San Diego area recommend a place to get some? I'm new here.

I loved this recipe. I couldn't find cider so I used apple juice and it was wonderful!

My friends raved about this dish. I added more sugar to the apples to sweeten them up, and cooked them longer than the recipe stated. The pork was super-tender, and the Calvados cream sauce was outstanding. I doubled the recipe for a large group, but quadrupled the sauce recipe to make sure there was enough. In doing this, I did not use all of the cream or it would have been too much. We definitely needed the extra sauce!!

Went looking for this so I could enter it in my private collection of recipes. Saw all the forks and had to vote. This came out perfect the first time I made it and every time since. I use this when I am entertaining and want to "wow" guests with just "a little dish" I pulled together.

Delicious, and easy to prepare. I didn't see the need to pound the pork slices. I just cut them half an inch thick and left it at that. Served with spaetzle and brussels sprouts w/ bacon & thyme. Poured a riesling from Alsace - awesome match.

Very nice, however very similar to another pork dish I do ALL OF THE TIME. Take a look at the pork with pears and pear brandy cream sauce.....a tad better. This was lovely, but then again I love anything with cream and shallots. BTW if you like pork tenderloin try the pork tenderloin with cranberry port sauce.

This dish was perfect for a crisp Autumn night! I carmelized the apples and shallots to give them extra rich flavor. I couldn't find apple brandy so I substituted applejack instead and it worked fine! I used a little less cream and a little more cider and applejack. I reduced the sauce longer for more intense flavors. Delicious!

This is one of my favorite recipes. I've tried it with chicken and it works well too. Do try browning the pork a little longer (if you like that) and carmelizing the onions.

Excellent recipe, had to add more salt & pepper than recipe called for. Could not find Calvados or Apple Brandy, went with apple schnapps. Next time I will preheat my saute pan longer so that pork medallions brown more.

Carmelizing the apples really adds to the dish. It's not "bland" at all, but it is "subtle." Used fresh thyme and Calvados and we enjoyed it.

Loved the ingredients and reviews seemed good so I doubled the recipe. Good but I thought it could use more flavor. So with the leftovers, I carmelized the apples (by cooking longer over medium-high heat) and carmelized some onions in another pan. Layered the chops, onions, sauce, apples and just a touch more Calvados in a roasting pan. Covered with foil and baked at 300 degrees for 10 minutes. Delicious! And definitely more flavor.

My husband and I really liked the sauteed apples with the pork; however we found the dish, over all, to be lacking something.

Rating: 4
I really liked this recipe! I used regular brandy and didn't have any cider. I used the wrong apples and had to add lots more sugar than called for. In place of cider, I reduced some apple juice with a pinch of cinnamon and a tsp or so of sugar. The fresh thyme was really great. I used additional thyme as a garnish. Everyone just loved it. Make sure you add enough salt. It made all the difference in the world. I'm sure if I had used all the right ingredients I would have rated this 4 forks. My guests were very impressed. Delicious! Try it!!!!

When I first tried this pork recipe, it was so wonderful and easy that I vowed to make it part of my repertoire. I have since attended culinary school and work as a personal chef; this combination of flavors continues to gain wows at the dinner table. Many of my friends from school have also adopted it as their own. It works in summer, in winter. It's simple, elegant, and reliable. The brandy however should be Calvados; using apple brandy doesn't cut it. The cider is an important element - don't use apple juice. The sauce is out of this world, but never enough, so I do try to increase the general proportions to at least one and a half. Otherwise, we'd all be licking the plates.

What am I missing! I tried this recipe as it sounded incredible and everyone rated it four forks! My husband and I both found this to be very bland and a big disappointment after all the prep work -the apple flavour did not come through - all we could taste was a very bland cream sauce. I wouldn't make this again.

Great dish. Always a success with company. I've made this dish for many years. Don't let the apples turn you off. They add a great taste and you don't need to eat the apples on you dish but don't make the dish without them.

I wanted to make a special meal for my family, just to celebrate the occasion of us all having a meal together despite our busy schedules! My challenge was to come up with an idea without running to the market. I used ordinary brandy, the apples I had in my crisper and half and half instead of cream. It was a huge hit. My 6 year old who eats only because he would fall over if he didn't had 3 helpings! It was one of the quietest meals we have had in a long time!
