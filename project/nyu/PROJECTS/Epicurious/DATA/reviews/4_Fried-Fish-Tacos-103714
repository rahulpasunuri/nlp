This was the most HORRIFICLY CONCEIVED RECIPE ON PLANET EARTH, I've made fried fish..this batter and your directions ended up in my ruining 16 dollars worth of fresh cod...thank God I didn't buy the sea bass I was considering. I seriously wish pain and misery for the person who conceived this piece of garbage recipe.

Very good base recipe. I had fresh cod and the idea of Mediterranean style, which I do variations of frequently with the rockfish abundant here, just didn't appeal. Despite it being summer, frying it was all that sounded good, and good it was, indeed! I made a change that I always do when frying most things in batter: ADD EGGS. I added one chicken egg that, while "unsized" from a local farm, is a bit bigger than an XL-grade store egg, so if you use large eggs, I'd probably do 2. I only fried them once; the egg makes the batter fry wonderfully crisp but light and double frying is entirely unnecessary. I also, though, cut the filet into smaller pieces, partly because I'm lazy and didn't feel like taking out the bones with pliers so I just cut that 3/4" wide strip away&gave my master cat much-loved bits of cod sushi from the odd little strands left. The main reasons, though, I make them smaller are the very short cooking time (2mins) and having it even--makes it more foolproof and there's little risk of undone fish or of overdone batter. I know the "not dark" thing makes them look good, but the IPA I used was moderately dark. I didn't personally care if they were darker. Heck, my flour blend is also much darker--I don't DO enriched, only true whole grain--so they may look burnt to someone who bothers looking through the accompaniments, but I've never had a complaint :) I looked at the Rubio's out of curiosity, and while it's a sound option, I never use mayo (soy allergy) and had already started my own sauce with lebni (cultured sour cream; creme fraiche&quark are good subs for it, but regular sour cream is not), yogurt, lime juice, capers, Wickles(zesty/spicy) relish, dill, coriander seed powder, cumin, French tarragon, sea salt, fresh ground pepper, Hungarian paprika, and mustard powder... and maybe something I'm forgetting. The dill, paprika, and mustard seed powder are prominent, capers & relish about equal. I really just do it by eye &taste it as I'm going along.

For those who missed the earlier Rubio's sauce recipes - they are far back in the ratings - they are similar and both are very good! Rubios Sauce  Two recipes 1/2 c. plain yogurt, 1/2 c mayonnaise, 1/2 t. cumin, 1/2 t. dill, .25 t. cayenne, juice of 1 lime and salt to taste. Version #2: 1/2 c. plain yogurt, 1 dollop sour cream, 1 dollop mayonnaise, 1/2 t. cumin, juice of 1 lime and salt to taste.

Wonderful recipe. Very easy and quick. Only fried the fish once, and used the rubio sauce recipe a reader recommended to coat the tortillas. No need for sour cream as an accompaniment. Added chopped red onions to the accompaniments. Will use sauce instead of tartar for other recipes.

I have made this recipe many times with fish or prawns or both. Tonight the fish is red snapper. I shredded napa cabbage, made pico de gallo with tomatoes and jalapenos from the garden, and added coriander, Mexican crema, mayo and low fat yogurt to the rubio's sauce. No matter what the variation is (normally what I have on hand) this meal is always tasty and a pleaser for any guest for whom I have made it.

I haven't made these yet (will tonight tho), but I have a solution for the fish smell. All you need to do is fill a spray bottle with vinegar/water mix. Finish cleaning the counter and stove with the vinegar/water mixture, and then turn the fan on above the stove and spray some of the vinegar/water mixture in it. Myself, I prefer to use a bit more vinegar in the mix. Don't worry about the smell at first - once the vinegar dries you won't notice it at all. This *really* works very well.

Absolutely delightful. I brought the ingredients for the Rubio sauce as recommended and was pleased. Look forward to making again.

These are awesome and e-a-s-y. The fish pieces stuck badly to the bottom of the pan we were frying them in but I think that was user error. They taste delicious however, I will NOT be making these again only because my house stunk like fried fish for a week afterword...and I mean stunk (even with the stove exhaust fan on and the kitchen door open the whole time we were cooking)!

Rating: 4
Oy! This recipe is easy and makes a good batter...BUT, the batter stuck horribly to the bottom of the pan even with the recommended amount of oil-not to the fish AND our house smelled terribly of fried fish for days afterward. Very good batter but will not make again inside the house...maybe will fry over a gas stove outdoors someday.

loved this! I used a white sauce similar to the rubio sauce- 1/2 cup lowfat sour cream, 1/2 cup low fat mayo 1/2 teaspoon of both cumin and oregano, 1 teaspoon of both cayenne pepper and capers, one jalapeño pepper. Finely diced jalapeño and capers. Mixed all ingredients and squeezed fresh lime juice- 1 lime. Put in the fridge and let it sit for an hour. Note, this is a spicier version of the rubio sauce, but so good! I served tacos with a side of a fresh avocado half and cilantro. A tomato and cucumber and lime salad. Enjoy

I didn't "rate" this recipe because I only followed the directions for the fish. The fish was super easy to make for a quick weeknight meal and came out perfectly whether I fried it once or twice (I did two batches and tried both methods). For toppings I used a "salad" of shredded cabbage, red onion and cilantro. I also made a fresh salsa with local tomatoes, cilantro, green onion and tons of lime. Finally, as many other reviewers have done I added sour cream. I used minced garlic, salt and lots of lime juice to make a thin, creamy sauce. Absolutely addictive - this just tastes so FRESH, like summer. I'm afraid I'll never want to grill or saute the fish again for tacos!

great, easy, delicious...invited doubtful neighbors, we ate it all! No need to fry twice (temp 375)...rubio sauce and red/green cabbage. Might use chipotle peppers instad of cayenne next time.

I've made this time after time and my family absolutely loves these. I use white corn tortillas which work very well with the mild fish flavors here. If you don't have a can of beer, use club soda. I use which ever one I have on hand and both work equally well. Also, reduce the salt to 1 Tsp. I only fry the fish once, which is absolutely sufficient. We use talapia. Be sure to make the Rubio's sauce that has the mayo and dill. It's the best of the two offered in readers suggestions (at least to us). Good luck! My family considers fish taco night a treat...go figure - we love them!

I combined this recipe with the catfish taco recipe from this site. I used tilapia filets and fried them in the beer batter. I used a little more beer than called for to make the batter a tad less thick. Also used the baja cream from this site as well as the tomato & avocado salsa (from the catfish tacos recipe) and topped with shredded savoy cabbage. I used floured tortillas nuked in the microwave. They were simply outstanding. My husband and I moaned with every bite!

I can't tell you how much we liked these! Only thing we didn't like was that the corn tortillas turned gluey during warming, so it's back to warming them in a skillet. Will try the Rubio's sauce!

YUM :) I have made this a few times now and thisis sooo incredible! Tried it to night with a avacado mango salsa, cabbage and rubio sauce (thanks Portland reviewer this sauce rocks) I too found the avocado was too rich for this dish...that said, I ate four of them ;) I use the Panko crumbs and red snapper and do not deep fry twice Usually serve this with cabbage, lime slices squeezed over, red onion and cilantro, that wonderful pancho sauce (YUM) only because this is how I remember eating fish tacos in Mexico!!

I'm a deep-frying novice, and the fish came out perfectly. I used hake, which the fish shop said was similar to cod, but I found it tastier. What a great simple recipe.

Rating: 4
This was so yummy and much easier than I thought it would be. Unlike others, I did need to fry my fish twice. After the first fry they were not as crisp as they should have been. Heating the oil up to the higher temp and re-frying them made them perfectly crispy.

Rating: 4
So easy and delicious. Many thanks to the Portland cook who posted the recipe for Rubio sauce, it really makes the dish. As others have said, no need to double fry. As for the tortillas, we've had them both with corn and flour tortillas. We all prefer the flour tortillas. Popping them in the microwave preps them nicely.

Sooo Easy and tastey......My girlfriend loved it! Finally a way to make halibut that you can really grind on. Speaking of......yah she loved it!

This recipe is great and my husband and 1 & 2-year old daughters loved it as well! I assembled the tacos with shredded cabbage, sharp cheddar cheese, sour cream, avocado slices, and pico de gallo (The pico was easy to make: I put tomatoes, cilantro, white onion, & lime juice in the food processor). I used tilapia instead of cod and it only needed to be fried once. Next time, I will mash some avocado with the pico de gallo to make guacamole. I tried the Rubio's sauce, but no one really liked it--it seemed the sour cream was better. Also, I moistened the corn tortillas with a little bit of water before heating them in the foil, and it made them steaming fresh, like from a restaurant. I will add this simple dish to my repertoire, and it will definitely become a regular meal in my house, along with a meal for guests! Great and impressive dish--I would recommend it to anyone!

Rating: 4
Really good! The only thing I changed was adding 2-3 teaspoons of cayenne pepper to the fish batter to give it a little kick. No need to fry the fish twice, once is plenty. I served these tacos with shredded cabbage rather than lettuce, tomatoes, chopped green onions, sour cream, monterey jack cheese, salsa, and fresh guacamole with lime. It was a huge hit and this recipe will absolutely be used time and again!

Excellent recipe. The kids and Wife loved it. I agree with other reviewers on the Rubio sauce being a must. Not a radish fan, so substituted tomatoes. If you eat the battered fish alone, it may seem a little salty, but in combination with everything else it was just right. Making it again for football party on Sunday.

I made this with the suggested Rubio's sauce and panko crumbs (no 2nd frying.) It was wonderful. Thanks for the tips! The batter really was salty, but not noticable with a double thickness of corn tortillas and cabbage and all that. But if you were eating them straight like fish sticks(my preschool-age daughters did that) you would probably want to cut down on the salt. I piled the fried fish on a bed of shredded cabbage and garnished with lime wedges and lots of cilantro sprigs so everyone could build their own tacos. I also made homemade salsa and guacamole to go with it, but personally I think with the richness of the fried batter the avocado was too much.

Rating: 4
Delicious. Original recipe so so. But if you incorporate all the comments, awesome. Definetly dip the pieces in panko after the batter. And, absolutely no need to cook the fish twice.

This was great! I followed Alamogordo's suggestion for less beer, but used a "healthier" oil and, most importantly, rolled the battered fish in Panko flakes. No need for double-frying and result was crisy, non-greasy and great. Also used the suggested Rubio sauce with soft white corn shells and Chipotle salsa. Fabulous.

I made this a few weeks ago, and my boyfriend has not stopped talking about it since...to anyone who will listen... so I guess it's time to make it again! I agree with him though, they are excellent, and so easy. I wasn't religious about the batter and used and IPA and probably added more salt, but it had a great flavor. The Rubio's sauce (recommended by the cook from Morgan Hill) is a great addition!

yum - got raves, and the sauce recommended by others was the key. I have enough left over that I'm going to save it for some crab cakes later in the week. Not sure the 2nd frying was necessary.

The Rubio's sauce totally makes this dish. Based on a recipe I found, I used 1/2 c. plain yogurt, 1/2 c mayonnaise, 1/2 t. cumin, 1/2 t. dill, .25 t. cayenne, juice of 1 lime and salt to taste. I tried frying the fish in a deep fryer and they all stuck to the basket for some reason. So, they were a mess when they came out - not pretty but still delicious. Deep frying a second time was not an option for me.

A summer staple (even though it is fried). We make it with Talipia instead of cod. MUST make with Rubios sauce as suggested below as it makes them SO much tastier -thank you for that addition.

Fantastic! So so easy, and so so delicious. I used tilapia, and skipped the second fry (once was enough to get the fish golden brown and crispy). Served with fresh tomato salsa (Gourmet, August '98), sour cream, guac, shredded lettuce & lime wedges, these were everything I hoped they'd be.

Yummy and easy to make, these are a favorite in our house. We use a frozen "white roughy" (it's really bocourti) from Tader Joe's and it works great. Tried red snapper (once) but would advise against it. You're probably okay with any cheap, white fish. And don't forget to double fry, that's the key to getting the fish dark brown and crunchy. Top with a little sour cream, red cabbage or lettuce, a dollop of guacamole, and hot sauce and you're in business.

Rating: 3
Very tasty. I omitted the refrying stage and just fried them until done in one step -- a little simpler and turned out just fine. Next time I make this I would reduce the salt a bit, as I found the fish on the salty side. This recipe is about as simple as fish tacos could get, and it's very good.

Rating: 4
outstanding! next time i, too, will not fry the fish. not that i'm so worried about the fat, but the texture didn't warrant all the work, considering the crunch from radish, cabbage, etc. and the house smelled like a diner :) one might try frying before guests arrive then holding in oven on low. i agree the rueben's is wonderful suggestion. almost like a true mexican "crema" with lime and cumin added. twangy, smooth and sour. i also served with pico de gallo and tomatillo salsa in addition to other condiments. crazy, over-the-top good! also, heating tortillas in a dry skillet works better for me (oven method seems to make them fall apart).

Rating: 4
THIS RECIPE IS EXCELLENT!! I made it tonight--halved it to serve 2 to 3. I found the batter to be very runny: next time I would use less beer. I used leftover chipotle mayonnaise from the Epicurious recipe "Corn Crab Cakes with Chipotle Mayonnaise" (found on this site) to replace either the sour cream or Rubio's sauce. Since the chipotle mayo is so hot, I substituted plain old chopped plum tomatoes for any salsa. Also used red cabbage in place of the lettuce. The big change I made to the recipe was to not fry the fish in oil, as I cannot stand oil spattering all over the kitchen (or the greasiness and calories from deep frying). I buttered a piece of foil that lined a cookie sheet and oven baked (fried) the coated fish strips at 475 degrees F. for about 9 minutes; then turned them over for about another 3 minutes. (Remember that I used 1/2 lb. of cod instead of a whole lb.) Also, nuked the tortillas (wrapped in plastic wrap) at the last minute so they were nice and hot. My husband really thought that this was delicious and can't wait for me to make it again!!! YUM, YUM.

Made this recipe, but added a white sauce ala Rubio's in San Diego: 1/2 c. plain yogurt, 1 dollop sour cream, 1 dollop mayonnaise, 1/2 t. cumin, juice of 1 lime and salt to taste. Drizzle this over the fish, along with red salsa and shredded cabbage (don't use lettuce). Adds a whole new dimension, and a much more authentic "baja style" fish taco.

This recipe takes a bit of work but is well worth it. The fish fried up super crispy and tasted great. It is vital that the oil maintain the proper temperature to get the best results. Buy a cheap thermometer if you do not have one. This would be great for a casual evening with friends. Do yourself a big favor and try this recipe.
