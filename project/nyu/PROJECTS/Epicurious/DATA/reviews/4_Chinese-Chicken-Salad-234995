Awesome salad. Tasted fantastic as is, but you could add another vegetable for color if you wanted. I can understand skipping the wontons for health reasons or just to cut down on time, but they were the best part! Very fast and fun to make. I'd do them every time.

This is a great recipe from which to build and create your own. The dressing is great. I omitted the Wontons and toasted crushed ramen noodles and added peanuts instead of almonds. The whole family loved it.

Great salad. Add mandarin oranges and make 1.5 times dressing

I make this every couple of weeks and it is a family favorite. Instead of frying wontons, I use chow mein noodles. My 11 year old son cleans the bowl.

This is a great salad for a party. When I am pressed for time, I skip the snow peas and add mandarin oranges for the kids.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. First, the assembly seems much more complicated than it needs to be. It's a salad--toss in the ingredients, add the dressing and toss would be good enough. I doubled the dressing recipe, and still had a very dry dry dry salad. I served it to my book club, and it was an embarrassment, as I have a good reputation for great food. I just made more dressing as I have 1/2 of this left over--and loaded the dressing on so I could taste it. (I did add many additional flavors both times--garlic, ginger, red pepper flakes). Next time I'll just buy a good bottle of Chinese Chicken Salad dressing from the store. This was no better.

Fantastic! I skipped the snow peas and wontons. Couldn't find the peas and I didn't want the heavy, greasy wontons. Instead of the 1/4 veg oil, I added equal parts of toasted sesame oil and chili oil. Next time, I may add a touch more heat. Really great. Try it!

This was perfect for a picnic I attended and got good reviews all around. I added shredded carrot and bell pepper and definitely will add some mandarin or pomegranate next time too. The dressing is very soy dominated but good. Next time I'll dress it up with maybe some garlic or ginger.

This is a fantastic salad. I followed the advice of other reviewers and used poached chicken breasts (no special reason -- I just had a bunch of it in the freezer) and garnished it with mandarin oranges a couple of times and pomegrante seeds on another occasion. It is absolutely spectacular. Guests just rave.

LOVE THIS! Perfect as written, got rave reviews from all who tried it. The second time I only used Napa cabbage, as we got a GIANT head in our CSA box. Still wonderful.

Fantastic dish. I added fresh apricots, but like other reviewers have said, anything juicy and tangy (tangerines, oranges) would jazz it up. A keeper!

I made this tonight but we actually didn't like the dressing - it just tasted like soy sauce. I would suggest reducing the soy sauce and adding in more vinegar and asian oil. I did make a few small changes: add mandarin oranges, shredded carrots and store bought crispy chow mein noodles, which we liked a lot. I also added fresh grated ginger and garlic to the dressing, which made it pop.

This is a great salad. A few tips. Like any good salad you have a lot of chopping to do. I would make this recipe which actually serves 4 for dinner. If there are just two of you only put the dressing on half-save the other half-add the almonds and wontons (just use store bought no need to fry up on your own) when ready to sere as well. Manderine oranges add a nice touch too.

I had some leftover roasted chicken I needed to do something with and since it had a teriyaki glaze when it was roasted, I used this. I agree with the garlic and ginger additions (as well as the red pepper flakes) Mine separated very quickly and that might have been because I plopped all the ingredients together without emulsifying the oils? Just a wonderful dressing - I moistened the shredded chicken with it about an hour prior to dinner - really made the flavors intense. Yummy!

Delicious Dressing! I used a little peanut oil in place of some of the vegetable oil for the dressing, and added red bell pepper, matchstick carrots, and fried wonton strips to the salad.

Absolutely delicious. I could eat this every week. Like the last reviewer, I too poached the chicken instead of using the rotisserie. It came out perfect. This was easily one of the best salads of any kind that I have ever had.

This is now a staple in our house, it is the best! I poach chicken breasts with some soy sauce, crushed red peppers, and sesame oil, it comes out very moist not as much waste compared to a rotisserie chicken

I have made this many times and always to rave reviews. We are veggies so I add Boca chicken patties diced. Even my 7 year old LOVES this salad!

This recipe is delicious! I made one key change, which turned out to be a real highlight. I added little pieces of mandarin orange (clementines) to the salad when I tossed it in the dressing. They were a fantastic addition, and I wouldn't make this salad without them--or at least some fresh fruit substitute (maybe apples, pears, or cherries). I also added a little fresh garlic and ginger to the dressing, which freshened it up and turned out great.

Very good, and very easy for a weeknight meal. I followed the proportions in recipe, and found that the dressing was scant.... would probably double dressing recipe in future (or perhaps use 1 1/2 recipes....) Otherwise, excellent!

We love this salad as a relatively quick, delcious one dish meal. We are veggies so use veggie chicken patties cut into chunks for the meat part and canned chowmein noodles to make it even faster. Even my 7 year old loves this one.

I only made the dressing part and made several suggested changes, including using rice vinegar, adding garlic and ginger, and using half peanut oil and half canola oil. The result was a delicious dressing that was far better than anything I've ever found in a store. I was sure to add cilantro to my salad of romaine, cabbage and cucumbers, and I do believe that cilantro added that final wow factor. Hurray, finally a great recipe for Chinese salad dressing! Thanks Epicurious, and thanks to other reviewers for the great revisions.

Loved this recipe! You don't need the salt in the dressing - the soy sauce is plenty. To the dressing I added garlic, ginger and orange juice concentrate. For the salad I nixed the cilantro and used the preshredded Coleslaw mixed w/ carrots, added Radicchio and mandarin orange slices. I used store-bought wontons, and put rice noodles on top. It was fantastic! Vegetarians: use any Faux "chicken" meat - Quorn brand works particularly well on the grill. (Not Vegan)

I cheat and use those crispy fried noodles you find in the grocery Asian aisle. Microwaved for a minute, they taste almost fresh...the nutty, toasty flavor is great in this crunchy and flavorful salad.

Great salad for a hot summer night. I added mandarin orange slices and left out the snow peas. Next time I'll add the suggested chili oil, which sounds great. I will definitely make this again. My family loved it.

This was amazing, I tripled the recipe to make for a shower. I used store bought roasted chicken and after taking the meat off the bones, cooked it in a combination of chicken broth and soy ginger broth to "defat" the often greasy but moist chicken. I also substituted mango-chili vinegar and rice vinegar for the distilled.

The first time I made this for my husband he absolutely loved it. Since then I try and make it at least once a month, and since we're in the swealtering summer now, this salad is nice and refreshing. This is an excellent salad.

Ive made this several times now. The last with some modifications was the best. I baked the wonton wrappers and changed the dressing. Added rice vinegar for the lemon juice and white vinegar, peanut oil for the canola oil, sweet chili sauce for the sugar and then i added minced ginger, garlic and chili pepper flakes. I put it in the food processor and it had a great texture and flavor. So much better than the dressing on this site. The salad however is wonderful-I follow that part of the recipe exactly.

This salad is so good! To prepare this quicker I bought Soy Vey Chinese Chicken Salad Dressing at the grocery store--it tastes just like the homemade version in the recipe, and saves tons of time.

I didn't have a lot of the ingredients like the almonds, cilantro and snow peas; we also used what "greens" we had on hand - and we still enjoyed this salad! I added mandarin orange slices for a bit of color and zing. Yum!

Served this for an Asian inspired buffet lunch and it was a hit! I didn't use any sugar in the dressing, and left out the romaine lettuce, as the chinese cabbage seemed to be enough. It would be delicious as a main course salad for a summer lunch.

This is delicious just like all versions of this salad are. I found the dressing to be a bit heavy. Next time we'll dress it with about 2/3 rds as much.

My wontons burned a bit...might just buy ready made ones. Otherwise this was a great meal..especially for a summer night when you don't want to cook. I used left over baby peas too....instead of the pea pods. More kid friendly.

I added Thai sweet chili dipping sauce to the dressing to give it some zing. Pretty good salad. Skipped the fried wontons so that it would be healthy.

The basics of this recipe were good, but the vinagrette left much to be desired. If I made the salad again I'd probably add something sweet to it (like mango slices) and something spicy to the dressing like green chilis or some grated ginger.
