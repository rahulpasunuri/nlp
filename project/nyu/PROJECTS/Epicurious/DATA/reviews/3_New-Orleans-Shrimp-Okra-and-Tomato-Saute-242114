After following the recommendations made by others, my husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I used a couple of cups of diced roma tomatoes in place of the cherry tomatoes, and I added about 1/2 cup of chicken broth at the very end. I also threw in a sauteed shallot. I served it with Zatarain's dirty rice (didn't add the meat but otherwise followed directions on box), a salad with corn, and extra tomatoes & bacon from the recipe, and crusty garlic bread. It was an excellent dinner, and I will definitely make it again!

This is a good recipe for this dish. Lil hint is to saute the okra in a touch of oil and 2 tbsp vinegar till soft before adding . the vinegar cuts the slime by over half.

This was delish! Easy, one pot recipe with excellent flavor. It was my first experience with okra and I loved it. I served over quinoa, used fresh okra and left out the bacon. I didn't have any allspice so I subbed chinese five spice.

I've made a lot of okra and tomato dishes, but this one has been my favorite by far. I love a good roux style dish, and I will definitely be adding this one to my favorites and making it again.

This is not a stellar dish. The flavors are muddy and confused, and the flavor of the shrimp, too pricey to waste in a dish like this, are totally lost. I love gumbo, and have made it many, many times, and I love shrimp, but this dish does a favor to neither. Not terrible, just not good.

I love this recipe. If you aren't used to eating okra you might not like the consistency, hence the bad reviews, but this recipe is one of my go-to's for something quick and tasty

This was by far one of the worst recipes I have ever made, which was such a dissapointment considering all the great recipes I've found and tried on epicurious. All the other reviewers are on point. The sauce is very slimy and gooey and overall didn't taste good at all. I didn't even finish my plate and I threw the rest of the recipe out. It was such a waste of perfectly fine (before they went into the dish) shrimp. I'm removing this receipe from my saved recipes stat. I would not recommend it.

I made the recipe as is and it was pretty bad. Sauce was too thick and gooey and the okra made it slimy. The cherry tomatoes were a little odd. I really prefer those in salads anyway. We didn't have seconds. It was edible but I won't be making it again. I have a fabulous gumbo recipe so the next day I made the gumbo stock with roux, garlic, onions, spices and tomatoes and threw the leftovers in there. Much better. However, this recipe is going in the trash!

Suspecting that the okra would thicken the sauce I cut the flower back by 1 tablespoon. I too added onions and garlic but also added cayenne pepper. Overall this has a good flavor for a meal that's ready in only 30 minutes.

Something was missing. Just kind of blah. If it hadn't've been for the Zatarain's Dirty Rice mix we threw in at the last minute, the dish would have been tossed.

I love okra and all things gumbo-esque but something was missing here. Just kind of blah. If it hadn't've been for the Zatarain's Dirty Rice mix we threw in at the last minute, the dish would have been tossed.

Added onion and garlic before adding the okra and tomatoes. Used the clam juice plus 6 oz. of chicken broth. Next time will use chopped fresh tomatoes - the cherry tomatoes were kind of strange. Served with rice and french bread. Really good, but won't go into regular rotation at our house. We live in the New Orleans area and simply have better recipes than this one.

We loved the unique flavors of this recipe! One word of caution, it's easy to overcook the veggies! I made it with grits and LOVED it! Will be making again for sure!

Too thick for sure, cure it with a bottle of good premium beer(alcohol cooks off but leaves a great tasting sauce, then you can call this dish a true Bayou Classic just add some fresh Old Bay seasoned Mud Bugs!! Nyaaaaeeeeeee

I used fresh okra and added 1/2 cup of chicken stock as it was a bit gummy.I served it over creamy grits and it was even better left over.

I was somewhat disappointed with this recipe. I would cut down on the amount of flour as the sauce was too thick and gummy. The dish was good but didn't blow me away.

This is really good and easy. My only deviation was to add garlic (3 cloves, chopped) right before adding the okra and tomatoes. I served it on jalapeno grits and the plates were practically licked clean!

Very good, everyone enjoyed this meal except for the okra. Will be changing the ingredients up next time & experimenting. Definitely made me want to go back to NOLA!

really tasty. i could appreciate a "roux" after this. i deviated slightly in the clam juice and onion being excluded. i used onion powder and chicken broth instead. i served with cheese grits. simple to prepare and enough for 4 generous servings (or two servings of "i can't believe this is that good" and a large left over) see my pic: http://farm4.static.flickr.c om/3206/2406293529_9 65d47acc3.jpg
