I really enjoyed all of the flavors coming together in this dip, but I think that a sharp blue cheese is not the way to go. I love it on it's own, but for some reason, the bitterness that can accompany a really aged blue cheese is not appealing at all in this. Go for something that has a good flavor if you're on the edge about that or strength. I substituted about a half cup of lowfat buttermilk for the mayo and it was still rich and creamy. Next time I'll use a little more, as the consistency was still extremely thick. As previous reviewers have said, you need to caramelize the shallots for a bit longer: I did about 35 minutes. I wouldn't worry about their juices discoloring the dip at all. After they were cooked I gave them a quick chop to avoid stringiness and it all turned out amazingly!

if you love blue cheese this is the dip! Serve with any type of cracker or toasted bread. Makes alot and is very rich, so I usually cut the recipe in half.

Really good! My CSA delivered a pound of shallots, so I zeroed in on this recipe. After looking through the other reviews, I thought I'd use the whole pound and cook them VERY slowly -- for about an hour at low heat. About three cups of sliced shallots reduced to about ⅔ cup of caramelized shallots. I used 6 ounces of Castello Danish Blue, which is on the mild side. I used the mayonnaise and sour cream as stated -- ¾ cup of each -- except that I used fat-free sour cream instead of regular. (Honestly, mayo plus sour cream plus blue cheese? They should rename this "Death Wish Dip.") I chopped the shallots after cooking, and I ran everything but the shallots in the food processor until smooth. I served the dip with plain pita chips and "everything" bagel chips. The guests were pleased!

Feel free to substitute thinly sliced sweet onion for the shallots but do caramelize them slowly over low heat. I added a couple of drops of sriacha sauce to the finished dip for just a little extra bite. As far as whether this is the best dip ever - I didn't have to decide, everyone who tries this answers with a definite "YES!!"

This is AMAZING. The carmelized shallots are the star of this dish as far as I'm concerned. I cooked them very slowly for a full 30 minutes. So. Good.

Rating: 4
Not a huge fan of blue cheese, so I bought the mildest I could find and then made the recipe using half the blue cheese and twice the shallots. It was loved by all. I think I'd cut back slightly on the shallots next time, though (maybe going with half the blue cheese again and 1.5 times the shallots....).

Rating: 0
This is a wonderful dip. Definitely a go-to recipe for a party. I carmelize the shallots REALLY slowly over low heat and add a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar at the end. It gives a nice tang. And I usually use a little less blue cheese--really fresh blue cheese. So easy. So good.

Rating: 2
This was good, not great, although it may have been partially my fault for using less-than-stellar blue cheese. I had a chunk of Bel Gioioso blue from Costco leftover and made this dip to use it up. It was fine, just not spectacular. If I make it again, I will double or maybe triple the shallots because they got lost in all the cheese, IMO. Also, I felt like it needed something to perk it up and added a little chopped thyme, but that wasn't sufficient - I might add a bit of balsamic vinegar or some other acid next time for some brightness.

Rating: 4
this is HARDCORE. super thick, hearty & if you use really special stinky bleu cheese, beyond flavor. the longer it sits in the fridge the more likely you need to cut it with more sour cream. you can stand a fork in it because it's mega-thick. i used some leeks in addition to the shallots. take your time carmelizing them & be sure to use plenty of oil which helps them brown. i drained the oil through a mesh when i was finished. i probably used about 1/4 cup of oil which is why i think i was successful with the browning technique more than others who reviewed this. super easy to make.

This is my go to dip, whenever I make this I get nothing but compliments and requests for the recipe. It will take longer to caramelize the shallots just be patient and attentive.

5 forks! Definitely crack dip! This is soooo good! I use Rosenborg danish blue from Publix gourmet cheese section. I make the recipe as written but I think onion would work just as well. I like the "hairy" texture of the shallots.

wow. I knew in advance that this would be good after reading all the reviews, but it truly was exceptional! Brought it to a BBQ last weekend and it was gobbled up in no time. Be careful cooking the shallots, Mine started to burn a little after only 10 minutes so 20 minutes is much too long I think.

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe for blue cheese lovers. The better the blue cheese, the better this is. I have used Rogue Creamery Smoky Blue, Rogue Creamery Oregonzola, Rogue Creamery Crater Lake Blue and various supermarket brands. Of course the Rogue Creamery brands are beyond belief good. Careful on the supermarket brands as you still need to spend a bit of cash and get a decent brand. I make this all the time and when I was in the catering business, it was one of my most requested items. I don't use shallots but rather small dice sweet onion varieties with much success.

Loved this. I don't really compare this to basic onion dips, the blue cheese makes this all together different in my opinion. Very tasty and a great option for both veges and chips alike.

omg! so good. It was the perfect dip as the numerous reviews have suggested. I found the balance between the shallots and blue cheese really quite lovely. But it took nearly 45-60 minutes for my shallots to hit that deep dark golden brown- maybe my heat was too low --but it was worth it.

I made this for a Super Bowl party and we all named it Crack Dip. Unbelievably easy. I used crumbled gorgonzola that I had in the house. Served it with some nice thick chips. It's a great dip to bring to someone's house because you don't need their oven and it holds up for hours. Totally delicious.

I reduced the mayo amount and found it was rather thick. I also set the caramelized onions (a mix of red and shallots) on a paper towel for a few mins to absorb any oil that might affect the color of the dip. I let it sit overnight and it was delicious! Definitely for blue cheese lovers!

Was a huge hit with recent guests. Not being a huge blue cheese fan, I increased the amount of onions to offset the cheese. The dip definately needs at least 2 hours in the fridge for the onion flavor to come out. Very yummy with crackers, chips and all types of veggies!

This is the best dip! I will put the sour cream, mayo and blue cheese mixture into a food processor next time. I couldn't get my cheese to mash well otherwise. I like blue cheese, but I didn't care for the chunks of cheese. It would be better if it were smoother. My husband and I actually spread some of the left over dip on our steak sandwiches the next day and that was great too!

This was delicious. I made it with exactly the ingredients listed, doubling the recipe for two parties. I made the following change in assembly order (because I forgot blue cheese at the store like a dummy!) I caramelized the shallots (IMO it always takes much longer than any recipe is willing to admit to properly caramelize shallots and onions), cooled them, then stirred them into the s.cream/mayo combo (then my very sweet husband arrived home after having gone back to the store to get my b.c.) I crumbled and chopped the blue cheese pretty finely, then mashed half of it into the mayo/s.cream/shallot blend, then folded the rest of the cheese in. I didnt add any salt or pepper, since I felt that the flavors were intense enough without. I tasted it right away, then each day for three days. It was delicious from the first, so I will be happy to make and serve it the same day, and it kept good for at least four days after it was made (I didnt keep tasting it, but I suspect it will keep good for a while, especially if kept very cold).

Had just the right amount of blue cheese. Very simple to make, and was better the next day so can easily be made in advance.

This was incredible - would taste good on a piece of shoe leather. Just made it for tomorrow's superbowl, used sweet yellow onions instead of shallots since I had them on hand. AMAZING. Followed other suggestions and pureed onions after caramelizing, then put stirred in remaining ingredients. Recommend doubling the recipe or there won't be any left for the party!

I love carmelized shallots, so I had high hopes for this dip. I was really bummed out, though as it did not blow me away as expected. The blue cheese was way too overpowering, and I could barely taste the shallots. If I make it again, I would almost double the shallots and use less blue cheese (I used Maytag blue.)

I saw this recipe and had a moment of conflict. The blue cheese love in me was overjoyed, the health nut in my who is trying to get my cholesterol down was mortified.

It received very high marks from a blue cheese loving crowd. Oh and it didnt turn at all grey. The Maytag I used was fresh and while very flavorful not very blue.

Hmm...not quite sure what the fuss is all about, even though I prepared the recipe as stated for the most part. I didn't have shallots so just carmelized vidala onions which I minced based on other reviewers suggestions. Also based on other suggestions, I processed the mayo, sour cream and blue cheese(used Point Reyes blue cheese) in the processor, added the onion and let it sit overnight in the refrigerator -- I added a bit more smaller chunks of blue cheese before serving with kettle potato chips. The flavor was just okay (I didn't have the problem with color as one reviewer had), but the main thing that turned me off was the consistency of the dip. It wasn't thick like I thought it would be -- maybe it was because I used low-fat sour cream and processed it rather than just mixing by hand, but between the lack of flavor and the consistency, I was not impressed. I might try again, mixing everything by hand instead of using the food processor and using full fat sour cream, but I think there are probably better dip recipes on this wonderful site that I'll try instead.

Celery stuffed with a blue cheese mixture is a staple at our holiday gatherings, so I just had to try this one. I used a creamy blue and had no issues with color and followed the advice to process the shallots so it was a perfect texture. It just seems to be missing something, I'm not sure what, that would give it a four fork rating. I splashed a bit of worchestershire sauce in it, and also some fresh rosemary. Perhaps I will get back to this if I find the magic... I do think that most would enjoy it.

Rating: 3
Easy, like a dip recipe should be, and worth twice the work. I followed previous advice and chopped the shallot (thanks!) otherwise followed the recipe. Out of several dips at a party this was one of the empty bowls. It was good with kettle chips, carrots, cucumber, red bell pepper, pretty much any dipper went well. I would definitely make again.

This was a great, easy dip. I doubled the recipe thinking that I wouldn't have enough for a crowd of 18 but it was so rich that people were taking nibbles at a time. I served it with carrots, apple slices (rubbed with lemon to stop the oxidation), cherry tomatoes and grilled bread rounds. To those who found it grayish in color, be careful when selecting your blue cheese. Find one with less veining and don't smash the heck out of it. I used buttermilk blue and it was delish!

made this for a party recently and followed the prevailing advice from the reviews: make it the day ahead. well, i thought it was delicious the day i made it. the day after, all of the lovely caramel colour from the shallots had leached into the sour cream/mayo and turned it a uniform brown. not as pretty, and i thought it was not as tasty as the day before. also, the textural interest of the crispy shallot pieces was lost. so, i will make this again (it was devoured at the party, esp. by the men) but i will make it the same day it is to be served. incidentally, i made it with home-made olive oil mayo and a piece of french roquefort - exactly what i will use next time. and yes, i diced the shallots finely. enjoy!

OMG - how yummy! Was part of a holiday buffet, after tasting I wish I didn't have to share it with the guests.

I was a little worried, because of how easy this dip sounded, that it was going to be like that Knorr spinach dip a lot of people on this site raved about, but which tasted to me like, well, a package of Knorr vegatable soup. This dip, on the other hand, is great. Really easy and delicious. The sweetness of the carmelized shallots melds quite well with the tanginess of the blue cheese. I used crumbled gorzonzola, which was so easy. I also followed other readers' suggestions and chopped the shallots in my food processor before carmelizing. One thing that is important is to take the time to carmelize the shallots slowly, on a low, low flame so they don't burn and get as sweet as possible. I just made it now for Thanksgiving, so I will be serving it in 3 days. I am sure the flavors will gel together nicely as other readers noted, and it sure tastes good now!

This is divine and so easy. First time I made as is, in food processor, which chops the onions nicely. Second time I replaced One third of mayo and sour cream with pureed cottage cheese to lighten up the fat content and could tell no difference in taste. I think you could replace at least half and still be great. This is spectacular on a grilled hamburger or steak!

I couldn't decide what to use for dipping. I tried apple and it was good, and I tried some garlic toast, but the garlic was a bit strong. I put all three together and it was awesome, plus made a nice presentation - about 1 1/2 tsp. dip on each toast round, topped with one slice of apple. Everyone raved!

My new favorite dip. This is easy, tasty, and gets eaten up every time I make it. I would definitely chop the shallots. Also, make sure the blue cheese is well mashed into the dip, and not chunky, for the best flavor. I do this by mashing it with a rubber spatula. Do not substitute lite sour cream or mayonnaise. I tried once, and the dip was watery. Definitely make this one or two days ahead for the best results.

Yummy! I wish, though, that I had followed another's advice and chopped the shallot -- slicing them leaves funky caramelized "strings" in the dip -- not so pretty dangling off a chip!

I wouldn't make this again as is. We had a hard time getting past the grayish color. I'd recommend 2 things: adding colorful things to the dip (red pepper, parsley, etc.) and make it 2 days ahead of serving otherwise the shallots won't merge with the dip.

Anyone would claims that Marie's blue cheese dressing is better than this dip must like Kraft Macaroni & Cheese as well. The bottom line is that this dip needs time to meld together and its ultimate flavor comes from the quality and strength of the blue cheese as well as the freshness of the onions/shallots used. If you don't like blue cheese...don't make it. I have made this over a dozen times usyng basic Treasure Cave crumbled blue, shallots and the occassional red onion. No one that I have served it to has anything but raves for it.

I love blue cheese and thought the shallots would add a great twist. Nope. There's nothing special about this recipe. I'll stick to my old blue cheese dip - Marie's salad dressing.

Could hardly taste the blue cheese, and I used a lovely piece of imported cheese. Definitely not worth the effort.

Delicious!! My friend served this dip last night with toasted walnuts, endive and sliced pear. It was absolutely wonderful. I'm definitely adding it to my recipe box.

This is the best dip I have ever tasted, I have made it as the recipe states and I have made it using half of a red onion instead of the shallots and its wonderful, I have made in with or without adding 2 cloves of minced garlic as a reviewer had mentioned and no matter what I do it is always very tasty and always asked for by any one that has tasted it. Try it!!!

This dip is so flavorful but only if you make it 2 days before you need it. I have made for three different parties this month and has been a favorite at every event so far. I served with endive and toasted walnuts also.

I had high hopes for this recipe, afterall, it includes everything I love. The flavor didn't have that 'roll my eyes up in my head, mmmmmm, gotta have this again' flavor that I thought it would. Maybe if it was baked/broiled on Crostini. Any thoughts?

This went over so well I'll surely make it again. I served it with endive and walnuts. Absolutely delicious. It helped to make it a day in advance... also, I used a blender to mix the sour cream, mayo and blue cheese for a creamier consistency.

This dip was delicious. I let it sit in the frig until it firmed up a bit and then served it with small slices of crusty bread. Be careful when selecting the brand of blue cheese as some brands are a bit salty.

Rating: 4
This dip is fantastic. However, the mayonnaise and sour cream make it a bit heavy. I substitued non fat yogurt for 1/2 cup of mayonnaise and 1/4 cup of the sour cream. If you use a good blue cheese, there is still plenty of flavor and body. Do let the dip rest for a few hours. Thumbs up!

This dip was really tasty! I ended up substituting low fat sour cream to cut down some of the calories. Best served with crusty bread. Be sure to keep stirring it every once in a while once it's served so the oils don't separate and end up looking greasy.

Very good. I ended up doubling the recipe the second time. Serve with very thick and salty potato chips.

This was a huge hit over the weekend - doubled the ingredients - a little more on the shallot side. People raved about it. When the bread was gone - people used it as a veggie dip. Tried it with chicken wings - a real winner!

I have read most of the reviews for this recipe, and I must say, some of them are astonishing. While I am not saying that everyone should love this dip, I have to wonder what some people were thinking when they decided to MAKE it! I mean, how could you NOT know that it was going to be rich, based on the ingredients alone?? People need to think before they cook, that's for sure! This dip, in MY opinion, is absolutely wonderful! I have made it several times, have distributed the recipe to several who have asked for it, and I'll continue to make it for years to come!

Made this dip for a picnic. It was o.k. Not worth the work or time to make. I was serving it with chips but it ending up tasting better with the buffalo wings. I could not taste the onions, only the blue cheese. You have to LOVE blue cheese if you plan to make this dip.

I made this dip for a post golf-tournament party. Everyone loved it and several asked me for the recipe. I used additional blue cheese and let the dip refrigerate for a full day.

Rating: 2
I was so excited about trying this dip after reading the reviews, and was rather disappointed with the results. I increased shallots and slightly decreased the bleu cheese as suggested by others, and also used more sour cream and less mayo. It was definitely better the second day, but unworthy of a high rating, IMHO. Of course, it would have helped if the shallots hadn't crisped a bit during cooking. For that reason, I'll try it again, but with less anticipation this time!

Rating: 4
I made this for friends this weekend and everyone really enjoyed it. I modified the recipe to a cup of sour cream, 1/4 c of mayonaise and used a creamy blue cheese. The creamy blue cheese gave the dish a subtle blue cheese taste. I served it with the gourmet potato chips too and thought that was a great compliment.

It looked and smelled great, but it was so rich it made us queasy! Maybe the mayo was just too much

It was ok. not bad, but not great. It was nice that it wasn't your run-of-the-mill Marie's salad dressing dip. Slice the shallots thin but make sure they don't end up too stringy.

I thought the dip was allright but not great, I also had half of it left over after a party. Very rich but not worth it, I think the mayo drags down the flavor of the blue cheese.

After reading all of the reviews, I did as was suggested by those who loved it and decreased the mayo a bit, used St. Agur blue cheese, and caramelized a few extra shallots. I also let it refrigerate overnight. Maybe I was expecting too much because of the hype. I REALLY wanted to love this dip, but alas... over half is still sitting in my fridge.

Back to another serious review! Excellent, loved it, it's all been said. I took the advice of other reviewers varying the quantities of the ingredients and used 2 cups of shallots, 1/2 cup LF mayo and 1 cup LF sour cream. I used Saga blue and the dip turned out fantastic. The flavors really blended and the blue cheese did not come through as a strong ingredient. In fact next time I may use a stronger blue cheese.

I made this recipe when I was hungry late at night after the grocery store was closed. I didn't have any shallots or even red onions. Neither did the local 7-11, so I used a medium size bag of Funyons instead (the size you can eat during a full hour of Jerry Springer or Oprah, not the smaller size you can wash down with a Big Gulp on the way home from getting a six pack). Since Funyons come already golden brown I didn't have to caramelize them. Just chopped them up in a food processor. Of course the 7-11 didn't have blue cheeze, so I bought Wish-Bone Creamy Blue Cheese Dressing and used a sieve to strain out the blue cheeze. Otherwise followed the recipe precisely. The Funyuns seemed to balance the blue cheeze well and added a pleasent crunchy texture. Forgot to get crackers while I was at the 7-11. Tried spreading the dip on a Nilla Wafer, but it tasted kind of gross. Ended up eating it straight out of the bowl with a spoon. It was ok, but next time I think I'll plan ahead and buy the real ingredients.

This was good made with Saga Blue, but I like it made with minced red onion, a dash of Worcestershire, a dash of Tabasco, and a pinch of granulated garlic better.

Finally an onion dip for adults. I brought this dip to a party and it went in no time. Did I really see someone licking the empty bowl out of the corner of my eye? Only one change--I'd increase the shallots by about another 1/2 cup to balance out the shallot-to-blue cheese flavors.

Rating: 3
I have never been very fond of blue cheese - but loved this dip! The only recommendation I would make is to blot as much excess oil from the shallots as you can after carmelizing. I made this the night before and found the next morning some oil had separated and needed to be drained. I will definitely make this again. And....to the cooks who complained about it being too lumpy - you just need to mash the cheese to your personal taste level!

Rating: 2
The nice contrast and subtlety of the shallots and bleu cheese was overpowered by the amound of sour cream and mayonnaise in this recipe. It ended up making heavy and uninteresting two of lightest and most interesting flavours. Save your bleu cheese for something else.

Rating: 4
I agree with the Boston cook who says this recipe depends on the quality of blue cheese. For San Francisco bay area residents, there is a brand new (in the past few months) blue cheese being sold at the Ferry plaza farmer's market (I think it's called Point Reyes blue cheese) that is insanely good and made this the most popular thing I have ever made at a dinner party. YUM!

I'm always looking for new appetizer recipes. This is one of the best I've found lately and my guests love it. Everyone wants the recipe. To me the ingredients and amounts are perfect. I use Maytag Blue Cheese. Thanks Bon Appetit!

I entertain a lot and like to try new recipes each time. However, this is one recipe that causes chaos if it's not included. This is definitely one of the few recipes that I will rate four forks. I make as is but increase the shallots to two cups, adding a tablespoon of butter to the oil. I think the key in this is the quality of the blue cheese. I am fortunate enough to have access to some great cheese shops in Boston. I would strongly recommend, if you can find it, using St. Agur (a blue cheese from France) or Cashel (from Ireland). They are both very creamy and unlike the blue cheese you can pick up at the local grocery store. It's the difference from a so-so/good recipe where the blue cheese is overwhelming to OUTSTANDING.

My whole family thought this was a real winner. I used red onion instead of shallots and used a fairly mild danish blue. The only thing I might change is to add more of the wonderful carmelized onions. Great with thick cut potatoe chips, pita chips and crostini.

I'm with you San Francisco and all the rest of our fellow cooks who have the same pet peeve as we do. Guntersville, you ruined the recipe by changing it and then you were silly enough to rate it a "1". Next time, just mention first that you are rating YOUR OWN CREATION, not the one published here. Good grief!!

Guntersville, how can you give the recipe a bad rating when you did even follow the recipe as written? No wonder no one ate it, a big bowl of sour cream and Vidalia onions sounds pretty gross to me.

Absolutely delicious and simple to make!

Rating: 1
I didn't like it and my family and guests politely tasted it then left it alone. I used all sour cream and vidalia onions. The bleu cheese (2 oz) was too strong and masked the flavor of the onions. If I do make this again, I'll take out the bleu cheese and add about twice the amount of onions.

Yummy!! I made it just as the recipe said and well it was delicious.. I served it at a tea party.. my guests raved!!Although it does call for alot of mayo... they all kept reaching for more :)

Dip was yummo but blue cheese was too overpowering & I didn't like the "chunkiness". Also, this made a ton of dip. My changes: reduce mayo & sour cream to 1/2 c. each, reduce blue cheese to 2 oz, and up the shallots to 2 c. Blend with hand mixer then add caramelized shallots which have been minced fine. Must be made 1 day prior. I served it with carrot sticks, crackers & gourmet potato chips (awesome chip dip! better than anything on the market). Husband says this is "award winning". I'll make it again using these modifications. French onion dip has never been so fancy!!!

I made this dip for the first time for a dinner party and it was fabulous! It was a real hit with the guests. I served it in a small bread boule, with Stoned Wheat Thins and veggies. Because I love shallots, I went a little over on the amount called for. The only change I will make next time is to not "doctor" it (i.e. add more blue cheese) until after it has been refrigerated for a while. The flavors do mingle well, and it does make a difference! Because I had made that mistake, I had to go through and pull out some of the clumps with a fork before serving.

The mayo can be reduced, but it was better the next day after I refrigerated it. The flavor was blended nicely.

I hate mayo so was glad to read that many of you cut back on it. I used only a few TBLS and used light sour cream for the rest and it still turned out decadently rich and delicious. I would venture to cut it out completely next time and maybe even use part plain yogurt. I wouldn't cut back on the blue cheese at all (but I can never get enough of that).

Indeed, the ultimate onion dip. Delicious!!! Followed the reviews and increased sour cream to 1 cup and decreased mayo to 1/2 cup.

My husband says this one is a "Keeper". I did as suggested, kept the mayo minimal and used mostly sour cream. I made it one day ahead-which may enhance flavors. Also, just used regular yellow onions, which will "sweeten" nicely when carmalized. So Simple! Got Raves from the crowd!

Paul, does it surprise you that a cook from Toronto (also in Canada, if you're not sure) answered the fellow Canadian's question? I really wouldn't advertise the fact that you're American-- it doesn't bode well for your country's reputation. Anyway, we are supposed to be reviewing recipes here, so I'll follow my own advice. Great dip. Yummy flavor.
