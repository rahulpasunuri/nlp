This is a great cookie to impress and become a classic! It will take you a bit to get the hang of cutting them while they are firm from the fridge so use the freezer to flash chill and it make it go faster. I've used apricot, raspberry and strawberry jams for filling and just powdered super for the sprinkle. I've made this cookies almost every Christmas for 8 years. Really good recipe.

It did take sometime to get it just write but I've been making these cookies since 2004 and they are fantastic :) My first time, they were a bit thin and would easily burn, but making them just a bit thinker helped. I make mine with just poweder suger tops and a raspberry or strawberry jam inside... they are elegant!

these are a huge hit every year in my christmas cookie boxes. i add fresh vanilla beans (about three for a double batch) and extra lemon zest. the dough is best rolled out and frozen between parchment. let sit for a minute or two when it comes out of the freezer and move quickly and you won't need a pallet knife to move them to the sheets. great when filled with lemon or lime curd.

I really liked the cookies. I've made similar ones in the past, but couldn't find the recipe and I think these cookies turned out better. I did add extra butter for a more tender result. It seems like a lot of work when you first read through the recipe, but no one has time for all the extra chilling, so treat the dough like you would any cut-out dough. I simply chilled the dough for the required two hours and then rolled and cut out the cookies. I used a flat palette knife (icing spatula) to lift cut-outs, and transfered them to trays. I baked as directed and the cookies were a huge success!

True, too much work! The flavor was nice--buttery and lemony. I found the dough too wet and had to add extra flour just to be able to work with it. For all the rolling and chilling and re-rolling and re-chilling, I expected to get alot more cookies from this recipe. I plan to try a different sugar dough recipe next year. Tasty but tedious.

I made these cookies two year ago, and thought it was an awful lot of work for the end result. I like the "look" of the cookie, but for the amount of work, I thought the taste was very mediocre. I see recent reviews have a similar viewpoint. If anyone has any tricks that make these taste better, let me know because they are really pretty for the holidays with red rasp preserves and powdered sugar, just take too long!

Flavor was great - very buttery and rich. I'm a "dough person" and usually enjoy working with advanced recipes, but this one was especially tricky. Not quite worth it in the end.

I am actually stopping in the middle of making these to advise anyone else against undertaking such a task unless you really have the time. The dough get soft and sticky if you even LOOK at it. This dough is in and out of the refrigertor every two seconds!Overall good tase but there are much easier ways to achieve the window pane look wihout all this work!

These are terrific. They turn out delicious and keep beautifully. I did not use the lemon, instead used lavender flower buds to make a different cookie. They are also great with dried rosemary for a savory cookie.

I made this last year for a cookie exchange. I used peach preserves, huckleberry jam and rasperry jam for filling. They came out great and were a hit with everyone who came to my cookie exchange. I'm making them again this year.

I made these for the holidays and they were a hit. This was a beautiful cookie and easy to make. They took the place of my linzertortes which I love to make because they are pretty but not many would eat(my family doesn't care for nuts. The lemon was so subtle,and with that icing, well, they were perfect!

These cookies are very good. The recipe makes them more difficult than they are. I chilled them for a few hours and then rolled them out on a powdered sugar covered towel. The cookies did not stick and were not tough. My family keeps going back for more of these. I am suprised because I made other favorites today.

This recipe is so good! They are really pretty for sending a gift as well. They are beautiful made with different colours of jams as well. Mix and match, and when given all the choices of decorating sugars etc. you can easily have no two alike!
