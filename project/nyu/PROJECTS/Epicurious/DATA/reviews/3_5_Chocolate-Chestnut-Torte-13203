Oddly enough I see that I added this recipe on Nov 27, 2003 and it took me five years to the day to make it. I've been dreaming about this cake and it came out even better than I'd hoped. Let me explain that I never planned to make the chocolate glaze because that sounded like overkill. I followed the recipe pretty much as written, using 2 10oz cans of Faugeron chestnut puree and used 10 oz of Scharffenberger Bittersweet choclate. It made a big, impressive torte and didn't really fall at all. When unmolded and cooled, I sifted powder sugar over the torte and decorated with 6 plain chestnuts which I'd covered in dark chocolate. My new daughter-in-law thought it was from the European bakery and her German mother raved about the taste. Must say myself it was very delicious....very moist and a nice balance between the chocolate and chestnut tastes. Very delicate crumb. really yummy with coffee. I didn't even make whipped cream, though that would be the only enhancement I'd try, for something extra. The 10 yr old girl said it was her favorite dessert that night (out of several), so that is a good stamp of approval. Highly recommened without the trouble of the glaze....

To everyone who has tried the recipe and those who haven't, such as myself. I'm a culinary student and have run across many problems before because I've changed recipes. Two of my chefs have repeatedly told me "NEVER substitute an ingredient on your first time making a recipe." Reading your messages have convinced me to try it word for word this first time and then change it up if I so choose. Happy baking!

Tasty and (as another reviewer noted) very "fudgy". My husband the chocoholic loved it, but I thought it was a little too intense. I would have liked to have been able to taste more chestnut and less chocolate. Shame on me, of course, for not thinking about what 16 oz of chocolate (10 for the cake plus 6 for the icing) really looks like. FYI -- its a *looooot* of chocolate. As far as making it went, it was relatively easy. As an aside to the canned/boiled debate, I used canned chestnuts, and even then they didn't puree entirely smooth until after the chocolate and egg yolks were added, despite the recipe's assertion that this would happen with just soft butter, chestnuts, and sugar in the Cuisinart. The boiled chestnut problem may have been a process issue and not an ingredient issue.

I haven't made this torte yet but for those who are putting down others as "snobs" for not using canned chestnuts, please realize that not everyone has the oportunity (or desire) to buy canned chestnuts. Here in Asturias, we are fortunate to be able to gather chestnuts from the local chestnut trees in the fall. Having fresh chestnuts and not being able to buy canned ones, one has to look for other solutions. Our solution (for this recipe) would be to use canned (those who can) or boiled chestnuts cooked like boiled potatoes until tender.

This was an excellent dessert and pretty easy. I thought the chocolate overwhelmed the chestnuts, though, and I couldn't really taste them. But it was very moist and fudgy.

This is an excellent recipe, let no one's comments deter you. There is a HUGE difference in the way canned chestnuts behave versus fresh-roasted or boiled. The review prior to this one is absolutely correct, with explanation: there is more moisture in the canned chestnuts and will turn more easily into a puree when processing with the butter and rum. Bottom line? Don't be a food snob and try to do everything from scratch--sometimes that just doesn't work.

To the cook who had bad results using fresh chestnuts--it would definitely make a huge difference in this torte because the texture of the canned chestnuts is more like that of a paste and can be emulsified in a way that fresh ones cannot. Great recipe; fabulous with marrons glaces from: Joie de Vivre in Riverside California.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving, as one of several desserts. Boy, was I glad I had backups! I'm an very experienced baker and the designated dessert maker for all holidays and I know I followed the instructions to the letter, except for substituting fresh roasted chestnuts for the canned ones. While the torte looked gorgeous, the taste and texture were just awful. It was dense, dry and crumbly and considering all the good stuff in it, it didn't have much flavor. After reading all the great reviews, I was expecting something wonderful but was very disapointed. No one at the dinner table could eat more than one bite. Does anyone out there know if using fresh chestnuts versus canned would make that much of a difference?

wow! this torte was great-not that hard either. i couldn't find the marron glaces so i just simply left them out & used light rum insted of dark rum. it was very dense and wow great!

This has become my signature cake. I am always asked for the recipe. If I cant get the marron glaces, I will serve a slice on pureed raspberries and top with whipped cream.
