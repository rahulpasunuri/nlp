These tasted excellent, were easy and quick to prepare, and went well with the Celery Bisque (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/231069). We ate an entire batch between three of us and wished that we had bought another baguette to make more.

These were quick and easy to prepare. The sour cream neatly balanced the flavor of the cheese, so it wasn't overpowering. Even friends that don't like blue cheese liked these!
