Very good and versatile recipe. I followed advice from previous reviewers - heavy on the veggies, added fennel and red pepper shakes, sauteed 30 min, used canned petite diced tomatoes. Added potaoes, extra wine and water, 2-1/2 lbs TJs frozed fish (tialpia, hake, cod. Then, threw in a big pinch of saffron, some sliced green olives and capers. Enjoying leftovers for lunch. Yum.

So easy and delicious, this is a great base recipe, as you can tell reading how everyone played around with it and loved it. I used bighead carp the first time I made this, and used a stock I had made from the carp's head & bones in place of water. I used cilantro because it's what I had on hand. Made it again tonight again with the carp stock, but used a mix of mullet, flounder, and spanish mackerel. I used flat parsley, which didn't seem to make a difference compared to cilantro. I find the flavor is deeper if you saute the onions, garlic, and celery low and slow for about 30 minutes instead of 8, and also brighter using canned diced tomatoes instead of crushed. I also simmered for maybe 10 minutes to thicken before I added the fish.

It doesn't get much easier. I used a nice fish stock in place of the water, More Than Gourmet, Glace de Fruits de Mer, and catfish and hake in equal parts...YUMMY!

Thanks, everyone, for suggestions on how to make this better. This is what I did: doubled onion, celery and parsley. Used 2 cups white wine, 2 cups water and 1 cup clam juice. Used 4 cups fresh, seeded tomatoes, chopped. Added teaspoon of sugar, a bay leaf and bit of rosemary and ground red chili (hey, this is New Mexico). Used catfish and snapper. Comes together easily and relatively quickly. The flavor wasn't very deep or complex, at least the first night, but I'm not sure what it needs. Served with parmesan black pepper biscotti from this site, which happens to be terrific.

Whoops...I thought of any other changes that I did and there was one major one...I added a bottle of clam juice to it and a small amount of chicken stock.

OMG this is THE BEST fish soup I've ever had and it's SO easy! My husband is gaga over it. The only thing extra I did is put in home ground hot pepper to kick it up a notch. It says 6 servings...not really. Maybe 4 for hungry people, esp. the guys. My guy wants it on the rotation, and it's so inexpensive and easy, I'm happy to oblige.

The weather was cold and I was hungary for a quick Fish Stew. This one is amazingly simple to prepare and you can make it richer by: adding home-frozen tomatoes-chunked Substitute 1 Cup of Seafood Stock in place of 1 Cup of Water. I also used 1 T of Seafood Base. That added a nice richness and not too overpowering. For the Fish, I used HAKE. Very nice, and I added a handful of Baby Scallops to "really" make this a Bouillabaisse. Paired with a nice South African Red...a real keeper.

Okay. So after letting the soup sit in the fridge overnight i decided to try and make this edible since i had so much of it left. I added about 1/2 cup of heavy cream and about a tablespoon or two of sriracha and it was WAY better! I think letting it sit overnight allowed the flavors to develop and the cream mellowed it out. I may make this again, but as it is so altered from the original recipe i'm still sticking with 1 fork. Hope this helps someone:)

The description says this is like bouillabaisse. Not so much. Next time i want bouillabaisse i will find a bouillabaise recipe to make. I think the main problem with this recipe is the canned tomatoes. The tinny taste combined with the fish turned my stomach. I added sugar, chicken stock, thyme...nothing would remove the tinny taste. I really wanted to like this:(

Have made this twice now, with excellent results. We add a one cut-up, steamed red potato, and some fennel. Then a handful of shrimpa the end. Don't cut back on the olive oil - it's really good in this soup. This will be made at our home for many years to come.

I added an extra half cup of wine, and cup of water with some chicken buillon to this recipe. It was too tomatoey otherwise. It's great with trout.

I generally shy away from fish soups. They are generally too fishy or expensive for me, but I decided to try this one and Oh my, I'm glad I did. The basic recipe is good, if a little too bland for my family's tastes. However, I added my own twist to it and the results were magic! I increased the veggies to 1 onion, 11/2 cup celery,1 cup baby spinach. I used chicken stock plus an extra 1/2 cup H2O. I decreased oil to 1/4 cup added 1 Tbs. fish sauce and 1 Tbs. lemon juice. Because we like to spice things up a bit, I also added 1/4 t. smoked paprika and 1/2 t. dried pepper flakes. It was a HUGE hit and will be a keeper for sure! I used true cod because that's what I had on hand. One thing, even with the increases in ingredients, this would not even come close to feeding 6 hungry people, so make more for a larger crew if you have heavy eaters!

Really easy and delicious. I followed the recipe almost exactly, but used diced tomatoes I had in the pantry and went heavy on the onion, celery, and garlic. I used Trader Joe's Wild Alaskan Cod pieces (only 1.5 pounds), and skipped the toasts to keep it low carb. I can't believe this is supposed to feed 6- my husband and I ate almost all of it!

Despite the reviews, I had no idea it was going to be so tasty. Substituted white wine vinegar and chicken broth for wine (wasn't able to make it to the store in time), cilantro for parsley (parsley bores me), and added potatoes, loads of celery and mushrooms. Added crushed chili flakes at the beginning as well and upped the garlic. It was perfect and hearty. I just wish I had room for more. My belly is very happy.

This was easy and delicious. I used halibut and jumbo peeled deveined shrimp with tails attached. The shrimp came out tender and the halibut was tasty. I will make this again for sure. I thought it would be oily, but when it was done, it really wasn't oily at all. I'm excited to have this in my fridge to eat over the next few days. :)

This was absolutely delicious and elegant. I used fresh basil instead of parsley because that's what I had plus I added some finely chopped carrots and sauteed them with the other veggies. It's light enough as the soup course before a multi course meal yet nutritious enough as main course lunch.

I have made many versions of cioppino and bouillabaisse with much more expensive seafood. This version is wonderful with fresh catfish, simple and loaded with flavor. I used only 3 tbs olive oil, substituted 2 cups vegetable broth for the water and added 1 tsp crushed red pepper flakes and 1/2 tsp cayenne.

I added twice as much celery, onions and parsley. In addition I also added rosemary, a couple bay leaves and a little chili pepper. I also added 2 cups of wine and 1 cup of veggie broth with a little sugar. Oh, and I added two kinds of fish; cod and tilapia. It was delicious.

This recipe is very easy and fun to make. My friends said it was so good that they would order this dish in a restaurant. I used half the oil called for, then added hot chili sauce and Cayenne pepper to the Tilapia stock. I recommend this recipe for anyone who needs to put together a great meal quickly.

Probably the best tasting, easiest, fastest, good for you meal anyone can prepare. I used true cod, and I believe it could have stood up to adding kale for a good health punch. But I just added a liberal helping of good ole Parmesan cheese, couple with the awesome baquettes - no one could ask for more. I give this recipe to my friends.

Delicious and special as is (using a bit of sugar and a good shake of crushed red peppers, as recommended by others). This soup can be made more substantial by adding a chopped fennel with the onions and celery, and then adding 4 finely chopped peeled red potatoes with the wine. I did add another cup of wine and another cup of water to account for the extra ingredients.

This was a very good recipe, but it definitely needed a lot of extra seasoning (s&p plus a healthy dash of cayenne pepper and a pinch of sugar, as recommended by other reviewers). We also used about half the oil. It did turn out well in the end though, Yum!

Made this a few weeks ago and really enjoyed it! A great way to use frozen fish fillets. I tossed in a few extra spices and quite a bit of pepper; also used very little oil. The recipe made a lot, but froze well!

It smelled delicious while I was cooking it, but the finished soup was much too oily. If I make it again, I will cut the olive oil by half.

Good but not the best. Substitute the two cups of water with fish stock to up the flavor (cover bones and head of one fish, 1 rib celery, 1 carrot, splash of white wine, several whole peppercorns, sprig of thyme and 1/2 onion with enough water to cover. Boil then strain.) Also add one hot pepper when cooking the onion etc.

Very good as is (plus some pepper and red pepper), and I can easily imagine that adding some thyme or rosemary might really knock it over the top. With a bit of frozen fish around, it would be a superb pantry soup.

This soup is simple to make and has become one of my favorites. Although really optional, spicing it up a little is a good idea. I also replace parsley by cilantro.

This is a great, simple recipe! I 1/2 the recipe because I only had a pound of tilapia. I also added some limpy zuchini, mushrooms and fingerling potatoes that were very close to ending up in the trash. It turned out sooooooo good. I also added a tablespoon of leftover pesto to add some more flavor. I will make this again. Yummy!

Wondewrfull recipe! I wanted to make something like the Ciopino in SF, This reminds me of the dishes they sell in the Bay Area. Have made this many times, and I use differant fish, any that is available and affordable. Trader Joes sells a pak of frozen fish for this type of stew. I just add additional Tilapia. Remember to add the red pepper flakes. This one is a keaper.

This is fantastic. I told my wife I was making fish soup for dinner and she said "eeeewww" but tried it and ended up BEGGING me to make it again that week. She loved it and I did too. Very easy, very quick - all in one pan and delicious! Keep an eye on the garlic and don;t let it burn. Also, use the wine you will serve to cook with it and it will be an amazing match at the table.

Delightful dish and easy! Next time, I will add red pepper flakes to the olive oil to spice it up. Also, used a combination of shell fish and fresh water fish which was nice. My husband wants cheese so he can add it afterwards (although it is herasy). A keeper!
