I used this recipe for my stuffing and paired it with the recipe for Adobo Turkey, also on this site. I simply baked it in the oven in a roasting pan at 425 for about a half hour. People went nuts over it. The blue cornbread was a nice twist--it's not quite as overly sweet as yellow corn and the chile gives it a nice balance. I've always loved oyster stuffing, but shrimp is even better. It lends both brininess and sweetness to the dish. I have never deglazed anything in my life, never mind with bourbon, but I went for it and it was delicious. I would definitely make this again.

Excellent. This is the most interesting and flavorful stuffing I've ever made. I used yellow corn meal in the Blue Corn Bread recipe on this site, and baked the stuffing in a baking dish covered with foil for a hour.

Made this last Christmas and it was truly exceptional. I usually try new recipes every holiday season, but this might be a hard stuffing to top.

Been making this stuffing for maybe 8 or 9 years now (from SP's cookbook). Family and guest love it w/ shrimp or sausage as a snack (thats how good it is w/ shrimp) and at dinner. It's as good or better making the cornbread using yellow cornmeal.

I finally nabbed my first wild turkey, so I wanted to try something different in homage of the great bearded bird. With all that exercise, turkeys are often tough, so I juiced him up by injecting a simple cajun marinade. The stuffing was creative and aromatic. I served the bird with fresh cranberry sauce, garlic "smashed" (gotta leave the skins) potatoes, and green bean casserole. The whole ensemble reminded me of a cajun Christmas dinner. Laissez bon manger!
