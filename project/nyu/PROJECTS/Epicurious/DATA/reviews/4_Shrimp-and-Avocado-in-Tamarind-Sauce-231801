Irresistible combination of flavors and textures. Used 2 tbsp tamarind concentrate, which keeps forever in the fridge--I'm never going to mess with that pulp nonsense again. Did need to add a little water to the sauce to compensate for liquid. And it absolutely needs rice to soak up the sauce; cole slaw won't cut it as a substitute. Husband and I ate 1.5 lbs shrimp on our own, though one avocado would be fine for two people.

Really interesting combination of flavors and textures! Bright, tart tamarind, crispy fried shallots, buttery avocado... yum! As a note, I had .75lb of shrimp and one avocado, and split this between two people. Unless this was accompanied by several sides, I don't see the full recipe serving 4 comfortably. The sauce quantity was great for 2. I would make this dish again.

What a refreshing and easy-to-make dinner with a unique flavor. The combination of ginger, tamarind, garlic and chilis is delish. The only thing I would do different next time is to peel the shrimp completely. I don't understand why the recipe calls for the tails to be left on in this dish. Either way, very good.

Store didn't have serrano so I substituted some chili powder and it worked well. Tamarind concentrate used and worked just as well. Really tasty and filling dish. I could also see using this in many ways including in tortillas.

Interesting. My husband thought it was too sour. I would maybe leave out the lime next time.

Great recipe, we added green beans for a veg into it. Will definately make again! Easy and quick.

This is a fool proof recipe. I love the combination of avocado, shrimp, and tamarind. I've made it several times and it is always a success. I usually do it with a few more serranos to make it more spicy. I never have enough fried shallots. Everybody loves them. One of the best recipes I've ever tried from Epicurious

This was very good - tangy from the tamarind & lime, balanced sweetness, good depth of flavor. It was perfect spice for me, but too spicy for my husband. I added snap peas and carrots to get our veggies. It might have warranted four stars, but I made another Thai dish for the same meal (from this site: Lime & coconut shrimp with red curry) that knocked my socks off. BTW, I found tamarind pods at our local Latin grocer.

Holy cow, this was delicious. We had it with a lovely Asian cole slaw (with peanut sauce and radishes, found on the Cooks Illustrated website) in lieu of the rice. My suspicion is that it was better without rice altogether. Sweet, sour, hot and salty. Exactly what you want from a southeast Asian inspired shrimp dish. Yum.

After having made this with shrimp umpteen times, I made with squid this time and it was just fab. Cooked the squid in the sauce for three minutes till white and served.

Like other reviewers, I used tamarind paste purchased from Whole Foods. A heaping teaspoon seemed the right amount. I also used peanut oil for frying the shallot rings, which added more flavor.

What a winner! It is an explosion of flavors: salty, sweet & spicy!! I just had the left over shrimp in a salad for lunch - heavenly!!

Used tamarind concentrate and tried to judge how much water to add. Also, cut down on the oil to about 1/2 the amount. Even better the next day as leftovers!!

Came out wonderfully. I too used tamarind paste (which they sell at PCC , for you Seattlites). Could use some more serranos though. Maybe 3 or 4.

This is a great receipe! A friend suggested to subsitute the tamrind for green thai paste (easier to find) and we love it. A favorite in our home!

I love this recipe. I listened to the other reviews and made more sauce since I was making this dish with brown basmati rice. Loved the freshness of the avocados- worth making again and again!

We made this with seared blue fin tuna instead of shrimp, and it was amazing. Wouldn't hurt to make a little more of the sauce, and we can never have enough avocados!

Loved this deliciously sweet and sour dish. I didn't use shallots since I didn't have any, but I did the same thing with some thinly sliced onions and garlic, and it came out great. Served it with some jasmine rice and everyone at home loved it. Enjoy!

I really enjoyed this dish. I had tamarind pods, so I just peeled the flesh from the seeds and went from there. Next time I will definitely double the sauce, as there was only enough to cover the shrimp, and the sauce was so yummy that I wanted more! Also, that many avocados wasn't quite necessary, so I think I'll stick to one. And I agree with one of the other reviewers... the shallots don't add enough that it's worth going out and buying them if I don't already have them around. I will definitely make this dish again - and soon! (Easy to make - the chopping and peeling make it a bit time consuming, but really not that bad... and totally worth it!)

This recipe is the best I've made from epicurious - easy and very sophisticated tasting! Whole Foods sells tamarind sauce, which I used instead of going to the hassle of making it - I just halved the amount since it seemed more concentrated. LOVED IT!

My guests RAVED about this dish. The most difficult part of this recipe was finding the tamarind!! But now that I have I will keep it on hand for future meals. I think next time I will try making this recipe with pieces of monk fish and scallops. Yum!!!

Awesome recipe! Making this again for the second time. Very easy to make and you can keep most of the ingredience on hand to make. Don't be afraid to crank up the spice with the chiles!

We loved this recipe and will definitely make it again! Tamarind is delicious and so much fun to cook with. I couldn't find chilis, so I added chili powder, which was fine. I also added a little more ginger than was called for. To save time, I think this would be great with cubed chicken breast as well, on a weeknight it would probably take too long to make the recipe and peel shrimp.

I love this dish. The flavors are fantastic and it is relatively easy. I am anxious to try it with noodles as one reviewer suggested.

We love this recipe....our only suggestion is not to add some/all of the seeds in from the peppers. It heated the dish up just a bit much for us. A few seeds aren't bad. Otherwise, we love it!

After making this I've become a fan of tamarind sauce and as one of the reviewers suggested, I doubled the sauce. I even looked for other tamarind recipes on this site. Next time I wont bother with the fried shallots if I don't have them in the house because I don't think it contributed that much to the dish to make a difference. I will also remove the entire shell from the shrimp as suggested by another reviewer, it just gets in the way.

Rating: 4
This recipe is delicious! Already I have made it three times in as many weeks. Plus, it is quick enough to make on a week night. It is great with the jasmine rice, but try it with Japanese udon noodles for a change. Yu-u-u-mmy.

This recipe is mediocre. It was too tart and didn't seem to have enough other flavors. It probably has potential as a starting point, but I'm not quite sure what it needs.

Very good. Aside from the chopping, nothing is difficult or time consuming. I will remove the entire shrimp shell next time. I wanted to eat all the flavors at once rather than having to remove each tail!

I thought the dish was delicious as written but it was kind of an unappealing grey brown color. Don't think I would serve it to guests.

This was a memorable meal. Spectacular combo of flavours. Would use less avocado next time (my two avocados yielded quite a bit of avocado). Was able to find fresh sweet tamarind (pods) in a box. Simply shelled pods, then boiled in water until flesh fell off the seeds, then pushed it through sieve. Ended up with about 3/4 cup of pulp. Used this in place of the 1/2 cup boiling water and 1/4 cup pulp block required in recipe. Worked well. Will definately make this again.

Yum !! Have made 2x as written, and also as a cold starter, on rocket (arugula) rather than rice. If making as a starter, save the cooking sauce and skim off extra oil -- everyone loved it !

Truly wonderful, though perhaps my avocados were larger that most, used only 1 1/2.

I made the mistake of using cheap shrimp which released a ton of water into my sauce, diluting it into tastelessness. Even with the chiles this was way too bland.

Rating: 4
Outstanding! Simple to prepare and a beautiful complex bunch of flavors. I doubled the garlic and the ginger. Used tamarind concentrate (one teaspoon) and doubled the lime juice in both uses. Served it on couscous because that was in the cupboard but quinoa or jasmine rice would be better. This is a great recipe...enjoy!

This is so wonderfully complex, with a beautiful blend of sweet/spicy, hot/cold, crunchy/soft, etc. Tamarind can be hard to find if you don't happen to live in NY, though. Since I do, I had a paste vs. block option, and was very happy with the time-saving paste.

This was very good. I went to 3 stores and called even more but they did not carry the tamarind pulp in a brick. In fact few had even heard of it. I managed to drive nearly every grocery clerk in my town nuts and finally found the tamarind in 2 stores in pod form. I figured out what the heck as I had all ingredients by then. I found the recipe for TAMARIND RECADO here and took it from there. For what its worth the seeds do not drop off the fruit as that recipe says. In any case I broke the pods boiled the fruit, squeezed out the seeds and got a good deal of the pulp, and a pretty big mess. I stayed with it and wow what flavors! I had no idea how much of the stuff I was supposed to have, but it looked like a half cup and tasted darn good when mixed with the other ingredients so I added another bit of each (except sugar) and again it worked. This was great over the jasmine rice. I ended up just eating the avocadoes, toppings and sauce and pushing the shrimp away. My only complaint is that it was too hot with 2 of the Thai chilies and I would cut down on them. I really enjoyed this otherwise and presentation was beautiful.

An absolutely gorgeous flavour - sweet, tangy - as well as easy to prepare. I completely agree with the previous reviewer - the sauce was so good that next time I will double it. Served steamed asian greens on the side rather than muddle the textures and I would recommend that rather than including them in the dish.

Rating: 3
This dish provides an interesting and delicious combination of flavors and textures. Next time I will increase the volume of sauce - it was so tasty, I wanted more. And instead of two avocados, which I thought would be too filling, I used one and then a large handful of snow peas, cooked along with the shrimp. They added a good crunch and a nice visual.

Absolutely divine. I had never worked with tamarind , but it was quite simple, as was the rest of the preparation. I didn't have the jasmine rice and went to a couple of stores that would have had it, but they were out so I substituted whole grain brown rice and it was still yummy. Am making again this weekend for a few friends.

Fantastic and unusual shrimp dish! Great blend of sweet, tart and spicy flavours and attractive colour combo. Had never made anything with tamarind before so I was a little hesistant. Wowsers, was I pleasantly surprised! It made for a very tasty sauce that paired beautifully with the shrimp and avocado. Can't say enough good things about this dish, so please give it a try.
