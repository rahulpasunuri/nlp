I have been making a lot of popsicles lately, practically obsessed with them really, and these have been by far my best effort. Everyone LOVES them. The amount of liquor is good too, since it doesn't freeze like the juice and makes the texture a little soft, which is a very nice effect. They keep very well in the freezer if I wrap them deli wrap and put them in a ziplock bag. That way I don't have to fuss with getting them out of the mold while I have guests.

These popsicles were refreshing and tremendously tasty. I am making another batch today!

The greatest! One thing: The recipe didn't include a way to remove the pops. The way I did it was to immerse the mold into an 8-quart All-Clad Dutch oven filled with water that would reach up to the top of the molds when the molds are immersed. Then, wait about 30 seconds to 1 minute until you can pull the pops out.

These were so fun and yummy! But, I have to admit, that they took longer than 24 hours to freeze. I tried to serve them at a party, and was unable to pull them out of the mold. Three weeks later, however, I tried again. Not only did they keep, but they were perfect. I have now had a request from my sister-in-law to make them every time that she comes over, and they turned a non-grapefruit lover into a fan. :-) Next time I will purchase store bought freshly squeezed grapefruit juice to save time. Yummmm....

Outstanding! A summer tradition in our house. Very sophisticated and delicious flavour, with the fun of the juice dripping down your chin. Just be careful, cause these are addictive. You'll eat one, then another, another, and pretty soon you can't drive!
