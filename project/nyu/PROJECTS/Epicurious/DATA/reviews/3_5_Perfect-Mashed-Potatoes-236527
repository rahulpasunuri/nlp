I found the potatoes to be very dry and weirdly chunky.

what makes this recipe 'perfect' is not the ingredients - it's the technique. i used to wonder why i always ended up with leaden mashed potatoes, but now after drying them out,i know why. even without sour cream, these potatoes are light and fluffy.

I have been using this recipe for years... yukon gold gives it the intense buttery flavor without the extra butter and I use half & half instead. Hand mixer makes it extra fluffy after I mash them by hand. Reheats well.

add a couple of heaping tablespoons of sour cream for really delicious potatoes

Has anyone tried making these ahead and reheating? I need to bring the sides to an upcoming dinner party and thought I'd try these.

I added sour cream, half & half (out of heavy cream) white cheddar cheese to these already sublime mashed potatoes. Some fresh chives on top - perfect. I will never cut & peel my potatoes and throw them in boiling water again. These were so good I was able to eat them cold out of the fridge the next day.

You really want perfect add a bit of horseradish - Japanese horseradish "Wasabi" works too. And I HATE horseradish - yet it works as a great 'seasoning'

I believe it is important to use a ricer for perfect consistency. Also important to melt butter and fully stir in to potatoes before adding the warmed milk. I set the prepared potatoes over a double boiler for over an hour while the rest of the meal preparations were completed, and the potatoes stayed warm and fluffy (and proved delicious!).

great taste and simple

Straightforward and delicious. I've only made mashed potatoes a few times in my life, but these were the best - so good and simple to prepare that I'll now make them part of my permanent repetoire. I followed part of the magazine's suggested "white cheddar/chipotle" variation by adding a cup of grated cheddar. Delicious!

Maybe this would have turned out better if I had a potato ricer or food mill. Using the old hand masher, I was not impressed. Potatoes turned out lumpy and it was difficult to mix in the milk/butter mixture. It's much easier to use the hand mixer...let it do the work. Plus, even though I let the potatoes cool, I still burned my fingers.

What is unique about this recipe is not the ingredients, but rather the preparation. If only I'd been "drying" my potatoes all these years. Give this a run and I promise that even your leftover mashed potatoes (if there are any)will taste as though they were just made. Great tips!
