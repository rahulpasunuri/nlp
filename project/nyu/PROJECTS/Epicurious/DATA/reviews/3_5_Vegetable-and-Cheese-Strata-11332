A great alternative and balance to the many meat and cheese stratas out there, and more elegant. I like to roast the peppers and just add them to the onions, avoiding the cook off liquid step. I've been making this recipe since 1991! Love it.

Good basic strata which can be altered to use whatever leftover veggies and cheese you happen to have around.

This is a terrific recipe and is "easy" in the sense that it is not difficult to make. However, do not be mislead into thinking that you can throw this together in a hurry; it took me a while to do all the chopping,etc., and then more time to assemble the dish. Of course, its taste and ease on the morning of presentation makes it worthwhile.

A lot of work but worth the effort. i would use fewer eggs and milk next time as mine was a little runny. Also, this served 8 huge portions so it can easily stretch to 12 servings.

I made this for a break-fast and in my delerium I mis-read the directions and missed the part where you let it sit overnight. Nevertheless, with only 4 hours of sitting, it was still pretty good. I skipped the tabasco but i think next time i won't. the bread cutting was more work than i hoped and it was a bit too rich/unhealthy for my taste, but still good.

I made this receipe for Mother's Day Brunch. It was a huge hit! I was concerned that it may be a bit bland from what others wrote, so I made some alterations. I used 6 peppers instead of 4 (red, green, yellow). I sauted the vegs on high heat for a long time..almost till they were lighly browned..I also added Mrs. Dash while they were sauting and plenty of salt to taste. I cooked the mushrooms separately because they give off to much liquid and interfer with the sauting. I added some cooked spinach well drained at the end along with the mushrooms. Be sure to taste the veg mixture to be sure it is flavorful as this is where a lot of the flavor is going to come from. Also...I made this with tortillas instead of bread. A layer of tortillas...vegs..cheese..repeat. I did make a bread version ..it was a bit too dense. Good luck!

I have made this recipe several times and each time it is a big hit. It's great to be able to assemble the dish the night before you want to serve it, leaving one less thing you have to do on the day you're entertaining. It smells absolutely wonderful, tastes delicious and looks fabulous presented in a pyrex dish inserted in a woven basket.

It was delicious. I followed the Seattle cook's recommendation and used about 1/2 t. of salt and 1/4 t. of pepper when sauteing the veggies, and about 1/2 t. salt, 1/2 t. pepper, and 1 t. of Tobasco in the egg mixture. I don't like mushrooms, so I substituted a finely diced jalapeno pepper and an orange pepper. I also threw in another 4oz of cheese(pepperjack). Lastly, I used whole milk so it wouldn't be too runny. It definitely feeds more than 8 people, though!

I made this for an office brunch last week and it disappeared! Everyone was very complimentary. Luckily, my boss set aside a piece for me so that I could try it. Although I prefer my strata a little spicier, this recipe as written is good food. I followed it exactly, but ran out of bread and so was a little short of the specified amount. Not something I want to eat every day--a dozen eggs and all--but very good for special occasions and a lovely brunch offering.

I've tried similar recipes and they all came out "okay" but this time it was perfect! I used salt, pepper, lawreys seasoned salt, a light shake or two of chili powder as well as 3-4 drops of tabasco. It wasn't spicy at all it just had really good flavor. I used frozen spinich, bottled roasted red peppers, 2 types of mushrooms and fresh grated parmesian, romano and chedder. It was a big hit and easy too!

A great recipe for brunch! I made this for a breakfast at my husband's work and was surprised at how many people asked for the recipe. My husband and I enjoyed it so much were planning on it for Mother's Day.

I made this dish for Easter brunch, and everyone loved it. In fact, there wasn't a bite left over! I used toscano bread (specifically A La Francaise toscano, for any Seattlites out there), and 5 T. of Dijon (instead of 3). The recipe is vague with regard to seasonings: I used about 1/2 t. of salt and 1/4 t. of pepper when sauteing the veggies, and about 1 1/2 t. salt, 1/2 t. pepper, and 1 t. of Tobasco in the egg mixture. I substituted a bag of baby spinach and 6 tomatoes (with seeds removed)for the peppers and 1 shallot for the cup of scallions. After sauteing the vegetables, I drained the juice before layering them in the strata. It really was delicious.

U+I made this for a brunch for 20 people. I'd doubled the amount fearing I'd not have enough and one recipe would have been plenty since I was offering several other dishes. From a double recipe I got four 8" square pans, as I said, half that would have been plenty. It is important to saute all the vegetables in my opinion to get rid of all that excess water. I sauteed the vegs the day before, and still saw a lot of liquid collected in the bottom of the bowl when I went to assemble the strata the next day. I discarded that liquid. Everything in the recipe worked out great Because I was running out of room in the pans I used 2 cups of grated Cheddar,the recommended one cup of Parmesan, and I used 3 cups of milk rather than 3 1/2 cups. I baked it the day after I assembled it. It baked up cheesy, firm, but not too firm, not dry, and not rubbery. Easy to self-serve. People raved about it, and asked for the recipe. Great brunch dish.

Tastes and smells delicious, also holds up well. I used a combo of swiss/cheddar and omitted the scallions. Sliced neatly and also froze/reheated well. I used sliced challah - wonderful.

Excellent option to the egg & sausage casserole. I baked the casserole for a Kosher brunch, and it disappeared. Used less cheese than recipe called for, since I ran out of room in a standard 9X13 pan.

Once again I made this strata for my New Year's Brunch of 23 people. I did not find this dish time consuming at all. Quite easy, and I doubled this recipe without any problems. However, I did make some changes that I feel improved the recipe. I leave out the mustard, (I also left out the tabasco sauce, but Last year I put it in and really did not notice a difference, plus I am not sure how pleasent a taste it would be in this dish)I also leave out the mushrooms only because I like to carmalize the peppers and onions for added flavor and the moisture from the mushrooms would make that difficult (I add a small pinch of sugar to help the carmalization process). However, I could have used the mushrooms and just cooked it seperatly from the peppers and onions and then layered it with them later. Used a high quality extra sharp cheddar cheese finely shredded and baked until the top was crispy and browned. Used a 1/2 pan, deep disposable steamtable pan, but feel that I would make it in 2 medium depth pans if I were to make this again. Served with a single recipe of Chive and Brie strata also found on this site, crisp bacon and Hash Browns 21 also found here. All foods hold well with sterno/racks, but everything disappeared quickly!

I thought this had good flavors but an awful, incredibly dense texture; my husband liked it; and my guests avoided it. I used a lot of Tabasco, a little more mustard, and garlic when I cooked the onions & mushrooms. I didn't bother cooking the peppers as I prefer them crisp, and used part cheddar/part swiss for the cheddar, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. I'm not sure why this came out so dense, with the little pockets of egg mixture almost curdled--possibly cooking at a lower temperature might help next time? I might try it again, possibly slicing the bread very thinly instead of using cubes. Also note that mine never puffed.

Used this recipe for a bridal shower brunch. Served 20 people although there were a lot of other dishes too. Everyone raved and 11 of the attendees requested the recipe. I have made this recipe many times and it is a hit---always.

I made this for Easter brunch and it was a big hit. I cut the recipe in half for a small gathering. A great thing to make ahead of time the night before and pop into the oven in the morning. I would definately make it again.

I guess the good thing about this dish is that it is pretty inoffensive. It is so mild that anyone from grandmothers to toddlers will eat it. It's rather boring though, which is why I won't make it again.

Great dish to make for company as it can be made the night before. Served to non egg eaters who loved it! Made only half of receipe which easily served 6. Would definitely make again!

This is a great recipe for a crowd. Plan on spending a few hours preparing the cassarole the night before. One cassarole will feed 20+. I just prepared this for a post wedding brunch for 60+. Lots of positive feedback from guests. I used freshly baked italian bread and lots of tabasco (30 shots).

I've made this for a post-10 mile-race brunch for years. People always ask for the receipe. It works well with egg substitute also. Great for a hungry crowd.

Very good. Made a huge amount. Brought it to a potluck, and everyone thought it was very good. Had three people ask for the recipe!
