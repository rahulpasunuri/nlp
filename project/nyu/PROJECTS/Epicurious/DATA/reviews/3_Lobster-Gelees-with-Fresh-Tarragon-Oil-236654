I made this last Christmas. I agree, quite labor intensive and mixed reactions to the Lobster "jello" among the adults. However, quite beautiful and most adults enjoyed the taste immensely. I also used the time saving tips of the previous reviewer.

It is true this is difficult & expensive but I saved time by having the fishmonger steam the lobster & substituting half clam juice & half white wine for the broth, adding the herbs & vegetables for 20 min. I chopped & steamed some of the fennel & mixed it w/lobster & chopped radishes to make the lobster go further. Next time I will add more vinegar to oil for a bit of "bite" but it lookd spectacular & everone(all adults) raved about it.

I served this pretty (and expensive) starter last Thanksgiving. It has become a running joke in my family as the labor intensive dish no one wanted to eat. As other reviewers mention, those who did eat it picked out the lobster meat. Better uses for lobster abound.

This recipe is a whole lot of work, real work when doubled. I have to admit that the photography in the magazine made this dish so desirable. It was beautiful! Prepared this recipe as directed for Christmas dinner appetizer for 8 foodie adults and 8 children. Based on the photo I was determined to make this dish despite disparaging references to lobster jello. Results: a few ate it all (me); many picked out the lobster leaving most of the "gelee" behind; most of the kids passed altogether. I have to say that it is not worth the effort or expense. Many better recipes to indulge your lobster cravings.
