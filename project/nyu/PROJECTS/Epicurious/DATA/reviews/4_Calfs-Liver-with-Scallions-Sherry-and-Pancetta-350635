I made this earlier in the week and my husband who typically is not a fan of liver, asked for seconds. I made several modifications, but it still turned out great. I used prosciutto that I had instead of pancheta and reduced balsamic instead of sherry. Yummy! Will definitely make again!

This was a delicious new way to eat one of our favourite meals of calf's liver. It will def be the 'go-to" recipe now. The pancetta added a unique taste and while there are 2 tbsp of butter added to it my old recipe using bacon I think was more fattening. The calf's liver (from Farm Boy here in Ottawa) was tender and so good with this sauce adding a gourmet touch to it.

Solid dish here. Better than anything I have had out in awhile. Not many are doing calf liver these days. In more perfect scoring system I would say this is a 3.5er.

Fairly easy to make and very savory. Good winter meal

If you love liver, this receipe is delicious - the pancetta is so savory along with the other ingredients - easy to make, watch the time in cooking the liver as you want it tender
