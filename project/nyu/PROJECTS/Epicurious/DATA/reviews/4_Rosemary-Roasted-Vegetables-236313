Love this, love this. Have made it to the letter and have made with rutabaga instead of parsnips. Garlic can be peeled or unpeeled. Both results good. Pairs perfectly with a simple lamb chop recipe.

My oven had a massive malfunction just as I was prepared to put the dish in. I improvised and cooked the recipe in a dutch oven on the stove top and it turned out delicious! I'm sure the vegetables weren't cooked quite as evenly, but it as yummy nonetheless.

Great flavors! You can substitute a variety of vegetables too. We've tried zucchini, garnet yams, and butternut squash.

I love this recipe as does my family. I remove the skin from the garlic cloves when the dish is done roasting.

My guests seemed to like this better than I did.Nice flavors. It was pleasant but I don't think I would make it again

Excellent and easy to make. I made this for our Thanksgiving dinner this year with much success. I made the first part of the recipe the night before and then cover it and put it in the fridge. While the turkey was resting, I tossed in the garlic and rosemary and finished the cooking (about 35 minutes - because the veggies were cold). Big hit!

This was simply fantastic. I made is exactly as prescribed, although next time I would like to throw in a quartered anise bulb along with it. I might also use a little rosemary and chop it up to release more flavor. The wonderful flavors of the vegetables speak for themselves in this dish.

I make basically the same recipe, but I roast the veg for almost 3 hrs at around 325, along with the turkey. they turn out soooo sweet and carmalized, and there's no fiddling with the oven temp
