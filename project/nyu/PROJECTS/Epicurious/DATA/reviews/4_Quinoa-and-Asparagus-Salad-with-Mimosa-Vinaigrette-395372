Overall a good recipe, however, even though I have a good, sharp peeler, peeling the asparagus was a waste of time! I eventually gave up and cut the asparagus in small pieces and blanched them. I agree with other reviewers that the instructions are too wordy and that finely chopping the egg would have been much easier and just as effective as grating a hard boiled egg. That said, the recipe was a success and I would make it again with the preparation modifications.

Delicious recipe, BUT - the title is misleading. There is no "mimosa vinaigrette" involved. It is a lemon-olive oil dressing instead, probably modified by the author for Passover. It was a hit at my seder as well, very fresh and flavorful. But peeling the stalks took way, way too long. I will try it with a julienner next time, and the idea posted by the other reviewer is good too. I also agree that the recipe is way too wordy. I found it hard to follow in the pre-Passover prep craziness.

Yeah, it was a hit. Everyone at the seder loved it. These directions are ridiculously verbose. Example, the whole first paragraph is just saying "hard boil and egg and chop it up in little pieces". The second paragraph should read "prepare quinoa as directed on package, then let cool". Anyway, it was good and pretty simple. The first reviewer mentioned the asparagus peeling was time consuming. I suggest getting thick stalks, putting them, as many wide as the peeler will reach in a swipe, onto a flat surface and peel them as they're laying flat. Holding them above the bowl is much less productive. Note: The OU (Orthodox Union) considers quinoa kiniyot, or *not* kosher for Passover. Many others certify it as kosher.

I made this over the weekend for a large group to accompany grilled teriyaki chicken and shrimp. While everything in the meal turned out well, people raved about this salad and several requested the recipe. Worth noting is that it took longer than suggested, simply due to the difficulty of shaving strips of asparagus. A sharp vegetable peeler is a MUST. Also, be sure not to omit the fresh herbs - they really add a lot of interest to the salad, especially the mint. This was a real crowd-pleaser!
