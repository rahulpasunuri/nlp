Disappointed. Seared the meat, etc. but found the final result rather bland. There are better recipes.

Seared the meat, doubled the garlic, onions, and mushrooms, and added about 2 tbsps of tomato paste. Used diced San Marzanos. You will most definitely need to spoon off a considerable amount of fat. Served this with mashed rutabaga and green beans. Wonderful.

Rating: 4
this is excellent. But...you should definitely sear the meat for a minute on all sides before putting in crock pot. It's a must for crock pot cooking.

We followed recommendations to brown the meat and saute the onions and double garlic, deglazing pan with red wine before putting into slow cooker. (America's Test Kitchen recommends doing this with all meats in a slow cooker.) About 5 hours into cooking we used a gravy separator to reduce the fat in the sauce. This was AMAZING and restaurant quality!!!! We are definitely adding to our rotation and can't wait to make for others.

I halved the recipe for 2 people, used what I had on hand, and it was still delicious. I used red onion, garlic powder, a sprig of thyme, and Malbec. Cooked it overnight and reheated the next day on low on the stove top. Will definitely make this again.

Although they were tender as can be - talk about bland this recipe lacked flavor. Don't think I would make again

Delicious and easy recipe. Will use again and again. Served these over wide egg noodles-delicious. Next time, I will brown the ribs, onion and garlic. I will also substitute one of the cups of wine for beef broth. I will also add a half cup or so of tomoto paste.

They were a little fatty - and a little too much for my little slow cooker! But they turned out great - so easy to do before work and something great to come home to. The ribs had to do two layers, as opposed to just one on the bottom. The mushrooms were probably not necessary, and (because of my love of tomatoes) I used a full 28oz can. AND I followed the recipe in Bon Appetit for tomato sauce - and it was AMAZING. I combined onions, garlic over heat, and added the meat (which I hand shredded) and a can of whole tomatoes. I then served over fresh homemade pasta (papperdale). I made two great dishes from this one short rib recipe, both of which i could eat again and again and again.

Fantastic. Lot's of flavor and extra sauce for dipping bread. Followed earlier suggustions: 1) Browned the ribs 2) Sauteed the garlic and onions 3) Added wine to skillet to get scrapings and cooked it down, then added some beef broth 4) Skipped the mushrooms 5) Refrigerated the ribs after they. It was definitely well received.

Yeah, these are fatty but they are so good! I did coat the short ribs with seasoned flour and browned them prior to putting them in the crockpot. I then sweated the onion in the same pan and deglazed it with the wine. I had more than 4.5 lbs of ribs so I doubled the garlic and added an additional can of tomatoes. I also added sprigs of fresh rosemary to the crockpot. Since other reviewers mentioned that the mushrooms didn't add much, I omitted them and didn't miss them. I skimmed the sauce well and re-seasoned it at the end of cooking. I think this is a great recipe for the crockpot and will try it without the extra step of browning the meat next time. We enjoyed them served over rice.

This was a hit! Definitely brown the meat first it gives it more flavor. The wine is a must!

Very tasty! I used beef broth instead of wine. I browned the short ribs like others have suggested. Cooked it on the stove top for about 3 hours. The only problem I have with this recipe is the fat.

Rating: 3
Delicious! I used 5.5 lbs. of short ribs. I followed suggestions of previous readers and made the following changes: seasoned and browned the short ribs, doubled the garlic, onion and parsley. Drained all but about 2 Tbsp. oil and sauteed onion until translucent, then added garlic for another 2 minutes. I used 3 cups of red wine (because of extra pound of ribs). The mushrooms added nothing; I would definitely leave them out. Cooked in a crockpot on high for 30 minutes, then on low for 7 hours, then high for 30 minutes. Meat fell off the bones. Downside of this recipe for me was all the fat. I spooned 1.5 cups of fat off the top. I would make it a day ahead or simply use pot roast.

Edible, but lackluster. I have many beef short rib recipes that I would serve before this one. I will not be keeping this in my personal recipe repertoire.

Rating: 4
The ease of making this dish plus the end results have made this a cold weather, comfort-food favorite here at my house. I have served it to kids, picky eaters and foodies alike, all of whom enjoyed it! Like most braised beef recipes, I actually like to make this one day ahead and refrigerate overnight, removing most of the coagulated fat from the top before reheating over low heat. Like others have suggested, browning the meat first also adds a nice depth to the flavors in this dish. The addition of diced carrots (2 medium) also melds nicely.

This recipe is beyond wonderful!! Am much indebted to suggestions of previous reviewers, and have a couple to add: 1) I doubled the amt. of garlic (and could have added even more); doubled the amt. of parsley; and chopped coarsely the garlic cloves and the 1/2 cup onion. Used about 6 oz of large white mushrooms,sliced. 2) Sprinkled the ribs with plenty of salt and freshly-ground pepper, and browned them very thoroughly -- to dark brown but not burnt -- on all sides (about 8 min) with 2 Tbs canola oil in a large, heavy skillet at medium-high heat, then set ribs aside. 3) Drained all but about 2 Tbs of the resulting fat in the skillet, and SAUTEED the chopped onions until translucent, then added the chopped garlic and SAUTEED for another 2 minutes until onions were gold brown. Set sauteed onions and garlic aside. 4) In same skillet, I simmered the red wine on medium/high heat, scraping the fond from bottom of pan, until reduced to about 2/3 cup. 5) Used a 4 quart slow cooker (6 qt was too large). Transferred ribs to bottom of cooker. (The ribs were too large (~ 5") to fit in one even layer on bottom of cooker, but it turned out not to matter at all.) Added all remaining ingredients and cooked on low heat for 6 1/2 hours, then cooked on high heat for 1 more hour. The meat was incredibly tender -- could have cut it with a flimsy plastic fork -- and succulent beyond description. Didn't take the trouble to reduce or thicken the sauce (of which there was well more than enough), because it was delicious as is (though thin) and it smelled too good to wait a moment longer! (Would probably reduce/thicken it next time). Will never look for another recipe for braised ribs...can't imagine one better than this!

This was excellent! I love short ribs and will order them whenever I see them on the menu so am choosey about them. I too browned them before putting them in the crockpot, used 1/2 good red wine and 1/2 beef broth. Deglazed the pan with the red wine while sauteing the onions/garlic. Used additional minced garlic. No mushrooms, that is probably what makes the sauce watery. I pureed the sauce with my stick blender and it made perfect gravy. Served with horseradish mashed potatoes and it was awesome! Eight hours is perfect in the crock pot. Husband loved it!

Yes. I've made this recipe three times, twice stovetop and the last time in the crock pot. Lots of au jus in the latter method. I do prefer the reducing of the liquid step. Not sure what type of wine to use. It does flavor the beef so it has to be the right type. I've tried two cabs and don't recall the other wine I tried. Any suggestions would be great :-)

A very tasty and simple recipe that is perfect to put together before work and come home to a great smelling house. Comfort food at its best: easy, tasty and filling. I serve over mashed potatoes with a green salad. Even better the next day!

My son's new favorite dish. Just as good without mushrooms. The sauce is a little runny but a quick whir of the stick blender takes care of that. So easy!

I have to admit I was pretty disapointed in this recipe. I always like to follow the recipe exactly before making my own adjustments. The broth just lacked flavor. I agree with others, that I would definatley brown the ribs prior to putting in the slow cooker. I as well, would reduce the broth down after cooking in the slow cooker all day, as the broth turned out very watery. Adding some extra spices and herbs would help to give the dish more flavor.

I am following up to my review from 10.3.08. I made this recipe again last week with some more tweaks and I feel like this is the way to go. First, I salted and peppered the ribs and browned them in a skillet. I poured out the rendered fat without cleaning out the pan. Then I deglazed the pan with some red wine, letting the wine boil down to half. (If you don't reduce the wine like this, the ribs end up tasting too alcohol-y.) I also threw in some fresh taragon and thyme and shallots that I had lying around. Quite an easy recipe that sort of just cooks itself.

Loved these. I substituted the diced tomatoes for an all natural tomato sauce only because I didn't have it on hand. They were very tender - falling off the bone tender. I did not salt the pepper as well as I should have but my guests seasoned to taste.

I decided to make this at about noon, so there wasn't enough time for the crock pot. So I used my dutch oven on the stove top. I followed the directions except: I browned the short ribs (I used some w/bone, some boneless) in some olive oil after I put a little salt and pepper on them) for about 15 min. I agree w/another reviewer who said that this is actually where the flavor in braising comes from (the browning). I used the other ingredients, but added another chopped onion, three more cloves of garlic (I minced them all). After browning the ribs, I removed them and then sauteed the onions and garlic in the drippings, put the wine and tomatoes in and added 1 c of beef broth. I brought it to a boil, put the ribs back in, then simmered for 3 hours. I added the mushrooms during the last 20 min. of cooking. Served them w/the roasted parsnips, which were amazing. So, if you don't want to use your crock pot or don't have time, I promise you'll love these results!

Definitely not the best short rib I've ever had. Have to doctor the sauce up with chicken bouillon after to make it taste good. Short rib is less tender than I expected after 8 hours of cooking. However, the ragu was awesome. Made the ragu with whole wheat spaghetti. Will make this again for the ragu.

Rating: 3
Delish! I doubled this recipe for 8 people. Half of the ribs w/ bone, half w/o and browned all before putting them in the crock pot. The crock pot was full and by midday I had to skim some liquid out. Forgot the bay leaves, used a whole bottle of wine and didn't add the mushrooms until the last hour or so b/c I forgot them too. The house smelled wonderful and the dinner was perfect for a cold rainy, windy night of autumn. Served with Roasted Autumn Veggies and Green Beans. Will make again and again.

Rating: 4
Oh my god this was good. I'd maybe use a little less wine though -- it was a bit too wine-y even after it reduced down. Don't scrimp on the 8 hours in the crock pot. It must stay in there for all of that time. Tasted even better on day 2 as leftovers!

Rating: 3
This was delicious but a few modifications were in order. Brown, and season the meat first, use less liquid then called for and reduce (and de-grease)the sauce after the meat is finished cooking.

I made this recipe but I seasoned the meat and then dipped the meat in flour and browned the meat in a little oil.I don't like crock pots so I cooked this on the top of the stove. The amount of cooking time was 3hours plus. I used boneless short ribs and thickened the sauce with cornstarch.I served this dish with mashed potatoes and it was very good. I would make it again.

I thought these came out pretty good. Of course, they were the first short ribs I've ever made. I only wish they had a little more flavor. http://megan-deliciousdishings.blogspot.com/2008/10/braised-beef-short-ribs.html

Any REAL braise REQUIRES searing to maintain juiciness and caramelization for flavor. And a dutch oven IS a slow cooker. Save your crock pots to keep your stinking swedish meatballs or smoky links warm, or better yet, use it as a plant holder.

For the ease of this dish it was very good. DH particularly enjoyed it. I agree with the cook from BC that reducing the sauce is the way to go. Mine was extremely watery. I also think you could get away with a cheaper cut of meat since you're cooking it for 8 hours.

I followed this recipe to the letter, just wasn't all that crazy about the results. There are likely better short ribs recipes here. My family liked the dish but didn't love it.

Rating: 3
I was very happy with the flavor of this dish, however I think I may try a leaner cut of meat next time. The short ribs just had way too much fat on it for me. The pasta sauce from the leftovers was wonderful, it reminded me of my grandma's "red gravy".

Rating: 3
This dish was pretty good once I made some tweaks to it. The most important tweak being that I salted and peppered the short ribs, and then roasted them at 400 degrees in the oven for 15 minutes before placing them in the slow cooker. This made a world of difference. The recipe called for too much wine for my taste, so next time I'm going to cut back on the amount of wine and maybe add some beef broth in its place. With the above tweak, I think this recipe will be a real keeper, especially for the convenience factor.

Very flavorful, but a little fatty. Tulsa OK

Delicious. It was even better as leftovers a few days later. I added a cup of beef broth and ended up with a lot of sauce, so after I took out the ribs, I boiled down the liquid, which probably improved the flavour of the sauce. I also thickened it with a beurre manié (a mixture of flour and butter). I did not find that the meat suffered from not sauteing it: it was very tender with lots of flavour. The only thing I would change would be to sauté the onions before putting them in with the meat. Will certainly make it again.

Rating: 3
This was delicious! I liked it even more the next day after the fat had congealed and I could remove it with ease...not as oily obviously. I tried skimming the fat while it was hot, but I didn't do such a good job. Excellent!

I adore short ribs and did not like this recipie at all. I should have known it wouldn't turn out when the smell emanating from my kitchen for 8 hours was not good. I followed the recipie exactly. I too agree with the other reviewer that short ribs are meant to be browned and cooked in a dutch oven. I am just hoping I can salvage the leftovers!

Sounded like a great idea just to leave it cook all day. Now I know why I don't use my crockpot. It was awful. I used a Merlot and the sauce was unpleasant. Make your short ribs in the oven or on top of the stove.

Made this with Cabernet and all boneless ribs. Next time will use half boneless and half with bones. Left mushrooms in big quarters. Cheated and used bottled garlic and dried onions (large pieces that I got at Penzey's). Sauce was thin so thickened it with cornstarch. Boneless was too tough at 8 hours so cooked it 3 hours more. I don't like crock pot meals (I keep trying though) and this was good.

Rating: 4
Really tasty. The sauce was thin, as others have mentioned, but it was delicious (though I think I undersalted it). I used a Sangiovese. Changes: only 2 lbs. of ribs, 8 oz. of mushrooms. I served it with the Roasted Parsnips, and made the suggested Beef Ragu with the leftovers (which was fantastic, and very quick). I would make it again if only for an excuse to make that ragu again. Both great weeknight meals.

While the sauce was indeed thin, it was a great weekday/work day recipe. I added whole button mushrooms instead of sliced and some fresh okra from the garden. More garlic never hurts. Very yummy.

Rating: 4
This is very good. I used a combination of short ribs and boneless short ribs as the store only had 2# of regular--the regular ribs were much better. The sauce wasn't what I expected, as short ribs that I've had in restaurants have a thicker, almost gravy-like sauce. It's delicious, though, and great for dipping bread. Next time I'll add more tomatoes and mushrooms, as this allowed us to top the meat only sparingly.

Rating: 4
I made this almost exactly as described with the single exception that I used pot roast instead of short ribs because it was on special at Publix. I used a Zinfandel for the red wine. Although the sauce was thin, not gravy- like, I kept it as is and it was delicious. I served it with the roasted parsnips described in the Bon Appétit October 2008 issue and they were a wonderful change of pace from mashed potatoes etc. I am very much looking forward to making the leftovers into the pasta sauce also described in the article. Would I make any changes? I might be tempted to throw a few more garlic cloves in there, but only because we're garlic hounds. It's great just the way it is.
