I thought the Sauce was lacking a Sweetness with the Acid from the Wine and the Saltiness from the Cheese.So I added sliced Bosc Pear and a little Calvados.It made the Sauce.

I made just the Gorgonzola Sauce as a dip for bacon meatballs. It really is outstanding. It's complex and delicate, without the Gorgonzola being overpowering or too rich. Really good. I'd like to try some on pasta.

I really enjoy this dish. Nice, dimensional sauce, juicy pork (I brined the tenderloins for an hour before sauteing). Served with a nice, crisp salad, and good bread it's a perfect and easy meal. Plus, leftovers are also really good. Slather that cold sauce on a baguette slice with a slice of pork and a slice of tomato. So good...

Mmmm, this was good with the following modifications (am Iron Cheffing it tonight!): only had chicken breast, so chopped and pan fried. Used a sweet pinot grigio instead. Also added the following touches: peccorino, fresh basil to the top and some toasted pine nuts. Cooked up some al dente pasta and this was a darn good pasta dish. Rich, but light at the same time. The crispness of fresh basil added a great finish to the dish.

Yummy and easy. The only minor change that I made was to use fresh thyme. I served with Brocollini with Pecan Brown Butter, which was a perfect combination. Will make again!

This was very good but it msde a lot of sauce. I should have cut the quantity in half as others have said. The mustard gave the pork a nice zing. I'll make again. Watch the salt also as it can be a little salty.

Great dinner tonight! I added thin-cut fresh apple slices to the top of the pork before adding the sauce and thought that the astringent qualities of the apple added to the creaminess of the sauce. Would definitely make again.

I love this recipe! As written, very nice and rich, I also make it frequently omitting the sauce for a quick dinner, and it's almost as good without. I preheat the oven and toss in some potatoes to start baking before prepping the pork, it makes a very easy dinner.

I have made this a number of times and it is fantastic! It's nice to brown the pork and cover with sauce a few hours ahead of time so you don't have the mess with guests around. I make the sauce early too. Serve it with the Brocollini with brown butter recipe (adding crimini mushrooms) and mashed potatoes with the extra sauce used like gravy! I've passed this recipe on to many friends. Easy and delicious!

this was excellent...however I cooked til 165 as I prefer a bit more well done on the pork (and it was still pink). The gorgonzola sauce would also work with a roast beef fillet. Served with roasted cauliflower and toasted orzo with sundried tomatoes.

This is a wonderful, yet simple recipe. I added some fresh thyme, and kosher salt and pepper to the sauce. I also did not need to cook the pork for 30 minutes. I like my pork at around 145 internal temperature though, so that it stays moist. Will be making this again!

Rating: 3
I have made this dish a few times usually following the recipe and it is always good. However, tonight my prep was different, in that I seared the pork in the same pan I used in the oven. While the pork was resting on a platter, I deglazed with the wine, mixed the flour with the broth and added to the pan off the flame, then I whisked in the cream and cheese. The result appears to be a good textured sauce. I am waiting for my family to arrive home from football practice, but I think they will like it. I'll let you know if it bombs.

Really good ! The only adjustment we made was not to use all of the dijon sauce for the pork, since it seemed to make a bit too much. Very good recipe, goes great with a light Italian Barolo.

I have been making this since it was published in 2000. It is so simple and easy to make that I'm almost (but not quite) embarrased when the superlatives begin. I'm puzzled by the reviews that speak of the sauce being too thin. I usually need to thin it a little. But the flavor--oh my! Rich. but not overpowerig--this is one of my stad-by recipes. I make it even if I don;t know if my guests care for blue-type cheeses. I have never had any negative feedback about this dish even from people who claim to dislike veined cheese. Slurge--make the dih--enjoy!

Made this for special Valentines Day dinner! Made a few alterations, Marinated pork tenderlion cut into medallions for 3 hours then pan sauteed to medium for a nice browned color. Served over pasta tossed in sauce. For sauce: only change I made was using half parm cheese and half gorgonzola. It mellowed the flavor for us just right! The sauce was like VELVET!!! Leftovers were fab as the flavors intensified. Finished dish with a sprinkle of parm cheese. This was one of the best dishes I've ever made! Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe. The sauce had a wonderful flavor, had no problems with being too strong or too thin/thick. Pork is wonderful, aalso great with chicken prepared with the mustard marinade.

I CRAVE this sauce-- excellent! I serve big eaters, so I doubled everything but the sauce for a party of four and/ or to ensure leftovers for two. Get really good gorgonzola--it doesn't need to be pre- crumbled. 25 minutes was perfect for pork. Served with snap peas boiled in water for five minutes and a little pepper--great compliment.

Cream sauce recipe is fantastic with some minor changes (I didn't make the pork) -- it's really thin and just a bit bland, so I added a splash of Worchestershire, some black pepper (didn't have white on hand), and 2-3 extra tablespoons of flour to thicken it. Served it with fondue -- excellent on red meat and mushrooms!

This really was very good. I used thin cut pork chops for the recipe since there is only 2 of us, then thinly sliced chops and topped with sauce. The sauce would be very good on other things such as pasta or steak. Yummy!

Easy, quick recipe. Overall taste was a bit light in flavor. Would recommend creating sauce from a bit more traditional way sauting shallots and deglazing the pan with the white wine. Sauce could be finished with white pepper to taste.

Amazing! Awesome recipe. Read reviews and saw that some thought sauce was thin so I used 1 1/2 Tablespoons of butter and flour and mine was plenty thick. Tossed sauce with corkscrew pasta as well, lots of sauce left over but will have absolutely no problem paring it with other things. Served with the apple/fennel salad on this sight. It was a nice clean flavor to go with this rich dish!

I use the gorgonzola as a pasta sauce. Try serving it with a spicy red tomato meat pasta sauce, too. You can layer it or drizzle both sauces over pasta separately. Very naughty.

Quite possibly one of the best easy recipes I have tried from epicurious! I used boneless pork chops, which I transferred to a baking sheet after I sauteed them and then baked for 15 min. I used the same pan to cook the sauce, and added wine w/the broth. (kept everything else the same) Served with garlic dill mashed potatoes and green beans and also sprinkled gorgonzola over the sauce spooned on the pork. It melted and added an additional layer of decadence...so so delicious!

A sophisticated dish that is easy to prepare. I substituted fatfree half and half for the whipping cream, adding it last and cooking just until heated through so it did not turn stringy or clump. Of course, since I did not boil the sauce it did not thicken but the calories saved were worth it.

Since there are no half forks to score with, Id score this a 3 1/2 fork. I like to do as much in advance as possible so when I get home from work a gourmet meal more manageable.

I have made this dish several times and my guests have raved about it. I usually cook the sauce longer than suggested and there is plenty so I usually half the recipe or use twice the amount of pork. I serve this with Yukon Gold Smashed Potatoes and Apple Fennel Salad which are perfect side dishes with this dish. I sometimes serve with mashed cauliflower instead of potatoes since this is lower in carbs.

I wanted to make something special for my sister's birthday and she is a very picky eater but loves blue cheeses so I tried this. We all loved it!

I serve with grilled asparagus, garlic-parsley new potatoes and salad with spring greens, pear and toasted sesame seeds dressed with a light vinagrette. Yummy.

I did this with a pork roast instead of tenderloin, with great success. Be sure to use low salt broth for the sauce, and don't even consider the recipe unless you really like blue cheese. Otherwise, this is a tasty, different way to serve pork.

I love this recipe. Easy to make on a weeknight, and the flavor combination is excellent. Do not feel it is necessary to brown the pork prior, and have sometimes made the sauce w/o the wine and it is still delicious. Of course, you musts have fans of blue cheese for this one! Will definitely make again.

Just made this for New Year's Eve - it was easy to make, definitely no fuss and came out great. I paired it with some roasted potatoes seasoned with some spanish ground sweet pepper (similar to Paprika), I didn' t even need to adjust the sauce (other than some salt and pepper towards the end) because it makes more than enough. Definitely will make it again

I was seriously disappointed in this recipe. I can't believe I just threw out all of the leftovers and the residual sauce, but no one will eat it. The pork was mediocre and the sauce was worse. I followed the recipe exactly, but it just did not live up to the raves...I will never make it again and just deleted it from my recipe box. Normally I can go by the reviews and am not disappointed...but not this time.

Divine! So easy and quick to make for such fantastic results. If you like blue-veined cheeses, you ought to love this recipe. I used fresh thyme and spicy Mister Mustard on the pork. I halved the recipe and didn't want to open a can of broth for 2 T so used Tone chicken base in a half cup of water. I was worried about too much salt, but once the sauce was over the pork and bowties I put on the bottom of the plate, the salt was not very perceptible. The sauce thickened nicely while it sat. I can hardly wait to make this again. To capture the yummy sauce, the cook should probably serve rice, potatoes or pasta with the pork. I'm delighted I found this recipe.

I was surprised at how good this recipe turned out and how easy it was to make. I made it as part of a holiday buffet and it was the hit of the party.

Very, very nice. The sauce is addictive. It's very easy to make, and my 2-year old daughter loved it too. My wife doesn't eat pork, so she missed out, but the sauce, as others have noted, would go well with rice, noodles, veggies, etc. The flavors are very rich and somewhat heavy, so this will be more of a 'special occaision' dish on my table. It might get old if I made it all the time.

made this as I had some leftover gorg--very tasty. for the pork, I pretty much followed the recipe but used fresh thyme from the garden,which was very nice. for the sauce, I used regular milk instead of cream, but more gorg, which gave it a nice, strong flavor. I also used LOTS of white pepper. finally, in the absence of white wine, I used pear brandy, which really added a wonderful level of complexity. easy and next time I will make for guests.

Wonderful, easy, elegant! I only drizzled a bit of the gorgonzola sauce over each piece and then served the gorgonzola sauce in personal ramekins so that everyone could control the amount of sauce. We also had stuffed the pork with herbed stuffing that benefitted from the both the dijon and the gorgonzola sauce. We'll definitely make this dish again!

The first time I've given four forks - it probably would have earned them even without the sauce, which was delicious. If you're not a gorgonzola fan, make this anyway!

I made the sauce ahead of time and just reheated...added a little bit of white pepper, but otherwise made no changes. Also, seared the tenderloins earlier in the day...you can do it more than 2 hours ahead of time, so this is a very easy dish to do for company and so impressive. This goes on the top of my list for pork tenderloin recipes and I can't wait to make it again...deserves more than 4 forks!

Gave this four forks because of the lovely layer of flavors as a company meal the first night, but the next night the left overs were comfort food at it's finest. Since it is just two of us, we used a 1 1/2lb tenderloin with half of the mustard sauce, but made all of the cheese sauce (stilton for us ... it's what we had). Made mac and cheese by adding the left over sauce, the remaining pork cubed, and some asparagas tips, to cooked macaroni. Baked till heated through, covered with some homemade seasoned bread crumbs. VERY good both nights! Oh and Laura from Halifax reminds me, we browned ours in a cast iron skillet stove top, and added the sauce to the pork in the skillet for the oven, agree with her, no need to diry two pans, just different conclusion.

Rating: 3
This is Laura from Halifax again, with an addendem. It is completely un-necessary to brown the pork prior to placing in such a hot oven. It comes out pleasantly browned and omitting this step saves on time and clean-up. I've upgraded my rating to 3 forks because the pork is so delicious even without the sauce.

I never give a four but you gotta here. I used dry sherry too. The sauce is pour heaven when a curd of gorgonzola bursts in one's mouth. Nice with baby broccoli.

Made this dish for a dinner party of 6 using 2-1lb tenderloins plus about 1/3 of another tenderloin. Glad I purchased a little extra since it all disappeared quickly. I took a previous reviewers advice and used dry-sherry in place of the wine. I think I'll try the wine next time and reduce the cream a little bit. The sauce didn't have as much gorgonzola flavor as I would have liked. Served it with new potatoes and steamed asparagus and it made a great meal. I would definitely make this again, however I might try grilling the pork next time.

This is my favorite kind of recipe because it is easy, can be prepared ahead of time and it is delicious. I made spaetzle with browned butter and maple ginger butternut squash to accompany the pork.

I made the sauce for a pork loin roast instead of tenderloins. I didn't use mustard on the pork, just my usual mixture of thyme and a little garlic. I was disappointed in the sauce. It seemed to need another flavor to round out the gorgonzola. I will add some mustard to the leftover sauce to see if that is the problem.

This is a great company dish since you can do the prep work before company comes and just pop the it in the oven when they arrive.

After 5 years of falling back on the always wonderful Grilled Pork Tenderloin with Roasted Red Bell Peppers (Bon Appetit,April 1997), this is a new contender. Following suggestions, we wrapped the pork in bacon after slathering on the mustard mix, then grilled (did not sear). Used half and half in the gorgonzola sauce. Everything was fabulous-served w/ wilted spinach and wide noodles. Froze the leftovers all together as a "casserole", just as great! Will definitely use for next dinner party!

What is so awesome about this recipe is that the sauce is very universal. Of course I had too much even after making the recipe with 3 tenderloins and 3 filets of pork, so I packed it up and used it on several other things. Went out and bought ground turkey and pork and made burgers with the sauce on top and even as a little something extra on grilled cheese sandwiches. Everyone loved the sauce, so using it again and again was a welcomed avenue of dining! If you make this dish, people's eyes will roll to the backs of their heads, it's that good! :)

I thought this dish was okay, but certainly not what I was expecting given the great reviews. I certainly didn't find it to be worth all the fat and calories.

Pretty good. Wrapping the pork in bacon added a lot of flavor. The sauce was very good and can be used on many other meals. It was very easy and quick to make. I didn't have any smoke from the bacon, but I did not wrap the pork with the uncooked bacon until after I was done searing the pork when it was ready to go into the oven.

I used 2 3/4lb tenderloins(1 1/2 lb total) and they served four people. Marinated the meat for 2 hours, per reviewers' suggestion and it came out great. Whole family liked the sauce. Only problem - I covered the meat with bacon and there was so much smoke, I would never do this for a dinner party. Any suggestions?

Unbelievably tasty and easy to make. Great to serve for guests. It made lots of wonderful sauce which I used a few days later over a side of angel hair pasta. This recipe will definitely be put into the recipe-rotation!

This recipe was wonderful. I actually overcooked the pork but it was still juicy and moist. The sauce was excellent. My boyfriend, a gourmet cook and manager of a restaurant, loved the sauce and had it salmon last night and said it was great. And the sauce could not be easier! The pork is even good warmed up with the sauce for lunch..(I am eating it now!) Yummy! Even if you are not a gongonzola fan, you should try this...the cobination with the mustard and thyme is really quite tasty.

My family loved this dish so much that I have made it so many times over the last couple of years. The mix of ingredients makes the taste so complex yet tantalizing to the taste buds. I usually serve it with steamed new potatoes and asparagus. I also add some white pepper to the sauce when I'm cooking to add to its complexity. Leftover is great piled on crostini, or some toasted baguette for appetizer.

Amazing - wasn't sure how it was going to work out, but it was terrific! I used chicken instead of pork - just be careful not to dry out the chicken when following the recipe. Really, really good!!!

I made the sauce and the pork. I haven't tried the sauce yet, but I followed the reviewers comments and used a wholegrain mustard, thyme and olive oil to marinate the pork in...then covered the pork in bacon strips and roasted it. PERFECTION for Christmas Dinner! I haven't used the gorgonzola sauce yet - because the pork was so fantastic without it we didn't even touch it! I'm planning to toss it with some pasta for a quick dinner tonight!

Excellent dish - VERY rich. Simple and quick to make - followed the recipe exactly as specified. Pair with something leafy (spinach salad?) to cut down on the richness. Will definitely make again - even my sick wife liked it :)

this is excellent..I prepare the pork as directed,but then braise pork.I add 1/4 c. chicken broth to the skillet..stir in the dijon, cover & cook low for 15 min...remove from skillet & keep warm. proceed with sauce. slice pork & return to sauce. garnish with sliced crisp fried shallots (done ahead). Very Good. Served with Garlic mashed Potatoes & currant glazed baby carrots.this is all done in skillet & is moist & yummy. you can add fine chop onion & garlic while braising too.

This is my new all-time favorite pork dish. I can't believe there are actually human beings who didn't like it!! I made it as is and would not change one thing. My husband also agreed that he's never had a better pork tenderloin. It's wonderful as is, but the gorgonzola sauce sends it out of this world. Our guests raved. We'll be making this one for Christmas.

I actually made this a few months ago, and a few times because it was so easy and so wonderful.

I loved this dish! It was so easy and would be an excellent meal to serve to company. I have also made it without the sauce and my family loved the flavor of the pork without sauce too!

Really enjoyed this and it was really easy. Hwoever, regular dijon mustard and ground thyme gave the pork a "green" coating, so when I made it again (this time with boneless chicken breast seared and then baked the same way - though for less time) I used whole grain country dijon and thyme leaves (vs the ground) and it looked much nicer and had a really nice flavor - added a little more zip. Only thing else I did was to add more gorgonzola! This makes a lot of sauce, too, so I tossed it with angel hair pasta topped with chopped fresh chives as a side dish the next night. Give this a try!

OK, I was looking forward to this because of rave reviews. I'm addicted to the pasta dish at a local diner that has a gargonzola sauce on it. I like both Gargonzola and Bleu Cheese but I was NOT impressed by this. I wound up mixing some left over dijon mix into the sauce just to make it barely edible. It was alright over the pork because it was roasted with the mustard. My husband and kids wouldn't touch it. I'm not going to bother keeping the left over sauce. I didn't try the bacon trick, but I may try it later without the cheese sauce. I thought the pork was good with the mustard sauce, so I bet the bacon is just fantastic. Here's hoping.

Rating: 3
Wonderful. My partner and I both loved the sauce. I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and ditched the mustard. Instead I wrapped the pork in cured bacon (like others) and inserted thyme into deep incisions in the pork. Wonderful. The bacon is nice b/c it balances the sauce. But the sauce is the real keeper in this recipe. It'll be great for company. Two thumbs up!

Rating: 3
I'm rating only the sauce recipe because I used it for Spinach Ricotta Gnocchi with Tomato Sauce, also on this site. A delicious sauce, better and lighter than most gorgonzola sauces. I'm sure it's great with the pork, too, and plan to try it. I changed nothing in the sauce recipe except to cut the ingredients in half as I was cooking for two. I can easily imagine this sauce would be wonderful on lots of things - pasta, vegetables, etc.

Made this for friends the other night and we all really enjoyed it. I will say the pork was only ok, but I am looking very forward to taking the other reviewers suggestion and skipping the browning and wrapping the tenderloins in bacon. Sounds absolutely delicious. The highlight of this dish is the gorgonzola sauce. Since my friends are on the Atkins diet, I used only the teeniest bit of flour and just let the sauce boil for a long time to thicken it. It was so good, we were just pouring it onto our plates and licking it off our forks. Had enough left over sauce for tonight, which made my husband very happy.

This was so good and EASY!! However, the cooking time is way off. I cooked it for 20 min. instead of 30 and it was perfect. Also, the meat didn't take as long to brown, about 5 min. The sauce recipe makes ample!!! I did sprinkle paprika on it before serving to give it a more pleasing appearance.

I rarely bother to respond to a recipe, however, this is an exception. I served this tonight, because pork tenderloin was on sale at my local market. It was truly delicious.

Mixed reviews -- I really liked this, thought the sauce was yummy (though had a slightly gritty texture) and the pork was perfect. We were making it with a slightly freezer-burned loin and maybe the sauce would have been too heavy for a perfect cut of meat. My boyfriend liked it, but liked the pork-mustard smell (as it came out of the oven) so much that he was sad the sauce was so overpowering.

Rating: 0
I don't know how I messed this up, but I really did. I thought that I had followed the recipe exactly, but my results were not at all like everyone else's. The sauce was completely flavorless and the Dijon crust on the pork tenderloin tasted lousy with the sauce. Yuck! I dumped the Gorgonzola sauce down the garbage disposal and enjoyed the pork by itself - though I must say that even that was not spectacular. Oh, well...I guess we all have an "off" day. I'm jealous that everyone else got to enjoy what should have been an excellent recipe and I messed-up! Did anyone else have a problem getting the sauce right? -any advice? I reread the recipe and the reviews, and I can't figure out where I went wrong.

Okay, this was beyond incredible (for pork tenderloin). I rarely "dish" out 4 forks, but this deserved it. The sauce was "to die for". I added one minced garlic clove to the mustard mixture.

The sauce is wonderful, but I thought that the pork was less than special. The second time I did this, I spread the dijon and thymes on the pork-tenderloin (without browning it), wrapped it in bacon and cooked it as indicated in the recipie. That was absolutely AMAZING!!! I served with the sauce, fresh pasta and steamed broccoli and the combination was just SO good! My guests were raving, my boyfriend loved it and so did I! Try that, my friends, cuz I'm telling you: There is no other pork dish that will compare to this!

Excellent. Followed suggestions of other reviewers and substituted chicken for pork and made it all in one pan.

I made this for company and it was a huge success. I marinaded the pork in the olive oil, thyme and dijon for about 6 hours and then I grilled it. The gorgonzola sauce was fabulous!!!!! My husband doesn't eat pork so he used the sauce on a piece of grilled chicken. He enjoyed it as much as the rest of us.

I made this dish at a grocery store wine tasting. It was a HUGE success! I had one person tell me this was the best pork dish she'd ever had. Since I did not have access to an oven, I cut the pork tenderloin into bite-size pieces; sauteed the tenderloin in the thyme, dijon and olive oil; removed the tenderloin to a plate and then proceeded to make the sauce in the same pan (after wiping it clean). In a 3 hour time period I made this dish 3 times. It's super fast and easy. I'll definitely make this again!

This recipe definitely rates 4 forks. The pork was moist and tender and tasty, and the sauce was superb. What really makes the whole thing great is the simplicity of the preparation. I agree with a previous reviewer that the results are more than worth the time and effort that go into this recipe. Even my brother-in-law who was totally turned off at the thought of putting cheese sauce on his good pork tenderloin was coerced into trying a taste, ended up pleasantly surprised and scoffing sauce down with the meat and everything else as well

All the reviews rated this wonderful so I had to try it. It was moist, looked and smelled good so that first bite was a big disappointment. It was NOT something I would make for company.

This was GREAT! I had to cook this fast, so I seperated the tenderloin into cutlets and pounded thinly, reduced cooking time accordingly. Coated each side with the mustard mixture and also pursuant to many comments (I really love people's comments) reduced the thyme to a heaping teaspoon. Finally I made sure total liquid was only a cup. Was still tons, but oh so very very good! Next time I will try with the whole tenderloin, but wow anyway, and absoultely wonderful with the lemon baby potatoes, fresh asparagus and just plain french bread. Now where is my "butt-master", "thigh master", will also try with lower cream versions, but the real thing was worth a few jogs.

Outstanding! We are huge lovers of Gorgonzola and found the sauce to be excellent. Next time I would spice it up a bit w/ garlic and a bit of ground pepper. I cooked the pork a little slower and found it extremely tender.

A wonderful recipe! I thought the gorgonzola sauce was delicious and subtle (I might have put a tad bit less cheese than called for). I find that I generally don't care for meats with Dijon mustard, but the mustard on this pork just made the meat more tender with a very slight mustardy taste. If the sauce didn't have so many fat calories I would probably make this all the time!

This is the first time I've taken the time to rate a recipe, and let me tell you --- this one is worth my time. It was incredibly simple to make and was pure perfection.

Enjoy!

I wasn't sure whether to use gorgonzola dolce or gorgonzola picante, but I went with the picante because it was better suited to crumbling, as specified in the recipe. The results were outstanding! I served it with fingerling potatoes that I first boiled for ten minutes and then dressed with a little olive oil, salt, and pepper and roasted in a separate pan from the pork. The potatoes were a great way to use some of the fabulous sauce. What a treat!

Loved this recipe. I gave 4 forks because not only were the flavors FANTASTIC it was so easy. I can't wait to serve it to company. I did not brown the meat for the full 10 minutes and I roasted it on convection 400 for 20 minutes. It was so moist and tender. The sauce is to die for but as others have said a little goes a long way. The mustard and gorgonzola goes sooo well together. I served the pork with Baby Potatoes w/Parsley & Lemon Butter (BA 2/01) and Steamed Broccoli w/Olive Oil, Garlic, & Lemon (G 3/99).

This was a fantastic dish. The gorgon was muted almost to the point of being bleu cheese, so if there are bleu cheese fans out there this is for you.

I make pork tenderloin at least 3x/month. This recipe was exceptional. The pork, on its own, has spectacular flavor. Due to a mix-up I had to use evaporated skim milk in the sauce, so I used a bit less wine and a bit more butter/flour; I also used less than the full cup of gorgonzola called for. The texture was fine, (though there was enough sauce for two recipes of pork. Don't double the sauce if you're doubling the pork!) and the flavor was rich and delicious. I served this with crispy roasted new potatoes (great w/ the sauce too) and the Caramel Chomeur (Bon Appetit) for dessert. All rich, all delicious, very few leftovers.

I made this recipe with pork chops for two people, sauteeing the chops on one side while spreading the mustard paste on the other side, then flipping the chops and using the rest of the paste on the partially-cooked side. I made the sauce exactly as specified with two exceptions--fat free half and half for the whipping cream, and a whole beef bouillion cube plus 1/4 cup of water instead of 1/4 cup of broth, to give the sauce more flavor. Exceptionally good, and we eat lots of pork chops. Very easy, too, and impressive enough to serve to my picky gourmand of a father-in-law.

Very Good.. My guests loved it and so did my husband. I marinated the pork overnight and did back off just a little on the thyme. I used half and half instead of whipping cream for the sauce. The sauce is very good, not as strong tasting as you would think, but a little bit of sauce goes a long way.

Rating: 1
I was disappointed by this dish, primarily because of the sauce. Although we love all the ingredients in other uses, the sauce in this recipe just tastes like uncomplex blue cheese melted and poured over the meat. In addition to not having pizazz itself, the sauce overpowers the flavor of the meat, to the extent that we only tasted the cheese.

Rating: 4
Made this dish for New Year's Eve dinner and have had it three times since! It is absolutely delicious and easy to prepare. I like the Tbsp. of thyme but have also added a few tsps. of fresh rosemary, which may have balanced out the flavor a bit. The quantity of meat is not quite right, 1 1/2 lbs. would not serve 6, more like 2-3, and there is a lot of left over sauce...so buy more meat and enjoy! My boyfriend loves this recipe and would eat it every night!

I balked at using a Tbs of thyme and should have heeded my culinary instinct. The thyme flavour was way too dominant. The pork was moist and delicious otherwise, and the gorgonzola sauce really comes alive with the addition of a Tbs of sherry and a grind or two of black pepper.I will make again but with only a teaspoon of thyme.

If it were up to me, we'd have this dish every other week at our house. My picky husband was very impressed with the flavor and how tender the pork chops came out.
