I've made this recipe with both semi-boneless and whole quails and it is a keeper either way, although you do have to cook the quails longer than the recipe indicated. I seared them over med-high heat for about 5 mins total, then put them in a 450-degree oven for 10 mins and they were juicy and tender. But guess what? I re-heated the leftover birds for 10 mins at 350 degrees the following days and they were even better!

Great flavour. Stovetop cooking wasn't enough though, so I had to bake the quails in the oven under foil for about 20 minutes at 350 - even after 20 minutes they were still rare.

this recipe was good but not excellent. the taste was good enough for me to make it again. perhaps the sauce for chicken or something easier to get than quail.

We don't have quail nearby, so I used free-range bone-in chicken breasts and served the dish over jasmine rice. My wife and friends were taken aback by the use of pomegranate but LOVED the flavor combination! Definitely a keeper!
