I made these after my local pharmacy was out of my standby Bequet sea salt caramels, and I was very happy with the result. I cooked to 250 after reading all of the warnings about consistency issues, but I found the caramel was more like toffee (not bad, but I renamed it-- thank you for the suggestion!). The candy was still fabulous, but I think I would prefer a softer caramel and will try for 249 on the next go around--probably tonight. Make extra because they go quickly!

I cooked the caramel to 248, and although it melted in your mouth, it was incredibly difficult to work with, even after extensive refrigeration. I will cook it to at least 250 next time. I also coated the caramels in chocolate and sprinkled them with more fleur de sel, which was delicious. The hardened chocolate made it possible to handle the caramels. I would suggest going very lightly on oiling the parchment, as well. I thought I had lightly oiled it, but my caramels came out coated in the oil. Overall a very solid recipe with good flavor!

I'm new to candy making and these really did come out pretty well. I followed the suggestion to reduce the amount of butter, probably down to just 4 Tablespoons. Might reduce even further next time as at room temperature they got kind of soft and melty. Still super delicious, just softer than I wanted. A little chill in the fridge and they were good to go again. Also dipped half of each piece in chocolate and topped with more salt. I think had I dipped the whole thing in chocolate the coating would have kept the really soft caramels from getting so melty. Best of both worlds, soft, chewy caramels and chocolate coating. I think that would be a winner.

This was a really good and easy recipe. I wanted to have the salt more pronounced so only added half to recipe and sprinkled remaining over the caramels. Delicious!

Made these yesterday, and they were, in a word, luscious! Followed recipe exactly and they turned out perfectly, if slightly soft. Next time I will probably cook to 1 or 2 degrees higher than 248 and may try to dip some of the completed caramels in chocolate. Also, I did add some Fleur de Sel crystals to the top of the candies before they set up completely as I really like the sweet-salty combo.

These caramels were DELISH! I'm 12, and my mom and I made these for the first time tonight. It was my first time boiling sugar, so we over-mixed and burnt the sugar, corn syrup and water mixture. Once we tried it for a second time, it turned out perfectly! We figured out that when the recipe says not to stir but to swirl the pan, it literally means to take the pan by the handles, and swirl it in circles! (It took us 5 to 6 minutes for it to fully cook correctly) I hope that this info has been helpful so you don't have to try the sugar, corn syrup, and water mixture twice. Happy carameling! :) ~Morgan and Mommy!

Made these last year for Christmas presents, and will make them again. (Luckily I have a few small people to help me wrap, because that is a pain.) They were perfect! Hunnybunny--you need to brown your sugar longer. Don't be afraid to let it get a little darker. If it gets too dark, you can make toffee, or just toss it and start over!

Heating it up to 248 is way too high! I now have a 8x8 slab of solid toffee...I'm going to make this recipe again because the flavor is perfect but I should've known better. I plan on just watching the consistency and when it looks not too runny but not too tough, then I will pour it out. 220!

This was my first candy making experience and it turned out well. My pot of sugar lingered around 200F for what seemed like a long time (maybe 10 min.) then it started to gradually rise and as soon as it hit 300F it just skyrocketed, so for other newbies out - keep a very close eye on the sugar and once it reaches 300 or so add the cream mixture. Needless to say, I burned the sugar of the first batch but added the cream anyways, I kept it at 235-240F and the texture was perfect. The burnt taste is kind of like coffee so I told people they were "coffee caramels" and they believed me! The second time I tried it, I added the cream at 310F and then it maintained at 250F, and made a slightly harder caramel that is perfect if you don't have any dental woes. As for the review about the caramels lacking color, you have to let the sugar mixture cook up to 270+, a candy therm. has lots of indicators about temp and candy texture, color, etc notes on it. Anyhow, burnt or not, these caramels were a hit with friends, neighbors and coworkers.

Help! I was so excited to try this recipe after trying a friend's caramels, but it was an epic fail! The caramel was way too soft, and I don't think I ever achieved the caramel color the sugar/corn syrup/water was supposed to have (mine came out kind of flesh- colored). I used a deep fat thermometer....did I just not wait long enough for the caramelization? Any advice GREATLY appreciated!

This was my first time making caramel, and it came out perfect! This recipe is very easy. But, I simmered for around 45 minutes until the caramel reached 248. I suppose that I could have turned up the heat to shorten the time, but I was worried that I would burn it.

Rating: 4
Truly fantastic. I used Himalayan pink salt, and only put 1/2 in the caramel, leaving the other 1/2 to adorn the top. I used a splash of rose water after taking the cream off heat. Subtle, but lovely flavor. Had no problems with dry parchment paper, had no problems cutting after two hours. Wrapped in small squares of wax paper, which wasn't as difficult as some reviewers noted. Perfect gift for Valentine's Day!

You won't realize how delicious these caramels are until you eat another caramel. They will all seem completely tasteless and awful after you've tried one of these. I kept some as they were and dipped the rest in melted bittersweet Ghirardelli chocolate, then sprinkled with a bit of sea salt on top. I used pink Himalayan sea salt since that's what I had on hand. I also used non-stick foil to line the pan rather than deal with oiling parchment paper. Worked just fine. I've made them twice to rave reviews.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious! My first try at making caramel (or candy, for that matter) and they came out beautifully. Wrapping them individually was a real pain in the rear but resulted in a lovely, homey-looking confection. They were all consumed by my ravenous family. I used regular sea salt as I didn't have any of the fancy stuff and they were still sublime. To echo other reviewers I don't think oiling the parchment is necessary--it just makes the caramels oily.

This is an easy, reliable recipe. I doubled the recipe and it came out fine. Next time, I may cook the caramel to a slightly higher temperature for a firmer candy.

Amazing! Just finished wrapping my last caramel, and I can tell they'll be a hit. I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla and a pinch (1/8 tsp? less maybe) of ground cardamom. Plus a little sprinkle of fleur de sel on top.

Super Yummy - used Golden Syrup instead of corn syrup (was all I had) and cooked the caramel (before adding the cream) to about 335. Then, added the cream and salt. I only used 1/2 teas of "real salt" pink salt and liked the saltiness - you could certainly taste it, but not too much - then added a little flaked salt to some on top. A very easy caramel to make. Great soft texture that somehow is not as sticky as most.

These are excellent. I oiled the parchment paper and regret it. They wouldn't have stuck to it and now they're a little oily. I did the lavender infusion with 2 t. lavender buds and should have used more -- maybe 1 T. I cooked it to 145 (because my pan retains heat forever) and by the time I turned off the burner, removed the spoon and thermometer and poured it, it was just right. I might go one degree higher next time, but like the soft caramel. Next time I'll brown the sugar mixture a tiny bit longer and cut back on the butter, corn syrup and water just a little. Also, if you like caramel a lot and have little impulse control, eat a big meal before making these so you don't pig out on an empty stomach like I did.

Totally awesome. Cooked to 10 degrees lower, and it worked for my 5,000 foot elevation. Many thanks for our eventual dental bill!

I've made these a number of time and they're fantastic. A few tips: nonstick foil is easier than parchment; I'm not a candy maker, so the investment in a digital thermometer really paid off for me; a double batch works well in a 9X13 pan; turn down the heat on the sugar mixture before adding the cream and try to keep it gradually increasing over the 10 minutes or so to make sure that you don't overheat it (it will be hard as a rock if you do) - watch it carefully as you hit 240 and pull it off at 246/8 and pour it out into the pan right away. As others have said- helpful to cut into pieces and put in the freezer for a few minutes before coating with chocolate.

These were super simple. My guests loved them! My only addition was 1/2 tsp of vanilla and few grains of fleur de sel on the caramels before wrapping them up. This is on my list of things to bring to parties and potlucks to wow the other guests.

I reviewed this recipe about 5 years ago, made them again yesterday and just had to review them again. Delicious!! I used Lyle's golden syrup, more depth of flavor, instead of corn syrup. Great idea,but then how to tell when the sugar is actually caramelized because it starts out amber! So I cooked the sugar until it was 280 degrees and smelled like caramel, then added the cream and cooked again until 248. Texture was perfect, great flavor. I covered the little squares with tempered chocolate and sprinkled with fleur de sel. Gorgeous and tasty! One caveat--I reduced the salt in the actual caramel to just a pinch because the salt on top of the chocolate coating was just enough. I prefer the salt on top of the caramel or chocolate because you get the flavor and the crunch. Salt on top and in the caramel would have been too much and not enough of flavor contrast. Wonderful gift when placed in little foil liners and boxed in little white boxes. People went crazy!!

Very easy recipe. I don't think it should be given a lower rating if other ingredients are being substituted or added to the recipe. I found that these caramels were very similar to ones I find in Paris. If you are having a hard time cutting the caramels into perfect squares, wave a sharp knife over the flame of your gas burner and you will be able to cut them with more ease.

Rating: 4
Oh man! This recipe couldn't have been easier to make - especially for someone who'd never made candy before. Took a lot longer than 10-15 minutes, but probably because I put the stove on 2 and just let it slowly get there. I also sprinkled more fleur de sel over the top, about ten minutes after putting it in the fridge. The hardest thing about this recipe was the cutting! I left the caramels in the fridge overnight and trying to cut them straight out of the fridge was nuts. However, after ten minutes or so it became simple, though they kept sticking. So a tip! Cut the caramel into four long strips, then put three back in the fridge on your oiled parchment. Put another piece of oiled parchment on the counter, and put each individual caramel on that as you cut them all. This allows you to easily cut and wrap them without them sticking to everything. All in all? Major hit!

This has become a favorite recipe over the last two years, but I still am challenged with the perfect consistency. Whether they are too hard, too soft, too light or too dark, they are still delicious. I follow the recipe exactly, it never quite takes a full ten minutes to reach 248, no matter how low the heat. Still trying to perfect, and having fun doing so.

I substituted hazelnut milk on a whim to see if it would work, as well as coconut nectar (as didn't have corn syrup). Also stole the lavender idea as I grow it in my yard-great idea and smelled heavenly. At first simmered as per instructions but then after 15 minutes (and no difference in the consistency) cranked it up and boiled it. Thermometer was not reaching 248 and I was worried it would burn, or that it would turn into brittle so I took it off after about 25 minutes at around 245. Poured it over walnuts and topped half with chopped Valrhona (85% cocoa). Super yummy and a soft consistency (that I wanted). Surprisingly the substitutions were o.k.

Hate spending time on candy recipes where there are miscalculations on ingredients, timing etc- but you won't find a mistake in this recipe. So glad I made this one instead of the original recipe where there were some poor reviews. Oh, and I did take it off the burner at 247 degrees, and poured the mixture right away. Its my experience that it will continue cooking if you let it sit even for a minute or so.

This is an excellent recipe and not too difficult to do. I used golden syrup since I had some and used my instant read thermometer to watch the temperature. The highest reading I saw was 220 degrees and I simmered/boiled the mixture for about 25 minutes. The caramels are a little harder than I would have preferred but very tasty.

Incredible recipe!!! I double the recipe, using only 1/2 the salt in the mixture, and sprinkle additional salt on top. I fill the lined pan with macadamia nuts, and pour the caramel over top. I boil to 242 degrees, but I think that my thermometer may not be accurate, so you may want to follow the recipe the first time, and use a lower temperature if your caramels are too hard.

I made these caramels for a friend's birthday and she and all the guests raved about them. This was the first time I have ever made caramel and it was very easy!

PERFECT. I was so nervous about making candy for the first time but it was unnecessary! I couldn't find the candy thermometer so I used an instant read meat one, and it worked fine. Took the pot off at 248 exactly, chilled, and then I took a few hints from the Ina Garten version and rolled them up and sprinkled them with salt. They are amazing!

These are fantastic! I've never made candy before. I followed the recipe exactly, except I accidentally allowed it to reach 250 degrees. They are still very tender and perfect. I also had to stop boiling the sugar in the middle, and it doesn't seem to have had any effect. Yum.

This recipe is amazing. It did take me a few tries to get the right ending temperature (246). I think I made this 5 times during the holidays and am going to make some more today for a gift. I would say the best advice I have is use as low of heat as possible and take your time. I'm not a very patient cook but I promise the reward of having perfect caramels is worth it! I might start experimenting with some new salt types too. Today's batch may get a sprinkling of red Hawaiian sea salt to finish! Oh and something else I tried when I knew some of them were going to get eaten the same day was a topped them with a few extra crispy bacon crumbles for a salty-sweet bite. Delish!

Easier to make than most caramels, and they got rave reviews! I don't have a candy thermometer so I just did the cold water test periodically until they were the consistency I wanted. Had no parchment paper so I used tinfoil and forgot to grease it-- BAD IDEA, spent half an hour digging out little shards of foil. Dipped in some dark chocolate and sprinkled with more salt, these are a great gift!

I wasn't overtly pleased with the outcome of this recipe. My caramels were greasy & too runny. I read through the reviews & someone suggested using Golden Lyle's instead of corn syrup. This would have been a great sub if I could have figured out when to stop cooking the mixture to achieve the deep golden color. Maybe I'll give this a whirl again, but it's highly unlikely.

Have made caramels before with success. Had to make 3 batches to get these right (too hard first 2 times). Thought my thermometer was off so bought a 2nd one and they both read the same. So on the 3rd batch I took them off a little before 248 degrees which seemed just right. Could it be the humidity or lack there of that makes the difference? Others readers seemed to have no difficulty. Regardless, they have a wonderful flavor!! Dipped the last batch half-way in bittersweet chocolate and sprinkled w/ grey sea salt. Yum!

I found this recipe from the Foodnetwork site--theirs was wrong and some kind reviewer sent a link to this one. I won't go into the disaster I had with the other recipe, but when I tried this one, it came out perfectly. I have made caramel maybe three times in my life, and I loved this. I did not have fleur de sel, but I used a little less kosher salt. I'm sure the fleur de sel is wonderful, and when I'm flush with money I will buy some and try it. One thing about adding the cream mixture: I found that whisking it in super slowly kept it from bubbling up too much. Also, the first time I made it, I used too deep a saucepan and my thermometer could not get an accurate temp (but at least now I know how to make toffee), so use a saucepan that's not too deep for your thermometer. This time around, as soon as the sugar started to look just a hint golden, I put the cream in. The last time I waited 5 seconds too long and it burned. In all, if this is a great recipe. My family loved it and they are huge critics. I will definitely try this again.

This recipe is absolutely delicious and, in my experience making it, perfect as written. I didn't find the caramels to be as fussy, temperature-wise, as some of the other reviewers. The first time I made them I somehow let them get to 251 degrees, and while they turned out a bit firmer than I would've liked, they were by no means too hard to cut or eat, and softened quickly upon popping one in my mouth. I took the second batch off the heat at exactly 248 degrees, and after the recommended 2-hour cooling period, they were a wonderful texture--firm enough to hold their shape and provide just a bit of resistance, but blissfully soft and just a bit chewy. The flavor of both batches was heavenly (I used organic cream & butter-yum!)--even my mother, who usually doesn't like caramel, loved them! All in all I found this recipe to be easy & reliable--definitely one for the permanent file!

These are wonderful caramels, and although I admit I had a few challenges, I will definitely make them again. Batch #1, no candy thermometer, timed the simmering of cream and sugar mixture, with results of a too, too soft caramel that defied wrapping, stuck flat as a pancake to the wax paper when unwrapped and had to be scraped off to be eaten. Taste was fabulous. Batch #2, used candy thermometer, took it off at the appointed time but worried that the heat was too high, with results of a hard mass that was impossible to cut much less eat. Batch #3, took forever to get to the right temp, resisted turning up the heat, eventually ditched the candy thermometer and took off heat after stirring for quite a while, with results of a soft caramel that was more stable after being wrapped. No sticking, spread a little after being wrapped, resulting in a charming kind of flat rectangular caramel. Taste was fabulous. Shared them at work and received the following comments from a number of people: "They are to die for!, Where did you buy them?, I didn't get one!, Why didn't you bring more?, and They are the best caramels I've ever tasted!" I can't wait to make them again after the holidays. I'm going to get good at this, try to manage double batches, experiment with adding nuts and flavorings, etc. One tip: I found the wrapping easier if I laid the caramel at the edge of the wax paper and wrapped over twice. After twisting, I trimmed the ends so they were a little more even on each side of the caramel which made them more pleasing to me. I liked using wax paper since the caramel looks nice showing through, but would like to try some tissue paper over the wax paper next time for a festive look. Thanks for reading!

These are outstanding. I have made 3 batches in the last 5 days and have plans to make the next batch tonight. What a delicious, elegant gift. I don't know if my thermometer is off, but I need to stop the cooking at 140F. I sprinkled them with just a bit more salt, just after pouring, while the caramel is still hot, otherwise the salt rolls off. I also found that I need to cut the caramels while they were still a little warm (approx 30 min after resting), otherwise they crack and I didn't always get those perfect little squares. Not a big deal because they're so darn delicious!

I've made this twice and it is super easy, especially if you are already familiar with how to cook sugar into caramel. I didn't have Fleur de sel, so I used slightly less than 1 tsp of kosher instead. Simply delicious! The finished product wrapped in the wax paper has an elegant classic look. Makes a great gift. In order to speed up the cooling process, I put the caramel in the freezer for a while at the end. This also made it much easier to cut. Try it!

@ cherrygal- the caramel gets harder the longer it cooks (the higher the temperature is) you can test the consistency of the caramel by dripping some into ice water....you can stop cooking it whenever it has reached the consistency you are looking for. i've used this recipe to make caramel sauce for ice cream and hot chocolate and that's how i figured out when it was "done"

These turned out fantastic for me! Absolutely delicious and not hard to make. I substituted ground sea salt for the Fleur de Sel just because it was out of my budget, and I didn't miss it. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter. I didn't have any trouble with them setting up properly in 2 hours. Yummy. They were so good, I'm going to make a second batch today!

Lovely caramel with a great depth and nice butteriness. I added a little buttery flake salt to the top and might have enjoyed even more. The caramel did break during cooling, probably because it came in contact with some unmelted sugar, but I was able to easily fix it by whisking the broken caramel into 1/8 cup of heated heavy cream. I also find that at high altitude (Denver is a mile above sea level) the temperature can be misleading. Putting a drop of caramel on an ice cube and testing firmness was a more accurate indicator of the doneness of the caramel.

Rating: 2
Yes, they are good, but I would say mine came out closer to butterscotch than caramel. It took 45 minutes to get the temp up to 248 and, BTW, there is no "simmer" to this stage at all... the concoction must continuously cook at a frothy boil. Also, it's quite an investment of time to individually wrap each candy. I spent the entire day at this endeavor... I don't see myself doing it again.

I plan on using this recipe to make a filling for pecan linzer cookies. Has anyone tried this? What do I need to do to make sure the caramel stays soft enough to spread between two cookies? Any tips appreciated! Thanks.

To answer the question "why is the corn syrup added": as it is a different type of sugar it keeps the product stable while heating up. If even the tiniest uncooked crystal of sugar get into the mix after a certain stage it will "break" just like a cream sauce, except It will not be recoverable. If you read old recipes for even the simplest of syrups, they instruct you to use a brush & a small dish of water to wash down the sides of the pot as it heats up. With the corn syrup you can set your fears aside, I'm pretty sure Shirley Corriher cover this in her first book & Alton Brown does a better job than I. CD NYC

Just tasted these and they are so rich and delicious. I pulled the caramel off right at 247-248 and they turned out perfect. I doubled the entire recipe, used salted butter, added an extra half teaspoon of fleur de sel, and then added 2 teaspoons of vanilla (just 1 t if doing the single recipe) when I pulled it off the heat. The color is beautiful. I refrigerated them before I cut them into small squares. Tomorrow I am going to try dipping half of them in bittersweet chocolate. I plan on wrapping them individually and giving them as Christmas gifts.

This recipe is PURE GOLD just as it is. Be sure to use Fleur de Sel. I experimented with finishing salts from all over the world and Fleur de Sel really is the best one for these caramels - as well as many other foods. It may be a little more expensive but well worth it and a little goes a long way. I also made this recipe multiple times with and without variations, i.e. adding nuts, or my second favorite (next to the original recipe) - cutting into small squares, refrigerating then dipping in chocolate before sprinkling the salt. They all turned out very well, but none of my variations were as good as the simple, pure, salted caramels - just as written.

I love the shortcut in this recipe, it really makes a classic so much easier to do. I only added a portion of the salt to the mix, and had the rest handy to sprinkle on top, because I do love that contrast. I also like to turn the heat way down on my sugar as it just starts to color (before mixing with the cream), this slows it down and allows me to get just the right color without it going too dark. I also pull the candy off the heat about 2-4 degrees sooner, so that they are a slightly softer texture.

Nice flavor, great texture, not overly simple. Really really nice. Darn good place to start. I left the corn syrup out of my first batch, I can't for the life of me figure out why it's there in this recipe, or many others. The butter leaves a velvety finish, and eases release from the parchment, but I'm going to attempt to cut it a bit. Super great.

This is a fantastic and easy recipe. You need to stay in the kitchen while making it, but it's worth it. The hardest part is waiting the 2 hours to chill before you cut them! I've seen a few versions of this on other sites, but this is the one to use. They are incredible!

1st try: I made it with Grey Sea Salt & Golden Syrup (a corn free substitue for corn syrup.)I pulled them off when the temp reached 140. They were tasted very good, but a bit on the hard side. 2nd try: I made it with Flur de Sel, Corn Syrup and 1 tsp of vanilla. Again I pulled it off at 140 degrees. The caramels were softer than the first batch but still too chewy in my oppinion. Next time I'll try pulling them off at 138 degrees. Even so they were easy to make and very tasty.

I made two double batches of these caramels, and they turned out perfectly. The only trouble I had was with trying to cut them, but I think that was my fault, as it's rather warm where I live and they kept sticking to the knife. I did let the sugar and corn syrup cook a little darker, since I like that classic burnt sugar taste of French caramels. One of the batches, I coated in 70% cocoa dark chocolate, sprinkled with a little bit of sel gris de Guerande. The other batch I left uncoated (more on that below) sprinkled with a little extra fleur de sel de Camargue, and wrapped individually. For the posters asking how you'd wrap them, what I did was cut little squares of waxed paper, about 2 1/2 times wide and 2 times as long as the caramel, and matching pieces of fancy printed tissue paper. I set the caramel in the center of the piece of waxed paper and wrapped the sides over, leaving the ends loose. Then I rolled it in the tissue paper, and twisted the ends so they look like an English Christmas cracker, or a classic candy in a paper twist. The printed tissue made it very festive. Yes, it is tedious and a lot of work, but worth it. I left the chocolate covered caramels unwrapped. I've sent several tins to my friends all around the country this past week, and everything arrived in perfect shape. This will be my once- a-year treat to send to friends from now on. They definitely travel better than cookies and are more unexpected. Not to mention they are fancier, and last longer!

These are wonderful! They have a delicious flavor. I don't have a candy thermometer, so I used the cold water test. They turned out perfect. Slightly chewy but yielding, and still perfectly firm. We used a jelly roll pan for thinner pieces, and pressed a toasted pecan half into some of them. I also only had dark corn syrup, so I couldn't tell when the sugar/corn syrup mixture turned dark. I just heated it for a while!

I've made these twice and am going to keep trying until I get them to the perfect "chew". They are a little firm and it seems that just seconds separate me from achieving the exact texture of a softer caramel.Getting them off heat at the right moment makes all the difference. The flavor is so good that even too chewy, they are amazing.

I am new to making candy, and this took me a few tries. The accuracy of your thermometer is really important, and I found that the final seconds of making this are crucial! I went over by only a few seconds and my first batch was a brittle mess that had to be thrown out. The outcome of my final batch was successful, but perhaps it was the weather here in LA that made the second half a failure. I found on my third try that instead of refrigerating it, I just let it sit out overnight. My caramels were still on the tough side. Maybe I am just doing something wrong? I sprinkled extra fleur de sel on top of my batch before cooling, and found that it all fell off while i was cutting the caramels. Any suggestion as to how this could be avoided would be helpful. I am determined to make a perfect batch, so I will try again!

Love these! I'm on my second batch for Holiday gifts. No problems with the recipe at all except on my end, I tried to cut them too soon. Waited until the next day and they cut cleanly and easily. I also used salted butter and kosher salt instead of Fleur de Sel. Next year I might dip them in chocolate!!

These caramels are wonderful!!! I get so many compliments from people when I make them. Before I wrap them in wax paper I sprinkle a little fleur de sel on the caramel for just a little added depth. People rave about them.

Danielle, I solved the sticking problem by using a sheet of silicone instead of parchment paper.

i love these. i've made several batches without a candy thermometer and they turn out perfect using the cold water trick. the only problem i have is making the parchment paper stick to my pan. it drives me CRAZY! does anyone have a good tip for me?

I haven't tried this yet but have been thinking about how to present these candies as a gift. I'm going to try cutting them into neat little squares then dip them into dark chocolate and sprinkle a few grains of fleur de sel on top since I don't want to be so fussy as to piping a design on top of the chocolate.

This was my first time making candy and it was remarkably easy. Nice consistency. It did take me longer than 15 minutes to get up to 248F but that may have been because I was so afraid of burning the bottom!

Though these tasted fantastic, they were rock hard when cooled. I managed to eat a few warm, soft pieces before tossing the hardened batch. I am sure it was my fault so I'm not going to dock the recipe any forks.

I have a question -- how do you present your caramels if you are giving them as a gift? Wrapped individually, and in what?

I've never made any sort of candy before but thought I'd give this a try since it seemed fairly easy. And I LOVED the way it turned out. I was glad I read the comments before I did it, though. I used salted butter instead of the recommended unsalted butter and it tastes really good. The only thing is that when I used the candy thermometer the temperature never got higher than 240 degrees. So I just winged it and got it off the stove after 20 minutes of cooking (longer than the 10-15 minutes). It still came out OK. Also for step 3 the mixture never turned a light golden caramel. More like a champagne color. Should I have waited longer for it to turn more caramelly? Also when I only waited an hour and a half to cut the caramels, I found they were softer. My first batch at 2 hours was a lot firmer, harder to chew.

I liked these caramels a lot, but I was hoping to be able to taste the fleur de sel and really couldn't. I actually used salted butter in the last few batches and have really gotten rave reviews!

Fantastic and easy! I cooked the caramel to a darker brown because I like the "burnt" caramel taste. Used coarse kosher salt in place of fleur de sel.

Perfect, the very first time. I, too, increased the salt. Don't scrape the pan as you are pouring out the caramel. (The "scraped-out" caramel has a tendency to turn hard.) Just pout it out & enjoy.

I've tried this recipe several times and they come out too hard! Clearly, I'm doing something wrong, but what? We've been very careful to follow the recipe exactly, including the simmer until 248 degrees. Can anyone give advise about how to make sure they stay soft enough to eat?

I have made caramels from various recipes for several Christmases now, and this recipe is a winner. I like the relatively low proportion of corn syrup to sugar (some recipes use half and half!); the difference comes out in both the flavor and texture. I made several batches of this recipe--first doubling, then tripling the recipe, and 248 degrees was just right, at least in the Bay area where I live. It holds its shape but is still soft enough. One ambiguity is when to put the warmed cream and butter in--I pour it in when the sugar mixture is 250 degrees and it turns out very well. I agree with increasing the salt to one and a half or even two teaspoons, if you're using kosher salt.

I made a double batch and I can't say enough about how simple and excellent this recipe is! I decided to sprinkle some fleur de sel on top after pouring into the pan...the salty sweetness is extraordinary!

This worked really well and they're so delicious. I did spend more time than the recipe indicated watching and swirling the sugar mixture because I was so worried about burning it.

I won the annual cookie/candy party with this winning recipe. The only thing i added was 1 tsp of vanilla during cooking and stirred in another 1/4 tsp of fleur de sel prior to pouring to the sheet.

I made these for a holiday party yesterday and everyone was raving about them. I cooked them to 246 degrees on a candy thermometer and they came out just right - chewy, but not too hard. I also used the cold water test described by other reviewers, because my thermometer is a little hard to read. When I went to drink the little bit of cream that was left of the saucepan while simmering the mixture, I realized the fleur de sel hadn't dissolved so I sprinkled extra on the caramel after I poured it into the pan and that worked fine. I would definitely make this again.

This is about as close to Recchiuti fleur de sel caramels as possible in with Midwest without paying the $20 overnight shipping from CA! I also doubled the salt by adding the additional 1t. at the very end as the caramel is cooling so the crystals don't completely dissolve, providing the occational salty crunch in the final product. I spread the carmel in a buttered sheet pan to cool at 1/3 inch thickness, chilled and cut into 1 inch squares, then dipped in Lindt 75% Equadorian Dark. The actual temp of the sugar mixture isn't as important as the slow heating to a golden caramel color providing the caramel flavor. I heated the caramel/butter/cream mixture to about 248, then confirmed with the water test that I had reached "firm ball stage" (Google that one if you don't know what I'm talking about!) Good luck!

Amazing!! Pure delicious genius. All my friends are requesting it. You can vary the flavors by adding espresso powder to the cream mixture, or vanilla beans, but extra fleur de sel is my favorite.

Rating: 4
This was my first attempt at making candy and it was incredibly easy! The entire cooking process took me only about 20 minutes. Once I put the cream mixture into the sugar, the mixture rapidly reached 248 degrees so keep a close eye on your thermometer. I used kosher salt b/c I didn't have fleur de sel on hand but can't wait to try it with the fleur de sel. Very easy to make, delicious and a big hit with everyone who tasted them.

This was a great recipe, but my caramels came out a bit too soft, maybe I didn't get the tempersture hot enough? Anyway, I cut them up, put them on a drying rack on a sheet pan and into the fridge over night to frim up a bit. While still cold, I dipped some in milk, some in semi-sweet chocolate and dusted them with fleur de sel to finish. The end product was decadent and delicious!! Really fun, great tasting result.

This recipe is simply divine! I have been trying to make soft, rich caramel candy for ages. I did add 1 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla for added richness. The fleur de sel just makes them wonderful!

Although I am a dentist, I loved making these caramels! The salt was such a nice addition. I also made a batch with a couple tablespoons of rum. Makes a nice holiday gift if wrapped with little pretty candy foils.

These caramels are so good! I brought the sugar/water to 340 degrees (marked "caramel" on my thermometer), and then added the cream. I cooked the mixture for 12 minutes at 248 and then poured it into a pan as indicated. I also used a pizza cutter to cut the cooled caramel into strips and kitchen snips to cut it into pieces. I will definately make these again!

Great! I have made this twice. The second time I doubled the recipe and threw caution to the wind. I used salted butter (what I had)and added 3/4 teaspoon regular table salt (Mortons -- no access to fleur del sel), cooked the initial sugar/water/corn syrup to 240 degrees then added the boiled cream butter mixture (to which I added 1 teaspoon vanilla...a wonderful addition)246 degrees seemed a achieve a better result than 248 as others indicated. Cutting these is a trick. I washed and sterilized my poultry scissors then cut the caramels into strips then rectangles which I then wrapped in waxed paper. Opt for smaller pieces - very rich. These are truly easy and fabulous...makes approx 80 pieces. Finally, the flavor difference in fleur del sel and table salt in this is minimal. Enjoy using what is on hand the result is great!

Based on other reviews, I decided to double the amount of salt. I was trying to imitate some commercial caramels I love, and I think 2 teaspoons reached the distinctive salt flavor I was shooting for. The recipe does not specify, but I cooked the sugar/syrup/water mixture to 360 degrees, which resulted in a nice caramel. Like another reviewer, I actually found these to be a bit on the chewy/soft side, so I plan to cook them above 248 degrees the next time I make them.

Mine turned out soft and tasty without a candy thermometer. To make sure you end up with soft caramels, fill a bowl with cold water. When you think the caramel might be done, drip some into the water. It will form a ball, which you can squish between your fingers. Stop boiling when your drips form balls that are the consistency you want your caramels. They're even better when covered in chocolate and topped with a few flakes of salt.

A great recipe. I made it once, and then made it again, and then made it a third time in the same week. Based on other reviews, I increased the salt to 1 1/2 teaspoons, and I think that was a better level of saltiness for me. The closer the temp stayed to 246, the creamier the caramels were. An oiled pizza cutter worked great to cut these.

I have made this recipe 3 times now. The first time the caramels were awesome. The next 2 times it didn't get hard. I didn't do anything different. The 3rd time I even boiled it to 250 thinking maybe that would do the trick. Good thing it makes delicious caramel topping. Does anyone have tips?

These caramels have such a delicious flavor. They have a perfect, chewy consistency if cooked to a final temperature of 246 degrees. If cooked to a full 248 they will crack when cutting them and have to be sucked on rather than chewed. I'm not sure if a cold, dry, Wisconsin climate has anything to do with the need to change the final temperature, but other than that - they are perfect. I have sometimes cooked them only to 244, which leaves them quite soft and chewy and then dipped them in chocolate. It is more work, but an impressive final candy.

Wow, I was sure I'd screw these up--yet they were absolutely delicious. A few recommendations: cut them into smaller pieces (more like half to two-thirds of an inch square) so tasters don't get overwhelmed. Use the best quality cream and butter you can. And when it came to the (last) cooking step, I had to really boil the mixture, not simmer it, to get it to 248 degrees. Despite being time consuming (probably two hours of work total), everyone raved!

Loved this recipe, but would also add more salt for a more pronounced salty flavor. The contrast between the sweet and salty is so wonderful. Arvada Cook - at altitude, you should reduce the temp of the mixture by two degrees for every 1,000 ft - so we Front Range folks would take the mixture to about 238 degrees. This is probably why your caramels came out a bit hard.

I liked the rich, mellow taste of these candies, but mine came out very hard -- I read the other two reviews with interest, but not being familiar with Fran's candies, I don't know what to think. Perhaps I am not familiar enough with cooking caramel and simmered the mixture for too long.

These are amazing. And really easy. Dipped in chocolate and sprinkled with more fleur de sel they would be just like the heavenly Fran's Chocolates.
