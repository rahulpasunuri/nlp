Why the cream? Didn'mix at all. Would have been fine without it.

This is simply delicious--and easy! I skipped the jalapeno because I don't like them. Without, the dish is not very spicy--more creamy and flavorful. Don't add the actual clams till the end--they get tough quickly. Great for a romantic dinner!

Wow, great, easy, every one loves it!I fried in olive oil, several shrimp and added them just before serving, I also doubled the amount of jalapeno. Superb!

Very good receipe. Used Trader Joe's canned clams, they were excellent. Make sure you boil down your cream enough to get a thick sauce. Excellent!! Also used Asiago cheese grated on top, very nice touch to round out the meal!!

This recipe was very good, just be sure to boil down the cream enough so it gets thick. I used crushed red pepper ( I had no hot peppers on hand) I bought clams from Trader Joes, they were excellent. Good receipe!!

I have made this many times-easy and excellent. But I'm not a basil fan and use lots of parsley instead. Liking it spicy, in additition to the jalapenos, I add cayenne and red pepper to taste. You get a really complex flavor. In addition I add a little white wine, butter, and lots of cheese. (I use a three cheese grated combo) All I can say is that it's better than any dish I have had in any restaurant, and I have been to quite a few.

This was great, and so easy! I added diced red bell pepper with the onions, and it turned out fantastic. This recipe is a keeper.

We just love this dish! I'm sure all the extra's reviewers have mentioned are a great addition, but, we like it so much just the way it is, that I wouldn't dream of making any changes!

My husband and I love this dish. It can be made in a flash. I usually add 10 minutes or so to the reduction time and we also use 2 or more peppers for a bit more kick. Being from an area that takes our sweet onions very seriously, we wouldn't dream of leaving them out as suggested by the previous cook. Overall a great recipe!

I gave this recipe 3 forks with reservations, mainly because I made several changes to improve it, as did other reviewers. Anyone making white clam sauce would do well to heed the advice of Katlee from Eugene, OR, on 05/05/00 in a review of "Linguine with Clam Sauce" on this site. I'm a cream lover, but not in white clam sauce. Canned clams and their juices lack the distinctive brininess of fresh clams, and therefore cream or thickener of any kind dilutes the clam taste even further. Also, I rarely add onions, only occasionally a few scallions sauteed with the garlic. I use both butter and olive oil, a little white wine or dry vermouth, and a generous pinch of Italian seasoning and hot pepper flakes. Having said that, the addition of both basil (but add some fresh parsley, too) and jalapeno pepper was a good idea for this particular recipe.

Here in the land of green chile, I took the liberty of substituting a can of green chile for the jalapeno which gives it a more subtle flavor. I also added some cayenne pepper on the top and it came out quite nicely.

I made a satisfying one dish meal for two following this basic formula. I added a chopped zucchini and sliced fennel bulb at the end of the saute (that's what was on hand). For 1 can clams and juice, I used 1/3 cup cream. When the cream was reduced, about 5 minutes using a wide saute pan, I added juice of half a lemon, a diced tomato, and a few spoons of grated parmesan cheese. Half a seeded jalapeno only gave a subtle spiciness (I should have used the whole thing), so I added a bit on cayenne pepper. didn't have basil, so I used parsley and cilantro. Quick, fast, and fresh--I'll make it again.

An excellent recipe after I doctored it up. Needed more pep, so I added ground red pepper, garlic powder and aromat seasoning (salt blend). To finish it off I added fresh chopped parsley and I received rave reviews from the fellas. Will make again definately.

Although I found the dish flavorful, I was very disappointed. I don't know why it is called "spicy" clam sauce for it really was quite bland. I added some white wine and extra jalepinos as suggested and the sauce was turned out well as far as it texture. It did not taste the least bit " fishy" and that was a plus.

This recipe was Fabulous! I definitely took some advice from other reviewers on adding more jalapeno peppers. What the recipe called for was very mild. You will also need to increase the reduction time of your sauce to 10-12 min. I even added a little cornstarch to thicken it. This recipe is very easy and quick to make.

This was great clam sauce! I used a whole (seeded) jalepeno and found it wasn't hot at all. The flavours, however were fantastic. I added some white wine and increased the reduction time. Next time I will probably use 3-4 jalepenos. I think they lose their kick after cooking. This was good and REALLY fast to make.

Fabulous and easy dish! I added a little Parmesan or Romano cheese at the end.

I found the recipe to be quite good. However, I did not find the dish spicy at all. The recipe needs A LOT more jalapeno peppers to make it spicy. The fresh basil and onions are the ingredients that make the dish unique. Definitely give it a try!

Fantastic! Didn't know what jalapeno hash was, so i used a few (not much!) pickled jalapenos and dried jalapeno. Far better than linguini with white clam sauce.

Perfection! And could not be any easier to make. Don't let the jalapeno scare you away--without the seeds, it isn't hot; it just adds another subtle layer of flavor. Definately add at least 10 minutes to the reduction time.

This dish was fabulous! (And my boyfriend thought he didn't like clam sauce...) I used half & half instead of whipping cream, reduced it longer as others suggested and sprinkled fresh parmesean on top. Guess who eats clam sauce now! Next time I think I'll add a bit more jalapeno for a slightly bolder taste.

A nice twist to a classic white clam sauce dish and simple to make. Agree with cook from Walnut Creek; increase reduction time an addt'l 10 minutes. Serve with shaved Parmesan Reggiano and a fresh loaf of warmed crusty bread...hits the spot! We even had steamed artichokes w/drawn butter on the side-Yes, we can eat!

As a connoisseur of this menu item, (I often order it at a restaurant) this is exactly what I have been searching for for years. I reduced the sauce more than 10 minutes because I wanted it to be thicker and it was great.

I was disappointed in this recipe. It didn't have as much "oomph" as I would like. I added some white wine to sauce, but did little. It was OK but nothing spectacular

My husband requested linguine with clam sauce (his favorite dish)for his birthday dinner, so I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. We loved it! In fact, my husband said it is the best he's ever had (which is amazing since he does not praise lightly, plus he travels a lot and has orders this dish everywhere he goes). The fresh basil and jalapeno pepper gives it just the right kick. Try it, you'll like it.

I was e-mailed this recipe from a complete stranger named Chris who read my review of Linguine with white clam sauce & thought I should try this. I did and man was it awesome. Very quick to prepare & positively a delight for the taste buds; excellent flavor & creaminess. Definatly a keeper!!
