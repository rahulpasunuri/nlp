I used the 1/4 cup broth and it was enough--there's no need to have it swimming in sauce, although I didn't bother with cornstarch. Also cut the amount of soy sauce and didn't poach the tofu. And shuffled the order of cooking a bit to fit my idea of how much cooking each ingredient requires. I've made ma po many times with other recipes or more often just off the top of my head, and the tofu comes out fine without poaching. Toasting intensified the flavor of the (freshly ground) sichuan peppercorns (you can get them from Penzey's). I like hot, so added some sliced serranos--next time even more. Also added some peas and minced onion, considered but didn't add bell pepper. Maybe the extra veggies makes it less authentic, but this dish copes well with such changes.

oh yeah, and add more broth, most ma po tofus are swimming in a spicy broth, not a thickly-sauced stir fry like this would end up being.....

just a quick clarification.... there are many references to the spice level or lack thereof in this dish and the blame has been leveled in many cases towards the presence of the sichuan peppercorn powder or lack thereof...... sichuan peppercorns aren't spicy.... if you want more spice, fry up some dried chili peppers at the beginning of the recipe in the oil or throw in some fresh green or red chilis as it's cooking..... sichuan peppercorns actually numb the tongue and add a really unique flavor to the dish.... this is an authentic recipe, but skip the poaching of the tofu and kick it up a notch-- the only caveat is that some spicy bean pastes are spicier than others, so be careful before you load it with chilis.....

I love this recipe. It's definitely a keeper, although I did find it too salty, so I added at least another 1 1/2 cups of water and omitted salt. I'm not sure if I used the right paste, but I used Lee Kum Kee's Chili Bean Sauce and it came out delicious. Thanks for sharing.

Very easy recipe. I didnt feel like only using 1/2 lb pork so I used the full pound of pork. It came out a little to strong on the soy sauce but very good. next time I think I'll add some crunchy lettuce on top.

Great ma-po tofu recipe that was easy to make, even in my tiny kitchenette. I made some minor changes for convenience reasons, but I think the recipe would have been excellent if followed exactly. It's forgiving in that you can add a little extra garlic/ginger/scallion, etc. and the result is still delicious! The changes I made: -Did not add any kosher salt (hot fermented bean paste is already very salty) -Used a slightly larger container of soft tofu (20 oz) -Used 3/4 cup homemade beef stock (per other reviews, I think 1 cup of broth/stock would have been even better) -Omitted peppercorn powder because I couldn't find it. The dish was still spicy enough for me though given the chili in the bean paste.

Totally forgot about the sesame oil, couldn't find the Sichaun-peppercorn powder or ground pork shoulder, so I switched to turkey. I also added some broccoli because I had it lying around. Still so good, it's really easy and highly recommended. I

this was amazing and i had to make two very weird substitutions: ground buffalo for the pork (not actually that big a deal  think you can easily use any ground meat) and i discovered late game that i didnt have black bean paste. i used chinese red chili paste which really isnt similar at all, but guess what? it was still awesome. next time, ill do it right on the black bean paste, but using any meat is fine.

Surprisingly delicious and super simple - a perfect, quick weeknight meal. I followed the advice of other reviewers and used much more chicken broth than called for - probably 2.5 cups total. The sauce is so delicious, you'll want more of it. I also used ground beef, a full pound instead of a half pound. Completely forgot the sesame oil but I don't think the dish suffered for it. My black bean paste wasn't the hot type so I added sambal oelek to make up for the lack of heat. Served with brown rice and steamed broccoli. I will make this again and again!

I've been making this a while and it's really a great dish...as good as it gets! My tips: * Get the correct kind of bean paste - very delicious... * Use Sichuan peppercorns * If you can't find the above, have someone in Seattle send it to you or go on the internet * DOUBLE the amount of sauce you make * Don't poach tofu * Any ground pork will do

FYI, I have made this recipe a zillion times with 1/4 C chicken broth and it comes out perfectly.

What a delicious and quick weeknight meal! The ma-po tofu had an intensely meaty flavor despite the fact that I subbed ground turkey for the pork. The chili black bean paste was very hot thus I was afraid the finished dish would be so as well, however it was perfectly spiced. The steps seemed a little daunting at first but in 20 minutes I had this dish together. I used my processor to chop the ginger and garlic. The (firm) tofu only simmered for 5 or so minutes, but was exceptionally tender when cooked. I loved everything about this dish...the time, the ease and most importantly, the flavor! I look forward to serving this to others.

I have been playing with this receipe for a while.. I coat the tofu with corn starch and fry that first.. then go one with basically the same ingredients.. I add snow peas and mushrooms. and I add heat.. like sirachi sauce... my family loves it!

Rating: 0
Yum! This was easy, unusual, and tasty. I used slightly more than 1 tsp peppercorn powder and would probably go a bit lighter next time. I also couldn't find hot bean paste and substituted a heaping tablespoon of sambal oelek. I'll definitely try it again following the actual recipe. Oh, and I used about a cup of chicken broth instead of 1/4 cup.

I love MaPo Tofu and wanted to learn how to make the sauce, particularly because I find this dish varies wildly by each restaurant in which I order it. The first time I made this I followed the directions exactly, except I couldn't find a jar that was labeled "hot bean paste" so I substituted "black bean paste." It came out VERY tasty but not the right flavor. Then I searched the Lee Kum Kee brand website and discovered they make "Spicy Bean Sauce: Ma Po Sauce." It's part of their "one- step recipe sauces" collection. While the brand is common to my local grocery stores, this sauce is not. I had to shop at a local Asian market to find it. The meal was much closer to what you find in a restaurant though the purchased sauce is salty and has a slightly odd after taste. That time round I didn't add the extra flavors (broth, soy, garlic, ginger, powder) to it because it's meant to be the complete sauce in a jar. It made a quick and tasty dish - just cook the pork and add in tofu and green onion. I guess my third time round I'll have to try the sauce recommended with 2 TBSP of the Lee Kum Kee sauce. By the way, didn't poach the tofu either time and it came out fine.

This is very delicious. There is one error in the quantity of chicken broth listed. This recipe calls for just 1/4 cup. It should be 1-1/4 cup. This then comes out perfect.

Rating: 1
This recipe as printed here is incorrect. The amount of chicken broth listed in this recipe in The Gourmet Cookbook is 3/4 cup. And when you make it with only 1/4 cup, as I did tonight, you will see why! I have written to Epicurious but in the meantime, BEWARE! I will re-rate this after I make it with the correct amount of broth.

SO GOOD. I've made this a few times, including once for friends who promptly became obsessed with the recipe and cooked it almost nightly for weeks thereafter. The hot bean paste is key (although she said she subbed plain old chili paste with decent results); so is the pork. I too skipped the step of simmering the tofu since I use a really high-quality local-ish brand I love; I omitted the added salt and have replaced the broth with water several times. I often add cilantro and sometimes white pepper at the end and will try adding frozen peas when I make it tonight. This stuff is seriously addictive, even to those who aren't usually too keen on spicy foods.

Rating: 4
This is really good. I made a few minor changes: upped the amount of sauce by about 50% (I thought it was a little dry), I didn't bother simmering the tofu, and I added a lot of green onions cut into 1" pieces when I stir-fried the pork. Turned out excellent.

This is the only way I enjoy tofu.Like many others, I skipped the salt. I also omitted the pork to make a vegetarian dish. Instead I added some frozen peas at the end of cooking. The texure and fresh flavour they added was wonderful. Served it with steamed rice and gai lan. Yummy meal.

followed ckyelland = Used ground turkey breast in place of pork. Omitted salt. Garlic chili sauce [tuong ot toi viet-nam] instead of hot bean paste. Used LOADS of fresh garlic and ginger. Addded chopped Bok Choy at the end. Served over rice noodles. Found it required more chichen stock. LOVED IT!!! In addition I would add some chopped water chestnut for texture and at the end dust top with chopped peanuts. Chopped shrimp could sub for the tofu for a different effect.

This is one of my favorite recipes I have pulled from Epicurious. So easy, so good, and relatively healthy aside from the sodium content. I used ground turkey, garlic chile paste, extra ginger, and omitted the salt from the sauce - you won't need it. I threw in a bunch of chopped bok choy at the very end and served it with brown rice. The only oil you really need is just enough to brown the meat. Wonderful.

Excellent recipe... people should really disregard reviews that have absurd substitutions and then complain about the end result (e.g. pork chop instead of ground pork). As written, this is a fabulous recipe that also happens to be very authentic and easy to prepare.

It was good, but nothing exceptional. I used no extra salt and as little oil as possible. I also changed ground pork to pork chops diced. It made it more interesting with the tofu. I didn't use peppercorn powder because I didn't have it. Honestly, having the leftovers for lunch the next day was better than the night I made it. I think marinading the tofu would be a good idea.

I agree with the cook from Fresno, CA - this was a very quick and easy meal. I also skipped the salt, lessened the peanut oil (I didn't add it the second time it calls for it), doubled the ginger and garlic, and added more scallions at the end too. I used the Lee Kum brand Chili Bean Sauce (as the hot bean paste) which had the perfect amount of spice. It's a bit greasy for my taste, but my husband LOVED it. It tastes and looks like something that would come from a Chinese restaurant - VERY authentic!

Very easy and quick week night meal. Skipped salt, used more garlic and ginger than called for and didn't have hot black bean sauce on hand so I used black bean garlic sauce. I've made different versions of this dish, but my (Chinese) husband liked this best. Almost skipped poaching the tofu, but I think it made a nice difference, so I'm glad I didn't skip that step!

delush! next time i'll skip the poaching and peppercorn powder as it didn't add to the dish.. doubled the garlic and ginger and cut the pork down to 1/3 lb... also skipped the salt and used low sodium soy sauce... great dish!

Great recipe. For those searching for the right ingredients, the pepper I used was called Chinese Pepper Powder and the hot bean paste was called Chili Bean Sauce (Lee Kum Kee brand, has a Ma-Po Tofu recipe on the jar).

Doesn't have the fire or the sweetness I love in Asian food--and is a little too gummy for those of us who don't love that texture. I also am not a fan of recipes which require difficult-to-find-but-essential ingredients (like toasted Sichuan peppercorn powder or hot bean paste, neither of which is to be found outside a specialty market). Not a bad dish but I am sure there are better versions.

This is my absolutely favorite tofu dish. I always poach the tofu mainly because my aunt (Japanese American) who spent a lot of time in pre-War Japan always poached tofu before serving. It may be more important to do so when you are serving tofu cold (we eat it with soy sauce, grated fresh ginger, and chopped green onions)than when it is being cooked, as in this recipe.

Deelish! I left out the chicken broth and just used water as I found the recipe fairly salty. I am asian in origin, and pre poaching the tofu is traditional; it does make it more silky and a nicer texture. I found there was no need to simmer for more than 2-3 min., just to thicken sauce. Fast and yummy.

This recipe is great. It's easy and delicious. We found it a bit hot - although that may have been the particular brand of bean paste with chilis that I used - as I suspect. I adjusted the heat by using 1 T. of the bean paste with chili peppers and 1T. with garlic and omitted any other hot ingredient That made it just right. I think poaching the tofu is really great. I've been making it at least once a week - a real favorite.

We first made this dish about 3 years ago and it has since become almost a weekly staple in our household. It is so tasty, easy and fast. And I agree that poaching the tofu is totally unnecessary. We serve it with some gai lan or sugar snap peas braised with oyster sauce. If you're debating whether to make this or not, make it! You won't be disappointed.

This dish is easy to make, I did make a few modifications. To save time, I skipped the "poaching tofu" step. I didn't add the kosher salt, I thought it would be too salty with it. I didn't have any sichuan seasoning, so I threw in 2 chopped thai chilies. I substituted the pork for Boca soy crumbles to make it vegetarian and also used veg broth. So, in the end I deviated a bit from the recipe, but it was still delicious! Both my husband and I really enjoyed it.

Actually 3.5 forks. My boyfriend said, "Fantastic! Please make this again for me." Didn't add any salt to the hot bean paste sauce. Didn't have any Sichuan peppercorn powder. Doubled the hot bean paste sauce, but didn't double anything else. Next time, I'll add peas.

This is a dish that is wonderfully delicious - I look forward to preparing it for company. I added a splash of fresh lime juice but did not have the special ingredient, Szechaun peppercorns - so that may be why it needed a little piquant kick - I thaught it worked well. Mo-Po Tofu -It's too sexy for it's name!

Having recently become vegan (for Lent) I did a search on tofu and this recipe came up. It sounded good and I made it (without the pork, of course)and didn't bother with steaming the tofu first. On the contrary, I sautéed it so tasted more like meat. It's an absolutely delicious recipe, and very fast to prepare! My grown kids dropped in and were amazed by the aroma in the house!

Very good, very authentic, tastes even better than my dad's! Agree with "Chinese descendents", didn't see the need for poaching the tofu, especially since I'm lazy. If you can handle it, this tastes best kicked up a notch, but is also good with no hot sauces (black bean, or Sichuan peppercorn). This recipe won over a non-tofu eater!

I love this spicy, flavorful tofu dish. I have made it many times, even people who "hate tofu" like it. I think the unique spiciness of the Sichuan peppercorn is key. It's important to use an excellent hot bean paste--Lee Kum Kee is a good brand (I used a different, cheaper brand once and had very mediocre results). I also don't poach the tofu, just use very fresh tofu and it's great.

poaching is great especially from older tofu. I let the tofu cook a little with the pork and spices before thickening so that the flavours sink in. Also added frozen green peas, and white pepper instead of sichuan..delicious.
