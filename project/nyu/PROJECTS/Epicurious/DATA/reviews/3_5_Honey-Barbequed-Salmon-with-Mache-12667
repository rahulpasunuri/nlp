Fantastic. It makes enough sauce for many meals. We have had this many times. Easy enough for the family and unique enough for guests. Everyone raves about it. Would try to get the thinnest salmon so there is more of the BBQ sauce taste.

Everyone loved this dish. I have made it several times now and it is always a hit. The sauce kind of caramelizes the salmon skin. This is such a great sauce; I am sure it would taste good on chicken too.

This has become a staple recipe for me. The BBQ sauce is the best I've ever had, and whenever I make it I'm obliged to bottle some up in jars for my guests to take home. I've passed on the mache from time to time in favor of a large leaf of romaine.

Yummy! This is the perfect Honey BBQ sauce. It is light, sweet and not to overpowering. I doubled the soy and added another splash of Worcestershire, changes I thought necessary. Try it as is; this is a great summer recipe for that fresh caught salmon. Enjoy!

This was so good. I took a reviewers suggestion and coated both sides of the salmon with the sauce and let it marinate about 2 hours before grilling. Then basted with the sauce while grilling it was sooo good. Served 8 pounds of salmon to a large dinner party.

I was really disappointed. Even though there were a number of ingredients in the sauce, the flavor of the ketchup still stuck out.

This uses a lot in ingredients for just a so so sauce. I've got an easier one that's also tastier.

This is the best Salmon recipe yet. I can't even order Salmon at a restaurant anymore because I prefer this glaze and haven't tasted anything better. Even my two picky children (6 and 8) will eat this and ask for seconds. I make a double batch of the glaze and keep it in the fridge for the next week. I have made this dish for years and never tire of it.

This recipe is ok, nothing special. May try it on chicken next time. Only made the sauce for the salmon & also some shrimp. Didn't have fresh japs, so used pickled & worked out fine. Served it w/corn grilled in the husk.

Took a previous reviewer's advice and made the sauce for chicken instead of salmon. I marinated the chicken pieces in the sauce for half an hour at room temperature before baking them at 350 in a Pyrex baking dish. I followed the sauce recipe exactly (skipped the dressing part) and my family loved it. I'm looking forward to trying the entire recipe as written.

On the advice of the other reviewers I used tomato passata instead of ketchup and used half the honey. I also omitted the sugar entirely. The result was absolutely delicious and I will definitely make again.

sauce is fine, but nothing to get excited about. the sauce is better suited to chicken. it overwhelms the salmon.

really easy to make, but the honey BBQ sauce was almost just a touch too sweet. would suggest cutting back a little on the honey.

Rating: 4
Absolutely a staple sauce! I also split the honey with maple syrup to total 3/4 cup. I only added about 1 1/2 T dark brown sugar, and I also used crushed tomatoes in place of the ketchup, which also cut down on the sweetness. Served the salmon with a mesclun mix salad w/ pickled red onions, fresh tomato, herb feta cheese and maple balsamic viniagrette. We also threw some marinated fennel bulbs on the grill, and served roasted brussel sprouts with garlic scapes. Delish!

It's that time of the year, colleage tour time, so when young palattes come for an Ivy League visit, and you want to make sure the entire table will enjoy the meal, this recipe works. It isn't a sophisticated taste (too sweet for me) but everyone commented on it, and my husband asked me to make it again. Go figure! By the way, salmon is running right now, so it's a good time to make this dish.

Made half the salmon recipe, but only used 1/4 cup honey. Also didn't have a jalepeno, so added in some red pepper flakes. Last night we had it on salmon, tonight on chicken. Divine both times - and easy, easy, easy. Of course, I did have to pull out everything in my pantry, but that's part of what makes it fun!

Very good, albeit a bit sweet. I followed previous recommendations and went half honey/half maple syrup but it was still too much. Maybe more like 1/2 cup of sweetener next time. Makes an enormous amount of sauce. I generously covered a large salmon filet (4 lbs) and slathered on more after I baked it and still there is enough left for a whole chicken.

This was excellent! I normally avoided salmon, as it often tasted too fishy. I soaked the salmon filets in milk for about one minute before marinating. I also followed the advice of one of the reviewers, and used one-half cup of pure maple syrup and one-half cup of honey, instead of one cup of honey. I also cooked it a trifle longer than the instructions, as I like my fish cooked to medium. I used apple wood chips on my grill that had been soaked in water for 10 minutes to increase the cooking flavor. I would like to hear the side dishes our reviewers prepared with this dish. I made mashed sweet potatoes and a salad with a maple dressing.

This was fantastic! At first I thought it didn't sound like a salmon-type sauce, but the previous reviews convinced me to try it. It was great! I'm using the leftover sauce on some chicken tonight. I halved the recipe and it made enough for a 1.5 lb salmon fillet with enough left for 4 chicken breasts.

The more subtle ingredients in this sauce are overwhelmed by the pint of ketchup and honey. This is still a keeper, but I think the Salmon Black Butter recipe is more subtle.

Yes! This recipe has the unqualified thumbs up from "Gossip & Gourmet" my book-group (monthly meetings = 5 minutes discussing the book we've read, 3 hours preparing and devouring a totally magnificent meal!) I eliminated the jalapenos on request, but still think they would provide a needed "kick"... however even without them, the glaze was just fantastic. One other change---used half maple syrup half honey. Salmon was grilled to perfection, JUST barely still raw in the very center... and... instead of the "lamb's lettuce" i served it with/on Homewood Gourmet's (Birmingham, Alabama) "Baby Blue Salad", spring greens with honey balsamic dressing, sugared pecans, blue cheese, oranges and strawberry slices. Roasted beets, fresh green beans, homemade french bread.... trifle for dessert. A(nother) totally magnificent meal.

I've prepared this dish a number of times now and always get wonderful comments. The kids like it too! I was unable to find mache, so I substituted bibb lettuce and some chopped tomato and it tasted great.

My 11 year old hates salmon, except this salmon. When I make it she can't eat enough of it. I bake the fish (with the sauce) in the oven, rather than grilling, to rave reviews.

I own a catering company and have prepared this dish for two clients in the last month. It is easy to make and everyone loves it! It works as well for groups of 100+ as it does for a dinner for four. We have served the salmon on a bed of caramelized onions instead of the greens and it is great. It tastes great chilled or warm.

I make a lot of salmon for big family dinners, and this is by far everyone's favorite recipe. Best barbecue sauce ever, and it gives the salmon a smokey flavor that complements it well.

The sauce is delicious; however, it somewhat overwhelms the salmon. I will make it again, but the sauce might be better with chicken or maybe ham. I did omit the jalepenos.

Loved it. The barbeque sauce tastes great and is easy to prepare. I simply served it with rice instead of the mache salad.

This is a nice tangy barbecue sauce. Once I realized that I was making plenty for use later, I didn't worry that it seemed to be making an awful lot. I saved it for use later.

This was a wonderful dish. Usually I eat salmon with lemon and dill because it is already such a flavorful fish and doesn't need anything else. I'm very glad to have tried something new and loved it. It's also great cold the next day.

The sauce was great-but grilled salmon is the best with the least. Wouldn't go to the bother again. Of course, we are spoiled with fresh seafood year-round here in So. Cal.

I made this dish for my sister's birthday and it was an instant hit! I cut back on the brown sugar, paprika and curry powder and increased the garlic and peppers. Everyone loved the sauce! I served it with buttered rice and steamed vegetables, instead of the salad. Great recipe!

THE SAUCE WAS TOO SWEET FOR OUR TASTE, SO I ADDED A SPLASH OF WHITE VINEGAR, AND IT WAS OUTSTANDING.

I skipped the Mache and dressing. Instead I just made the barbequed salmon. Even though I had to eliminate the curry and substitute regular mustard (reduced quantity a little-I hate regular mustard)and use tomato salsa vinegar for rice wine vinegar, it was absolutely fabulous. My 7 oz. filets took about 8 minutes on each side. When I turned them over the skin slid off easily so just before serving I turned them again so they looked attractive on both sides.

great salad, the salmon was spicy, but tangy. everyone loved it!!!!

Four forks with modifications -- Sensing that the recipe was going to be too sweet, I omitted the brown sugar (it was still plenty sweet). Also, I doubled the garlic. Finally, I placed soaked hickory wood chips over the hot lava stones just prior to grilling -- this put the dish over the top! My family wants this for dinner again tonight!

I substituted tomato sauce, dijon mustard and canned jalapenos. Also, I made a mistake and used double the amount of tomato sauce, so just reduced it. This is a very forgiving recipe and is just excellent!

My husband brought this to work for lunch and the next day everyone was asking for the recipe. My son loves the barbeque sauce on chicken. This is now a family favorite.

We loved this ! I couldn''t get any fresh salmon so I used chicken breasts ( I marinaded the chicken breasts about 1 hour before grilling them ) then sliced and placed on top of the salad greens .....everyone liked it I'll be making it again soon and passed the recipe on to a friend

A great entertaining recipe. I marinate a rack of salmon for several hours in the sauce then slow cook it in a basket above the grill to increase the smoke flavor. I skip the greens and added a caesar salad with basmati on the side.

Both my husband and I were pleasantly surprised with how delicious this turned out to be. Fresh salmon is imperitive- although I would say that mache is not. Because I didn't have the time to call and drive the world over to procure mache, I substituted a mesclun green mix and served it on the side with the dressing, rather than under the fish as the recipe suggests. It was perfect. Also, fellow cilantro haters, don't be afraid to try this recipe. Just sub parsley for the cilantro...

What a great sauce to compliment salmon. We can't wait to try it on chicken, or pulled beef. The jalapenos add just the right heat! We didn't use the greens, and frankly didn't miss them!

This is definitely a "keeper"! I tried it with salmon, and also on chicken brochette. It was even good on the vegetables. I served the salmon on top of a gourmet salad mix.

I was a little timid when this recipe was made. After the first bite however I was hooked. The barbeque sauce is one of the best I've had and would happily pour over chicken or tuna steaks. This recipe is a keeper in my cookbook and should be with anyone's. The sides I had with it were tomatoes topped with a mango salsa and red potato salad. A delicious combination!

Served this for a dinner party (no mache). This sauce would be awesome with chicken, ribs, steaks, etc. A real hit with the salmon.

this is a great bbq sauce -- despite the long list of ingredients. not a fan of ketchup, i substitute slightly reconstituted tomato paste. and throw in extra jalapenos. i've grilled both salmon and chicken in this and both are delicious. i've never seen mache ...
