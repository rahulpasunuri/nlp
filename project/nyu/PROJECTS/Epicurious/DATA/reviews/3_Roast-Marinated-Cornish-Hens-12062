Everyone loved this and had at least seconds - including my kids! Very easy to make and very tasty. I did not change a thing. The sauce is really good.

Great basic marinade/sauce. To get a strong balance of Thai flavors (hot, sweet, sour, salty) I added chilie/garlic sauce and lime juice/zest, extra brown suagar and fist sauce, and used red curry paste (insted of powder) and lowfat coconut milk, and then marinated and grilled chicken breasts. Very nice, complex flavors. Definately using this combo again.

Only so-so despite the richness of the ingredients. There are better ones out there.

I was just hovering over my stove sampling the chicken as it came out of the oven. I was a bit disappointed that the dominant flavor was the brown sugar. I think the previous reviewer was wise to have grilled his chicken. I couldn't really taste the lemon grass and will try to find a way to accent that more next time I make it. The marinade looked SOOO good as I was slapping in on last night... I am going to decrease the 1/4 c of brown sugar and see if that changes anything. After tasting the chicken and wanting more out of it I cut up a lime from my counter and squeezed some on. YUM! The acid definitely adds zing and makes it taste more Thai. Then again I have never had this dish in restaurants so I may be completely misguided. Anyhow, try the lime - my family liked it too. The Sweet Chili sauce was also very sweet. Didn't do much to enhance the chicken.

Excellent. Flavourful, moist, tender, fairly easy to prepare. I cooked it on an outdoor grill. Received raves from my guests.
