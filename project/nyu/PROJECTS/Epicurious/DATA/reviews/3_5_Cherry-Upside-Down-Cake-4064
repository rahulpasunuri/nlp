I once made this cake THREE! times in one week! Yes, it is that good! It's become a favorite of my moms, so whenever we have fresh cherries I always am sure to make this.

One thing I forgot to add to my review just now was that the only pan I had available was a large springform. This meant that the cake cooked fully in 25 minutes rather than the suggested 55, and was very easy to serve. Somebody below said springform pans wouldn't work but it worked like a dream for me.

Today I was on a hunt for a non-chocolaty way to use up a jar of sour cherries. This recipe did the trick. I followed it to the letter, with the exception that my cherries were obviously not fresh (I took the extra time to drain and pat them dry of all liquid after pitting them because they'd been jarred in light syrup). I think separating the eggs is too important a step to miss as it ensured the cake turned out fluffy and light. The only thing preventing me from giving this four stars was that the cake was on the dry side. The topping and the whip cream certainly mask this, but a mouthful of just the cake itself wasn't as moist as it could be.

My family enjoyed this version of upside down cake. I make upside down cakes often and liked a new idea. I used frozen cherries instead of fresh. I also added 1/2 cup cocoa to the cake batter and made it a chocolate cake.

I have to agree with the other people who didn't find this all that special. My fresh cherries were delicious on their own, but seemed to lose something when cooked into this cake. It was sweet, but there wasn't enough dimension of flavor. Maybe adding some almond extract to the cake might have improved it, but I don't think I'll make this again... I'll try something new instead.

This cake is absolutely amazing. It turned out perfectly.

I just made this today for the first time. Wow! Delicious! Yes, it is a bit time consuming but worth it. I made it exactly as described (although I used a nonstick cake pan and Pam) and it came out perfectly - no problems at all. My biggest problem will be stopping myself from eating the entire cake by myself!

This cake came out beautiful, and it was very moist and delicious. I thought it was a little too sweet and a bit bland, so I served it with a dollop of unsweetened Greek yogurt, which was perfect. I'll definitely make this one again.

Delicious. The crumb was moist and light. The cake has a lovely vanilla and cherry perfume. Going in the recipe box.

I made this as a birthday cake for a friend who doesn't like conventional cakes or chocolate (and for assembled guests who aren't usually dessert- eaters; in other words, a tough crowd to please). It was a huge hit. To serve a larger number of people I increased all ingredients by 33% and used two eggs. It turned out perfectly, and was delicious!

This cake was wonderful! I made it in a 10 inch cast iron pan, as most upside-down cakes call for, and it turned out perfect. Sprayed the pan first, no problems sticking. One thing to be aware of though, is that I checked it after 40 minutes and it was completely done, perhaps even a tiny bit over-done, so be aware. One piece left at a dinner party for 6 which I ate straight out of the fridge the next day and it was still delicious! I added chopped cherries to the whipped cream (1/2 pint is not enough), and it turned out great. Really easy and delicious!

This is amazing! My dad gave me sour cherries from the trees in his orchard and I decided to try this recipe; my whole family thought this was outstanding (and they are "dessert specialists"). A couple things to help out other people: PLEASE use fresh or frozen sour cherries, not canned. Just mix them with 3/4 cup of white sugar before starting the recipe. Use a 9" square glass or metal pan as most round cake pans aren't deep enough and a springform doesn't work. Spray the bottom of the pan and sides with Pam before melting the butter in it, the cake slides right out. This is just as good with vanilla ice cream as whipped cream...but serve the cake a little warm.

I just made this recipe today, and the cakes are out of the oven. First let me start out by saying that the flavours of this cake are just wonderful, be mindful to definitely use the cherries in season, and butter in the recipe. Now I follwed this recipe exactly,and I found I needed to use 2 9 inch pans, and the topping on one kind of stuck to the pan when I inverted it. I don't understand why either, I buttered the pans, evenly. Also I noticed that during the baking process the sugar mixture boiled over a bit so while it was baking it kind of bubbled over a bit. Perhaps I overloaded the pans??? But otherwise the taste is wonderful and the cake so yummy!!! Any suggestions on how I can preven the sticking issue to insure a prettier presentation???

I think the reviewer who found this boring must have left out an ingredient or used tasteless cherries or something, because we thought this was delicious. One thing to watch, is never use margarine if it says butter. There is a difference in taste.

Don't understand the raves on this one. We found this boring. Absolutely nothing redeeming about it. I'm looking for another use for the rest of the cherries.

This was sooooo yummy. I have more cherries and I can't wait to make it again.

Oh my lordy, this is good. Like the previous reviewer, I did not bother to separate the eggs. The resulting cake was similar to a pound cake, dense and rich and buttery. I used dark brown sugar on the cherry layer so it tasted a bit caramel-ish. Yummy.

Combined fresh Ranier cherries with apricots from the farmer's market and it turned out great. Used two whole eggs rather than separating the yolks & beating the whites, for a denser cake. Not too sweet, compliments the fruit perfectly!

I first made this cake when the recipe was originally published. It never lasts more than an hour and I know when my husband buys fresh cherries it mean make this cake. I've even used frozen cherries in the winter.

I made this for my husband on Father's Day and made the mistake of letting him taste it before dinner. Needless to say, our whole family skipped the steaks and grilled potatoes and went straight to desert. It's that good!

This is the recipe to make with fresh summer cherries! I don't really care for cherries but love them in this recipe. I have made it 3 times.

A very good recipe, and, as a previous reviewer said, not too sweet. My guests liked it a lot. I'll definitely make it again.

I altered this recipe significantly by substituting apples and raspberries for the cherries because no one I know likes cherries enough to justify making a cake. Sauteed the apples in butter and sugar first. The cake part of this recipe is rich, but very good.

Delicious dessert. A little time-consuming to pit and half all of the cherries but easy to make. Served it at a dinner for extended family and everyone from children to grandparents loved.

A very good cake -- Not too sweet -- texture is similar to pound cake

A wonderful family dessert that impresses company as well. I believe it could be adapted to peaches or blueberries with equal success. A definite keeper.

The first few times I made it was so good. But recent attempts had been poor. I am not sure what had gone wrong. The results when I first discovered this recipe was extremely light sponge like cake, with caramelised topping. it was excellent esp when i had it served warm, with vanilla ice cream

I used particularly juicy cherries and had to quickly slide a cookie sheet under the pan as the juices threatened to bubble over. While I probably would make this recipe again, I've come to the conclusion that nothing can really compare with the taste of fresh cherries, just as they are.

I used a 300 degree convection oven for 50 minutes, different,very good!
