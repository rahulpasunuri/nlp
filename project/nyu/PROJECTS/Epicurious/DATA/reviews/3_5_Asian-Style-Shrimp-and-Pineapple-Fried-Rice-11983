I really, really like this recipe. Not overwhelming amount of time to prep, almost no time for cooking. The flavors are great. I decided to use pineapple chunks from a can which worked out wonderfully. I will definitely make this dish again.

We loved this recipe. I did use some of the suggested modifications. I sauteed the peppers with the garlic and added a small onion as well. In addition I added peas and also added fresh minced ginger to the pineapple mixture. I also doubled the sauce. It was delicious.

I have been making this dish since it was first published. We have fiends that ask for it. It has withstood the test of time. After reading the reviews I will add grated ginger and see but we think it is prefect as is.

I really enjoyed this dish, I did follow some of the alteration suggested by other reviewers and added my own. I tripled the amount of sauce, I replaced the water with pineapple juice, I increased the amount of jalapeno and added fresh grated ginger with the garlic. It was very flavorful. I did use the anchovy paste because I had it on hand, though fish sauce would be great, I wouldn't hesitate to use the paste again. A delicious quick weeknight meal and a great way to use up leftover rice(even wild rice, which is what i had leftover)

used fish sauce instead of the anchovy paste (seemed more authentic) and leftover grilled shrimp and sausage from the night before. was very tasty

Made half the serves suggested as I have less people to feed. Followed the soy sauce serving size, however, just as some reviews suggested. Still, the end result was just a little bit too bland. definitely need more soy sauce mix and more chillis. Once that is upped by, say, another serving size, the taste should be beautiful.

Made some minor adjustments but thought this was a nice easy dish. I added more chilies and sauced it up a bit, adding more soy and pineapple juice (from a very juicy pineapple that had been sitting on the kitchen counter for a very long time).

I made this with my 80 year old Chinese father who is a gourmet cook and we both loved it. We did need to add triple the jalapeno, the JUICE of the pineapple and assorted vegetables (snow peas, bean sprouts and blanched broccoli). We also used fish sauce instead of anchovy paste. I will make it again.

My husband and I thought this was wonderful. Stuck to the recipe but I didn't think it made enough sauce. This will be a healthy staple from now on.

This was a good, fast stir fry. The inclusion of tumeric made it special. I also subbed 1 T fish sauce for anchovy paste, sauteed a T of ginger with the garlic, and added half a 10 oz. package of frozen peas. Next time I will either saute the pepper with the garlic, or cut it smaller. It didn't really soften in that short amount of cooking time.

My grandfather is from Blue Fields, Nicaragua where it is very tropical and my father was raised on much like a Caribean/Thai/Latin mix of foods. I made this rice to try before Father's Day and though it was wonderful. I omited the shrimp and anchovy due to a cousin's allergy, but added fried cashews and more jalepenos. I also used brown jasmine rice and loved it! I will serve it with coconut black beans, cilantro lime bbq chicken thighs, and a dulce de leche cake for dessert. My father will love it!

This was delicious! The tumeric really gives it the flavor of Thai food. I used fish sauce instead of anchovy and leftover grilled pork tenderloin slices instead of the shrimp. Very good and extremely easy!!

The results are fantastic and it's such a cinch. As suggested, I started with 2C cooked rice and slowly added the sauce mixture but used another cup of rice because there was too much sauce. I replaced the water with juice from the fresh cut pineapple and used fish sauce instead. Also added cubed cooked chicken breast to complement the shrimp. I omitted the bell pepper and cilantro since I did not have them. I have also made it by adding the sauce and the rest of the fried ingredients to hot cooked rice and stirring it to mix. Turns out just as well.

We have made this several times and love it . I changed it as suggested in a comment below though .Substitute the anchovy paste for 1-2 T fish sauce and I do not use the bell peppers or Jalapenos . I also add a little more pineapple or soy/fish sauce at the end to make it just right .This way you can balance the sweet and salty to your liking.

This is one of my husband's absolute favorites. I generally use a little less rice, maybe 3 cups (cooked), and add a bit more salt or fish sauce. Otherwise, it is just wonderful. Oh, and if you can splurge on the real pineapple, do so. When I first made it, I made it with canned, but the other day they had fresh pineapples on sale and it was out of this world good with the fresh pineapple.

Absolutely awful!!! My daughter requested this dish - she loves 'anything' fried rice. The seasonings in the recipe didn't lead me to expect much, but this food was terrible. I TRIED TO ERASE THE ONE FORK I PUT IN BUT COULDN'T.

This is four stars with a couple of changes made; I was looking for a pineapple fried rice that compared to my favorite Thai restaurant when I was living in San Diego, and this is it! Substitute the anchovy paste for 1-2 T fish sauce, add chunks of tomato, and cashews. (I also substituted the jalapeno for regular small red chilis, but I think either would be fine.) These ingredients really adds to an already multi-layered, flavorful dish, and enhances it greatly. Subtle and fresh, with a good combo of fragrant/ sweet/ salty/ spicy.

Very good and unusual. I definitely like the mix of flavors. I followed the recipe exactly, except I omitted the anchovy paste and the coriander (should have read the reviews first to know that fresh coriander=cilantro!) I thought it could use a little more flavor so next time I will double the jalapenos and use the cilantro. I served it with extra soy sauce.

Nice combination for shrimp and pineapple. I used 4 cups rice. remember fresh coriander is usually called cilantro. My husband got confused and got coriander, so we did without the cilantro.

Delicious! My husband and I really like asian food. This recipe was a definite success. I added another teaspoon of anchovy paste and another garlic clove and I also added another tsp of jalapeno peppers. I cooked two cups of rice instead of five. Very tasty. I will surely prepare this dish again.

Very tasty! I used day-old Jasmine rice, canned pineapple, tripled the amount of scallions, and cut the shrimp in half. Next time I will puree the jalapenos for more flavor throughout instead of just in some bites.

Two arbol chilies in the oil. Sauted the shrimp tails in oil. Other than having 3 1/2 cups of basmati rice & canned pineapple, the rest was pretty much the same. Bland & tasteless? I hardly think so!! Fed 4 of us with no left overs. And they were looking for some! Oh! I did add a splash of dry sherry. No cilantro! :( Can hardly wait to try this with all of the correct ingredients!

Made this several times & everyone loved it! I also added fried peanuts & dried shredded pork (you can find these in most Chinese stores) as garnish to enhance presentation / flavour.

I just cannot imagine anyone found this recipe dull and lifeless! It was very tasty! Although I had a hard time with the thought of using jalapenos in an Asian recipe. Instead I used the more standard small red chilis. Also used peanut oil. Didn't have fresh coriander so I used dried, I imagine fresh would have been even better. Will definitely make this recipe again. It went extremely well with the pork chops with ginger-soy glaze also found on this website. The flavors blended quite well!

For best results start with jasmine, day old rice that's been refrigerated. Much more fragrant. Substituted fish sauce for the anchovy paste to taste. Much like the pineapple fried rice in Thai restuarants.

a complete let-down...extremely dull & lifeless...quite boring flavor...anxious to see if anyone else had similar results.
