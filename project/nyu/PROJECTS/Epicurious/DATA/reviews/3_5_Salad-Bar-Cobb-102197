Made this tonight for hubby and myself and we both loved it. A great easy summer meal. I used grilled chicken from Trader Joe's (I hate deli chicken and turkey, too salty) and omitted the blue cheese as neither of us are fans. As another reviewer noted, regular dijon works well too if that is what you have.

I thought this was very good but next time I'd use plain Dijon mustard. I thought the honey Dijon made it too sweet.

I make this every summer and will do so again tomorrow. I never use smoked meat, I simply get a pre-cooked chicken. If avocados are too hard, I skip them.

Very nice and easy salad. I did it to use avocado, but I bet it would be good even without avocado.

As a gourmet lunch caterer, I need simple, easy to make menu items that keep people happy eating at their desk. I made 20 salads the 1st day and they were gone as fast as I could say " cha- ching". I made them again 2 days later after my original 20 customers raved about the "Great New Salad" I had created. Once again I must thanks someone else for my success

Delicious Salad. I've made it twice, but what I wanted to especially rave about is the dressing. I didn't like the dressing too much with the red wine vinegar and thought it infinitely better if balsamic vinegar was used instead. Try it!

Yum. Bring on the baguette. A great dish for a summer dinner or a luncheon year round!

Great salad! I prepare on one large platter - the presentation is wonderful. The taste just terrific!

I love this salad as a great main course in the summer. The dressing really complements the salad.

I make this recipe all the time! It's practically my house salad. I've served it for dinner and for when I have friends over for lunch. It's always a hit. It's simple and one of my favorite things!
