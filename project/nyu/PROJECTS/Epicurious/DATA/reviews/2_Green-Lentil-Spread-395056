Ignore the low fork rating (someone reviewed 3 times). It's perfect as is. Makes a great vegetarian sandwich on a warm pita. I can't stop eating it.

Don't let the fork count scare you off, this lentil spread is quite nice. I used veg broth rather than chicken, but otherwise left it unchanged, served it in a brightly coloured bowl garnished with a bit of rosemary. It was a perfect companion to the hummus and aubergine dip I also served. If you like lentils, you should like this. PS Although you might be able to make do with the regular large green/brown lentils, DON'T use the red ones which get way too soft and break down too quickly.

Like lentil soup? How about pate? This spread is a marriage of the two. It's thick and full of lentil flavor, with a hint of citrus. Yes, it's a dark grayish color--not the most attractive spread--but what do you expect from pureed lentils?

If I could give it zero forks I would. I made it for company (after ordering the French green lentils online), and was ashamed to serve it, not only due to its unattractive appearance, but due to its unappealing taste. Terrible waste of time. I can't believe that Bon Appetit sang its praises! Yucko; garbage cans around America will not go hungry with this dish!

This recipe has potential, but not thrilled with the results. I wish I had not used chicken broth and instead used water. All I can taste is chicken, not the clean flavor of lentils. I used pink instead of French and they fell apart in 20 minutes. I ended up draining the stock off after cooking in order to get a better texture. I made it yesterday for a dinner party tonight and not sure if I will serve it. The texture improved overnight and I am glad I used olive oil. I am a bit aprehensive about what will happen to the texture of the dip once it sits at room temp.

My wife and I are longtime subscribers to Gourmet & Bon Appetit. I regularly use epicurious.com for recipe ideas. That said, the Green Lentil Spread is the worst thing I ever made. I used all the right ingredients, including French Lentils. The resulting "glop," and there is no other word for it, has absolutely no table appeal. As for taste, it is hardly worth the effort. We had planned to serve it for a weekend gathering; we're not. We love trying new recipes and, by far, the results are generally pleasing. Keep'm coming.
