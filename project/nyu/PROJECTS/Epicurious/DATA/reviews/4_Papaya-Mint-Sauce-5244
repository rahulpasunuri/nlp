I made this for a bridal shower and everyone there could not get enough of it! I quadrupled the recipe as it was a large crowd. There was barely any left to take home. I did make a change and used mango instead of papaya; the papayas were not ripe enough to use. I used mango puree in the sauce as well. I am anxious to try it with papaya next time.

We are on vacation in Hawaii, had some friends for dinner, looked in epicurious for a papaya receipe and found this mint sauce for the fruit salad. It was perfect and everyone loved the salad. Didn't deviate from the recipe on the sauce. Added a few more types of fruit for the salad. Absolutely delicious, making it again tonite for another party.

See my review on the salad itself. This sauce is one of the most important items that makes this salad so memorable.

The cooking class tried this with the Asian Fruit Salad. Our papaya was crummy so we used Papaya Nectar and concentrated it a little then added the rest of the ingredients. All agreed that it was a wonderful touch for the salad and we can't imagine it being much better
