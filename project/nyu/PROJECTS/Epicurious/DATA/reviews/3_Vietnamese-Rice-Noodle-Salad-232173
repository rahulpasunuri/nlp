Great quick salad. Served with miso marinated salmon filets. Added chopped red pepper, snow peas and green onion. Added 2 Tbs peanut butter and 1 tbs olive oil to the dressing. Fantastic!

Yummy! Made this for a dinner at my friends house and everyone loved the flavours! I used a whole 16oz package of rice noodles and ran them under cold water once cooked. Due to the quantity of noodles I doubled the sauce recipe...but if you like it saucy thriple it. I didn't have Rice wine vinegar so used apple cider vinegar & added more sugar. I used half a finely chopped verdela onion, added a few cloves of garlic (maybe too much) and also added green peas for some more colour. I forgot to add the cucumber but added the juice of 1 lime AND half a cup of smooth peanut butter (mixed well into the sauce). Also used a couple of table spoons of Kraft oil & vinegar to help the noodle consistency. You can play around with this recipe a bit in-fact I also added some crunchy fried noodles as I love the whole soft noodles mixed with some crunch. Happy sharing makes happier eating!

This is more of a noodle side dish or first course than a "salad". I used the peanut butter substitution recommended by other reviewers, but I think there are other peanut noodle recipes out there that are better than this. The dish is easy, and would make a tasty side for grilled meat or fish. I will probably make it again; maybe add toasted sesame seeds or some red pepper flakes to give it a little more zing.

I upped the rice noodles to 7 oz in order to serve more people. Definitely add the peanut butter to the sauce -- it was delicious. I used red pepper and cucumber sliced into slender sticks and included purple Thai basil I had that day from the farmer's market into the mix for extra color and amazing flavor along with the cilantro and fresh mint. Big hit.

I make a main serving meal out of this by adding dry fried tofu, red bell pepper sticks & use only a 1/4 c. chopped cilantro on top. When the noodles are done soaking I toss them in sesame oil before mixing them in with the rest of the ingredients. This is a great warm weather dinner or pot luck dish.

I have made this recipe twice and played around with it the second time. Try this recipe but add one tablespoon of sesame oil and a tablespoon of soy sauce (instead of the salt) to the dressing. The salad was great with cucumbers, edamame and Asian-marinaded tofu, too. My children don't love cilantro, so I offer it on the side, along with extra peanuts and sriracha hot chili sauce. Yum!!!

I loved this recipe. Easy,colorful and ooooh so tasty. I am bringing it to a beach party right now. I tripled the recipe and added peanutbutter (skippy natural).. approx 2 tbsp per proportion listed and added red pepper and about 1/4 lb of shrimp (not to overwhelm) and this is a fabulous dish, so colorful. Would look wonderful in a bamboo or light wood bowl.

Followed recipe exactly as written. Boring. Bland. My son loves rice noodles so I will try it again with the peanut butter suggestion.

we LOVED this. Added cucumber sticks. no peanuts. Only used cilantro. Definitely better than 2.5 forks. But we love thai. Served with grilled marinated tofu recipe from this site.

Really liked this - fresh and delicious. I did not boil the noodles after soaking as they seemed done to me, and they kept their shape and texture well after being mixed with the rest of the ingredients. Adults and teenagers alike just scarfed this down. Made this with the Vietnamese Grilled Pork and unlike some other reviewers, I thought the 2 dishes complemented each other well.

I added cucumber sticks from my garden and did not boil the rice noodles after they had soaked for 15 minutes. I served it with fresh grilled salmon on a hot summer day. My husband and I both liked it and I will certainly prepare it again.

I must have used the wrong noodles, and not "pat-dried" them properly (although I left them out on a tray for some time), because the final result was a cold, wet mass of white. The taste was quite good, though. I think next time, I'll use the peanut butter as suggested (I followed the recipe), and add some more veggies. And I'll try cellophane noodles instead of rice noodles.

Bear with me: I'm a recipe tweaker. I had made this once (with my version of caramelized pork chops) and liked it, but, like another reviewer, thought it needed a certain something. For me, that someting was more substance. The noodles just seemed overwhelmed by the richly flavoured pork. So I prepared the noodles as written (and once used soba because that's what was around) and seperately prepared shredded cabbage, matchsticked cucumber, carrot, red pepper and scallion in a rice vinegar/salt/sugar/fish sauce dressing. Actually, I make the veggie mix in advance so it can sit. Then I toss the cooked noodles with (here's the "substantial" part) a few spoonfuls of thick chinese marinade (Soy Vey is fabulous, or a mix of hoisin, garlic, sesame seeds, &soy is a fine sub), top it with the zesty veggie pickle, then slice and fan out the pork on top, sprinkled with chopped peanuts. It's like a winterized version, but still retains it cool freshness for warmer days!

This is very much like a favorite dish at a local Vietnamese restaurant, which I've been trying to recreate with out a lot of success.

I'm not sure I would have liked this recipe as is, but a couple modification made it SO delicious! Instead of plain peanuts, I added 1/2 cup peanut butter. The sauce was creamy and the flavors blended really nicely. Also added some thawed pre-cooked shrimp for more interest. Tofu would be nice too. Seriously, try it with the peanut butter, it's amazing!

Again, I'd give this 2-1/2 forks. Liked it a lot (with the caramelized pork). Refreshing. And, again, it took longer to make than indicated in the magazine.

Delicious. I made this with the caramelized grilled pork. Next time I will make with grilled shrimp.

Definitely a refreshing salad. I added cucumbers too. Served it with sauteed chicken breasts I had marinated in soy sauce, sesame oil and a bit of sugar.

This was ok. I made it with the Vietnamese Caramelized Pork Chops as shown in the magazine, and the two dishes did not go together well. This salad has potential as a light refreshing summer salad--maybe with seasoned grilled shrimp, but don't try it w/the pork chops.
