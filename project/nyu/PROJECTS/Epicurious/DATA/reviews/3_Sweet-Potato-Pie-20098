I thought this recipe was terrible. Dry and not sweet enough (and I usually cut sugar in half). Needs a bit of cream and whole eggs. Not offensive, just not the fragrant creamy sweet potato pie I remember my grandmother making. Sadly, this one went in the trash. Back to the drawing board.

The sweet potato part of the pie was fine, but the meringue was a DISASTER! At first, it was silky and lightly browned. But overnight it turned to mush --- the meringue is apparently prone to "weep." If you want to make this recipe, I strongly advise eating it immediately.
