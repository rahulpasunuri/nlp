I was very disappointed in the sorbet. I will not ever make it again. There are so many wonderful recipes around to choose from, but this one is not one that I will ever try again.

Pretty tasty. Grapefruit cups add nothing but style so can be left out if you are in a hurry. Deep-frying herbs was fun and easy - I may start putting them on everything.

Made this for a small dinner party. Used apricot honey as it was all I had on hand. Paired it with a cantaloupe sorbet, served in frozen grapefruit cups and garnished with mint which made for a wonderful presentation. My guests loved it...finished off the batch. The tanginess of the buttermilk and the sweetness of the honey make for a wonderful combination. Plus, it was SO easy.
