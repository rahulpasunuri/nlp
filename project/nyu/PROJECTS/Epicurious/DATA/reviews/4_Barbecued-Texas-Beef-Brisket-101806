I don't have access to a Smoker. Finding it pretty hard to find a smoker in Australia! Used the oven cooking recommendations. It was amazing. Looking forward to trying it again!

I am not going to rate it because I don't have a smoker, so I had to improvise a bit. However, if I did it would be a raving four stars. I followed the recipe exactly other than the smoker, I just put it in my oven at 200 tightly wrapped, and mopped it every hour and a half. While I am sure it would be much better with a smoker, it was really gorgeous this way. My guests ate an ungodly amount of meat, and all of them raved.

This was a huge hit with my husband and 21 year old son. And I just happened to make it on the most perfect 90 degree summer day! I followed the instructions to the letter, using my Brinkmann smoker. I bought the lump charcoal and hickory smoking chunks at Ace Hardware, and the beef brisket at Costco. I have to say that it turned out extremely smokey, but that may be my mid-western tastebuds talking. It is very rich, but the barbecue sauce cuts the smokiness perfectly, and I used all the 1/2 cup of reserved mop in the sauce. I accompanied the brisket with a creamy slaw, baked beans cooked all day, and sauteed fresh corn with basil. I will attempt my dad's specialty, a smoked turkey, next.

I also made this in a dutch oven with all the mop. I did marinate it overnight in the rub. Following the recipe on Epicurious for sweet-and- sour brisket, I seered it quickly and then cooked it at 350 degrees for about three hours. I just didn't have the time for slow smoking. It was very tasty. There was about a 1/2-inch layer of fat on one side, which I trimmed off after cooking.

I have eaten a lot of barbecued brisket and can agree that this is the real thing, but meaning a lot more being home-made! I went the whole nine yards and ten hours with a charcoal smoker with chips and chunks and don't see how you could get that unique flavor any other way. The slab of meat I started with was a little less than called for, but still could have gone a few hours longer (we never did make it above 155 degrees in the meat the first night, but it was fine.) It could have had a thicker layer of fat on top, too. The rub was a bit too spicy for some, but that could have been from an unusually strong chili powder. Overall, I am very happy with the recipe, damned proud of myself, and looking at whatever is smoked next as being as simple as a walk in the park.

This is my favorite barbecue recipe. The last time I made it I froze the leftover mop mixed with barbecue sauce and then later purchased a cooked tri-tip, sliced it thinly, poured the marinade over it and then let it sit for a day or two. When we were ready for sandwiches I just heated up the marinated tri-tip in a pan and served it on fresh, soft onion buns. It was fantastic!

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe, well worth the time and effort. As to an earlier review complaining about the amount of fat, that's the only flaw in the recipe. It should tell you to trim and scrape away all the fat after cooking. I work in a Texas- style BBQ restaurant and have to deal with at least 15 of these beasts every day. I scrape off more fat than there is meat, but what's left is so lean, tender and delectable. Get yourself some Texas toast and make some awesome sandwiches.

Just wanted to correct my error on the source for the smoker bags - I got them from a web source called my secret pantry not world pantry. My apologies for the confusion!

Rating: 3
Thank you Rainey from Austin on the tip about smoker bags! I was able to obtain them from the World Pantry web site. I have a gas grill and no smoker, so I put the brisket in a smoker bag and used an indirect heat (low setting) cooking method on our gas grill. (I turned the bag around every hour to balance exposure to the heat.) I left it on the grill for about six hours and then transferred it to the oven and cooked it at 225 degrees for another 2 hours. We lived in Houston a number of years ago and loved Goode Co. brisket. My non-smoker execution didn't exactly replicate theirs, but we were very happy with the results!

It was my first time ever cooking brisket. I made it for christmas dinner for my husband's family who is from Kansas City. It was a huge success! I left out the jalapeno this time - some guests too sensitive to spice. I had some excellent smoked paprika on hand so i added a tsp of that. Thanks to previous reviewers I followed advice and smoked it for 5 hrs and then proceeded to cook it for an additional 8 hrs at 225. I wasn't able to maintain a consistent enough temp in there to really "cook" it in the smoker at all (really cold outside and cheap smoker) - but got it nice and smoky and finished til super tender in the oven where i poured the rest of the mop in the pan and covered it tightly in foil. It was awesome. Even the other guests who weren't previously into brisket or bbq LOVED it. Thanks! We'll be having this again and again.

I made this recipe, however it did not smoke it but cooked it in a dutch over with all the mop. It cooked overnight, awakening me at 2am with its terrific aroma. Since it slow cooked in the mop, it left tons of broth. I added about a cup to the bbq sauce mix. The rest I am holding on to for a base for chili.

I wanted so badly for this to turn out well, but it was way too fatty! The flavor of the meat we could eat was awesome, but just had to eat around the TONS of fat in the meat. What did I do wrong? Isn't the fat supposed to cook off? Maybe I'll check in with the butcher I got it from. Any advice out there would be appreciated. My hubby loves a good brisket and I'd love to be able to master this one.

For those of you with no smoker, Williams Sonoma makes these amazing smoker bags that you can use in the oven. Just set the oven to the same temperature as you would your smoker, and cook it for the same amount of time. Tastes FANTASTIC!

The rub and mob for this recipie are superb. As a native Texan in exile (NH), I can honestly say that this provides the one of the most authentic Texas BBQ beef briskets that can be had anywhere. I do have a couple of suggestions/ observations, however: I love real lump charcoal for grilling, but it has a tendency to burn very hot - certainly too hot to maintain such a low temperature - so use plain old briquettes. And don't bother with soaked wood chips. Instead, every hour or so add a 50-50 mixture of briquettes and wood chunks (available at Home Depot, Lowes, etc.) - I prefer mesquite myself. Ease off on the amount of wood in the second part of the smoking. Another thing they don't tell you is that you want to put the brisket as FAR away from your heat source as possible in the smoker for slow recipies like this. To prevent drying, put a foil pan of water and onions in the rack below your brisket. You won't get any drippings, but it helps ensure a moister smoke. Finally, You can actually keep the smoker a little warmer than they suggest; I keep mine at 250 and the brisket comes out fine: moist, juicy, tenderlicious after about 8 hours. Trust the thermometer, though, not the time.

Rating: 4
I referenced the "no smoker" review (oven instructions), which was very helpful. Liquid smoke was a nice addition for oven cooking. To keep additional moisture in, I covered my dutch oven with foil (under lid)and also flipped the brisket when I mopped. The meat was tender and absolutely perfect. I ended up having to let the rub sit on the meat for about 2 1/2 days, and it was still fantastic- not overpowering. A great recipe.

Rating: 0
I was shocked at how GREAT this came out. I changed it up a bit, I used 3 tablespoons of chile powder instead of 2. I also took it off the smoker when the meat temperature hit 150 degrees. My neighbor compared it to a brisket he had at Blue Smoke restaurant in NY!

Made this one on the weekend, and it came out pretty much perfect! Although the recipe says you can't make it with a barbecue, I smoked it in my gas 'cue for 10 hours, using a blend of hickory and mesquite chips in foil smoking pouches, and for my money it came out correctly smoked and cooked just right. Served it to guests I have visited honest-to-God Texas barbecue joints with (Dallas, Austin and San Antonio), and they voted this as better!

This is SO close to my way of fixing brisket. I WILL admit starting it in the oven overnight at '225 wrapped in foil. Then pour off the juices into a bowl for the sauce, and put brisket without foil in the smoker with good wood for at least 4 hours, fat side up, and hit it with the mop per the recipe being reviewed. I drain the fat off the reserved juice and build my BBQ sauce from there, adding ketchup, vinegar, mustard, worchestershire, beer, brown sugar, molassas, and anything else that seems proper. I'm old school Texan, forever seeking to perfect, but Zen-like, never quite achieving.

Just got in after 9 hours and 20 minutes in the pit. Can't wait until tomorrow. Third time around on this recipe. Wrap in the foil for sure. My pet peeve is anyone who reviews their own recipe and not this one. You can cook any road kill or corned beef in your oven. This is about BBQ. I live in pig/apple country and my pit is 18 cinder blocks (3 rows of 6) with a pyramid of outfacing blocks in the front as a flue. Get 2 boards, an old oven rack, an aluminum grill top (from the dump), two aluminum 18" lasagna pans, 4 bricks and you're in business. You need local hardwood. This year it's cherry and oak here. No apple when I needed it. Follow this recipe and you have a spectacular brisket. Go indirect with the heat. Forget the themometer, they are for a baby's you-know-what. Learn how to gauge your starting weight of meat to progress. I you are going to BBQ, this is mandatory. This works for all outside cooked meats. Just reheat this puppy the next day at 300 degrees for 1 hour and 20 minutes and you're gonna like it. Squeeze the juice out of your mop and don't forget to save any drippings in the aluminum foil. One of us doesn't like sauce so I make it out of drippings, leftover mop and dare I say store brand ketchup. Ms. Bossy likes it with just drippings. A little sour cream and cilantro on the side with some decent toast and maybe a little fresh Summer tomato dice & you'll cry. If I made this in an oven I would never admit it! When serving this recipe it is best very thinly sliced. Get a SHARP knife. I am a thick meat guy but Ms. Bossy has converted me to thin on this one. Coals is King.

FOR THOSE WITH NO SMOKER: Have done this in the oven about 5 times now and feel I have the method perfected. Before applying the rub, pour liquid smoke in palms and rub down the meat, about 2 tbsps for a 4 lb brisket. Add additional 2 tbsps of smoke to the marinade. I use a dutch-oven-like pot and cook, covered, at 215 degrees for 1.5 hours per pound of meat. Basting doesn't seem scientific; I've had equally good results basting precisely on the half hour as basting only 2 or 3 times total (went to the movies once during cook time! who said this was time consuming?! :) Tenderness is much-improved by flipping the thing over two or three times during cooking. Take the lid off and increase heat to 250 for the last hour in order to let the edges get a little browned. I boil the sauce to reduce by about a third, then add the required BBQ sauce or more, to taste. First time I made this (totally winging it) I thought "Texas brisket? Much ado over nothing", but I kept trying for the sake of my dear Texan-hearted husband and now it's one of my favorites and his!

I have tried this recipe a few times now with great success in the oven ( I don't have a smoker). Rubbing down the brisket with liquid smoke before the dry rub gives it a nice smoky flavor. I also use chopped green chiles (canned) since jalapenos have a little too much heat for my taste buds. I use a clay baker with a lid (Pampered Chef makes them), so the meat is nice and tender and juicy. Make sure you have A LOT of paprika around your house-I almost ran out this last time! This is the best brisket I've ever had-Barbeque restaurants beware!

A great recipe, although I think for a brisket of this size (mine was @ 7.5 lbs), you need closer to twelve hours in a smoker that is maintaining a constant temperature of 230-250. 185 degrees is not overcooked, but after 10 hours at a constant temperature, my brisket came of at 160 degrees. A couple more hours and it would have been perfectly tender.

Rating: 4
Sorry Hopcooks (6/2404) and Buckeye (6/2/04). You have strong opinions, but no food science to support them. Beef brisket has loads of collagen, which makes the meat tough. A higher final meat temperatures of 185 to 210 degrees gelatinizes collagen, which gives the meat much more tenderness (Reference: COOKS ILLUSTRATED, GRILLING AND BARBECUE, pp 268-271.) If you want to taste real barbecue, make it the way it is written. And yes, it does take ten hours!

Rating: 4
Yep.....I absolutely agree with Buckeye....185 degrees is waaaaaay too cooked for this particular meat. Get it off the grill (or smoker) at 140-150 and let it rest. And go easy with the sauce. It's not the sauce....it's the meat that makes this! (and the beer). Excellent recipe, easy to prepare (I keep a bag of the rub on hand at all times just in case!:) that feeds a crowd and keeps'em coming back for more!

Hey Buckeye! This is brisket, not filet mignon. The only thing I would change is the sauce. Anthing with corn syrup is nasty. Try Tallywaggers BBQ Sauce from Bath, Maine. www.tallywaggers.com

I made this using the indirect-heat method on a gas barbecue on its lowest setting. I followed the recipe exactly, otherwise. We had an 8 1/2 lb. brisket which was cooked for 12 hours (started the 'cue at 6am!)and replaced soaked mesquite chips evry 1 1/2 hours. The brisket was perfectly cooked at 6pm, juicy and very tasty.

Great with hickory or misquite. I have had the oportunity to live in Texas,Arkansa,Flordia,S. Carolina and Georgia and must confess that either of the seasoned woods hickory or misquite are great. I have a friend in Pampa Tx owner operation of a brisket Bar B Que resturant using only hickory chips and the customers there rave over it. I use a weber kettle grill. Place a metal bowl or pot in the center of grill and place the charcoal around the perimeter. Set the brisket in the center of grill to avoid direct contact with the heat for slow cooking. The most important part of this recipe is to marinate at least overnight for best results.(It is so tender) This recipe it is fantasic!!

This is a very delicious recipe! I have made this a few times and Emeril's recipe for smoked Texas brisket (foodtv.com) - both are very good, however if I had to choose, I would say this recipe is better.

Awesome recipe... and great reviews from the firemen who ate it all up! We smoked it for 10 hours, then two more wrapped in foil in the oven. The flavor was beyond compare... and manning the smoker all day sure was an exercise in self-control. The only problem we experienced was that we used two smaller briskets, and they didn't have quite the amount of fat I was looking for, so the meat came out a little dry. However, it was by far the best I've tasted in the Northern Virginia area. We used mesquite in place of hickory, and the smell of the meat cooking all day could drive one mad! We will try it again, this time with a thicker cut, and a little more fat. I just hope my taste buds can hold out until then...

This has become a tradition at our July 4th picnic. The time it takes to make it is well worth the effort. The outcome is spectacular. To make checking the meat temperature, I use a Polder temperature probe to avoid opening the lid (except to mop).

It is hard to get good brisket up here by the Canadian border. The kind with enough fat on it like in Texas. So this turned out to be a tad tougher than I like. But the flavor was wonderful!

oooooh, but this is good. A wonderful way to do a seriously classy brisket. My only change is I slather the meat with some spicy brown mustard to hold the rub on a little better, and let the meat sit with mustard/rub combo overnight before it goes into the smoker. Heaven on earth.

I made this for Mother's Day and everyone (35 of us) loved it. It was my 1st attempt at brisket and it was to die for! I planned on doing it all on the grill but it rained the Sat. before Mom's Day. I rubbed the beef up on Fri. afternoon. On Sat. I put it in a 275 degree oven, covered the disposable aluminum pan loosely with foil), did my mopping every 20 minutes and after 6 hours took it out of the oven and cooled it. I then wrapped it in foil and refrigerated it overnight. Next morning the sun was shining brightly so I soaked 3 cups of hickory chips, stoked up the big Weber Grill. I removed the foil, put the pan on the grate (using very SLOW heat), opened the vents and closed the lid. About every 45 minutes I added some more chips and smoked the meat for 3 hours. WOW! It was so good. I also made Big Al Roker's pulled pork, which was JUST as wonderful. When asked, almost everyone had a hard time deciding which they liked most.

My dinner guests were bowing at my feet after eating this brisket. Wow! This one's a no-brainer - if you want to look like a hero in front of discerning foodies, make this. But one note: count on 1 1/2 hours per pound, so an 8lb. piece of meat really takes 12 hours, not 10. I had to finish it off in the oven, but the result was still excellent.

I have made this many times in an electric water smoker. I start it late evening 10-11PM and let it go 10-12 hours. 4-5 hours is not sufficient with the low (200-225 deg) temp. water smoker. I apply mop the last thing before retiring and early in AM again. This is the best thing to date that has come out of the smoker. Company raves on about it. 8-10 hours would probably suffice if it were a day time smoke for evening meal. Meat is so tender, you have to be careful lifting it off the rack to carving board.

I am a member of the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, which hosts the world's largest BBQ cook off, have judged BBQ in local competitions, though I've never cooked it myself, I know good Q. I am in Wisconsin for the summer, had a need for Texas "stuff", so I tried this recipe. The biggest brisket obtainable was only 2.5 #, had all the fat trimmed off, and the only gas cooker available did not drop below 300 in temps, so essentially I had to wing it on a hyper active cooker! I did everything else to the letter, just faster. The result was darn near perfect anyway, with a cooking time of only 1.15 hours. The beautiful pink smoke ring, though small, is a most desireable feature of this meat. The bigger the ring, the better the Q. The flavors of the rub and the mop, married with the smoke are as true to Texas BBQ as anything I have sampled in the lone star state. A fat topped brisket and a slower smoker would have brought this to a 10 instead of 9, but my family up here LOVED IT, and actually, not slaving over a cooker all day for a similar result ain't bad! Serve on brown paper with Ranch Beans, white bread, potato salad, and BBQ sauce on the side (for those who think they need it.) Whether you are stuck with a gas grill or have charcoal, put the meat on the coolest side, use a lot of wet mesquite and mop with TLC... It's the smoke that counts! Enjoy Y'all!

I prepared this for a farewell party for my sister who is moving out of state. I prepared it using a Weber gas grill with indirect heat. I did not use the hot peppers and the beef actually tasted a bit sweet. It received raves and requests for recipes. In addition to the brisket, I prepared Al Roker's Big Bad Barbecued Pulled Pork (see todayshow.com) and the cucumber salad and two potato salad recipes found at this site. I would definately make this again and look forward to doing so. I used apple wood chips in the grill and the yard and house just smelled so nice all day!

This was great Texas barbecue!! I do not have a smoker but going by previous reviews I thought I'd try it in the oven.I used brisket that had been trimmed of fat except for one side and it was still very juicy. I left out the jalepenos since I am "heat sensitive" and proceeded with the rub as listed. I put the meat in a baking pan, covered with foil,and roasted in low and slow. (7 hrs) Every hour I basted with the mop and removed the foil after 5 1/2 hrs. I turned the meat a few times to even out the beautiful rich color.Cooled and wrap in foil,and reheated the next day.I refrigerate all the juice in pan and mixed it with a cup of Jack Daniels BBQ sauce.It was EXCELLENT. Everyone including my grandchildren loved it.A definite success that I will make again and again.

This recipe is absolutely delicious, just as is. My husband and I followed the instructions to the hilt and received rave reviews from our dinner guests. The only thing we may do differently next time, is to buy the meat with a little less fat on it.

My husband was the chef, and said he thought it still would have been enough fat to keep the meat from drying out at half the amount. Wonderful though!

Also, I used a 2:1 ratio of oak to hickory which infuses more of a Kansas City flavor(biased Kansas Citian here). I don't see how you can go wrong with this one!

I just sliced the brisket that we cooked yesterday on the smoker for 10 hours and then in the oven, tightly sealed in foil in a shallow baking pan, overnight. (Approx 12 hours) Absolutely fabulous. You can tear it apart with your fingers. Very moist with a nice dark crust. Very flavorful. We smoked this one over pecan. But, hickory is our favorite. Don't go without some oven time. It makes all the difference in an otherwise tough piece of meat. A tough brisket isn't worth eating.

Two families tried this recipe with two identical Charbroil electric smokers - one smoked for the required 10 hours, and one smoked for 5 hours followed by 5 hours in foil in a 225-degree oven. The latter was decidedly more tender - melt-in-your-mouth tender. The 10-hour smoked was chewy in comparison. We will do the smoker-oven technique in the future for sure. Over all, the beef was delicious, but this is a two-day preparation venture at the least. We did it over Super Bowl weekend. Everybody loved it.

I do not have a smoker and so I modified it for my oven. I am sure it would be incredible in the smoker, but it turned out wonderful in the oven. I cooked it 4 hours at 350 and my brisket was in two pieces and was only 6 lbs. I would make extra mop next time since the juices from the brisket in the roasting pan made the average BBQ sauce delicious. It had a wonderful crust on the edge and I sliced it thin across the grain with lots of sauce. I can't wait to make it again.

While there was some confusion over cooking a fat-covered slab of meat for 10 hours, the end result more than exceeded our expectations. The spicy crust was nicely browned, while the interior of the brisket melted in your mouth. The taste was incredible - something us Northerners don't have the occasion to sample. Five of us stuffed ourselves to the point of being uncomfortable. As far as the additional sauce is concerned - don't bother. After diligently rubbing, cooking, and mopping for 10 hours, the purchased sauce seems to cheapen and degrade the flavor of the meat. if you have 10 hours and a bag of charcoal (I used almost 10lbs) I would highly recommend this dish.

This is about as good as brisket can get. It's not really barbecue (that distinction is saved for pork) but it's tasty. All my yankee friends and the misguided Texan loved it. They were enjoying it while us good 'ol boys were chowing down on pork ribs and shoulder.

My first 4 fork recipe. Pretty much followed the recipe, with a little more spice or beer here or there. Smoked in my Brinkman's Water Smoker 4-5 hours, wrapped in foil, and baked at 325 another 1-2. Moist and delicious. Served on fresh rolls with Drunken Beans and Cole Slaw. Oh, almost forgot. I first seared the briskets directly (I mean maybe 2 inches above)over the VERY, VERY hot coals for about 5 minutes per side before placing them in the smoker. I thought this added a necessary crisp texture and appearance to the meat when served. Finally, I think I could do this in my Weber kettle grill pretty easily. Just build a small fire on one side, add some soaked hickory chips, and re-stoak as necessary for a few hours. Make up for any lost time on the grill with more time in the oven. Watch the smoking temperature with a cheap store bought oven thermometer. Remember, Low & Slow.

My main scientific culinary research is all the variables on this rock for Texas Barbeque - focusing on the brisket! Dont ask me how I became so deranged, it just happened when I tasted my very first brisket at a friend's friend's barbeque. The missing ingredients to call this a slam-bang Texas authorized brisket is BEER ! Under NO circumstance (Well, maybe total poverty) would I consider cooking a brisket in a mop that does not contain beer... and as I said, I am a dedicated scientist to cooking brisket ala smoker. ( I also comiserate over corned beef production :) My very favorite recipe uses 2 1/2 oz of whole peppercorns ground up in an electric coffee mill. I then perform a sacrelige to many Texas brisket cooks, and remove all but 1/4 inch of the fat on the packer brisket, and flat cut the halves of the brisket into separates, and begin coating them with olive oil. The pepper coating and dried garlic go on quite liberally next. Then it is smoked over hickory and a very hot fire to sear the meat for no more than 1O minutes first side and 15 the second side. It is then placed in double wrapped aluminum foil with my recipe of spices, that include, worchestershire sauce, one and a half to two beers of choice (dark for me), and half a dozen of Popeye's (The New Orleans chicken chain) barbeque sauce 'tubs'. - Since they dont sell the sauce bottled... I also add three to four tablespoons of chushed fresh or chopped bottled garlic, like from Wal*Mart... I have tried cooking in a vertical grill/smoker, but only a horizontal, like the ones that appear to be made from a 55 gal drum, really work well. I have modified mine a bit, and you'd have to see rather than me try to explain. After the meat is removed from searing, the fire is allowed to cool (300-250 degrees) and it is kept there using a 'chimney' to add a few hot coals to keep it up for about 8 to 10 hours. YEE -haw ! -that's Texan for 'Bon Appetit'

Love this brisket and the fact that it is so easy to make. I use 3-4 pound brisket and cook on outdoor smoker for about 6-8 hours. It doesn't get much better!

I cooked 10 briskets for a party using this recipe and it was devoured by everyone and it left them hollering for MORE !!!! I would definitely recommend it to anyone. I cooked them in the oven with Liquid Smoke and then finished them up in a huge smoker. It was delicious!

soulful stuff. i prepared the brisket by using a stove-top smoker. Cameron's makes a sturdy, easy-to-use smoker for about 50 bucks. You can order it from www.chefscatalog.com. Smoking a 7 1/2 lb. piece of meat was no problem and the smell in your house, i swear, must descend directly from Heaven.

I made this for my lady's family, who are all from Alabama, S. Carolina and Texas. Being from Illinois, I was a bit nervous about making "barbeque" for critics with their credentials. They all raved about it for the better part of a week. It was the best brisket I've ever tasted.

Yum, yum! It's almost a sacrilege, but this is even better than Sonny Bryan's (when Sonny was in the kitchen!)
