This is my favorite of all the pissaladiere recipes out there because of the puff pastry crust, so easy to handle. For fussy eaters, I sometimes cover the crust with anchovy paste or finely diced sun dried tomatoes. Can be made in advance, frozen, and reheated. Served in 1 1/2 inch squares, it feeds dozens.

delicious. replaced the puff pastry with whole foods herb pizza dough, and covered it in a thin layer of anchovy paste instead of using the fillets. told my guests it was a french tart with carmelized onions and olives so as not to put off anyone who thinks they don't like anchovies. served in squares, it was the most popular of all my xmas eve hors d'oeuvres.

I used this as an appetizer at my new years party and it was well received. However, I think some people are turned off by the anchovie and dicing them finely might be another option

The best. Fun to make. I prepared early in the day and and then reheated b3 serving. Key is to slice onions as thinly as possible -- used madoline sp).

Delicious! Instead of using puff pastry, I used a frozen tart shell. I found the added sugar not really necessary as the onions are naturally sweet. Great dish for Sunday brunch with a green salad.

I made this using my favorite focaccia recipe for the crust. Sweet and salty... very nice.

I made this recipe (twice) for a sparkling wine tasting party and guests kept rapturously exclaiming about how delicious it was (anchovies and all.) I don't think it was cooked properly, however, as the crust was quite soggy, especially in the middle. Perhaps my oven wasn't hot enough, or the onions not dry enough. But nobody seemed to care about the goopiness as they swooned over the taste. I was afraid it might be hard to serve in small pieces, but it cut beautifully, and two recipes gave 50 people ample tastes! It was paired, by the way, with a lovely Prosecco.

This is a fabulous, relatively easy-to-prepare recipe. The tart is not often seen here. The combination of the sweet onions, salty anchovies and flaky pastry is delicious.
