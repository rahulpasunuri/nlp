I took this in a different direction, using preserved lemons I'd made and leaving out the chickpeas and apricot--though that does sound good--and using Aleppo pepper. Totally different flavors but the basic recipe is a keeper.

Only found this stew so-so. Not sure I would make it again, although the tart balanced with the sweet nicely. Didn't have the peppers so tried to substitute with paprika + chili powder. As someone mentioned earlier, get the peppers! www.markethallfoods.com/products.php?product=Maras-and-Urfa-Pepper&gclid=CIaSo_KVhLQCFQmCQgodCiQAWQ

Really good. Couldn't find the special peppers in a special market in Houston. Now I'm on a mission!

I made this Lamb stew last night up here in the Rocky mountains. It is a delicious and definitely a keeper!

Taking a leaf from several posts regarding this recipe calling for way too much Chicken Stock, I poured 7 cups in large pot and reduced it 50%. This created a more concentrated, and tastier, stock. I think this did the trick as the finished amount was perfect. I also strongly recommend sourcing the Maras and Urfa peppers. WOW. What wonderful spices. A beautiful body warming effect. Very tasty as well. The pops of currants was also an excellent addition to the dish. The only deviation I made was replacing the potatoes with Winter Carrots. Less starch and I found them to pair with this dish very very well. No one missed the potatoes. A superb dish, this one. We'll surely prepare this again!

Delicious. Used 4 C of stock and it was plenty. Forgot to add the oregano and lemon before serving and was still delicious. Used Pakrika and Ancho chili powders- yum!

I had to make a few alterations since I cooked this rather on the fly, but it came out absolutely incredible anyway. I didn't have any chickpeas or anything apricot on hand so I left those items out. I added about 2 tbsp of sugar since I was missing the sweetness of the preserves. And instead of the peppers I subbed in 1 tsp of crushed chili peppers. I also used homemade chicken stock. This was finger-licking good. I ended up with a thick, rich sauce over the potatoes and lamb and it was heavenly! I'll most definitely be making it again!

The result was really nice. We enjoyed the Turkish spices and can use them with yogurt dishes. On thing was that the recipe was a little more difficult than it needed to be. Good:)

Two notes - the way the recipe is written, when it says "stir in stock... and spices" I thought it meant to add ALL the spices but what it really meant was only to add SOME of the spices - so be forewarned! Also - I don't know what went wrong but my stew is so, so watery!! and i only used 4 cups of chicken broth (vs the 7 they suggest). any ideas??

Tasty. I didn't have the Maras or Urfa pepper either and followed the suggestion to use paprika and pepper flakes. Did have a nice hotness to it, am curious to see what it would be like with the ingredients as called for. All other ingredients as specified in recipe. Mine came out soupy. I'll try 5 cups of water next time.

I used leftover leg of lamb, cut up, pretty much followed the recipe other than that. Did not have the peppers either, used some red pepper flakes (probably 1/4 teaspoon). Very good! Not a very pretty dish, but so tasty. I'm always stuck for a leftover lamb dish, and this really did work.

Unlike the previous reviewer, I felt like it needed a little more chicken stock - maybe my stove was at a higher temperature. I made this as described, with whatever dried apricots were in my local grocery, and served it alone (not with rice). I thought it was great and enjoyed the leftovers twice already.

I ordered the Maras and Urfa peppers online from Markethall Foods, and this stew was fabulous. I may have cut the lamb chunks a little bigger than specified, but it took a good two hours on top of the stove simmering before the lamb was tender enough, and I only used 5 cups of the chicken stock. I don't think 7 cups was needed. This recipe will definitely be repeated in our house!

I didn't have time to search for Maras or Urfa pepper, so I just added about a teaspoon of paprika instead. I also used dried oregano. It was delicious! I simmered it for about 2 hours longer than it specified, and the lamb was delightfully tender. I'm making it again tomorrow for my dinner club. This is definitely a keeper, even without the special peppers!
