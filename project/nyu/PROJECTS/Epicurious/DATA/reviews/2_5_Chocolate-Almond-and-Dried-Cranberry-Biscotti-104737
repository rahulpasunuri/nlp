These were very tasty - I don't know why the recipe got so many negative reviews! I followed the directions for the dough to the letter and everything came together quite nicely, though I think the cookies could benefit from the addition of chocolate chips. I didn't dunk them in the white chocolate. I did find the finished cookies tasted a little too much of baking soda, but I don't know that I would reduce the amount, as it would affect the rising of the dough...Otherwise, I consider them a success. Yum.

I have made this recipe twice now. First time as written except omitting the white chocolate dip; this time substituting dried cherries for cranberries and adding 1/2 c. high quality chocolate chips. I don't like biscotti this large, so I cut them in 1/2" slices and they're better for dunking ;-) Will make it again, for sure!

Wowee, as my 17 month old would say. We lOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe. I'm surprised at all the wah-wah negative reviews. I am not an accomplished baker by any means. I made these for the first itme in 2003 in Dallas (low altitude) and everyone who sampled them loved them. Now I live in Denver - high altitude - and I added more flour and diminished the sugar a bit, and same results! Everyone loves them, and I find them very easy to make. I prefer them over the '98 recipe people on this site were raving about. Those taste like sugary white bread compared to these, in my opinion. Happy baking! Jennifer

Try: 2 cups flour (omit cocoa powder) Reduce sugar to 1/2 cup Reduce eggs to 2 large Increase Butter to 1/2 cup (1 stick) Reduce baking soda to 3/4 tea spoon Also, toast almonds before mixing in. Add a small amount of shortening to white chocolate, which makes it easier for dipping.

I coudn't get the white chocolate to melt enough to dip. I think I would like these better without the cocoa.

I have made many different biscotti recipes, and this rates at the bottom in terms of amount of effort for the return. The dough was very hard to handle, and stuck to the beaters, bowl, and hands -- resulting in lots of waste. Agree that the Dec. 98 biscotti are much better!

Reading the reviews...I wouldn't bother. PLEASE try the other 1998 White Chocolate and Cranberry Biscotti. They are the first recipe I've tried and they're gorgeous. My boyfriend thinks I'm a gem for them!

This recepie turns out very tasty biscotti, I put in one teaspoon baking soda and one teaspoon baking powder instead of two teaspoons bakins soda. Or even half a teaspoon of each. I really like this biscotti, I make it all the time and give it away to my friends and family.

I prefer other recipes to this one. Something seems 'off' with the ingredients...too much baking soda?

This was my first attempt at biscotti, and although I made quite a mess in the kitchen preparing them, the end result was tasty, chocolaty and crunchy. The dried cranberries and white chocolate dip are nice touches. These also keep very well.

I had never made biscotti before and I was weary about how these would turn out. the bottoms of the biscotti seemed too dark, almost burnt. I don't like white chocolate so I tried to use dark bittersweet chocolate instead but I couldn't get it to melt smoothly. It was problem after problem with these. After all is said and done, these are tasty but not very pretty. I'd try to make another type of biscotti before I made these again.
