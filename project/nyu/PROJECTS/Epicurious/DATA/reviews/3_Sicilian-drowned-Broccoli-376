I inherited a cookbook from my Calabrese MIL. It has this recipe for "broccoli", which calls (of course) for cauliflower. The recipe calls for slicing the cauliflower, onion and olives, layering the ingredients, covering with the red wine and then cooking slowly in the covered dutch oven on the stove-top. No blanching or sauteing in preparation, just layer and simmer. Our family loves this recipe. The simmered flavors create this uniquely umami deliciousness that I find addictive. Note: with the olives, cheese and anchovies, one need only add pepper to taste. There's plenty of salt in the ingredients. Enjoy!

This was the most unusual broccoli dish I have ever made. It was not very pleasant looking but everyone loved the flavor. I will make it again because everyone will ask for it. We were eating it cold as a snack in the evening. It is obvious that this dish would not be good for the unadventurous.

Okay boys and girls. Let's get those overalls buttoned up. I agree with Kenosha, jersey girl. Get a life. Italian dialects change from one side of the town to the other. Don't be such a narrow-minded snob. Broccoli in English pretty much refers to one specific veggie, although this recipe is very adaptable. For those of you who complained that the veggies were too done - well, if you like your veggies al dente - cook them that way! Don't cook them till they're dead and then complain about it. If your veggies are bitter, are you cooking in aluminum? Aluminum reacts with acids, leaving food bitter. All that aside, we loved this dish. We often make it with a variety of veggies and it always comes out well.

I have been making this dish for two years. My husband I I LOVE it, and those we make it for ask for the recipe. I don't know how this ended up with just a 42%. It was much higher when I firts made it, that is wht I feel compelled to give it my high praises now. For the lady from N.J. Drop the attitude. I'm from N.Y. and I'm Italian (1/2 Sicilian). Try the recipe before you getting on your high horse.

Beg to differ, but broccoli IS called sparaceddi... cauliflower is known as broccoli in Italian.

I AM SICILIAN BORN.I HAVE MADE THIS RECIPE FOR 25 YEARS, AND MY MOTHER ALL OF HER LIFE. THIS IS MY FAVORITE WAY TO EAT BROCCOLI, AS MATTER OF FACT I I HAVE SOME LEFT OVER IN THE FRIDGE RIGHT NOW. THE BROCCOLI ARE SUPPOSE TO BE OVER COOKED. ITALIANS LIKE THEIR VEGITABLES THAT WAY. BY THE WAY, I ONLY MAKE THIS IN WINTER TIME.

This sounded like it would be wonderful. Yuck! We hated it, broccoli ended up mushy and pale and the flavor was bland.

I was disappointed with this recipe. The broccoli cooks far too long to remain flavorful or colorful. A possible fix would be reducing wine separately, and adding the cheese and broccoli for a very short time. All in all, I would not try this again.

As a first generation Sicilian I have one comment to make and it's a linguistic one: As any Sicilian can tell you Sparaceddi are SMALL ASPARAGUS! ! ! Any Sicilian word ending in "ceddi" is small and "Spara" has its origin in Asparaghi (plural) or Asparago (singular)- ASPARAGUS. How this has been transformed into broccoli I haven't a clue. If anything, in Sicilian, Cauliflower is often referred to as "broccolo". By the way, I'm not even going to bother making this as I don't see the need to. I grew up eating Sicilian food.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I agree that the broccoli could be considered overcooked, but in the dead of winter it works well. As spring arrives, I will reduce the cooking times gradually, to see how it adjusts. This is a keeper, even if I discover that it only works during cold weather.

I made this last Christmas with Broccolini and Broccoli Rabe. I also cut the cooking time so it wasn't mushy. It came out so good!

OK, but a little too heavy for my tastes. The broccoli gets really mushy, and the cheese blends in with the wine really well. I served it a a dinner party and most of the guests were ambivelent about it. One who likes really fatty foods and overcooked vegetables loved it.
