I used a combination of 1/3 less fat, fat free and regular cream cheese. Overall, the cake lacked any sort of lime flavor, the crust (which was by far the best part) stuck to the pan and was very buttery. The flavor was pretty bland. If I have to use just whole fat cream cheese for success, then I would rather not make this again. I was pretty disappointed. Two forks because I did alter the recipe.

I thought the suggestion of adding lime zest to the crust was strange, and didn't do it the first time. Still good cake, but added zest on second cake - great. Also added much more lime. Lime zest in sour cream topping browns and looks ugly. served this with the lemon lime sauce from this site, using mostly limes. Great!

I have made this recipe numerous times using equal parts Splenda instead of Sugar and it is wonderful. I use a little less Splenda and Butter with the Almonds for the crust than what the recipe calls for. It makes a great low carb dessert with no artificial sweetner after taste when you use Splenda.

I tried this with key limes and had to up the juice to give it a proper tang. It's a perfect gluten-free desert!

I accidentally made this with a 9" pan instead of a 10", but even so, it turned out great. I increased the bake time just a little (5 minutes more before topping, 2 minutes more after topping) but I allowed it to cool for a while before refrigeration to keep the baking going. Feel free to whip the cheese filling a lot, because that makes the baked cake fluffier. Doubling the lime juice was a good idea, but keep the zest confined to the crust. I put zest in the topping, and it made the topping look like chives in a sour cream dip. The crust turns out like marzipan, which is tasty, but I would actually make it thicker than suggested next time because it broke apart easily.

This made an excellent make ahead dessert for Easter. Loved the (gluten free) crust. Doubled the lime in both the filling and the topping for a little more zip. Will definitely make again.

I selected this recipe for the high protein ingredients, great for south beachers and adkins to splurge on. I used 1 pound cream cheese and 1lb. ricotta to lower fat. I cut the sugar in half, as to lower the carb count and it was not missed. The second time I made it, I omitted the almond extract, it was too strong and added nothing to this delicious cake.

Would I make this dish again? I always do! This cheesecake is one of the staples in my dessert repertoire, it gets as many raves as the Turtle Swirl Cheesecake recipe also on epicurious. The combination of creamy and tart with just a touch of zing is magnificent! I haven't yet tried it low-fat, but when I do I will let you know how it turns out!

I love this recipe and have made it 3 times, following suggestions here to up the lime juice and zest content for added zing. My one BIG concern with it however, is the recommendation to "put the cheesecake immediately in the refrigerator". This is a big no-no - putting something virtually straight from the oven into the fridge will raise the temperature of the fridge interior and risks spoiling all the other food items in there. I let the cheesecake cool to room temperature before chilling and it's been perfect.

This was really delicious. I was looking for a gluten-free dessert for a holiday dinner and this cheesecake was perfect. I made a change - added grated lime zest to the topping and a drop of food coloring to the filling for a hint of green color. The cheesecake was light in texture and the crust was not at all heavy despite the use of nuts. The almond extract in the topping was a pleasant flavor when partnered with the lime filling. Very very good!

This was an excellent cheesecake. Just like a fine resturant would make. I used the suggesstions of those before me and doubled the lime use to 3T and used the zest for 2 limes. I also halfed the sour cream topping, however, I would not do that again because it didn't cover my 9' pan very well. I tried the Half graham and half almond crust and it was alittle too nutty for me so next time I'll do about 3/4 graham and 1/4 almond. I might toast them before hand too. But this was delicious, very refreshing.

I used fresh-squeezed key limes (yellow in color so they were sweeter) and doubled the amount in both filling and topping, adding zest of a regular lime as well...taking the suggestions posted. The taste was too mild; not enough tanginess at all. Put zest in the crust and used half almonds and half graham crackers and that was great. Filling had a kind of cloying mouth feel. I like the cheesecake recipes in Betty Rosbottom's "Cooking School Cookbook" so may dink with one of them using lime until I can make a lime cheesecake better than this one.

I made the crust with half almond cookies and half almonds. For topping: 8 ounce container sour cream, two tablespoons of vanilla sugar, zest of two limes, and the almond essence. The zest made the topping really look nice. Next time I'll make it exactly the same way! My sister always makes her own 'applecake' at birthday parties, but now she wants to make this cheesecake, too!!! Be sure to make this one day ahead; the next day it really tastes a hundred times better!!!!

This cheesecake tasted really good. Because I had so many extra limes from my tree, I thought this would be a great recipe and it was! Even though I doubled the amount of juice and added zest, I think it could take more. I served it for a dessert to people who were gluten intolerant. The almond crust turned out perfect. No need to add graham crackers. I added strawberries when served. This one is a keeper!

I followed some former reviewers' advice and increased the lime juice & zest, and made a half almond half graham cracker crust. This cheesecake is by far, the best cheesecake I've ever eaten. And everyone I've served it to, even people who don't eat dessert, request slices to take home. It's a resounding success. Make it!

Made this recipe for a small, Spring dinner get together. Very, very simple to make and comes out with a wonderfully light texture. The sour cream topping also helps give the cheesecake a perfect look...covering any cracks that may have shown up during baking. I did, however, add my own raspberry sauce (pureed berries, lemon juice, confectioners sugar) as others suggested and was glad I did. Even in doubling the lime juice for the cake the flavor still seemed a little oversubtle for me. Without the sauce it may have been bland. But with? Wonderful!

I have made many cheescakes from this website and this one is definetly the best. Don't be afraid to make the almond crust. It is worth every bite. I took the advice of other reviewers and made a raspberry sauce and the pairing was delicious. I give this 4 stars.

I copied other reviewers and used equal amounts of almonds and graham cracker crumbs, doubled the amount of lime juice in both the cheesecake and the topping and garnished with a swirl of raspberry puree. It was a huge hit following a Mexican dinner.

A great recipe; a very creamy cheesecake and not too heavy. After reading the other reviews I made my crust 1/2 almond and 1/2 graham cracker and added approx. 1 tsp grated lime zest to the crust. I doubled the lime juice in the filling. I topped the cheesecake with candied lime zest. It looked nice and added additional lime flavor.

I made this cheesecake for my assistant and she liked it so much she asked for it two years in a row. I did add extra lime juice and rind but I also added a raspberry sauce which was made of pureed raspberries (12oz frozen) with two tsp. of sugar added. It was really good !!!

I followed the advice from the folks below (thanks) added lime zest to the crust which I made 1/2 almonds 1/2 graham. Doubled the lime juice mixing Key lime and fresh. I also melted some semi-sweet chocolate chips and pressed it through a pinhole in a baggie to decorate the top. Added additional zest. It was a fantastic hit! Thanks!

I must be picky but using regular fresh lime juice had no flavor and the crust over powered the cheesecake. There are better recipes out there!

I made several changes: 1. Made a graham cracker crust adding 1/2 teaspoon lime zest. 2. Doubled the amount of lime juice called for in the filling and added the zest of one lime. 3. Omitted the almond in the topping, and increased the lime juice to 1 1/2 tablespoons. 4. Baked it in a 9-inch springform pan. This made it extra thick, and I had to adjust the baking time a bit, but I love my cheesecakes TALL! Results were FABTABULOUS!!!! Everyone raved. Heard comments such as "This is the best cheesecake I've ever had!" Will be making this one again!

THIS WAS WONDERFUL and easy to make. I used part key lime and part regular lime juice. Also used lots of fresh lime peel and extra juice. When I took it out of the oven it was still quite runny but firmed up after it was in the refrig. over nite. A DEFINITE keeper!!!

This cake is wonderful! Creamy and tangy are great qualities for all summer recipes, and this one does the trick. Everyone I know loved it. Plus it's super easy to make. But i confess...in the South we love zesty anything, so I doubled the lime!

I admit to having made this recipe for several years before it appeared in Gourmet--the recipe was submitted by my mother!!! I always fancied myself quite a baker, and have made some very outstanding cheesecakes. But, this is the one my friends always ask for over and over again. Thanks, Mom!

this recipe was easy and delicious. i omitted the almond essence as i found it too overpowering. i think the crust was a bit too moist and from now on i would bake the crust briefly before adding the filling. everyone in my house loved it.

This was unbelievable!!!! I made it for Passover (it didn't require any flour or graham crackers) and it received raves!! Since I like a stronger lime taste I doubled the lime juice to 3 Tbsp and added the grated lime zest of one lime. My sister said I could win a contest with this recipe but I told her that would seem dishonest since it was your recipe!!!

Very good and quite tangy. The store was out of limes so I used lemons instead. The family loved it.

I made this cheesecake for a St. Patricks Day celebration at my office. It got rave reviews from everyone except my husband: I fogot to save him a piece! I thought about adding green food coloring to the cheese mixture, but settled for lime zest.
