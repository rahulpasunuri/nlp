A nice variation on asparagus and so easily prepared. I too found that it cooked too quickly for all the liquid to evaporate. Removed the asparagus with a slotted spoon after it softened, then boiled down the remaining liquid on high heat and poured the little that was left over the asparagus. Also, I used almond slivers, as I did not have sliced. Really great side dish.

This was quite good for how simple it was. I served it for my gourmet group along with a beef tenderloin roast and the 'Baked Mashed Potatoes and Yams with Garlic and Parmesan.' Since I tripled the recipe, the butter/water mixture did not reduce in the time it took for the asparagus to cook, so I poured most of it out and then added the other ingredients. It was still very good.

Quick, easy, and all around delicious! This made asparagus lovers out of two doubters! Yum!

Very nice, simple side dish. As recommended by others, I lengthened the cooking time to reduce the glaze. We all, including my 2 yr old, enjoyed this dish. I will certainly make again.

Really easy to prepare, but the sauce was definitely not a "glaze" when the directions were followed. Will make it again because it is good enough for an everyday meal, maybe I will try cooking them longer next time to reduce sauce to a glaze.

The asparagus was delicious cooked this way, and this method will probably lend itself to other vegetables as well. The 3 minute simmer time is way off - I simmered mine covered for about 2 minutes to get the cooking started, then uncovered for about 15 minutes before the liquid finally cooked away. But when it did, it left a delicious buttery and caramelized flavor on the vegetables.

Delicious and very easy to make. I too found that it took longer than 3 minutes to simmer. I used lemon juice concentrate, about 1 1/2 tablespoons, as I did not have any fresh lemons on hand. Served with grilled chicken and mashed potatoes, this side dish rounded out the meal very well!

Maybe its what we had the asparagus with, but I didn't find this dish particuarly special in taste, however, I would say that for an asparagus dish, its not bad.

Crunchy and delicious. My 6 year old daughter LOVES asparagus and liked this very much, especially the toasted almonds.

Maybe it was my cooktop or maybe it was my idea of "simmer" but this took more than three minutes. Finally poured off much of the liquid. The results were tasty and tender crisp.

I liked this recipe very much, except next time I will wait until right before serving to add the almonds. They ended up a tad soggy, even after toasting them.

This has to be the best fresh asparagus recipe ever. Few ingredients, simple to prepare, easy to cook, and fast! Oh yes, a clove of slivered garlic added to the water/butter about a minute before adding the asparagus worked well also. I will make it again - many times.

Fantastic lite fare. Great w/ the Bacon wrapped filets I grilled. Would recomend it to anyone!

Very tasty. Be careful not to overcook the asparagus (I did the first time) because it will ruin the dish. Would definitely repeat this recipe again and again.

I made this dish for a dinner party of 12 and everyone loved it. Instead of using water and butter I prepared it using chicken stock instead making it a bit more heart healthy. Lemon juice is the key to this dish. I ended up adding quite a bit more than the recipe called for and it was great.

A simple recipe, tastes great if you like asparagus. Should be an accompaniment to seafood or steak.
