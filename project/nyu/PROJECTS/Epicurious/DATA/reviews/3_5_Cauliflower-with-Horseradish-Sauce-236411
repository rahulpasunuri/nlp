I laughed at the white vegetable/white sauce comments, but I sensed they were right. So I made this dish with a prepared horseradish which has beets in it - very red. After mixing it with the sour cream, well, my cauliflower is cotton candy colored. It's "visually arresting," all right...

Very unusual dish. My guests liked it a lot, and this was a group that was not terribly enamored with cauliflower.

I will usually volunteer to bring this to a dinner with friends. It takes two minutes and is always a hit.

I made this for Thanksgiving Dinner and it was so yummy. I prepared the Horseradish Sauce the night before and it was a great accompanyment to the cauliflower.

This was good but not great, not noteworthy. I'm still looking for a cauliflower recipe that is outstanding. I agree with the reviewer who commented "how visually arresting can it be, with a white sauce on a white vegetable", but I had fresh dill and cauliflower on hand and thought, what the heck, i'll try it. I probably would not try it again.

This dish was delish! Make sure you drain the cauliflower well before you plate it, otherwise the sauce will be more watery than you may like it. Which brings me to my nxt suggestion of cutting back on the water in the sauce and serve with steak! Mmmm!

We eat our veggies no matter what, but this is wonderful treat. I'm adding more horseradish than called for and mixing it with Panko. I used of combination of colby and cheddar because that's what I had in the frig and it was better than the first time. Forget the wedges, they fall apart. I steam the cauliflower first and let it fall where it may in the sauce.

this is a real easy pleaser. If you have a horseradish crowd, add a little extra...it was a big hit

Really interesting and delicious . . . the perfect complement to a heavy red meat dish. The kick of the horseradish goes nicely with the slight bitterness of the cauliflower. But definitely allow the cauliflower to cool a bit before adding the sauce. Otherwise, it'll be runny.

Maybe I did something totally wrong...I don't know...but this made me gag it was so bad. I think the warm cauliflower with the sauce did not mix, and I don't know why they call it "visually arresting". It was a white sauce on a white vegetable. Not to mention, the taste of the horseradish was completely drowned out. The obly thing I did different was use a low-fat sour cream, but everything else was exactly the same. Next time I'll just use butter and cheese, which is much better.

Versatile. I used all listed ingredients to make the sauce but didn't bother measuring them. Tasted. Used frozen cauliflower. Why? Most of the time I cook for myself. Loved the final creation.
