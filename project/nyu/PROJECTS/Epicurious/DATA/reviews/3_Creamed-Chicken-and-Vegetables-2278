Great, easy weeknight recipe. We added sherry, a little extra cream, some white truffle oil and it seemed to improve the flavor. Next time we will try baking it to thicken the sauce a little.

My guests loved this served with a hearty bread. I made this using the recipe but replaced the whipping cream with 1/2 cup sherry. I poached the chicken in water, salt and pepper and used the broth to thin out the soup. I also added some cooked vermicelli, this makes a hearty soup.

I thought this was delicious! I don't normally like my own cooking, but this one even I liked. I live in South Korea and can't get Cream of chicken soup so I used cream of mushroom. I also didn't have tarragon and used dried thyme. I also added about 2 cups of dried mushrooms after soaking them in chicken broth. Excellent. I couldn't say it was a dish beyond compare, but I definetely will serve it many times again.

I subbed onions for leeks and halved the herbs. Also added celery and peas and served over biscuits. Made for a group of 35 and everyone liked it.

I made this tonight for dinner. I added chopped onion, peas, and mushrooms as a few other readers suggested. I also added frozen sweet corn which really added some flavor. Although I did enjoy this dish, I wasn't overwhelmed by the taste. It seemed that something was missing. Don't get me wrong, it was good and my husband really liked it. That's why I rated it 3 forks-I probably would have rated it 2 myself.

Mmmmmmm! I made this tonight for my husband and my friend who is a WONDERFUL cook. I can't cook to save my life. This *was* foolproof, and scrumptious. My friend told me it was absolutely delicious (big compliment) and we finished off the whole pot. My husband NEVER asks for seconds. My husband told me repeatedly how good it was. Even I liked it (I rarely like my own cooking). What I did differently was take another cook's idea here and used half a cup of 1% milk (instead of whipping cream) and it was yummy and creamy. I also used less tarragon and rosemary than the recipe called for, omitted the potatoes, used an onion in place of leeks, and also added a touch of lemon juice as suggested here, also. I served it over rice with a side of steamed broccoli to give it color, and I noticed my husband cutting it up and adding it to his dish.

I made this as a base, with out the leeks. At the last 5 min. of cooking I added left over lobster, frozen shrimp, fresh scollops and par boiled haddock. I served it as a stew with buttermilk biscuts. It was out of this world. This is a keeper

I was looking for the cream chicken recipe that my mother made....I don't think this is it. I think it is missing red bell pepper, plus I thought that you were supposed to heat olive oil or butter, saute peppers, onions, shredded carrot, and mushrooms, then add flour to let it thicken a little bit. Then you add milk and cooked chicken at some point. And salt and pepper. This also works well with left over turkey, and I think my mom sometimes used left over chicken soup for the ingredients.

I really enjoyed this dish. My whole family just loved it. I did add baby peas for color and it was great. If you're in a hurry and want an easy meal, this is it. Thanks!!!

I thought this was just o.k., I used all of the fresh herbs, added quite a bit of salt and pepper, extra garlic, used onion instead of leeks and just felt it was lacking something. Will have additional chances to doctor it, though, since I doubled the recipe based on good reviews and froze the leftovers!

This is a nice week night recipe. Cooks up easily, and my kids loved it!

This is true comfort food. A tad bland but thats what makes it comforting. I also used milk instead of cream and didn't miss it. I like that it makes enough to put leftovers in the freezer for a quick meal later. And hey, my three year old ate it!

This recipe was just wonderful. I did, however, use milk instead of cream and it was still plenty creamy and a little less caloric! I also used only rosemary, and not quite as much as called for, and it was fabulous.

I did like this dish. The herbs made the house smell wonderful. However, the herbs were too overpowering in this dish. I used dry herbs and it was just too much. I like my food to taste like food, with just a hint of herbs to make the dish pleasurable. All I could taste in this dish were the rosemary and tarragon. I will make it again, just cut down on the amount of spice. We ate it over rice, which was good with the sauce, but weird to eat rice and potatoes together-a lot of starch.

Delicious and hearty! I added mushrooms, onions, and extra garlic. Reheats well and has a nice combination of flavors.

I cook every night, and it's not just a simple entree; I try to make each meal well worth the effort. So, when I pass on a good food tip or recipe, it has to pass my high standards of what tastes as good as it either looks or sounds. This recipe is one of those! This is a great and simple recipe for cold evenings; sort of comfort food! I doubled up on the vegetables and also added peas to the dish. I've made this several times and have had requests for the recipe each time someone new tries it. My family loves it over edd noodles and you will too!

My two boys looked at this and said, "Yuk." They tasted it (which they have to do before refusing to eat anything) and said "YUM!" We all loved it. Leeks give it a great flavor. I added some green Tabasco for zip. Try it.

What a great recipe! Easy to make, great tasting, with tons of options - put it over bisquits, rice, noodles, make a chicken pot pie, leave it thin and eat as a soup. Although the recipe calls for cooked chicken, I just put 1/2 inch pieces of boneless chicken in with the broth and let the chicken cook in the broth. Added some peas. Mushrooms would also be good. Wonderful comfort food.

Great comfort food. Using fresh herbs is your best bet, has much more flavor.

I would have to agree that the recipe as is, has a lot left to be desired. But, it is extremely easy and leaves a lot of room for improvement. I took one of the other suggestions and used scallions in stead of leeks. I also put in a little extra garlic. I needed to add salt to bring out more taste, but I will be interested to see what others will do to improve this recipe. It has the makings of a great weekday meal.

I made this recipe twice before deciding. We love it! Comfort food at its best. I did add a squirt of fresh lemon to "perk up" the flavor. Also added more tarragon and rosemary because we like the flavors.

Yum! So easy to make and great comfort food on a chilly evening. I added peas to mine and it was wonderful. I also had enough to freeze for an easy dinner another evening. My husband was disappointed not to have the left overs in the fridge for his lunch the next day.

One of my only 4-fork rated reviews! I don't understand how this dish turned out bland for anyone. Not only was it big in flavor, I made a very low fat version that should have been horribly bland! *lol* I made the following substitutions: 2 Tablespoons Fat free, Lactose free margarine Scallions instead of Leeks 1 TBS crushed garlic (no shame in using jar garlic; there's no difference and it's *much* easier!:) 1 10 3/4 oz can Low fat condensed cream of chicken soup 1/2 cup Fat Free milk instead of whipping cream! It turned out great. The flavors melded nicely and my family of 4 cleaned the pot. Definitely a winner!!

Oh , yum. Comfort food! I'm a terrible cook and rarely make a decent meal for my family, but even my children loved it! If I can make this , anyone can!

This is a very easy to make dish. You can't mess it up! The problem is that once your done, it is a boring uneventful dish. I would rather try a new recipe that has the potential to be really great than try this average one again.

Man this was good. I felt a little funny about using cream of chix soup--seems sort white trashy. I was wrong. This dish tasted great; my wife and polished it off in two meals--and I didn't half it. I think it would make a good filling for chix pot pie as well. Peas would work if you swing that way. Great comfort food.

This is so yummy and a big family favorite! Even my three year old likes it, especially over biscuits. I like to freeze half so that I have a no-brainer dinner on hand.

I made this dish tonight after my daughters softball game ( they lost). But we won with this dish! What was great was that I had everything on hand, ( onios for leeks).I did put more carrots in. Also it would be great with rice, we had biscuits. Serve with crusty bread to soak up the broth!!!

This recipe was so easy to prepare and so BIG in taste. My family just couldn't get enough. Next time I plan to double the recipe so we can have left-overs for lunch the next day!
