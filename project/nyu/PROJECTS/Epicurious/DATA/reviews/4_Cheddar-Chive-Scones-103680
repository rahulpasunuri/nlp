The only change I made to this receipt was to add some small pieces of ham and making rounds instead of wedges. The cream for brushing did nothing, as they did not brown on top and the bottoms were overcooked. Overall, they were hard and not particularly tasting considering I used Extra-Old Cheddar cheese. P.S. I have a brand-new oven, so don't understand the over-cooking on the bottoms. I might try this again and use an egg wash on top rather than the cream and cook at 350 instead of 400. Just mediocre.

This recipe is AMAZING!!! I made 16 scones and they didn't even last 24 hours in a house with 3 (relatively health-conscious) people. Literally could not resist them. A few little things we switched up- we added fresh rosemary and thyme from the garden which was a great addition. We also sprinkled a little garlic powder and extra shreds of cheddar to the tops of the scones before we baked them- excellent idea, definitely do that. Lastly we served them with Prociutto. I will absolutely be making these again- and hopefully I will have enough self control to leave a few for my family :)

I made these this morning for a change on Sunday breakfast. This did not fail. I loved this for so many reasons, it was fast to put together, while it baked I finished the rest of breakfast and it was just the right combination of cheese & chives. The texture was actually a cross between a scone and a biscuit. Hubby and son thought this was amazing and are thrilled that we have leftovers.

I used Kraft brand sharp cheddar with these. If I make them again, I will follow the other reviewer's advice and use a very high quality sharp cheddar, possibly even a smoked cheddar. I will also use less chives, because I felt they were a little overpowering. Finally I would add some cayenne and/or mustard powder for flavor.

I found the cooking time to be quite off and the flavour to be fairly drab. Disappointed considering the reviews. I really enjoy the ginger scones on this site much better!

I made these for the first time last night but I'm going to be making them regularly from this point forward. They are delicious. I used Emmantal and Gruyere (just because I had those two handy) and I didn't have any cream at home so regular milk was my substitute. I brushed the tops with some melted butter for the gloss on top. I brought them all into the office and they're already gone. Would be great with a bowl of carrot soup and arugula salad for dinner some night.

I've been making these scones for years and love them!! Today seemed a perfect day to make them . We are enjoying, along with our scones and coffee, the serenely beautiful and breath-taking vistas from our home. I feel like I'm in a snow glass ball...and yum, on those scones!!

You just cannot go wrong with this recipe. I have used whole wheat flour or all-purpose, cheddar cheese or parmesan, chopped scallions or chives. buttermilk or half and half or full cream. When I used the buttermilk, I did use only 1 3/4 cups and added a stick of butter which I worked in by hand. I do use extra cheese, and definitely cut down on the salt if the cheese is a good cheddar. Supermarket cheddars will work but then you should probably go with the full 2 tsp salt. I also always put a tablespoon cumin, per someone's excellent suggestion. These are terrific straight out of the oven but they freeze and reheat nicely (a definite must for me, since I am single). I usually bring some of these to a couple of friends when I make them and they just scarf them down as soon as they see them!

Wonderful recipe! We substituted rosemary for the chives, and receive rave reviews at every event we've brought them to. Always a winning scone, and so easy!

This was my first attempt at making scones and they turned out beautifully. Some of the other reviews mentioned they weren't quite flavorful enough so I substituted the half&half for low-fat buttermilk, which added some tang and worked nicely with the cheddar.

These are excellent! I used half the amount of chives because I was nervous that they would be too overpowering, and I think that they turned out great! I'm making a twice-baked potato soup tonight to accompany the scones. Crossing my fingers that this dinner combo will be as delicious as it sounds to me!

These were great--easy to make and came out delicious. Great with scrambled eggs. They don't rise high, but the flavor is great.

I found these to be bland with taste... I'm going to make them again, just with more chives and more salt. I did not have heavy cream so I used a mixture of buttermilk and half and half, which worked out beautifully for the texture. I think I may use this as a base recipe as I try different versions of scones. Texture- fantastic, taste- decent. Add more chives and double the salt!

Rating: 4
These are very, very good. The texture isn't what one might expect from a scone--they are much fluffier, and chewier. All the flavors are right--the onionyness of the chives lends itself to pair well with the tangy, slightly sweet, yet still savory cheddar. They smell incredible baking in the oven. They are best eaten the day made, though I haven't tried freezing them.

these were SO easy and fast to make! eat them right out of the oven for the best texture. i'd add more cheese next time too.

These were delicious! I used a mini-scone pan that makes 16 scones and it worked beautifully. These were easy to make, hard to mess up. I followed recipe exactly but totally forgot about brushing with the additional cream. They didn't miss it at all. I recommend adding these to your arsenal of amazing foods to impress your friends.

These scones are delicious! Exactly what I hoped for, especially since it was my first time making scones from scratch. I found the kneading somewhat unecessary. Considering that my dough was very sticky and it created quite a mess, I might consider skipping this step next time. Still, the end result looked and tasted great, and I agree that using only 1 tsp. of salt is the way to go.

Rating: 4
YUM. These scones are fantastic and so quick/easy to make! I did make a few minor adjustments--I used 1 cup of buttermilk and 1 cup of cream (instead of the 2c of cream called for), plus I added about 1 1/2 tsp. of mustard powder to the dry ingredients and scattered a bit of grated cheese on the top of each scone. I also made the scones a bit smaller since I'm planning to serve them as part of a buffet for St. Patrick's Day (I ended up with 24 mini scones). I would definitely keep the changes I made and make this recipe again!

I LOVED this recipe. I have several scone recipes already and this one's going to be stored forever. The scones rise just so and are so light and fluffy. I usually freeze leftover scones and these reheat wonderfully as well.

This is a definite keeper. Very easy to make and tasty. I added a dollop of sour cream to the batter, and a bit more flour. The dough was pretty sticky, but workable. I also added about 10 more min to the cooking time.

Can't give it forks because didn't make it as is. I doubled the recipe before I checked my fridge - turns out I didn't have the cream, only two cups of half and half, so used two cups of buttermilk with the half and half. So sticky I couldn't knead or cut it, so instead dropped the dough by mounds onto cookie sheets and made into biscuits. Taste great anyway! Next time I'll probably try and make as written, but these turned out good too.

The recipe is wonderful and easy to make. Every time I make it I get asked for the recipe. I just made it with jalapeno and red pepper instead of chives, and it was a hit. I also rolled the dough into 4 balls and then cut into 8's and served as mini scones.

Great recipe! I made 16 mini scones by patting the dough into an 8" square, cutting the square into fourths, and halving each of the smaller squares into two triangles. Williams Sonoma has a great pan for this purpose that lightly browns the scones perfectly.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. I work at a place where I make breads, cookies, etc for the employees as well as customers coming into the showroom. EVERYONE says that these are the best scones they have every had. They ask for me to make them time and time again. I add more cheese, though, to make it about 2 cups. You can never go wrong with a little extra cheese. So very yummy!!!!

I made these scones to compliment our Easter meal, and they turned out incredible! They had a very good consistency and the combination of the chives and cheddar was outstanding! The scones went very well with ham. All of the guests raved about them and there were only a couple left over. I will definitely make these again!

THese smelled wonderfull while they were cooking. I just saw on the recipe that they make 16 scones, I made 8 large ones I guess. I didn't have the cream, so I used 2 cups butter milk and incorporated 2 tbsps of butter into the flour mixture. WONDERFUL. the smell is awesome. defiantely a keeper

Very good scones-definetely agree with other reviewers to watch the salt. One teaspoon was more than enough and I did use very good quality sharp cheddar. Could not find fresh chives so had to use freeze dried but was still good (only used about 4 Tablespoons)

I made these this morning for work, I was surprised at how easy it was. I've never made scones from scratch before so I was a little nervous at how they'd turn out. I could only find Tillamook sharp cheddar so I took everyone's advice and cut the salt in half. It's turned out very delicate and moist in the middle. Very yummy!

It is worth the money to splurge and buy an imported cheddar, or the very sharpest you can find. These are sublime!

Tastes good. Visually appealing triangles with specks of yellow and green. After 20 mins, they were only pale brown, but I took them out (which turned out to be the right thing to do) because inside, they were perfectly moist. Slightly too salty with Kraft cheddar cheese, so reduce or omit the salt.

Rating: 3
One thing that is important is to check the salt content of the cheddar you get; different kinds and brands vary. I would say the higher quality the cheddar, the less extra salt is used, while still maintaining that important sharp, piquant thang. So, as you may have guessed, I was in a rush and used Safeway cheddar, and when I added the two teaspoons of salt and then tasted the dough I was worried: it tasted awful, super salty. But once they were cooked they turned out good, kind of like a big Cheezit. Next time I'll try cutting down on the additional salt.

Ohhhhhhhh...... This was so good. I halved the recipe, but used the full amount of cheese. I baked at 400 for 20 minutes, and they were perfect. They weren't crumbly or dry. I also used a little more than half of the cream, just to make the dough sticky enough. These had the best texture. Like a cross between a heavy pastry and a biscuit.

Made these for Mothers Day brunch. Really great flavor. I think I baked them a bit too long because I was waiting for them to brown up more and they were maybe a little dry. I used a baking stone so they did not brown as fast. Served them with the corn, scallion, potato frittata recipe on this site. Yummy.

Everyone loved these scones, which were served with a homemade veggie soup. My only problem with preparing the scones was that the chives were still slightly damp when I chopped them, which added considerably to the overall cooking time of the scones. The longer cooking time, however, did not affect the flakiness or tastiness of the scones!

Fabulous recipe! I made the scones and served with the prosciutto and honeydew, and also made the Lemon-Raspberry Cornmeal Muffins that appeared with this recipe in a Weekend Brunch menu in the July 2000 issue.

Love these scones! Easy to make, wonderful to eat. You can vary the types of cheese you use. I put a little extra cheese and put in a little less salt... Eat it right out of the oven, or microwave it for about 10 seconds ... either way soooooooo yummy!

Yum! It is absolutely much better served right from the oven. I substituted chives with green onion since chives are a bit to expensive. I used 1/3 c. of chopped green onion, and it gave just the right flavor. Next, I brushed the top with extra cream and sprinkled them with freshly cracked black pepper to add a little zing.

Good, next time I'll make sure I use extra sharp cheddar and add a little more. The cheese impact was a little low. Still can't beat the recipe for RAISIN SCONES. The butter in that recipe makes them flaky rather than crumbly as these are

When I made this from the magazine, I skipped over the line where you add the chives and cheddar, so I actually made two batches, the recipe and a plain version. Both were very good. My family enjoyed the plain ones with jam or honey. They weren't too dry. I might use a little more cheese next time.

Didn't have any chives,so I substituted scallions instead. These scones were very moist and an excellent partner with salad or other vegetables. They took a bit longer than the 20 minutes on the recipe, so make sure that they are browned on top.
