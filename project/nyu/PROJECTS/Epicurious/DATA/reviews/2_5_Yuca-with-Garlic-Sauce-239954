I put Cheyenne pepper instead of black

I think these would be a bit plain if serves with non-spicy food, but I served them with the Chilean Country Ribs (which are spicy) on this site and they went really well with that.

Just made this with fresh Yuca. Fresh just requires a little more work and longer (up to 1 hr.) cooking time, but it tastes great. The sauce is delicious. Pretty much just a variation of the classic "mojo" sauce.

actually, they DO mean frozen! fresh yuca has a very different texture and flavor and does not cook as well. it's also a lot of work to trim yuca. the frozen has the additional benefit of already being trimmed.

I think they meant fresh. Of course it has to be fresh! This simple and affordable side dish is very deliscious. We Dominicans love it with roasted chicken.

if you don't like yuca, you won't like this. but it is a nice balance of flavors. and quick. nothing too special, but quite edible.

Haven't made this recipe but I have a question.... why not use fresh? I am Dominican and we wouldn't DREAM of using frozen yuca!
