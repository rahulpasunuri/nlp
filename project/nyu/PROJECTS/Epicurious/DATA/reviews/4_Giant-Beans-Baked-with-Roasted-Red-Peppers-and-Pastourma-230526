These beans were great! I did the vegetarian option and probably could have used more cumin. I cooked them uncovered since most recipes for this kind of bean dish said to cook them that way. I would do it that way again.

Great recipe!! Have to differ with a previous rater though. I don't know what village her family is from in Greece, but as a native of Greece, I can that Pastourma is now commonly a BEEF product not of pork. In previous generations, when camels were common in Greece in was made from Camel meat, as it still is in much of the middle east today. I am not saying it can't be made from pork, but have never seen pork pastourma in the restaurants of Greece or in commercially made and sold in Greek grocery stores.

Have had this dish many times - different variations both in Greece and at home. Just a note - Ms. Kochilas states that the ''pastourma'' is BEEF - when in fact we know it as a ''PORK'' dish. Different parts of Greece have different methods of cooking, with far different cuisines than other parts of Greece. This is not unusual. I first had pastourma in my father's little village many years ago and could not get enough of it - it was so delicious - home made and fresh pork. Today I am a vegetarian however, just wanted to remark in general and to Ms. Kochilas, as I am sure she already knows, that the pastourma is different in different parts of Greece - we are from southern Greece, the Peloponese, and therefore our cooking is way different than in other areas. Enjoy -

I ran across this recipe while doing a search, and thought I would comment on it. I have the book, which is one of my most-frequently used cookbooks. I made this dish over and over last year, and it's always great, especially in the wintertime. I follow all the directions precisely, but leave out the garlic and the pastourma. Great vegetarian dish, and it's even better the next day!

this was wonderful. I actually used sun dried tomatoes in seasoned oil instead of roasted red peppers because the beans were the main event. I served it with braised lamb shanks with french olives and tomatoes. Very tasty and definitely different. People were interested and pleased!
