We had this for Christams last year and my sister liked it so much she volunteered to bring it for Thanksgiving this year. That tells you something since it is an expensive dish to make. So much healthier than the usual wild rice with sausage side dish that my mother always made.

Very nice. Buffet on New Year's Eve. Everyone loved it. Be sure to taste and add seasoning and / or vinegar and oil to your taste. It's also good with some plumped dried fruit like sundried cherries.

This is a very good recipe (2.5 forks). You can add a many vegetables as desired then just tweak the amount of dressing. I put all the veggies in the oven together and that worked just fine and save time and another step in the process.

I am not rating this as what I made varied greatly! I used totally different veg,carrotts, parsnips, acorn squash and sweet potatoes, and shallots I grilled them instead of roasting them. I added the wild rice and used the vinaigrette.. they were fantastic! This is definately a jumping off point!

Substituted button mushrooms for the crimini (couldn't find fresh ones) with no problems. I roasted all the veggies together on one pan to save with cleanup. Makes alot, so I halved the recipe. The dressing is very nice and mild.

This was good but next time I think I'll add a tablespoon of lemon juice and take the ol up to 3/4 cup. It needed just a little more "kick" and the lemon should brighten it up.

This is an amazing dish. Make a day ahead to rave reviews of guests. A friend brought it for a 'potluck' dinner and I immediately made it the next week for a dinner party and will make again this week for another one. Everyone loved it. To save time, roast all vegetables at the same time with one set on top rack and the other on the bottom..turned out fine. Simple and delicious!

Although the dish was very festive looking it lacked pizazz. Needed kicked up!

I made this as an additional side dish for Thanksgiving for my vegetarian friends. We served 40 people and everyone loved this!! Great color, flavor and texture.

Made this for a Christmas buffet. It was delicious, but the recipe makes more than 20 servings. Lucky us, we are still munching on leftovers.
