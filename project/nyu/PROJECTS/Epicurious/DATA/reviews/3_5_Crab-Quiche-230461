Great recipe - my family loved it! I made a few minor adjustments: Used 4 egg whites, 2 whole eggs w/ yolks, used fat free half-and-half cream, and added 1/2 cup of gruyere. Don't be shy with the chives and seafood seasoning.

I Love this recipe base! I used high quality canned crab (I had 270g instead of 225g- 1/2 lb), minced green onion instead of chives, and one extra yolk. I made a classic "pâte brisée" with 2-1 ration flour-butter and rolled thinly and coated with the extra egg white. DID NOT PRECOOK CRUST. I also added a pinch of dill weed and subbed the 2nd cup of cream with lowfat milk. Put it in the oven at 375° for 20 minutes then lowered to 350 for remaining 30 minutes, covering very loosely with foil at end. My crust was not soggy under the quiche and the sides were crispy. I also added 1tsp Cajun flavoring. THe texture and taste were excellent. I served it with fresh green peas with shallots sauteed in butter and fresh parsley. Preceded by a salad of cherry tomatoes and mache greens. Perfect!

Made this for Easter Brunch. It's as good as the other reviewers have written. Followed the 5 eggs/1-1/2 cup cream recommendation with good results and did not add cilantro. Everyone thought it was a good balance of crab (used Dungeness Lump crab since this is the Pacific Northwest), cream and herbs. Served with a small, mixed green salad w/lemon vinaigrette and crostini. All-in-all, an easy and delicious meal!

I thought this recipe was absolutely delicious! I followed the advice of previous reviewers and used 1 1/2 cups of cream and 5 eggs which made the consistency yummy. I also made the following modifications: used salmon, parsley, thyme, rosemary and creamy swiss since that's what I had on hand. The amalgamation of flavors with the Gruyere was marvelous. The longer it sits, the better it tastes. Do try with a green salad and white wine, you'll love it.

I read most of the reviews before attempting myself. I followed the advice of using one more egg and less cream. I think this made a very nice consistency. I also don't think I used lump crab meat (by accident). We had bought two cans of crab meat, but it definitely wasn't lump! Brought it to a brunch. Everyone loved it! Will make this again.

This recipe gets highest rating from me because it is such a solid starting point for a great dish. I like others here have adjusted to my own tastes, but the combinations of flavors is on point. I mostly adjusted quantities. I used 5 eggs and reduced cream to 1.5 cups. Used Old Bay Seasoning instead of PP's, cut cilantro by half, and added an extra 1/4 cup of Swiss Cheese. Also worked well with Gruyere Cheese instead of Swiss which gave it a more savory tang that I liked. Will be making this many times more. Was a very satisfying meal with green salad and dry white wine.

Good flavor, but I agree with other reviewers that there's not a good cream-to-egg ratio. I'd reduce the amount of cream and add a couple extra eggs. I think this would keep it from being too soft and runny and reduce the calories a little, plus it would make it a more golden yellow color. I also thought that this isn't nearly filling enough for something so fattening.

Rating: 3
Thought this was pretty good. I made my own quiche crust, with 2 teaspoons of mustard in it. Was probably a tad too much. As a tart shell is not as deep, I used the 3 eggs/1.5 cups of cream that another reviewer suggested. Looked gorgeous. Can't argue that it's a very rich quiche. My guests enjoyed it. I thought that the herb mixture needed a bit of work which is why I only gave it three forks.

What a great quiche! Got rave reviews. Leftovers were great for breakfast. I played with the spices because I didn't have seafood seasoning and it turned out great! I even added some cardamom and ginger. Used canned crab from trader joes which worked great. Only thing, make sure to cover the edges of the crust so they dont burn.

Wow, this is good. I've made it twice (once with canned crab, once with fresh Dungeness crab). I've tweaked it a bit. Here's what works for me: Use a Pillsbury refrigerated pie crust and do not prebake it; cut the cream to 1 1/3 cups; increase the chives and parsley to 3 Tbsp. each; omit the cilantro; use 3/4 tsp. Old Bay (not Paul P's); add 1/8 tsp. cayenne, add an extra 1/4 cup cheese. Delicious!

Cut the cream by half. The mixture is much too thin otherwise, and will take forever to set. Other than that--absolutely delicious!

This is the second time I made this - and this time I made revisions based on what I had on hand. I used 1 1/2 cups of canned lobster meat - cut up and used paper towels to remove all the moisture from the meat. I sauteed 1/3 cup of chopped onions in a little butter - until just translucent, then added 1/2 cup sherry and boiled it down to add flavor. I used a frozen pie crust (the rollout kind and did not bake it beforehand) placed the lobster meat and 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese in shell. Mixed the eggs with the light cream -added the boiled down onion mixed - 1 cup shredded Swiss cheese, and some chopped fresh basil - used white pepper and a little salt - poured it over the lobster meat and the parmesan cheese. Baked at 425 for 15 minutes and reduced the heat to 300 and baked for another 45 minutes. It was AWESOME.

I have made this many times with rave reviews. Filling does not fit in my deep dish pan. It will fit, however if you use 3 eggs and 1 1/2 cup cream and keep the other ingredients the same. I use half and half to lighten it up and leave out the cheeses, since I can't tell the difference. It doesn't seem to add to the dish. I also use canned crab and Pillsbury refrigerated pie crust, since I hate picking crab and making pastries. I always end up with flower all over the kitchen. This way, it takes about 15 minutes to get it into the oven and only one dirty bowl.

Tasty filling, used canned crab and skipped the parsley and cilantro. terrible crust recipe. too much fat and flavor wasn't good. Filling does all fit if you use the deep dish pan.would make again with a different crust recipe and might play around with other fresh herbs.

I also made some tweaks to this recipe and it turned out quite good. I used 2 Tenderflake 9" pie shells which I pre-baked according to the package instructions. This definitely would have been better with a homemade pastry but it was a weeknight and I couldn't be bothered. Basically this is what I did: I sauted 1 small onion and 1 clove of chopped garlic in a couple of tablespoons of olive oil, added S+P and about 1.5 tbsp of Italian seasoning. To this I added 1 diced roasted red pepper (Marzetta brand, from a jar), 1 tbsp chopped fresh chives, 2 tbsp chopped fresh Italian parsley and 2 cans of Costco crab, well drained. I divided and spread the crab mixture over the bottom of each pie crust, sprinkled each with about 1/2 cup of grated gruyere cheese and then poured over my custard mixture (2 cups 1/2 & 1/2 + 4 eggs + S&P). It was really fast, easy and flavourful and made an excellent weeknight supper with a spare I could stick in the freezer for later. I baked each quiche for about 50 mins (until knife inserted in centre came out clean) and you can re-heat at 350C for 15 minutes when you want the second one. Yum!

It's almost midnight and all I can think about is the left overs. This quiche made me want to hunt John Travolta down, pull his head back and shove it down his quiche hole. Make it..bake it a wee bit longer than specified, as it was a little smooshy in the middle still after an hour. But, it's delicious, I kid you not.

The filling was very mediocre at best--needs more flavor. Perhaps it will taste better next day. I read all the reviews before making this crab quiche. I noticed in the picture there was something red in the filling, but could not find what it was in the recipe. Followed the recipe but did add diced tomatoes (might be the red part), against my better judgment used store bought piecrust, added fresh spinach, and an additional 1/8 tsp Old Bay spice, and used 12 oz. fresh crab meat. The store bought piecrust was awful. I will make my own next time. Even at 12 oz. of crab, it was too much. I cooked it 50 minutes and it came out with a nice texture and just the right amount of firmness and was great looking. I will mess around with the ingredients next time.

Rating: 4
This was excellent and very easy. I made it as a tart rather than a true quiche; it makes 2- 8" tarts, and served 16 for a shower brunch with 2 other items. Per previous reviews I blew off the pastry and used Pillsbury for the first time ever, and I'm a convert! Do bake ahead--it was a nice and flaky. I used a mild chevre in place of the Swiss as I was using gruyere in another dish. Great crab flavor, so if it's for an 'event' then spring for fresh crab (Dungeness here in Seattle). I also used half-n-half instead of cream, omitted the cilantro, added a 5th egg, and it was great. I'll try this with canned crab and fat free half-n-half again, for a regular dinner item that doesn't break the bank, or the diet!

Rating: 4
This dish was delish! The recipe made enough to fill two 9" deep dish pie crusts. I added some sauteed shallots and some blanched asparagus. I put the crab meat on the bottom of a pre-baked (previously frozen) pie crust, then poured the filling over it. I cut the asparagus into bite sized pieces, and put them on top of the filling. I used one bunch of asparagus, using half of a bunch on each quiche. I served the quiche with a salad for lunch, and got rave reviews!

Rating: 2
Just ok for me. I used a Pillsbury deep dish pie crust and still couldn't fit all the ingredient - poured the rest in a casserole dish and made a crustless quiche. I think you could cut back to 2 or 3 eggs. I used lump meat crab (fresh picked and frozen) and fresh herbs but didn't get the wow factor.

I used the canned crab from Costco and Pillsbury Pie Crusts for this and did not bake ahead. It made two nine inch pies and it was wonderful. My brother had several helpings.

King crab was on sale so I used that, and I think I'll continue to do so. This was the best quiche we've ever had. Like some other cooks, I made a few changes. I used a Pillsbury pie crust and didn't prebake it (I've been making quiche for about 25 years and have never done so before), and it worked perfectly - no sogginess. I used fresh parsley but subbed 2 T of a dried herb blend (Parisiennes Bonnes Herbes) for the chives & cilantro. Other substitutions I made were 1 can evap milk for some of the cream, Old Bay for Prudhomme, and used all Swiss cheese. I also added about a cup of sauteed (w/a little s&p) leeks. As I always do w/quiches, I spread out the fillings on the bottom of the crust then poured in the custard. It baked for about an hour, and I relied on my tried- and-true method of inserting a knife near the center to test for doneness (should come out mostly clean). It was delicious and very pretty, too.

Truly delicious! I made this when my husband unexpectedly brought home some blue crab meat. I made a few alterations, as I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand. I omitted the fresh herbs, as my herb garden is dormant right now. I added sauteed leeks as another reviewer suggested. I substitued havarti for the jack. I used only 1 cup cream and 1/2 cup milk. I made it in a regular quiche pan and had enough left over to fill a small caserole. I didn't have any issues with sogginess as others did.

I made a few alterations, so I don't know what it would have been like "straight". But what I got was wonderful! Alterations: used 5 eggs--I like more custard texture; Used gruyere cheese (a swiss type); used Old Bay seasoning; dry thyme and a pinch of dill; added 2 tsp dijon mustard. Also chopped 2 shallots and a little sweet onion with 6 mushrooms and put it directly on the crust before adding egg/cheese/crab--to avoid discoloring the eggs etc. I baked the crust earlier in the day and mixed the filling and refrigerated it. When it was time to bake, I just poured and put it into the oven. The texture was amazing and the flavor delicate but rich! Yay!

I've made this quiche, and a couple of variations, six or seven times in the last year. The first time I made it as written except omitted the cilantro because we have a family member who is allergic. Yum, but a little runny. The second time we used a Pillsbury crust, prebaked it and then made the filling with only 1.5 cups cream. Yum, but still a little too loose. We've since settled on 1 cup of cream and have varied the filling by adding green onions, sauteed mushrooms with white onions, some precooked and squeezed dry spinach and a variety of cheeses. All delicious! We've also made tart-size quiches - very delightful. The great technique is the prebaking and cooling of the crust - makes it flaky and not at all doughy. Making a crab/Gruyere/green onion/mushroom version for Christmas dinner, served with a citrus and romaine salad. Try it!

Rating: 4
Excellent. Made it as suggested except removed pie shell when it was partially pre-baked and brushed with beaten egg and returned to oven for 5 minutes to help keep crust crisp. Omitted cilantro and sprinkled crab/cheese on bottom of pie plate instead of incorporating into egg mix to ensure even distribution. Used a 10" pie plate instead of 9" which was the perfect size.

This was pretty good. I added some asparagus and 2 more eggs than called for. It was very tasty. I ended up making mini quiches in a mini muffin pan. I had quite a bit of egg mixture leftover so I poured it into a dish and baked it. I think some fresh corn off the cob would make this dish better.

My husband loved this, but I did change it a bit....I followed the cook who used egg beaters and fat free 1/2 & 1/2....because we try to low fat our meals, I eliminated the pie crust and added a topping of phyllo in the last 20 minutes of cooking...it worked out great...in my opinion better than the pie crust....I also agree it would be really good with aspagaras but I did not have any last week....will definitely make this again...

Totally devoured at pot luck brunch for church choir after Sunday services. After hearing that it is John Travolta's favorite, choir gourmands are calling it "Sunday Morning Fever." Many people thanked me for bringing this delicious dish and asked me to make it again. I doubled the filling recipe and baked it crustless in 13" X 9" pyrex dish (sprayed with PAM)---just didn't have time to make the pastry. No one seemed to miss it, but I think it a flaky pastry crust would put this recipe over the top. Did not vary recipe except to omit cilantro; I felt bad about that, but there is always at least one cilantro-hater at any pot luck and I can't risk that kind of rejection. Used the one-pound can of crab that I bought at Costco, being careful to drain the small amount of liquid. I think the filling might benefit from a liberal dose of Tabasco.

I made this quich for a baby shower and everyone loved it. I didn't add as much cheese as the recipe called for and added more veggies. I made the filling the day before, which really helped the flavors to develope. Delicious!

This is truly delicious, even better than I was hoping. As another reviewer noted, it's almost no work at all if you use a pre-made crust, but the results are still great. I used half-n-half in lieu of whipping cream, which worked beautifully and the quiche was still very very rich. It was even better the next day--if crab meat were cheaper, I'd make this all the time.

I made this for a lunch meeting, everyone raved about it. I made it just as stated, except I made the crust and filling the night before, then poured the filling in the crust before baking the next morning. Other raters remarked the filling was runny, I think refrigerating the filling overnight thickened the filling. The crust was flakey and not soggy. This is a definate keeper.

Fantastic. I used a frozen pie crust. For herbs used italian parsley and green onions; used old bay for the seafood seasoning. There was a bit more than would fit in the pie crust, so I quickly buttered a cupcake pan and then had 6 mini-crustless quiches for later in the week. Really really great, and only the chopping of the herbs takes any work. Used gruyere and monterey jack.

delicious and foolproof -- we loved it as written with canned crab and old bay, but have also had great results with spinach or broccoli (and cheddar), or plain (with cheddar/swiss or another cheese blend). if you don't like or can't find old bay, a good mix of cayenne, paprika and nutmeg does very nicely in its place. truly a great place to start if you want a reliably yummy quiche base. **can't speak to the results with half-and-half instead of heavy cream, since if you're eating quiche at all it's probably best not to start calorie counting!

This recipe turned out incredible as others have noted and I wouldn't hesitate to make it again. I live in MD so anything with crab in it is always a good bet. I took the advice of others and used only half & half which seemed to produce just about the perfect consistency IMO. I also was only able to find canned crab, but it's from Phillip's (big seafood name here in the MD area) and it tasted just fine. The crab came in a 1 lb. can so I had enough for 2 quiches and only used half of it in each one. Any more would've been overkill. The first quiche I decided to use herbed goat cheese as I like the flavor and figured the sharpness & creaminess of it might compliment the dish. It worked alright. :) Granted, it's an acquired taste so many might not like it. The 2nd quiche I just used a pre-shredded "Italian blend" and that worked just great too although a bit bland for me. Seasoning wise I used Old Bay as there is NO substitute. :) I also added a bit of onion to both quiches and it really upped the flavor quotient. Overall it's a definite winner.

Rating: 4
This quiche is absolutely amazing. I have to admit I cheated a bit - I used a ready-made pie crust to save some time - but now that I know how good the filling is, I will definitely make the crust from scratch next time. Plus, the filling quantity is quite large so the crust recipe probably takes into account the large nature of this recipe. Also, to cut down on the fat I used 1 C. heavy cream and 1 C. half and half. I think the recipe would be just as good using entirely half and half... Delicious!

Brilliant Recipe!! I used half of a 16oz Costco can, and doubled the amount of cheese - half grated Baby Swiss cheese (milder and nuttier than regular swiss) and half Sargento grated Mexican mix. For the crust, I followed this recipe (check out Alton Brown's preparation method from the Good Eats TV show at foodtv.com - find the "I Pie" episode - it's a great visual aid!!). The quiche's overall balance was perfect, with the crab and cheese complementing each other nicely. A bottle of Australian Chardonnay was a perfect match to this excellent dish.

My family (kids too) loved this. I used the canned crab from Costco (I did NOT use the whole 16 oz can -- I think that would be too much crab) and added cayenne pepper and chopped red onions.

Took advice from another reviewer and used 16 ounces of lump crabmeat,however I would use 10-12 ounces next time. (Was a bit too much crab)I used fresh herbs and wouldn't make it without them. I used fresh grated fontina and romano cheese, it was delicious but not eggy enough for me. I will increase the eggs next time to six and will cut back on the cream. Next time I will try it with 1 cup of heavy cream and 1/2 cup of half-half. The flavor was delicious but it was like eating just crab and heavy cream.

One of the best quiches we ever had. I substituted half-n-half for part of the cream to cut down on some of the fat, and I did not make the crust because we're doing low-carb (this is a fabulous low-carb entree or even appetizer if made in mini muffin cups). I even used canned jumbo lump crab meat instead of fresh and thought it came out great. (Hint--if you use canned, make sure to drain it thoroughly then add the liquid as part of the cream measurement.) Also, I only added parsley instead of the herb mixture, and it was just fine.

The quiche was great and I used canned pasteurized(sp?) crab meat. I can assure you that you get all the flavor of fresh crab meat with less work and less shells.

fabulous recipe. doesn't need all of the herbs. good with but also good without. delish! canned crab doesn't but it at all. try to use fresh is possible, it's worth it.

Fantastic! However, I agree w/Philly chef, make it as a treat. I plan on having this at my post-wedding brunch next month. Although, I'll be using pre-made crusts to save time.

First of all yes, anyone who doesn't like something too "eggy" should steer clear--as should anyone who doesn't like anything too "cheesy". But then, the ingredients should make this obvious. Second, i would remind everyone that we are rating the *recipe*, not its nutritional value. Quiche is not an everyday meal, you won't have a heart attack from an occasional treat. That being said... This is delicious. (assuming you do like eggs & cheese) I used canned lump crabmeat, would probably be even better with fresh.

I usually love quiche-not this one. It had good flavor but the consistency was to eggy for me.
