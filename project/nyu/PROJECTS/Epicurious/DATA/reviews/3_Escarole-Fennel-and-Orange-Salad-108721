I'm surprised that some complained about the amount of work involved in making this salad. It could not have been easier. "Supreming" an orange really isn't that much more work than simply peeling it and if you chop, rather than tear, your escarole, this takes minutes to prepare. I made it mostly as directed, but added some pomegranate seeds to add color. The salt and fennel are very nice; they balance out the bitterness of the escarole. I usually prefer to cook escarole because of its bitterness, but this salad really sold me on the raw stuff. I'm adding this to my recipe box because it's great for winter, when all of the ingredients are available at the market, and for summer, when fennel and escarole show up in my CSA share.

Based on the other reviews, I added a bit more vinegar and substituted walnut oil for half the olive oil. It made a very nice, simple, winter salad.

Okay, so I didn't make it right: Market was out of fennel, so I substituted endive, which also has a mild anise flavor. Even so, this salad was a lot more bland than I thought it would be. Maybe it was mediocre produce; I would try the recipe one more time, as the concept seems good. The amount of dressing was scanty, as other reviewers noted; I would increase proportion of dressing to greens.

As others, I used romaine instead of escarole, and I always use raspberry wine vinegar when white wine vinegar is called for. I like that little touch of extra sweetness and color. I cored and slivered the fennel. Scored the orange after grating enough zest, peeled it, separated into sections and cut each into thirds. I did put a dash of Dijon mustard into the dressing just for a little kick, but it was fast, easy and much better than your average salad.

I used romaine instead of escarole. I didn't segment the oranges instead I peeled them with a knife, sliced and then quartred them - same effect, less work. I also added a bit of lime juice to the dressing - it seemed a bit bland.

I love these reviews because everyone has a slightly different take. I thought this salad was great in part because it was very easy to prepare and yummy too! I removed the outer leaves of escarole and then sliced it in 1 inch pieces and then washed it and dried it in the salad spinner. I used the mandoline to quickly slice the fennel and left the core in so it would stay together. I halved the escarole and fennel but ended up using all of the dressing for 4 servings so for 8 I would double the dressing. In a pinch I would use the orange zest and canned mandarin orange slices, but the orange technique is not bad once you zest the oranges. I just sliced off the bottom and the top and then use a sharp knife to remove the pith in thick slices and then it was easy to remove the orange segments by running the knife along the membranes and wedging the slices out whole - does that make sense? I had an avocado that I sliced and put on the side, it looked nice and tasted great with the fennel and orange.

For me, this salad is too time consuming for the taste. Escarole needs to be washed again and again, and the orange sectioning took a long time. Probably quick work for chefs, but tiresome for the everyday cook. Also, extra virgin olive oil tasted wrong in this dressing and I would probably use grapeseed if I ever did make it again.
