I followed the recipe exactly... and I was disappointed. As another reviewer noted, the cake is more like a sponge, and lacks the tender crumb that I was hoping for. And the frosting was far too tangy and runny. For anyone who wants to make this in the future, I think 1/2 the amount of sour cream would make the frosting more palatable.

This cake was delicious - moist and not too sweet. I also decreased the amount of salt.It was a hit among adults and kids and I plan on making it again for Thanksgiving!

This was delicious. By far the most moist and flavorful cake I have ever made from scratch. We made this for a cake making party with the kids so I had everything measured out beforehand which made it seem less daunting. We ate the cake immediately after frosting which made it more delicious because of the freshness, I believe. I substituted greek yogurt for the sour cream and added the chocolate (melted) to the butter and sugar alternating it with the yogurt and got the same slightly sour taste mentioned by other reviewers with a nice consistency to the frosting.

This cake is excellent. The crumb of the cake is perfect, and the brown sugar and vanilla bean give it a great depth of flavor you can't get in any "boxed" cake. The icing is delicious, just enough tang from the sour cream. It really wowed everyone who had it.

I thought that this was an excellent cake. The cakes were full of holes-- like a sponge. I put the frosting in the fridge for a half an hour and was a bit runny but figured that it had a good consistency to do the layers and fill all the holes. I then put it back in the fridge to thicken it up a bit and iced the outside. I did not find it too salty. I used Kosher salt. I wonder about the others? I think next time I may sneak a layer of jam in one of the layers.

Glad I read the posted review because I decreased the salt in frosting to 1/2 tsp and it was just right. Also baked and froze the cake several days ahead and frosted night before serving. Makes a huge cake and enough for a big crowd. Had a little trouble with the frosting being kind of thin so ended up using the full lb of confectioners sugar. Also used Ghiradelli bittersweet choc chips. Don't know if that makes a difference but will try baking bar choc next time. My cake didn't look perfect but close enough and tasted delicious. Got lots of compliments. Would definitely recommend.

WAY too much salt in the icing!!!!! Otherwise, a decent cake recipe. The cake is very moist and easy to prepare. I used 60% bittersweet chocolate for the icing but would suggest 70% and only 1/2 t salt.
