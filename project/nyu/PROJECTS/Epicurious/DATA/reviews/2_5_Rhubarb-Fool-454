I'm usually not a big fan of rhubarb but I really enjoyed this dessert. I made it for my family and even the kids loved it! I'm also a big fan of mango fools with chocolate anise straws.

The high hopes raised by the previous reviewers were, alas, dashed. It was ok, but only ok; easy, but hardly worth even the minimal effort. Seemed like a waste of good rhubarb (and good Grand Marnier!).

So simple and tasty. I guess the secret is the Grand Marnier. You can make it more than an hour ahead.

I doubled this recipe and served small portions to seven ladies. Seven ladies asked for the recipe! I made this a day ahead of time, and it was just fine.

This was extremely quick and easy to make and surprisingly tasty. I used a nice, creamy low-fat yogurt; avoid those rubbery no-fat varieties.

This was realy delicious. Fast and easy too. I'm sure it would be good with other fruits.
