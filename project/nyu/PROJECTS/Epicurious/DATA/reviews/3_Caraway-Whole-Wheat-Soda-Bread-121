This soda bread was moist and very, very sweet. It was in no way a dinner/lunch bread. In fact, this recipe would be more appropriate if the caraway seeds were omitted and it were instead used as a "shortcake" with cooked peaches, etc. for a healthier dessert. Perhaps that would make it a "four forks" recipe.

Awww, sweetie. You are as good as this loaf! No, better!!!

Easy as pie, even though it's technically "bread". This loaf was a wee bit sweet, but not so sweet as the man I shared it with today :)

Oh dear... got out a second loaf to defrost for later that night.... it didn't make it. The first recipe I've made where I myself, and myself alone, have consumed the entire thing. Absolutely wonderful.

This bread is so delicious that I sat down and ate three fat slices of it as soon as it came out of the oven! I upped the whole wheat flour to 1.5 cups and reduced the white four to half a cup. I also only used 1 tb of oil and substituted apple sauce for the rest. Finally, I added more caraway seeds. It was absolutely heavenly!

I made a subsitute of molasses for the brown sugar, and this recipe came out tasty and light. I might add a few more caraway seeds next time, since I'm a sincere fan, but that's about the only adjustment I'd make. I can see the potential for a different treat than the traditional Irish soda on St. Paddy's Day....
