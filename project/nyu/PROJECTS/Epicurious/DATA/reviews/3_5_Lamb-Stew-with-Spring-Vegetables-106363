If a stew could be classified as refreshing, this would be the one. Full of colour and flavour, it makes for an impressive looking meal thats sure to satisfy

I have used the bouquet garni, buerre manie and veggie cooking parts of this recipe with great success. I usually experiment with the herb, salt and pepper and wine types/quantities. My view is that this is an excellent starting point that can be easily tuned to one's own liking, so I gave it 4 forks. Example: I based last night's lamb stew on this recipe.I had to serve 8 and leave some for leftovers. I used 5 pounds of lamb The veggies cooked separately thing really works! Process changes... Cubed the lamb, tossed in flour, browned each side (I think this is the Maillard reaction..) De-glazed the pans with 2 cups of Merlot Used veggie stock. Switched up some veggies. The beurre manié as a thickener is really cool. Ingredients changes: 9 fresh parsley sprigs 3 fresh thyme sprigs 3 fresh rosemary sprigs 3 Turkish bay leaves 12 whole black peppercorns 5 lb boneless lamb 2 large onions, finely chopped 6 garlic cloves, finely chopped, (4 were monsters - but still it was not over garlic'd) 2 cups of Merlot 900 ml tetra box of veggie broth Salt and Pepper to taste 3 parsnips 6 carrots 1.5 pound bag of mini potatoes, halved 1 almost grocery bag sized bunch of sweet peas in the pod (shucked them myself) Buerre Manie - I used 2 tbspns of flour and 2 tbspns of butter, and there was almost half left over.

This dish is completely lacking in depth and complexity. Something hugely fundamental is missing here. I strongly suspect it's the absence of a long-simmered and reduced stock of roasted bones and root vegetables, among other things. Also, white wine just doesn't have what it takes to marry and unite these ingredients. Not the proper medium. The makings appear to be here for a great dish, but it just doesn't cut it. I used every trick in my quite substantial culinary arsenal, but still couldn't lift this out of the bland and mediocre category.

This recipe could use a good jolt of something to make it a little tastier. Ingredients are great; method of cooking is great; but man this is screaming out for something more on the spice front.

I made this into more of a winter stew, using string beans and substituting a can of tomato sauce. I probably added some more spice-red pepper, chili powder, maybe some worcestshire sauce. This is a good basic recipe to start with.

I am tempted to award 4 stars after incorporating flavor enhancing changes; 1 tbsp of high quality Balsamica 1 tbsp Worcester sauce 3 tbsps golden miso 2 ribs celery 1 largish potato reduced the braising temerature to 300F. substituted red wine (Shiraz)for the white.

I have to admit that I changed this recipe a little, using pieces of lamb rather than the meat it called for, but this recipe was incredibly good, a keeper!

This was good - doing the vegetables separately, particularly the snap peas, makes for a very crisp stew - much better than the soggy mess you normally get with most stews. That said, I found the sauce to be a little bland - even with the bundle of herbs - and I would advise experimenting with your favourite stew spices to give it a little more zest. PS: 3 lbs of lamb is A LOT! But worth putting it all in.

If you follow the cooking instructions, cooking each veg separately and until just tender, you are really in for a treat with this one. I have made it twice, once the usual-all-in-the-pot-at-the-same-time way and while it is still good, it is much better with the veggies crunchy and individually cooked. Both times I braised the meat on the stovetop and needed more stock because it reduced too much. Beautiful colors, very tasty, kind of labor-intensive, but worth doing.

This is a winner! The only thing I did differently was omit the wine (none on hand)and add a few spoonfuls of roasted veggie puree (leftover from another meal). Some fresh crusty bread and my family was raving! It takes a wee bit longer than 2 hours but it was fun and definitely worth it.

I've made this twice, and both times it was gone almost before it was done. Delicious! Both times I used my own blend of veggies rather than hunt down what the recipe called for, and I've done a few other small twists and turns, but it is a tasty and easy base recipe. Great for a cold night.

A lovely and satisfying dish. Served it to guests with an Irish pub salad and hearty bread. They were delighted. It's a bit more time-consuming and costly (with the lamb and baby vegetables), so, in a pinch, I might substitute coarsely chopped veggies for the baby ones and the pearl onions. Still worth adding to my repertoire, even if only for for special occasions.

My mother-in-law was very impressed with this dish when I served it to her. I think I've made better. I did like the combination of veggies and their crispness. The gravy could have used a little more depth of flavor.

This is delicious and pretty easy to make. It is perfect to make in the morning, then re-heat later. Pre-blanching the vegetables is worth the extra step. Use the best quality lamb shoulder you can find. Don't forget to remove the bouquet garni and de-fat the broth before you finish the dish ( the recipe neglects to tell you this). My family loved this dish. I would serve it with wide noodles or potatoes next time. The broth is so good you want something to soak it all up with!

Made this for St. Patty's Day dinner. I had to subsitute some cubed veggies for a couple of the baby veggies indicated, but the stew was still awe-inspiring. It was simply perfect.

Normally, I take a recipe and make my own additions or deletions to it. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. This time, on a whim, I decided to follow the recipe as written. Boy am I glad that I did! This dish made me pat myself on the back and call all of my friends to tell them what a great meal I had made. This one will go perminently in my recipe box to be used time and time again.

OK. So let's put this in perspective. I live in eastern Canada and last night we had 43 centimetres of snow and 120 km winds. That's 15 inches and 75 mph winds for those of you who are metrically challenged. My wife is away for three weeks in Bangkok visiting our son and his wife and I don't leave for three more weeks. THIS IS COMFORT FOOD. Fortunately, I made the whole recipe so there is lots left over. A baguette and a heavy Cab. The only thing missing is you know who!!

Doubled recipe and served to 8 people in our wine group. Drank with old California Pinot Noir. Excellent dish. Praised for the cleaness of flavors, probably attributable to lean shoulder chops and some skimming of extra fat. Used peas and green beans to replace zuchinni and pea pods. Technique of cooking vegetables separately makes this stew quite different from traditional preparations. Yes!

Fabulous! All my guests raved!

This is a great lamb stew although a bit time consuming to make. If time is an issue for you, I would suggest breaking up the preparation as suggested in the recipe. The lamb shoulder was tender and delicious.

A very good dish for entertaining as it can be prepared in advance. Fresh herbs are a must but if baby vegetables are not available simply cut mature ones into bite-size pieces and be sure to cook until tender before adding to the stew. This needs some good crusty bread or a side of roasted new potatoes for soaking up the delicious sauce.
