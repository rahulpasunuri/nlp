This recipe is poorly written, but after some experimenting I learned a few things to help avoid crumbling. (1) Flatten out dough, don't roll into a "log". (2) Score the dough to make it easier to slice after baking. (3) Slice as soon as cool enough to handle after baking. Do not wait an hour. Also, chopping the cherries into smaller pieces can be helpful.

I hadn't noticed this was marked "healthy" before making it, otherwise I might have thought twice. I found the dough fine to work with, but the finished product wasn't great. Was kind of soft but dry, not the way biscotti should usually be (hard and dry but delicious). I dipped it in melted chocolate to improve the outcome, but still wouldn't make it again.

The dough was very dry, had to add water to make it malleable, and overall the finished product was lackluster

The dough was a bit too dry, so I had to add some water, and it crumbled somewhat when I sliced the cooled biscotti. However, they were very tasty, with a good chocolate flavor and nice chewy cherries.
