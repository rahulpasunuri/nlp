Made mostly as written and loved it. Great way to use up languishing vegetables and stale bread. Served with a poached egg on top of each bowl, which was a wonderful addition and made it into a rich and hearty meal. Subbing dried herbs for fresh was no problem. Don't skip high quality smoked paprika.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing. I found the smoked paprika which I do think was important, it had a very characteristic flavor but wasn't overpowering. This was the best use of cabbage I've found, the cabbage blended together well with the cauliflower and the other veggies. I used an unsliced loaf of Balthazer Mulitigrain pan loaf which I sliced thicker than store-bought. I'd definitely recommend a hearty dense bread, and this one also had miscellaneous seeds in it which only added to the texture. Great recipe.

I had my doubts, but this turned out to be a very nice, subtle dish. I think the secret is in the quality of the ingredients (as always!). I had to substitute some things (Hungarian sweet paprika; no oil-cured olives; Trader Joe's whole wheat sourdough...), but still was a very satisfying meal. Trying to freeze the remainder--we'll see how that goes.

I keep looking at the recipe to see if I did something wrong. We just did not enjoy this at all.

I thought this was an absolutely delicious melange of veggies and spices. I used more cauliflower and less cabbage, red pepper as opposed to green, a very large Vidalia onion. Be sure to use the fresh herbs, as stated, and smoked Spanish paprika will make all the difference. Really dense bread is also key. I used a little less broth to make it less liquidy. My husband, a confirmed carnivore, also enjoyed this immensely.

Admitedly, I didn't have all the veg required so I subed. I didn't like the result.The broth was nice with the bread but the veg went for composting.

This was so surprisingly fantastic that it is now a staple in our house. It was soulsatisfying; I admit I was a little skeptical of cabbage and cauliflower being so rich but it was - in a luxurious way. I am also a habitual substituter (based on what i have) but this was perfect the way it is.

This dish was amazing. I was skeptical despite the good reviews but I was overwhelmed by yumminess. My top bread only partially submerged but that seems to be the treat - having the contrast of a bit of crunch with the rest of the smooth stew. And vegan, too!! (if using veggie broth)! This will be a staple now.

It would have been a really good soup if it weren't for the cabbage :-) I substituted potatoes for the cauliflower. The soup really had too much cabbage, but it did have a good flavor to it. I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor that the spices gave the soup. I suppose if I must use cabbage (someone gave us half a head and I didn't want to waste it) that this is as good of a recipe as I will find.

This is a wonderful treat and well worth the hour and a half to prepare the ingredients. Only substitution I had to make was Muir Glen Fire-Roasted Tomatoes in place of fresh (It is winter afterall.).

Substituted endive, red pepper, and yellow onion but the stew turned out wonderfully. Smells and tastes great!

I loved this recipe. I was low on ingredients so I had to use dried herbs instead of fresh but it still turned out great. I also threw in some carrots, and substituted a red onion. I will definitely make this again!

Very good - I skipped the part where you put the bread in and just dipped some thick rich bread in the soup. This was so good I ate it every day for 4 dinners with different main dishes. Use lots of fresh herbs - that's the kicker!

I can't believe no one has reviewed this before me!! I was in Mallorca last summer and am wild for this soup (even though it is not really a summer dish). Try to use a dense wheat bread, not a fluffy one, thinly sliced. Herbs can be varied. Like all vegetable soups, don't be afraid to omit or add one or two vegetables. This soup varies a lot on the island. For speed, just put bread on the bottom of bowl, dish in the soup and slurp away. This is a great stuff.

i think it means, put the first 4 pieces in the broth in a single layer, they should be completely covered with broth. put the next 4 on top of the others, they won't be completely covered so you push down on them to squash the bread and submerge. does that help at all?

I don't understand these phrases: "Immerse 4 bread slices in broth in pot. Place remaining 4 bread slices atop broth; press to submerge."
