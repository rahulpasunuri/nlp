Must make with the cabbage. Both are excellent.

Hard to mess up braised pork shoulder. Just making it plain with salt and water will yield great results. That said, this was just ok. Not really Hawaiian tasting. Vaguely Asian flavor. Will try for the banana leaf wrapped recipe on this site next time.

We have used this recipe over the past 7 years or so - we always come back to look it up online - my husband and kids love it!

This was very easy to make & very flavorful. It smelled absolutely amazing while it cooked- that Chinese five spice is like magic fairy dust. But I did think it was quite oily between all the oil in the cabbage accompaniment & the oil & fat in the pork recipe.

It's been a while since I've made this but it's a keeper. We call it by a different name... Pork-caine... cuz it's soooo addictive and as soon as you take one bite, you _need_ another one. Before you know it, it's all gone and you desparately need more.

We made this for the first time tonight. We followed the recipe exactly except with lean pork and it came out overly salty. Although the pork did come out tender, the flavor was missing something. May try the suggestions for reducing the saltiness and adding dark rum/more sugur or maybe even pineapple next time.

I found a hunk of pork butt in my freezer and tried this good dish. No cabbage, but served it over quinoa, Very tender and tasty!! Judy

Love this. I suggest buying the leaner Pork Loin country ribs. The cheaper country style ribs are too fatty, and ruin the beautiful sauce.

This was really good. I made it a day ahead, then reheated it and added chopped cilantro and 2T red wine vinegar before serving. I bought 5 lbs of pork, and trimmed so much fat off I ended up with about 6 servings, so I recommend buying more pork than the recipe calls for. No leftovers, everyone had seconds!

Have made this "as is" several times with great success. For a different twist: Use a Boston butt or picnic shoulder roast and same preparation. Cook until fork tender and shred the meat in the sauce. Serve on lightly toasted King's Hawaiian rolls. Makes a great cocktail party appetizer.

Excellent and easy! Made twice for large groups, each time received rave reviews from everybody. This recipe is a keeper.

great recipe - the meat was SO tender, and it made a very flavorful broth as well. i didn't salt the pork, and i used low-sodium soy sauce, and i had no problems with saltiness. i used purple cabbage for the cabbage recipe, and i thought it was very good too, although not as flavorful as the pork. serving this over rice helped stretch the meal (leftovers!!) and it absorbed all the delicious juice from the pork. if you can wait an hour for it to braise, this meal isn't hard or time consuming preparation-wise - i will definitely make this again!

I made this along with the fried cabbage for friends and we couldn't stop raving about it. She has asked for the recipe and we will both make it again.

Outstanding. Great depth of flavor and pretty darned easy to pull together. I've always considered this cut of pork to be malleable yet not overly flavorful. This definitely bucks the trend. Great flavor and the group I cooked it for ate every last bite. Served with rice and that was it. Again, outstanding. Certainly going to make it again... and again... and... you get the idea.

Easy, delicious, feeds a crowd, can be made a day in advance... definite winner. Even picky eaters ate it and liked it! Had to tell the visiting kids that it was simply "steak" to get them to try a bite, but they were hooked as soon as they did and had seconds. Will remember this one.

Doubled this recipe for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I hadn't made it in awhile and definately won't wait so long to make it again. It's easy and is a crowd pleaser.

Rating: 3
Really tender and delicious. I made this twice now. 2nd time reduced the amount of soy sauce and did not add salt, otherwise a little too salty. A must to make the cabbage to balance the saltiness of pork.

I made this last night and it is delicious!I served the pork and cabbage over brown rice. I halved the recipe and it turned out great. The only problem is that I should have made the whole recipe because now I'm bummed we don't have leftovers!!!

Rating: 3
Really good; my husband loves it. I followed all the low-salt techniques --low sodium soy sauce, low sodium broth, not salting meat at all and putting a peeled potato into the pork mixture as it cooked -- and the saltiness level was fine.

I opened the fridge last night to find thick pork chops and cabbage that required cooking (or chucking out). This was where my search took me. I forgot to add salt to the pork at the beginning, but fortunately, it didn't need it. I did add a bit of Accent to tenderize (since I used cubed, thick loin chops and I didn't want the meat to dry out) and the meat was super tender. I loved the sauce and the meat, but not the cabbage (used purple instead of green--it was all I had). I usually like cabbage, but didn't care for this preparation. However, my husband loved the whole thing and shook his head vigorously when I asked him if I should make it again or not. Resounding "YES!"

I have been making this recipe since it first appeared in Bon Appetit, but am just getting around to rating it. I love this recipe for its ease of prep and the layers of flavor. I do serve it over rice to soak up the fabulous sauce with cabbage (I grate carrots into the cabbage, as well) on the side. Terrific.

I have made this recipe at least a half dozen times since having for lunch at a friends house. AND at least 3 other ladies at the lunch have made if for their familes at least twice.

Fabulous recipe (especially the cabbage, which has become a standard side dish in our home). I've made this several times with a couple of modifications. Altho I'm usually a "salt first, ask questions later" kinda gal, the recipe came out way too salty the first time. Now, I omit the soy sauce altogether and just add soy sauce at the end of cooking to taste. Also, I trim most of the fat from the pork to reduce the grease quotient. Very low carb (if that's your thing) - tho I usually serve half white rice/half cabbage recipe in the bottom of a shallow dish with pork ladled on the rice side. Nice finish: grilled fresh slice of pineapple with a scoop of mango sorbet!

This was excellent. I made the stir fried cabbage, too, and the combination was perfect. My husband had seconds, and he usually doesn't care for cabbage.

Delicious! The pork came out fork tender and received rave reviews!

The pork was indeed tender and tasty. The recipe just didn't do much for me - it felt like you were just eating big chunks of meat...it needed some chunks of veggies or something. I thought the cabbage was the best part of the dish!

Delicious, and the meat was soooo tender! Definitely use low sodium soy sauce AND low-sodium chicken broth.

Rating: 2
So many great reviews? Like many reviewers, I found this recipe to be VERY salty. I used low sodium soy sauce and can't figure out what causes the saltiness. The meat was very tender but the flavor was definitely off. I won't be making this again. I can't say much for the Stir-Fried Cabbage either.

This dish was both easy and delicious. The flavors were different enough to be non-traditional, but not so much that you could not serve it to the non-adventureous eater.

This was fabulous! I've made it twice in two weeks, both times for guests. It was a hit each time.

I used a much leaner cut of meat when making this dish and still it was very tasty. The cabbage made a nice bed for the dish alongside white asian-style rice. Will definitely make it again.

Try this recipe! I had a surprise luau for my husband's birthday. The meal was a huge hit. The aroma was fantastic and we were very glad to have leftovers (great sandwiches). The cabbage was the perfect accompaniment, and I make that as a quick snack with noodles or rice.

What a great party dish! I too followed the suggestions on cutting sodium and adding a bit more brown sugar. But since I enjoy a "saucier" dish, I added a little teriyaki with the first batch of broth, and a healthy pour of dark rum with the remaining batch; both seemed to enrich and deepen the flavors. A little espresso or coffee instead of the rum might do the same. Sesame seeds on top and chopped pineapple alongside. Yum!

This was great! I substituted a homegrown Thai hot pepper for the red pepper flakes, otherwise followed the recipe and served it over Jasmine rice. An hour after dinner, the smell in the house is still tantalizing. This is a keeper.

I made this a couple of weeks ago for a Hawaiian themed potluck at my work and everyone loved it and requested the recipe! One of my co-workers,who also runs a small catering business, said she has now made this several times as it is her family's new favorite recipe! I did use reduced sodium soy sauce and only very lightly salted the pork before browning and thought it turned out perfectly.

Terry T: What started as a few couples turned into a neighborhood luau at my house. (I guess a small luau would defeat the purpose!)I needed a recipe that I could make the day before and was certainly lucky to have found this one! From start to finish and then into gallon baggies to store overnight, it was a breeze to prepare and even better the next day. The only hard part was forcing my family to wait until the next day to eat it. I followed several reader advice points as far as salt & sweet and the neighbors think I'm a genius! I even had time to Limbo (no photos available!)

Very good & very easy. Next time I'll cut down on the salt and/or soy sauce & add a bit more brown sugar. For the cabbage, I used a bag of shredded cole slaw mix instead of just plain cabbage. My husband said this recipe is a definite keeper.

This dish was a hit when I made it for a progressive dinner party with a Hawaiian theme. I took the advice from the recipe raters about the saltiness and compensated with a little more brown sugar and potato. The saltiness did indeed dissapated in the leftovers and I will definite make it again!

I made this for my dad's birthday dinner and it was a hit. Everyone loved the cabbage and the delicious flavor of the ribs. I didn't make rice; I cut up some mango for the side. Wonderful dish!

I am a vegetarian who made this for a party and therefore must confess that I did not taste it for myself. However, everyone else RAVED about it. The fact that the recipe could be made by an "uninterested" cook and be the hit of a party speaks for itself!!

I had a salty result as well, despite not salting the meat and using low-sodium soy sauce and broth and reducing the soy sauce to 1/4 cup. I added some extra brown sugar at the end which helped and the dish was delicious -- even my salt-phobic fiance loved it. Also, the saltiness diminishes after it sits for a couple of days. Had leftovers last night over baked sweet potatoes which was an AWESOME combination and much healthier than white rice.

Rating: 3
True it was a little too salty, but an extra tblsp. of brown sugar and a potato boiled in the mix took care of that. The meat was extrodinarily tender and flavorful. I bumped up the amount of ginger and garlic in the sauce and added chopped red bell pepper to the cabbage for color. I served trhis at a dinner party and every plate was cleaned.

Great dish. My domestic partner is chef and has helped me adapt it a bit. We use fresh chicken broth with no salt, cut soy sauce to 1/4 cup or less of low sodium, and added another tablespoon of brown sugar, more scallions and garlic. The cabbage is wonderful and we've added a boiled potato, which tastes great with the sauce.

Rating: 4
Fantastic! I couldn't find my jar of five- spice so, like another cook, added all equivalent spices except star anise. The cabbage itself is so good I've taken it to a vegetarian pot-luck and served it with plain, oven roasted chicken breasts (less time -consuming).

This was great. I didn't think it was too salty, but I didn't salt the pork before I browned it. I don't like the star anise in five-spice powder, so I used some cinnamon, cloves and pepper in its place. Worked great. I also added about 3/4 teaspoon liquid smoke. It didn't taste completely smokey, but it added a delicious barbecue taste. I also added some chopped red pepper for color. Great dish! Everyone loved it (even picky children)!

Delicious flavors and easy! I did find it a bit too salty. Next time I might skip salting the pork when browning it or the reduced sodium soy sounds good. Cabbage & rice nice & complimented dish!

Rating: 3
The first time I made this recipe it ROCKED! I made it exactly according to the directions except that I happened to have had reduced sodium soy sauce on hand, and it was perfect. Everyone loved it. The second time I made it I used regular soy sauce and it was WAY saltier, but still good. I used nice, fatty country-style spare ribs so it got very glazey and succulent. Don't try to use lean pork for this, it will be dry and gross! The cabbage is wonderful, I make this all the time just to eat alone, but add more ginger and red pepper flakes.

Rating: 2
This is very good, but I think it needs a little something more. Next time I'll add 2 T mirin and 1 T rice vinegar to the sauce, and use a sprinkle of chopped cilantro as garnish. Also - this works perfectly in the pressure cooker. Just brown meat in cooker, follow all the directions in the recipe up to the simmer, then cook for 15 minutes at high pressure. After releasing, thicken with cornstarch.

This dish was incredible! I loved how the sauce was not sweet, as I had worried that it might be (I've never used 5 spice before, silly me). The meat was so juicy, oh yummy, there was not a bite left. The flavor of the sesame oil with the cabbage was such a perfect complement to the meal! I normally don't even eat cabbage, but I had a ton of this stuff! I could go on and on, but I'll spare ya, and just add that this dish is a winner!!

I have made this twice. The first time I used pork chops because I had them on hand. The meat was too dry. Second time I used the country pork ribs and it was perfect! Everyone loved it..I had to double the cabbage the next time because it was a favorite. Don't change anything on this recipe..its perfect!

This was very easy to make and very delicious. The pork was so tender, it just fell apart when you cut it. The stir-fried cabbage was very good and added a refreshing taste to the dish. Given it got rave reviews from my family, I will definitely make this again and even consider it a dinner when entertaining.

A hearty and flavorful meal with minimal preparation! I was unable to find a boneless country-style sparerib. It turns out the servings with the bone were even juicier and tastier! I also added a tablespoon of dry sherry when adding the soy sauce. :-)

This was a great recipe! The pork was very tender and the sauce had a great flavor. I didn't have 5-spice powder and forged ahead without it - it was still delicious. I used napa cabbage instead and stir-fried for just a minute or two until wilted. Will definitely make again.
