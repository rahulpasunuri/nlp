Four forks not because it's the best soup I've ever made but because it's super delicious for the simple ingredients and small amount of time it requires. I made as written except using andouille sausauge, which ended up to be fabulous.

Boring. Not much flavor even after adding extra tomato paste and a chopped clove of garlic. A waste of expensive chicken sausage.

Rating: 3
I made this exactly as directed but perhaps went a little generous on the tomato paste based on other reviews. It was very tasty and incredibly easy. Had it with a lot of toasted buttered sourdough for a complete meal. Get a good quality chicken apple sausage--ours lent its slightly sweet flavor to the soup, which kept it from being bland. But it was not too sweet. I think andouille, as many other reviewers used, wouldn't taste great with the other flavors in this soup.

Made this pretty much as written, though slightly less broth (7 cups instead of 8, which was perfect). Tasty and flavorful--a good New Year's dish.

quick, easy and delicious...made a batch on Sunday night for lunches all week. I also used 6 cups of broth instead of 8 for a heartier soup. it is a healthy and filling lunch.

I've made this twice now and it is a favorite. The only change I've made is 6 cups broth instead of 8, mainly because 8 won't fit in my biggest pot. I've made with fresh rosemary and with dried with equally delicious results. Delicious, inexpensive, healthy, and filling.

Terrific soup. I made it here in Moscow where apple sausages are not available - at least not in the two or three markets I tried. So, thinking that ham and cabbage go well together, I sliced some prosciutto and added it to the soup. I used dried rosemary and tomato sauce since I could not find tomato paste. The soup is absolutely delicious.

I am going to try this soup tonight. I however agree with one of the reviewers. If you make something from this site and you only add 4 out of 8 ingredients or you change the type of ingredients drastically, don't say that it was a terrible recipe. You didn't follow it therefore you cannot review the actual recipe. Andouille Sausage is a very different type of sausage than Chicken/apple. One is sweet and one is spicy/smokey. They are not interchangable. Andouille does not seem to pair with rosemary very well so don't be surprised if it doesn't taste like what you expected.

i made this yesterday. i think it's suppsed to serve 6-8 but 2 of us managed to kill it & i'm making another batch today. it does need tweeking. i used half head of red cabbage from the farmers market, red carrots, cioppini onions, a few bulbs of garlic, 3 times the amount of tomato paste, no rosemary, and home made vegetable stock. also chicken andoullie sausages. plenty of salt & pepper, fresh parsley, lemon bitters & some vinegar. you have to reduce it in order to thicken it & allow the flavors to infuse. really amazing soup. i'm going to add italian kale & in-house made sausages today.

In all fairness I did change this recipe quite a bit to fit what we had in the pantry: andouille chicken sausage instead of chicken apple and kidney beans instead of cannellinis...so it tasted a lot like Portuguese bean soup (which we love btw). My only issue with the recipe is the rosemary. In my opinion the flavor was way way way overpowering. We were picking it out as we ate and after dinner I went through and picked out as much as I could. Next time, I'll leave it out.

It is so irritating to read a review from someone who says "I didn't like this recipe." Then, as you read the review, you see that he or she didn't use the parsley, skipped the rosemary, or substituted a different sausage. Hello! You didn't make the recipe! Try following it once or twice before you review it. Along those lines, now that I have made this three times, I can't believe anyone could find it bland. Stick to the recipe -- it's fine. The only thing I changed was 6 cups chicken broth and 2 cups beef broth. Added a little depth. Otherwise, go with the recommendations and increase the tomato paste. You'll be happy. Teenagers and grownups all like it. 3++

This was really good with chopped apple and a hotter sausage!

This is the worst recipe I have ever made from epicurious.com and I'm still scratching my head over how it has 3 1/2 forks. It tastes both bland and horrible all at once. I spent an hour making it, then had to scrap it and offer leftovers instead. I have never rated a recipe on this site as less than 2 1/2 forks. This one gets ZERO. Make it again? HELL, NO!

I was surprised at how tasty this actually was. My husband was, too. He expected the chicken-apple sausage to fall short of the usual pork sausage in terms of flavor. My 23 year old and his friend enjoyed it. My picky 17-yr-old son even enjoyed it. They said it was a keeper. I've been trying to cook both low-fat and diabetic without sacrificing flavor and was pleased that this worked. I used homemade stock and added fresh thyme sprigs. I tripled all but the cabbage and beans which I doubled. I infused the olive oil with garlic cloves and used sweet onions instead of leeks.

I dodged the blah's by subsituting Sun-Ripened Tomato Chicken Sausages, using only one cup of carrots and using shallots with the sausage and cabbage, as well as throwing two into the liquid to simmer. Result EXCELLENCE

Since I couldn't find chicken/apple sausage, I used a Philly style onion/pepper sausage. Which definitely took care of the blandness that some have mentioned. Only other change to the recipe was adding a shallot and about 1/4 of an onion (gotta clean out those leftovers in the fridge) to the leek mixture. Didn't even need salt/pepper, although my wife added some. This is a keeper for us.

I have to agree with those who wrote that this was bland and uninspired. With all of the wonderful ingredients it should have tasted better. The overall result was something that might be served in a commercial cafeteria.

This is one of my favorite recipes! This time around I added some ceyenne pepper and salt with the carrots, onions and tomato paste (which I doubled). I omitted the parsley, and floated fresh rosemary sprigs after adding the broth so I could remove them before serving (I don't like the texture in soup). I also doubled the beans. This is fantastic with fresh rustic bread.

America's Test Kitchen/Cooks Illustrated have a Hearty Tuscan Bean Soup with Cabbage and Sausage along with a couple other versions in their free section that is quite similar to this... Watching the show in which it was introduced, they said one of the keys to doing this right is to keep the soup at a constant temperature and advised cooking the soup in the oven. I invite people to look at theirs but must admit I cannot compare the two directly.

This soup was really very good, especially on the second night. I followed the advice of others and increased the tomato paste. Next time I'll cut the cabbage smaller - it was a little tricky to eat. My husband loved this soup and we'll definitely make it again.

I found this soup to be extremely bland. I wouldn't make it again.

I just made this soup and it is great! I did what other reviewers said and increased the tomato paste (1 small can), I used leeks, and I omitted the rosemary - I don't like it. I wasn't so sure after I had it all assembled in the pot, but now that it has cooked for an hour I give it four forks.

A tasty soup, but the rosemary was way too overpowering. I used dried rosemary and would skip it altogether next time. Would also follow previous reviewers advice and increase tomato paste to 4T (or more!) - I used about 3T. I love the combination of the sweet sausage and cabbage. In fact, it's inspired me to make a simple sausage and cabbage stir fry sometime and skip the soup altogether - just a great combination of flavors and textures.

Very tasty. Left out the parsley, added some cayenne for spice and doubled the beans. Filling, inexpensive meal that is easy and quick to prepare. Will definitely make again.

I used sweet sausage instead of Apple Sausage and it was really good. I also used onions instead of leeks and I used no carrots. It turned out really well and was good as a fall meal. Very hearty!

Great hearty soup for a weeknight. Used mild Italian sausage instead of chicken apple with very nice results.

I really love this dish. I have made it now at least 5 times. It is simple and delicious. Made a few variations each time, more tomato paste, more rosemary, added some cayenne. Everytime it was outstanding. One of my favorite "comfort foods". (And my boyfriends too) I also like to serve it with a few croutons on top.

Here's how we made it: -4 links andouille sausage, quartered lengthwise and sliced into chunks -1 medium head of savoy cabbage, shredded -sub 1/2 white onion for leeks -cut carrots into fine dice -6oz. tomato paste (prefer Hunts or homemade) -add 1 bay leaf -add 2 cloves garlic after 40min simmer, salted and peppered to taste This came out very, very good. The only thing that kept it from being exceptional was the andouille lended a bit too much spiciness to the dish--next week I'll sub chorizo for half the andouille. I also used dried small white beans instead of canned cannellini. Instead of soaking them overnight, we boiled for a few minutes, let them sit while we prepped and cooked everything else (about 1/2 hour), then added them to the pot with the cabbage and sausage as per original recipe.

Great recipe! I read the title and thought "cabbage and beans? perfect for my grad student lifestyle (and graduate student stipend)." I divided the recipe in half but made many of the changes listed by users -- in the end, I approximated most of the dish.

Had a lot of cabbage and carrots from my CSA share this week so found and made this recipe. I wanted more of a stew than a soup and thought it'd be great to throw in the freezer for winter. That said, I made the following changes: 6 C cabbage, 1 lage onion instead of leeks, 4 TBLS tomato paste (as recommended by others), 6 C. broth instead of 8, 4C white beans (cooked in crock pot) and a sprig of fresh thme for good measure. Family and neighbors ate it all up so I had to make a second batch for the freezer!

this was disappointing...I am not sure why..I love all of the ingredients...will try again today after letting it sit in fridge overnight...maybe more tomato paste...

I made this exactly as described except with twice as many beans, and using regular carrots instead of baby ones. I used homemade chicken broth, so that probably helped, but I found it amazing for some reason. It was just very comforting, tasty, and satisfying, especially for something so healthy.

This was fabulous. I added 1 clove of garlic for the heck of it, 1/8 tsp red pepper flakes for zip and 2 tbsp orzo for body. It was delicious, filling, and so healthy.

I thought this recipe was fantastic as is! The flavors were wonderful, and my less-than- enthusiastic husband even loved it! (He's not always happy with my "healthy" meal options.) I wouldn't change a thing, and will make it often.

We really liked this soup, it's fast, easy and delicious. I used 4+ T. canned tomato paste, 1 T. minced garlic, and a few dashes of cayenne pepper, so it was not bland at all. Also added an onion with the leeks. Sausages were chicken garlic/basil. Next time I might double the beans because we like them. It was light and wonderful.

I thought this was excellent on a cold night and relatively quick to make. I used regular italian pork sausage and it was fabulous. It is almost more like a stew than a soup. Great with crusty bread.

I loved this soup. Added the extra tomato paste and used dried beans cooked separately for a delicious, healthy spring entree. If you want to add more cabbage to diet try the Chicken Fajitas with crunchy lime cabbage.

Made it as directed and it was bland and uninspired. I had to doctor it up to make it worth eating. Cooks suggesting extra paste are right. So was the Texan who said it reminded her of the cabbage soup diet.

We really loved this soup. I didn't have enough chicken stock on hand, so I used a combination of chicken and beef. And we used a brand of chicken apple sausage made with maple syrup that added some complexity. A nice balance of sweet and savory ingredients.

Rating: 3
Very good, but not outstanding. Followed the recipe exactly, with no doctoring this time. The sausage gave it a surprising sweet taste, and the rosemary was very distinct. Very filling and healthy. I would make this again, and I think that other types of chicken sausage (such as Italian) would also be good.

We just made this soup tonight, and loved it enough to write this review. We thought it was incredibly easy to make. The only adjustments made to the recipe were adding another tablespoon or so of the tomatoe paste, and we used (emeril's all natural) chicken broth instead of low salt broth. The chicken and apple sausage gave the soup a lot of flavor. I was thankful I didn't use chorizio, I think it would have changed the essence of this recipe. For someone just starting a diet, I found it filling and satisfying.

We loved this recipe! The only 'doctoring' I did was to add a bit more tomato paste concentrate and since I didn't have fresh rosemary I used a teaspoon of dried and then added a 1/2 teaspoon of dried tarragon.

This is an outstanding soup. I followed the recipe with the exception of the sausage - I used Italian style turkey sausage. It's absolutely delicious and I will definitely make it again.

I thought this was just okay. I used andouille sausage in mine. I puree'd the leftovers and thought it improved it some.

Quite good! I used deer meat sausage instead, so probably got a little different taste than the chicken sausage would. I just have to be in the mood for cabbage before I'll make it again, which only happens once in a while. But when I am, this will definitely be a nice warm winter day soup!
