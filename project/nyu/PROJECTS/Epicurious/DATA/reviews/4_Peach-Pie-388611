The pie tasted ok but it was swimming in liquid. It might as well be peach soup. I even added an extra tbsp of flour because the fruit was juicy to eat off hand. I baked for almost an hour but the fruit never bubbled and it's still a bit crispy. Perhaps next time, I will roast the fruit first before I put it in the crust.

I typically do not like peach pies, as the fruit tends to lose its texture and tartness the longer it is baked. This pie, likely due to the shorter baking time retained the fresh peach flavor. While this one was baked for my neighbor, I will make it for my own family after tasting it.

I made this pie the other day. It was fantastic. The pie crust was phenomenal! I did not have enough peaches so I also added apple and used cinnamon and ginger as the spices. The pie required a longer cooking time than the recipe calls for--about 50-55 minutes.

I baked this pie yesterday for family and friends and got rave reviews. Used eight medium-small ripe peaches, had no problems peeling them without blanching first. Cut sugars by about 1/4, and used cardamon as suggested. I did have to bake it longer to brown and bubble - closer to 55 minutes total.
