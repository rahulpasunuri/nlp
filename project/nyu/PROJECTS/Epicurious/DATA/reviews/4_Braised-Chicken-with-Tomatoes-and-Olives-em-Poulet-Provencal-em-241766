What a wonderful surprise! Going by the previous reviews I was thinking it must be good but I must say I had my doubts.How can something this simple to prepare taste so good? I can honestly say I will add this to my regular rotation of dinners.

This is amazing!!!! Everyone loves it from kids to grown ups and it is SO SO easy. Sometimes I double the tomatos and onions because I want more veggies.

This was good and easy to make. Convection is the way to go as it browns everything nice and even. I used a whole chicken cut up each you can buy already packaged at the store. It's much easier for serving.

I didn't see how this would be remarkable but it's absolutely delicious. Doubled the vegetables and added about 1/2 c. white wine to them before putting in the oven. DIdn't have herbs de provence so used poultry seasoning along with savory and the fennel seeds. Somehow the sauce is greater than the sum of its parts- we'll be making this often!

This recipe worked out very well. The local grocer did not have a whole chicken so I bought a split chicken (approx 4 lbs) and the recipe worked out fantastic! I am not a black olives fan but in this recipe with the chicken, spices, onion , tomato flavors the olives worked wonderfully. I highly recommend that you serve this with the crusty bread (with lots of butter ) as suggested and a nice white wine! This was a great dinner!

It's so good. I made it for a very picky French friend and he just raved and raved and didn't stop. I made it exactly according to the recipe. The tomatoes were super fresh. I would add more tomatoes next time. Like other reviewers, we ate way more bread than we should have sopping up the juices. It looks beautiful, too. The best comfort food I can think of. A lovely and easy dish.

I make this with 8-10 bone-in chicken thighs and it's absolutely delicious! I double the veggies, as we love roasted vegetables, and the whole family practically licks the roasting pan. One of my favorite recipes... easy, and especially awesome with fresh tomatoes from the garden. Highly recommended!

It was Ok for me but it is a quick and easy so I will probably make it again. I think the meat should be marinated overnight.

I made this with chicken leg quarters....very tasty and an easy weeknight dinner. We're fond of dark meat chicken (and it's inexpensive), so will continue to use that instead of a whole chicken. Not a huge fan of herbs de provence and I usually have fresh thyme, so I'll probably make it with the thyme only in the future. I think I just didn't like the pronounced lavender in the blend I bought...but hey, you have to try, right? If you don't have fresh tomatoes on hand, I would think canned tomatoes (diced or whole & drained) would also work well. I used Kalamata olives since I had those.

Rating: 4
I made this with two cut up chickens. I roasted the vegetables for 20 minutes, then nestled the chicken pieces in the veg, and rubbed each chicken piece with the olive oil mixture. I further baked it for 40 minutes and it turned out very well. Nice crispy skin and the sauce was delicious.

I made this tonight. Having made it a couple of years ago, I forgot how good it was. I did roast it breast side down and it was very juicy. The whole family loved it. I added extra olives and onions but next time will add more veggies since they did not go far enough.

I had to get Herbes de Provence to make this supreme dish, so glad to have it in my cupboard again. The aroma, flavor and texture brought me back to France. It was so good I've made it twice in one week. The second time I added more tomatoes and olives. Yummmm.

Listened to many of the changes mentioned in previous reviews: upped the veggies, garlic, herbs and salt. Added 1 cp wine. Didn't use fennel seeds. Whole can of pitted green olives with lil' bit of juice. Added fennel bulb and about 4-5 small red potatoes. I used a bell & evans chicken, stuck pieces of lemon and onion in cavity. Stuck the seasoning under the skin and in cavity. People, I am not a roast chicken girl. I love this chicken. Maybe next time I would cook the birdie breast side down. Everything was cooked in my conventional oven at 425 degrees, 1 hr 20mins. It can probably come out after one hour.

I joined epicurious just so I could add my review to this terrific recipe! It's not just delicious but so easy to prepare and surprisingly elegant. As per other suggestions here, I used chicken pieces and just laid them right on top of the vegetables. I also tossed in unpeeled garlic cloves so there was roasted garlic to squeeze out as well (served with grilled baguette). Fantastic!

Rating: 4
Amazing chicken dish. I made it this time with pieces of chicken, I threw some potatoes in and just used thyme rather than herbs de provence. As other reviewers suggested I cooked the veggies for about 20 minutes and then added the chicken and cooked for another 40 or so. The chicken came out moist and flavorful. So easy, healthy and delicious.

Rating: 4
I really loved this dish -- one great thing is that, it being August, I was able to use gorgeous tomatoes right out of my garden. Then I didn't have any Herbes de Provence on-hand, so I made up a batch using lavender, thyme and rosemary I had in my garden, too. One thing -- I tried using chicken breast but next time I'll use whole chicken as directed.

Amazing flavor! I made this with split chicken breast but otherwise exactly as instructed. My 11 year old told me to post the recipe on Facebook. Now you KNOW that means she liked it! ;)

I made this dish for my family they all LOVED it!! I followed the recipe pretty much as is,adding an additional onion, and small new potatoes. The potatoes were an excellent addition as they soaked up some of the juices. The leftovers were even better heated up the next day. Great flavor. I will be making this many times in the future! So So GOOD!!!

I normally would never write a review where I deviated from the recipe but this turned out really well so I thought I'd inlcude... I used boneless/skinless chicken thighs and breasts and sliced the breasts into thirds. I also added fresh fennel to roast along w/ the tomatoes/onion and omitted the fennel seeds. I used some of the olive brine juice to the pan with the vegetables. Roasted them for 1/2 hour then added/nestled the chicken into the veggies and cooked for another 1/2 hour. Came out really delicious! I will try making the recipe as stated with the whole chicken next time b/c I'm sure it will be super delicious as well. I just needed a quicker weeknight meal this time.

This is an outstanding dish, delicious, easy, gorgeous...A+ winner, really, really, really good. My husband makes this for me, he carves the chicken into pieces before cooking and it comes out great. We also omit the fennel seeds as I am not a fan, but I'm sure it adds great flavor for those who like it. This is one we will make again and again.

Rating: 4
Holy smokes. Equal parts easy, delicious, beautiful, and cheap. So deliciously fragrant and juicy. I used boneless skinless chicken breast as that's what we had, upped the garlic and the olives, and baked the veggies for 30 minutes before adding the chicken breasts (since they wouldn't take as long to cook). Everyone went back for seconds and the three of us ate an entire baguette sopping up the juices. I'd even make the veggies with a little chicken stock and eat it as a tapenade. Delish!!

This was amazing! Big hit with the family. Definitely a keeper but next time will put green/black olives not the brine olives. What tremendous flavors in this chicken dish!

Liked the rub for the bird a lot, and like others I went with an assortment of bone-in chicken breasts and boneless thighs. Result was good, although the big marks go to the chicken with less on the vegetables. Why on the vegetables? Because they are largely a droopy mess. I threw in some pariesenned potatoes, to keep with the theme, and they were pretty much the only saving grace on the vegetable front.

Rating: 3
Really liked this. Made just for my husband and me,with 4 bone- in thighs and added sliced fennel to the same amount of other vegetables. I used the veggies as a bed for the chicken and baked at 400 for 40 minutes. Sprinkled pan with a few tablespoons white wine after 20 minutes. Vegetables were roasted, but moist from chicken juices and wine.

My wife loved it. Kept saying that it was the best checken EVER! I loved it because it was pretty easy. We both loved the flaor. Will make it again this week. I'll probably increase the tomaoes and the onion. Might try adding some potatoes to roast along with the rest.

I made this for a dinner party. I took the suggestion of other reviewers and used thinly sliced fresh fennel, black and green olives, and bone-in chicken breasts. It was very, very simple, took very little prep, and was beautiful and delicious. Everyone's plates were picked completely clean. Served it with a salad and a nice crusty bread to mop up juices. Perfect. I will definitely make this dish again.

This was so good. Used some thighs and breasts, the thighs were tender and moist and the breast meat was a bit dry. Served with spaghetti.

Just awesome! I got the exact quantities of fennel seeds and herbes de Provence from the bulk foods aisle at Whole Foods, and supplemented the 4 medium tomatoes with half a can of no salt diced tomatoes to increase the juices. Since it was a romantic dinner for just the two of us, I used bone in chicken breasts, instead of a whole chicken, (pan fried then first). I served it with orzo pasta. Absolutely delish. My boyfriend was really impressed and ate every bit :-)

We loved this recipe! I have many baked chicken recipes but this is at the top of my list now. I did not have a whole chicken so I used pieces. The combination of the spices with the vegetables and olives was just wonderful.

Really enjoyed this recipe. Fairly easy. We don't like olives so I didn't add them and meant to add capers instead but forgot to. From there though I doubled the garlic and add a quartered lemon in the chicken. Then found I needed double the rub but followed the rest of the recipe. We really enjoyed it (especially with our french bread with homemade garlic butter to make garlic bread for dipping in sauce.) Didn't taste the fennel that much the first night, more the next day. Next time would like to try fresh fennel.

This is one of my favorite recipes. It's so easy and the result and flavors are very impressive. I follow it to the tee with the exception that sometimes I use just bone-in breast or just boneless breasts. The result is slightly less greasy and therefore a little healthier. Great flavors!

This was yummy the first day, but even better the next. I made with chicken pieces. I browned the chicken first and used a can of tomatoes, leaving in the juice, then put it in the oven in the braising pan with the lid on. So instead of ending up with carmelized veggies and roasted bird, this resulted in more of a stew. Still delicious and super easy! I plan to try it again following the recipe exactly to see the difference.

Pretty tasteless and nothing like true chicken provencal. Needs some bell peppers and more herbs des provence

Yummy, heart healthy and quick to prepare. I did improvise a bit. I love fennel so I used more,I was a little short of olives so I added about a tablespoon of capers. I use two huge heirloom tomatoes, one red, one yellow and the rest of the ripened tomatoes I had rescued from my garden before the snow. I used a cast iron chicken fryer and the 1 hour in my convection oven was just right!

It's so rare to see a dish with 130+ reviews and be a full 4 forks I had to try and was not disappointed! Modifications I made were substituted 1 can of fire roasted diced tomatoes, and added a can of cannelini beans. Also for the olives, I just used a scoop of the mixed olives from the olive bar at the grocery store. Delicious!!!

Simple and tasty. The sauce and vegetables were so good spread on the crusty bread that I should have made more!

This was very good. However, I didn't take off enough skin/fat. Next time I think I will try it with skinless pieces on the bone. I used a 5 1/5 lb chicken, and doubled up on the veggies. I made my own Provencal spice mixture with what I had on hand. (no fennel, so I used anise seeds).

Rating: 4
Four stars because this is almost no work and returns are huge. Roasted two chickens and doubled everything, adding extra garlic and herbs de provence to the proportions. Also used fresh fennel which contributed to the wonderful substance of the veggies and sauce. This recipe is perfect for leftovers. I put the second chicken into a dutch oven with its share of veggies and have another dinner for during the week. I agree with other reviewers that this recipe tastes like it required lots more effort than it does!

Rating: 4
Agree with all the rave reviews. The only thing I would add: if you make it with cut up chicken like I did, give the onions/tomato mixture about 15 minutes in the oven before adding the chicken, otherwise the shorter cooking time for the chicken pieces will not be sufficient to get the vegetables to carmelize. Also: if you have chicken breasts, halve them lengthwise with a cleaver so they will be closer in size to the dark meat chicken pieces.

This chicken was absolutely delicious. I made it pretty much exactly as the recipe called for (except stuffed the bird with some garlic cloves and lemon slices) and was not disappointed. Lovely!

I tried the recipe as everyone on his raved about it. WE loved it. The only question I have is the juices? or lots of liquid. The picture makes it seem that it was browned and more thicker. Did I do something wrong?

This is simply one of the best chicken recipes I've made in a long time. Everyone, kids included, loved it. Simple and fresh with a lovely sauce. The tomatoes came out sweet and slightly carmelized (I think from the sugar in the onions) and the salt in the olives gave it a kick. So good mopped up with bread. Didn't have Herbs de Provence so threw together some thyme, parsley, oregano and fresh basil and it worked well. The fennel really adds some depth so don't skip that.

Rating: 4
This is so excellent. I was rushing when I threw it all together and braced for disaster but it turned out PERFECTLY and saved me from embarrassment. Used fresh thyme + dried basil and some garlic powder in the seasoning, and rubbed the chicken with butter. Also stuffed some orange wedges and onions into the cavity. During cooking I was worried about the amount of liquid that was in the pan - but had set the chicken on top of some thick onion slices which I think kept it from sitting in it and it turned out fine. Also used kalmata olives. "you are required to make this every night this week" was overheard at the dinner table.

I used a combo of 4 thighs and 4 breast pieces with skin attached, rather than a whole chicken, because the skin gets crispy and flavorful during cooking. I cut the a large chicken breast into fourths, so they were roughly the same size as the thighs. Recommended option: Chop some fennel and mix it in with the rest of the veggies rather than using dried fennel. It's good with the dry fennel but great with the fresh. Without a convection oven, dish was done when cooked at 425 degrees for 1 hour. Family and friends love this dish and it's easy!

I must have a word with whoever taught me that simple dishes can't blow your mind (and tastebuds)! This recipe seemed *awfully* simple but the reviews convinced me to try it. It was in the oven with only 10 minutes of prep and just a short while later, the house was filled with an intoxicating aroma. And the taste matched. I would never in my wildest dreams use as much seasoning as this recipe calls for but it works. The flavour is harmonious, a joy to the palate - an absolute winner!

This was really delicious and easy. I used a chicken cut into 8 pieces for quicker cooking, and deglazed the pan with vermouth. I also added a small amount of dried hot red pepper flakes for a kick. Major yum! This will go into my regular rotation.

I liked this recipe and followed it very closely, with the singular exception of adding in Italian mixed herbs in place of Herbs de Provence. I rubbed the herb/oil mixture under the skin of the chicken, as I do with all chickens that I roast. One thing to note: 400 degrees is quite high for roasting onions for more than an hour, so watch yours carefully. The tips of mine burned. In the future, I would add the onion a bit later in the cooking process. The fennel really lends a nice flavor. Also this seemed like a lot of oil, especially when you consider how much fat the chicken releases during cooking, so my vegetables were very drenched. I tossed the vegetables with some whole wheat pasta as a side dish and added some lemon to add in an acid note to brighten up the flavor, and then served this with a simple green salad. In the future, I'd up the amount of herbs, add the onions after 20 minutes of cooking, cut back a small amount in terms of the oil in the pan and add some garlic to the chicken cavity and squeeze some lemon over the finished chicken.

This is the best chicken I have EVER made. It was so easy, too. I even goofed by asking the butcher to trim the skin of the chicken for me- -he skinned the entire chicken! I almost made soup out of the chicken instead, but decided to go ahead and make this recipe because I had purchased all the other ingredients. I prepared the chicken as stated, but didn't have twine to tie the legs together. When I roasted it, I covered the whole thing rather snugly with parchment paper so that it wouldn't dry out without the skin. I turned over the chicken halfway through roasting. It came out DELICIOUS. I was really shocked that a skinned, roasted chicken could taste this good. I will use parchment paper instead of skin in the future to cut down on fat. My guests raved, and my 3 picky kids loved it, too.

Rating: 4
This was delicious and I would say, the most succulent chicken I've made. The subtle flavour of the fennel (which I was a bit worried about) was beautiful. Everything worked perfectly. I added some new potatoes to the veg and I also put three lemon wedges into the cavity of the chicken. It was a one pot dish that I will be making often.

i got so excited when i saw this recipe! I couldn't wait to try it! I used bone-in chicken thighs and omitted the olives b/c i hate olives. I didn't expect this dish to generate SO MUCH JUICE! OMG!! Next time I make this (I can't wait to make this again) i'm throwing in a bunch more veggies (zucchini). I don't normally eat that many onions and i thought i was just going to have alot of leftover onions. Nope. I ate all of it and all the tomatoes! The smell while this was roasting was AMAZING! I got so excited while waiting for it to cook! i can't wait to eat tomorrow's leftovers. :) I can't wait to make this for the boyfriend!

Pretty great recipe, thanks! My husband is not crazy about chicken and he said "pretty good for chicken." I used plum tomatoes, oil cured olives I had had in the fridge forever and added a handful of baby potatoes I had leftover. The veggies make the chicken so succulent it is almost not like a roasted chicken. The only thing missing was a green salad to offset the oil a little. Next time!

My first roast chicken and it was fabulous! Made for a dinner party, used a 5 pound chicken and roasted about 1.5 hours. Perfect! I used cipollini onions, a mixture of green and black olives and grape tomatoes. I accidently added a whole teaspoon of salt to the tomatoes, so I added one potato, sliced to the mix. Basted a few times with white wine. So yummy! The veggies were carmelized and amazing. Chicken was moist.

I made this for the holidays, with in-laws visiting. It was my first attempt, and first time cooking something as complex (my previous specialty was hot dogs).

This is the first recipe in my new recipe box.

Our family really enjoyed this recipe. I used chicken breasts and I added other vegetables (in addition to the ones in the recipe) in a roaster... zucchini, mushrooms, red peppers, small potatoes & lots more garlic! I didn't have black olives so I used greek olives. I served it with steamed carrots and asparagus and made a white roux sauce for the chicken out of the dippings! Fantastic!!!

oh wow, this was my first whole chicken! i was totally intimidated, this recipe is great. my fiance - who doesn't really eat tomatoes (and doesn't love olives) - told me its the best meal i've ever made and thought the tomatoes were the best part. i actually used a slightly larger roasting pan (its what we had) and approximately doubled the vegetables so i'd have enough juices (and more veges!). i used four tomatoes and one can of diced tomatoes to add juice. if you have access to decent tomatoes, i may just use eight tomatoes (or four, if you aren't doubling) and skip the crushed tomatoes; they take a tiny bit away from the appearance of the dish. i basted the chicken once with white wine. easy, cheap, delicious.

So easy, so delicious. My husband loves my regular roast chicken (lemons, oranges, whatever herbs are available.) Tried this looking for a change of pace, and he thinks it's just as good. I'm even making it on weeknights now. The herbes de provence really make the dish - unusual, but subtle flavor. And the house smells fantastic while it's cooking. Just as good the next day.

Easy recipe! I wanted to make it in a crockpot so I actually used chicken breasts (a little over a pound), 2 cans of diced tomatoes (you'll want extra sauce to sop up with bread), 1 fennel bulb in addition to the fennel seads, 5 cloves of garlic that I fresh minced (instead of 4 large cloves and 1 tsp minced - I prefer not to pick out the cloves) and the same amounts of the other ingredients. My chicken was actually frozen so I cooked that first while I went grocery shopping for rest (and used the broth to make an israeli cous cous side dish) and then put all the ingredients (except the cooked chicken) in the crock pot for 2 hours. then an hour before my guests arrived, I added the cooked breasts. I just halved the breasts so they were not chunks. I garnished with parsley as the recipe said. Easy and delicious!

I've made this recipe at least 30 times and it still a favorite at our house. I've served it to family and friends and we've never been disappointed with the results. I've tried various options; just chicken breasts (bone in with skin), boneless pieces, but I keep coming back to the whole chicken. What works best for us - only a drizzle of oil on the vegetables and just enough in the spices to make them sort of sticky. Ground fennel rather than the fennel seeds and not that much. However, you can go overboard with the garlic and herbes de provence. LOVELY!! And soooo quick & easy to make.

This dish is fantastic. Probably the best chicken recipe I have made. I treated it like a one dish meal and added some red potatoes. I also used canned fire roasted diced tomatoes because I wanted plenty of liquid for the bread. I also used pieces of chicken with their skin on rather than a whole chicken. Like a few other reviewers I added a bit of white wine on top of the chicken 1/2 way through. The skin came out perfectly and probably played a role in how juicy the chicken was. Definitely buy a loaf of french bread for sopping. You are going to want it. All in all the prep time was probably less than 20 minutes. I will be making this dish a lot.

I have made this dish often with mixed results. Recently I made it with ingredients bought from a farmer's market. It was awesome. I double the amount of tomatoes and add new potatoes.

I was eager to try this recipe for my boyfriend, who finds even the most flavorful chicken recipes lacking. I prepared exactly as advised, using a whole chicken that had been quartered, as the friend who recommended it told me she often used only thighs with great results. I seasoned both sides of the sections very liberally and cooked until 165 degrees. Found the chicken to be moist, but the sauce to be bland. It was all eaten, but not as eagerly as usual.

Rating: 4
This might be the tastiest roasted chicken I've ever made. The pan sauce that is created by the combination of the chicken, vegetables and olive oil is incredible. I make one change to this recipe and one only. Instead of rubbing the seasoning mixture inside the bird, I rub some on the outside and then gently pull up the skin and rub the majority between the meat and the skin. I find this makes the flavors pop even more. Yum!

Rating: 4
wonderful! this recipe has become a new standard of mine. currently i'm into no-chop cooking (i just can't be bothered), so i use a pint of grape tomatoes and simply smash the garlic. i have used black and green olives (sometimes both), and found this equally excellent with chicken legs.

This was a wonderful recipe - so easy and simple, I was a bit skeptical as it almost cooked itself...had some guests over and they raved. I did add a bit of white wine to the pan, also didn't use any lavender flowers as I don't care for them in my herb blends.

Very easy to prepare and cook. No muss, no fuzz recipe and it's super good! I love to experiment when it comes to cooking, and when I read about the reviews on this one, I thought it will be a great dish for the whole family, and I'm just so glad that I picked this. Everybody enjoyed every bit of it. I tried to follow some of the advice given, but I found out that using sun dried tomatoes is not a good idea as it got very charred. i used canned peeled whole tomatoes with the sun dried and the rest turned out okay. Nevertheless, it was really perfect! The chicken was indeed tender and juicy. This is going to be one of my specialty dish.

As written I give this 3 forks - it's a good start. But some tweaking can make it better. Am puzzled as to why this is referred to as Braised chicken when it's clearly roasted. Nonetheless, I added halved red-skin potatoes and drizzled the chicken twice during roasting with a dry white wine, about 3/4 cup total. Used an 8-ounce package of baby Roma tomatoes, halved. Husband and I both loved it as a change of pace from our other roast chicken recipes.

Excellent every time... first time we made this exactly as described and it was delightful... reminiscent of simple Tuscan cooking... today we made it and added sundried tomatoes and used the olive oil the sundried tomatoes were packed in for the 3 Tbs oil called for and it was sublime... I highly recommend!

Delicious! Only change I made was the addition of a fennel bulb. Besides tasting so good, this dish LOOKS beautiful, well, at least when you use a nice Whole Foods chicken.

Great. Great great great great great. This recipe hits the superfecta: it's so easy a child could make it, it's cheap to produce, it basically cooks itself and it tastes FANCY. If you're a beginning cook searching for a date-night dish, look no further; this is the one. I made it as directed except used a cut-up chicken. Cooking time was exactly an hour. Next time I might sub leeks for the onions, and also might try that fennel thing -- oh yes, there will be a next time.

Our new favorite chicken recipe. Used canned tomatoes instead of fresh because it's Boston in March and "fresh" tomatoes taste like cardboard. Used chicken pieces instead of whole chicken. Cooked it for about 1 1/2 hr. Delicious!!

There aren't many recipes where you get such intense, delicious flavor with so little work (and relatively little fat). I browned pieces of chicken breast, deglazed with some red wine, used 2 cans of tomatoes and 1 1/2 large onions. Great with Kalamata olives and a couple of chopped up sun-dried tomatoes.

Rating: 4
Excellent! I used whole chicken and added more than the recommended amounts of spices. Also added capers, a fennel bulb, an extra onion, a turnip, and some white kidney beans to the veggies. The fennel really takes it to another level. Don't skip the crusty bread either - soaking up the juices was almost the best part.

I made this twice - once with skinless & boneless chicken, and another time with a whole chicken, cut up. It was MUCH BETTER with the skin and bones.

Rating: 4
The chicken was very tastey and juicey, even though I left it in the oven for a few minutes longer than the recipe stated. The accompanying veggies, however, were so charred thatt they were inedible . .. No matter because I had plenty of sides to serve with it- the veggies weren't even missed.

Rating: 4
Wow. A fantastic dish that can be prepped in advance, is easy, and unbelievably good. Thanks to cooks here for excellent suggestions--I doubled all the veggies and their herbs and spices, added fennel wedges and capers, and used canned whole Italian tomatoes cut into thirds. I served with the greens (broccoli raab) , cannellini beans and garlic someone here suggested, saffron jasmine rice, and homemade rosemary focaccia. The combination was beautiful on the plate and incredibly flavorful.

Rating: 4
Exceptional. Took others advise and added fennel wedges and increased amount of onion, garlic, and herbs - spectacular and soooooo easy. Don't think I would use anything but a whole chicken as it needs the time to roast and carmelize the vegetables properly. Crusty bread is a must. Will make again and again.

Rating: 4
Great recipe. Have made it 3 times now. I prefer using pieces of chicken to a whole chicken. Always have more veggies than room in the pan, but when I have tried a larger pan, the juices all evaporated, so the smaller pan is a necessity. Added fennel wedges as well, which were delicious. It will be a staple for me.

This was fantastic and exactly what I wanted it to be. Made a few changes, mostly due to necessity to avoid a shopping trip. Used a can of drained diced tomatoes, chicken thighs (bone-in with skin), and crushed the fennel seeds a bit with some peppercorns in a coffee grinder. This recipe was so good, so easy, and my wife especially liked that only one pot was dirtied in the process.

Made this dish last night for hubby and myself and we agree with other reviewers - it's a great simple dish! Convect roasted veggies tossed w/oil & herbs for 20 minutes, then topped with seasoned skinless, boneless thighs. Result was excellent. May add 1/2C wht wine at mid-stage next time.

I made this tonight as a easy sunday dinner. I braised it a bit differently- cut up pieces of half a chicken, browned with a bit of oil and deglazed with a cup of wine then onions, 2 canned tomatoes, olives and herbs de provence- all in the crockpot (scary.. i know). nonetheless, it is just what i've been waiting for- using up leftover party olives and it is very cozy to have. We had it with some couscous to soak up the juices. next time, i'm adding some fennel as well. this is actually a very easy dish for different seasons, ie. sister gives me this big bag of tomato season. =)

Not only is this the best chicken dish, but the aroma while it is roasting is fabulous!

This dish has wonderful flavors! I made a very easy variation using six boneless chicken breasts and a large can of diced tomatoes, with liquid. I also added artichoke hearts and used a handful of whole garlic cloves. Combined all ingredients in a 9x13 casserole and baked at 425, stirring occastionally, until chicken breasts were just done, about an hour. Served with Trader Joe's Brown Rice Medley. It would also be delicious with a pasta side dish.

I didn't use olives, but mashed the garlic and butter into a cream and glazed the chicken prior to the oven, instead of fennel seeds I chopped up fennel. It was wonderful, I'll do this again- so easy! thanks

Great simple recipe! I've made this will all kinds of veggies, including squash cubes, eggplant, peppers, zucchini, carrots, etc. It is always a winner!

This recipe lives up to the glowing reviews. The only change I made to the recipe was to add a large fennel bulb sliced into wedges; I recommend this addition. Some reviewers placed the rub under the skin of the chicken, but I don't think that would be necessary. There is so much flavour in the sauce and veggies that I don't think you'd likely notice the difference.

The Best Chicken Recipe Ever!!! This is my 4th time making it this year. Everyone kept raving about it. Doubling the veggies is a MUST! I also added 1 tbsp of capers. I am planning to make it again for upcoming Roshashanna Dinner using Kosher Chicken. Delicioso!!!

I forgot to mention that I also made my own herbes de provence out of dried thyme, marjoram, bay leaves, basil, and rosemary and lavender from my garden. Was fantastic!!!

YUM! This is a really good meal! I used cherry and yellow pear tomatoes instead (that's what was in the fridge), black olives (what I had), and boneless skinless chicken breasts and it turned out wonderfully! Next time I think I will add some chicken broth and maybe rice, or white wine- wasn't overly heavy on the liquid.Super good!

I forgot to add in my review that I roasted half the vegetables in another baking dish (9 x 13 pyrex) so that they would be spread out enough to roast, instead of steaming. Mixing all the roasted vegetables together at the end spreads out the chicken flavor. Worked great.

This was absolutely delicious. I took other reviewers suggestions and doubled the vegetables. I also doubled the seasoning for both the vegetables and chicken. In other words I doubled everything but the chicken. It was just right.

Just had to throw in my four forks. Excellent! I use my own mix of herbes de provence. Here it is for anyone who might like to try it: 1 tablespoon (each) dried thyme, dried sweet marjoram, dried summer or winter savory, dried rosemary; 2 bay leaves, crushed; 1 teaspoon (each) dried lavender buds, fennel seeds; 2 teaspoons grated and dried orange zest. Makes 1/3 cup. I still used the amount of fennel seeds called for in the recipe even though my herbes de Provence contained some. Enjoy!

yum yum YUM! since i modified this recipe i'm not going to rate it, but i'd give my variation a 3.5. i used legs and thighs instead of a whole chicken, and 2 lbs. rather than 3. i also added capers, and my olive oil was from a jar of sun- dried tomatoes. everything else, i used as directed. i ended up having to take the chicken out early (45 min.) since chicken parts cook more quickly. at that point the veggies were still stewlike, so i added in a can of cannellini beans, and since i couldn't resist, some white wine and chicken broth paste. i cooked it all together until the liquid mostly evaporated. and, well, oh my GOD! it is delicious! so good in fact that i'm making another batch of the veggies and beans tonight, to have more to eat with the chicken. yum.... the herbes de provence, esp. the lavender, gives it its distinctive flavor. i found it a bit strange at first, but it's lovely and unusual - along with the olives (i used kalamatas), it's a definite update on the standard onion/garlic/tomato- meat/starch one-pot- meal motif.

Absolutely delicious. Perfect balance of flavours. The second time I made it I added more onion and carrots. Delicious the next day too.

(Comments are for double the serving) This was a hit at dinner tonite! To make my Friday night dinner for 7pm for 8 people manageable, I chopped up all the veggies the night before, seasoned them & then put them in ziploc baggies. Per the reviews I added much more veggies (10 tomatoes,baby red potatoes, 3 large yellow onions, 2 1/4 olives & a handful of skinny, baby carrots) & was generous with the olive oil. The scent of the veggies by themselves as I was mixing them in the bowl was simply divine! I couldn't wait to cook it today. I also did the same thing with the chicken (seasoned & put in a bag with a half a lemon inside & fennel/anise stalk). Tonite all I had to do was open the bags & dump their contents in my roasting pan . By the way, I couldn't find a baking dish large enough for two 3.5 birds together in one dish that's why I used a roasting pan (it was the perfect reason for me to finally invest in an All Clad one!). Inspired by one of the reviews I brushed the tops of my chicken with maple syrup before putting in the oven. About a third of the way through I brushed their tops with olive oil. My guest raved when they walked in the door & everyone had seconds. I served this over Asian Jasmine rice. The chicken was falling off the bone. Highly recommend it! Next time will use capers & find fennel seeds.

The flavors in this dish just sing--- it's delicious. If you double the vegetables as some suggest, make sure that your baking dish is big enough to hold them in basically 1 layer. If you pack them in, they'll stew, not roast and carmelize--- and the carmelized bits are the best part!

This meal is amazing! I cooked it for the first time for my husband, mother-in-law, sis-in-law & her children and they were just floored with this dish. First off, when I placed it on the table they started ooohing & aahing because the vegetables looked so beautiful & the chicken was perfect golden brown. I was kinda nervous coz I didn't know how it would taste. Then they started eating and they just couldn't get enough. After seeing their reaction, I ate starting with the onions. Wow, the onions were so sweet & tender! The chicken was really moist & tender too (coz of all the yummy juices). I started raving about the dish as if I wasn't the one who cooked it! I definitely recommend this meal. Delicious yet easy to cook. I added a lot more vegetables than was called for the recipe. Instead of 1 I put in 5 large yellow onions, 8 tomatoes instead of 4 and I added about 10 yukon gold potatoes which everybody just loved. It's a bit tight when you place everything on the baking dish but it certainly was more than enough for 4 adults & 2 children, even w/ just 1 whole chicken. I adjusted the rest of the recipe accordingly (except for the chicken) to accommodate the additional vegetables. Plus I added 15 minutes to the baking time to make the chicken skin a bit more crispier. Yum! Will be doing this meal A LOT!

Rating: 2
I used a cut up chicken and probably 2 lbs. of tomatoes (too much), so there was a lot of juice in my shallow 9x13 pan. The picture shows a much deeper pan, which would probably have been better than my glass baking dish. Still, the chicken was very tender and the skin crispy. I left out the fennel seed because I didn't have any, but the herbs de provence gave everything a nice flavor. The roasted tomatoes came out so sweet. They were the best part of the meal. I probably won't make this again, but it was a filling weeknight dinner.

Delicious and couldn't be simpler. I followed the recipe exactly, and used Gaeta olives. Had plenty of pan juices without adding broth or wine. Served it with the Sauteed Greens with Cannellini Beans and Garlic from this site, crusty bread and a nice Rosso di Montefalco.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! I have made it with a whole chicken as well as with chicken breasts (bone in, with skin) and the last 5 minutes I put it on a low broil to make the skin crispy. All I have to say is this is my most requested chicken dish!

I was feeling pretty nervous about this recipe because I could not imagine cooking vegetables for an hour, but my boyfriend's exact words were "I cannot remember having chicken that was this good, ever. I don't usually go on and on about recipes, but this was amazing". I made the recipe exactly as written, except that I cooked it at 400 for an hour and fifteen in a conventional oven.

Absolutely amazing. I was out of black pepper, so I used white pepper instead. I couldn't find a ready made Herbes de Provence, so I looked online where there are various sites that give recipes on how to make it. I added zuchinni about 10 minutes before it was done and it came out just perfect. Crusty garlic bread is a must to accompany the delicious sauce.

One more thing - definitely double the veggie mixture and adjust the rub mixture to the amount of chicken you have (I think I tripled the amount). I added potatoes, which were OK - but the crusty bread and a great glass of wine are amust!

This dish was absolutley delicious! I used chicken thighs and legs (Bell and Evans), seasoned them with the wet salt/herb rub under the skin and browned them in a cast iron pan. I started baking the veggies while the chicken was browning. I added about 1 cup of white wine to the veggies after they were cooking for a while. When the chicken was almost browned, I added more of the wet rub thinned out with the juice of 1/2 lemon over the chicken and let it cook for a few more minutes. I then added the chicken to the roasting veggies (on top) and they continued to bake and brown beautifully. I also added some of the pan drippings to the roasting chicken and veggies. I decided to braise some thinly sliced fennel until it was carmelized and tender. I mixed the fennel in with the roasted veggies just prior to plating - this was a delicious addition and would make this a permanent part of the recipe.

Fabulous. The chicken and the vegatables were perfect. Using that pan sauce is a must. I added thinnly sliced fennel and baby carrots to the mix. Also I used much more garlic than called for. On the chicken, I doubled the olive oil mixture and added lemon juice to it as others have done. Then rubbed it under and over the skin and inside. My whole family thought this was one of the best ways to roast a chicken. And they are hard to impress!

I also pour 1 cup of chicken broth and 1 cup of white wine in the bottom of the pan. It makes a wonderful pan gravy.

I made this for lunch today and couldn't believe how wonderful the whole house smelled while it was roasting. The taste exceeded the aroma! I, too, added potatoes, half a lemon inside, lemon juice on the outside, and rubbed seasoning under the skin. Wish I had thought to add sliced fennel too! Next time! I would serve this for company and can't wait to cook it on the grill or in the brick oven this summer.

Followed reader who suggested chicken breasts,double the vegies, but used boneless thighs instead. Fold the seasoned but not floured thighs on top of the pre-roasted vegies, rub with a dab of brown sugar to omit the browning, bake 30 minutes at 375, and it's cheaper and easier by one step. Terrific!

I have never reviewed before because I don't consider myself a great cook. But this recipe made me look very very good! Made it for a friend recovering rom surgery. A perfect dish since everything is in one dish. They loved it and so did my husband and I. I used some of the suggestions from reviewers - added wine and fingerling potatoes. But the recipe is right-on including the cooking time - which is very unusual. I will make this often.

Loved this dish! We made it with boneless skinless breasts, using the same amount of seasonings used in the recipe. Instead of putting the extra herbs and oil under the skin, I just dredged one side of each breast in the herbs mixed with a spoon of flour. Omitted the minced garlic. I browned the breast in the oil for a good color. Had the vegetables pre- roasting for about 30 minutes. Put the half brownd breasts over the vegetables and finished roasting for about 15 to 20 minutes. Very moist and flavorful. Next time will use more vegetables. Easy and delish. Make this one!

This was truly outstanding. Personally, I find it's better to stuff the herb/garlic seasoning under the skin as opposed to smearing it on top, as it tends to burn that way so that's what I did. That, and squeezing a lemon half over the top are the only changes I made. Mine was done in 45 minutes in convection, but I did let it come to room temp first. Left it sit tented with foil for about 30 minutes, then poured the juices into a fat separater and darn that was good.
