I made the entire menu for a luncheon, and it was a big hit for a party of 10. The sausages spent a bit too much time on the grill, but it didn't matter; they were great anyhow with the various relishes, mustards and other tasty things. I served a platter of spicy sausages and a platter of mild ones, and I learned that my friends prefer spicy by about 3 to 1.
