I added about 1 T. finely chopped fresh rosemary & 1 t. cayenne. I rolled the whole thing into a log, and rolled the log in more chopped pecans. Then I cut of slices & baked for 17 minutes. These turned out okay but were too warm to slice really thin. So I refrigerated the log. Then I sliced super thin and baked about 15 minutes without pecan on top. They came out great. I added a thin slice of chilled chioggia beet on top. Heavenly!

I followed many of the great suggestions from previous posters. I threw in some goat cheese as well as cayenne pepper which gave a hint of zing. I agree that the blue cheese flavour is relatively subtle, but it was perfect with champagne before dinner. I too rolled the mixture into a log then rolled it in some extra toasted pecans and chilled the log for about 30 minutes. I cut thinnish slices (I ended up with about 45 crackers) and baked for 15 minutes. If I were serving this with a dip or spread I would definitely add salt to the mixture; however since I served them plain with drinks before dinner, unsalted was probably best.

very good-a nice touch to a cocktail party buffet. served with chutney. I added a 1/4 tsp dried rosemay and 1/2 tsp finely ground kosher salt - they were excellent. I made the whole thing in the processor in just minutes. chilled a large log and then sliced. baked for 20 minutes. perfect. the cheese looks like little holes when they are cooked.

So easy to make! Watch the timing. 35 min is way too long. Not overly blue cheesey. I plan to serve them with a pear chutney and cream cheese. But alone..just great. Would a pinch or two of cayenne pepper give them a little edge? I'm going to try next time.

I used Gorgonzola 4oz and Feta 1oz to make these crackers. They turned out a light, golden, rich, tasty treat that goes well with cocktails. They're a new favorite. Would make a nice addition to a gift basket of homemade goodies.

I have made these several times for dinner or cocktail parties and they are always a hit. (Plus, they make the house smells great.) Yes, they are fragile (don't cut too thin) and I will try the suggestion of adding rosemary, but I think they taste fine w/o alteration. The taste changes with the quality of the blue cheese you use.

I gave this recipe two forks, but also most likely will not make it again. I love homemade crackers and blue cheese so I thought this would be a real winner. Instead, I thought that the blue cheese flavor did not come through very strongly, and they were very, very crumbley. The ones I baked on my baking stone held up much better than those I did on a air sheet. Also, on half of them I sprinkled a bit of crushed rosemary and salt (at the suggestion of other posters) and they turned out much tastier. If I made these again, I would add salt and rosemary into the mix, and crush the pecans in my grinder instead of coursely with a knife.

I made these for a pre-dinner appetizer and served them with mulled apple cider. They were quite good and my family enjoyed them as a light munchie. I felt they needed just a tough more flavor, however, and will likely try some of the reviewers' suggestions of adding salt and rosemary. I will also play with making these smaller and shaping the dough into square or rectangular shapes since I'm not crazy about the "cookie appearance." Otherwise, these are very tasty and pair well with hot beverages or wine.

Delicious and very rich - a few go a long way. I doubled the recipe for a party and it worked fine. Like other reviewers, I found that 12-15 minutes in the oven was plenty. Be careful not to make them too thin - they are fragile and will crumble easily if overbaked.

These are very good. I served them with wine before dinner and they were a hit. I took the advice of another reviewer and added a bit of rosemary (dried. I crushed it up a bit before adding), and loved the subtle flavoring. Mine were done in 17 minutes (not 35).

These crackers are a great accompaniment for many soups or salads. I added 1/2 teaspoon of salt the second time I made them and they were much better. The baking time is more like 12 minutes.

I made these as part of a gift basket for my dad for Christmas. He liked them but confused them for cookies at first! (I had them labled.) They tasted great, and they go wonderfully with beer. However, while I'd make them again I don't know if I'd include them in a basket again; they are very fragile and most were broken by the time dad got to them. I too didn't need to bake them as long as the recipe called for. In fact, I think they spent 15 mins. max in the oven.

I got a lot of great responses to these -- although, since they look like cookies, it's important to let guests know that they're NOT. There's nothing like biting into what you think will be a sweet cookie and finding out you're biting into blue cheese flavor.

I was expecting to see that 100% would make this recipe again! Yes, they do look like cookies and the cooking time is WAY off (mine baked for 22 minutes), but they are an absolutely perfect appetizer. Everyone at our dinner party loved them and they paired so nicely with the other appetizers served -- the pear, leek & gruyere turnovers and pissaladiere. They weren't too greasy and were awesome with wine. This is one of my top 5 favorite recipes!

I made this for a pot-luck lunch at work and I couldn't believe how fast they were gone. It was quite humerous that even though I had made a big note stating they were savory - people picked them up with their dessert. It didn't matter as much to their surprise their totally delicious and it doesn't matter when you eat them.

I changed the recipe a bit, and it was wonderful! First, I added 4 ounces cream cheese to the butter and bleu cheese in the processor and creamed the mixture well. I added a sprinkling of salt, a teaspoon of ground rosemary and more pepper. I also added the pecans, toasted and chopped to the mixture. I had to add a bit more flour, then kneaded it and shaped as directed. 15 minutes was all it took. The cream cheese made them flaky and light and the rosemary gave it more flavor....delicious!

I've made this twice for Christmas parties - one brunch and one evening party. They are adictive for those who do not love sweets but do love cheese. Subtle flavor that pairs beautifully with a nice red wine. Cooking time must monitored and taken out before they burn at the edges. This is one of my stock recipes for large gatherings with a broad menu.

I cooked these for twenty minutes and they were almost over-cooked then. Also, they are really bland-not at all savory as an appetizer like this should be.

I found these to be okay. These are definetly for blue cheese lovers. I think the recipe needs a correction on time. I baked mine for 15 minutes and they were perfect.

This recipe was very disappointing. It burned easily and despite the interesting ingredients, had very little flavor. Like a prior review, my husband bit into one expecting something sweet and unpleasantly surprised.

I thought these were great, but you have to get over that they look like cookies.

I made these to serve as a snack around Thanksgiving. I am sorry to say that they were nearly inedible! My husband and i dearly love blue cheese, but the flavor was lost in this recipie. They were a little greasy, too. One of our guests found them in a tupperware in the pantry and thought they were cookies -- she was unpleasantly suprised to say the least!
