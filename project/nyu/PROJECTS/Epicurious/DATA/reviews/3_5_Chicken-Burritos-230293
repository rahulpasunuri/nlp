Good basic recipe. Used leftover bbq chicken, added chopped chilies.

I made it with refried beans - found it a bit too watery/soupy. Better process them separately. Either that, or put only half of the salsa. Otherwise you'll have a very drippy chicken burrito.

Made once as exactly written and it was very good. Made again and didn't have hot salsa so used mild and added some chopped jalapeños and cumin. Threw in two bell peppers with the onions and used flour tortillas. Yum!

I'm 15 and have recently started to cook quite a bit and have been looking for new recipes to share with my family. These burritos were easy to make and well recieved. They were also much healthier and much better tasting than the usual burritos that my family makes for dinner.

Excellent. I used a little less salsa, used refried black beans, 1/2 pack of taco seasoning in place of the chili powder ... I made the burritos ahead of time, then heated them at dinner and put cheese on top right at the end. Served with salsa and sour cream - delicious!

Very good and easy to make for a mid weekday meal. I add peppers with the onions, which adds more flavor.

This was really good, but a little bland. I think I'll add pico next time instead of salsa, and extra garlic. Still, this was a big hit.

VERY YUMMY! This recipe is a keeper. The only change I made is adding an extra clove of garlic--it was perfect!

Excellent. Used half a package of taco seasoning instead of chili powder because it was what I had on hand, increased salsa from 1/2 cup to 1 cup, and used a 19 oz can of beans.

This dish is quick, healthy and delicious. A great weeknight supper.

Who knew that lo-fat could taste so good! Only a few minor changes--used way more garlic (5 or 6 cloves), bought boneless, skinless chicken tenders (I think it was purdue) and I made my own homemade whole wheat tortillas which were wonderful. I highly recommend doing this instead of buying the packaged ones--it only takes a very little time and the difference between homemade and packaged is unbelievable! I also chopped some fresh cilantro and topped each burrito with it before folding. Served with the shredded spinach (bought fresh, not bagged--what a difference!) and made some baked spanish rice to accompany everything. Wonderful dinner.
