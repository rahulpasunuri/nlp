Well, I would make this again, but I did make it much simpler than the recipe. Living in the UK, we have cooking apples, which I used, chopped with just about 1 tablespoon water and a squeeze of lemon juice. Why add apple juice and apple sauce? The apples naturally purée, so then I added some good plum jam, which meant extra sugar wasn't needed. The rest I did pretty much as the recipe said. At first I thought the biscuit base was too thick and too dry, but with the apple/plum mixture on top and the meringue on top of that, it turned out fine. I didn't bother with piping the meringue, just piled it on as you would with lemon meringue pie.

No idea why this recipe has 4 forks if nobody has reviewed it until now. It tastes fine as the components are basically good, but applesauce with cookies or regular apple pie or most anything else would be better and less work. This is really nothing special.
