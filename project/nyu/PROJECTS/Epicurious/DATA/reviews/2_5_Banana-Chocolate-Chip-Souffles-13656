Great, light desert with subtle flavors. I substituted a single frozen chocolate truffle for the chips and placed it in the center. It does have a very light texture but not surprising considering its only egg whites without the heavier bechamel base. I will definately make it again.

This was very nice given the mixed reviews. It's a very simple and elegant dessert to make with staple ingredients. 15 minutes may be too long to cook - - after about 10, I noticed the tops were getting very brown and pulled them out. The texture inside was nice: moist and foamy - - I think 15 minutes would make them rubbery as one reviewer mentioned. I added a little vanilla extract for extra flavor and may try this again with raspberries for a different twist!

I agree w/Texas--this is not a souffle. Anyone who makes it shouldn't expect it to get a souffle. The texture was peculiar (rubbery) and the flavor was marginal. Next time I want a low-fat dessert, I'll eat a piece of fruit.

In response to all the complaints that this does not have the consistency of a regular souffle, guess what? It is NOT a regular souffle. What do you honestly expect for 120 calories per serving? Personally I really liked it and am more than willing to sacrifice the "souffle texture" for the low fat and calorie content. It is an easy, light dessert...perfect if you are craving something sweet at the end of a meal but don't want to blow your diet. I also served this to two non-weight-conscious males who thought it was pretty good.

This dish is wonderful. The texture is different than a true souffle, but the flavor is great. Give it a try.

The souffle was a huge disappointment. I will never make it again.

Considering how low-fat this recipe is it's quite yummy! It doesn't have quite the same texture as a normal souffle but it's still really good.

This recipe was more like a meringue than a souffle. It was thick and sort of rubbery. Not what I was expecting!
