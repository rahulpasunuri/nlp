really delicious and rich. used only one 8in spring form, exactly the right size, cut in 3 layers. was nice and moist. baked for at least 45min on 350. used all three sticks of butter in the icing, 11.5 oz ghirardelli milk chocolate & 2 oz baker's unsweetened chocolate. will make again. this one & chocolate stout cake are my favorite chocolate cakes so far =).

Delicious! The frosting does not need extra sugar, extra chocolate, or less butter. Everyone loved it. Also, my cake was plenty moist -- just kept a close eye on it so that it didn't over-bake. Will definitely make again.

This was fantastic! My daughters requested Chocolate Layer Cake with Milk Chocolate Frosting for our affair held at my grandparents residence and this is the recipe I used. It is easy to make. I will include this to my list of recipes that Ive got from www.everything-cake.com and www.gourmetrecipe.com! Thanks!

Made this cake for my husbands birthday but was thrilled with it. A bit dry although I made sure to watch the baking time. I will go back to my favorite which is the double chocolate cake recipe on this site.

Made this for a birthday party tonight --- rave reviews from everyone. It was certainly time- consuming, but the effort was well worth it. I followed the recipe to the letter with one exception: I used 2 sticks of butter in the frosting instead of 3. I did NOT use extra confectioner's sugar in the frosting as other reviewers have, and it turned out great. The only problem I had was being in a hurry towards the end: the butter wasn't quite soft enough so there were some flecks in the frosting. No matter: I just covered the whole thing with chocolate shavings. The cake itself was delicious - perfectly moist and very chocolate- y. It was a little delicate just after it had cooled, so I stuck the plastic-wrapped layers in the freezer for a few hours: problem solved. And it was much easier to frost that way too. Definitely recommend this recipe, as long as you set aside some time to make it as written.

I have not made the cake but have made the frosting several times and highly recommend leaving out one of the sticks of butter. It is unnecessary and makes it more chocolaty and flavorful. Other than that it a lovely frosting and makes the kitchen smell fantastic.

This was a delicious, extremely light and airy cake. I made cupcakes with it, and added an extra 2 oz of semi-sweet chocolate, with a bit of cream to smooth it out. Delish

I think the cake could use a little more sugar, otherwise the texture was perfect. I cut the butter in the frosting down to 2 sticks like the other reviewers suggested and found it to be delicious. Still on the quest for the perfect chocolate cake.

Just made the frosting in this recipe to go with Double layer chocolate cake found on Epicurious. Frosting was very good, but pretty labor intensive. I doubled the powdered sugar but made no other changes. Strong butter taste, but that's not exactly a bad thing!

This cake was much better after a day in the fridge. I found the cake to be a bit dry, and the frosting to be too buttery. Next time, I may add more butter to the cake batter, and less butter and more confectioners sugar to the frosting. The frosting could use a touch more chocolate too.

Rating: 0
I bake a lot, but this may be the thing that has gotten the most compliments. One friend ate it all weekend for breakfast. I did make a couple changes: CAKE - Used cake flour rather than all-purpose flour. FROSTING - 3 (not 1-1/3) cups confectioner's sugar; 2 (not 3) sticks butter; semisweet chocolate instead of milk chocolate. I also kept it simple with two rather than 4 layers. This cake is labor-intensive but incredibly delicious!

Rating: 4
I've made the frosting twice - excellent! At first I, too, was worried about the amount of butter that the recipe called for, and I did add more chocolate - perhaps about 14 oz. (semi and unsweetened) and more sugar the first time. The second time I did not add extra sugar and the final product was delicious. Will definitely make this again.

I liked the result, but had to add A LOT more confectioner's sugar to the frosting. I think there might be a typo(?). 3 sticks of butter to 1 1/3 cups of sugar is not an appropriate ratio for a frosting. More sugar please!

I have been making this cake since I saw it in Gourmet magazine in 2004! I was living in France at the time, and happened to pick up the magazine at a British book store. I was really wanting to make a chocolate layer cake for my daughter's 14th birthday, and the French don't do those cakes. We have nic named this cake "Caitlin's Chocolate Cake," because I make it every year for her birthday, it is that good!!!

I made this for my good friend's birthday and it was divine!!! I can't tolerate wheat flour so I used spelt and it was amazing. I didn't cut the cakes in half though, so just did a two layer cake and it was perfect. The frosting is to die for. I will be making this again and I'm certain it would make perfect cupcakes too! Definitely try it, you won't be disappointed!

I used the frosting recipe for the sides of a German Chocolate Cake- the frosting as written was much too fluffy- I added extra confectioners sugar to thicken things up and add some body. Nice and light. Would use again with same adjustments.

Rating: 4
Nice compromise between hominess and sophistication; quite chocolate-y but not too much so. The frosting was successful, but only after it dawned on me to quit using the same KitchenAid "paddle" beater I'd used for the batter. I'd seen the paddle beater wreck a mousse a few years ago - it starts to churn the fat into droplets. Once I switched to the whisk beater, the rest of the butter incorporated nicely, and I used all three sticks.

I just finished a piece of this delicious cake. I made it with my sister, and everyone LOVED it. Moist, but not too heavy, this cake was the perfect texture. We didn't have the time to make the icing, so we used a store bought vanilla icing. Because we didn't have buttermilk, I followed the advice of a previous reviewer, and used 1 1/2 cups of milk, and 2 tsp. of lemon juice, and it worked excellently. Otherwise, I followed the directions to the letter, and ended up with a scrumptious cake. Yum.

Rating: 2
This recipe tasted delicious, but the cakes were very soft and hard to split into four layers. Also, I did not have enough frosting to frost the sides of the cake, so it looked very home-made, which was fine, but not what I had envisioned. next time, I will keep it to 2 layers and will have enough of the frosting to go around.

This was a wonderful cake. I followed the directions to a T and because of little things like having the eggs at room temperature for 30 minutes and having the chocolate melted and cooled but not hardened, it took a very long time to make...about four hours. But this was my first time making a cake from scratch so I don't think it will take as long next time. I topped the cake with fresh organic raspberries around the edge of the top and the bottom and it looked beautiful. I also made a three out of the raspberries since it was my son's third birthday. Everyone at the party raved about the cake and how decadent it was. Everything about it was outstanding. I will definitely make it again.

I made this cake for a friend's birthday . . . it was fantastic!! I left the frosting vanilla though, and only used 2 sticks of butter . . . it worked great on the cupcakes, with some left over, but I'm not sure how much you would need with the actual cake.

I made this cake last night for my mum's birthday today. I don't keep buttermilk on hand so I let 1 1/2 cups of milk and 2 tsp of lemon juice stand for about 10 minutes and reduced the amount of butter in the frosting to 2 cups. The cake was nothing short of amazing- soft, fluffy chocolate cake sandwiched between decadent layers of silky chocolate frosting. I'm not a fan of cakes, especially chocolate cakes (I've tried way too many dry store bought ones) but this had me and my family completely swooning!

Rating: 4
This is a WONDERFUL cake and I can only wonder what people did who were disappointed in it. I made this cake as an impromptu treat for my husband. It was a bit of a mop-up of ingredients before we moved so I made a number of small changes. I used only granulated brown sugar, no vanilla and milk treated with vinegar instead of buttermilk. For the frosting I only had 2 egg yolks, 2 sticks of butter, still no vanilla and...sadly...sacrificed an Easter bunny as the chocolate for the frosting. Despite all those changes, it was still fabulous. Definitely the best cake I've ever had. This will become a staple and will definitely be the cake for my son's birthday in October. Make it! You won't be sorry!

Rating: 4
Following others' advice, I used cake flour and only two sticks of butter in the frosting. Divine! Beware that when the recipe calls for 2-inch cake pans, your mother's 50-year-old 1 1/4" pans are not big enough, and the batter will overflow! After cleaning up the oven, I did not have the strength to cut each layer in half before frosting, but it was delicious just the same. This is a very forgiving frosting that hid almost all flaws. Will definitely make again!

Rating: 1
Haven't even tasted the cake yet but the frosting was sorely lacking. It tasted like chocolate butter. Had to doctor it quite a bit before I'd even put it on the cake--added a lot more powdered sugar. Not worth the hassle at all. I've made a lot better frosting without making a custard first.

Rating: 4
My friend and I used the cake recipe for cupcakes and they were great! We didn't have unsweetened chocolate, so we substituted the same amount of semi-sweet chocolate chips and cut back on the sugar by about 2 to 3 tbsp. Although the chips didn't melt quite like baking chocolate would have, it didn't affect the final product and the cake was just as moist and delicately chocolatey as we hoped. I think it had to do with creaming the butter a lot, which allowed the final batter to be light and airy. We also adjusted the baking time for the cupcakes, and they were done in about 15-17 minutes. Once they cooled, we topped them off with cream cheese frosting. Delicious!

My husband was dreaming of a chocolate cake for his birthday and I decided to give this recipe a try, although I was a little wary of the other reviewers who thought the cake was dry. We thought it was moist and delicious, well worth the five (!!) sticks of butter. A word of advice though, don't make the same mistake I accidently made the first time - if you add hot melted chocolate to the frosting it will deflate! The only downside to making this cake is having an irresistible cake containing five sticks of butter in your refrigerator . . .

I was looking for a good buttercream icing for some vanilla bean cupcakes and this is delicious! I made a couple modifications.. I used 4oz bittersweet chocolate & 4 oz semi-sweet, rather than milk chocolate. I thought the milk chocolate might make it too sweet.. used a little less butter and a little more icing sugar to make it slightly thicker.. by using the semi-sweet/ bittersweet chocolate mixture it was possible to use more sugar and not have it turn out too sweet...delicious and rich! I look forward to making the cake as well!

i was a bit dubious about even trying this recipe as i don't have an electric mixer, but i used a good whisk and it turned out fantastic. deliciously moist, not at all dry like some of the other reviewers reported. fantastic frosting too, made it the night before and refrigerated it (if you go this route, count on at least 3 hours in a warm room for it to soften back to spreadable consistency!). it took all my willpower not to bury my face in the bowl and slurp it all up :P two thumbs up, i'll definitely make it again.

I used this frosting recipe to frost a cake made from a box (blasphemy I know) and it made the cake a true star. Next time, I'll make the cake from scratch in order to do the frosting justice though. I found that the recipe for the frosting was more frosting than I needed and unfortunately the frosting couldn't be saved, but other than that - I'd absolutely make the frosting again, although as noted, it is more work than most.

Made the frosting but not the cake, opting instead for a Joy of Cooking lemon butter cake. The frosting was fabulous -- rich, creamy and smooth and with a dense milk chocolate flavor that wasn't too sweet. It does get very firm in the fridge and then a bit too soft once on the cake, which meant it couldn't be piled on all that thickly, although I guess being soft makes it perfect for filling layers. When I was beating in the melted chocolate the mixture started to get a bit grainy, but I just continued beating at high speed and the frosting became nice and smooth. I suspect it wouldn't do too well for long on a hotter day than the lousy summer days we get in SF, because of the potential to melt from rather soft into a goopy mess. Leftovers are good on toast!

Silver Palate Cookbook's Decadent Chocolate Cake is one of the easiest and best chocolate cakes in the world. It has been my standard for many years, but my daughter saw the photo and begged me to make it for her sweet 16 party. The icing looks like way too much work, but we struck a compromise: I increased the measurements by half for a dramatic 6-layer presentation, put ganache between the layers, and covered it all with the easier Silver Palate chocolate icing. The cake itself is moist and flavorful without being too sweet. I've made it for several other parties now, to songs of praise and adoration from all who've eaten it.

I made this cake for my Dads birthday and must say that, as chocolate cakes go, it is not the best I've had. The cake is dense and chocolatey, yes, but dry. The icing barely makes up for this dryness. The frosting is light and fluffy with excellent chocolate flavor. I would keep the icing recipe and find another for the cake layers.

I have tried many chocolate cake recipes over the years and this is absolutely the best so far. It is incredibly moist and chocolatey, and the frosting is very light and has a creamy flavor due to the milk chocolate. I used cake flour and I think that was partly responsible for the cake's very fine crumb. Two sticks of butter in the frosting is plenty. Also: don't make this cake a day ahead, as it will dry out, even if well-wrapped. If eaten within hours of baking, this cake is very special indeed.

dry? are you kidding me, this is my staple recipe! i do use pastry flour instead of all-purpose flour and i use the caramel milk-chocolate frosting intsead of this frosting (even though this frosting is just as good i just have too many egg whites as it is). People have paid me to make this cake for them and you know its a good recipe just by the ingrediants. it has buttermilk, which is such a nice subtle tangy compliment to the rich choclate flavour and it makes it so moist. it has both cocoa powder and melted chocolate which is the perfect chemestry for the perfect chocolate cake.

Not difficult to make, but DRY! I followed advice from other comments and even added a layer of ganache with Kahlua, which should've added moisture, but it was still dry...not worth the time or expense.

I've made this cake twice and it was pretty bland both times. I think adding Kahlua or espresso powder to the icing would help add some flavor. Or add a little powdered ginger and cinnamon to the cake recipe. We made this again last night and painted the layers with spiced rum before icing, and it was infinitely improved.

An excellent cake! This has become my tried-and-true chocolate cake base for wedding & special occasion cakes.

Oops! I just realized that I posted my comments on the wrong recipe. It was actually the Chocolate Cake with CARAMEL Milk Chocolate Frosting that I wanted. So if you're looking for a good recipe (and you don't think I'm a total idiot by now) then go ahead and give that one a try!

I made this cake for my sister's birthday and everyone raved! The cake was light, tender and flavorful and the frosting lush and chocolaty, but not too dense or rich (I added a little Frangelico and Kahlua for added flavor and beat in an extra Tbsp of cream to loosen). I followed other cooks' recommendations and used pastry flour instead of all-purpose flour and reduced the butter in the frosting by a stick. Seperating each layer into two after cutting was a bit of a challenge because the cake was so delicate, but well worth it.

Rating: 4
This is probably the best chocolate cake I have ever made. The cake is moist but firm enough to cut into layers easily. The icing is superb as written: not too sweet with a beautiful consistency and the recipe makes an adequate amount to frost the cake generously. Like the other cooks who have commented, I receive rave reviews from young and old. Terrific!

Rating: 4
I use this frosting recipe in the small fine dining restaurant where I am the pastry chef. Customers love it! I skip the dark chocolate and just use 24 oz of milk chocolate. My advice is to refrigerate the chocolate caramel mixture overnight, then use it straight from the fridge. Just whip half at a time if your mixer can't handle the full batch (mine can't!). Even in my hot kitchen I have no trouble with the frosting getting soft.

Rating: 0
It just occurred to me that the dryness problem might be because of the use of all-purpose flour rather than cake flour. I automatically substitute cake flour in all my cakes. All-purpose flour is too easy to over beat and get the production of too much gluten making the cake heavy and dry. As another reviewer stated you food is only as good as the ingredients! Good luck and happy baking!

I made this cake with the Caramel Milk Chocolate frosting also from this site. I found the cake to be perfect.

In general I would agree with the negative reviews. I found this cake easy to make, but very dry. I took one look at the forsting and decided that it was not worth the effort, so I made the CHOCOLATE BUTTERCREAM recipe (search for it here), which was easy to make and quite delicious.

I always find it interesting to read the reviews of recipes. In this case, I can't believe anyone out there found this cake dry, bitter or bland!! This must be one of the best chocolate cakes I, or anyone I have served it to, has ever tasted. Cooking times obviously vary by accuracy of oven temps. But if you're using good quality chocolate and butter and vanilla, there's simply no way this cake could be construed as BLAND. Try Ghiradelli cocoa and milk chocolate chips. And for heaven's sake, buy good butter -- like Land o Lakes.

Yum, yum and yum again. This makes one gigantic, scrumptious cake! It came out looking exactly like the picture too, which impressed me. I used Scharffen Berger Milk Chocolate for the frosting (and just added all the butter at once, why not. Looked sort of curdled until I added the melted -- in the microwave -- chocolate.) and Ghiradelli Cocoa for the cake...it was rich and chocolatey, and really really good. It did take time, and waiting for the cake to cool is essential, but as most other reviewers noted, it is well worth it. I am not much of a baker (well, really, not much of a froster) but this I will make again. ONE note, I used those Silpat baking pans, because that is all I have, but I think if I make this again I will buy regular pans because there was leftover batter.

I have NEVER had so many compliments on a cake as I did on this one...and I've made many others that are "fancier" and MUCH more labor intensive. The frosting was a big time consuming...not in labor - just the wait between steps, but now that I know that I'll budget my time better and will DEFINITELY make again!!

It's incredibly time consuming, but definetly worth it (and I'm not usually a big fan of cake).

I used the cake portion of the recipe to make a small wedding cake. I multiplied the recipe by about 5 and made the cake one week in advance. I soaked each layer in simple syrup, frosted it (with a different frosting) and wrapped each cake very thoroughly in plastic wrap. Left it in the freezer for one week. I finished decorating the cake the day of the party and served it that night. It was very moist. If you are worried about a cake being moist, you can always apply generous amounts of simple syrup with a pastry brush (epicurious proabably has the instructions on how to make simple syrup. it's very easy)A few people have said that this is one of the best cakes they have ever eaten. I used high-quality chocolate and cocoa powder. It's expensive but food can only be as good as its ingredients.

This cake was great - the best chocolate cake I have ever made. I found 30 min to be a good baking time. I kept it as a two layer cake as the layers seemed a little thin and I didn't trust myself to cut them successfully. Also, this helped keep the cake remain moist for a few days. The icing was very different than any other I've tried - very buttery and as a result a little sloppy. In order to get it to set a bit, I put the iced cake in the fridge for 30 min and the result was great.

Delicious. Given the reviews I was worried about the cake being dry but it stayed deliciously moist until the cake was completely consumed -- four days. This was my first chocolate cake and I found the recipe easy to follow and true to time requirements. A hit.

The icing for this cake is not the easiest (note: I am a novice cook), but was absolutely the best icing I have ever made. My twelve year old son has requested it as his Birthday cake again next year. Allow enough time to make this dessert and you will be well rewarded with a lovely cake that will not dissapoint any company.

This cake was surprisingly good. I thought, "but it's just a chocolate cake . . . ." Sometimes, simple and unimaginative is good.

my reviews are usually in harmony with other reviewers but this is an exception... and an exceptional cake. Quite frankly it is the best chocolate cake I have ever made (and I've made plenty!). The frosting was amazing--a welcome change from chocolate buttercream (yulch!) and ganache (too rich for some people). Even the non-chocolate lovers at the party loved this one (preferred over a white cake with berry filling and white chocolate frosting!). I removed the cake layers at about 20 minutes. I also wrapped them in multiple layers of saran wrap until the next day, when I made the frosting and assembled and served. I can't attest to it's staying power beyond the fact that the one slice I reserved (the only one that survived!!!) for a friend got rave reviews when I retrieved it from the fridge for her the next day. I wouldn't recommend modifying the pan sizes on this recipe, as the proportion of cake:frosting seems to be ideal. Peace.

excellent! made for valentines dinner using valrhona cocoa powder in the cake. i agree that 25 minutes in oven put the cake on its way to dry, but i thought flavor of layers and frosting was delish. it held up pretty well wrapped tighly with plastic wrap pressed to exposed cake surfaces. definetly would make it again, and do 20 minutes on the layers.

I have made many cakes from scratch, this one diffinitely doesnt hold up after the first day, it has no staying power for moisture, I like the frosting and would make a chocolate cake with mayonaise instead next time, the other are correct by making sure not to overbake, I knew that with scratch cake that is a must be accurate, however this diffinitely is a dry cake. Wouldnt reccomend

This cake was labor intensive (not necessarily a bad thing, of course), but we weren't impressed given the amount of work required. The frosting lacked flavor and the cake was on the bitter and dry side. We threw away the last half of it last night, we never throw cake away!

This is a very smooth, moist cake with rich chocolate flavor.

I actually made this cake twice in one weekend, so my husband and I could try it out first before it went to the office for a colleague's birthday. I'm very glad I did a test run! I am not the best cook or baker, but I followed the recipe exactly...stopped baking at 25 minutes...and the cake was dry and overbaked. The second time around I baked it for 20 minutes and I'm told it was perfect. The frosting was great -- I would make this again.

Dark brown sugar added an unpleasant bite to the cake; frosting made as directed tastes like butter rather than chocolate. Together the cake and frosting are ok (not bad but not great).

The cake part was kind of bland and dry but certainly not unbearable. The icing was great though. I used 2 1/2 sticks of butter and it was still pretty rich.

This cake was great! Icing and cake both turned out well - I guess you could leave out a stick of butter here or there, but it's chocolate cake, not health food - why bother? I guess you could substitute splenda for the sugar, maybe soy milk for the whole milk... I would make this again (though for special occasions) and not change a thing!

This cake was a huge disappointment!!! I consider myself to be an above average baker. I would never make this again. The actual cake had a chocolate flavor which was way to mild. I would add more chocolate. The texture of the cake was moist and would probably be better with a different frosting. The frosting---well you may as well have spread butter right on your cake. It was terrible! Do not waste your time on this one.

Wonderful chocolate layers - although I used the caramel milk chocolate frosting recipe from this site instead of the one above - I will keep this layer cake recipe as a standby - easy, moist, delicious!

I must have done something wrong because my cake just didn't turn out right. The cake was too dry and the icing was too buttery. It made for an overall disapppointment. I may try it again with some of the suggestions from other reviewers.

Absolutely sinful! I tasted the icing with 2 sticks of butter and it tasted just as good as with the 3 sticks of butter. Next, time I am going to use 2 sticks like the other reviewer. I had plenty of icing so the third stick really isn't needed. No wonder the cake is so great with 5 whole sticks of butter in it!!! This is a winner!!!!

This got high marks from the kids and the adults at our house. I used 1/2 cup of egg substitute in place of the yolks in the custard, and also left out a stick of butter in the frosting. I think it was probably a softer frosting for that omission, but it was still very good and I didn't feel quite as guilty!

I made this cake for my husband's birthday. He said that it was the best chocolate cake he had ever tasted. The frosting is the perfect compliment to the cake.

Made this cake for my wife's birthday. I reduced some strawberries with sugar and brandy. Once the mixture had cooled, I added it in between each layer. My wife, and family loved the cake. It was one of the best cakes we ever had, and the frosting was fantastic.

Very, very good.

Wonderful! No problems, no changes - and the 4 layers looks impressive (to everyone who doesn't know how easy it is!)!

This is a fantastic chocolate cake. Worth every fat gram and carb. I did cut down the butter in the frosting by a stick and it was fine. I think the frosting is the crowning glory of this recipe. Would be great on any cake you would want a chocolate frosting. I'm trying very hard to give the left-overs away before I consume every delicious crumb. A chocolate lovers delight.

I made this cake for dessert for the SuperBowl (GO PATS!) and it was delicious. The cake on its own was pretty good but the frosting was really out of this world. And the combination made the cake really gourmet tasting. I'd make it again, and maybe use the frosting on another cake. It did the full 2 hours to make the whole thing. I wonder if the frosting really needs to have 3 sticks of butter??

Simply the most perfect chocolate frosted layer cake that I have ever tasted.
