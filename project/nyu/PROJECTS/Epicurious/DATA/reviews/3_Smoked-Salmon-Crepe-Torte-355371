I'd give this 4 forks for ease, 2.5 for the filling's flavor. I cheated and used store-bought crepes, and was able to make this up the night before a holiday brunch. I'd make it again just because it was so easy and my guests liked it. Easy-Peasy and I got to enjoy their company instead of being stuck in the kitchen preparing the meal. Bonus.
