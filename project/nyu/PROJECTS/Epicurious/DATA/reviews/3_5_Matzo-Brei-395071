A barely adequate recipe, as far as it goes, but the real deal requires that you separate the eggs, beat the whites into a lovely high foam, gently fold in the yolks and then crumble in matzo that has been softened by holding under running water, salted, then allowed to sit for a minute wrapped in a tea towel. Heaven.

We like the savory variety of fried matzoh. Saute any amount of yellow onion according to your taste. Soften the matzoh with hot water and drain well. Add salt & pepper. Add to the fry pan and cook till crisp. Really tasty!!!!

Soaking the matzoh, which has been broken into about 2" square chunks, one minute in cold water works for me. Forget the pepper and add vanilla. Mix with beaten eggs and fry in oil or butter. Serve with sprinkled sugar. I also have a friend who serves sour cream and caviar with this dish. This dish should be closer to French toast than to pancakes.

I have been making this for years and just called it Matzo with eggs. Never knew it had a proper name. I do change the ingredients slightly from time to time, but basically, it is Matzo with eggs and some seasonings. Grew up with my Mom making it.

Boiling hot water over matzo's will make mush. I believe a matzo brei should have structure and shouldn't look like an unfinished product. My recipe: 3 matzohs held under warm running water and broken into thirds while still under the water. Crush matzo with hands into a bowel. Add 2 eggs, some milk, salt and pepper to taste, mix well and then pour into a moderately heated buttered pan, just large enough to make a round shape. Use a fork to even the matzo's out. Cook one side until slightly crispy, then flip and cook until side is done. Mange with strawberries, jams, sugar, your choice.

Always loved this! Does seem like a lot of egg for just 2 sheets of matzoh- I'd do 1 with a little milk. And, it does fill your stomach like a rock but oh so good!

I ate this as a kid and I loved it. I do not like it with all the extra flavorings and fruit as suggested. Give it to me plain. Onions would be good, however.

My mother used to make us Matzo Brei ironically for our christmas breakfast,to bring the two faiths together. She would add milk to the eggs as well as a touch of sugar and cinnamon to give it a french toast flavor. To this day I make it for my older brothers at a gathering to bring us sweet memories of our mom.

Oh my goodness...where to begin. First slowly saute some onions, then add only the dampened matzo and cook until the matzo starts to get crispy....Then add the eggs. I eat it savory with salt and my kids and husband use syrup. Either way this is much better!

Growing up my Mom used to make this for us every weekend. It's a great dish but so many ways to make it better such as adding in a little almond extract, nutmeg or cinnamon, some chopped apples or raisins. You can almost do whatever you want to this dish to make it 4 forks. Usually, any one of these is enough but apples or raisins and cinnamon do go pretty well together.
