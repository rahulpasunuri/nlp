If I hadn't given up chocolate for Lent this year, I would never have found these cookies. They are fantastic... I made it with 1/2 regular flour and 1/2 rice flour (didn't have whole wheat) and I made my own trail mix our of dried cranberries, raisins, walnuts, cashews, almonds, pumpkin seeds, flax seeds.... They came out kind of crisp but they melted in your mouth. These have become a staple since you can freeze the dough and just put in them in the oven when ever you need them.
