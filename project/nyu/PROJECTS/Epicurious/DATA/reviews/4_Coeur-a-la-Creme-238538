I think Coeur à la Crème has to be the most perfect dessert if you're trying to impress. This recipe is shockingly easy and the end result is absolutely delicious. I've used this recipe twice now and in both cases my guests have been thoroughly impresed! It's light and delicate, but full of flavour. And you can literally serve it with just about any fruit! I also like to add a shortbread finger and have been toying with the idea of a lemon/ginger crust....

This recipe is a pretty pretty classic one, and so this coeur a la creme was very good, as usual. I actually only own a single larger mold, but the proportions worked great. I served it with sliced peaches with almond extract with great success.

I had purchased the mold years ago at a garage sale and finally looked for a recipe. So glad I found this one. So easy and delicious and makes for a great presentation. I like chocolate so I melted a couple of high quality chocolate bars and stirred them. Also, I had plain yogurt and used that instead(skipped the lemon juice) of sour cream or creme fraiche. I did need to adjust the sweetness somewhat. Also I outlined the mold with whole fresh raspberries which I used instead of strawberries before I poured in the filling. Looked terrific!

I used one big heart shaped cake pan which I pounded holes into the bottom of. That's ok because I will make this again.

This is a fabulous dessert to present to guests. I did not have the molds so I used the paper cups. Poke holes from inside so the cheeses drain better for a solid creme. I've used other creme recipes. This is the best one. The slow method of making creme fraiche is best (1TBS butter milk to 1 cup heavy cream set out over night).
