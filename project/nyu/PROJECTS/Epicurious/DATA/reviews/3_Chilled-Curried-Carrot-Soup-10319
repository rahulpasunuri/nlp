The first time I made this soup my dinner guest liked it. The next time I made it I doubled the amount of curry and felt that it had more flavor. It's a quick and easy recipe!

I think this is an excellent recipe - I use it in the dead of winter because, as a hot dish, it's comfort food. I am a vegetarian and I just add tofu, some roasted vegetables or a hard boiled egg to the basic recipe and I have a delicious, nutritious lunch.

I love curry so I was very excited about this soup. I used a curry mix that a friend of mine brought from Africa and added some Sriracha for kick. I will definately make this again.

It was okay, but not special. Maybe I'd have liked it better if I hadn't slopped it all over the kitchen while trying to pour it into the processor.
