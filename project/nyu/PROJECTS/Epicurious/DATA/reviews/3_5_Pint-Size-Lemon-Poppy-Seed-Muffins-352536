This is an amazing recipe! I tried it with my family and they loved them. I wasn't sure how the poppyseeds would taste, but i was wrong, they were great!

I followed the advice of others and added more lemon zest and half of the poppyseeds. This is a great recipe and has made it in my permanent recipe box. I served these at a brunch, and they were a complete hit. My children also loved them as well. Enjoy!

Baked 22 minutes and tops were still very pale. Went to 24 minutes and tops were still pale and by this time they were a bit overbaked, perhaps. A bit too dry and chewy. I agree with a previous reviewer, while they were good, they weren't fantastic and tasted like the were missing something despite using the zest and juice. They still didn't taste lemon-y enough for me.

Yum! definately add the extra zest and lemon juice..flavor is a little pale w/o it. Reduce bake time to 12 min. I pushed a big blueberry in the center of each muffin and topped with lavender sugar. Really fun taste. I also made some of these as written. Both good.

very good - perfect for Easter brunch. Have a daughter who is alergic to milk so used Earth Balance and the juice of 2 lemons - made up the rest of the fluid with almond milk - and they turned out great. Even better with a little dollop of lemon icing!

Not sure if i like them that much... I feel these muffins are missing some taste, maybe a bit sweeter? or more lemon?

Excellent! Made just like the recipe called for except cut back on the poppy seeds like others had suggested. Served them to guests and they were gone in no time.

I turned these into Sparkling Poppy Seed Muffins with the addition of Champagne, Orange, and Ginger. The recipe posted is great, even with my many alterations, it turned out just right. The muffins are light, fluffy, and possess the perfect crunch. My muffin tops even had a subtle crunch. I posted my recipe on my blog www.sweetpotatosoul.com

These were great! I used fat-free plain yogurt instead of the buttermilk (same amount)and 3 Tbsp of poppy seeds - not 1/4th cup. Very moist and flavorful!

For a buffet brunch party, I did only mini and small baked goods so everyone could try many different things. These were an excellent addition with the bright lemon flavor. Very popular and froze well as I made them ahead.

I made these delightful little morsels today. I followed the recipe to the tea, but added an extra tablespoon full of lemon juice, zest from 3 lemons and only baked them for 15 minutes. I also made a honey/lemon butter to spread on them. It was a very good choice.

We thought these were awesome. I didn't have buttermilk but followed another reviewer's advice in adding the juice of 1 lemon to the milk, also added zest of 2 lemons, otherwise followed the recipe. Will be making these again.

After reading some of the reviews, I revised this as follows: Used a generous 1/8th cup of poppy seeds. Used 1 cup minus 2 tablespoons of regular milk, doubled the lemon juice, and added it to the milk to sour. It sat while I got everything else together. I did not cream anything. Instead, I melted the butter, whisked the eggs into the melted butter, then whisked in the sour milk. Because I didn't cream anything, more lift was needed, so I used 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda and 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder. I also added 1/16 teaspoon of pure lemon oil (not extract - pure lemon oil is very strong so go easy). I mixed the wet into the dry with a spoon, then spooned into a regular muffin tin sprayed with non-stick spray. There is no reason to take the time to butter then flour anything. They were great, and my method was a lot faster.

Excellent recipe! I followed some of the other reviewers' advice and doubled the zest and lessened the sugar. I used jogurt instead of buttermilk and the full amount of poppy seeds. Will definitely make again!

Recipe came out well after a few adjustments. I subbed non-fat vanilla yogurt in place of the buttermilk and only baked the muffins for 14 minutes. They came out light and fluffy, very tasty. Next time, I'll increase either the zest or the juice because the lemon extract I added was not pungent enough to pump up the lemon flavor.

Very good recipe, but like other reviewers mentioned, some tweaks are in order. I made the recipe exactly as stated, but next time I will add less poppy seeds and double the zest.

These were OUTSTANDING!!! :) Made them for Easter dinner and everyone loved them.... my cousin thought they were from a high class bakery in town!!! The trick is to only cook them for about 10-12 minutes to keep them moist and not dry!!! Delectable! ;)

I reduced the poppy seeds to a generous 1/8 cup, increased the lemon peel to 3T and added 1/2 t of lemon oil. The result was a muffin with a pleasantly prominent lemon flavor. I added a lemon flavored powdered sugar glaze for an extra zing. I will definitely make this again.

My husband and brunch guests loved them. I used half the poppy seeds (1/4 cup is way too much) and more lemon zest. I'll use even more next time. I had extra batter and made about five regular sized muffins along with the 36 minis.

I didn't have the lemon zest, or buttermilk so I substituted with 1/4t. lemon oil extract, and sour cream mixed with heavy cream. Taste results were good but too many poppy seeds and I was even short apprx. 1T. on the full 1/4c. This recipe yielded 16 regular size cupcake. Reduced oven temp to 325, and baked for 18 mins. using convection. Might improve presentation with a few drops of yellow food coloring.

I used less sugar, white wheat flour and yogurt, and topped with a sprinkle of sugar before baking. Everyone agreed more lemon zest would help carry the flavor through but the muffins are fantastic!

Very good. Not a make-with-one-eye-open-just-after-rolling-out-of-bed recipe, but a bit of prep the night before could help it along towards that status. (And would certainly boost it to 4 forks.) I was out of white sugar so I used light brown. And I used yogurt in place of the buttermilk, but I'm going to do it again soon with b-milk. The whole family loved these.

Tasty to be sure. I followed the previous review for making full-size muffins & used low-fat yogurt which was on hand. If I make them again, I will double the lemon zest since the lemon flavor didn't come through for me. Still on the search for perfect L-PS Muffin recipe.

Very, very good. I made the mini-muffins & used a convection oven & they only took 18 minutes to bake.

Delicious! I, too, used plain yogurt since I didn't have any buttermilk on hand. I also used 12 regular-sized muffins and they came out great.

These were delicious! I used plain yogurt instead of the buttermilk, with excellent results, as I did not have milk on hand. The recipe made 12 regular sized muffins, baked at 375 for 22 minutes.
