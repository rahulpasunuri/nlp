Delish, and a very forgiving recipe! If you are short on time and ingredients, the recipe is flexible and can withstand some subs. Here's how I adapted to my time frame and ingredients on hand: used large boneless skin-on breasts, cut into pieces; subbed whole milk for the buttermilk (tenderized the chicken nicely, though buttermilk would probably be better); marinated the chicken for 1.5 hours max (chicken turned out moist and tasty, but next time I'll marinate longer); adjusted the oven time to 40 minutes, all that was needed in a convection oven) The panko mixture adhered well to the chicken, and did not burn in the hot oven. After one bite, my husband said it was a keeper. Bonus: I'll slice the leftovers into strips and serve over a nice salad. Easy peasy! I gave it 4 stars simply because the recipe was really tasty due to the nice choice of spices, and it was verrry forgiving of my subs.

Great taste, and the hot pepper sauce gave a nice, friendly kick. Quartered the chicken breasts and used panko as suggested by other reviewers. Wish I'd have doubled the breadcrumb ingredients! Had to scrimp on the last few pieces of chicken.

this is the first recipe i've made from epicurious that i believe deserves four forks! after reading reviews, the only change i made to the recipe was halving the thyme. it marinated for four hours, and after breading, cooked in my convection oven @ 400F x 40min. crispy on the outside, extremely moist on the inside... this is the best "fried" chicken i've ever had. the only change i'll make next time is to use grapeseed oil instead of the olive oil in the marinade and in place of the last-step butter... it has a much higher smoke point, so hopefully will be kinder to the interior of my oven. LOVE IT!

I'd rate this 10 forks if possible. I love the versatility of this recipe and usually prepare it at least once a month. It works best with dark meat pieces. The only change I've made is to increase the dry ingredients by half so all chicken is evenly coated. I like to occasionally change up the recipe by substituting crushed cheese crackers or crushed chicken-flavored crackers for the breadcrumbs. The liquid mixture makes a great marinade for onion rings before breading and frying/baking, giving a nice flavor and something for the breading to adhere to.

Like others, I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and panko bread crumbs. My husband absolutely loved them, even saying he didn't miss fried chicken at all.

I have made this recipe since it was first published. My husband and kids really love it. My 12 year old asked for it for his birthday dinner. I use boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Usually start the marinade on Sunday and then cook on Wednesday/Thursday. I use sweet vidalia onions and also bread and bake them. They don't need quite as long as the chicken to bake. My husband and kids always want me to make extra so they can have it for lunch the next day!

I made this for a picnic... and while it was edible cold, it was much better the next day after it was warmed and re-crisped. Definitely not too hot (good grief!). I used extra garlic, and I used boneless chicken breasts, which were also skinless. And cooked it less, of course. Very satisfying.

I loved this recipe. I often make "Spicy Fried Chicken Cutlets", which are great for breasts butterflied into cutlets, but these taste better and use the whole chicken. I also used panko and sprayed with evoo. Great moist,tasty,crispy chicken. Served cold for picnics or leftovers, the crust holds up far better than anything fried--crispy and no grease!!

Thanks to other reviewers, I used Panko instead of regular bread crumbs. I also eliminated the thyme as mine was way too old to make a difference. It turned out crispy and not too spicy. If people like this recipe, try the parmesam crusted chicken from this site - even better and easier. Mine also turned very brown soon into the cooking cycle. Oiling the racks helped!

Rating: 3
Absolute must: double the breading. I used plain old homemade breadcrumbs and the crunch is great, I don't think Panko is required, but like almost anything, a quality ingredient is important. I thought there was a touch too much thyme in this and will reduce a bit next time. I must not have let enough excess drip off as the smoke alarm started going off about 10 mins into the cooking time. Luckily I had lined my backing sheets with aluminum foil so it was easy to clean up the burnt bits. I also had some issues with the chicken sticking to the racks, perhaps lightly oiling the racks prior to baking will eliminate that.

Rating: 4
Still basking in the post meal glow....the flavours were amazing. Followed the recipe with a few minor changes: used panko instead of bread crumbs and a combination of sirracha and sambal olek instead of American style hot pepper sauce as we did not have the latter on hand. We also used quartered bone-in breasts (one half breast cut into two pieces) which resulted in a much shorter cook time of 35 minutes. This was super easy and had just the right amount of subtle smokey heat. Can't wait to make it again!

Why I didn't jump out of my kitchen table chair after taking the first few bites of this miracle chicken dish to review the recipe is beyond me. These chicken pieces were incredibly delicious, and so much better for you than their fried counterparts. As per the suggestion of other reviewers, rather than breadcrumbs I used panko and crushed cornflakes. Without the proper rack to cover the baking sheets, I cooked them directly on foil-lined baking sheets (which I double-stacked so as not to burn the chicken). I kept the spices as they were, knowing that the chicken would not be too spicy, but instead absorb only the heat it needed to. I allowed the chicken pieces to marinate for about five hours, and after breaded (I also increased the amount of breading), let them rest for about 30 minutes, gently pressing the crumb into the chicken every so often. I flipped them over in the oven after 20 minutes, and they were finished about 15 after that. They turned out with a nice, subtle char and PERFECT crispness. I cannot wait to make this again

I make these all the time for big buffet get togethers. I use skinless boneless breasts and slice them to make a lovely presentation and serve with other "main course" foods. The key is to let them sit for the 45 minutes after breading and to be certain to bake them on the rack so they get crunchy underneath. I generally use panko for the additional crunch and spray with Pam rather than drizzle butter--better control and fewer calories. i also serve with homemade bluecheese dressing/sauce.

This was a hit at our Labor Day party (2010) - lots of people went back for seconds. I backed off just a little from the Tabasco and the cayenne and there was still enough zip for those who like it hot! My friends want the recipe! Thanks, Epicurious!

I loved this chicken served with a spicy dijon mustard potato salad and fresh tomato salad. I used 6 drumsticks and 2 breasts and had lots of breading. I left the chicken in the marinade all day and baked it on parchment. Ignore the cooking time and do what you normally do when you bake chicken.

Rating: 2
This was good...not great, amazing, or delicious. I wish I had actually read the reviews before baking it, because I really should have put it on some foil or parchment paper. The breading just didn't seem quite right to us. I think using some panko would have made it better. We breaded and baked the onions too, which was successful, but we didn't like them due to the breading.

I made this chicken for Sunday dinner, used whole cut-up bone-in chicken. I did double the breading recipe based on reviews. It came out fantastic, nice flavors, nice crunch and beautifully browned and moist. I can't think of anything I would change.

Delicious - I think I like it better than traditional fried chicken. The only changes I made were that I subbed panko breadcrumbs; powdered onion and powdered garlic for fresh: and I had to make a little more of the breading than the recipe called for. Otherwise, perfect!

Made regular amount of marinade for 18 drumsticks and 1.5X the coating. I used Tapatio hot sauce, & granulated garlic & onion. Subbed in panko, no parmesan, and Old Bay Seasoning in place of thyme, paprika, & cayenne. Poured 1/3 of the coating into a bowl and that covered 5 drums. I scooped out the clumps & continued with the remaining legs in the same manner. In the end I had a scant 1/3c. of unused coating. The 30 minute rest allows the coating to adhere and dry. Used my mister to apply a coat of EVOO. With convection I baked for 40 mins. total to internal temp of 180F. After removal from oven I allowed several minutes to rest. The first bite was tender, succulent and very flavorful from the buttermilk marinade, and the nicely browned crust had a definite crunchy exterior. As expected the next day leftovers were no longer crispy but still very good.

Like everyone else, I recommend making 2X the breading mix.

I loved this recipe. I had extra shallots so I used shallots instead of onions, which, when baked, turned out to be yummy little shoestring-like onion crisps. I will definitely make it spicier next time (I used Sriracha). So good!

I thought this was good - my husband thought it was great... I read a lot of the reviews and my opinion is that I would never call this dish bland! I used 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts and cut them into strips - to make adult chicken fingers. I halved the marinade but used only 1TBL of Tabasco worrying it would be too spicy. I let the chicken marinade for about 4 hours. I then had to bread the chicken - halved also the breadcrumb mixture and used panko - per others advice. Unfortunately, I had to make another batch of the breadcrumb mixture -- so do yourself a favor and double the breadcrumb mixture the first time! Also made sure to put the chicken on a grate to rest for 30 minutes before baking at 425 (on the grill). Will make this again - didn't have trouble with soggy -- think the rest on the grate for 30 minutes is the key!

This is one of my family's favorites. Chicken is crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I use leg/thigh combo pieces from Whole Foods and double the breading in order to have enough for all the pieces. Good cold the next day too.

Rating: 2
Undercooked, despite keeping it in the oven for the required time. Oven-cooked just didn't get it thoroughly cooked. Panko might be a better, crunchier texture. Overall, the flavor wasn't that hot. I even tripled the amount of hot pepper sauce suggested.

Rating: 4
Great recipe! We made part of the batch after a day of marinating, and the rest the following day. I added some red chili flakes into the marinade--we like it extra spicy--but even with it, it was not an overpowering kick--just right. For the breading, we used panko (crushed into smaller bits) and Weetbix crumbs, and made more as recommended. Next time, I'll cut the onions thicker to they'll be easier to fish out and cook up with the chicken. For sides, I made up Alton Brown's Southern Biscuits, corn on the cob, and the roasted potato and wilted kale salad.

Rating: 3
Would have given this four forks, if I didn't have to go back and make more breading every time I prepare this. I slice boneless skinless chicken breasts into tenders, and slice the onions in the marinade about 1/4" thickness, and leave them intact in rounds. Then, I bread both the chicken tenders AND the onion rounds, and bake them at 425 degrees on a Pam-sprayed roasting rack, in a roasting pan for 45 minutes. Both chicken and onions come out crispy, juicy and incredibly flavorful. But double the breading if you want this result. ;-)

Rating: 4
Never made fried chicken of any sort in my 48 years. But I'll make this again. Homemade crumbs and plenty of time to marinade essential. I pan cooked the onions & buttermilk (long enough for safety) as a condiment. Now that had some flavor! Only used dark meat, which took less time. Good flavor and reasonable prep time. I used a cast aluminum griddle with grooves in the oven. Worked perfectly.

If you're expecting this to taste just like regular fried chicken... Don't. But it's delicious and I really enjoyed it, and frankly I think it's easier. Better than most other oven fried recipes I've tried. I did add some powdered garlic, ki9cked up the cayenne, and sprayed with Pam butter spray instead of using butter. Crunchy and yummy!

The recipe sounded great, and the marinade smelled delicious, and the reviews were all good...but to me this tasted just like Shake n' Bake chicken once it was done, and it was SO much more work! It tasted fine, it just was not anything special. Next time I'll just make Spicy Shake n' Bake!

Okay, that was embarrassing! I fixed this for a crowd for the Fourth of July and it was AWFUL!! I used almost a whole can of chipotles in adobo in the buttermilk, marinated for 26 hours and it was bland, flavourless, and just plain boring. Healthy, maybe, but not good!!

This is a great recipe! Only had time to marinate for about 3 hours and it was very flavorful, not too spicy. I put a little panko and cornflake meal in with the breadcrumbs, placed the chicken directly on a lightly greased cookie sheet and it was quite crispy. I even threw the onions on from the marinade. They cooked quite a bit faster than the chicken, but were tasty! I paired it with some potato salad, corn on the cob and and heirloom tomato salad. Overall, this will be a great summer staple.

Really loved the marinade for the chicken. I still think that if you are making a "fried chicken" type dish...well, deep fry it. I loved the taste, but still think that if the flavors were a "treat" to have real fried chicken, it would be incredible...but pretty good/great baked. I do recommend it either way...maybe too much "shake and bake" as a kid has influenced my decision...but certainly great flavors.

I really liked this as you don't have to cook the chicken in oil...and the crust comes out crisy, and with a nice bit...I would however forgo the "drizzled butter" next time...it just kind of ran off the coating, and where it did stick it tended to get a bit more dark...overall I would definately make it again!

Instead for using store bought breadcrumbs make your own by grating french bread. It really made the coating good. I will consider using the panko and mixing it with fresh crumbs and see how it turns out. I have made this several times with no complaints.

I made this twice and believe a few key tips made it very good. Used skinless bone-in pieces. I used corn flake crumbs and panko to bread it adding spices to my taste. The first time I breaded it and cooked without letting it sit. I did not use butter instead butter spray and cooked on a rack. Not soggy but the breading fell off more than I wanted it to. The next time I dredged in flour, egg wash and then the breadcrumbs and let them sit for a little more than half an hour. Crunchy and delicious, as close to fried as you can get and you don't miss the skin .

I absolutely LOVE this recipe - one of my favourites!! - perfectly balanced flavour with a nice amount of spice. I have made it many times, and mine usually comes out crunchy on one side, softer on the other.

I used skinless chicken breasts, and this turned out very moist. The spice level was just right. I did use the racks as suggested; I also coated the onions from the marinade in the breading and them on the racks as well. The onions turned out nice and crunchy and made a nice garnish.

Love it!! I made some changes to suit my taste: I used skinless on-the bone pieces and marinated overnight.I used panko and subbed sesame seeds for the parmesan cheese. Most importantly I found it to be totaly not necessary to use a rack. Simply oil a sheet pan, place the chicken directly on the pan, drizzle VERY lightly with olive oil and bake as per recipe. No turning required. The chicken comes out crispy both top and bottom. I rated it 4 forks because I know I will be making this regularly for many years to come and the possibility for flavour variation is endless. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

My husband and I both loved this. We actually ended up marinating it for two days because the night I intended to cook it something came up. It was perfectly seasoned, not too spicy. I used panko in the breading, too, and it was delicious and crispy. Perfect! Fried chicken taste and texture without the hassle.

Rating: 1
I followed the directions on this to a T, and thought it was terrible. I marinated my chicken for 8 hours and it didn't pick up any of the flavors from the marinade. Also, cooking on a rack didn't help with the crispness factor - the breading was crisp in a few places, but mostly soggy in others. I'm not sure why some folks are getting such great results with this recipe, and others aren't, but I'm definitely not a fan of this. I just tried to eat a piece of the leftovers and it hadn't improved overnight. It was soggy on the outside, flavorless on the inside. Never again!

Used boneless, skinless, breast tenders, so only had to bake them for about 20 minutes. I only used 2 tbsp. of hot sauce since there was going to be cayenne in the breading, and it came out with a nice heat that wasn't ovewhelming. They weren't totally crispy, but I skipped the step where they were supposed to sit for 30 minutes, and I misted the chicken with olive oil instead of drizzled butter, so those steps might have been key. Used a red onion for the onion rings, they were great--don't skip them!

We used skinless breasts for this and panko--the overnight marination is key and I've used Frank's hot sauce--the stuff used on buffalo wings for the hot element. Chipotle also works. A fantastic one for parties.

I love this! I've made it a bunch of times to excellent reviews. Usually I only marinate it for the minimum of time, but last time I marinated it for a long time and it came out almost too spicy whereas usually the spice is not strong at all. Just something to consider since everyone has different thresholds (my husband and I loved it spicy but my kids didn't)

I wanted to make crunchy chicken for a picnic, and this looked like a great recipe. After reading all the contradictory reviews, I removed the skin and made it with panko crumbs. Although the panko crumbs did not brown evenly, the chicken came out of the oven very crispy. But the crust got soggy when I served it cold the next day. Mom suggested I keep the skin on next time (to keep the moist meat from getting the coating soggy when served cold ) and to use cornflake crumbs to get an even browning. Next time I will also increase the seasoning in the coating. An ok recipe, after some tweaking.

I have made this a couple of times and everyone loves it. A couple of reviewers suggest baking it over parchment instead of a rack. I tried that the second time and grease had nowhere to go and skin got soggy. Definitely put it on a rack that has been sprayed with vegetable oil over a cookie sheet - skin comes out nice and crispy. Also did as others suggested and made it with panko breadcrumbs - Delicious!

I made this with just a few changes and it turned out wonderfully. Instead of hot sauce, I chopped up a few chipotle peppers in adobo and tossed them in the buttermilk mixture. I also used skinless, boneless chicken breast. Instead of regular breadcrumbs, I used panko breadcrumbs, and I made sure to let the coated chicken sit on the rack for 30 minutes as directed - I think this part is very important. Also, place the chicken wire racks set in cookie sheets - ensures crispness. I baked it only for 40 minutes and the taste was wonderful. Juicy as well!

I made this for a large picnic got thumbs up all around. I thought it was delicious. I actually made this a week ahead of time and baked the chicken for only 25 minutes.

Had a change in plans and after marinating the chicken (skinless thighs on bone and boneless,skinless breasts) for 48 hrs., just threw it on the grill rather than coat it and bake it. The taste is out of this world! As per another reviewer, used onion powder and omitted the olive oil in the marinade. I did try baking a few pieces (used panko crumbs), but ended up with soggy, soggy, soggy chicken! I used parchment paper and no butter, let it sit for 30 minutes before baking it, but was *really* disappointed in the quality. Not crunchy at all -- it's why I ended up just letting the chicken marinate even longer and then grilling it. How does everyone else get it so crunchy? I baked it for ~30 minutes @400F (boneless, skinless breasts). Should I have done it for longer?

Rating: 4
This was a winner-a must for every BBQ or buffet. Make sure to dry and bake the chicken on a rack. This allows it to crisp underneath and not end up soggy. Also, best eaten at room temp when it can have time to crisp as it cools. Do yourself a favor and marinate 24 hours. Unbelievable flavor.

I am finicky about oven fried chicken, but this was an excellent recipe. Besides making my own breadcrumbs out of store bought potato bread, I made some adjustments recommended by other reviewers. I used fat free yogurt instead of the buttermilk and I put chipolte peppers with adobo in the marinade. Excellent!

I rated this because I used all of the suggested spices in the recipe and the cooking method. I did, however, make 3 subsitutions. Instead of buttermilk, I used plain lowfat yogurt mixed with all the spices and marinated for 2 days. Instead of flour I used cracker meal. I also added some salt because the chicken needed it. The only other slight change was using some bacon grease for drizzling instead of butter. The chicken was moist and thoroughly cooked through. Even the breasts were tender and flavorful. The coating was crispy on the top, but soggy and over-brown on the bottom. (I happen to like the crusty brown bits though) This chicken is best eaten the night it's made, or before it's refrigerated as the crust becomes soggy when reheated in the microwave. I followed the rest of the recipe to the letter, including the cooking times.

I made these as chicken fingers with some chicken tenders from the butcher. I also used the full amount of breading, intending to use the leftovers for onion rings, but there wasn't a lot of leftovers! The chicken was delicious. I used parchment paper sprayed with Pam and also sprayed some Pam on the top of the chicken before putting it in the oven. The breading tended to fall off a bit when the tenders were fresh out of the oven but once they had cooled to "eating temperature" I had no more problems. The chicken was tender and just slightly spicy. Delicious!

I never print these recipes out when cooking so try to rely on memory to reproduce. Forgot to add onions and garlic and mustard to marinade but it was still good. Anything soaked in buttermilk overnight turns out good in the end. Cooked on parchment for easy clean-up and used regular bread crumbs. No need for butter it just got everything a bit muddy. Will definitely make again--a good easy recipe without the fried chicken mess.

Parchement paper worked for me! I turned it half way, one piece lost its coating but pretty good otherwize. Like others I used 3part panko 1 part breadcrumbs. Best part was my boyfriend liked it!!Served it with a salad with blue cheeze and the combo was great. For me, could have been spicier but I just dipped it in sriracha after. 50 minutes at 400 degrees was a bit too long, I will try 40 minutes next time. I used drumsticks and skinless boneless chicken breasts. Oh and I used 2 tbls. tabasco one tbls. sriracha. Next time I think more sriracha.

We liked it! The second time I made it I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and reduced the amount of olive oil. The flavor was still great and I would do it again. Use the recommended amount of Tabasco sauce...or two tablespoons of Sriracha(without the seeds). It just flavors and does not overpower. Drain and cook the onions along with the chicken.

This chicken is delicious. I used 1/2 the pepper sauce and 1/2 the cayenne for fear that my clients would think it was too hot. It turned out just slightly spicy. The meat was very juicy. I had the same problem with sticking so I chose not to turn the chicken over. Next time I will spray with pan spray. Very good and will make again.

I made this recipe several times and think I've hit on the perfect way. Although the recipe calls for cooking on a rack, I decided to just put the chicken (boneless breasts, pounded to even thickness) on non-stick foil on cookiesheet. Wow! It was much better! The underside browned real nicely, I turned them over to other side, it browned, and chicken came out very crispy. Didn't lose breading like in the past (and like other reviewers have commented). Marinated for about 5 hours. Heat was just right.

Very tasty. On the advice of previous comments, I omitted melted butter to avoid a smoking oven, and used parchment paper to avoid the crumb coating falling off. Tried a few pieces with the skin taken off before marinating -- much better. The chicken gets a great flavor from the marinade, and is good cold the next day, too.

Good & tender, but thought that it would be spicier. Breaded skin & meat (don't eat skin, but like the crust).Turned chicken over, but shouldn't have because crust fell off. Did half on rack and half on pan. Pan browned better.

This is delicious. We make it frequently. I use Panko breadcrumbs and they are very light and crispy...probably a lot less like shake and bake. Also, we put a rack in the roasting pan and cook them on that, crispy all around!

Rating: 3
I agree with another reviewer--the breading resembles Shake N Bake! It was tasty, but the coating stuck to the pan and came off in pieces when I was turning it. It didn't look very presentable, but it tasted good. What I will probably do next time is use the buttermilk marinade again (keeps the chicken wonderfully moist inside) but use Shake N Bake to save time.

I followed the advice of the other cooks and turned the chicken over half way through the cooking time. Despite the fact I sprayed the pan with vegetable spray, the chicken coating stuck to the pan. The flavor all in all was very good.

This was so simple! It took longer than 50 minutes, and my chicken also turned out soggy on the bottom. Next time I will try turning it over. Also next time I'll try the butter - I forgot it, but the chicken was still delicious.

This was terrific. My partner loves fried chicken and complains because I prefer to bake it. But he loved this dish. I am now spared much grumbling. One comment - next time I will make sure to plan ahead and marinate the chicken overnight. I am sure it wll make it even more flavorful.

Delicious! Nice and crispy! This turned out great regardless of the fact that I had only one hour to marinade and I used homo milk instead of buttermilk.

I really enjoyed this receipe. I did take the recommendation of one of the reviews and turned the chicken half way through the cooking which made it crispie on both sides. The chicken had a great flavor and was very moist. I would defintely make this dish again.

This chicken was really good. So often my oven fried chicken attempts don't turn out cruchy, this one did on the top, my only complaint was that it didn't crunch up on the bottom - ah well, can't have it all! The crust had a great flavor to it too. We loved the spice and I would probably do a little more spice next time.

Yum! Nice kick, but not too spicy. We marinated ours for almost 24 hours and it was full of flavor and very tender. Next time I would turn it over halfway through cooking so both sides got done, though. A keeper!

I've made this several times and it's always a hit with guests. If you like spicy, it's wonderful. As a transplanted Southerner, I take fried chicken seriously, and this one hits the spot, even better b/c it's not deep fried.

Very yummy, flavorful, tender, juicy, and moist - 3.5 forks! Because I don't like extremely spicy foods, I halved the cayenne pepper (which turned out perfect) and used only 1T hot pepper sauce (didn't notice it in the chicken, so maybe I should have used the full 3T). Also, I tried half of the coating with breadcrumbs and half with panko instead (and barely had enough coating for all the chicken). I liked both equally. I also forgot the butter, but didn't miss it. The crust came out slightly too brown, so reduce the time or temp. No smoking problems, BTW. Finally, I didn't want to waste the onions, so I put them on the pan underneath the rack (which probably was the reason the bottom of the chicken didn't crisp up much). Wow, those onions were absolutely packed with flavor! Don't throw them out!

Boy, I liked this chicken, and had made it several times, til I took it to a work party and somebody accused me of using Shake and Bake. Now my husband, who loved it and asked for it again, doesn't get to have it anymore.

Excellent! I made a few changes and the results were amazing: 1. no olive oil -- impedes the buttermilk from sticking to the chicken; 2. no sliced onion -- onion powder instead (the water from the onion dilutes the buttermilk which is supposed to coat the chicken); 3. definitely more hot sauce; 4. no parmesan -- doesn't need it; 5. panko crumbs -- which are lighter and give the chicken a sophisticated texture; and 6. used only chicken breast (with ribs attached and skin on) because that is what I had on hand. My husband and son devoured this! P.S. Follow those helpful tips from reviewers (such as 'do not crowd the chicken' -- this really does ensure crispy skin). Enjoy!

This sounded great and after reading all of the reviews I was sure that I would love it, this was not the case however. Though the meat was superb- very juicy and tasty, I found the breading to be a bit heavy handed. I guess it was just me because my dinner guests raved about it and are still talking about it days later,(I hope they're not just being nice). The worst part is that I had to peel off and not eat the skin! Not like me at all. Since this was my first crack at this recipe I followed it exactly. I will use the marinade again but will re-tool the breading ingredients. Just my preference......

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this recipe. He gave it a 9 out of 10! We eat a lot of chicken, but avoid frying. This tasted sinful, but wasn't oily! I made with buttermilk mashed potatoes to use up the buttermilk I bought - very tasty. Also, I sprayed lightly with butter Pam and got a very crisp coating. Next time I will marinate longer...3 hours worked, but I bet overnight with some more hot sauce makes this chicken even better!

Okay for my picky husband I removed the parmesan from the breading (he can smell "stinky" cheese as he calls it, miles off. I used Panko (japenese breadcrumbs) and accidentally forgot to butter the top before it went in the oven. We loved it, it goes on the permanent rotation of menu choices. V. easy, v. quick. Next time I'll try using the onions as well, sounds like a good idea. Maybe if we all keep adding comments we can keep it on the most popular list and really annoy that reader....

Excellent texture and flavor. The cook that suggested cooking the onions was inspired. Gathered them from the marinade and rolled them around in the leftover breading and arranged them along side the rack on the foil-covered pan. Drizzled with a little butter. Soooo good! I made half the chicken and 3/4 the breading and it was plenty for both chicken and onions. I also sprayed the rack. Otherwise followed the recipe, no problems.

Moist and easy to make...good use for leftover buttermilk too! Didn't notice the "smoking oven" problem others have mentioned, but I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts and cut them into strips. Baked at 350 for 25 minutes...came out great! Just the right amount of spiciness and I used Habenero chile sauce.

This is a great recipe for dinner parties, because you just put the dish in the oven and there's no maintenance whatsoever after that. I really liked the taste.. company really liked it, too. On advice of previous reviewers, I cooked chicken at 400 degrees for 30 minutes. That was perfect.

This was a delicious receipe that I will be making again soon. My family just loved it and my husband ate SIX pieces! I agree with the reviewer from Canada in that I would lower the rack in the oven the next time as the coating was getting too dark before the inside of large chicken breasts (bone in) were fully cooked. I used a "pick of the chick" package with three breasts, three drumstick, and three thighs and there was plenty of coating for all. And the onions were delicious and crisp too.

Thank you for giving me a great chicken recipe. I have a family of four and there were *no* leftovers. The hot sauce I used in the marinade was triple hot, so the children did feel some heat, next time I'll use a more mainstream sauce. My daughter has the one leftover piece in her lunch today. I threw in a few chicken wings as well, and they were delicious. I did find that I only baked the chicken for 35 minutes, and there was a bit of smoke. Next time I might try to lower the racks in the oven. Thanks for a great recipe.

I would definitely make this again. I omitted the onions in the marinade - they didn't seem as though they would add much.

We just got back from a four day music weekend (camping). I brought two "picnic packs" of thighs and legs which I had marinated overnight and baked in the morning. I doubled the recipe, skipped the melted butter and made half with skin and half without. I also lowered the temp down a bit and used a thermometer to check internal heat. I preferred the no skin as did most others but everyone agreed-- they loved this chicken. I kept in on ice the entire weekend and it was delicious every time we had it. My partner isn't one to give compliments freely and he thought this was "awesome." I also made the Blueberry Lemon Poundcake to have with our coffee in the a.m. and it two was yummy, yummy! Music for the ears and music for the mouth.

What a great dish!! I made it the night before and brought it to a picnic the next day - everybody loved it! We had a pasta salad, farm tomotoes and fresh Italian bread - really lovely.

This is one of the best things I've ever made. I didn't have time to marinate it as long as was recommended, but it was still terrific. I didn't have breadcrumbs, so I used the opportunity to use up all the bits of old cereal left in the cupboard: cheerios, corn flakes, special K, corn chex and shredded wheat biscuits went into the blender. I don't think I could duplicate this coating mix but it was fantastic.

Our family absolutely loves this dish. It takes a bit of planning due to the marinating and sitting time, but it's not labour intensive and is well worth the wait. I use only boneless, skinless chicken breasts, skip the drizzled butter and adjust the cooking time down by at least 10 minutes. This chicken is simply fabulous the next day served cold with some dijonaise.

Made this from drumsticks and took to a picnic. I also agree that the oven temperature is too hot, as they were reasonably brown by the time they were cooked. I would cook again.

The oven temperature was too hot and I know my oven is correct. This seemed like a lot of trouble for a chicken that tasted just okay.

This recipe was great. Really good flavorful, tender chicken. I can't handle spicy/hot foods and this recipe had a nice tang to it, but wasn't over the top hot. The reason everyone's ovens are smoking is because of the spattering butter. Are they putting too much on?

I have made this recipe numerous times for my family - much better than other fried chicken recipes both oven and frying pan as the others I find really don't have much flavor. As for the smoking ovens I have never had a problem - could it possible it's not the recipe's fault but a dirty oven?

I gave this four forks because I was so thrilled to discover what buttermilk does for chicken: it tenderizes it and takes out that unpleasant "fowl"ness that sometimes comes through. Also, I thought this was a terrific way to get all the crunch of fried without the hassle. One further note: It is much (MUCH) better served hot/warm than cold.

My husband and I both really liked this chicken. It was flavorful and tender and pretty easy to make.

What is the reason for the onions in the marinade? That seemed to be a useless step (raw). May cook them first next time and then add warm to buttermilk. Also, where is the spice? Will marinate over night and use boneless thighs next time to see if we can up the flavor quotient.

Rating: 1
Have any of you actually FRIED chicken before??? If you do it correctly and have your oil between 375 F and 350 F, your breading will not absorb any of the grease at all. Try it sometime....measure your starting oil, fry a batch of chicken, and measure your post frying oil. If you've maintained a good temp, you'll find the chicken absorbed very little of any oil. Throw this recipe in the trash you "health conscience" chefs. You're going to die of something, so just enjoy dinner, will ya???

Rating: 3
I tried to keep the recipe lower-fat by using boneless skinless breasts, cutting down on the oil and leaving out the parmesan cheese. I also baked it in a pan, turning over the chicken every 15-20 minutes so the breading doesn't stick to the pan and both sides evenly brown. Turned out pretty well but I agree with the other reviewers that this is a step up from shake and bake. Also if you're used to spicy foods you won't think this is spicy, you may want to pour on the tabasco to give it some kick!

We're big fried chicken fans and were truly impressed with the taste and tenderness of this recipe!

This chicken was okay but nothing special considering the amount of prepartion and the awful mess it makes. It was soggy on the bottom even though I cooked it on a rack.

What wonderful flavor! I have made this chicken several times since its publication, my family loves it! I have tried it with and without bones and skin and different pieces of chicken.

Wow! What a great recipe. I am with the cook from Beruit, as to too much smoke and sizzling, but you do need to have the chicken raised so it can crisp on the bottom. Turn on the exhaust fan, layer the pan with foil and prepare yourselves to be dazzled.

Very good taste and I would make it again, but I would bake it at a lower heat and just turn up the heat the last 15-20 minutes or so for browning. My eyes were hurting from all the smoke coming out of the oven due to the spattering grease. I drizzled olive oil rather than butter.

Delicious! I followed suggestions from previous reviewers and prepared the chicken without the skin and substituted olive oil "mistoed" for the melted butter. I used Cholula brand hot sauce, which is milder than tobasco. I doubled the crumb mixture using half bread crumbs and half cornflake crumbs. The chicken came out moist, tender and flavorful on the inside and crispy crunchy on the outside. My family loved it and the leftovers were even more delicious.

A special thank you to the cook from N.Y., N.Y. for taking time to give me advice in making this recipe. I also thank the cook from Toronto for answering my question about panko. I always say, a warm heart goes along with someone who enjoys cooking. I did make this chicken dish, however, I was rather disappointed with the results. Although my family liked it, we all agreed that it tasted only a step above shake and bake. It was, however, very moist and I would bet it would by dynamite fried. Unfortunately, that would defeat the purpose of it being oven fried. Again, thanks to all!

This is for Linda in Flanders, NJ: Based on my experience, I recommend the following: Leave the skin off; it doersn't crisp, as with roast chicke, but stays a little mushy, so why not save the fat and improve the texture? Bone-in chicken is really more flavorful than boneless, and less likely to dry out, so use bone-in. Crystal is just another brand of hot sauce. Tabasco is fine if that's what you have access to. Regular breadcrumbs work fine, so don't worry if cornflake crumbs, panko, etc. aren't in your pantry. Also: try to marinate for at least a few hours, or overnight. Line your baking pan with foil for easy cleanup. Oil your rack so you don't leave the coating stuck to it. Skip the butter and use azn oil spray (olive oil is best) to avoid the smoking problem. Check your chicken so you don't overcook it. Good luck--it's a good recipe!

Panko is a Japanese breadcrumb sold in some specialty food stores. I found some at Cost-Plus (a huge Pier 1 Imports type of place that has a gourmet food section). Lots of chefs love panko, but I've never tried it. Apparently it doesn't get soggy during cooking. And just to confuse you further, I read the method for "Cook's Illustrated" oven fried chicken, and they recommend skinning the chicken-- they claimed the skin turned rubbery after the long time in the oven. However, many here liked the addition of skin on their chicken..... let health reasons or your pocketbook be the contributing factors to your decision!

Well, this was pretty good, and I must admit the chicken was very juicy, compared to my usual overdried baked chicken. I marinated it overnight, following the directions exactly, except I used a "light" buttermilk, because for some reason that's all my supermarket had at the time. I doubled the amount of crumb mix based on the previous reviews and I sprayed the racks with Pam and turned the chicken half way, in order to avoid it being soggy on the bottom. But for some reason, the coating fell off the chicken, so that the one side (skin side) was missing it when it was done. I was disappointed with the presentation, obviously, because of this. The chicken was definitely on the hot side, but not too bad, my son ate it, and he's only 6! Next time, I won't turn the chicken over and see how it comes out, maybe it was the buttermilk! My oven really smoked too, even though I didn't add the butter. I sprayed olive oil Pam instead on the tops of the chicken before I put them in the oven. Also thanks for the tip about covering the cookie sheets with foil, it made it a cinch to clean up!

I've made this recipe several times and it is the best! Yesterday I brined 12 frozen thighs for several hrs. to get them defrosted quicker, skinned them and cut off as much fat as possible put them in tupperware marinater with marinade. Affter 3 hrs. I removed 6 thighs and used corn flake crumbs this time for coating and baked on rack for 40 min. My husband is a breast man and he thought they were white meat! I omited the butter and sprayed with olive oil. Tonight I think I will try the remaining 6 with Panko breading. So far I like the corn flake version best.

Later I decided to experiment -- marinated boneless skinless tenders overnight, dredged in flour/cayenne mixture, sauteed in a little veg. oil, tossed with Franks Buffalo Wing Sauce and baked for 5 min., fried the onions from the marinade, made a blue cheesing dressing, fried some bacon, sliced some jalapenos, put all on a nice fresh from bakery roll -- excellent sandwich!

I would definitely double the coating recipe...I barely had enough and I only made 8 pieces. I omitted the thyme (thyme in fried chicken? Southern grandmothers all over the world are clutching their chests on that one) and doubled the hot sauce (I use "Crystal" because it's nice and tangy. Tabasco adds no flavor, just heat). Baking on the rack was a great idea; mine was crispy on all sides. If you have a convection oven I definitely recommed using it. I misted mine with cooking spray instead of the butter for a nice even browning. And for all you boneless, skinless breast folks out there...what's the point? :)

This recipe is delicious. The chicken did not get dry and it was very easy. I made half the chicken with skins and half without... everyone who ate it thought it was even better without skins...

I make a simplified, reduced fat version of this that is a family favorite. I remove the skin from the chicken pieces, but not the bone. Then I dip them in buttermilk to which I have added the tabasco but nothing else. (I don't bother to marinate for any length of time.) Then I dredge them in cornflake crumbs to which I have added about a teaspoon of cayenne pepper. I have found that the cornflakes have a sweetness that contrasts nicely with the hot spices, and the cornflakes don't dry out like breadcrumbs can. After baking for about 45 minutes, turning several times, it's done.

My family and I give this a "10" for oven-fried chicken and we're not big fried chicken fans. Read ALL the comments in the database to weed out what revisions I would incorporate as I prepared this dish (wanted absolute perfection)and the results were astounding! My revisions: Make double the coating, add 1 tsp dried oregano to the coating and cook the onion before adding. Noticed many were unsure of what type of hot sauce to use...I used "Tapatio" which is a step down in heat from straight Tobasco.(Tapatio can be found in the Mexican food section of most large grocery stores and has the SAME flavor as Tabasco but with a bit less punch and does NOT contain any mexican spices.) The heat was just perfect (used 2 Tbsp). Used half the cayenne that was called for and marinated for 3 hours. Many said their undersides were mushy...I solved this problem by cooking on a oiled "square-meshed" baking rack (the kind you cool cookies atop) that I rested on a large rectangular baking pan...baked on a lower shelf in the oven...It came out crisp on all sides! Omitted the butter but will mist with olive oil next time as I would like a more "fried" rather than "baked" appearance. Scrumptious with the incorporation of the thoughtful revisions from other reviewers. Will make again and again!

Very crispy and delicious. I will definitely make this again.

I was disappointed in this recipe. The chicken was very "wet" under the coating. In fact, as soon as I took a bite the coating "slid" off. The color in the magazine is decieving. It did brown but not nearly as much as in the picture. Also, my oven starting to smoke from the spattering grease. Would not make again!

I haven't tryed this recipe yet, but wanted to respond to the N.Y. reviewer's comments about bone in vs. boneless chicken. I personally always use skinless, boneless chicken breasts when making fried chicken with amazingly juicy/crispy results... You soak in buttermilk overnight (juicy) and dip in flour and spices (twice if you want ultra crispy). Easy. Short cooking time and perfectly juicy/crispy. Geesh yourself.

Rating: 4
I must beg to differ from the Cook from New York City. I've used skinless, boneless chicken breasts many times for this recipe, reduced the cooking time to 30 minutes, drizzled with butter, & the high oven heat has produced crisp, delicious results. No smoking, either. The left-overs (on the rare occasions that there are any) aren't crisp, its true, & this dish is much better when freshly cooked. However, for a healthier version of real fried chicken, this recipe is hard to beat & certainly works for me with skinless, boneless breasts.

Absolutely incredible flavor!! We marinated it a full 24 hours. Make the recipe as written and you won't be disappointed!!My husband said this was the best chicken he ever had. Will definetely make this again.

When I made this my husband said, "hon, I love you and please don't make this again!" The thyme is way overpowering. If you do try this recipe cut the thyme portion in half unless you're using some that you bought in 1988 and just found in the back of your pantry.

I used chicken legs only and baked at 450 for 30 minutes and 350 for 20 minutes. The chicken was crispy and delicious, but the kitchen filled up with smoke...nothing was burned, so I don't know why. Leftovers were good, but the cold chicken was no longer crunchy--but it never really is, so that shouldn't surprise.

Alot of work for Shake&Bake chicken. I followed the recipe very closely, except used boneless skinless chicken breast and served it cold at a picnic. The breading was mushy and overpowering, the flavor was mediocre, and the chicken was dry. Overall, disappointing.

Somwthing was missing with this recipe and we followed the recipe religiously. Perhaps my taste prefers more crunch and spice. All of us thought this was merely so-so.

I made this last night and it was fabulous. This is some of the best chicken I have ever tasted. I followed the Cook's Illustrated recommendation to use Melba toast crumbs instead of breadcrumbs because they said that was the only breading they tested that did not get soggy during oven frying. I didn't drizzle any oil or butter on top. Just sprayed with Crisco. I agree that if you want to drizzle,use clarified butter which you can get in health food stores as ghee.

I had to try this recipe based on all the glorious reviews. It is really tasty chicken. I think it's a lot better cold on the second day, so it's perfect for a picnic. I used both boneless chicken breasts and drumsticks,thighs,wings (with skin). The breasts were a bit dry, but all of the chicken had a "fried" taste with a nice zing from the Tabasco. I did have problems wiht the smoking, even though I didn't use any of the melted butter suggested. I would definitely take the advice of another reviewer next time and line my baking sheets with foil to avoid a lot of mess. For the buttermilk batter, I decreased the oil by half and didn't have any problems. Will definitely make again.

Well -- I made this with boneless chicken tenders as someone suggested, and I have to admit that for all the work -- including going out and buying a rack for these to go on in the oven so the bottoms didn't get soggy -- they were just so-so. The flavor was pretty good, but they just didn't taste 'fried' at all. They really weren't crispy. For the chicken not to get horribly overcooked the coating still pretty much tasted like they were breaded, but they didn't have the browning of chicken you bread and then cook in a skillet. Oh well.

Rating: 3
This was a first...I decided to try one of the "most reviewed" recipes for fun. My husband, who is NOT a chicken lover, couldn't say enough about this dish! He even ate the skin, a REAL first. A couple of substitutions I made was to use panko instead of bread crumbs and I eliminated the melted butter (sprayed the baking sheet with Pam instead). It was delicious and will become a family favorite, I'm sure.

This is the best oven-fried chicken I've tasted, although it's a bit time-comsuming to prepare. I used skinless drumsticks to start, to make a platter for a potluck supper, and Tiger Sauce brand hot sauce. Don't be afraid of the heat-- I'm not a fan of blisteringly hot foods at all-- this comes out just nicely spicy. If you bake the chicken on racks (do spray them!) set on foil-lined baking sheets, this won't make a mess of your oven or your pans and racks. I did turn on the exhaust fan, based on comments about smoky kitchens, and had no trouble. If you are really worried about this and want to be sure your chicken browns beautifully, use clarified butter-- it's the milk solids in melted butter that burn, and I did notice a real difference in the chicken pieces drizzled from the sludge at the bottom of the melted butter. Bon Appetit!

Well I'm sorry to be the one to rain on this parade, but I was not thrilled with this recipe at all. I couldn't wait to try it after all the rave reviews, and I follwed the recipe exactly. Considering the mess it made in my clean oven and the smoke-filled house I ended up with, it would have to have been some pretty excellent chicken for me to go through that again, and it just wasn't. The coating was crisp on top, but the bottom was all mushy and most of it stuck to the racks. The flavor was just so-so. I have a fried chicken recipe that is so much better than this. Yes, it is fried the old-fashioned way, in a pot full of oil, but it is a once in a while splurge and it's worth every calorie.

Rating: 3
Although I wouldn't say this recipe tastes exactly like fried chicken, it's still a delicious and healthier alternative. I really liked the combination of flavors for the coating, even though it faintly reminded me of Shake N Bake. As for the spiciness, I served it to a friend who has a very heat-sensitive palate, and she said it wasn't spicy at all. (I, having an asbestos mouth, couldn't taste any of the pepper, so I will double the cayenne next time.) Many previous reviewers commented about the bottoms turning mushy, so I tried to turn the pieces over halfway through cooking, but some of the coating stuck to the racks, and my bottoms still ended up semi-mushy. Next time I will try spraying the racks with Pam to see if this helps. My oven, too, smoked like crazy during the entire time; I can't believe it was just because of the drizzled butter, but I'll also omit this step the next time to see if it alleviates this problem, as I didn't think the butter added much to the final flavor. All in all, a delicious, easy, and healthy recipe -- and the cold leftovers tasted great at my picnic, too!

GRRRRRRRREAT!!!!But just one tip, cooking times vary depending on pieces, i.e. breasts (bone-in) obviously have a longer cooking time than drumsticks or thighs, so adjust times accordingly. The fact that this dish is baked (tastes deep fried) is a healthy bonus for us!!

Loved this dish - just like the real thing, only healthier. Tried it with the skin and without - both ways excellent!! Very tasty and satisfying plus fairly quick to make.

Well, I HAD to try this after reading the reviews. Made the recipe pretty much as is, but as I did not have buttermilk, used the age-old substitution of 1 teaspoon of lemon juice per cup of milk, also only used 2 Tbls of hot sauce. I also doubled the dry ingredients as suggested, and for fun I tried both boneless, skinless breast meat and regular thigh with skin and bone. I have to say I do think it is an amazing recipe in how tender the chicken is. And, intrestingly enough it was not too hot (I thought I would be calling 911). My husband liked it a lot, my child complained mildly that it was "too much pepper" and I just did not care for the flavor, but no kidding this recipe works. I will adapt it to my taste (most likely omit the thyme and parmesan and substitute cumin and allspice).

I've made it twice and each time everyone loved it. It was even good the next day cold right out of the fridge.

Super yummy. I removed the skin and still loved it. I held back on the tabasco a bit and it was still plenty spicy. We loved it but a child might think it's too hot. The only thing that wasn't perfect was that the bottom of the pieces were a bit soggy. Best hot but still pretty good cold. Enjoy.

Rating: 4
This was absolutely delicious. I used boneless, skinless chicken breast (I hate dealing with bones) and marinated the meat for a full day. I couldn't really taste the spice, so my hot sauce must have been pretty mild. The final product was fork-tender, cripy and crunchy on the outside, delicately herbed and aromatic. This was a real treat, and I plan to make it again.

Holy Smokes! What kind of pepper sauce are you all using? I used two Tbsp. Tabasco plus 1 Tbsp. Thai pepper sauce. This was indeed moist & crunchy, but we're still smoking from tonight's dinner!

This chicken dish is fab. What a delicious twist to an American comfort food! Bravo, Bravo, Bravo. The aromas are sensational while dinner's in the oven.

HAVE MADE THIS RECIPE A FEW TIMES. HAVE ALWAYS OMITTED THE BUTTER. FOUND USING BREASTS A PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY TOOK LONGER TO COOK SO AFTER FIRST TIME HAVE USED ONLY DRUMSTICKS AND THIGHS. INCREASED BREADCRUMBS TO 1-1/2 CUPS. DELICIOUS.

It was just so-so - I expected more flavour and found it too oily. Maybe if I took off the skin and cut down on the olive oil it would work better. I marinated the chicken overnight & found that there was no real "spice" to the chicken so I think next time I might mince a jalepeno or something with a bit more zing in!

Made this for a party this weekend and everyone raved. The buttermilk marinade made the chicken incredibly moist and it wasn't overly spicy. I too doubled the coating mixture - better too much than not enough. One thing - if you have a very sensitive smoke detector you may want to remove the battery while this is baking. Definitely will be making this again.

I made this recipe for a dinner party this weekend. Everyone loved it! I made it the night before the party and served it cold. I used almost all large chicken breasts, so I made a double batch of the marinade and the coating. My bottoms were mushy too, but since I served the dish cold, only I could tell. The only thing that I will do different the next time, is omit the butter drizzled over the chicken pieces. I am not sure that it added that much to the taste. Great dish!

We loved this recipe. Used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, didn't have buttermilk so skipped that ingredient. Preparing dinner at 7 pm didn't allow me the 3 hours to marinate so only marinated for an hour. Didn't have time to let the chicken sit on a rack for 30 minutes. Baked at 375 for 40 minutes on a baking sheet with a bit of olive oil and skipped the melted butter - the oven didn't smoke as mentioned by other cooks. Even with all these revisions (done mostly for convenience sake - not because I thought I could improve the recipe) the chicken was delicious - crispy, crunchy coating on the outside and tender moist wonderfully spiced chicken on the inside. We'll definitely be eating this again!

Like another reviewer I also used cornflake crumbs in my coating as I did not have enough bread crumbs. I found the chicken to be moist and flavourful on the inside and crispy on the outside. This chicken is also great to take on an outing because it tastes just as good eaten cold. What a great recipe!

I'd read the reviews and decided to just follow the recipe as closely as possible. The only license I took was to cook the onions (in little mounds) like another had done -- thanks for that! As the oven smoked, I wondered why I was cooking chicken at 425 degrees. After about 40 to 45 minutes, golden brown would be a kind description. Finally -- the taste taste. Delicious. I've never eaten the skin before -- now I know why the heat was 425! Can't wait to taste the cold leftovers!

Hey, it's tasty! Used skinless chicken parts - very good. Some of the coating peeled off from underside of the chicken, but maybe I should oil the rack next time so it doesn't stick?

This chicken is addictive. Wonderful flavor. Not too spicy. My oven also smoked and next time I won't drizzle on the melted butter. Will it make a difference? Has anyone else omitted the butter? Also, although I put the chicken on a rack when I baked it the bottom sides were mushy not crisp like the tops. Any ideas? Anyway, this is a great recipe despite these minor glitches. Delicious.

A Cook From Port Lambton, Ontario...07/08/00 This was an excellent recipe with the right amount of spice. I will be making it definitely over and over. My husband and son raved about it. The only thing I left out was the onion, and I used skinless chicken breasts. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and cauliflower casserole. Yummy!

This was the featured dish of a romantic evening picnic -- a GREAT success! It traveled very well, spending a couple of hours in a cooler (each piece was individually wrapped in wax paper and then I stored them in an airtight container). My husband also says that it's the best "fried" chicken he's ever had. Glad to hear it works with skinless chicken. I also had problems with the mushy coating on the bottom of each chicken piece -- maybe turning the pieces or coating only one side would solve that problem.

Truly great dish! I also had to make more of the breadcrumb mixture. We don't like very spicey things, but I took a chance and used all the hot sauce and it turned out delicious- even for our tender palates. Can't wait to eat the leftovers tonight.

I've been making oven fried chicken for years and this was the best I've made. It definately had a little kick to it! I make my own bread crumb mixture so I used it - there's always some in my cupboard and I think it really added to this recipe (my secret ingredients include bread crumbs, flour, kellogs corn flake crumbs, sesame seeds and some graham cracker crumbs). I also added the parmesan as called for. We only use skinless chicken for health reasons and I found that the buttermilk mixture really coated & helped the crumbs "stick" to the drumsticks I used much better than my usual recipe. I promise you won't miss the skin on this recipe and it's a million times healthier! Also instead of the butter I sprayed on some olive oil with one of those handy dandy oil sprayers. It had the same effect but I used a fraction of the fat. Finally, I cut up some baby potatoes, mixed them with the left over marinade and the onions, put in a little chicken broth and sauteed them - excellent but really spicy & hot!!! A great dinner!

Help! I was sooo excited to try this recipe after reading such glowing responses. It turned out fine, but the bottoms of the pieces were kinda mushy. I cooked them for about 40 minutes, as the oven started to smoke. The tops were crispy though..what did I do wrong? Too much coating? I used a wire rack in a jelly roll pan. Please let me know how I can improve this good recipe!! Thanks!

This is a very good,easy recipe. Cooking the chicken on racks insures a crispy crust top and bottom. It was spiced just right for our taste. I forgot to put the butter on top before I put it in the oven. If I hadn't forgotten I would probably have given it 4 forks.

Forgot the olive oil. Forgot the onion. Did let it soak with all the spice for a good 5 hours. Did let it stand for 30 minutes. At 425, the oven seemed to let out a LOT of smoke as the butter cooked, even set off the smoke detector! We felt like we had our own Fourth of July festivities IN the house with the smoke and sirens! What a night! We can't wait to do it again!

This dish is easy and delicious. I was pleasantly surprised that the breadcrumb coating roasted just like traditional fried chicken. I was pressed for time and only marinated the chicken for one hour. I also skipped the "let stand for 30 minutes" step. Despite these short cuts, the dish turned out beautifully. My picky husband enjoyed it too. This is a great recipe that I highly recommend.

This was the best "fried" chicken I've had. It was so crispy and juicy. I can't believe it came from the oven. I only let it marinate for the minimum time of three hours, but we were still really impressed with the spicy flavor. Next time I'll marinate it over night to get more of the onion flavor and even more of the heat! My husband and I were very impressed with this one. A real keeper!

This is delicious. The crew I had over for dinner loved it as well. I ended up having to triple the coating, so make extra. I didn't think it called for enough. Also, I didn't let it sit on wire racks for 30 min. Didn't have the time and it came out just fine. Take the recipes advice about the hot sauce and don't be afraid to use it all. Looking forward to this on the beach this weekend.

Thought this chicken was delicious. I didn't add as much hot sauce or cayenne as the recipe called for as my mother-in-law was over for dinner (on second thought, maybe I should have put in double the amount - just kidding!) and the chicken was still very yummy. Next time I might try it without the skin, although the skin was good.
