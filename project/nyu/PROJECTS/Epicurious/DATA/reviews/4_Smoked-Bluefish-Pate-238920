I make this every year for a Christmas Eve party. I add capers, lemon zest, and fresh ground pepper and leave out the chives. I let it sit overnight and add chopped parsley just before serving - delicious. Any leftovers are great on bagels, but there are almost never any leftovers.

Easy and delicious, at least to a smoked fish lover (my guests didn't seem to like it as much as I did, alas). I used smoked mackerel, which is closer to bluefish than trout is. I also used reduced-fat cream cheese in a tub, which is a little less dense than the cheese in blocks. I'm making it again for Thanksgiving.

I made this as an appetizer for Christmas dinner. It was loved by all 24 people! Now that's a testament.

I agree with the review below that this recipe does need something to thin it out. I subbed in a very soft goat cheese for cream cheese and added more chives than it said. I did have to use trout in place of the bluefish, which I suspect is less ideal. There seemed to be something lacking in the middle of the palate. I added some roasted garlic and a good bit of chili sauce, which I thought improved it considerably but kalamata olives might go with it as well. Still, a good base to play with, and I plan to work on the recipe until I can get it just right.

We love this recipe. A yearly tradition during our vacation in Chatham Mass.. Great with a glass of chilled Sauv. Blanc after a day at the beach.

Made this for guests this weekend and this is a very good recipe. I used smoked trout which was expensive and difficult to find. No smoke bluefish anywhere. I added sour cream after I was done mixing everything together because the pate was really thick and that worked just fine. I would add more chives next time. I did not add the salt and thought 1/2 teaspoon of pepper would be too much but it was not.

This is fantastic - quick, easy and delicious. I substituted neufchatel cheese for the cream cheese because that what tends to be in the house and i added about 2 tablespoons of chopped capers. I would definitely skip the salt called for as the trout tends to be very salty on its own plus, you'll get additional saltiness from the crackers. This will be in the regular rotation!

This is an elegant and delicious appetizer. Don't tell your guests that it only took 5 minutes to make. ;)

Made this for a Happy Hour adding 1 T chopped capers as suggested in an earlier review and used 1/2 lb smoked Whitefish. I served it with Crispy Rosemary flatbread also on this website and every guest wanted both recipes!

I had smoked trout pate on Nantucket a few weeks ago and loved it. I was desperate to try to recreate it at home and this recipe is very close. I didn't have any shallots on hand, so I substituted red onion and it tasted great. The smoked trout is VERY salty, and I would forego the additional salt next time. Easy and delicious.

My new go to appetizer. Can easily serve with crostini, crackers, toast, or even a plain baguette. Great smokiness and wonderful balance between the fish and cream cheese. Set this out while I was grilling the steaks and when I came back inside our guests had devoured it. Delicious and light and a subtle way to try smoked trout. Make sure to get those little bones out of the way though and to give the trout a legit mince.

This pate has been a hit everytime I've made it.

Awesome. Wildy and simply, awesome! I could eat my body weight in this stuff. It is just the best. I like a Reisling with this, and even a good cab will transcend you to Nantucket if that is where your Nirvana is located, but this transports me to joyful places like Santa Barbara, or a big birch tree lined lake in Minnesota, or just a table under the immense desert skies of Arizona with friends and heartfelt laughs. This is so good!

I used smoked trout and this was delicious. Served with crackers/toasts, a lovely piece of boucheron, bing cherries, sliced granny smith apples, and olives, it was a wonderful early summer spread.

I made this recipe using Chicago Cook's suggestions and it was a great hit - perfect for a hot summer night. So glad I used whitefish, lemon zest and dill. End result was lighter than original recipe with greater depth of flavor due to lemon and dill. Thanks Chicago!

I used smoked whitefish from Lake Michigan and added lemon zest and dill. It came out perfect. TIP: With smoked fish you don't need to add much salt. you can always add more.
