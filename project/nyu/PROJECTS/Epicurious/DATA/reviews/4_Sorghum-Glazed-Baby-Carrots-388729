Quick and yummy. Subbed bourbonbarrelfoods bourbon vanilla sorghum (which I had) for the plain sorghum (which I didn't have) - what a treat!!

Made this for a dinner party last night and not a single carrot was left.

This was an easy & delicious dish. I used molasses & honey in place of the sorghum syrup. I also used grated fresh ginger instead of rounds, and I used a slightly smaller piece of ginger. I served this as a side with the braised brisket with peach-bourbon glaze. Would definitely make it again.
