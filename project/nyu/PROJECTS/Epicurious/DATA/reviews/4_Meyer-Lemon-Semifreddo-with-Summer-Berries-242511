Really fantastic. The kind of dessert guests tell you about the following week. I made warm strawberry sauce, adding a few fresh strawberries and topped each serving off with authentic balsamico (not the vinegar).

Delicious, easy and beautiful dessert! I followed the recipe as written, except I tossed the berries with a little sugar and good balsamic vinegar. The result was heaven. All my dinner guests loved it! Highly recommend.

I loved this dessert! It was easy to put together and I think everyone who tried it thought they were in heaven. I made it because I had just made hundred of merengues for a wedding and was at a loss for what to do with the egg yolks, especially since I was leaving for a week soon. The fact that this recipe used yolks AND went in the freezer (and so would keep while I was gone) was awesome! http://sweetspatulas.com/2012/09/03/lemon-semifreddo/

This was great! Soooo lemony - made with a summer berry coulis - just perfect topping. Didn't have enough almonds on hand, used some crushed hazelnuts as well. Takes a few minutes longer to make the custard than the recipe says but this is one that is a def keeper -

Your guests will love it! I use regular lemons and no zest. I freeze it in individual cups with the almonds on the bottom. Yes, it takes 8 to 10 minutes to bring to correct temp. I use 2 cups of heavy cream and an extra egg yolk. It makes 10 to 11 servings. I always save a couple in the freezer to enjoy the next day. I have made it many times and every one is impressed. Also, add a little whipped cream on top and a mint leaf. This is my husband's favorite dessert.

Seriously, what is not to like about this luscious dessert? The smooth and silky mouth-feel is downright X-rated. I used Meyer lemons right off the tree and the semi-freddo was tangy but not too tart. I did skip the almonds though as I thought they could interfere with the subtleness of the dish. Highly recommend a simple butter cookie or, better yet, freeze the freddo in saran-lined cupcake tins and invert onto tulip tuiles and drizzle raspberry coulis. Divine any way you serve it but be sure to let it sit for just a few minutes out of the freezer before serving to better appreciate the texture.

I've made this recipe many times and will make it many times more....but I will cut back on the sugar the next time. It's a great recipe and different. It will last more than 2 days in the freezer. I made it over two weeks ago, and the left overs are still good.

Absolutely awesome. Since most very good recipes get 4 forks, I'd give this 5. It's fun and relatively easy to prepare, makes a beautiful presentation and it's delicious.

Oh, yum. I made this for New Years Eve dinner. It was delicious, very well received. It's so lemony! It's the first time I made a lemon custard in a metal bowl over boiling water, but it was easy. I will make this again. And again. I really liked the toasted almonds.

I have now made this for the second time and have to say that it is the ultimate in cold and creamy lemony-ness. I also have to say, though, that I stood over the pan of simmering water for way too long (seemed like 20 minutes, vs. four minutes called for in the recipe), watching for the temperature to rise, beating, beating, beating.....and finally gave up when it seemed that it could not get any silkier, though it never made it over about 155 rather than 170 degrees. I'm sure it will be fine. I wish that this detail could be elaborated on or cleaned up in the recipe, however. The first time I made it, same thing. I increased quantities x 1.5 and used two small loaf pans instead of the one called for in recipe. Final product fit the two small pans perfectly. I am making this two days ahead of a dinner party to which I am bringing the dessert. I need to feed 10-12 people, and I know no one will want to be shortchanged on their piece!

How did I miss noticing this gem for so long? Among semifreddo recipes, this surpasses the pistachio semifreddo on this site. It now rivals the lemon buttermilk sorbet on this site as our favorite lemon dessert. Agree with others who noted the great texture and flavor.

I made this again last yesterday for our 4th of July barbecue. It's really, really good, and was completely devoured the first time I made it. I can't believe that the recipe says that it takes around 4 minutes to cook to 170 degrees though. I wasn't watching the clock, but it was at least 15, maybe even 20 minutes, and I got it to 160, cooked for a few minutes more and then quit. I'm not even sure it got all the way to 170 degrees, but the consistency seemed fine so I didn't worry about it. That's the only flaw in the recipe though, it would be nice if the timing listed was more realistic, but it was still totally worth the time and effort! Has anyone gotten the temp up high enough in 4 minutes? What am I doing wrong?!?!

Lemon Semifreddo is the best dessert I have ever made, and was a big hit at two dinner parties. It is tart and creamy and intensely lemony. I used regular lemons and served it with blueberries and a blueberry sauce. It was a bit soft the first time I made it. The second time I cooked the custard a little longer, and it was perfect.

I thought this was great. I do love lemon, so that was not a problem. Even Whole Foods did not have Meyer lemons nor did another gourmet market so had to use regular lemons. The amount of lemon was not my issue, but I thought it just a bit too sweet for my taste. Next time I will use only 1 cup. Made them in ramekins and served them on square plates with the fruit alongside. A beautiful tasty part of a wonderful dinner party.

Rating: 3
This was quite good. I used regular lemons because I'm tired of putting Meyer lemon in everything. If you do that, I would REDUCE the amount of juice. The balance of sweet and tart was off (since meyers are so much less sour than regular lemons. I'm surprised the recipe doesn't account for this). Also, the texture was not a classic semifreddo texture: it was much, much creamier with fewer ice crystals. It was delicious nonetheless but didn't really have that semifreddo dryness. This may have to do with my own technique; perhaps I didn't aerate the egg yolks sufficiently.

Rating: 4
This was so good it made my eyes roll back in my head!!! :) It needs the full 8+ hours to freeze; but it is soooo easy to make. I plan on trying to make it in other flavors like chocolate, raspberry, coffee, Chai spiced honey, anything that will set in that heavenly texture.

I made this dessert last weekend for an outdoor dinner party and WOW! Everyone loved it. The only change I would make is a different nut than almond but thats really just a personal taste preference. I will defiantly make it again!

I made this for Easter and everyone loved it. My instant read was not working so I whisked it for 1 minute longer than recommended and it worked out beautifully. Instead of almonds, I lined the bottow of the dish with frozen raspberries, the colour contrast was lovely, and the taste even better. I look forward to trying other flavours.

Rating: 4
This is a fine, fine, fine, fine dessert. It's sweet and fresh-tasting. The berries are a perfect complement to the lemony custard. We ate it as dessert after Easter dinner. So that my children could eat it, I left out the nuts and served the semifreddo and berries with butter cookies. Absolutely spectacular and delicious and very easy. It took less than half an hour to make it, and it can be made ahead of time.

Great, great dessert! My husband is a lemon freak. He begs for this in the summer. Easy to make, easy to serve and one can use any combination of in-season fruits if berries are not available (I cooked sliced peaches in a little butter and lemon juice, then cooled and served with the semi-freddo. Killer!)

I made this dessert for a summer potluck. The recipe was a LOT of work, but everyone absolutely loved it. I skipped the almonds (didn't have any) and used figs instead of berries, although the lemon flavor overpowered the figs. Overall, incredibly light, refreshing summer dessert.

This was so yummy amazing. I added some extra lemon zest, because usually lemon recipes are too mildly flavored for me - but this was so lemony that the extra zest ended up being unnecessary. It was great - rave reviews. Paired with the Chocolate-Peanut Butter terrine on this site and the combination was delectable.

If you like lemon...this is a wonderful, refreshing dessert!!! It is definately worth the time and energy, you will not regret choosing this recipe. I had my sister and a friend over for lunch. My menu was as follows: Zucchini, Bacon, and Gruyère Quiche, Spinach Salad with Grilled Red Onion and Tahini Vinaigrette and for dessert Meyer Lemon Semifreddo with Summer Berries. The girls said they loved everything, they thought the combination was filling, but not heavy and they had seconds of the dessert. Try this recipe and the others you'll really enjoy them.

I've made this for our annual 4th of July barbecue two years in a row, and it's the PERFECT summer dessert! Absolutely yummy, and looks beautiful too. It took me a LOT longer to get the custard to 170, probably closer to 15 or 20 minutes, and I couldn't stir it the entire time or I'd STILL be at my stove waiting for the custard to set up! Well worth the effort, however. I used regular lemons (from Trader Joes), so it was quite lemony, but as far as I'm concerned there is no such thing as too lemony, so it wasn't a problem, and the tartness is nicely set off by the sweet berries.

Easy, excellent recipe. I cooked the custard in a double boiler; it took about 10 minutes to thicken up as described. Also, the custard did not double in volume when I beat it with my electric mixer for a good ten minutes. Delicious nonetheless! I'm going to try adding a bit of lemonade concentrate next time in an attempt to get very intense, tart lemon flavor.

The best part of this recipe is the balance of creamy frozen custard, textured berries, and the fabulous toasted walnuts. My guests loved it. It's extremely rich and very easy. Definitely sugar the berries in advance and refrigerate to produce a rich syrup & gloss. The only problem I had was that it took me forever to reach the custard stage (about 10 minutes), and I never managed to get the temperature over 160. I think I may not have had enough water in the pot under the metal bowl. Makes me want to splurge on a double-boiler.

Made this replacing lime juice and zest for the lemons. Great summer time dessert for a crowd.

Rating: 4
This was delicious, and definitely a hit among my guests. Everyone went back for seconds! However, I have two words of advice. I couldn't find Meyer lemons and therefore used regular lemons, but I cut back on the juice to a little more than 1/3 cup and the peel to 1 tablespoon. This allowed for a lemony taste without it being overpowering, so even those who don't really like lemons still enjoyed it. Secondly, it melts very quickly so if the guests don't devour it right away, I wouldn't suggest leaving it out very long.

Delicious! One helpful hint though...the custard DEFINITELY takes longer than 4 minutes to achieve the desired temperature & consistency...more like 10 minutes (at least). All in all, though, a super, do-ahead dessert

I loved this recipe. It was simple to make, refreshing in these summer months, and delicious. It does take a long time to solidify, so be patient you'll be pleased with the results. The moose will come out tasting lemony, so keep that in mind. Personally love lemons, and so I added a little extra juice, not too much, but excellent with the sweet fruit. This is a recipe I plan to make again.

Wow! this was sooooo good and creamy. I only used Blueberrys and regular lemons but they really complemented the lemony flavor. I am going to try Lemon Curd next time, I think that I would want it to be a little more lemony. Definitely will be a regular summer dessert in our home.

Meyer lemons from my neighbor's tree, and the BEST raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries. Don't mess with perfection, just make sure to use good ingredients.

I also used regular lemons, but maybe half the lemon zest. The berries I had (strawberries and blackberries) were amazing by themselves, so I skipped the sugar. Absoluely amazing. Would probably be a bit too lemony if you used real lemons and all the lemon zest. Can't wait to find some Meyer Lemons so I can try that!

Outstanding and so easy. I made them in individual brulee pots and put the toasted almonds on the bottom. Did a dinner party for twelve..cut back on the lemon juice...not a taste left.

Stunning consistency but overpoweringly lemony when done with plain lemons. I would dial down the lemon juice to 1/3 cup and just add 1Tbsp of lemon zest. For a more dramatic presentation I would suggest swirling a contrasting puree of strawberry/blueberry or blackberry/raspberry after pouring into the loaf pan and gently stir with a few spins of a spoon or wooden skewer. Toasted almond slivers were over the top delicious. My guests were wowed with the berry- laced presentation.

I am addicted to anything with Meyer Lemons! I loved this dessert and thought it was perfect. I used meyer lemons and perhaps that is what makes the difference. Prebottled or juice from concentrate never perform like the real thing. So try again with the lemons. I made it in ramekins for a more professional presentation. All my guests gave it 4 forks.

I agree that this was way too lemony, but that it had an excellent creamy texture--much better than the typical semifreddo. In fact, I plan on using it as a substitute for homemade ice cream in the future since I have no ice cream maker. But I didn't find it too tart--I found it too sweet (and at the same time too strongly lemon flavored).

Rating: 4
While I enjoyed this dish, I would caution anyone making it against using too much lemon. I used the suggested amount of lemon peel and juice, but mine came out very tart. I suspect this might have been a result of using 100% natural lemon juice (rather than juice from concentrate), but I'm not sure.

We loved this. My husband was concerned he wouldn't like the texture, but after the first bite his concerns went out the window. It's like an ice cream texture...very smooth and creamy. I served this for european guests who aren't big dessert/sweet eaters, and they ate every bite and asked for more! Pretty too!
