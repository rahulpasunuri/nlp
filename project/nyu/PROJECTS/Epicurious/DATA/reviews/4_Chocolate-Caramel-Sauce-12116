I make the Chocolate Caramel Sauce from the Gourmet cookbook, which appears to be the same recipe except it calls for 6 ounces of chocolate instead of 3. It's simply scrumptious. Making caramel in a dry pan can be harrowing but it turns out beautifully.

Tastes like a Rolo. Really sweet, but good. Make sure you stir AS you ADD the cream because I didn't and the caramel siezed up on me...though I was able to melt it by patient;y stirring. Served over butter pecan ice cream and with bourbon and candied pecans.

Very luscious! I'd never made a caramel in a dry pan before so I was unsure what to expect. As the other reviewer said, it did take quite a while for the hardened caramel to dissolve into the cream. Simple and elegant with vanilla ice cream.

This is wonderful chocolate sauce; it makes a great gift. It takes some time to melt the caramel in the cream, but it's well worth a bit of patience!
