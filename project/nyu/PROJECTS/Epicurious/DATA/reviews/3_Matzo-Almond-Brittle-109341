I tried this recipe and had no problem with it. I used 1/4c water with 2c sugar I broke up a few sheets of matzo to make matza farfel. Used chopped walnuts because I did not enough almonds.You must be patient cooking the sugar and toward the end instead of stiring the pan was shaken and the sugar carmelized.

Found this recipe again and made it yesterday for seder. I toasted the almonds too much and didn't use as much sugar as instructed. Started to apologize for slightly smoky flavor and realized everyone loved them anyway. Made another batch today without mistakes. You've got to watch the carmelizing sugar since it sits and sits and suddenly turns the dark caramel color required. Giving them in batches as holiday gifts (Jews and Christians).

I also had trouble with this recipe the first time I did it. I was using a non-stick pan. I have no idea if that was the problem, but the 2nd time I used more water and a regular pan and it came out beautifully. It was a big hit, and I would definitely add it to my regular Passover repertoire.

THIS WAS ONE OF THE ABSOLUTE WORST RECIPES I HAVE EVER TRIED, AND I AM A GOURMET COOK. There is absolutely NO way that the appropriate ingredients were honestly posted in the recipe. After trying for the 3rd time (because the sugar/water mixture continued to seize up I created my own recipe1 WHAT AN ABSOLUTE WASTE OF TIME, ENERGY, INGREDIENTS, AND MONEY!!!

I also had problems making the water based caramel. what i made was white and frothy and didn't really bind so well (i had a few clumps) but the mix was delicious SO i decided to fix it - I made a sugar only caramel (no water) which is a little thicker, added the butter and then mixed in the farfel etc mix - it sets quickly so i was quick about pressing it down - i needed a much larger cookie tray - it makes a huge quantity and i had already snacked on a good portion of my bum first attempt. was successful and will make again.

My mother used to make this candy, and I have been making it for many, many years. I also use honey instead of sugar. After it has been spread on the pan and still hot, we generously sprinkle ginger over the surface. I then cut it in diamond shapes. It's called "Ingberlach" which is Yiddish for little ginger candies. It's drop dead delish!!

This was delicious! What a great Passover candy, I will definitely make it again. As other reviewers have mentioned, just be careful with the caramel.

After making this for a seder last year, I received multiple requests to make it again this Passover. I've made at least eight batches now. I recommend using 1/3 cup water and watching the pot closely once it starts turning golden. It takes a while for the mixture to turn color, but once it does, it can burn quickly, so watch out! After putting the mixture on the Silpat mat, use a metal spoon to spread and flatten as the wooden spoon becomes too sticky. This brittle is addictive and a crowd-pleaser.

I made this recipe last evening and it was a huge hit! It was finished off, and will need to make additional for my second evening! My only addition would be a 1/2 tsp. of vanilla. Keep a close eye on your sugar and water (yes I did add the additional 1/4 C. water recommended). Once sugar melts it does not take all that long before it changes to amber. Enjoy!

Recipe does not work. Never carmelized. Tried twice and sugar seized. Added additional water and still did not work. However, farfel, almonds, and sugar made a great snack.

I loved it ! but I used matzo instead of farfel and I used Brazil nuts instead of almonds. also, following what was recommended by other cooks, I put some more water. It turned out terrific.

I had no problem with this recipe, although I did take one reviewers advice and added an extra 1/4 cup of water, and I did not have Matzo farfel, so I cut up Matzo crackers and used those instead. The recipe turned out results similar to the picture.

I loved this recipe! Although I agree with the other cooks - something was off. I actually stirred the sugar b/c it was turning into a clump and it seemed to work just fine. Tasted great but looked NOTHING like the photo in the magazine.

I think that the recipe is wrong. 1/4 cup of water isn't enough for 2 cups of sugar. I added more water (1/2 cup) to get the sugar to dissolve, and it worked out fine. I cooked it to 295 degrees on my candy thermometer.

This was awful. I tried it twice and twice the sugar seized and became a mass of "cement." I threw out the first batch and managed to save the second by putting the entire disaster in a large fry pan, added enough water to create a syrup and boiled it up until it thickened. Don't bother with this. It's a waste of time, effort, money, almonds and sugar.
