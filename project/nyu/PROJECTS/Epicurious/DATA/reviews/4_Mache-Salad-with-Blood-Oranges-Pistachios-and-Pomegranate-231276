Exceptional dressing! I live in NYC so I was able to find pistachio oil without much searching. Roland brand makes it and I purchased it in a middle eastern slanted gourmet store. I decreased the oil a bit, though I tend to like a more acidic flavor, and I am sure it will be fine with the full dose of oil. As well I used Romaine lettuce instead of mache (wanted organic) and I added some feta cheese to round out the salad a bit more. OK, I guess I, like most posters here, made a number of revisions. But the skeleton of this recipe is magnificent.

I couldn't find pistachio oil in my local (Bay Area) Whole Foods. I'll try ordering it online. Warning: pistachios burn very easily. I had a few sacrificial nuts. Pretty good with good quality olive oil but missing some zing. I may try again with more vinegar and/or a different vinegar (blood orange vinegar!).

This was a smash hit. The pistachio oil is key--for those of you who write you can't find pistachio oil below is where you can find it. If you don't live in LA , I found the pistachio oil online at www.sbpistachios.com. Otherwise you can buy it directly at the Santa Monica outdoor farmer's market(Wedn and Sat. mornings)at the Santa Barbara Pistachio Company's stand. They recommended the toasted pistachio oil as being more flavorful . I agree.

I could get the blood oranges and owned the vinegar, shallot and honey. But no pistachio oil, natural pistachios or mache to be found. So I used a spring mix, walnuts and walnut oil. It was still quite a hit. I would definitely make it again - preferably without substitutes.

Not only was the salad beautiful, it tasted super good. I couldn't find pistachio oil ANYWHERE so I substituted Walnut oil. Blood Oranges can run kind of expensive, so beware this salad isn't for the budget friendly.

This salad was amazing! The flavors go so well together and it was really easy to make. Will definitely be making this again.

This was an absolutely delicious (and light) addition to a potluck Thanksgiving meal. I had to use navel oranges in place of blood oranges and toasted walnut oil rather than pistachio oil because of the expense, but the dressing still had a wonderful flavor balance. I'll be making this throughout pomegranate season.

I didn't have rice vinegar (substituted red wine vinegar) nor pistachio oil (substituted olive oil) and this recipe was still very good. Loved it.

Very refreshing winter salad; I substitued grape seed oil for pistachio oil and it was very good. Would be a wonderful salad with fish.

Very successful, very refreshing. I changed too many things for Americans to call it the same recipe; mesclun instead of mache, orange and grapefruit instead of blood oranges and olive oil instead of pistachio oil. But it guess the point is the refreshing combination of orange, pistachio and pom in a salad and it worked.

This was the first time I bought a pomegranate for any recipe. The presentation was very nice while being very tasty as well. I love pistachios!

Delicious! Very tasty and unusual. It was fun introducing my family to blood oranges.

The dressing was great, and the pomegranate was a nice touch - something I hadn't tried before.
