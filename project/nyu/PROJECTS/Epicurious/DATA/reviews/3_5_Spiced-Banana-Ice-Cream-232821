this was fantastic! way better than any bought ice cream. I made half for 4 people and the yield was less than I expected. although much more wouldn't have fitted in my ice cream maker.

This was a very good, tasty Banana ice cream, but not the best I've ever had. I only made a pint, so halved all the ingredients, except the banana itself.

I used this recipe as a guide for simple banana ice cream and it worked quite well; I omitted all the spices save the vanilla bean. In doing so, I doubled the amount of banana I used to up the flavor saturation, which worked great.

My whole family loved it! I also add a couple of cloves and I strained it before adding the bananas.

As my boyfriend put it, this ice cream tastes just like banana bread. I omitted the anise and cardamom, and substituted ground cinnamon (1 teaspoon) and vanilla extract (1 tablespoon) for the stick and bean, and used black pepper instead of white. The ice cream straight out of the freezer was a bit flaky in texture, but letting it sit in the fridge produced an incredibly creamy texture.

I've made this a couple of times. The kids loved it. We put it in one of those hollow cakes that uses the Betty Crocker cake pan for baseballs and other round or hollow cakes.

Spices overwhelmed any hint of banana

berrypicker: because of the texture. When it comes out of the ice cream maker it's still a little soft and not so dense.Freezing it hard gives the texture most of us are used to, and thawing in the fridge to spoonability ensures that it softens evenly, instead of being liquid around the edges and rock hard in the middle. Of course, a microwave on the appropriate low setting does a pretty good job too.

This sounds delicious and like something that I should not indulge in. I have a question: why would you take this ice cream out of the freezer and let it melt in the frig and on the counter? Just curious.
