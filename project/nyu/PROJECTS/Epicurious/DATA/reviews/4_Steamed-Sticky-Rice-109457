I use bamboo leaves. They give the rice a little more flavor.

I have made this a couple of times and it turns out perfect. It's super straight forward-just follow the directions. I love to roll it into little balls and dip it in thai dipping sauces. This recipe makes a lot-1/2 the recipe is enough for 4 servings.

EXCELLENT DIRECTIONS!!! I've had Thai friends for many years, and this is EXACTLY how they do their "sticky rice!" This is truly "authentic" for us Americans. BRAVO for getting it right!
