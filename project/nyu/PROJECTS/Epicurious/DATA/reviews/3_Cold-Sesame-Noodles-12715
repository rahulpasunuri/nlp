Delish! Biggest tweak: We made this with spaghetti squash instead of pasta. Believe it or not, it was pretty darn good! For the recipe, we doubled everything. But we used NO water whatsoever! Added an additional tablespoon of peanut butter. The sesame oil was the spicy variety, which definitely gave it a kick. A little extra garlic. Subbed honey for the sugar. Garnished with thinly sliced red pepper and cucumber in addition to the scallions. We WILL have this again! Yum!

Pretty good recipe, and very easy. I used half tahini and half peanut butter for more sesame flavor, and about 4 times the heat that they call for. I would recommend not putting in any water until you have blended the other ingredients - it might not need any, and certainly not 1/4 cup.

I have made this dish a few times & always double the sauce. If you don't, it is too dry & the flavors do not come through. I used angel hair pasta and added thin slices of cucumber with the scallions. Delicious!

Took other reviewers suggestions and added cucumber, red pepper strips, lime, cilantro, and grilled chicken (my husband marinated it in mirin, chili paste, and soy sauce). I used angel hair pasta. It was really good, but we were eating it for a long time, if you're only cooking for a couple you might want to cut down the recipe.

I used tahini instead of peanut butter and added a little extra sugar and thinly sliced red bell pepper. Delicious! I agree that it is a little plain for a main course but it makes a great snack or light meal. And it's so quick and easy! Although next time I think I'll take the time to chop up some cashews to sprinkle on top as another reviewer suggested.

I love this recipe. It is so easy and I can spice it to taste. I sometimes add thin slices of red and green peppers to give it a more colorful presentation.

I made this dish after reading the mixed reviews. I upped the peanut butter a bit, halved the water and put in a smidge more garlic (I love garlic) and thought it was great. I also served it warm as we were ready to eat as soon as it was done. It was so easy and yummy I will definitely make again.

This is an outstanding dish. Huge hit with my guests the first time I tried it. Easy, easy, easy. Done in just a few minutes. I'd serve it room temperature or even a little warm next time. Eat immediately after tossing w/ noodles or it gets gooey.

Not very good. The sauce was really thin and flavors not very distinctive.

We really like this one. I do punch it up with extra garlic-chile paste and lime, but it's really a good basic recipe to play with. Add tons of veggies and such, and it's a quick easy dinner.

This recipe was OK but I also made one of the other Cold Sesame Noodles recipes from Epicurious at the same time to compare the two recipes and I found that I liked both recipes very much when I mixed them together. This recipe was blended in a processor and I thought the sauce was too runny. The other recipe I used was cooked and came out thicker but didn't have garlic in it and it is very difficult for me to cook without garlic. So by putting the two recipes together I was very pleased with the favor.

I fully agree with other reviewers: bland, blah and uninteresting. I used Udon noodles, honey instead of sugar, added fresh cilantro, julienned red bell pepper and sliced English cucumber. Even after tasting, I "upped" some ingredients trying to get anything resembling flavor from this. The final result tasted like noodles with something thick on them...no other way to describe it. In my opinion it's not worth trying, the recipe hit the round file with a resounding thud. Next time I'll try Ming Tsai's "Spicy Vegetarian Peanut Noodle Salad" on www.foodtv.com.

This is one of my all time summer favorites. Sauce can be made up well ahead of time and stored until needed. Dress it up ith more chili, cucumber, red pepper strips, chicken - for the meat eaters, or baked tofu for the rest of us or just eaten plain. Soba noodles are really the way to go.

A popular recipe and easy to make. I double the source, up the chili paste, and added shedded English cucumber and red pepper for color and texture. I used Italian angel hair pasta and Italian parsley. Since I always has both item in my fridge. Being an Chinese myself, I find that it is easier to cook the angel hair pasta ¡§al dente¡¨ than the Chinese egg noodle.

This is an easy to make and tasty dish. I used soba noodles instead of egg noodles and added fresh cilantro as suggested by other reviewers. Next time I will up the chili paste. Marinated tofu would be good on the side.

Hi The blend of flavors was very good, and I took some advice from below and added a squirt of lime juice and to the peanut butter amount I added two tablespoons of tahini to make it nuttier. I wanted an easy-to-handle dish for a buffet, so instead of long noodles I used farfalle. It's the noodles that made me give this 2 forks rather than 3, so that's not fair perhaps. I followed the instructions on the farfalle box to cook for 11 minutes for al dente, and they came out underdone. I should have boiled them for at least another two minutes. If I had I would have perhaps liked the texture of this dish better, but the sauce was fine as it is written. I did not increase the red pepper flakes and thought there was just enough of a subtle kick without it becoming an obviously spicy dish.

Made this for a buffet party. I used smaller broken egg noodles and it was easier to eat than the long noodles. I would like to try it warm, I didn't think it looked very appealing cold. I mixed it right before serving and sprinked crushed cashews on top. It was pretty easy to make once you have all the ingredients.

I almost made the 1991 Cold Sesame Noodle recipe, but -- after reading all the cooks' reviews -- I made this one (1993) instead. Yum! It was so good, I'm not even tempted to try the other recipe. Also thanks to cooks' reviews, I have kept separate the different parts of the dish. I especially recommend this separation if you think you may have leftovers. Eaters can just mix the noodles, sauce and scallions in their own noodle bowls. Yum, again! Also, chunky peanut butter worked out just great.

Good recipe, simple and tasty. I simply used a wire whisk to mix up the sauce. Was a great addition for a Chinese themed meal for vegetarians.

I,too, found this bland and uninteresting. If I were to make it again (which I won't), I would go heavier on the flavors. Also, I cooked only 8 ounces of noodles, and still did not have enough sauce.

We loved this dish--served it with a side of chicken for the meat eaters and a side of tofu for the normal people :-)....added extra Yeo's Chili paste and served with Sesame seeds. It was fantastic.

This was very simple to make and tastes so good. It does make a lot, so if you are cooking for one, like me, you should halve the recipe. I've been taking it to work for lunch. It definitely tastes best after a day in the refrigerator.

I've been on the hunt for a cold noodle dish with good balance between the sesame, peanut, and ginger flavor. I think this is it. Instead of chili paste, I add a chili sauce I call "The Rooster" (http://www.huyfong.com/frames/fr_sriracha.htm). (Add extra for some real zip.) Also, instead of a blender, put the ingredients in a 2 c. glass measuring cup and use a "milkshake mixer" attachment on a hand mixer (no blades to scrape off).

Like the others, I thought the noodles were just a bit bland and uninteresting.

The sauce was a bit bland. We made a 2nd batch to make sure that we didn't miss anything, but to no avail.

Rather bland and uninteresting.

Always in search of authenticity I usesd tahini ( sesame paste) instead of the peanut butter - but it is a bit blander so for deepening flavor I added fish sauce ( nam pla) and chopped fresh coriander and for enlivening, a squirt of lime juice. To take edge off of fresh ginger and garlic I minced them and made sauce early in day and let rest ( but I think not longer) so flavors could blend. Asian rice or sweet potato noodles make the dish lighter and somehow more , well...Asian.

I love this recipe. I made a couple of modifications that were delicious: using chunky peanut butter gave it a slightly Thai taste, and about double the soy sauce made it a little more robust. WARNING: this is a heavy recipe, and we've been snacking on it for days.

I make this dish regularly, and sometimes add chicken - it's a terrific one dish meal! I found it too sweet with the sugar, so no longer include it. I agree with the comment about the cilantro; it makes a great addition, as do toasted sesame seeds. I've doubled the chili paste, too - YUM!!

DELICIOUS ON A WARM DAY!! DID NOT HAVE THE ASIAN CHILI PASTE, BUT THE RED PEPPER FLAKES ADDED A NICE BITE ANYWAYS.WILL KEEP LOOKING IN THE GROCERY STORE FOR THE CHILI PASTE.

This recipe is excellent with a very authentic Asian flavor about it. I made it for a potluck and it was very well received. I recommend adding Cilantro to it for an even better flavor.

I have made this wonderful recipe repeatedly--for quite a few people--and have received many enthusiastic comments. It's a near-perfect blend of flavours. The only alteration I've made has been to increase the amount of chili paste a bit.
