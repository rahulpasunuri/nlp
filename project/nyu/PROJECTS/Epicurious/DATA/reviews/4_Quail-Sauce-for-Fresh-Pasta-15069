We had 4 quail purchased from the farmers market, and this looked simple, elegant and flavorful. We cooked it up, and it was exactly all of those things. The preparation did not overwhelm the quail, and it was just so deliciously simple. A couple tablespoons of bruniose aromatics, some fresh herbs, some wine, and a tomato. We served it with fresh fettuccine pasta. Really great. I'd make this again in a heartbeat.

Great recipe. Couldn't find quail the first time so used cornish hen and it was still good. It probably made more meat with the Hen than the quail would have, and turned out more like a fancy "Chicken and Noodles" texture which was great as I like lots of meat with my pasta. Trying it with quail next and will take the advice of doubling the herbs.

Very good! Doubled herbs and wine. Used 3 large tomatoes. Sauce was a little bland so added 2 Tbsp of anchovie paste and 2 Tbsp of Brandy. fantastic!

Delicious! I make this often. Although I, also, double the amount of vegetables and wine. And I always undercook the pasta and then finish it off in the same pan as the veggies and quail. I just add a little water and bring it ALL to light boil. I think it adds a wonderful flavor to the pasta and really brings everything together.

This is a great recipe! I don't think I would buy quail to make it, but my fiance goes quail hunting once a year and this is an amazing way to cook up the birds. Watch out for tiny bones if you aren't really careful in pulling the meat off bones.

3.5 forks if possible. Followed previous reviewer's advice and added more herbs and the equivalent of a *large* tomato. Otherwise, followed recipe and got excellent results. Very good with fresh pappardelle and non-oaky chardonnay. Served it with poached rhubarb and asparagus salad.

Extremely good, as almost all Marcella's recipes are. The only quail I could find were pretty tough little bulletlike specimens, but after some lengthy braising they were as succulent as one could wish. I did end up having to add quite a bit of extra liquid, with the result that the sauce tasted a little pale. I added some nicoise olives just at the end, and it was wonderful-- tasty, impressive, and easy.

Wonderful recipe! Made this originally for a formal Holiday dinner last December to rave reviews. But...I always seem to increase the amount of herbs and sauce in any dish I make. Just bought some quail and can't wait to make it again!

This was a new experience as we don't usually have quail here. Found some in our great Italian market. Didn't have any white wine available so used chicken broth and used a little more so it made a lovely sauce. My husband loved it and next time we will try it for company
