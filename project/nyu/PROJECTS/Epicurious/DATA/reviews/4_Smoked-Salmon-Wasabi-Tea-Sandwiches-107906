Loved it exactly as written. I had leftover cream cheese and ate it later on bagel with leftover salmon--I always want wasabi in my cream cheese from now on!

Tasty, though next time I would probably amp up the wasabi. Added lemon juice as suggested by other reviewers; also added thinly sliced English cucumber for a bit of crunch.

YUM YUM YUM!! These are delicious! And so easy to make. Followed the recipe as written, including the grated lemon peel. Only thing I did not do, and wish I did, was to use very thin slices of whole wheat bread (I was in a rush and just got regular whole wheat bread). I would definitely go out of my way to find thin sliced bread next time, the filling is so good you really don't want a ton of bread overpowering it.

Used sourdough pullman bread which is what I had on hand. Also used whipped cream which made the mixer unnecessary. Having a squeeze of lemon juice and lemon zest made it very yummy.

like others suggested, used lemon juice instead of the lemon rind. i feel it would have been too bitter with both the wasabi paste and the cilantro AND the rind, but the juice worked out perfectly. warning for those thinking about doubling the recipe: it's also double the time to assemble the sandwiches, so plan accordingly.

I liked the flavor but I, too, thought they were a little bit dry and would add a squeeze of lemon juice to the salmon and a bit of black pepper and salt to cream cheese. I would also like to try it with a bit of grated fresh ginger mixed in next time.

Followed recipe but instead of lemon and cilantro I dipped one side of sandwich in blend of seaweed,sesame seeds and sea salt. Added nice crunch!!

Made exactly as the recipe is written and the layers of flavors worked very well together. These were served with cucumber & mint sandwiches as well as goat cheese & watercress--so having a selection with some protein and strong flavors worked well in the menu. Will have to try it using the chives instead of cilantro simply because that sounds terrific; but the recipe worked quite well as is.

Made this for a baby shower and everyone liked it. I used lowfat cream cheese and added a bit more than 1 T of wasabi powder as other had suggested. I also added chopped chives to the cream cheese (I was also making egg salad sandwiches and they had cilantro so wanted to differentiate) and rubbed fresh lemon on the smoked salmon instead of using lemon zest. Also sprinkled a bit of black pepper on the salmon. I put cream cheese on both sides of the bread (so the salmon with lemon juice wouldn't soak through). Used orowheat old fashioned wheat bread which is thinly sliced, but slightly smaller pieces of bread, so after cutting off the crusts, decided to cut each sandwich diagonally into two pieces. Ended up with 16 triangles. These were yummy. I will definitely make them again. I much preferred them to the curried egg salad sandwiches I made (recipe also from epicurious).

I made this as an openfaced appetizer. I rolled the whole wheat bread flat, cut out rounds with a 2 1/2" cookie cutter (flutted edge) and put them in mini muffin tins. I brushed with a little butter and baked for about 8 minutes. This makes very cute little cups that hold the rest of the ingredients very well. I too added a little more wasabi (made that the night before)and brought this as an appetizer for Thanksgiving. Everybody loved them - they disappeared fast.

I recently made these sandwiches for a baby shower. They received rave reviews. I felt there wasn't enough wasabi flavor in the cream cheese so I added a bit more... just enough to give it that tasty zip, but not make it overpowering. I also thought using the powdered wasabi was easy.

This was good, but not bold enough for my taste as written. Seemed that the cream cheese really overpowered the salmon/wasabi, and I couldn't even taste the cilantro. With a little tweaking, though, this is a great recipe with very complimentary flavors.

Served this bit as a lead-in to my leek pancakes with shrimp and sundried tomatoes and port-cumin reduction. The fish theme was established well with the fresh flavors and light palate of these munchies.The hearty base of toasted whole wheat gives great foundation to the salmon and wasabi. I added a tsp. or two of finely minced lemon confit(3 month brined lemon zest) which added great depth to the flavors. served without my modifications, it is always a huge hit with the dinner party crowd with sparkling wine or Viognier.

This is a great quick sandwich. The wasabi cream cheese is a great kick! I think I would add a squeeze of lemon juice on the salmon next time because it was a skosh dry (probably because I didn't use thin sliced bread). Overall very good for the effort! BTW, I used premade wasabi, it's much easier.
