Excellent and easy. The best roasted potatoes I've ever had. Yukon gold are essential, I think. Rosemary works well here. My boyfriend and I loved it, so we made a variation this week using sweet potatoes, turnips and rutabaga. Took twice as long to cook (and sweet potatoes got too done) but also very delicious.

Looks and sounds fabulous but I found it to be too dry. Felt like I was eating sawdust.

easy to make but rather bland. I will try with rosemary and whole roasted garlic next time. not a winner

I served this with a rolled/stuffed version of crown roast of pork with onion and bread- crumb stuffing for Christmas lunch and received rave reviews! I made half the recipe and it was the perfect amount for 4 people. To complete the meal I served cranberry horseradish sauce, roasted asparagus with hollandaise sauce and a tossed salad. It was a wonderfuland simplemeal! Even though Id still give this recipe 4 forks and will certainly make againit somehow didnt have a major wow factor maybe its the presentation. But, my guests loved it and there were hardly any leftovers!

I served this as a side dish for Christmas eve dinner with Prime Rib. It was perfect, and I could assemble it way ahead and roast it as the meat was resting. My family loved it. I will definately save this recipe for future dinners.

Excellent flavor with just a few ingedients! We made it with the crown roast at Christmas and everyone had seconds, took some home and wanted the recipe. Outstanding!

I was prepared to be disappointed and was pleasantly surprised by the taste given the recipe's simplicity. Great side-dish for something spectacular, as it is tastier than it appears.

Over cooked the potatoes in the blanche stage but they still turned out delicious.Definately will make again

This is a great recipe -- tastes delicious, looks beautiful. Great as leftovers in a Spanish omelet. Almost impossible to get this wrong -- left in the oven longer than planned, which just made the top a little crusty -- even better!

I changed the proportions slightly to 3lbs of potatoes for 1/2lb of lardons. I followed the instructions for preparing one day ahead and it turned out perfect. Delicious, everybody asked for 2nds. Served it with a roast leg of lamb for New Year's dinner, followed by Maple Creme Flan (B.A. Nov. '02). What a meal!

Fabulous!!! We had this tonite (Sunday) with a veal roast & my kids were trying to literally lick the bowl! They've asked me to make this again this week. The only change I made was to use i/2 the amt of dried thyme. Also, not a lot of work so was great to have with a main dish that required more attention.

I tried this last night and while it tasted pretty good, it seemed to be missing something -- cheese, maybe? I don't think I'd even call it a casserole -- they are simply roasted potatoes with lardon. Good, but a little too plain to serve as a side dish to such an elegant meal (as suggested.)

I've also tried it with fresh rosemarie and whole peeled garlic cloves. I found this way the garlic is less pungent and the rosemarie gave it much better personality.
