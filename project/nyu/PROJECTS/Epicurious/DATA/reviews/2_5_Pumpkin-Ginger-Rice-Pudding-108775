This recipe was great with a few modifications for time and money. I used canned pumpkin and it was still great. I also left out the ginger merely for preference. It does take quite a while to cook the rice and it was a difficult task without a double boiler, but the result was still good.

What a great addition to the Thanksgiving menu. The pudding was creamy and I loved the ginger and pumpkin combination. (I used whole milk from the farmer's market with the cream at the top of the bottle, maybe it made the difference.) I wouldn't change anything about the recipe. The only thing I would do differently, is wait to the last minute to carmelize the suger. I carmelized the suger in the morning and by desert time it had liquefied.

Yummy, and such a nice change from pumpkin pie. I cut the ginger to 1oz. Also, the ginger should be diced VERY small or you get too much of a ginger burst on the tongue. I also added a bit of cinnamon. I thought the pudding average until I carmelized it using brown sugar; then, al the flavors came together and I loved it.

Excellent recipe, but next time I`ll try baking the rice in the oven with the butternut squash instead of using a double boiler. I also think using jasmine rice and adding a little garam masala would be a nice Indian twist to, this dish, maybe a little basil also. Overall this was well received at my church pitch-in and relatively easy to prepare.

This was a huge disappointment. The ingredients looked so good, I love cooking with crystallized ginger. It turned out dry and lacking creamy flavor.

Delicious. It is creamy on top and towards the bottom where the rice sinks, firmer. Great combo of pumkin and crystallized ginger. Time consuming yet worth the result.

The texture was not good - it was too dry, not creamy even though I took it out of the oven after 45 mins (recipe said 50 mins - 1 hour). I also thought the ginger was way too strong, I thought maybe use half the amount but my husband thought it better left out altogether, even though he is a big ginger fan. I will never know because I will not bother making it again.
