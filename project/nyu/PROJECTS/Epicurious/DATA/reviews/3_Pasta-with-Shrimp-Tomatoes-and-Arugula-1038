We love lots of flavor and this recipe was fantastic with just one small addition-red pepper flakes. Add a generous pinch to the saute stage and you have a great, healthy dish. The garlic, red pepper flakes and peppery arugula are perfect together. Plus, you can pretty much eye ball the quantities of ingredients to your liking...i added a full pound of shrimp and probably a little less pasta as that can also make food too bland. So easy-will make this often.

I found this recipe when searching for a pasta dish with arugula and shrimp as I had both on hand and was in a hurry. I thought it was a great quick dish. I used farfalle instead of penne and added several small chopped tomatoes which gave the dish a juicier flavor. I did not have marjoram so that was skipped. At the end I flavored with sea salt and pepper. It was great!

I read the other reviews re. this being a bit bland so I changed the recipe a bit. I started by frying a small onion in olive oil (med. high), then added 4 cloves of minced garlic. After a minute I stirred in 1/2 a can of tomato paste, about 1.5 teaspoons of red pepper flakes and the herbs. Before it started to burn I added a small tin of stewed tomatoes. I turned the heat down to low and let simmer. I followed the recipe from there. I should have added more arugula. It was great.

Would not make this again. The flavours did not meld together, even though I increased the non-pasta ingredients and lowered the penne. Try something else!

Used spinach instead of arugula because I couldn't arugula at the store. Very easy to make and would make again. Good meal if your looking for fresh ingredients and easy cooking.

There is another recipe with the same name on this site, which is delicious. I mistakenly rated this one.

While I didn't find this recipe horrible, it was decidedly bland. I even added more herbs than the recipe called for, and it was fairly tasteless.

This is a really fresh tasting dish that is easy to prepare.
