My boyfriend loves gnocchi - all kinds- so I made this for his birthday dinner. I have to concur with all the cooks that said they added quite a bit of additional flour to the recipe. I don't mind that and am used to adjusting flour in bread and pasta recipes, but the additional flour needed here created enough gnocchi for 8! I hope that the folks at Epicurious will adjust this recipe so that people who are planning to feed two with leftovers or four for dinner will not be faced a choice of throwing away a lot of effort or remaining in the kitchen boiling batches of gnocchi while their dinner guest waits!

This is a great recipe I make to use up a bunch of spinach from the garden when it is ready. I use plenty of flour. These are miraculous in that they actually work, coming to the surface to be plucked out of the water, like little green leaves. A good way to eat spinach. The cheese REALLY makes it. Yes, they are labor intensive, but actually easy to make.

My husband and I made this last night as part of a Valentine's Day menu and it was fabulous! The gnocchi were so delicate, it could have been easily overwhelmed but the butter and Fontina made the perfect topping. This dish is labor intensive but worth it. Definitely a recipe to repeat.

Tasty, although a little chewier than I had anticipated. I ended up adding almost twice the amount of flour - this was likely because the spinach was not drained thoroughly enough (next time I might pat it off with paper towels). Still, the spinach didn't seem to add much besides color - next time I might stick with regular potato gnocchi. The topping looked a little boring, so I made a quick arrabbiata sauce and poured it over the gnocchi in a casserole dish, then topped with Fontina and cooked for about 15 minutes at 350 F.

Made this last night and was fairly disappointed. I make my own pasta frequently, but was not expecting this to be as labor-intensive as it turned out. It was not worth the effort in the end, either. It was bland, so it didn't taste *bad,* but it didn't taste *good,* either. Plus, the appearance of the gnocchi are enough to kill the heartiest appetite; though maybe I was rolling them incorrectly?

I made this for company, and we all loved it. The amount of flour seemed right on. It's important, though, to keep in mind that the recipe calls for the cook to flour all work surfaces and to keep his/her hands floured throughout. It is a slightly sticky dough. Even though there isn't any specific amount of salt called for, I added some to the flour--maybe about a teaspoon or two--and used some of the spinach water to boil the gnocchi. The end result was light and tasty. I will definitely be making this again and again.

I've had this dish in the Val d'Aosta several times, and this recipe is similar to it. There, they are called "strangolopretti" and are served hot and bubbling in individual crocks (like a large onion soup crock). I think the only change needed is to add a bit of salt to the gnocci recipe (which will enhance flavor without changing the delicate nature of the ingredients.) Since I love the original dish I had in Italy, I wouldn't change a thing, except for the salt, and perhaps sometimes substituting the Fontina with Parmesano Reggiano.

A big disappointment. Overall, very bland and the flavor that was present was not to our liking. Maybe it was the spinach/fontina combination. I ended up dumping most of the batch.

This was a little difficult for me. I think the trick is to make sure that the potatoes are REALLY cooked...my dough was quite sticky. I thought the gnocchi were bland. Maybe next time I'll spice it up with some chili powder....

This was my first pasta attempt, and I was suprised at how easy it really is. I think it could be even easier (and save dishes) to do everything in the food processor: mash the potatoes, add the spinach, then change the blade for the dough hook and start to add the flour. I found that I added WAY more flour than is called for in the recipe to get the right consistency.

This is a great gnocchi dish. All my guests loved it. I baked it with a little marinara for extra flavor which was very nice. I froze the extra dough and then took it out as needed. Guests are always impressed with homemade pasta, those who don't cook aren't aware at how easy it is to make.

I've made gnocchi before and this wasn't quite what I expected. Maybe I didn't get enough water out of the spinach, but they didn't have much substance and were very bland. I am Italian, and although I probably won't try the Bisquick recipe, I wouldn't insult someone who would.

I went through two rows of fresh spinach making this recipe...my boyfriend begs for it whenever he comes home from work. If you want to save time, just plop the dough into the boiling water like dumplings. They may look misshapen, but they are still good. I boil them longer than recommended, about 10 minutes, but that may be because of altitude. Also, I have used all different sauces, from a simple marinara to an alfredo, and it is always good.

I am not even going to comment on the Bisquick person from Rhode Island. All my Italian Friends are mortified!!!!This recipe is authentic and wonderful and was a hit with all my friends.

while not "authentic" Bisquick in lieu of potatoes makes an gnocchi that is very light and will not sit in your stomach like a brick. Try it I promise they are delicious!!
