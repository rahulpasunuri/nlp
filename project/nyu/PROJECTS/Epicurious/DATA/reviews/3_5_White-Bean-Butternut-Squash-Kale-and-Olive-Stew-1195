This stew was hardy and delicious although it needed some added spice. I cut back on the beans and onion and added tumeric, jalepeno, a little cumin to warm it up.

I liked the end result of this recipe, but it was a lot of work to make. Also, I made the mistake of using low-salt beans and vegetable broth. It was bland. I ended up adding salt. Also, it was a huge recipe and I will cut it in half if I make it again and adjust ratios of amounts - fewer beans, more sage. Being a vegan, I also omitted the Romano, but added some meatless "sausage." A tip: kale has sulfur in it, so you want to add the kale at the last minute. Let it wilt but don't overcook it or it will turn bitter.

I roughly halved this recipe and it made 8+ generous servings. Highly recommend topping with a soft poached egg after sprinkling with cheese, it brings out the savoriness of the stew so deliciously and makes for a really satisfying meal. Next time I make this I'll use carrots instead of butternut squash, I forgot how difficult they are to cut raw. Gave me dermatitis on my hand for about a day too.

Very tasty but needs some quantity adjustments in the ingredients! I used 1 butternut squash, 1 bundle of Kale, 2 onions, and 1 29oz can of beans and liked the resulting ratio. I needed to add about twice as much broth, though. And even those quantities gave me about 6 healthy servings of stew!

Pretty good vegetarian meal. I cut it in half and used 2 cups broth. Loved it with the romano! Very healthy. Also had it with couscous as a side since that is all I had. Brown rice would have been better.

I made this this afternoon for a potluck with friends and used up lots of organic vegies we had from our CSA. Big hit. I used 5 red onions (and a leek), 2 smallish bunches of kale, 1 butternut squash, 5+ cans of beans, 1 large turnip, olives, 1 1/2 cups of water. It came out great although I probably overcooked the squash. It makes a lot. I was concerned about the liquid but after I (over)cooked it there was plenty of liquid in there. Enjoy!!

I forgot to add - I wouldn't decrease the kale. I didn't find it overwhelming at all, but I really love kale.

This is a really lovely dish. It is attractive with all its colourful vegetables. I disagree that there are too many beans - the balance of beans and vegetables makes it a hearty main course. The only change I made to the ingredients was that I added 4c of broth. It does make a lot - not so much 6 servings as 12.

Was good, but awfully Kale-y. Maybe my bunches of Kale were larger than the author's, but one was almost too much. I certainly wouldn't use 1 1/2. I also used fresh rather than dried sage, and I think it really made the dish.

Something is horribly wrong with the ingredient amounts! Why don't you correct this recipe which when adjusted is quite good.

This was delicious, but the proportions do seem off. So for what it's worth, here's what I did, fyi: one onion instead of 3 (I'm not an onion fan) 3 cloves garlic (more would have been ok) 2 cups veg broth 3 cans beans 3/4 cup olives the full T of sage was surprisingly good and not overpowering. And I used turnip greens instead of kale (because I had them), and the tasted great. Great recipe. Seems very forgiving.

Very surprising how good it is, despite all the substitutions I made, and healthy too. I didn't have white bean or butternut squash so I used Japanese/Korean sweet potato instead for that sweetness and starchiness. I also didn't have chicken broth, and so, made my own substitute by boiling: water, three skinny carrots, kale stems, and a mixture of spices and herbs (thyme, oregano, garlic salt with parsley, chicken seasoning [whatever that is], cumin, and white pepper). I didn't have any sage, but figured, with all the spices and herbs I'd already added, they would probably be more than enough. I also added some salt to the broth. I used roasted red pepper from a jar, so I didn't really have to cook it; just added it towards the end of cooking the garlic and onion. I'd recommend chopping the olives instead of halving them, because they want to float into every ladleful, and someone's going to end up with all the olives, while the last person is going to have none. I like the grated parmesan in the soup, because it added a nice Italian flavor, although it might be better to sprinkle it on top of some toasted bread, so that it ends up in your stomach instead of melted onto your spoon.

It came out well, but only because I adjusted the quantities. If you make it as instructed it will serve at least 10 and overflow most cooking pots. For six people, use 30% less peppers, kale and squash and 50-80% less beans. Keep at least the same level of garlic, olives and seasonings (I even used a bit more). Add 50-70% more liquid. I also added 1 tsp of chipotle chile flakes, and you might try other seasonings too: perhaps cumin, coriander seed, tomato paste. I feared it would be bland, but it was tasty and hearty. Another unexpected feature: great colours.

My daughter is eager for us to eat more vegetarian meals and made this for the family. I was skeptical, especially about the olives. Was I wrong! It was delicious. She served it with quinoa and made the following changes: substituted 3 large carrots, cut into 1/2" rounds, for the red pepper; reduced the beans to 3 cans; substituted 4 Tb. fresh sage for the dried, used kabocha pumpkin instead of the squash; and increased the kale by a bit. We found that there was enough broth because the kale gives off liquid as it cooks. A really surprisingly delicious meal. Do not leave out the olives.

Love this recipe. I was skeptical at first, but the flavors were great - the olives and cheese really brought it all together. Tripled the amount of liquid and was careful not to overcook the squash. Also only used 3 cans beans.

Great recipe, perfect for winter time! I used leftover ingredients so my ratios were a bit off, but in all it was delicious. Didn't have red bell pepper so I added paprika and used carrots instead - it worked out wonderfully. With the carrots, olives, and bouillon cube instead of vegetable broth it was very flavorful.

Rating: 1
Marlon BLAND-oh! I added 4 cups vegetable broth, 2 vegetable bouillon cubes, 3tbsp. sage, and a lot of salt to get to anything substantial. Fact: This does make a lot of stew. I have only one other roommate so I could have benefitted from cutting this recipe in 1/2 and still had enough leftover to save money.

The olives sounded strange to me but honestly they were the best part. I added a bit more broth. Also I made just as written but I don't like cooked bell peppers that much so next time I think I will only use one and it would be just as good. Served with rosemary bread, this was delicious.

I Love this recipe with a few alterations. I omit the olives and add more stock to make it more of a soup.

Rating: 2
This was just OK. I wouldn't serve it for company, but it was good for lunch the next day. I think adding more stock would make it too soupy, but I agree with the reviewer who said to add less squash. It falls apart and takes over. The olives really make the dish, so don't skip them. The best part about this is probably that's it's super cheap and uses fall/winter veggies.

Rating: 3
We loved this recipe - a great way to use those fall/winter vegetables, and extremely healthy, too. I used fresh sage instead of dried and also added some fresh thyme and crushed fennel seeds. It needs way more broth than called for. I pretty much halved the recipe and it made plenty. Wish I had had some good crusty bread on hand.

This is okay as is. The next time I'll make the following changes: (1) use the Tuscan Bean recipe on this site as it adds more flavor to the disk, (2) puree a cup of the cooked beans using some of the broth to make the final version thicker, (3) cut the red bell pepper and squash into edible-size pieces--about 3/4 inch, and (4) be sure not to overcook the beans or squash as they become mushy otherwise. I oven roasted the squash seasoned with olive oil, salt and pepper, then added it with the kale.

Absolutely loved this recipe--definitely agree that it tastes better the next day (and the next, and the next.. this makes a huge pot!) As a recommendation for those who thought it was too sweet, try substituting green bell peppers for the red. It adds a more smoky flavor that I think better compliments the squash and the kale.

This was just OK. Not really a lot of zing. Could probably be improved by adding a lot of things, but I probably won't bother as there are much better recipes out there using basically the same ingredients.

This has been a household favorite since it was published. It's a great vegetarian dish for large groups-- family, church, lunch meetings...yes, a bit of prep, but we've had some good times getting everybody involved in chopping. AND even kids like this--the fact that it's a little bland -- main zip is the olives -- can be a plus for multigenerational gatherings. We like to garnish with pepper, nutmeg, lemon, etc. for those who want at table.

One of our favorite dinners, we make this often and love it. Delicious and it goes together fast! Hint: follow times exactly as in recipe or the squash will be too mushy. We make it as written, except use 1 can chicken broth instead of vegetable broth and use dry white beans (made in a separate pan) instead of canned. Don't forget the grated cheese; great extra flavor. My mother is allergic to onions so I made a big batch for her using celery instead of onion - she loved it too.

This was only moderate but it can be quite good with some adjustments. For instance, I would add thyme, nutmeg and perhaps some cayenne. And to give it some zing I think tomato paste and lemon juice or vinegar are necessary. But basically okay. I'll probably make it again.

I found this recipe to be too blend. So after preparation I added lots of paprika and some vegetable stock (the recommended amount is too little) to add some flavor to it. However, the combination of vegetables is very good.

Rich, complex and luscious! Vegan friends raved. This was my first experience with kale and I loved it-found myself digging around in the pot to extract kale bits. I added lots more garlic than as written and enjoyed the stew even more when reheated-flavors blend and complement each other even better over time.

I have to say that while it was an inexpensive way to feed an army, this dish left me less than impressed. I found it bland bland bland. Maybe a splash of balsalmic at the end or white wine at the beginning would have helped. I might try it again but I don't know if I could stomach all those leftovers again...

I made this last nite for dinner this evening. Am anxious to see if it can be better than last nite! My husband,friend and our dog loved the sample I shared. Yes...roast squash first and onions at 375 about 40 min. Used a jar of roasted red peppers, 5 cans of chicken broth, also nuked the kale to speed up the cooking process. This definitely needs more than 1-1/2c liquid! And it filled a 4 quart pot to the top...yum...lots for tonight and lunch on Mon!

Normally when I make a recipe that "serves 6" I wonder six what? Six small children? This recipe will serve six lumberjacks who have been lost in the woods for a month. The recipe is good, but lacking something. Perhaps a tablespoon or two of apple cider vinegar to balance the sweetness of the squash. Also, I found Gorgonzola crumbled on top preferable to Romano. One benefit--nutritionally this must be through the roof. But as Julia says, "I don't care about nutrition, I care about taste!"

I wasn't sure what to expect with this recipe, but it is delicious!! My two-year-old gives his "thumb's up". I did use chicken stock, and put in more than called for (4-5 cups). I used dried white beans that I soaked before. I also cooked the kale longer... more like 15-20 minutes.

This is a terrific Autumn recipe; I made it on an especially wet, coastal day and the colours, textures and tastes did much to combat the gloominess of the weather. Consumate kitchen rebel that I am, I made the following changes: I presoaked 2 cups navy beans and cooked for roughly an hour, I made my own stock with the reserved bean water and the vegetable peelings created by chopping the ingredients. While the stock was simmering, I oven-roasted the squash and onions with plenty of olive oil (I added a parsnip). Roast about half an hour covered in a 375* C oven, then uncover and cook until onions caramelise. I then briefly sauteed the peppers alongside the olives (1/2 Sicilian, 1/2 dried black) and I added two hot Italian turkey sausages, casings removed. Following this, I added the stock (5-6 cups, at least), beans, kale, and roasted veggies and cooked until kale was tender. Even our chronically picky five-year old enjoyed it.

Fabulous! We have made this stew one of our family standards...especially on cold winter evenings! I recommend steaming the squash a little to make it easier to peel and chop... it saves a LOT of time.

I "cheated" some for example I couldn't get butternut squash so I used sweet potatoes, and the amounts seemed so huge I cut back on everything (one can of cannellinis), but the flavor was phenomenal! And it was so easy to make!

Actually the 5 cans is correct- we've checked the magazine.

Absolutely fabulous. True comfort food. The squash took somewhat longer than 10 minutes and the kale took much longer than 8 minutes. I think I'll try putting them in together next time. Also, I only used 1 can of cannelini, and I assume the 5 cans was an error????
