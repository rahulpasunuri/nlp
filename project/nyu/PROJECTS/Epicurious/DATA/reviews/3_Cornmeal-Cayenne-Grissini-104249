NO! used all tips suggested and was still disappointed. Dry, flavorless and uninteresting.

Made as directed and incorporated tips from other reviews (cheese addition and pencil size suggestion). Guest liked them but I was dissappointed. Expected them to be a bit more WOW.

Addictive -- they are outstanding & very quick & easy to make.

The trick in my experience with this recipe is to roll the bread sticks out so they are very thin. The instructions say 2 teaspoons dough rolled out to 10 inches. I thought they were better a little thinner - 11 or 12 inches. (About the thickness of a pencil.) When too thick they taste a bit like saw dust. When very thin and very crisp the pepper and salt make for a very harmonious marriage. Good with drinks before dinner.

Amazing! Simple and tasty!

These are great! I've made them twice - I also added shredded cheddar and parmesan cheese. The cayenne really adds zip - add more if you like them spicey. I also rolled the sticks on additional parmesan cheese for more flavor. I only get 3 dozen - must be making them thicker or longer!

I couldn't stop snacking on these! I served them as dippers with hummus and guacamole but they are pretty good just by themselves. Easy to make too!

These breadsticks are very tasty. The cayenne gives them a real bite, and the cornmeal is a nice touch. They are easy to snack on!

These were fabulous! I added grated cheddar cheese and omitted the kosher salt because I didn't have any, but next time I might add a little more salt to the dough instead (it really could have used it). The first few I rolled out were too big, and therefore not crispy, but I revised the shape to be about as thick as a lady's baby finger in circumference, and they were crunchy, cheesy, peppery, and most of all, yummy. I would definitely make these again!

These are great. This was the first time I have made bread sticks and I will use this recipe many times again in the future. I used white corn meal instead of yellow, because that is what I had in cupboard. I also doubled the cayenne pepper. I have never purchased bread sticks as tasty as these.
