Following the previous reviewer I did not strain the pudding in order to receive a more "corny" texture. The recipe is very flavorful, yet a bit sweet for my palate. Next time, I would cut the sugar in half, and perhaps add a hint of nutmeg and ground ginger. Highly recommended and very easy.

I didn't care for the taste or texture. Personal preference. I love coconut but think the corn overpowered it too much.

I didn't use the seive to separate the solids since I don't mind the corn texture. The recipe was absolutely simple. The subtle tastes were superb!
