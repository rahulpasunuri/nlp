Perfect for hot summer nights, picked fresh heirloom tomatoes from our own garden

This recipe is a family favorite. The flavor is really great. We made a few variations; we used extra balsamic vinegar, penne pasta instead of linguine, shredded parmesan instead of grated, and added shredded chicken (just to make it our main course).

This was DELICIOUS. The only variations we made were to add more balsamic vinegar and we used penne pasta instead of linguine. This recipe is requested frequently by friends and family.

This was good though I expected a stellar experience. I believe our problem was that we didn't have the most flavorful tomatoes available. I bet this is wonderful at peak tomato season. I'll try it again as it's a keeper.

Instead of watercress, we used baby spinach, and added some sliced mushrooms...We also used the dark balsamic....A friend added shrimp & parmesean cheese....All great.

This is such a great, quick recipe for a weeknight meal. I had homemade fettucini in the freezer, so I used that instead of linguine. The grocery store only had 2 colors of the tomatoes and I used red balsamic instead of white. It was really great. The crushed red pepper gives it such a nice kick. It's definitely a keeper recipe.
