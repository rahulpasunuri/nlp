This is a wonderful alternative to the classic potato latke. I followed the recipe exactly, and was very pleased with the results.

This was and easy preparation and well worth it. It is much like the Indian pakora except it is not deep fried. Accordingly I served these pancakes with a tamarind chutney and some yogurt. It is important here to spread the mixture thin to avoid a dense, soggy center.

Scrumptious. A wonderful cross between falafel and potato pancakes. For the amount of egg, spice and flour, I believe 2.5 pounds of potatoes is a touch too much. Also, I added about twice the amount of fresh cilantro -- delicious. I fried them in a small amount of olive oil in a non-stick pan. I don't think these do well as leftovers. Over a few days, I found their flavor became too strong and even slightly bitter.

I really enjoyed these. I'm going to play with the spices a little bit to get the balance I want, but it's a great recipe that's well worth a little tinkering. I used a good nonstick pan and did not add oil for frying them, and while I imagine they would be even better with oil, I didn't find it necessary.

This unusual recipe yields potato pancakes with a luscious Middle-Eastern flavor reminiscent of falafel. My family loved these. They can be made ahead of time and reheated in the oven briefly at 350 degrees. Serve with sour cream and more chopped cilantro as garnish.
