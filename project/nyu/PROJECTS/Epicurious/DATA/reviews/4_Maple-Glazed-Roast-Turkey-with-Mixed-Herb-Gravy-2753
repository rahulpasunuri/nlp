I have been making this recipe since the 1996 issue came out. Would never even try a different one. It is perfect every time. It got wet in a drawer recently and I almost couldn't find it on the website, but there is was!

I made this turkey and gravy Thanksgiving, sans the stuffing. I put garlic, sliced apple, sliced onion, sage, and a stick of butter inside the bird. The cooking instructions were perfect, and the appearance was exquisite. I did a colonial New England inspired menu, and this was the perfect bird for it.

I have been making this recipe since it was in Bon Appetit in 1996. Thanksgiving is our family's favorite holiday and they look forward to this meal every year. They even ask for it for their birthdays. True traditional Thanksgiving meal!

This is a great recipe! After reading the reviews, I didn't expect the glaze to make a big difference, but it added just the right extra flavor. I also let it cook a little longer than I should have after reading others reviews, so my breast was drier than it should have been, but the gravy made up for it!! I must say, I'm not usually a gravy person, but this gravy recipe was excellent!! Would definitely make both again. :-)

I know ovens vary - but not THAT much! I did this with a 15 lb. turkey (& convectional gas oven) and found that I needed another 45 minutes... The results were fantastic though - what wonderful flavours! The meat was so tender! The gravy turned out to be the rave of the dinner - hubby's new favorite. A definite winner.

the gravy is the outstanding thing about this recipe; maple glaze works well also but does not flavor the turkey as much as I had hoped; stuffing was very oniony but fairly good

This was delicious! I will definitely make this again. But the cooking time was really off, in my opinion. I had a 14.2 lb. turkey, and I followed the cooking times, etc., to the "T." I needed about another 90 minutes' cooking time (I have a year-old stove, so I know it wasn't the stove.)

I made this turkey for Thanksgiving -- my first turkey! It is very easy and delicious. My guests loved it and requested that we use the same recipe next year. One suggestion I have is that you may want to make sure that you have more chicken stock on hand than the recipe suggests. My 12-lb turkey did not contribute much juice and the chicken stock evaporated very quickly in the oven, so I put it 3/4 to 1 cup of stock (instead of 1/2 cup as the recipe asks for) every other time I basted the turkey. I also put some coarsely chopped celery in the stock to add more moisture. Also, you may want to serve the turkey sooner than the recipe suggests when the skin is still crispy. This recipe is definitely one to keep -- the stuffing is even more heavenly.

The gravy is fabulous. I didn't add any pan drippings as I did not think it was necessary and I was right. As for the glaze, no one could taste the maple glaze. To add moistness, I injected the turkey with about 3/4 stick of butter. I'm going to try another turkey recipe but definitely keep making the gravy.

Gravy is fabulous! Throw some onions and Granny Smith apples into the roasting pan to caramelize while the turkey is roasting. I also did not add the ginger to the gravy and used homemade vegetable broth (because that was what I had) and it was still great.

GREAT holiday recipe - I used a different stuffing but the maple glaze was excellent and beautiful. The gravy was delicious and a lifesaver to make ahead - I made the "base" the night before and it was so convenient to only add drippings and herbs - we'll use it again for Xmas.

my family doesn't even ask anymore, they KNOW this is on the menu for thanksgiving. It always receives raves and seems to taste better each year. It is very compatible with a variety of stuffings. Don't pass over this one!!!

Excellent and so easy !!! The gravy was velvety smooth and really rich. Prepared this for Canadian Thanksgiving and it was awesome.

Absolute keeper!I borrowed an idea from another of your turkey dinners; to keep the meat moist, cover the breasts with cheesecloth moistened in stock and baste along with the bird. Remove the cloth about an hour before it's done to get it browned and crispy. The stuffing is awesome too! I prepare mine with that flat italian herbed bread. It has a lots of soft crust and you don't need to add the sage, savory or thyme then. If you have the time, it is worth making your own stock/broth in advance.

Oh yes....delicious. Perfect turkey - juicy and flavorful. I made the mistake, however, of waiting to make the gravy until late in the day and although it was very good, it was a suprise to taste it the next day with my 'leftover lunch', by whick time it was REALLY good!

This is wonderful. The glaze is also fantastic on chicken.

This is a fantastic turkey. Beautiful color and great flavor. The gravy is out of this world...so is the stuffing and the rest of the menu. I've stopped searching for the ideal Thanksgiving menu since I found this one.

The bird was a lovely dark golden colour, and tasted wonderful. I made my own gravy but the flavour from the drippings was just right. It's a keeper!

This was a fantastic turkey. I modified the recipe just a bit by adding less broth to the turkey (I cooked it in an oven bag). It came out moist, brown and crispy, and delicious!

This turkey was the most beautiful bird I have ever seen. Then it was the most delicious. The gravy was also excellent. I received many compliments and it was pretty easy to make.

My husband would not eat gravy until I used this recipe for thanksgiving. It is now a frequent request!
