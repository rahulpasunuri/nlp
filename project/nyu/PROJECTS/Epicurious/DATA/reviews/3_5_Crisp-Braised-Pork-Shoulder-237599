The thing that makes this recipe great is the spice mix. Even without juniper berries it resulted in a lip-smacking meal. (We also substituted cheap white wine for the water. Easy to do these days with a "2 buck Chuck" in the fridge.) Where we will change the recipe up in the future is the temperature. 350 is a too high and results in the meat cooking too fast in a bubbling broth. We will try 250 degrees next time, at a longer cook time. Regardless, this is a keeper and it's going into my epicurious recipe box.

I made this true to the recipe, despite relative concern over the time/temp disputes in the reviews. Cooked at 350 for 2 hours (2.75lb roast) and it came out amazingly moist and tender. Crisping the slices at the end worked well, and helped to render some extra fat that was still on the meat. It was also nicely seasoned. Subtle flavors, but it made for a nice platform to use the leftovers in a different way. All in all a versatile and successful recipe!

This is so good even my kids, who usually don't like anything new, enjoyed it. Flavorful and oh so tender. I added potatoes when it went into the oven.

Nice Recipe. Instead of water use apple cider or orange juice. If you want a more carnitas-like experience add orange juice and coke cola (don't use diet coke). The addition of allspice is also a good variation. The cooking temp is just plain wrong for this meat and braising. 200 for 5 hours, or 220 for 4 hours.

Since finding this recipe a couple of years ago while on a hunt for cheaper cuts of meat, I have made it innumerable times with many variations. TIPS: 1.Cook in oven WITHOUT a lid; otherwise it will never brown properly. 2. Begin checking for done-ness after 1 1/2 hours; I find it's usually done in 1 1/2 to 2 hours. 3. Make it your own by replacing the vegetables: I like mine best with garlic, cinnamon sticks, peppercorns, and fresh fennel. 4. Don't skimp on the salt. Really.

Really easy. The pork cooked up nice and tender...like pot roast. No real flavor to the sauce or pork for that matter.

I'm a new cook,so I will review this recipe...Not anything else. My family really loves this,and I work late's so I leave this for my husband to finish and he loves it. It is a nice meal instead of him boiling some raviolis I have even done it alittle different at times adding garlic to the carrot ,celery and onion also have added potatoes to the pot for the final cooking hrs. I'm not a great cook just having fun trying new recipes,but this one is easy and a must try!!!!!!!!

I made this almost exactly per the recipe but with only 2.5 lbs of boneless shoulder blade roast. It ended up quite tasty, but two hours of braising at 350 degrees resulted in a little too much disintegration to effectively complete the browning step. On the positive side, all the braising dissolved almost all of the large veins of fat, to my disbelief.

Done exactly as published at 350 deg. is not a big deal as the high amount of collagen in this portion of the animal responds well to the temp. and the water will not reach that high of a temperature anyway.The water is there to surround the meat in a moderate, moist heat. 250-350 braise is common in most kitchens I've worked in and this one comes out fine at home if you follow directions. I say try it at several temps and make up your own mind. My clients loved this one and asked me to add it to their favorites list.

It's true--long and low is always best for this cut (and beef pot roast). No biggie--I always extrapolate when reading a recipe. I cook pork shoulder at 200 degrees then broil at the end--perfection!

I am with you Cook From El Paso. People coming to this site to criticize should just save it and write a book. As for me I enjoy learning new techniques. There is more than one way to skin a cat!

To pbone...rate the recipe, not the cooking method. I did mine just like specified and it was great...moist and tender, and the browing it crisps up nicely. I get so frutstrated with people who don't even try the recipe, then put in their 2 cents worth and drag the rating down for the rest of us. Please save your opinions for when you get hired as a food editor for a magazine.

350 degrees is way too hot for braising. Braising is a form of steaming in a very small amount of scented, flavored liquid with specifiec vegetables under the roast, and one shouldn't have to turn the meat halfway through. In the case of this recipe or the pot roast with porcini and wine found elsewhere on this site, the half-submersion and high temperature amounts to boiling, not braising the meat. The roast ends up stringy and dry. I'd recommend a little patience and, after browning the circa 4lb roast (pork shoulder or chuck shoulder as in the case of the pot roast)cooking it in no more than 1" of liquid and resting on the vegetables, adding liquid only as necessary to keep the dish from burning. I'd almost double the time and cook the heated ingredients at a REALLY slow 180 degrees for a truly moist and succulent result. Otherwise the meat, especially this pork at 350 degrees for 3 hrs:0 will certainly be dry and stringy. Also, searing the slices at the end is in my view counter-productive and silly. If you want crispy, roast the damn thing.
