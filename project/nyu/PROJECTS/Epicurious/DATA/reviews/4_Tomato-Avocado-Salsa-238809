I love this salsa. I use a smoky chipotle salsa and then add avocado (I add an extra one) and I also add some chopped summer tomatoes. I've made it several times, and it is always eaten up.

Make it heartier by rinsing a can of black beans, adding some cumin, and an extra avocado.

Easy and yummy, but nothing exceptional... great on grilled chicken.
