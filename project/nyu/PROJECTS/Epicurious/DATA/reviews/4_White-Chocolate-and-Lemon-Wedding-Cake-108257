Fantastic! I quartered the recipe to make a 9" layer cake for a baby shower to rave reviews. One of the older ladies tracked me down to tell me she'd dreamed of such a cake all her life! (The lemon curd and frosting were so fantastic that I just halved those recipes and ate the rest with a spoon over the following week!)

I made this for my best friend's wedding. It was my first attempt at making a wedding cake and it came out beautifully! The recipe was easy to follow and it got rave reviews! The Bride and Groom were so pleased they ate the top tier usually reserved for the first anniversary when they got back from their honeymoon! I highly recommend this.

I am a seasoned baker and have concerns about the cake recipe. It is a well known rule that cakes made with buttermilk use baking soda but this recipe calls for only baking powder. The cake also calls for orange so why no soda?

Advice needed! I'm suddenly making a cake for friends wedding in 2 weeks. Not a huge do, 40-50. He would like one layer in chocolate and another layer in lemon or orange cake. Would the filling and frosting work okay on a chocolate cake, and then with orange as called for? Any suggestions for the chocolate layer? Thanks a bunch!

I got rave reviews from the lemon curd and mousse! I did add more zest and lemon juice to give it more of a tang. I didn't temper the white chocolate and will definitely do that the next time so the mousse will be smooth. This is now in my collection!

Fantastic cake and I got rave reviews. I made it for my sons wedding. The cake was moist, light, with good crumb, and flavor. The frosting was fantastic! One complaint: 1 The lemon curd recipe was too "yolky" even when I made it the second time and reduced the yolks. I ended up buying an artisan one from a specialty shop. 2 The mousse recipe instructions were incorrect. If you follow the directions as they are written the white chocolate seizes up. I know because I tried it twice. My solution was to barely warm the lemon curd set aside. Melt white chocolate until melted and let cool until it is barely warm, but still runny. Whisk the lemon curd and white chocolate together and set in the fridge while whipping the whipping cream. Now you can fold the lemon curd/white chocolate mixture together without having the white chocolate seize. 5 people have asked me for the recipe and I directed them to this site. I will make this again in one year for my sons anniversary!

I plan to make my own wedding cakes and place them on cake stands. There will be at least three different types of two layer cakes on three different cake stands. This recipe has the gourmet taste that I wanted. But, I have to improve my skills on frosting a cake. I took a basic Wilton cake decorating class and I know that it is better to have too much frosting (I feel you need at least double what the recipe calls for) than not enough frosting if you want a professional look. But my first attempt on making this cake was just to get it made. I had to convert/reduce the recipe for a two-layer cake. I think another reviewer did this but she put the measurements in ounces and I do not have a scale. Since I am a novice, the recipe stated to put the curd, mousse and frosting in the refrigerator for at lease one day. I did this but when I tried to put the curd, mousse and frosting on they were stiff and unspreadable because they were cold. Please help me solve this problem. Because of this problem, the cake was not as attractive as it could had been but it tasted like it was made by a professional. I am going to take time to carefully reduce the recipe and will probably re-type it. The recipe is hard to read and follow be they tried to keep it on one page. I will definitely will make this cake again and I will make if beautiful if I learn how to spread the cold curd, mousse and frosting. Unlike some other cake recipes, this recipe surpassed my expectation. I agree with the other reviewer that you have to keep the cake cold or else it will begin to melt. I would not suggest transporting it long distances in a warm car.

Thanks to the cook above who posted the weight of the flour - that saved me quite a bit of time! This recipe takes a long time to assemble, bake and then do again, but it's worth it. A very sturdy, yet light, cake that is easy to cut into layers and has a pleasing texture. I will be making this one again!

After making this cake for the third time this weekend, I've a few lessons learned to share (my first attempt was a disaster since my brain was off that weekend so I didn't include that attempt).

This cake recipe is absolutely delicious! This is my third time making up the batter for different events, and every time, people love it. I tried reducing the recipe to one-fourth, even though I know you aren't supposed to do that with cakes, to make a batch of 24 cupcakes that turned out perfectly! It will be my new cupcake recipe from now on. For a recent wedding, I used a filling of raspberry jam and fresh raspberries instead of the lemon, which I liked just as much if not better than the lemon. I also used a different recipe for the frosting, more of a white chocolate buttercream (8 tbsp butter, 8 oz cream cheese, 1/2 lb white chocolate, and 1 lb powdered sugar- made twice), which I liked better and found to be easier to work with than whipping up heavy cream. I tend to bake the cakes a little longer than the time stated because they've fallen on me twice now, but that's been my only complaint!

Everything together tasted wonderfully and the cake recipe yields a delicious, dense, durable sponge cake. I like many of the other reviewers had trouble with the fillings. The fillings and frosting did not seem to do well outside the fridge for more than an hour. The frosting though tasty also could have been stiffer-- it would have been fantastic on an everyday cake or beneath a layer of fondant, but it like the fillings did not hold up well on a 75 degree spring day, nor did it spread smooth, clean, crisp edges. If you make this cake, make sure it is kept cold just until it is to be presented as the fillings and frosting will ooze, and use supports in all cakes including the topper (my topper actually toppled even though I felt I followed the instructions to the letter) Personally I would make the cake again and choose different fillings and frosting--the frosting itself would make a suitable filling choice.

This is an incredible recipe! Everything worked out just as it was suppose to. I made this for a wedding this past weekend, using fresh flowers in season. Thanks to all the good advice, I was able to feel confident in taking on such an important thing. I was very appreciative of the comments. I used a special cake center I bought at Michael's to avoid any problems with the larger cake collapsing as some people experienced. Everything went without a hitch. I can't tell you how many raves I got with this one!

I made a scaled-down version of the cake and frosting for a birthday party (half recipe), as I am looking for ideas for my friend's wedding cake. It was great, not too fluffy and not too dense, and everybody loved it. That said, I found it a bit too sweet and not interesting enough. However, I live in Italy and there is no such thing as OJ concentrate, so I used juice, which of course was wholly undetectable. I am sure it would have been better with the concentrate. The frosting is excellent, really good spreading consistency (I dyed it pink for the 6 y.o. birthday girl), and I even accidentally used regular granulated sugar and it still came out absolutely perfect. But I couldn't taste the white chocolate and it too was cloyingly sweet. Some people like that though, because it was a big hit! I think I will keep on looking for a wedding cake recipe...

I only made the cake portion of this recipe, and it was excellent. I used orange juice in place of the concentrate just to keep the liquid ratio intact. It worked out well because I couldn't detect the orange flavor but it kept the cake very moist. My family only eats fluffy cakes (prefer box mixes!) and this fit the bill. It was moist and delicate, and froze extremely well. I will keep this in mind if I need to use it as a wedding cake.

The minute I saw the cake on the cover of the June 2004, I knew it was the cake I wanted for my September 2005 wedding. We did a test cake about6 months before and it was a hit! No problems with cakes falling, layers slipping or anything. We did take the orange flavor out, as my husband-to-be is not a fan. Also, since everyone does not like lemon, we did do a layer with raspberry filling. We decorated it with beautiful flowers in rich fall colors and set it atop a garnet colored tablecloth. Stunning. All my guests absolutely loved it.

I made this cake for a 50th wedding anniversary. The cake itself turned out perfectly and was easy to work with. However, the lemon curd oozed out between the layers and the layers slipped off of each other before I inserted the dowels. When I delivered the cake to the restaurant, lemon curd was oozing out of the bottom of each cake. If it weren't for the dowels and MANY FLOWERS to conceal the dripping lemon curd, this would have been a disaster. Nonetheless, the cake tasted terrific, although I felt that the curd was a bit tart.

To Lynn of Manhattan Beach: Although I have not made this cake, I suspect that the fallen center indicates you have underbaked the 12" cake. Larger cakes need a longer bake time. Besides simply baking another 5-10 min. and testing with a clean toothpick, I have two suggestions: 1) buy "magi-strips" at a craft (i.e., Michaels) or baking store that sells wedding cake supplies, and soak in water and use them to wrap the cake pan before baking; this slows down the baking around the edges and allows the center to bake more uniformly. 2) Buy a "heating core" (a $3 item) and place in the center of the pan before baking. This allows heat to penetrate the center of cakes that are 12" or larger and to bake more evenly.

I made this for the first time to rave reviews. The only thing I did differently is reduce the lemon juice requirement in the Lemon Curd Recipe by 1 cup. It still came out very tangy. The cake was moist and the frosting and mousse were delicious. Reading the tips from the others was a tremendous help. This recipe is one I wouldn't hesitate making again.

Has anyone had the problem of the cake failing to rise? I've made the 12" tier twice, baked it in a 350 degree oven for 1 hour 20 minutes, and each time it collapsed in the middle. The first time, I thought that the oven temp. was off so I used a friend's oven that is very reliable. But again, it did not rise above the pan sides and sunk in the middle as it cooled. What am I doing wrong? After adding the mousse,curd and frosting, the cake itself was delicious. But for a wedding, I can't live with the sunken layers!

I haven't made this cake, but wanted to suggest a source or two for information on increasing cake recipes to feed more people: there are 2 great books that tell you how to do it. #1, which I think any cake-baker should have, is Rose Levy Bernbaum's "The Cake Bible". She has something called "the Rose factor" in the "Special Occasion Cakes" chapter that tells you how to increase the recipes. #2 is by Dede Wilson--I think it's called "The Wedding Cake Book." It's full of recipes for suggested cakes, and each is given in a trial 6" cake so you can make a small one to see if you like it!

Hello Everyone, I was just wondering if anyone had any experience or advice about reworking this to make a larger cake? I would like to make it for a wedding with about 150 guests, and am nervous about what to do with the cake ingredients so it will turn out right in larger pans. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!

This wedding cake recipe is a real winner. The cake is delicious, very straigtforward to make and keeps well. The last is especially important for a wedding cake because it's made, filled and decorated at least one day ahead of the event. I liked the 3-inch high cake pans which made making a large cake so much easier: one pan per tier and then the 3-inch high cake(s) were easily sliced into 3 layers. I made the cake 3 times (half recipes as directed in the instructions); the only modification I made after the first time was to cut the salt amount in half. All three times the cake was moist and stayed that way for at least a week when refrigerated. One time I slightly underbeat the whites (I was doing it by hand which takes a fair amount of effort when adding the sugar and I erred on the side of very soft peaks); the cake was still delicious, just a bit denser like a pound cake. I did not try the frosting recipe as I wanted a cake frosted with whipped cream and filled with a lemon mousse. I made my lemon mousse by making the recipe given for Lemon Curd and then folding in an equal amount of whipped cream. I filled the cake with small diced strawberries and my version of the lemon mousse. As a trial, I made the cake a day ahead of serving it to friends (who loved it) and then I stored the remainder in the fridge for 5 days; my husband and I had a slice each day to see how the cake kept. It stayed moist and delicious, yet never became soggy with the filling. To me that makes it an excellent choice for a wedding cake that has to made a day or even 2 days ahead. I was trying this cake out for a wedding; the wedding has been postponed so I haven't had an opportunity to experience the "collasping" problem described by some reviewers. But filled as I did it, I don't anticipate any problems; the cake seems sturdy enough when refrigerated overnight.

My sister and I made this cake (we halved the recipe) for our nephew's birthday party. Like many of the other reviewers had happen to them, ours also collapsed. The lemon curd was a bit strong, and we are all lemon lovers in my family. The bread was also too dense, other than that.... the flavor was wonderful, the presentation AMAZING, the mousse, filling, and icing... all super easy to make. I used Ghirardelli White chocolate to save a buck.

This is possibly the best cake recipe ever devised. But when I made the entire recipe (following the directions meticulously) and tried assemblying the three tiers, it collapsed. It made for quite the memorable wedding as we served guests from the bottom shelf of the refrigerator where it imploded. I think part of the problem is that the cake is so moist, and the filling so gooey, that there isn't enough support for the dowels, even if you use a bunch. If I were going to do it again, I'd freeze the layers before I assembled the whole thing. Then I'd refreeze it for easier moving and transporting. That way, you could display the cake during an event and it would just thaw to the right temperature. Also, I didn't use the berries. They overwhelm the delicate flavor of the white chocolate.

Excellent cake. $30.00 worth of Lindt chocolate but didn't really taste the chocolate. Found the Lemon curd really strong. I made the Lemon-Berry Wedding Cake for my wedding last year and liked that one a lot more. I'm not bashing this cake - it was a really good one and had lots of people ooohing and awwwwing over it. Made this cake for my parents 50th Wedding Anniversary and decorated it with fall flowers. Plan on a week to make it. (well, I work during the day so I made the components in the evening). Next time I would take the icing out of the fridge earlier so that it could spread better. They don't mention it here but they did for the Lemon-Berry Wedding Cake - Heat your off set spatula in hot water to smooth the icing. Works really well. Make sure you have a paper towel handy to wipe off the water.

The elegant picture on the website led me to look at the receipe which I made for a friends wedding a couple weeks later. Everyone RAVED!!!! I have made it three times now. The entire receipe twice and 1/2 once. I did notice a smidge of dryness one time but can't say why not the other times. I loved the directions, VERY specific, and much appreciated when you are taking on such a Big thing like a wedding cake. I would recommend it to anyone wanting a delicious, unique cake. P.S. The frosting is amazing, it holds up to travel and summer temps.

I made this cake for my daughter's wedding this past August. I tested the recipe by making a "half cake" about 2 weeks before the wedding and felt confident with the recipe. A week before I started the process and went through each step to only have it collapse at the prep stage. Still the cake received raves

I am sure with all the rave reviews that I am doing something wrong. Perhaps overbeating the egg whites? I am a fairly experience baker, but it came out rather dry for me. My husband assured me it was delicious and I agree that the fillings were at least delish, but I wouldn't feel comfortable serving this at my brother-in-law's upcoming wedding because it seemed more like a pound cake to me. I have to say again, though, that the frosing and the lemon mousse are divine! Anyone who has any hints about the dryness, please let me know. I thought I even underbaked a little.

Excellent, delicious cake you really CAN make even if not an experienced baker - like me! Everyone raved about it, and the pastry chef at the restaurant where the cake was served asked for recipe. Ok, admittedly I only made 1/2 the recipe, creating just the bottom 12" tier to serve as a large birthday cake. (The recipe's instructions make this "halving" easy.) I made the two fillings, frosting and cake all on one day, then assembled the cake the next morning. (As someone else said, do NOT shortchange time for these elements to refrigerate!) I opted for a long serrated knife, and marked off the layer heights with toothpicks to help guide me. But, here are my two mistakes and consequent advice, both occuring when I tried to transport this cake from home to the birthday party location. 1. I put parchment between the cake and its plate (recipe didn't say to do this) so cake started to slide off plate when being transported. 2. Layers of cake also started to slide off each other, even after cake was frosted, because there were no dowels in it to skewer layers together (I had no other cake tiers to support). To solve this, I wedged tall, parchment covered blocks into the box corners, securing the cake. I brought extra frosting to fix the four spots smudged by blocks when I got to the party location. Would have used dowels, then removed them at location, if I had realized that was the problem at the time! Absolutely will make this cake again. (And even transport it!)

I used your recipe and great tips as a guide to make this fantastic cake. The bride, a wonderful friend, wanted a square cake, so I used 1/2 the cake, curd, and mousse to make the middle 12 inch layer of her three tier cake. I also cut the dowels shorter and used 9 per layer to hold the layers steady. Dental floss works wonders to cut the cake prior to filling. When I made the sample for the bride to try, I only did a two layer cake with one layer of fillings - it was a big hit too!!!! This is a fantastic recipe!!!

Delicious and elegant! I made half the recipe, making just one tier (12" cake) to serve as a birthday cake. It was moist and quite tasty. Impressive to look at; I'd never made a triple layer cake before. Make-ahead schedule was very handy. Each of the components were flavorful and distinct. Wouldn't change a thing!

Fantastic!! Fabulous combination of flavors and textures!! My first attempt at a wedding cake-a gift for my brother and his new wife-and the results were wonderful! Guests returned for seconds and wanted the recipe, saying it was the best wedding cake they had ever tasted. The fillings and frosting were absolutely delicious, held up well, and helped flavor the cake. The cake was firm in texture, but not dry. The baked layers were easy to handle, although you might want to try a leveling saw, rather than trust a bread knife & your eye for a line to cut the cake into layers. If the layers aren't almost perfectly even, there is a tendency for the layers to slide when filled. Be sure not to short-change the refrigeration times listed in the recipe; this is critical for assembly success. The directions for a timeline and transporting the cake were very helpful. However, I did not trust the engineering of the raised dowels to support such a heavy cake, and simply stacked the tiers with the dowels cut off at layer level, and then decorated with cascading flowers down the side of the cake. I also did research at a well-equipped baking supply store & found that pans with removable bottoms, (which are hard to find), weren't necessary with the use of a commercial cake shortening. If you feel the need for self-education beyond the recipe, as I did, I recommend investing in a how-to book by Wilton to increase your self-confidence when giving this sort of project a try for the first time. It took me four entire days to to make, assemble, and transport, so allow plenty of time. Overall, well worth the effort and time; truly a labour of love, as the author stated!!

I've never made a wedding cake, so I'm not sure how this works. Are the upper layers placed on cardboard rounds and then balanced on the dowels in the level beneath? I'd appreciate it if someone could explain!

This cake is outstanding! This recipe was well thought out before publication. It seems difficult, but if you use the "time management chart" and only do what it says each day it's a "piece of cake"! I volunteered to make this cake for a friends Wedding before trying it, just from reading it and lokking at the picture (very elegant). I did a dry run for my husband's faculty party at our home. I went very easily. It was better than most I've ever had. I am still receiving cards and comments on this cake. The frosting was just right. Easy to fix if you "ding" it. Recipe is easy to halve for smaller occasions. Would not change anything in this recipe.
