I have been making this couscous recipe for years. Whenever I need a couscous recipe, this in the one I always return to, even after looking over many others. It is great!

Absolutely fantastic. I made this as part of a romantic dinner for two and it was a hit. I have to say I made quite a few changes though. I used 2 c. Israeli couscous in 2.25 c vegetable brother simmered with the seasonings and apricots. I substituted cranberries for the currents and basil for the mint. So if you're looking for a variant I can guarantee this was wonderful. Vegetable stock instead of water for the couscous adds a lot of really lovely flavor where sometimes couscous can be bland.

I made this as a side dish for a party and everyone loved it. It's simple to throw together at the last minute, and looks beautiful on the table.

This is very very good! The pistachios make it delicious! Toast them perfectly and it will make the couscous delicious! Goes great with grilled salmon.

I've made this on several occasions, and always to rave reviews. It's a special side dish that has broad appeal.

I took this dish to celebrate a book release (Circle of Wisdom by Margaret West)and it was very well received. I finished the dish with a dusting of ground cinnamon over top. Will increase the mint next time and use dried cranberries instead of the currents.

While a good party dish, it lacks texture, color, and moisture. The second time making this recipe, finely diced carrots were added for color and crunchiness. A very small amount of vegetable broth and olive oil were added just before serving to add a little bit of moisture and more flavor without adding salt.

I made this for a pool party where there were going to be several vegetarians. While I don't particularly care for couscous, this was really good. I replaced the currants with dried cherries since some people just have this thing about raisens. I have since made it as a side dish for pork tenderloin recipes.

Hate to be a naysayer, but this just lay there with no pizzaz. I made it for our book club where I usually try out new Epicurious recipes and for the first time actually came home with leftovers. It was better the second day, but not much. So many other great recipes on Epicurious that I would go on to another side dish.

I served this at a graduation buffet (paired with grilled salmon with cucumber, tomato, and yellow pepper salsa) and it was a great hit! It was easy to make ahead and serve at room temperature. I used fresh apricots instead of dried and added them to the cooled couscous rather than to the boiling water. I was out of stick cinnamon so I used about a quarter tsp. of ground, added to the cooled couscous, and it was fine.

I made this for a committee luncheon and it was a great hit. I too added dried cherries and substituted cashews. Do not serve chilled as the flavours are much better when served at room temperature.
