What a delightful recipe this is! The whole look of the dish alone is such a wonderful pick-me up. And it's not at all hard to achieve. The sauce is especially nice and since we adore ginger, it was right up our alley. We'll be posting it soon on our blog www.chewingthefat.us.com

I was terribly disappointed in this recipe. I'd been looking at it for quite some time and was very excited to make it. Furthermore, since I live in an area in SoCal that has many ethnic markets, my selection of quality ingredients was not at all limited. I followed the directions to a "T" but, in the end, the shrimp was soggy and the sauce was less than flavorful. It was too much effort for the less than stellar results that, at first glance, this recipe promised. I defintely will not be making this again.

Excellent - the true taste of the shrimp came out and was not overpowered.
