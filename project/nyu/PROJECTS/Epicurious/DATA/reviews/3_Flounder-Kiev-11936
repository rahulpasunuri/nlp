Not only was it great -- I hav enever been able to find a "Kiev" recipe, but will try this w/ chicken. I added aa couple of (1 tsp.) crushed capers to the garlic butter for the fish. Thought it was fabulous!

It was terrible!!! I browned the fish for longer than the recipe said and it still wasn't done. The flavor left something to be desired as well. Definitely would not make it again!!!

This was a good recipe. Unlike the directions, Instead of frying my Flounder, I browned my Flounder in a small amount of oil and finished it the oven. When the flounder was done I deglazed the pan with White Wine and Lemon Juice and served the Flounder on top of the sauce.
