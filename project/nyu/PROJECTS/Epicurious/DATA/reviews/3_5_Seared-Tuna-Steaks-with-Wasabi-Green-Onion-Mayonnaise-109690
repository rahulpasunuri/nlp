Great and flavorful. I personally do not think that the 30 minutes suggested marinade time is enough, as there simply wasn't enough taste from it left over in the dish. Also, you just do not need that much of the mayo sauce. Overall, will make again, for sure.

Great dish! The marinade was delicious, and you could taste it even after only 30 minn. The mayo I thought took away from the fish a bit, and might not be for everyone.

The absolute best tuna ever. I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 plain yogurt, added some chopped ginger to the marinade as someone suggested. Used Ahi Tuna and only grilled it for less than 2 min. per side for med rare. Awesome.

Delicious and easy! Added lots more wasabi to the sauce and it was fine with Whole Foods canola mayo. Served with the jasmine rice with cilantro, ginger and garlic from this site and roasted asparagus. Making again this weekend!

Loved it even though I didn't have all the right ingredients (no teriyaki sauce in the house) but the wasabi was a nice kick in contrast to the mayo and saltiness of the soya sauce

Fabulous! After jonesing for tuna steaks, I searched for a recipe on my phone outside of the supermarket, and this one looked good. It was amazing! I marinated the tuna for an hour, used half mayo/half sour cream for the sauce and added a bit more wasabi, and pan seared the steaks dredged in sesame seeds. I served it with some jasmati rice and roasted asparagus. My husband and I loved it. If you're looking for a great tuna recipe in a hurry, you've found it!

SO GOOD! I made substantial changes to the recipe following what previous reviewers had recommended: Instead of 1/2 cup mayo, I used a little more than 1/4 cup sour cream and a little less than 1/4 mayo. I used 2.5 tsp wasabi paste (we love the stuff). I doubled all of the marinate ingredients and added 2 Tbsp minced fresh ginger. After marinading our tuna steaks for an hour, I dredged them in sesame seeds and then pan seared it in a very very hot pan with some vegetable oil. My fiancee LOVED it and we vowed to make this at least once a month as a regular meal. It was delicious. Next time I will serve with some bok choy.

do not, i repeat, do not put tuna on the george foreman if you don't have a grill. firm is an understatement. but flavor was great & was very good flaked over salad the next day. used kewpi mayo, too. yum.

I would like to offer a little different spin on this as I just made it and was delicious. Keep the soy dipping sauce as is. Marinate the tuna as recipe calls for, but afterwards I pressed black and white peppercorns into each side and seared in a little bit of peanut oil in a cast iron skillet for a few mintes a side until about 1/4" cooked through each side. Slice against the grain. Instead of the wasabi mayo - I mixed wasabi and avocado until smooth ( as much wasabi to suit your taste) and finished with some lime juice. We put the avocado mix a top each tune slice and dipped in soy mix - served as a appetizer with chop sticks ( and a few forks). This is delicious and doesn't have the mayonaise at all !!

This was excellent and so easy to make! Followed the suggestion of previous reviewers and used 1/2 mayo 1/2 sour cream. It made the sauce a little more delicate. Loved it.

Easy weeknight meal, dressed up by the sauce. I love anything with wasabi!

Ok, good basis, but needs help. Add more wasabi, juice of one key lime and a little rice wine vinegar. A little salt and pepper to taste. This really makes it a lot less like a mayonnaise and more like an appropriate accompaniment to this great fish. Add some minced ginger to the marinade. Dredge the tuna in toasted sesame seeds, then pan sear for 1 minute each side. Truly delicious

Rating: 4
My husband and I loved this recipe! I took viewers advice and used a ratio of about 3 to 1 sour cream to mayo, but used non-fat versions of both (couldn't tell the difference at all). Although the idea of the dairy and fish gave me pause, the wasabi and sour cream give a cool heat (if that makes any sense) I increased the amount of marinade, added some sesame oil and (my secret weapon in marinades) garlic - ginger paste. Once the steaks had marinaded for about 45 minutes, I wiped the steaks off to get rid of the extra marinade and dredged them in some sesame seeds. Pan seared, not grilled, the seeds get crunchy, so good. Served with a green salad with avocado and black beans.

Rating: 3
This is a great recipe... especially the dressing. Like other reviewers, I used 1/4 cp mayo, 1/4 cp sour cream. I also used 2 tsps of wasabi. I doubled the marinade (the single recipe didn't seem like enough) and let it soak in for an hour in the refrigerator. The marinade was very very mild, but still good. I'll definitely use the mayonnaise mixture again with other grilled fish. For a very quick and easy recipe, this one was fantastic.

Rating: 3
The Wasabi-green onion sauce was excellent. Wasabi paste is nothing but wasabi powder and water. The powder is available in oriental markets or your local grocer. Fresh Wasabi corms are available. Use three times the listed amount for your dry ingredient. The tuna doenn't need to be cooked that long. Try 3 minutes per side for a 1 inch steak. slice into a steak. If there is 1/4 to 3/8 red meat, the steak is cooked enough.

Rating: 3
We loved the marinade for the tuna...gave enough flavor to accent the meat without overpowering it. Would probably try adding some ginger next time too, I don't think that would hurt it at all. DO NOT OVERCOOK YOUR TUNA!!! The sauce: not so good. If you have a good piece of tuna (we used sashimi grade) you don't need anything with it at all! So no to the sauce, but will def make the marinade again!

I made this for Valentine's day - my wife and I LOVED every bite of it! I did make a few modifications, some were suggested by other reviewers: 1) Per other reviews, I changed the sauce to 1/4 mayo and 1/4 cup sour cream. 2) We had two 1/2 lb ahi tuna steaks that were sashimi grade which I think makes a huge difference. The better the tuna, the better this will be. 3)In my opinion the marinade quantity was insufficient so I doubled it. 4) I added some prepared ginger to the marinade, about 2 tablespoons (only 1 tablespoon if you make the original quantity of marinade). 5) I pan seared this in grapeseed oil for about 1.5 mins per side in a 400 degree pan. It came out a perfect seared rare temp. I really think this is better than grilling it as the pan searing caramelized the marinade on the tuna and the grapeseed oil has a higher flash point and more neutral taste than most other oils. The author is right to suggest leaving the tuna out on the counter as bringing it to room temp will make sure it's not ice cold in the middle after cooking. 6) For sides we had jasmine rice and sauteed green beans which I thought complemented this well. The meal was absolutely PERFECT in every way. I can't say enough good things about this recipe and will definitely make this again very soon. Plus it was so quick and easy to prepare.

This was excellent - so easy for a weeknight and very flavorful! I followed other reviewers advice and used 1/2 mayo, 1/2 lite sour cream and doubled the wasabi paste and really liked the consistency and flavor. The tuna steaks I had were fairly large so I doubled the marinade. I also let them marinate in the fridge for an hour and then outside the fridge for 30 minutes before cooking. I seared the steaks instead of grilling them - 2 minutes per side over medium-high heat was just enough! Will def. make again!

So easy and delicious. I don't like Teriyaki sauce, so I substituted some ginger slices and 2 teaspoons sesame oil in the marinade. Also, I used half mayonaise and substituted Trader Joe's Greek yogurt.

The wasabi mayonnaise was delicious! We used leftovers for tuna sandwiches the next day . Obviously, the key to this is to use the best and freshest tuna you can find.

Hi, overall this recipe was OK. I couldn't find tuna steaks at the store so I used a can of tuna fish and I added about 3 times more teriyaki sauce then described. I also didn't find the wasabi paste so I just used mixed in horse radish sauce, and didn't bother adding the rice vinegar for budget reasons. It turned out a lot different then the picture, but it was great. Next time I will add this to a sandwich. Also don't eat very much of this stuff.

Rating: 4
Simple and yummy! We marinated the tuna for about 8 hours and grilled on a hot grill for 3 & 1/2 minutes first side, 3 minutes second side. It was melt in your mouth tender. For the wasabi dressing, we put in the extra wasabi and extra green onions with a 50/50 sour cream/mayo mixture. It was better than we even expected.

Simple and delicous. I followed others and cut the mayo w/ s.cream and thinned it a little further with milk. Also w/ the addition of ginger/garlic. Served with miso buttered green beans and an ume plum cucumber relish, over udon noodles. All of the leftover components made for a tasty pasta salad the next day!

A big hit in our kitchen. I did cut the mayo in half and add lite sour cream instead, as suggested... (I also rarely cook tuna for more than 3 mins per side, especially if it's a good cut.) We will definitely make this again.

I don't even like tuna, and thought this recipe was great! I doubled the wasabi as suggested, but did not cut with sour cream as I had none on hand. Quick, very easy and delicious. Hubby had the leftover steak with sauce on a sandwich the next day....he added bleu cheese and said it was fantastic. Will definately make again!

Wonderful dish! Did add a bit of fresh ginger to teriyaki mixture. As for sauce, I had to use sweet white onion in place of green. Also combined mayo and sour cream as other had done. This dish is easy and oh so good. Looking forward to making again soon.

Wonderful summer dish! I've added horeseradish when I haven't had wasabi paste (decent substitution) and I always add about a tbsp of lemon juice and cut the mayo with fat-free sour cream. For the tuna, I typically add about 2 tsp of toasted sesame oil. Make sure the oil is TOASTED not just the plain stuff! Enjoy!

This was a very easy and delicious way to make tuna steaks. I served the steaks with steamed snow peas and rice. Following the advice of some of the other reviewers, I cut the mayonnaise in half, added sour cream and doubled the wasabi. The sauce would also be very good with grilled salmon or on roast beef sandwiches.

I had previously marinated my tuna in Olive oil with salt and pepper while I found I recipe I added. Then added the marinate and it turned out delicious. Not so lucky with the mayonaise..I didn't have green onions so made a shallot substitution which was awful. Added capers to try and bring it back, but it went from a bad idea to worse.

Great, simple recipe. I used about 2 tsp. of wasabi paste, 2 whole green onions, diced (read it wrong), then, after tasting it, added about 1 Tbs. of soy sauce to the mayo (it was too boring without it). I thought I had rice vinegar but didn't and used apple cider vinegar w/ fine results. Instead of grilling I seared it on the cooktop until just barely cooked thru. Really good w/ Trader Joe's Soyaki Pineapple Teriyaki sauce as the marinade base.

I made this dish last night for myself and my boyfriend... the butcher, who had never had fresh tuna before. He loved it. He didn't care for the mayonnaise. I loved it. I did add some fresh grated ginger to the marinade. And I used half sour cream and half mayo for the mayonnaise. I found the texture perfect. I'm a personal chef and you can bet this one will be on my customer's menus soon!

Fabulous - we used sashimi grade tuna grilled 2 minutes/side and a gyoza dipping sauce in place of the teriyaki (none on hand!); doubled the wasabi and drizzled along with a commercial wasabi lime mustard (absolutely horrible on its own but a great addition). Served with jasmine rice, a radish salad with lemon and mirin dressing with diced pickled ginger and an inexpensive white Catalunya (a Spanish white).

I was unable to grill this, so the marinade (although I used it) added little. The wasabi mix was great, although the mayo taste was a little off-putting. Maybe use plain yogurt or even sour cream as a substitute. I used twice the amount of wasabi and would use even more next time! Overall, quick and easy and yummy.

Rating: 4
I used tuna from a fresh fish market, and I think that made all the difference. I cooked it rare with the edges just browned and the center barely warm. I added about a tablespoon of freshly ground ginger and two teaspoons of minced garlic to the marinade, a magnificent addition! I served the tuna over watercress with snow peas on the side. We had a pinot noir that matched up pretty well, but was a little outdone by the wasabi. Something like a martini would probably be a better choice.

Rating: 4
This is way too tasty for something that requires so little effort. I've made this twice now and have loved it both times. Very minor changes: I pan sear the tuna in a little sesame and peanut oil, and I make extra marinade. Especially good with a very cold martini.

This was a big hit at our house tonight, even with my seven-year-old son. The quick marinade adds great flavor and the wasabi-green onion mayonnaise was superb and also went with the roasted asparagus I served alongside. Only change I made was was shortening the cooking time, as we like our tuna a bit more on the rare side. About 2 or 3 minutes per side.

Rating: 4
Delicious and easy. I did the tuna on my George Forman grill for exactly two minutes (lid closed) and they were done perfectly. Seared, but pink inside. Also, I added at least another teaspoon of wasabi because I like things hot... I recommend adding the original amount and then increasing the wasabi to taste.

Made this today, but screwed it up big time, for the wasabi green onion mayoaise, I added the soy sauce, and lacking teriyaki, added some hoisin sauce and a dash of rice win vinegar along with a dash of sesame oil. It was fantastic. I seared the tuna very lightly on the grill and put the sauce on it. A wonderful rendition of seared tuna!!!

This dish was quick and easy. I seared the tuna for 2 min. a side which was a little too long for me. Reddish-pink on the inside. The wasabi mayo wasn't the perfect match for me although I did enjoy it. Overall, not a bad recipie. P.S. I pan seared the tuna instead of grill.

Wasn't bad but I think there are better ahi preparations out there that showcase the fish more. The mayo just wasn't our thing on fresh ahi. Would highly recommend the the tuna preparation in the recipe "CAESAR SALAD WITH PEPPER-GRILLED TUNA" on this site.

I was born and raised in Hawaii so I love ahi grilled rare. I make my own teriyaki sauce, ao I cut it with the soy sauce and rice vinegar as called for in the recipe and marinated my steaks for 30 minutes. Grilled it rare as we all like it, including our guests. Since we're at that "certain age" we watch our calorie and fat intake, so I made the wasabi sauce with 1/3 mayonnaise and 2/3 non-fat sour cream. This might solve some of the reviewers questions on the richness of the sauce. I used just a little on each steak anyway - it's just a condiment to compliment the marinated tuna.

Rating: 2
Way too heavy on the mayo, even after I added about 3 times as much wasabi as called for I was never able to get rid of that heavy gloppy mayo taste. It totally dominated the sauce. I might try this using creme fraiche or whipped cream with just a dab of mayo.

Rating: 3
Love the mainade and won't hesitate to make this dish again, but didn't like the wasabi-green onion mayonnaise - it was just too rich. Next time for the sauce, I'd probably substitute a half cup of whipped cream (no sugar added) for half of the mayo called for. Use the finest quality wasabi you can find - it's important.

Rating: 3
As many of the others suggested, I added more wasabi which it definitely needed. But just a word of warning, be careful not to add too much, I put about 2.5-3x the recommended amount and it was overwhelming which is a shame if you have a good cut of fish.

I've made this twice and we've loved it both times. The second time, I made the mayo from scratch and should have been more generous with the wasabi and less with the onions.

If seared tuna (rare!) is what you are after, beware of the cooking times. 4 minutes per side is much too long. I think 2 per side would be better. The wasabi mayo is yummy ... definitely add more wasabi if you like the heat (especially if you overcook the tuna!)

What an easy and delicious recipe! I didn't have wasabi, so I used a combination of horseradish and hot sauce. Not quite the same (it didn't clear the sinuses!), but I think that the same idea was there. The wasabi is definitely a better choice. My husband told me he was neutral on the recipe, but with him, if it isn't "northern Italian" anything, he's neutral. But he ate everything! So I think he liked it. I, on the other hand, loved it! It's a definite keeper!
