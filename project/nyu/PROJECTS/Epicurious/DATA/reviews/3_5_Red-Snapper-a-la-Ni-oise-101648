My husband gave it a"C" grade; mine might be a "B". It was okay, but not worth the effort.

I found this to be a rich and flavorful way to serve fish. I have served this twice so far and my guests have loved it. A nice hearty fish dish. The fennel is a great touch.

This was wonderful! We don't like fennel so I substituted leeks instead. I was able to make it ahead and keep it covered in the fridge. Really a nice way to serve fish.

This is dish I have made regularly for several years, varying the fish depending on where I am preparing it. At home in Boston or San Francisco, I use snapper or roughy, in Paris and Vaison-la-Romain, I use rouget. I have even made it in Idaho, using freshly caught trout and supermarket zucchini because I couldn't get fennel and chopped canned tomatoes. I had brought capers, anchovies and something I never leave home without - fennel pollen! The dish came out lovely and my "meat and potatoes" rancher in-laws-to-be were suitably impressed. I served it with hot orzo,dressed with lemon juice and sundried tomatoes and a little of the oil from the jar they came in (brought those with me too!) They decided I was a keeper!

Flat. we could not taste the wonderful anchovies, olives and capers. The fenel had a great aroma while coking but was practically tasteless.

I thought this dish was awesome. Such a totally Provencale flavour. I halved the recipe, used a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes instead of the fresh and just regular black, pitted olives instead of the nicoise with cod fillets. I omitted the parsley (too lazy to go down to the garden to get some) and only dissolved some chicken OXO for the broth. It was still beautiful. The garlic and anchovies account for a total explosion of flavour. I will definitely make this dish again and again.

This recipe was very tasty. I used tilipia instead of red snapper and it was delicious. I thought the anchovies would be a strong taste, but they weren't. The flavors were great and I would certainly make it again. Next time with red snapper. It would also be good with boneless chicken.

A bit time-consuming, perhaps, but well worth it (especially for fish fans). This dish is a taste explosion, with clear, distinct flavors that do not overpower. For more of a kick, more anchovies may be in order. Saves well for left-overs.
