I haven't tried this yet, but I would like to say to the reviewer swinny333: The recipe does say to oil the pan (9 inch) and line it with parchment.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was very tasty. I made a very large batch. I found it best to bake it on parchment paper. I will certainly make them again.

This is very tasty but I was not able to get it out of the pan without a crab hammer. It is granola for me also. I think my pampered chef pan will have to be thrown out since it is stuck to it & I can not remove it. I will let it sit overnight and see how it is tomorrow. I think the recipe should state what size pan and should it have breen sprayed w/pam on it before mixture was applied..

It was great as granola but did not stick together to make a bar.
