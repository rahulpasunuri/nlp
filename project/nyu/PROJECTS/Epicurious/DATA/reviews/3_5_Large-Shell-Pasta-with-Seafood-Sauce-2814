Such an easy dish to make but the result is almost gourmet-like. We enjoy seafood very much so we add 2 lbs of shrimp. The sauce does come out a bit watery but the addition of some tomato paste helps thicken it up. I also add some white wine to the sauce. I personally prefer this over rice instead of the paste. Currently I'm on a health kick so I might even try it over quinoa.

With a few adjustments, this has become a family favorite. I use Linguine instead of shells and use dried oregano instead of basil. Oregano complements seafood better than basil. I always add more clams and shrimp than the recipe calls for.

This was incredibly easy. I used penne pasta. I found it rather uninteresting - a little too fishy tasting. If I do make it again ( it is quick) I think I'll leave out the clams and use more shrimp - maybe the baby clams I used had a too strong flavor.

This is delicious and easy. I'm making it for the 2nd time tonight. Even if you're cooking for people that think they hate anchovies, don't leave out the anchovy paste. No one will know it's in there, and that's what gives it a kind of sharp pleasant taste. I highly recommend it.

I didn't like how it turned out with the shells, so the second time I made it with rice instead. What a difference! It was incredibly delicious! I have also substituted frozen seafood instead of the shrimp, to add some variety. I love this dish!

I made it exactly as the recipe was written, but with a few minor alterations, this would rate three forks. Replace shredded fresh basil with the dried, add a few tablespoons of tomato paste and a splash of dry white wine. Quite good as is but lacks a bit of flavour depth and complexity.

Unlike the previous reviewer I thought this was a very good dish. I did not have the clams so I doubled the shrimp and added some chicken stock and white wine. A very quick good meal for unexpected guests. I will make it again.

I wasted some perfectly good shrimp on this recipe! The tomatoes, shrimp and juices were watery with very little flavor. I will not make this again. I should say something positive: it was easy to make.

Sooo very delicious!!! First dish I've ever attempted to cook and it came out perfectly. So flavorful still although I left out the red chili peppers(can't eat hot stuff). My fiancee absolutely loved it! Changed his mind that I can't cook =)

This dish is "instant gourmet!" I use linguini and uncooked frozen shrimp. Since it is already peeled and deveined, I have this on the table in 30 minutes to rave reviews from the whole family.

Loved it. Loved it. Loved it. The only modification I had was using Orzo instead of shell pasta (it's the only pasta my daughter likes). It was wonderful. A real keeper!

Easy and delicious! I followed the exact recipe and found the flavor and spice to be just right. My children (ages 3 & 6) enjoyed it too.

Very easy and quick recipe with sophisticated flavor and presence. I do not recommend this dish for young children because it is spicy. I did use the reserved clam juice and it came out nicely.

This is a wonderful dish. I changed the recipe slightly... I first sauted cut up fresh aspargus which I added in the end and I used 1 pound fettuccine and 1 pound shrimp in place of the given amount. I would serve this to company,

Wonderful recipe that's fast and easy (under 30 minutes)! Has a nice kick but now overly spicy. Great for feeding to company or just the family. I did not use the reserved clam juice for there would be too much liquid. Also, depending on the appitites, this could feed 5-6 people
