These were delish! I improvised by adding basil, fresh ground pepper and salt to season the tomatoes along with the olive oil. I roasted them in a 250-275 degree oven for about 3 hours. My husband and I enjoyed them over hamburger and underneath cheese tortellini. My husband is a chef and he was really impressed!

To the cook from Encino, I agree, the similar Gourmet recipe is better -- it is here on the Epicurious website, under "Slow Roasted Tomatoes." The recipes are similar, although the lower temperature and longer cooking time of the Gourmet recipe really makes a difference in making that recipe superior.

These were delicious - slightly sweet. We all loved them. Next time, I'm tripling the recipe.

there was a better recipe in gourmet that is not on website. it adds garlic to the olive oil and you roast the tomatoes for 6 hours at 275-300. The are delicious and worth the time. Delicious on toasted baguette with a shaving of parmesean cheese, dash of salt and pepper. Or in a sandwich with proscuitto and provolone.

This a great and easy side dish. Sprinking marjoram adds a very nice flavor also.

Make it easy - put tomatoes in a plastic bag, along with oil, herbs, salt and pepper. Then just jiggle the bag and arange on a platter to put in the oven.
