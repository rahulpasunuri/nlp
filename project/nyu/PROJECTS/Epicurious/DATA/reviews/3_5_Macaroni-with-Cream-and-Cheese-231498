I really liked the recipe as it is. However, because the poblanos are roasted, the pasta has an overall mushy, soggy consistency (even with the pasta cooked al dente). That was the one thing my boyfriend and I didn't like about the dish. I definitely liked the flavor and I loved the creme fraiche sauce. I used the same process to make artichoke ravioli that I bought from Trader Joes. I sauteed shallots, asparagus tips, and sun dried tomatoes in the butter (instead of peppers and onions). It was delicious. Note: I had to use two 9 oz packages of ravioli to get the sauce to pasta ratio to come out OK.

We just felt that the pasta needed a little more flavor. It was intresting to use sour cream but even with the queso fresco it was lacking in a strong flavor. As for spicey we didnt think it was a very spicey dish although some crushed red peppers might help this dish in the flavor department. Overall we were disappointed with this dish.

This was a four forker for me personally--what a great change from creamy italian flavored pastas! And also a great alternative to rice and beans as a Mexican side. But I would not serve this to unadventurous company. I reduced the serrano by half and the dish was still really spicy, because even the mild poblanos in this high a proportion build up in terms of heat as you eat it.

Yummy! I added a cup of sharp cheddar in addition to the feta and used elbow macaroni. The recipe calls for 6oz. of pasta which is probably an error. I used 1lb.

Fantastic recipe. I forgot the serrano peppers while I was at the market but found the poblanos quite spicy enough for me. Also, I was able to procure the crema and queso fresca and found them worth the effort; the crema texture is less viscous than sour cream and the queso is incredibly mild.

Yum!!!!! Loved this recipe.................I followed on reviewer's comments and chopped my onion and poblano peppers....used whole wheat pasta...I did use full fat sour cream for my first try, but will go with low fat next time.....Was surprised at how good it was.

This is a good recipe and stands on its own as a vegetarian meal. Next time, I will probably add smoked chicken as it would be a nice addition to the dish.

That's a keeper in our house - although without meat, which means a lot for my husband. Besides roasting the poblanos it's very quick fixed as well. I might do that next time while something else is baking in the oven anyway. Feta cheese worked fine for us and sour cream instead of crema or creme fraiche.

Great dish and easy. Next time in will chop the onions and poblano chiles instead of leaving them in strips. Also I will add 1 minced serrano chile instead of just 1 teaspoon.
