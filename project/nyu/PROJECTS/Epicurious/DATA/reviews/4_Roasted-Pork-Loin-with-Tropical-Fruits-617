This is a great recipe. I've tried it twice for dinner guests and everyone enjoyed it! I agree with others regarding the pineapple.

Awesome recipe esp with the added pineapple as suggested. All my guests have loved it and its foolproof. Not as much work as I thought & with everything made in advance, saves time on the day.

Made this for a party and everyone loved it. Definetly worth trying. I thought it might be too sweet but the fruit just gave it a hint of sweetness.

I made this for my island theme dinner party. It didn't take as long as I thought to roast, so I ended up getting the temp a little high (180 or so) but it was great anyway.

I broke with the old adage of "never try out a new recipe at a dinner party". I'm glad I did. Everyone loved this dish. It does take some preparation the day before but that actually makes it much easier the day of the party. I was skeptical about the fruit until I added the mango and papaya. It gave it color and flavor. I will definitely make this again.

I served this dish at a dinner party and it received rave reviews. I accompanied it with cooked mixed greens and garlic mashed potatoes. Everyone was very happy. I would definitely make this one again.

I made this for a party of 12 and it was a big hit! I served it with roasted winter vegetables that went very well. Everyone was very impressed!

This recipe has quickly become a favorite in our house. We served it at a party and it was a huge hit. I've also made a smaller portion (to serve just 2 people w/leftovers) and found it worked as well.

I ended up using a bone-in pork loin but it worked just as well. It was very rare in the middle but that was OK as that part was reheated the following day. The fruit mixture is delicious and the meat very tender and moist. The family liked this one.

This is a terrific recipe, I made it for a party of 25 and it did very well extended for a large roast, everybody loved it. I added a couple of teasp. of cider vinegar to the filling for a bit of balance and it hit just the right note. I think I would grind the pepper next time, though.

Want to wow your guests, then try this recipe!! Yes it takes a little prep work but everything is done the day before which is good. I made this for my mom's birthday dinner and my relatives would always make jokes about my cooking but no more! A fantastic combination of flavors! I served this with a mashed potato souffle, garlic string beans and bananas foster for dessert!

I recently made this dish for a "hawaiian" theme dinner party and it was a hit. The pork was so tender that you could cut it with a fork. I was worried that the fruit would be overpowering however it complimented the pork very nicely. Next time I make this dish, I will add fresh pineapple to the fruit medley.

Made this for a dinner party and so pleased I came up with simpler version for just me and my husband. Using a pork tenderloin, reduce the marinade ingredients proportionately. I just browned the tenderloin, and poured the dried fruit and sherry mixture over the top and baked covered with foil (remove cinnamon stick). Instead of the tropical fruits, I cut up a ripe pear into the pan with the other fruits while the meat rested. Warmed it through and topped the meat. It's now our favorite. FABULOUS!

I really enjoyed this recipe but since my husband who is a very picky eater with rather plain tastes didn't particularly care for it, I will probably not make it again. Did serve it for company & everyone else loved it. I substituted golden raisins for the prunes & they plumped up nicely in the marinade to the size of small grapes & added a nice round shape in contrast to the other cut up fruit.

Absolutely mouth-watering. Just before I was to put the pork in the oven, my oven starter broke! But I salvaged the meal by pouring half water and half sherry in the Dutch oven I'd browned the roast in, and then braised it on the range. The flavors just explode in your mouth and, if you're lucky enough to have leftovers, be sure to store the pork in the leftover sauce. The next day, the moistness of the meat is beyond compare!

This takes a bit of preparation, but it is well worth the effort.

We entertained this weekend with 8 guests. The pork loin was exquisite. I would've thought the onion would have been overbearing, but the flavors melded together wonderfully. Accompanying the dish was roasted butternut squash soup and garlic mashed potatoes. Tremendous!!!
