Amazing. Very easy to make, elegant appetizer. I used as an amuse bouche for our last dinner party on crackers. My husband thought serving raw fish was a risk, but all of the guests loved it! Recipe makes a lot, I made 30 pieces with about 3-4 oz. left over so I could have made about another dozen. I still have about 3 oz of sauce left too.

FABULOUS!We bought a piece of Copper River and loved, loved, loved this recipe. My husband says all salmon must use this sauce. I put it on some crustini with a few capers and chopped red onion in addition to the sauce and dill and we are most happy.

I do have to wonder...who's idea was it to put coriander in here? Made a similar recipe tonight, sans coriander, but with orange zest. Will try the mustard sauce. Coriander?!

Excellent recipe and super easy just as it is. I've made this with both farm-raised atlantic salmon and wild alaskan sockeye salmon. Both are good, but the wild sockeye salmon was, by far, superior in taste and texture. This recipe is a keeper!

Good Gravlax. I added a tablespoon of Vodka to the mix. I would suggest at least 48 hrs preferably 72 curing and do not omit the sauce. I didnt have honey mustard on hand so I used Dijon and added a tablespoon of honey.

Perfect recipe for gravlax and the sauce. Following advice, I also used 2 tbsps vodka as marinade: as I have not made it without vodka I cannot tell if this made a difference or not. I used organic salmon, and it was both firm and tender, getting raves from the 14 people at the dinner.

This was a wonderful dish. It was easy to make and the recipe, as is, was perfect. I got rave reviews. I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe - I doused the fish with about a cup of Pernod (anise flavored spirit) before refrigerating. It gave the fish a fragrant, lightly licorice flavor.

This is a great recipe. Thank you! Here is a video that is pretty funny and worth watching. It is on being in the kitchen... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8lkQv4sfFQ

This is an excellent recipe. The coriander gives it another twist. I agree that poking holes in the skin is not necessary. I usually get a 2 1/2 lb fillet and use the 2 thickest 1 lb pieces and place them skin down - spices - skin up in the dish. Note that you should rotate the whole package from top to bottom once a day so the fillets get exposed to the liquid that forms. Adding 1/4 cup of gin or vodka or for that matter aquavit makes it even more interesting. Using whisky or brandy works well too. Wild caught salmon taste even better but I found it is more difficult to slice.

Another sauce that goes well is Semi whipped cream with granulated Dijon mustard.

This was my first attempt at curing my own fish. I did it once with store-bought fish and it was really good. I would definitely recommend scraping as much of the seasoning off as possible before cutting and serving (there will still be plenty that won't come off). I tried it a second time with salmon that I caught myself and it was even better.

This turned out really well. I made too much and froze the leftovers to use for Christmas appetizers. Still really good!

Looks relatively authentic, but a few tweaks: number one, don't poke holes in your salmon. The cure will work regardless, but you should turn the fish, basting with accumulated juices, every 12 hours. Oh, and FYI: "gravlax" is not pronounced to rhyme with "relax" -- it's a long A, more like "lox."

Sit back and relax with your gravlax.

Simple and excellent result. One thing: Be sure to use coarse salt so it's easier to brush them off after 2~3 days of curing.

This is great, authentic recipe for Swedish gravlax, and the sauce is awesome!! Only one thing, omit the coranderseeds!
