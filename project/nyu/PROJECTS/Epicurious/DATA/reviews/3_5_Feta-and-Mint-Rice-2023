With the addition of sliced zucchini, fresh from the garden, lightly sautéed in Persian lime olive oil, this rice dish was perfection. Girl and boy, ages five and six, devoured it. We served it with BBQ chicken. A light and lovely summer meal. This is going to be popular!

yum! instead of rice and chicken broth, i used boxed Uncle Ben's Long Grain & Wild Rice. I added the sauteed onions with the cheese and mint after the rice was cooked.

This rice was divine. Simple and flavourful at the same time. I added some chopped, fresh parsley too as I had it on hand. Use good feta.

This is super simple and flavorful. It's quickly becoming a go-to staple. We love it because it accompanies a variety of dishes from beef to fish. Since it's the peak of summer and basil and mint are plentiful, we've used both and find both to be tasty.

Wonderful -- savory and refreshing! I've made this three times since discovering the recipe last month. I followed the recipe exactly, though I may have been more generous with the feta and the mint at the end. I used a very, very good sheep's milk feta and the mint from my garden. I've found it to be fabulous with veggie kabobs, no matter what else I'm serving, as I've had it with lamb, chicken and beef kabobs as well as steak and shrimp. I've learned to make a big batch and enjoy it over the week.

I just tried it with mint and it's pretty vile for my taste. I'll stick to my basil sub for life!

Wanted to use some feta, and there is mint coming up everywhere in the garden. I used brown rice but put way too much water due to experience with brown rice so had to boil some off. Still, very good. Made about 4 servings.

It's a staple BUT I swap basil for mint. Delicious with goat's cheese, too. I make with brown rice so it's extra nutty. My fav detox food!

This was unbelievably simple and unbelievably yummy. Think it would be a perfect accompaniement with fish (among other things).

My partner and I very much enjoyed this dish. I made it with the Greek Style Shrimp, pretty much doubling the feta and mint in the rice and making the shrimp with tomato sauce and lots of wine. As one reviewer of the Greek Style shrimp said, this recipe has strong flavors and is probably only for people who have adventurous tastes.

Very simple and very tasty. Could use more mint--will probably double it next time.

I gave this a poor review 2/03 but I tried again, increasing the mint, feta, and onion, and it was quite good. Next time I will double the mint. The review says this serves two but I made 50% again as much for three of us and could have fed an army.

A very good and simple rice dish. I add a bit more feta than called for. Great side dish for sauteed or grilled shrimp.

Simple and very tasty. And you can of course vary the flavour by using different types of feta. I had it with goat's cheese feta and I served it with dolmades with minced lamb and tzatziki. Awfully good!

This is a staple in our house -- with grilled salmon, lamb and chicken. I'm more generous with the feta (go with Greek, not domestic -- more flavor, less salt) and use organic chicken broth instead of the canned for much better flavor.

As the other reviews indicated I couldn't imagine the mint either...till I tasted it! This is so goooood. It definitely has a Mediterranean feel. If you like simple but exotic stuff, this is it.

This was pretty good, nothing quite too special though. I was also unsure of the mint addition but I thought it was a nice combination along with the feta.

This is nice enough, bland but more interesting than plain rice.

This is a delicious recipe that I have made more than once. The feta gives the rice a wonderful kind of creamy texture and the mint is surprisingly great and adds a bit of zip. I served it with the Phyllo Wrapped Salmon and Oven Roasted Asparagus with Balsamic Vinegar. Yummy!!

I love rice, but I have to admit I was a little unsure of putting mint in rice. It was wonderful! I made it with the grilled lamb and the spinach/feta torte. It was very unique and very delicious.

I am usually not a big fan of rice, but this recipe is terrific!! I used basmati rice which added a nice nutty flavour.

A pleasant surprise for my guests! They just loved it as I did and easy to make. Fantastic!

I served this with the Grilled Butterflied Leg of Lamb with Lemon, Herbs, and Garlic, and it was fantastic! Far superior to any other rice or potato side dish. I wouldn't change a thing!

Excellent with lamb! I think the serving size is a bit overdone...the original would serve 4 easily as a side dish. I doubled it and have some great leftovers now. I used fresh basil rather than the mint and really liked it.

I've made this recipe for years. It's so simple and gets gobbled up -- even by people who say they don't like rice. It's great with lamb, too.

Rice was very good--terrific mix of flavors. Was a little strong with the Greek-Style shrimp--I'll probably try with lamb or chicken next time.
