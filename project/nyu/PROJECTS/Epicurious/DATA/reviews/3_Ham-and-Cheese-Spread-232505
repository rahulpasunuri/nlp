I didn't have Gruyere, so I replaced with Beemster Classic (aged Gouda) and it was fantastic. Like the other reviewer, I also added more mustard to kick up the flavor. Plan to try with regular gherkins which have a more sweet-sour flavor than the French ones.

I made this as written, tasted tested it, and found it to be a little bland and dry. I doubled the mustard and cornichons, ran it through the food processor and it was fantastic! Served it with both baguette slices and crackers and it was better on the bread.

Not bad. A little dry. I used the food processor also.

I love this recipe, but process all ingredients in the food processor to make a smoother texture.

Really nice. I used only 1 Tbsp of butter in order to end up with something more like a ham salad.
