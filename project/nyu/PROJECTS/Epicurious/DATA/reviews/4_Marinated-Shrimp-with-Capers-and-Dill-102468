My favorite recipe to bring to holiday parties. I always get compliments and requests for the recipe. 2 tbsp of oil for saute, 4 tbsp for the marinade. I also reduce the dill to 1 tbsp and add 1 tbsp of fresh cilantro. Perfect balance. If you mince the garlic finely (which is what minced means) it reduces it's powerful flavor and helps it blend better. I haven't found the need to rinse the capers personally. If your pan won't accommodate the entire amount of shrimp in a single layer, then cook it in smaller batches. Better to cook the shrimp on the underdone side as it does continue to "cook" in the marinade. I've made this recipe countless times and have never failed to get compliments.

This is a stand by for me. I've made it so many times that I can't count. It always gets those mouthwatering compliments one hopes for at any festive gathering. Cheers!

We made this recipe using giant jumbo shrimp fresh from the gulf coast. I have to say that the smell of the marinade put me off a bit, and first tastes did not give encouragement either, but after sitting in the marinade all day the shrimp turned out pretty well. I thought the flavors were strong on the shrimp and have to say that a large, large and fresh shrimp is ideal for enough of the shrimp flavor to remain and come through at all. I did saute the shrimp with the chopped garlic, and that smell alone was to die for! So for me the ify marinade was a gamble. Doubt this will ever get made again, but it was nice and different enough for Christmas Eve.

Well, the recipe is easy enough. I enjoyed being able to prep ahead of time (marinated overnight) but I was sorely disappointed with the outcome. Too salty, too rich. Noone ate it at all. A complete waste, I'm afraid. I would not recommend this at all.

This recipe is fantastic. We were going to be traveling all day to a cabin in a state park. We were looking for a dish we could make in advance, chill for at least several hours and eat cold that evening. This dish was simple to prepare, easy to pack, and the fresh flavors were delicious and refreshing at the end of a long day. With a nice chilled riesling, we had a truly gourmet experience.

I made this for a catering event back this summer (just now remembering to do the review) and it was a HUGE hit. Now it is one of my most requested items.

Was disappointed by this dish - the marinade is just not appealing and overpowers the shrimp. Maybe use the marinade as a dressing instead and turn this into a salad?

The best. I have been making in for years and always someone ask for the receipe. Easy and can be done ahead which I like. The hardest part is cleaning the shrimp and that is a no brainer.

As good as all the reviews say. I used it as a main course salad for 2. I rinsed the capers, used 2T to saute shrimp; 6T for marinade - but only 1 pound shrimp. I added boiled potatoes.

An easy, elegant dish.

EZ and all my favorite on hand ingredients. I used a LOT less olive oil than the recipe called for and I thought it tasted good and tangy. I cut some slices of Garlic French Bread and toasted it in the oven at 350 until browned with butter and a bit of parmesan cheese on them. It was the perfect accompaniment with the Shrimp and a glass of Savignon Blanc. Definitely a keeper! Will Do again.

I loved this and thought it was fine even with cooked shrimp. I love it mixed with marinated artichokes.

This dish is VERY similar to what I call Pickled shrimp which has been a mainstay for our cocktail parties for years. Serve just as it is in a shell shaped bowl and it disappears! It beats steamed shrimp hands down.

Very, very interesting flavor. As suggested by others, I used far less oil than the recipe called for. That seems to be the ticket. Also, instead of serving on a bed of lettuce, I tossed the shrimp with arugula prior to plating. Great summer dish. Will definitely make it over and over again.

It seems like this would have been a fantastic recipe, but we found the raw garlic harsh and overpowering (and we love garlic)! I will try it again, but I will cook the garlic with the shrimp.

Very easy to make and seems to impress guests! I found it a bit tart for my taste - perhaps the capers were too salty - so I will rinse the capers next time as suggested by a previous reviewer.

This marinate worked well on frozen (thawed) pre-cooked shrimp, without the need to saute. Guests really liked the lemony flavor. Would definitely make it again. Maybe add some avocado or other veggie to the salad, too.

I prefer sweet recipes for shrimp, but this savoury recipe was gobbled up by my dinner guests in no time flat! What I liked is that the flavour is super-impressive, yet the recipe is simple. I would have to rate this dish highly mostly because my guests enjoyed it. However, I still prefer sweet coriander recipes for shrimp.

I made this a second time and cut the oil in half (used the 2T called for to saute the shrimp, but then just 3T in the marinade) and it came out great! I would definitely do this again.

Rating: 4
Resounding yes on this one! The flavors are just ON. I used about 3/4 the oil called for, and I think you could probably get away with even less, so next time I make it I'll probably use half the oil called for.

I can't say anything about this recipe that hasn't already been noted. This recipe just works, plain and simple. The dressing is also delicious on its own.

I made this for a cocktail party and it was the first dish that disappeared. It's amazing how delcious this is given how easy it is to prepare. I passed the recipe on to several of my guests at their request.

As I was planning my holiday party, my boyfriend asked, "Can you make that shrimp dish again?" I've now made this for a summer and a winter party - it's fantastic for both.

Great recipe. I served it as an appetizer. The only thing I would differently next time is reduce the sauteeing time for the shrimp . They were a little too firm because the lemon juice continues to 'cook' them.

This is as good as the other reviews say. I added an eighth of a teaspoon of ground red pepper and served it over pasta shells with a side of poblano pepper stuffed with sundried tomato and black olive hummas and drank a white from the Loire Valley (Quicy AC)

Phenomenal recipe--rates as the highest ratio of guests who requested the recipe to those invited ever! Made it exactly as written, despite rather dramatic amounts of some ingredients, and the balance was perfect. Can't recommend it enough!

I love this recipe! It's such a nice way to serve shrimp, as oppose to shrimp cocktail. It is very flavorful and always a crowd pleaser. It is one of my favorites.

I had dinner this weekend with friends. The hostess made this as an appetizer. How very wonderful! Delightfully, the sauce clung to the shrimp. Every shrimp was eaten as well as the sauce.

This totally deserves its 4 forks, 100% make again rating. My husband doesn't care for capers but nevertheless thought this was one of the best salads he ever tasted. Our guests loved it. Yummy and because it's prepared in advance, it's great for entertaining. A definite keeper, and no need to tinker with it at all!

Not a big fan of raw garlic so I cooked it with the shrimp. Also, raw broccoli makes a good addition to the salad since it holds the sauce. Leftovers will go quickly!

This appetizer is very good. I don't salt the shrimp before cooking because it's too salty with having capers and mustard. I also rinse the capers to cut down on the salt. I really like salt, but it's just too much. Everyone loves this dish.
