A nice change up from the classic Enchilada! I will make again, but I will use the full can of crushed tomatoes (seemed to be stretching the the sauce and there was about a 3/4 cup left), I also only used 1/2 the sour cream none on top ( just in the Enchilada) & used about 4oc of pepper jack graded instead. OH and i added 1/2 tsp of Chipotle powder for a lill more kick.

Is there a typo in the recipe? How do you start with 2 cups of crushed tomatoes, add some onions and garlic, and end up with 3 cups of sauce for the filling, another 1/2 cup for the bottom of the dish, and enough to pour over the top?!?!? Still, we're in the process of making this now, and it looks like it will turn out yummy, as the filling and sauce are very good so far.

This was delicious! What an interesting and unusual riff on the same old enchilada theme. We made these as written using half of a roast chicken that was leftover from the grill. We liked the fact that there was no cheese in this. Wonderful!!!

Definitely a keeper. I made it exactly as the recipt says. My teenager guest asked his mom to make this dish for him at home!! My hubby was surprised by the well balance of the olive and rasins.

This is a really delicious recipe, and not your typical enchiladas. I made the recipe exactly as specified and found it easy, tasty, and the perfect amount for two people plus leftovers. One thing I especially liked was that I could make it hours ahead of dinner, refrigerate it, and then pop it in the oven when we were ready to eat. Perhaps not the quickest recipe ever, but worth it for the unique flavors and back-end convenience.

It is a keeper for us. We added more tomatoes than suggested and even have used leftover tomato sauce or salsa to add to the sauce. We skipped softening the tortillas and have used low fat yogurt rather than sour cream and have sprinkled with cheese. The olives and raisins are what make this dish different and tasty.

This was pretty darn good. I used a can of fire-roasted tomates, which I whizzed in the food processor. I used a combination ancho chile powder and a little chipotle powder in place of the "generic" chile powder. Also, we are watching our carbs, so I stuffed roasted peeled poblanos instead of tortillas. Topped with a little cheese, baked, and served the warm sauce on a plate, topped with a stuffed pepper. I will make these again. With the small changes I made to the sauce it was a standout!

I agree that this recipe is not that quick to prepare however it supplied a few nights of leftovers which were even better. The dish is a bit different than usual enchilada recipes and I enjoyed it. I omitted the raisins and sour cream and used tomato sauce instead of crushed. I also used more olives and thier juice than recommended.

These were in the "Too Busy to Cook" section but were not as simple as promised. They were OK, nothing special.

I made this as a layered Enchiladas rather than rolling up individually. It saved a lot of time, and it made more sense since this suppose to be an easy recipe. Those olives gave nice saltiness and texture. The best part of this meal was the left over for me. I served fried eggs on the left over Enchiladas with diced avocado. Its like making Huevos Rancheros in no time.
