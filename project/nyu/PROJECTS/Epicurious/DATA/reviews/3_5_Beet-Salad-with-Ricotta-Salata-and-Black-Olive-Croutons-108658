This was excellent. I was a bit nervous about all the competing flavors, but they worked out great!

I made this salad this winter while looking for a change of pace - WOW! Very intense! I had to use regular beets, not baby beets, and it was still delicious. I made mine with arugula and for those of you who live where there is a Whole Foods, you can usually get ricotta salata there.

Roasting the beets is a must. Used gorgonzola instead of the ricotta. The dressing was my favorite part. Overall, a good, flavor intense salad.

I agree. This was quite tastey, especially now that baby beets are in season here. The croutons and the vinaigrette were a nice change. And we enjoyed the ricotta salata which has only recently become available here.

What stood out for me about this recipe was the salad dressing and the tapenade croutons, both made this a new spin on the beet salad. I am making it again for a dinner party this Sunday.
