For those who gave this is a high rating . . . Just remember that all those in your cooking community are depending on you. A 3 to 4 fork rating is not supposed to be just good (a 2 fork) but great, phenomenal. It is a sign to me-- overworked, exhausted mother -- that the 20-30 minutes spent with my son making these cookies is well spent time. Unfortunately it was NOTHING of the sort. My sweets loving husband only ate one, and all the girls at the office avoided them. I myself though I was eating sand half the time. I did double the peanut butter (I was actually wanting to make PB cookies), but otherwise followed the recipe, and I doubt the extra peanut butter is what made them so dry, I literally had to stand over a trash can to eat them. I should have just spared myself and thrown the cookies in the trash to begin with. That begin said, I did find the flavors to be nice and think I might try adding some of the spices to the typical peanut butter cookie. I am also entertaining keeping this recipe around as a crust recipe for a cheesecake. It is dry enough that if baked flat, it might set up for that pretty well.

I take exception to the review that said these cookies were awful. I served these to 40 people last night and got rave reviews. I have made them frequently over the last ten years and never had any problems. I would say that for success, use a walnut-sized ice cream scoop. The flour is the binder in this cookie. The egg wash is cosmetic. Pecans or walnuts work well.

i really liked these cookies, slightly peanut buttery.....the texture was nice a little heavy, but i like that. not too sweet, either.

Maybe because I used natural peanut butter it had too much peanut taste; but he consistency was awful and I threw them out. They sort of stuck to the insides of our mouth and were too crumbly. Do jot waste your time.

Yes, these cookies do crumble - I would not serve them at an elegant affair or eat them in bed. But I give them four forks based on their yummy taste and texture. I also like how easy they are to make and that they're made with oil instead of butter. Great to have with coffee or tea.

These are easy to make and very tasty. Just be careful if you are transporting them...they crumble easily.

Very tasty & very easy. I made these once with walnuts, and once with pecans for my daughter's class party. Amazing that there's no butter or egg in dough; cookies are held together by brushing egg on, so put on plenty. Texture inside is like fine sand. Unusual, and flavor is quite good.

They were pretty good, interesting texture. They crumble easily, watch cooking time
