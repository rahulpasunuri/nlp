it's so fast and easy. My children loooove corndogs and request it often, which I actually don't like to give in to. Worse is the horrible, horrible frozen corn dogs. So, I decided to make it once using good hot dogs. It's fast, easy, and tastes so amazing. Fried foods are not exactly what you should teach your children to eat, but it's a fun once-in-a-while family treat for them! We'll definitely do it again but with hot sausages inside for the adults

Also, we didn't have a deep enough pan for frying so we decided to do this without the skewers, using tongs to whip the corndogs out of the oil when ready. It all worked out and our guests enjoyed the unique flavour. Would recommend for large groups as we

I was initially suspicious, but these turned out wonderfully. We cut our hot dogs in half and shortened the sticks because we weren't sure our pan was big enough to deep fry full-sized ones. We made no other modifications and they were perfect! We could almost hear the carnival rides and music in the background as we bit into them.

Greasy, crumbly and delicious. I used wooden stirrers from Starbucks as I couldn't find popsicle sticks at the market. It's fried. What's not to love?

Marcot64, that's not much of a review. The point of reviewing is to give constructive input for people wanting to try the recipe out. Be pleasant, or be quiet.

haven't tried this recipe nor would I. This is not kid friendly, more like kid hostile. These are the recipes we need to steer kids away from.
