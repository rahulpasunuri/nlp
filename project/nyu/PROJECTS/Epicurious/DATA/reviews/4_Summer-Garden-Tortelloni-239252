Excellent summer recipe. I do cook the tomatoes because I do not like them raw. I have also tried it without the prosciutto because I forgot to buy it and added portobello mushrooms. It was very good. I also use 100% whole wheat Buitoni tortellini. This is a keeper for my summer meals. Very fresh tasting.

A very easy, family-friendly way to use seasonal fresh tomatoes, corn and basil. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

Was surprised at how good this was. Used frozen corn, bacon instead of prosciutto, and baby arugula as my basil was depleted. Seeded good tomatoes so didn't have excess liquid. Also used only 1 Tbls butter and a little chicken stock. Tasted very fresh (even with the frozen corn) and my husband loved it.

This was OK, but not great. I can't imagine using frozen corn - the pop of the fresh kernals cut from the cob contributed both flavor and texture that are essential. We made it exactly as written - fresh basil, fresh tomatoes, prosciutto. The only substitution that seems remotely viable would be to use half butter/half olive oil.

I LOVE THIS!! My boyfriend loves it, anyone I've ever made it for loves it. Perfect just the way it is, no substitutions needed.

Delicious! I thought this recipe sounded a little boring, but tried it anyway. It's really really good, and easy. I highly recommend it, especially when fresh corn is in season..makes a world of difference! Topped it with asiago, and bacon works well if you don't have prosciutto on hand.

Agree that you could reduce the butter. It pools at the bottom of the dish. I did not add the 1/4c cooking water as it wasn't needed. Not really sure why its part of the recipe. Anyway, this recipe tasted good but isn't anything I'd serve to company. More of a family week-night meal. Also, canned corn worked fine. Fresh corn is oo much work for such a basic recipe. If you make your own tortellini, I can see using fresh over canned/frozen.

This is easy and delicious, plus it's a very pretty and colorful dish. I've made it a couple of times, and have varied it with different veggies and more garlic.

My roommates and boyfriend loved this recipe, even when I excluded the prosciutto to make it vegetarian. Next time, all I'd suggest is to cut the basil very finely so that more flavor comes out and you can get some in each bite, instead of a leaf here and there.

I made this with turkey bacon and less butter. I also cooked the chopped tomatoes for a bit with the corn. Loved it. Was great as a pasta salad for lunch at work.

This was very tasty. I substitued Saprassota Salami for the prosciutto and omitted the pasta water. I also added a bit more garlic. I will definitely make this again.

Kids & I did not like the prosciutto in the recipe. We didn't finish it. It would probably be fine for us without the prosciutto, but probably wouldn't make again because of the amount of butter - wasn't good enough to justify that much butter.

This was incredibly easy and so tasty! I cut the butter in half and thought it was just fine.

Really nice and easy blend of fresh tastes. I used turkey bacon instead of prosciutto, and only 2 corn cobs (it was plenty), and halved the butter. Next time I will try extra garlic like others recommended, and maybe a bit more tomatoes (i used relatively small ones). Oh, also I used fresh oregano instead of basil bec that's what I had. Will make again, possibly with artichoke tortelloni-

Delicious, especially with 3 cups of corn and a bit of extra garlic. The fresh tomatoes provided enough juice that I didn't need to add the pasta water.

I would definitely make this again. I used canned corn and it was delicious. I didn't use the cooking water though, and instead added a bit of homemade dressing at the end (oil, vinegar, basil, dijon mustard)

Surprisingly great recipe, if you get fresh ingredients. I suspect that frozen corn and winter tomatoes would not cut it in this dish.

Great summer dinner. Fresh corn and tomatoes, and basil from my garden. I cooked bacon separately so it would be crunchy.

An excellent summer meal, the fresh corn is a must.

I liked it, but the husband wasn't enthused, which unfortunately means I won't be making it again.

This was an easy weeknight dish to prepare. I used fresh corn, lots of basil and bacon in the place of the proscuitto. The bacon gave it a nice smokey flavor.

awesome recipe, I did leave out the prosciutto because I don't care for that but it was still great with out it

I was pleasantly surprised by this dish - especially surprised that my 8 y.o. who doesn't like tomatoes declared it delicious. The textures and flavor all meld together nicely. I doubled the garlic (we love garlic), and used a combo of butter & evoo. Only needed 2 ears of corn for the 2 cups of kernals. Also didn't need the pasta water, as the ripe garden tomatoes gave plenty of liquid. The worst part of the recipe was cutting the raw ears of corn & having kernals fly all over the counter. But it was worth it!

I really enjoyed making this. Ok, so i didnt do exactly what it said to do. I used some frozen corn and didnt use prosciutto but it was still good. I wouldnt change anything else. I like how easy and fast it was to make. Mother of a 3 and 1 year old (not much free time on my hands) TRY IT TRY IT AWESOME!!!!!

This dish is excellent and very simple to make. I doubled the garlic and tomatoes and didn't even bother with the pasta water as others have mentioned above. Other times I have added onions and green peppers which have been excellent adds.

My family inhaled this, which is both good and bad. The only difference in preparation was that I crisped the prosciutto on its own. We enjoyed everything about it and agree w/ earlier reviews that it would be equally as good without the prosciutto.

This dish was really delicious and very simple. I reduced the butter to 1/3 cup to save a few calories, otherwise wouldn't change a thing.

Made this last night - easy to follow recipe - tasted great. Be sure to use a high quality dry tortellini. I cut the butter in 1/2 and cooked the corn a little longer than stated. Otherwise great dish.

This recipe is great, especially considering how easy it is to make. The flavors work together wonderfully, and it provides an entire meal.

this is great! Make sure to use fresh corn that's in season - makes all the difference. Used 1/3 stick butter and no pasta water. It was perfect. The fresh basil is also a must. The combo of the fresh ingredients is the whole point. I could take or leave the prosciutto

This is the perfect way to enjoy fresh vegetables from the local farmer's market. It was so simple to prepare - perfect for a "school night". A few adjustments: I tripled the garlic, added extra basil and didn't use the reserved pasta water. I didn't find this dish salty at all. My fiance LOVED this dish.

Loved the ease of preparation and flavors of this recipe, and will make it often. Used frozen corn, even though I had cob corn in the frig (wanted to save the fresh for "Corn on the Cob with Lime-Chive Butter--another excellent recipe on this site). Subbed turkey ham for the proscuitto and 4 tsp. dried basil leaves for the fresh. Only criticism: even though I only waved the saltshaker over the corn when it was cooking, and only lightly salted the pasta cooking water, it was saltier than we like. Next time I would not add any salt. YUMMY. DO TRY THIS.

I was not sure about corn and tortelloni in the same dish, but was so glad I tried it. The fresh corn and fresh garden tomatoes really gave a great taste to the dish. I also like that the sauce is light while having an excellent taste. This is keeper for us and I will make it for friends soon.

I made this last night because I had four ears of corn I wanted to use up. I also had the other ingredients. It was very easy and very delicious. I left out the prosciutto because I am a vegetarian. I added extra garlic, some chopped onion, sliced mushrooms and two jalapeños with most of the seeds left out. It was wonderful and just hot enough to please our Southwestern pallets. I will be making it frequently. I can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch today.

Great recipe, tried it out last night for dinner. Everybody liked it. Definetly a keeper!!!!t

Tasty, easy...I overcooked my proscuitto and used fresh tortelloni instead. I also used only one tomato. Corn probably needs to be cooked longer and the proscuitto added later.

Very good and extremely quick and easy. I used half the butter (it didn't need that much, just added a little more pasta water) and half the corn, and added a diced red pepper, and it was delicious (though I think it would also be good as written). I was initially skeptical of the dried tortellini since I had never used them before, but they were surprisingly good. A great summer meal that I am sure I will make again.

Easy and delicious, a wonderful summer meal! Everyone loved it. Subed 1/2 of butter with evoo. Can't wait to make it again.
