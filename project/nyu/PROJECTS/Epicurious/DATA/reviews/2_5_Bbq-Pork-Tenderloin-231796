I liked the idea but prepared it completely different. It turned out great and was juice and tender. I cut the meat like instructed then put it in ziplock with our homemade BBQ sauce and let it marinade for half a day. I then baked it in the a 400 degree oven, in a single layer, in a baking dish for 20 minutes. I added some extra BBQ sauce so the meat had a good coating of sauce. When done I scooped out the meat and tented it. Then transfer the liquid from the baking dish to pot and boil it down some. Even one loved it and you didn't even need a knife to break up the slices.

This recipe has huge potential,that is why I made it. First, the cooking time needs to be tripled to tenderize the meat as necessary. Secondly, the sauce is bland at best. Indulge yourself on garlic, fresh ground black pepper, shirracha sauce, more wircestershire and whatever you think will add to the flavor of this dish because the dish as is, is bland and boring. Spice it up and it's great!

It is a happy night at my my house when I make thia recipe, and I make it every couple of weeks. I have two boys, aged 11 and 9 who adore this meal. I would also suggest serving this on onion buns if they are available to you.

Made this because I had all the ingredients. Didn't like the idea of not browning, so did that, then into 450 oven, then tented in foil. Shredded beautifully. Used pan drippings to brown onions for sauce. Delicious sandwiches on hamburger buns w/vinegary slaw. Know this isn't "Real bbq", but it was so quick & EASY!

This is too much fun! Epicurious reviews entertain me, especially the reviews that make me to look up word definitions. I've lived in the bbq belt, too, where bbq is a noun as well as verb. I refuse to become a snob of bbq. Where i've lived, the best bbq was cooked by half drunk guys staying up all night with a whole pig, a bunch of hot embers, and lots of the thin vinegary sauce. Guess the Jack Daniels went into the cooks, not the sauce. So i loved this recipe; no, it is not real deal bbq, but it tasted great and brought back a few memories. Made me happy.

Did not cut the pork into smaller pieces after the 1/4" cut. This would be wonderful over a bed of rice. Thanks for the recipe, we will use this one again for sure!!!

Had forgotten I used this recipe and reviewed it, ever in the quest for a quickie "bbq" pork sandwich, not slow-cooked pulled pork that I go to my favorite BBQ (no quotes) place for. Then realized I was the cook from Wichita KS that the guy was going on about! I guess I'm not really from here just happen to live here at this time, otherwise I might have taken offense.

This was ok. I added some honey & jarred BBQ sauce to alleviate the strong vinegar taste. Sauce wasn't thick enough though. Not bad for a quickie.

I think we're just going to have to agree to disagree about what constitutes "real" barbecue. There are just too many regional variations to reach a consensus. I have no barbecue credentials (note my town!), but I thought this was great for a weekday meal. My hideously picky children loved it and asked for seconds; so did the two guys who were painting my family room. My husband enjoyed it. No one would mistake it for long-cooked barbecue, but for "instant," it was great. I am adding this to my family dinner repertoire. We serve it rolled up in tortillas with a little Monterey Jack and some avocados on the side just in case we haven't consumed our full daily ration of fat...

For the reviewer interested in southern bbq pulled pork, try the Carolina Pulled Pork recipe on this site. It came highly recommended to me.

We loved this recipe. No, we don't live in the BBQ belt, but wish someone who does would recommend a recipe for an authentic version of southern barbecued pulled pork. With this much interest, there ought to be one in the next Gourmet.

This sauce in this recipe is tasty. I used somewhat dry leftover pork tenderloin that I chopped up and simmered in the sauce and it turned out great.

a waste of a tenderloin. go with shoulder for much more flavor and a much lower cost. vinegary sauce is good.

The combination of ingredients made a zesty sauce. I really hate to stoop to Kook from Pacific Palisades' level, however, there was not one iota of a mention of food in his (her) 'review'. This leads me to believe that more time is spent perusing the dictionary and thesaurus than cookbooks. I also observed that A Cook from Kansas and most other reviewers were AWARE ENOUGH of the world around them to ONLY submit their messages ONCE, as they made a sensible point the first time.

To the erudite cook from Pacific Palisades, CA You write very well but perhaps you could freshen up on your reading. They want critiques on the recipies, not on the people that give their opinions.

This was fast, yummy, pretty healthy and disappeared into three little tummies with no coaxing or complaints. I do can my own chili sauce in the summer and used that. Let's keep it real folks. When you have kids, you can't make involved food every night.

This recipe originally came out in Gourmet in 2002 as "SHREDDED PORK WRAPS WITH LEMON COLESLAW" I remember at that time the recipe also provided "entertaining" reviews which I've noticed have been removed (it got a little nasty) I've made it and thought it works fine for a fast weeknight dinner. Yes, even using ketchup!

I want to share with you a few of the tentative conclusions I've reached regarding A Cook from Wichita KS's off-the-cuff comments. And I stress the word "tentative," because the subject of what motivates A Cook from Wichita KS is tricky and complex. Here's my side of the story: It is pointless to fret about the damage already caused by A Cook from Wichita KS's addlepated put-downs. The past cannot be changed. We must cope with the present if we hope to affect our future and make plans and carry them out. Inarticulate, disorderly moral weaklings can go right ahead and convict me for saying that dim-witted nebbishes tend to dismiss reason, science, and objective reality, but History, acting as the goddess of a higher truth and a higher justice, will one day smilingly tear up this verdict, acquitting me of all guilt and blame. The facts are in: Our pain is A Cook from Wichita KS's ecstasy.

I have southern roots,I know what bbq is about. However I was hoping this would taste like my mom's quick "bbq" sandwiches I used to love. Not even close. Too much work for results, grab the bbq sauce bottle and make it easy on yourself. However my teenage son, mr. picky, loved it,go figure.

Mr. Analytic is absolutely correct. You DO get the same result by dumping purchased BBQ sauce onto a pork tenderloin in a crock pot. I know because my friend Miss (so smart)invented that recipe and I've tried it. "BBQ Pork Tenderloin" is NOT a recipe worthy of Gourmet or Bon Appetit. If you do get a hankerin' for a BBQ pork tenderloin, stuff one in the crock pot, dump half a bottle of purchased sauce on it and cook it for 8-10 hours on low. After it's cooked you can shred it, put it on hamburger buns, whatever. Better result than this Epicurious recipe, that's for sure!

The BBQ sauce was fine....although I gussied it up more to my liking (spicier, more vinegar, a dash of mustard). And since it was a rainy weekend here, I used a pork butt that I slow-roasted in the oven for about eight hours, then shredded. Not real BBQ, but a halfway decent substitute.

I liked this recipe, easy to make and tasty. The sauce was a little thin. Next time I will reduced the amount of water. With the thinner sauce, pouring the pork mixture over rice works, I did this with the leftovers the day after I made the dish for the first time.

To call this BBQ is an insult to the term. To ruin a pork tenderloin in this way is unspeakable.

Sorry, I can't help myself. I have to say more. Mr. Anayltic, you are assuming that we are all using store bought chili & Ketchup. Some of us may actually make our own. Also, your statement "you will get the exact same results by throwing a cheap piece of pork in a crock pot and dumping out a $2 bottle of supermarket BBQ sauce" is a "crock". I seriously doubt the results would be even close to this recipe, never mind the same.

I don't usually post when I havn't made the particular dish. However, the postings on this one are hilarious, (not to mention the recipe itself)! Everyone who has commented does not live in the "barbecue belt" and might not know that this dish seems like a "gussied up" version of the various pulled pork bbqs found throughout the Carolina's and Georgia, Kentucky, etc. (The mustard based vinegar sauce is common in my region.) I would also like to point out that the sauce is traditionally thin and predominately vinegar. It isn't like the thickened, uniform stuff you get out of a bottle. Anyway, people obviously have preferences, just pointing out a little history. See Chuck Kovacik's barbecue map.....

I have made a similar version of this recipe (that came from this web site several years ago) many times and it is wonderful. There are a few differences in the recipe that I use that I think might improve this recipe: the original recipe calls for cooking the onion 8-10 minutes; when adding the other ingredients (I substitute Thai style chili sauce and also add a tablespoon of brown sugar)simmer them for 10 minutes; add the tenderloin (quartered) and cook, covered for a minimum of 45 minutes. Then use 2 forks to shred the meat; I return the meat to the sauce and simmer for another 10 minutes or so. I also double the sauce as the longer cooking time thickens it significantly. A great sandwich or wrap.

to mranalytic... One would assume that by giving this recipe one fork, you've actually made the recipe. I suspect you haven't. A useful review might have stated that you thought the ketchup and chili sauce made the overall sauce taste too much like store-bought sauce. You're review was useless to all of us. Next time, save the diatribe.

Rating: 1
I fail to see the purpose of making your own BBQ sauce if you are using store-bought ketchup and chili sauce as your base. You will get the exact same results by throwing a cheap piece of pork in a crock pot and dumping out a $2 bottle of supermarket BBQ sauce. Meanwhile, you could be cooking something else.
