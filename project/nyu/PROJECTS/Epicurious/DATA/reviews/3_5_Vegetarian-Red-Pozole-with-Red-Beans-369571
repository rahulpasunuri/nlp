This recipe was very easy to make. Great for the not so experienced chefs like myself. The only thing I did differently was add a can of green chilies. My husband and I liked it a bit on the spicier side.

Delicious! I think the directions are terrific the way they are. It is not often you find a vegan meal so good. Not too spicy either. Careful not to burn the anchos. Serve over boiled cut potatoes for something a little more filling. Lettuce, radish, lime and avocado on top. Yummmmmm

I have to admit I was a little skeptical that this would have depth of flavor without stock, but it was fantastic! I made it two days ahead to let the flavors meld. I quadrupled the recipe for a crowd and used both zucchini and butternut squashes. The pot was clean at the end of the night. Served shredded chicken on the side, as well as rice. I will definitely make this again.

After reading the other comments I decided to substitute the water with turkey stock and use only one can of white hominy. It was really good. The accompaniments are a must - we added avocado and fresh corn tortillas to the list and it was yummy.

Easy. Flavorful. Clean tasting, for pozole (sans chicken fat). Adaptable (you could throw in some leftover shredded chicken breast if so inclined). Will make this again.

Used homegrown anchos, and made as directed except for using a firm winter squash instead of the out of season zucchini. Leftovers have been a hit with company, and nutritious. Would rate 3-4 stars, as I made with a little flavor boost from the following: adding 2 anchos roasted and chopped coarsely and 3 chopped cloves of garlic, 1 tsp cumin, 2 tsp oregano, using chicken stock instead of water, and adding a sprinkling of extra salt and cayenne, all added before final simmering.
