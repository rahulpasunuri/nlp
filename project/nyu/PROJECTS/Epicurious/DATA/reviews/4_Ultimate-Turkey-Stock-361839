I do this every Thanksgiving except I brown the turkey parts in the oven until very dark brown to make the stock a darker color.

Simply wonderful! Used it as the base for gravy for Thanksgiving, and used the rest the following day as soup with leftover turkey in it. Delicious!

YUM! This made the *best* gravy. Instead of wings (which I couldn't find at the store), I used 4 turkey drumsticks. Will definitely be my go-to recipe for stock.
