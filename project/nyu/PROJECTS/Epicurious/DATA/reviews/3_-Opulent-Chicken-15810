Even if you follow this recipe perfectly without altering it, you will get dinner that is bland, boring and tastes like a can.Chef Ramsay would swear at the writer for not tasting the food before publishing.

Loved this recipe, simple to make and pretty to serve. I used skinless chicken breast, and cut the cooking time by 7 min.

I wanted a proper casserole so I made some changes: 1 1/2 lbs boneless skinnless chicken thighs cooked in the fat rendered from 1 thick slab of bacon (no butter necessary)and cut up into bite-sized chunks. Herbs de Provence instead of tarragon. Cut the cooked bacon in with the chicken, tossed together with artichokes. Topped casserole with little croutons I made from sourdough bread tossed with olive oil, s&p, and thyme. I seldom tamper with recipes. It was fantastic.

I have made this several times. Mostly good, but discovered that some artichokes are less flavorful and have been disappointed lately. I took advise of another reviewed adding "capers" Does the trick. Good every time. Now I use both artichokes and capers...without fail. Nice for family OR guests.

I loved this one, and it's popular with my friends now as well - very nice variation on chicken marsala, and really easy. I used smoked paprika, and I gave my mushrooms some extra punch by using the leftover butter from the chicken (with the recommended dose from the recipe) to sauté them in. I also added some bits of pancetta at the same time as the artichokes. Broiling this for a couple minutes at the end of cooking gives the artichokes a nice texture.

This is very blah. The artichokes don't really work with the sauce. Edible is the best I can say.

What can I say about this dish? It was edible, but definately not anything I would make again. The only thing I did different was used thin cut chicken breast, dipped in flour with salt and pepper and browned it before adding it into the casserole dish. I thought it was good this way - it was only the sauce that was too bland. I served it with linguine.

This was good, but I didn't get rave reviews. I would make it again, but just to see if I can improve on the taste. I baked it in the individual foil at 350 degrees for 45 minutes instead of frying. I can't imagine what the frying will add except more fat. I will make it again, but I think next time, I will try to cut back the sugar to 1/3 cup.

Pretty good and very easy prep. Can't beat that. I am always looking for low carb recipes to add variety to our diet.

This was a perfect weeknight dish - tasty and easy to prepare. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts so reduced the cooking time by ~10 mins. I served it with a cauliflower and mushroom puree to give it a meat and potatoes feel without the potatoes.

I love quick and tasty chicken dishes for week night dinners and this one was just that. I used jarred marinated artichoke hearts and a mixture of oyster, shiitake and crimini mushrooms (we really like mushrooms) It was a beautiful dish and absolutely delicious.

Wonderful dish. I've cooked it several times and find it both easy and elegant. The artichoke brine gives it a slightly lemon-y flavor that I find works well with an herbed rice.

Yummy with a few minor changes based on what was in my pantry -- this recipe works really well with all kinds of substitutions and/or additions. I used boneless chicken breasts, browned very quickly so as not to overcook. My mushrooms were crimini, so I used beef broth and red wine to complement the deep flavors. I did not have fresh tarragon, so I used fresh thyme, which works well with poultry any time. Chopped garlic also got sauteed with the mushrooms. I tossed a can of drained diced tomatoes on top, purely because I'm married to a tomato addict. Served with steamed white rice to mop up the sauce and it disappeared!

Very simple, very tasty. I added some canned diced tomatoes for color and flavor. Served over angel hair pasta.

Wonderful recipe. I used Vermouth and the flavour was very distinctive. Fabulous dish!

Rating: 1
This recipe was so-so. Even after salt & peppering and adding paprika, the chicken didn't have much flavor. (Maybe need to slice the breast to thinner size before the chicken will absorb the flavors. I will probably follow the other cooks' suggestions, too, to make more sauce. I also, added a drained can of diced tomatoes for more color. The end result looked very delectable, but I would relate this dish to someone who decided to cook, but had lost their sense of taste. It was just...kind of.....blah.

Okay, maybe 'opulent' is a stretch, but this really is a very tasty, very easy, nice change of pace. Great way to get rid of those old when-did-I-buy-THESE cans of artichoke hearts. You could easily cut the butter in half. I used Marsala and will probably add more broth next time. Goes nicely with rice and a caesar salad.

I made this after my husband had a similar dish in a restaurant. I used less butter and broth and thought it was tasty.

We liked this recipe. I doubled the sauce as suggested and added more mushrooms(crimini&portabello). Used regular sherry instead of cream sherry it was still very good. If you're looking for a "spectacular" dish for a special occasion this probably isn't it. But if you're looking for a nice down-to-earth comfort food type dish that you can easily whip up on a week night after work, go for it!

We found this dish to be okay, but certainly was nothing special. Followed other reviewers' advice in efforts to punch it up a bit. While we didn't dislike it, it's not something we'll repeat.

I mixed my flower w/ chicken stock before adding to skillet. Used semi-dry sherry. Didn't care for the canned artichokes, but will try capers next time. delicious served on brown rice with a nice green salad on the side. will definitely prepare again.

Definitely follow others' advice and double the liquid. Don't forget to double the flour as well. You can mix as a roux with the mushrooms or add to the liquids and then boil down. Good with a little bowl of gnocchi.

I've been making this recipe for years! I was surprised to see that it was from BonAppetit. I have revised it a bit to add more zing for my family and they love it. I add at least a tablespoon of capers before putting it in the oven. Sometimes I even bread the chicken as I would for Chicken Romano and fry in olive oil until golden brown. The kids seem to like it better that way. It's not the fanciest dish but it is good in a pinch when you get unexpected company.

We found this to be a perfectly fine recipe, but we cook so seldom that when we do we're looking for something stellar...which this was not.

We loved this recipe! Because we live at high altitude (6200 ft), I added more liquid. Used about 2 cups of chicken broth ("Better Than Bouillon" chicken base); also used Cream Sherry and brown Italian mushrooms. Think this recipe would work equally well with chicken breast fillets (will try next time) and it's delicious served over white rice. Thank you Janet ;-)

I took some other people's advice and used nearly double the mushrooms, including shitake's, portabello's and buttons. Increased the wine by almost half. I found it odd that the recipe calls for throwing in flour when it does. I think there would be less clumping if you combine the flour and stock/wine ahead of time. Brown rice was a good idea. Overall, a very tasty dish especially with some good shrooms. Needed tons of salt b/c I stupidly used salt free stock...don't make that mistake.

I've made this dish a few times for company, always with rave reviews. I usually use a pound of mushrooms since they taste so good in the sauce. I also make it with boneless skinless chicken breasts. I tried the recipe without browning the chicken in a pan first and it was much moister and more juicy!

I uses skinless/boneless chicken breasts, increased the garlic and added capers in addition to the canned artichoke hearts,finished the sause with the Marsala Wine....Delicious.

Agree this is a good base dish and kick up the spices to suit you. As chicken drumsticks are moist, I reduced the butter by 1/2 and flavored w/ Emeril's 'Essence'. Next time I will try Old Bay and throw in whole cloves of garlic. Will also bake at 425 degrees to speed up cooking time (30-35min).

Rating: 2
A nice recipe, but not especially interesting. I boosted the flavor by not wiping out the pan after browning the chicken - why waste that good crusty stuff? I also used marinated artichoke hearts and did not drain them, so they carried some extra flavor into the dish. My family enjoyed it for dinner on a chilly evening. Brown rice was the perfect accompaniment for soaking up the sauce. I would make this dish for guests with timid palates, but would choose something more adventurous for guests with gourmet inclinations.

I have made this recipe many times. It is easy, quick and can be prepared ahead of time so we can enjoy our guests or children when they arrive. I recently lost the recipe and that is why I tried to find it on line and am very happy that it was here.

I cut up the chicken into pieces. Used McCorrmick's chicken base for the broth (that was the only problem-it's very salty), used regular sherry with a splash of red wine. Served over rice. Delicious

The first time I made this I mistakenly bought Italian flavored chicken broth. It was very good. The second time I made it I used regular chicken broth. It was better with the Italian. Maybe that's what it's missing!

The base recipe definitely needs tweaking - but it's excellent when you do! I used boneless chicken breasts, cut in half. Added a pound (2x what they call for) of more unusual mushrooms (shittake and portabella), 1/2 c of Madiera, and cut back the chicken broth to 1 cup. Made the sauce richer and more flavorful. Served it over couscous, which was great to soak up the sauce. It's not fancy - but it's awesome comfort food!!

Really rate this at a 2 1/2. It was good but the sauce needs something.

Given the last review, I was a tad hesitant to make this; but after reading all the other reviews, I thought I'd give it a try. I realize that different tastes are what makes the world go 'round, but since that was the only bad review, I have to wonder why... hhmmmm.. especially since this was absolutely delicious!! I, too, used chicken breast and kept them whole. Very flavorful and easy. Even my kids liked it! I'll definitely make it again. It's also a great "base" recipe to play around with, although it's just fine as it is, too.

This was horrible. I only gave it a one because you don't give the option for zero! I don't know what the other reviewers normally make for dinner, and especially company, but I would be embarassed to make this for anyone - I was upset that my husband and I had to eat this! There are way too many great recipes on this web site - don't be fooled by the mistaken reviews for this one - yuck.

Rating: 3
I also love this recipe. I keep my (boneless) breasts whole as I think the presentation is much nicer. I also use a variety of mushrooms - and lots of them! A dusting of Old Bay seasoning on the breasts before frying adds a bit more flavour and colour. Finally, I've subsituted the sherry with Port with excellent results.

My family loved it. Followed the advice of others and cut up the chicken and also used frozen artichokes.

My favorite chicken recipe -- with a few adjustments. 1: Definitely use boneless chicken breasts, cut in pieces. 2: Use Madeira or Sherry, not Marsala, and be liberal. 3: Use a variety of gourmet mushrooms. These really make the flavor come alive, especially Wood Ear and Hedgehog. 4: Use more mushrooms than called for -- as many as you can afford. I usually use about double what the recipe calls for. In other words, the concept of the recipe is great, the details are a little wishy-washy.

This is fairly easy and delicious. I used boneless, skinless breasts and they worked fine both times I have fixed it. Cut down on the butter and it is pretty low fat. First time used canned artichoke hearts and second time splurged and used artichoke bottoms. Liked them both.

A great and easy recipe! I would recommend using boneless chicken breasts cut into small to medium sized pieces. I also sometimes substitute red wine for the marsala when I don't have marsala. I always serve this dish with rice since the sauce is so delicious.

The recipe was not bad but not worth the effort and dishes. It was better a few days later as left over. It was like a speggetti sause, more flavorfull after it sat.

Sorry, but I've found several more tasty dishes than this one. I did a 'practice run' w/family before serving it to guests at an upcoming dinner party and am glad I did...making a menu change! I think the breasts with bone in are a bit unwieldly to serve/eat, and there wasn't a richness of flavor I'd expected based on the reviews. I used Marsala, and maybe that just isn't as good as the Sherry...
