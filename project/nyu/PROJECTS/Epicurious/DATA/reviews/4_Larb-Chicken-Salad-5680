This was delicious - I substituted savoy cabbage for boston lettuce which worked fine. Also, I added crushed toasted rice (1-2T, toasted carefully in a dry skillet, crushed with mortar and pestle). I saw this in other larb recipes and it gave a really nice crunchy texture as well as a nutty flavor to the larb.

This can also be made with pork; use a lean tenderloin or loin tip roast, which you can cut in chunks and then chop in a food processor. Addictive blend of intense flavors! I add finely minced ginger to the chicken or pork, just because I love ginger so much.

This is hands down the best, most authentic chicken larb I have had; it is better than most of the what I have had in restaurants. I have made this salad at least 5 times, since I came accross the recipe a year ago. My friends RAVE about it and beg for the recipe. I dont even need to go spend the money for Thai food at a restaurant as this recipe is better than what you can get at most.The tang of the lime juice, the little pops of flavor from the lemongrass, shallot, and chilies is phenomonal. I have two reccomendations though. I find it completely unneccessary to add chick broth to the meat while it is cooking. In fact, i drain all the liquid from the meat after it has cooked, because i dont want it to water down the dressing. Two,you can add the dressing to the meat while it is still warm, just dont add ANY of the green onions, lemongrass,chilies, or mint until AFTER, the chicken has had a chance to cool in the refrigerator; otherwise all the above ingredients discolor and lose their vibrant color and visual appeal. Lastly, be sure to use palm sugar for autheticity, available at any Asian market. This has a much different flavor than white sugar. Lastly, dont sub dried lemongrass, or dried anything in this recipe, you are doing the recipe and yourself a diservice.

While larb is eaten in Thailand it is actually from Laos. This recipe calls for too much sugar. Try a half teaspoon instead. Larb is usually served with a sprinkling of toasted rice and a side of sticy rice. It is my absolute favorite dish!

While larb is often eaten in Thailand, the dish itself is from Laos. This recipe calls for a little too much sugar. Try just a half teaspoon instead. Larb is usually served with a sprinkling of toasted rice and a side of sticky rice. Larb is my favorite dish. The one I would ask for as my last meal. I especially like it with raw meat.

All the elements are here, but I really had to adjust them for my particular taste. I don't do fish so I didn't use the fish sauce, but everything else was combined as listed. I thought it was waaaay to lime-y and didn't have enough heat, so after taste-testing I had to about triple the chili-garlic sauce, add lots of salt and a bit more sugar to balance out the lime. I thought this was the foundation of a good dish, and I would make it again with those adjustments.

Absolutely delicious! We used ground turkey b/c I like it better, Couldn't find fresh lemon grass so used it in dried form. We had it as a main course and it was DIVINE!

I replaced the mint and cilantro with the more Thai traditional fresh basil. My family really enjoyed this. Red onions can replace shallots.

i made this last night with ground turkey, and i didn't have lemongrass so left it out. Scooped it up with some hearts of romaine since i had them in the fridge. husband said - "you nailed it" It was seriously good - tangy, spicy, salty, yum.

I have made this version of larb 3-4 times, each time to rave reviews. A couple of things - buy thigh filets - the breast meat dries up way too fast. Don't grind the chicken, just chop it into 1/4" - 3/8" cubes - it holds it's moisture better that way. I use serrano peppers, as the thai bird chilis are a bit much. I also withold some of the citrus juice and all of the cilantro, adding the citrus to taste and the cilantro as a garnish [my wife is one of those who perceive cilantro with the same flavor as dish soap]. Excellent larb.

Rating: 4
This is great. I found the chilis to be a bit overpowering (personal taste) in relation to the other ingredients. Next time, I'll use less chiles. Problem solved!

Loved it. Made my own rice powder by toasting uncooked rice white and grinding in spice grinder. Added 2 tbls before adding lime sauce to mixture. Will make this over and over.

yummmmm! I've finally found a way to get an easy Thai fix at home! I added 2 tbs ground rice powder to the mix after cooking, but before adding the sauce, and it definitely adds some complexity to the flavors, in a good way. I didn't have any green onions, but didn't miss them. Served with a little thinly sliced red onion and lettuce. yummmm!

Over the years, I have tried a few Larb recipes. This, by far, the best one I have tried. I think what is better about this recipe is all the lime juice. It tastes nearly identical to the one made by my favorite Thai restaurant. One variation though -- I wrap it in cabbage leaves (like the restaurant does), rather than in Boston lettuce leaves.

Rating: 3
Ok, so this is not exactly an authentic larb. But given the differences from one Thai restaurant to the next, who's to say your own version isn't as good? I will say, experiment with this to get the flavors you like most, and don't be afraid to leave out the fish sauce. I use a pinch of (Japanese) hon dashi (fish bullion) instead, and make up the lost liquid with extra lime juice. You can also add a touch of rice wine vinegar, to kick down the spice of the garlic/chili sauce, which can really pack a punch, and using honey instead of sugar adds a nice complexity. I have made this with ground turkey & pork, but I like the delicacy of the chicken best. I found ground lemongrass in the freezer section of my asian market, so I never go without this ingredient. I always add about 1 tbsp toasted rice powder, which does not make it chewy, as some said, since the actual stuff is a powder, and only adds a nutty flavor and holds some moisture in. It doesn't change the texture except to keep it from being too runny. I serve it with julienned red bell pepper on a bed of baby spinach, so you can wrap a leaf around each bite with your chopsticks - yummm! Also have served it with endive for a party app; very versatile, one of my favorites. Next time I'm going to try to mod it for use as a filling in mini spring rolls thanks to my hubby's suggestion!

Very tasty. I like the fact there is no added fat. I served it with cabbage wedges. I did cut down on the shallots and added about a cup of thinly sliced red onion. I also added more chili garlic sauce.

This recipe is yummy! It's one of my favorite appetizer at Thai Restaurants. I changed chicken for ground pork and either is good. You can adjust the chili or lime if you'd like though. I will cook this again.

Although not entirely authentic, this is a tasty and refreshing salad that I will definitely make again. I have to agree that the chili paste was overpowering- I had to add a lot more citrus to cut through the paste. I serve my laarb as a real salad- I tear the romain up and then toss so that the lime and chili coats the leafy greens. I then garnish with cilantro and a healthy sprinkling of pepper.

Fantastic, healthy dish -- very flavorful and easy to make.

Yum! Very flavorful. I made a couple of minor adjustments (left out the lemongrass, added rice powder, added raw red onions). I think the only change I would make next time is to lower the chili garlic paste amount (to reduce the spicyness) and include some fresh lemon juice with the lime in the dressing.

This is absolutely yummy anyway that you make it. We like it with hamburger and dry fried rice (just dry fry the rice and run it through the blender). The rice adds a nice, crunchy texture. We normally just cook it up with jalapeno peppers and it tastes great. Roll up and serve on lettuce leaves (your choice of lettuce). This is simple and it's tasty!

Instead of the boston lettuce I used romaine leaves to roll the meat mixture in. I served it at a Superbowl party to rave reviews.

This is a fabulous recipe I make it all the time but serve in Chinese wonton cups as an appetiser. Spray mini muffin tins and wrappers with oil and cook 6-7 minutes in moderate oven until golden brown then cool. Fill wonton cups with hot or cold larb mixture just before serving - they look great and always go down a treat.

This is one of the best recipes on the site. I used finely chopped pork and did not have lemongrass. I think the key to this recipe are the thai chiles - they give it the perfect heat. delicious, fragrant.

Very nice taste, however I felt like there was something missing. There was a definite need of more chilies and chili paste. This would definitely be a great party food.

Delicious and spicy for Thai lovers. I prefer to use beef rather than chicken, but the marinade/dressing is so flavorful that it could make anything taste great. Could also easily be done with a soy produce for vegetarians.

To make real larb, you must use galanga root and toasted rice powder, which this recipe doesn't call for.

I added 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and 1/2 tablespoon of hot chili oil. Good salad!

Fantastic, and surpringly easy once you do all the prep. I used whole chicken breasts and ground them in the processor, which worked fine. I also served it over more greens than called for, along with some diced cucumber and green pepper, for added nutrition. I do agree with one reviewer's note--where are the chopped peanuts?

This is a delicious version of the larb gai I get in one of my favorite Thai places. This is an addictive dish- so don't even think about it as just an appetizer. Double it and call it an entree- I doubt you'll have leftovers! Also- it's a quick and fun dish to make, so you can have friends over for cocktails while you're making the main course (can't say that about much!)

We love this recipe! Great clean, bright flavors with the lime juice and the herbs. We have made it many times and think it is better than the larb we have had in most Thai restaurants. We like to mound it in the middle of a platter and surround it with the lettuce leaves and cabbage.

Overall excellent, with following caveats: For those that may find ground chicken hard to find (I was surprised two nearby grocery chains don't carry it), ground turkey will work with similar flavor results. The compromise is that the cooked turkey has a browner color than the chicken which has a much more appealing, brighter whitish color. Definitely use only HALF the lime juice and fish sauce in the recipe (slowly add more to taste, if necessary). Full strength may have been the culprit for the YUK! review from Cleveland, OH. Lemongrass may be hard to find, but don't skip it! Check out your local nursery and plant your own...it looks like a tall sea grass, and can fit nicely into many landscapes. Also available at asian grocery stores that you may not realize are in your area. Mixed reviews at our house on the addition of the ground brown rice - "He" thought too chewy - "She" liked the added texture. Have served at several parties and a rehearsal dinner and received rave reviews. May want to try endive leaves for parties...looks elegant, creates great bite-sized servings, and easier to assemble than lettuce or cabbage. Enjoy!

Two changes and this recipe is perfect. 1) Use ground pork instead of chicken. 2) Brown a little rice in a dry frying pan, grind it with a mortar and pestle and mix it in.

Yuck! Way too funky flavors for my family's taste. This is the 1st recipe from Epicurious out of the hundreds I've tried that disappoints. I followed the recipe exactly except for 1 change - substituted red chili flakes for hot peppers. It was way too heavy on the lime & fish sauce- bitter and unpleasant,

I live in Bangkok and have "Larb Gai" quite often. This recipe is not at all authentic to the northeast Thai recipe. Aside from that, the recipe is lacking one crucial and important ingredient: browned vermicelli which is ground to the consistency of black pepper (they brown glutinous rice here). The ingredient gives a unique nutty flavor to the recipe. Larb Gai is always served with sticky rice here. The recipe given here is a Thai-Western fusion recipe of Larb Gai, and not bad.

The chicken salad is wonderful, a refreshing, tangy Thai dish. I've made it twice, and it turned out excellent both times. The first time, I couldn't find nice lettuce so I used cabbage leaves. I thought they worked well but my husband thought they were too thick and crunchy. The second time I found nice bib leaves and they worked very well. Although, make sure to serve it with a slotted spoon, as the salad tends to have excess liquid.

I can't believe how easy this recipe is. It's a fabulous appetizer for a cocktail party or a reception. Definitely substitute cabbage wedges for the lettuce to give it some crunch. It's also nice with cucumber wedges on the side. I seeded the chiles to keep it a little mild. Will add approx. half the seeds next time.

This is so easy and great tasting, I just finished the leftovers for lunch. Lemongrass is sometimes difficult to come by, I substitue grated lemon peel and it works great. This is great as a starter or serve with a wedge of cabbage and some Jasmine rice for a complete meal.

Great recipe (we always order larb from our favorite Thai restaurant). I did make some substitutions/additions that worked well. I replaced the chili-garlic sauce with a fresh hot red fresno pepper, a tablespoon of garlic and a tablespoon of leeks. I also substituted chopped leeks for the green onion. When I was finished cooking everything, I added a tablespoon of roasted rice powder (dry fry uncooked rice for about 5 minutes and crush with a mortar and pestle). YUM!
