This is spectacular decoration, they look beautiful and are yummy too. I use it for any chestnut cake recipe.

What a mess! The sugar wouldn't stick to the chestnuts, it left long strings of melted sugar all over the place and frankly were dull to eat. Usually I love the recipes on epicurious, but this one fails miserably.
