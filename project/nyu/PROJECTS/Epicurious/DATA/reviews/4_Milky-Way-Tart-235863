Delicious! jillontoast, your mousse turned out as it did probably because you whipped it too long. If that happens again, gently reheat and gently whisk until it mounds softly. You don't have to melt it all the way down, just reheat gently until you the graininess goes away. Next time stop whipping it before you think it is ready.

Yum! I will certainly make these again. Worth the time, and as many reviewers noted, you must follow the recipe exactly. If you make the shells and chocolate cream mixture the night before, then it's just a matter of making the caramel and assembling the next day. Easy.

The Caramel is fantastic. The rest is okay but my "mousse" coagulated and looks like cottage cheese. I am not sure what i did wrong, but it never looked like mousse. It still tastes delicious, but it looks scary. I love to bake so I didn't mind it taking the whole day to make. But for most people I'd say not worth it- unless i can figure out why the mousse coagulated like that. I followed the recipe to the T.

Don't listen to the negative reviews! While this recipe requires that you plan ahead, it's pretty easy and the results are impressive. As others have noted: follow the directions; for example, it doesn't tell you to grease the pan!

This is an incredible recipe! I only make it once a year for Chanuka, although I get requests for it all year long :) It is so yummy and so worth the effort. Highly recommended!

Just made this yesterday and today for Easter. It has a lot of steps, but was delicious. Plan ahead and start early. I used semi sweet chips because that was all I had -- no problem. We did have some caramel bits that just would not dissolve, but it was not a problem. It makes A TON of the chocolate- cream mixture, which is basically chocolate mousse. Yum!

This is one of my go-to recipes for entertaining- it's a lot of work but worth it. For a holiday party, I made these in mini muffin tins. I pressed dough into the tins (I think I got about 24 out of it) and reduced the baking time to 10 minutes. Then I removed them from the tins, spooned caramel on, and then used a pastry bag to pipe on the mousse. The caramel got a bit messy, but otherwise they were absolutely perfect! The only problem is that they're addictive :)

This tart was good. Very rich. I made one 9 1/2 inch tart instead of the individual ones.

Definitely one of my favorites. I make this recipe often and it is always a hit. It's so easy, as the crust dough can be made ahead of time. Hint: The caramel works better if you prepare it in a non-nonstick pan. It turns to amber quicker.

Amazing! This is my go-to recipe for entertaining, and it has not failed me after making it at lest 4 times. Be careful not to over-whip the mousse or it will become dense. a favorite for chocolate lovers and non-lovers alike.

Unbelievably fantastic. Made this a couple weeks ago and everyone went crazy so I made another dozen this past weekend and stored some in the freezer. Just follow the directions and you can't go wrong. I've always been impatient to chill my dough so I just patted it in the tart pans then froze before baking. Also, like the recipe says, be careful when you add the butter and cream to amber mixture-if the pot is too small, it will boil right on out of the pot.

Wonderful recipe! I have made it twice now. As long as you follow the recipe carefully you will have no problems. Everyone I served this to loved it!

After reading the problems other people had with this, I'm really glad I followed the directions to the letter. My crust was a bit difficult to work with once it started to warm up again, going into the tins, and my carmel also took longer than advised to turn amber, but patience and faith paid off! I would probably NOT make this again, however. It was delicious, but not so exceptional and, most importantly, foolproof that I would add it to my entertaining repertoire.

This was easy and the end result is a professional looking tart. Just follow the carefully written directions and you will have a success. You can do do the whole thing or parts of it ahead. I wouldn't consider making it into a 9 inch tart. The individual tarts are not any more work and are much more attractive.

This was a big hit, both my family and co- workers loved these deserts. Followed the recipe exactly and thought it was really decadent. Made my tart "A" list.

Rating: 4
This was delicious!! It requires lots of work but the flavors were spectacular. I had trouble with the caramel - it never turned dark amber but I let it boil for double the time and it turned out fine. I used a 9 inch tart pan but recommend one with ridged edges to improve presentation. If you want to wow your guests, this is a good choice.

I am a senior citizen who cooks dessert, only, once a year for a Valentine Dinner for 5 couples. Another senior and I work together. We had lots of anxiety with this recipe,(which is standard for us) but it came out perfect. My wife has been eating hers for the last couple of days, a small amount at a time as it is very rich. We could not find 4 1/2 inch tartlet pans, so we used 4 inch, which we found at two stores. I am at a loss to comprehend the one reviewer who had a problem with the dough melting down the sides. We had no such problems. When in doubt, read the recipe----ten times, if necessary. I bet she didn't refrigerate the dough !! Also, on a previous dinner, we were instructed by the other cooks(??) to use a tart recipe, made for a nine-inch tartpan, in 4 inch deep by four inch diameter souffle cups. What a disaster !!!! If the recipe calls for small pans, use them....if 9" tart pan, use it. NO SUBSTITUTIONS !!!

I made this as a full-size 9 inch tart. The crust stuck to the bottom of the pan and was difficult to serve. Next time I will line the pan with buttered parchment. Also, after 15 minutes boiling the sugar, it never did reach the deep amber color. I would consider using purchased caramel next time if I cannot perfect the homemade variety. I might consider adding powdered sugar to the mousse to give it more stability...the tart "melted" a bit when it was cut and did not present well. The taste was incredible though, and I would definitely make this again. My mother and father proclaimed it "exceptional" and took leftovers home.

I made this dish times 20 for my themed chocolate lovers night where I work and it received rave reviews from all 120 people who ate it. The mouse was perfect I deviated on the caramel and the shell was slightly difficult when it got warm but I will definately make this again

I love the taste of it. But still playing with the recipe. First time I made it, the dough just melted and the sides came down - after pressing with the spoon(as recommended), I guess something happened with the nonstick spray (I guess, I wiped it off, by pressing the dough, again as recommended), any way it wouldnt come out of the form. So now, I roll it out and blind bake it - works perfectly :) Now to the caramel - out of three times I made it, it only came out with the right consistency once. The third batch is in the refrigerator now - waiting to harden up, since it wouldn't do it at the room tempreture... But really, that one time when everything came out well, it was a perfect recipe and I just love the taste. I also agree with people who says that for the richness 6 tarts are too little. It should be at least 8 or even less, but then you'll need more dough... Oh boy...

My husband and I were very disappointed with this. For all the time and effort that went into making it, I expected something much, much better. I have a friend who loved it, so maybe it's just a personal preference thing. I will not be making this again.

I made this dessert for a dinner party (exactly as the recipe instructed) and it came out wonderfully. Loved the combination of dark crumbly chocolate crust, gooey caramel, and light not-too-sweet mousse. Definitely a keeper. The other party-goers couldn't believe it didn't come from a bakery!

Crust did not come out, the sides fell in the oven, even with freezing, and it was hard as a rock. Otherwise tasty but didn't blow me away, so I'm not sure I'd try it again since I have so many other recipes to try out!

What a disappointment! This recipe sounded so full of potential (just the name was a come on) and instead it was barely so so. I made it as a big tart (my first mistake?). The cookie-like crust was hard, the carmel coagulated and the filling took about 20 minutes to whip up. The only thing I can say is that if it's served very, very chilled it'll be OK. Not a keeper (though I won't hold it against the candy bar).

Mmmm... 3 1/2 forks! This was a hit. Not too sweet for my tastes. Made it in a 9 inch springform pan instead of individual tarts and used semi-sweet chocolate. Took another reviewer's suggestion and topped it with chopped toasted hazelnuts, which added some crunch. My only suggestion is to add a pinch of salt to the caramel as well as the crust to enhance the flavor.

This recipe was muy ricos! Very delicious. My whole family enjoyed it. The only change I made was I made it in a regular sized tart pan instead of seperate pans.

Delicious! I made a few modifications: For the cream chocolate mixture I used semi-sweet chocolate (my favorite!). And for the caramel I added 1/2 cup chopped toasted hazelnuts. Absolutely wonderful and easy.

This was absolute heaven. I made eight smaller tarts, and only needed half of the milk chocolate mousse.

I made one large tart for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I did beat the whipping cream chocolate mixture more than called for, which was good, as it tends to break down quickly.

Wow - we loved this tart. There were a lot of steps, but most of them were pretty simple. The caramel did give me some problems, I will try using superfine sugar next time to see if that helps. The kids each had 2 servings and then asked for more the next day. Yes, it was rich, but we made one large tart and got about 10 servings from it.

Liked the flavor and didn't mind the numerous steps and chilling times. Six portions are too few for the sweetness of this tart. My chocolate loving friend also thought the portions too large. Next time I will make one large tart with the cake on the bottom only and not up the sides, caramel slightly away from the cake edge, and the cream slightly away from the caramel. One tart would allow different portion sizes.

Our famiy loves sweets, but this one was just too much. All the parts were good, it was just too rich altogether. I will make the mousse separately another time.

This recipe was quite time-consuming, especially since it was a really humid day when I made the caramel & it took FOREVER!!! I would use my regular foolproof caramel recipe next time (tried & true). when I did finally put it together , it was fabulous, just the flavour I'd imagined. The pastry was really nice & crisp & you can't beat chocolate & caramel together. Oh yeah, I did use more chocolate as I automatically do (I can't help it!).

This recipe looked so involved that I almost didn't try it, but I am so glad that I did! It was marvelous. A real hit with our guests. The recipe was easy and I followed it perfectly. You've got to try this one!
