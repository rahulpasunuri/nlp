Yummy! Only got to marinate for ~ 4 hrs, but lamb was super juicy and tasted great. Added red onion and red bell pepper kebabs, and served with warm pita bread. Easy to make as well, once I got all the thyme leaves stripped. Will definately make again.

So easy for a weeknight. Marinate before work, then come home, skewer and grill! I found the triangular zucchinis a bit hard to skewer, so I'd stick to my old method of thick rounds skewered end to end (not through the soft middle).

This recipe was easy and delicious. I cooked the lamb kebabs on a George Foreman grill (ah, the sorrow of apartment life) for 6 minutes.

We made this twice in one week, it was so good. Also, on the grill, it was easier to manage separate skewers of tomatoes, zucchini and then just grill good boneless lamb chops. Outstanding.

Made this according to the recipe and we really liked it. It is a good idea to put the meat, tomatoes and zucchini on different skewers as they take different amounts of cooking time. I served this with oven roasted baby potatoes.

Made this last weekend. The lamb was delicious. We especially liked the idea of using a baggie to marinate the meat. We had a few too many other side dishes so the zucchini and the tomatoes didnt get eaten. I made it with the chicken, mint and red onion kebabs also from this site - great combination.
