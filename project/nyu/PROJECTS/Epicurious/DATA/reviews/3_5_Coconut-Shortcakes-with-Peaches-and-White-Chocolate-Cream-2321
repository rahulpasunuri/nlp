The shortcake was yummy, sweet and a little crunchy, easy to make. I couldn't get ripe peaches at the last minute so I simmered frozen mixed berries in a little sugar and lime juice and then used a slotted spoon to move the fruit to the shortcake. I only had 2 oz. white chocolate but the sweet, creamy flavor came through. The crew was licking up crumbs to get every bit and couldn't stop talking about how good it was.

Though this recipe seemed a bit time consuming, this special treat is well worth it. I made the whipped cream and and toasted the coconut a day in advance. I would definitely make this recipe again, much to the pleasure of friends and family --- it's wonderful!

I love this recipe... it's decadent, delicious, and easy. (I just use the bisquick box recipe for the shortcakes and add toasted coconut.) I live alone, so once I've served the dessert to my dining companion(s), I use up the leftovers by slicing up a peach (the sauce and the whipped cream keep just fine in the fridge for several days), cover with the leftover sauce and whipped cream, and packing some shortcake on the side. When I'm ready for my decadent snack, I crumble some of the shortcake over the top, and voila! Upside down shortcakes!

Unfortunately, this was a disapointment. Don't fold the cream into the choc. mixture in two batches...only one. The overworking of it caused the mixture to get grainy. Also, the shortcakes are a cake texture. They totaly crumbled upon unmolding. Had to start all over again, but this time I used I actual shortbread recipe to which I added toasted coconut. Was able to save the white choc. cream by reheating, cooling, rebeating and folding in more whipped cream. Won't make again!
