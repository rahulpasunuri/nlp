These turned out really great. By draining the chorizo and not overdoing the cheese, they are crunchy and not greasy. I fire-roasted the poblano first, my only change to the recipe.

I've made this many times-AS IS- and it is always a crowd pleaser!!

I but didn't follow the procedure. I only had sun-dried tomatoes in oil so sliced them right out of the bottle. I used 2 whole wheat tortillas as the pizza crust and topped it with the sausage, garlic, pine nuts, oregano, and used a blend of 2% cheeses + maybe an once of pepper/jack that I had on hand, then topped it with yellow pepper slices that I had sauteed, and chopped green onion. Baked it for 10 minutes with a great result. My husbans and I each had one tortilla pizza.

I made a crust with masa dough instead of tortillas. It was wonderful. A new favorite!

If you're looking for something to really wow your friends, make this. V. Good. Nice blends of flavor and texture/color. All you need is a patio with sun, great friends and a margaritita! Did not make any changes. Also, if you don't make the recipe, don't review-kind of mindless.

A very nice mixture of flavors though the preparaion of frying then baking is a little cumbersome. I made this for a dinner party and guests were munching them very heavily.

This was great! Served them as main course. I added some crumbled Feta with black olives and more sun dried tomatoes to the top portion for extra flavor. Of course my husband smothered his in my homemade pico de gallo-and ate the rest of mine! Would definitely make this for guests as appetizer. Could use a lot less oil for frying.

Too many sundried tomatoes! Added the the reserved vinaigrette to the pizza topping for some unknown reason, & it made the pizza really greasy. Not bad, but not great. Made the recipe on a basic pizza dough recipe made up of 1/2 white flour & 1/2 whole wheat flour

I have been making this as a pizza with my own fresh pizza dough recipe since 96. It is the best. Everytime I make it it gets raves. A great success at parties cut up into finger food and passed around.

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this dish-- simple, cheap, and really tasty! We split one pizza for dinner with an avacado and sweet onion salad. The next morning I basted an egg on top and whala-- we had one crazy mexican breakfast skillet! In fact, it was better for breakfast-- tha flavors really came together overnight and the egg tamed down (complimented) the richness of the chorizo.

As a lower fat/vegi alternative I would suggest substituting soy chorizo (found at health food stores and many markets). It is a chorizo-seasoned soy product that tastes very much like the original, but without all the grease. When cooking it you will need to add some oil to your pan to prevent sticking. I'm not a vegetarian, but I do enjoy trying out healthful substitutes, and it's a great dish to prepare for my non-meat eating friends.

Delicious! A wonderful combination of flavors! A huge hit with the man of the house. This would be a bit messy as an hors'douevre, but be sure to make it anyway.

Great! Very interesting flavor! I'm surprised no one has reviewed/tried it before now! Rather than make a layered pizza I used a 12" prepared pizza crust and made one pizza.
