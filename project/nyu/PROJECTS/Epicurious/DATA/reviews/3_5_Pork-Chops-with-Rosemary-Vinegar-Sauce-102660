We've made this recipe with thickly sliced chops and thinly sliced ones - we lessened the time when we sauteed the thinner ones, but we enjoyed the thicker ones much more. We also used homemade chicken stock which made a more flavorful and less salty sauce.

Fabulous! The trick to this sauce is too reduce it for a long time..mine reduced closer to 20 minutes. After that long the separating cures itself. Very silky sauce.

I really wanted to like this recipe, but my husband and I thought this was very bland. I followed the recipe exactly using raspberry vinegar- the one difference was that I added all of the rosemary at the end because it didn't make sense to me to saute fresh rosemary for such a long time and still expect flavor.

The sauce is terrific and easy. 4 forks for time/value proposition!

Fabulous! I cooked this for my husband and me so only used two chops but did not halve the sauce. The key is to be patient while cooking the sauce down. I didn't think it looked thick enough after ten minutes so let it go a few more minutes and ended up with perfectly smooth and thick sauce.

I loved this, and it was so easy! It has become one of my regular dishes. I used red wine vinegar and more chicken broth and cream than called for, though, so there would be extra sauce to serve over pasta.

Made as directed, pork chops were great, but found the sauce a little thin and bland. Thickened it up with a little cornstarch/water mix, added a squirt of spicy mustard and a dash of cayenne. Much better then.

This was really good. We used dried rosemary-same amt as called for fresh. This would also work with beef or chicken, possibly lamb. I used the tip of putting in the cream after the stock and wine. Worked out well.

Great weekday recipe. Kids and Hubs (who claims to hate rosemary) loved it. A definite keeper. USed half and half instead of heavy cream because that is what I had. I whisked the sauce for the first few minutes that it boiled and had no problems with separation.

Just made this for the third time. We doubled the recipe and for some reason the sauce was a little thinner and much more plentiful. Probably our error. Try this recipe, you will get raves.

Wow I really just impressed myself with this recipe. Almost gave up as I saw the sauce separate, but as others have said in their reviews, it comes together in the end. The only substitution I made was swapping the cream with fat free milk. But this was one delicious recipe. 5 stars!

Great, simple recipe. I folliowed the recipe exactly - only cutting in half (only had 2 chops in freezer). Used red wine vinegar and added a little fresh raspberry puree - had no problem with the sauce breaking. This is definitely on the make again list.

Rating: 4
Excellent, easy recipe. I doubled the sauce ingredients with the exception of the rosemary, which I quadrupled. In order to avoid the curdling that may other cooks have mentioned, I tried adding the vinegar first to the hot pan, following immediately with the chicken stock, then wine, lastly I whisked in the whipping cream, and continued whisking until the sauce had reached a boil. At this point I added in the remaining rosemary (which I had doubled) as well as the golden-brown garlic slices. Cooked this down as described, but I think it took about 15-20 minutes total. Added salt and pepper to taste, amazing.

My sauce seperated as soon as it hit the pan. Any suggestions to prevent this? I persevered though and reduced until quite thick ( maybe too thick) but we still really enjoyed.

The KEY is to wait until the sauce is reduced and thickened. It will without cornstarch. I doubled the recipe & reduced for almost 20 min. What a difference it made from when I was testing the taste in the beginning!! Used more rosemary 1/2 the vinegar & cooked pork tenderloin cut in 1" slices to medium rare. Also used Fat Free half & half. My husband who travels & eats at fine dining establishments just raved about this.

Really quick and easy with delicious results. The cream sauce is rich, but the vinegar seems to cut through it - making it taste much lighter. I would cut down the cooking time of the pork chops to 5 minutes/side.

Easy and very tasty. I used very lean pork chops and only seared for 6 minutes each side, then added back to the sauce to simmer for a few minutes at the end. Next time, I'd sear for less time to avoid them getting quite so chewy. But a weeknight keeper.

This is relatively easy, quick and very tasty. My fiance loves it and we quickly added it to our repertory of repeat-worthy dishes. I always double the sauce (leftovers are yummy on white rice), and this recipe is also tasty using thyme instead of rosemary. I usually pan-fry the pork for a little less time initially, then add the chops back into the pan once the sauce is nearly finished to reheat them and maintain the meat's moisture. I serve mashed potatoes or buttered rice on the side, plus green beans. All in all, simple and tasty.

No more boring pork chops!!! I agree with other cooks that the sauce is just (barely) enough for two thick chops. But, how tasty!!! I substituted half & half for the whipping cream. The sauce took longer to reduce than expected, but worth the wait. This will definitely go into our dinner circulation. I might try the sauce with veal.

This was wonderful and I am not a big pork chop fan! I only made two thick-cut pork chops but the same amount of sauce and it was perfect. The only change I made was to add a pat of butter to the sauce at the very end and to cook the chops longer than recommended. I used a meat thermometer to make sure they were cooked through. Next time I will add more rosemary because I love the flavor.

Delicious. I reduced the cooking time of the pork to 5 min. each side. When it came time to add the cream, I just added the same amount of 1% milk with a tablespoon of flour mixed in it. It worked great and thickened up wonderfully. I made TWO chops instead and had a goodly amount of sauce (I like sauce!) but if I'd made four, I think it wouldn't have been enough. This recipe will go in the file.

This was a great week night meal and I took a lot of the suggestions below! I added fat free 1/2 +1/2 since I didn't have cream, but looks like I could have used sour cream as well. I also browned some mushrooms after taking out the chops, and they were a great addition to the sauce. I did put the chops into cook a bit longer while the sauce was near finished, but probably wouldn't do that again as they cooked a little too long... Also added a bit of cornstarch at the end cause we like a thicker sauce. Used fresh rosemary from my garden - great dish!

Very successful, easy weeknight dinner. I used boneless pork chops, and they came out plenty tender. I reheated the chops in the sauce for a few moments at the end. Used thyme, which I had growing in a pot, instead of rosemary. The sauce was good, and plentiful; next time I'd make a starch, like wild rice, that would be good as a base for extra sauce.

Lovely recipe..I think those who needed thickening were expecting a panful of "gravy"...you should end up with about 2 TBS of SAUCE for each chop. I'm going to try it next with some black fig vinegar..and pork tenderloins cooked the same way and finished in a hot oven for a crowd1 I also wanted to say to the reviewers that said the pork was dry.. don't blame that on the recipe. Pork in the USA is now modified to be TOO lean, so less calories, less cholesterol, less Flavor, less juiciness! Those of us who are old enough remember when pork and beef came with a layer of fat and marbeling and it was so much more flavorful

Rating: 3
I followed the recipe to the letter, and it came out really well. To the others who complained about the sauce not thickening enough, I think the problem is with their definition of "thick." It shouldn't be a gravy, but a nice reduced sauce. If you let it reduce the full 10 minutes, you'll have a wonderful velvety sauce.

Rating: 4
This recipe is very easy and really tasty. I too had to add some corn starch to the sauce bcz it didn't thicken at all. I also saved the fried garlic and added it to to sauce before serving. YUM! The chops were a little tough, but that may have been my fault. I think this could also be prepared using chicken breasts. I served it w/ wide noodles and carrots with a honey/mint glaze.

Made this for 2 people and used 2 8 oz chops. Increased cook time only slightly and was fully cooked yet still moist. Instead of crossing picket lines to get red wine vinegar I substituted roughly 1 tbs each of dijon mustard and caper juice, and it was delicious. I will prepare exactly the same way next time. I added a bit of flour as well to thicken the sauce.

This has become 2 family members' birthday dinner each year. It's awesome!! The sauce is distinctly different and silky smooth. I've made only two changes. First, I spread flour on the pan drippings before adding any liquid (I'm a southern cook - I can't help it) to thicken the sauce and I use fat-free 1/2 & 1/2 instead of whipping cream with no noticeable difference.

Sauce is fantastic. Added the shallots, as advised, and the sauce was tangy and rich. Rasberry vinegar adds a nice and noticeable flavor.

I followed advice from other reviewers and boiled sauce 5 minutes, added cream, boiled 5 more minutes and added a cornstarch slurry with cold water to thicken sauce. I used thick boneless pork chops #2 and kept sauce ingredients the same except for reducing red wine vinegar to 3 tsp. I loved having extra sauce and it was a perfect flavor, not too vinegary. Easy to make and very tasty. I added to my repeat recipe file.

Like the Cook from Phoenix on 5/27/02, see below, I used pork tenderloin and followed those directions. Thanks, Phoenix! As most reviewers noted, the sauce does need thickening. I used a cornstarch slurry, just a small amount, which worked perfectly. One reviewer said to mix cornstarch with hot water. Not a good idea, it clumps up. Always mix cornstarch with cold water or another cold liquid. About those fried garlic slices which the recipe said to discard, I sprinkled them on my mashed potatoes. Delicious, and I wish I'd made more! I returned my cooked pork slices to the sauce when it was nearly done to rewarm them and that was a good idea. We'll make this pork recipe again for sure.

I have made this recipe several times and think the sauce is wonderful. Last time I made it I used pork tenderloins and this is the only way I will make it in the future. Cut the pork tenders into approx 1 1/2 in chunks and flatten (I use a rolling pin). Then follow the receipe as normal. I found the pork chops too tough for this wonderful sauce. Using pork tenderloins is the perfect addition in my opinion.

As suggested by other reviwers I used skim milk instead of cream, added mushrooms (a mixture of crimini, button, and shiitake), and thickened the sauce with cornstarch. I loved the result!! The pork took longer to cook than anticipated, but the sauce was wonderful, and served with glazed carrots, steamed asparague, and garlic mashed potatoes it made a delightful and easy evening dinner!!

I have made this recipe three times now, and have enjoyed it each time. The last time I made it I added some sliced mushrooms to the sauce mixture. I also simmered the browned chops very gently for a few minutes(probably 15-20). Very nice. Try it, if you are looking for something a bit upscale, yet not too out there. A pretty good week day dish.

Very good and very easy. I used home-made chicken stock so only used 3/4 cup. After the pork chops were done browning I took them out and added 3 large shallots, sliced thin, with a little more oil, and covered them - cooked them on a little higher heat to actually brown them a little since they were going to be in a sauce - then added the liquid. Thickened the sauce with at most a tablespoonful of flour (no cornstarch in the kitchen!) Bought a 12-pack of chops so definitely will make this one again.

This recipe was easy but tasted much more complex. I used sherry instead of the white wine, and used red wine vinegar. I think the sherry brought out a level to the dish. I also used low fat milk and corn starch as other people had done. (my boyfriend was dumbfounded that it was a low fat dish!) Unfortunately, the only pork chops I had were pretty thin, but it still turned out well. Next time I'll stick with the thicker ones.

Another great recipe. I took another cooks advice and added sauteed mushrooms and shallots, as well as, some cornstarch to thicken. The pork was extremely tender and delicious.

Pork chops were something I stayed away from, (too dry and tough--why bother?) but this recipe has changed my mind. A light crispiness on the outside, moist and tender on the inside.

I made this last night and it was delicious. I made it according to the recipe althought I used half and half instead of the cream. The sauce broke on me but still tasted wonderful. Next time I'll add the cream after the sauce reduces and see how it goes.

I made asparagus risotto as a side dish and finished the bottle of wine with dinner. A wonderful meal that I would br proud to serve my guests.

This is one of the best pan sauces that I've ever tasted! We loved it and easy to do. We could not find fresh rosemary the day we wanted to make it, so we substituted dried tarragon instead - will definitely try with rosemary next time, but tarragon was terrific. I also agree with other reviewers that adding some sauteed mushrooms would be a nice variation. We forgot to discard the garlic slices and left them in throughout cooking the chops. They became slightly crispy and added a nice character to the sauce. I would not hesitate to serve to guests on a holiday, but easy enough to make on a weeknight!

A wonderful dish. I used the recipe as a base and added my own touch. (I'm not one to stick directly to recipes). This is a little more time consuming but well worth it! Fry 1 piece of bacon in skillet. Remove and eat or feed to someone you love. Add olive oil and 3 cloves of fresh minced garlic. Saute. Add 1 more tablespoon of olive oil and a tablespoon of butter. Add 1 small onion sliced & 3/4 cup fresh sliced mushrooms. Saute. Remove and set aside. Rub pork with coriander & poultry seasoning and coat with flour (mixed with salt, pepper, rosemary, cumin, garlic powder, herbs de provence and thyme). Add fresh rosemary on top of chop and sear chops about 5 mins/side. Remove. Add "homemade" chicken broth, white wine, whipping cream, rosemary,and red wine vinegar. Reduce until somewhat thick. Add chops, and sauteed mushrooms, garlic, and onions. Cover and simmer over med-low heat about 20 minutes, turning chops twice. Add a little extra wine and cream as needed to keep sauce from becoming too thick. Remove chops when done and if needed, thicken sauce by increasing heat (do not cover). Place chops on plate and spoon sauce on top. (I served this with mashed potatoes and fresh corn on the cob). Email me pros/cons if you try it!!!!

I'm making this tomorrow evening for the second time and can't wait to sink my teeth into it ... the sauce is delicious and easy to make too. This is one of my favorite recipes.

Everyone was right - the sauce is to die for! Delicious! I doubled the recipe, used 4 tsp of wine vinegar and 4 tsp of red wine, and added the cream after sauce had boiled for five minutes, boiled for another 5 minutes and then added some flour to thicken the sauce more. Got rave reviews - a definite addition to my repertoire!

This is the house staple for pork chops. Awesome flavors with smoked pork chops.

Excellent. Had a stronger Rosemary flavor than you would expect from only 1 tsp. Sauce didn't thicken like I would have liked, but was still good.

Ditto on the need to reduce before adding the cream. This isn't super fancy, but it is easy and satisfying. In addition, the ingredients are readily available. Applesauce seems to go with this very well, as one might expect.

This recipe is delicious. The sauce definitely needs to be reduced before adding the cream. I often double it and save the leftover sauce to put over chicken another night. It can be warmed up by using a double boiler (or just submerging the bottom of the sauce container in boiling H2O). When it's doubled it can take a while to reduce. If you do not have the time to wait, you can cheat by adding a little cornstarch mixed with H2O.

The chops were great. I didn't have any cream or milk so I added a couple of tablespoons of butter. The taste was wonderful.

My family absolutely loved this dish. Even my 1 1/2 year old daughter couldn't get enough. I didn't have any white wine in the house, so I substituted cognac and it was great. I used the raspberry vinegar and it gave it a subtle sweet raspberry flavor. Next time, I think I might use thyme instead of rosemary.

It sounded SO good, but I was very disappointed. The pork needed to be cooked longer than stated and ended up dry; although the sauce turned out very very good(I took a previous reviewers advice and reduced it before adding the cream). Maybe doubling the sauce would make up for the dryness.

Sauce needed thickening, suggest reducing it before adding the cream.

This is a wonderful recipe. The sauce was great and the chops were very tender.

Chops were tender and the sauce was delicious - you must use fresh rosemary, as that makes the sauce. I needed to cook the chops about 10 minutes per side as they were still a little pink after just seven.

This was so simple and so tasty. Added a little more flour to pan drippings before making the sauce and it thickened up better than the first time I made it. This is a regular at my house now. I love the sauce over white rice.

I claimed not to like pork chops until I tried this. Excellent tasting and simple enough to prepare. Filling but not over-stuffing. Worked well in a cast-iron skillet.

Great Chops, maybe cut the vinegar down to 2 teaspoons, if you don't like a strong vinagar taste.

This was the most tender method of cooking pork I've ever encountered. The rosemary added a delicious fresh tingle to the dish. I too had a little difficulty getting my sauce to thicken, but fixed it with a teaspoon of cornstarch dissolved in a little hot water. My picky little brother said it was the best pork he'd ever had!

I absolutely love this recipe. It is truley delicious. I have made this dish many times. My boyfriend constantly requests it!!!!! I make it with goat cheese mashed potatoes and asparagus tips.

Really good, but I had problems with the sauce. It did not thicken. Has anyone else had this problem?

Wonderful, and so quick and easy to make! I didn't have the rosemary so I substituted tarragon, which I'm sure changed the entire complextion of the dish, but it worked out just great. The sauce was yummy with garlic mashed potatoes. I'd recommend this for any occassion-- great when company is coming or when you just need to throw something together after work.

This is really easy and excellent! I, too, would double the sauce because it's so good. It's a diversion from basic pork chops and tastes even better the next day.

Easy and delicious. A great feature of this recipe is that (with the exception of the cream) we always have the ingredients in the pantry and freezer.

I printed off this recipe and gave it to my husband tonight, leaving him to follow the instructions. The only suggestions I made was that he trim most of the fat (and skin) off the pork chops and to substitute the 4 teaspoons of red wine vinegar with 2 tsp wine vinegar and 2 tsp red wine, since we did not have the former. He served it with boiled rice and broccoli. I really liked the sauce but there was not enough of it. Next time, and there will be a next time, I shall try doubling the sauce.

Substitued cranberry juice for the vinegar for an interesting derivation.

Great recipe. We used the extra sauce with mashed potatoes on the side for a very satisfying dinner.

We loved this recipe! The sauce made the dish. My husband talked about it for weeks, and it is easy (and inexpensive) to make! We will definately have this again!
