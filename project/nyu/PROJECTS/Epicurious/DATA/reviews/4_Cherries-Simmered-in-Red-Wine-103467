We could eat gallons of it. Perfect with a dollop of (barely) sweetened, whipped mascarpone

Delicious! I used slightly less (3 C) wine and reduced it to 1 cup, but kept all the other measurements the same. Served it alongside a baked ricotta pudding.

Fabulous over Bluebell's homemade vanilla ice cream.

I made this last weekend for a small dinner party and I am making it again this weekend. We had them served over Nigella Lawson's Madeira Cake with brown sugar/ lemon whipped cream. This is a very versatile recipe! Fantastic! A++++++

Light and rich at the same time. A great way to celebrate cherry season. I think next time I would add a dab of marscapone on top to cut the sweetness a bit, as suggested by another reviewer.

This was so easy and adaptable. I only had frozen cherries and no orange peel. I reduced some oj and added half to the wine mixture and poured half over the cherries while they were cooling. I topped it with sweetened mascarpone for a nice light dessert. My kids were drinking the left-over juice!

Wow! So, so good and easy. I served it over vanilla ice cream. I also added a cup of tiny macerated champagne grapes at the end(see the recipe for Macerated grapes in clove and cinnamon syrup). Their crispy little snap made a nice contrast against the meaty texture of the cherries.

Heavenly. Wonderful for guests.

I used the fairly cheap Chianti that I use to make red sauce and served it over vanilla ice cream. I didn't find it too sweet, but maybe that's just me. I thought it was quite good and I liked it better just by itself.

YUM YUM!!!!! This is so simple and soooo good! We enjoyed it with some crunchy biscotti. A perfect summer dessert. Some may want to decrease the sugar a bit - it is quite sweet - but great the way it is, too.

This a truely AWESOME. I used sangria red wine with natural flavors. I doubled the recipe because we were having company but I used only 2 cups of sugar. They loved it. We served it in champagne, on vanilla ice cream, and in glasses of sangria. They all wanted the recipe. I plan to make it again and freeze for future guests.

It is too bad that fresh cherries are not available all year long. Try it,"you'll like it"
