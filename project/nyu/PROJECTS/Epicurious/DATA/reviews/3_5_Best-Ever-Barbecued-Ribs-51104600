Everyone in the family gets excited when they see the preparation for these ribs begin. This is a wonderful, easy way to make delicious, fork tender ribs. They are great for entertaining, because the only thing left to do when guests arrive is warm them on the grill while mopping with sauce (all the mess is outside). Be sure you are using Kosher salt in the rub, 2 T is just right if you do. Bon appetit!

This was great! The recipe steps are quick and easy, very little mess or cleanup. I agree with others that there's too much salt, but just cut it down a little and it's a great recipe. I used beer instead of chicken broth to mix with the juice from the ribs. I probably charred them a little too much on the grill, but that was my fault. They were delicious anyway, and it was my first time making ribs.

I think BBQ ribs always bring out the heated debate! For this cook from BBQ-challenged parts who had never made ribs before, this recipe was easy, delicious, and a big hit. Lovely char, very tender meat.

This really is great. Comes out the same every time. The only change I'd make is to cut the salt in 1/2 (or more) The ribs were almost too salty.

I made the ribs twice. Rave reviews. Very easy to do, just takes some time. The barbecue sauce listed online was declicious with it.

@ Burnzoid Big difference between a mop and a sauce. My homemade sauce has lotsa spices, peppers and brown sugar. Sugar burns and will ruin the boys. Most off the shelf sauce has lots of sugar. A good mop is a brine based, well peppered vinegar/beer combo. Been at this for 50 years and change...check out my avatar.

To those who say the rub is too salty: are you using the kosher salt that the recipe calls for? If not,that's almost certainly the problem.

Not only the recipe sounds great, but the picture looks so darn good I think I'll take a bite out of my computer monitor.

My husband absolutely loves that he can make these the night before our parties, and then spend just a few minutes grilling them. No more missing the festivities to man the flame--not to mention this cooking method yields truly delicious ribs (we've only used baby backs)!!

This is a recipe? Rub ribs with a few ingredients, cook and then add either commercial or homemade bbq sauce of your choosing? This "recipe" is filling space.

Sorry, but if you were a Martian new to Q you might get a buzz off these, but this is pretty lame fare. Marinade the boys for a few days, then dry rub, then smoke at 180 degrees for a few hours and finally grill on high heat for the crust. Sauce is served at the table.

Ahem...to: a cook from Waynesville, NC. You'll have to explain the difference, then, between BBQ and smoking, or are they the same thing? Grilling is correctly identified with hot dogs, burgers and steaks...maybe other things too, cooked fast and hot on a grill. But your statement that "real" BBQ only slathers sauce on at the table in incorrect. I've been to the Kings several times and to numerous contests from Texas to Colorado to yup...NC and many if not most of the contestants mop on the grill after smoking to add a moist glaze at the end of the smoking/BBQ process. And please, it's not just people from the south who know how to properly handle a slab of ribs...or a whole hog for that matter. My thoughts are that whatever blows your skirt up...go with it. That means...we're all right no matter what one calls it.

i think this is a really good recipe though instead of the store bought sauce why not do your own seems to me that would be all yours!!!!

I'd agree with reducing the amount of salt. That can be adjusted with the sauce you use...especially if you make your own. The other issue that is important to remember with baby-back ribs is to remove the membrane on the bone side of the slab. When you massage in your rub it will season the ribs more thoroughly and they'll take more of the sauce when you put them on the grill. Otherwise...a good recipe.

When are Yankees gonna learn the difference between Barbecue and grilling? Please, editors, devote some "equal air time" to honor the way it's done in St. Louis, Kansas City, North Carolina, etc. The sauce goes on at the table, folks!

Great recipe. The outcome is greatly determined by the sauce. When people ask for a recipe, it's a complement, not a raving review.

Haven't made these yet but I want to see how they compare to my version of best-ever BBQ ribs. Mine are almost labor-free and taste out of the world. Everyone who's ever had them wants the recipe. It's one of the first recipes I posted on my food blog. http://www.fransfavs.com/2011/05/bbq-spareribs/

These are fantastic. As I was collecting the juices and rewrapping the ribs I was sneaking little bits of meat, which was delicious even before the BBQ sauce and grilling. I didnt find them salty even though I used the whole amount of salt called for. The only problem was they didnt have that charred/lacquered taste, but that was a grilling error (need higher heat), not a problem with the recipe! Will definitely be making these again!

Great ribs! Yes, use less salt. I didn't feel like turning on the oven, so I wrapped the ribs tightly in foil and put them to slow cook on the grill, away from the flame. Then I followed the rest of the cooking directions. Worked beautifully, and they were definitely falling off the bone. Yum!

IF only I had read a few reviews before I made this the SALT situation would have been corrected. Entirely too much salt. I agree with another viewer and perhaps the recipe should read 2 1/2 tsps instead of TBSPS. Cooking method was great, fall off the bone delicious!

The cooking technique for these ribs is fantastic--well done ribs with plenty of flavor. I did not care for the sauce--next time I will use my own.

Following the lead of others, reduced salt by almost half. Amazingly tender and flavorful, and so convenient to prepare the day before and finish on the grill just before serving. Used Stubbs barbecue sause, which is less sweet than many, but not sure of its availability outside of Texas.

We have now made these three times. The first time was just a tad salty, so I have since reduced the salt by 1/2. First time also did not yield any juice to mix with the bbq sauce but learned if you let the ribs rest/cool in the foil, it will give you juices. Best. Ribs. Ever. Period.

Next time I will use my own barbecue sauce--BUT the cooking method makes for fantastic ribs.

Wonderful recipe that I will definitely use again. I agree with other reviewers that it was too salty so the second time, I reduced the salt by half. I used Rufus Teague BBQ sauce -- just delicious!

Delish and a hit for my hubby and I. We will make it again.

The ribs were good but they were very, very salty.

Simple to make and delicious! I took Bon Appetit's advice and used Kraft Thick & Spicy BBQ Sauce. Since I didn't have a grill, I added 1 tsp of hickory liquid smoke to the dry rub and another tsp to the BBQ sauce. I also added the jus from the ribs to the sauce (skim off most of the fat), then I simmered it down to a nice, thick, consistency. Slather on the ribs and broil in the oven for about 10 minutes. Served it with an avocado salad from this site. My fiance won't let me give away the leftovers!

These were indeed the best-ever ribs. However I think there was a problem with the recipe as written.... too much salt! I think it should have been 2 1/2 teaspoons, not tablespoons of salt. Also, add 4 ice cubes to the bottom of the rib rack to steam the ribs and ensure a lot of drippings. Also important to make in the morning (or day before) to refrigerate both the ribs and sauce (to skim fat) prior to final preparation. Enjoy this winner!

Yes, this makes for easy entertaining. My husband liked the ribs better than I did. I will be serving them up for our fourth of July party. I used KC Masterpiece barbeque sauce and separated the rib juices from the fat by letting the juices sit awhile and separate on their own before mixing with the BBQ sauce, not using the fat.

So good!!!! Super easy. I made them early in the day then finished them on the grill later. I did mix juices in with the barbecue sauce and it was fantastic

So easy to make and so yummy! I made baby back ribs. I didn't have juices, just fat, but I did mix some of it in with the bbq sauce for flavor. I used this for glazing on the grill and just served regular BBQ on the side for those who wanted extra. Had no problem keeping the ribs together on the grill, however, when slicing to serve, I recommend slicing every third rib to keep them together and better presentation.

We made these in the oven a day before grilling. They were fantastic! We didn't have any pan juices to mix with the bbq sauce (only fat probably b/c we did it with spare ribs instead of baby back), so we just mixed all broth with the sauce. The ribs do fall apart easily so be careful grilling.
