I used two 32-oz cartons of chicken stock and bumped up to 2.5 cups of lentils. I also used 3 tsp of cumin. We love this soup. It has become a comfort food favorite.

Thought it was great, I used two Korr chicken stock pods and 7 cups of water and it turned out super. When I poured it in the bowl, I added the lemon which was a great taste. But I ate a little more in a different bowl and added a teaspoon of peanut butter and that was also a great taste. Just mix it in and enjoy!

My Tunisian father and stepmother cook this soup every year at Ramadan and this recipe is rather accurate to my familiarity with its taste. If you follow this recipe you may need to add more stock or water as you're cooking to maintain the right consistency. Part of the issue people who run out of liquid face may come from cooking the lentils at too high of a temperature. If you boil rather than simmer the lentils, your liquid will disappear faster, possibly contributing to what seems like a miscalculation of liquid in the recipe. A few other notes are to take it easy on the cumin, add a small amount at a time and taste before adding more as cumin is a spice that not everyone loves a lot of. Add a pinch or 2 of hot or regular paprika and turmeric when adding the spices. And in the beginning when lightly browning the onions in olive oil, add some garlic, about 1/2 tsp. minced for a more authentic flavor. Also, don't listen to the person who said not to add lemon. This dish is traditionally served with lemon and the flavors of the soup are beautifully complemented by it. Its best to serve lemon wedges as described in the recipe and let each person add as much lemon as they like to their bowl. Lastly, often Arabic cuisine is eaten with oven toasted french style or flat bread, rather than croutons made of white loaf bread. White (or wheat) loaf bread tends to become very soggy (even in crouton form) instead of retaining its shape/texture with liquid. Technically this soup doesn't really even need bread with it as it is starchy on its own. If you don't add anything, make it the croutons rather than the lemon/spices. If you do feel the need for more carbs, than try a crusty french loaf sliced or cubed (if you realllly want croutons) and toasted, no need to brush olive oil on it, we generally don't as it just makes it a little greasier especially when you toast it.

Excellent lentil soup. Tastes like the original I used to eat in Abu Dhabi.

A really nice soup. To my surprise I found that the croutons had absorbed some of the lemon juice, which gave them a teriffic flavor.

Just made this today, and I like it! I think it's one of those recipes that is really simple but depends on good quality ingredients. I used my fav brand of chicken stock and freshly ground cumin. Yum!

Awesome authentic tasting soup. Am only giving 3- fork rating as had to use 10 cups of liquid, and even then the consistency was still a lot thicker than traditional lentil soup (just ran out of pot space)!! My hubby and I are working overseas and this was our first iftar meal of Ramadan 1429 (2008)!!

I made this soup for my husband and he loved it. He's not a huge fan of lentils, but he's only had the common brown kind. After the lentils cooked, I added some cooked squash I needed to use up (didn't affect the flavor but added nutrition), and decreased the cumin to just over a tsp. Even then my DH said it was too much. The lemon and croutons made the soup. I definitely recommend their added touch. Thanks for a great, simple, healthy recipe!

I've made this recipe twice and it was delicious both times. The second time, I added a tsp. of chopped ginger root to the onions to add another flavor...it came it quite well.

I have been looking for a lentil soup recipe similar to what I've tasted in Middle Eastern restaurants. This is it. However, some simplification is in order. 6 cups of liquid requires only ONE cup lentils. Otherwise you'll get porridge, not soup. I increased the cumin to 1 tbsp. and halved the salt and pepper. Croutons are unnecessary. And DO NOT add lemon juice-- or any other spices. Keep it simple and delicious.

Not sure what's up with that last review but I thought this was delicious. It's quick, easy, and tasty (and I'm not a huge fan of lentils!). The cumin flavor pairs well with the lentils. Made it as per recipe but added some chicken wings I had around to the boil, removed them before pureeing. Added a teaspoon of chili powder. At first it came out more like humous so I added some more water to get the consistancy right. Served with couscous and Persian Honey Chicken. Awesome.
