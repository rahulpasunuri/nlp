I had a bunch of fresh apricots to use up and a colleagues birthday came up; I made this in the evening the night before and it was quick and beautiful. I did halve the sugar and butter for the topping per the reviews, and it was nicely topped; next time I might try doing 3/4 just for kicks, but the cake was light and fluffy (worth the time it takes to beat) and it got rave reviews from my co-workers. The only one not happy was my housemate who had to smell it baking that night and watch it marched out the door without getting to try a slice in the morning!

My sister has a wonderful apricot three that is producing more then we all can eat. So I found this recipe and just made it. YUM! So good, I will do a bit of a healthier version next time, cut the sugars in half but other then that, I say go now and bake one. You won't regret it!

Additionally...like many other cooks mentioned, we halved the butter and decreased the brown sugar to 1.2 c. I also substituted some whole wheat flour as A Cook from Eagle Rock recommended, did NOT peel the apricots, and used a deep enough skillet that we had no spill-over.

A friend dropped off enough home grown apricots that my family had no idea what to do with them until we found: Fresh Apricot Upside-Down Cake! Judging from the insightful reviews here, I placed the apricots skin-side down in the skillet and it came out perfectly. One mishap along the way: I added the eggs prematurely to the butter & sugar mixture...so I whipped it at high speed in the stand mixer and all was fine. Our lunchtime guests in loved this cake and my Mom said it was far better than the same one her mother used to bake. Win!

Very soft, almost pudding like. Lovely flavor. I think nuts would add nice textural contrast. And creme fraiche or a buttermilk ice cream would be perfect with this. Do include cookie sheet under; did have trouble with butter drips and smoke in the oven.

A lovely, rustic cake. I followed the directions except for cutting down butter (1/4 c.) and sugar (1/2 c.) in topping. Mine only needed 30 minutes in the oven. Very moist and delicious. I will make it again to serve with vanilla ice cream.

A few caveats --- the apricots over- carmelized when I followed the recipe's instruction to place the 'cots cut side down. An old Italian recipe advised skin side down. I used 1 cup white whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup unbleached white flour, and 1/4 cup oat bran for more flavor and "to make it healthy." Thanks to those who suggested cutting down on butter in the topping!

Oh yes, this was really rather good. I didn't have enough fresh apricots to cover the bottom of my 10" cake tin, so, placed pineapple chunks in the gaps. (My skillet won't fit in my pathetic small oven, darn.) Made the caramel in a non-stick saucepan and just poured it into the cake tin. Very pretty when turned out for serving. Subbed 1/2 c of ground almonds for 1/2 c of the flour and upped the almond extract a bit. I will be making this often with other fruits!

This is a nice little cake. I followed the many suggestions to cut back on the butter and sugar in the topping (1/4 cup butter and 1/2 cup brown sugar) and it was perfect. I also filled in the gaps in the topping with some halved fresh cherries that I had. It browned rather quickly in the oven but when I checked the doneness it was still wobbly in the middle so it needed more time. I put a piece of foil on top of the cake while it finished baking so it wouldn't brown anymore. Will defintely make again.

Just made this cake and it is hot out of the oven, smells wonderful and looks beautiful. So easy to make and the crumbs I snitched( to hot to eat) are delicious. If I could submit a pic I would.

We got fresh apricots (a flat) from a relative. After much search on this website, I decided to use this recipe to reduce my apricot stash. This recipe turned out great, my kitchen was filled with the aroma of brown sugar and butter! I made this using a regular nonstick skillet coz I don't own a cast-iron, it turned out perfect! I cut back the butter to 1/2 stick and 1/2 cup of brown sugar for the topping like everyone else suggested. You will not regret just follow the recipe, use buttermilk ... for some reason it bring out the best of everything.

This came out great! I had to substitute some half & half with lemon juice for the buttermilk and that seemed to work fine. I did also cut the butter to 1 stick and used 1/2 cup of browm sugar as suggested by others. Everyone really enjoyed this cake and I will definitely experiment with other fruits such as pineapple, peaches and plums. Hey, why not?

Rating: 2
As written, the cake is pretty good but I didn't rate it higher b/c there is way too much butter and sugar in the topping. Also agree with previous reviewers that there could be more fruit - the cake part is delicious but there is a lot of it. I did make a modified version of the cake and with changes, would rate the recipe 3 forks. Changes I made: reduced butter topping to 1/4 cup and sugar to 1/2 cup (as suggested by previous reviewer); increased fruit; added nuts and cinnamon to the topping. Delicious with simple modifications. Would work well with almost any summer fruit or berries.

This was great and came out looking just like the photograph. I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup flax meal as part of the flour ingredient for a little more texture and that tasted great. I will use less butter for the topping next time cause it was ALOT of butter and I think less would be fine. WARNING: place a cookie sheet under the skillet to bake cause mine bubbled out hot butter all over the bottom of the stove and then smoked like crazy (maybe using less butter would resolve that). I didn't peel my apricots but the skins bake up super soft, you can't even tell they are on there. Also don't worry that the half apricots seem too rounded up in the base of the skillet, they cook down nice and flat and my cake came easily out of the skillet (I used cast iron) and onto the serving plate. I really loved this recipe!

As it wasn't apricot season, I used fresh peaches. It was very good. Next time I will decrease the butter for the topping to 1/4 cup (1/2 stick).

This recipe is simple and really good. It's easy to make and everyone always raves about how good it is - apricots, peaches, plums, nectarines, apples. It doesn't matter which fruit you choose, it's always a winner. I've made it several times with whichever fruit happens to be in season and it hasn't failed me yet. It is a little bit sweet with all that sugar, so I started using less of each and it still comes out just fine. Reminds me of something my grandmother might have made - very homey.

Lovely summer treat! Fresh apricots are bland to eat out of hand, but really come to life when cooked, skins and all, in this rustic cake. We used a 10" stainless steel saute pan, whisked flour mixture instead of sifting, and skipped the almond extract.

This cake turned out great. I used 1/4 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of brown sugar in the topping - which was plenty, and it made a nice carmelized topping.

I thought there was too much cake so cut the batter in half. Delicious.

Just... yum. I made this with 2 large nectarines instead of the apricots - absolutely delicious. I suspect you could use just about any fruit with this and it would work. I was looking for a recipe to use up some buttermilk, and came upon this. I don't bake cakes much but this was one of the less complicated from-scratch cakes I've ever made and wow is it good! It looked soggy when it first came out of the pan (all that butter with the fruit!) but firmed up upon standing (and is holding up well the next morning - I had to taste a bit, in the name of science ;-). I might try cutting the butter in the bottom of the skillet just a bit next time.

A delicious version of upside-down cake. I used half the butter and half the sugar called for in the topping and it was just fine. Cake is wonderfully moist, fluffy and flavorful. This will be a staple in our house during apricot season!!

I made this in my cast iron skillet and it was fabulous. The cast iron heats evenly and makes for a better choice of baking pan. I cut the apricots into quarters instead of halves to have more pieces of apricot per bite. I also chopped up dried apricots and put them between the spaces. It's delicious.

This is a truly special recipe. I make it only when apricots are fresh in the market. We look forward to having it once or twice each spring. We especially enjoy the effect that almond flavoring has on the apricots. A really nice combination. There are several ways to enhance that (e.g. adding sliced almonds or almond flavored liqueur). Simple to make and it's very tasty.

This recipe is simple to make..but far away too much butter, errrrr..the butter smell made me dizzy when hot.. It tasted delicious though after letting it cool down. I used mangos instead of abricots.. they were great.. I'll make it again but with much less butter.

This was one of the nicest desserts I have made. I used canned apricots and they were delicious. I might use a little less butter in the first step of the recipe but other than that it was perfect! I served it with vanilla ice-cream.

All I can say is MMMMMMMMMMmmmmm GOOOOOOOOOd. Had some apricots left over from my last visit to Okanogan, and that's by far the best use for them. Just add some whipped cream for the five star rating and enjoy !

I added blueberries with the apricots which worked nicely.I'm thinking of changing the topping next time,less butter ,maybe add some lemon zest.The cake is nice and moist and rich.

the cake was light and flavor offset the apricots nicely. Used an 11 inch skillet and slightly larger apricots- it still worked great. Makes a nice presentation.

This cake was a really delicious way of showcasing fresh apricots. The fruit carmelizes and creates a lovely sauce for the light but rich cake. Make sure you don't use too hot of a pan to prepare the topping. I would suggest serving it warm with vanilla ice cream, or at room temp. with some whipped cream sweetened with maple syrup.

I was disappointed with this recipe. Cake was bland and almost dryish, apricot flavor was not absorbed into cake. Will not make this again. In my opinion, there are far better upside-down cake recipes on Epicurious--Rhubarb Anise and Blackberry.

Very good recipe. Not too difficult and the results were excellent. Very nice presentation. I brought it into the office and everyone loved it. Followed the lead of other reviewers and served it with vanilla haagen daaz. I'm glad I did. It was a really nice touch. I'll definitely make this again.

I used a 9" cake pan instead of a skillet. I also used some pitted sweet cherries in between the apricot halves. Very good the first day after baking, but the cake portion was a little too wet on the second day.

Merci beaucoup to the cook from Arlington. I'll try again (not burning the sugar this time!)

Mmmm...this is a yummy summer treat. The tanginess of the apricots was a nice addition to a familiar upside down cake recipe. To the cook from Provence, I'm guessing that you may have used dark brown sugar or that you burned the sugar when it was on the stove. You should have brown goo, not black goo!

I made individual ones for my restaurant! Cut the apricots in 8 equal parts. Choose ripe, tasty apricots (nectarines are great too), a good quality of butter; remember "the only star in a kitchen is the good ingredient" I served the cakes with a nice quenelle of pistachio ice cream, and some apricot coulis.
