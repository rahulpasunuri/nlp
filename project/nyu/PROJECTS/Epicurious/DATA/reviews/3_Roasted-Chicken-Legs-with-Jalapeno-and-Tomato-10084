Made yesterday, it was great.. had to use lemon which is a sub for lime. Used all veggies from our garden, It was very good will make again soon,

Very tasty and easy to make. I used a half can of chopped tomatoes and herbs instead of the fresh plum tomatoes, and that worked well. I also used half a habanero instead of the jalapenos to give it a bit more kick.

Try roasting the cumin before adding it to the lime juice and olive oil. It elevates the taste several degrees.

I'm giving this 4 forks for the simplicity and great flavor. Thanks to the many reviewers for several suggestions: cooked the legs for 15 minutes before adding the "veggies" and added 1 tsp cumin and 1tsp oregano to the lime mixture. Great flavor and so simple and quick!

Only 3 forks because I had to make the following changes: Roast the chicken for 10-15 minutes alone first, I usually do it at 500 degrees to get the skin extra crispy. Then I turn the heat back down to 400-425 and add the vegetables and continue on. That way everything finishes at the same time. I also usually use way more lime juice than it calls for, and it's hard to restrain myself on the olive oil but I've ruined it on occasion with too much. I used to make this once a week for years, then stopped fro a few years, and now it's back in rotation.

Delicious! Used chicken thighs and cherry tomatoes, and I let the chicken cook for about 15 minutes before adding the vegetables. The vegetables and the chicken were both perfectly cooked. I will definitely make this dish again.

I was very disappointed; I followed the recipe but the end result was characterless.

The chicken cooked easily in 1/2 and hour, but tomatoes, onions and jalapeños burned to the point of being unusable. I would try again, but add the veggies after 10 minutes of roasting the chicken on its own.

Oh my gosh this was awesome! Reading through the recipe I also thought as one previous reviewer did that it sounded just like chicken and salsa, good - but not thrilling. But I had had these legs in the freezer so long....and I had all the other stuff... So glad I tried it! The roasting gives the garlic a deep, sweet flavor, the tomatos become more complex..... fabulous! Definately not chicken and salsa.

I love this recipe! Quick, easy, with simple ingredients. I use chicken breast on the bone, rather than the legs, but leave the recipe intact, otherwise. Great for "anynight."

I would give this a 2 1/2 if I could! It was a good recipe, I took the advice of previous reviewers and added cumin and extra veggies. It was so simple and tasty! Next time I would add more garlic and jalapenos and serve it over brown rice mixed with black beans! A hearty and easy meal!

The chicken was very tender and the "salsa" had a wonderful flavor.

I came cruising for a recipe out of necessity. I had a whole chicken and a couple of jalapenos waiting to be eaten. I found this and gave it a try using what I had...a whole chicken which I cut up, the jalapenos, grape tomatoes, onions, shallot, and garlic... I added cumin based on another reviews comments and cooked the whole lot according to the recipe method. The end result was delectable and the kitchen smelled wonderful. Tonight I am trying it again only with boneless chicken breasts, which I have cubed as is done for tikka masala recipes... Hopefully, served over rice, this will be a good way to get every lst drop of the tasty sauce. A solidly good and flexible/forgiving recipe.

Just a question; does this dish basically taste like chicken roasted with salsa? Because that is what it sounds like.

This was soooo good, and so easy to make. I did legs in one pan and breasts in another, doubled the amounts for the sauce. Bone in, skin on. Deelish!!! The sauce was oniony, yet not overpoweringly so. Soooo easy, yet so good. I cooked them for almost an hour, then reduced the sauce on the stove top with some wine, as I recall. Served with couscous and the roasted parsnip and butternut squash recipe also listed on epicurious. It was so easy and so good. I will definitely add this one into the sunday night rotation.

THE ENTREE WAS FANTASTIC, AFTER I MADE TWO SMALL YET DRAMATIC CHANGES, I'M PRETTY SURE IF SOMEONE TRIES IT AS WELL YOU'LL AGREE. THE FIRST WAS ROASTING THE GARLIC AND JALAPENO OVER AN OPEN FLAME IT GAVE IT A FANTASTIC HICKORY TASTE. I MADE IT TWICE ONE WITH A SPICY JALAPENO AND A MILD ONE THE HICKORY TASTE IS FABOULOUS BUT THE SPICINESS IS REALLY UP TO YOU.

Easy and delicious way to use fresh ripe tomatoes and jalapeno's. Used a whole cut up chicken instead, with more of all the vegetables. Had a pleasant spicy kick that tasted even better as leftovers.

I'd give this 2 and a half if I could. Its a perfect easy week night dinner. Tasty and quick with ingredients you're likely to have on hand. I used canned tomatoes (this time of year, always the better choice). The BF loved it. Will go into heavy rotation.

I have been making this recipe since it was published in the magazine in 1995. For a change of pace, sometimes I skip the tomotoes. It always takes much, much longer to cook the chicken through than just half an hour, though. Baked chicken in half an hour?

Rating: 3
Taking advice from other reviewers, I cooked the chicken by itself at 350 deg. for the first half-hour, then added the veggies. Used jalapenos from my garden, have to admit, must find another variety to grow next year, as I used 4, and they had NO HEAT! Added a little cumin for extra Southwest flavor. This is a great week day dish, and very economical, as grocery stores always run specials on the 10lb. bags of chicken leg quarters! Will definately be making again!

Great, easy recipe. Like many others, I put in more tomatoes, more peppers, which gave us more sauce.

This recipe was quick, easy but mostly delicious. I deskinned the chicken and cut off the fat to make this dish as low cal as possible. I also left the seeds in the jalapenos for extra heat. Will be looking forward to making this dish again! I used Campbell's canned chicken stock so I did not season the chicken with salt. Does anybody know of a name brand of a low salt chicken broth. I can't find one in my neck of the woods. Thanx

So flavorful and easy! Serve over rice with a side of pinto beans. Yum!

Just scrumptious, so easy! After reading other reviews, I used more tomatoes and jalapenos. I doubled the recipe and we'll have the other half tomorrow. Having just cleaned my oven (from cooking other chicken at 450 degrees), I decided to do this at 350, so I cooked it for an hour and added the veggies for the last half hour. No splattery mess.

This was a quick fix recipe we would make again. The next time I would add some cumin or cilantro - something to bring out more flavor. I did serve over rice with sauted onions and green chiles.

Yummmmmmeeeee!!! I love finding a good dish that calls for fresh jalepenos. Very easy to make. I followed the suggestion to serve this over rice, and I agree, it goes well. I think next time I may double the veggie part of this to have more for the rice. I can't wait to make it again!

Excellent dish. And it is so damn easy to make! Easy to get ingredients, easy to prepare, and the taste is amazing.

Agree with Lisa and the cook from San Francisco. This meal is a staple in our house. I add more jalapenos and the dish, especially the broth, comes out very tasty. I serve the chicken and rice in a pasta bowl with a generous serving of the broth. I also cook the chicken for half the time before adding the vegetables. This way the chicken gets golden brown and the vegetables come out perfect.

I agree with the last review and will probably add more jalapenos next time. Excellent sauce over rice! Chicken was tender and tasty.

Not as good as hoped - would use more jalapeno, maybe some tomato paste.

So simple and so great! This quickly has become one of my favorite (and quick) dishes. It's best with rice to soak up the excellent sauce.
