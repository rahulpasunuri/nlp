Made this for Christmas dinner. EXCELLENT! Not low fat but worth every fork full!

This is delicious. You only need a little bit to be satisfied, though it is definitely a splurge. I've made it a few times much to the delight of my guests.

This dish is a little too heavy on the mushroom flavor. If that's what your looking for, go for it! I was looking for a more traditional gratin with more cheesyness. This was not it.

Our gratin was incredible - rich flavors of the mushrooms combined with my favorite cheeses. It was rich, but worth the calories for a Thanksgiving celebration.

Unfortunately, this was a no for us. We did use fewer porcini mushrooms than suggested, but really, the true downer was the mascarpone. This was just not the right use for it, frankly. It separated and completely disappeared in the baking process. Perhaps some flour would have held this oily mess together, perhaps a sturdier cheese like a fontina. Overall, this was a real miss for us.

This was rich. My friends and I like ho it was not like a typical Au Gratin. It was creamy with the earthy tones ofthe porcini mushroom.

Had such high hopes with this recipe but I have to agree with pepsicolame that it's an expensive dish, but also a bland, greasy one. Cooked this on a Saturday night for a nice dinner and waited the 1:15 minutes for it to cook. The mushrooms and cheese mix both tasted great before baking. The mushrooms were buttery and delicious, the cheese was smooth and had the perfect hint of garlic. After baking, the potatoes were bland, the mushrooms bland, and the cheese became more of a pool of oil. I had to add parmesean to add some taste. It was much better after that but I had to schedule a bypass to get all the fat out of my arteries.

Simple and tasty, but a little time-consuming to make. This dish lasts in the refrigerator and makes for a good meal. You can't really taste the mascarpone, so using sour cream instead might be a cheaper idea. I would add more mushrooms next time. I also used portabella and white mushrooms - it really makes no difference.

Made this around Thanksgiving and will be making again this weekend for a family get- together. This recipe is delicious. It's very rich which may end up resulting in a greasy dish but it's good to splurge every once in a while. I used half porcini and 8 oz of cremini to reduce the cost. Leftovers (if there are any) are delicious - even cold.

This tasted sooo good before cooking it. Afterwards, it is so greasy and the marscapone cheese justs disappears. The potatoes did not cook def. needs much more cooking time.

We loved this recipe. I made it for 2 using 1 ounce of dried porcini's and the proportion was perfect. After sauteeing the chopped reconstituted mushrooms they shrink down. What was difficult was 'spreading' the cheese mixture. It was very thick.

I doubled this dish for a holiday party. I cut the porcini's in half due to the cost of them. The crowd loved it and all asked for the recipe. It had a wonderful blend of flavors and was not greasy at all. The only suggestion I have is for the recipe editors do a reality check on the cost of items before they recomend them in a recipe. Porcini mushrooms are $8 an ounce in my area, not worth a $64 one ingredient cost. Even with cutting the mushrooms in half, it is still way too expensive of an ingredient. When I make it again, it will be with a different type of affordable mushroom.

I had leftover portabellos that I used instead of porcini and they worked fine. Overall, this dish was rich, satisfying and impressed my guests

An answer to the issue of cost with this dish: I used goat cheese (unripened) and used sliced crimini mushrooms instead of the dried porcini. Granted the flavours of the marscapone and porcinis would be fantastic, but these alternatives worked very well. Other soft unripened cheeses would also work (cream cheese). The mushrooms were simply cooked in the oil and butter as stated in the recipe. To answer the "oily" issue, after cooking the mushrooms, I removed some of the residual oil in the pan.

This was fabulous - I agree however about being careful about the weight of mushrooms needed, I purchased 4 oz dried mushrooms ($7.00 an 4oz package) only to realize that the weight is definitely for reconstituted mushrooms. So I only used half of what I purchased for Christmas dinner, but they didn't go to waste :) The dish did turn out a little greasy, I served the dish off the main dining table so my guests didn't see the puddle of oils at the bottom of the baking dish - maybe a little flour in between a couple of the layers may have prevented that. Otherwise this was very very yummy and a big hit!

I made this and it was outstanding - however...I think the recipe may be worded oddly. I used 4 oz of porcini mushrooms, but 4 oz reconstituted weight, not dry weight and they weren't overpowering at all.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and everyone loved it. I do agree that four oz of mushrooms was a lot and expensive. I am making it again today for dinner and only am going to use 1 oz of mushrooms instead, that seems to be a good amount. I recommend this dish.

I used 2 ounces of porcini and 2 ounces shitake, and while the flavor was nice, I found it too greasy. It was gobbled up at Thanksgiving dinner, though. Would make again with a few changes.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was a huge hit! The porcini mushrooms added the perfect flavor to the dish. The sauce balanced the mushrooms beautifully, just rich enough without going overboard. There was barely enough for leftovers!

Not bad, but VERY expensive to make. Between the $16.00 for the mushrooms and $14.00 for the cheese I would not make this again. Taste to me was OK but not worth the money.

At my house, we call them "potato rotten." Stunk to heaven high. Way too many porcini's ... and yes, this made it a $50 dish which was tossed the next day. Glad my guests were gracious enough to choke down a few bites. This beauty has taken the prize as the worst Thanksgiving dish since we started keeping track -- about 110 years of Bon Appetit Thanksgiving recipes or since they strated publishing! No, I won't be cooking this one any time soon.

Delicious, with this variation: 4 ounces of dried porcinis is WAAAY too many. I used about 1 1/2 ounces, and it was perfect and got rave reviews. Not to mention porcinis are ridiculously expensive, so this made it a more affordable dish for a crowd.

Tasted like greasy mushrooms. Flavor of mascarpone was completely overpowered, as was the taste of potato.

Excellent gratin. Very creamy and the mushrooms make this outstanding!My guests could not stop raving!

The gratins are usually very good if the potatoes are first fried separately until about 75% done, and then baked. That way, you don't run the risk of serving raw potatoes, and also adds flavor.
