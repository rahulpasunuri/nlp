I was not too happy with the results on this bread. The measurements were wrong, and the recipe should have called for two pans. This happened to another recipe for food network. That too was a pumpkin bread recipe. I don't like wasting product. It is too expensive to be throwing things out today. The bread came out doughy, and I had to cut it up, and use another baking pan for it to finish cooking. I am very good at baking. So, it was not my fault.

.. really good take on the pumpkin.. I used regular baguette and added some ground cinnamon (not a cinna-raisin fan). We paired it with the pumpkin seed praline recipe on here and it paired delicously.

All previous reviews are right in some respect! I was put off by the direction to make it in 1 1/4 cup custard dishes. These are huge for individual portions, and I have nothing like that size. I used standard 1/2 c. ramekins, with half the ingredients, and made 6 of these smaller ones. I can see that it would be good warm, and/or with whipped cream, or any other sauce that has been mentioned. I would also try it in one large dish, and just consider it bread pudding. The taste is great, but the fabrication is more work than it is worth.

I've made this dish more than once, however I make in a large round dish. I change the liquor to rum and make the spiced rum sauce to go with it instead of the brulee topping. YUMMY!

First I have to say that I'm a real fan of pumpkin....so I'm starting a bit biased. BUT, my husband is not and he loved this! He even SUGGESTED I make it for his family for the holidays. THIS from a man who really doesn't like change - especially when it comes to food. I made this in one large caserole dish rather than individual ramekins and skipped teh topping it still was great.

Bread pudding is a fave in our home, and so is pumpkin pie. The two combined made for a wonderful surprise for the family. Likewise, we skip the brulee portion and serve with hard sauce or custard.

I love pumpkin pie and I love brulees but this recipe was a disappointment. Wouldn't make it again.

Fantastic! Not too pumpkin-y at all, just enough to give it something extra. I found it fairly easy to make, other than the near hour of baking time (anything less and it's soggy). I too passed on the brulee effect and opted for the brown sugar + butter + whipping cream sauce, which made it "eyes rolled in the back of your head" good. You will not be dissapointed with this one!

Oh, This is very good!! I chose to serve warm with a vanilla custard sauce from this site, rather than the brulee recommended, and enjoyed it very much. Doesn't have to be fall or a winter holiday for me to make this again.

I've made this a number of times now. We liked it at room temperature with whipped cream on top (instead of the brulee sauce). Definitely worth it!

This was a big hit with everyone at Thanksgiving and soooooooo easy. To make it a little more elegant I removed the individual puddings from their cups by running a knife around the sides and turning them upside down on a plate. They popped right out. I served them warm with a hot custard sauce. To die for!

I agree with a previous reviewer - the brulee topping doesn't fit this particular dish. Go for vanilla ice cream or caramel sauce, instead, and definitely serve this warm! Also, mine looked nothing like the picture, mine was much smoother. Next time I will cut the bread into bigger chunks and double the amount of bread. Also - I'll add some cinnamon. I found it to be a little bland.

We love this recipe. It's simple and amazing. However, I don't serve it cold. It loses the "comfort food" aspect and the wonderful aroma when it's served straight from the fridge. I also serve it with a rum sauce rather than the brulee topping. I love creme brulee, but this seems to beg for warm rum sauce and a crackling fire.

Delicious!! Served it for Christmas Day dinner. I have an old caramel rum sauce recipe that is to die for, it went perfectly with the bread pudding. Served also with a dollop of freshly whipped cream.

This was delicious, and I definitely will make it again. My husband, however, felt that it would be better if served warm.

Excellent! As a lover of both bread pudding and creme brulee, this was perfect. I did however add 1/4 cup of eggnog instead of all the half and half. I also used Vanilla Rum instead of the recommended liquer.

This recipe is easy and so very tasty, can be made ahead of time also. Excellent when served warm topped with french vanilla ice cream!

This is an absolutely wonderful recipe. The combination of pumpkin and cinnamon raisin bread is heavenly... I have made this several times. I have tried it with a basic hot brown sugar and butter sauce instead of the sugar and cream brulée. It was wonderful also. The recipe is simple: 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1 tablespoon butter in a saucepan. Melt the brown sugar and butter until the sugar is darkened. Add 1/2 cup of water to start and let the mixture melt. Mix 1 teaspoon of corn starch and 1 tsp of water and add to the mixture to thicken. Let it come to a boil and add water to obtain the desired thickness of the sauce.

This is a great desert. I'll make it again and again.

This was our Thanksgiving dessert, and the family raved! The licquer adds depth to the flavors in this scrumptious pudding. The cinnamon raisin bread adds a perfect touch of spice to this easy recipe. Don't miss this one.

Delicious...and easy to make ahead. A big hit at Thanksgiving. I let puddings come to room temperature before "brulee-ing" and skipped the tablespoon of whipping cream. A definite keeper.

I am not a huge dessert person, but I thought this was great! Very Easy and Very Delicious! I was in the process of moving, my ramekins were packed away, so I made it in one 4C souffle dish and adjusted the ingredients. Excellent holiday dish!

Easy, do-ahead and delicious... served it warm, however, with dollop of good brand of pecan vanilla ice cream
