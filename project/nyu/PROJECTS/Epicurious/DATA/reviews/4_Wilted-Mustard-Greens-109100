This is a very good recipe and very easy to make! My mom has mustard greens in her garden so we will be making this recipe a lot!

Just mustard-y enough without being overpowering. Yummy!

This was very good for mustard greens, although I prefer the chewier texture & slightly bitter taste of 'Brocolirabe' {spelling?} to mustard greens. But this recipe is a good use of mustard greens.

Outstanding. I'd never cooked mustard greens before, and these were fabulous. I used one bunch of leaves, made 2-3 servings along with one other side and a main.

Yum! I've made these mustard greens twice now and both times they turned out perfectly! I try to cook some sort of leafy green - swiss chard, kale, collard greens, or mustard greens a few times a week and, thanks to this recipe, both my husband and I have decided that mustard greens are our new favorite!

This is an ideal recipe for someone who's not sure if he/she likes mustard greens (or any greens, actually). A straight forward method. If the mustard is fairly young, like what I was fortunate to have, you don't even need to remove many stems or ribs; just boil, squeeze, chop, and saute (or use a wok as I did; cooks that excess water out quite well) Be aware, though, that the boiling and heavy garlic flavor may cover up that mustard bite.

Excellent taste, I am always looking for variations of green vegetable recipes. Very easy, I had never cooked mustard greens before. I didn't bother using unsalted butter, I just tasted to make sure I didn't over season. Also, I didn't bother to cool the leaves down with cold water.

Very easy and very delicious. The greens really cook down, so make sure you have a lot. A 1/2 pound was barely enough for 2 people.

Big hit! We bought mustard greens but had never prepared them before...we found this recipe super easy and yummy! One thing to note - one bunch of mustard greens cooks down to about a cup - just enough for one (if this is a feature dish) or maybe two (if there are multiple other side dishes) people.

Wonderful, simple way to utilize a seasonal vegetable. Mustard greens can be bitter, however it seems that parboiling takes away the bitterness and leaves, in its place, the taste of nutty garlic. This lovely vegetable can be found at farmer's markets in the Fall season. Look up your nearest market and enjoy seasonal food at its finest.

I make this weekly-everyone I serve it to is surprised- Very nice with fish and any sauce of your choosing.
