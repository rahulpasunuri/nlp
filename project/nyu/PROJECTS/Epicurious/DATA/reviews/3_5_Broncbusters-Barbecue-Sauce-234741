This is my family's favorite bbq sauce. I make it for brisket, ribs, chicken; anything where you need a good, zingy, tangy bbq sauce. Enjoy!

This is my new bbq sauce for the future. It's the best I've found!

Very unhappy with this sauce. For the time and effort required to make it was overtly vinegary and tart. A lot went to waste since people only used such a small amount on the meat. I like vinegar as much as the next person but this was entirely too strong.

I followed the directions, and the sauce was great. Definately something for you to try if you like a sauce which is slightly sweet (it's not overpoweringly sweet though).

Was just average for me, nothing special.

I thought this receipe was familiar.The first time I tried it was in 1968 from my Betty Crocker Cook Book when I was learning how to cook.Only minor changes were made in this new one.It's called Texas Barbecue Sauce in the book.It's a really good sauce!

Just a suggestion for Chili Sauce lovers ... heat 1 bottle Heinz Chili Sauce with 1-2 8 oz. jars of grape jelly (can use regular or low sugar). Makes a fabulous sauce for meatballs. Just stick meatballs and sauce in crockpot and heat on low.

Fabulous -- chili sauce is a hot and spicy ketchup like bottled sauce sold in the south. Heinz may now make a chili ketchup. You could add more ketchup, hot sauce/cayenne as a substitute

Quick response to the comment below: vegetarian Worcestershire sauces do exist - I use a brand called The Wizard's Organic Vegetarian Worcestershire sauce (the company's website is www.edwardandsons.com), and in my opinion, it tastes just the same as those with anchovies.

For the vegetarian: We use Annie's Naturals Organic Worcestershire Sauce - it is vegetarian and available at Whole Foods and Wild Oats.

Sorry, I know I'm not rating this...just wondering about skipping the Worcestershire, which is not vegetarian. Suggestions for substitutions or do you think it will affect the flavor much? Thanks a lot!

I have been making this with the Lazy Brisket since it was published in Bon Appetit in 1982. They are both wonderful. Great for picnics or pot lucks and the leftovers (if there are any) are good as a sandwich.
