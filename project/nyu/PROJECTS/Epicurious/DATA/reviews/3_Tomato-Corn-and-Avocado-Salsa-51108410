I have been making this for a couple of years now and was amazed to see this on Epicurious. How good it is depends on your ingredients. With the freshest, in season corn and tomatoes it is fantastic! I add raw pepitas (pumpkin seeds) to make this a raw vegan main course. I also sometimes add fresh peaches or mangoes. Enjoy
