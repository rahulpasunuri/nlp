So good - and so easy! Whole family liked it and it took all of 5 minutes to prepare! Great for a weekday meal. Served with grilled chicken and a fresh loaf of bread.

Easy and delicious! I just used regular balsamic vinegar.

I don't understand why the total time is "1 1/4 hours" -- unless you are growing your own spinach, I don't know how this would take more than 15 minutes, tops. This tasted GREAT, and I didnt' even have strawberry vinegar -- just made a light vinaigrette with champagne vinegar, and it was wonderful. Used others' suggestion of adding some blue cheese crumbles.

I used raspberries (the suggested alternative in the intro) both in the vinegar and whole in the salad. I also subbed hazelnuts for the pecans and I used a baby greens salad mix (which included spinach and arugula). Overall I thought it was quite nice! In my case this was more of an introduction on the technique of making fruit vinegar but next time I'd like to make the actual recipe as written.

I made this twice in one weekend, for 2 different groups. The first time, I used spinach, almonds (didn't have any pecans) and added gorgonzola. The second time, I used mixed baby field greens, almonds, and added gorgonzola. I also made a mistake the second time: I accidentally dressed the salad with just the strawberry vinegar, not with the strawberry dressing. The strawberry vinegar is so delicious that nobody noticed, including me!

Simple, delicious. I couldn't find strawberry vinaigrette, so I used white wine vinegar and added a touch of honey. I love the nuts! This salad is such a perfect compliment to a heavy meal.

Very simple but delicious. I used a 1 to 2 ratio of vinegar to oil. I also added raw bean sprouts to add a little crunch.

Really good, light simple salad. Great to serve with a heavier meal. Made exactly as written. Served it to six people and all was eaten.

We toasted walnuts and added goat cheese to this salad and it was absolutely delicious! One of my favorite salads ever.

Loved this salad! A bit lighter than some other versions--the strawbery vinegar is quite special. The 2nd time around I did add a bit of blue cheese--we just like that combination--but what makes this truly lovely is the strawberry vinegar. I did not put sugar in mine, as the berries hre are perfect this time of year--not necessary.

Excellent. Put pecans in a shallow pan at 350 degrees for 5-15 minutes or till golden brown.

Is it true that spinach and strawberry salad is passe? Either way, my husband loves this salad. We toss in goat cheese or gorgonzola, sometimes red onion, sometimes pine nuts instead of pecans, etc.

Instead of making the vinaigrette from scratch i used a light rasberry vinaigrette and the salad was still very tasty. This is a great dish if your on the go!

Strawberry Salads are my absolute favorite dinner salads and I always order something like this in a restaurant. The Jordan Farm Inn in Virginia uses a similar recipe to this. This is a very easy salad and very tasty. The dressing (when used sparingly as directed) gives just a hint of flavor and is very light. No sweetness at all. If you want it to be sweeter (I did), I added 1 extra tablespoon to the dressing when I was preparing it (not to the Strawberry Vinegar recipe). Definitely will be on my list of go to salads.
