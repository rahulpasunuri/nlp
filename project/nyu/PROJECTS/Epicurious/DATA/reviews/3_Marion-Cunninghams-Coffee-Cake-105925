in spite of the super thick batter, the cake came out well. i checked at 40 min but 50 was necessary for my regular oven with a thermometer to double check temp. i'll definitely try the light sour cream suggestion. when i made this many years ago in a convection oven in asia, the only sour cream i could find was from new zealand, more similar the light variety in the US.

is the batter supposed to be really thick and not at all like cake batter consistency? i just finished mixing and am ready to pour into pan but afraid the cake will be too dry. the batter is so thick and heavy. wondering if i did something wrong? perhaps my organic sour cream was too thick and heavy?

a regular goto for comfort! as another reviewer pointed out, the texture is wonderful. after making in various ovens with various sour creams and in various countries, two suggestions for a moister cake: 1) use light sour cream; 2) check for doneness around 40 min. 50 min was too long for a regular oven, but just right for a convection.

After reading all of the reviews I was a bit sceptical about this cake. What a pleasant outcome! I substituted organic "VANANA" yogurt for the sour cream, about 1/2 c sugar instead of 1 c. At the end I added about a cup of each choc. chips and walnuts. Other than that I followed the recipe almost exactly. It has a beautiful crispy outside, and it's just crumbly enough to be coffee cake. I LOVED it! My husband raved the whole time he ate it!

I thought it was tasty--worked for me. It's not a whack you over the head kind of deal--it's a coffee cake.

No real taste, very disappointing.

I have made this recipe at least 5 times since December and have always gotten rave reviews. It is so versatile. I've served it with fruit, a bit of liqueur, and whipped cream, plain with blueberry sauce, just plain, toasted. A friend won a bet and his choice of prize was this coffee cake.

I had this cake in the oven before deciding to check the reviews. The aroma was wonderful, so I was encouraged though the reviews were largely negative. The cake looked great, but I, too, was put off by the "pancake-y" taste. Wrapped it to see if it would improve by the next day, but no luck. Very disappointed, as I had clipped the recipe due to the editor's glowing remarks.

After tasting this cake, I had to do a double check of the recipe..... I thought I did something wrong. I did not. This cake tasted terrible.. What a large waste of ingredients.

I should have listened to "a cook from Southfield, MI"...the batter had an odd taste and the finished cake tasted like pancakes!

What a great cake!! At first glance, the recipe seems so simple. How can such an ordinary recipe that is so easy to make taste so great? It's most likely because of all that vanilla and the sour cream. When I first tasted it, I couldn't believe how good it was. Don't forget: every oven is different. It's important to test for doneness well before the time listed on the recipe.

This is a quick and easy coffee cake that was also served with strawberries and whipped cream as an impromptu dessert one evening. I have made it several times and received enthusiastic responses. It is another wonderful Marion Cunningham recipe-straight forward and one that you can count on! I do not recommend tasting ANY raw batter-remember your pal "sal"!

This is a good, reliable, basic coffee cake that has a surprisingly light crumb, due, I assume, to the sour cream. I have made it at least once a week since the issue came out. I have, however, added bittersweet chocolate chips. Not too many, just a handful, so you get one or two per slice.

When an editor speaks so glowingly about a recipe, one would expect something sensational...this WAS NOT. Even the streusel I added and marbled through did not save it. A very ordinary cake...I had my first doubts when I tasted the raw batter...let's have a contest for the best sour cream coffee cake. That would be fun!
