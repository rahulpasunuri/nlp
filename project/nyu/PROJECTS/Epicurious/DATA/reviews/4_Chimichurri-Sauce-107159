I read through previous reviews and made the necessary adjustments. I used 5 cloves of garlic, 1/8 cup of red wine vinegar and 1/2 a fresh chilli. Everyone loved it, though I think I could've added more cilantro do it just to give it that bit more of a kick. Will definitely be making this again.

Chimichurri sauce is one of those wonderful sauces that any good cook can manipulate 'to taste' and please his/her guests. This one is a good basic start - but as other reviewers have noted, the addition of cumin and so much vinegar is unnecessary. I used the juice of one whole lime(to try and approximate the chimichurri sauces we love in Puerto Vallarta,) in place of vinegar. The fresh oregano is nice with the cilantro and parsley. I'm thinking of adding fresh terragon next time because I love it with steak in a strong bearnaise. I used two large shallots and a whole head of garlic in this recipe. Delightful!

Every time I make this recipe I get nothing but compliments. I make it with steak, chicken, pork, whatever you want. Make ahead, the longer it mingles together the better the flavor. It last several weeks in the fridge. I add a little more pepper flakes.

Chopping everything by hand, and using White Balsamic Vinegar (because I ran out of Red Wine Vinegar), I am quite pleased with this recipe. Forget the processor, hone your knife skills. Yum!

Too much vinegar, not enough garlic. Cumin? Same results as previous reviews. My other problem was my processor emulsified the sauce. Still tasted fine but not what I wanted.

I love to look at a number of different recipes when I'm making something, even if I have a fair idea of how to make it...so when I came upon this one, the first thing I thought was "cumin?" I don't think so, the second, "that's a lot of red wine vinegar". Then I read the reviews and they all say the same thing, too much vinegar and why cumin? So I made a great chimichurri using the parsley and cilantro, along with a healthy 5 cloves of garlic and the juice of 1 lemon, pulse in processor and then slowly add a good, fruity extra virgin olive oil. I added the red pepper flakes and salt and pepper to taste at the end. Delish on my char-broiled porterhouse!

I was expecting something a little more Latin inspired, with more of a garlic citrus overtone...the amount of vinegar was too overpowering. Tasted more like a salad dressing than a topper. I too, as another reviewer, am going to triple the garlic, use only limes, and maybe orange for a sweet note... I'll taste it and maybe see what a small splash of a white wine vinegar would add to it... We'll see...

I first tasted Chimichurri sauce at Lala's Grill in Studio City, CA. It was amazing! Rich on the pallet, garlicky, with a kick of zing and spice! In pursuit of finding a recipe I like I gave this one a try - no substitutions. Firstly, it is WAY too sour. Second, the cumin in this recipe feels out of place. That's not to say that it tasted wrong - against the particularly vinegary flavor, there's nothing to tie the cumin in with the rest of the sauce. If you're looking for a more vinegary sauce, this may be the recipe for you. I would just be careful in adding the cumin. On the plus-side, the bright green color makes for a gorgeous, fresh-looking sauce. The flavor was so far from the kind of flavor I was looking for so I will not be giving this recipe another try.

As others have noted-- with vinegar cut in half and additional garlic( and no cumin), this is the best chimichurri ever.

Wish I had read the first review that said "cut the vinegar in half". I'm pretty sure the author of this recipe didn't even make it cuz, as is, it tastes like drinking green vinegar. I'm not sure cutting it in half is enough. I'd add "to taste" and you might be able to salvage this. Note to other reviewers: changing the recipe and then giving YOUR recipe 4 stars doesn't help the rest of us.

I tripled the garlic and cut the vinegar in half. This was crazy good (eat-it-with-a-spoon-directly-from-the-bowl good). Had it with braised beef short ribs. Must make this ahead (at least the 2 hours suggested) as it needs to balance out.

this is not chimichurri. there are no "versions" of chimichurri.this is a nice sauce. If you really want to try chimichurri omit the cilantro. Cilantro is not used in uruguayan or argentine cooking. This is an americanized (Mexican influenced) modification to a fantastic dressing that didn't need any help.

This was delicious. I added some Worcestershire sauce and a bit of soy sauce to give it some oomph. That probably makes it not chimichurri sauce but I don't care - it was delicious. I had it with fish and also used a couple of tablespoons in risotto

There is no ONE way to make Chimichurri. There are a lot of recipes that include cilantro along with several other ingredients not listed here. 96% of the people that have tried this version seem to like it, maybe you should try it. Now are you going to tell me that there's only 1 way to make a spaghetti sauce?

I am completely in agreement with the poster from Uruguay. Argentine and Uruguayan chimichurri never had cilantro. If you want to use it, fine...but you shouldn't really call it chimichurri. Also, you can use both fresh and dried parsley and it gives a good texture; pour boiling water over the dried to steep it and drain. It's great to serve in a bowl for dipping your breads, as they do in Argentina! I put it on grilled corn in the cob in lieu of butter.

Easy and a great way to "fancy up" a simply cooked protein for a weeknight meal. I actually preferred the sauce on my oven roasted potatoes, which makes me think it would be delicious tossed with just boiled potatoes for a warm or cold salad.

We love this sauce. We've served it with grilled sirloin medallions and used to to spice up chicken fajitas. I prefer to make it at least a day ahead to let the flavors blend together. It has lasted (and lasted well) in the refrigerator for weeks after making it.

Delicious! We had it for Xmas dinner on a lushious rib eye steak. I used 1/2 cup of both parsley and coriander and added a little more garlic. Don't have a food processor, but chopping all the ingredients worked just as well, if not better.

No cilantro was ever supposed to be used in a chimichurri sauce... Ever!

Great sauce, just made it and still licking my fingers...adjusted the recipe by using 5 garlic cloves, 1 cup of cilantro and 1 teaspoon of cumin. Too bad I followed another reviewers recommendation on 3 teaspoons of salt. Ended up WAY to salty so had to make a new batch. This time without any salt which was perfect (to my taste). Next time I'll chop the herbs verses using the processor. Otherwise, a great simple recipe.

I made a variation of this sauce for King salmon this past weekend, and boy did my friends love it! I planned on grilling the fish on a cedar plank, but when that went up in flames, I put the fish, pesto and all, face down/skin up directly on the grill for a few minutes. When I turned the fish over, the pesto didn't even stick to the grate. Came out beautifully!

This chimichurri came out wonderful, spicy as it's supposed to be. I made the following changes to the original recipe after reading some comments: I used equal parts of parsley and cilantro (1 cup each), increased the garlic to 5 cloves, the salt to 3 teaspoons, the pepper flakes to 1 teaspoon, added a dash or black pepper and reduced the amount of red wine vinegar. It was the closest to the original chimichurri I have had in Argentina many times.

This was so good and fresh tasting. My family and guests loved it. I used more cilantro (almost a whole cup) because I purchased a large bunch and did not want it to go to waste. I would use the extra cilantro again. This is one of those recipes that you can eyeball the amount and it will still turn out fabulous.

We just came back from Miami where we had chimicurri with churrasco everyday!! All around good recipe, except the vinegar portion!!! Trust me I love tangy flavor, but 1/3 cup vinegar is waaaaay too much. I had to drain everything and re-add the olive oil to wash down the vinegar.

Rating: 4
Wonderful recipe for chimichurri sauce! I used the suggestions to use equal parts cilantro and parsley, and I added extra garlic. I left the vinegar alone since we tend to enjoy items a tad tangy, and I was out of red pepper so I used approx 8 drops of hot sauce. It was delicious with steak, and I will definitely use this recipe again.

A bit too much, very spicy, garlicky...and this is from someone who likes garlic and spice. I would adjust the garlic and pepper next time. My husband swears he could taste nothing but the garlic.

This was a perfect accompaniment to steak. I had 2 stalks of cilantro so I used those with the parsley. I also added a dried, seeded serrano pepper before blending instead of the crushed red pepper, and a few twists of the pepper grinder. Fabulous!

Simple and delicious. You can cut back on the red pepper if this is too spicy for you. Leftover sauce - whirl in a food processor with a can of drained cannellini beans for a terrific bean dip.

I used all cilantro, as I prefer it to parlsey. As well, instead of red peper flakes I added a full green jalapeno (deseeded). It was great - so fresh and tangy. I used it all week on everything, from shrimp one night to even poached eggs another night. It will be a new staple condiment in our house now.

Surprisingly delicious. I followed the trend and used equal parts cilantro and parsley, less vinegar, more garlic. I also tried to chop the herbs manually but found the texture awkward. It was no worse for the wear after a spin in the processor. Served over grilled salmon to wild applause. I too found myself dipping everything in it!

Great sauce but next time equal parts of cilantro and parsley. A little too liquidy so cut down on the vinegar. Also like the idea of a pinch of cayenne.

We put this on everything; shrimp, yucca, zucchini - it's always a hit, especially as an alternative to cocktail sauce with shrimp or on the shrimp grilled. Although I use equal parts parsley and cilantro and I substitute 2/3 of the vinegar with lime juice.

Great, great recipe for this wonderful Argentinian condiment. Goes well with any meat and most vegetables. There is excitement in the house every time I make it. I like it with 25-50% more garlic and a little more cilantro than the recipe calls for. But make it the first time as-is because it is delicious that way.

Was a little too acidic for my taste. Next time will reduce vinegar. Otherwise very tasty when made with freshly picked cilantro, and italian parsley from my garden. Prepared to go with grilled boneless rib eye steaks seasoned simply with fresh coarsely ground black pepper, and hawaiian red salt. Veggie side was a salad of steamed, then chilled green beans, topped with thinly sliced red onion, vine-ripened tomatoes, macerated with red salt.

Delicious and easy! For vegans out there- this is excellent with seitan! I used lots of lemon juice instead of vinegar then I dunked pieces of seitan in this and pan fried them over medium high heat with a little olive oil. I was trying to recreate an appetizer I tried at Candle 79 (great vegan restaurant in NYC) and I think it came close, even though theirs is grilled.

This is a very solid recipe, however I made a few changes to suit my own personal taste. I don't have the ability to grill steak (broiler) i added a little smokiness to the sauce by a dash of ground cumin. In addition, i am very sensative to vinegar so i used only a dash of vinegar and used fresh squeezed lime juice instead. The other key, is use good olive oil.

I made this for steaks for a dinner party. I left out the cilantro and the cumin (fussy eaters) and added lemon juice and extra garlic. Based on reviews of other chimichurri recipes, I hand chopped the parsley instead of processing, and the texture was wonderful! I marinated the steaks in some of the sauce for a couple of hours before cooking, and served more at the table. The sauce was bright and fresh and accented our delmonico steaks perfectly! I'm going to try the leftover sauce on chicken....

You cannot begin to imagine how good this is, especially given how easy it is to make! I could have eaten it with a spoon by itself! We made it for Father's Day and used it with steaks, chicken and sausage (all bbq'ed). I've been craving it ever since and made it for dinner again last night. Makes a plain old steak something truly special. Great for a summer barbecue.

I am hooked on this sauce! I researched other recipes on this site for Chimichurri sauce, and read the reviews, opted for this one, minus the cilantro. Had two large T-Bones, and pan-fried them (yes, a sin I know), but with the sauce it was spectacular! I served it with garlic and rosemary oven roasted potatoes, and kept dipping the potatoes in the sauce. When my child came home from school, I asked her to get the bowl of green slime out of the fridge, she laughed and wouldn?t get near it, my husband looked appalled but he tried it and loved it. Very, very good, and I am delighted.
