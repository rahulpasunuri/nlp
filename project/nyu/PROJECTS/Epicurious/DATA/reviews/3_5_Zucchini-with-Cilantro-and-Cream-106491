Really simple and easy to prepare. Delicious nevertheless. It would also be nice served with rice. I never thought that cilantro and zucchini would taste great together -- but I am going to make this regularly now!

This recipe deserves 4 forks because: (1) It is utterly simple (2) It highlights the zucchini flavor (3) You can adjust it (parsley, cumin, nutmeg, cardamom, coriander, cayenne) (4) You can add to it (e.g. onion, tomato, garlic) (5) It works on a low-carb diet ...and it TASTES great.

What a GREAT way to make zucchini! I added a touch of nutmeg and cayenne pepper.

This deceptively simple dish is wonderful.Though far from "light" it is very good.Even people not crazy about cilantro will like this as the cream and cooking make the flavor mild.I have made this many times.Great!

I too have a ton of zucchini and needed something new and interesting. This was terrific! I've also used italian parsley instead of cilantro with good results.

I made this again to rave reviews from my family, it's excellent. I have also taken the reviewer from Maine's idea and sauteed onions in butter/olive oil until barely carmelized, then added thinly sliced zucchini. Once seasoned with salt and pepper, it's simple and incredible.

This is the best zucchini dish I have made. I added a good amount of salt and lime juice.

Was very yummy. Made with low fat sour cream and half the butter. Served over baked potatoes for a tasty veg meal. Next time I think I'll add some cumin or other spice.

Yummy! I wouldn't change a thing. The flavor is perfect with the local southwestern dishes I am currently exploring.

I love zucchini and cilantro, this dish couldn't have satisfied me more. Perfect just as it is.

Boy, I am usually right in synch with the other recipe users on this site, but I thought this dish was a waste of my beautiful fresh garden cilantro. Maybe the addition of tomatoes would have saved it. I would like to recommend my favorite zucchini recipe - saute thinly sliced onions with thinly sliced zucchini until tender (the onions will be nicely browned), season with s&p and add a nice dollop of sour cream. Heat untill warmed. It doesn't look all that appetizing, but sure pleases all, especially non-zucchini lovers.

It was nice to do something different with zucchini. My husband and I thought it needed something to spice it up a little bit more, the sauce seemed a little bland to us. I'll experiment with some seasonings next time.

I forgot to add the salt and pepper and it was still amazing. Made it with half green zucchini, half yellow squash as I was short on zucchinis. Husband (Mr. Junkfood Himself) loved it too. We had it with roasted chicken legs. So simple and so delicious.

what a wonderful thing to do with zucchini that is a little too big for tender salads. My wife and I made this 3 times this week , Oh so good .

This was sooo good! But, I am a huge fan of cilantro and cream sauces to begin with so my review is very biased.

With zucchini bursting off my plants, I needed a new recipe. This was fantastic!

It's always nice to find a recipe that is wonderful in its simplicity. I made this with the lemon, garlic and oregano roasted chicken (on this site). Just pile the chicken on top of the vegetables... squeeze some lemon and enjoy!

This was so delicious. I added a bit more cream and a handful of diced fresh tomatoes, then simmered everything down to a creamy consistency serving it over a cut-up purchased roasted chicken. (The tomatoes cooked down and made the color beautiful.) My family loved it and ate every ounce of everything. I will definitely make it again and again -- fast, easy and very delicious. P.S. you'll need to be generous with the salt and pepper all the way through.

Absolutely delicious! I spooned it over potatoes, which made a quick and easy vegetarian dinner. Will definitely make it again.

This dish delicious...followed the recipe except I used half and half instead of cream - the cilantro is a wonderful compliment to the Zucchini. Would definately make it again!
