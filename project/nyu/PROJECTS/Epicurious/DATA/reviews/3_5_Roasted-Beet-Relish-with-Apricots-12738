very nice condiment to roasts. It has a sweet tangy flavor and is a good use for my many CSA beets.

This is a delicious, easy relish, and pretty too. Nice contrast with the sweet, soft beets, the chewy apricots, tang of the pomegranate molasses, and subtle bite of the red onion. I usually boiled the beets rather than baking them, for energy efficiency and convenience. Alas, this recipe is only a memory - I'm now on an ultra-low carb diet to control my diabetes, and have just given away my pomegranate molasses. To the cook from Bismarck, you could make your own, now that pomegranate juice has become ubiquitous. Boil down pomegranate juice, sugar and lemon juice.

This recipe sounds interesting and I would like to try it, but what would be a good substitution for pomegranate molasses? I have never seen that and I am sure it is not available in my area.
