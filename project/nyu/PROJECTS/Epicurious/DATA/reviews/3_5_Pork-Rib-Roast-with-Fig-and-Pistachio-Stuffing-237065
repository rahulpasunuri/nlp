This was the best pork dish I've ever made and ever eaten. Served it for Thanksgiving and it was a HUGE hit. The stuffing was good, not great. Next time I will serve it with a different stuffing. We used a digital thermometer to know when the pork was the right temperature and followed the recipe to a T.

This brine recipe is very good. Made one small change by adding a teaspoon of allspice.

It was difficult to find this cut of pork with the long showy rib bones. I took it out 15 minutes early and the meat was white throughout. Very tasty and favorful. Definitely brine the meat.
