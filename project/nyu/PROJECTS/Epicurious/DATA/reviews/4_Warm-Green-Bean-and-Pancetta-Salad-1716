This was one of the best green bean dishes I've made. I made some substitutions based on what I had in the fridge. I used andouille instead of pancetta, and diced the andouille into small pices, and Vidalia onion instead of shallots. I used "steam in bag" green beans. I steamed the beans in the microwave for two minutes. While steaming those, I sauteed the onion, rosemary and andouille. I then added the beans to the other ingredients and added the oil and lemon juice then sauteed on low for another 4-5 minutes, with the lid on. It was fantastic.

It was a fancy side dish with some simple ingredients. The flavors worked well together. I would make it again.

Fantastic! I made with a ham, but would go wonderfully well with lamb!

Easy plus good flavor. I left out the rosemary becaue most in my family don't like it.
