Used red wine vinegar; cook beans and made sauce seperate and let sit; then combine an heat through at serving time. Went well with German potato salad with bacon & dill, beer braised brats, and stout cake for Oktoberfest meal.

I make this with balsalmic vinegar it is sweeter and I also add bacon and use some of the bacon drippings instead of butter.

We made this last year for Thanksgiving dinner and thought it was delicious. I didn't find it too acidic, unlike other reviewers. My only dislike was the way the whole house smelled after cooking the vinegar for so long - even with the exhaust fan on in the kitchen.

We use this as a standby - such an easy way to make green beans interesting.

Yuck is the only word that comes to mind. We made this for Thanksgiving. What a flop!!!!

Haven't made it, but based on the previous reviewer's comments, I read the quantities... 3 cups of red wine vinegar has got to be a typo!!! There is no way any recipe would require that much... no wonder it was so sour! I would use about a cup, at the most.

Was not what we anticipated. We may try this again, with adding at least double the amount of sugar, this dish needs more sweetness to counter-balance the acidity of the red wine vinegar.
