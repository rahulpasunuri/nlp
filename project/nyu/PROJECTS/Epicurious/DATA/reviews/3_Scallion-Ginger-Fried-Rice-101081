great combination of flavors - i made only 2 cups of rice, used a handful of bean sprouts, all the seasoning liquid, cut the salt to 1 t, and added chopped red pepper and fresh cilantro for color - it came out really well, i'm glad i read the other reviews ...thx

I have made this fried rice again and again, using half of the bean sprouts and scallions and adding whatever vegetables I have on hand. It is more delicious (and healthy) than any take-out. The rice wine lends a wonderful aroma.

Interesting concept, although it was quite bland. Served with the Spicy Thai Mussels, which complemented the rice, but was not overly impressed.

Made this for my family and served beneath fresh caught bass poached in butter and lemon juice. Excellent!

Not really exciting on its own. However, I'll probably make it again, adding some fried egg and mushrooms.

i thought this recipe was very disappointing. i followed it carefully and the ginger was overwhelming and the large amount of bean sprouts made it taste like dirt.

For a quick and simple base this wins! I cooked the reciepe twice and it was great. The first time I made this a main coarse by adding ham, eggs, snow peas, and mushrooms. The second time it was served as a side dish with Pineapple/ginger chicken, and only added snow peas.

Very nice, flavorful, quick. I made it as a main course by adding cut up fried egg and sliced portabella mushrooms. Surprising how those 3 cups of scallions aren't too much...
