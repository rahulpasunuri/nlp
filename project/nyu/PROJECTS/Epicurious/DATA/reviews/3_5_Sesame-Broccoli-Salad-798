This recipe was fantastic after I tweaked it. I used only 1 tablespoon of honey. I added water chestnuts, scallions, red bell pepper and red pepper flakes. Delicious!

Delicious! I only had one head of broccoli, so I added a red pepper, 2 julienned carrots, two scallions and julienned the broccol stems as well. I halved the honey and sesame seeds. Sunny summery flavor.

disappointing. It needs more of a kick, like maybe a couple of cloves of sauteed or roasted garlic.

Are you kidding me? Thank goodness I tried the dressing before I used it on the broccoli! Horrible, sickly sweet, yucky...I can't think of enough adjectives to appropriately describe this disaster. If you want a broccoli with an asian dressing-- make up your own. It can't possibly be worse than this. ZERO FORKS!

I thought the dressing was perfectly balanced. Not too sweet, with a good toasted sesame oil note. I used broccoli (steamed for two minutes) and broccoflower (steamed for four minutes), plus julienned carrots, finely shredded red cabbage, sliced celery, and chopped cucumber. I didn't have sesame seeds, so I used toasted sunflower seeds. The salad looked beautiful and was absolutely delicious.

Not bad if you are a real cold broccoli fan - though the real saver is the quick and asian sauce/dressing recipe - how simple and usable!

Awesome - my husband says it's the best broccoli he's ever had - and my daughter ate it too! Used combination of regular sesame oil and toasted sesame oil and I used agave instead of honey because I did not have honey - but it worked great. Also used mandarin oranges instead of grapes.

Having purchased a large bag of broccoli florets, I came here looking for things to make. While this receipe had very mixed reviews, I gave it a try as is, but found like many that it lacked something. This dish needs some kick to cut through the cloyingly sweet dressing. I added an equal part of a hot chili vinagar that a Chinese takeout place makes to go along with its hot wings and that seemed to do the trick in giving this dish a bit more excitement. Also, I used way less sesame seeds, as advised. With changes, I've made it a couple of times and will keep it in my summer repetoire for light sides/salads. I mean, how easy does it get? 'nuff said

I liked this recipe. It's a simple, eay, healthy salad for hot days, and my fussy, fussy family liked it. Hand out the forks!

This was really good and easy. I served it to my in laws and they loved it. My changes, which were based on other reviews: I cut back the honey to a little over one tablespoon; I cut back the sesame oil and added a little canola oil because I thought the sesame might be too overpowering; I added some green onion; and lastly I highly recommend steaming the broccoli for only 2 minutes...3 max. Oh, and 1 tablespoon of sesame seeds is plenty. I mixed black and white ones, which did look nice.

Title says it all; "an easy side dish with a bit of asian flavor". Good, not great. Added sliced mushrooms and green onions, 2 T toasted black sesame seeds. Broccoli only needs to steam 2-3 minutes.

This was just ok-the dressing was very cloying-& I only added 1tbsp of the sesame oil. I let the broccoli get very cold, hoping it wouldnt get soggy, but it did. Think overall the flavors are too heavy for the broccoli.

This salad is wonderful...I actually crave it! I like to add two chopped scallions and sometimes raisins and chopped pecans. Also you can substitute the soy sauce for Bragg's Amino and it's very tasty!

I wasn't crazy about this. The flavors just didn't seem to blend well with the broccoli.

Interesting and different. I mixed broc and aspar. 5 min is way too long for steaming the veggies - they keep softening up as they absorb the marinade. Excellent picnic side dish.

Great broccoli alternative. I couldn't stop snacking on it. I used around 1/4c of sesame seeds and substituted mirin for the honey. Still couldn't get my kid to eat it, though!

Great way to serve broccoli to the kids. I served it cold (great to make ahead) and added some orange zest. Either way it's great!

Great recipe if your trying to find a new way to use broccoli or just don't like raw broccoli like myself. A couple tablespoons of sesame seeds is plenty.

Rating: 4
Oh Yum! A great Broccoli recipe. It's easy to make and the do ahead factor is a real bonus. Excellent compliment to any Asian dinner. I agree with another reviewer that the 1/2 cup of sesame seed had to have been a misprint. I used only about 1 Tbl - lightly toasted - it was plenty.

I did a search for this recipe as I remember making it about 20 years ago from a copy of my mum's Bon Apetit magazine. It was delicious! There were slight differences though: The original recipe did not include sesame seeds, but did include fresh asparagus spears and rare cooked minute steak cut in thin strips. This was then marinated in the dressing for about an hour. As I am a vegetarian now I would no longer include the steak however recommend the asparagus. This was always a favourite!

I love this recipe, it is so easy. I make 3x the recipe & keep it in the fridge,I also keep washed broccoli in a ziploc bag nuke it for a couple of minutes add the sauce( you don't need the whole amount stated)& it's delicious.Also good with asparagus or green beans.

Took this to a friend's for dinner and it was a big hit. Everyone was hanging around the kitchen before dinner and they kept sneaking florets out of the bowl like an appetizer. In my view the sesame oil and sesame seeds are essential, but I have to believe the amount of seeds in the recipe is a typo. I toasted 1/4 cup and only used about half of that. One-half cup would surely result in something resembling sesame-encrusted broccoli. I doubled the dressing but this wouldn't be mandatory - depends on how saucy you like things. For a buffet I'd stick with the amount specified. This was great as a side-dish and would be a great picnic dish as well. Add the fact that the recipe is easy enough to execute from memory and it's practically perfect!

This was quite nice. I served it with the Chinese Hoisin BBQ Pork Tenderloin over white rice. Went well with the meal. Nice difference in colors and temperatures. The dressing was perfect -- not too strong. Note: I didn't have any sesame seeds. In the future, I might sprinkle a few on top if I have them handy. Certainly not a necessity, though.

Use hot sesame oil(really perks it up) and 1/2 less sesame seeds. Use 2 times dressing than what is called for. Serve with pan seared tuna with shiitake cream and wasabi mashed potatoes (both this site) and you have 5 star dining!

Pretty disappointing, and I agree that there are way too sesame seeds in the dish. Go for half the amount, or less. A mixture of black and white sesame seeds gives it some interest.

Great recipe and easy too! The amount of sesame seeds is too much so I would go by sight/taste for the right amount.

Great for an easy Asian side. Added bamboo shoots and some red peppers for the crunch. Goes well with the Ginger-Soy Lime Grilled Chicken recipe here.

I really liked this recipe. Very simple to make. I used regular vinegar instead of rice vinegar and preferred that. It could probably be used with other vegetables. I will definitely make it again.

This recipe is a wonderful addition to a salad bar. Next time I am going to add some red peppers and water chestnuts for some crunch and will experiment with some hot sesame oil. What is great about this one is its simplicity with regard to numbers of ingredients and time spent for something so flavorful.

Add an equal amount of Chinese chilli sauce, and you have a great dish--not really a salad, but a nice spicy-sweet sidedish. I liked it, my husband loved it. Without the chilli sauce it would be cloying, I think.

My husband and I both liked this dish. I added sugar snap peas and carrots which also tasted great with this dressing. I also some hot sesame oil for a kick. I will definitely be making this again but next time I'll add fewer sesame seeds.

Great easy recipe. The broccoli had a nice, slightly sweet taste. Use dressing sparingly. I overcooked the broccoli, and it was good, but know it will be much better with an al dente crunch.

I found this dish really sickening. The marinade was good on the first bite, overpowering by about the 5th. I'd rather eat plain broccoli.

Delicious! Made many times. Used 1 T of oil instead of two and used peanut oil instead of sesame cause I didin't have sesame oil at home.The next time I bought sesame oil and it tasted much better with the peanut oil.More flavor.

The sauce in this recipe is fabulous, and can be used for stir fries or other asian cooking. In addition, I use it as a marinade on baked tofu. It has become a staple in my meals.
