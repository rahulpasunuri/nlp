Delicious for breakfast, snacks or dessert! To make it dairy-free, I substituted 1 cup sunflower oil for the butter, and 1 cup lactose-free vanilla yogurt for the milk. Turned out wonderfully moist and was enjoyed by all!

Very easy and forgiving recipe. Made this while abroad - couldn't find affordable butter, made with (ack) tub margerine and with five smallish eggs instead of five. Only had skim milk. Baked in a bundt cake pan. And...everyone raved about it. I found it a bit cinnamony in the strudel, but am going to make it again with a bit less cinn.

I actually made this cake as (without walnuts and cocoa). I was looking for something that was not too sweet and it was a perfect coffee cake. Took it to a housewarming party and it was completely finished!

I made this recipe because I didn't have any sour cream or buttermilk on hand but wanted something sweet for the family on the weekend. We loved it - - and it was SO easy! I DID make some substitutions/changes, but I think it was for the better. I used brown sugar for the streusel, but was looking for a nice big crumb (like the Starbuck's coffee cake) so I used: 1 C. brown sugar, 1/3-1/2 C. of flour, 1/2 tsp. of salt and about 3/4 stick of melted butter. Combine well; it should be very wet. I used white sugar for the batter, used 4 eggs, 1 stick of butter and 1/4 C. of oil (oil provides moisture in baking better than butter or eggs). I skipped the walnuts (kids don't like 'em) and the cocoa powder (husband doesn't like it). I also used 2% milk w/ a Tbs or two of heavy cream added because I don't use whole milk. The streusel was perfect. I used my fingers to break off big crumbs of streusel for the middle and for the top and got nice, big, stick-to-the-cake crumbs. Our family killed half of the cake by noon on Saturday! It was delish!

I picked this recipe because I didn't have any yogurt or sour cream in the house-- It was wonderful.. the church ladies loved it! I added a package of vanilla pudding mix, 5 fresh eggs all different sizes, a little extra butter, and half the baking powder--I used a jelly roll pan.I don't know if it was the pudding but it was almost too moist;- ))) Will bake again! by A Cook from West Linn, Or on 01/30/10

Excellent coffee cake with a few modifications. 2 1/2 tsp Baking powder, all dark brown sugar used, 1 cup high gluten flour 2 cups all purpose flour, 1/2 cup sour cream + 1/2 cup 2% milk instead of whole milk, and chocolate chips instead of cocoa powder. Wonderful, moist, and I loved the crunchy topping.

These modifications made it perfect: Omit cocoa (I had none) and use 1 cup bittersweet chocolate chips. Mix in a tbsp of flour when you toss chips with nuts, which helps to suspend them in batter. 3 eggs, 2 sticks of butter (1 cup) and lessen the amt of baking powder to 2 tsps. Pecans substituted well for walnuts. Really a marvellous coffee cake, and absolutely not dry.

I agree the cake was slightly dry, but I liked the crispy shell on the outside. We served with caramel swirl ice cream after heating the cake on a woodstove; it had been baked the same afternoon. I don't think more eggs will do the trick, maybe more oil and more milk instead. In any case more moistness would be a major plus, although everyone said it was a welcome diversion from "regular" desserts.

Added 2 tablespoons of oil to the batter based on reviews that the cake was too dry. Still turned out somewhat dry, and the outer layer was hard, crunchy almost. Perhaps an extra egg + the oil as others recommended would have helped. Also, it didn't seem like I had enough batter for the amount of layering the recipe called for. One substitution I made was to add toasted, chopped hazelnuts instead of walnuts. Liked the subtle flavor. Overall, this was a very easy recipe to make, but it was time consuming and not that amazing for the amount of effort involved.

Very, very good recipe, and thank you. I read the reviewers who found it too dry, but I didn't want to add more butter or oil. So I added 1/2 cup of applesauce to the milk, and because it was in the fridge, I substituted 1/4 cup of egg nog for 1/4 of the milk as well. Oh, and I used 1 cup of brown sugar mixed with 2/3 cup white sugar. The rest of the recipe I followed exactly, except I filled the pan with 1/2 the batter, then 1/2 the topping, then the other half of the batter and then the rest of the topping, and, as one reviewer suggested, mixed the topping in a lot with a knife. Great cake!!

sweet, moist & delicious

It wasn't until the cake was in the oven that I read the reviews saying folks added an extra egg. I was an egg short! With 3 eggs it came out fine; I also used 2% milk (what I had) and less baking powder. I don't think it was dry at all. Perhaps because of using *less* fat. Very tasty, and I liked the nuance of the cocoa powder.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and added an extra egg and 1/4 cup of butter. I thought it was still a little dry and dense. For my taste, it could use more of the walnut/cinnamon mixture. I received compliments (how can you fault a free coffee cake?) but I don't think I'll make it again.

Based on other reviews, I planned to add some oil or extra butter but unfortunately forgot -- and sure enough it came out a bit dry. Too bad, because with the extra moisture it would have been really good. As it is, it's only okay. I used brown sugar instead of white for the walnut mixture, which I would definitely recommend (and I increased that whole mixture amount by 50% because I like the crunchiness on top). One last note to others new to coffee cakes: don't be afraid to swirl away with that knife! I think I "underswirled" leaving too much plain cake on the bottom half. :) Overall, I think I'd try it again with some modifications, but there might be better coffee cake recipes out there.

Definately add the extra egg and a bit of cooking oil during the alternating flour/milk procedure. I floured and sugared my bundt pan so the cake had a nice, crunchy, sweet texture to the outside.

Definitely add an extra egg & reduce the amount of baking powder by half. This makes it moist & delicious. My brunch guests loved it & the people at my office raved about it the next day.

I added 1/2 c. butter and an extra egg (I know, lots of fat!) to the recipe and it was scrumptous. It met rave reviews from my extended family.

Too dry! Ick. This was so dry it was embarrassing. I made it for Christmas breakfast, and didn't read the reviews complaining of the dryness. IMHO, this was a dud, and I am very forgiving of recipes.

I am not a frequent baker, so I don't know all the tricks, but I found the cake to be too dry also. I made it a second time and increased the butter by 1 tablespoon and reduced the baking powder to 2 1/2 teaspoons. This seems to have made all the difference.

I really enjoyed this cake! My fiance is too as he's taking a piece to work with him each day. I also gave a chunk to a neighbor and she liked this cake too. I thought perhaps it was my preparation but after reading reviews decided it was not--my cake was a little dry too. Despite that, I really liked it and it looks very pretty too!

The cake had a great flavor, but I agree it was a bit dry. The second time I made it, I tried cutting back the cooking time, but I still thought it was on the dry side. I think next time I will add a glaze and double the walnut mixture.

I made this cake for breakfast this morning and it was wonderful...My husband really liked it too.The chocolate really was the perfect touch.I like things a little heavy on the spices though and added some cinnamon to the batter as well.

Nice-tasting cake. I have made others that were better though. I thought it was a tad dryer than it should have been. Toasted walnuts were a nice touch. I don't know what the 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder was doing in the receipe. I sure couldn't taste it.

I, too, made this for colleagues at work. Not a morsel was left. Wonderful recipe. A real keeper.

Excellent - tender and moist. Disappeared very quickly at work. I layered half the batter, half the filling, the rest of the batter, and topped with the "filling". It did make a somewhat crunchy topping.

This was the best pound cake that I have ever had. I made it for people at work during the holidays, and everyone LOVED it!

I made this for our Thanksgiving dinner at work and everyone raved about it....I baked it for 45 minutes instead of the 55 and it wasn't as dry...used pecans instead of walnuts. This is definitely a 'keeper' recipe!

I prefer to save some of the cinnamon topping for the top of the cake which not only makes it crunchy, but also makes it look more appetizing! I also substituted the 1 3/4 cups of white sugar into 1/2 cup brown sugar (for the topping) and 1 1/4 cups white sugar (for the cake) and was delighted with the results! A definite keeper!
