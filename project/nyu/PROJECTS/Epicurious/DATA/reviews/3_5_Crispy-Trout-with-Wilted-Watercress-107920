Very good. Accidentally used a bit too much oil for the frying part so the fish crisped up nicely. I used arugula in lieu of the watercress (and didn't add more oil) as I had it on hand. I was worried that it would taste fishy/odd but it MADE the dish. Without the wilted greens cooked with the lemon and leftover oil/butter it probably would've been bland. I'll def. make this again.

Super easy, pretty tasty, and presented nicely. Served this with mashed potatoes. I'd recommend it!

Very tasty and easy. I replaced the black pepper with a little cayenne and used spinach instead of watercress.

Making it for a second time. A big hit. Surprisingly the whole domestic unit dug it. I used olive oil instead of butter and it was still great, but I doubled the watercress. Watercress is not cheap, but everyone liked it,so anytime I can get healthy greens into them, hurray!

This was quite good. The trout came out very crispy, if a bit bland. I would up the amount of spices used and perhaps add a little extra, perhaps a cayenne pepper pinch or something. The watercress is great too, finally a vegetable my husband will eat!

I enjoyed the trout just fine - I cooked it as specified, but didn't use the watercress (I had green beans on the side). The trout was a snap to make, and certainly turned out crispy - and delicious.

I'd like to try again but this seemed to lack flavour. I didn't have a lot of pan drippings for the water cress and nothing got too crispy. Next time I will make sure there is enough oil/butter for the fish. Nice idea.

I would like to know how to filet a trout. I know how to clean one but I can't figure out how to remove the bones before cooking. Does any one know of a website that explains this? Thanks.
