This was great but I improvised on the log. Instead, I used half a stick of butter and smaller pork chops. I just poured the melted butter mixture on the pork chops after it cooled down and it was delicious. I used ground sage and parsley flakes in a fix and it came out just as tasty as if I had the time to run to the store for fresh spices. Highly recommended for a short and quick recipe to put on the menu at home.

This should be renamed pork scampi. The garlic completely overpowered the flavor of the sage and onion. Also, you only need about a quarter (or less) of the amount of butter compound--this recipe is suggesting 2 TBS of butter per chop!

Absolutely delicious. I will definitely make this one often.

If you have trouble getting the butter to solidify into a log, just go ahead and put it in the freezer for a few minutes. It will happen much faster.

Really good and really easy! I did saute the garlic a bit more the 2nd time I made this and it was a little too raw after only 30 seconds the 1st time I made it. This is very easy to make (especially if you make the butter mixture earlier) and very yummy!

It was simple and savory- I had difficulty getting the butter to harden in a log, and next time will just leave it in a bowl, put it in the refrigerator, and spread it over the pork chops as is.

I used the butter compound in combination with pork loin cooked using another recipe on this website. The butter was just awesome and is great especially if your pork tends to be on the dry side. Yum!

I had a bad feeling going into this recipe. I'm going to give it another try again eventually, but, I rarely mess up recipes.

I found the sage to be too much...maybe a little less sage would be better...love the idea of a butter compound, just not this one.
