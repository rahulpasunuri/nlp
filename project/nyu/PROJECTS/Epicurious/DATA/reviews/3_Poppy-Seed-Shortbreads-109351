Well I did make these for easter, but ran out of time to experiment with the drizzled confectioners glaze...and not disappointed that I did, because they are great just the way they are. Simple. Elegant. Delicious. I'm going to put them in cello bags and tie with bows and bring as Easter hostess gifts (I'll be visiting several homes over the holiday weekend).

I'm thinking about making these for easter, has anyone ever done a glaze on top (confectioners sugar, little milk, and lemon?) Seems like they might need something?

This recipe is wonderful! It is also vey easy to modify. I added the zest of one lemon and reduced the poppy seeds by half and made a nice lemon-poppy seed shortbread. It was a big hit!

Very tasty cookies, and nice because they're a bit out the ordinary. I made them on a warm, muggy day and had to work fast to get the cookies on the sheets.

This is by far THE best shortbread recipe I have ever tasted. They literally melt in your mouth! These are the most decadent cookies I have ever tried. They dissapeared in seconds! HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!!!!!
