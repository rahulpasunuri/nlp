A nice twist to corn on the cob. The taste was refreshing with the citrus kick. I added a slight pinch of sugar to the butter mixture. Tasty!

Only thing I left out was the lime peel, and I reduced the lime juice a little because I was unsure about it. The lime worked great with the flavors--this is a whole new take on corn. I boiled it for 7 minutes and rolled the butter. It was the best corn I've ever had.

I thought this was good with a nice, fresh flavor. We didn't grill the corn, but rather stirred the butter mixture into hot kernals.

What a delicious recipe; the entire family loved it. Highly recommended exactly as it is.

Maybe I'm a purist, but the lime flavour seemed a bit weird on the corn. It left me craving good old salt and butter!

I used my grill to cook the corn but it took 15-20 min. rather than 10. Loved the suggestion to put flavored butter in a bag and toss with the corn. So much easier! I will use this recipe again.

Made it just as written. Cooked for 5 minutes, though. Delicious!

Took this to a potluck barbecue, and it got raves. Even those who normally don't butter their corn slathered it on. For eight ears, though, it made way more than needed. I'm saving the rest for other veggies.

Wonderful- and so easy. I didn't have any chives so I used cilantro instead and I think I will keep making it that way. Also great on steaks as a compound butter.

This is superb! I learned the trick of adding 1 t. - 1 T. sugar to the corn water from an old farmer years ago; it's one of the secrets to success. He also said boil the corn for 9-10 minutes and I agree. Two other excellent toppings are: spread ears with ayonaise (NOT miracle whip) and sprinkle with grated Parmesan and also delicious - melted butter with curry.

A big hit at several dinner parties.

I have made this butter several times over the last couple of months, and I love it everytime!!!! I make a big batch, and keep it in the freezer so I have some whenever I need it.

I made this for a dinner party and all the guests raved. The butter by itself tastes odd, but combined with the corn is really delicious.

This is fabulous - and easy. I've emailed the recipe to all my friends!

this is OK, but if you like this, you must try the Roasted Corn with Chipotle Mayonnaise also on Epi. It is yummy!

Delicious. I made it for my (notoriously) picky brother and he raved.

It is hard to top hot fresh corn with melted butter, salt and pepper but this definitely did the trick. I will never go back to plain butter again. Fast, easy and tastes great.

When I tasted it ahead of time, on its own, it wasn't great (tasted almost off). But melted on the corn it was actually quite good -- people who don't normally put anything on their corn loved it.

I made this using fresh Jersey corn bought right from the farmer. It was super easy, beautiful presentation, and received rave reviews from the husband. I wasn't sure about the lime juice, but previous reviewers were right-it adds a whole new dimension of flavor. I'll never make corn the old way again.

This was a welcome change from plain butter as you had the sweetness of the corn and the tartness of the lime juice. Even little kids ate the corn. Used the leftover butter on a steak and that was delicious!

The lime-chive butter is absolutely delicious on grilled halibut! Makes for a very easy dinner. Great melted on vegetables also.

The sea salt was easier to get than expected.... and the corn was delicious. Try the butter with potatoes too!

Absolutely fabulous spin on corn on the cob. The butter was delicious and complemented the corn perfectly.

I made this only off the cob and it was great. Go a little easy on the lime juice because it does tend to over power the corn.
