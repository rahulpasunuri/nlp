EEEWWWW!!! These were awful, don't waste your time and ingredients. These were super greasy and had an almost "lobstery" flavor. YUK

Lovely, delicate flavor. One caution - you really should have two pans. Genoise-type batters don't take kindly to sitting out. If you do only have one pan, be sure to gently but thoroughly stir the batter before you pour the second batch. The butter will have settled to the bottom. To the cook in CA - if the madeleines were greasy, you probably didn't beat the eggs long enough.

These madeleines were grey and greasy. I threw most of them away and will not be making this recipe again.

Too bad more haven't made these - they were great. Nice, subtle flavors. I used a non-stick madeleine plaque and only needed to butter it. Also, watch the baking time - mine were done in 6 minutes (the dark, non-stick plaque contributed to this, I know, but not that much!). My guests devoured them and raved.

Very good, I have tried other recipes before and they were very bland, the honey-orange flavor adds a lot. I did not have orange flower water so I used the juice from a orange.

I,ve made madeleines before and this is an improvement over my other recipe, especially for the proceedure. Follow it exactly except start beating (wire whip) the eggs while they are over the hot water. You need two molds, baking time is just enough to clean and prepare the second pan. Mini-muffin tins might work also.
