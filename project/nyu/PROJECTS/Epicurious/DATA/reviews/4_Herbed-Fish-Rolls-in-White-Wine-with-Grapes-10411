This was fantastic! Part of the reason I tried this recipe was to use up a bunch of tasteless, juiceless grapes we bought... and what a result! I used at least a full cup of grapes and we both wished I had used more. I also used 1% milk instead of the cream, and didn't miss it. It was a huge hit and I will definitely make again!

Delish!!! I followed the recipe all the way. We were 8 at the table and the fish and grapes and subtle wine flavor became the conversation piece. It is rich, but wouldn't change it at all. I served with rice pilaf (mine is with almonds, craisins, and sundried tomatoes including a bit of the oil so the rice is almost pink) Great addition to my recipe box.

I've rated very few recipes 4 forks--this one really deserves it! The grapes provide a terrific contrast to the rich sauce. I made it with butter & cream (because I had it on hand) but we really shouldn't indulge ourselves that way too often. So next time I'll try using milk instead of cream. Earlier reviewers said that should work fine.

I used fat free milk instead of cream and cooked raw shrimp along with the sauce. Wow, it was good, thicken nicely, it's easy and the only reason I gave it a 3 is because my husband decided to choke on a whole grape he didn't know was there! The flounder fillets I used were very thin and the grapes broke through when I wrapped them. Not a big deal, it's a good recipe!

I had some white grapes and wine, so I tried this recipe. This is a simple and impressive recipe to prepare. It has been two weeks since I tried this recipe and my taste buds are already craving the wonderful meld of delicate flavors again...the sauce is wonderful!

The fillets of orange roughy that I used were really too thick to roll and too thin to split. Next time, I'll just omit the rolling and poach the fillets in a shallow pan. I used white vermouth as I usually do if I don't have an open bottle of white wine. Delicious!

This was a recipe that even my kids, who hate fish, liked. I used Basa-Basa (a mild white fish) filets, and used whole milk instead of cream to cut a few calories. Definitely a keeper!

Very, very good. I was a little hurried and didn't have time to roll up the fish until after my company had arrived, but it was easier than I'd expected, thankfully, and very delicious. I'll definitely make this again.

I wanted to put my head down into this sauce and make pig noises. The fish was good, too and the whole recipe was very quick. I made it for a weekday dinner (just with whole milk) but I could easily make this for company and actually use the cream. I served this with a lemon-parmesan risotto and steamed asparagus. It's not quite a four forker but a great recipe nonetheless.

This recipe really deserves a little better rating than a three but it is not quite a four. The dish had wonderful light and delicate flavors.Not the least bit "rich" tasting. The grapes marinated in the wine were luscious. I had used fillet of sole for the fish but next time I will try it with the orange roughy. It was too bland a fish and needed to have more flavor on its own. I do not cook with salt and I am sure that would have made the dish more satisfying but we all totally, enjoyed it. I look forward to reading more reviews.It is a recipe definitely worth trying.

Aún no he tenido la oportunidad de cocinar esta receta, pero creo que es deliciosa, sobre todo por la combinación de las uvas con el vino blanco.
