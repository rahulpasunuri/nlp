Best chicken wings I ever made. Will be making them the next time I entertain. I'm sure it'll be a hit!

An exceptionally delicious and healthy alternative to fried chicken wings. While I normally do not care much for curried dishes, the marriage of spices blends perfectly, with none overpowering the others. As for substitutions, I would not recommend substituting basil for cilantro, as this would make the finished marinade way too pungent.

Errata to my review: I meant, "with all the marinating and basting" (not baking) it would be hard to get them crusty. Also, I used an actual curry powder (mix of various spices) and not the regular yellow curry powder. Finally, I would not recommend substituting basil for cilantro in this or any other recipe.

A very nice and different way to make wings. I agree with the reviewer who said to add some salt to the recipe. I also marinated overnight and the meat was very tender. However, the recipe says to bake until crusty - I baked for 1 hour and 15 minutes and they were nowhere near crusty. I don't know if you could really get them crusty with all the marinading and baking. Too bad - crispy would be much better. But they were still very good. Be sure to chop the onions very small.

This recipe is much improved by lightly salting the wings before adding them to the marinade and a little salt added to the marinade.

This recipe completely sucks. The only thing I changed was basil for cilantro, but that had nothing to do with how much it completely sucked. Don't make it. You'll be disappointed. The ingredients make it look sooo good. There is SO much good stuff in this, but yet, it ends up NASTY.

Sorry, but I didn't enjoy this dish at all. Maybe I did something wrong but I followed the recipe exactly and I just didn't enjoy it. My husband said it was different but O.K.

i made the chicken wings and tried to bbq them but they burnt. but the marinade smells so wonderful, i'm not giving up on the recipe. then i made the yogurt glaze with some prawns and bbq'd them and they were wonderful.

YUM. Guests for a cocktail party loved these, and they weren't even adventurous types. Marintated the chicken overnight--it fell off the bone! Seriously, this is tangy goodness with a slight ethnic twist. Really, really good recipe followed exactly.

This is delicious! I left out the curry powder and let the wings marinate in the sauce overnight. A real winner.
