Had great hopes for this one, reviews were so good, however it was not to be. The sauce was not that good and it was not moist enough,it did need more filler. Definately not a keeper. 1 fork is being kind.

I have been making this for years and I only wish I could thank Lish Nelson for this recipe. I loved the story that went with it when it ran originally and it has brought my family much joy on cold snowy nights in Salem, MA when I make our "favorite comfort food". My family has called it Lish Nelson's meatloaf, Lish McNeil's meatloaf (don't know how we came up with that new last name) and mostly it is "can we have Lishs' meatloaf this weekend?" Thank you Lish wherever you are! Jeff in Salem Mass.

followed the recipe as written with the exception that i poured off the liquid from roasting pan prior to re-glazing. used the additional glaze as sauce over the top as suggested. this was delicious, and my whole family enjoyed it.

Rating: 4
The only meatloaf I make. I agree with other reviewers that the sauce is too thin. Easy to remedy be either reducing the water or adding tomato puree. To get the sauce to permeate the meat, I use something about the width of a chopstick to make wholes all over it. I use all of the sauce during cooking, not reserving any to serve on the side.

This makes a moist yet sliceable meatloaf. Has been in my menu rotation for yrs. now; sometimes I use balsamic/dijon sometimes not. Usually end up using 1 3/3 c. tom. sauce and 1/4 c. water for sauce (size of large tin). Family favourite and has beaten out Grandma's meatloaf with my son! Sandra McNally Calgary/Panama

I don't know why this is so popular. IMHO, there's not enough 'filler' for the amount of meat. And, the sauce ends up like simple BBQ sauce. Who needs to baste a meatloaf 3 times while it cooks? I'd rather have that flavor inside the loaf.

Rating: 4
LOVE this recipe, which is all about the sauce (talk of gravy with meatloaf makes me queasy). I use 25% grd pork/75% grd beef, 1/2t each kosher salt and freshly grd black pepper, 2 eggs, 4 minced garlic cloves, 2 slices of good wheat bread (pulverized in a food processor) and 2T Worcestershire sce. I sometimes saute the onion, but not always, since I like raw onion. After mixing the meatloaf, I gently pack it into a plastic wrap-lined loaf pan, invert it on a rack, and bake as directed. As for the basting sauce: no water (but I've added good beer in the past, and just reduced the sauce longer) 1c tomato sce, 2T Worcestershire sce, 1/4c balsamic vinegar, 1/4c yellow (or Barhyte garlic) mustard, and 1/4c Splenda Equal Measure. Brown sugar might be tastier, but Splenda does a dang fine job, and saves carbohydrates (for those of us who must watch them for medical reasons). Forgive me for detailing how I make this, but my computer crashed last year, and I don't want to lose it again! It's a wonderful meatloaf recipe, but again, it's the sauce (even WITH Splenda) that sends it over the top. Best.Meatloaf.Recipe.EVER.

My family and I love this meatloaf. I used beef/pork and veal... I also found the sauce a bit watery so I cooked it down a bit to thicken. Well worth the effort because it's delicous!

Easy but not good. I didn't even care for the watery glaze, which there is far too much of. My husband thought it was good, but my children and I didn't like it. I thought it might improve overnight, but it didn't. Wast of time - don't bother.

used whole wheat bread and a beef-veal-pork mixture, but otherwise followed the recipe pretty closely. found so much grease (juices) during the first three bastings that I tipped the dish over each time to drain it. sounds like a bad idea but trust me, at the end the result was more than juicy and flavorful enough for all. also boiled the sauce down more than was required to get a nice glaze. absolutely delightful -- hubby is already requesting again.

Rating: 4
This meatloaf was fantastic. I used oats instead of bread & added garlic to the onions before sauteing. I was skeptical about the sauce before it was put on but it made the meat so moist & delicious. I would half the sauce recipe as I had a lot leftover after basting. My husband & 16 month old son loved this recipe & I will definitely make it again.

This is my family's favorite comfort food meal now! I made the recipe for the sauce the first time I made this but subsequently, I have just added dry mustard and brown sugar to ketchup and it's just as good if not better and much easier and faster.

This was a nice variation on the completely tomato-based meatloafs. I did substitute a few things, simply because of what I had available; however I would do this in any meatloaf recipe just because of our preferences. I used whole wheat bread instead of white bread (we prefer the uneven, more homemade texture rather than the uniform texture you get from using breadcrumbs - breadcrumb versions remind of us of a TV dinner). Also, I used marinara sauce rather than plain tomato sauce with the meat. I would think without the marinara or similar seasonings, the meatloaf itself could be bland. Also, I didn't bother saute'ing the onions prior to mixing in; I never have, and don't think the extra time is worth it. One previous poster was bothered by putting "raw onions" in a recipe, but they aren't raw after you cook the meatloaf! I do chop them quite fine before adding. We served this with mashed potatos and green beans, and would have it again. Incidentally, I tasted the sauce in the pan as it was cooking, and was a little worried - but somehow, when poured over the meatloaf, it is just great!

Rating: 2
Liked this one alot, but not as much as my own made up recipe. Made by the book, just took advice & made the bread cubes half the size. Had to drain the pan 3-4 times while baking, too much liquid. Just put the sauce on twice, but used at the table & again with very good sandwiches the next day. I suspect my ground round(not butcher ground, but from Safeway)had high water content!

Rating: 4
All I can say is WOW. I made this as the recipe called for with the exception of home grown Marinara instead of tomatoe sauce and could not stop eating it. I had it for dinner last night, wife and kids gobbled it up. I had it agian for breakfast and lunch today. Great stuff.

I used a mixture of ground pork and ground beef. The sauce is excellent. My wife usually puts catsup on her meatloaf...not today. I'm adding this to my recipe box.

My family asks for this meatloaf every week, I suspect that the people who give it low marks may prefer Swanson Meatloaf TV Dinners? I do follow the advice of some others to avoid this being to dry. I use 1# ground round and then for a drier meat 1/2# ground buffalo (available at specialty stores) and 1/2# ground duck leg meat. Definetly DO saute onions first, I also add some grated galangal and grated orange peel to add zest (also comliments the duck!), also saute with about a tblsp of finely chopped turnip in 1 tbsp butter and 1/4 cup bourbon. I do agree that the large bread chunks can make it fall apart so I use 1/2 cup each ground matzo and ground chick peas. Instead of either the ballpark mustard or dijon I use three tblsp. sweet soy plus 1 tsp. oyster liqour with ground dark and light mustard seed. My family really doesn't care for tomatoe based foods so I substitute 1 cup of plum sauce (also compliments the duck and buffalo). DO NOT over baste this dish, once after 45 minutes is plenty and I use a mixture of worcherstire sauce, franks red hot sauce, an just a smidgen of molasses then sprinkle with dark brown sugar and some additional grated orange peel. With this variation I don't even need to add the eggs, as I can not eat dairy products. Absolutely the best meatloaf ever!!!!

As far as meatloaf goes, I've had better. Next time I will make my old tried & true. But this sauce-----It IS about the sauce. Friends have asked when I would be making this again. It was a night for compfort food & I chose this. And I'm consisdered a "gourmet" cook. Just goes to show ya. Sometimes the comfort foods win out. This one sure did.

I splashed in some Worcehstershire to the meat. Also, I only basted 2 times with the pungent vinegar sauce...and then only light basting...I think recipe calls for too much basting, which may make meatloaf floating in too much sauce. Mine came out excellent! Everyone RAVED!

As suggested, I sauted onion w/ garlic. I also used 1 lb. ground sirloin and 1/2 lb. each of ground lamb and pork. To the egg mixture I added a small amount of oregano and worchestershire and to the sauce I also added a small amount of worchestershire sauce and some tomatoe paste to thicken it up. I also found I needed to add a some extra bread to thicken the mixture up a little and I just used 1/3 cp. plain, precrushed bread crumbs in addition to the 1&1/4 cup wheat loaf bread.This made an incredible meatloaf!

As suggested, I sauted the onion with garlic before adding to the mixture. As usual with meatloaf it got better and better as the week went on. Im going to make it a day early from now on. Use lean meat!

I made this meatloaf because it was cold out and I wanted a comfort food dinner.I took advice of others and caramelized the onions, and added a chopped garlic clove. I don't keep white bread in the house,so I used a dense whole wheat. Having no tomato sauce, I substituted diced tomatoes that I then pureed. No brown sugar called for another substitution-I racked my brain and came up with barbeque sauce-there's molasses in that; added extra catsup to cut the smoke, and some tomato paste as well. I used half balsamic and half cider vinegar. Put this on to boil- Pee-yew! I don't know why someone said the house smelled good- mine stank.(The vinegar. Not to be daunted at this point, I pressed on.) Testing the sauce, I was dismayed at the heavy taste of barbeque, but I thought about it and realized that the flavor changes when it caramelizes. I always preview meatloaf or meatballs by cooking a teaspoon first, and I thought this needed more salt. I added some, and finished up as written. IT WAS GREAT!! I'll definitely make this again and again.My sauce was really good, but I will make as written next time. A forgiving recipe that lends itself to interpretation- two thumbs up!

My husband is super picky and loves this dish. It's all about the sauce! One twist to cut down on cooking time (and if you have some non meatloaf lovers)is to make meatballs instead of meatloaf. As far as the meat itself being bland, I used Italian breadcrumbs instead of plain white bread. I think it really helped.

The only reason I made this meatloaf is because I haven't gone grocery shopping and I had all of the ingredients on hand. It was very easy to make, but not out of this world. I'll make it again for the kids, since they're quite picky. I substituted 1 cup of panko bread crumbs for the white bread that the recipe calls for. I prefer using panko in my recipes. I did like the idea of pouring the sauce over the meatloaf throughout the cooking time.

Add a baked potato and it's comfort food supreme! p> I subbed Emeril tomato sauce, added garlic and dry mustard to the meat, and one time used balsamic vinegar because I was out of the cider. Other reviewers indicated that it fell apart too easily, so I drained the liquid off every 30 minutes and added it to the sauce to reduce. The loaf still comes out moist and the overall flavor is great. A keeper!

For years, I've been making what was called "perfect" meatloaf, published in the Cooks Illustrated magazine and in the "best recipe" series. Well, they are all wrong. This is really the "best recipe" and far exceeds what I've been making. The meatloaf was moist and flavorful, sauce was delicious. OK, I did make just a few minor substitutions. I sauteed onions and garlic (like other reviewers, also like the "best recipe"). Added just a bit of mustard to the meatloaf. Mine took about 1 1/2 - 2 hours to reach 160 degrees. The wait was worth it!

The sauce is what makes this meatlof. I added the carmelized onions and garlic as suggested but it really was pretty bland...adding some pork would really help the flavor. It really isn't much without the sauce. I would make my regular meatloaf with a mix of meat and use this sauce.

This was a great recipe to start from. I didn't have a lot of the ingredients though! I used 2 lbs. ground turkey breast meat, 2 eggs, Italian seasoning, dried minced onions and garlic. Like suggested, I used balsamic vinegar, no water but 1 c. of the tomato sauce. Panko bread crumbs were a great substitution. I actually baked it for a while and then put it in the microwave for a while then back in the oven (I used a glass loaf dish).

I found this meatloaf to have great flavor; although I did deviate from the original recipe. I had no tomato sauce, didn't run to the store, so I used Ragu Chunky Style Tomato, Onion & Garlic Spaghetti Sauce instead. I also sauteed the onion & garlic. Come to think of it, I did not have alot of the ingredients, and ended up making many substitutions on the original recipe! I used Chinese Hot Mustard! I used Balsamic vinegar! I used two eggs! Anyway, my husband LOVED it and told me to keep whatever recipe I used and ALWAYS make it the same way...that's probably not possible, seeing as I changed almost everything! The only problem was that the loaf was too soft...even with the two eggs, and did not slice nicely, even the next day. I only made half of the sauce called for, as I read the comments here before making it, and thought it may be too sweet. Although it was delicious with the meatloaf, it was very sweet and a bit too much for us.

Rating: 4
This is the best meatloaf recipe I've tried in a while. I usually make a pretty standard meatloaf (with just ketchup or tomato sauce on the top) but this one has a nice taste with the sauce on the top and the loaf stays super juicy. Someone mentioned that the meatloaf was too "bready" at the end. I have had this happen to me also. Bread slices are often larger than life now a days, so if you get a loaf of thick and large sliced bread, reduce the amount you use (i.e. the Pepperidge Farm "Hearty White" bread is very thick and dense, maybe only use 1 slice). Also, make the pieces smaller, slightly larger than crumbs, you can do this in a food processor if you'd like. (Don't use more than 2 slices even though it will measure less than 1 and 1/4 cups because the pieces will be so small) I think 1/2 inch pieces are too large. White bread tends to be "spongey" too so sometimes I use wheat bread, great alternative for a healthier loaf too! I have not tried wheat in this loaf, but it always works out wonderfully in my standard loaf.

M-m-m good. A really tasty meatloaf, especially because of the sauce on top added while it was in the oven -- it made for a kicky little exterior "crust." It was a huge hit with my kids (3 & 1 yr). I agree with the other reviewers who recommended carmelizing the onions and adding some garlic before mixing it with the meat. However, as tasty as the sauce made the exterior, the sauce was not something I wanted to "serve on the side" -- I found it too sweet and, well, a little harsh on its own. (I am a heathen and still prefer gravy with my meatloaf.) Still, this will become a welcome regular in our house.

My husband loves this and we make this often especially in the winter. I carmalize the onions and some garlic first and I use balsamic vineagar instead of cidar vineagar. I never measure anything, so I just add brown sugar to taste and sometimes katchup. Also I top the meat loaf with a little bit of katchup and then slices of bacon and later cover with sauce. Its nummy!

Our old meatloaf recipe will never darken my family's dinner plates again. Got up early and decided to make this recipe before-hand, as we have things going on this evening. The house smells like heaven from that baked meatloaf and the sauce. I used home-made chicken stock instead of the water, and balsamic vinegar instead of cider vinegar. In addition, to the drippings left in the pan, I added a bit of butter, and flour and some water, to made a 2nd sauce to use on the meatloaf or potatoes in case we run out of the 1st! I've already had 2 pieces of meatloaf and it's not even 10 a.m.

Love the sauce with the changes others had suggested: chicken stock instead of water; balsamic vinegar instead of regular vinegar; dijon mustard instead of Ballpark mustard. The loaf, though, didn't hold up very well and tended to come apart in chunks when I tried to slice it. The flavor was good. I used my vintage Westinghouse roaster, which I always have used with success for meatloaf recipes, but this one may come out better in the regular oven. I'll definitely try this again, using the regular oven next time, and see if it comes out any better.

This is probably the best meatloaf recipe I've ever tried. I cut the recipe in half since I only had one pound of ground beef, and added a few dashes of worcestershire sauce. To the sauce I threw in a few tablespoons of sweet hot jalapeno relish, and boy did that give it a kick! I also baked it in a loaf pan which made it much more moist since it cooked in it's juices. That probably added a little more fat to the dish, but who cares. It's meatloaf! Served with baked sweet potatoes and stir fried veggies, it was comfort food at it's best! Will definitely make this again, and again!

I think I have to agree with Miss Good, how do u know what it tastes like, if you add different things and never tried out the original product. The first time i made it, i thought it was pretty good, according to recipe, the second time I made it i changed it a bit. I still kept the basic meatloaf recipe, i omitted the mustard, and made the sauce with just tomatoe sauce in a can, brown sugar to taste with a dash of vinegar, not alot for those who don't like it.

To be honest, I'm not a big meatloaf fan. But the men in the family certainly enjoyed it, and it is one of the best I've tried. Leftovers made delicious sandwiches, with some of the reheated sauce drizzled onto the bread. Homey and comforting, without a doubt. And easy!

This was not only extremely easy to prepare, but easily one of the best meat loafs I've ever had. I did add some ground ginger, garlic and a coupla chillies to the ground meat, and even experimented with lamb, and then with turkey. The turkey version tasted as good as with any other meat, and the ginger/garlic and chillies were a big improvement. I would further suggest that instead of a 5"x9" loaf recommended, use a larger surface area and shallower depth for a more crusted loaf.

The best meatloaf ever. I followed the recipe exactly. I did let the sauce cook down a bit-it took the bite out and mellowed the flavors. It was almost like a tomato soup consistancy. My family loved it. I sided it with baked sweet potatoes and fresh string beans. The sweetness of the potatoes went great with the sauce.

This is the best meatloaf recipe! I have made it many, many times and it s delicious. In fact, I read about THIS RECIPE from Epicurious in The New York Times! I hate to say it, but I am not sure why the other reviewer had such a distaste for this recipe... It is easy and quite tasty (especially the sauce!)

This dish was very yummy...my boyfriend really liked it. When I was making it, it was a bit mushy so I added breadcrumbs. I also had to bake it for an hour longer than it suggested (but it was still lovely and moist).

Great recipe--the sauce is what makes it especially good. I sauteed the onion in olive oil for a couple of minutes before adding to beef mixture, and also made with ground beef and ground turkey. I followed others suggestions and added some worcestire sauce. I made it with 2 eggs, but think that was too much. Next time I will use just 1 egg. I used 1 cup of bread crumbs and 1 slice of bread. I think you need to use the bread, it's what holds the meatloaf together. Also, next time I am going to add some green peppers with the onion in order to add more texture to meatloaf. Don't listen to the people that say not to use the onion: it's fine, it's good. They probably didn't dice it up enough. Without the onion, I wouldn't have liked the meatloaf as much. Also, I think next time I will use ALL beef, not sure how I like turkey in my meatloaf.

This is a pretty nice recipe. Instead of water I used Sam Adams beer. Also, I added some worcestershire sauce and about a teaspoon of horse radish.

This was pretty good. Made a couple of substitutions myself. Used "MuirGlen"chunky tomato sauce, deleted the water in the sauce as did others and opted for bread crumbs instead of bread. I think next time I make it I will use red wine instead of red wine vinegar. Made a nice meal with scalloped potatoes and fresh succotash.

I don't usually like meatloaf at all but this one is good. I had left over ground beef which I had to use up so gave it a try. I followed everybody's recommendations on the mustard, vinegar, water, but used tomato soup insead of tomato sauce. This is delicious!

Rating: 3
This was a great recipe after some small changes. I did not add water to the sauce, and I doubled the sugar, mustard, and vinegar, and added 1 cup of tomato sauce. I then added one cup of this mixture to the beef mixture, instead of just the cup of tomato sauce. It was a hit for dinner last night.

Rating: 4
We really enjoyed this and have made it a couple of times. My parents who are somewhat picky even enjoyed it. I did the following substitutions/additions: bread crumbs in place of bread, 1 lb. of 90% lean hamburg plus 1 lb. of a veal/pork/beef mixture in place of the 2 lbs. of chuck (very flavorful and less calories), red wine vinegar in place of cider vinegar and I added parsley flakes, garlic powder and onion powder (to taste). The gravy is truly the best and really makes the recipe unique!

This was the second time I made this and it came great this time compared to the last time which was just OK. I used Gulden's spicy brown mustard instead of yellow, balsamic vinegar instead of cider vinegar and used 1/2 beef broth with 1/2 cup water based on all the feedback. I should have used less onion also based on the feedback but I will do that next time. Thanks for all the great comments on this one. I am still learning how to cook so this site is invaluable to me.

There were so many great reviews that I let you guys talk me into making this. But I wasn't really enthused with all the seemingly strange ingredients. Besides, meatloaf is meatloaf, right? Well....it was wonderful! My son said the same thing so many others have: "Dad, I really don't like meatloaf, but this is really good!" I made the same substitutions most others have, since they seemed to make sense. Balsamic instead of cider vinegar, dijon instead of that nasty yellow mustard, and beef broth instead of water, which I cut to 1/2 cup as others have done. I really liked the way it tasted without adding additional sauce on top of it, but decided to try a piece that way - and it was even better! Definitely a winner, this one will be our standard meatloaf recipe in the future.

I agree with Lena from Boston, definitely bland. But I'd make it again with my own variations and adjustments. I'd use real old bread crumbs and spice it up a bit more with italian seasonings.

From reading the reviews, it sounds like the ones who have their own recipes, didn't like this one. Seems to me if you're used too and like the old family favorite than stick to it! I made this version tonight. I used bread crumbs and ketchup because I was out of tomato sauce. I added very little water and (and not quite sure about the vinegar?) added only a splash of red wine vinegar and a splash of worcestershire sauce to the topping. We all liked it. I took advice from below and cooked it longer at a lower temp. It was nice and moist.

I have made this dish twice now. The second time was much better than the first for these 3 reasons: I used 2 eggs instead of one; I used 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup red wine instead of 1 cup water; and I slow cooked it for ~2 hours at 250 instead of 325. Oh yea, I also crumbled 4 peices of whole wheat instead of 2 white. This was the best so far.

No "ew-ew-ew" from me, either. This one was easy to make and very tasty. Next time I make it I'll switch to bread crumbs. The bread just didn't break down enough. The sauce carmelized nicely when baking and turned very sweet rather than the tangy-mustardy taste of the "raw" sauce (which was good, too).

What a disaster!!! I have two boys in my house, which I refer to as the "basking sharks" because they sort of wander around with thier mouths open eating all day. They will eat anything. And they both love meatloaf. But this recipe is *so* bad, the oldest pushed himself away from the table, went to his room, and quietly called the pizza guy. I think it was the vinegar that made it truly awful.

No "ew-ew-ew" here. THIS IS WONDERFUL!!! I never have liked meatloaf myself (not even my mom's -shhh!) BUT this is exactly the zesty sauce that makes it exceptional. My friends loved it too! I have been making this for about 2 years now -- I enjoy it everytime:)

Tonight I am trying a lamb chop recipe from a while back, will rate tomorrow.

Poppy, I tried emailing you direct, didn't work... It constantly amazes me that people post effusive positive reviews for a recipe they didn't even use! If you are substituting, halving/doubling, or omitting most of the "distinctive" ingredients, then you are making a different meatloaf (which is an excellent idea, since any recipe that suggests you add raw onions to meatloaf is just disgusting). Anyway, I would simply make the far, far superior "Old-Fashioned Meat Loaf" that originated in Gourmet in 1994. This one was disappointing at best, a waste of ingredients at worst.

I have to agree with Poppy. I made this recipe exactly as stated (thought I'd actually give the original recipe a try before making any changes)and we had to throw most of it away. We love meatloaf, I'm a good cook, but this one just didn't do it for us. The meatloaf was unexciting but we found the sauce actually unpleasant - far too strong and vinegary.

NO NO!! This is the second time I've made this, and this is the second time I've thrown the leftovers away -- and I'm a good cook.

I'm on a search for a great traditional meatloaf. Any suggestions?

Have now tried it twice. As meatloafs go -- and it IS my #1 comfort food -- I would say this one is so-so. However, The Man I Love loved it, so.... I used whole wheat bread, egg whites, and a dash of allspice. Thought the water would dilute the sauce, but it didn't -- whisking was important! Will utilize balsamic suggestion next time. Chacun son gout. Sigh.

I made this recipe for my parents...My father is NOT a tomato fan, therefore is tends to not like traditional meatloaf. I only made one substitution (2/3 cups croutons for the white bread). It was a HUGE hit! I agree with the previous reviewer - how can you rate a recipe if you completely change it! Next time I will make a few changes (use balsamic vinegar, dijon and maybe add some worchester sauce as others recommended). Great recipe and one that will be fun to build on!

Florida - cute little poem but are you rating the recipe or your own cleverness? You say you couldn't eat it, but you gave it 3 forks?

I made this over the weekend and it was just so-so. Think I will stick with my tried and true. Like other reviewers I use a variety of ground meats but I also add hot horseradish and garlic as well as a lot of herbs. I started with the basic receip in the Joy of Cooking and then kept improvising from there. I like to cook mine in a clay pot cooker like the Romertopf. This makes a very moist meatlaf and you can line the pot with sliced potatoes that soak up the juices and get all crispy! Yummy but not very dietetic! The sauce was OK but not spicey and we love spicey meatloaf. Might make the sauce again seperatly and jazz it up w/ either chipotle peppers or some fun, well flavored hot sauce.

As far as meatloaf goes, this one is delicious. It is so moist and the sauce is terrific. For the sauce I substituted balsamic vinegar for the cider and dijon mustard for the yellow. For the meat I used wheat bread instead of white and two eggs instead of one. I also omitted the onions.

I used day old french bread with crust on & soaked in milk for 10 minutes rather than plain bread. Also used garlic (of course) with the onion which I sweat first. Added basil and oregano and grated romano cheese. For the sauce, instead of water, used beef broth. Other than that we liked it.

To Sam Gomer: Thanks for your suggestions. I made the meatloaf with your recipe (using V8) except using 4 oz. sausage(all I had) and bread cubes not the oats. For the sauce I again used a cup of V8, brown mustard, no water; also used part basamic/part cider vinegar to make it milder. It was wonderful. I formed it then baked it in a larger pan to let the fat escape. Your meatloaf was moist and tender but still held together, the sauce made a wonderful glaze. Sauteeing the veggies adds a lot to the final flavor. Thanks again.

This is a wonderful meatloaf! I like to use 1# ground round; 1/2# ground pork; and 1/2# ground veal for a finer texture. I also used whole-grain mustard and a good balsamic vinegar in the sauce, as well as beef stock, instead of water. The quality of the vinegar makes a big difference in the sauce.

Sauce is great, Better recipe follows: 1 1/2 lb hamburger 1/2 lb ground sausage Cup of oatmeal small can tomato juice (or V-8) 1 beaten egg 3/4 to 1 cup diced celery 3/4 to 1 cup diced onion 1 clove garlic, crushed Large pinch of crushed basil (secret to great the taste) 1/4 teas crushed red peppers (optional) a couple shakes of cayenne pepper (optional) To taste: salt, freshly ground pepper, Lawry's seasoned salt, catsup, any mustard. In skillet and hot oil, saute onion, celery, garlic. Mix all together, put in loaf pan, bake 350 about 1 hour 10 minutes or until browned well on top.

those who thought this was bland must have something wrong with their tastebuds! this a great, simple recipe..and the whole family loved it. if the sauce seems too "vinegary", simply cut back the vinegar a bit or add more brown sugar. make mashed potatoes to go with it..and poor the extra sauce on them! reminds me of my childhood!

Two years ago my husband was begging me to make meatloaf. I finally made this one as my first. Two years later he still loves it. I used shallots instead of onion, add cayenne pepper and herbs, and substitute balsamic vinegar and dijon mustard and deleted water in the sauce. I buy the leanest ground beef I can find and take the fat out as it cooks. Very easy. Best meatloaf I ever had.

Great recipe. I followed the suggestions: used beef broth, dijon mustard and balsamic vinegar in sauce. Also used sour dough bread. My three-year-old, who is a very picky eater, had three helpings.

I've never made meatloaf before, but I thought this was easy and, surprisingly, yummy (given all the meatloaf jokes in the world.)

I don't know who Lish Nelson is, but I thinks she stole this recipe from my mother-in-law. ;-) This recipe is a duplicate of my mother-in-law's meatloaf recipe with the ingredients doubled. However, I think there ought to be two eggs as her's, for one lb of meat, uses one egg. I LOVE this meatloaf and the key really is the sauce. My recipe is even easier in that you put the loaf in the pan, pour the sauce over the top and cook. Yummy!

Made this two nights ago much to boyfriend's delight--tonight we had leftovers and he asked if we could have it again tomorrow! Added 2T Worcestshire to both meat and sauce as suggested, used 1/2 cup oatmeal rather than bread and used Balsamic/Dijon. I found meatloaf very crumbly first night, however, and I did let it sit 10 min before slicing. Would this be because I used a lesser proportion of oatmeal rather than called-for bread? Thanks if anyone can help with this as I will be making this again.

What makes this really good is the sauce - I think meatloaf is meatloaf. I added 2T. Worcestershire sauce to both the meatloaf and the sauce, used 1 lb. each of beef and pork, used 1 1/2 c. garlic crouton crumbs instead of the bread, and only used about 1/4 water in the sauce to cut the Dijon tang a bit. I sliced the leftovers and froze with little containers of sauce for later lunches, which worked beautifully.

Made the recipe as shown, except used half beef/half pork. We all liked it, even the kids. The sauce was very different, but it tasted great on the meat! I made it into three little meatloaves and froze the remaining two. There was a ton of sauce left over, and next time I'll make half as much!

I've taken bits and pieces of the other reviews, and *love* the results!

Wonderfully delicious!

It's the sauce! The meatloaf is a meatloaf BUT the sauce is the thing.

YUM YUM YUM. Meatloaf has long been a bit of a joke dish in my house, but no longer!! One suggestion though, I sweated the onions off with 3 cloves of garlic in a pan before adding to the meat mixture - eliminates "crunchy" onions. So good for day-after sandwiches.

Delicious meatloaf recipe. I used 1 1/2 pounds of ground beef and 1/2 pound of pork and I added about 2 tablespoons of worcestshire sauce to the meat mixture. In the sauce I omitted the water completely and used balsalmic vinegar instead of the cider vinegar. I also added about two tablespoons of worcestshire sauce. Instead of yellow mustard, I used a dijon mustard. The sauce was excellent!!!! I got rave reviews and the last piece was eaten the next day for lunch. Definitely the best meatloaf I have ever made.

I made the following changes: Used two 7 1/2x3 3/4" loaf pans. Last baking time 50-55 mins. Froze one for serving later. To make more attractive, score top in diamond pattern, also h elps to hold glaze in place. TO SAUCE: I added 2T worchestershire sauce; 1/4 teas Asian chile garlic sauce; pinch of sugar; pinch of garlic powder. Simmered 1/2 hour to thicken. TO MEAT: used whole wheat bread-crumbed in food processor; 2 eggs; 2T worchestershire sauce; 3T Heinz chili sauce to replace tomato sauce. 1/2 Cup beef broth to replace water. Enjoyed it very much

I took the advice of Dr. Don and Tanya from Salisbury, MD and slathered the leftover meatloaf with barbecue sauce and grilled it. They were correct, it was the MEATLOAF OF THE CENTURY! As for the night I made it, I thought it was ok, it was meatloaf, but of course my husband LOVED it.

I loved this recipe. I substituted Italian seasoned bread crumbs, 1 cup, and a can of condensed minestrone(Campbells) soup instead of the tomato paste. Skip the sugar too.

I read most of the reviews and took their suggestions into my kitchen and I got a delicious meatloaf!!! I used 3 TBLS of ketchup into the loaf instead of tomato sauce. I finely grated 1 cup of carrots for a healthier touch. My husband and I loved it. I'm saving the recipe!!!!

I like the ease of this recipe but something was missing. Added worcestershire sauce to the meat AND the sauce. Also subsituted whole wheat bread for white bread. Made a world of difference. Omitted the water and used the remaining tomato sauce plus cut back on the vinegar. Fool around w/ the sauce - each time I seem to make it more to our liking. No need for cornstarch if you only use tomato sauce. Just make sure you boil it a while.

My husband's been asking to have meatloaf, and not being a big meatloaf fan, I was less than thrilled! But after reading all of the raves for this recipe, thought I'd try it. It is the best meatloaf I've ever had. I even had seconds!! I also compiled the suggestions/substitutions from the others, and it was incredible. You've got to try this meatloaf!

This is really exceptional meatloaf. I used whole wheat bread instead of white, and I ran it under water and squeezed. Took the advice of others and only used 1/4 cup of water in the sauce. Also added a couple of TBS of beer. Bravo!

Followed the suggestion of others and substituted 1 1/2 cups oats for the bread. Also added about 1/4 cup each of Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar and vineger to the beef prior to blending, and used only 1/2 can tomato puree in both the beef and the sauce. This made the beef tastier and the sauce less watery. Served with garlic mashed potatoes. My husband said it's even better than his mother's and that's going some! Definitely a keeper.

I have made this recipe half a dozen times. everyone likes it. I do not add one cup of water to the glaze as that makes it watery. I use 1/4 cup of water and simmer it far longer untils its thickened.

Okay everyone, here is the MEATLOAF OF THE CENTURY. Modifiy recipe as follows: Substitute 3/4 cups of oats per lb. of beef in place of bread and use 1 egg and 3/4 teaspoon of salt per lb. of beef. Leave everything else the same, bake and cool your meatloaf. NOW, THE GOOD PART. Cut into 1 1/2 inch thick slices. Coat on all sides with barbecue sauce (bottled, any brand, I use Kraft) and GRILL meatloaf slices on the barbecue until well charred. That's it - you will have the most moist and best tasting meatloaf there is. Enyoy!

Wonderful and easy recipe, after reading the reviews, substituted the vinegar for basalmic vinegar, used less water and since I made this for St. Paddys Day, added some Guinness!! Made the meatloaf in the shape of a clover and ate it all up! Also added canned mushrooms to the sauce after the second basting of the meat, and served it with garlic mashers. Enjoy this yummy meatloaf.

I modified this recipe to include a pound each of lean ground beef and lean ground pork, one cup of finely shredded carrots. This replaced the bread crumbs, egg and tomato sauce in the meatloaf. For the sauce, I removed the brown sugar and added Ketchup and crushed chillies to the tomato sauce. In all, the meatloaf had rave reviewsseveral occasions from my dinner companions.

Happy Valentines Day! Corny as it seems, every V.D. I make a heart shaped meatloaf. The kids get a kick out of it. Anyway, I've made a lot of meatloaf's in my life and have tryed it many ways. This was definitely good but I've gotten the same results with a bottled sweet/sour barbeque sauce. As some reviewers said, the sauce was watery, so as soon as it came to a boil I thickened it with corn starch. It made all the difference. By the way, will someone out there please try the Mocha Crunch Icecream cake? Only one other person beside myself have reviewed this wonderful dessert. It takes a little effort, however, it's well worth it. Yum!!!!!!!!

Delicious! Made this for the 2nd time. I too substituted beef broth for water and balsalmic for cider vinegar. I didn't have enough mustard this time and the sauce was much better. It was moist but held together quite well. My husband the critic loved it!

THis sounded wonderful but was extremely disappointing. Too moist and did not hold togeather very well. Tasted ok but nothing to write home about, since there were alot of leftovers I will try it in sandwiches maybe it will be better.

Yum! This is the first meatloaf I've ever made. Actually I used to hate meatloaf, but recently I tried my boyfriend's in a restaurant and found myself craving it (maybe because I'm anemic). I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and my mother loved it. She can't wait to eat the leftovers on sandwiches tomorrow.

I have to tell you, I have never been a fan of meatloaf...until now that is. My boyfriend asked me to make meatloaf, and I agreed to make this recipe because it sounded tasty. It was fabulous. The fact that the meatloaf is basted during the cooking process allows the meat to absorb the wonderful flavours from the tangy sauce...a sauce that is absolutely addictive in my book. I am already getting cravings for this dish again! Allison/Chicago

The only thing wrong with this recipe was that it looked kind like a big brown lump. Some haricots verts, muchrooms and onions or zucchini slices along the perimeter might jazz up the appearance a bit. But it was delicious! I wouls describe it as a sweet-and-sour meatloaf. The sauce recipe provides plenty of leftover sauce. With a big pot of roasted garlic mashed potatoes, buttery Brussels sprouts, and some nice dark beer, it makes a great winter meal!

Rating: 2
I liked this better than any meatloaf I've tried before. The sauce makes a great glaze, but no one liked it otherwise. I'll make 1/2 recipe of that next time. and just use it for basting. Take the crusts off the bread before chopping, and cut the onion very finely (I had no problem with it not cooking or combining). It did take quite a bit longer to reach the correct temperature. Maybe I need an oven thermometer! It made phenomenal sandwiches the next day.

Santa Barbara, I was glad to see your comment about not wanting to make any recipe twice. I'm the same way - I started cooking seriously about 13-14 years ago, have (almost) never made anything twice, and have tried over 3700 hundred recipes altogether! (I rate them all on a 0-10 scale, too.) My neighbors and co-workers think I'm a bit compulsive, but they happily eat the results. I will definitly try this meatloaf, based on everyone's comments - as well as the fact that I actually LOVE meatloaf. Thanks to everyone for the feedback.

This meatloaf was what most said, very, very good. Can't mess it up. With Mashed potatoes, it looked as though it could be on a restaurant menu. Will certainly make it, again, even though I hate to make recipes more than once-always looking for the new recipe. Could give it 4 forks if meatloaf could get 4.

This was an excellent meatloaf. It was moist, flavorful and savory. My boyfriend and i loved it and could not believe how easy it was to prepare. The sauce tasted great--especially over steamed vegetables and mashed potatoes.

Excellent recipe! Cook the onions pretty well before mixing them into the meat. Cut the breadcrumbs smaller than the recipe says, make sure the egg is large enough, or put in another 1/2 egg. The vinegar adds great flavor!! I make wonderful dinners and wasn't thrilled when my boyfriend asked me to make MEATLOAF...But I did it for him and he was VERY happy. The best he's ever had. OH, you may also want to cook the meatloaf five or ten minutes longer.

This recipe could be found at one time on the back of Hunt's tomato sauce cans,except that it included Worcestershire sauce and only 1/2 cup of tomato sauce is added to the meat mixture. I make this all the time, it is always well received. I have also made it into meatballs and cooked them separately in the oven until done. Then I mix up the sauce, add the meatballs, and heat in a slow cooker. This makes a great appetizer or finger food, using toothpicks to serve.

I think my shortcuts did not fair well in this dish. I used low fat ground meat; 1 1/4 c. Italian bread crumbs and cooked it at 400 degrees for 45 min. For some reason it was soft and fell apart. The sauce was good though but I didn't bother basting the meatloaf either.

The meatloaf itself was very good, with a good consistency. I added some green pepper to the recipe and it was very nice. The sauce was a little off, for my taste however, and I wouldn't use that again.

My past experiences with cooking meatloaf have not been good. They were always too dry and boring. This was moist and delicious. My husband and I ate second portions. I substituted breadcrumbs and used a jar of sauce that contained some vegetables. I too, served it with garlic mashed potatoes and peas - a real down home meal.

Rating: 4
I really liked this meatloaf. It had a nice consistancy and flavor. To prevent the lumps of meat & bread that one reader experienced, I combined the tomato sauce with the bread, egg and spices, blended well with a fork then added that to the meat. It worked well. I substituted onion powder for the onions (I prefer onions but my 6 year old doesn't) and it was still delicious.

It wasn't really anything all that special -- it's just meatloaf, after all -- but it was certainly the best I've ever made. Moist, meaty, good flavor. It held its shape nicely when sliced for sandwiches, which is the best way to have meatloaf, in my book.

If you've never had success with a meatloaf before, give this a try it is absolutely terrific. I used breadcrumbs instead of cut bread and it turned out great.

Rating: 2
the flavor in this meatloaf is great but unfortunately i had a huge problem. I cut up bread into the small pieces specified in the recipe. When you bit into it, you would either bite into a soft mush chunk of bread or hard ground beef - it refused to combine properly. am not sure what the solution is. Perhaps to put the bread in a food processor first? its a shame becuase the flavors were so good but the texture was awful.

This was good - sort of like a meatloaf with a sweet barbecue glaze on top. Like others, I omitted most of the water, used Dijon mustard and balsamic vinegar and added 2 minced garlic cloves. Next time I will try the half pork-half beef combo and I will add less tomato sauce since my meatloaf didn't want to stay together and had sort of a strange reddish hue (but still tasted good).

We enjoyed this meatloaf. We also added garlic and used half pork, half beef, which gives it a nice texture. The sauce is great and keeps the meatloaf juicy.

My meatloaf attempts were always memorable for being better used as bricks than as dinner. This recipe went over very well with just about everyone. I made 2 seperate ones one with and without the glaze as it called for sugar and we have a diabetic in the house. It's good both with and without the glaze. I made mine with half beef half pork and omitted some of the water in the glaze to thicken it a bit. It made a wonderful coating on the meat and kept the meatloaf incredibly juicy.

I have never made meatloaf before, and like some, but not others. I made this recipe as a first for my inlaws. My mother-in-law is an excellent cook and they both thought it was the best meatloaf they ever tasted. I used garlic to season, two eggs instead of one, balsamic vinegar instead of cider and beef broth instead of water. I also used pork and beef (1/2 and 1/2). I loved the fact that I could pick and choose others ideas to make it better. Yumm!

I am not a meatloaf fan, but I husband LOVES meatloaf so I have been making them up as I go. He really loved this recipe so I will be making it again. I didn't have yellow mustard so I used Dijon and I, too, used balsamic vinegar and cut the water down by half. I might improvise a bit more next time...it was a litte too sweet for me, but I guess that's a classic meatloaf!

Despite the initial groans I heard when I announced that I was preparing 'meatloaf,' my usually 'picky' family loved it!!
