I have made this a couple of times and have some things I have to remind myself to do to ensure it turns out balanced and not too lemony or soggy: 1. Cut bread into small but not tiny pieces and make sure not to crowd them on the cookie sheet(s) so they toast evenly. 2. Slice the lemons 1/8" or close to roast and then chop into tiny pieces. 3. Use a very large roasting pan or 2 if you are really making a lot. 4. Add a little extra fennel if you like fennel because I love it and I feel the lemon overpowers the fennel by just a touch.

We made this for our Christmas Dinner last year. It was a huge hit and the flavors offset the traditional turkey dinner nicely. The Sour-ish lemon flavor was very interesting.

It has a nice flavor but there are better ones on this site. I don't think I will use again.

I wouldn't make this again. The lemon was overpowering and fought with the flavors in my gravy and even overpowered the fennel.

I've made a lot of different stuffings, and this wasn't my favorite, the rest of my family loved it. The fennel was a really different flavor for us, but worked perfectly, especially as part of "The Big Thanksgiving" menu from Bon Appetit. I left the crusts on my Italian peasant bread. I also added more parsley and thyme. I would make this again without changes when I wanted something very savory.

This stuffing had an excellent combination of flavors. The fennel & roasted lemon was great together. I spread it in a larger pan (15x11 I think) for more uniform baking.

This was really good and has a lot of potential. When I baked it however, the top came out really crusty and the bottom came out really soft and almost soggy. Next time I think I will trim the crusts off the bread cubes and make the cubes smaller. Any other suggestions as to how to make this stuffing reach it's potential? It could be delicious!
