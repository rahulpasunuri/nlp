I made this soup for a New Year's eve gathering and it was a huge success. First, I went by the original recipe but changed it a bit considering the ingredients I had at home. It was only after the soup was made that I read all the comments so I figured I needed to make a few changes. Yes, the soup at this point was bland. Let me tell you what I did... First, I used a bit of coconut oil & a bit of butter (for taste), to sauté the onions. I then added the butternut squash plus half a sweet potato, 1 huge Honey Crisp apple and vegetable broth. Once I read the comments, I run to buy 1 Granny Smith apple and added cinnamon & curry. Served it piping hot with chopped parsley. It could be served with toasted pumpkin seeds as well. The reason why I am giving this recipe a rating of 4 is due to the final product, taking into account the adjustments. Please try it, it is fantastic but add the spices gradually, tasting each time until you reach... perfection!

This just didn't come together no matter what I tried. I made as directed but it was overwhelmingly apple-y and otherwise flat. I ended up adding some apple cider vinegar and that helped, but it still was missing something and leaves an odd lingering flavor from the apple. The farmhouse butternut squash soup on this site is vastly better. I would not make this again and actually threw out the leftovers, everyone thought it was edible but didn't want anymore.

This is by far the worst thing I've ever made. I have no idea what went wrong but it was aweful.

Remember, squash isn't an overpowering vegetable. It lends a very subtle taste to recipes so we count on herbs and other vegetables to bring out the flavor. Roasting your onions in a broiler with a little olive oil before is another way to bring out the sweetness. Toss in a few cloves of garlic and you're set!

I made a few changes to the recipe but it turned out great. I used olive oil instead of butter, doubled up on the apples and didn't have vegetable broth so I made my own with tomatoes, garlic, basil, oregano and carrots. Instead of nutmeg I used cinnamon and added a bit of maple syrup to add some sweetness. I topped it with some parmesan cheese. I don't like pepper but my husband added some for a bit of a kick. It was quite good and I would be happy to make it again.

I work in a restaurant and made this recipe. It was not well-received. The second time I made it, I doubled the apples, added minced fresh ginger and served it with an "S" of creme fraiche and a spoonful of diced caramelized apples. Much, much better. Lots of compliments. Add a cornbread muffin with a honey/butter glaze and you have quite a meal.

The one fork is for the recipe as Antoinette suggested (2 apples). After I tasted while it was simmering, it seemed kind of one note. I added apple cider vinegar and good amounts of cinnamon and nutmeg for a little bit more depth of flavor. This is the kind of soup where it's not "wrong" to make it your own. it's just food, people. :)

I must admit, i made a few changes: i used 2 apples, cider in place of juice and half an onion sauteed in olive oil. I also added cinnamon and, here's the kicker, a dash of curry powder. it gives it a little kick and complements the flavors. YUM!

Be careful what apples you use in this. I used granny smith and doubled the amount of apples because 1. I omitted the apple juice and 2. some reviewers said they couldn't taste the apple. It was both too tart and too sweet all at once, probably due to the strong granny smith flavor. I wish I had followed the recipe, as otherwise it was very good, especially with homemade veggie stock and some added ground ginger. Easy if you get pre-cut up squash.

Rating: 1
Argh - I should have read these reviews before making the soup. Although my husband said he liked it, I found it a bit too oniony and there was something about the taste that just seemed...off. To start with, I would definitely double the apples, halve the onions, and add more nutmeg. As is, it's not very passable in my book.

Rating: 4
I made this soup for Christmas dinner. It was delicious, and received rave reviews from my family. I doubled the apples, onions nutmeg and used 16 oz. of sour cream to accommodate the number of guests. I tweaked it with cinnamon, cayenne pepper and pure maple syrup. I used the apple juice to reduce the thickness of the soup. I'll make it again.

Rating: 4
Made a few changes due to ingredients on hand in the kitchen. Substituted orange juice for apple juice and used a combination of homemade chicken stock and spicy veggie broth in the freezer. The result was a really nice tang in the beginning followed by a spicy heat at the end without interfering with the velvety texture. Also added salt & pepper to taste. Will def. make again with the changes.

Excellent- kids and adults alike loved it. Very easy and simple to prepare.

Turned out fantastic, lovely velvety mouth feel. Substituted some extra apple for the apple juice & it was great. Didn't use a blender as I Like soup to have more texture, so mashed roughly with a potato masher.

We absolutely adore this soup. We make it with organic veg. broth. Also we thin it down a little so it isn't just puree.

This is a review of the origanal recipe as sumitted by Antoinette, and not what is published on the site. I love this. The apples add a depth that apple juice never will. I sautee them with the onion and then puree it all in my blender (need a stick blender). This is almost a weekly staple in our home in the fall and winter.

You know, I am really surprised at all the favorable reviews to this recipe. It is extremely one dimensional. I have made the Butternut Squash Soup with Cider Cream (on this site) for as many as 120 guests and it is really wonderful. It makes this recipe taste like something out of a no name soup can - bland! You have to really tweak this one a lot to give it any flavor at all. For a truly satisfying soup experience please try the other one --you won't be dissapointed!

Delicious! I doubled the recipe and served it at Book Club last night. Everybody loved it! The hardest part was peeling the squash, as I was pressed for time, I just cut the edges square which wasted a bit, but still yielded plenty. Using an immersion blender right in the pot was much easier and less messy than transferring in batches to a standard upright. I think Calvados would be a nice substition for the juice and plan to try that next time.

I am the peson who submitted this recipe to Bon Apetit through a friend who worked there. It was in the Too Busy to Cook column and I submitted 3 really good recipes. They completely changed all three recipes so I was pretty shocked when the issue came out. This one didn't fare as badly as the other two, but FYI in the original recipe there is no apple juice, but rather 2 gala apples. I also didn't add nutmeg or chives. I sautee the onion in butter and add the squash, apples and broth ( I like Imagine brand), then cook until tender I then cuisinart the whole thing to puree. They actually made this recipe more difficult for reasons unknown. It is super easy and even my cooking challenged friends can make this. Trying variations is a great idea. It is a simple soup, but I love it juat as I described. I plan to stick to my original recipe.

Rating: 3
In my opinion, this recipe is absolutely divine. It has a great blend of flavors and is quite easy to make (aside from the pain of peeling the squash). People who like more aggressive foods may consider this recipe somewhat bland, but to me, it is filling, warming, savory comfort food (especially with that dollop of sour creme on top!).

This soup certainly didn't rock my culinary world, but it's nice and basic with a pleasant, mild flavor.

This is a good recipe. We're defintely going to make it again, but, with a few changes. Substitute some of the Butternut squash with cabochon, or other less sweet squash. This time we liked the taste of Plain yogurt instead of sour cream...

Served this for dinner on the first chilly evening this fall. I thought it was delicious -- used Quark (German-style soft cheese) as garnish, and it was great. This recipe is very easy to make -- and quick! One could probably even prepare a batch after coming home from work during the week. Don't know what the rather negative reviewers are talking about. I'm glad I didn't take their advice -- this was a wonderful recipe.

I found this a bit monotonous, even with crême fraîche and chives apleanty. It's not terrible, but it could use more depth.

Delicious! I followed the recipe except for a few minor changes and the soup was fantastic! First, I didn't have a large onion, so used a small one, reduced the nutmeg to 1/3 teaspoon and it was PLENTY. Also, my squash was only 3 or so pounds and it was proportional to the rest of the ingredients. My apple was not a Gala and couldn't tell a difference. Super quick and easy!

I made this recipe with a big winter squash I had from the garden. I loved the soup immediately but then I generally love squash in any form. My daughter & family came over for dinner and I served it to them. Garnished with plain yogurt and some chives, it looked beautiful; and they absolutely raved about it; in fact I had to wrestle some of it away from my daughter who wanted to take home all the leftover. I will definitely be making this again this winter.

Great recipe. It is rich and creamy without adding any cream or using a lot of butter. I used 2 small apples and added a pinch of cayenne. Delicious!

My wife loved it! Can thin more if it gets too thick. Great for a winter dinner.

Made half a batch, but forgot to halve accordingly the amount of apple and onion. Results were still spectacular. Next time I make a half batch, I'll be sure to halve both the amount of squash and onion. But I'll still use an entire apple (the amount the recipie requires for a full batch). Also took others' advice and used veggie broth and apple cider. A real winner!

The blend of squash and apple are a lovely combination. I used two apples to bring out the apple flavor. I used 5 1/2 + cups of vegetable broth; I think I would not have liked it with chicken broth. I omitted the sour cream and chives and served it instead with my version of creme fraiche--whipped cream w/out any sugar added--and a sprinkling of cinnamon on top. It was delicious! Everyone except my too-picky husband loved it at Thanksgiving dinner.

Peeling and chopping the squach takes the most time, but after that it's a breeze. I use chicken broth as other readers do. Also, I added an extra apple and used apple cider instead of apple juice. Delicious

This really is extremely good, and healthy as all get out (see sub below). I tossed in a little cinnamon and cayenne for good measure, and opted out of the apple juice in favor of a little more chopped apple. Used olive oil instead of butter -- the family is still talking about it.

not to knock this recipe, but there is another fantastic recipe similar to this one. It uses granny smith apples, and it includes a syrupy cider sauce. The recipe is here on epicurious. Before you make this soup, check out the other one, so that you can see which one is more up your alley. My husband and I can't get enough of the other one.

The butternut squash/apple combination was compelling, but I was disappointed with the results, despite addition of thyme, cayenne and an additional apple. Rather bland, though my fiancee liked it.

This is a good recipe that can be made even better with dried thyme(leaf)instead of the nutmeg. You can finish it with sour cream mixed with apple cider drizzled on top and some crostini.

Hi..I am an avid reader of epicurius.(thank you epicurious for this great site).I study all recipes and reviews,I make many vegetarian recipes.I like the adventurously artistic ones who try diferent variations..here in this review I noticed a couple who put thumbs down..I disagree with them for the reason that I dont think that (a) they probably followed the recipe, and (b)probably dont enjoy vegetables,therefore dont try the challenge to prepare them tastefully..but re sugar..I try to avoid adding this cause u can use certain sweet vegetables to arrive at the required sweetnees..adding curry flavour is great for squash, and also 35%cream,(or condensed nonsweet milk..for the fat cal conscious)is also good.but they should be brought to a quick boil first to denature them..soup will keep without turning..

I have made this soup several times using different types of squash and every time it is delicious. If the soup is too thick I use chicken broth to thin it out.

Great soup! Made it for a homecoming with grilled cheese and apple sandwiches. yum! Added more apple juice, added some curry from suggestions. Took a little of this and that from suggestions. Didn't use sherry. But might next time. Don't hesitate. Made great lunches the next week.

Modified as per the advice of U.S. Military (10/29), this was fantastic ... and that considering I used (gasp! don't tell the foodie police) bouillon cubes because I ran out of real stock. I used 3-4 sticks of celery that I wanted to get rid of, sauteed them with the onion in olive oil ('cause I prefer it to butter), then added the rest of the ingredients as per the recipe (but increased apples to 2 1 granny smith, 1 unidentified, sweeter variety). I toasted the spices (1/2 t nutmeg, pinch cayenne, 1 1/2 t curry powder, 1/4 t cumin) in a skillet and added them to the whole mess. It took an extra 1/2 c of stock or so to accommodate the extra veggies, but the final result was delicious, and creamy enough that I didn't need cream sherry or sour cream.

I have always made butternut squash soup using chicken broth, but decided to follow this recipe... use vegetable broth. Both my husband and I decided that the veggie broth covered the flavor of the squash too much. Next time I will just stick with sqaush pureed with chicken broth and spices.

I made this dinner for some friends of mine. They said that they normally don't like butternut squash but absolutlely loved this recipe. It was alittle thick so we added more broth and a little bit of sour cream to the base. Over all it was and easy and Delicious soup. Also it tastes really good if you use acorn squash instead of butternut.

Unlike the previous reviewer, I didn't tweak this recipe other than adding a little extra butter for richness as I blended it. The family, young and old, enjoyed it at our pumpkin carving gathering and asked that I make it again for Thanksgiving. High marks from this group!

DON'T LET THE LACK OF FORKS FOOL YOU!!! This is a wonderful base for an excellent soup. I, however, couldn't give it forks because I changed so many elements of the recipe. Thanks to Livonia, MI for the cumin suggestion; gs_mommy and Chicago for the curry powder suggestion. Here's what I did. (NOTE: The butter was a mis-read of the recipe. However, it added enough richness to the recipe, so no additional dairy, either sour cream or heavy cream was necessary.) 1 stick butter, browned, solids removed; 1 large onion, chopped; 1 stick celery, chopped; 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg; pinch cayenne; 1/4 teaspoon cumin; 1 1/2 teaspoon curry powder; 4 1/4 lbs butternut and acorn squash, roasted; 2 granny smith apples, roasted; 1/3 cup cream (sweet) sherry. I sauteed the vegs and spices in the butter, added the chicken broth, chucked in the apple and squash. Simmered until everything was soft (not long at all), then pureed everything with an immersion blender. Added sherry at the end. GREAT SOUP!!!!!!!

This came out tasty! And very easy. I made this with a bit of onion/celery/carrot first. Added apples..apple cider and some chicken broth. Used an immersion blender which was fine. No cream and it seemed like there was! Topped w/some scallions. Very good.

I would make it again but not as a soup; it works really well as a sauce (like applesauce) with potato (or parsnip and potato) pancakes for breakfast.

The only complaint I have is the recipe needs something else. I did add 2 apples and it was a bit too sweet. Next time, I think I will add some cumin and maybe a cinnamon stick to the broth to liven it up.

I made this soup for soup lovers and they were crazy for it. As an unskilled person in the kitchen, I found this easy to make. It takes more than 30 min. to prepare, just cutting the squash was a bit time consuming. I used a food processor instead of a blender, so I could fit it all in at once. I have a 14 cup processor and it filled it almost to the top (so you know how much this recipe makes). I would definately make it again.

I used butternut and acorn squash and I also used curry powder(1 1/2tsp) as well as nutmeg. I omitted the apple juice and used a quarter cup of calvados (apple brandy). I also used 1/2 chicken stock and 1/2 veggie stock. It was wonderful and even my fussy twelve year old liked it.

I've made this soup twice--the first time I used acorn squash and granny smith apples and other than that I followed the recipe precisely. It was wonderful--one of my favorite soups ever and that version gets four forks. The second time, I used butternut squash and a gala apple and it was very bland--I sauteed two additional onions in butter with nutmeg and added it to the soup along with lots more apple juice and the final product was once again delicious, but it took much more finagling. I love winter squash--it alone makes Minnesota falls and winters worthwhile, and this soup is a perfect way to eat it, preferaby in front of a football game with an herbed goat cheese and roasted vegetable sandwich.
