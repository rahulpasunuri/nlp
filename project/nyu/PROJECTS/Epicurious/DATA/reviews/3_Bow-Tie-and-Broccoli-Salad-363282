My husband didn't stop ranting and raving about this recipe. It is simple, but if you enjoy nuts and raisins, this is a great, easy recipe that allows you to enjoy the natural flavors. I've already made it twice.

This salad has no flavor and I don't have any idea how to improve it. I wouldn't make it again.
