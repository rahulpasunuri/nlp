The recipe 'as is' is just ok. I wouldn't make it as written again. But I did make it with the addition of spinach, onions and toasted pine nuts and left out the orange zest. Very tasty and the left-overs the next day were even better.

I made this with crumbled Feta cheese instead of Parmigiano-Reggiano and it goes excellent with the thyme

I made the dish exactly how the recipe state. However, I added one inch peices of steamed asparagus to it right before serving. It was delicious. My boyfriend and I think that next time we should add cheddar and ham instead. Pretty basic recipe and it is a great starting point.

Easy and not special.just about any pasta with a cup of cheese is yummy. I gave it three forks for orange zest which was a surprise; even though the flavor didn't fully emerge until leftovers the next day.

I had a random hankering for some orzo risotto in the grocery store and found this recipe using the Epicurious app, and I think for that as simple as this recipe is, it's awesome! I loved the orange flavor! I can't believe I could taste it as much as I could. I'd increase the thyme a little since that was lost, but other than that, it was great! After reading a few other reviews about timing, I did have the chicken stock already simmering when I added the orzo. It probably took another 10 min after that to reduce the entire way. Definitely will make again!

I knew I was in trouble when my hubby said "oh, I didnt know we were having Rice-a-Roni" for dinner. It had a nice flavor and was easy to prepare, but we werent blown away.

This was an extremely easy and tasty way to get a 'risotto' made (one of my male dinner guests handled this while I finished the salad). I substituted lemon zest and parsley for the orange zest and thyme, and used quite a bit of salt and pepper while reducing the chicken broth. Also kept lid on pot while reducing the broth. Finally, we added a small amount of chardonnay when the chicken broth was almost gone. Overall, dish was a hit!

This recipe was delicious! I also halfed it since I was cooking for one, and added mushrooms and diced onions. It saved fine for the next days lunch, but definitely tasted best right after cooking.

This was just kind of blah for me. I missed the wine flavoring from real risotto and it just wasnt a good substitute. The orange and thyme really dont ad much. I would go for the gusto and make risotto, come on you can do it!

I also halved the recipe and family enjoyed it, though next time will increase the orange and thyme just a little.

a delicious side dish, truly - be sure to get ur timing right tho - def best when served immediately - i cooked the orzo first very aldente and then waited till everything else was done before adding the stock etc - it gets to the table very creamy that way... very nice recipe

I halved the recipe, and it came out great. There was no need to "stir constantly" during the final simmer.

To the Cook from Atlanta...there's these little knobs on your stove and when you turn them it adjusts the flame. If you want to bring something to a simmer in a quicker time, turn up the fire LOL... This is a great side-dish and easy to prepare for guests because you can make it ahead of time without compromising the flavor.

I added mushrooms that I had sauteed with butter and garlic. I didn't add orange zest because I didn't have any oranges. This was a delicious side to a lemon and thyme roasted chicken. I will make this over and over again.

What did I do wrong? No way this can be made in 20 minutes. I found that after rinsing the orzo in cold water to stop the cooking and adding room temperature broth to it in a cold pot, it took 15 minutes to just get it to a simmer. After it came to a simmer it was fast but it through my dinner timing way off. Did everyone else heat the broth to boiling first?

Scored big comfort-food points here. Didn't have the orange zest or fresh thyme; used lemon zest and dried thyme instead. Folded in sauteed mushrooms, onion, garlic, and turkey Italian sausage at serving time.

So easy and so good! I have halved the recipe and still was able to serve 4. Also makes yummy leftovers! This dish goes great with the broiled salmon with citrus yogurt sauce!

This dish came out very well. I used basil instead of thyme to match with a pesto chicken dish. I will definitely prepare it again, especially when I am bored with potatoes.

Yes, prepare again but not using 2 pots! I cook the orzo in 1/2 stock & 1/2 water. Bring to a low boil then, ignore it for 10-12 mins., stir & add orange zest & thyme .. simmer 5 mins. Easy & good.

This was awesome, and soooo easy! I used dried thyme (next time I'll try fresh), and used half shredded Romano and half shredded Parmesan. I cut the recipe in half since I was only serving two. However, I kept the full 1 cup of cheese. My boyfriend thought the orange taste was a little strong, but I may have had more than I should have in there, I eyeballed the amount instead of measuring. But he still went back for seconds, and didn't save me any! This one is DEFINITELY a keeper!

Love it but I leave out the zest. Amazing with wild mushrooms.

I made a bunch of changes on this but still liked the outcome. I didn't use orange zest (didn't have any oranges). I used salted butter, Pecorino Romano cheese, and a dash of dry thyme. I also halved the recipe. Next time I'll either use orange zest or leave out the thyme. Overall it was good and my boyfriend ate three helpings.

Very tasty, and SO easy. Perfect as a simple side dish, or even good as a comfort-type main course. I used Pecorino Romano cheese.

I like this about as much as risotto, and it's *so* much easier to make. I omitted the orange zest but it tasted fine. Be careful not to overcook the orzo in the salted water or it won't absorb the chicken broth as readily in the simmering stage. Also, when they say "large pot", they mean it -- orzo gives off a lot of starch into the water, so make sure you have plenty of water.

This was certainly easy, but be careful not to put too much orange zest. I think it needed a bit more cheese.

I don't know how you can NOT like this recipe. It is simple, the flavors are subtle and it is a perfect accompaniment to a complex main entree. Make sure you use good cheese.
