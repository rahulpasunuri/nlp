I have been making this recipe for YEARS. I absolutely love the ooohs and aaaahs I get when I serve it. I use the egg/cream/sugar ratios in this as the basis for all of my creme brulees and have never been disappointed. I even have made this as frozen custard by cooling it in the fridge then pouring it into my ice cream maker.

Absolutely delicious! A keeper! I doubled this recipe, and it turned out perfectly. I used vanilla beans and vanilla extract. The flavor combination of vanilla, bourbon, brown sugar, and toasted pecans is flawless. One dinner guest licked clean three ramekins! I will definitely make this many times again for special occasions.

I've been making this for 5 years - most agree it's the best creme brulee recipe ever - even for non-bourbon lovers. I've never even bothered with the pecans. Also extremely simple.

This unique version of creme brulee is fabulous, especially for bourbon lovers! I decreased the sugar by ~1/4 and increased the bourbon...topped only with the brown sugar (out of nuts) and truly enjoyed that the flavor of the bourbon came through so nicely. Highly recommended, especially with less sugar so the creme brulee was not as cloyingly sweet as they sometimes are-

Made this for my dad at Christmas two years ago. He loves creme brulee. The pecans and bourbon were a perfect addition. We liked it so much. We make it each year at Christmas

Not bad -- just not spectacular. You have to really love the taste of bourbon. If I ever made it again, I would cut that back a bit.

This is the best creme brulee recipe I've ever tasted, at home or in a restaurant. And incredibly easy. Definitely a keeper.

Great flavor. I substituted skim milk plus 1/2 C skim milk pwd. for the cream and it set just fine. I would add 1/4 less sugar next time because it was a little too sweet.

This recipe seemed very simple,however, my creme brulees seemed either overdone or underdone? The consistency was not custard-like.(too soft) Any suggestions? Other than that, I had a little difficulty evenly distributing the brown sugar. The flavor is excellent. I don't think the problem is the recipe, so if anyone out there has a suggestion, please let me know. I would like to try it again.

Have enjoyed this recipe several times; both with bourbon and kahlua. Find regular granulated sugar preferable to the superfine or raw. Fantastic!

Wonderful! We are creme brulee lovers, having tried many different recipes. This one easily is our favorite. The brown sugar is difficult to carmelize evenly. We achieve most consistent results in the broiler.

Outstanding! Toasted the pecans in a pecan liquer. Added a few drops just before serving and capped it off with a whole pecan on top. Used rum because one of guests prefers it. Was acccused of making this just so I could use my new toy...the blow torch (not totally true). A truely great finish to a fine dinner. My guests loved it. I will make it again.

This was my first attempt to make creme brulee and it turned out quite good. However, we used a kitchen torch to carmelize the brown sugar, so the custard itself was still cool when we served it. When we had the leftovers the next day, we warmed the custard in the microwave and I thought the texture and flavor were much better warm. So next time, I will warm the custards before serving them. Definitely worth making again.

This recipe was a great hit with my New Years Eve guests. I didn't change a thing. I thought the taste of bourbon was a bit strong, but I'm not a drinker. Everyone else loved it! A perfect ending to a wonderful dinner!

First time I've made or had Creme Brulee. Made it for a special young lady who loves this dessert. She and my other dinner guests loved it and couldn't stop raving about it. Like another reviewer, I substituted Grand Marnier. I will try with praline liquored pecans as suggested by another reviewer. Gentlemen, this dessert will impress the ladies.

Used 1.5 Tbs. Kahlua instead of bourbon and it was great. I'll likely use less sugar next time as it was a bit too sweet, and will use a real vanilla bean instead of extract. This is a great BASIC, easy recipe that you could flavor w/ Grand Marnier or any favorite liquer.

A dessert stopper. All our guests loved it and we continue to pass along the secret!

I made this recipe for the first time on Saturday evening. My guest just loved it..I put the brown sugar through a sieve and let it sit overnight to help the sugar become a little drier. This aided in making the topping crunchier. I didn't have bourbon so I used Rye Whisky..

How'd I forget to rate this recipe. I made It a couple weeks ago and it was AWSOME!!!

Fabulous! rave reviews from my dinner party. Instead of plain roasted pecans, I roasted them in a "praline liqueur" and then let them cool. It made them extra-crispy; then spooned on a tablespoon of the praline liquor.

My family loved this recipe. I used rum instead of bourbon and once ready to serve I placed banana slices over the brulee before topping with the sugar. The creaminess of the brulee and the taste of rum with bananas was awesome. I omitted the pecans.

I found that it was way too sweet. If I make it again I will cut the sugar in half! Too much bourbon, and I like bourbon. Recipe is a good foundation that needs some fine tuning for sure.

We have made this recipe a number of times, and for some pretty picky friends. Each time, it has gotten rave reviews. Even creme brulee purists will love it.

Very impressive to our guests. Loved it. Will do this again. Excellent for a beginner cook. People will think you are really a great cook.

This was the first creme brulee I ever made. I consider myself to be a fairly experienced cook but I thought the custard was a little "loose" compared to desserts I've had in restaurants. Other than that, this recipe is a definite keeper. My 11 year old didn't like the bourbon taste so I'll probably make a "booze-free" recipe next time!

This is simply DIVINE. I used small butane, pistol- type torch sold at WMS & Sonoma specially designed for creme brulee. It worked like a charm. Fabulous dessert!!!!!

This was wonderful! My boyfriend, a self-proclaimed connoisseur of creme brulee, was very impressed! No one could taste the bourbon even though I followed the directions exactly. That wasn't a bad thing, necessarily as I think there was a hint of spicy flavor from the booze. I had a heck of time with the torch so used the broiler which worked pretty well. The hot custard dishes are very difficult to handle; be sure to leave plenty of time to cool before even trying to remove them from the pan of water after baking.

The creme brulee was absolutely delicious. The bourbon custard mixture was very creamy and the brown sugar pecan topping made a nice contrast. We had difficult using a torch to melt the topping. We instead placed it under the broiler in a pan of ice and this worked very well.

This was one of the best, easiest, and most impressive desserts I've ever made. Make it identical to the recipe. It turned out perfect. I served it after a spicy seafood main course and my guests all commented what a perfect change of pace it was and how it really hit the spot. I used a propane torch to caramelize the brown sugar and it worked perfect. I will make this many times again. I decorated it with one whole toasted pecan in the center around all the chopped ones.
