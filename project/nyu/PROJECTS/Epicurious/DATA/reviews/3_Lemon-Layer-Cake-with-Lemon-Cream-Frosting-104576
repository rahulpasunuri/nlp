I agree with several of the other reviews here that the cake needed more of a lemon taste, but it did turn out light and fluffy for me. My lemon curd, on the other hand, was almost too tart. I think with a couple of tweaks I could definitely see myself make this one again.

The recipe is easy to follow, but the output was a disappointment. The cake itself has no flavor (you would never call it a lemon cake if you tasted just the cake part), which shouldn't come as a surprise given the small amount of lemon flavoring. There probably should be lemon zest added. The texture was somewhat powdery, which is fine if that's the grain you like. The "frosting" was more like a soupy mess. I used less than half of the whipped cream because I saw it was too runny as it was. Because it was thin and soupy, the cake wasn't properly covered; worse yet, I brought this cake to a house around the corner from me, and on the way, the top layer completely slid off the bottom layer because the runny filling didn't bind the layers together at all.

The cake was very dry and unappealing. The only thing I changed was skim milk for whole milk. The frosting, however, was fabulous. I used part of the lemon curd for filling between layers and added the rest to the whipped cream mixture for frosting. I'll admit I'm a frosting fan and this time I will scrape the rest off and throw away the cake!

I made the frosting from this recipe and used it on the Lemon Layer Cake from this web site. The frosting was very difficult to spread (it is more of a whipped cream consistency). If I used it again, I would just put it in the middle layer of the cake and on top and not try to ice the sides. You also have to really love lemon to have the combination of the lemon cake, lemon curd, and lemon frosting. The second time I made the cake, I used a raspberry frosting and liked the combination much better.

As others suggested, I substituted Martha Stewart's 1-2-3-4 cake and used this frosting. I, though, would not call it a frosting - more of a glaze. It was very thin and runny and would not stay on the sides of the cake. It tasted good, but you could get more than an 1/8 of an inch of it on any one spot.

I had the most fabulous time making this cake, it is easy to prepare and the taste was absolutely phenomenal. It was just the right amount of sweetness I added a tad bit more lemon juice than called for and it was perfect. Made it for a birthday and everyone loved it!

Fabulous! I made this for my aunt's birthday party with a large group of family members who all raved and devoured the cake. We only left one slice for the birthday girl to enjoy again latter. I used a third of the meyer lemon curd recipe-which was delicious-as a filling between the cakes and then mixed in the rest with the whipped cream frosting. It added just the right amount of lemon flavor to the whole cake.

Don't know about the cake, because I use the "Lemon Layer Cake" recipe on this site, but the frosting. . . . OMG! It was delicious, my friend and I could not stop eating it over with strawberries. Changes: used the lemon curd from the "Lemon Layer Cake" (about 1 cup) with 1 cup of whipped cream and 1/2 cup conf. sugar. There was too much frosting left over, but as I said, you can eat it by the spoonful with strawberries. The search for the perfect lemon frosting is over. People raved about the cake. (I put dulce de leche between the layers of cake).

I have found a no-strain lemon curd recipe. Here it is: 6 tbsp. unsalted butter, soft/rm temp. 1 cup sugar 2 large eggs 2 large egg yolks - total 4 eggs but 2 without the whites. 2/3 cup lemon juice, fresh or bottled 1 tsp. grated lemon zest In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer, about 2 min. Slowly add the eggs and yolks. Beat for 1 min. Mix in the lemon juice. The mixture will look curdled, but it will smooth out as it cooks. In a medium, heavy-based saucepan, cook the mixture over low heat until it looks smooth. (the curdled appearance disappears as the butter in the mixture melts.) Increase the heat to medium and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens, about 15 min. It should leave a path on the back of a spoon and will read 170F on a thermometer. Don't let the mixture boil. Remove the curd from the heat, stir in the lemon zest. Transfer the curd to a bowl. Press plastic wrap on the surface of the lemon curd to keep a skin from forming and chill the curd in the refrigerator. The curd will thicken further as it cools. Covered tightly, it will keep in the fridge for a week and in the freezer for 2 months. Variations for lime curd: substitute lime juice and zest for lemon. I just made it and it turned out perfectly delicious and I didn't have to strain it!!! Enjoy!

The end result was wonderful, but I needed to make adaptions to counter the slipping frosting! I put about 1/3 of the curd between the layers, and used the rest of the curd with the whipping cream. In order to have enough whipping cream frosting, I increased the whipping cream by 1/4 cup. When I frosted it, I anchored the two layers together with two straws which I clipped down (I took them off before bringing the cake to the table). After I frosted it, I put it in the freezer for about 20 minutes, and kept it refrigerated until it was brought to the table. This is a surprisingly light cake, and not too sweet (I used scant measurements of sugar). I couldn't find the type of violets that the picture shows, so I bought some purple sugar violets, and they were lovely. It's not a tall cake -- each layer was about 3/4" tall, and with the frosting it comes to about 2". There were 2 small slices left after dinner (6 people) and all loved it. I'll make it again. Luckily I had read the comments before I made the cake, and a close friend had made the cake a couple of weeks before -- so I had the benefit of the comments. It's really yummy and surprisingly light. Best wishes for your cake!

Cake was a little dry. Texture was nice and dense. I wonder if a simple syrup would have helped. The frosting was delicious but I actually didn't add any of the sugar since the curd was sweet enough. All the grown-ups liked it but the kids did not.

The first time I made the cake I over mixed it. I made it again and followed the directions carefully. I liked the over mixed version better. The crumb quality was dense and flavorful. For both cakes I put lemon curd between the layers. I cut back on the sugar in both the cake and the frosting. After cutting the cake just before serving I warmed the rest of the lemon curd, added a little cream and drizzled it over the cake. It looked pretty and was very lemony.

Delicious, gorgeous, light and satisfying! The only complaint I have is with the directions and how it fails to mention that you need to make the Epicurious lemon curd recipe (and you should make it first) OR the recipe ought to tell you the amount of store bought curd you need.

Wow, this is an excellent cake. I usually never bother to make any recipe that doesn't have four forks, but my husband requested a lemon cake for his birthday and this recipe looked good, so I gave it a go, and I'm so glad I did. As one of our guests said: "Lovely." I do think you have to respect the recipe on this one: use sifted cake flour, whip the butter well, but don't overmix the ingredients, etc. Also, the cakes seemed to cook pretty quickly so watch them. This will definitely become a regular in my repetory.

Rating: 4
This is a fabulous cake. It is moist and dense. You have to make sure you fluff the butter, and don't over mix after the flour is in. I use about half of the sugar in the frosting which makes it slightly tart and wonderfully lemony. I watch it carefully and don't overbake. Its not an easy recipe, but when you get it right, it can't be beat.

I have been hanging onto this recipe since 2003 and finally baked it yesterday! It turned out a little dry. At 20 minutes, I tested the cake and it was still very runny inside. I baked it 4-5 minutes longer and I think that may have been too long. Nice lemony taste but I'll try a different recipe next time.

I really thought this was just OK; it didn't blow me away. I wasn't overwhelmed by lemon as others have said; instead, I just thought the flavor was average. The texture of the cake was a bit heavy. And, the frosting was just OK. The lemon curd was great though; I plan to save that recipe.

I love this cake except that I think there's way too much lemon cream frosting. When I make it, I half the cream recipe and only spread cream between the layers and on top. I think by covering all the sides with cream, it's far too sickly sweet. The first time I made it, however, I wound up with lots of leftover cream. Not knowing what to do with it, I stuck it in the freezer ... to my surprise, I ended up with a delicious frozen lemony mousse-like dessert!

I agree with some of the other comments; the layers were too dry and I had small problems with frosting slippage. Had I lowered my oven temp at least ten degrees I would have been o.k. The amazing frosting taste was almost overshadowed by its slippery consistency. I ended up chilling it overnight then adding a thin crumb layer to the cake in the morning. I didn't frost until 2 hours before serving and even then adorned the cake with pale pink,yellow and orange roses to avoid frosting slippage. The taste was o.k.. The cake ended up being a mere vehicle for the yummy frosting.

I wanted to give this cake 2 forks. That would be 0 for the cake and 4 for the frosting. I decided the frosting wouldn't get the attention it deserves is I did that. The cake was OK, but not great. Dry as others suggested. The frosting blew me away. The sharp intensity of lemon contrasted by the lightness and freshness of the whipped cream lends itself to many uses: Frosting, or a dab on a bowl of fresh fruit.

Made this with the Lemon Curd recipe (see link in cake recipe.) I added 2 T grated lemon zest to the cake batter for more lemon flavor, and took it out of the oven when the tester still had a few moist crumbs. Excellent!

I am not rating this recipe because--I didn't make it. I only used it as a guide to create another fabulous lemon curd layer cake. I took a one of the suggestions below and used Martha Stewarts 1-2-3-4 Lemon cake. DIVINE. In the same review, references to the Cake Bible (Rose Levy Beranbaum)were made and since I have ALWAYS had great luck on every cake from that book--I used the lemon curd recipe (only uses yolks) and the Neoclassic Butter Cream (corn syrup and sugar instead of water and sugar) lemon variation. I made two cakes, sliced them to make four layers, put the curd between each, frosted with the buttercream and presented to my 90 year old grandmother on her birthday. ABSOLUTE HIT!!

With a few modifications this is a fabulous cake. After reading the other reviews, I too made the Lemon Curd Layer Cake with the frosting from this cake. I doubled curd recipe. When making the frosting I used 1/3 of the curd that I had (1/3 of the recipe doubled). I also used heavy cream (not whipping cream). I did both to ensure a stiff frosting. The frosting turned out great. I used straight curd between the layers instead of frosting. It was lemony and wonderful. I suggest refrigerating for a couple of hours to let everything set. Next time, if I thought about it, I would make the curd a day ahead of time to let it set thoroughly and decrease the work on the day making the cake. Though it took a bit of time I would definitely make this cake again.

Given the mixed reviews of the cake, I used Martha Stewart's 1-2-3-4 lemon cake instead and the icing from this recipe to make my first ever wedding cake for a friend with rave reviews. I highly recommend the 1-2-3-4 cake, it's easy to make, moist, delicious, and very consistent. I was a bit nervous about the icing from this recipe, but my friend loved it so I did a lot of experimenting with the icing and reading up about whipped cream to avoid disaster. Here are my suggestions: 1) the Martha Stewart curd recipe might be a bit stiffer since it only uses egg yolks, but I'm not sure, 2) the best cream for whipping is heavy cream (not whipping cream, oddly enough. whipping cream means it has just enough fat to be whipped, heavy cream gives you that extra fat and stiffness), and 3)pasteurized cream is much better than ultra-pasteurized (look for "natural" brands or local dairies). I was looking for extra security and stiffness for the wedding cake, especially since it was going to be outdoors in the summer. Following the directions in "The Cake Bible", I took these extra steps: 4) adding some gelatine (actually agar, a vegetarian gelatine substance) as well as 5) Cobasan, a stabilizer imported from Germany and carried by www.qzina.com. It may seem like a lot of work, but the icing really is nice and with these additions the icing was much stiffer and could hold up for many hours at room temperature. Final note: raspberries go really well with this cake.

I didn't have a chance to read reviews before making this recipe, but i was certainly disappointed. I added baking powder to the batter, so it wasn't too dense, but it really wasn't all that moist. And the "frosting" recipe, albeit delicious in and of its own flavor, is really not suitable for spreading- an egg based curd is guaranteed to drip! Not altogether untasty, but not very aesthtically pleasing.

I made the cake from this recipe, filled it with lemon curd and topped with the lemon cream cheese frosting from another recipe and it was fabulous. The cake was very good, but it was a bit dense. Probably do to a lack of rising agent as was mentioned earlier. IF you like a dense cake, make it the way it reads. If not think about following the other reviewers lead and adding a rising agent.

I made the cake and it was wonderful, but with an important alteration: I added 2 1/4 tsp. baking powder--it seemed very odd that the recipe omitted it. I baked it in 9" pans, and I had more than enough frosting to cover the cake. My problem was that the frosting was nearly impossible to work with--it kept slipping & dripping down the sides of the cake. I had lots of leftover frosting, so I froze it and ate it as ice cream--delicious! I'd make the cake again, but maybe just put lemon curd in the middle & frost with a simple lemon buttercream.

After reading suggestions from other cooks, I also decided to use the frosting from this recipe but use the cake from the Lemon Curd Layer Cake. It was a wonderful combination! I made it for my mother's 50 birthday party, and everyone thought it was fantastic. They are even still talk about it!

Rating: 3
Not a bad recipe. Easy to make and nice and lemony. I was a little disappointed with the frosting. In the middle as the cream in between layers it was quickly absorbed by the cake and therefore there was not much frosting left. It is a tasty frosting but unlike cream cheese frosting does not "stay put" - it sort of fell over the sides. In any case I served the cake with strawberries and blueberries which made from pretty colors and a nice overall taste. I was planning on putting candles on the cake but the frosting would not have held them up.

The cake texture and taste were terrific and the curd was just right. I also found the icing a little too thin and airy. It did not roll off the cake, but the texture, even after refrigeration, was just a little too insubstantial. Has anyone found a simple solution? Perhaps using half the curd between the layers, without incorporating it, would keep the instense lemon and then using the other half to incorporte, plus more sugar, would do it.

The lemon cake/frosting was a big hit. Everyone wanted another piece because it was lemony. I was, though, very disappointed with the lemon frosting because it was extremely thin and slowly oozed down the side of the cake. I had to add lots of confectioners' sugar to the frosting and refrigerated the frosting. After doing all of that, I still felt it was too thin. Because I received many compliments on the lemon taste of the cake, I would try to make it again. Since I followed the recipe from the Gourmet magazine, I didn't read the reviews until now. Seems the frosting will again be too thin a second time around. Any comments Gourmet?

The cake came out very well, but the lemmon curd frosting was a bit dissapointing. It was very loose and i had to thicken it up to get it to stay on the cake.

Because of the previous reviews, I made the icing and hunted for another lemon cake recipe. So, I made the cake from the "Lemon Curd Layer Cake" recipe listed on epicurious.

I'll try anything once, especially if it's lemon, but this won't get a repeat. Despite carefully taking all comments into consideration (cake flour, less baking time...) the cake was still dry, and without much lemon flavor. My husband couldn't find the lemon curd I'd made, and used the jar of purchased curd we had instead (high quality stuff), and I really didn't think the frosting was that great either. Do try the lemon curd linked to this recipe, however. It is wonderful, and very easy.

When I was a child in the 40's in a small Mississippi town, there was a woman who made fabulous cakes, and my mother would buy one for special occasions. My favorite was a white cake with lemon filling and a White Icing (meringue type). Therefore I couldn't wait to make this cake and though it wasn't like the one I used to like, we thought it was very good, especially since it was made with lemons from my brother's tree. Yes, it was a little dry (next time I'll bake it for 16 Minutes) but we adored the Lemon Curd Icing.

I wonder if the person who thought the cake was dry used regular flour rather than cake flour. You cannot substitute one for the other in the same amount.To give the cake a little more lemon flavor, I added about a tsp. of lemon extract. I used Meyer lemons for the lemon curd and ran the finished curd through a sieve before cooling to remove the grated lemon peel. I refrigerated the frosted cake overnight, and it was fine.

If you love lemon you'll love this recipe. The lemon curd makes the frosting. My frosting was just too runny -- any tips. Thanks to the person who suggested only baking the cake for 16 minutes. It was a little to dry after 20 minutes. Everyone thought it was delicious - runny frosting and all.

I made this cake to take to a party, and everyone raved! I made 2 batches of lemon curd, though, and spread half of one on the bottom layer of the cake before the frosting, then put on the top layer and frosted it. It added just that much more tang. This recipe is time consuming, but worth it.

Wasn't as lemony as I expected. I'd make it again but use more lemon juice next time. Also, I used regular, unsifted flour, which was fine, but sifted cake flour would give a nicer texture.

My significant other loves lemon as no other flavor on earth and this cake defines lemon.
