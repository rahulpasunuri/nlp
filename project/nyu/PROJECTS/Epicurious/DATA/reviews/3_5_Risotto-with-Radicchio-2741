A keeper. Use red wine instead of white and be sure to serve with fresh chopped radicchio and shaved parmesan on top. beautiful presentation and nice crunch with teh creamy risotto. no need to add cream.

It seems to me that the cream is unnecessary - that the "cream" should come from the starch of the rice

Probably the best dish I've ever made, EVER. I adopted the suggestions about using red wine instead of white, and omitting the half-and-half, and the result was outstanding. Helps if you've made risotto before and know the drill about continually adding hot stock, and checking frequently to assess the tenderness of the rice. Frugality tip -- no need to open a fresh bottle of wine, just keep a bottle on hand to stash the dregs from bottles you can't finish -- this is how they do it in Sicily, and it works just fine. It also never hurts to add more wine than called for in the recipe.

Loved it with some modifications: red wine instead of white, teleme cheese (a soft, mild goat's milk melting cheese--got it at the farmer's market today!) instead of half & half, more thyme, and finished with a splash of balsamic vinegar. Once wilted, the bitterness of the radicchio is softened; it's lovely.

This was excellent. I used vegetable broth and the half and half and a bit of butter to finish and served small portions with roasted asparagus lightly dressed in a pistachio oil/sherry vinaigrette. It was a great Valentine's Dinner. I also borrowed from the other Radicchio Risotto recipe on this site and used red wine instead of white. The flavor seemed a little deeper (my imagination?) but the color was definitely pinkish.

Easy to make and delicious. Even my pickiest child enjoyed it. I had to add a bit more liquid than was called for (1/2 cup or so) to make the rice tender.

This risotto was so delicious! One change I would make is to leave out the half and half. Risotto just doesn't need it, the rice provides all the creaminess you need. The half and half made it almost too rich for my taste.

have tried this a number of times and always good, impressive since radiccio is not a favorite of mine but in this recipe it becomes mellow (as long as the pieces are cut small) and adds a special taste and eye appeal

It will surprise you when you add the radicchio that it steams in the rice and takes on the look of wild mushrooms. The bitter taste known to radicchio, becomes a mellow and tender addition. I would not put too much fresh radicchio on for a garnish as this is definitely not a salad. You must try it to believe it.
