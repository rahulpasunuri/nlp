These are killer baked stuffed mushrooms! I used 6 oz. fresh baby spinach that I chopped in the food processor together with the mushroom stems. Added these and some garlic to the sauteed onions and sauteed for another couple of minutes. I like a little bite to mushrooms, so I reduced the cooking time to 15 minutes on the first round and ten minutes on the second round then cooked for 10 minutes after stuffing. Amazing!

I made a vegetarian version of this for my book club. I cut the bacon, but didn't want to loose the savory flavor, so I added fresh thyme, sage and garlic to the sauteed onion. Also used fresh steamed baby spinach. I wish I would have chopped it first, since it was stringy and harder to stuff the mushrooms. Anyway, everyone loved them! Made the extra filling into a dip - yummy. The mushrooms definitely shrink, so get ones that look far bigger than bite-sized!

I was running short on time, so I didn't roast the mushrooms on both sides, but they were still delicious.

Great make-ahead with so many possibilities! Don't like cream cheese, so I've used left-over mash potatoes or a beaten egg as binder. I dice/saute the mushroom stems, use blue cheese, spinach, bacon or Canadian bacon and just a few panko crumbs mixed in with the egg. Next day bit of remaining stuffing went perfectly in a frittata. Delicious w the blue cheese without being too strong.

I don't understand all the rave reviews. I made these for New Year's Eve. I followed the recipe exactly except I tossed the mushrooms in olive oil instead of bacon grease (ugh) before the preliminary roasting. I also added grated parmesan, bread crumbs and drizzled olive oil on top before baking as other reviewers suggested, which helped a lot. The mushrooms were good, but father bland and the filling was too dense. Decent, but after all the work (hollowing out 48 mushrooms is no picnic), I was disappointed. I think they would be better with some hot red pepper flakes and maybe some stronger cheese mixed in the filling...the feta just got lost. One major thing: the mushrooms of the size mentioned in the recipe shrink down to WAY too small. You need mushrooms at least three to four inches in diameter for this.

OMG! as the kids say. This is the best Stuffed Mushrooms I've ever had. I, too had leftover stuffing/filling...think I'll use it in a frittata tomorrow morning.

Yum!! I made these for appetizers and they were a big hit. I made them three different ways. On all versions I used 1/3 cup feta, 1/3 cup fresh mozarella, and 1/8 cup parmeasean reggiano, instead of 3/4 cup feta. I then spilt the mixture into three containers and put fresh crab meat in one, browned mild italian sausage in the other and left the last as is. I mixed italian seasoned PANKO bread crumbs and parmesean reggiano equally and sprinkled on top. I cooked as directed otherwise. They were all very good, but the ones to which I had added the mild italian sausage were outstanding! This was a surprise. I only did that because several of my guests did not like seafood. I thought the crab filling would be my favorite. Also, I did not have as many mushrooms as I needed so I put the rest of the filling in a shallow ramekin and baked it along with the mushrooms and served this as hot dip with small toasts. This is a keeper.

I have never eaten a stuffed mushroom that I thought was worth the calories. But I saw this recipe and wanted to serve them to a mushroom fanatic friend. Well, wow! It may make a few folks nuts that some of us do things our own way, but I certainly liked the outcome. I frequently substitute pancetta for bacon in recipes and I think that certainly adds great complexity of flavor. Also, I usually throw a bag of salad mix in with fresh spinach when making sauteed greens for dinner. So I lightly sauteed a bag of Trader Joe's herb salad mix instead of using frozen spinach and used pancetta. The panko and parmesan topping discussed by others was a terrific addition. I used a very large shallot rather than onion. I thought that pre-cooking the mushrooms was very helpful and got rid of that watery taste and spongy texture that frequently accompany mushrooms. I also agree with the suggestion of using leftover stuffing with eggs the next day.

I made this for my roomies while running out the door one afternoon along with a pupkin/squash risotto and since i had no time or bacon, i didn't prebake the mushrooms and left out the bacon/grease etc, just used olive oil. I expected them to love the risotto and give an ok rating for this muchrooms. It was a tie! My bf and I loved the risotto, missed the bacon in the mushrooms, my two roommies said the opposite, which eads me to elieve they are both phenomenal recipes. I;m planning on making the mushrooms for a big B-day party, till skipping the pre-bake but def adding the bacon. I might leave some mushrooms ithout for my veggie friends.

This is a really simple, easy to make appetizer that gets rave reviews at parties. I have made them a couple times and they are always scarfed up. I do make them ahead of time and just throw them in the oven before I serve them to warm them through. Topped with a bit of parmesan, and you have a nice brown crust.

Absolutely excellent stuffed mushroom recipe, best I've ever made. I used blue cheese instead of the feta (I love the combo of blue cheese and bacon), and I also used the (chopped and sauteed) mushroom stems in the filling. I also topped them with a little breadcrumbs and parmesean, and popped them under the broiler for a minute at the end to crisp the top a little. This got raves, and I'll definitely make this over and over. As others recommended, the leftover filling was delicious scrambled in with eggs the next day.

I have used this recipe for the past three or four years, now. Everyone always loves these mushrooms! I always have requests for them during the holidays, and other gatherings. Preparing them is cumbersome; every time I make them, I swear I will never make them again! But, here I am, the day before Thanksgiving, and guess what I am about to prepare? The outcome makes it worth it, every time! Just a word of advice: prepare the mushrooms the night before, then heat them in the oven about 20 min before you plan on serving them. Do not prepare them more than a day in advance, though!

I've made a lot of stuffed mushroom recipes, but this is my new favorite. I didn't follow the steps of pre-roasting the mushrooms, but instead just stuffed them and baked everything for 30 minutes. I also added garlic to the stuffing. They turned out delicious, and were the first thing to go out of a large spread of appetizers. My new go-to mushroom recipe.

I was enticed by the ingredients in this recipe, but had to accommodate my vegetarian boyfriend. No problem. This fabulous recipe is made even better by substituting sun dried tomatoes for the bacon. I, too, used olive oil to roast the mushrooms, and it worked out beautifully. But here's the best tip I have. When chopping the fresh spinach, I also added chopped fresh basil and parsley to the mixture. It elevates the stuffing to a new level immediately, and adds a little colour too. This is my most popular appetizer, bar none, and a real treat for all concerned.

Rating: 3
I've tried several stuffed mushroom recipes but this is definately my favorite because it is so creamy and flavorful. I only cooked the mushrooms for about 20 minutes (the full amount of time would have mummified them!) and tossed them in olive oil instead of bacon grease. There's a considerable amount of leftover stuffing so you may want to make less or have more mushrooms handy.

I made these mushrooms for a wine tasting party, and they disappeared fast. I used olive oil instead of the bacon grease, and added the stems, and some freshly grated nutmeg. I then topped them with toasted pine nuts. Very tasty.

I made this for dinner group and everyone loved it! I added 2 cloves of chopped garlic, some of the mushroom stems, 1 tablespoon of the bacon grease and 1 tablespoon of butter to the onion in the pan and sauted them until soft. I also used fresh chopped spinach. Once the mushroom caps were stuffed I topped them with parmesan cheese and then sprinkled them with chopped parsely to add some color once they were out of the oven. They were very easy to make.

I used all fresh ingredients to make this. They turned out very flavorful and light, not heavy, like many other stuffed mushrooms I've tried. The flavors blended well together and none overpowered.

I actually agree with the reviewer who said there are better things one could make for an appetizer. These were good, but "good" isn't good enough for me to want to make them again. Not that interesting. HOWEVER - I absolutley would make this filling again and use it in an omelette. It was much better that way!

Rating: 4
Scrummy! These were delectable little shrooms of decadence. I used fresh, chopped spinach instead of the stringy frozen variety; much easier to prep, actually. Precooked bacon from the store made things much simpler and I prefer using a bit of olive oil in place of the bacon fat - really with cream cheese, feta, and bacon, do you need more fat? Lovely presentation: I put a small sliver of Asiago chese on top and a caper just for cuteness. I'm ready to make them again given the occasion!

Rating: 3
I really enjoyed the filling and think it would be great stuffed in chicken. I The mushrooms were a little chewy, so I don't know that I would pre-cook the mushrooms next time (I believe I've made other stuffed mushroom recipes before that don't require pre-cooking the mushrooms, right?) I didn't toss in the bacon fat, guess I didn't read that part, so maybe that would have made a difference, I don't know, but overall, these were good.

Rating: 3
Flavorful, everyone enjoyed it! Made the mushrooms and filling earlier in the day then heated them up shortly before serving. The top looked a bit dry, but inside was okay; not too moist because I squeezed so much liquid from the spinach. Didn't toss mushrooms in bacon fat, seemed gross. Would love the opportunity to make these again!

Wonderful. I love that you can make this recipe in advance. I roasted the caps for only 15-20 minutes in olive oil not in bacon as suggested. I also used fresh baby spinach.

This is a delicious recipe. I added the chopped mushroom stems to the onion and cooked them until the liquid evaporated. Only roasted the mushrooms for about 15 minutes and the texture was fine. I grated some Parmesan over the stuffed mushrooms as previously suggested and it did add an extra crunch. I added a little more cream cheese for a creamier textrue. The extra stuffing made a great filling for a boneless pork loin roast (butterflied and rolled with filling).

I have made this a number of times to rave reviews. It's a great recipe. The first time I roasted the mushrooms in bacon fat, but never again. It doesn't add anything to the dish (except fat of course). Roast the mushrooms for 25 minutes on a non-stick pan and they'll be perfect.

Excellent appetizer, I printed out copies for some of my guests to take home. I made the mushrooms the day before, and think that maybe if I had made the recipe 100% the same day, perhaps the mushrooms wouldn't have been so firm. I think the amount of cheese is appropriate, and actually double the feta because we have a taste for it. NOTE: these are very rich, don't make so much that your guests get full before enjoying your main course.

As a caterer, I have made this recipe over and over to always rave reviews. It is one of our signature hor's d'oeuvres.

This was a big hit as an appetizer for a birthday lunch of crab cakes, caesar salad, pasta with pesto and veggies and raspberry tiramisu. I roasted and stuffed the mushrooms the day before and baked them off right before serving. I'm glad I did this because they are a decent amount of work - not difficult, just a little time consuming. I used medium sized mushrooms (which shrank a good deal as others have said). The one thing I would do differently: I tossed them in the bacon grease as the recipe calls for, but only a couple tablespoons rather than 1/4 cup. This left them "streaky". Next time I'd either use more oil or none at all to avoid the streaks. I'll definitely make these again to take to an event or to serve on a special occasion.

I bought some larger mushrooms (mini portobellos)since I was using this as a side dish, but they shrank so much that they wound up being bite-sized anyway. Next time I'll try some regular-sized portobellos if I can find someone else to share them with me...
