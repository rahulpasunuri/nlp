We went broccoli picking today and made this recipe when we got home. Very good recipe and lovely way to highlight fresh broccoli. I served it with brown rice. Nice side dish or you could easily add a protein for an entree.

I love this recipe. For a healthier version, I substitute Canola oil, laced with a little Asian sesame oil (I have found that substituting the vegetable oil with sesame oil, alone, is a little too overpowering).

Very easy way to prepare broccoli. I did as suggested and put the ginger in prior to the garlic, though I guess I chopped mine thin enough to cook through easily, since the garlic, which was paper thin, cooked at about the same speed--still, even "overcooked" ginger is better than undercooked by far in this case (the size of mine worked well, too, at around half an inch long by a couple millimeters wide and deep). I used honey wine vinegar, which worked very well, and drizzled sourwood honey over the broccoli just before tossing in the soy and vinegar. After tasting it, I decided to put a little lime and orange juice in it, which made it significantly better. Go easy on the soy or it can overpower, which it threatened to do with mine (easy enough to repair slight issues by just adding some water as the broccoli cooks then draining it before putting the garlic and ginger on). You can play with this in a lot of combinations depending on your main course. For an Asian style meal, it's great as is.

This was delicious. I made it almost exactly as written with the exception of adding the garlic in the last minute of cooking to avoid burning. I also sliced the broccoli stems slightly thinner on the diagonal. They reminded us of bamboo shoots, adding an interesting texture to the dish.

This is a tasty, easy way to serve broccoli. I used a bit of sesame oil, at the suggestion of another reviewer.

This is delicious, a bit of sesame oil is a nice addition.

I found this to be an easy-to-prepare, delicious dish. My husband seconded my motion and asked for it again. I don't have rice vinegar, so I tried splashing in about a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar. I think it was a tasty addition. Of course, I don't know what the rice vinegar would have done. I also served it with brown rice, which was the perfect foil. Definitely a repeater.

I've made this twice and it's great! Note to the previous cook: don't pre-cook the broccoli. If you follow the directions, your broccoli will come out bright green, tender but crispy. Perfect! Serve with brown rice.

Per a revious reviewer I precooked the broccoli slightly (family is not a big al dente group). Ended up overcooked after tossing with the sauce and the soy base in the sauce made everything brown and unappetizing to look at. Had to quick whip up an additional veg for party. Taste was ok but nothing I would trouble with again.

I think that I might have used too little broccoli - I don't have a kitchen scale in this kitchen, but I'd say a 'large bunch' of broccoli would be more appropriate. Also, I think I'll start cooking the ginger before the garlic the next time I make this, as the garlic gets brown much quicker. With so much ginger in the recipe, you can't really afford having it undercooked. I'll definitely make this recipe again, but it needs some tweaking to make it really great.

can't wait to fix some more quite a nice addition to the meal

A great recipe! The tastes of the various ingredients are wonderful! Even my husband who disdains broccoli liked it!

I have used both sesame oil and roasted peanut oil instead of plain. I think it adds something. I precook the broccoli a bit by steaming for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. I cut both the ginger and the garlic into matchsticks and (thanks, Greg) start the ginger cooking before the garlic. After heating the liquid ingredients in the pan, I add the broccoli and finish it. Every my husband likes it.

This was pretty tasty, although I thought the soy sauce overpowered the rest of the flavors and made the dish too salty. I used about 1 tbs. of ginger, and that was just right. I will make this again because it is a great way to make broccoli more edible, altough I will play with the proportions (and I will add the vinegar again as I did last night). Happy eats!

An excellent, delicate dish. Prepared precisely as specified.

Very tasty, but don't overdo the soy sauce or it will taste like bad Chinese food. Also, slice the ginger "matchsticks" as thinly as possible or else it's a little overpowering. Lastly, I left it in the pan in the final step for too long, hoping it would soak up more of the flavor, and it got soggy. Otherwise, very nice.

My guests loved this dish! Since I had a different idea of what this would taste like, I was a little disappointed. The smells in the kitchen were fabulous. I served this as a side dish and it was plenty for five. Next time I'd like to incorporate the slices of the stalks too. Watch the garlic and ginger sticks carefully as they tend to burn quickly.

yum! easy and tasty. even my husband who doesn't particularly like broccoli enjoyed it.

A different and tasty way to prepare broccoli. I will make this again. It is also very healthy.

Full of flavor! The seasoned rice vinegar is an absolute must. I didn't have ginger, so I used lemon pepper instead. That added a little extra kick. A perfect side dish.

I've made this recipe serval times. It's very easy and taste great. It adds a little flair to what is otherwise boring broccoli.

It's usually pretty hard to get excited about broccoli, but this recipe is excellent. What an easy way to get the RDA of vegetables. I diced both the ginger and the garlic, and the seasoned rice vinegar should not be optional. Definitely use it. I served this with Curried Red Lentils and basmati rice. We had no leftovers.

This was easy, and absolutely delicious. I didn't find the ginger or garlic overpowering, though the dish did have plenty of flavor. I will make this often and recommend it to many of my friends!

Quick and easy recipe for broccoli. Delicious asian influence, the flavoring is fantastic. The best part is the sliced broccoli stalks, so don't leave that out!

I love the crunchy ginger strips in this recipe. It was easy, inexpensive and I received many compliments. I also omitted the vinegar. Goes well with most any Asian fare.

This was pretty tasty but next time I'll be a little more careful about the ginger; it was very strong and threatened to overpower the dish. I did the matchsticks in my food processor but evidently that was not thin enough. Also, although it was not bad, next time I would try it without the vinegar.

This is an excellent recipe if you want something a little different. This has become a favorite dish that I will do often
