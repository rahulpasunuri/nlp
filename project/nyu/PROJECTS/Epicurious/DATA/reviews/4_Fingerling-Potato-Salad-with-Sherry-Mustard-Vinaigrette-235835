I made this last night for 100 people and I think almost all of them raved about it! I did not change the recipe at all except to drastically increase the quantity. I wanted a potato salad recipe that didn't have mayonnaise so that it could safely sit outside for a while. I will definitey be making this again!

Great potato salad! Love the tarragon- I doubled it. I also substituted EVOO for canola and skipped the bacon because I did not have any. I included the egg but not sure I would bother next time. Maybe add some chopped red bell pepper or steamed green beans.

This was a fantastic potato salad. I could not get fingerling potatoes or sherry vinegar so I used small red potatoes and red wine vinegar with a splash of sherry instead. Otherwise made it exactly as written. It was delicious - full of flavor. This will be a great addition to many summer menus. Also will be great for a picnic or party when it has to sit out since there is no mayo in it. The whole family loved it.

Great recipe! I just roasted the potatoes over a bed of salt, and forgot to cover them with foil. I did not peel them, but cut them into bite sized pieces and they were still wonderful. I also did not use fresh herbs since I did not have any on hand. The bacon and the eggs give this a wonderful flavor. I am not a fan of mayo potato salad, but this was amazing. My boyfriend and I were both very impressed.

Very yummy, although the fingerlings do not need 1 hour in the oven! I put them in for 30 minutes and also I didn't peel them. The guys loved it the most out of a plate of steak, fried okra, and corn!

Fantastic break from mayo potato salad. I like things saucey and up the dressing to suit. Baking definitely give the potatoes a slightly different taste and a fatastic consistency.

Have made a warm side dish out of this and get rave reviews from family & friends.

This was a good salad. A nice change from traditional potato salad. I made it twice. Once for a dinner party and once for a bridal shower. It has a nice, elegant appearance. I dont think it would be as good without roasting the potatoes. Just toss them in some olive oil and generously salt before roasting. I mixed everything together ahead of time except the warm potatoes. I agree with the previous review, this salad is best warm. Keep the potatoes warm and dress them just before serving. I will make again.

I bake my potatoes with kosher salt and olive oil on a baking sheet and then follow the recipe. I skip the eggs. It's a very good salad. If you make it too far ahead it's not as good. It needs to be warm.

I've made this several times, and it always gets good reviews. One change, though: I don't peel the potatoes or cook them in salt; instead, I steam them til tender, then dress them.

This is excellent! I used new potatoes, and did not peel them. I'm not sure what the point of roasting them with the salt is.
