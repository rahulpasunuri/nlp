Due to dietary restrictions, I used non-fat vanilla yogurt instead of mayo & sour cream. Left out pineapple. After reading reviews, decided to offer dressing as a side. Be sure to FINELY mince ginger as it can be overwhelming to bite into a chunk. My dinner guests had seconds & thirds of the fruit & dressing.

I thought this was good not great. For a really terrific fruit salad, try the GRAND FRUIT SALAD also on this web site. Much better in my opinion.

Good dressing, but I'm not a fan of mayonnaise so I used plain yogurt instead. (Also good with lemon or maple - use custard-style for a thicker consistency). Also, candied ginger and poppy seeds can be expensive in the supermarket, so if you have an Asian market in your area, try there. You will be absolutely THRILLED at the low price you'll find there. P.S. - While you're there, check for the fruit as well. It can be significantly less expensive, but the quality is usually very high.

I only made the dressing and used it on more or less the same fruit ingredients. The dressing was fabulous! Not usually a ginger fan, the cystaline ginger added a very fresh and exotic flavor! My 12 Easter guests raved.

I love this recipe because the dressing goes well with any fruit mixture. I use more crystalized ginger and honey, then sugested. I like to use these fruits any melon, watermelon, graps, kewi, and banana.

I didn't care for this at all. Couldn't taste the crystalized ginger. The dressing tasted too much like mayonnaise. Expensive to make and disappointing.

I made this recipe on the fly ... Used canned pineapple and added some additional mixed fruit not called for. As for the dressing, I really improvised on this one. Discovered I had no poppy seeds or crystalized ginger and barely any mayo left, So I scraped what I could out of the jar, used powder ginger, cinammon and more honey. Surprisingly turned out ok, not too sweet. Mixed in the dressing with the salad.

We had this over the weekend. I substituted vanilla yogurt for the sour cream and mayo, like a previous reviewer suggested, and also took the advice to serve the dressing on the side. It's a great brunch recipe.

Very good - I used about half the amount of ginger, and that was enough. Also - took readers advice and didn't mix in the dressing, and I just drizzled it on top as I served it. I think that the other readers were right about this.

I had this as a dessert instead of a side dish. Very nice, but I agree, serve the dressing on the side.

Excellent, however, I use less mayo.

this is a great recipe--fresh and light. i used vanilla yogurt in place of the mayo and the sour cream to light our cholesterol load and it was very nice. made this in combination with "jerk chicken" (gourmet, february 1993) and "west indian rice and beans" (bon appetit, 3/97).

This is tasty. Serve the sauce on the side as it gets "milky" quickly. The ginger is a nice touch. I omitted the banana this time, next time I won't.

I made this with only grapes, strawberries, and banana because that was all that was in the fridge. I also used a (good) bottled poppyseed dressing. I put the dressing on first, but not too much, as it tends to draw out the juices of the fruit as it chills. The dish was fantastic, even without all the ingredients. Easy and delicious!

I made this for a New Years Brunch and it was a big hit, definitely will make it again! I would not put the dressing on the fruit, I had it in a dish to the side and it was great!

Great recipe! Instead of mixing the dressing in however, I would recommend letting each diner spoon it on as desired.

I also served this at a women's luncheon and recieved many compliments. I had to print out a couple of recipes to go. I would make this again many times but I would not add the dressing until it was time to serve, I didn't like it so watery. The dressing is so creamy and delicious I could easily eat it by the spoonful.

I recently made this fruit salad as part of a buffet and got rave reviews from everyone along with multiple recipe requests. It is refreshing and different as well as easy to make. I will definately use this recipe many times.
