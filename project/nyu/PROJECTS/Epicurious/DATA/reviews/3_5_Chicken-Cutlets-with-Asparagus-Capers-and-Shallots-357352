My hubby made this, and agree with reviewer who said marinade needed to be doubled. Otherwise, superb! Or did it just taste so good because someone else made it? Who knows--we both agreed it was a super and simple chicken breast dish.

This recipe was a great quick find. It was delicious! I did not see that I was supposed to grind the fennel so I used it whole and it was still good. This recipe is a keeper! YUM!

Easy recipe! A little too light for our tastes but I'll definitely make this again especially because I have tarragon in my garden! Next time, I'll increase the mustard and lemon!

This is really good and very simple. The marinade/sauce needs to be doubled. Four minutes per side in the oven is too long, maybe three. I served this with Aw Maw's Potatoes from Cooking Light - fabo dinner!

This was a solid recipe. Not a fan of fennel so used dried thyme instead. We loved the lemon/oil/caper dressing and would double recipe next time. Took out some asparagus to get it to fit in the pan - but was challenging! Worth trying.

The fennel was a lovely twist! Even the kiddos loved the chicken. The part that fell short was the sauce which came out very strong & sour. I will definitely make again as the shallots & asparagus were great, as was the chicken. Definitely more olive oil with fennel to coat all, but overall a terrific recipe once I tweak the sauce.

Great easy and quick dinner recipe. Made enough for 3 servings. The shallots were great. Since I'm not a huge fan of fennel seeds, I wasn't sure I'd like it, but it was fine, not overpowering and other than a subtle flavor, I didn't even realize they were there.

Like others, I couldn't get everything to fit in one pan, so I did the chicken and veggies separately. No big deal. I did end up mixing extra Olive Oil and Fennel for the initial toss. I mixed one batch of the mustard sauce using some fresh tarragon I had purchased, but the sauce was so bitter,I threw it out and remixed it using dried tarragon. I must have gotten some bad tasting herbs from the store, which is weird. But, the dried herbs were fine. The sauce is strong, so just a drizzle on the finished dish is plenty. I thought this was a surprisingly good dish. The somewhat odd combination of fennel, tarragon, mustard, and capers actually works very well!

Since most Epi recipes are good, I decided to try this. I suppose this is a good recipe, but I really don't like the taste of fennel, and I felt it dominated the dish. I used a very large baking sheet, and it barely fit the ingredients. This sheet was too large to fit in my broiler so I had to bake it in the oven on broiler settings.

Fabulous 1-pan dinner! Everything was done at same time. 2-3 servings fit on cookie sheet; otherwise, you'll need 2 sheets.I substituted available thyme for tarragon. As others noted, more oil is needed with fennel seeds. Husband loved loved loved mustard sauce, but it somewhat overpowered the wonderful fennel. Shallots got a little lost, too. I might substitute onion for shallots, and use only fennel seeds OR mustard sauce. Quick enough for a week night, yet elegant enough for weekend.

the sauce poured over the chicken is not the same as the sauce you put the raw chicken in. read the recipe again. the olive oil is divided!!!

My favorite quick n easy recipe. The chicken, onions, and dijon sauce go together nicely. Goes well with rice. Kid friendly because the chicken can be served alone. I pound whole chicken breasts with a tenderizer instead of using cutlets. My only complaint is that I have to cook this in 2 batches bc it doesn't all fit on one pan.

This recipe was wonderful. We loved the combination of fennel seeds with the tarragon dressing. It would not be my definition of a quick and easy meal, but it was worth the time and effort.

This was good, not great. I found this recipe under the Quick & Easy section...however, it took a lot longer than I thought it would. I thought the flavors were very good. I'm not sure what size cookie sheet they use, but I certainly don't have anything big enough to broil the asparagus, shallots & chicken on the same pan. I will make it again, but know that the preparation takes a bit longer than they say.

This recipe was just okay. I loved the fennel and tarragon, but they were completely overpowered by the lemon and mustard. When I broiled the asparagus, shallots and chicken, the asparagus and shallots got done much quicker than the chicken, which is different from the recipe. I wouldn't make it again.

Easy and delicious. I used more olive oil as well and found I needed it. The prior commentator must have misread the recipe - of course you don't garnish with the same olive oil you used to coat the raw chicken. The dressing is set aside, and you coat the chicken and vegetable in the "remaining" olive oil and ground fennel.

This sounds great, and I think I'll make it soon (had chicken and asparagus last night), but I did want to mention one thing: Don't garnish with dressing you've dredged raw chicken in. Yucky.

Nice, easy, quick dish. Good basic in my repotoire now. Can easily alter the sauce with herbs & flavors that are in season or in my pantry, too. I did use more olive oil with fennel or I would have run out.

The fennel-and-oil combo wasn't nearly enough to coat everything, so I added more olive oil. And the BA test kitchens must have some mammoth baking sheets; I put the veggies on one sheet and the chicken on the other, and rotated them under the broiler. Otherwise, tasty good, an easy spring-time dinner.

Excellent! We halved the recipe (dinner for two), but based on a prior recommendation we didn't cut back on the sauce. We loved it.

Followed the recipe exactly and found it delicious, except that I put fresh thyme instead of tarragon as this is what we have in the garden right now. It is pretty easy to prepare and the fennel adds good flavour. The chicken did not brown a lot, but the shallots added good colour and the dressing was just right. The asparagus were perfectly cooked. We ate it with mashed potatoes. Will certainly make it again.

My husband and I both found this pretty bland. The pan was too crowded, so even under the broiler the chicken and shallots seemed more steamed than anything. If I made it again I'd broil in batches and make double the dressing.

I made this last night and this was so easy to prepare and just delicious! I didn't have shallots this time but, the next time I prepare this dish I think I will add baby portabello mushrooms, Yum!! Oh and clean-up was a snap! I covered my baking sheet with aluminum foil.

Very simple, fast but a lot of great tastes and flavors involved. We did not get the fennel seed so i wonder how that would have affected the coating. I would have preferred more asparagus -- next time more veggies! Oh and the IPhone app is great.
