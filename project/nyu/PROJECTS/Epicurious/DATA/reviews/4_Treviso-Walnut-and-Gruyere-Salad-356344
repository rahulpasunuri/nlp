Delicious salad and dressing. Made it exactly as the recipe directed and it was a smash hit. Will definitely make again.

This was nice but I found the gruyere a bit over powering.

Quite possibly one of the best salads I have ever tasted. We used a little more dijon mustard and balsamic vinegar instead of white wine as we didn't have any. It turned out great!
