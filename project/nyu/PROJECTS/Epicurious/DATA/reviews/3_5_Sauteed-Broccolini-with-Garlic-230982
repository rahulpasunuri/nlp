This is very simple recipe that I always follow for my favorite veggie. Tastes even better when the broccolini is slighty burnt

I gave it 3 forks because it really wasn't that innovative but it is really good and really easy. I added pine nuts and this is a nice side dish, partly because the broccolini is so good.

Love this vegie. Like others here, I add toasted pine nuts and a bit of squeezed lemon and maybe some lemon zest. I'm actually going to serve it as an alternative to green beans for Thanksgiving.

Well, I can only give it 3 forks because it is not so much a recipe really as just and idea - but it is a delicious idea! Broccolini is a great alternative for those who are lukwarm on broccoli, due to its milder flavor. I really like the method of boiling the brocolini before sauteeing because it gets rid of the bitterness and acheives a nice, crisp-tender texture. I will be adding this to my repertoire of no-fuss veggies.

This recipe is easy and delicious. It tastes very Italian to me, so I think that it pairs well with any Italian food.

Good & simple way to eat broccolini. I added a little extra garlic and used less oil.

Easy and delicious. Be sure to plunge the broccolini in an ice bath. I reduced the oil and it was fine. I could eat a whole bowl of this.

You won't believe it, but this is one vegetable that is 100% better if you WAY overcook them. I did it by accident the first time, but now it is my typical way of cooking. Carmelizing the broccolini to the point where the tips are charred makes them just amazing. Also, you don't really have to do the extra step of boiling. I just let them sautee on med-low in garlic & oil while my meat is grilling. Even the kids love it.

Great & healthy! I sometimes add pine nuts and raisens. Use good olive oil.
