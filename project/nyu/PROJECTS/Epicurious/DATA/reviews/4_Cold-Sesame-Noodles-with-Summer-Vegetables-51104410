Good recipe and good taste, but a lot of work for the results. Plus, forget about saving left overs, the taste is not as fresh the next day. I will eat it if I come across again, but not my favorite, or a keeper.

Yum! Juicy, fresh, and spicy. Made it with carrots, bell peppers, and radishes. Will definitely be making again soon.

So delicious. Tastes like something I would purchase at a gourmet market or eat in a restaurant. Will definitely make again.

I make this a lot but I use a lot more cilantro and really like to use lightly steamed broccoli rather than just raw veggies. I often grill up some chicken breasts to round out the meal. Delicious and fast, a no-brainer!

My cucumber I had saved to put in this dish was spoiled. It would have been so much better with it! I have a little garden, so I used white finger eggplant instead and it was OK.

I hate to ruin the perfect streak, but this was just okay for me..flavors were okay...a little kick to it, which u like, but the overall dish left me wanting more, maybe a creamier dressing would make it better...maybe

perfect summer dinner! I also cut the amount of oil. Most of the veggies were fine raw, but I did lightly blanch carrot matchsticks and broccoli before adding. I poached some shrimp in the veggie water and sliced a deli-grilled chix breast and served these on the side. That way everyone could have it as they wanted. None leftover. Will def make again. Tahini is an interesting idea.

Crazy, but true. Add tahini and soy at the end, rather than sesame seeds and salt. It brings this dish to a whole new level. All the sesame flavor with the benefit of creaminess.

LOVED this! I cut down on the oil and used peanut oil and added lite soy. I used scallions, red bell pepper in thin small pieces. Company was gonzo over it! I am making it for my next fund raiser. I also made it with tome broth thinned peanut butter added to the other items. Quite good.

This is really delicious; I used less veg than they recommend to better match the amount of noodles and would cut back the dressing to 1/4 cup of each oil and vinegar next time and maybe add some sugar snap peas for color and texture. It goes well with grilled salmon or grilled pork tenderloin.

I really enjoyed this salad. I think next time I would use whole wheat spaghetti instead of soba noodles, I think it might hold up better overnight in the dressing. I would also add more sriracha. I used zucchini, carrots, cucs, red and green peppers. http://sweetpeasandsaffron.blogspot.ca/

Just made this for dinner tonight to use up some soba noodles. I thought it was very good. Used the exact ratio of veg to noodles, and liked it. Added a bit of soy sauce in lieu of added salt. I also toasted the sesame seeds before adding. Will make again!

Delicious! I added a touch of soy sauce and a little more hot sauce. Great way to use veggies from our CSA. I used radishes, cucs, red pepper, carrots, sugar peas, zuc, sunflower sprouts and scallions.

Excellent light summer meal. Cool and refreshing. Served it with thin-sliced pork cutlets marinated Korean taco style.

Very simple good recipe. I did not have the soba so I made it with whole wheat spaghetti, but kept everything else the same except for missing the sesame seeds which I could not find, but it would have been nice to have included. Delicious and fresh and different.

used what was on hand--broccoli slaw mix, red/yellow bell peppers, matchstix carrots and cellophane noodles....whole fam gave thumbs up, maybe they'll give 2 hands up when i make this as per ingredients given LOL

My husband I both liked this a lot. Perfect for a hot summer evening. I added chicken stir-fried in soy, garlic and ginger. It made it more substantial and delicious. Tip--eat it all up. I had the leftovers the next day and it had marinated too long--very overbearing with the vinegar the next day.

Really excellent! Simple to prepare, healthy, very tasty and ideal for warm weather. I followed the directions fairly closely, but I didn't have vegetable oil so I used peanut (seemed a better fit than the olive oil I had), and instead of radish I used a **small** amount of Japanese pickled ginger.

Disappointing. The ratio of veggies to noodles in off and the sauce is rather oily. Bummer. That was a lot of chopping for a mediocre meal.

Very good as is however similar to other recipes. I also made version adding several tbs of peanut butter and ditto soy sauce plus bit of grated ginger plus kicked up the heat with addl hot chili paste. A versatile recipe in which you can utilize lots of different vegetables or seafood, etc. Both versions I added fresh mint and scallions on presentation.

excellent! love the siracha! used a mandoline for the veggies. this dish is great to snack on, very easy and a great way to use those summer veggies.

I added cooked chicken bits and used angel hair rice noodles instead of soba, still came out excellent. The amount of siracha was perfect.

This is my new go-to sesame noodle salad. Simple, delicious, quick, healthy-what's not to love? Made exactly as directed and it was absolutely delicious. I was afraid the amount of sriracha would be too much but it was just right for me (i can handle quite a bit of heat, though)

Delicious and easy - only change will be to cut back a bit of the oil next time.

This was great! Very refreshing. I used all suggested veggies plus added apples.

A quick simple summer recipe. I used a mix of cucumber, red pepper and carrots which was delicious. I also added a little roasted chicken for those family members who must have meat with every meal! I must confess that I found it a little bland (I made it exactly as written), but my family all loved it and have requested it again. I think that I might reduce the oil a little next time.....

This was simple and perfect for summer. It's quite a bit of Sriracha so if you don't like really hot food, reduce it. I also added a little more rice vinegar and make sure you have enough salt. Any mix of vegetables will do: I used carrots, green pepper, radish and cucumber. Finally, I wanted to make it acceptable to my meat loving family. I had some leftover grilled lamb. I sliced it very thin and then stir fried it very quickly with garlic and added it to the noodles. Delicious and I only used 2 oz of meat.
