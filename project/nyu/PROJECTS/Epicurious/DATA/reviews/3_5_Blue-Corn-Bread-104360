Solid basic cornbread recipe. The result was a basic cornbread that paired nicely with chili beans. For the first attempt omitted the garlic/chili and the cilantro to suit the tastes of my family. Also, used a glass baking dish (no skillet available in the kitchen) Considering the amount of shortening in the recipe, I did not grease the pan - and the cornbread popped out just fine.

i PREPARED THE RECIPE AND CHANGED A FEW THINGS TO MAKE IT HEALTHIER LIKE mAPLE SYRUP. USED BUTTERMILK, USED 4 TBS ORGANIC VEGGIE SHORTENING. I HAD RAVE REVIEWS. LOVE THE RECIPE. SANDY

Been making this since the '90's. Never bothered w/ blue cornmeal, always yellow. I also substitute half olive oil for the shortening. It's the best cornbread you will have ever eaten.

I made this and used it in the wild turkey stuffing and thought it was wonderful!

I'm glad I read the review, because it looks like it would be greasy. I just took the regular corn bread recipe and used blue corn meal instead, and then added the serano chillis. A small amount of bacon fat in the cast iron skillet added a yummy flavor as well.

This was extremely greasy. Unfortunately I made it to go in the blue corn bread and shrimp dressing by the same chef. What a disaster. All that effort for down the drain.
