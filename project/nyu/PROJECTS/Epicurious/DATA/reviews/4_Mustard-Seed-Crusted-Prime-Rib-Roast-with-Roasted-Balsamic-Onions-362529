This was delicious. I subbed non-fat sour cream for the creme frais and it still turned out lovely. I also added in some grainy mustard as part of the rub This is on my permanent list.

I made this for New Year's Eve and it met and exceeded my expectations! It was simple and I doubled the onions to enjoy with other things- as they become flavor nuggets of sugar. I will make this again and again. Perfection!

so tender, it melts in your mouth. everyone at the table raved about it, even those that don't normally eat beef.

I made this last year with a slightly larger roast that the recipe called for. It was by far the best christmas dinner we've had in a very long time. Will make again this year. (due to popular demand).

I made this for Christmas last year and it was the best Christmas dinner I have ever had. I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect although I agree the meat is so tender you only need half of the horseradish cream. I'm going to make it again this year.

This was a huge hit at our Easter dinner. I used coarse mustard rather than the mustard seeds. I cooked the roast at 350 for 22 minutes a pound and didn't add the onions and shallots until the last hour and a half. It was medium rare throughout.

How would I make this kosher? How to substitute?

I agree with other reviewers. This was hands down the best prime rib ever, but it was quite rare as we had a very large roast (9lbs). If you're going to invest in an expensive piece of meat, get a GOOD roasting thermometer. The mustard seeds singed and the onions did dry out a bit too much as well. Lower heat and longer cooking time. The horseradish cream was amazing, but I could have halved the recipe as the meat was so flavorful, everyone only needed a spoonful and they are serious horseradish fans. It was a waste to throw away the rest of the cream when the meat was clearly polished off. I will most definitely make this again!

The creme fraiche was wonderful and I followed the horseradish-mustard sauce exactly, and it was a hit! So was the au jus (so easy!). No packages for me. Prime rib mouth watering, but good thing we all liked it rare, because it really could have used a bit more cooking - I'd go with 125 or 130 degrees instead of 120 next time. Definitely the best prime rib I've ever done.

The Christmas Day meal tradition is Prime rib. This recipe is up there as one of the best. Followed the recipe and everything just fell in place. Just needed to watch the cooking time for med rare. Served with steamed carrots, Fitting presentation for our Christmas Day dinner.

We made this for Christmas. It was great. I didn't have any problem with the mustard or onions burning or browning too much. We'll be making this again. The gravy was so good that we made some mashed potatoes the next day to use the gravy up.

Every part of this recipe was great. The dijon was a really nice addition to a traditional horseradish cream. I might add just a little more horseradish next time just because my family really likes it. The roast turned out perfect and the mustard seeds didn't blacken at all, but adding the whole grain mustard is a great idea. The onions and jus were a huge hit. I will definitely make this again!

The dijon-horseradish creme was a highlight. The roast tasted great, but the mustard-garlic rub was too blackened before the internal temperature of the roast reached 120 degrees. Also, the onions could probably use a more oil to keep from crisping black or certainly require more mixing during the roasting. I would do this again, but probably at a lower temperature for longer to preserve the crust on the roast and carmelize the onions.

I just made this for Christmas dinner to rave reviews. I didn't use the yellow mustard seeds, but instead added about a tablespoon of whole grain mustard to the dijon/garlic rub. Everyone thought the jus was fabulous and the onions even better. Great holiday treat!

Delicious.

The onions and shallots were spectacular. The mustard seeds singed, and didn't add to the flavor of the meat. Garlic stuck into the fat, olive oil and salt is the way to go for a prime rib. I will definitely make the onions again.
