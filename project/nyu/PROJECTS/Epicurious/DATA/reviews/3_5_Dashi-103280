It's reasonably good dashi but not great. I followed the recipe exactly - not that hard - and it seemed kinda watery. The dashis I usually get from Japanese restaurants are darker, more brown, more rich, more smoky. Should I add more kombu? simmer the bonito fish flakes longer? I've got plenty of supplies, please tell me what to do to rich it up. I;ll make it again if it can be tweaked

This is a great recipe. I've used it several times and it works fine. If you have issues with fish/beef/whatever, then don't make it. Respect others. Cook as you feel appropriate.

Great start for my miso soup. I'm glad I don't have to buy it from the market anymore.

Being a die hard carnivore I might add meat (of other kinds as well) I would most certainly make it again because it is good regardless of its lack of meat. Vegitarians eat vegitables (with or without fish depends on the vegitarian) but with all this bickering I am tempted to just start calling myself a humanitarian in stead of a carnivore.

A pesco-vegeterian is one that eats fish. There are vgeterians that eat animal products.

I'm an enthusiastic meat eater, and I love vegetables too, but I HATE FISH. Therefore I also object to this recipe's inclusion in the MEATLESS recipes section. I was looking for a vegetarian version of this recipe not because I'm opposed to eating little fishies on philosophical grounds but because the taste of anything fishy makes me gag. This recipe has fish in it, therefore it is not meatless, and should not be in this section.

This is an excellent version of dashi. I am, after 20 years in the food industry, concerned that not eating meat products is creating some physiological deficiency which makes human beings bitter and judgemental. Perhaps its just the toxic residue from the plastic shoes which true vegetarians must wear, seeing as I am sure that none of these highly educated and intelligent vegetarians wear leather.

Thanks, Portland for actually commenting on the quality of the recipe. Store-bought Dashi is expensive, and I'm glad to have finally found a recipe for it. And I'm glad to learn what these concoctions are made of. I don't care if you eat dried fish shavings or not, it's good. Either eat dashi or don't eat dashi....now at least all you vegans and vegetarians know what you have been eating all along. It's a bitter pill, I know.

I like how the cook named Rajiv found this too hard to pronounce.

If you don't like meat, then don't make the friggin' recipe. Simple as that!

Jeez, RELAX is right! A "non-beefarian?" That's a first for me. I guess I'm a "lacto-crustacia-poultarian" then, and my husband's a "as-long-as it-doesn't resemble-weeds-arian." There's a picketer born every minute, isn't there?

Relax, folks, it is just a recipe.

Vegetarians do NOT eat fish. Non-Beefarians eat fish. But fish is meat, so this should not be in the meatless section of recipes.

Please do not call this "meatless"! A fish is an animal not a vegetable.

wrong. most vegetarians do not eat fish. the difference between vegetarians and vegans is that vegans don't do any eggs, cheese etc. vegetarians do.

I have only one problem w/ this recipe: it is NOT vegetarian. bonito shavings are dried fish. for meatless dashi recipes, I recommend JAPAN: THE VEGETARIAN TABLE, by Victoria Wise.
