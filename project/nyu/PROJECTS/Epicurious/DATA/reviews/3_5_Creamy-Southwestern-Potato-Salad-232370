JUst made this salad and I love it. Potato salad with a creamy burn from the spices. I did not put in the hearts of palm since I really dont care for them but it didnt hurt the recipe at all

95% of the time, Bon Appetit recipes are winners. This falls into the 5% category. Even with a lot of salt, and then added pepper, we thought it was greatly lacking in flavor.

I liked it and so did the people at the two different labor day bar-b-ques I went to. The spices were good...the hearts of palm was great...of course I added more cilantro, mayo, salt, i.e., the good stuff~I agree with the rating on this one. Am defintiely putting this in the ol' receipe book!

Excellent recipe! I misread the measurements and used 1/2c mayo and 1/4c buttermilk but I think this worked in my favor, as there was no excess liquid at the bottom of the bowl. I also added a bit more lime juice and cilantro for additional flavor.

Made this for the 4th of July weekend 2 times . Both groups of people raved about it. I also reduced the cayenne by half the second time . A real keeper.

Loved this variation on potato salad. Spices were just right. Put chopped avocado on top just before serving

I thought this was great as did everyone else. Loved the hearts of palm too. Really tasty!

I was rather disappointed. If I were to make again, I would be adding more spices into it.

This is a wonderful variation on potato salad that I will make again. I love the hearts of palm and cumin combination. I added the tomatoes and avocado at the last minute but fixed the rest the night before. I also used a full cup of mayo and less cayenne for my personal taste.

What a coincidence! Like the reader from Vista, CA, I served this potato salad with a Texas style BBQ brisket (from July '99 Bon Appetit). Both the salad and brisket got rave reviews! I wouldn't change anything about the recipe!! My husband says this is his new favorite potato salad.

Great salad and a nice variation from the old standard. Served it with texas brisket, corn on cob with lime-chive butter (from July issue)--what a hit with guests-we all loved the spices and southwest flavors.

This salad was OK, but nothing special. I was not at all crazy about the hearts of palm in it. I'd substitute it for another veggie.
