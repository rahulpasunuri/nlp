i served this over romaine lettuce and found the crab salad itself really blah, even with the addition of more lime juice. i ended up adding balsalmic vinaigrette, which made it palatable. but the mango mint salsa - wow! that's something i'd make again.

simple and light. Perfect with jalepeno or pita chips. Yum yum!

Simple, delicious and perfect for summer. We put individual servings in martini glasses for an elegant touch. This could also work as on hors d'oeuvre if you put small servings onto spoons; bet it would also be yummy on rice cracker canapes.

A delicious summer main dish salad. The combination of the crab with the mango mint salsa is awesome. My husband is not a big cucumber fan and didn't even notice it. I made the recipe as written, only I used thai peppers instead of jalapeno, and made it a little spicier. I served jasmine rice and black pepper poppadums on the side. The perfect complements. I will definitely make this again.

Excellent! I used king crab and fresh mangos instead of the salsa, added about 1 tsp. of red pepper flakes and served slices of avocado on the side. A wonderful spring or summer main dish salad.
