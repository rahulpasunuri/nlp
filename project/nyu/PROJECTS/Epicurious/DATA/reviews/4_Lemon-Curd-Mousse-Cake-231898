This cake is fantastic! It's easy, easy, easy, but a little time-consuming. Well worth the effort. Everyone at Easter dinner wanted the recipe.

I love this cake. The curd on it's own is outstanding and the light and fluffy texture is so welcoming. It's tart and just a little sweet. I do take the sugar down to about 1 3/4 cup as I like a more tart curd.

Be aware this recipe uses raw egg whites, and should be started 2 days in advance (or more). While the recipe is easy, there is a lot of wait time involved prior to serving (first curd, then mousse). I found the taste good but not exceptional, esp. considering the large investment in time and ingredients this requires. Firstly, there is too much sugar. I reduced the sugar in the egg whites to 1/4 cup, and the result was still extremely sweet (and I have a sweet tooth!). Don't sweeten the egg whites, the curd is plenty sweet. Secondly, the crust is a weak point. I used Walker shortbread, and it was 6mm thick and very hard. A thick (bland) crust under such a light airy mousse was not the right compliment in texture, and more or less as hard to bite as a cookie. I would use less or try something else. The presentation was exceptional, so the ordinary taste was a bit of a let down. It was good, just not something worth repeating. Some tips: 1) to make a perfectly even cover of curd I applied it with a flat tip on a pastry bag, leaving 1cm between the curd and edge. I placed rosettes 1" away from the edge, made with plain cream. 2) If your gelatin is clumping, it's probably temperature - give it 15 minutes to soften in cold water, warm it to melting, and add slow to equally warmed curd while stirring constantly.

This was awesome! It was light, not too sweet, not too tart just right. The crust of shortbread was incredible, together with the lemon mouse it was fabulous. I don't see why they call this a cake it is more like a lemon mouse pie almost like a key lime pie but much better.

This is by far one of the best desserts I've ever eaten and the way my family loves it I'd have to say they feel the same way, we are HUGE fans of lemon desserts, anything lemon we seem to favor and this has been one of my most requested to make for a gathering since making for the first time a year ago. You have to be sure not to overdo anything, from the gelatin heating to the whipping of the egg whites and whipping the cream, overdoing any of these will change the consistency of your mousse.

This is by far my favorite desert. I made it for Mothers Day and it was a huge hit so it is reappearing for Fathers Day. So light, such great taste and not overly sweet. If you are traveling with it I would recommend freezing it slightly before the trek - it is a difficult cake to take on the road.

It was better the second day. I had enough mousse/curd to make a small mini cake in a little loaf pan as well and I'm glad I did. The cake was not too labor intensive, and I added lemon rind to the mousse which was nice. All in all a dreamy cake I will definitely make again. Better made a day in advance... Would be good with fresh raspberries on top, or a piece of dark chocolate for garnish.

Rating: 3
If you make the lemon curd in advance, take it out of the fridge early and let it come to room temperature before adding the gelatin to it. Otherwise the curd will clump easily and you will have to keep reheating a portion of the curd and adding it back so that the mixture doesn't clump when you add the whipped cream and meringue to it.

I love to bake, and I love lemon. This is simply perfection! I had pre-made lemon curd in my freezer (I always make lemon curd when I have leftover yolks) so I used that - which cut down considerably on time for making this cake. This makes a LOT of mousse, almost enough for two cakes, in my opinion. Next time, I will make sure not to whip the cream too hard since my mousse was a little dense... I will whip to medium-stiff peaks next time. And there WILL be a next time! I finished this cake all on my own (over a two-week period) and the last bite was just as good as the first.

This is a beautiful cake with brilliant lemon flavor. It is a little time consuming but by no means difficult to execute. I might recommend increasing the gelatin by one or two teaspoons, and making the cake in a 10 inch springform as opposed to the recommended 8 inch. Make sure you give it at least 18 hours to set up completely, or it will collapse. The leftover mousse was delicious topped with a lemon-zest infused whipped cream. I strongly recommend this for any lemon enthusiast.

For anyone looking at this recipe thinking it looks too complicated, trust me, it's not and well worth the little extra time that is involved. The raves and the dessert are well worth it, I can't wait to make it again. The unflavored gelatin, never became "clear", so I just cooked it until it seemed completely dissolved.

I made this for a group get-together and it get great reviews. I was intimidated at first by the multi-step, several day process, as I had never made a mousse cake before. However, it went swimmingly. Just make sure to give yourself plenty of time. You must begin at least the day before or even earlier for the curd. On another note, next time I would line the sides of the springform pan with a strip of parchemnt paper to protect the sides of the cake.

I have made this recipe several times and each with rave reviews. A nice dessert that is refreshing and welcomed during the holidays with all the heavier desserts we have this time of year. I have used both fresh lemons and lemon juice purchased at the store and both are equally good. Make sure not to beat the whipping cream too long as the mousse will be dense instead of a creamier texture. Big fan of this one!

this takes a little time to make and is so worth it! Everyone I have made this for, and I have made it several times now, raves and I have been asked to make again and again.

what a disaster. the gelatin never got "clear," then it clumped with the curd and didn't fold into the egg whites. for some reason, my husband couldn't get the egg whites to stiffen either, so that was a disaster. we ended up not using the gelatin, but making a glorified lemon square cake.

Very impressive--both in how it looks & how it tastes. It took a lot of time (both work time & overall time; it's probably best to start 2 days before you want to serve it) but it's really not too difficult. Some reviews have complained about lumps in the curd. Try this: in the first step for making the curd, start with the cornstarch & about half the sugar, add lemon juice, whisk till completely smooth, then whisk in the rest of the sugar.

an amaaaazing dessert! i've made a couple alterations that i think put it simply over the top. i added lavender extract to the mousse, to taste, and added some cinnamon in with the crust - absolute perfection! i also found that you don't HAVE to chill it overnight, i usually just make the curd the night before and assemble everything else early the next morning :) a perfectly light end to a rich meal!

This is a fabulous dessert and is often asked for, by my family, for holiday celebrations. I will be making it (again) for our Easter Dinner. Everyone I know raves about this recipe. The one drawback is that it is time consuming and somewhat labor intensive. This time around, I AM making the lemon curd ahead.

This was very good. A perfect end to a meal of Osso Buco with parmesan mashed potatoes and green beans. The lemon curd was tangy. I always strain lemon curd after it's cooked. There are always a couple of bits of cooked egg. Making the mousse filling isn't difficult, but it does seem to use up every pot and pan in the kitchen (as a couple of other reviewers have noted.)

does anyone have any suggestions on how to avoid "chunks" in the lemon curd? I had to strain mine before completing the recipe. Also, I think that this recipe could use some more texture. Maybe turn it into a parfait, with these layers: shortbread cookie crumbs, the mousse, raspberry pureed with sugar, whipped cream, and mint garnish.

What a wonderful dessert! I baked the crust and made the curd on Friday evening, made the mousse on Saturday morning and then let it set until the dinner. It requires a bit more work, but it is worth it. I reduced the amount of sugar by 1 cup in the curd and did not use any for the mousse. It was perfect.

This is a great recipe and I received great reviews. The only thing that I changed was I used gingersnaps for the crust and made a different lemon curd. However, I misinterpreted the recipe and didnt' make it quite right. I used all the lemon curd in the mixutre and forgot to save some for the top, so I used fresh raspberries instead. Still turned out great and I would definitely make it again. I even may try it with orange and lime sometime!

Although it takes about 2 days to make - it is worth it. A great recipe you can adapt for other fruits and flavors too.

I made this for my mom's Mother's Day dinner. I used a gingersnap crust (baked for 10 minutes, which was plenty), decreased the sugar to 2c in the curd and 1/2c in the mousse, and garnished with raspberries. It was great and I would definitely recommend those modifications.

This cake was fabulous! It was a little warm in my kitchen when I made the mousse so the egg whites did not react as they should but even so, it was beautiful and delicious and the perfect firmness/consistency . Next time I will put the rosettes on first because they slid off the curd.

Much like the other reviewers, I agree that the sugar should be reduced in the recipe. I decided to use just under 1/2 cup of sugar in the mousse, and this really made the sweetness and tartness of the curd stand out. If I make this again, I will certainly reduce some of the sugar in the curd as well, but not by too much. The cake was a lot of work, but it was worth the outcome - a perfectly light dessert to end a dinner party.

GOOD GRIEF is this sweet. Skip down past all the recent raves and you'll find an embarrassment of comments to the same effect (I sure wish I had read them before making this). And why you would need to chill the curd for SIX HOURS is an utter mystery; with so much gelatin, cornstarch, and egg in it, I let the curd cool to room temp (20-30 min) and it was good to go, texturally at least. The final product is insufferably sugary--even when cold. Halve the sugar for the curd, and it'd probably be great.

I'm a Cordon Bleu trained Chef who only does dinner parties for special occasions, mostly people I know. This week, the person happens to be a well know one--he picked this dessert out of a list of excellent choices. I'm doing the shortbread crust, but I add pecans and some cinnamon and sugar and a little ground ginger. For the presentation, the mousse cake will be center on a dinner plate, a very small scoop of fresh raspberry sherbert and another of lemon custard ice cream--I mean small, with some raspberry sauce will complete the plate--maybe a dot or two of chocolate sauce--finish with a star tip rossette of chantilly (whipped) cream and the guests will rave--it isn't that hard to make the presentation as lovely as the taste. Who cares about how many bowls you wash!

Although this dessert is clearly a lot of work, it was totally worth the effort. Light, fluffy and gorgeous to look at! A couple of things to be mindful of though: make sure you fold in the curd properly..otherwise it gets a little bit lumpy; and secondly, don't cook the crust for too long if you chose the gingersnap option mentioned in other reviews (it gets too hard if you overcook it). Overall, it's a splendid recipe ! I think it could easily be converted into a key lime mousse cake or passionfruit and mango--my next experiment!

Not a big fan of lemon curd, but this mousse cake was tasty! Thanks to previous reviews, I made a gingersnap crust, which went nicely with the lemon. Also, I used another recipe for the lemon curd (found on this site) that calls for equal parts lemon juice and sugar...didn't want the dessert to be too sweet. Had trouble getting the mousse smooth, and would perhaps recommend setting it up in a different order, so that the curd doesn't get lumpy. I put a thin layer of curd on top of the crust, rather than on the top of the mousse...worked nicely, although perhaps not as pretty. While I prefer a lime mousse to a lemon mousse, would definitely make this again.

I'm making this for the second time tonight so I guess we know the answer to the "would you make..." question. It was a terrific spring dessert. I made some changes though. Even though it felt like cheating I used bought curd. Time was short and there was a big crowd to feed. I also happen to love the flavor of limes so I doubled the recipe, made half in lemon and half in lime and then combined opposite spoonfuls in a springform pan. Doubling it sounds like more work than it was - I only whipped the eggs once (just did twice as much) and whipped the cream once too. Just used half with each section. When everything had set I used a bit of lemon to glaze the top as shown and then did that "make circles, draw something through them to make a pretty spider web" thing. Well received - as a matter of fact I don't think anyone even bothered to eat any of the pies that someone else brought to the dinner.

A beautiful and delicious desert. Everyone loved it. I made this in a heart shaped springform pan for a wedding shower.I used Meyer lemons, did cut back slightly on the amount of sugar, and used the Walker's shortbread for the crust, as suggested. Also, I put the final curd layer and the rosettes of mouse on the top before removing the spring form pan. This can be made over a 3 day period so it doesn't seem like a lot of work.

I made this cake for Easter Dinner and it was really a showstopper. Everyone raved, and several asked for the recipe. A caterer even wanted the recipe for a function coming up for 25 cakes! No one found it too sweet, but a couple of comments. I couldn't find my 8 inch pan, so I used a 9 inch. It was plenty high, and maybe it was easier to get a taste of the tart curd with each bite. Lemon juice loses some of it's flavor if it sits before using, so that might affect the sweet/sour ratio, so don't squeeze it and leave it. I made the curd Saturday afternoon, the mousse after Easter Vigil, (about 1:00 am) and added the curd right before dinner at 1:30 pm. Later Sunday night I had the last piece (there were six who ate it, and leftovers were coveted!) and I noticed the lemon curd had gotten a little runnier, with just a teensy drip or two down the side. Maybe letting it sit caused the problem? Also, stirring a mixture with cornstarch after it gels can make it runny; just gently spoon it on the cake. When I make a curd or pudding, I use a heavy saucepan and let the flames just barely lick the bottom of the pan - I strained the curd after reading about the issues, but got nothing more than a couple tiny pieces of white bit, probably from the tougher piece of white that attaches the yolk and a few pieces of lemon pulp. When I smoothed the cake after putting it in the pan, I was very careful not to leave a downward slope at the edges. This is a keeper and worth the work, so don't be afraid to try it. By the way, I was worried after reading all the reviews and made a back up dessert as well!

Made this recipe for Easter and I definitely do not think it is worth all the work (you need way too many bowls). The lemon decorations slide off and make the cake look weepy - I rec'd keeping the cake in the spring form pan until 1 hour before serving. Also, it was too sweet. And by the way, is it OK to eat or serve people desserts with raw egg whites that are not cooked? People liked it - but I did not love it. Would not make again.

Rating: 3
DEFINITELY needs less sugar! I made this recipe to use some really amazing cookie crumbs, and in retrospect I should have realized that the curd recipe calls for far too much sugar. (Sadly I was in a hurry to start and didn't read the user comment.) My usual curd recipe, from Delia Smith, uses only 3 oz of sugar for what ends up being about a cup and a half of curd, and is perfect. I also should have known something was wrong when the sugar carmelized during the cooking process, giving the curd a light golden glossy look. The recipe is otherwise lovely--and beautiful to look at; plus, I didn't find it too gelaninous--but I found it so sweet as to be practically inedible. I sent pieces of the cake to school with my daughter today and it was rejected by 12 year olds as being too sweet, which is the ultimate test. I will absolutely make this again but I will cut the sugar to between one-third and one-half of what's called, for, or else just make my usual curd recipe, with an adjustment for quantity.

I made this for a special in-laws family occasion. Everyone thought it was delicious, even me and I am not generally a big fan of lemon desserts or of mousses and have never made one before. I read all the reviews and suggestions and made these changes for mine: I reduced the sugar in the curd to 2 cups and increased the lemon juice by about 1/3 cup, and added zest for more flavor. I strained it and was glad I did as indeed there were little white 'bits' and I have never had this problem before even though I have made many a curd. Next time I'd use my usual curd recipe instead that does not contain starch and is much smoother and more lemony. I made an extra 1/4 recipe of curd, and used this to increase the curd amount in the mousse by an extra 1/2 cup, an idea from the review from the Cook from Houston because I was afraid of a too gelatinous mousse. This worked out perfectly; firm enough to slice & serve neatly but no gelatinous texture apparent at all, just creamy and light. I did not adjust the sugar in the mousse (but might next time, probably only by maybe a 1/4 cup, having already decreased the sugar in the curd). I also used Walker's shortbreads for the crust and they were great - absolutely DO NOT skimp on a good crust. The only problem I had was that the rosettes kept sliding off the cake and down the sides (maybe I shouldn't have put the curd right to the edge?). My husband and I both agree that the changes I made worked perfectly; it was tart enough and we wouldn't have wanted it any sweeter. It didn't really take that much time; the curd step, the mousse step, and the finishing each took only about 45 min each and I enjoyed being able to spread the work out over a few days. This could easily be adapted by using any other flavor curd. Altogether a lovely meltingly light mouth-watering lemony dessert if that's what you are looking for.

I also started this late, so only had time to use store bought lemon curd in the mousse. It was delicious. Even family members who usually don't like lemon LOVED this cake. I made my own curd to put on top, and I guess it was a little runny because the lemon wedge decorations kept sliding off!

This cake was absolutely lovely and delicious. I toned down the sugar as recommended and still it was very sweet, but not excessive. The lemon flavour dominated, the textures were fabulous, and the little slices of lemon looked great. I had no mousse left over since i had to use a 9" pan but just the curd and the lemon wedges were still very pretty. Very light and refreshing (despite obvious nutritional bombshell) and perfect for summer. While you do have to start in advance, it's also remarkably easy.

This went over beautifully with our dinner party for eight. We all agreed that it was a little sweet, and I'd already cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup as per previous reviews. Next time I'll go for 1/4 cup - the lemon flavor is perfect, doesn't need that much sweetness. I used Robertson's lemon curd as the Trader Joe's just wasn't as good (it took 2 jars so was expensive, but much quicker). Actually, lemons are 79 cents each so I'm not sure which would be a better bargain. I also used Keebler shortbread cookies for the crust and a 9" springform pan, and it was perfect! Due to the larger pan I didn't have any mousse left over so made dollops with Reddi Wip whipped cream and the tiny lemon slices in 1/4ths. Very attractive dessert.

I made this over the weekend and would have given it four stars but for the weird approach to the lemon curd. What's up with the cornstarch? I made it -- I'll try anything once -- but having made curd for years, I don't see the reason for it. Worse, I could taste it (though I don't think most of my guests noticed it). I'll make it again without the corn starch because the texture is light and lovely.

Rating: 4
Have made this twice now & loved it both times. This last time I made it with Trader Joes's lemon curd & it really shortened up the prep time. Using good shortbread cookies for the crust is imperative. I have gotten to the point now that I often try to make "smaller desserts" - I think that next time I would cut the recipe in half & make a "shorter" version, since I don't often have groups large enough to consume the full size dessert.

Time-consuming but worth it. I didn't have enough time the day before to chill the curd for 6 hours before making the mousse so I alternated between the freezer and the fridge for three hours to chill and it didn't seem to hurt it. Then didn't have extra lemons to decorate so used daisies instead! Very pretty. The texture was perfect with a little less than 3 1/2 tsps of gelatin instead of 4. Party guests absolutely loved it.

I am a lemon curd lover so naturally I loved this recipe! As to the reader with a question about straining the curd: I cook mine in a metal bowl over a pan of very hot water- this cooks the egg whites properly (and I don't strain the curd afterwards because it is always perfect). Some people don't like the lemon zest- just use bigger pieces that you can pull out by hand!

I made this cake twice now and both times I had the same problem-- I had to strain the curd in order to get the right consistency, and I lost some curd in the process and ended up with quite a thin layer on top.

this was fantastic. i used meyer lemons but added some regular lemon zest to the mousse for some zing. the lemon curd was made a day in advance, which made it a lot less stressful when i made the rest of the cake. cut back on the gelatin and liked the texture, but it wouldn't stand up straight when it was on the plates! it was better one more day in the fridge. in all, lovely dessert that is light and somewhat addictive.

This recipe got great reviews for a mothers day party. I thought I've had better though. I would recommend for other learning cooks, to strain the curd for little bits of egg if you're not an expert. Also, use the best shortbread for the crust, like Walkers brand, I think it really makes a difference. It was a great make-ahead cake.

I used 2 cups of sugar when making the curd and think this is just the right amount. I also used the Walker shortbread for the crust. Delicious. I think I would whip the egg whites and sugar before preparing the gelatin portion so that they could be combined before the gelatin sets up otherwise its hard to get the mixture smooth. I also used a 9" springform pan which is just the right size. I didn't want to bother to make rosettes for the top so I decorated with fresh raspberries and strawberries. Looked and tasted great. The dessert was very well received at our Mother's Day lunch.

I made the cake for Mother's Day, it was beautiful and everyone loved it, a light ending to a filling meal. It held its shape well, but the mousse was a bit gelatinous. I'd recommend using a Kitchen Aid for the mousse, and straining the lemon curd. Lorna Doone cookies were perfect for crust, and I added a hint of cinnamon for extra sweetness. As other reviews stated, it was a multiple-day recipe and used every pot and bowl in the kitchen. The results were worth the effort, I think, and I'd make it again.

This is good. I have a similar, richer, lemon cheesecake recipe that rates far above this, so I probably won't make this again. I would reduce the gelatin the next time to improve the texture and add some lemon peel. If you want something lighter than cheesecake, this is a good option.

Even my chocoholic father-in-law loved this. However, I did screw up making it. I forgot the part about saving some of the curd for the top. When I had too much curd left over, I simply split it up and added it to the 3/4 cup and 1 3/4 portions since I was using a 9-inch pan and was concerned about having enough filling. (I did not change the amount of any of the other ingredients.) I did not realize my error until the next morning. I ran out to the store and bought a jar of lemon curd for the topping. However, based on the other reviews about the mousse having too much of a gelatin texture and not enough of a creamy texture, I think my mistake was for the best as the mousse turned out very creamy but held its shape well. I think I will incorporate this mistake when I make this in the future, which I am sure I will be doing based on my family's ravings about this one. As they all said, "it's a keeper" which is more than they said for the entree I served (roast fillet of beef with cornichon tarragon sauce).

Lots of pans but well worth the effort. This was a definite hit!

Time consuming Yes, but worth it! I decided to go on without the 3/4C. sugar needed for the whipped cream, after sampling the curd. The mousse turned out just perfect, not too tart and not too sweet. Will do it again this way. I would not use this curd recipe on its own, because of the starch and the sweetness. Somebody asked for advice regarding the starch. My trick is to blend all the ingredients in an electric blender before heating, except the butter.

I made this for an Easter dinner and it was delicious! Yes, it's a bit time consuming, but I clean as I go. Worth every minute. I was able to use gluten free shortbread cookies for a gluten free dessert!

I made this for Easter and I too must agree with others "lot of work for the end result". Pots everywhere. The mousse was creamy and tasted great until the gelatin set. Too gelatinous and firm, not creamy like a mousse should be. I would try using less gelatin. The cook curd method over medium heat in a heavy pot was not so great. I had more control over the curd using the double boiler method. Which was cooking the curd in a bowl over boiling water being careful not to have the water touch the bowl.

I made this for a family dinner and have to agree with others that this was a lot of work for the end result. I felt like everything in the kitchen was dirty when I finished. The flavor was just fine, but if I do decide to make it again, I would use less gelatin to see if I could make the texture more creamy - too gelatinous for my taste. Of the eight people attending 2 liked the consistency, but the other 6 would prefer a creamier feel. All enjoyed the flavor-3 compared it to key lime pie.

Delicious.Elegant. I thought this was a nice end to a meal. Sweet but light. Have made this cake twice and both times a success. Much faster the second time. Have had many requests for the recipe. It is a keeper, to be made time and time again.

Yes time consuming. Yes delicious. My duaghter spotted this in a Bon Appetit and begged me to make it. I used graham crackers for the base (they were in my cupboard), which worked fine. The mousse was more than needed for the 8/9inch pan. As I wasn't making this for any special occaison and my kids were salivating, rather than let them wait till the next day I froze the remaining mousse in 3 ramekins for a few hours, much to their delight. I eventually served this with fresh raspberries and a raspberry coulis, whose tartness cut the sweetness of the mousse. A great success, and well worth the effort!!

This is an excellent recipe and worth the couple of days to prepare. I used Walker's shortbread cookies for the crust and will do so again. They definitely made a wonderful crust. Make it for company or a large family gathering because it does make a substantial cake.

I measured the ingredients exactly as the recipe specified, and thought the cake came out too sweet. Next time I would definitely cut down the amount of sugar like other reviewers suggested. I also thought this recipe makes enough mousse to fill a 9 inch pan. In the future I might adjust the recipe for the crust and use a 9 inch pan for a larger crowd. Lemon curd required constant stirring over gentle heat, but was not difficult to make. Although not specified in the recipe, I was glad I strained the finished curd with a fine sieve. I was able to extract quite a few hard little bits of egg white. Question: What size of start tip should I use to make the rosettes of mousse that look exactly like the ones in the picture? I made eight rosettes by using #30 and they were too small. Thanks!

Pretty dessert, light and cool. This was easy to make, especially since I had lemon curd already stored in the freezer and only had to defrost what I needed to avoid making that part of this recipe. I'm sure commercial lemon curd would work just fine, but this calls for 2 1/2 cups of it, so it's not cheap to buy pre-made curd. I used Lorna Doone's for the crust. If something's worth doing, it's worth doing right and with the best of ingredients.

Made this yesterday (well finished it yesterday) and it turned out perfect. It is time consuming but not difficult. I also cooked the egg whites like another rater suggested. I did not cut down on the sugar, I found the sweetness to be just right. Everyone raved about the crust, I used cheap butter cookies and added lemon zest and a tbls. of sugar. I also used fresh whipped cream for the rosettes instead of more of the mousse. This also has great presentation. Looks like somthing you bought from a bakery.

This may take some time to prepare, but WOW, is it worth it. I followed the advice of one review and cut back on the sugar in the curd...DON'T! After folding the meringue into the curd, I new it would not be sweet enough. I ended up adding back the sugar I cut into the whip cream as it was beating for more sweetness. It came out perfect! I only chilled this 6 hours before unmolding and it was wonderfully set up. Everyone just SWOONED over the lightness of the lemon flavor and the creaminess of it. I used some very expensive shortbread for the crust. I'm not sure it's necessary. Next time I will try using Keebler's "Just Shortbread" cookies, as they cost much less. To the cook below who thought her cornstarch did not dissolve...it probably is not the cornstarch, but bits of cooked eggwhite. I had this problem too, but solved it by straining the curd before cooling.

Made this for company softball fundraiser today and it was a hit. Actually fairly straight forward. My only problem was with the corn starch. Thought I'd got it dissolved but little lumps of it kept showing up in the curd. Any tips would be appreciated.

Light & airy!! The filling for the cake was just that. I got rave reviews, but it looked like Napalm went off in my kitchen. The amount of bowls and saucepans that the recipe required was ludicrous, just to make a simple 8"-diameter cake. The 1st time I made the lemon curd it was a disaster & the smell was...UGH...needless to say I wasn't really in the mood to attempt it again that evening. If you're not into whisking for long periods of time (12-15min is a pretty long time for your arm to keep beating) then buy the lemon curd, b/c it's just not worth the effort. For the crust, I processed biscotti in the blender. Overall, I don't think I'll make it this one again. I liked the lemon curd, assuming you can get it to turn out, but the fact that the beaten egg-whites aren't cooked for the filling kinda turned me off. I liked the texture of the mousse cake, but unless you're serving to a large number of people then I'd choose another recipe.

I liked this OK the first time I made it but not enough to try it on my clients. I agreed w/ the reviewer who said the crust was the "weak spot" so I tried it again using a thin sponge cake (like I use for cheesecakes) - much better!! I might try a genoise bottom before I decide to start offering this but the mousse filling is easy and delightful!

I saw this recipe at an airport and had to buy the magazine. Prepared the cake for my daughters Baby Shower. It was fantastic. Very light, even with the cream. The lemon curd finished it off. In fact I will probably use the lemon curd recipe by itself for scones. Looking for a reason to make it again. My daughter-in-law helped wash all the pans and dishes and that was a big help. Keep these recipes coming!

I thought this cake was great! My only problem was that I didn't whip the whipped cream quite stiffly enough and when I unmolded the cake it was a little oozy. I re-molded it and put it in the freezer. It should be fine. Regarding the raw egg whites, I actually heated the egg whites with the sugar over a double boiler before whipping them to pasturize them. They whipped up great and I had no worries about using raw egg white. I am looking forward to trying it again - I actually made it kosher for passover using kosher for passover cookies, and potato starch.

When you live in a place with lots of citrus this is the dessert! I cut down on the sugar in the lemon curd to 1 1/2 cups and liked it without sacrificing taste. Yes, it's time consuming, but worth the reward!

I used commercially available lemon curd and it certainly cut down on the prep time. I omitted the fancy toppings and it was still delicious.

Excellent. I've made this twice now, and it has a fabulous, light texture. I agree with other reviewers that it is time consuming to make the curd one day and the rest of the cake the next. But if you want to skip the lemon curd step, you can use purchased lemon curd. You just have to calculate how much curd you need to topping and stirring into the mousse layer.

I made this recipe twice. I first tested it on neighbors. It was delicious but too sweet. I made it for a fundraiser, using slightly less sugar, which gave it a fresher, lighter taste. I also used Walker's shortbread cookies for the crust. Everyone raved about it!

I was making this for a luncheon, but I didn't read the recipe well enough beforehand. With the extra day, I ended up giving it to my husband to take to work. I never got to try it, but there were rave reviews. My husband commented that the crust was the weak point (I used Lorna Doone). Might try graham cracker crumbs next time. In any case, delicious.

This turned out really great. The family all have asked me to make this again. The only trouble I had was getting the curd to set on the top. It was perhaps too thin so it dripped a bit on the sides.

I thought this was excellent. My only complaint was lots of dishes to wash when it was done. My gelatin disolved well so I didn't have the problem as the previous reviewer. This dessert was gone in no time!! I received lots of compliments.

It's essentially a 2-day project, but not complicated. The only problem I had was with the gelatin (I assume), the mousse had little globs of it in it at the end. Don't think that this keeps very well, because of all the uncooked eggs.
