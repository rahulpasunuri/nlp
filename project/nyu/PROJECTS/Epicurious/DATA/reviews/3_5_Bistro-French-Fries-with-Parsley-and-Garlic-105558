Easy and fabulous. A nice healthier companion to turkey burgers. Using sea salt is a nice touch and adds more complexity to the flavor.

These were okay, nothing too spectacular though. Did exactly as the recipe states but had to turn the temp up to 450 and cook an extra 10 minutes, otherwise they were just fry shaped baked potatoes. Somewhat labor intensive for the end result.

Nice simple recipe I wasn't too concerned with crispiness as I was plating the fries with steak au poivre, but they were pretty firm.

Rating: 3
These are so good. I slice them a little thicker than indicated, and they turn out not crispy, but soft, medium brown, and well done. A convection oven speeds up the baking time, too.

I just wanted to revise my review a little bit, because it turns out that this has become a standard in our house. For that reason, I've changed the rating from 3 to 4 forks. This recipe is easy, delicious, and it even impresses guests. I would highly recommend it.

Mmmm, I took the advice of using the silpat and they turned out just fine. I also put them under the broiler for a few minutes afterwards and they came out just the way I like them-crispy (without the rotating and turning)! The rack was in the middle of the oven. I will definitely make these again. I'd like to try using sweet potatoes next time as well!

Mmmm...a big pile of potato mush in my baking pan...fun. :-( So much for crispy and overdone... It seemed that, with all of the oven door opening that needed to be done (for rotating and turning the potatoes every 10 mins), 425 wasn't quite hot enough (yes, I closed the door while turning). I'd make it again, but with some modifications of the temperature and such.

I made these for the kids, using 1 russet and 2T canola oil, turned every 10-15 minutes for somewhere between 45 minutes to an hour... and they got too crispy and dry. I'm going to give it another shot with less time (also I might have cut them too thin), and even another try broiling them like 1 reviewer said. I want to get this recipe right because it's such a healthy version of french fries. So, no rating yet! Oh, I didn't have parchment but used a silpat and had no sticking problems.

I love garlic fries. There is a resturant in Healdsberg, CA called Willi's Seafood and Raw Bar. They serve garlic fries with Laura Chenel goat cheese ranch dressing that is to die for. You can find the recipe here http://www.relishcul inary.com/files/RR_r ecipes_MS.htm You will love it!

I thought that this recipe makes for a good weeknight side (especially since you don't have to peel the potatoes). My only suggestion is to not cook the potatoes until they're all nicely browned--they will be overdone. I was also having a wicked sticking problem until I dumped the fries onto parchment paper, which worked beautifully. I agree with other people that you could probably use a lot more garlic. I soaked the potatoes in hot water for 10 minutes before cooking, as suggested by a Cook's Illustrated oven fry recipe. I'm not sure if it made a difference, but there's some solid food science behind adding this step.

My search for le frite parfait is OVER. These were so delicious....and I didn't even add the parsley. I did sprinkle some parmesan over the finished product, though. I cut the potatoes the night before and kept them covered in a bowl of water in the fridge. It saved a lot of time. Also served them in little glasses to up the elegance factor. Just an idea.

I hate doing this but I do alter the recipe slightly. I use olive oil. Sometimes I have even done cilantro instead of parsley. It's always good either way. These are my go-to fries. Perfect every time. I use parchment paper & have never had a sticking issue. Sometimes I do coat them additionally with oil though throughout the cooking if they look like they are getting too dry. I agree that you should add the garlic in the last few minutes to really get the aroma going.

Extremely easy and quite good. I even omitted the parsley because I was out of fresh parsley, and this side dish turned out perfectly.

Everyone loved these! Even my food snob brother-in law. The parchment paper was the key to crisp, no stick fries.

Outstanding recipe. Folks, lose the parchment paper. Get Sil-pats. They are silicon inserts for your pans. You can use them over and over. Back to the recipe...very good. I did find that I had no interest in waiting an hour or so. Poke potatoes with a few holes, put in the microwave for about 4 minutes. Then proceed, but only cook about 30 minutes. Works great.

Would have given this 4 forks except for the sticking problem. The parchment suggestion did the trick. I modified this to duplicate my favorite restaurant's rendition. Tossed the hot potatoes with shredded parmesan and white truffle oil yum.

I will make this one again and again. It's similar to a favorite dish served at the Bear Tooth Grill in Anchorage...except the parsely there is replaced with cilantro for a more decided flavor. The only change I made other than cilantro was to return the fries to the oven after tossing with the garlic and cilantro for a few minutes, allowing the garlic to roast just bit to take off some of the bite. That requires pulling the naked fries just a bit before they look done so that they're not overcooked at the end, but it's worth a try if you have to out later!

Note for new cooks like me: wax paper is not the same thing as parchment paper! I was grateful for the non-stick ideas from other users, but thought wax paper WAS the same thing. My beautiful fries stuck terribly--and I even pammed the paper!

Great recipe! I lined the a baking sheet with "Reynolds Release No-stick foil" to solve the sticking problem.

Just had to put in my two cents about the sticking issue. I was having a huge sticking problem with baked fries and it finally dawned on me: parchment paper! A total success. I also go lower with the temp - 375 and turn after 20 minutes. They come out fabulous with just olive oil and salt. Just crispy enough.

Rating: 4
These are absolutely fabulous! I did half peanut and half olive oil, and omitted the parsley. Also, I lined the pans with foil and then sprayed with Pam after they initially started to stick. I was a little hesitant about using the raw garlic, thinking it might be a bit too strong. WRONG! It was so delicious. There isn't really that much of it, and then it just imparts flavor on the fries and settles to the bottom of the bowl. As the recipie states, some are not very crispy, but if you really wanted McDonalds fries, you'd just go to the drive thru, right? Try these, you will love them.

Use unpeeled russets and olive oil and these may be the best fries you will ever not have to go out for

Excellent fries, some of the best we've ever had and with much less fat. We cooked for an hour and made sure to turn every ten minutes. I believe that is the trick.

I made these for Valentines Day with grilled porterhouse steaks coated in pepper. The whole meal was awesome. I listened to other reviewers and turned the fries every 10 minutes. They came out perfect!

Take the advice to turn fries frequently (every 10 minutes?) to prevent sticking. I didn't have parsley on hand so I used a little dill instead. Husband gobbled up everything that I intended to have leftovers but didn't have any leftover.

Very very good, nice touch of garlic, simple preparation except turning them around while baking which proved to be quite a painful experience.

Rating: 3
These are great, I have made them often. I like to bake them extra crispy and add a little butter when I toss them with the garlic and parsley. Made them last night for a new BF, halved the amount of potatoes and oil but not the additions, served w/ filet mignon and a bearnaise sauce, and he ate the fries cold out of the serving bowl after the ones on his plate were gone--pretty much ignoring the beautiful steaks for the fries! Oh well--there's no accounting for taste.

These were the best french fries we ever made. But we had a little problem...a few were burnt. We ran low on parsley and added fresh chopped rosemary and chives -- a great addition. Good with a kid around.

Rating: 4
These french fries are my favorite! They taste just like the fries at my favorite french restaurant. Be sure to slice thin and arrange evenly on the baking pan or you won't get crisp fries. Also be sure to move them around as they bake - to cook evenly.

i tossed & cooked garlic with potatos. also did the same thing wiht sweet potatos (sans garlic). a hit

Rating: 3
These were excellent! I broiled them instead of baking which made them extra crispy on the outside and just right on the inside. I also added parmesan cheese and extra garlic. Everyone loved them!

Rating: 2
I had a problem with them being a bit mushy as well, and I cut my potatoes larger than the other reviewer. Any advice on how to make them crispier (other than deep frying...) ?

Rating: 3
I liked the dish but it didn't look like I expected. A lot more mushy...not clean cut fries. I cut them quite thin, maybe a little thicker next time. I also cut the potatoes too early and the color changed. Doubled the garlic, maybe a little over the top. They were a hit regardless of my worries. Easy to make.

Rating: 4
This recipe was GREAT!!! I added a little salt before I cooked it so it would get absorbed into the potatos. They taste better than restaurant fries with almost 1/3 of the fat. Don't hesitate, make them now!!

This is a great and easy way to make potatoes -- just slice 'em, put 'em in the oven, and your done. More or less. Given the kid's rave reviews, I know I won't have a choice but to make these again.
