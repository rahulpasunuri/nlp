The original recipe is meant for Roasted Salmon with salsa verde, and it is awesome. I made it many times years ago, and just found it again, it's wonderful for a large dinner party.

The salmon juice comes from roasted salmon, as this salsa verde recipe was first published as Salmon with Salsa Verde. If you're making the salsa by itself, you can just leave it out or add another liquid (or water) if the salsa is too thick.

I think "salmon" was a typo for lemon. I've made this twice now and both times I put the sauce on the roast as it cooked. Since it cooks at such a low heat it turned out great. Oops!
