Delicious. I was looking for a way to use my returned-from-winter sage and two porkchops to feed 4 people. I hacked them into pieces and substituted them for the ground pork. I also took the suggestion to add ground fennel seed, red pepper flakes and garlic. And the shop didn't have my preferred canned tomato, so I chopped fresh tomatoes for a lighter sauce. Maybe my saffron was too old, but I didn't think it added much using it in this way. I would make this again with an herbed pork sausage.

This pasta is one of my favorites to make. The fact that you can make the sauce in advance is a bonus when making for guests. The bacon cannot be omitted or the dish WOULD be too bland. Same goes for the saffron.( you need much more of this than you think) I like the idea of adding garlic. But at the same time it is refreshing to enjoy the other flavors without interruption from the expected taste of garlic in a tomato based sauce.

easy to make, i added too much red pepper though so it drowned out the other flavors.

We made this recently for a dinner party and it was a hit! I had one friend who called the next day for the recipe because she had 'dreamed about it all night'.

I loved this bolognese variation although my husband thought it was just so-so. I skipped the pancetta for a healthier dish and didn't have any saffron. I used a whole pork tenderloin which I ground up in my food processor myself and canned tomato puree. Added 1 t. red pepper, 1/2 t. fennel and 4 cloves of garlic as previous revieweer suggested. Served with wheat penne. Delicious!! Am serving this for a big party with garlic bread and a green salad in a couple of weeks. Will use the saffron this time. Wonder if the sauce freezes well?

Unbelievably tasty. I followed the advice of the reviewer who suggested the additions of fresh garlic (I chopped 5 cloves), whole peeled tomatoes, and fennel seed, and the dish was brilliant--even though I didn't have pancetta, or even bacon, handy. Qualification: a picky New Yorker with two picky (but not indulged) kiddos! This dish has officially entered the regular rotation, as a treat.

I love making this dish - and it does taste better when the sauce is prepared one day in advance...

Hmmm I wasn't sure if I liked this at first. I think that the saffron didn't come through as much as I thought it might. I think rice lends itself better the absorbing the flavor. I added a tiny bit of garlic powder and a generous amount of dried basil upon trying this. I also added a good bit of red pepper flakes. I used more cheese than the recipe called for. It tasted a lot like a stew because of the bay leaves but I think the leftovers might be even better. I would say without some of the additions it would have been too bland. Also I didn't have a pound of pork so I used the pork I had and a the rest was meatloaf combo meat of veal beef and pork. I also had bacon I wanted to get rid of instead of pancetta. I don't think that I would have made said I would make it again without the alterations.

We love this recipe. It is something out of the ordinary, yet quick enough to make it during the week. I like to use tomatoes i can from farmer's markets for this.

I think this is probably bland as written. I mixed this up with the Mallordeus Mario Batali did in one of his cookbook, so i made 3 changes. Added 1 TBS fennel seed, 1 TBS Red Pepper Flakes, and 4 cloves garlic. It was awesome. I made a saffron-egg paparedelle to serve it over. Delicious!

I was intrigued by the unusual ingredient of saffron, but was very disappointed with the outcome. I agree with some of the other reviewers that this dish is very bland.

This is my "be good to me I've had a bad day" recipe that I get my husband to make me. Great, easy, love it. Don't overdo the saffron.

this was an interesting experience. i was very, very skeptical about this near the end of the cooking process (almost didn't want to eat it, because ground pork looks so gross). the first bite, it was ok. by the end of the meal, we liked it. then, on the following two nites of leftovers, we really became fans! we will add this to our repertoire. ps we can't afford the saffron, and it was still fine. wish we knew what it was like with the saffron.....

This recipe remains dear to my heart. Have been making it since 2002 on a regular basis, especially on those cold winter nights. For my husband and I, this defines comfort food. Delizioso!

I'm joining the fans of this dish! I've made this at least twice a month since I stumbled upon it purely by accident a while back. The one and only change I make is to use whole tomatoes instead of crushed. Just my personal taste, I find that the dish is much more flavourful and less overwhelmingly "tomato-ey". I've used both fresh (that I froze whole from my garden) and canned with equally good results. Mmmmmm...

This is an awesome pasta dish for those who like the saffron flavor of paella but don't have the time to make it. We make this recipe all the time. It's great for a stay at home dinner with a nice bottle of wine.

I had to buy all of the ingredients for this recipe right before making it and it cost $30. I think that's a bit much for a recipe which tastes good, but is definitely nowhere near the best pasta dish I've ever had. Even without the saffron, it would still be expensive for a relatively basic pasta dish.

Nice for a basic, quick, spaghetti sauce. Far to bland for my family's taste. I added garlic, chili flakes, oregano and tomato paste. Very easy and quick. I can see why people's children like it, it has only onions, parsley and a bit of pancetta in it for flavour. I won't make it again, as it stands, but with the additions, yes.

I have made this dish over and over again. It's simple, has good flavor, and is fresh and filling. Definitely don't overdo it on the sage, though. That stuff can pack a wallop!

I thought this was not a very tasty recipe. The sage was lost in the sauce, and the pork tasted like chicken which is very bland as a bolognese.

Very interesting mix of flavors, and a deep, rustic and filling sauce. The saffron makes the meal taste a bit lighter than I think it would with plan pasta. I used small shells (only non-ribbon pasta we had on hand) and it was fine. Real gnocci strike me as being too heavy for this sauce.

Very simple yet rich dish. It only takes a minuite to throw it all togehter, I however did add a little too much sage, but even so, it was still very good. But beware it is a little rich. My husband is a fool for anything with saffron so I will definantly make this again

Fantastic flavor. I followed the recipe to the letter, and although the saffron-infused pasta was interesting, I found that the flavor was lost once the pasta and sauce were mixed together. Because saffron is so very expensive, I will omit it next time around (and there will definitely be a next time!)

Stop right now and print this recipe! This is the best pasta I ever made. My father said it was the best he ever had(including his trips to Italy).This is also very easy and impressive. With the savory pasta, serve it with the sweetness of roasted peppers or salad and reduced balsamic with goat cheese.-ooohhhh!

This dish is superb! It's a favorite of my somewhat picky 6 yr old. The second time I made it I used a combination of beef, pork and veal. Delicious and very simple to make. Tastes even better as leftovers!!

My husband (not a cook!) made this for me for my birthday. I suggested he use mint in lieu of the sage, as it sounded a bit heavy. The rest of it was made as per the recipe and was fabulous.

Very good.Quick bolognese. Use 4oz.pancetta, fresh basiel,and extra virgin oil at end. Didn't mix cheese in w/sauce, just put locatelli and reggiano in dishes. The cheese does add to the sauce. DOn't forget the sage - nice twist.

Delicious. It was surprisingly light and very very tasty. Try and use the fresh sage it makes a big difference. Perfect for weekday nights when you don't want to spend alot of time in the kitchen after a long day at work. The meal took about an hour from beginning to end.

Very good! Even my "picky eater" husband liked it! It has a very rich flavor and nice combination of ingredients. Will definitely try this again.

A winner! Very rich and satisfying. I ran out of Parmesan cheese (gasp) so I only used about 1/3 of a cup, but that seemed to be enough due to the richness of the dish. This would be great with beef or shrimp as a substitute for the pork -- very versatile and supremely simple.

A variation on spaghetti bolognese that was very good. I stuck to the recipe religiously, except I used a gnocchi-type pasta because I couldn't find orchiette at my supermarket. It's a good dish to serve for a large group, simply served with a salad and crusty garlic bread.
