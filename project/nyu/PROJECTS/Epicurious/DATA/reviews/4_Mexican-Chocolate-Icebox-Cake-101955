I made this cake for the ladys in the office a couple years ago and they still talk about it. Absolute chocolate heaven!

I'm making this again. It also works well with the dry (crisp) ladyfingers soaked in coffee and Kahlua. I always make it with cream cheese in place of the butter too. Wonderful and very pretty cake.

I made this recipe many years ago and loved it then. I did however follow the suggestion and replaced the butter with cream cheese. I thought about soaking the lady fingers with the Kaluha, but thought with the cinnamon it was just perfect. There was not a crumb on anyones plate!

I made this cake a year ago for the office. This is a cholate lover's dream! My coworker's took a picture of this prior to eating, it was beautiful. Everyone loved it and it bumped my status to the office gourmet chef!

This dish really gives you a great product for a small amount of work. I couldn't find ladyfingers so I used nilla waffers dipped in coffee liqueur. It came out great! Next time I might include a little more cinnamon to give it some more kick, but I will make this again for sure.

This was an amazing recipe. It was very rich, and mainly for adults. I brushed the ladyfingers with Kahlua, as some comments recommended, and I also put some Kahlua into the pudding; it just spiced the flavour a bit, but didn't make an alcholic flavour. A must make for a big occasion, (I made it for a big family get-together). WARNING: Can be expensive. It uses 4 squares of unsweetened chocolate, which is half the bar. For some of us non-rich chefs, yeah it's expensive.

This is an easy and good dessert. I agree with the other reviewers to substitute the butter for cream cheese. It's also nice to brush the ladyfingers with diluted kahlua so that the sponge is moister. Last change I would make is to add more powdered sugar to the whipped cream to stablize--especially if you're making it in advance. Don't worry, it won't be too sweet.

I substituted cream cheese for the butter, immediately removed the springform ring (to use in another recipe), and this held together quite well. Not too sweet, easy to assemble and I will definitely make it again, possibly adapting to make a trifle. I think the addition of Kahlua would be great!

I made this for my brother's birthday and the only substitution I made was cream cheese for butter. It got DEVOURED and the presentation was phenomenal. The only trouble I had was when I melted the chocolate into the cream everything was going fine until I took it off the heat and suddenly all this oil rose to the top and the chocolate clumped up. I'm no sure what happened because it was 100% cacao baker's chocolate. I had to start over and the second time had no problems. To write on the cake I melted chocolate and filled a plastic baggie with it. I snipped the corner off and was able to write very nicely directly on the cake. Using the same technique I made chocolate swirls on wax paper and once they hardened was able to make a very festive cake. Yum!

This was really easy and very yummy. I followed the recipe without any changes. I found the ladyfingers at the local supermarket - I asked the bakery dept. for them. I think I needed 3 packages. Made this one day ahead for my book club and it was a hit.

Taste: Think tiramisu (I added espresso powder). Not out-of-this-world, but result-to-effort ratio may keep this one in my file. (And I LOVE anything close to tiramisu!) Hardest part of recipe is finding ladyfingers. Struck out in Atlanta-- used crispy kind instead and with squeeze bottle, drizzled cappucino liquer on them. It took ALL of 3 packages (each 7 oz!) to line pan, and make required layers. Recommend using smaller springform (in case filling doesn't come level w/ tops of fingers. Also, IMHO, recipe could stand to be re-organized. For example, line the sides of pan w/ fingers FIRST, then make the bottom crust (I broke into pieces and fit them in bottom). Also, pay attention to the portioning of the filling: fold cream into half of mix, then half that. For custard layer, I used 4 oz butter and 4 oz cream cheese, but wouldn't bother next time. And this may be why my filling didn't reach the top of the cake. It was a bit messy to serve even tho I set it out beforehand. Recommend making at least 1 day in advance w/ this type of finger. Topped w/ toasted chopped pepitas and pistachio instead of chocolate, just before serving.

I made this for a dear friend's bday celebration - a Mexican Fiesta - using the cream cheese substitute for the butter; subbed 6 oz Mexican chocolate for 4 oz semisweet, omitted the 1/4 cup sugar (Mexican chocolate has sugar in it), brushed the ladyfingers with Kahlua, and used the suggestion of tying a bow around the cake after removing the sides. Well to say everyone was wowwed is an understatement. Accolades flew around the room as guests licked their plates clean. Easy to prepare and great presentation, especially with the bow!

I have made this cake two times. The first time I followed the directions "as is", and I liked it, however I didn't quite like the butter. The second time I replaced the butter with an equal amount of cream cheese and was delighted at the results. The cream cheese provided the creamier texture that I desired. It's a great, quick, and easy dessert either way though!

Rating: 4
YUM! I took previous suggestions and generously brushed the spongy (not crisp) lady fingers with kahlua. Fabulous texture. Not too sweet or too rich. I added an extra dash of cinnamon to the chocolate mixture while it was melting. Topped with raspberries, which, in retrospect, I don't think it needed, but were good.

Rating: 3
So good. I'll definitely make this again, but will use better-quality chocolate next time. I couldn't find my springform pan, so ended up using a 10" cake pan instead. It didn't make any difference; this was the first dessert that disappeared at my boyfriend's birthday party. Easy and delicious!

This was very good. Took it to work for a pot luck, and it was devoured! Easy to make. The most challenging part was finding the ladyfingers!

Rating: 4
I altered the recipe slightly. I soaked the lady fingers in Kaluha (flat side down) and lined the bottom and the sides of the pan. I did not soak the lady fingers that are used in the center of the dessert....I didn't want it to be too overwhelming. It was wonderful. My boyfriend claimed it belonged in a restaurant. Also, it looks very impressive. I would highly recommend this dessert. I think I'm going to make it for Christmas or Thanksgiving.

I made this for my daughter's wedding shower and everyone RAVED about it! I doubled the recipe and took some of the hints from previous reviews. I used the spongy ladyfingers, drizzled with Kahlua. I also put fresh raspberries on the top. There was not a crumb left!

I combined this cake with orange flavors. Took a hint from other reviewers, soaked the ladyfingers in OJ. Then I sweetened and flavored the whipped cream with orange marmalade. All that was very good. But the chocolate filling is way too strong on chocolate and way too heavy and rich. It needs some kind of serious modification, perhaps lightening with whipped gelatine, perhaps less butter. Definitely less chocolate.

Rating: 2
This recipe makes a grand presentation. It came out beautifully, and all my guests raved about it. I, myself, thought it was very good, but not "to die for." The cake does need to sit at room temperature for a half-hour or so for the filling to soften. You get much better flavors that way. I also think that brushing the lady-fingers with some kind of coffee-flavored liquor is a good idea. It adds dimension to the final product. Would I make it again? Possibly. Oh, one other thought...take a wide ribbon and tie it around the outside with a nice bow. People go nuts.

I made this cake for our first Mexican Fiesta party. This was a good desert but not outstanding. I only had the crisp ladyfingers and this may have been part of the problem. The Italian grocer did not have the spongy ones. I did cover them in Kahula and added Kahula to the chocolate mixture and this really helped. If you only have the crisp ones really soaking the fingers would be recommended - maybe a Kahula/cream mixture? I did have one guest who devoured it as it was so I may try it again.

I've made this dish several times, but left out the cinnamon and added a couple tablespoons of raspberry liqueur. Also soaked the lady fingers in the liqueur and added two layers of raspberries on top of the lady finger layers. The dessert looks quite impressive with not much effort- and left overs are great too.

I love this recipe and have made it many times, always to rave reviews. I use the crispy, Italian style ladyfingers around the outside and the cake type ones on the bottom and in between, brushing both types with brandy or kahlua. I am considering experimenting with a lemon mousse filling and chambord brushed on the ladyfingers.

I made this one for my husband's 50th birthday party (Mexican theme, margarita contest etc.) It is a show stopper in appearance, but just ok in the flavor department compared to some other recipes on this site. I listened to the previous comments on dryness so put some kahlua in one of those plastic catsup/mustard bottles and drizzeled it on the ladyfingers (it was easy to control the amount added - I've overdone it before with the soaking technique. The filling just seemed a little spikey in flavor - maybe it was because I used Vietnam cinnamon from Penzey's and it was just too much. I think I'll tinker with the concept though because it was so easy to ring the springform with ladyfingers and make a great looking dessert.

Rating: 4
This is a simple, easy, elegant dessert. I put this together in an hour at 1AM to prepare for a last minute party. My guests raved about it. To reduce the dryness, one reviewer suggested dipping the lady fingers in expresso which I will do next time. Or maybe use a frozen pound cake which may not present as well but would taste very good.

I made this for a last minute request from my pastor for a special occasion dessert for Mother's Day/college graduation. It was easy to pull off at the last minute. I sprinkled the layered ladies fingers with espresso (be careful not to get coffee on the upright lady fingers that make up the edge because the color of the coffee really travels through the cake) I decorated the top with shaved chocolate, fresh strawberries and some chocolate hearts that I made a while back. It looked fabulous and my pastor said it was great. She's clergy so I don't think she is supposed to lie :-) I was a bit concerned after the fact that the lady fingers forming the edge may have stuck to the springform pan when it was unmolded. Next time I'll dust them lightly with powdered sugar before putting them in the pan.

This recipe is perfect for a non-baker who wants to impress others. It looks beautiful and tastes delicious. People asked where I bought it! This is a real complement for someone who NEVER makes dessert. Too avoid the concern about the lady fingers being dry, I drizzled a bit of cognac and coffee mixed together over the lady fingers on the bottom and in the middle of the cake. A bit of alcohol added I nice taste to the chocolate. Be careful not to soak the lady fingers too much or they become too mushy.

Rating: 3
Easy and delicious dessert. I agree with some of the previous reviewers in that I found the ladyfingers to be too dry, however, I intend to soak the 'center' fingers in liquor next time and will experiment with the outer ones. As it was, though, this was a great hits with my guest and was polished off within 10 minutes!.

Excellent recipe and a keeper! I did sit the ladyfingers in a pyrex dish and poured Kahlua liqueur over them. I then flipped them over, poured some, and soaked thoroughly before layering them in the dessert. I thought this might be too much, but it wasn't because it blended in with the other ingredients. I also added the cinnamon and allspice. Even my husband's fussy grandmother who never likes my food or cinnamon, ate it without knowing and asked for seconds!

Rating: 3
The only thing keeping me from giving this recipe 4 forks is the fact that the ladyfingers were too thick and too dry. I brushed them with Kahlua as others suggested but I guess I didn't use enough. I also thought the ladyfingers in the middle and on the sides were too thick. Next time I will cut them in half. My family loved the dessert but kept pushing the excess ladyfingers aside. Other than those two minor complaints, this dessert really was very good (especially the no-bake part!) The mousse was chocolatey and light without being too heavy for hot weather eating and the cinnamon in the cream was a nice touch. It even held up well for a 2 hour drive(with ice-packs).

This is a fabulous dessert. I drizzled the ladyfingers with a combination of strong coffee and dark rum and ended up with what might be called a kind of tiramisu/chocolate mousse hybrid. It was easy and extremely popular with guests of all ages.

Wonderful! And so easy! Everybody loved it, and several asked for the recipe. Luckily there was a little bit left, so I got to finish it for breakfast the next day! I didn't try the Kahlua suggestion this time (wasn't appropriate for the crowd), but will definitely try it next time.

Everyone enjoyed this cake -- the presentation was nice, and it was very rich and chocolatey. I brushed on Kalua, but wished I had used it more liberally - the lady fingers were a bit dry. I also tried added an additional layer -- but wouldn't do that again (a little bit too much cake, not enough filler). Also, I inadvertently bought the Italian "lady fingers" that are used in Tiramissou, and had to run out for the spongey grocery-store variety instead.

Rating: 2
I would try this again. The presentation is very nice, and it is simple to make. I might try a few changes, however; the filling was a little "too much", so I would probably add a thicker layer of ladyfingers in the middle and probably give it a good dose of Kahlua vs. a sprinkle. The lady fingers need some additional moisture. Might be fun to try this with white chocolate or two different flavored layers flavors--maybe poundcake instead of ladyfingers?? Tasted better the next night.

This recipe is great and easily adaptable. I have made this cake several times. A nice addition is to add raspberries, raspberry whipped cream, and use a raspberry coulis to soak the lady finger layers. It can also be done by eliminating the chocolate and replacing it with lemon flavoring. This makes a much lighter and refreshing dessert.

I made this dish for a mexican fiesta party. The lady fingers I bought were taller and thinner than what I think is the norm, they were all I could find after going to 4 stores. I had trouble getting them to stay when i assembled the sides. Even though I used the correct size spring form pan - I thought the chocolate filling was a bit "skimpy". I would make more filling next time. Yes, I would make it again. It was impressive looking and tasted delicious. I did take the advice of a previous reviewer and lightly sprinkle the lady fingers with Kahula - just perfect. Don't soak them though.
