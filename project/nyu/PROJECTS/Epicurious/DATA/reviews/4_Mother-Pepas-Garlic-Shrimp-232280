Soooo gooood! Just the recipe I have been seeking. I didn't have sherry so used dry white wine with a bit of vanilla extract added to it. My new go-to shrimp recipe.

Just finished this and YUM! I hate to admit it, but I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 EVO. Once the shrimp were cooked, transferred them to a warm bowl then sauteed fresh spinach in some of the remaining liquid. Regarding too much garlic?... will have to see what if I get any comments in the morning!

This is an easy, yet delicious recipe. I used 2 tbsp of garlic only because my husband doesn't like alot of garlic. I thought it was perfect. The amontillado sherry makes the recipe. Next time I might take another cooks' advice and add a dash of crushed red pepper. Try this one, it's a keeper.

This was fantastic and so easy! Based on earlier reviews I was concerned about the garlic level, but it ended up not being too much for me. Granted, I used a little less garlic (I was just cooking for myself, so probably half a tablespoon less) and added dried red pepper flakes, so that may have made the difference. After cooking the shrimp I spooned the remaining sauce over pasta, then sauteed some thinly sliced carrots, zucchini, and tomatoes in whatever was left in the pan and topped the pasta with that. A perfect meal!

wow this was great. i just got back from spain, and i had to cook for my stepdad's spanish class, and they loved it -- and more importantly i loved it. garlic and parsley -- such simple flavors, but so good. extremely garlicky... maybe next time a little less garlic, but who's to say that garlic is a bad thing.

Pretty easy to make, but it was missing something. We love this dish at restaurants, but it wasn't quite the same. Maybe we needed more garlic? Would butter have done it? Better olive oil? Garlic infused olive oil? It's always easy for me to overcook shrimp...so be careful!

Quick and delish. Added more garlic, sherry and olive oil. Served it with Mexican rice and beans.

This was super easy. I used fresh basil instead of parsley. And I couldn't find the sherry, so I used pale, dry sherry instead. I'd probably use more basil, I just grabbed a handful from the garden. It's perfect for a quick midweek dinner, but it's not super yummy enough for company.

Fantastic... but you better like garlic (alot!) Make extra sauce (just double the liquids & 50% more of the garlic) and with Angel Hair pasta it was terrific!

I've not yet made this recipe but I don't think I'm mistaken by saying if dried red chilli flakes are added with the oil / garlic etc, it wouold make Gambas Pil Pil which is lovely if you like a bit of heat....

Oh my. This is unbelievable gourmet food. I didn't change a thing. Double the sauce & it can be served on angel hair. If not, serve the crusty bread. So easy, so quick. And we are slurping our plates. A true treasure!

Very interesting and very tasty. I cut up a small loaf of baguette and toated it to use for dipping. I would make this one again.

Very, very easy, and delicious. If you prechop the garlic and parsley, you can quickly and easily make this when hosting guests. Looks and tastes buttery.

My parents are Spanish. I have had this dish many a holiday or just for a starter before dinner of something BBQ or something roasted. The subsitution of sherry for white wine is a great idea. I was able to find another dish to use the sherry I bought in Spain. Thanks again for a great dish. I enjoyed it as well as my friends.

For a richer flavour use butter instead of oil...
