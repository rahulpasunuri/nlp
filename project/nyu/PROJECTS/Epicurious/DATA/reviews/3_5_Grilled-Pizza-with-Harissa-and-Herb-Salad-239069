I have my own pizza dough recipe that I used (here's a hint, use hi glutein bread (very strong) flour for a chewy, crisp crust), and a recipe for Harissa dressing from Delia Smith. I happened to have some Edam slices, so topped with them and it all worked beautifully, baked on a pizza stone in the oven. I realise some may think that I didn't cook this recipe, but the basics are there, and the flavours are the same. The salad leaves on top work a lot better than I would have expected. I'll definitely do this again.

Not that great. I made the harissa sauce and it was VERY hot, and also quite salty. Maybe reduce hot sauce and salt 10 1/2.

Made this this past week. I used Trader Joe's prepared dough and it worked great. I cut the recipe in half and used the trader joe's dough, cut that in half, overall made two pizzas that were a bit bigger than they suggested, it worked perfectly. I couldn't find Harissa sauce so I improvised a bit based on their instructions. I used thai red chili paste, that wasn't supper-hot so I also added a bit of that red sauce they have in chinese restaurants. Overall that was a good substitute. I like spicy food so instead of using 1 teaspoon I used about 1 tablespoon of this sauce. Maybe pure Harissa is hotter. Overall, great stuff! The most important part is that this is a GREAT way to make crust. I am sure you can cook the crust this way and put whatever great toppings you want on there and it'd be great.
