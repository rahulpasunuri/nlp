Make a compound butter mixture and press onto the bone-in chicken breast then pour on the planko and press into the butter. I use a frying pan that can go into the oven. Anything from curry powder to sauted shallots work great! Keep the skin on, the butter seems to cling better to it.

This chicken was good, but the more one doctors it to individual taste, the better I think. I used a mixture of butter, egg, sesame oil and chili powder for the dip and in the panko I put flax seed just for the heck of it. I wish I had had sesame seeds, that would have been really good. I used strips of boneless, skinless chicken breast. This recipe is so basic and versatile, you can really do anything with it!

Easy and delicious. Feel free to be more adventurous about the spices.

It's good and pretty easy. Doesn't taste fried but it is a nice change to the chicken breast dinner we seem to have so often. I melted the butter and mixed in the s/p, and just dredged the chicken breasts in the butter, instead of brushing it on.

This was disappointing. Not bad but just not interesting.

I tried this one with boneless skinless breasts. It was wonderful. If yours came out dry then you probably cooked it a little too long. It only takes about 4-5 minutes on each side if you cook on top of the stove and not a whole lot longer in the oven at about 350-375. Depends on the thickness of the breasts. I found that when I pound the breasts down a bit, not paper thin but just flatten them out, rub oil all over, season to your taste, dredge in the Panko crumbs, place on either oiled foil or oiled pan and cook in the oven for about 15-20 minutes (again, depends on thickness) these come out scrumptious! Oh! You can also add a little Parmesan cheese to the breadcrumbs for a different taste treat too.

I do a version of my own and most people think it's better than fried. Quickest is to dip in a beaten egg and then dip in panko. If you have buttermilk around, marinate the chicken in that for a while, then dip in the panko. IMPORTANT: add your favorite seasonings to the egg or buttermilk, and to get it brown and crisp, spray it with a little olive or canola oil. I use thighs as they don't dry out like the breasts.

This wasn't bad. I mean, we liked it. And with some modification the 9 year old will like it sans pepper. I added some sage and rosemary and it was quite tasty. I might try using Old Bay seasoning next time.

the panko concept is great but you gotta flavor the chicken itself! I recommend seasoning the chicken with salt, black/white pepper, poultry seasoning, garlic powder, paprika, sometimes I add fresh rosemary & sage. Let the chicken absorb those herbs and spices THEN dip in butter and coat w/panko. Hope this helps :-)

Panko kept chicken moist and juicy (I used breasts only). Flavor was just ok. You should add your favorite herbs.

This was an incredible dish and so easy to make! I used chicken breasts and dipped them in butter rather than brushing it on. I was surprised how well the panko stuck to the chicken and how crunchy it was. The chicken was so juicy and flavorful. I will definitely be making this recipe again and again!

Not that impressed with this recipe. Although a healthier alternative to frying, it is just not a substitute. I did not get much browning on the panko crumbs even though they were crispy. If I were to try this again, I would brown the panko before coating the chicken.

A great easy dinner, excellent flavor and can be adjusted to taste. We added a little garlic and italian seasonings - a great winter dish, the house smeled wonderful. Fun to let kids shake in a bag.

We used boneless chicken and it turned out perfectly. We also flipped the chicken half way through baking and it turned out beautifully crisp and moist.

Excellent dish. I dipped the chicken in an egg/milk mixture. I also added rosemary to the egg mixture. This is a super easy recipe and good for a weeknight.

Easy but messy to make. I wouldn't make this again. The recipe called for more butter & panko than one small chicken required, and I found that although the panko crisped up nicely as it is meant to, it didn't have much flavour. I rated this 4/10.

This was quick and easy. I made it for two with two boneless chicken breasts and cut down the rest of the recipe accordingly. I didn't have Panko bread crumbs but italian seasoned ones worked well. I baked for 20 minutes at 400 degrees.

Excellent recipe !! I ate it cold a few days later it....tasted like cold fried chicken. I did add a little extra cayenne and salt- made sure I got a nice thick coating on it.

i tried this as an healthy alternative to frying chicken - however, even halving the butter didn't feel like it cut it down any. plus, the butter was hard to smear on the chicken. the chicken itself could use more flavor, and i'd recommend brining the chicken beforehand. the panko does crisp nicely, and i think this recipe has potential if you monkey around with it a little, but as it is, i would probably not make it again.

This dish was incredibly easy and fast to make. I used boneless breasts and very little butter and it still turned out tender and juicy inside and wonderfully cruchy outside. My oven runs a little hot so will try lowering the temp a few degrees next time. Love the idea posted by jennaddenda from Milwaukee and plan to try it with the buttermilk.

Having made biscuits already and being slightly fearful of the full stick of butter the recipe called for, I instead decided to soak the chicken pieces in buttermilk and added the cayenne, salt, and pepper to the panko crumbs with a few handfuls of dried sage and some dried parsley flakes. Chicken turned out tender and delicious.

I also used boneless breasts - then used tonkatsu sauce at the table and had a nice Japanese style meal with stir fried veggies and rice. Will definitely make it again

This was the biscuit!! I was tired beyond belief and had to make dinner for 2 teenage granddaughters and 4 adults. This was simple, quick and oh, so tasty. It should be on everyone's go to recipe list. I served it with a butternut squash risotto and salad, there was nothing left. Well done.

This is a very good and easy recipe. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used a hearty stone ground mustard instead of the butter to bind the spiced panko crumbs to the chicken. The left-overs made a delicious chicken salad the next day.

I used free range boneless chicken breasts, about 6 altogether. Took only about 25 minutes, turning half way through. Amazingly moist and delicious!

I thought that this dish delivered the crunch of fried chicken, but without the guilt of frying. I really liked the panko texture, but I think that you can add more spices other than cayenne. For pics and more details, visit: http://joleneeatshere.blogspot.com

I have made this but simply coated chicken in flour, then beaten egg, then crumbs, which is how I crumb food like snitzels and lamb cutlets. Always bake in oven as I am a lousy fryer.

I have tried this recipe several times after reading it in Gourmet. It is excellent and my 17 year old just can't get enough of it. I wasn't really happy with the cayenne flavor so I added some herbs and spices that I like to the butter mix and it came out even better.

Liked how easy this recipe was. It came out great. Only used 1/2 the butter.

Even the "Mr. Butterton" in my life thinks this variation of panko chicken is wonderful. I use skinless, boneless chicken breasts. Lightly spray frying pan with cooking spray, toast the panko until brown. Season with salt, pepper and any other favorite spices. Coat the chicken with fat free yogurt and roll in the toasted panko. Bake at 450 degrees for 15 minutes, or until done.

Prep stage was very messy. Almost impossible to get the softened butter to adhere, so the chicken pieces weren't evenly coated with the panko. However, my husband did say it was very good and he really liked the crunchiness. No complaints from the kids. BTW I used all thigh pieces.

Wouldn't even try making a recipe using this much butter. Talk about unhealthy for even the healthiest. Would do a lot of modifications and elimiate the butter altogether

I made it as is and added 3/4 cup of pulsed macadamia nuts to the panko mixture. The nutty flavor was added while none of the crispness was lost. A definite do over. Oh, and do serve it with the glazed carrots also on the most excellent epicurious.com

This is delicious, the panko breadcrumbs certainly make it crispy, I added some grated parmesan as well, really good.

I make similar recipe- only change- dip the chicken in dijon mustard (can dilute it with water if desired) before dipping in the panko... Adds great flavor. Good recipe for kids, picnics as great cold, easy to make ahead in large quantities.

I have used a variation of this recipe for a while now--using bone-in thighs, or boneless breasts, slivered into "fingers," depending upon my mood. I use whole wheat panko, which I think tastes way better than regular panko (and I am not a wheat bread fan...). I also use Penzey's Spices version of Italian Dressing mix, in place of the pepper. Sometimes, I'll use just regular Italian Herbs and salt/pepper. You don't have to use a whole stick of butter, either. I use half butter and half olive oil. Gives a great flavor. I bake on either parchment paper or aluminum foil on a jelly roll pan, for easy cleanup. Nice to see a simple recipe like this once in a while.

I lightened this up by using boneless skinless breasts, mixing 2T of melted butter in with the panko, and coating the chicken first in a little seasoned flour, then egg white, then the panko. I also used a full teaspoon of cayenne, and cut the baking time in half.

This one was a tough sell to the Poker Guys, even with the butter. It was an ok dish but just wasnt all that much. Way better ways to enjoy chicken and way healthier ways too. But some folks will like it because of the way it is cooked or baked. Just not a favorite with the Carnivours Maximus at this table.

Yeah, adding A STICK OF BUTTER to a tree limb would make it taste good too. "For those with a fear of frying" must not mean a fear of calories, because how could KFC not be any less caloric than adding 800 extra calories from fat. For those using boneless, skinless breasts, you're just kidding yourselves.

Very good! I sliced my pieces very small, and cooked only three breasts. I melted butter, and dumped the chicken in, and then threw it into the crumbs, and then carefully placed them in the pan. They came out delicious. I used crushed red pepper instead of Cayenne, but it was still good!

This is a really basic, simple way to make tender chicken. I used a thick layer of whole-wheat bread crumbs - not panko - and had a really nice result.

I loved this and will make this over and over again. It's the perfect update to the chicken dinner my Grandma made every Sunday. I am pretty intimidated by cooking in general and thought this was easy. I used rubber gloves to smear the butter on and press in the panko--worked like a charm.

There was no panko at trader joe's, so I used regular breadcrumbs, and that was a mistake. It was really not crispy at all, except in a couple small lucky spots. The chicken was very moist, which you would expect with all that butter. To avoid the butter seizing up as you try to spread it on the cold chicken, which it did for me, take the chicken out of the fridge while the butter softens. All in all, I don't think this was sigificantly easier than regular frying, at least for me. Nor is it any healthier with all that butter. But if I had small kids and wanted to avoid spattering oil or standing at the stove, I would do it with the panko as instructed, which I'm sure is a lot crispier.

Very simple very tasty. I upped the red pepper to give it a little more kick and I used boneless breasts and put them over homemade fried rice. Great meal to make and reheat.
