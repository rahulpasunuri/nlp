My little, last of the season, home-grown plum tomatoes were pretty well overdone by the time I pulled them out of the oven after 30 minutes. I suggest you don't go by the time, but go by how they look! I topped them off with a few crumbs of feta cheese and a bit of basil leaf - YUMMMY!! (So next time I'll watch them better.)

Oh, I forgot to add that 50 minutes was definitely way too much time and I had to start over a fresh. Roast them for 30 minutes at most!

OH MY GOODNESS. SO GOOD! I made these with a homemade pesto infused goat cheese and they were absolutely divine. The only negative comment I received from my guests was that I didn't make enough of them... next time I'll definitely make a double (maybe triple?) batch!

I'm surprised there aren't more reviews for this excellent appetizer! I made this in 07 for a holiday party and it was such a hit I made at least 4 batches that season. Just looking it up again for an upcoming party - these are great! goat cheese, boursin, pesto, greek yogurt w/herbs... try toppings and reort back - this is a GREAT APP!!

I *loved* this. It is a perfect recipe. Goat cheese is one of my favorite things of all time, and I was surprised to have it be a *bit* too much. The mozzarella let the roasted tomato have center stage. Though I will continue to use this with goat cheese, as well, to change things up a bit. I look forward to trying this dish with other tapenades, as other users have done--I only did the two cheeses, with a sprinkling of basil on top. Divine.

I've made this the past two weekends in a row for two separate parties. They go FAST! I used chopped basil the second time, but the green olive vesion has a nice tang if that is what you are looking for.

I probably drizzled too much olive oil on it, but I found these to be a bit messy (oily, soggy) to eat anyway. Maybe if I had some baguette slices to put them on it would have been better. It also could be that the store did not have plum tomatoes and I had to use roma tomatoes. Nevertheless all the ones with pesto & goat cheese were eventually eaten. The ones with tapenade and goat cheese were hardly touched. They were very easy to make and I would make this again as a snack for myself, except I would skip the fatty fillings and just eat the seasoned "grilled" tomatoes over baguette slices.

These little morsels were outstanding! I made them last night, and filled some with mozzarella marinated in herbed olive oil, some with kalamata olive paste, and some with these little white fish (gavros?) that are marinated in herbed oil. Then I drizzed a parsley oil/pesto sauce over the top. Absolutely delicious!

Made this last night as an appetizer and it was a huge hit. I roasted the tomatoes in the morning and then topped them just before serving. Did half with goat cheese and the other half with Trader Joe's Artichoke Antipasto. The artichoke topping was fabulous and the clear favorite. An easy appetizer that people loved.

So yummy! Made this to go with crabmeat stuffed shrimp and rosemary roasted new potatoes. Roasted them early in the day and just before serving put crumbled blue cheese on them and poppled them back in the oven for the cheese to melt and get gooey. Not a single tomato was left over.

This is an incredibly simple appetizer. Best with goat cheese - either plain or with chives.
