My meringues stuck to the foil. Life is too short to waste on recipes like this.

"She?" I was just looking for a recipe, but found that little bit of sexism interesting enough to butt in on about. Mahlzeit!

This is absolutely a keeper. I call it my "Oh My God" dessert. It takes a little time, but it is worth it. The review before my is correct in every thing she had to say. Bon Appetite!!

This recipe makes a spectacular dessert with wonderful contrasts of flavor, texture and color. If you are not proficient with a pastry bag you may need to practice, and be sure to pipe the meringue on rather thickly so the meringues don't break when you remove them from the foil hats. I learned this after making two batches, the first of which made tasty cookies after the shells crumbled! :-) This dessert is great for entertaining since the meringue shells or the entire dessert may be made ahead of time so you can have a stress free time with your guests. Make this dessert - you will love it.
