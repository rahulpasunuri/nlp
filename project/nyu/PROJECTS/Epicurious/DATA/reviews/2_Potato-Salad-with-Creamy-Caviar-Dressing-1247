This was not a bad recipe, just one that could be better. I recommend adding the caviar to the dressing at the very end so that it doesn't lose its integrity or color the dressing. Also, I feel that the amount of Belgium endive was a bit excessive for the amount of potatoes and other ingredients. I would halve the amount of endive. However the flavors of this dish was a perfect accompaniment to a chicken, walnut, green bean and goat cheese salad in a dijon vinaigrette.
