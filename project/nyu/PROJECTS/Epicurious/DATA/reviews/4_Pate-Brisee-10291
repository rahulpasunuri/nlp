Perfect Pate Brisee. I used all butter and had to add about 5T of ice water. It was pliable and sturdy when rolling and forming but delicate and flakey once baked. Yummy!

I don't usually make my own pie crust; always afraid I can't make it work. This came together instantly in the food processor, as per someone's suggestion. With a quick knead by head, it was ready to chill in the fridge within 5 minutes. It rolled out beautifully and tasted great.

This was the most wonderful apple pie I have ever eaten, creamy and delicious, but not too rich. My family as well!

This is a great pie crust, I've used it for years, and always have rave reviews. This recipe yields one pie crust. I have modified it several times, using only butter, or subbing one T of apple cider vinegar for one T of water. I also add 1 T of sugar.

Best crust I ever made. It always turns out flaky & very tasty. I use for pies & galettes as well as for savory, meat pies. I recently read an article in the NY Times that was talking about using similar proportions of butter & fat/70% butter to 30% lard(fat). It's important to let the crust rest in the refrigerator before rolling out. I also freeze it sometimes.

Really good pie crust! I made it to go with pumpkin pie so I wanted it a little sweeter--added 1/4 teaspoon of sugar with the salt. I pulsed the flour and fat together in the food processor and then hand mixed the ice water. And, I egg washed the crust before baking (very pretty appearance). My husband said it was the best pie crust he had ever had!

does this make a single or double crust pie?

I've made this recipe for many years and it always tastes wonderful. Depending on the weather, it is sometimes tempermental. I make it in the food processor and then let it rest for at least an hour in the refrigerator. The dough also freezes well. Thaw in the refrigerator before rolling out.

This recipe was recommended to be used with a pie on the Martha Stewart web site. We followed the directions specifically. The stuff just split apart when we tried to role it out, and fell apart when we tried to put it in the pie pan. Even trying to patch it together didn't work. We just pitched it in the garbage and used regular pie crust. As you can guess, we would not use this again on a bet.

to answer the question of the cook from stratham, nh, this recipe is intended for the POTATO SAMOSA TARTLETS also found at epicurious. i imagine it would have other uses in other recipes as well.

I don't understand the point of this recipe - to eat straight lard ??

Could you be more precise with your measures as I live in France and do not know how much is a stick of butter. Thanks!

This recipe works like a charm, at least it did for me. Soft, easy to roll out and delicious. What more do you need?
