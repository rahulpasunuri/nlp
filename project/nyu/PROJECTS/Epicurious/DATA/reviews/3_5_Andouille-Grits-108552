This is incredibly easy, and when combined with fried eggs and sauteed spinach delivered a dish my husband said deserves "five forks." Okay, so his palate is a bit simplistic, geared toward things he doesn't have to cut up or chew. Still, I liked it too, despite those factors, and I loved how easy it was to make after a long day in the kitchen doing other things ahead of Christmas. So I'm going to put it in my mental file of "tasty things to make without any work."

Prepared this dish with the New Orleans Grilled Shrimp. What a meal! We felt as though we were having dinner in the Big Easy! As a previous reviewer had mentioned, we also had leftovers for breakfast.

My husband and I loved this! Excellent as part of a New Orleans dinner menu, and great as breakfast leftovers the next morning. Easy and delicious.

Chose this recipe because I had all the ingredients and also, it was not time-consuming. Used Amy-Lu Chicken Andouille sauage, which I always seem to have on hand. Even used home-made chix broth. The recipe serves four, but the two of devoured it and two eggs each. Only change I made was to stir in about 1/4 c of cheddar cheese.

If you like sausage and you like grits, then you will LOVE this recipe. If you are preparing ahead of time, I would suggest following the recommendation to thin with additional broth. That way, it will not get too dry when reheated in the oven. Super easy, super tasty!

Very good, albeit rich dish. My husband said I could make this for him anytime. I think a key is finding really good andouille. Too often, andouille is far too fatty. Can't wait to make again (and maybe cut down on the butter)

I tried this recipe for a different take on grits and sausage for breakfast. My, did the family love it. If you want a quick dinner, it works good also with a spinach side dish.
