This is an outstanding recipe. I made it for an Easter brunch and everyone loved it. I followed the recipe exactly and will add this to my keeper list.

Turned out great! The grits really give it a nice density. I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, so I tweeked it. Used fennel instead of leeks. Used the fennel greens in place of green onions. Used a blend of chedder and jack and added a can of diced green chilis. I think it would be even better if I had used all the different onions the recipe calls for. My bag of grits didn't say quick cooking, but they seemed to work just fine.

This soufflé was absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe to the letter with one small variation: I baked the soufflé in a 1.6 liter soufflé dish, cooked it for the recommended time, and it came out beautifully! It was a huge hit with my husband and children, even my picky eater! Served it as a light lunch with bread and salad - clean plates all around! I disagree with some other reviewers that the cheese was lost in this. To the contrary, we found the slight heat of the pepperjack to be discernibly noticeable without being overwhelming. Very impressed with this recipe.

To open up a new thought for others who love cheesey grits souffles all the time, not just special occasions: I make single or double servings in the microwave. First cook the grits (real stone-ground, yellow or hominy, not that 'quick' nonsense) on 50% power for about 10 minutes in a covered but vented MW-safe container - should be a 3-cup container for a single serving (1/4 c grits and 1 1/4 c milk or water). Let sit 5 minutes. Stir and cook more (add a bit more water) if needed. Shouldn't be crunchy but should still be a little firm. Then stir in cheese, onion if using, and unbeaten egg white - I don't use yolk. MW on high for 3-4 minutes til set. It isn't as elegant as the oven-baked version, but it's a lot less labor intensive and hits the spot for a quick breakfast or lunch. You could even pass it briefly under a hot broiler if you want the brown top.

Loved it & will definitely make again. Cheese on top got a bit too brown; will add last 10 mins next time. Not a fan of instant grits; will probably make with leftover stone ground yellow grits next time. Makes 6-8 side dish servings.

This is excellent! I have made it twice & like others I used cheddar, because I had it. I made it in small ramekins & 1 large ramekin (from another reviewer & I cooked it for 30 min like she suggested) & it turned out great. It's my mom's new fav dish!

I added shrimp, very good.

I used cheddar instead, because I had some. Did use all 3 onion types, more leeks than yellow onions. Everyone loved it. I have to agree with others though that the grits make it a little denser. I would have given 3 1/2 for that, but no one else at my table felt that way. Great side, esp with a vegetarian in the mix. Would make a nice brunch dish or light supper with a loaf of french bread and salad.

This was a huge hit for Easter dinner alongside roast pork and spring vegetables. I baked it in an 8x8 dish for 22 minutes and it was perfect. I might use a more assertive cheese - even the pepper Jack got a little lost in this dish.

I agree with all other reviews: it is a simple and delicious recipe! I made some changes that may had affected a little bit, but it turned out well. I baked in one souffle dish instead and used the regular grits. I had to simmer longer and baked for about 25 minutes and even if was a beautiful brown on the top, after I served, I could tell it would be better to bake it a little long, only about 5 minutes. The grits separated from the onions and remained on the bottom. I don't know if this is suppose to happen but it was great! I didn't find a grated monterey jack with hot pepper so I bought a piece and shredded. I don't know if was the brand that I bought but at the end I couldn't taste any pepper. It was not spice or hot at all. What for me is great, but for my husband was a little frustrating.

Made as a side dish and it was a huge hit. I used more leeks and no regular onions. Taste was excellent. It was a bit denser than a regular soufflé, but that was to be expected with the grits and that made it an interesting variation on the traditional preparation.

I used 1.5 cups of chopped yellow onion since I didn't have any leeks and left out the scallions since I was out of them. This was a good souffle and I have to give it three forks for its own merit, but this recipe made me realize that I really adore the fluffiness of a souffle that does not include grits. The grits made this fairly heavy, although the souffles did rise tremendously. I used 9 3/4 cup ramekins filled to the rim and at 18 minutes they were probably 2 inches above the rim of the dishes. The presentations was beautiful although the grits made them a bit too dense for my taste and I felt the flavor could have been more complex (perhaps with some herbs). I might make this again but I think I prefer my grits on the side.

Very easy and tasty. A traditional French dish that goes very nicely with the menu. I can't believe someone would go to the trouble to not even MAKE the recipe, but demonstrate her outstanding ignorance by criticizing the spelling of a FRENCH word. Vraiment madame, comme vous etes conne. (sorry, no accents on this computer!!!)

Surprisingly light. I halved the recipe for my husband and myself and threw in some chopped jalapenos.

This was a huge hit! Special breakfast party and everyone loved it. The only thing I did different from the recipe is that I used a french truffle cheese and added mushrooms sauted in truffle/olive oil. SPECTACULAR!

So I did all I could to mess this one up. I had a beautiful rise on the souffle, but I used a loaf pan and this is where I think I went wrong. I opulled it out after 20 minutes and it was still raw in the middle. Pulled it out after 5 more mins, still raw. So, 30 minutes is what I am going to do next time. However, my souffle rose yet again and it was scrumptious. LOVE THIS!!!

Best recipe I've found in a long time. I believe it is important not to overbeat the egg whites. Could cause the dryness other complained about. I use the leeks, the onion and the green onions. The flavor is great and even better left over. I've already made it 3 times in the last month. It's the ultimate in comfort food.

Easy, quick and yummy. I made it twice and came out great both times.

I didn't have any leeks, so I used a mix of onions, bell peppers, garlic and one chilli, though it came out a bit bland so I would probably add a few more chillis next time. Overall it was good, and looked nice on the breakfast table-- I baked it in a large souffle dish rather than individual small ones, and adjusted the temperature to 400 degrees for 20 minutes which seemed adequate. Would definitely make this again, especially when having friends over for breakfast.

This was a easy and tasty recipe. My husband loved it. I used 8 oz of cheese, because we love cheese. We love onions, so I didn't adjust as other cooks did. It was great! I cooked the grits for 30 sec longer. I will make these again for a brunch.

very tasty as was, but i had to use smaller souffle dishes and may have overcooked them, as they were a little dry. next time i would add more cheese, maybe some fresh jalapenos to bring up the spice a little, and some bacon bits

Fantastic recipe. I woudl go a little lighter on the onion for my personal taste. This is a sure way to impress at breakfast.

Fantastic flavor and fire. I used 7ozs of cheese creating a wonderful creamy taste but otherwise cooked as described in the recipie.

Omit the leeks, double green onions and it's a great southern dish. Don't let the grits get to thick before baking.

I omitted the onion, and the leek and green onion provided plenty of flavor. I also cooked the souffle in one dish, baking for about 25 minutes. Sauteed some shrimp and prosciutto to serve alongside. Excellent!

Have made this twice now and we all love it.Don't overcook grits. Served with a tex-mex omelet for brunch, then as a side for bacon-wrapped grilled shrimp. A KEEPER.

Hmm.....flavors were pretty good, but my souffles turned out dry. My oven maybe? Won't try again.
