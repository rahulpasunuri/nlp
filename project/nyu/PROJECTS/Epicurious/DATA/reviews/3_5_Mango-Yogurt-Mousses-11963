I changed the recipe to use only yogurt and left out the heavy cream. That made it easier as there was no need to whip anything so this is literally done in minutes. I don't have powder gelatin so I used one sheet and that was not enough. I might try two sheets next time. I loved the flavour; it was nice and fresh but that's also probably because I used only (Greek) yogurt

This was so disappointing. The amount of dairy really lost the tang and flavor of the mango. I used a few fresh mangos for the puree and I wished I had saved them for a recipe that brought out their flavor. The cream, etc. just overshadowed it. It basically tastes like mango whipped cream...not bad but not what I was expecting.

My husband loves mango's, so I thought he would probably love this recipe. Maybe he's just not a "moussey" type of guy, but he thought it was just okay. My daughter took one bite and said it was good, but didn't want any more. My 20 month old however couldn't get enough of it! I don't know. My husand just said is was kind of bland, like it needed a stronger mango taste in it or something. I personally thought it tasted better before the chilling for 4 hours...strange. Not a favorite unfortunetly.

Yummy. Soo good. hard not to eat it out of the mixing bowl without bothering to let it set!! Really quick and easy, too. Could probably be made with any fresh fruit; i think i'll try strawberries next.

Easy and excellent recipe. I just made this for the second time today since it met with such good reviews from guests last weekend. I agree with other reviewers who said that this makes 6 servings. Also, I serve it with homemade mango puree on top. The puree adds a nice color/texture contrast. Also, I added a bit more mango puree to the original recipe since I thought it was a little heavy on the dairy the first go around. But, that might have been since I used UHT cream - don't know if that makes a difference.

Had this over the weekend. Wow! It was delicious. And, like a few others who have posted here, in order to make it more heart healthy, we skipped the heavy cream and used Balkan yogurt along with the other plain yogurt and it was still totally satisfying, creamy and awesome! Plus, it took even less time to make since no beating involved. Mixed it all by hand. Highly recommend. We ate it plain, but to serve at a party, I'd top with berries, such as raspberries, blueberries or strawberries and a spoonful of whipped cream!

I did modify the recipe a bit -- in order to make it more healthful, I subbed each of the yogurt and cream with 1 cup nonfat Greek yogurt. Followed the rest of the recipe as written, topped with passion fruit seeds and served with double ginger shortbread from this site -- divine, and not too bad for you.

This was DELICIOUS when I made it last night. It made a huge amount--even though I only had 1-1/2 cups of mango "puree" and a scant cup of yogurt. Served it in 4 decorative 8 oz. water glasses, and I had no place to garnish the dessert, except to place slices of mango around the base of the glasses, so I skipped it. We like our desserts with a bit of texture, so I only smashed 2 very ripe mangos with a fork to make a semi-puree. Used a hand-held electric beater to beat the mango "puree", sugar, vanilla, and gelatin. The real problem I had was trying to whip my ultra-pasteurized heavy whipping cream: I had chilled everything in the freezer, but after about 10 minutes of beating the cream, it only had soft peaks and was at room temperature (I AM AMAZED IT DIDNT MAKE BUTTER). So I returned it (and the beater bars) to the freezer for about 15 minutes. When I tried to beat it again, I remembered a tip my Mom had given me about 45 years ago: add some sugar when you get to the soft peak stage. I used a couple sprinkles of sugar, and it immediately firmed up. (The point of all this is, that if you cannot get your cream to the firm peak stage, add some sugar.)

my all-time favorite recipe since May 1991 when i first discovered it. i add a little more sugar, serve in wine glasses, decorate with whipped cream and crushed pistachios, and make a day ahead. to make it even easier, i use tinned mango puree, available at all Indian stores. being the wife of a diplomat, i regularly have dinners at home and this is practically my signature recipe. the egg-free dessert is always a major hit, with polite guests scraping the sides of the bowl!

So easy and delicious. I served this with molasses cookies and they complemented each other very well.

I added the zest of an orange to the mousse. I also alternated diced mango (marinated in 1 T Cointreau) in a martini glass with the mousse, and topped with finely chopped pistachios for garnish.

I made this for company at a summer supper (the main course was Island Pork Tenderloin Salad, from this site), and it was heartily enjoyed. I served in small glass dessert dishes on plates garnished with slices of mango, blackberries and strawberries. I put a dollop of whipped cream on top of the mousses before serving. Wonderful, light and refreshing!

This is sooo good. It serves at least 6, though. I love sweets, but I could only eat about 1/2 cup at a time - or less. I put it in a 9X9 baking dish and ate it throughout the week. I used canned mango puree (can't count on good, ripe mangos all year 'round in the US) and low-fat Greek yoghurt, which is very thick. Because the puree was sweetened, I might cut back on the sugar a bit next time. I might try adding a smidgen of ground cardamom next time, although it doesn't need anything. I also didn't use any fresh mango slices for garnish. Trust me, when your guests taste this, they won't care if it's being served in a paper bowl with a plastic spoon. Actually, that's how I served it to my cousin last night and I thought she was going to melt onto the floor.

Excellent. Super-easy, light, flavorful. My kids couldn't get enough! When served in pretty individual dishes you can make an elegant presentation with fresh mango slices and other garnish.

Wonderful! Served at several dinner parties with great success. The recipe is always requested. Be sure to use very ripe mangos, preferably the less stringy variety. I add 1/2 tsp of corossol essence to bring out the flavor of the mango. I also like to slice mango and alternate layers of fresh mango with the mousse in a clear dish.

OMG!! This was amazing! I just chilledthe mousse in a bowl, stirred it up when set, and filled miniature phyllo shells with it. I topped each with a (pre-made) chocolate leaf. I served them at an open house and they flew off the trays.

I think this would only really work with very ripe and sweet mangoes. The fruit I had was off season, not very flavourful. I found the finished mousse to be somewhat bland- though the texture was very good.

Very light recipe. Excellent for warm day. Very easy to make and bullet proof. It was a huge hit with everyone that tried it.

I feel like I am the only one who ever had this problem - but I have it every time I try to add warm dissolved gelatin to anything semi-cold (such as mango puree here, or yogurt in another recipe on this site), and the second the gelatin hits the other substance, it congeals!!! And what I end up getting is a nice tasting mango puree with cream and yogurt mixed in, with bits of congealed gelatin throughout! I am never able to get it to blend in well enough to solidify the mixture. That being said, I do love this recipe and wish I could do it right next time - the taste is excellent and makes for a nice light dessert. Any suggestions!?

In an effort to reduce the caloric content, I used non-fat yogurt and Splenda in place of the sugar. With the richness of the whippping cream, my husband didn't even notice the substitutions. He's been enjoying a serving of this every night after dinner (recipe made six generous helpings).

perfect - refreshing and not too rich. i don't know why people are cutting the sugar, 1/3 cup was not overly sweet but i do like the idea of layering it with sponge cake - will try that next time. a lovely color, smooth texture and clean taste.

During mango season, this is a light & refreshing way to easily whip up a concoction for all those leftover mangoes!!

This is a great, easy, and delicious way to use mangoes! I bought a whole box and then didn't know what to do with them. I left out the sugar and substituted Cool Whip (gasp! I know!) for the cream. That cut back on the fat dramatically. Will definitely make again -- the next time I accidentally buy too many mangoes!

Between this and the Mango Fools with Chocolate-Anise Straws (on this site too), I prefer the latter. I guess that's because Mango Fools uses cream entirely instead of a combination of yogurt-cream. To perk up the taste, I crumbled shortbread cookies as "crust" at the bottom of the custard cups and then drizzled some mascerated raspberries before serving them. Not bad.

I bought a lot of mangoes and I was looking for a good mango recipes. This is so easy to prepare and the best mango dessert!! I made a mango syrup and pour it over the mousses instead of adding full amount of sugar in mousse.

This dessert is an absolute hit every time I make it. I always use the store-bought mango puree (sun-ripened Kesar mango - much tastier than our window-ripened variety!)and halve the sugar. I have also poured it between layers of mango sponge cake(topped with purple violets it looks really stunning).

Just came across this recipe. I love mangoes and will definitely give it a try this weekend. I have a suggestion - mangoes go very well with cardamom, much better than with vanilla. So you can try to substitute vanilla in this recipe with ground seeds from 3-4 cardamoms. Also, if you decide to buy mango pulp from Indian stores (definitely tastes better than fresh puree), buy the 'Kesar' mango pulp, which is tastier than 'alphonso' mango pulp.

This dessert is really refreshing. I try to take Mango Yoghurt to work everyday, but it is sometimes very hard to find in our supermarket. Now I can make my own. I did double the recipe and I used a tin of Mango to make up the second quantity. I will be using this recipe over and over again. A real winner.

I have been making this mousse for years- it's a great recipe.The mousse is beautiful served in pretty goblets, but is also firm enough to use in charlottes or for a mousse cake set in a ring. I save myself a lot of trouble by using canned mango puree, available at Indian groceries. Since the puree is sweetened, I reduce the sugar in the recipe by half.Often the flavor of the puree is better than fresh, depending on the time of year.
