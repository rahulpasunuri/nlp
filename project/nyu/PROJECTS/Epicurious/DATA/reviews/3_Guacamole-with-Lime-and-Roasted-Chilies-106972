My husband's favorite guac. recipe! Love that it doesn't have any of that sour cream or fillers in it. You should taste it while making it to keep it from having too much lime, just add to your taste.

Made it for a Fourth of July party and got rave reviews! I used frozen green chiles and fresh (un-roasted jalapenos). I thought I could get away without using the food processor for the guacamole part (to make a chunkier guac), but ended up with a bigger mess until I used the processor. You could use a blender too. My husband (and guests) said it was great and in fact, the chile mixture would be great on it's own, as well. Will definitely make again!

What did I do wrong? I made this for a dinner party and it was terrible. It was far to spicy and I love spicy! It also tasted heavily of lime. I felt the lime over powered the avocado. I ended up pouring everything in the food processor and adding another avocado. It made it edible but, not great. I need help! Please pass on a better guac. recipe for me. I have a huge avocado tree in my backyard that is calling me to make guacamole.

delightful! I make guac all the time, and this one is very similar to my own recipe...I added ground pasilla "powder" and 4 strips of sauteed bacon, cut in thin strips, plus the bacon grease. sounds like a lot, but it really cuts into the acidity of the lime. serve with corn torillas, cut into thin strips and roasted in oven with olive oil and salt. i also add a handful of grape tomatoes, seeded and minced and a bit of red onion.

I made this guacamole for friends and we were eating it for 5 days. It actually held up quite well for having fresh avocados in it. The flavor is good but I've made other guacamoles that I like better (like the one with tomatillas on this site). I like trying new recipes and this one was worth a try.
