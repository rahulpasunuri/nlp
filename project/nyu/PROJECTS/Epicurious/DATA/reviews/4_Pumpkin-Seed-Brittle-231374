The general recipe is very good. I would have given 4 stars if the author had been more accurate in their time estimates and more descriptive as to what's happening when...otherwise, a wonderful recipe! I pan roasted my seeds first in 1 tbsp of canola with sea salt... It took 7-8 minutes to reach 238F on low-med heat, and about 7-8 minutes after adding the seeds and reheating to begin to become grainy, and another 7-10 to caramelize...which happens quickly...I sprinkled some sea coarse salt on the cooling brittle, and then began to cut it a minute later...you're scoring it really...It's incredibly hot, so put it on something that can take the heat. I shifted mine to oven racks(parchment paper worked fine for me, but you'll need to add another sheet underneath after scoring it if you plan to transfer it).

This is more for a chard of decoration on a dessert. Not really tasty enough to eat as candy in my opinion. I wish I hadn't doubled it as I ended up throwing it away. It doesn't keep in tupperware overnight. It got sticky.

After much reading of reviews and deep-thinking the chemistry of sugar, here's my contribution. It worked perfectly and was very pleasing to both eye and palate. 1 cup sugar; 1/4 cup water; 1/4 cup light corn syrup; 3/4 tsp. fine sea salt, divided; 3/4 cup raw green (hulled) pumpkin seeds; 1/4 cup sesame seeds; cayenne, pasilla chile powder, cinnamon to taste. Toast the seeds in a heavy cast iron skillet with a very small amount of oil ... maybe 1/2 a tablespoon. Season them with 1/2 tsp. fine sea salt plus remaining spices to taste. I found it took well over 1/2 teaspoon EACH cayenne and pasilla chile to get to medium warm in terms of spice profile, and somewhat less cinnamon to add a note of complexity.. Keep in mind you're going to mix the whole business with hot caramel, so you need a bolder profile than you might otherwise go for. When pleasantly toasted (but not burnt) remove from hot pan to stop the cooking promptly. I put them on a flexible cutting mat because it's easy to funnel the seeds into the caramel later. Mix the sugar, water, corn syrup and remaining 1/4 tsp. salt in a 2 quart heavy saucepan just until blended. Cook over moderate heat until it turns the shade of caramel you prefer. Stop before it gets too dark or it might taste burnt. Be patient. Don't stir it, although you can swirl it in the pan occasionally if you need something to do. Watch it carefully as it darkens more quickly toward the end. When ready take the pot off the flame, and stir the seeds into the caramel quickly, as it will start to set very fast. Pour out onto a Silpat lined baking sheet and quickly spread with a high-heat silicone spatula so the mass achieves an even thickness. Allow to cool thoroughly, peel off the Silpat, and break between sheets of parchment by hitting it with your rolling pin or kitchen hammer. The recipe doubles well. Not brave enough to triple as the mass would be hard to control.

Read the reviews...THANK YOU prior reviewers as I would have tossed this in the garbage thinking I had done it wrong. 2 major points to know: A) PRACTICE PATIENCE; B) less is more. I tripled the recipe, but only used a 5-qt pan. Based on depth, it took FOREVER. Took about 20 minutes to get to soft boil. Then when I hit the sandy mess once back on the heat, I was absolutely positive I had messed it up, but as I had nothing to lose, I kept it on the heat. After close to 1 1/2 hours, it did indeed remelt. It is delicious BUT I had way too much to roll out thin quickly, thus a thick yummy brittle. Lesson learned. Next time, I would only double the recipe and at that, I will use my heavy duty 8-qt saucepan so thin layer with even heat distribution, thus faster cooking.

These really look good. I am going to make these this weekend.

I doubled the recipe and added extra pumpkin seeds (2 cups instead of 1.5 cups). While it was cooking it didn't look like there would be enough caramel for all those seeds, but the end result was a super delicious, high seed density brittle that my friends and I could not stop eating! It does take longer than 4 minutes for the sugar to melt again, as noted by other reviewers, but aside from all that stirring this recipe was quite easy. Be sure to let the brittle cool before peeling off the parchment paper; the first time we made this we ended up losing a lot to the paper pulling it off prematurely. I will definitely make this again and again.

This was a big hit at Thanksgiving and decided to make it again for Christmas. As other reviewers state, it takes longer than what is written, and is a bit of a process, but it is well worth it. Everyone loved it. I didn't have a candy thermometer, but was still able to make it successfully. I added a pinch of cayenne pepper and cinnamon like others suggested as well.

This is an adventure without a candy thermometer. (I broke mine during the process.) However, the brittle turned out excellent. The dry, grainy stage does last a lot longer than the recipe states. Persevere past that and you will have success. I doubled the batch and it worked well. I only had one Silpat, and it was a lot easier to use than the parchment, which I used for the other batch. Good luck.

This was AWESOME!! I blistered my hand stirring (my skin is sensitive!), but it was so worth it!! I added a little cinnamon and cake spice and ginger, but the flavor was delish! I TOO thought I ruined it when after 4 minutes of stirring after adding the seeds...it completely when to sugar...but then I kept stirring and after another 5 minutes, it caramelized again. Don't give up at the end!! It took 10-12 minutes, but the end result was fantastic! This may be a new staple in our home since my son had food allergies to nuts, milk and egg. He LOVES this:)

Here's what I did, and it turned out awesome: Pre-toast the 3/4 cup seeds in a skillet with a little oil over med-low heat, then toss in 1/2 tsp sea salt and 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper. Cook the sugar, water, and salt, stirring until dissolved, then let it sit over medium heat until it turns golden brown (not too dark or it will taste burned). Remove from the heat and stir in the seeds, then spread over a silpat and let cool. Break into pieces and enjoy! I also recommend doubling the recipe, as this alone doesn't make very much.

I made the modifications in proportion that another reviewer made, and I doubled it-- 3 cups sugar, 1 1/3 cup water, 2 cups pumpkin seeds, plus salt, a bit of cinnamon, cayenne, and just a pinch of orange zest. I was glad to have the information that the mixture would become grainy again, and that it would take significantly longer to caramelize, because I had made hazelnut brittle for Christmas, and thinking that I had ruined it when it got grainy, turned it out into candy clusters... and this time, while waiting for the mixture to really melt, I thought I'd burnt it. (I used unbleached evaporated cane crystals, so it was pretty dark the whole time.) As apprehensive as I was about this whole endeavor, I am thrilled to say that it came out perfect. The cinnamon, cayenne, and orange were totally lost in the deep molasses-like flavor of the brittle itself, but that's ok. I could always increase that from pinches to dashes next time, if I wanted a more unique flavor, but this is pretty amazing as is. Be patient with this one, and be CAREFUL. I used my dehydrator sheets, having neither parchment nor silpats, and you know what? As solid as they look, they're apparently mesh. Oops. Hot melted sugar seeped through the pores (only in one spot, thankfully), and I now have a beautiful little blister. The sheets peeled off nicely, however, and the candy that stuck to the top layer would be great for a lighter garnish to a flan, pots de creme, or other spoon dessert. Make this, love it, and pass it on!

First off, I am so glad I read the reviews before attempting this. I'm a professional pastry chef, and I definitely would have thrown this out had I not read the reviews first. I doubled the recipe, and the remelting/caramelizing phase took me at least 20 minutes...probably longer. The end result was delicious and beautiful! I used a silpat instead of parchment, and I would definitely recommend this to everyone.

After reading all the other comments, I increased the sugar to 1-1/2 cups and water to 2/3 cups and used 1 cup pumpkinseeds. Since my pumpkinseeds were already toasted, I just spread them out single layer on the prepared pan and poured the candy over them. That meant I didn't have to go through the whole crystallization/re-melting process -- just waited until it was mahogany brown, much easier! I also added a little cinnamon. Turned out delicious. Makes a lovely garnish to the Thanksgiving pumpkin pie!

I consider myself a really experienced cook (went to culinary school and everything) but this was a very challenging recipe. First of all, people, use a Silpat or other silicon baking mat, and not parchment paper. Makes your life so much easier. Second, use fewer pumpkin seeds. I would recommend just 1/2 cup. Third, other reviewers are absolutely right and this recipe takes far longer after you stir in the pumpkin seeds than the recipe indicates. Don't give up on this one though. Get past the grainy mixture that makes you want to flush it down the drain and start over and keep it on the heat. The result is a pretty delicious and unique brittle that will surprise you and your guests.

This is good, but I only gave it 3 forks because the directions were a little faulty. The sugar took a lot longer to caramelize than the four to five minutes the recipe suggests. I think for me it was closer to 12, maybe 13 minutes once it was back on the heat. This brittle is mostly seeds--which is fine, but means it's not the recipe to use if you want a higher ratio of candy to seeds. (The seeds pretty much all touch each other once the brittle is rolled out.) I will make it again, but next time I'll allow a lot more time.

What a mess - I followed this recipe and took the mixture off the heat to add the pumpkin seeds. 10 minutes later I still have a grainy mess. Not certain taking it off the heat is a good idea. Disappointing. Big mess in my pot to clean up and nothing to show for it!

I forgot to mention in my review that I used a silpat, which eliminated the need for taping down a piece of parchment. Silpat is reusable and works great for making candies.

Simple, quick, and delicious. Instead of making strips, which looked like they may be difficult to break cleanly, I made small squares. I'd like to coat them next time in some dark chocolate to make them even more special.

This is quick and really easy to make. I agree that the second part if the recipe takes longer, more like 10-12 minutes to caramelize, but I did double the recipe like another user. I think you could even double the sea salt, as I like the combo of sweet and salty very much. My girlfriend and I made this for our kids class Halloween parties and it was perfect! I did, however, learn the CRUCIAL difference between waxed and parchment paper! May I also recommend lining your countertop with a few layers of newspaper before using a pizza cutter to cut through the brittle. I will definitely make this again for gifts and parties!

Came out great! The candy:pumpkin seed ratio is a little low; I would use fewer seeds next time. Also, the timing for each of the steps in the recipe is totally off, but just wait for the temp, crystallization, and caramelization, and you'll be fine. I added a tiny bit of cayenne pepper for an awesome bite.

This recipe came out wonderful. It took a couple of attempts to figure it out, but once I did it went really easy. My first attempt I tried it with the raw pumpkin seed(pepitas) However I did not have the time to get each individual seed out of the shell. My second attmept i tried it with raw pumpkin seeds with the shell...that didnt work. I live on an Island and could not find raw seeds hulled, but found already roasted seeds. This worked perfectly. I omitted the salt and carmelized the mix at a lower temperature to avoid burning. This is definitely a time consuming project if making a big batch, but well worth it.

i had never made any candies/syrups before so this was a new experience for me! i just made this today, i followed the directions but did not have a temperature gauge.... i boiled the syrup for 10 mins exactly and it was not enough, i speant like 2 hrs trying to figure how to make the sugar crystalize, i kept taking it off the heat and then putting it back on, the deal is it just wasn't cooked enough. Once i thought it was ruined was actually the turning point when it was carmalizing! Also i didn't have a rolling pin, i just used pans and my hands, i would not recomend this! i burned my hand twice! So, determined (also it doesn't make a TON of brittle, and i wanted more) i went to target and got the temp gauge and a rolling pin. The second batch was perfect and i am so thrilled! And this is my new holiday tradition. My mom printed this out for me.. so thanks mom!

I have made this twice this autumn. It is easy and looks beautiful. This was my first brittle/sugar syrup staging adventure and the directions are very clear and easy to follow.

It tastes wonderful! This was my first time making brittle, and I was impressed. The second part of the recipe took twice as long as recommended--about 12 mins. I rolled it out, but the parchment paper stuck to the brittle, preventing me from cutting it into strips. It's a great visual on the table!

I'm glad the recipe stated that the "sugar will continue to dry and become grainy before melting". Still, I didn't expect it to become so sandy--looked like a disaster (I've never made brittle before, maybe this is normal). Finally it re-melted then started to carmelize. Pour quickly onto the parchment and don't worry about getting it all out of the pan. It hardens quickly. I wasn't able to roll it out nearly as thinly as the candy in the photo. Still, it had a great brittle texture and tasted delicious.

This is wonderful! Very impressive. Make sure to follow directions exactly as far as temperature. Mine took a little longer than the recipe says. You have to work quickly at the end so make sure to have all equipment set out.

Wow. These are addictive. I've never made brittle, but this intrigued me (and I had the ingredients on hand). Everyone loved them. The first phase went faster than the recipe stated and the second phase went slower --- but it worked out great. The pumpkin seeds (or pepitas) cook in the process. Will make again soon.

This was excellent. I doubled the recipe and would recommend doing so. Getting the sugar to reach 238 degrees took longer than prescribed, but this is probably because I doubled the recipe. I still only needed two sheets of parchment... I lined a cookie sheet with parchment, poured the molten brittle on it, put the second sheet on top, and used a rolling pin to get it thin. Quickly removed the top sheet of parchment, used a pizza cutter to cut in strips, and let it cool about 10 minutes before breaking the strips off. Easy, impressive, and good. I'll be making this again.

Simple and fun. The seeds made popping sounds before the crystallized sugar caramelized. I got my safety glasses on but nothing jumped out of the pot so all was good.

Really good, and popular with the friends who ate it. Very easy and quick to make. You do have to work fast if you want nice long "straws", as the brittle is not easy to cut without breaking. I ended up just breaking it into pieces. Looks lovely.

Pumpkin seed brittle is a revelation! The seeds have a wonderful toastiness, and the brittle rolls out thin --yeilding a much thinner, more nutty brittle than any peanut brittle. Result: a tastier, more delicate brittle. (In the mag, this was part of a cheese course billed as 'a Barcelona twist on the cheese course'. The visual allusion of the brittle strips to the spires of Gaudi's Sagrada Familia is palpable.)

Visual instructions were excellent. Be prepared to work fast at the end during rolling out and cutting. Delicious.
