it was absolutely delicious. used pork chops a bit thicker, made my own dressing and marinated chops for about 4 hours. kids and family loved it. i loved cooking it. will become a "fancy dinner" for guests who eat pork. YUM. served with rice, but i think couscous, or even cheese grits would go well.

Great, easy recipe! I followed the instructions as written, only using homemade balsamic vinaigrette instead of bottled and sherry in place of the chicken broth. I used Trader Joe's tart montmorency cherries and they worked wonderfully! Lots of flavor, super easy. Served with polenta and a spinach & goat cheese salad.

I made this tonight, accompanied by basmati rice and roasted baby beets and wilted greens from the garden. It was a delicious combination. I might try it again and add a little sherry or Madeira to the reduction, but the sauce was a wonderful compliment to the chops. Doubled the recipe for 4 chops, next time I might triple the sauce for more to drizzle on the rice.

This worked just as well with pork loin roast. I had to feed 9 people for Easter and didn't want last minute prep, so bought a 5-lb. pork loin and baked that separately with salt & pepper (I trimmed the pork). Then I did 5X the sauce and just poured it on the sliced pork. It was fabulous. Used a combination of cheap and expensive balsamic vinegars (Oliviers & Co., available by mailorder, is wonderful and reasonably priced.) I also added oil, but it all rose to the top so I skimmed it off and will leave it out next time. I used sauvignon blanc instead of chicken broth. Found multiple brands of dried cherries at the Kroger, so I think they're becoming more available. I added more cherries than the recipe called for, and let the sauce simmer quite a while, so the cherries plumped up and the sauce thickened a little. Got rave reviews and the leftovers were excellent as well.

We made this twice, and it just isn't that good in our opinion. If you decide to try it, be sure to make your own vinaigrette - it made the dish much better, but still not good enough to add to our collection. Too bad - it is quick & easy.

I love this recipe and make it often. It's very easy, quick and tastes great. I just realized the other day that the receipt calls for balsamic vinaigrette, not balsamic vinegar. However, Ive always used balsamic vinegar and I think it tastes just fine. I just make sure to really cook the sauce down so its not to vinegary. Also, instead dried cherries I use dried cranberries and usually add more than the recipe calls for. I like serve it over couscous.

Made this today, and enjoyed it, but I wish I'd taken the time to read the reviews. I'll make my own vinaigrette next time, the purchased one was too oily. Will also try the cinnamon and the wine. Wish I could get Trader Joe's tart dried cherries more often. With our own pork, it was good, with the above changes I'm expecting magic.

I hit start on my rice cooker and in 25 minutes an entire meal was done. The pork chops are flavorful anf juicy. I took someone else's suggestion and the dash of cinnamon added that third dimension to the dish. I used cooking sake and cranberries instead and it turned out great. I had a garlic steamed broccoli vegetable side.

Not a bad meal, but not amazing. Our cherries were fairly large. I recommend chopping them to get more of the fruity sweetness out.

made this tonight and it was delicious. i followed the advice that was given in some of the other reviews. made my own vinaigrette and substituted wine for the chicken broth (used a pinot grigio) and I was very pleased with the results. very quick and easy meal to prepare. will make this again very soon!

Yum. I used about 1/4 cup of dressing plus a tablespoon of basalmic vinegar to play up that flavor a bit, and it's nearly impossible to find dried cherries here so I did the dried cranberry thing. Otherwise followed the recipe and it was very good. To go with it I cooked rice, just plain old rice, following the package directions except using chicken broth instead of water, threw in a handful of the dried cranberries and a sprinkle of cinnamon. You may or may not need salt depending on how salty the broth you use is. Then I piled rice in the center of the plate and propped a pork chop on it and poured the sauce from the chops over the whole pile. Quite worthy of a company meal. Oh, I also happened to have bone-in chops and Hub and I were both sucking the bones it was so good.

I'm not a big fan of pork, but this was fast, easy to prepare and very good. The baby especially loved the cherries! The meat was very tender and flavorful. We paired it with a blend of pasta, garlic and broccoli with a dash of balsamic vinegar. Had all the elements of a good family meal!

The second time I made this recipe, I used balsamic vinegar straight, not the vinaigrette, and it changed the flavor ever so slightly. It is now a family favorite. Even my son who does not like pork chops, loves it.

Oh baby. I LOVED this. I've been making a lot of pork this year and I'm still trying to find a recipe that I really love. This is definitely the best yet. I used a home-made vinaigrette and substituted some white port wine for the chicken broth. I will make this again and again. Not too sweet, not too salty, very succulent.

Rating: 3
This is one of my standard family dinners for years now and always comes out great. I do not hesitate to serve it to guests who always like it. The cooking time varies with the pork, but as long as you don't overcook it's delicious. I use Trader Joe's bottled balsamic and TJ's dried tart montgomery cherries which are great

I made this recipe exactly as written, except I tripled it. It was very good for a weeknight meal--four forks as far as quick, easy and tasty go, which are my standards for a good weeknight meal. I wouldn't make it for guests, though; the sauce was missing something. I might play around with it because it was good, but not extraordinary. All in all, though, it's easy to make with stuff on hand, and we all--even the kiddos--enjoyed it.

This dish was so good. I combined this with another recipe and added a good port wine to the liquid and cherry preserves to thicken it. Everyone loved it, and I'd like to try this sauce with chicken next.

Just made this tonight for a quick dinner. Used a decent balsamic vinegar, boneless pork loin chops and dried cranberries. Reduced the sauce until thick and added a pat of butter at the end give it more body. Be sure to use high quality ingredients and it will taste great.

Rating: 3
I made this pretty much by the book, with no substitutions. For a quick, easy and tasty weeknight meal, this is really very good, but it is *not* the gourmet-quality, dinner-party-worthy dish some other cooks are making it out to be. I used a high-quality bottled vinaigrette that was fat-free (the only kind I could find), and I imagine that some of those who are complaining of excessive oiliness used vinaigrette that had oil in it (although I concede that oil & vinegar is what a vinaigrette is all about). My dinner companion was crazy about the dish. I will make it again, and I'll also try it with chicken breasts and/or thighs.

This recipe was quite simple to prepare and was delicious. I paired the pork with mashed baby red potatoes and fresh green beans with toasted almonds. Pinot Noir is a good wine to pair with this entree.

Not sure why my pork sirloin chops came out kind of tough with this recipe...they didn't seem overcooked, still a tad pink in the middle. The sauce was quick and tasty - I think next time I'll just sear the chops and cook them through, then make the pan sauce and serve, instead of putting them back in to simmer. I used a dried fruit medley with apples, cherries, cranberries etc, and added a splash of regular balsamic vinegar. A nice fall dish!

I have always had difficulty cooking tender pork chops. This recipe was unbelievable. The pork was as tender as veal or filet and the taste was delicious with the blend of cherries and balsamic. Not to mention it was easy and fast! A new favorite - dinner party worthy.

I didn't rate this, since I technically did not make it as specified. I subbed dried cranberries, as it was what I had on hand, homemade balsamic dressing, and that chicken stock paste that can be reconstituted with h2o. It was still delicious. Very easy. Will make again. Served with sauerkraut (drained and baked with wh. wine, chicken broth, bacon) and garlic mashed potatoes. No complaints here.

I used a handfull of fresh cherries instead of dried ones and the dish came out great. Also, I used rasberry balsamic dressing (for the marinade). The sauce was so tasty, I had to resist licking my plate.

I really liked this recipe.....I also made the balsamic vinaigrette (you gotta have all the ingredients sittin' around anyway) but didn't listen to the reviews and the sauce DID end up a bit too oily. I also used a small sliced onion and used dried cranberries, since they were already here, and yum! I liked using bone-in chops and can't wait to make again!

I too don't get all the hoopla over this one. The sauce is good, but the pork is tough and chewy. I might broil a thinner chop and then pour the sauce over them and I would use the sauce for chicken.

I've prepared this several times and it's become a favorite. I extract the cherries after cooking and just use the sauce.

Help!!! I made my own balsamic salad dressing, but my sauce broke down very quickly after I returned the chops to the pan. And then the chops took much longer than 2 minutes per side to finish. So I ended up with an unappetizing oily mess! Can someone tell me how to keep the sauce from breaking up? The only thing I can think of that might have caused this is that the heat may have been too high. I had it on medium low. This sounds so good, and I'd like to try it again. Any tips?

Rating: 4
Delicious. Made my own marinade and also used a top notch pinot to deglaze and added 2/3 cup chicken broth as suggested by Sonoma cook. I used bone-in pork chops - I always like the flavor of bone-in pork chops better than boneless ones. After pork chops are done simmering, I turned the heat all the way up and reduce the sauce down to 1/4 to 1/3 cup. Moist flavorful pork chops with intense sauce.

Very good, however if the chops are too thick they dont get well done enough by cooking in a skillet. Used dried cranberrys, and loved the sauce. A keeper.

Flavorful and distinctive--a success. Reviewers' hints were helpful: Made my own vinaigrette, substituted dried cranberries when I couldn't find cherries. Even though I didn't add all the marinade to the sauce, the sauce was still a bit too oily for my liking (but note that I did use regular chicken broth, which may have contributed). I'll reduce oil and butter next time.

Very Good recipe -- made a few variations. After sauteing the shallots, I deglazed with about 1/3c Pinot Noir, then added 2/3c chicken broth and the rest of the ingredients. I also used pork tenderloin which I marinated in the balsamic vinaigrette for 4 hours. Very tasty entree!

This was best pork chop preparation my husband and I have ever had! I made my own vinegrette using fresh herbs and that probably helped. I also used dried tart cherries which softened during the cooking process. The deep flavors of cherry and balsamic paired together very well and achieved a roundness that reminded me of a good wine. Also, the cooking process left the chops very tender and moist. No chop dryness with this recipe.

I've made this dish twice now, both times using dried cranberies instead of dried cherries--rave reviews all around. Make sure the pork chops aren't too thick, though, because it takes them longer to cook than the cranberries care to endure!

This was a great entree for ease of preparation after working all day. My husband said that the aroma from the kitchen was wonderful. He then said that the chops lived up to the aroma. I agree with him. I was sure that the pork chops would be dry, but was pleasantly surprised by how juicy and flavorful they were. I did not find dried cherries at first, so substituted dried cranberries, (thanks to other reviews) which worked just fine. I have run across dried cherries since then and bought them to have on hand, as I intend to prepare this again very soon.

This recipe was superb! It was fast, easy, and did not require a ton of ingredients. I used thin pork chops which lessened the cooking time.

One of our favorite quick, juicy pork chop dinners. Followed previous reviewers' suggestions for homemade vinagrette (light on the oil); also used 1 minced onion and 2 minced cloves garlic. I think bone-in chops stay moister in this recipe. Used mixed berries & cherries, substituted white wine for the broth, and used a little bit of sugar at end w/salt & pepper to adjust seasonings. Terrific, quick supper, great served with a nice green vegetable and some saffron rice.

Very tasty! My husband said it was one of the best "new" dishes I had made in a while. Next time I make it, I will not pour the leftover marinade into the sauce. This made it much to oily for my taste. We had to lift the "goodies" out with a slotted spoon.

This recipe was quick, colorful and very tasty and I love that it has so few ingredients. It won rave reviews from my husband, my 16 year old stepson and my 2 year old - quite a diverse age group to appeal to ordinarily! I did not use a bottled balsamic dressing because that didn't appeal to me. Instead, I mixed up my own quick vinegarette with balsamic, olive oil, salt, sugar and a little mustard powder. I also did not use shallots and instead cut up some thinly sliced onions. I will definately make this recipe again.
