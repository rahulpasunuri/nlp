Halibut only-used a leek instead of an onion and left out the thyme. Served it with a basil aioli from this site (made with dill instead!) It was delish.

This was terrific -- the fish was beautifully cooked, the orange aioli delicious and a wonderful accompaniment. I made it the first time for guests who love fish and they raved about it. The second time was for my son, who hadn't thought he would like halibut and loved it. It was easy and impressive-looking.

After reading the other review, I was worried about making this but thankfully I still did. I used Grouper instead of Halibut, lemon thyme instead of regular thyme and shallots instead of an onion. I also marinated the fish in the wine and spices for an hour before poaching. Turned out great and the sauce is anything but bland - used the sauce on grilled asparagus too, so delicious!!

Very bland, even with the aioli. The aioli was bitter and bland. The poaching liquid needs more oomph. So many changes are needed that there must be a better poached fish recipe on this site.
