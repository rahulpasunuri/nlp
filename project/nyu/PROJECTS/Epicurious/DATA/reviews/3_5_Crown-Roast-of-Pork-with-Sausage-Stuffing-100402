I have not been on this site for awhile and in looking for a crown rib recipe I looked at this and thought the same thing,where is the pork sausage? It says stuffing recipe and is followed by the sance ingredients. I realized you have to click on the stuffing recipe to get the recipe. No need to be insulting Atlanta.

The roast and stuffing were delicious, but the sauce never really got thick and didn't taste that great! We didn't serve it. I was happy to have the suggestion about the cherry tomatoes on the tips of the bones, since I couldn't find the little paper frills.

Excellent and simple; got rave reviews, but I'd rather use the pan drippings for gravy-better. Also, the stuffing I baked separately was better than the stuffing in the roast itself for some reason.

I do Christmas Eve dinner and this worked very well for me. I like things that I can stick in the oven and not worry about. The cuts are like pork chops but they do come out very moist and tender.

This was excellent and a cinch to make. We had this for Christmas dinner and it was a big hit. This serves 6 easily and could probably serve 8 if a few people had small appetites. We had a LOT of leftovers (not that I'm complaining!)

It had a good flavor. It isn't an easy dish to make and I will have to try it again !

Was looking for a good sausage stuffing recipe. Since this one has no amount of sausage mentioned, or anything like bread cubes or cornbread mentioned....i can only assume this is a sausage stuffing recipe for people who don't like either sausage or the stuffing....jeez.

This dish is fabulous and has become a holiday tradition. I use spicy italian sausauge and double the gravy (delicious with garlic mashed potatoes). Presentation is beautiful. A bit of work but well worth it for special occasions.

For those of you looking for the amount of sausage- there is a link to the stuffing at the top of the page. You will need one 12 oz. package of bulk pork sausage, crumbled.

Where is the sausage in the sausage stuffing?? Confusing to me.

An excellent recipe -- just under 2 hours in a 350-degree oven and the roast was cooked to perfection. In fact, it didn't even need basting. I made my own variation on the sausage stuffing using wild mushrooms rather than chestnuts and more herbs.
