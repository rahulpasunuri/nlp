Here's how the matter stands. This is my very first time eating turnips and I haven't quite made up my mind whether I like them or not. If I had perhaps the rating would be higher but it certainly wouldn't go any lower. This is a very simple recipe to make with ingrediants almost anyone would have on hand, I used a splash of lemon juice instead of the zest since it was the only thing I didn't have. If you like turnips, you will like this recipe. If you don't like turnips you can still eat this without gagging. Not bad in my book =)

excellent, easy, healthy. I didn't use breadcrumbs because I had bought a box of matzah meal by mistake (thought they were crackers- it's all in french anyway), so that's what I used. I never realized how yummy matzah meal is when used as breadcrumbs. Also I used coriander because it's less suspicious than the parsely they sell here. great side-dish... mmm

ok, so I don't love turnips, but bought a bunch at the farmers market b/c they looked very fresh. I made this recipe, and liked it pretty well. The boiled/sauteed turnips were excellent on their own simply with s&p, but I found that the breadcrumb/parsley mixture dried them out too much. Next time I'd add more butter or oil when tossing the turnips with the breadcrumb & parsley mixture, or perhaps mixing a bit of broth with the mix for a lower fat version.

So lovely and elegant. I used dried whole wheat Panko breadcrumbs and tossed the turnips with some leftover cooked quinoa. The lemon is wonderful.

I have a boatload of turnips growing in the backyard (can't stop eating those turnip greens!), and was looking for a new way to serve them. So happy I found this recipe! I used purple-top white turnips (the sweet ones), parsley flakes instead of parsley (because that was all I had on hand), and doubled the recipe. In a meal consisting of poached chicken breasts with mushroom and garlice sauce over rice, cooked greens, and these turnips, the turnips were the first to go. I will engrave this recipe in stone. Yummers tummers.

I used tiny baby turnips and left them whole, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter and was very, very pleased!

Nice change of pace to try turnips as a side dish. Direct quote from my husband, a confirmed vege-phobe: "Frightening but delicious".

If turnips are fresh, this is a good recipe, added green peas for variety and color.

Easy and flavorful. I loved it. I sliced the turnips rather than cutting them into wedges and I used prepared bread crumbs. It was great.

I've never had turnips as a side dish before so this was a real foray into the unknown. Turned out pretty good! I did not use lemon zest or parsley...just seasoned bread crumbs and added some olive oil as well.

Had been meaning to make this recipe for years and finally did: It was very tasty, not time-consuming or difficult at all, so I'll definitely make it again. Adds just enough flavor and presentation value to the lowly turnip to make it something special.

Very easy, very good. Paired well with lemon-parsley pork loin.

A REAL TREAT I YOU LOVE ROOT VEGGIES & ESPECIALLY SO IF YOU ARE A VEGETARIAN. SOMETIMES I ADD A FEW DICED ONIONS & ALMOST ALWAYS PREPARED BREAD CRUMBS. FRESH PARSLEY IS BEST, BUT EVEN DRIED WILL BE OKAY. IT'S A GREAT SIDE DISH!!
