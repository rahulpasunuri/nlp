A good classic egg salad...I used 1/2 as much mayonnaise and added a stalk of celery.

I made this 2.5 tablespoons of mayo, and diced white onions instead of chopped red. It turned out great! Even 2 tablespoons of mayo would have worked. I served it with a dash of paprika on top.

I made this as written. there is way too much mayo. it is soupy. i also think that the quatity of onion is overpowering. that said, make this with half the mayo and half the onion, and it would be much better.

I made this recipe just as it is and it was great! I wouldn't change a thing.

so simple, and yet so delicious. i added one finely chopped celery rib and substituted fresh parsley for thyme (no fresh thyme around). served with sliced avocado instead of sprouts. in the future, i might add more eggs or use less mayo--it was maybe a little bit creamier than i prefer. still, the bare bones make this one a keeper.

FABULOUS! I have tried many, many egg salad recipes on this site and elsewhere and this one is the best! It is very thyme'y and distinctive.

This was very good and filling. I used oregano instead of thyme. However, I would use less mayonaise; it was little too creamy. Otherwise a quick and easy meal to make.
