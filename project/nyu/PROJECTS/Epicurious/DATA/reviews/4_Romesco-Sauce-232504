Made this last week while on vacation near Barcelona -- seemed appropriate -- and everyone raved. Couldn't find hazelnuts so used more almonds in their place. Was delicious over grilled zucchini and eggplant, fish, and chicken.

This was easy and delicious. I did not have hazelnuts so I used walnuts and I did not blanch the almonds, just toasted them whole with the walnuts. I used a homemade gluten free artisan bread and also added artichoke hearts. I did not use pimientos. The flavor was amazing. I took it to the owner and chef of the Italian restaurant next to my office and they couldn't get enough of it. I used it for a dipping sauce for chickpea fries that I made. So good together. It also was great spread on the same bread that I used in the recipe. http://divatasticgladiator.com/chickpea-fries

Delicioso! I only used almonds and used canned tomato and store bought roasted red peppers. I concur that the 'chop' setting is preferable to the 'blend' because it maintains a good texture that way.

I've never had romesco sauce before, so I have no basis for comparison, but I thought that this was delicious. It was wonderful with grilled shrimp and grilled orange roughy, and it will probably be just as good with grilled pork (I'll try that soon). I forgot to toast the hazelnuts and rub off the skins, and I also forgot to add the almonds when I was supposed to (I added them to the stuff in the food processor), and the sauce still turned out just fine. I don't think that this was especially time-consuming because a lot of steps, like the roasting of the tomato, are not active time. I would highly recommend this recipe, as opposed to the less authentic-seeming recipes that contain things like roasted red peppers. I'm going to freeze my leftovers in 2 ounce plastic ramekins and defrost them as I need them, just like I do with pesto. This then becomes a quick and convenient sauce.

This is amazing!! I am so excited to try this with all types of meats etc... what a great and versatile sauce. I roasted some tomato sauce in lieu of tomatoes. I used all almonds bc I had no hazelnuts on hand. I also added a clove of raw garlic during pureeing to add a little more kick. I made some small turkey meatballs and simmered the browned meatballs in the sauce to warm it all before serving and the sauce really changed. It mellowed a lot (the vinegar cooked off?) but it was delicious. I'll be sure to try the recipe as written next time as I am wondering if it really different with hazelnuts.

DELICIOUS. I used one can (14.5 oz.) of Hunt's Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes, a staple in my pantry, in lieu of a fresh tomato. Fire Roasted flavor completmented chili flavor. Next time I will not rub the skins off from the hazelnuts....hey, the Romesco goes into the food processor along with tomatoe, why bother? Do not over blend; prettier with plenty of texture. I did NOT add the 1/4 tsp salt and neither my wife nor I salted at the table. Served Romesco Sauce over low-fat oven-fried Tilapia baked on a Silpat and combination was hearty and healthy. Romesco requires just a few minutes to prepare. Rich flavors.

Absolutely delicious! Full of flavour--the nuts are essential.
