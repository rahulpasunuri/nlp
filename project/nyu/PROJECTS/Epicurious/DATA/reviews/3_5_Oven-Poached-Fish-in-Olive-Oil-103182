Easy and produces evenly cooked, moist fish every time. The lemon slices make the dish.

This was just ok... I followed the recipe to the letter but there was just not much flavor.

This is a fabulous recipe for halibut. I've never tasted fish prepared so beautifully! The oil does not absorb and the fresh fish flavor comes out beautifully. Sometimes I omit the capers for simple, home cooked fish dinner. Superb!

I modified the recipe a bit because I used Dover Sole. I didn't want the seasonings to overpower the sole, so I cut the quantities in half. I brushed the fillets with olive oil and wrepped 3/4 lb quantites first in parchment paper and then loosly in foil to hold the parchment package together. Outstanding!!

Just delicious and so easy, uses things I always have in the pantry. This will become a regular.

Amazing! I added sliced onion and extra capers. Served it over a bed of fresh arugula & drizzled some of the oil over the top. Truly exceptional. Be sure to save the remaining oil to use again. It just gets better!

So easy and very moist. I am making it for the second time in five days, this time for guests. Delicious!

My halibut cooked perfectly in about an hour. I thought it was great, but my husband - who doesn't like sour things - didn't like the capers at all. The lemon was surprisingly mild since they were very thinly sliced. Served this with black forbidden rice which had a nice bite with the fish. I would try this aqain with a seasoning other than capers since the fish cooked so well.

Our youngest son is a fishing guide in Alaska. I have made this recipe many times and when made with "off the boat fresh fish" it is ethereal. So, do this with the stuff most of us get in the markets and you will not be disappointed. It makes really good fish

I used sole, and it came out very moist if not particularly flavorful. (The mild lemon flavor might suit halibut better than sole.) Next time I'll probably use more capers and I may include some white wine.

Easy to make, healthy. I even experimented with different types of fish and it turned out great. I used less than the recommended amount of olive oil, just a personal preference. The parsley turns out beautifully after baking, nice and crunchy. Worth a try!

I modified by using only 2 pieces of Halibut, 1 cup of olive oil, halving the amount of salt and pepper, kept same amount of parsley - but kept some to sprinkle on top of some mashed potatoes, and then used a 4oz jar of capers - cutting up the 1/4 cup and leaving the rest whole (used them all - we love capers). Baked for an hour - and It turned out so great, not at all oily and was super easy to make! Pair it with some instant Roasted Garlic mashed potatoes (change out the required milk for 2 parts milk, the rest sour cream) and you've got an impressive and easy weeknight meal! :)

Halibut, as opposed to albacore tuna which some testers rated, was perfectly cooked, and the timing was correct with this fish. The oil was delicious, and definitely could be used in dressings.

I made it with Snook. Time was 40 minutes in my convection/steam oven. Superb results, exept that, not beeing able to get Sicilian Lemon, the variety you probably used in the US, I tried with a local lime, and the result was a bit bitter.

Flavor was fantastic, but at 50 minutes my albacore tuna was WAY overdone. I would check at 30 minutes.

Flavor was fantastic, but watch the time!! I checked my albacore tuna after 50 minutes and it was WAY overdone. I would check after 30 minutes.

Despite the fact that I am not a fish lover, this is a winner. Very simple, healthy and delicious. The fish does not absorb the oil and even with a little of the oil spooned over it is comparable to the amount of oil in a vinaigrette. I think I may use this recipe for a gourmet club dinner.

Not a big fan of this receipe. Too much oil and too bland for our family.

Well! This worked for us! It took the whole 1 hour & 15 minutes to cook a portion for 2 of mahi mahi. It was so good! I'm not sure why all the olive oil, but hey! If it's not broken, don't fix it! We loved it. And easy? Ha! A piece of cake!

This was simple but good. I halved the recipe using 1lb. of haddock, 1 lemon, and 1c of oil(I kept the capers and parsley the same quantities) and it work out well.

I loved this. Yes it takes a long time in the oven but almost none of my cooking time. I cut down on the oil some and took another reviewers advice and added some chopped fresh red pepper on top. Great way to have additional fish in our weekly menu without smelling up the house for days. Served with Basmati rice and drizzled a bit of the cooking oil over the top of the rice.

This dish was excellent and extremely easy. Simple flavors are the best!

Have made this dish several times, we absolutely love it!! I mistakenly used Cod filets instead of scrod, and it was wonderful - we like the Cod better than Halibut.

easy, delicious, and a sure crowd pleaser. I served the fish on top of freshly steamed asparagus and served with red potatoes.

This was extremely easy and excellent. This will definitely become a basic in our home. Just about any non-oily fish would do well.

It took to long to prepare and it did not release the true flavor of the fish

I was pleasantly surprised by this dish! I thought 2 cups of olive oil was a bit much, but actually the fish came out not feeling oily and it was quite tender and flavorful. I had to cook it for a lot less time than the recipe suggested--otherwise it would have over cooked.

This was easy and delicious even though I managed to overcook my smaller piece of halibut. Because my spouse isn't crazy about capers, I halved the amount and added a chopped roasted yellow pepper (probably could have used it fresh with comparable results). The pepper was such a good addition, I can't imagine the dish with capers only! I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is superb! A excellent way to prepare halibut. I halved the recipe for the two of us and it worked fine. I used 1 lemon (meyer), 1 c olive oil, a little over 1 lb. of halibut, and 1/4 C capers. This is diffinetly a winner.

Easy to make and yields a good flaky fish. Tasty!

In the last three weeks we've made this twice. We thought it was too good to keep to ourselves, and so the first time we had company over for dinner we felt like we had to share it with them. This is a very light, well-flavored seductive meal. Over the top!
