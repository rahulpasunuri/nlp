A wonderful tasting cake, exeptional with lime icing (powdered sugar and lime juice). Overall a great cake. But I agree, decreasing the temperature a bit keeps it from browning too much.

After reading some of the reviews I decided to make some changes. Instead of using one pan I split the batter between two rounds and didn't bake it as long. This made the cake more moist. I also went ahead and make a lime glaze with lemon zest in it for the cake. The cake absorbed some of the glaze giving it excellent flavor.

I made this recipe as is (I did not read the reviews until afterwards). It browned too quickly in the loaf pan, so I lowered the temperature to 325. I thought it was on par for a low fat cake - good but not excellent like a regular loaf cake. The lime flavor came through but I think I added a bit more zest and juice than it called for. And, for my family, it tasted better the second day !

Was dissapointed in this cake. It was good for the first 20 minutes or so after it came out of the oven, but then lost flavor, and after one day was almost completely inedible. I'm sure it was due to the "Low-fat" -- but there was just not much flavor or good texture to the cake. A waste of good limes!

Following the advice of other reviewers, I increased the lime juice to 3 T, and also baked it in an 8 inch round cake pan. Although a frosting or icing would have made it tastier, it would increase the fat and calorie count. The cake was satisfying plain!

I followed the above advice and used 3 tablespoons lime juice. I did it in an 8" round (2" deep) and it came out perfect! The texture was great, moist and light. I did think it could have been a little more tangy, but overall it was great.

Just okay, I added extra lime and that helped, but it was too dry.

This is a delicious cake, especially for a low fat one. The texture is great. Thank you to the cook who suggested adding the icing from the lemon cookies. The cake needs it. I also took the other suggestion and increased the lime juice by 1/2 Tb - next time I will make that a whole Tb. My family said that this is a keeper.

This cake has a very light texture and I upped the flavours after reading the reviews. I doubled the quantities of lime juice, peel and vanilla and added quarter cup more flour. The result? Scrumptious! and I used the remaining egg yolks for breading fish.

After reading the previous reviews, I used three tablespoons of lime juice and added dried cranberries. The cake came out great. Lots of tangy flavor! I also made a frosting from lime juice and powdered sugar. The original recipe sounds rather bland.

I added more lime juice - just a bit more and I also frosted the cake - it really is nothing much without some frosting. I used the frosting recipe from the epicurious recipe for iced lemon cookies. I can't remember the exact name but it is just powdered sugar, butter, lemon (I used lime) juice and I think a little peel but you can check.

I thought this recipe was easy and very moist. I did change it by adding a mixture of powdered sugar and lime juice as a bit of frosting. It gave the cake more of a lime punch. I've made it many times. But I use the mexican limes or key-lime that might make the difference in the flavor.

This cake does have great texture, but it is not very good at all. And it was a heck of a lot of work for something that no one ate!

This cake was moist but I was expecting more as far as taste is concerned.
