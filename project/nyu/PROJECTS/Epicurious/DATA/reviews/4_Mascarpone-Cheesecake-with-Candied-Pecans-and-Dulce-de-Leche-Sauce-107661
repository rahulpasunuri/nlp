I thought this cheesecake was edible but nothing special, The consistency was also just ok. There are much better cheesecake recipes. The Dulce de leche sauce was too sugary. Guests said they thought they were eating a ton of sugar in each bite. All in all, this recipe was a disappointment. I definitely won't make it again.

This is heaven. The cheesecake is a slice of heaven. The crust is gorgeous. Dulce de leche - home-made or store-bought - goes beautifully, as do strawberries and candied pecans, which are ridiculously easy to make AND go fantastically on other stuff too, like salads. (I made the whole recipe and about half of the pecans wound up on the salad and people went crazy). But this is an excellent recipe to be creative with, it lends itself to all kinds of flavors - the mascarpone, which basically tastes like milk, gives it a creamier, sweeter, milkier consistency... you cannot go wrong.

This was divine! The cheesecake had a lovely creamy consistency and was delicious on it's own, but you must make the dulce de leche sauce. It was very easy to make, and the caramel flavor is sooooo good! I made the candied pecans and put them on the edge of the plate around the cake, then stood a few up on end in the middle of the cake. I then put plain toasted pecan halves around the edge of the cake itself, as I was afraid the candied pecans might be too sweet and also would soften onto the the cake. It received rave reviews, and was quite easy to make. Definitely use at least 3 layers of heavy duty foil to keep the water out of the cake. I used pecan shortbread cookies as well as the pecans in the crust (I'm originally from Texas, so I love pecans!) This is a wonderful recipe.

Rating: 4
I agree with other reviewers that this is the best (marscapone) cheesecake recipe. The shortbread cookie crust is the difference! The cheesecake can be served alone. However, the dessert becomes "out of this world" when paired with the Balsamic Strawberries (recipe for another marscapone cheesecake found on Epicurious.com). Use the best aged balsamic vinegar within your budget!

This is the best cheesecake I have ever had! Unfortunately, the candied pecans didn't work for me. The water just evaporated and left crystallized sugar, which I still used on the pecans as a snack and they were pretty good. I also couldn't make the sauce because I forgot to buy cream at the store! But this cheesecake did not suffer from either of these things. The flavor is delicate and harmonious. Also, the shortbread crust is great, I will always be using shortbread cookies instead of graham crackers from now on!

This has become one of my favorites! My boyfriend does not like nuts, so I do not add the nuts to the crust, and I don't make the candied pecans. I do make the dulce de leche sauce and it is a little sweet for me, but everyone seems to love it. I put it in little pitcher and let people pour however much they want on.

I have made this cheesecake on several occasions and it has always gotten rave reviews. It is very smooth and light and, I think, a great blend of flavors. The Dulce de Leche sauce is a great addition to a great cheesecake. This will be one of my favorites.

I had high hopes for this recipe as I love Mascarpone. Unfortunately, I thought the cheesecake was pretty bland. The Dulce de Leche sauce was overpowering. Scraped off the sauce and tried again, but then it was too bland. Maybe some lemon zest and no sauce would be a better choice.

This is the best cheesecake recipe that I have ever made! Instead of making the homemade crust in a springform pan, I buy two ready made shortcake pie crusts in the baking section of the supermarket. It makes twice the amount of cheesecakes and I always freeze one for later use. The candied nuts are kind of a pain to make so I always skip them. The dulce de leche is the best and very easy to make. It also tastes great over ice cream and keeps well in the refrigerator up to a week. YUM!

I made this recipe for a work party, where it was inhaled by my coworkers. I made it without the sauce or pecans and it was still a delicious and smooth cheescake. It might be a good vehicle for other flavors, like a fruit sauce, or maybe some liqueur in the batter.

I made this for Easter dinner and there wasn't a crumb left. But I did change the recipe a bit. I had made it before and thought the crust was too rich so I used ginger cookies instead and felt that they cut the sweetness a bit. The dulce de leche sauce is a MUST!

This cheesecake is fantastic and turns out well every time. I made it twice with fresh strawberries since they're in season, and it was perfect and creamy and everybody loved it. To avoid water getting in between the cracks, use a combination of tin foil and saran wrap - don't worry, it won't melt! Professional chefs use plastic wrap all the time for baking. Anyway, from now on this is going to be my official cheesecake recipe!

Rating: 4
I found this recipe to be quite simple to make and with a very good result. The cheesecake is delicious and creamy, yet not as heavy as some cheesecakes can be. Don't sub on the crust - it really makes this cake. Everyone commented on it. The candied pecans were easy to make and looked beautiful on the cake - however, don't put them on until the last minute. They will "bleed" onto the cake. The sauce, again, very easy to make and quite tasty, but really not needed for this recipe. The cake is perfectly good to stand on its own, it doesn't need the sauce to make it. The only downside I experienced was that the cake had little bubbles that burst during cook, so the top of my cake did not appear smooth. This didn't affect the taste, however, so no big deal. Overall, quite good and recommended!

I must amend my previous review and give this one 4 forks. I'm enjoying a piece right now and it's much creamier than the first one I made so I must have left the first one in too long. "You know how some people say chocolate is better than sex? Well this is better than chocolate!" is how one co-worker described it. I have made this as a half recipe in a 9" tart pan (with the whole recipe of crust on the bottom AND sides) to rave reviews. A half recipe also works well in a 6" springform pan. The aluminum foil gives much better coverage on the smaller pan. I also omitted the crust and swapped the flour for corn starch for a friend who is gluten-intolerant with no affect to taste or texzture. A winner all around!!

Just made this as part of our New Year's Eve dinner - very rich and extremely tasty. Like a previous reviewer, some of the water bath got through the foil layers into a small corner of the crust. I'd use another layer of foil next time just to be on the safe side.

Rating: 4
I had high expectations for this recipe after reading all the reviews, and I wasn't disappointed! I didn't candy the pecans but instead just toasted them and decorated the top of the cake with them. I did make the sauce however and would recommend it. I live in the East Village in New York City, where great cheesecake can easily be had, but I made this as a gift for a native New Yorker who gave it rave reviews-what more can I say?

I would love to give this recipe four forks but for the graininess of the cake. I thought it might be a characteristic of the marscapone cheese but with so many reviewers describing their end product as creamy I'm not so sure. Don't know what went wrong- quality of cheese, overbaking? I turned the oven off early then left the pan inside to cool slowly so that might have done it. Everyone loved the combined flavours of the sauce, cake and pecans and some said it was the best cheesecake they had ever had. Instead of using the suggested sauce recipe I, too, used the sweetened-condensed-milk-boiled-in-its-can alternative to rave reviews. The only disaster was that even with three layers of foil the water still leaked in the bottom. The water only soaked in about 1" of the crust so an adjustable tort ring saved the day. Next time I'll bake it in a 8"x3" round cake pan and put the excess in muffin cups.

I loved this cheesecake. The mascarpone made it milder and a little sweeter than a traditional cheesecake. A few of my guests felt that the dulce de leche sauce was a little too sweet, but I loved it, especially heated just a bit. Definitely a keeper.

Not too bad. I found the cheesecake a little bland though. The sauce was very well received.

OK, now I've tried it -- the cheesecake itself is very wonderful -- light and creamy. I ran out of sugar and so I only had 1 cup and that seemed to be plenty for the cake. The sauce (which is called dulce con leche in Miami, why is it dulce de leche in this recipe?) is very very sweet. Really really very very sweet. It's yummy coating for the pecans but kind of overkill on the cheesecake. Next time, I'll use a raspberry or strawberry sauce. Or a bittersweet chocolate sauce. It went over very well as it was though.

Rating: 4
OK, this is still doing the overnight chill thing in the fridge, so I haven't actually eaten a piece, but I tasted both crust and filling while I was making them and they both seemed great. But I can't imagine why anyone would use a mixer with this recipe -- if you have all the ingredients at room temp as they call for, it's so easy just to stir everything in. It's MUCH easier than Tollhouse cookies which I always mix by hand! I think the separation that other cooks have encountered is caused by 1. electric mixers at too high speed and/or 2. (and more likely) not having all ingredients at room temp. A cold egg beaten too quickly into a room temp filling could easily cause problems. It's the easiest filling I've ever mixed by hand (well, wooden spoon to be accurate). Taking it to New Year's tomorrow -- I'll let you know how people react to the finished product!

My boyfriend, who is a cheesecake FANATIC and who has tried many cheesecakes from this site courtesy of yours truly, says this one is by far the best. I followed it for the most part but I made the crust with 1 1/2 c. shortbread cookies, 1/2 c. candied pecans, and 2 T. butter. I also added lemon zest because I wanted more lemon taste. Other than that I changed nothing, the sugar wasn't too sweet. It was perfection. And so was the caramel sauce, don't buy store bought if at all possible. It's worth the small amount of work.

Oh my God --was this an amazing dessert! The cheesecake was so light that it melted in your mouth. It did not rise as high as a traditional cheesecake, so I was a bit worried until we tasted it. It was THE best cheesecake I've ever made. And the dulce de leche sauce was incredible...

I made a substantial revision to the recipe and it worked extremely well. I wanted to have an actual dulce de leche cheesecake, so I doubled the flour, removed the lemon and added a jar of dulce leche to the batter (almost all the jar incorporated in the batter, a little dribbled on the top for a slight "marbled" effect). I served more dulce de leche on the side (didn´t make it, but splurged on one imported from Argentina. Try the Chimbote or Salamandra(?)brands if you can find them). It still had the smooth taste, but also a subtle dulce de leche flavor.

The pot-luck crowd I hang with usually wants me to make the desserts, so I have been trying all sorts of cheesecake and other cake recipes. This one, by unanimous vote, is the very best! I didn't bother candying the pecans, but just rolled them in the sauce, as per one suggestion here. This really is the best and I expect I will be required to make this again and again. By the way, the sauce recipe makes way too much, but it is just wonderful over ice cream, so who cares?

Abby Dodge advises that she never had another problem with cheesecakes breaking or cracking when she set her mixer to LOW speed. Do not beat too much air into these things. I personally use a hand mixer on #2 to keep from overbeating my cheesecakes. Only mix until incorporated, don't overmix!!

Rating: 4
This was delicious! In response to the review before me I think it is important to know NOT to overbeat. I made this perfect the first time and the second time my mix also seperated. I needed this for a dinner party so I set out to make another one this time making only one change - I set my mixer (Kitchen Aid) on STIR (the first setting) and when I added new ingredients I would turn it on just until they were mixed well - then I would turn it off and add another ingredient. After all eggs were incorporated well - I turned the mixer off. I think if you overbeat it does cause seperation. The second cheesecake came out PERFECT! Everyone loved it!!

Disastrous! I was motivated to try this recipe from the numerous glowing reviews but ended up with very poor results. I consider myself an accomplished cook and followed the directions to the letter. Everything was going fine until I added the 4th egg to the cheese mixture. The entire thing separated like when an emulsion breaks, yet I definitely did not overmix. I decided to bake it anyway since I had nearly $20 invested in the thing. The end result was a very coarse and grainy textured cake that was very strange. I would be most appreciative if someone out there may know what happened and give some advice how to correct it, as I have been searching for a good mascarpone cheesecake recipe. Thanks.

I made this cake for the first time to a holiday lunch with my new girlfriend's family. i was accepted. great recipe. i burnt the top by mistake so i cut it off and covered the top with the sauce + add a sweetended peckan half on each slice + used some of the shortbread crumbs to decorate on top of the sauce.

I made this for Easter and my in-laws raved and then ate every last crumb. Cheesecakes are my specialty and in the last 15 years I have made hundreds.....this is one of the BEST ever! I rarely follow all directions but this time I did because it was the first time trying this recipe. Like many other reviewers I will make a few changes for next time. Skip the pecans, they're pretty but candied they add an odd flavor. I like someone else's idea of using pecan shortbread and will try it. Sauce is great and easy to make so do not just buy it in a jar. The sauce is very sweet and very intense so a little goes a long way. The topping idea is good but the sauce is best when warm. I think I'll keep it a little runny (i.e. don't reduce it as much) and drizzle it over each piece as I serve it. In summary ...STUNNING...easy to make and a wonderful, subtle, elegant flavor that is simply delicious. I'm sure my in-laws will request it for the next holiday....my niece's birthday in 3 weeks, if they can wait that long.

Everyone loved it. I did not candy the pecans, only coated them in the leche sauce before topping each slice. I thought the crust was too rich when paired with cake and sauce. Maybe next time I will use a biscuit, rather than shortbread (Lorna Doone), although all my guests disagreed. Well done recipe. Thanks

I'm sorry to be the first person to give this recipe a "less than glowing" review. I have made about 10 cheesecakes off this website for co-workers and friends. This was not one of the better productions from my kitchen. I felt the texture of the cheesecake was too creamy, the sauce was too "grainy" (from the sweetened condensed milk) and the candy on the pecans tasted like they were from a Cracker Jack box. The best thing about this recipe was the crust!

This cheesecake is phenomenal. We served it at an intimate birthday celebration where almost all had a "small" second slice. The crust, cake texture and flavor were great. We did not make the dulce the leche sauce, instead we bought a jar at a specialty food store. We plan to claim it as a family recipe and keep it all to ourselves.

Yes, you could easily reduce the sauce by half, but then you wouldn't have the extra to top Edy's vanilla custard ice cream. Both the cheesecake and the sauce were absolutely heavenly! My husband and I had a small valentine party and one of the guests said to me "You may not believe this, but this is the best cheesecake I ever had!" I thought she was just being gracious until I tasted it. It tasted amazingly light, and creamy too. I ran out of time so I did not make the candied pecans, but I used pecan shortbread cookies which served to add a hint of nutty flavor. After dinner I sent most of the cake home with guests so that I would not be tempted to eat it all myself, but what I didn't realize was the Dulce de Leche Sauce would prove to be just as big a threat. I could have resisted the ice cream by itself, and I could have resisted the sauce by itself, but my willpower was no match for both of them (especially during the perfect winter snowstorm we got that weekend). Try it, you'll love it. **Remember to use Heavy Duty aluminum foil to keep the water out.

By far one of the best cheesecakes I have ever made. I placed an 8-inch cake ring on the top of the completely-cooled cheesecake, poured the warmed dulche de leche sauce into it and let it cool/harden. Made a wonderful top to the cheescake. Also spaced the pecans apart when pouring onto the baking sheet, which allowed for large pieces of amber-colored "glass" with a pecan floating in the middle. Made a wonderful presentation either standing in the middle of the piece or leaning on the side.

made it for a dinner party this week & it was fabulous. I substituted the rum dulce de leche sauce (also on the website) & tasted fantastic with the pecans and cheesecake. I was worried it would be a really dense NY style cheesecake & it isn't at all. cheesecakes of all kinds are my signature desert and this just made my top 3 list.
