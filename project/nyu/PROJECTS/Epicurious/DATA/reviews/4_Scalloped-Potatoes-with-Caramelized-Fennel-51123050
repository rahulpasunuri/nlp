This was amazing. I've made the other potato-fennel gratin on this site, and it was watery and bland. This one was wonderful. The caramelized fennel makes a real difference, and the potatoes are creamier. The only change I made to the recipe was to add 1/2 tsp. ground fennel to the milk while I was simmering the potatoes and to use Jarlesberg cheese, because that's what I had. This is going to become a go-to dish for dinner parties.

In response to the person who thought it was bland, I do always add crushed fennel seed to my dishes with fennel. It is very flavorful so a little goes a long way. That way you get a robust fennel flavor standing up to the potatoes. I think the carmelizing does make it more interesting and better visually too.

I made this for for the first time for company so I was incredibly nervous, but it was a huge hit. A lot of work went into it, but after the first time I worked out a lot of the kinks and feel much more confident to make it again (much faster). I recommend doing all your chopping ahead of time. This recipe can be made the day before, so take into consideration it can take a while. The fennel was delicious, I have never cooked nor caramelized fennel so I may be stating the obvious, but I cooked it to the point where I thought I had slightly burned it, but it added the perfect caramel flavor (caramelize till the pan is dark brown, will give fennel a caramelize onion look). I used Gruyere, which my husband was so upset at the "stinkiness" when he grated it, but he loved the dish, and said that the "stinky cheese" was delicious and not at all stinky once cooked.

This was good, but the caramelized fennel was really not worth the effort. I was expecting it to add a nice sweetness to balance the rich, savory potatoes and cheese, but I actually couldn't taste it at all.
