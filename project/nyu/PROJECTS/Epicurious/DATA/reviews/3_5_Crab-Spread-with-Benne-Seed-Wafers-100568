This recipe was served to a dinner party of eight. Although we all thought that it was OK, everyone of us could think of a crab appetizer that we liked much better. I'll keep looking!

This got mixed reviews at a dinner party last weekend. Some people liked the slight tang from the horseradish. Others (including me) thought it was too plain. I would add some more spice like red pepper flakes to improve this recipe.

I've been making a cold crab dip (topped with cocktail sauce) for years but wanted to jazz things up a bit this year. This recipe was great, not a tablespoon left and my guests thought it was outstanding.

SUPER, nothing but compliments on the stuffed jumbo shells I put this concoction into. Refrigerate overnite and add fresh parsley and finely chopped celery to it. I will make it again and again.

We had leftover king crab and used it in this spread. As we had no horseradish, I used wasabi powder for flavoring. There was no way this spread was going to last for 8 hours; it was gone in 1 hour! Delicious!

This turned out fastastic. I used fresh crabmeat and made sure the smooth and with no cream cheese lumps before incorporating the other ingredients. I upped the amount of dijon, worcestershire, horseradish, salt and cayenne. Served with Carrs Water Crackers. Big hit on the boat trip.

(I can't imagine what that person did to make this recipe "stinky" -see below.) Good recipe, I would increase the cayeenne and Worcestershire. What could be bad with 1 lb. of good crabmeat in it? I would add something green for color, like parsley. Otherwise, it's a little too white looking. I put red lumpfish caviar on top. It was a big hit.

I made this for my supper club which met last night. It was so stinky I was nervous about bringing to my friend's house. The taste was fine but I think the green onions gave it the aweful odor. Needless to say it wasn't gobbled up. Nor was the other half of the spread, which I shared with a neighbor who had company last night.

This was very good and very flavorful. I didn't realize until I'd gotten to the end of the recipe that it needed to develop flavor--this was two hours before my guests were to arrive. But we still all liked it very much, so I can't imagine what those extra six hours might have done to the recipe!

I too used canned, but good crab. I will follow the recipe, but may change to a yogurt or yogurt-based sour cream. I agree that all the zesty flavors (horseradish, etc.) are necessary and possible can be increased.

I had quite a bit of fresh leftover crab and hated to throw it out, so I was glad to find this recipe. I made the dip the day before taking it to a small party, where everyone loved it -- one guest parked himself beside the bowl and ate most of it. The only changes I made were omitting the mustard (didn't have any), tossing in a tablespoon of drained capers and using fat-free cream cheese. However, next time I'd follow the recipe exactly and also use regular cream cheese (the flavor of fat-free was awful, and I'm sure that the dip would have tasted a LOT better without it).

Made this for a holiday party and it sat mostly un-eaten. My guests thought it was tuna salad. The crab was overpowering and a bit too "fishy". Maybe I did something wrong but not worth trying again.

This is a very good recipe for crab dip. Using drained, canned LUMP crab meat is fine for something like this. Fresh crab would be wonderful but it is so expensive and not really necessary. I brought this to a dinner party and it was gobbled up. I only gave it an hour or two chilling and it was delish, but a few more hours would have probably made it even better. Use a very crisp cracker like Carr's Table Water and your guests can just scoop it up right onto their cracker with one hand while holding their drink in the other. I will definitely make this again and again. Enjoy!

I made this for a party Saturday and the guests couldn't get enough of it. I used the one-pound can of lump crab from Costco. Be sure to drain the crab thoroughly and even squeeze it in your hands before adding to prevent the gloppy texture of one reviewer. It is perfect and easy. No changes are necessary.

Prepared this recipe cut down by half. Was O.K. but not great. Used backfin pasteurized canned crab meat from Costco deli. The main reason why I rated only 2 forks was because of the "gloppy" consistency. Was probably because of the crab meat I used. Also could have used a little more "zip". A dash or 2 of tabasco would have been an improvement. Adjustments to the seasonings are needed and definitely use the Old Bay too! Didn't make the accompanying recipe for crackers.

I made this recipe for New Year's Eve and thought it was scrumptous!!! I used canned crab instead of fresh, and found that the lump canned crab fell apart when all the ingredients were mixed. Therefore, I think you can easily use "regular" canned crab with success, although fresh would make the dish outstanding! I made the recipe exactly as written and I would not change a thing. Give it a try and you won't be dissappointed.

This is a great easy recipe. I added a bit more horseradish and cayenne to give it more kick. I also used canned real lump crab and added an extra can of claw meat. This one will go to many parties with me in the future.

It's so easy to make and vey tasty!! I used a reduced fat cream cheese and low fat sour cream to make it healthier.

I thought this had plenty of flavor - much better than my usual which is basically the same without the cayenne, dijon or horseradish. I used all the meat from a 2lb Dungeness, and I thought it was great. For you flavor hounds who thought this was bland, try my southwest hot version: crab, cream cheese, canned green chilis, scallions mixed with shredded pepper jack and sharp cheddar with some Tobasco. Spread in pie plate and top with more shredded cheeses and crushed tortilla chips. Bake until bubbling and serve with more chips - great for SuperBowl.

I made this again for a recent family gathering, serving it with crackers. This time I made half the recipe, but used two cans of crabmeat. (Fresh crabmeat is rare and expensive up here on the tundra.) The addition of that extra can of crab makes all the difference in the world--it went from being good to being great. I garnished the dip with a few thinly sliced rings of green onion.

This was quite good, but have made similar dish like this that I serve hot. It was an appetizer at a seafood restaurant that I worked in years ago, with just crab, cream cheese, horseradish and worcestershire, s/p to taste (although I often put in a bit of Old Bay Seasoning as I lived in the Chesapeake Bay area where that seasoning is so ubiquitous). It was served in individual small souffle cups, heated in oven until bubbling and brown on top and served with crackers. Wonderful. (scallions would be good compliment to it, and have even added small bay shrimp to it)

I made this to take to a political gathering and received several compliments. I do agree with the person who said it needed a little more zip. I added a small amount of lemon pepper & garlic salt, and 1 minced celery rib & liked it much better. It is tasty, and very easy to make.

Everyone loved it. Easy to make and ingredients are standard in the pantry. Great for boating if you are going to find crab.

It is ok, but not very exciting. I think there are many more interesting things to do with all that wonderful crabmeat.

This spread is easy to prepare, and absolutely wonderful. I received rave reviews when i prepared it for a family function. I highly reccomend it to anyone who likes crab meat with a kick.
