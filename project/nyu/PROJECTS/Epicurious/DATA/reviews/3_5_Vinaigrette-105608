This dressing is much too oily for my taste - I would recommend cutting the oil or adding vinegar or lemon/lime juice. I ended up adding more vinegar and adding lime juice.

I made this with 1/2 lemon juice and 1/2 wine vinegar. Also put in a bit of fresh tarragon, minced. It was quick and easy and quite tasty!

This is an excellent vinaigrette recipe - quick, simple and full of flavour. I used red wine vinegar, dijon, olive oil, shallots and a pinch of basil. Perfect!

I modified it with a little less olive oil and a bit of minced garlic. Tastes very mild. It may need a bit more vinager to taste.

Added the dijon, shallots and dried basil. Used on arugula, roasted yellow bell pepper and roquefort salad. Served with a margherita pizza. Simply decadent.

This is a terrific, no-fail basic vinaigrette recipe. For a good variation, try doubling the amount of oil and vinegar, then add 1 tablespoon minced basil and 1 clove minced garlic (don't use the mustard). Your guests will rave.
