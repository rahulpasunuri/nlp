I tried this recipe just to gid rid of those pumpkins after Thanksgiving.Its quick & easy, I put chopped hazelnuts on top & skipped the top part because the next day its sold out like hotcakes before I could do the brulee part. I cooked the second time, 4 pies for friends & coworkers. Loved it!

Be sure to cover the crust with tin foil before broiling the sugar stage, otherwise the crust will burn. Next time I will use my kitchen blowtorch.

This pie tasted AMAZING, but I would tweak a few things before making it again: 1)I'm not sure if par-baking the crust was necessary. It was way overdone around the edges after baking it, and worse after the broil! 2)Definitely use a torch! I don't have one (it's on my Christmas list)and really missed it. It would have made the brulee topping, well, more brulee like. It wasn't as even or as crispy as I would have liked. It burnt my crust a bit, but a pie shield would have helped there. That being said, this is a big step up from a regular ol' pumpkin pie. Two of us just polished off half of it, and I'm sure the leftovers won't make it much past breakfast. I used pumpkin pie spice in place of the spices and served it with whipped cream. A wonderful ending to Thanksgiving!

This was much too sweet for my taste. If you like very sweet you will like this but if you don't ...beware. I will make it again using far less sugar.

I tried this recipe twice. The test run I used splenda/sugar mix. The pie tasted great but never really hardened like it should have. So I ditched the splenda for straight sugar and used a brulee torch....again, tasted great, but the top only stayed crunchy for about 20 minutes. Gonna keep the pie recipe, but not doing the top.

This would have been exceptional if I had used a brulee torch, it just doesn't work under the broiler. I would recommend not using the brulee crust at all if you don't have a torch. I also took the advice for the pumpkin pie spice, and everyone liked it. I used a butter pie crust recipie instead and it was very easy to use and turned out great.

This went over well at a potluck. The torch to brulee the top is a must. Did several layers of sugar, torching it each time, and then put it in the fridge for a bit before serving to get a nice crunchy top. Texture was soft and didn't always hold together - not my favorite, but some really liked the very soft texture. The crust recipe accompanying this was hard to work with - stretchy, sticky - and I thought, not worth it, although the crust got compliments.

This turned out well- it was a little difficult to get a pretty slice with the burnt sugar. Also, I put it under the broiler and the sugar did not brown evenly. But, it was a nice take on pumpkin pie. I used 2 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice in place of the seasonings, and it turned out a little spicy- perfect for my taste.

Crust/filling delicious. Crust was difficult to lay into the pie pan. Lastly, I couldn't get the topping right, and I used a torch. I blame the operator. That did not however stop anyone from eating it! It will definitely be my pumpkin pie recipe.

This pie received rave reviews from the family this Thanksgiving. In fact, we held a pumpkin pie making contest and this pie was voted, best crust, best texture and best overall pie. I served it with fresh whip cream and candied pecans. It was a bit tricky to toast the sugar in my oven, a torch would have been nicer, but I just gave it a light sprinkling of cinnamon to even out the colour. It was lovely!

The crust recipe had a bit too much water but otherwise excellent, the filling was fabulous but use a bit less sugar for the topping

This pie filling was fantastic, everybody wanted the recipe. The brulee didn't work out quite as we had hoped it would, it just didn't get hard enough. Two tablespoons of sugar was plenty.

I doubled this recipe, using 5 eggs. I parbaked the crust first. I did not do the topping treatment. It was a great hit. Thanks.

This is fantastic. Really good pumpkin pie, and the brulee topping just makes it amazing.

Delicious! Just be sure to make the crust hang over & under the edge of the dish as the recipe says. We weren't so diligent with this & the crust shrunk inwards a bit. No big deal. Super yummy! Everyone loved it.

We really enjoyed this. The brulee'd top gives a nice, satisfying crunch as you tap through it to the pumpking below.

I made this a few years ago now and I was searching for the recipe again since it was so good. I don't like pumpkin pie but I liked this recipe and my neighbor who is a pumpkin pie freak said it was the best pumpkin pie he has ever eaten. used a torch - came out great - though the sugar gets soggy on the leftovers - still yum!

I really liked this recipe. I've always served some type of pumpkin dessert at Thanksgiving but have never really liked the traditional pumpkin pie. I made the filling exactly per directions. I had considered making the recommended crust, but in my small kitchen on Thanksgiving morning I simply didn't have a square inch of counter space to roll a crust. Instead I made a graham cracker crust and added a bit of clove and nutmeg to it. The torch I received last year for Christmas did a beautiful job of carmelizing the sugar. A dollop of lightly sweetened whipped cream was the perfect garnish. Even people who will take a wee slice just to be polite were clammering for more. I think next time I make it I'll try the ginger cookie crust as one reviewer recommended.

I made this for the first time for yesterday for Thanksgiving. It was easy to prepare and I did not have problems carmelizing the sugar. I used the broiler and it worked okay. I'm sure it would have worked better with a kitchen torch, but I don't have one. I covered the crust with tin foil and it did not burn. It got rave reviews from my family. It was delicious, very creamy. My husband can't wait for me to maske it again.

The only difference between this pie and regular pumpkin pie is the sugar topping. It was nothing exceptional and my own pumpkin pie recipes are getter.

This is one Killer Pumpkin Pie. I made it as an alternative to the usual Pumpkin Pie at Thanksgiving and it got rave reviews. I agree with the other comments though- find a torch, it really is worth the time, and the topping will come out perfect.

This is the bet pumpkin pie recipe- Hands Down! I have made it twice in the past week. Once sitting beside the broiler in my stove, and the second time with a borrowed hand torch. I plan on using the torch again. It saves the pie crust from burning. However, you can buy a pie crust shield should you go with the broiler method. It's helped me for as long as I have made this pie (which by the way has been at least three years in a row).

Quick & easy pie to make. I made butter pie crust for the pumpkin pie brulee. Very creamy & rich. Very delicious pumpkin pie.

As one other review mentioned, the broiler didn't work well at all. I suggest that if you don't have a torch, don't even risk the broiler. I am not a fan of pumpkin pie, but this one is good - even with out the topping.

I just made this recipe and I was surprised how good this was. I brought it work and my co-workers loved it and I was asked to share the recipes. You definitely want to use a kitchen torch since it made it so easy to melt the sugar.

Have made this every year since it was published, minus the brulee topping since it didn't really work in the broiler and I had no kitchen torch. This year, I do, and can't wait for the brulee topping. This is the best pumpkin pie....the taste of the pumpkin custard really is superior...very creamy and is my standard. The brulee topping will be an improvement on an already outstanding recipe.

Having never been a fan of the way that ordinary pie crust pairs with pumpking, I made a crust of crushed ginger thins and butter. That was the perfect foil for the filling (minus 1/4 cup of sugar), I was in Pumpkin Heaven! I have been experimenting for years to make the perfect pumpkin crust/filling combo, and this is it.

I have not made this recipe but yet plan to for our family Christmas meal this year. I just wanted to say that for years I have heard my 76 year old father rave about the pumpkin pie his mother used to make when he was a boy and the fact that it had a crunchy, sugary glaze on top. I hope this comes close to what he remembers her making! Thank you for the service you provide.

It's not bad but definitely not brulee like by any stretch of the imagination. Consistentcy and texture were odd, like cooked pudding. The crust rim was already very brown even before the broiling with sugar. I'd rather have traditional pumpkin pie and real creme brulee... this is attempting to be something it can't. Family thought it was ok but not great.

My husband is not big on pumpkin pies and I had to literally pull this one away from him so that others could try it! Everyone loved it!! (p.s....I cheated and used a storebought crust - high quality - and saved a lot of time!)

This was a yummy recipe, I liked the flaky crust and the crisp carmelized top. I used just 1 cup of whipped cream instead of the 1 1/4, it still tasted great. I also used a kitchen torch as some other reviewers suggested.

I agree this dessert is best served in individual ramikins and the use of a brulee torch is very useful I would advise all cooks to have one they come in handy often and they are priced resonably as well. I have done brulee in the broiler but you must watch it constantly and turn it often to get it to turn out just right. Again another big hit at our house this thanksgiving.I will be serving this again.

This was the best pumpkin pie filling our family has ever tasted! I agree, it's much better to use the kitchen torch. And, definitely stick with the 4 tablespoons of sugar if you want a really crunchy topping.

This is a great holiday dessert, I served it with gingered whipped cream. I used a kitchen torch and wouldn't advise making it without one. Also, the brulee crust won't keep overnight for leftovers, so if you know you're not going to serve the entire pie you might want consider cameralizing individual slices.

I made this dish like an actual creme brulee, in individual ramikens. I thought it was delicious. Just as importantly, it can be done well ahead, making it a great entertaining dessert. My tops didn't come out brittle as they should have. I guess blowtorch is required. Guests loved it anyway.

i also had major problems with using the broiler. the sugar melted unevenly, the parts of the crust that i didn't cover carefully enough with foil burnt a little. a mini torch would have worked way better. 4 TBS of sugar seemed like a lot and i would also just recommend 2. however, my aunt loved it--she said it was the best pumpkin pie she ever had in her life (!)--and begged for the recipe.

The pumkpin pie was delicious, but I recommend either not doing the sugar on top or limiting it to only two tablespoons. Four tablespoons was way too much sugar. Using a kitchen torch is probably the best way to brown the sugar.

The pie was very tasty and creamy. I was rushing when I did my brulee topping and did not get a very hard sugar crust. But the pie by itself was still excellent.

the pie won the reviews at thanksgiving, I was a little concerned as the crust didn't brown much, then once I put it under the broiler it was perfect. I also used my torch, just to even out. a winner

The idea of pumpkin brulee was very interesting, but it just didn't work very well at all. I did use a kitchen torch to carmalize but still ran into some problems. The actual pie was delicious and I will probably use it as my pumpkin pie recipe (without the brulee)

Good, creamy pumpkin pie, but brulee-ing under a broiler is not very effective.

This dish was too much ofa hassle to make again. The pumpkin pie part turned out uneven and therefore made the brulee burnt in some parts but completely untouched in the middle. Don't let the picture fool you, its not worth making.

A great recipe! I will definetely be making this again and it will be before next Thanksgiving. I used a kitchen torch and it did take awhile, but was worth it. I do think the crust would have burned under the broiler. The leftover piece was good for an early morning treat, as well!

This recipe deserves 5 forks! This is seriously the best pumpkin pie I've ever made or eaten. I was shocked. I just made it for the 2 of us for Thanksgiving thinking well who cares if it's edible it will be a culinary experiment. I will be making this when I'm 80 if I get the chance. I do admit to having an electric salamander for the caramelizing so the crust problem wasn't an issue but I think a torch or covering with foil would also do the trick. The picture doesn't begin to do this justice. Not to mention the crust recipe with some additional water in the processor was also really good. Enjoy.

I hadn't even read the prior reviews, but we used a torch and it worked perfectly! I love both pumpkin pie and creme brulee and really liked this "combo" a lot. I think next time, I'll serve it with ginger whipped cream, but we enjoyed it quite a lot as is.

Rating: 3
This is an excellent pumpkin pie. We ate half of it the first night with no brulee since it has not had time to chill. The next night, I tried the brulee, but agree with other readers that the crust burnt. I was unable to do a second round of the brulee topping due to this. I will say that that extra topping of sugar definately added to the taste of the pie. I will shield with foil next time. Also, I used a refrigerator pie crust and it did fine.

The only problem with this is that you need to protect the crust when making the brulee, or it burns. A kitchen torch would probably be better. We served it with maple whipped cream, & it was amazing! We are making it again for Thanksgiving.
