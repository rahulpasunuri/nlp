I will definitely make this again!! I wanted the cake for a trifle I was making, so I didn't make the glaze. Next time I think I'd use 1/2 teaspoon of rosewater, it was a hint stronger than I would have liked. But if you're making the recipe as written, it's probably great with the glaze. I also doubled the vanilla, I usually do. Great recipe, lovely texture!

A long user of Epicurious, this is the first recipe I've reviewed. The cake is GORGEOUS and turned out just fine as written. I'm not sure why some reviewers indicate the recipe doesn't address the cup of sugar being added later, but maybe the recipe was amended at some point in time. Anyway, the cake is beautiful ~ high and light ~ and the rose water scent is lovely! The glaze has enough lemon to balance the sweetness of the cake. Love it!

Excellent cake...light and subtle. Now crazy about the glaze, which seemed to overpower the rosewater. I would make this again skipping the glaze.

This was easy to make and came out beautifully, but it was just too darned sweet for my taste. I served it with tart, barely sugared raspberries on the side to offset the sweetness of the cake. Next time I will reduce the sugar to 1 1/4 cups.

I made this cake to cut up and dip into chocolate fondue yesterday. I omitted the rosewater, and used only 1 cup of egg whites to make it denser for dipping. It was really good, and tonight I'm going to make it as-written to eat as a cake. And with the leftover egg yolks, I guess I'll just have to make ice cream.

Really good cake but remember to put the rest of the sugar and the vanilla in the egg whites. I baked mine at 7000' altitude and it took 2.5 hours at 300 degrees. It turned out fine but very odd the exceedingly long cook time.

Exceptional recipe. I love it with raspberries and no glaze. Also works in individual size spring form pans for strawberry shortcake, but this cake is so good I usually don't share it

Tried to make rosewater cupcakes with this recipe with mixed results. Mini- cupcakes didn't turn out at all - the tin wrappers stuck to them, and they were hard (by boyfriend said they reminded him of croutons). Made regular-sized cupcakes also in paper pannetone papers, and they were better - moist, light and soft. However, even after doubling the vanilla and rosewater, they were mostly just sweet. The glaze is nice and tart, but also so sweet. Will have to look elsewhere in the rosewater cupcake quest.

Have not tasted is yet. The instructions are terrible. Does this recipe presuppose a certain degree of baking genius? There is no mention of when to add the rest of the sugar, the rosewater, etc... Had to look up another recipe to finish.

No doubt...this is the best angel food cake ever! It is moist, light, and perfectly flavored. It is fabulous all on its own, without any glaze as well.

I've made this cake twice now, both times with rave reviews. It is an outstanding angel food cake. I will keep this recipe for years and make it on a regular basis. I followed the other peoples suggestions and it worked very well. This is also a very pretty cake. I doubled the glaze, which is a very tangy, tart glaze. Everyone loved it.

I have made this recipe quite a few times as my nephew loves it. I first made this recipe for my Mom on Mother's Day. It is very light, not a heavy cake after a good Mother's Day meal. Also it was easy to make too. Enjoy!

A light and delicate cake. Easy to make. I added 1 T of grenadine as I was beating the whites. This gives you a pale pink color and enhances the rose flavor.

The recipe is incomplete. Be sure to add the remaining 1 C sugar to the egg whites, along with the rosewater and vanilla. I added the liquids after beating the egg whites to a froth, along with the cream of tartar and salt, then slowly beat in the 1 C sugar until soft peaks were formed. Then, I followed the remaining recipe directions, folding in the flour mixture.
