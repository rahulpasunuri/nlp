Insanely good mousse. Oh, oops! Was this supposed to be a cheesecake? Awee heck. I got half-way through the recipe and realized that it was going to take 8+ hours to cool this after it cooks. No way Jose. The filling was so darn good by itself that I decided to chill it for an hour and eat it with graham crumble on top. Absolutely out of this world. AND -- no baking....no strange texture. This rocks.

I'm not vegan but I made this for some friends. Everyone raved about it. Remember to use the silken tofu and not tofu in the refrigerated section - they are two different textures and tastes. I put it in the foodprocessor and it was very creamy. I couldn't find any graham crackers that didn't contain honey so I used a Barbara's cereal (Puffins I think) that were vegan friendly and sweetened with juice. I made the crust out of those and it was a crowd pleaser. I think I'm going to make it again and add some cinnamon to it.

i was really excited to try this recipe, but unfortunately, i was disappointed. the tofu gives the cake a strange, unpleasant aftertaste, and even after baking for an hour longer than the recipe called for, the inside wasn't completely done. :(

Just a note to vegans: remember that graham crackers typically contain honey, which is not vegan. Store brands are probably more likely to have shortening or oil than real butter, but you still might want to carefully consider the crust before making/serving this to serious vegans.

Maybe tasted ok as a chocolate desert, but not when your expecting cheesecake! Wasn't impressed, in fact, as my husband pointed out, it tasted a lot like playdough. :(

This was fantastic and my guest vegan and non vegan enjoyed it.

I am a pastry chef at a fine dining restaurant that enjoys accomodating my desserts to feed everyone's dietary needs. Cheesecake texture but definitely not the same taste; Delicious in its own world. Used Ghiradelli 60% chips and Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa Powder so it had a very rich flavor. The chocolate-caramel fudge sauce seized when I put it in the mixture, but then I put it over low heat on the stove for a bit and stirred with a fork until it was smooth. I agree with other cooks that it was very time consuming and expensive, and also needs to be chilled for longer. But definitely a big winner.

This was very expensive to make. Even though I used an excellent chocolate - Vahlrona - we were very disappointed in the results - nothing special, in fact it was bland and no cheesecake feel to it at all. Agree that cooking and setting times were way off in the recipe - required more time than stated.

I agree with the other review about the chocolate mixture seizing when mixed, but it smoothed out in the cooking process. I think that it needed to bake about 1hr 10 min and definitely needs to chill for more like 8 hours to set. It was delicious and my veg and vegan friends loved it! I added a teaspoon of instant espresso powder to give it a little extra. It was labor intensive, but I would definitely make it again.

It would be best to blend the tofu and soy mixtures before making the caramel-chocolate mixture, and to make sure the tofu-cream cheese mixture(s) are at (warm) room temperature; otherwise the chocolate mixture will seize and form giant clumps when you try to blend it into the cream cheese mixture. I remedied this by putting the blended filling back into the saucepan and warming it on low, stirring. I used a two prepared chocolate-cookie crusts and reduced the recipe by about 1/4. Rich and delicious and I got many compliments!
