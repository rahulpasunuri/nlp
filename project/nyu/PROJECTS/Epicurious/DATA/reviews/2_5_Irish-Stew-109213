Godawful! Stay far away. Tastes like random chunks floating in baby food. There are much simpler, much better recipes on this site.

It's interesting - this is the most recent of a number of Irish Stew recipes on the Epicurious site. Each one seems to get a bit more complicated and a bit further away from the traditional version of this dish. I would definitely leave off the blanching, unless that milder colour and flavour is really something you want. The Cook from Seattle asked why one would want to reduce the strong flavour - obviously, with lamb you wouldn't, but many of us would be more likely to use mutton or hogget (inbetween lamb and mutton in age) for our stews, and there you might, if you had a particularly strongly flavoured piece, want to reduce the flavour. If you are in Australia, and can get a piece of saltbush hogget, it makes for a special and distinctly Australian Irish Stew. I wouldn't make this again, though it was okay as far as it went. I much prefer the old school recipe from 1963, with barley and dumplings.

great dish not too difficult to prepare makes a rather bland stew something special.Blanching gives the meat an interesting more engrained flavour-meat was beautifully tender and the base or stock is worth the extra prep effort. worth checking out.

For heavens sakes! Don't water down the taste of the lamb - mutton, perhaps, but only perhaps. The cooking time and flavouring veggies adds to the rich taste of the meat and I think this recipe gives full flavour and homely taste to a stew that is often far too bland. I would still prefer lightly frying the meat beforehand.

My Dublin parents would have wondered where the dumplings went. A lot of time could be saved without two kinds of potatoes and the food mill, a little barley would also help.

To try a simplified version of this recipe....brown the lamb in butter and put into large ovenproof bowl with all other ingrediants (add thyme and barley if you wish)add enough water to nearly cover, pop lid on & cook in the oven for 3 hrs on 300 degrees frnht. Serve with crusty bread. It is one of those recipes you can put on before going out for the afternoon.

The recipe is good but where is the barley ?? According to my Irish granmother Irish Stew has barley in it. A handfull or two of it. Please do not kill the taste of the lamb which is the whole mening of the stew

Sorry, I haven't tried this recipe (looks good!) but I have a question for the cook from Albuquerque. Why on earth would you want to reduce the "strong" flavor of lamb? It's wonderful just as it is, and there are so many ways to prepare it. Just enjoy!

What a tedious recipe. Now I know why the Ritz-Carlton is so expensive- it's all extra folks they have to hire to make this Irish Stew! Save yourself about an hour and skip the food mill step; instead simply discard about 2/3 of the veggies and puree the rest in a processor with the cooking liquid. I'd cut back on the boiling onions as well. Another good tip for the lamb (or any gamey meat) is to soak it in milk for a day before cooking it to remove some of the strong flavor. Overall, not a horrible basic recipe for Irish Stew, but huge points subtracted for the prep.
