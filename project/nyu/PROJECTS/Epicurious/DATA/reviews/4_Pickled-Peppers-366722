Today I just completed my fourth batch of the wonderful peppers in just one month. My only changes would be to make certain that your jar is hot before putting in the peppers and pouring in the solution. Also make a little extra liquid and what you don't use save for next time. There will be a next time.

I'm a bit unsure about this recipe. I've made pickled peppers from century-old recipes that swear that you must fry the peppers until fully cooked before pickling since partially-cooked peppers can harbor loads of bacteria. I wouldn't keep these for more than a week unless you cook them thoroughly first.
