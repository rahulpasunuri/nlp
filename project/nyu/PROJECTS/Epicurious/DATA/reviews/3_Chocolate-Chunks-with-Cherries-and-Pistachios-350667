Maybe it's better with bittersweet chocolate. I used semi-sweet because that's what I had and these turned out pretty gross.

I thought this was a good recipe even if not quite the gourmet quality of most Epicurious recipes. It needs to chill much longer than 1 hour. Also, I dusted the with confectioners sugar which made it easier to cut.

I couldn't find dried cherries so I used dried cranberries. Still yummy!

I haven't made this as written, but I agree with the other poster that said it looks at the outset like it would not work. I make something similar every year at Christmas with whatever chocolate I have left over after dipping pretzels, etc. Just use your favorite brand of chocolate, temper it, and stir in the cherries and pistachios. Drop into clusters. Let them dry. No need to add anything like milk or oil to the chocolate, it takes like 5 minutes, and uses up leftovers.

Thanks to the previous reviews, I made a major change and used melted dark chocolate instead of the Baker's chocolate, milk and butter. I used salted, preshelled pistachios and omitted the salt, as well. The chunks are delicious and a good balance of texture and flavor between the cherries, nuts, and good, imported, dark chocolate.

Disclaimer: I have not attempted this recipe but, as an experienced chocolate maker, I can already see what's wrong with it. The biggest problem here is that the recipe calls for ingredients which have a high water content, namely butter, or if you substituted, milk. Chocolate is a fat-based item, and water will congeal your product and bind it into stiff goo, or cause a film/extruded material/bloom to appear on the surface of the chocolate after cooling. To do it properly, you would need to obtain actual cocoa butter, which is used to 'dilute' the chocolate into a smooth, workable mixture that you can toss the pistachios and cherries into. It does not have water like regular butter, and is derived from the same plant, which allows it cool more homogeneously and with a smoother mouth-feel.. To use, melt a small cube (as needed) in the microwave for a short time (caution, it gets *very* hot), and pour the solution into the chocolate as it's heating (using a double boiler). The best bet to find cocoa butter is at local confectionery, or the internet. I hope this helps, good luck chocolatiers! :)

This was delicious, but I had a problem with it too. I substituted light cream for milk because I happened to have a lot on hand. I also used 8 oz. bittersweet and 4 oz. milk choc (personal preference.) The pieces were fine when refrigerated but got very soft at room temp. I will try again with milk because this was really good.

I had a problem with this recipe. When it was chilled, the butter hardened on the outside making it pretty unappetizing. I tossed the batch I made and went with a recipe on this site that is similar - but no added butter and milk with much better results. The taste was fine - but something was off.

Made these for gift baskets for Xmas everyone loved them. Use the best chocolate you can get.

Amazing! Trader Joe's has the best price on the chocolate by far. They also carry the pistachios (already shelled) and the dried cherries. I gave it to co-workers in decorative tins for Christmas and it was a hit.
