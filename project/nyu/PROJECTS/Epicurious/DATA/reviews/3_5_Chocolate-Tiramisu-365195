Excellent! If using soft lady fingers, brush with coffee. If using crispy, then dunk, otherwise the soft lady fingers will absorb too much coffee.

I made this in coffee mugs and it was great. Though I needed more of the espresso syrup for the amount of soft ladyfingers.

I have made this twice and both times everyone raved about it. I made it in a large trifle dish rather than individual cups and had great results. I would, however, recommend you have extra lady fingers on hand if you make a bigger version of this. This recipe will go in the permanent collection!
