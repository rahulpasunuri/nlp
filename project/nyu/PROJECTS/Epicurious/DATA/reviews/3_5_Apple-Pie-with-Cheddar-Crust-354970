The pie this recipe produces is OK--not great--and the recipe requires some tinkering depending on the apples used. I used Xtra Xtra Sharp cheese in the crust & Gala apples. I also added some cinnamon & nutmeg, but they nearly overwhelmed the cheese. The apples cooked down a lot, and left a large space between the filling & the top crust; next time I'll do a savory cheese-crumb topping instead of the top crust.

This was delicious! Loved the savory bite of the cheddar with the sweet/tart apples (I used Granny Smith and Honey Crisp). Like others I added my favorite apple pie spices - cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg. Crust was flakey, even held up against my extra juicy apples.

Delicious! I made this for a potluck and it was gone in 10 minutes and I got lots of compliments. The crust was fun to make and came out beautifully - I had some extra that I baked and devoured plain - yum! I did modify the filling since I like to put in nutmeg, cinnamon, and ginger, and I added an extra granny smith apple (and could have added a second extra for a total of 8 apples).

I think that this is a great apple pie recipe for people who don't like apple pie. Generally, I find fruit pies to be too sweet, but I like how the savory crust on this pie gives balance to the sweetness. The only change that I made to the recipe was that I used 4 Gala apples and 2 Granny Smiths, instead of the 3:3 ratio. I really enjoyed the resulting clean apple flavour against the savory crust.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and it was loved by all. The crust was flaky and flavorful and the apple filling wasn't to overspiced like some apple pies can be. It was the first pie to be finished off. I think I'll try making some apple turnovers with this recipe.

This pie is delicious! My husband loves apple pie, especially the kind with the crumbly topping, but after eating this one, he might have a new favorite! I'll definitely be serving this one for Thanksgiving!

I've always loved eating apples with cheese as a snack so I thought this sounded really good. When I made this, I only had Gala apples and it was delicious. The crust is awesome, way better than traditional apple pies in my opinion.

This was my first pie! I'm not a baker...baking intimidates me, so I tend to stay away. My friend brought me back some apples that she picked in MI, so I was inspired!! I followed the recipe to a T and thet pie turned out really well...so yummy! Took me longer than I had thought, but I am a beginer. I was hoping that the cheddar crust would be a little stronger, next time I will add more cheese! Cheers.

The crust is great but the creamy cheddar does nothing to cut the tartness of the apples. I will make this again but next time I will use all Gala or gingergolds (no Granny Smiths) and I will use the traditional apple pie spices. I did not find the crust to be too thick when made with a stand mixer.

Skeptical, I made this pie because my husband thought it sounded good. He agreed we should have gone with my instinct. We found the cheese crust too heavy (and noticed that one of our guests didn't eat it). I used Galas and Macouns, and found the Galas too sweet. I'm with the first reviewer who prefers the traditional apple pie spices. It's hard to ruin a homemade apple pie in New England in September, but this recipe did.

I give this 3 forks because I didn't care for it, but my husband and guests did. The crust, with the addition of cheese, turns out very flaky. I didn't care for the cheesiness of the crust, but my cheese-loving friends couldn't get enough. I was not excited about the filling as written, so added traditional apple pie spices. It's worth trying. I think I'd maybe try the crust with a shepherd's pie or other savory pie/tart. I just didn't love it with the apples.
