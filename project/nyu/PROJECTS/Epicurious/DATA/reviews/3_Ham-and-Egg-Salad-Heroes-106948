"Purchased egg salad" Epicurious you should be ashamed

Rating: 3
Eggs had been on sale and I was looking for ways to use them and also a way to get my husband to eat egg salad sandwiches. He liked the flavors and the addition of ham. It was a nice summertime lunch. I didn't have rolls, so I used toasted whole wheat bread. Next time I will use rolls and maybe hollow them out a little bit on the bottom so the egg filling doesn't fall out.
