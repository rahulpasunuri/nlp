Although we now live in Pennsylvania, my wife is from the Southwest. As such, I often seek out recipes which remind her of the mexican influence on her native Texan cuisine. I have made this recipe several times. We love it. Prep everything ahead of time. Break up the chorizo as it cooks (here in Philadelphia, "Premio" is a pretty good brand. It comes in 16 ounce packages, and makes a little more, but extras are a good thing to have on the day after.). I never use pre-grated cheese because of the additives used to keep the stuff from sticking together; a 50-50 blend of Cabot jack and cheddar work perfectly. Good quality tortillas are a must since the cheaper ones do not becone pliable enough to form a nice wrap; here, we use Nature's Promise burrito-size tortillas from Giant. The salsa we use is Mrs. Renfro's, which is a little hotter and bolder than most canned tomatillo salsas or salsa verdes. Be generous with the cilantro, especially if your salsa verde is spicy.

had these this morning, and it was pretty alright, but there was something missing. I followed the recipe directly, but it could have used something a little extra for zest.. maybe a different kind of salsa, or a sweet chilli sauce. the avocado balances the chorizo out nicely, and I should have put the meat in a strainer to let all the extra oil drain out. would like to try it again with advice from the community. I got my chorizo from the new seasons deli so maybe it was how they spiced it.. I could see the type of chorizo playing pretty big into the flavor profile.

This is a great recipe and a pleasant change for breakfast. I've made it twice exactly as specified. My kids don't like the avocados...but the grown ups do!

Had leftover chorizo and cilantro I wanted to use before it expired so found this recipe and was pleasantly surprised! Didn't have the tomatillo salsa or avocado. Deliciously bold flavours; a great substitute for breakfast sasauge/bacon! Have made it again!
