Easy, tasty. Perfect for a week night meal. To pop the flavors, I served it with a wedge of lemon to squeeze on at the table.

Very tasty marinade! I skipped the sugar (forgot it, whoops!) and used vegetable oil instead of olive oil because that's what I had. We all really liked this combination of flavors. Next time I'll bump up the cayenne or add another kind of chili to increase the heat.

Without access to a grill, I decrease the amount of oil by at least half, toss the chicken with the oily spice mixture in a baking dish, then bake at 450, for 40min. The chicken is so juicy and tender and flavorful. Served with the large pearl (Isreali) cous cous. I've made this lots of times now and it's always a hit at home and with company.

A good weeknight dish, will make this again but I will admit that it was not exceptional. I used a little less than 1/2cup oil and it was still too much.

I use this recipe on roasted game hens as well. Coat and roast two per Pyrex 9 x 13 inch baking dishes at 400 degrees for 1 hour. Perfect with the Morrocan Vegetables and Coucous recipe. Definitely cut back on the oil, but great otherwise!

wonderful. fantastic flavors. so easy. was able to get the chicken marinated, and prepare Persian Rice Salad (from this site, went very well with this dish) within my 2 year old's 1:15 nap. added a little extra sugar, cumin and doubled the cayenne. added cardamom, just for fun. you wouldn't need to unless you wanted to. used 28 oz of chicken tenders, which fit perfectly in a 9x13 pan. baked it at 350, for 20 min with foil on, then 10 min without foil. so tender. would be great in chicken salad. would also be a great marinade for tofu. this will be a staple.

Loved the flavor of this. I used chicken tenders, let them marinate overnight and they grilled nicely. I also threw in some garlic (because there's never enough garlic in anything).

Rating: 4
Very simple and excellent flavor. I used 8 boneless chicken breasts and marinated overnight. I cut the salt in half and added a little black pepper as well. Next time I'll probably add a little more cayenne that this calls for because we like it hot, but the recipe is good as is. Will definitely make again. Serve with Grilled Zucchini & Red Pepper Fattoush (another favorite from this site). Colorful, flavorful, healthy and easy to prepare!

I cut the oil down to a fourth of a cup and filled in the rest of the liquid with water. The dish was still good, though I think using some type of alcohol (like beer) next time would help the marinade permeate the meat better. The flavors were great.

I made this as written. Maybe reducing the amount of oil might have helped a bit. I prefer the Grilled Chicken with North African Spica Paste from this site much better. More flavorful and the grilling really enhances the spices.

Easy indeed. Very flavorful as well. A nice twist on chicken but did not get rave reviews from the younger critics in the family

Rating: 4
Easy easy easy, ingredients are easy to keep on hand. I also cut the oil back and I added some garlic and a single green serrano pepper (what I had on hand for kick) the second time I made it...good both times. Broiling thighs I found produced good flavor, but the cuts were ugly...I actually had a better result doing boneless, skinless chicken breasts and then baking them in parchment paper for 30 minutes at 350...so moist, even as leftovers!

Rating: 4
Absolutely Fantastic! I took the advice of others and cut the oil way down, and added a bit more of all of the spices. My friends didn't stop talking about it for the next 2 hours (really!). My mom, who is a natural foods chef, raved about it when I made it for her too! WONDERFUL for pairing with a fresh, bright seeded cukee and tomato salad and some cous cous. Perfect on the grill or in the broiler! TRY THIS!!! :)

This was amazing... I used skinless boneless chicken thighs. I made the marinade in the morning and let them marinate all day... Threw them on the Grill when I got home from work and served them with sweet potatoe fries. I used the leftovers in a salad the next day. Delicious!... I will be sure to make enough for leftovers in the future

I agree- great recipe- best to cut the oil by a third and cook 11 minutes per side for thighs.Very moist.

If you are looking for a marinated and grilled chicken recipe, I suggest you look no further. This one is so fine. We had to drag ourselves away fom the table in order to stop eating! I concur with others who suggest using only 1/2 cup of oil. It's plenty. The sugar in the marinade allows the chicken to become wonderfully crispy so don't skimp on the grilling time.

My husband said this was the best grilled chicken he ever had. I marinated boneless and skinless chicken thighs overnight, then grilled. Even better cold the next day.

This is a staple for easy summer entertaining in our house. It consistently pleases all ages. We use boneless skinless chicken breasts and serve w/ ORZO, FETA, AND TOMATO SALAD WITH MARJORAM VINAIGRETTE (recipe on this site). Delicious.

Had a religious experience whilst savoring this recipe. Incredible'! Only changes (concur with many other chefs): only use 1 tsp salt, inrease cayenne a touch, add 1/2 tsp cardoman, toss in some whole coriander seeds for flavour bursts, cut oil by half, be daring and add some nutmeg. Try cilantro instead of parsley

So easy, so wonderful! I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts and my husband and I both cleaned our plates. Great combination of flavors. This will be eaten often at our house!

Has anyone tried this with boneless / skinless chicken breasts? Just wondering if it would work well for grilling that type of chicken. Thanks!

We make this recipe several times a month as a grilled chicken staple. It's a winner. Simple, wonderful flavors -- for the family or casual company. Perfect over couscous or a salad. Have also used this recipe as a formulas for other spice/flavor combinations by modifying the spices (Mexican Oregano, garlic, cloves, cinnamon and chilli powder with apple cider vinegar for different twist).

Forgot to add- I used skinless chicken thighs and used about half the oil called for. I broiled it in the oven due to the weather- worked fine.

Everyone really loved this. My 14 year old ate 3 pieces- practically inhaled it. I thought it was very good but I might add more heat next time. The leftover chicken I deboned and made into an incredible chicken salad (mayo,celery,scallions,lemon juice, toasted almonds, grapes, apple)

Yummy and tender. Used boneless, skinless chichen breasts and served with couscous, and lots of grilled vegies. Will use a tad less vinegar next time.

Rating: 4
This one's a keeper. Absolutely the BEST chicken recipe. Make with the couscous recipe that accompanied, grill some veggies, and you've got a wonderful meal. I make it just as prescribed, no changes. Note that it's far better cooked over charcoal than propane grill, if you can, as charcoal imparts a smokier flavor.

I didn't use as much oil as it's called in the recipe and substituted red wine vinegar with regular balsamic vinegar. The chicken came out really juicy and delicious.

I made it for a bbq party past weekend and everyone loved it. It was so juicy and tasty. I added fresh chopped onion, chili powder, salt and pepper. Also, I didn't have red wine vinegar so I substituted with white wine vinegar. I definitely keep this recipe.

This recipe has become a summer BBQ special - always a simple crowd pleaser. I prefer to use only chicken thighs however as they are more tender.

Rating: 3
Delicious! Very flavorful and juicy chicken. In Sweden, I can only get thighs and legs with the bone in and skin on (unless I want to cut one up myself), so that is what I used. I made the full amount of marinade, following the recipe except that I ran out of cumin and only had one tablespoon. I only used 4 legs and 4 thighs, and marinated for about 5 hours in a zip lock bag (smuggled from The US:-)) My husband basted the meat a little during grilling over indirect heat. Another of those rare Keeper recipes!

Rating: 4
Loved the flavors! Used only thighs on an indoor electric grill that is part of my range. It wouldn't stop bleeding! It took over an hour to get 7 thigh pieces done all the way through. Still, it was worth the wait. I served them with a Persian-inspired rice made with orange peels, pistachios, butter and sugar. My husband, our guest and I all really enjoyed it.

We made this yesterday and it was very tasty. We used all drumsticks (a package of 9) because that's what we had on hand. With 3/4 cup of oil, there was a little marinade left over but not much.

I did not do the sauce for the chicken, but I added the other 8 ingridients and also added salt, garlic, and onion powder. It was delicious. Next time I will only add 1/2 a cup of oil. Due to bad weather I broiled the chicken at 400 F for 55 minutes.

This recipe did not please my palate. All the spices made my place smell like BO for a week!

Due to bad weather we weren't able to grill, so I roasted the split chicken breasts in the oven at 400 degrees for approximately 45-50 minutes, draining the accumulated juices from the roasting pan after the first 30 minutes of cooking. They came out beautifully; very tender and flavorful, and the higher heat helped the skin crisp up and brown nicely. We served with moroccan-spiced carrots and couscous. We were very happy with the results, and will definitely make this again.

The chicken was delicious. Served it on fourth of july. Used chicken breast and with all the spices it was very flavorful.

This was quite good. Used 1/2 c. oil, slightly less of all the spices & boneless, skinless chix thighs. Marinaded in 9x13 pyrex 4 hours, then I popped the pyrex in the oven at 375 degrees for about 15 minutes, then put on the grill for 5 min per side to finish. Tender, tasty, nice grill marks. Easy for family, but not fancy enough for company (thighs aren't that pretty).

This recipe was little work for a lot of flavour! The marinade seemed too "vinegarie" but when we barbequed the boneless chicken breasts they were mouth watering tender and delicious. We would definitely make this again. Like Meghan from Hopewell NJ, we served it with couscous.

I used the coriander-cumin mixed powder that I bought at Indian market. This powder has 1-1 ratio of coriander and cumin, but chicken came out so great! Instead of BBQ, I roasted them in the oven. I'm gonna try them BBQ next time.

My boyfriend said this was the best chicken I had ever made--and I agree! Couldn't beat it for how easy it was, and it was truly yummy. I cut the marinade ingredients in half and had plenty for one 4-pound cut-up chicken.

This dish has become a staple since I first made it a few months ago. If you don't know what to do with chicken, this is a reliable, totally delicious recipe. Of course, you have to like cumin, coriander and cinnamon! If you don't, obviously this is not the dish for you. I make this with skinless breasts and really cut down on the olive oil. It is not quite as delectable that way but still wonderful and low fat. I love this with glazed carrots and plain rice--its so flavorful it makes everything taste fantastic.

I 'grilled' this chicken in my oven, on a wire rack above a drip pan. My husband loved it! I think I would cut the sugar in half next time as I thought it was a tad too sweet, but I'll definitely make this recipe again.

I've made this recipe twice before and everytime I've made it it has gotten rave reviews. I personally would recommend sticking exactly to the recipe and not using skinless or boneless chicken. The skin keeps the meat moist and the oil-based marinade can make the bbq flair up considerably, risking burning the meat if it isn't protected. I also made this dish with the golden couscous recipe from july 2003 bon appetit and it was perfect.

Rating: 4
My husband and I made this last Sunday night paired with the Couscous Salad with Dates and Almonds (see recipe on Epicurious) It was a huge hit! We used the skinless, boneless chicken breasts only as we don't really like dark meat chicken and it worked very well. We loved the spices and the chicken was so tender-even though we didn't marinate it as long as the recipe indicated. It was so good we are serving it to guests at our next dinner party this weekend. The only thing I may do different next time is use half the amount of salt-just a personal preference. This was an easy, tasty way to prepare chicken and was wonderful with the Couscous salad.

Marinated this for 7 hours, used chicken breasts as someone suggested, and it was very flavorful and not overbearing either.

I would definitely add some authentic Pita and yogurt next time.
