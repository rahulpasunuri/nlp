Why is this called "toasted" ravioli??? It's FRIED. Gross.

This is a BIG thing in St. Louis, MO. Like I'm surprised that it's even on here, EVERYONE should try this dish!!!

To be honest, I'm surprised these are rated so highly. Total yawn-fest in my opinion. I made this recipe because I had some frozen ravioli hanging around and needed good dishes for entertaining, and while these were eaten by my guests I was pretty bored with them. Essentially the ravioli is a vehicle for breading/frying but the breading overwhelms the delicate flavor and texture of ravioli which essentially renders the pasta unnecessary. What a waste of fresh ravioli! Make some arancini if you need to eat fried food and then serve the fresh ravioli on their delicious lonesome.

You do not need the evaporated milk. I used milk (and have used creamer in other cases) to achieve a similar effect. Incredibly easy to make and absolutely delicious. Although I did doctor the bred crumbs. I added a little whole wheat flower (to just increase total volume), lots of garlic powder, oregano, basil, and parmissan (sp?) cheese. WIll use this over and over.

I'm originally from St Louis, MO but currently live in New York. I made these as an appetizer for Thanksgiving dinner. They are SO GOOD! So simple to make. I will be making them again in the very near future. The Pasta House better watch its back!

These little gems make a wonderful appetizer. I baked at 350 for 10 minutes on each side. For variety use ravioli with several fillings.

Since a reviewer mentioned this recipe was a little bland, I added some things to the Italian bread crumbs: about 1 tsp of extra Italian seasoning (dried herb mixture), 1 tbsp of Parmesan cheese and about 1 tbsp of granulated garlic. It was very flavorful. I used Celentano frozen cheese ravioli, both large rounds and the mini rounds, and I think the smaller ones work better. The larger ravioli seemed to become a little more tough with cooking, since they are larger and take longer in the oil. I did not wait for them to thaw; just ran the ravioli under some cold water and let them sit out for about 15 minutes and they were fine. I didn't use a thermometer but kept the burner at heat mark 6 or 7. Also I used about 2 cups of vegetable oil and fried them in groups of 4-6. Finally I used Bertolli Olive Oil & Garlic Marinara, which was the perfect dipping sauce. These were better than the ones I've had in restaurants.

This was simple, and everyone loved them. I suggest using ravioli with flavorful filling as ours were a bit bland. Also, open the box/bag to see how they are packaged. I let mine thaw only to realize they were set in sheets that would have been easy to break apart while frozen but took forever once thawed.

I served this dish at a baby shower with lots of finger foods. I heated the marinara in a fondu pot, put out tooth picks for the ravioli, and the presentation was nice. The recipe was a huge hit. These ravioli are delicious. I will definately make them again and again!!!

This just didn't do it for us. We used cheese ravioli - once fried, the inside was just a little, almost non-existant ball of cheese & ravioli were almost hollow. Thinking they were cooked too long, I tried cooking them less - same result. Maybe it would be better with a meat filling (?).

Loved this recipe as did my guests. Served it as a first course-3 per person. I did dredge and coat about an hour before frying and then refrigerated. It makes an impressive presentation when individually plated with the marinara on one side, ravioli on the other, and then all sprinkled with parmesan and chopped basil. Will serve again during the upcoming holidays.

I have made this recipe several times. Everyone always loves it. To the reviewer who said that this recipe should not even be on this site- I find it is nice to use purchased ingredients for an appetizer when you are making a more elaborate dinner.

I was thrilled to see this recipe because an old friend from St. Louis used to make them for parties and I hadn't had them in years. I liked it because it is different and a novelty at parties in the New England. Dip and bread all the ravioli's BEFORE you start to fry. It is to difficult to do both at the same time. The bread crumbs need to be fine, so add small amounts at a time to the dish. After frying, I put them in a preheated oven set at 200 degrees to keep warm until time to serve.

What's this recipe doing on this website? Good reviews, but c'mon......purchased bread crumbs, frozen ravioli, purchased marinara? Why not go for the boxed parmesan or, simply buy from your local pizza shop?

I'm originally from St. Louis, and I'm thrilled to see a piece of The Hill make its way outside of that small town. This recipe was pretty authentic and tasted great. Please note, mini or bite-sized raviolis are the way to go - full sized ones will not be adequately cooked in the short time it takes the "crust" to brown. Don't skimp on the quality of the marinara.

I made this dish as an appetizer for an Italian progressive dinner party - they were they first thing gone from the table! A huge hit!

As a St Louis native, I was thrilled to find my favorite appetizer on this site. It is definitly a dish I recomend to anyone looking for authentic regional cuisine.

This is a classic from the Hill, the Italian neighborhood in St. Louis, Missouri. There are several companies that produce frozen prebreaded ravioli for home cooking, and these days many of them are oven ready as well. Traditionally they are filled with meat, but cheese filled ones are also available.

I really enjoyed making this one and my guests enjoyed them too, there wasn't a single one left. Very easy, just make sure the oil is 350 degrees.

This was very good and very easy. I have also spritzed them with olive oil and baked them at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes. Also very tasty and less fat.

This recipe is very easy, especially if you have a deep fat fryer. I love fried mozzarella sticks, but they tend to leak - these are very similar, but no mess. Served with marinara.

These are very good. Be sure not to let the oil get too hot. The lighter brown ones were great. I cooked some to fast and they got too dark. Not as good. I would make this again.

Made a wonderful appetizer for a small party I hosted. I served it with a tangy marinara sauce loaded with garlic, which ameliorated the flavor quite nicely. My guests have raved about them ever since. I will definitely be making them again...most likely for an upcoming wine and tapas party I am planning.

When I lived in St Louis, MO many restaurants served this dish. I admit I haven't really searched for it, but I have not seen it on any menues here in Mikwaukee. I made it tonight and it was better than I can remember in the old days.

Quick, easy and very good.
