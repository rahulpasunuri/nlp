This recipe was fantastic. Three adults and two kids ate the entire thing. Added a sprinkling of powdered sugar over the top; some people ate it with syrup instead but all loved it. I accidentally let the bread sit for too long on one side when it was soaking, so I recommend monitoring that to make sure the two sides soak up evenly because the fluid goes quickly. In the end, it didn't matter much, though - still tasted very good.

I made this for my roommates this morning because we had whole milk left over and needed to use some of it. Out of cost/laziness I didn't make the sauce, but this french toast is so good on its own. I've never made french toast before and I think it turned out really well. Like some of the other reviews, I agree that you need more soaking liquid. I only made 8 pieces of toast and barely had enough to soak all 8. Overall it was easy to make and delicious, definitely recommend it!

I used a vanilla challah. Wonderful!

Wonderful! Made this with stale pannetone, which definitely takes it to another level. Also doubled the sugar and added 1 t. vanilla.

Very easy. Very, very good. Made it without putting into the oven to finish off and it was extremely good. Did not make the Berry Sauce but served with strawberries and fresh whipped cream.

I made this for Christmas brunch, and it was very good. I liked the berry sauce very much, but everyone else opted to top their French toast with pure maple syrup. I served it with fresh fruit salad and crispy bacon.

Delicious. If you can't find challah bread locally, you can buy it online from http://challahnmore.com

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but plan on making it for Valentine's Day breakfast for my sweetie! I want to add vanilla and cinnamon to the batter. Sprinkle brown sugar on the outside to make it crispy, place two pieces together and put cream cheese or mascarpone in the middle, then bake. I also want to make the berry sauce out of frozen berries and a hit of grand marnier, garnish with fresh berries and serve it with a creme anglaise. So delicious sounding!

great recipe but i tweaked it a bit. i added maple syrup, vanilla and cinnamon to my egg batter and then before baking it added sliced bananas and a sprinkle of brown sugar to crisp it up a bit. was delish, next time i'll add some pecans as well, or maybe sandwich the bananas and pecans between the slices with cream cheese before battering and baking.

This came out very well. My husband really loved it. I think in the future, I'll serve with a little maple syrup because I like that level of sweetness.

Yum! I doubled the sugar and added a teaspoon of vanilla. I used homemade challah (for an amazing recipe, see "My Challah" on this site.) Very tasty.

Made this for visiting family on the weekend (and now's the perfect time since berry season is here!). I used a cinnamon-swirled brioche bread and added extra cinnamon to the egg mixture. I also mixed the berry sauce ingredients in a saucepan and cooked them on the stove until they softened, instead of pureeing half the berries. This was an excellent dish and I'll definitely make it again for brunch.

My family loves this french toast! I added some orange zest and a little orange juice. We are serving brunch for 40 next weekend so I have been test cooking. The cooked french toast freezes well; after thawing, my husband laid foil on the BBQ grill, heated it to 300 or so and in 5 mins we heated a couple of dozen slices!

VERY easy and the best french toast I've ever had. I thought the berry sauce was great but after some reviewers said it was a bit too sweet, I only put in 1 tbsp. of sugar. I didn't have whole milk so I used 1% and only had regular whole grain bread. Still was WONDERFUL and the presentation is amazing!

Yummy! Unlike others, we loved the sauce. Also, I added a little cinnamon and vanilla to the batter.

Ok, here is the take. My peeps liked the berry sauce more than the toast, and plans of pouring it over icecream ensued. I thought the toast was good myself. Everyone felt the sauce as is was a little tart, so i added some maple syrup to cut the tartness. seems like more people prefer just syrup to anything fancy shmancy, but I love the berry sauce! MMM... Also, challah bread rocks for french toast, the wisdom is in the properties of the finished product. Oh, and I ran out of the batter, so maybe make some extra. I used a ziplock to pipe some sauce in a pattern on the plate, and finished with the powdered sugar. Very good.

I liked this, it was easy and impressive. I too like the baked pecan blueberry french toast, but this requires less advance planning. I also found that there was not enough soaking liquid, so would add more next time, as well as slicing the bread a bit thicker than 1/2 inch.

I made this for Easter brunch and it was really good. I didn't follow the exact recipe for the egg/milk mixture, but pretty close. I also only soaked the bread for about one minute before browning it. It keeps nicely in the oven so after it was baked I turned down the temp. to 225 to keep it warm. I also followed someone else's suggestion and used mixed frozen berries for the puree and then added fresh berries. I like a warm syrup so I heated the puree and added a touch of Grand Marnier. Delicious!!! Challah is by far the best bread for french toast.

I served this for our first snowfall breakfast, the sauce was wonderful!!! I liked using the griddle and then it puffing up in the oven. Make it great for batches. This is a hit, please don't pass it by.

Absolutely wonderful. I am thrilled to have finally figured out what it takes to make good french toast. Browning it first and then baking it leaves a crispy outer shell, with a light , almost fluffy (but not bready) cooked(!) interior. We loved the fruit topping, but this would also be awesome with a banana/rum/brown sugar topping as well. Use challah bread if you can.

Okay, I added double the amount of eggs because I sliced the bread thick. Absolutely wonderful. I have had repeated requests to make this again and again. This is a keeper, for sure. I also made the sauce the night before, so making the french toast in the morning was a breeze.

I thought this french toast was excellent. The challah really makes it. I sometimes use raisin challah which works as well.

My family enjoyed this recipe. I made it exactly as written with the exception of adding a tsp of vanilla to the egg mixture. I prepared the berry mixture the night before so fixing the toast in the morning was pretty quick.

Hey! I thought that this was my recipe! :P I've been making this for years, topped with my spin on a strawberry/blueberry/raspberry romanoff. Sometimes I add an almond "romanoff" topping as well, depending on my mood. I wouldn't follow the directions exactly - esp. for the egg. This is something that needs to be "tweaked" with until you find what works the best for you - so much of it is dependent on the type of bread you use, how thick it's sliced, how long you let it sit in the egg, etc. etc. However, I have found that Challah is THE best for french toast...

I was very disappointed in this recipe as is. Also found that even after weighing the bread for accuracy and following the ingredient list exactly, there really wasn't enough egg batter for the bread to absorb. I ended up making more so there would be enough. I thought the Baked Pecan-Blueberry French Toast on this sight was far superior.

The challah bread makes a big difference. We only soaked the bread for a minute and baked them for 10 minutes to get them fully cooked throughout. A big hit and will make for others when they come over.

One of the best!!

I made this as a stuffed French Toast by using two slices of challah bread, spreading a favorite cream cheese on one slice and a favorite jelly, jam or preserve on the other. Slap together like a sandwich and dip in the egg mixture, place in skillet and continue with directions given. For topping use fruit, a fruit sauce, or a favorite syrup. A fresh blueberry or raspberry sauce is great.

Yumm! I didn't feel like getting my food processor dirty so I skipped pureeing half the berries and put approx 2 Tbsp of Grand Marnier on top of lemon juice to dissolve sugar. Was very tasty! Will definately make again.

I made this for Father's Day Brunch. Delicious and the presentation was beautiful! I added about a teaspoon of vanilla to the egg batter and it was great. To cut down on cost, use frozen berries for the sauce and then add fresh berries on top. Definitely will make again.

Soooo easy! I used frozen berries and thawed them out over night in lemon juice. Would make it any day. Great Sunday meal.

I made this for my sister and family when they came to vist. It was excellent. My brother in law who dosen't like fruit on dishes tasted it and went back for more. I made a mistake and put the dip in too small of a bowl so I quickly made another batch in another bowl to soak the rest of the bread I cut the bread 1 inch thick and used butter milk. It work out well

I made this for a family brunch marking the beginning of our vacation, and the results were festive in both appearance and flavor. It was easy, too! I was a bit concerned that the half inch slices called for in the recipe would be too thin, but the bread puffed up nicely in the cooking process. It took a bit of tasting and fooling around with adding sugar, and ultimately, more lemon, to get the sauce right, but it was worth it. Finally, I made this with skim milk, which usually is all I have in the house, and it worked out fine.
