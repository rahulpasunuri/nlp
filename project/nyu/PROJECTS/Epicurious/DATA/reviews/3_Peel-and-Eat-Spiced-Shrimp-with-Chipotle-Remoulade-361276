Everyone loved it! I made the Chipotle Remoulade exactly to the recipe - for the shrimp I used Zatarins seafood boil to directions on package (took about 5 minutes), quick and eazy - even the kids loved it!!!

I was concerned there is no acid in the broth. I would add lemon (chop whole lemon) or white wine. Also you have to cook the water. A good simmer or low boil 20 minutes at least. Too much salt. I add shrimp to boiling boil and quickly bring it to a boil (checking on them with gently stir slotted spoon) when boil returns turn off and cover off heat and steep Remove when done. (Carefully check at five minutes.) Time depends on size of shrimp. Drain then place on ice if you must. Most important is to cook the water.

The Boil was lacking. I feel like the shrimp didn't absorb much flavor. The Remoulade was a different story. It made the dish. I'm going to try it again with ground spices.

Try grinding the spices before putting them in the water if you want more flavor in the shrimp. Also letting them soak in the liquid for a while after adding the ice will increase the transfer of flavor.

Nice recipe but I was a little disapointed with how little flavour from the broth transfered over to shrimp.

This gave a whole new meaning to peel and eat shrimp. I would not change a thing.
