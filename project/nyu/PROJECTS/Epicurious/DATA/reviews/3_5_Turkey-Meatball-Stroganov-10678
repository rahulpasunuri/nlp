Great! Kids love it. Can substitute hamburger for turkey if you want.

The only thing I changed about the recipe was to leave out the sour cream, but it was not a 3 fork recipe like a reviewer below mentioned. I doubled the recipe, quadrupled the mushrooms and sauce, but there was hardly any sauce for the noodles, as the flour thickened it too much, IMO. If I were to make this again, I would add more broth and less flour, so that there is actually a sauce to be had. The meatballs were boring. Nice texture, but needed more spices. This is the only thing I've ever made that they boy didn't have a second helping of, and I'm just trying to figure out how not to waste the leftovers. This dish was not worth the time and almost a waste of ingredients.

Quadrupled the receipe and served this last night for a large dinner party and it was the hit of the evening! Meatballs were very tender and were perfected while simmering in the sauce. Made a few hours ahead and put it in the warming drawer until ready to serve. I served this with mashed potatoes and not noodles and loved it. Did make extra sauce which also served as the gravy to a beef roast and was just perfect! Will definitely make again and again.

This was a very, very tasty. Like others, I doubled the sauce. I also substituted no fat plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream and stirred it into the sauce. will make again for sure.

As far as ground turkey dishes go, this recipe deserves four forks! The meatballs could be improved upon, but the sauce is wonderful! I double the entire recipe (since it just serves 2) and then I also double the sauce. We've had this recipe dozens of time since I first discovered it.

Tasted good but not enough sauce

This was excellent. I'm not sure how anyone that likes stroganov-style could NOT like this one. I even had to improvise a little: substituted a large shallot for a small onion and used panko with a little rice milk to soften for fresh bread crumbs. The meatballs were the best part for sure! This is a keeper.

I thought this was simple and great. (Recipe made without modification other than a little extra olive oil to saute the 'shrooms). I am not sure where the bland comments come from. I like a fiery hot chili as much as anyone, but this was bursting with the flavor of the ingredients. Maybe it comes down to defining the size of a small onion or perhaps the quality of the sherry. My cooking sherry is decent Spanish Fino. I used fresh dill, as I hope the rest of the gang did..... if not then some really fresh dried dill. The sour cream as a condiment was interesting and I liked it, but the dish was good enough without. Its in my recipe box

Rating: 3
On the plus side it is fast, easy, and relatively low cal. However it is bland. It definitely needed some tweaking to make it more interesting. Without additional seasoning it is too one dimensional.

Rating: 1
I am also going to fall into the minority on this one, but this recipe just did not do it for me. The meatballs seemed totally bland and lacking flavor. I grew up with an Italian grandmother and mother and am used to their meatballs bursting with flavor (even the turkey ones), but these were so blah and almost a little bit gross. I have been trying different epicurious recipes every night and each time I pick one with at least 3 1/2 forks. All have been terrific except for this one. On a side note, the noodles tasted pretty good with the mushroom sauce on top and I even threw in a little aioli after I first tasted the dish and realized it was off. This is one I won't make again.

Rating: 4
I thought that the meatballs were a little salty, but the husband loved them. Also, I doubled the amount of sauce and still felt like there could have been a little more. Will probably make more next time. All in all, this was a delicious dish. The dill adds a really nice flavor at the end. The sourcream is a must! I agree with the reviewer below that the sourcream is what really made this dish. Will make again.

Soooo....good. A nice, homestyle meal for your family. Add a dash of salt to the mushroom sauce, and you're set!

Many reviews note that the cooks added Sour Cream to make this recipe more Stoganov. I concur that a dollop of Sour Cream in the sauce makes the flavors come out. Three stars without Sour Cream; four stars with Sour Cream.

Recipe was great. a nice change for meatballs. I made a rue instead of the beurre manié and added milk, parmesan cheese and worchester to the meatballs. I also baked them. I usually freeze the meatballs and take out as needed. I'll make it again b/c it was very easy and especially b/c my husband and toddler liked it.

Rating: 3
Excellent recipe! I was short on time, so I made the turkey mixture into a meatloaf (I had two lbs. of ground turkey breast), and just poured the sauce over it. My partner raved about it and ate several helpings. The sauce tasted marvelous. I'd like to try several variations of the original with ground lamb or pork, then change the chicken broth to beef stock.

Rating: 3
Really nice. Used Marsala instead of sherry, Smart Balance instead of real butter(in an attempt to make this even more healthy) and whole wheat pasta. Did swirl in the sour cream(lo fat, of course)and hubby thought the whole thing was just great.

Rating: 3
My husband volunteered to cook so I had him try this recipe since he loves meatballs. He gives this three forks and I would give him four for effort. Even though the kitchen is not his usual hangout, this turned out great. Next time (he agreed to cook again since this turned out so well!), he plans to double the sauce. He served the meatballs over whole wheat noodles which was a rather tasty and healthy combo. I have a secret mission now, find him spectacular recipes to cook so he feels like a master chef!

My husband responded with "Yum!" after the first bite. Good recipe. I added parmesan and chopped parsley to the meatballs. Also added a bit of chopped bell pepper to the onions. Didn't have the sherry on hand, so used a bit more broth. Turned out great!

Rating: 4
wow. this was absolutely wonderful. i baked the meatballs as suggested by a past reviewer. it hardly mattered-- i would have eaten that sauce poured over dog food, it was that good. and a dollop of sour cream on top added the right amount of cream and tang, as ever. fabulous.

I also just used the recipe for sauce. We had heard that Ikea's meatballs were very good, so thought we would try a new recipe with them. The Ikea meatballs and the sauce recipe (according to the directions, no substitutes) was excellent!! My husband and 2 kids loved it and we will definitely make it again...easy to make and great flavor. We paired it with the suggested buttered egg noodles and green beans...and a nice pinot noir. Definitely recommend it to friends and family!

I rated this on the sauce because I used frozen Swedish meatballs from IKEA. I used beef broth instead of chicken, used an 8 package of presliced mushrooms, and added FF sour cream to the sauce - great flavor, great dinner.

There are a lot of mixed reviews on this one. First, I made the recipe verbatim. I buy quality spices and pepper from Penzey's. I used ground white turkey from a Plainville farms, a purveyor of at least non antibiotic treated birds. I find their ground turkey and whole turkey breasts better than the average. I buy decent stocks (or occasionally make my own). In this case, I used commerical, Pacific Organics.. about half the sodium and 100 times the flavor of College Inn or Swanson). Other than that everything is off the shelf so to speak,. The consitency was right on, plenty of sauce for noodles for two. Just right in my book. Do it right, and you won't have to stir in the sour cream. I found a bit on the side to be a nice twist. Certainly the sauce didn't need it. Dont' over handle any ground meat or it will be tough.

Rating: 1
I realize I'm in a minority, but my family and I didn't like this at all. Made exactly as recipe called for, it's bland, not at all like a stroganoff I was picturing. After a few bites, we all felt a little sick. I think frying the meatballs in the oil first, makes it a bit greasy. The sauce was very thin.

Rating: 3
I used very lean turkey, half the salt called for, and whole milk yogurt instead of sour cream and we loved it.

Rating: 3
Very nice as long as you make some modifications. I took a packet of Lipton beefy onion soup and added half of it to the turkey mixture, then half to the sauce. Added a good dose of parsley to the mix too. I put sour cream in the sauce at the end; a good bit of it. Also, I found that first searing the meatballs and putting them in a crock pot to cook makes the texture really pleasant, and the flavors steep more. The meatballs on their own freeze very nicely.

We loved this dish! I made some changes because of personal preference and because of what I had on hand. I doubled the recipe because my grocery store sells ground turkey in 1 lb.-packages. I also had to cut the mushrooms because my husband detests mushrooms. I pondered what to add for dimension of texture, and I decided on frozen artichoke hearts--- what a winner! I added them (thawed) as I would have added the mushrooms, and they didn't get mushy at all, just wonderfully flavored. I used only a couple of teaspoons of butter. The only thing that went wrong was that I reduced the liquid too much-- there wasn't any sauce to speak of~ Next time, I'll reduce to about 3/4 cup or so. As it stands, I will have to make more sauce for tonight's meal of leftovers. The flavor was delicious. I would easily serve it for company-- well, it isn't all that pretty, so it would go to company that cares more about taste than presentation~

Rating: 3
Very yummy -- my family loved this dish (even the 3 year old). One suggestion: definitely use low salt chicken broth. I didn't have any, and it would be much better next time with it. Also, I added an assortment of mushrooms; cremini, portobello and white. Suggestion: use at least 7% fat ground turkey, all white would be terrible. I got the ground turkey from the butcher. Definitely a repeat recipe. Great on a wintery night.

Rating: 1
Not difficult to make, but it turned out so bland that I will never make it again. Mushrooms turned out well, but meatballs were tasteless. Might be the ground turkey -- not sure why else it wasn't better.

Rating: 1
After rereading all the fabulous reviews, I decided to try this recipe again. My husband said, I remember not liking this the first time, and I still don't! The consistency of the meatballs is weird (chewy). The sauce was only OK, considering we love mushrooms, onions and butter. I'm not sure why this wasn't better. But it was quite time-consuming and not really anything special.

Rating: 3
This is a wonderful dish for a cold winter night. I doubled the amount of mushrooms and sliced the onions (for the sauce) into strips rather chopping them finely. Next time, I will add sour cream directly into the sauce before serving.

Rating: 3
This was great. Very easy. I used portabello mushrooms and baked the meatballs instead of frying. It saved a lot of time by preparing the sauce while the meatballs cooked. I also addded the sour cream (about 2 tsps) to the sauce instead of passing it at the table.

Very good and easy to make. I used a variety of mushrooms to keep it interesting. freezes very well and is great for lunch the next day.

Who knew Stroganov, especially a lower-fat version, could be so good? I doubled this recipe and we ate it two nights in a row. My husband claimed he didn't like stroganov until he tried this. A tip for forming these meatballs quickly and neatly that worked for me: Use a small (1 Tbsp) ice cream/cookie-dough scoop with a lever. You can scoop the turkey mixture right out of the bowl and plop the ball in the pan. I will definitely make this again!

Rating: 3
Different and tasty way to use ground turkey. Thought that the recipe called for too much chicken broth and didn't want runny sauce so cooked down the broth by 1/2 and then added the sherry. The butter and flour combo. gave a nice texture to the sauce also. A keeper for a quick and easy dinner.

Rating: 4
One of my all-time favorites! I work 12 hour days - so this is perfect for me... easy & delicous! Though it is a snap to make (easy enough for a weeknight when coming home at 7.30 or 8pm), this dish is as enjoyable as one that you would slave in the kitchen for! It's become of my regular meals...

We really liked this dish! I made a few changes- used half marsala wine since I ran out of sherry and it was still good. The only problem I had was that since I keep kosher so I made the buerre manie with margarine- it didn't do much to thicken the sauce, though it tasted good anyway. Next time I'll use corn starch to thicken and eliminate the fat.

LOVED this sauce! Made it with regular ground beef, doubled the recipe and tripled the sauce. Added extra sour cream, as I like it a little creamier and extra garlic. I will be making this again, as it has been requested for a birthday dinner!

Absolutely magnificent!! I can't wait to share this recipe! I followed everyone's suggestions: tripled the sauce, used beef broth, added more onions & garlic, and added sour cream & lots of dill at end. I didn't have parsley for the meatballs, but I don't think it could have tasted any better!! Thanks!

Rating: 4
I knew this dish would turn out really well while it was cooking because it smelled great! I doubled the recipe and instead of using chicken broth I used a cup of "Better than Bouillon Beef Base" and I didn't have med-dry sherry so I used half very dry sherry and half cream sherry. The meatballs turned out very well and were very easy to make. I will definately make this frequently.

A great way to eat stroganov and still keep kosher! This tasted great, but I added 3 tbsps of sour cream to get an authentic taste and texture. I was also more liberal with the dill.

This recipe is a WOW! I used shitake mushrooms instead of buttons, added minced parsley to the meatballs, and used all beef broth. Since ground turkey is only sold here in 1 1/4 lb. packages, I tripled the other ingredients and used three skillets to brown the whole batch at one time. More cleanup, but much faster browning time. Definitely increase onions and garlic, and add some garlic to the sauce, too. Stir in one cup lite sour cream at the end...delish!

Just a comment. Have you ever read the FAT content on ground turkey? Very high! The ONLY lowfat turkey, is ground turkey BREAST!!! If you're gonna use reg. ground turkey, you may as well use lean ground BEEF!!! Use "MAVERICK!", it's ground beef that's only 4 grams of FAT per serving! You have to realize that "ground turkey" - as opposed to ground "turkey breast" has mostly DARK meat in it (which is VERY TASTY, but VERY high in FAT!). You are all tricking yourselves when you use regular ground turkey! Either use the ground breast (1 gram of fat per serv.), or use GOOD OL' LOWFAT ground beef!! Just a suggestion!

Made this according to the directions and it was very good. Next time, though, I think I'll double the sauce. Didn't have quite enough, so I had to thin it with sour cream, which was quite good. I'd also recommend adding less bread crumbs - the meatballs were a bit dense. Overall, quite tasty!

This is a great low-fat, yet flavorful meal. I will make this again but next time I'll decrease the amount of breadcrumbs - the meatballs turned out a bit doughy.

I added more onion and garlic, just because that's my preference, and I would also add more mushrooms. Other than that, it's perfect and very tasty. I didn't add the dill because I'm not sure it would really make it better... remember to butter your noodles! Enjoy!
