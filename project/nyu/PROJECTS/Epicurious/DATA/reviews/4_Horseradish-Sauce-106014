We use this recipe for corn beef cabbage every St. Paddy's Day. We boil 1 cup of broth from the crock pot, let it reduce, turn to a simmer, then mix in creme fraiche and horseradish to taste. Serve hot over meat. YUM!

This is the perfect accompaniment to a beef tenderloin roast. Sometimes, I skip the chives and it still turns out delicious.

used the recipe as written this year. It was EXCELLENT! Everyone raved. I may use creme fraiche next time. And I may strain the horseradish next time too. But even as is.......it's stellar!!

This was a delicious accompaniment to prime rib; however, I thought it was a little too runny. Next time I will use only one cup of creme fraiche. Make sure that you press out all of the liquid in the horseradish.

I liked this, but next time I will decrease the cream and increase the horseradish. It's a personal preference but I found it much to toned-down.

Excellent recipe -- however, we use much less creme fraiche and much more horseradish .. and we'll drain the horseradish next time! (We tried it with sour cream one year -- don't do it!) Everyone loves this sauce with any kind of prime rib!

perfection, but next time I will add more horseradish as I like more of a kick. I did drain it as others suggested and I made it a day ahead of time. I used the creme fraiche. My guests raved.

This is the sauce you are looking for. Added a bit more (strained) horseradish, but that's just because I like the kick. Fine as directed too.

Add cucumber puree to brighten flavors even more

Quick and delicious, I squeezed the excess liquid from the horseradish as recommended by previous posters. It was perfect.

Delicious accompanyment to my standing rib roast for Christmas dinner. I did strain the horseradish before using, but that was the only adjustment. And it is a "make ahead" which is even better. Thanks epicurious.

Very easy and tasty... however agree with previous reviewer re: straining prepared horseradish first. Without straining this sauce is quite soupy.

I used this sauce with a prime rib recipe - I was hoping for a real strong horseradish taste, however I was disappointed. I will add much, much more horseradish the next time.

Excellent! And not just for beef. Try it on fresh broiled salmon!

I first tasted this sauce when my mom served it with beef. It was a bit liquidy. I remember reading in a past horseradish recipe to strain the horseradish before using. When I made this for myself to serve with beef fondue, I first strained the horseradish through a small hand strainer. I drained most of the liquid by pressing the horseradish into the strainer with a spoon. No need to squeeze it dry, just enough to remove some of the liquid. It made a world of difference regarding the texture. Not as soupy. Everyone loved it and the texture was wonderful!! By the way, it was great with beef fondue!!

Superb. I added a little more horseradish, as my jar was not too strong.

very easy and very yummy! It's the staple horseradish sauce in our house.

Great recipe with filet mignons but I think it would have been even better with crumbled blue cheese in it. Nevertheless I thought it was delicious.

I agree with an earlier review that this makes enough for a small army. We made it with sour cream and it definitely tasted better the next day. It was excellent on sandwiches with the leftover prime rib! Very easy to make.

Sauce was a hit with tenderloin sandwiches.

Definitely a keeper. Excellent with this prime rib. Makes enough for 25 people. Next time, I'll cut the recipe waaaaay down.

A perfect horseradish sauce! Served with roast beef, and everyone raved. Has a kick, but the crème fraîche really makes it smooth and yummy.

I served this room temperature atop a standing rib roast. It was very delicious and my guests loved the strong presence of horseradish. pairs wonderfully with red meat.
