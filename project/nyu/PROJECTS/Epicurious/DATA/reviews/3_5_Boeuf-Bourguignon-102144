Delightful! Followed ingredient list exactly but did change method slightly by adapting what I've learned from watching America's Test Kitchen. After sauteeing the chopped onion & carrot, added the flour, cooked & browned the flour for a couple of minutes before adding the tomato paste and the 2 cups wine. Deglazed the pan with the wine, stirring up browned bits and cooking down wine until mixture was syrupy and thick. Then added beef broth & the browned beef cubes with juices, bringing mixture with herbs to a simmer, covered and continued with recipe. This developed a deep rich flavor. Excellent!

I followed the recipe exactly with a few minor changes: I didn't use pearl onions, mainly because no one in my family likes them. Also, I added the last cup of beef stock in the quart box at the 1.5 hour mark, and I added 2C of water at the 2.5 hour mark, both times because it was just getting too dry. But the water also toned down the salt, so in the end, it was perfect. Everyone loved it and had two servings, even my mom who doesn't like "beef stew". I served it with the buttered polenta recipe also on Epicurous.

Good recipe. I took some tips from reviews, particularly about salt and pearl onions. To Christopher in Chicago here is the site for Julia's recipe: http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/recipe?id=8222804

This is an excellent recipe and fun to make. The many flavors in this dish blend together well to make a meal you are sure to enjoy. I did the following things differently: -sautéed about 1/4th lb of pancetta with the beef an let it cook as the beef cooked and then used only one strip of bacon; -served it over polenta (very good compliment; -used inexpensive wine; -sautéed the carrots and mushrooms in butter instead of bacon fat. All of the above worked well with this dish.

This was absolutely delicious. This was the first boeuf bourguignon I have ever made. I'll admit that I made a few very minor changes and it did require a bit of work, but it was worth it. I will make this again very soon.

I made this over two nights. I used dried sliced shiitake instead of fresh and added them in with the broth. Dried shiitake make their own stock, which I think made this dish a lot richer. I'm not wholly convinced of the pearl onions. They added more texture than flavor, even freshly sauteed. For a stronger flavor, I might use red pearl onions in the future. Also, watch the salt content of the broth; as this dish reduces, it becomes much saltier. Otherwise, this was a great version of this recipe. The broth is rich and thick. It served 6 people with leftovers.

I served this on some creamy polenta and loved it. Thankfully, I made it when my husband was out of town so that I could enjoy as much beef as possible!

I have been making this stew since January '05. Excellent stew. I now make it in a slow cooker to save time & heat in the kitchen, as I live in the Virgin Islands. Tie the thyme & sage together & chop the rosemary (2 tsp.)

I saw the movie also, so followed the recipe. I was really disappointed -- it was not that tasty. It was okay. For the effort, frankly it was not worth it. Richard

This was a predictable beef stew. Not special, but not a lot work. I'll try a different receipe next time.

Fabulous, I added a little extra wine and lots of black pepper. My boyfriend and I are loving the leftovers. It makes enough to feed 5-7 people! So French!

I have made this dish several times and have modified it slightly. Instead of using pearl onions as a finish, I substitute brussel sprouts that have been boiled and then blackened on a grill pan. I also serve the stew on top of mashed potatoes (made with a ricer) and then top it with a Biscotti alla Parmigiana (available on foodnetwork.com) Always a hit.

I've made this dish several times and it's always a winner. Very flavorful and relatively easy to prepare. Prepare it a day ahead, then warm it up, reduce the sauce, and you're ready for some crusty french bread and a glass of wine. BTW, I've made this using different red wines, including "2 Buck Chuck", and it still rocks!

Lovely dish, but too much tomato flavor and not enough wine/zing for me. Easy to make and generally tasty

I made this for my family, and my mother-in-law demanded the recipe! The kids ate it and husband asked for a repeat. It was excellent on mashed potatoes. I followed the recipe with a few alterations, shallots instead of onion in addition to the pearls, 2 types of wine. It had several steps but none too involved. I'll do this again for beef lovers. Great comfort food!

This is the best beef stew recipe I have found. It takes time, but well worth it. The addition of the onions at the end is great.

I followed the recipe exactly, having never prepared this type of dish before, and it got rave reviews. The meat was very flavorful and tender. The next time I will prepare the dish with a better wine, but it still was fabulous. My husband has asked that this go into the staple meal category.

Oh my. This was delicious. Worth all the time. I used chuck roast (at the end it melted in your mouth). I tripled it and ran out of beeth broth, so I threw in a few tablespoons of duck demi glace.

I'm going to make this recipe for a dinner party this weekend. In response to Christopher--I would try looking for the recipe in Julia Child's The Art of French Cooking.

I loved this recipe but added a few personal touches. I took advantage of the porcini, chanterell & fresh protobello mushrooms so readily available in my area. I also added a chopped leek as well. I had my butcher cut up a chuck roast & it was so tender. I used a delicious pinot noir wine from Sonoma Valley mainly because it will stand up to the sauce, plus I'd rather have a glass of pinot with the stew rather than a burgandy. Contemplated on making some egg noodles with it but nixed it for some crispy herbed garlic bread. YUMMMMMY!!!

Magnifique! After taking the time buying, preparing, cooking, and presenting, it's all worth it after the first bite of beef. Two important notes. First, the fresh herbs really enhance the flavor. Beware, the sage, rosemary, thyme combo is potent, but that's how I like my beef bourguigon. I've made this with dry herbs and the flavor is mediocre. Second, your choice of wine will dramatically affect the success of the dish. Use a good dry Burgundy. For extras, I added some brandy during the beef browning phase, ditched the baby carrots, and threw in a few potatoes. The potatoes gave it a heartier feel, but ruined the presentation, as it took a browner rather than deep reddish/brown color. I'd definately make this again. Does anyone know where I can find the original Julia Child's recipe?

Superb dish, however I think there are several extraneous steps in this recipe which make it more labour/time intensive than necessary, so I simplified considerably. I did not roast the garlic - used 1/2 a head, minced it and sauteed with the onion/carrot. Did not precook the pearl onions and mushrooms (used a mix of white, shiitake and porcini mushrooms), but added them to the pot at the appropriate time so they wouldn't be overcooked - I wanted them to absorb the flavours of the sauce while, at the same time, contribute their own flavours. Deleted the sage and did not add the baby carrots. Used an excellent quality burgundy, cognac instead of brandy, and added 3tbsp of demi glace all of which intensified the hearty/earthy flavours of this dish. I was rewarded with copious compliments and contented sighs/moans of pleasure from my weekend house guests. A huge success!

After reading the reviews, I pulled out Julia's original recipe for this dish. I don't know what the new, revamped recipe tastes like, but the original is hard to beat. It smelled, and tasted just like the dish I get at a local French restaurant. I'd never try another version of this classic-it's perfection.

This recipe is outstanding! I had some trouble finding the suggested meat so I used beef underblade and I used the already cut up small carrots. The key to this recipe is using fresh herbs. I think it is a little easier than the Julia Child's recipe if I can remember correctly. It was just terrific.

This recipe produced an exquisite dish. Furthermore, it constitutes a mini-course in French cooking since it incorporates basic techniques often repeated in other dishes. My guests and I loved it! Julia Child is a wonder!

Don't be discouraged by the reviews by the "expert" cooks from New York and Secaucus. Note that they don't even know how to spell boeuf bourguignon. Enough said.

Why, in God's name, would anybody want to mess with the original, wonderful Child recipe. Why are there carrots in here? It makes a semi-okay stew, but is in no way a boeuf bourguinon. Why bother to do recipes according to dates when you guys just update them to death. They were popular for a reason. Leave them alone and go with the originals

I'll have to try the meat & veggie marinating, because goodness was this better reheated than it was the night I made it.

What's with the carrots and the sage? This dish is an accepted classic in its traditional form and I failed to see the need for the 1999 update.

Advice: Marinade the meat and veggies in the wine overnight..we found it tastes great that way. We agree with 'Secaucus', use the right wine. Tasted even better the next day!

Didnt like this version much, compared to Julia Childs above mentioned original reicpe. The dry red wine, of course, should be Burgundy wine (hello?? Bourguinon=burgundy in french, you cant have bourguinon without burgundy wine, was anyone paying attention??) Sage AND Rosemary?? thats over doing it! Why carrots?? This isnt beef bourguinon at all its just a garlicky beef stew with veggies.

I think this is an updated (and unnecessarily trendified) version of Julia's original. The original is in her "Art of French Cooking, Vol 1", and it IS a classic. Doesn't need updating or trendifying, and always gets raves. If you are going to go to the time and trouble of making a boeuf bourguignon, use that recipe, not this one.

Its classic,if you prepare it correctly its tasty. A basic stew nothing special.
