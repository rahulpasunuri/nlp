Love this salad, made this multiple times and is very popular with friends and at parties. Following the recipe results in simple yet sophisticated tasty salad!

The salad is very good, my family gave it good reviews and I would definitely make it again. But I didn't make it exactly as written, meaning I didn't measure how many cups of lettuce I used, and I added the other ingredients until it looked right to me. I had access to yellow and orange bell pepper as well as red, which made it very colorful. I also used my own balsamic dressing recipe which has shallots and garlic in it.

This is a great tasty, easy, salad that goes with everything. Loved the fennel!

This was a very easy salad to prepare and got some good reviews from my wife and dinner club pals. I've already made it again and was equally impressed. The 2nd time I skipped the fennel (my nearby grocery store didn't carry it) and the salad was still fantastic.
