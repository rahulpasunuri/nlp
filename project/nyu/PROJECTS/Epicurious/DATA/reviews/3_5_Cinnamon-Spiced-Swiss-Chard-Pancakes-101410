Delicious! I didn't want to waste the stems on my lovely rainbow Swiis chard so I chopped them and started cooking them about 3 minutes before the chard leaves.

Since my husband and I are on weight watchers, I decided to make this for breakfast. (Real pancakes have way too many points.) I also substituted the matzo meal for chick pea flour - it is way healthier. I served it with sliced apples and a sauce made of equal parts of fat free greek yogurt/unsweetened applesauce and cinnamon. I will make this again.

I swapped matzo meal for chickpea flour and nixed the allspice and cinnamon in favor of indian spices like fenugreek, coriander, etc. Topped with chive sour cream sauce. Delicious! The pancake held together and had a nice weight. Very tweakable recipe.

My husband, not a big greens eater, and I devoured these! Delicious- can't wait to make them again. We used the cinnamon and allspice and subbed panko for the matzo meal since it's what we had in house. Next time, we may experiment with complimentary dipping sauces, though they were great without.

One additional note on previous: I had doubled the recipe, so if you decide to add potato starch, use less than I noted

Based on previous reviews, I omitted the allspice and added approximately a 1/4 - 1/3 cup potatoe starch to help keep the pancakes together. Great results. After frying, I am going to freeze and the night of the seder reheat frozen at 450 degrees for 5 - 10 minutes on paper bags to crisp, as I do for potatoe latkes. What a novel vegetable addition to a seder dinner, especially if the make ahead preparation works.

I'm glad to have a new swiss chard dish. This was easy and very good, made a nice dinner for two. I used bread crumbs and no allspice (just what I had in the house). Next time I might cook them a little less or just serve them room temperature, the ones that were in the oven for a few minutes were a little dry.

i make a similar recipe with shredded zucchini. i would substitute home made bread crumbs for the matzo meal- i usually use 2 large pieces of good italian bread or country loaf, 1 tbsp olive oil and salt and pepper to taste into the food processor on the pulse setting. this has saved my zucchini fritters from a soggy fate and imparted a crispier finish. also, try frying a bit longer before flipping. good luck!

I've made these with everything from swiss chard to spinach, kale, and even some spring mix that I needed to use up. It's ridiculous how flexible this recipe is. Depending on the greens, sometimes I find a little flour can help the "fritters" hold their shape better.

A delicious dish with very interesting flavors... It is one of my favorite ways to use chard! My only problem with this recipe is that the pancakes fall apart easily, making flipping a difficult task.

Do try these for guests, something different and delicious. I'm not fond of allspice so I omitted that. Good on a warm afternoon or evening with cool white wine (or retsina!), and perhaps some feta and kalamata olives.
