So delicious! We were tired of the marshmallowy concoction and tried this today for our Christmas meal. It was so good, I know we'll eat sweet potatoes more often now!

I can't stop making this dish. I was looking for something to do with all the sweet potatoes I had because i got tired of baking them. These have a nice texture. Thank goodness I followed others advise and dropped the butter to 3 tablespoons. Even that is too much sometimes. Last night I used lime juice because I was out of lemon and that worked fine. My kids 2 and 4 love this too. Winner!

great, but add some ancho chili pepper.

I always substitute maple syrup for the honey which gives the dish a wonderful flavour. NOTE: use 4 or 5 tblsps of maple syrup though to taste.

If you are looking for overwhelming sweetness, this isn't it BUT it is a great and tasty way to serve sweet potatos. Also, I always leave the skin on for added vitamins that doesn't take away from the taste.

We looked for something simple and different this year - although this dish was both, I thought it was pretty ho-hum. I can't understand the other reviews that raved about this dish - it was bland and a big disappointment. The potatoes did not seem to absorb any of the honey flavor - will not make again.

Add some cayenne pepper, these are amazing and fairly easy to make!

A bit too bland. Would add nutmeg or ginger if made again. Still way too much butter even with cutting it back to 2T.

I've made this recipe so many times I've lost count. Just can't stop eating 'em! Cut back on the butter to 2 T. and you can substitute orange juice for the lemon juice if you don't happen to have a lemon around. Good both ways!

I love plain roasted sweet potatoes, but the honey lemon juice combination killed the flavor. Wouldn't make again.

Delicious! We all loved them. Nice variation.

MAKE THIS RECIPE!!! Everyone loved it! I doubled the recipe, fed 6 people, and had crumbs left.

We've made these along side of the pork chops from the same menu (simple and delicious) and really enjoy them! They're also great with a lemon roasted chicken.

I was skeptical about trying this recipe after reading mixed reviews, but these sweet potatoes were a huge success with every one of 25 guests at our holiday dinner, and I ate the serving that was left over cold for breakfast the next morning - delicious! I did follow along and cut back the butter to about 2T per recipe (that is VERY good advice), AND I used orange juice instead of lemon - twice what was called for. An easy and delightul crowd pleaser.

I made this for a dinner party and everybody asked for the recipe. As recommended by other posters, I reduced the amount of butter to about 2T and it was great. Also, I didn't have enough lemon juice so I used orange juice instead.

Another vote for easy and excellent. I added 2T of minced crystallized ginger to the glaze and created a new Thanksgiving tradition for my family. Thanks!

I am new at cooking and thought this recipe was delicious and easy. I will definately make it again! I baked the dish for one hour/10 min and next time will back a little longer.

I made it along side of stuffed acorn sqaush and it was a perfect accompaniment. The whole family loved it, I would most certainly make it again. I would also be a perfect subsitution for traditional sweet potatoes at any holiday meal. My father said it was just like eating desert!

We liked this dish. I can't understand why the cook from Santa Clarita gave it three forks when s/he obviously didn't like the dish.

This was wonderful! I've made it several times since and we can't get enough of it!

Not awful, but I agree with the cook who said that all that butter was unnecessary. I couldn't taste much of the glaze, either. I might give this another shot, and attempt to modify the recipe to my liking.

These yams were just OK....my husband didnt really like them and the kids begged me to make my old recipe......They are simple and pretty good but nothing special. Wont make these again

We love sweet potatoes - so any new twist is fun. The preparation method was great - very easy. However, we didn't care for the glaze that was on the potatoes. Next time I will make it with a little less lemon juice and honey. You can also cut back significantly on butter (in my opinion). The really great thing is that this recipe could be prepared so many different ways. Give it a try then adjust seasonings to your taste.

Easy and different way of preparing sweet potatoes.

These were so easy and delicious! Amazing! Next time I will not stir is often so that they can brown a little on top! Soooo good!

Although I am not a huge fan of sweet potatoes, even I enjoyed this recipe. I actually used margarine instead of butter and lowered the amount a little but it was still excellent and easy to make.

I have made this several times and it's become my favorite way to make sweet potatoes. I use a non stick spray on the pan and cut the butter to 2 T with no loss of flavor.

I have never been a huge fan of sweet potatoes, but this recipe is SO easy and delicious. I will make this over and over but maybe cut back a little on the butter.

This is a very easy to make side dish, or even stand alone can be used as dessert. I used 3tbsp of butter and it still tastes a bit too buttery. I will definately reduce the butter next time. This dish is very healthy as sweet potato helps digestion and honey is nutritionally rich. And it tastes wonderful. The honey adds to the aroma of roasted sweet potato. It's fantastic.

This is a great and simple dish. I have made it twice since published, and it is always my favorite part of the meal. I found that the butter could be cut back a bit without sacraficing the flavor. I also sprayed the dish with a non-stick spray. If you like sweet potatoes, this one is definitely worth your time.

Excellent. Make with Baked Pork Chops with Parmegian-Sage Crust and Kale with Apple and Onion for a colorful, delicious meal!

This is a new family favorite. Great tastes. This is the easiest sweet potato recipe and tastes great. Will serve it from now on during the holidays instead of my old favorites.
