This recipe was wonderful...I used leftover rolls and skim milk, cut down on the sugar, and made a raspberry-orange juice fruit sauce as a healthy alternative to the banana sauce. Love it!

I actually had stale banana bread left over and used that for the pudding, which was amazing (I know, left overs from left overs!) But it added a lot of flavor and richness to the bread pudding part. The sauce was also delicious, I used salted butter so it tasted much more caramel-y. A huge hit, and super easy.

I cut the recipe in half, ignored the sauce and just mashed 3 soft bananas into the custard mixture. Layered a half a stale whole wheat baquette sliced 1/4" thick in a single small baking dish with the custard and a few raisins thrown in - I know I changed a lot but it was a hit! Is it self-congratulatory to give it 4 forks?

I cut the bread thinner and made 12. The sauce was outstanding- I cut the bananas smaller and whisked them until they were smooth- I don't like lumpy sauces

This turned out so much better than expected! I cut the recipe down to make 2 bread puddings and they were sooo delicious. I made one other adjustment: I did not have whole milk so I used 1% milk with a splash of half n half. Turned out great. My only recommendations are to fill the muffin cups to the very brim to allow for sinkage. I used very ripe bananas and they were too soggy after simmering them. Next time I will add them at the very end.

yum, yum, yum! Made this for guests and actually put together everything 4 hours in advance. Everyone thought it was delicious and all asked for the recipe. Made one alteration, sprinkled the tops with extra sugar before baking so that top was crunchy and golden.

We all thought this was delicious. I omitted the rum, served warm with vanilla ice cream. I would definitly make this again.

The bread pudding was bland and boring and the banana "sauce" was nothing more than a lot of fat, liquor and chunks of banana. I would not make this again. There are much better recipes for bread pudding available on this site.

The sauce is delicious, although it has a very strong rum flavor. Very easy to do.

WOW! I normally dont like bread pudding but this was delicious. My husband loved it, he suggested topping it with a little whipped cream next time. This recipe is a keeper.

This is the simplest and most delicious bread pudding I make. Bread pudding is one of my boyfriend's favorite desserts so I love making this one for him! He loves to eat it with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream!! Try it...you'll love it!

SO easy to make, and really quite good - the banana-rum sauce is fantastic! I used dark rum instead of light, and baked the puddings in ramekins instead of a muffin pan.
