The flavor was great but the texture was so terrible I couldn't serve it- very grainy or chalky.

Wow - this sorbet is so rich I almost thought it was ice cream. Forgot to buy frozen OJ so I used the Tropicana Grovestand that was in my fridge - the orange isn't very prominent, but offers nice undertones. I used Ghirardelli semisweet chocolate. The perfect sorbet to have one small scoop of, and no added fat beyond the chocolate!

Simple to make but with a strong orange flavor. If and when I make it again, I'd use less orange juice concentrate.
