For mashed potatoes with a twist - this is a great recipe. The mustard flavor made for a perfect accompaniment to Halibut a la Vera Cruz entree.

I liked these a lot, but I didn't use quite as much mustard as called for. I had forgotten to let the butter soften so I put it in the microwave in a pyrex cup with the milk and heated it all up. Added the combined warm mixture to the potatoes. Easy and it gave nice texture.

a small addition made a big difference. Terrific with salmon and roasted vegetables.

this recipe takes regular mashed potatoes and makes them into something to talk about.

Yum, yum, yum! I love Yukon Gold potatoes and whole grain mustard. The combination is a marriage made in heaven. I used 4 T. of mustard.

i've been making potatoes like this for years! i usually use gulden's brown mustard, red potatoes, and some rosemary. truthfully, i'm a little disappointed that this is someone else's recipe!!!

This is a great way to add pizzaze to your everyday side dish! Worked very well with the salmon in the same menu, also.

These potatoes were very good. Such a simple idea... add mustard to mashed potatoes and they'll taste better. Wish I would have thought of it myself.
