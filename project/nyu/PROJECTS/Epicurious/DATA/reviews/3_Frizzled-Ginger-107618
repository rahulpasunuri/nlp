The ginger was difficult to slice thinly into long pieces if you don't have a slicing device, but it's a must with the red pork recipe so we powered through! I found the proportions to be too much for the dish. Next time I will cut it in alf.

While I recommend having a mandoline, mine was unavailable so I sliced the ginger with a vegetable peeler. Worked quite nicely, but I was glad I bought extra because it was difficult to slice long strips fromm each piece. Also, make sure to use a large enough pan = when you add the ginger, the liquid in it causes the oil to bublbe up quto quite a height.
