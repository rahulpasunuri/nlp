Just made the biscuits. Did not do the brown sugar part. I did follow another reviewers suggestion to add a pinch of sugar to the dry ingredients. While a very simple recipe to make, these are very, very bland or flavorless.

I accidentally added the brown sugar to the dough instead of on top, and I thought the biscuits were great. Tiny but delicious with the sweet/savory combo of biscuit, ham and whole grain mustard.

These are easy to make and kids enjoy the small size. Definitely a nice change from the usual ham sandwich.

This was incredibly easy to make. Next time I will have the dough slightly thicker for taller biscuits and make a double batch. I didn't do the broiling and brown sugar, either, but served them with Virginia ham and cranberry honey mustard. Delicious!

All I did was make the biscuits to serve with dinner, not as sandwiches, and this was a simple recipe that came up in my search. The preparation was fast, but my husband said they "needed something", and from the other review, I guess that would be a pinch of sugar in the dough. However, I did not get as many biscuits as I should have. Otherwise they were tasty, and I would make them again (with a pinch of sugar!)

This was a wonderfully easy dough to work with and it produces light and flakey biscuits. I dispensed with the brown sugar and broiling. Instead, I served them with grainy mustards and horseradish at a buffet. They freeze beautifully and could be made ahead for a party.

Not bad, although the next time I think I'll make the biscuits a bit sweet. Overall, there's a nice sweet/salt combination, and it's great comfort food. It gave me the same feeling as that old standby: Grilled cheese sandwich and Tomato soup. :-)
