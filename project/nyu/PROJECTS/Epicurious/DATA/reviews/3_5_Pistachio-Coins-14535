I love this recipe! Namely because it's as easy to make as it is to adapt. I have no extract, so added the zest of one lemon. The first time I did it, they were crumbly because I was too enthusiastic with the pistachios. Flour-nut-liquids ratio is too fragile to mess with. (This time, had no large egg, so added another yolk... we'll see.) Shape: I prefer flat and thin cookies, so made them so (crispier, less of a "sablé" cookie). As for the topping, try it with a bit of salt! Amazing! Added note: you can make the dough in advance and refrigerate. Also, how am I supposed to check the bottom of the cookies? Never mind that, I found they were ready when -surprisingly- arose a peppery smell from the oven!

The cookies were very well received. I didn't have any dried cranberries so I just topped them with the white chocolate and pistachios and no one seemed the wiser. I will try them again with the berries as I think that would make them look rather festive. The texture of the cookie was excellent. My yield was closer to 60 and I had exactly enough white chocolate sauce to give each cookie a nice filling.

I really like these cookies! I've made them for a few years now.

Made this for the first time this year. As other reviewers have noted, there wasn't enough white chocolate for all the cookies. (But thanks to them, we were prepared!) However, I thought the less white chocolate, the better. It detracted from the delicate taste of the cookie. Next year, I'll use only enough to adhere the cranberries and pistachios, or maybe even make a different icing.

By my standards, these cookies were not much effort considering how delicious and attractive they turned out (don't have to roll out the dough). I used 1/2 tsp of each of the extracts. I measured the dough with a 1/2 Tbsp. measuring spoon (flat) and ended up with about 80 cookies. Also, I used walnuts in the cookie dough since I didn't buy enough pistachios. I had the same difficulty with the topping as noted by another reviewer (didn't have enough for all the cookies and butter separated from the chocolate). I made some additional topping by melting one square of Baker's white chocolate in the microwave for 30 seconds. I then stirred the chocolate 'til it melted and added about 1/2 tsp of veg. oil to make topping more fluid. The small amount of oil worked better than the butter. In the future, I'll use 3 squares of white chocolate and 1-2 tsp oil and melt in the microwave.

I've been making these cookies since 1997, but the topping has always vexed me--too much butter so it separated, and on top of that it was never enough to do all the cookies. This year I first melted the chocolate, then added butter until the mixture became workable. A much better result!

This has become one of the annual Christmas traditions of my family. THey are my husbands favorite. One modification: I just make regular butter/milk/powdered sugar/vanilla frosting instead of the frosting called for in the recipe. These cookies look really festive

If you FOLLOW the recipe the cookies are wonderful, and visually attractive for the holidays. You might want to increase the white chocolate for the topping a bit.

Ever since I made this cookie one Christmas, it has become a family tradition to make this. I guess the reason it is so popular is because it is a simple, but very good tasting change to everything else you get at Christmas.

I agree with the previous reviewer. These cookies were a lot of work and not so good. My husband and I were looking forward to these cookies because we both like pistachios, but we were disappointed with the results.

Yuk! These were a lot of work and utterly tasteless. I decided to skip a step and instead of spooning the chocolate over the cookie and then sprinkling the dried fruit and pistachios over, I mixed the fruit and nuts into the chocolate. This did nothing to improve the flavor, and the visual result was that of diarrhea! Next!

These cookies are great! I've made them the last two Christmas and loved them. They are fairly easy and look really festive with the red cranberries and green nuts.

I tried this recipe as Christmas homemade cookie gift and my friends were impressed. It's delicious but requires some effort though.
