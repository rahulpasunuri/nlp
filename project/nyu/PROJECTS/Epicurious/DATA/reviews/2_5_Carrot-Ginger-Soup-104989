Too bad I didn't read the reviews first--this soup was a real disappointment. In addition to agreeing that the cook time was too short, I would add that the orange zest and juice gave the soup an odd metallic flavor. I would also grate the carrots and potatoes before cooking to make it go faster and make processing smoother. More ginger might have helped, too.

really bad.

Thanks to all the helpful comments in the other reviews. I ended up making a recipe inspired by this one that turned out very well. I substitued sweet potatoes for the idaho potatoes and used 6 cloves of garlic in place of the shallots. I didn't use tabasco or soy sauce. I just put chunks of carrots (I used baby carrots as one commenter suggested) and sweet potatoes in the slow cooker with everything else and cooked it on Low for seven hours. Then I blended it. Easy, flavorful, healthy. I didn't rate the recipe because I made so many changes but I'd give my version 3.5 stars.

Wish I had read the reviews before making this recipe (had it printed out in a book). I made it for a party and it was just so so. It took much longer than two hours to cook so it wasn't ready on time. Made exactly as recipe stated. Strong taste and not that pleasant. Will thin out leftovers somehow. Would not make this again.

I followed the advice of others and substituted mushroom broth and sweet potatoes. I added milk, which helped to thin it and make it creamier, but I still felt that something was missing. Then I tried adding 4 teaspoons of cumin to the recipe and that proved to be the magic touch. I serve it cold and find it refreshing in the summer.

Very bland. I followed the recipe exactly and it was missing something. I just don't know what!

Also did this as stovetop by simmering for about 50 minutes after boiling and it worked fine. My wife and I have different thresholds for "heat", so I backed off on the Tabasco for the main batch and added to mine individually. Very good flavor and consistency.

Our household loves this soup - hot or cold! My recipe modifications: I don't use a slow cooker, use more carrots, substitute sweet potatoes for 1/2 the potato requirements, use mushroom broth instead of chicken, add 2-3 tbsp. of olive oil, add some white wine while cooking.

I agree with the other reviewers, in that the cooking time is off; four hours was the magic time. I've made several carrot soups before, all heavily dairy-product based and, though delicious, I always felt guilty eating them. Not so with this one *S*. I added 1/2 tsp of kosher salt at the beginning and 1 cup of skim milk at the end because it was a little too thick. Hint, I used bagged baby organic carrots; it definitely cut down on prep time.

Plan on at least four hours cooking time. This recipe is too large for a 4-quart slow cooker (found out the hard way) but a 5 or 6 quart should do fine. I would limit the soy sauce to 2 tablespoons max, and go the rest of the way with salt, as more soy sauce will darken the good color of this soup. If I make carrot ginger soup again, I'll search for another recipe.

a delicious way to sneak in some extra veggies

Before you make this check the "Test-Kitchen Notes" link on the recipe page. It warns that the timing is all off for crock pot cookery! However, it did make a nice soup cooked on the stove top. The ginger seems to brighten and freshen the flavor of the soup, enhancing the carrot flavor.

Well, it says to use a slow-cooker, but I don't own one. So, I improvised and made it as a stove-top soup, and it turned out just fine. In fact, it's deeee-lish!!! I didn't have shallots or onions (which I don't like anyway), so I substituted celery for shallots, and puréed the first three ingredients, along with 3 large cloves of garlic, in my food processor and fried the "mash" in 1 Tbsp each of sesame and olive oil for about 5 mins., then added the rest of the ingredients and boiled it all at a medium heat (a vigourous boil) for about 1 hour (give or take 10 mins.) with the lid on the pot (otherwise, too much liquid would evaporate). I also chose to make this with vegetable broth to have a vegetarian dish. The orange zest and juice add such a surprisingly wonderful burst of flavour, which still come through above the heat from the tabasco and the tange from the soy sauce! It's nice with yogurt, but I have a feeling that with sour cream it'll be "outta-this-world" good, so I plan to pick some up on the way home from work tonight. I ended up with just over 2 litres of soup when I was done. This recipe is a keeper! YUM!!!

Bland! And there is no way it will cook in a crock pot in two hours! I had to dump it in a soup kettle and cook it on top of the stove.

Very nice soup. I think it's a great dish for a summer dinner outside served with a fresh baguet and a green salad and of course COLD dry white wine. When I made it I did add a little more ginger. Then when it was served I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream then topped off with fresh chives. Very simple to make and it also looks beautiful.
