Simplify this recipe by not bothering to add the extra sugar to the beets--they are perfect and sweet as the are, just sliced thin and dried. They burn easily if you attempt to crisp them if they get soggy, so make them close to the day you want them, and factor in the weather. Humid days get to these chips no matter how you store them. I am unable to resist beets prepared this simple way and I HATE beets, but kept getting them in my CSA share. I have never made the dip, the chips are so good they work on their own.

Have no idea how this works; followed recipe exactly and ended up with extremely chewy, yet very thin, beet slices (could take a filling out if you're not careful). The flavor also was still too "beety" for me, not at all like the ones I buy in stores. Didn't even bother with dip.

A great way to use up extra beets. I boiled the beets whole and then sliced thin with a knife. Like other reviewers, I found the chips crisped better if I let them cool in the warm oven.

I couldn't get the beet chips to crisp. The curried sour cream tended to run on the chips, but it doubled great as a dip for other chips.

These turned out perfectly! I sliced the beets only a little more than an eighth of an inch after I read about other people's chips crumbling. That worked well. No broken chips. I left them in the oven a little longer to compensate for the extra thickness, and they turned out gloriously crunchy. I also added some brown sugar and some garlic powder to the dip to take away the tang from the sour cream. Delicious!

Nice and easy. Allowed the chips to cool in the oven (door open), they came out very crispy. Try adding lemon zest to the dip, it really lightens it up. Will be trying this with carrots, too, next time.

These sounded just right for an Asian inspired dinner party appetizer. It's a good thing I decided to make them in advance since I now have time to get something else! The directions call for "paper-thin" slices, easy to make on a mandeline, but they were too thin & crisped too much. I baked them on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet & most of them crumbled as I tried to remove them. The second batch was cooked for half the time & they too had a problem. Tasty morsels I will admit but far too thin to dip into anything in their present fragile state. I recommend slicing the beets to about 1/16 of an inch or to a thickness that is not transparent if you really want to make these but they are not worth the trouble. Good luck.

I have made this recipe many times for parties, and it always gets rave reviews. Many friends have even requested the recipe, too. Slicing the beets super thinly definitely helps with the crisping. However, I've also found that thicker slices are just as tasty and somewhat of a novelty. Definitely worth the effort!

One fork is so-so? Do they have negative forks? The recipe serving size was 2 beets for 6 servings. I just tried this recipe with 9 beets because I wanted to take this to a holiday party and figured 2 would serve only me and my guest. Well, I was wrong; 9 would still serve only me and my guest. After cooking these things for an hour, there's no way I can show up at the party with the result. The dehydration process reduces the size of these things incredibly. 9 beets will serve maybe a dinner party of 4 or 5 people IF you have some other hors d'ouerve. Okay, after that rant (the process leaves plenty of time to have some wine in between activites), I have to admit that I didn't use the same water to sugar ratio that the recipe called for; I eyeballed it for 9 beets. I also used cookie sheets to cook them which seemed to be too thin; and therefore led to some burning. I did a batch in a glass baking pan and those seemed to come out much better.

Dip is great. Beet chips turned out quite well -- you really have to have them wafer thin to turn out. We purchased a $10 slicer which worked fine. The beginning of recipe says not to "assemble" them in advance or they will become soggy. But later it just says to serve the chips with the dip. Not sure if we were supposed to pipe a little dip on each chip or what...

I made only the beet chip recipe as I was looking for a garnish for an appetizer. They are incredibly good - crisp, sweet and salty. With a Benriner, which is a must, you can slice them paper thin. They are time consuming to make, but nonetheless very easy, and well worth the effort. I will try them with the dip next time.

Dude.. this recipe blew! I would definitely NOT make again. The beets NEVER did cook properly, and I followed everything! The dip was OK. I ended up going out and buying Terra Chips, its a good substitution for the beet cheeps

It sounds bizarre, but this really is a delicious little hors d'oevre! I could eat the curried sour cream alone by the spoonful, but the beet chips really make for a perfect combination!

My sister-in-law made this for us last night and we loved it! We'll definitely be making it the next time we have people over... or maybe just for us! LOL!

Beets took longer to cook. Sour cream here is runnier here, so next time wouldn't add oil. Chips are good once done!
