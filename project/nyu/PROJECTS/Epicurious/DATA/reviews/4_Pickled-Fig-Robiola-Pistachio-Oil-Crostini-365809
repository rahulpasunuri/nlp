PERFECT. Easy to make and really good. I needed it to be make ahead, so I made toasts with a nice firm baguette. I also didn't want to waste the pickling fluid so I boiled it to a syrup and lightly drizzled over the whole thing. Everyone loves this appetizer.

This recipe was a hit! Everyone loved it. The robiola may be difficult to find, but a triple cream brie works as a substitute. I put the assembled toast under the broiler for one last warm up before drizzling with the oil and serving. The second time I made it I used a Whole Foods rye bread, which was a good accompaniment to the earthiness of the figs and pistachio flavor and it also stands up to any excess moisture. Next time, I may add a little more sugar or honey to the discarded red wine vinegar mixture, reduce it over heat, and then add it to a spritzer-type cocktail or sangria.

This recipes was great! I made a few substitutions. I used ricotta cheese instead of robiola, but I'm sure any cheese would be great. I also added a little salt, pepper and olive oil to the bread slices that I broiled them in the oven (we don't have a grill). I then put a small amount of lemon peel over the top at the end. It was amazing! Can't wait to make it again.

This recipe was really easy to make and delicious! Instead of the robiola I substituted soft goat cheese because my local food store didn't have robiola.
