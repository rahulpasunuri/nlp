Excellent and so simple to make! I made all three recipes, and found this was great to make at a friend's house, as it does not involve a great deal of ingredients or special equipment. I was having a hard time finding suitable salmon, so I subbed shrimp instead. Another time I might do both. I loved that it was all make-ahead. I served it with warm corn tortillas, avocados, lime and some queso fresco crumbled over the rice. It was a deceptively impressive meal for such easy preparation. I will definitely be making this again!

I've only made the rice for a party and since have been requested to make it repeatedly...it is so very good; actually prepare as indicated but probably will try with less oil next time. Have substituted canned jalapeno with good results.

We enjoyed this, but I found it a good bit of trouble. The ingredients are not readily available here and we have a large Hispanic population--even Whole Food does not have the serranos and it was on my 3rd grocery store that I found the ground chipotle powder. I will probably make it again, using some of the suggested modifications by reviewers, such as using lime juice, cutting the olive oil in 1/2 and jalapenos can be subbed for the serranos, but I guess it was such a hassle to do that I kind of lost my enthusiasm.

Deeeelicious! Two modifications I made: I used lime juice in the dressing instead of white wine vinegar and I tossed udon noodle with some of the dressing, then topped with the seafood. A great dish for company.

Sorry, friends, me again. I forgot to make my other suggestion. Next time I am going to grill the salmon, shrimp and scallops on the BBQ. With the achiote, to absolutely die for, I suspect.

I've made this twice; the first time exactly according to the recipe (a very rare occurrence!) and it was absolutely lovely. However, the second time I made it my budget was not running to fresh shellfish so I subbed a bag of frozen Trader Joe's jumbo (21-30) P/D shrimp for the mussels and clams. BUT the kicker was that I added about 1 t of achiote paste to the marinade. Ooooooh mama! It took this recipe to the stratosphere in number of forks. If you can find it, get some achiote paste and experiment with it. Subtle but unmistakable, and very authentic.

My rating is based on making all 3 components of this recipe. It is fabulous. Like others, I cut the oil in half on the Cilantro dressing. I served everything warm instead of letting go to room temp. I'm a bit afraid of the time/temp/bacteria thing. It makes a beautiful presentation and the flavors are beyond anything you can imagine! I substitued shrimp in place of the clams. Just wonderful!

Am I missing something? I did not see cilantro at all in this recipe for "Seafood Salad With Cilantro Dressing".

This was absolutely fabulous!!! Salad is a bit misleading as this is more of a seafood feast. The combination of the three recipes is outstanding. And the fact that everything can be made ahead is what makes this a four fork rating. Superb!

I made this as soon as the magazine arrived (along with the rice, cilantro dressing, and vegetables) and have actually made it three times since - it is really one of those "special dishes" that desserves to go into the permanent recipe box. You could get away without the vegetables, but the combination of the rice, seafood, and DRESSING are what make the dish. Obviously, it is a simple enough recipe that you must spring for the highest quality seafood available (i opted for prawns instead of salmon). I particularily like the "make ahead" potential that makes it idea for warm weather entertaining (or a romantic evening). ENJOY.

The dressing (which I'll rate seperately) was lovely and really brought this all together. It was a very simple fun dish which is great for company and looks more impressive than you deserve for the amount of work. Can't beat that.
