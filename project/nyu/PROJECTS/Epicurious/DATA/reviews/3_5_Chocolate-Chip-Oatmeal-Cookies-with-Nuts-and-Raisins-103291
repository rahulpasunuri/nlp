I substituted a banana for the shortening, as suggested below. Note that this does give the cookies a distinctly banana flavor. As many others have noted, if you bake as recommended, the cookies end up flat; I found the edges were well-browned, and center still uncooked at 10 minutes. In my second batch, I lowered the temperature to 325, and let them bake for the full 15 minutes. This resulted in thicker evenly-baked cookies. A temp in between is probably correct. Be sure to spray/grease your cookie sheet, even if it is non-stick, and let the cookies cool at least 10 minutes on the sheet before trying to move them to a cooling rack. A good recipe, but I'm still looking...

This is my go-to cookie recipe---every time I take them to an event, someone asks for the recipe. I make the recipe as written, usually with a mixture of semisweet chips and 60% cacao chips. I refrigerate the dough before scooping out and baking; this way, they don't come out super-thin. They definitely do crisp up, especially the day after baking. One of my favorite recipes!

these are tasty but I've made them twice, following the recipe exactly, and they come out too thin and brittle. Have to change the recipe somewho or find a different one.

A little more brittle than I had hoped, but tastey nonetheless. I omitted the nuts and used 1 C each of choc chips and raisins. I used a banana instead of the shortening as someone suggested and no one even noticed. A great way to hide a few calories.

These are delicious. I left out the nuts, added extra chocolate chips and used all butter, no shortening. YUM. I think they're the best chocolate chip cookies, but everyone else always request the Wookie Cookies.

Looked in pantry and, yes, I do have shortening. But, used the banana alternative instead. Moist, delicious. Daughter for whom I made them loved 'em and asked for recipe. Dog beat the crumbs to the floor, but she is a bit indiscriminate.

These cookies were dry and brittle. I under baked them and still the cookies were this and brittle. If you like your cookies chewy and soft, try another recipe.

I looked at the reviews - and tweeked it myself. 1 cup brown sugar - 1/2 cup of white sugar. Left out the shortening out all together (as one other person said "who has shortening?"), instead I substituted one very ripe banana - to keep the cookies moist. DELICIOUS! Not greasy at all - my best friend is now really jealous that my cookies are better....

Delicious. Read others' advice & altogether made the following tweaks: 3/4 c. white sugar, dashes of ground cloves & cinnamon, about 2 tbl. extra butter. Regarding the baking time, I tried a regular oven & convection, both at 350 - convection turned them thin & too too crisp. 10 minutes in the regular oven, left to cool a bit on the tray & they were moist, chewy & delicious.

The best cookies I've made in years!!! Just AWESOME!!!! The only note i'd add is you may want to cut cooking time down to about 12-13 minutes (as opposed to 15) so that the cookies are softer. Also, to keep these (and any cookies soft), just store in a tupperware container with a slice of apple. Even without that though, these were still amazing the next day. A definite keeper- we devoured all of them in one day!

Very good cookies. Being from the South, used pecans instead of walnuts. Mix em up, spoon onto tray and pop in the freezer. When they freeze, drop them in a zip lock and just fix what you can eat hot from the oven!!

Great cookies! Easy to make! Followed the recipe exactly and it was my 1st baking experience! They were amazing when you eat them on the same day, but don't keep that well. They harden and get dry pretty quick! So eat them all up quick! Not so hard when they are so yummy!

These were great! We'll make them again soon.

Devoured immediately after removing from oven! Friends could not stop talking about them and are always thrilled when i make them!

Thanks to the tip regarding cooking time, the cookies turned out nice and chewy. I added both dark and white chocolate chips. I also cut the sugars to 3/4 cups each and I think I'd take it down even further for the next batch . . .there will be a next batch for sure!!

Yummy. What more do I need to say? These cookies look like gourmet cookies, they had a light and chewy texture, just the right amount of sweetness. Nearly perfect. One sheet of cookies came out thin and brittle but I think I just left it in the oven a little too long. Let cool on the cookie sheet or you risk having crumbs instead of cookies. Will most certainly make this again.

My mom just took these out of the oven; I'm going to eat all of them! (I'm 16). Enhance your cookie eating experience as we did by replacing 2 tbs shortening with 2 extra tbs butter. Contrary to Planters' advertising slogan, DON'T GO NUTS. DO relax and enjoy nut-less cookies.

Excellen cookies,recommendation to bake ~13 minutes for chewy texture. Would make for a party or holiday.

These were the best chocolate chip cookies ever. I brought some to my friends, and they loved them. Today I brought some to work, and they were devoured. I can't wait to go home and make more.

I would probably choose another recipe, b/c these cookies came out thin and brittle. But if you want to try them, the best way that I found was to lower the cooking time and temp, grease the pan well, and remove the cookies from the pan with a metal spatula as soon as they can be removed; the first few tries, i had a lot of broken cookies b/c they were overcooked and stuck to the pan.

This is a fantastic recipe. I have made it several times, but my most recent variation has worked the best: use butter-flavored crisco for the shortening. I buy this in the stick form and keep it in the fridge, and use it only for these cookies. The extra butter flavor was great. I also only cook them for 9 minutes - they come out slightly undercooked so I leave them on the sheet for a couple of minutes before putting them on the rack to cool. The cookies stay chewier this way, which I prefer to a crunchy cookie. The only bummer is they stay fresh for only a couple of days, even stored in tupperware. I'm going to try freezing them next time and see if that helps. Far and away the best cookie recipe combining oatmeal, raisins, and chocolate chips that I've tried!

Yummy! My husband and I polished off this batch of cookies in 2 days. I used margarine instead of shortening, (who has shortening on hand?) and also used the entire bag of chocolate chips instead of the 9 ounces. I also added flaxseed meal to "health" them up a bit. Delicious cookies.

I love crunchy cookies with great flavor. This recipe delivered as the combination allowed for each individual flavor to show thru! They came out thin and very large- so they are impressive to see, as well as taste. The recipe did require some modifications since my pantry was low: Substitute 1/2 cup margarine for shortening, and left out raisins. Additionally, I reduced the cooking time to 13 minutes per batch! You will enjoy!

These are the most delicious cookies ever. The texture and flavor is wonderful. I've made them repeatedly.

These were fabulous cookies! Instead of all choclate chips I subsitituted 1/2 each of chocolate and white chocolate and used all dark brown sugar. The cookies do flatten significantly (even after i refrigerated the dough for 2 hrs), so allow for this. I used Silpats to cook them on which eliminates any sticking issues. ENJOY!

After looking at many oatmeal cookie recipies I decided on this one and don't regret it. They came out really good, and were easy to make. I will surely bake more in the future.

When making this recipe the cookies were very flat and burned on the edges. I saved them by using a heart shaped cookie cutter to cut out the better part. This worked very well. The cutting was done when they were straight out of the oven.

After getting snowed in over the weekend, I was struck with cabin fever with little to do, so I decided to go on a mad hunt for the "perfect oatmeal cookie" recipe. I believe I found it with this recipe! They were the best cookies I've ever made! I followed the recipe to a T, and they came out totally delectable!...chewy on the inside, just a little crispy around the edges. I thoroughly recommend it, and plan on making some more today...I just hope I can keep from eating them all until Christmas! =)

These cookies tasted great but they looked awful -- they got all flat and thin looking. i also found that they were a bit greasy -- i had just the opposite experience than the person who couldn't get them off the pan!

Everyone at home loved these cookies. They're easy to make, but extra care has to be taken to separate them enough on the baking tin, so that they do not stick together while baking.

The cookies taste great, but they stuck to the cookie sheets no matter what I did - I used a spray oil, greased the sheets by hand, removed cookies after only a minute or two or (worst of all) allowed them to cool on the sheets as the recipe instructed. Way too frustrating. I wound up with lots of broken cookies.

A very good cookie--fully loaded!! However, I found it a little too salty. The next time I make it, I'm going to cut the salt down to 1/2 tsp.
