Perfect--I've made it several times. Don't worry if you don't have the marjoram. And double the recipe.

This salad is easy and has such amazing flavour. The bread is great in it and so different. I used balsamic as others suggested and wouldn't change from that. This is a must have recipe this time of year especially if you have tomatoes in the garden. I can't count how many times I've made it already this season.

Excellent. But recipe is just for two. Double it up.

I omitted the olives. I have tried grilling and toasting the bread and I loved both ways.

I friend gave me an assortment of tomatoes and stumbled across this recipe looking how to use them. I doubt there is a better use for these heirlooms. After reading some of the comments, I too used balsamic vinegar, and added bell peppers and crumbled feta cheese. The result was marvelous!

If I could eat just one thing all summer long, it would be this. Easy to add in other variables like green beans, corn, arugula etc but do not forget the most important step: Buy or grow the best tomatoes and really, it's hard to go wrong.

Wow, this tastes like summer. What a great, easy salad. One of the best recipes I've gotten off this site. I'm sure you could vary it a lot, but I always make recipes as written the first time. You won't need to change a thing on this one -- it's perfect as written.

Wow...this is a keeper to make over & over with lots of variations. We did use balsamic & I toasted some cibatta. We did not have majoram (gasp) so we used some dried in the dressing. It turned out so fabulous with a few heirloom tomatoes from Whole Foods. Impressed my guests & found a lifetime fave now. Make this! It's a summer celebration of Italy & life!

This bread salad is fantastic. What a great way to use left over bread. I did toast the bread first and also used balsamic instead of red wine vinegar. The heat of the garlic (I used 2 cloves) was perfect. I did add additional salt and did not have any marjoram and was not sure what to substitute.

So good! I added the kernels from 2 ears of fresh corn (raw), and sub'd rosemary for the marjoram since I was serving it with Zucchini and Rosemary soup. RAVE reviews!

Fabulous! Very easy to make, and the flavor is wonderful. I doubled the recipe and it served 8 as a side dish. I thought the garlic was a little strong, however, and next time will use only half the amount.

So delicious! This dish is perfect for the hot weather - it is filling without being heavy and has so much flavor. I used a wonderful sun dried tomato bread and a variety of different tomatoes (green, yellow, orange, red). I also pulsed the olives in the mini processor and added to the vinagarette. I also added every herb in my garden to the dressing. Finally, I tossed in some crumbled feta cheese just before serving. I will make this over and over. Enjoy!

This was incredible. I could live off of this salad. Make sure you buy quality bread. I added prosciutto to make it a refreshing main meal dish on a hot summer evening.

By far, one of my all-time favorite recipes -- simple, adaptable to what you have on hand, easily doubled or quadrupled (or more). I made it 10 years ago when it first ran in Gourmet (the photo was irresistible) and brought it to a family reunion full of very mainstream eaters. Many turned up their noses at the "soggy bread" salad, until they tried it. On a table full of many yummy family favorites, it was the hands-down hit. Ten years later, people still remember it, and still ask for it at get-togethers. I've added small slices of fresh mozzarella, or even (yes) the shredded kind; "beefed" it up with cubes of hard salami or slivers of smoked ham, and substituted balsamic vinegar and even (gasp) store-bought croutons. All drew raves, but the recipe is at its best as written, with ripe summer tomatoes as the star.

I have never commented on a recipe before but I feel compelled to defend this one's honor... IT'S AMAZING. I discovered the recipe last week and have already made it three times. I'm addicted. It's great with day-old/slightly hard bread and balsamic is a nice substitution for red wine vinegar - but both are lovely. MAKE THIS RECIPE NOW!

Waste of home-grown tomatoes.

My variation: use sour dough, day-old bread, cut in large cubes, toasted to a deep gold. Add to tomatoes just before serving to keep it crunchy.

The taste was fine, I used Balsamic vinegar instead of the red wine. My bread got way too soggy, though, so next time I'll toast it first. Couldn't find fresh marjoram, so I used dried, but next time I'll use fresh.

During summer when heating up my kitchen is the last thing I want to do, I happily make this salad. It looks colorful, is easy to make and tastes summer fresh. Sometimes if I want to stretch it, I add artichoke hearts, penne pasta and double the dressing.

I've been making this recipe since it first appeared in the magazine and practically live on it during this part of the year, when the tomatoes are at their peak. Cannot rave enough about it. A real favorite of mine and I eagerly anticipate the end of July and the month of August, so that I can make it.

Truly a 4-forker! Just had this for dinner and had to review while the flavors were still bursting in my mouth! Wow! Fresh, light, and full of flavor! Only change I made was to add a smidge of anchovy paste to the dressing. Served with a Sangiovese...SUPERB! Great hot weather meal...no cooking. Will be making again, and again, and again...

This salad was a great showcase for my homegrown herbs and tomatoes. I didn't have marjoram, so used thyme. I also added thin slices of salami and provolone cheese to make it a full meal. I think I will add balasamic next time like suggested, and toasting the bread slightly is a good idea too.

this recipe was pointed out by the good cooks in Gail's. it was easy to make and delicious with summer time tomatoes. it was so good, i made it again two nights later and added a jar of artichokes and 1/2 cup cubed mozarella and called it dinner. i adored this recipe and its definately a keeper.

I made this recipe (scaled for 8) for a family get together. I served it with grilled pork loin roast and spaghetti with homemade pesto. My sister said "I could make a meal out of this salad" and she is right...it was just delicious! In fact, I just emailed the recipe to Kathy.

This salad is awesome! I've made it twice and everyone wants the recipe. A great way to use all those fresh summer tomatoes. I toasted the bread first and used some balsamic vinegar as suggested by others and loved the results.

Have made this salad many times since it was printed in '96. Made it again last night and since I didn't have red wine vinegar I used half balsamic and half cider vinegar and yes, it was great. Also didn't have marjoram so I used homegrown thyme as well as the basil. And used regular black olives rather than Kalamata. Yum! (By-the-way, if your bread gets too soggy, just toast it lightly the next time.)

Yum--this is great and tastes like summer. Use fresh marjoram if you can--dried can be bitter.

My mother and I have been making this salad for years. We use fresh tomatoes (picked that morning) from the local farm stand. We make a light dinner out of it, pairing it with fresh, incredibly sweet and tender corn on the cob from the same farm stand. It's one of my favorite summer meals!

This is the first salad I think of when our home grown tomatoes begin to ripen. It's the best. I use the "crustiest" sourdough french bread I can find and the freshest herbs. Even people that don't like salad, like this one.

excellent! i was concerned that i would have soggy bread, so toasted cubes of french bread. also didnt have fresh marjoram -- used dried instead. definitely a make again.

The dressing was fine, but the combination of the other ingredients was just awful! The bread became soggy and wasn't offset by a more solid textured ingredient. There are so many other (much scrumptious) ways to enjoy a tomato salad than this! Would NOT make this again unless a substitution for the bread is recommended.

This has been a true favorite recipe since 8-96 I fell in love with it in Tuscany and it is the most authentic recipe for Panzanella I've found. Fresh marjoram is essential and I can't imagine it without olives.They are traditional It's the greatest summer salad. Follow the directions exactly. Take the time to find marjoram or better yet, grow it in a pot like I do

This was so easy and so delicious. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. I left out the olives b/c I didn't have any and I used dried herbs. It still tasted great. I'd only do it with great summer tomatoes.

Skip the olives and go nuts on the tomato. Fresh basil is key with this dish. Also, be sure to mix and serve immediately as the bread at the bottom of the bowl can get a little soggy.

Rating: 3
A great, hearty salad. It would be wonderful with grilled chicken breasts, fresh corn, and a fresh peach dessert. I used spiced sicilian green olives (that's what I had) a lot of fresh basil, and only red tomatoes. I also would suggest using balsamic, rather than red wine vinegar. The bread gets soggy quicky so if you have leftovers I would suggest tossing or eating the bread pieces. The leftovers were great the next day on toasted bread as bruschetta.

I added sauteed capers and porto bella mushrooms, and my tastebuds are still in shock!

Easy, delicious, fresh and healthy. I made it tonight with tomatoes given to me by my Italian neighbour (you should see the size of the plum tomatoes he grows). My husband says the salad deserves 4 forks. It is really very nice and something you feel quite righteous eating. I used fresh oregano from my garden because there was no marjoram at the market. The two herbs are very similar. I'm trying tomato recipes as fast as I can while they are in season. Two that I plan to make are Mom's Gazpacho and Grilled Chicken with Tri-Color Salsa. In about three weeks gardeners will be trying to unload their excess tomatoes-leaving them in boxes on windowsills at work-I know I will. Can't eat 'em all. When it rains it pours.

I made this today for lunch served with fish. It was real different. I didn't have olives but added a little sliced onion and the only bread I had that I thought would work was bagels so I used one of them. It was very refreshing, I still have some left,it made a lot for 2 so I hope it will still be good tomorrow, I am wondering if the bread will be too soggy to eat by then but we loved the flavor, I think it would be a really good pot luck dish and would add the feta cheese if I had any I think it would be a good addition.

I found this recipe in the original Gourmet issue in 1996 and used it throughout the fresh tomato season that summer. Unfortunately, I lost track of it until now. It is simply the best way to combine red, ripe tomatoes, fresh basil, and crusty bread. Make it now!

I agree with the other reviewers. The better the tomato and the bread, the better the salad. I did not have olives, but used a little vidalia sweet onion, I did not have majoram, but used fresh chopped oregano and parsley. Very good!

I really liked this recipe. We did have some left over the next day, and wracking my brain for some recipe I could use it in, I came up with soup. I added chicken broth, a few more tomatoes, adjusted the spices and heated it all together. At the last I used my stick blender to make a smooth consistancy, added just a bit of half and half and served it with some bruschetta. A great way to use leftover bread/tomato salad!

This recipe far exceeded my expectations. I used 3/4 pound heirloom tomatoes (green & yellow striped, Brandywine, and yellow) plus 1/4 pound regular NJ tomatoes. We took it on our Labor Day picnic. I kept the bread cubes separate and mixed everything once we got to the park. Not only was the dish beautiful to look at with all those colors peering out, but the flavor was magnificent. I might try adding a couple red onions next time but the recipe really stands beautifully on its own. YUM!
