This was fine, but nothing special. Wouldn't make it again, although it was an interesting way to use radishes.

Surprisingly delicious. I tossed the vegetables with olive oil, salt, pepper, crushed garlic and dried oregano -- then finished it with some grated romano cheese. It will become a regular on our dining rotation....

I used to be a radish hater...not after this recipe. The radishes get a sweet flavor from roasting. Did cut the oil a bit, just enough to coat the vegies. Yummy, healthy, and easy to make.

As a combination, this worked well--excellent with a squeeze of lemon. I think the key is not overcooking the radishes so they retain a bit of firmness and their taste doesn't mellow too much. I only added enough oil to just coat the vegetables. I could see this being really tasty cold tossed with pasta or tortellini, lemon and a bit of feta or shaved parm.

Ugh! I thought this was absolutely foul. The radishes did lose their bite but became absolutely bland. I can't even see how this could be made better and if there was a minus fork rating I would be using it for the first time ever! I definitely will not be making this again.

Way too oily. Would cut the oil to less than half of what was in recipe. Pretty good flavor and easy to make but as others have said...I wouldn't dirty two pans again. Next time I'll roast in one pan.

This dish was very easy to prepare, and for its simplicity, a good choice as a side. I bought the radishes destemmed, and used a little less than a pound for two people. You can basically apply the technique in this recipe to any vegetable.

Unbelievable how good it was. I thought it sounded wierd, but thought I would try it since the reviews were so good. I will be making this again and again.

When I received turnip sized radishes in my CSA bounty I was at a loss with what I would do with them. This recipe took was was very sharp woody radishes and made them delicious. I too reduced the oil and roasted both the radishes and zucchini together for 20 minutes. This is a recipe I will recommend to my friends who partiipate in our Community Supported Farm co-op.

This was an excellent side dish. Cooked Radishes-who knew??? I cut back the olive oil by half and followed the previous reviews of 400 degrees-that worked out perfect

I was skeptical about the length of time to roast these but it's correct. I followed the recipe exactly except I did reduce the amount of oil. It was fantastic! I'll be making these again and again. I may try adding fresh herbs, garlic, or maybe mint just before serving. Endless possibilities, but good just as written. Was also great at room temp and would be excellent on brushcetta.

The bite from the radishes completely goes away and is replaced by a sweet caramelized flavour. This was absolutely delicious.

Excellent way to use a huge bunch of big radishes. I roasted at 400 on a foil-lined baking sheet. I halved the recipe and added olive oil and salt until it looked correct. (We roast vegetables all the time.) 20-30 minutes appears to be correct even at 400. Some of my radishes were the size of medium turnips and very pithy when cut. They still tasted great after roasting.
