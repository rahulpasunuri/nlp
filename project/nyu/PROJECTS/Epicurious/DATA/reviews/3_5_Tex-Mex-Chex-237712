I love this recipe and I use it a lot. One thing I always add is Taco Seasoning. I always seem to have some on hand, and adding a teaspoon into the mix REALLY adds to the Southwestern vibe.

I disagree. I liked this a lot! I had no Tabasco, because I don't like it. Instead, I moistened a tbsp of cayenne pepper with rice vinegar. It's very flavorful and the heat kind of creeps up on you. My guests couldn't keep their hands out of it! I also don't care for wheat chex so I substituted white cheddar popcorn.In the end I would call this combo "addictive."

I'm going to give this one fork simply because it gives me a place to start. When prepared as directed above, very "blah". All I taste is Chex and no Tex-Mex. I found some stuff in my pantry called "Cajun Shake" and dumped a bunch of that onto the mix. At leat now it tastes like something other than breakfast cereal.
