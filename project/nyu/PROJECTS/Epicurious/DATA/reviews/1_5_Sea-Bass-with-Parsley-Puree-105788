I should've listened to everyone before me. This was awful. I didn't get the right consistency in the puree at all. It was watery and well put by someone before me, it tasted like cut grass. Blech.

The sea bass was great, but skip the parsley puree. It was terrible.

I had a wonderful laugh reading the other reviews and figured I'd never try this one...

The puree was like eating cut grass. Smelled alarmingly like cut grass as well. Fish was okay, but a more appropriate sauce is in order.

I wouldn't call this recipie incredible. There are many more interesting and flavorful sea bass recipies listed here besides this one.
