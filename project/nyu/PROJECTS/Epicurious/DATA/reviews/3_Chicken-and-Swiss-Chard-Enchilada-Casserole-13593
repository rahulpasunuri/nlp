This recipe was great, also definitely a little time consuming! I would make it again, but probably in smaller batches to freeze for future servings. My notes are as follows: 1) Added chili powder and oregano to MX red sauce. 2) Sub'd jalapeño for red chili flakes 3) Sub'd Mexican 4 cheese blend for Parmesan 4) Used a flour/corn blend for tortillas and just toasted them on gas flame rather than fried them 5) Double all the cheese and garlic!

It was a good way to use some of the crop of chard but a bit bland. Next time I would use queso fresca or similar rather than jack or maybe a blend.

I went looking for a way to use the chard we'd recently obtained from our veggies share (CSA). This recipe used a lot of the ingredients we had in the share, and we loved it. Making it again for a potluck tonight (since we received more chard this week).

I love this recipe. It is a good jumping-off point - you can follow the basic outline and easily vary it to suit your needs. I also do not cook the tortillas. I steam them in the microwave for a few minutes if I feel they need softening up. I use canned enchilada sauce and pre-grated cheese to speed things up.

Good vegetarian-style too: I substituted black beans and thick slices of sweet potato that I softened in the microwave. Plus green olives and unfried tortillas.Definitely make the tomato sauce- it adds spice and can be used to add moisture when reheating.

This was comfort food - but i simplified it. I did not fry tortilla's...why? I used regular tomato sauce and fresh salsa. I did not add any chicken broth. I added chopped kalmata olives. It served like a lasagna, meaning it kept its layers nicely.

This sauce was very good, though I didn't thin it with broth or use as much oil when I transferred it to the stove. I also constructed this like enchiladas and not just a casserole so I used less tortillas. Very tasty.

This is one of our favorite chard recipes. Like many others that have rated this recipe, we also make a few changes. We always use flour tortillas. I have fried them in the past but based on all the reviews I will try just using a little Pam next time. I always use fresh tomatoes from the garden for the sauce and add a little extra cheese. Someone else said it is a little like mexican lasagna and I agree. Even my kids will eat it and they do not typically like chard.

A relatively healthy enchilada dish! I also cut the recipe in half, doubled the garlic and omitted frying the tortillas. The only other change I would recommend is leaving out the stems on the chard; they make the texture a tad gritty. I've tried it with green instead of red enchilada sauce and both are equally tasty!

Okay, I admit I was looking for anything with swiss chard because my garden is overflowing at the moment and I just didn't want any more sauteed chard with garlic but this was awful. AWFUL!! The texture is terrible, it's mushy and it's very ugly. UGH!!

Terrific! Easy to make, and my husband and I couldn't stop eating it! Just a couple of changes: halved the recipe, doubled the garlic, used a combination of monterey jack & cheddar, and warmed the tortillas on the stove instead of frying them. Used Rotel spicy Mexican tomato sauce, which worked just great - but might try a good red enchilada sauce next time. We get beautiful organic chard here, which might have made a difference. In any event, I'll be making this again and again.

My husband and I loved this dish! It's a perfect Saturday night supper with a green salad and a bottle of red wine! I used flour tortillas and the Mexican Hot Sauce recipe from the original Moosewood cookbook which did not need to be thinned with the chicken broth and it was scrumptious!

The recipe was a little time consuming the first time around but isn't that usually the case? The adjustments that I made were, 2 bunches of chard, always more garlic, meat from one whole chicken that I cooked in chicken broth, and 2 cups each of monterey jack, and mild cheddar cheeses. Softened the tortillas by putting directly on gas flame for 10 secs. each side. For the sauce I used a 24oz. can of plum tomatoes juice and all, the onion and garlic, 12 ozs. of a chipotle salsa that was added after the initial cooking, and 1t. dried oregano. No furthur need for the chile pepper after the salsa. I used apprx. 1.5c. of stock from boiling the chicken in to get the right sauce consistency. The end result was enjoyable. Will use this recipe on a client of mine with even more chard.

Great recipe! I had taken a similar recipe from Bon Apetit to a luncheon many many years ago and it got rave reviews. What a treat it was to find this recipe..its even better! My husband will not eat mexican food at a restaurant, but loved this dish. Served with sour cream and guac, used kale instead of chard ('cause that's what was in our organic CSA box this week) and used a packet of enchilada sauce mix with 1 can of tomato paste mixed in. Poached the chicken and used the broth to reconstitute the sauce mix...there was just enough sauce (but then again, we tend to like our cassesoles and pastas moist rather than saucy...) Frying the tortillas or using any kind of oil is completely unnecessary; jsut warm them over a gas burner flame (as others have posted). This is a hearty, rib-sticking recipe for fall or winter, and is easily vegetarian adaptable. Ole'!

I made a lighter (and easier) version of this by not frying the tortillas. I just sprayed them lightly with cooking spray and then heated them directly on the gas burner (you can only do this if you have a gas stove, but you could also put them on the grill for same results). I also used mexican style stewed tomatoes instead of making the sauce. It was delicious and got high praise from all!

Excellent way to use up the last of a roast chicken. This dish was nothing to put together yet still tasted great. Easy to adjust to your particular tastes. We substituted one pack of frozen spinach for the chard. Serve with sour cream and sliced olives. Great week night meal.

My husband and I love swiss chard and are always looking for different recipes. This was definitely different. We used flour tortillas instead of corn, but did everything else as written. We loved this recipe. We thought the flavor was fantastic, but perhaps some of that comes from using garden fresh veggies.

Sorry to be the lone dissenting voice, but this was terrible. Maybe it was because I took the suggestion of frying the tortillas in just a little oil and added more sauce, but this turned out nasty and soggy, without much flavor. The cheese was totally lost. Luckily I was serving it to good friends who forgave me, but still, it was embarrassing.

This was a fair amount of work but worth it. I made more of the sause than indicated as others reccomended. I decided to make the corn tortillas from scratch, which is definitely worth it if you have the time. It's actually pretty easy... just use two cutting boards if you don't have a tortila press (which I don't.) I cooked the tortillas till they were toasty instead of frying them.

WOW! What a great recipe. I'm sure you could use so many shortcuts, such as use frozen spinach instead of the Swiss Chard and use jarred tomato sauce. But I think that would take away so much of this great taste. We deep-fried turkeys for Thanksgiving and used left over white meat for this casserole. It is outstanding!

My husband said that this was mushy and he did not like the consistency. Perhaps it was because of the fried tortillas. Not a do over for us.

i made this for a CINCO DE MAYO party...everyone really enjoyed it. i added an extra cup of the tomato sauce since the other reviews felt it needed more sauce. i also added some sauted chirozo sausage. i certainly will make this dish again...it reminded me of a mexican lasagna.

This recipe is devine! Even the kids loved it-a keeper!

This was kind of strange, but not bad. I also used spinach instead of chard. A couple thoughts: there didn't seem to be enough of the filling mixture to make enough casserole to fill the pan. Definitely skip frying the tortillas: wrap them in foil and bake at 350 for 10 minutes instead. Excellent tomato sauce! (Can also double as great fresh salsa w/ a little added cilantro.) I had to add more cheese, which I didn't want to do, to fill out the casserole. Overall, worth making if you have time. I'll find out tonight if it serves well after being frozen.

I made this in 1990 when it was first published however, I lost the receipe and was delighted to find it again. For a lower calorie version, spray the tortillas with Pam and fry...it works great and does not detract from the flavor.

Just made this recipe last night with the swiss chard we received from our organic farm. Made a few changes - didn't add the last layer of corn tortillas and used salsa instead of Mexican style tomato sauce. 2 1/2 cups of sauce even thinning it with the chicken broth was not enough. Would add more sauce the next time. All in all, the dish was delicious.

We loved this dish! I made a vegetarian version by adding fresh sliced mushrooms to the garlic/chard mixture. Next time I'll throw in some black beans, too. This one is a keeper!

This is a great recipe for Sunday night football. One variation: dip the tortillas in warm water to soften - save the calories for the fried ice cream...

This is a lot of work. I made a double batch and it took over 2 hours. However, it was worth it... great reviews and lots to go in the freezer. I did one batch with spinach (instead of chard) which was yummy. Also, I used flour tortillas and didn't fry them beforehand but rolled the contents like traditional enchilladas.

I served this at a casual dinner with friends. It was delicious. Also served tossed salad and lots of beer!

I modified (I always do) the recipe slightly and used flour torilla's so no frying was involved and rolled the torilla's to make "real" enchilada's it was a delicious variation!

I found this dish rather heavy. Instead of drying the corn tortillas and then frying them in oil I would simply heat them in a hot non-stick pan or over a gas flame until they are softened.
