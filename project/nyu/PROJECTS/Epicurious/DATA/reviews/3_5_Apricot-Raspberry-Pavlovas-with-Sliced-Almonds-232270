I've made pavlovas over the years and this was probably the best recipe I've used. For the first time I had perfect, white pavs, no cracks, no soggy middle, and not too sweet! Served with kiwi fruit, strawberries and double cream (yum!), my guests loved them. And the "leftover" pavs were delicious on their own! I've thrown out all my other pav recipes. This one is a keeper!

An excellent but very dessert. I would reduce the sugar in the fruits to 1/4 cup and completely omit the sugar in the cream. Otherwise, it was my first attempt at making a meringue and it turned out beautiful!

Easy to make and beautiful! I found the servings too large (this is surprisingly rich) and halved each serving the next time I made them. Rave reviews from everyone - old ladies to ravenous rugby players.

I thought this recipe was easy and delicious!

I didn't have all the ingredients so I used a little vanilla essence for both the cream and meringue flavorings, and raspberries on whipped cream. Guests wanted the recipe. However, the meringues were "softish" and not firmer as pavlovas should be.

I was disappointed with this dish. Usually everything I choose from this site is absolutely wonderful. This was too sweet for myself and my children. (We are all chocoholics and love sweet stuff!) None of us could finish our Pavlovas. I would recommend cutting the sugar content down by one cup.

This was terrific and really a very easy summer dessert. Next time, I would skip the whipped cream as it is not needed. I added a cut-up mango and some strawberries to the apricots and raspberries. Everyone loved it.

This was easy to make and delicious! I served it at a ladies luncheon and everyone devoured it! I doubled the recipe and it came out perfect. I would serve it next time without the whipping cream as you really don't need it.

What a wonderful variation of the classic Australian dessert, Pavlova! I too was intimidated at the thought of making meringue but it's incredibly easy if you just follow the directions! I prefer to do mine with a variety of berries (raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, and any other delicious berry) but the apricots give it good colour. You might also consider sliced kiwi fruit which also adds wonderful flavour and colour!

Simple and simply fabulous! I've been intimidated by the thought of making a large pavlova - but the individual ones were perfect!
