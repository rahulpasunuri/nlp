Not sure this is Superbowl worthy unless you have a bunch of health-conscious people hanging around. Still it's very good. See more: http://homesandbabies.blogspot.com

Great little dip. Easy to make. Needed a tad salt for me, but other than that... wonderful!

This dip was delicious and simple..but I probably added 3 times the amount of cumin!

Always a huge hit at office potlucks! I double all the ingredients, as the original recipe just doesn't make enough for a hungry crowd. I usually add a few dashes of hot sauce and a couple of tablespoons of minced cilantro for a little extra zing.

Forgot to mention the pita chips...Try brushing a little olive oil on them and sprinkling with zatar(a mideast spice blend based mostly upon tangy sumac), or if you want to avoid the oil, just rub the inside surface of the pita with a cut clove of garlic. Makes much tastier pita crisps.

This is very similar to the tahini-free hummous I make, the only difference is I start with a finely-sliced medium onion, saute in the olive oil until soft, add the garlic and toasted cumin and cook for a couple of minutes. I also add some chopped fresh parsley right at the end for bit of fresh green flavour (I suppose cilantro would work too, if you like it, I don't). If I have to add liquid during pureeing, I use plain water, I find the liquid from the tin can make everything too salty.

If you're looking to completely cut out the fat, you can subsititute more bean liquid or plain yogurt. If you use yogurt, you can cut back a little on the lemon juice.

Served this to my dinner guests this evening. They loved it and wanted the recipe. I didn't have olive oil, so substituted canola oil instead.

I tried cutting the pitas horizontally and gave it up after the first one. Too time-consuming. Since they were double thickness, I baked the chips about 5 minutes longer than the recipe specified. They are robust enough to handle a thicker hummus and beautifully crisp.

Sure beats any store-bought hummus and it's so easy to make! I will definitely make this again.

We love this lowfat version of hummus. To make it creamier just add more liquid from the garbanzo beans. We especially love the cumin in this recipe. One of our favorite spices.It adds so much flavor. Just follow this recipe and enjoy the flavor. We spread on fresh pitas from a local store. They are baked fresh daily.

My husband and I really like this recipe as an easy, low-fat snack. It's very easy to make, and it offers a nice alternative to snacking on potato or tortilla chips.

Since this recipe did not use the word hummus, I didn't expect hummus. I thought the balance of lemon juice, garlic, olive oil and cumin (be sure to dry roast it as suggested to bring out the essential oils and remove its raw taste)was perfect. I wasn't looking for "creamy" which all dips shouldn't have to be. I actually ate this as a very healthy, high fiber(garbanzos), vitamin C filled(lemon juice) essential oil (olive oil)lunch!

Add about half a cup of yougurt and more lemon, it will turn out creamier and more authentic. You can use fat free yogurt. Everyone loves this recipe when I make it.

I agree, it's hard to find a fat-free or low-fat recipe for hummus. I have given up and usually end up buying store bought ones and adding some of my own herbs, garlic and other spices. As for the chips, I have been making my own variation for a while now. I lightly spray them with vegetable spray (like Pam or Mazola) and sprinkle with some garlic and a little parmesan cheese before I toast them. Great as a snack on their own!

it tasted good... after i added nearly half a cup of lemon juice.... i don't think i've ever found a recipe for hummus that didn't require more "juice"... lemon juice, oil, something to make it creamier. i liked the taste of cumin, but i still don't think this recipe is terribly original. by the way, day or two old pita is perfect for making the "chips" which of course are better if you brush them with a smidge of olive oil before you toast them.

Ditto previous reviewer's comments. Check out "Hummus with Yoghurt and Lemon" on this same website (B.A., 11?/97). Much better basic recipe -- and there are even better ones than that. P.S. Try roasted garlic -- it's sweeter and takes a lot of the garlic bite out if you're inclined to like more (as we do).

Somewhat bland, dry, and not as creamy-mouth-feeling as regular hummus, but I think that's b/c the recipe skimp on fatty ingredients such as tahini and olive oil. I added adobo sauce for some kick and flavor. I think some chopped herbs would be a nice addition too.
