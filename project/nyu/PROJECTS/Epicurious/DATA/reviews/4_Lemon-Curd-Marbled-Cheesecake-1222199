I have made this cheesecake at least a dozen times and it is so perfect it is ruining my ability to try new recipes. I used to be all about never making the same thing twice and experimenting new things on my friends, but this is so good I keep making it over and over while new or different recipes go neglected. Anyway, I wanted to comment on the cracks. I do not use a water bath, and I used to freak out about the cracks, but I learned to embrace them. I simply reserve a few tablespoons (up to 1/4 cup) of the fabulous lemon curd (the cheesecake doesn't need all of it anyway) and I fill the cracks with leftover lemon curd, smooth them over and chill it so the curd firms up. It makes gorgeous and delicious ribbons of unexpected lemon curd that provides a nice, tart counterpoint to the creamy cheesecake. I use a tiny spoon to do this and then a little paintbrush to smooth it all over. So if the cracks bother you, you might want to try that, especially if you're a lemon freak like I am.

An absolutely fabulous recipe! I'm new to baking cheesecake. Bought some Lemon Curd from Trader Joes, cut the recipe by 1/3, and added lemon zest to the cream cheese mixture. Baked it about an hour. It did crack a bit but tasted so wonderful-who cares!

Really, really great cheesecake. I took this to a Christmas party and got SO many compliments on it. I was very pleased. I made it exactly as written, no changes. Like other reviewers, I also had cracking on the top along the lemon curd swirls, so that was disappointing, but not a huge deal. Next time I will put some water in the oven along with the pan and try the suggestion of another cook who allowed it to partly cool in the oven with the door ajar. We'll see if that helps.

This was a breeze to make and got rave reviews at a potluck. I followed the recipe exactly and found that the lemon flavour was delightful. The only cracking that I got was dents along where I had swirled the custard and cheesecake fillings together, but I found that made it look all the better. I did top it with a layer of whipped cream and a dusting of lemon zest because I quite like whipped cream. I'm not sure that I'd do that again though, as it hid the gorgeous swirls (what a choice - pretty whipped cream and zest or swirls... too many pretty choices!)

I've made this countless times and it's been a hit each and every time! Thinking of modifying for a fall theme with apples and caramel swirl--any suggestions?

Beautiful cheesecake that is really quite easy to make. The lemon curd is fresh and tangy, just right to cut the decadence of the cheesecake. Mine didn't seem to cook as quickly as I expected--I had to cook it a bit longer than the recipe recommends. I put a dish of water on the rack below the cake as it baked as well, then left it at room temp overnight and in the fridge all day before serving. It did crack a bit but this was along the swirls so it was almost a bit artistic. Served with a not-too-sweet raspberry puree. Got lots of requests for the recipe and will definitely make it again!

Rave reviews from everybody who tried it. I intended to double the lemon curd, as per a review, because who DOESN'T love lemon! I accidentally doubled only the lemon juice, sugar and zest, using the original amount of butter and egg in the curd. It was fantastically lemony, and I am making it again today for a family dinner, with that same delicious 'mistake'.

I made this cheesecake (a day ahead) for a large family gathering to rave reviews! This is not only the best cheesecake I've ever made, it's the best cheesecake I've ever eaten! Sooooo smooth and creamy and luscious! A big thank you to previous reviewer 'MeeMaw' for her baking tips. Worked like a charm ~ baked to perfection and no cracks.

Rating: 4
This is an excellent dessert. Tangy lemon and smooth pudding like cheesecake. Lemon curd took nearly 1/2 hour to thicken. I would consider purchasing the lemon curd if time was a factor. Bake for 1 hr. rather than 45 min. Some of the center did not set up even with 1 hour of baking.

Rating: 4
I've made this for several potluck neighborhood dinners, and everybody wants the recipe. This time, I didn't have fresh lemons on hand, but I did have "Cutie Clementines" or mandarin oranges. Made the curd with them (about 3 clementines for 1/2 C juice, and all the zest from all three to ramp up the flavor.) This is the best one yet! I'd suggest doubling the curd recipe, both to have layers, and to make sure you can spread it to the edges so every amazing bite will have a little orange surprise. Wonderful, wonderful recipe!!

Great tip - from a poster on All Recipes: I love to bake cheesecakes. I bake them and give them to "cheesecake lovers" for their birthday (or other special occasions). My cheesecakes never fails or crack. I bake them as such: I preheat oven to 350 degrees, put my cake in the over, and immediately turn the heat to 250 degrees. Bake 1 and 1/2 hour -- turn oven off and leave in oven for at least three hours without opening the door. Remove from oven and continue to cool. When completely cooled, refrigerate or freeze. I prefer to freeze for a few hours to aid in the slicing. I carry cheesecake to all "bring a dish" food affairs -- and they are a hit! My grandaughter-in-law always says, "MeeMaw don't buy me a birthday present, just make me a cheesecake". It is rewarding to be appreciated.

A very good cake. I added yellow food coloring to the curd for more impact in the swirl. I also doubled the amount of the curd and used it as a sauce next to the cake on the plate, no on the cake. I also added whipped cream on the top with a small lemon wedge and mint sprig. Finally, regardless of all methods to try and stop splits, they still happen. I mend them by pressing the split together with a wet table spoon. This works well. Yes, I'll make it again.

This turned out very nicely, particularly using Meyer lemons. Here's an easy way to check if a cheesecake is done: the internal temperature will be 160º-165º when it is fully baked. After it reaches this temperature, I just remove the cheesecake from the water bath (yes, I use one!) and place it on a cooling rack on the counter until it is at room temperature, and then put it in the refrigerator. AFTER the cheesecake is completely cold, I cover with plastic wrap. Be sure to give the cheesecake a full 8 hours (at the minimum) in the refrigerator before serving. Finally, to prevent cracking, apray the entire pan with pan spray, cover the bottom of the pan with parchment, and cut 2" x 2" squares of parchment and shingle them around the side of the pan (they will adhere to the pan spray). Yes, it's more work, but this was how I was taught to make a cheesecake, and I have NEVER had one crack.

Loved this! So easy and tasty! I had to use store-bought lemon curd and ended up using about 8 oz. I think next time I'll up it to 10 oz. Cooled with the door ajar for a bit before removing it from the oven and no cracks!

OMGoodness! Wow what a great cheesecake. The lemon curd is a tangy surprise as you navigate through the cake with your fork. I didn't tell anyone it was there and I have to tell you that the look of pleasured surprise that appeared on my families faces was priceless! I added raspberries to the top as well.

I got rave reviews when I made this. Two things I did differently--I bought the lemon curd to save some time and I used gingersnaps and no sugar in the crust instead of graham crackers. Once, I added the sugar like the crust recipe calls for and it was fine the first day but it became hard candy the second. The gingersnaps are sweet enough on their own. I highly recommend this cheesecake, especially in the summer.

This recipe is super tasty and much easier than I expected. Like many of the other reviewers, I served it with a raspberry sauce (my choice: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/foo d/views/Raspberry-Sauce-105380) but didn't put it on the cake until service so everybody could see the beautiful yellow and white marbling of the cake. I love cheesecake but don't know if I could ever describe any cheesecake I ate as "light" until now. The combination of fresh lemon curd and raspberry sauce made the cheesecake feel light and seasonal.

Rating: 4
I agree with the previous poster re: letting cheesecake sit in oven after it is turned off with door left ajar with a spoon for about 45 min before removing it and letting it cool for another 20 min on the counter, and THEN putting it in the fridge with saran wrap gently placed on top so that the top doesn't get to gel-like.

As per advice from Cooks Illustrated website, I baked the cheesecake at 325F for 60 min in bath and center was still a bit softer than I would have liked when serving it after 5 hours chill time. I strongly suggest you make this early in the morning or the night before your dinner party. Making this dish anytime after noon the day you plan to serve it is a mistake. Baths minimize chance of cracking. If you attempt this, take care to use LOTS of tin foil around the spring form pan so that NO water seeps in. The easiest way to do this is use foil that is extra long - not the regular box size. You need lots of foil to wrap around edges. For whatever reason, the 2nd time I made this, I had too much lemon curd in the cheesecake. If you add too much, the marbling effect / swirl effect doesnt show and that's half the beauty of this cheesecake. I used two 8 oz packages of cream cheese, one 8 oz package of marscapone. I don't think using the more expensive cheese made a big difference - as I have now made this recipe twice. I made a raspberry coulis using this recipe: http://www.grouprecipes.com/71380/cheesecake-supreme-with-raspberry-sauce.html Guests love it! One of my favourite cheesecake recipes.

Great light cheesecake. I used less sour cream,(1/3 cup), after reading other reviews. It came out perfect. Something I learned to prevent a cheesecake from cracking is to let it cool slowly. After baking, I turn the oven off and open the oven door a quarter of the way and let the cheesecake cool down for about 5 minutes before moving to a rack.

I got the biggest rave reviews for this cheesecake. It really is out of this world. I made a really simple raspberry sauce to go with it (just strained berries and a little sugar. I never get why people insist on cooking a raspberry sauce to within an inch of its life! :)). The cake is also gorgeous. I've had troubles in the past with cheesecake but none whatsoever with this one!

Great, but could be better, and this is why - the actual cheesecake recipe itself. The crust was a good standard, graham cracker crust. The lemon curd was fabulous, and I will definitely keep this part of the recipe. However, the cheesecake I did not feel as good about. It wasn't bad, it was good, but I feel the added sour cream doesn't help it any. Yes, it is less dense, however, it also took two days to firm up completely, the calorie content was higher, and thus, people felt much fuller after dessert. I make cheesecake for my family fairly often and try different recipe, and all of them felt that after eating, it felt heavier in their tummies, and would rather go back to the more firm, lighter feeling in their stomachs, cream cheese free recipes.

My heart sank when I realized I forgot to lower the temperature after baking the crust. I wound up baking the cheesecake at 350 for 30 minutes, then I turned the temp down to 300 for the remaining 15 minutes. It was perfect! Everyone at the office loved it. There were a few cracks in the top, but smaller ones blended in with the swirls and the larger one was easily hidden by a few artfully arranged strawberries. I highly recommend this one.

we made this last night, and it was just ok. The lemon curd might be good in another recipe, like a jellyroll, but here I found it distracted from what should have been the simple,rich, delicate flavour of the cheesecake. we also had problems with the cake setting, so despite adding an extra egg, and cooling for the recommended time, when we went to serve it, it was a runny mess. love this site, and this is one of the few recipes I've made from here where my rating is vastly different from others. very dissapointing

This was my first cheesecake, and because other reviewers spoke of the ease in preparation, I gave it a shot! I used key limes, and because I like things a little more tart than average, I added just a little more key lime juice than the recipe called for. It was not necessary, the recipe as is, is just right! Added chopped pecans to the crust, and it was a very big hit for my friends 40th birthday party!

I made this recipe - but about as low calorie as I could (neufchatel cheese, Splenda sweetener, low-fat graham crackers and egg whites for some of the egg) but the taste is still divine. Mine needed to stay in the oven a little longer (about 15minutes) and it did have cracks (which may in part be due to my changes in the recipe) - but the taste of the cheesecake is divine!

I've made this recipe twice in the last two weeks because it was so amazing! The first time, it was my first cheesecake, so I used a jar of lemon curd from my pantry and just blended it in with the last 1/3 of the cheesecake batter. It was delicious, but very runny. The second time, I followed the recipe almost exactly, except that I cooked the crust about 3-5 extra minutes, and I left the cheesecake in the oven maybe 10-15 minutes longer than the recipe suggested, because it just wasn't very set after 45 minutes. While it had a few slight cracks around the edge, it was beautiful and, more importantly, absolutely delicious! Making the lemon curd from scratch was not difficult and it was totally worth it, both for the taste and the decorative touch (since the jarred variety wouldn't really allow me to make it look marbleized). This is one of my new favorite recipes! My boyfriend wants me to try it next with lime curd!

Easy to make, both deliciously tangy and sweet. I doubled the lemon curd, thought I'd spread the extra over the cooled cake-but the marbling looked so attractive I didn't want to cover it and served the curd as a sauce on the side. I'm going to use this recipe any time I make lemon curd for any purpose from now on-it's more tart than most and very fresh tasting. My oven is a bit slow and the cake took an extra ten minutes or so to get to that barely-held-together-only-shimmery- in-the-center stage. It did firm up nicely as it cooled and was of perfect consistency the next day when I served it. This is one cheesecake that should be cut right from the fridge, though. I used a separate pan of hot water in the oven and did leave the cake in with door closed, then open, as described below, when baking time was up. There was one small, virtually invisible crack. Couldn't be happier with this cake, rich but refreshing, an excellent end to even a very filling meal. I'll be making it again and again.

Fantastic! I thought it had the perfect balance between the tartness of the lemon and the sweet & savory of the cheesecake. I baked it for the amount of time in the recipe and it wasn't under- or over-cooked.

Amazing. I didn't swirl the lemon curd into the batter, I was too afraid of ending up with uneven globs of lemon throughout the cake. Used the curd as a topping after the cake cooled. Also, 45 min is no where near enough time. I ended up forgetting the cake was in the oven and baked it for an additional 45 minutes. While that may have been too much time the cake did not suffer. A do-over for sure.

Baked at 325 for a little under an hour, then let cool in oven propped open with a spatula handle for an hour. Cracked all to heck. Good thing it did, too, or I would not have come up with the idea to make a basic raspberry sauce to hide the cracks. Without the sauce it would have been really, really good (despite being cracked and ugly). With the sauce, it was transcendent. Despite being cracked, the texture was PERFECT. It got rave reviews at Christmas dinner. I'll make this over and over again, hopefully figuring out how to keep it from cracking in the process.

This was my first time baking a cheesecake, and it turned out perfect! I used all organic ingredients. I followed the directions exactly, except I left it in a lot longer than directed. I baked it at 300 degrees (I keep an oven thermometer on the rack since temperature dials are often quite inaccurate) for an hour and 25 minutes. No water bath, no cracks. Cooled on the counter for about 10 minutes, then in the (off) oven with the door propped open with a knife handle for about 2.5 hours, then chilled it for 4 hours. Texture is creamy and consistent throughout. Flavor is excellent.

has to be one of the easiest and best cheesecakes I've ever made. Made first on as stated, 2nd time I made Key Lime curd for it and added 2 tbl. key lime juice to batter....Yummmm Served this at family Thanksgiving dinner. it was the hit of the dessert table

This should not be considerate a vegetarian dish because of the eggs. Make sure you tell your truly vegetarian guests the content so not to make a faux-pas. Great dessert though and fairly easy to make. A cheesecake lover dream. but I brought it at a Hindu prayer day and still live to regret it.

I can't rate this yet because I haven't made it (but will soon because it sounds fabulous). To the reviewer who wondered what to do with leftover lemon curd ... I use it as a topping on my wheat toast in the morning (it's fabulous!). It keeps for a week or so in the fridge. To the reviewers who mentioned their cakes cracking ... I don't like baking in a water bath because I can't seem to keep the water OUT of the crust, even with multiple layers of heavy-duty foil. Instead, I put a 13x9 baking pan with about an inch of water on the oven rack beneath the one that the cheesecake bakes on. Also, after baking, I leave the cheesecake in the oven for 10 more minutes with the oven off, then another 10 minutes with the door cracked about 6 inches. This has always worked for me. I can't wait to try this recipe!

I don't understand why people enter a forked review when they didn't follow the written recipe. Anyway, this cheesecake is wonderful and an absolute crowd pleaser.

I can't stop eating this cheesecake! I'm down to my last slice and am contemplating making a new one tomorrow. Wonderful flavor...but as many others lamented - it did not set even after baking in a water bath at 325 for one hour and leaving it in the closed oven for an hour after that. Luckily, we're not too picky! But I will have to play with the bake time some more before serving this to guests

This is a great recipe! We made it in my culinary arts class for our cheesecake week. I left it in for an extra 10 minutes, and let it sit out for three hours before refridgerating it. Also, instead of using salt in the crust, we used salted butter. It came out great! My cheesecake did not crack, but I did not leave it in the oven to sit. It set great!

This is a go-to recipe for guests and family. I have had people who say they "don't care for cheesecake" admit how much they enjoy it. The lemon makes it taste lighter and fresher than ordinary cheesecake. I always serve it with a blueberry sauce made with as little sugar as possible - even a bit tart. As many have commented, it needs to bake for an hour, NOT 45 minutes. But, other than that, I follow the recipe to the letter.

Excellent recipe, will make it again. Got rave reviews at dinner party, even from husband who isn't a cheesecake fan. Baked it for extra 25 minutes. Make sure you make the curd from scratch as it is softer than purchased curd and swirls well. Served with warm blueberry sauce. Try it, you won't be sorry!

Yum! This time I substituted key lime juice for the lemon juice and left out the grated lemon peel. I also didn't bake the cheesecake with the crust, but patted it on later (as in The Cake Bible by Beranbaum) - worked great, no soggy crust. Baked 10 extra minutes and the interior was still very soft after being chilled - tasted fine, but didn't cut great. No cracks; I always bake cheesecake in a water bath, but remove it immed. from the oven.

I thought this was a great, refreshing cheesecake! It was also relatively simple to make. Next time I will use less butter in the crust because it ended up slightly greesy. I also had to bake it about 15 minutes longer than the recipe stated and it still didn't completely set in the very center. I will try a water bath next time because it cracked in the middle too. Overall, it was fantastic!

Rating: 4
Fabulous! Made it once as the recipe stated (but baked in a water bath). This morning I'm baking it with a gingersnap crust (2c crumbs, 2+ tbl chopped candied ginger, 6 tbl butter). The key to not cracking is to cover the outside of your pan with 3 layers of foil to make it water tight, put it in a roasting pan and fill half way up with boiling water. Bake at 325 for 1 hr, turn off oven and open door. Let sit for another hour. Cool completely and refrigerate. Perfect!

The cheescake and lemon curd was delicious, but the crust was actually quite terrible. I followed the suggestions of others reviewers and didn't add the salt and only a few tablespoons of the sugar. I think this was a big mistake. The crust was very, very bland this way. As for baking times and method, I baked mine in a water bath for 45 minutes and then turned it off and let it sit in there for another 45 minutes. No cracks and perfectly baked!

I loved this recipie. Its simple,easy, and the results were wonderful! I baked it at 300 for 1hour 10min and that seemed like it was the right amount of time to cook off the cheesecake. The results were a fluffy, soft texture. The flavor from the lemon curd was very subtle and did not overpower the cheesecake itself. However, I did what some of the reviews suggested and turned off my oven and left it in there for an additional hour and thats were I had an issue. My cheesecake cracked.

Rating: 4
This was a big hit at my husband's office. I used Meyer's lemons which are sweeter than traditional lemons. I found it hard to judge the lemon curds doneness - I didn't see any swirls made by the whisk - and may have cooked it until it was too thick. It did not pour smoothly, and went in more as globs. Consequently, I did not get a pretty marbling effect. However, the taste was sensational. I used a water bath, following the instrutions on a pumpkin pecan cheesecake also on this website. They did not need any additional cooking, but I did use a convection oven.

Awesome with a few changes. I simply used gingersnaps and butter for the crust. Absolutely no need for sugar or salt. Who would ever do that? Made a microwave lemon curd that is wonderful and much simpler than this recipe. The cake looked and tasted fabulous. This is a very soft and creamy cheesecake so no need to keep at room temp. before serving. I baked mine in an aluminum springform pan for 1 hr and 10 min., shut the oven off, opened the door wide and left the cake in for 1 hr. It was stil jiggly but perfect when served.

I loved this cheesecake! The flavors are perfectly balanced. This is a really creamy cheesecake, so if you prefer your's more New York style, this probably isn't for you. The lemoncurd is really easy, although you don't have to stir it at all while cooling as long as you put plastic wrap on top of the curd to keep a skin from forming. I used gingersnaps as many others because I love the lemon and ginger combo and it was fine. Maybe next time I would use a little less butter. And I agree with others that leaving the cake in the oven after turning it off and using a waterbath helps with cracking. I did cook this 10 minutes more than the recipe called for and it turned out perfect. I will definately make this again.

Everyone who tried this cake had the same basic remark: "The cheesecake itself is great, why is there salt in the crust?" One person actually thought that it was a pretzel crust. I personally am confused as to why there needs to be anything other than butter and graham crackers in the crust, but as long as you cut or leave out some of the salt, it's good. Not my favorite cheesecake, but still pretty good.

Tasty recipe but two fixes have to be made. FIRST reduce salt in the crust to 1/2 tsp at most, likely 1/3 is optimal. SECOND reduce sugar in cheesecake to 1/2 cup at most. CURD: Finally, one portion of curd is sufficient. I made double the portion and it was too much. While delicious on its own, what does one do with an extra portion of curd?

This is by far the best cheesecake I have ever made. My kids have already requested that this recipe be made for each of their birthdays. It's not as heavy as most cheesecakes and the lemon curd adds a wonderful zest that is really terrific. I made a blackberry sauce to drizzle on top. Other reviewers were correct...this took about a full hour before it could come out of the oven. I also stuck to the graham cracker crust, which was delicious. Enjoy!

Made for Thanksgiving dinner and it came out quite well. Reduced the sugar in the cheesecake step by 1/4 cup and baked in a water bath. Increased the baking time by about 15 minutes - was still jiggly in the middle but set up really nicely as it cooled. Next time I might increase the cooking time by a little bit more.

Great tasting cheesecake, though I cut the sugar by half (and I still considered it fairly sweet). I would agree that it was a bit too creamy (not stiff enough) texture-wise, though the tartness of the lemon curd was a nice addition.

The only thing that I change is for the top swirls of curd, I try to smooth a little of the batter over it to keep the cracking of it down. I also have been making a blueberry sauce as an accompaniment. I usually add a touch of lemon zest to it.

This is the best cheesecake recipe. I made it exactly as the recipe states for a recent birthday party, and everyone was blown away. I then made it again using low fat cream cheese and fat free sour cream and it was still fantastic. As for the cooking time, when I made it the first time I cooked it just as the recipe stated but turned off the oven afterwards and left the cake in there for about 15mins. It was perfect. But with the 'low fat' version, it didn't seem to be setting up as nice so I left it to cook about 30 minutes longer, which was far too much. This is a great staple recipe!

Luscious! This is an excellent, easy and delicious recipe. I followed the recipe almost exactly except added one egg and it came out beautifully. I did get some cracking, but I just filled them in with some extra lemon curd that I kept back and nobody was the wiser. I did change the crust - I used crushed nilla wafers, macadamia nuts and some toasted coconut, and it was tasty. This was a mother's day gift and was warmly received with raves all around. Definitely a keeper!

This is unbelievably good. It is a little more time consuming than most cheesecakes, but not difficult. I made it for a group and all professed to be blown away. Mine did crack on top despite using a pan of water, and did require about 20 min longer cooking time than prescribed, but I would still make it again.

Read quite a few reviews and made a few of the recommended changes (longer cooking time, a water bath, and increased crust to the top. Made two for Easter and had to tell everyone where to find the recipe! Absolutely Delicious!

Excellent recipe. First time I made lemon curd. So easy and I believe it makes a difference. The only thing I did differently, is that I baked it in a water bath leaving it in the oven an extra 30 minutes. It was perfect, the creamiest cheesecake I ever made and I am known for my cheesecakes. I can't wait to make this again!

This recipe made a delicious cheesecake for Easter dinner & other than the cooking time, I followed it exactly as written. Made the lemon curd & crust 1 day ahead - both were EZ. As other cooks have noted, cooking time is not adequate. I followed my cheesecake-baking- insincts & left it in the oven for another 15 mins, when I noticed that the center was still liquid (please note: not 'wobbly', but LIQUID) after 45 mins. I turned off the oven & left it in for another hour with the door closed. Opened the oven door a jar & left it in for another 30 mins. Removed from oven, cooled on rack until cold. THEN I refrigerated it overnight. Picture perfect & delicious the following day. Cut slices with a knife dipped into cold water, then wiped off after each cut, which resulted in perfect slices.

I have made this cheesecake 2x. The second time I made it with a ginger snap crumb crust. It was NO WHERE near as good as it is with the regular graham wafer crust. Don't alter the recipe! However, I would cook the cheesecake for almost an hour, per previous posters' comments. I left it in the oven for an hour after turning it off, and it seemed to minimize cracking but the center came out too soft. When I served slices, it was runny.

Help! The cake was delicious, but I made a ginger snap crust using the graham cracker recipe (I added 1/2 tsp. ginger). Butter all over my oven! It took me all day to clean up. Is it from the warm lemon curd or the crust? Maybe I need a real recipe for the ginger snap crust?

A big hit with my friends and family. To avoid cracked cheesecake, read this article: http://www.dianasdesserts.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/bakingtips.cheesecakes/Cheesecakes.cfm Basically, bake the cheesecake for 45 min, turn off oven and leave in oven for another hour. At 45 min, the cheesecake is supposed to have a 2 - 3 inch wobbly centre and appear uncooked. It will continue to cook after the heat is off. The cause of cracked cheesecake is temperature changes. To further avoid this and encourage even cooking, the water bath is also suggested but I've never done it.

This is the best cheesecake I have ever tasted. Light, tart, creamy. Warning it took me 2 to 3 times the recommended time to bake. Also, if you use a high butterfat butter, you may end up with a very dirty oven and a smoke-filled kitchen. I am making it again this weekend for a party; yum.

This cheesecake is delicious. The tartness of the lemon curd, seems to lighten the density of the cheesecake. I had a jar of Fortnum & Mason lemon curd, so I used 10oz. of that instead of making my own curd. Some of the curd sunk to the bottom, but I think that was because I put too much curd too close together on the first layer. Also, I would cook this longer next time, as middle was pudding-like.

Delicious and a hit with all at Christmas. Mine took about 70 minutes. Only change I made was to make a ginger snap crust as I think ginger snap crust and lemons were meant for each other.

If you are a lemon fan, you will love this. It's light, tart and so creamy and wonderful- with the sweet and crunchy crust. I made it in a rush this Saturday, hurried it into chill mode and it still was wonderful. My friends swooned. I did bake it an extra 15 minutes to firm up the interior.

this is really good! for people who might be curious how it fares with lower fat ingredients, i made it with light sour cream and used light cream cheese for 1 of the 3 packages- still great!

This is our large extended family's all time favorite. I've been testing various cheesecakes on them for years so they're experts. Hint: If you butter the springform pan [bottom and sides] it is unnecessary to run a knife around the pan to loosen it.

My husband & I don't even like cheesecake - but we LOVED this! My new nephew from Chicago (married to a So Cal girl-my niece) had to have the recipe. SO EASY, and DELICIOUS. I'll make this again & again.

My lemon-loving neighbor says this is one of the best desserts she's ever eaten. It certainly is pretty with a thin coat of lemon curd, sliced lemons, and mint sprigs. I made two recipes of lemon curd and used half to ice the cheesecake. This is a light and creamy concoction rather than a dense cheesecake and so is not as filling. It would be a lovely addition to a dessert table but is not too heavy after a meal either.

Excellent!! I am a beginner at desserts but it was very easy to follow the directions... definitly cook for extra 15 minutes

Alternative garnishes: add slivered almonds to crust mix. Garnish sllice with candied ginger for sugary 'bite.' Make a fresh blueberry/sugar reduction on your stovetop, spoon over cheesecake. Or, chase with a *blueberi* martini after a nice, long dinner with friends.

This cheesecake was sooo good. I loved the creamy texture and the lemon curd was to die for. My cheesecake did crack a little, but I didn't use a water bath. This is the perfect summertime cheesecake!

I made this to take to Christmas dinner, I can't believe I forgot to rate it! This was the best cheesecake I've ever made, or eaten. I used Keebler Club Crackers instead of grahams because I was out of grahams, and it turned out great. I think this would be equally good using a lime curd...but as-is, this is one fabulous cheesecake!

This Easter Sunday dessert and the family loved it! We served it with sliced strawberries macerated in tangerine juice. As others have said, cook it in a water bath about 15 minutes longer than the recipe says.

This was delicious-- I love the lemon curd against the rich creamy cheesecake! I made the curd and the crust one evening, and the next day made the cheese filling and baked it. The curd swirled perfectly (I think chilling it overnight helped).After straining the curd, I did add some extra finely grated lemon peel back in (hey, this is So Calif and we have a very productive lemon tree in our yard)!! I should have read the review before making this-- I followed exactly the dreictions, but the middle of my cheesecake was still more creamy than it should be -- I believe the other readers are correct - it should be baked 10-15 minutes longer! I will definitely try this again and also try some other of the suggestions that sound very good such as gingersnap crust and candied lemon garnish.

I loved this recipe! It tasted and looked like restaurant quality and was easy to make. I used Nilla Wafers for the crust - next time I would cut down on the salt as Nilla Wafers must be saltier than graham crackers. I thought the crust was a bit salty, no one else noticed. The lemon curd was super easy and delicious (also did double boiler method) and definitely worth it. I used a water bath but still had a crack, perhaps from refrigerating before completely cool. Yum! Many, many compliments. The texture was perfect, and not too sweet. I candied lemon slices (4mm cuisinart disk and boiled in simple syrup) for the top which was a beautiful addition and easy decoration.

My curd didn't "disperse" through the cheesecake as I had hoped it would. I believe that it may be better to put it on while still a bit warm, becuase it thickens as it cools. Ginger snap crust is a must! Delicious!

I brought this dessert to a friends dinner party. He now refuses to invite me again unless I bring the cheesecake. When I make it again I will make the cheesecake mix before the lemon curd. That way I can get the lemon curd the same consistency. This should help the swirling process. A key to success was removing the cheesecake when set 1 1/2 inches from the edge. The center firmed up and made the whole thing lighter.

It is delicious! This site is so great with the previous chef's helpful advice and hints. Yes, it took longer to bake than the recipe suggests and I did use a water bath as it's no big deal and can't hurt. I made extra lemon curd because I was going to put some on top but it was so beautiful with the marbling that I didn't. I also used a skewer to marble as another suggested. I will definitely make this again. My family loved it, especially my husband who prefers a "lighter" style of cheesecake.

Oh my! I've been searching for the perfect cheesecake recipe for years (it's my favorite dessert). I think I've found it with this recipe! Creamy, rich, tangy...just wonderful. I used crushed gingersnap cookies for the crust and I thought it was delicious this way as well. As one reviewer mentioned, the swirls are lovely and there was no sinking. Do take the time to make the curd - I almost used bottled lemon curd and am glad I didn't. It is wonderfully fresh-tasting. Am going to make it again this weekend.

I'm a tough critic of my own cheesecakes, but this was fabulous. I used a similar curd recipe, but substituted half sugar/half Splenda. I made the cake filling following the recipe exactly; but for the crust I used Nilla wafers & Splenda Brown Sugar Blend. I think it was the best cheesecake I've ever made! The taste was rich, but with a lovely tang from the lemon curd. It swirled nicely with a metal skewer (no "sinking"). I did increase the amount of crust slightly, because I didn't like that dark layer that showed in the current pic, which I suspected was the lemon curd up against the heat of the pan. My crust came up the side about 1.5", so it was no longer visible. What a beautiful and great tasting cheesecake! I'd give this five stars if I could.

Rating: 3
The first time I made it I followed the instructions to the letter. The crust was way to hard to cut through, so since then I use 1/3 less sugar. Other than that, it's a sure hit! Everyone likes it, they even ask for second helpings!

Wow, this was great and very easy. I used gingerbread graham crackers which made the crust even more yummy. I also reserved quite a bit of the curd for the top to make the top of the cake very decorative.

I wasn't sure I would like lemon mixed with cheese cake, but it was fabulous! I'm not crazy about graham cracker crust, so I substituted Nilla Vanilla cookies for the graham crackers and added an extra tablespoon of butter. Everyone loved the cheese cake, but the crust is what everyone raved about - kids and adults alike. They were all asking for it to be made again soon.

This is a very good cheesecake. But there is an even better one on this site. Check out the Lime Mousse cake at http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/103648 The Lime mousse cake is awesome. I have been making it for years and everyone loves it.

This cheesecake has it all. It's bright and lemony without being overly sweet or sour, it's rich without sticking to the roof of your mouth. I cooked the lemon curd using the double boiler method since I wasn't 100% sure my pans wouldn't react with the citrus, and I used a water-bath for the baking to prevent cracking. For Thanksgiving I made the curd on Monday, the crust on Tuesday, and finished the cheesecake on Wednesday. It was just beautiful.

This was by far the best cheesecake I've ever had! It is creamy, rich, and light all at the same time. The tang of the lemon curd reminded me of the overall flavor of a key lime pie almost. Tip for those who said their curd fell to the bottom. I cooled mine just until it was room temp, not cold. That way it was about the same temp as the whipped cream cheeses and I think that helped keep it in place. I also put about 1/3 of the curd in the middle, and 2/3 on top, which was perfect, so you have a nice 1/8 inch thick layer of swirled curd on top, which looked, and tasted gorgeous. I didn't use a water bath, and my cake didn't crack. Maybe lower the heat a little? This is a wow dessert. We served it with fresh whipped cream and a drizzle of Grand Marnier and it was just decadent.

I've made this twice now and it's just delicious and so easy - but I had to bake it an extra 45 minutes at 300F both times, and my oven is usually pretty true. I won't take it out unless a knife in the center comes out clean, though.

A really great cheesecake. I used about 3 limes and 1 lemon to make the 1/2 cup of juice. The curd is super-easy to make. I also baked mine about 1 hour in total to have the edges set as the recipe describes. The cake ended up being quite soft in texture, but not so liquid that it didn't hold its shape when cut. Next time I'll try a gingersnap crust.

I expect to be asked to make this for every family event in the future! EVERYONE RAVED! I too baked it about 15 minutes longer than the recipe suggests and it was still just set. I made the homemade lemon curd and it did not sink... it is super easy to make though. Having made it now - I do not think I would ever buy curd for any recipe. Oh! My cake also looked exactly like the photo - I love it when that happens!!

Very good! I made 1/2 recipe & used about 1 1/4 cups of my homemade lemon curd instead of making this recipe's curd (because I had recently made two batches). I used two 5" springform pans & needed to cook the cheesecakes at least 5 minutes longer than the recipe stated. The lemon curd did not sink but was perfect. One 5" cheesecake generously serves 3.

I used an 8" pan instead of a 9" and this resulted in an additional 35 min of cooking time. I followed the exact recipe & my cheesecake looked exactly like the photo. By far one of the best cheesecakes I've ever made (& I've made a few). All guests raved on & on - - this recipe is a keeper!!

DON'T MISS THIS ONE! WOW! This was probably the best cheesecake I've ever eaten, and believe me, I've eaten a few! I made the lemon curd from scratch -- worth the extra trouble! The crust has more salt than usual, making it doubly delicious ... kind of a pretzel crust thing. Really really good. I made a duo of these for a party a month ago, and everyone raved. I'm doing it again this weekend. And by the way, do serve with ice cold, fresh blueberries, sugared overnight in the fridge. YUM.

I had to bake it 10-15 min longer than the recipe said (and by the time it was chilled it was just barely set in the middle, so it wasn't a matter of me overcooking it. Otherwise, I absolutely loved it!! I will definitely make this again.

A big hit at my house and dinner party for the boss! I ate too, too many leftover slices of this yummy cheesecake. One thing I would change: my springform is 10", so the crust was a bit thin. Next time I'll make more crust. I also agree about needing to bake it 10-15 mins longer.
