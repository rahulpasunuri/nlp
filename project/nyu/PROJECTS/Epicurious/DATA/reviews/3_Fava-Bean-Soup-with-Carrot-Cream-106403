i made changes to this because of the reviews i read. i figured it needed thickness & flavor, i immediately tossed in a head of garlic to roast. i used 2 lbs. of frozen podded edamame. cooked it longer, used a gigantic white potato instead of a yukon gold, did not add any water-only 32 oz. chicken stock. and i decided not to make the carrot cream topping because i am not a fan of sweet soups. fantastic! reminicent of a broccoli soup, the edamame shines through, the parsley works ( i used an entire bunch of italian & cooked it in for awhile to reduce it's flavor) one of the most unusual soups i have ever made. i would never have imagined edamame soup.

I, too, found the recipe bland and tasting like potatoes and carrots. Considering the cost of fava beans I wouldn't waste my $$ putting them in. However, it makes a good, if thin, potato soup.

This soup tasted more like carrots and potatoes than fava beans. I'll try to find another fava bean soup recipe.

Hmmm...maybe it is too late in the season for good fava beans? I followed the recipe exactly and found the soup to be very bland - the parsley was the strongest flavor in the soup. The carrot cream made it edible, but the soup just wasn't very good.

Hi. I made this soup using frozen edamame, and part miso and part chicken for the broth. I really liked the savory, creamy, nutty flavor of the soup. It is tastey and comforting.

Not fair to discuss this recipe before I try it but I was raised on fava beans and I cant wait to try this recipe, it sounds like a keeper. My fava beans will be ready in the garden soon and I will post my results here. Canned fava beans are often substituted and give excellent results. I sometimes find them fresh in Italian (or Mediterranean markets). Fava beans is a comfort food for many Canadians raised in the Saguenay-Lac St-Jean area of Quebec. Not readily available in Ontario and the rest of Canada. It's easier to grow them if possible but the season is very short and the yield ratio very poor.

I've made this twice, once with fresh favas and once with frozen edamame. I liked it both times. It's not a showstopper, just kind of homey and tasty. However, the carrot creme is REALLY yummy and I put a big dollop in (more than I should). Fava beans are a pain in the neck to shell and peel, so I'd probably stick with the edamame if I made this again.

I wish I liked this dish as much as the other reviewers did. Mediterranean cooks swoon over fava beans, so I have tried to find recipes that show me how wonderful they are. This dish tasted of the beans, so if I liked their taste, (which I would describe as "dusty") I would have liked this soup. But for something as labor-intensive as this soup, the result was not awesome. The carrot cream, however, was pure delight. I'll have to find something else that I can use it on.

Never had fava beans before - couldn't find fresh ones anywhere - used canned. The soup was fabulous! All guests had at least two helpings and, because I doubled the recipe, I had some left over for dinner the next day. Wonderful flavour. I'll definitely make again and keep my eyes open for fresh fava beans!

This was an excellent soup, and the carrot creme made it sweet. I ran out of veggie broth, so used beef boullion instead (28 oz.) and Sherry instead of white wine. Also, I only blended 1/2 the soup, so it stayed a little chunky. Mmmmm... delicious!

Excellent, excellent, excellent!!! I couldn't find fresh favas so I used soy beans and the soup didn't suffer any from the substitution (I'm a fava bean fan). It's easy, quick and simply delicious - the carrot cream takes it over the top!
