We loved this! Followed recipe as written, using creme fraiche instead of sour cream (will try crema next time), and it was de-lish!

We really enjoyed this. Next time I will do a double batch of peppers, so that I can freeze half to cut prep time. I will also use crema instead of sour cream. It was mild, but you could throw in a serrano or jalapeno to spice it up.

An awful lot of work for a very bland payoff. Too bad, it looked so good!!!

This was a good idea for a recipe and I appreciated the techniques but I am never, ever again roasting poblanos and using them as-is. Poblanos need SUBSTANTIAL cooking time even after being roasted. I thought to steam them in the microwave for a few minutes but that was nowhere near enough. Tip: If you wait for the peppers to cool a bit first, you can use greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I personally find greek yogurt delicious, and nutritionally it can't be beat.
