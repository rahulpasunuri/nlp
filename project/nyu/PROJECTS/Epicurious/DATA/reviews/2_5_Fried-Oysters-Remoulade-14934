Make a real remoulade...

Rating: 3
This was delicious! I made it for my boyfriend who had never eaten oysters before,we ate them all. I also found some frog legs at the store so I just floured them the same way and fried them right along with the oysters. The remoulade was wonderful. It went well with both.
