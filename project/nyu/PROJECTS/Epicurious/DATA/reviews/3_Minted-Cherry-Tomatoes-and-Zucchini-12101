Made recipe as written and because of the heat of the vegetables the flavor mint was just wiped out.

Very easy and tasty - definitely add the mint just as you are taking off the heat to serve - otherwise it seems to get somewhat bitter. We just started having organic produce delivered to our home, and have had an abundance of zucchini - this is a lovely but simple way to serve excellent produce. I can see other options based on this simple but elegant recipe!

Easy and delicious. I added garlic and sausage because I wanted to make more of a main corse. I ate it with some plain yogurt on the side.

I've made this for a while and, yes, I do add garlic. Wouldn't make it without it!

I haven't tried it yet - always fry the zucchini and tomatoes, but never added mint - so know I will like it. Would adding garlic be o.k.?
