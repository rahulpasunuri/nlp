A good recipe. - a 3-1/2 forker. 9 minutes to blanch the leeks is a long time, I did it for 7 and even then they were soft enough. Use a sharp knife when slicing them or they will fall apart. Also, after this recipe I am finally going to invest in a good non stick pan. You really need it to keep the shape of the fish, and the presentation is important to the dish. Also, charring the leeks and the shin of the fish will do a lot for the flavor. I had a lot of squid heads left over too, so I used some of them (cut into rings) for garnish. But I'm still having calamari for lunch!
