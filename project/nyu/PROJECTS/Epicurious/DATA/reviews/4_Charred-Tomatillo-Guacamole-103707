I'll never make guac any other way than this way, ever again. The tomatillo has to be best kept secret is all secret guacamole ingredients.

I made this for my friends wedding of approx. 50 guests. I quadrupled the recipe by using 12 small avocados, but omitted the serrano chilies because I wanted this to balance out the spiciness of the salsa. It was a huge hit. We made so much that I thought for sure we would have leftovers but every bit of it was devoured.

This is so easy and exceptional - I use more chiles and extra avocado. Really quick and easy to prepare any night.

I followed one reviewer and roasted these until golden brown. This Guac was tangy and delicious. I will be making this for years to come!

Really delicious. Had no problem with the tomatillos (didn't core them). I did use a pestle, so I think that makes it a lot easier to break them up.Added some garlic, lime and tomato (seeded), and it was great.

Loved it - very easy, and a bit lighter than some guac's can be - a true hit!

Best guacamole ever! My only comment would be to remove the tomatillo stems before mashing. I had a problem with the skins, had to remove and cut up.

I've made this a few times and would recommend roasting the tomatillos at 400 until they are really soft and just starting to brown. Thought there was less bitterness from the charring.

Seriously the best Guac out there. Go for it, you will LOVE it!

Doubled the recipe as we had 12 guest over for an afternoon BBQ. On doubling, I decided that 8 serrano peppers would be a bit too hot so I made it with 6 peppers. It was perfect, a bit of heat but didn't call for a 4 alarm fire! =) I did add the juice from one lime just to help with color staying green rather than browning given the warm out doors and 2 hours mingle time before the main bbq dinner would be ready. Also, doubling wasn't needed as it make a very big bowl full and about half was left over. There were left overs mainly because everyone was watching their waist line and we had 3 other snack foods available before the main BBQ meal. All of the guest wanted the recipe so therefore I'm assuming they liked it. =)

Very good, but make sure to "core" the tomatillos prior to roasting to avoid one big chunk. Plenty limey all by itself...taste before adding more. Freezes well too!

I've been making this recipe for years. It is awesome! I add some lime juice, garlic and cilantro. Last year I grew tomatillos in my garden and froze them prepared. I always get requests for this recipe - it is the best guac I've ever tasted.

I reviewed in 12/07 and have made a number of times since then. A couple of additions since then: a) had leftover roasted serrano chilis from the Roasted jalapeno Salsa recipe on this site - subbed these in with the fresh hot peppers - amazing. b) Served with the Chili-lime triangles (recipe on this website). Rave reviews and as always, devoured.

Delicious! I made this for a BBQ last summer and the guests went nuts over it. I'm still getting requests for the recipe.

I didn't think that the Tomatillos brought that much to the table. My general feeling about Guac however is that even 'bad' Guac is good guac so if you are completely bored with guacamole and you absolutely need to add something, this recipe is for you...

Great for entertaining! I've made this guacamole more than a dozen times and my guests always rave and ask for the recipe. Last year I grew tomatillos in my garden, broiled them on sheet pans and froze them in individual servings so I could make this any time of year.

Very good! Smoother and creamier than a regular salsa, but still a bit chunky with the tomatillos. It was pretty mildly spiced with three seeded serranos. The tomatillos give this a tangy, limey taste, and I would not add any extra lime. This would be a good crowd-pleaser.

Exceptional flavour - so much more than the standard guacamole. Seeded the chiles, made as written. Outstanding - delicious as a side or simply with crackers or tortilla chips.

Very simple, nice flavors. I added a little extra avocado, but pretty much everything else was by the letter. I thought it was pretty good, but my wife loved it. I'll definitely be making again.

Loved this! Hubby will not let me make any other guacamole recipe. I also added lime juice, garlic and cilantro. The second time I wanted to make it, the tomatillos at the supermarket were all bad so I made it with jarred salsa verde from Whole Foods and it was tasty too. Not as good as with the fresh roasted tomatillos, but definitely good.

This is the best guacamole we've had -- and we make/eat a lot of guac! Due to unforeseen circumstances, we had to let the tomatillo mixture (everything except the avocado) sit for a few days before mixing w/the avocado. Other than that, no changes were made. Delicious!

This is my new favorite guacamole recipe - a sure keeper!! I think next time I might mince the red onion intead of chopping and I would try fresh lime juice. Other than that, this is a fantastic guacamole!!

I picked a bunch of tomatillos at a local farm and didn't quite know what to do with them. This recipe was the perfect solution to my dilemna. A nice twist on traditional guac. I made a few "edits": added lime juice, a garlic clove and cumin as recommended by other reviewer. I also substituted one jalapeno pepper for the serrano since I had jalapenos on hand.

The recipe makes a decent guacamole, but it's rather bland. I use this as a base recipe, but add 2 mashed cloves of garlic, a diced tomato, a squeeze of lime juice and a dash of cumin. It really perks up the guac. Don't skimp on the serranos. 3 gives a nice vegetal taste and a very pleasant burn.

For the first time I have ever made guacamole, this was incredible. I added the juice from one lime wedge and used a blender to pulverize the mixture, thus saving the time of having to chop cilantro, a harrowing ordeal.

When i first tried this recipe, following it exactly, I thought it was pretty good, but then forgot about it for a while until just a couple months ago. Now I make this slight variation almost every weekend. What I do differently is rather than char the tomatillos in the broiler, I smoke them on the grill with either mesquite or oak chips, depending on what I have on hand or what else I might be grilling, plus I also add the juice from one lime. The smoky flavor of the tomatillos really puts this over the top and people just can't get enough of it. I usually double or quadruple the recipe, except for the salt. I also pre-dice the avocados in the shell before scooping to make it easy to keep it chunky when I mix it up. Try it with carnitas!

Wow--this is the best guacamole I've ever tasted.Even my husband thought it was great, and he's not a huge avocado fan. We found this recipe to be a little heavy-handed on the salt, and have used only half the amount called for with good results.

Very delicious recipe, alot of work, but worth it! My only difference was the addition of two plum tomatores diced. After that, it only lasted a day in my house!

Excellent, excellent guac! Doubled it for a gathering of twelve and all was devoured. Lots of compliments, requests for recipe. I broiled the tomatillos; next time, I'm going to throw them on the grill. Bet they'd taste great, especially if one was grilling with mesquite.

We love guac around here, and this was a great variation. The tomatillos gave it a nice depth, I think. I'll still make my old standby, but I'll definitely be making this version as well. Yum!

This is just as wonderful as everyone says -- I served it with homemade tortilla chips (brushed with a lime-oil-cumin mixture and then baked until toasty) and the entire batch got gobbled up quickly! I love hot guacamole, but this can be intense depending on the heat of the tomatillos. My advice -- withhold some of the tomatillo juice (from the pan after broiling) and the chiles until you can taste it.

This is an outstanding dish. I put it on everything, from burgers to burritos and even by itself. Wonderful!!!

Lime suggested by other reviewers is a fine addition, although not critical. Also, remove the charred skins from the roasted tomatillos. Unless you're really sensitive to hot foods, you should use at least half of the serrano seeds. This is the best guacamole I've ever had, and I love guacamole.

Excellent with 1 habanero (remove seeds if HOT is not your thing), 2 cloves of minced garlic and a tsp of fresh lime juice! Thanks for the suggestions. Got rave reviews from family and friends...this had become a standard.

A consistent crowd-pleaser. I agree that the charred skins can be annoying; I add a few more tomatillos and eliminate the skins. Minced garlic and a generous squeeze of lime juice finish this dish perfectly. Try it!

Excellent guacamole with a nice kick. The only thing I question was the charred tomatillo skins which didn't want to mash.

The charred tomatillo add so much to the guacamole, I sliced the tomatillo and charred on a stove top grill pan, charred extra and froze for winter use, tomatillo self seed around here and are very easy to grow.

Certainly a fine recipe. As a certified chilehead, I'd make a couple of modifications. 1)add some garlic. 2)make it hotter by: a)leaving all seeds from @ least 4 seranos, or b)using the original method, using scotch bonnet or habanero peppers, or C)using 4 scotch bonnets or habaneros & LEAVE IN the seeds!!!!!
