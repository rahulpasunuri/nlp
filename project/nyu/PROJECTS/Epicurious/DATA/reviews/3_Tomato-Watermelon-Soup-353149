I used a pinot noir red wine vinegar and added 2 large strawberries - just 'cus they needed to be used. I served it with a roasted eggplant & red pepper, fontina, grilled turkey panini - delicious! Nice combo. A hit with the whole family. Everyone went back for seconds.

"1 tablespoon red wine or sherry vinegar" Do you mean to say red wine vinegar?

This is a weird flavor profile. I wouldn't make it again.

I made this soup for a dinner party with a bunch of college kids. It took minimal preparation and time. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. The flavor wasn't too sweet, mostly tomato but obviously not near as savory. It was very fresh and the feta and olives really added to the soup. I wouldn't suggest changing anything.
