An addition to my earlier review: I used nonfat Greek yogurt. Highly recommend.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious. I wanted to decrease the fat content so I used my Griddler, lightly brushed with olive oil, instead of the frying method. Worked perfectly. The feta cheese shines in this dish. I served the patties with chicken breasts marinated in the Turkish Delight marinade found here on epicurious.com.

Rating: 2
Tasted decent, but kind of blah, even with some doctoring of the seasoning (extra salt and herbs). I expected to like these more than I did. They also didn't hold together very easily - I ended up having to add extra flour. Given the amount of time involved in putting them together, not sure I'll make these again.

These were excellent! I realized after I started that my garden was pretty well cleared out of herbs (sadness), so I made some pretty big changes. Threw in a hefty tablespoon of green curry paste, and added Panko to thicken them up. Very very yummy.

I was surprised at how good these were, and I hate feta cheese. They definitely needed the drained (hopefully whole milk) yogurt. I used sour cream the second time I made them, which enhanced them even more. I also added a little sriracha that time, because the first batch was bit bland.

These are so good! I served them with tzatziki, and they were out of this world!

Used this recipe but added and omitted a couple of ingredients. I didn't use the parsley, dill or yogurt (didn't have any at hand). I added spicy thai tuna to the mixture and it turned out to be delicious. Also,used regular onion instead of green onions...loved the crunchiness it added to the patties.

So simple, yet so tasty! These were the first to get wiped out at a baby shower I hosted. Served with Tzaziki, it's absolutely divine. People who don't like zucchini (including myself) were devouring them. A quick delicious staple for any kind of party. Definitely check the salt levels of your feta. My feta was pretty mild and I had to add sea salt to balance the flavor.

Rating: 4
This is just fabulous and very simple! I have now made these for three different parties. The first was for 35 guests the second for 20 and the third for 100. Whether I doubled it or multiplied it by 8, the patties were fabulous and devoured with praise by all guests. The only caution I would add is to check the saltiness of the feta and make sure you balance it with the added salt...my first batch was a bit too salty for me. Also, for the big group I made a sour cream/yogurt/Dijon mustard combo to dab on top just for something different. It was also a hit. With a little creative effort this can be adapted for vegan, too. I now am making these to keep in the freezer for a quick lunch/dinner addition. So good!

Delicious! Great way to use up zucchini from the garden. I also found they froze well. Using the suggestions of some other reviewers, I did spice mine up with a bit of cayenne. I also "fancied" the yogurt up for a party with garlic paste and fresh mint.

Rating: 4
An excellent light dinner with a tomato- based sauce or over a frisee salad. I added fresh chopped basil and red pepper flakes for extra flavor and used diced halloumi cheese instead of feta because that's what I had on hand. The halloumi grills/fries very well and gave a great salty bite. Used a med ice cream scoop and smooshed (technical term) the patties in a nonstick saute pan until flattened. The thinner these are, the better - otherwise the texture is off. Would have tried to freeze them except they didn't last long enough. Enjoy!

These zucchini patties are so dang good! My family, including 2 kids who do their best to avoid vegetables, eat them in a flash. I always bring it to parties/potlucks and people beg me for the recipe. You can add to the recipe, even make them gluten-free and they are always delicious!

This is has the traditional Greek flavors I grew up with: parsley, dill, and onions, to which I added mint. If you don't have any so-called 'Greek' yogurt, just strain some plain yogurt through paper towels or a kitchen cloth for an hour or so (that's all Greek yogurt really is after all, strained, thick yogurt). When the summer zucchini crop comes in I make boatloads of these and freeze them between layers of wax paper for winter. The best possible quality feta from a Greek market makes a world of difference. Especially delicious if served with tzadziki, a yogurt-based cucumber sauce, also Greek.

These light savouries won over an avowed zucchini-hater! We did find them a bit too salty, however. (As some varieties of feta will be more salty than others, I'd recommend holding back the second 1/2 tsp of salt until you've fried up a sample patty to taste.) I wanted to keep as true to the recipe as possible, but after assessing my first few test patties, I went ahead and stirred in the reserved egg white with one large clove of garlic, finely grated, a pinch of dried oregano and some freshly ground black pepper. Ill make this base recipe again, playing with different aromatics as the mood strikes.

Rating: 4
Made these for a potluck and got RAVE reviews from everyone. First batch was close to the original recipe - used chives instead of scallions. Ran out of parsley, read other reviews and made the second batch with fresh basil, oregano and chives as the herbs, bread crumbs, chopped sun dried tomatoes, and garlic. Both flavors were very popular. A keeper.

Rating: 4
This was delicious! My 15 yr.old son who does not eat zucchini said,"I would eat this every night if you served it...they are amazing!" My husband and I loved them. I only put the 1/2 tsp.salt to get out the liquid. Skipped the next portion of salt...fried some up and they definitely needed the second 1/2 tsp.of salt. So I added the salt to the batter and then fried up the rest. Used dry dill but will try the fresh next time....did not taste the dill flavor. Highly recommend this recipe!

Rating: 3
I've made this twice now. Once, by following the recipe exactly and once by altering, based on previous reviewers suggestions. My opinion.....too bland as written. I spiced it up this time with a generous pinch of cayenne, omitted the parsley and dill and instead used fresh mint, basil and oregano along with a splash of fresh lemon juice and a 1/2 clove of crushed garlic. To the yogurt dip, I added more fresh mint, garlic and another splash of lemon juice. Definetely elevated the dish to 4 stars (with the modifications) and was well received by my guests.

Fantastic. Easy and superbly delicious, although instead of serving with plain Greek yogurt I whipped up some tzatziki. Next time--and there will be a next time!--I might play around with the spicing.

This is my favorite new summer party platter! They were a hit. I have made them several times as well and find that squeezing the excess water from the zucchini by using a dish towel works great. I also use half flour and half bread crumbs. I also omitted the dill from the zucchini cakes, but added it the yogurt for a nice change. I do like the previous reviewer's idea of using chives. Yum.

Rating: 4
Excellent! I've made this a few times. The recipe is just about right- once I over-salted it and that sort of killed it. But otherwise, very good. Also, I baked them once (to try to cut the oil)-- they were all right, but better fried.

Rating: 4
Everyone in my family LOVED these. Writing about them makes me want more. They were a nice appetizer (the yogurt is unnecessary in my opinion), but I agree that they'd be a good side. I didn't use quite as much parsley, and I substituted chives for dill because dill is one of the few things in this world that I will not eat, and I thought it was great. If you want to freeze these for later use, I would suggest just freezing the grated zucchini and adding the other ingredients after it defrosts. I can't wait to make these again. I'm craving them!

Best zucchini pancake we've ever enjoyed! Took the advice of another reviewer and used fine breadcrumbs, made for a great texture. Made these patties with the lamb dish in this menu, and some homemade naan flat- bread - great combination of flavors and textures.

These were outstanding! Can't imagine anyone wouldn't want ot make them again. I thought I had parsley in the herb garden, but ended up having to use cilantro with the dill and it was fabulous. I had feta from a Greek market so it was best quality and the though the yogurt was not needed, it was an excellent addition. I will be making these all summer and hoping they freeze well so we can enjoy them all winter, too. I'll be freezing two tonight and taking them out this weekend to see how they do...reheat should be under a broiler or in a very hot oven...we'll see.

Fantastic!! Made it as the appetizer for a dinner party with halibut with red pepper harissa, and roasted asparagus... went very well!

Rating: 3
A lot of prep but worth it. I drained the zucchini for 45 minutes, then squeezed it dry; I don't think 5 minutes would work, unless you wanted to add lots more flour. I used tarragon instead of dill, based on another zucchini pancake recipe here and it was fine. During dinner my husband and I debated whether we liked these more than the Sephardic spinach pancakes, also on Epicurious. We called it a tie when we noticed that we had eaten most of them!

Rating: 4
Very tasty! I skipped the dill (none at the store), and ended up using a feta that had tomato and herbs in it (the only choice). I would recommend using bread crumbs in place of the flour - more absorption. I made mine on my Foreman Grill and skipped the oil. They came out great and were that much healthier. The yogurt is a great addition. I will definitely make this again.

Rating: 3
Definitely one for the recipe box! But with suggestions: 1) Be sure to get as much moisture out of the Zukes as possible! Or you'll just have to use more flour. 2) I added 2-3 finely chopped garlic cloves, toasted pine nuts, and chopped sundried tomatoes. 3) I left out the dill. 4) Use the best quality feta you can find. 5) A little fresh lemon juice on the finished product brings out all the flavors with a bang!

Really fantastic. I followed the recipe pretty closely other than using canola and olive oil rather than corn oil (I just did not have any in the house).

I have now made these several times and they are amazing, although I made some changes. I don't care for feta and so followed a prior reviewer's suggestion of substituting fresh uncooked corn.

Delicious! Didn't have green onions so I used regular round yellow one. Also, didn't have any dill so I left that out. Still great though.

These are yummy. I normally hate standing around and frying things so I'll say they take a little longer than 5 min to get golden over medium heat. Otherwise they didn't soak up ANY oil and they were delish. I am having them as a main course with a fennel salad. Happy Summer!

I made these lat weekend, and they were perfect. Lots of requests for the recipe! I did let the zucchini "weep" for the alotted 5 min, and then squeezed out the remainng water with a lint free cloth.

I'll keep this recipe 'cuz I love appetizers that can be made ahead of time. Will most certainly make again!

This is a keeper for all those times when we've got an over-abundance of summer squash. I made these with yellow crooked-necks from the garden. Kids and I loved 'em! I didn't mix the feta in but saved it for on top when served. I think some nuts (pine nuts or walnut might make a good addition).

These little patties were delicious. Unfortunately I did not drain them long or well enough, so they were a tad soft, even after frying them. I will be sure to drain them well and will probably have to wring them out in a clean kitchen towel next time. I really liked serving them with Greek yogurt. I squeezed a little lemon juice into the yogurt and it lightened it up a bit.

Yummy! These were a big hit at a dinner party. I followed the recipe, though the zucchini does take much longer than 5 mins to drain. More like 30 mins. Because I let the zucchini drain for so long I didn't need any more flour than the recipe called for. I did buy the Greek yogurt for dipping. It's nice, though tastes very much like sour cream. A little richer, but still. Now I need a number of recipes to use up all that Greek yogurt I have as it only was available in a large container. Hmmm. Maybe more of these. Delish!

Absolutley FABULOUS!!! I admit, almost ate them all in one day. I did need to add more flour and I also added more feta (just used the whole container, I think it was 6 oz) and I added a bunch of crushed garlic. I served with tzatziki. Just fantastic. Making them again this weekend

My husband HATES onions, so I had to make this without them. However, just added more zucchini. And it turned out GREAT. I really recommend getting some greek yogurt or making your own yogurt cheese for topping these. I made them ahead (didn't use even half of the oil recommended in the recipe) and heated them in the oven without any compromise. You do have to work a bit to get all of the water out and I added quite of bit of extra flour. Will definately make again.

Five minutes for draining the zucchini is not long enough. I let it drain for more like 15-20 minutes, and still had to use wring it in a dish towel to get the excess moisture out.
