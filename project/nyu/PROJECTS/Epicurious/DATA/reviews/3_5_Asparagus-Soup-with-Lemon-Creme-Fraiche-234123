Very yummy and super easy! I saved the lovely tops, blanched them separately and added them after I pureed the soup. I used the food processor and straining wasn't necessary. The lemon creme fraiche is delicious with the soup. Will definitely make again.

This soup was fantastic. I added two cloves of minced garlic, doubled the lemon juice in the cream, and garnished with crushed red pepper flakes. Instead of straining the soup, I blended it with my stick blender. It changed the texture, but my husband and I loved it.

Extremely delicious, at least with my homemade stock, and with some whole milk yogurt I had rather than creme fraiche. Used extra lemon zest and juice, which was needed. I did strain and press the asparagus and found it worth the effort for company because I will use the leftover yummy asparagus mush in some ravioli, and the soup was very elegant in its strained form. For myself, however, I would not strain.

I prepared this recipe using Swanson's vegetable broth and other ingredients as specified. The asparagus was far from tender in 5 minutes as the recipe directed, and needed to be simmered longer. I strained the solids from the soup. (perhaps a mistake). The color of the soup was not as green as I had hoped. My husband thought it needed more salt. I agree with other reviewers who passed the creme fraiche with lemon separately. I was testing this recipe to use as a first course at a ladies' luncheon in April. The search continues - I will not use this recipe.

This soup was so easy to make and had great flavor. I left out the shallots accidentally, but I don't think I missed it. I also didn't strain the soup and kind of like a small bite of asparagus here and there. My boyfriend, who is more of a foodie than I am, even thought it was great. I paired it with the Meatless Monte Cristo, and it was a great dinner.

I would make this again, but use homemade vegetable broth or try chicken. I used Swanson's vegetable and not only was the asparagus flavor masked somewhat, but I detected an odd metallic flavor. Not sure the broth was the culprit, but something was slightly off, at least from my expectations. My guests, however, were extremely complimentary and the lemon cream I will definitely use for other soups, too. Delicious and the perfect addition.

A nice light alternative for a soup course. If you really want a lemony flavor, double the amount of grated lemon peel in the cream and grate a little bit over each bowl as a garnish. Don't hold out hope for floating the cream...it really will sink to the bottom. It would be much more elegant served in a side dish that allows everyone to see it and spoon in as much they like. Don't skip the straining, as that is what makes the texture of the soup so silky. Also, the solids that are left over after straining made a great base for an asparagus ravioli filling. With this recipe, even the unused parts are tasty!

We used a full stick of butter, the peel and juice of 1/2 a lemon and did not strain after pureeing. It was great! Served for a ladies' luncheon and they all loved it!

Very good! Simple but delicious, especially with the lemon creme fraiche.

I had some asparagus that needed to get used up and this was the perfect quick, easy, non-messy way to do so. I didn't have enough shallots, so I used some yellow onion as well, and I had chicken broth on hand, but not quite enough, so I filled in with water. I didn't bother with the creme fraiche (laziness, to be honest), but this was a great soup on its own as long as you have good asparagus on hand (it really shines!). I'll be making it again--next time for guests.

I made this for an annual outdoor potluck- type party and it was a hit among the guests (and the best thing I ate all night)...I might have used a little extra coriander but other than that I followed the recipe exactly - guess I got lucky with my asparagus. My mother thought the straining would make it too thin but I thought it came out perfect. The creme fraiche was a little disappointing however - adding enough lemon to be able to taste it made it too thin. We ended up whipping it back up a little to make it stand up more to the soup (also added some basil). All in all it was a success and I can't wait to make it again.

This recipe absolutely requires the freshest asparagus as it is the highlight. I wouldn't suggest straining the entire soup as it will leave you with green asparagus juice. Add some unstrained, well blended soup to the pot with the strained remains. Seeing the little green flecks made me happy. I served it in coffee cups to prevent the soup from cooling down too quickly when serving. Yum!

Love it. Have made it twice - once as a light summer dinner and once as the starter course to our Easter roast dinner, where we roasted lamb. The lamb turned out horribly, but luckily we already had this lovely soup in our bellies to hold us! It doesn't need straining at all, just a very long time with the hand blender. Will probably make this again very soon while the English asparagus is still in season.

Delicious and simple. I didn't strain it and it was still great! I used more lemon juice because I love lemon flavor.

I liked this, though if you are expecting a pop of flavor go somewhere else- it is very subtle and delicate. Extra points for being extremely easy to make.

Sorry to dissent, but I found this fairly pedestrian. Considering the price of asparagus, I'd prefer to just go ahead and eat it roasted or steamed; with this soup the flavor of the vegetable didn't stand out all that much.

Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous. I didn't strain it, just blended, which gave it a heartier texture. The lemon creme fraiche was the perfect compliment - so delicate flavors balance perfectly. The best part was that my guests loved it!

I made this dish as part of my mother's day feast. While my mother and I loved it, reviews were less enthusiastic with the rest of the family. I stripped the woody parts of the asparagus before cooking so I did not strain it. Also I used meyer lemon juice and zest, which gave a floral zip to the dish. Lastly, I used chicken broth rather than vegetable broth (only because I forgot to buy veggie broth)

I loved it !!! It was easy, light, and wonderful. My husband, who does not care for asparagus at all, even tried some - I think it was the lemon creme fraiche that won him over. A must try!!

Thought this was very good. However, next time I would make sure to get the smaller more tender asparagus spears and not strain out the solids -I had to strain it the first time since there were some "woody" bits after the puree step.

I made this for Easter. It was easy and good, but VERY filling---small portions, especially as part of a meal, are sufficient.

Everyone in my house was hesitant to try it but once they did-they were hooked and asked for more. I didn't have coriander on hand so I tried a little dill and lime juice and it tasted fantastic.

I made this for first course for our Easter Dinner. It was the hit of the whole dinner-everyone raved! Wonderful flavors and presentation. I added some fresh chopped chives from the garden on top of the dollop of lemon flavored sour cream-beautiful spring soup-a must!

Delicious!! So easy and all my guests loved it. The lemon creme fraiche is a perfect complement. I didn't strain it (holes in my strainer are tiny!), but it was fine with more texture. i will definitely make this again!

Fabulous soup! Enjoyed by everyone in my supper club. I served it to 12 people and we each had about 2 ladles of the soup but it seemed like enough with our multi-course meal. I did double the creme fraiche portion and added in more of the grated lemon peel. Gave it a bit more zing.

The recipe says to trim the Veg. and cut 2" pices. That means to take the Veg and take off the bottom piece. It breaks right off, just use your fingers and break about 1". You use the rest of it, including the head.

I made it late last night, and brought it with me to work. My co-workers are loving it. It is a great soup, Very easy to make, simple ingredients, and very healthy. The Lemon Creme Fraiche balances out the sweet sliky consistency, I highly recommend you try making this.

Like the other reviewers, I loved this. It was so easy. I made it in the morning, and refrigerated until dinner, reheated it gently and it was wonderful, making for an easy 1st course at a dinner party. I used chicken broth because that's what I had. The lemon creme fraiche is the absolutely perfect touch.

An easy, healthy and delicious soup...the very taste of spring. I made it with store-bought asparagus; now can't wait until I can make it again using the wild asparagus that grows around here.

Excellent and easy! Loved this soup - and my guests were raving about it! It was so simple, and I loved the addition of the broiled asparagus tips - it was perfect. Yummy!

Oregon, I think they mean that they reserved the tips from the puree, so that the beautiful, (and most delicious!) tips would show in/on the soup. It sounds lovely - I will try it that way.

Where does it say to get rid of the tips?? it says trimmed asparagus, doesnt that mean trim off the tough bottoms?? the tips are the best part.

Also saved the asparagus tips (2nd time I made it). Only used half the butter, substituted it with olive oil. Done twice, the first time I added croutons. Liked the aspar. tips better. Very easy.

A very good soup that I'll certainly make again. I prefer a "rustic" look, so I reserved the asparagus tops, broiled them til they were bright green, and served them in the pureed soup.
