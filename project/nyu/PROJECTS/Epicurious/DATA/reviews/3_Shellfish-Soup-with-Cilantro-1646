I liked the recipe but it requires adding garlic and little of hot pepper. The recipe is light and different. My wife loved when I added the adobo and hot pepper. We will prepare this recipe again.

When they said,"Light," they weren't kidding. This was blander than chalk. I added chipotles in adobo and lots of fresh lime juice at the last minute, which saved the dish. Otherwise, it was really just awful.
