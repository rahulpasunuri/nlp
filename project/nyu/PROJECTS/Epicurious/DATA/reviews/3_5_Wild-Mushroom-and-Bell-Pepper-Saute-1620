Delish! Instead of sauteeing in butter, I broiled mushrooms and peppers in 2 TB olive oil..8 minute s on one side, 6 on the other.

This dish is simple to prepare and such a beautiful, delicious combination. I love it! I bought crumbled gorgonzola instead of goat cheese, and it was fabulous. Highly recommend.

It sounds so simple. Why didn't I think of it myself? Ah well, I didn't but since finding this recipe, it has made its way into the weekly rotation. I didn't have any trouble using the recommended amount of butter, and I didn't have any trouble halving it either. I've made it with portabellas, buttons, and creminis and they were all yummy. Very pretty dish too.

Delicious! I substituted mushrooms and used baby Portabello mushrooms. Very fragrant and most pleasing combination of flavors. Was even tops for my picky mother.

Didn't care for this dish at all.

Delicious. This lends itself to beautiful presentation. I also reduced the butter to about 3 tbsp. It would probably work well with 2 without sacrificing flavor. I will definitely add this to the rotation. I used portabellas.

The vegetables not only taste great, but the colors are wonderful. As suggested by other reviewers, I sauteed the mushrooms 1st to reduce the liquid. Very good.

Definitely too much butter. Peppers don't absorb butter, so you are left with an un-appetizing pool of butter in the pan. Mushroom connoisseurs loved it. I would make it again for the variety in my diet, and for the colors.

Loved it! Used some white wine too for added flavor and used baby portobellos. Served with ahi tuna in a ginger soy marinade- and cous cous. Yum.

I think this dish has great potential, with a few minor adjustments. As with everyone else, cut the butter WAY down. I thought I had cut it enough but was sorely mistaken. I had a pool of butter in the bottom of the dish! I added white wine which gave the dish a nice added flavor. I think I'll take the suggestion of cooking the mushrooms first, they have so much water in them which attributed to my pool(I used Porchini and Button. Otherwise it was a hit with hardly any leftover.

Served with Hazlenut Encrusted Rack of Lamb for Easter Dinner. Added 1/4 cup white wine toward end of saute. Next time would try cuttting butter in half and add Olive oil to replace. This side dish rivaled the Lamb in reviews from the guests. Even the "Mushroom Haters" loved it!!

Great side. We sauted the mushrooms first for about 3 minutes then added the peppers. Loved it. Used maybey half the butter in the recipe then added a tblspn of olive oil.

I served this with Easter dinner to a chorus of "Wow! this is good!". I reduced the butter to 1 tablespoon and added 1 tablespoon olive oil. I did not use the cheese.

I radically reduced the amount of butter using about 1 Tbsp and added 2 Tbsps. of olive oil. I turned the heat up to medium high when I added the mushrooms to cook them faster and thus keep them firmer. The combination of flavors is terrific, and it is also good without the cheese.
