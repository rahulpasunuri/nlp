This recipe was really good, but the next time I think I will add another can of clams and use less bacon. I think the bacon overpowered all the other flavors in this dish. Will definitely make again with changes listed above.

Am wondering if other reviewers did not have good clams (tinned) to use. I have been making this since it was first published, mostly following the recipe; and it has always been a big hit. Am taking to a BBQ today.

This was a surpringly very good recipe. We were a little leary of the "clam dip" but it was so much more with all the great ingredients. It certainly doesn't look like the picture. The dip itself shows the chopped red pepper, bacon, onions, etc. I used light sour cream and reduced fat cream cheese.

I added extra clams as suggested, and crushed red pepper for zing, but all of the different ingredients resulted in a bizarre-tasting concoction lacking any distinct or pleasant flavor.

I made this for Superbowl Sunday. We all enjoyed it along with the pita toasts. I used flour tortillas and not pita bread but followed the recipes as stated. Fun and flavorful!

One of the most asked for recipes in our repertoire! We increase the amount of tobasco and worcesterchire as well as add chopped cilantro. Much better when made a day or two ahead.

I used crab. I had to spice it up a bit, but overall, it was good.

Everybody I serve this to loves it. In fact it is one of the most asked for appetizer recipes I have

Rather disappointing. I used additional horseradish and Worcestershire in an attempt to give this some flavor but it could not be saved. Neither clam flavour or bacon flavour was very apparent. My quest for a unique dip with wide appeal continues. p.s. Pita crisps were wonderful... I could eat those any day!!

Have made this for years. Lost the recipe, thank goodness for Epicurious. Love it. If you are looking for a clam dip with strong clam flavor this is not the dip. Love the combination of clam, bacon, basil. This is a keeper! I always make this every summer for our annual barbeque and everyone loves it. It is a different dip, not a spinach dip, not a onion dip and certainly not ranch. I also use Hormel bacon pieces to cut down on the prep time.Who likes to fry up bacon? Do not use bacon bits, make sure that you use real bacon pieces.

The recipe is fine except basil does not go well with this recipe if you omit basil the recipe is fine. To many flavors cover up the mild flavor of the clams.

A friend gave me this recipe in 1997. Now I know where she got it. The only change I made was to subsitute 3/4 of a jar of Hormel Real Bacon Bits for the 1/4 pound of bacon. Beside being easier, the change improves the flavor and texture. I agree that the clam flavor is mild but so what. This dip is fabulous and loved by everyone

I think this dip is about 2.5 forks. I tend to think of appetizers as fancy or casual - and this one is casual. I have to agree with the reviewer that said it didn't really taste like anything. It's good, but no discernable flavor comes through.

I have made this recipe at LEAST 10 times. I bring it to parties and serve it at my parties. Everyone, and I mean everyone LOVES it! And they all ask for the recipe. I do add lots of tabasco but otherwise I stick to the recipe including the chips. So what if you don't taste the clams... the dip is GREAT!

This had FAR too many ingredients for my taste buds! It tasted like I had emptied the fridg--which is close! This was one time things just didn't work out. It had allot of texture--but no taste of ANYTHING. Out of my file!

I have made this recipe about 10 times since September 2000. Men love it. I serve it with "Cape Cod" potato chips. I have never made the Pita toasts. For those who claim there is no Clam taste I say "so what!" this taste good anyway.

Have to agree with the comments regarding the fact that you can't taste the clams. I have tried doubling the amount of clam juice and adding an extra can of clams, to no avail. BUT, the recipe is easy and everyone, including myself, loves it.

After reading the reviews I made this with trepidation; however, it was marvelous and very popular. The basil adds good fresh flavor, and the clams held their own. Will repeat many times!

Absolutely wonderful! We ommited the clams as my husband is allergic, but the dip was a great success. The pita toasts take a while to make but are well worth the effort. This will be a part of our pary fare for years to come.

What happened to the clams?? I even added more clam juice than the recipe called for but the clam flavor was still lost. I have other dips with vegetables I can make less expensive than this dish. The pita toasts were a needless addition to my time. I'll spend hours on an appetizer if the end result is delicious, this was disappointing. My Christmas Eve guests loved it but didn't know it was clam dip. I won't make it again. SHOW ME THE CLAMS!!

After 48 hours this dip still does not have a clam flavor and I made it with no variations from the recipe. Tastes mostly of red pepper and basil. People did say they liked the vegetable dip but that was not what I was after! Maybe doubling the clams and bacon would do the trick. I MIGHT make it again but it is not an immediate keeper.

This recipe makes alot. The second time I made it I cut the recipe in half except for the bacon and clams. It was much better.

Very good and disappeared immediately. Very easy and I will make again.
