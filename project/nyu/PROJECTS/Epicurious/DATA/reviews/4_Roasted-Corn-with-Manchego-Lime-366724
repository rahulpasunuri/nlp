Excellent, we have tried it both on and off the cob. The fromagerie at Whole Foods knew exactly why I was buying Manchego, wonder if he has tried this recipe?!

Amazing..didn't have manchego at my grocery store so I used parm. Can't wait to try this with roasted corn on the grill and manchego! So refreshing, healthy and delish!

Oh, Yum! It was perfect, just as written, but it would also lend itself to some adaptation. Will definitely make again.

I really like this. I use frozen corn. Trader Joe's has some fire roasted frozen corn which is good. Also, I add a couple of cups of white rice and mix it in with the corn and it's a vegetarian main dish.

I've used fresh corn and frozen corn, and I've grilled the fresh corn and boiled it. The smoky flavor from grilling definitely adds to the recipe, but it's delicious either way. For those who don't like spicy foods, I withheld some jalepeno, though I think it's best exactly as written.

This is an excellent way to use fresh summer corn. I was using my IPod while making this recipe the second time and misread the cooking time of 3-5 minutes to be 35 minutes. It got a lovely caramelized flavor from the extra cooking on the stove top. I liked it better than the time that I cooked it for the proper time of 3-5 minutes. My only advice, if you try and cook it for the longer time is that you do lose some of the volume thus you get less servings so plan for that. Excellent flavor both ways. I have shared this recipe, at their request, with quite a few appreciative friends.

This is so good that I find myself craving it every week! It's difficult not to devour the lot as soon as it's done. A really simple but brilliant recipe that just tastes like summer.

Huge hit at recent dinner party, company asked for the recipe. I roasted the ears of corn on my barbecue grill on high, then proceeded with the rest of the recipe. Really, really good; will be a staple at my house.

OK fresh corn might be better but what do we do when the season is over. I have made this three times and have added a little more cheese and a couple of additional herbs. This is probably the best vegy dish yet. All my dinner parties wanted the receipe so they could make it. The machego cheese makes a big difference even though it is expensive. I am going to venture tomorrow using frozen and will see what happens

One of the best veggie dishes I've ever made. Love it just the way it is written. Finely grated cheese w/ microplane.

Wow! This was Delicious! Made half without the cheese for the kids, ate the other half all to myself. Will be making this again and again.Mmmmmm!

I ended up using cotija cheese - it was wonderful! Will have to remember to salt after adding the cheese next time - it could have been a inedible.

Don't bother roasting the corn; save a step the next time you boil fresn corn in a pot of water. Throw in some extra ears and store in a plastic food bag. They keep well in the refrigerator when they are still on the cobs.

I first made this for a Labor Day BBQ and got such rave reviews that I wasn't allowed to take the leftovers home with me. I subbed the manchego cheese for a locally made cheese from the farmer's market and the chives for garlic chives. Aside from that, I kept it as is. I made this a second time for a baby shower and also used garlic chives but then used cotija cheese instead. Again, I was told that I could take home no leftovers. The next time I make this I want to try rendering some house-smoked chorizo from a local store and cut out the olive oil (or at least part of it) to add a smokier flavor and the extra saltiness of the chorizo mixed in at the end. This recipe is a true winner and the perfect thing to make with fresh corn from the farmers marker while it's still available!

I made this the other night for guests. It's delicious. My girlfriends ripped the recipe out of the Bon Appetit magazine sitting on the counter.

Made once with fresh corn and once with frozen - couldn't tell the difference. Delicious - won lots of raves from my guests!

Ohio corn is delicious and difficult to improve upon, but that said, this is a delicious recipe made exactly as written. There is no way frozen corn can have the same crispness and fresh taste as off the cob. The Manchego cheese is also worth purchasing, as it also has a totally different texture and taste from parmesan. Was fun to make, as it is different.

Awesome way to make a side corn dish. Stick to the recipe and you will enjoy it, we loved it.

I made this last night for a dinner party; followed the recipe exactly. This is a fabulous recipe, and drew lots of praise from our guests. I will definitely make this again!

I made this twice in two weeks - it was the hit of our book club's annual summer BBQ. I cut kernels off of steamed corn but didn't saute them, used the Manchego and cilantro, and added diced avocado, red pepper and fresh heirloom tomatoes. Delicious!

This was a hit! Had to substitute parmesan for the manchego but it was delicious! Very easy and I can see where you could substitute frozen corn kernels without a problem. Perfect side dish for some grilled meat during the summer.

Fantastic summer side dish. The flavors of lime, jalepeno and the corn itself is unbelievable! Easy to make and definitely easy to eat. :D

This is the most unbelievable side dish. Make it you will not be sorry!!

Outstanding recipe. I've made this twice now. The second time I didn't bother with roasting in the oven first; I just cooked the fresh corn in the pan with butter. (Maybe needed some oil too, but worked fine.)

UNBELIEVABLE!!! Soooo, yummy! I made exactly as directed- I could see how subbing frozen corn or parm cheese, etc. would still be good, but if you have the time, make as directed, the payoff is incredible! So good you'll want to bathe in it! I made this as a side for the dinner I cooked for my fiance's birthday- he LOVED it!!! The other side I made with it was green beans sauted with pepitas, garlic, rosemary- great compliment and then for the main course, Bobby Flay's citrus-y pork tenderloin with mojo. Yum, yum, YUM!!!

Yummy! I sub parm for manchego cheese, and used cilantro instead of chives, added green onions and cut out most of the butter and it was delicious

Really outstanding. I love corn just off the cob but this dish is most definitely worth the extra work. Next time I won't bother with the oven roasting part. The Manchego was so delicious on top.

I used two 10oz bags of frozen organic sweet corn, microwaved in their bags for four minutes each. Spread warm corn on baking sheet and tossed with butter and oil. Roasted, stirring occasionally, until brown and chewy. Transferred to a bowl and followed directions to season from there. Very good.

Previously reviewed this on Bon Appetite after finding it in print and making it. I LOVE it! That being said, I have made it several times now but I do not like it as leftovers - reheated or cold. It takes on a perfumey taste that I don't care for. Make it. Then, gobble it up!

I absolutely loved this salad! I didn't include the jalepeno but it was still incredible. I also bought pre-shucked corn and just cooked it in the oven inside aluminum foil. It is also great a few days later, but I recommend warming it in the microwave.

This is really lovely! I roasted the corn in the oven as directed. So there wasn't a real roasty char flavor but it is so delicious. As others state. sweet, salty, spicy, crispy. Love the manchego and would not sub that! Served at room temperature, I did not mix in the cheese but sprinkled on individually because I didn't know how it would hold up as left overs. Maybe the cheese would get mushy the next day? I think people will be happily surprised by this side dish.

Best new recipe I have made in a while. I made on the grill over indirect heat, otherwise exactly as written. If making for company I would repeat as is. For casual family dinner I may get the char onto the corn using the grill to skip the sautee step. It is rather decadent with oil, butter and cheese, so maybe I would cut back on butter as well. I recommend sticking with the Manchego. Much would be lost using parmesan as suggested by another reviewer.

i grilled the corn, cut if off the cob, and added the manchego, red pepper, and lime, and a little butter. i skipped the jalepeno and chives as well as the saute step. i didn't feel it was necessary. was still delicious!

This was absolutely fabulous.I made the mistake of sauteing with butter first, but it still turned out incredible. A keeper and am making it again tonight.

This recipe is amazing. It has a nice kick to it from the jalapeño and red pepper that's not too overpowering. It was absolutely delicious!

Best corn recipe I've made in a while. Very delicious. Can sub parm for manchego.

Truly a simple recipe to make. Put the cheese on after it has cooled or it will melt. For a more 'roasted' flavor the corn could be made on the grill, but it was very good as is.

This was excellent! My only complaint was the roasting step did not yield roasty flavor like I had hoped it would. But still, it was easy to make and delicious! I accidentally stirred the cheese in to the corn and it bunched together (I think I had also grated the cheese too finely), so we had to break up the bunches into bites. When I make it again, I'll definitely sprinkle the cheese on at the end. I love that you can roast the corn ahead of time and then finish making the dish when you are ready. I'll definitely be making it again!!

I followed this to the letter and it was awesome!

This is even better than I thought it would be. The sweetness of the corn, the citrus of the lime and the saltiness of the manchego just work so well together. Super easy to make! And it should be a summer staple.
