I made this to go with the soup and it was very good. It is a heavy bread but very flavorful. I made half the recipe and it filled a 9x5x3 loaf pan. I thought I was making a mini loaf and the dough would not have fit in a small loaf pan. Watch the baking time. Mine was done in about 45 minutes.

I just had to try this bread after the play dough comment. The bread looked lovely and actually tasted very good but the texture was a bit odd. I have actually tasted cheddar cheese muffins with a very similar texture but very flavourful so maybe its the amount of cheese that makes the bread slightly rubbery. I would actually give this bread 4 forks if I could make the texture a bit lighter and more bread like so if anyone has any suggestions please feel free to voice them. Thanks.

The only way this could taste like play-doh is if you a) forget to put in the onions; b) forget to put in the cheese (or you use American cheese instead of cheddar or something); c) you have access to some mighty tasty gourmet play-doh. This bread was wonderful, tasty, everything I had hoped, and I made it exactly as the recipe said to, no changes. Yum.

I feel like I have to defend this recipe, especially in view of the other review, because it is one of my favorite recipes and people have raved about it. All I can suggest is using decent, favorful sharp cheese as I have never had a problem with tastelessness. This looks great and tastes great. Different - can maka a soup a meal!

I believe that this bread came out as the recipe called for, but I really thought the flavor was poor. My daughter, our cheese lover, described it best when she said, "It looks great but it tastes like play dough!"
