I love this dish; it's the French Canadian answer to Gulab Jamun! I'm actually serving this with an Indian meal tonight.

It was a bit doughy - but the taste and texture were fine. I like the idea and will try some variations of it.

My wife is from the Quebec countryside where this dish is a traditional favorite. Definitely not "haute cuisine" but good french-canadian country comfort food.

Interesting, but definitely too sweet for my taste.

I loved the idea of this recipe because it combines two of my favorite comfort foods. However, I found the dumplings very heavy. Next time I make this I'm going to replace 1/4 of the buttermilk with an egg to lighten the dumpling batter. Also will serve with a pitcher of cold heavy cream on the side. The combination of the warm maple syrup with the cold heavy cream is undescribibly delicious

One of my favorite desserts, I ask my mom to make it whenever I go home. Try it with evaporated milk, delicious!

This recipe is the N. Maine version of beignets. Instead of frying the dough it is boiled in maple syrup. Great with ice cream but eat them while they are warm.

This is a great way to use the dark amber Maple Syrup. Not overly rich, but very sweet. Went well with vanilla ice cream and serving it warm is a must!

Great recipe, you just have to remember to serve warm because once it starts to cool it gets kind of heavy.
