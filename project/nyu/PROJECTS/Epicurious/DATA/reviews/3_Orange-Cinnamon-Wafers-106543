These are quite tasty, but rather plain to look at. Thinking they needed something extra, I dipped them in tempered chocolate flavored with orange extract, then liberally dusted them with freshly ground cinnamon once the chocolate had set half-way (sprinkle it too soon and it just becomes oily and dark). The result was decadent and rich with great texture, yet still petite and elegant, and very easy. Be sure to brown the edges of the cookies first if you try this, to obtain a wafer that will remain crisp inside the chocolate. I found that a fairly soft dough near room temperature was much easier to pipe.

Yum. The small cookies pack intense flavor, and the recipe is easy.
