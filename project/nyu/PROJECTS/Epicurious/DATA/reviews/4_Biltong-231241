This is almost exactly as my relatives and their ancestors from south africa and now in the states have made their biltong for over 100 years.Everyone always looks forward to the tasty treat as it typically still possesses the flavor of the flesh and not the candied up finish we have come to expect from our jerky industry.My relatives however typically dry a 12"x1" slab if you will as opposed to the strips you describe.You then carve a slice as you wish to enjoy it.They also implement the use of a fan and hang it in the attic rafters,utilizing a vinegar and water solution to insure spoiling does not take place,,,Absolutely great for people who enjoy the out doors and look for a protein laiden boost .
