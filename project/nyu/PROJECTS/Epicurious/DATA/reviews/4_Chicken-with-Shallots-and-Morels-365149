I just found several morels in my yard so I am going to make this tonight! Lucky me!

I couldn't find morels, so I just got a pound of plain ole' mushrooms--cooked them longer. I sliced my shallots in the Cuisinart. I've never had shallots before. I wanted to know what they tasted like. Then at the end I added a little cornstarch, because I like my gravy thick. Both I and my daughter enjoyed this meal very much. Looking forward to left-overs tomorrow!

Maybe 3.5 forks. Could not find either fresh or dried morels, so I made this with a mixture of oyster, shitake and baby bella mushrooms. Also, I only had rendered goose fat, but this gave a wonderful flavour to the dish, and the results were very, very good. I used an organic chicken and home made chicken broth. I can't wait to make this with morels.

I did a modified version of this recipe, using thinly sliced chicken breast fillets which I browned in the pan and then kept warm while I made the sauce. No way I could afford a full pound of morels ($30) but I made 4 oz stretch by cutting the morels into quarters. Used 3 scallions rather than the shallots. Sauteed mushrooms and scallions until wilted, removed from pan and simmered down the wine and broth, scraping up the fond, prior to adding the cream. Tasty!
