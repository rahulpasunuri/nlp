These are fantastic and so easy! Used panko bread crumbs and they were super crunchy and delicious. A great side dish for beef, chicken or shrimp.

What's with the oven?

This recipe is a very good use of left over risotto. I used panko bread crumbs and loved the crisp texture. I did not have any problems handling them, but you have to be very gentle.

I would totally never have thought to do this, so am very appreciative that I happened on this recipe. So easy. I used panko crumbs instead of regular crumbs and loved the extra crunch.

Great recipe. However I made 2 changes. First was to make more cakes that were smaller. Second was I used the Epicurious recipe for WILD MUSHROOM RISOTTO insead. Great with the ARUGULA, WATERCRESS, AND GOAT CHEESE SALAD WITH RASPBERRY VINAIGRETTE.

This is a great mushroom risotto recipe. The cakes are a good way to use leftover risotto, but delicious enough for company. This skillet method is good, but if I'm making this for my large family or company, I often just form the cakes, lightly dredge in crumbs, and bake in a 350 degree oven on nonstick foil until browned.
