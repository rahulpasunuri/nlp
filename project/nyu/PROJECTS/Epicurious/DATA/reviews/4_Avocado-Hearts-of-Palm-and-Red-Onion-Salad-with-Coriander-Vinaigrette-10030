This was a great salad, used one heaping teaspoon of ground coriander instead of fresh, reduced avocado to 3 and 1 large head of boston lettuce. Served 6 with plenty leftover. I made the vinaigrette in jar, was fine and didn't have to drag out/clean blender. Was a nice, interesting change-up on the salad!

I absolutely loved this salad, but next time I think I'll add more hearts of palm and lessen the avocado to make the textures a little more even. That cilantro vinaigrette was lip-smacking great!

This was absolutely excellent. I made it as written without changes. A great mix of flavors and beyond my expectations. I will be making it again many times.

I will definitely make this again. The salad dressing is absolutely gorgeous and it really complements the texture and flavours of the salad ingredients. I have always found hearts of palm a bit mysterious and wondered what you could do with them but I will be adding them to my shopping list regularly now.

This had all the 'stuff' that I like but it didn't come together as much as the reviews raved. For the vinaigrette it says 1/4 cup coriander, is that chopped, minced, packed? If it is only 1/4 cup it is not enough flavor for the dressing. If it is minced it is too much and makes the dressing clumpy and difficult to distribute. I also think it needs less lettuce and more hearts of palm.

This salad is unbelievable. Excellent flavor, it looks nice, it smells good, its an all-around winner. Can't wait to have it again. Might try adding a handful of halved cherry tomatoes next time, but not because the salad is lacking, just because I add tomatoes to everything. DELICIOUS!

Délicieux! I made this to accompany Rebecca's jerk chicken, rice and black bean entrée. It was a hit. I used basil in lieu of coriander and iceberg replaced the boston lettuce which made a nice crisp contrast to the avocado and heart of palms. I served it on a platter. Looked smashing. The hearts of palm went over well as not too many people are familiar with this particular vegetable. A definite keeper.

Great recipe for BBQs. I add mandarin oranges.

This was really fabulous. The only change from the recipe I made was to use basil instead of cilantro (accidentally grabbed flat leaf parsley instead of cilantro at the store) and a walla walla sweet onion intead of red onion. I considered adding a colorful vegetable but in the end really liked the green presentation. This accompanied a jerk chicken meal and was very well received by our guests.

I have been looking for recipes that will help introduce my 3 tear old granddaughter to the delights of the Caribbean which is part of her birth heritage. She gobbled it up :) Her step grandfather who despises cilantro ate the salad (and dressing) with not a peep what with him being so busy having seconds;). Luverly and refreshing. I used more garlic ( a large clove); added 1/8 cup orange juice and a splash o sherry vinegar to the lemon juice. This changed the proportion needed for the olive oil of course but I just eyeballed it keeping the 2:1 ratio in mind. Like, a cook from brooklyn, I found pureeing the cilantro w/o liquid difficult thus was born the idea of adding OJ. Much simpler to emulsify. I'd venture to say that either a food processor, blender or handstick (as I used) will give much the same results. For colour and since it was languishing in the fridge, I added some pequillo peppers cut in strips. I imagine roasted peppers would work well too. A definite keeper.

Amazing. It's perfect for a party and gorgeus to boot.

A fantastic salad. I added mandarin orange slices to add some color. I also recommend adding the avocado last, so that the cubes don't get mushy when mixed around with all the other ingredients.

This salad is so simple to make, yet so elegant to serve. The first time I made it, I served it alongside individual Beef Wellingtons on Christmas. It was fabulous! Now my family wants it whenever we throw steaks on the grill. Our new favorite.

I didn't have fresh coriander and substituted fresh cilantro which everyone enjoyed. It's not clear from the recipe how large the avocados need to be. I recommend two large avocados (base area the size of a tennis ball) or four regular size.

This is one of my favorite salads. Especially good and pretty if you add fresh pink grapefruit.

This salad was great and easy. I added a clove of garlic to the dressing and a dash of red pepper to the avocado. Next time I will use more hearts of palm and slightly less avocado. I will also finely chop the red onion so that it is less overwhelming per bite.

Wow, after all the great reviews I expected something spectacular, but I was underwhelmed. It was OK, easy to make, but not anything I'd make again. How combining yummy things like hearts of palm and avocado resulted in something this ho-hum is a mystery to me. But considering the rave reviews it has and how easy it is to make, I'd say it's definitely worth trying!

This salad presented beautifully and complemented the shrimp with mango sauce recipe on this site. I had trouble making the dressing in my blender (the small amount of liquid at the outset made the blades spin futilely) so i had to add the oil quickly. next time, i'll make it in my food processor. i also added some extra coarse salt and pepper at serving.

I brought this salad to a potluck dinner last night that featured Ahi as the main course. Everyone raved about the salad and asked for the recipe. Since I had a very busy day I prepped the salad 9 hours in advance. I sliced the onion and hearts of palm and avacado, sprinkling it with fresh lemon juice to keep the avacado from turning brown. At the last minute I tossed the mixutre with the butter lettuce and dressing. I loved the combination of the soft lettuce and the and avacado with the onion and hearts of palm adding a bit more texture. The dressing was a lovely fresh flavor which complimented the softness of the salad quite nicely. I will definitely be adding this to my recipe box.

Outstanding, light and crunchy, soft, & satisfying all at the same time. I made the salad for two people and used 1 large clove garlic, 1/4 cup cilantro (coriander) 1 1/2 Tbl. lemon juice, 1/4 tsp. sugar, 1/8 tsp. salt & 1/4 cup olive oil. At first It didn't look like enough, but it is exactly the amount to use if you halve everything. For the salad I went to the local supermarket deli and bought some fresh heart of palm (about 7 ounces) which I sliced into 1/4" rounds, used 1 small avocado & diced it and about 4 shaved slices off a very large red onion which I cut into quarters. I used an incredibly fresh head of Butter lettuce but only broke about half the leaves into smaller pieces. I dressed the leaves seperately and dressed the avocado mix and voila! What a delightful salad! Went very well with the "Smoked Turkey Wraps with Mango and Curried Mayonaise" on this site. Boyfriend LOVED it even though he is usually picky but the salad is clean and interesting. I'll make this again.

This was an awesome recipe! I agree that the dressing really adds to the dish. The only changes I made were to reduce the oil by half, used only one avocado, and added diced mango and medium shrimp. Yummy!

This is a wonderful and simple salad recipe. It is great when you are looking for something a little different. I usually make the vinaigrette according to the recipe and then add a little more salt and lemon to taste. I have also used mixed greens instead of boston lettuce and the salad was still great.

This turned out to be a GREAT potluck recipe! I did add a little extra garlic and used some macadamia nut oil instead of the olive oil. WOW! it was very good! I also chopped up the boston lettuce into bite size pieces and mixed it all together for service. I can only say WOW so many times. . .

Way too much going on in this salad. The dressing is odd. This would be better minus the sugar and garlic. Will not make again. It's ok, easy to make but not good enough to keep.

At the last minute, my avacados were not ripe enough, so I substitued fresh mango instead (I had one in the fridge)---it was delicious. I will continue to make it with mango!

I took this to a caribbean dinner party last night, and it was a huge hit. I also used mixed greens instead of boston lettuce, a bit more garlic, and lots of cilantro. Even a guest who never eats salad cleaned his entire salad plate! Wonderful combinations! This will definately be a regular salad for us.

I have made this recipe many times, beginning with my gourmet supper club, and it is always a hit. Several people have told me that it is the best salad they have ever eaten. I add cucumber - peeled, sliced, and cut in semi-circles. I also serve on mixed baby greens rather than on boston lettuce. This is a great salad to serve with Carribbean food or with Mexican food.

this was a lovely recipe, if rich. i used only two avocados in order to make the avocado to hearts of palm ratio more equal. to use either canola oil or dry coriander strikes me an abomination.... if was lovely alongside grilled vegetables and corn.

YES, I too added some powdered coriander for extra kick (good idea!) Avacados and hearts of palm go so well together. We often make a grilled chicken and vegie salad...Hearts of palm grill beautifully and the smokey taste adds a whole new dimension of flavor.

This recipe was great, but PLEASE don't replace the cilantro with dried coriander... it just doesn't compare to the real thing. That's like substituting garlic powder for fresh garlic!

This dish is rich and wonderful! The blend of flavors is remarkable and it is so easy to make. I used coriander spice (a little less than a 1/2 cup)and canola oil instead of fresh coriander and olive oil. Delicious! It is very important to process the vinaigrette and add oil slowly to ensure proper mixing. A favorite!

This recipe may have come from the West Indies, but I have served it over and over with Mexican food. The avocado and cilantro complement south of the border flavors and it lightens up a meal of tamales or enchiladas.
