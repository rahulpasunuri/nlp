I made these for my sister's birthday last year. The dipping sauce stole the show, but the asparagus was sub-par. The batter could use more flavor, the lemon just isn't enough. I use the sauce for fish. If I'd make it again I'd add some kick to the batter, maybe some Creole or Cajun seasoning.

Really enjoyed this! Also used it for dandelion flowers and made some golden couscous to have with....mmmm....

The batter is perfect- used it on asparagus and zucchini. Would definitely use again. The dip was good-added more lemon zest and juice. I used canola for frying. Next time I will try fish and seafood.

So good! Especially with the dip! A real hit and a great spin off of fried zucchini!

This was excellent! I added some rounds of eggplant to the batter. They turned out really well. I served it all with mussels for dinner. GREAT!

I do not recommend frying the asparagus in the oven at all! There is no advantage in doing this over the stove top method - you will end up spending most of the time with the oven door open.

What a treat for Saturday night dinner! I used a cream ale as this was the only beer in the house. For those who wonder: the trick for frying is to wait until the oil is very hot. Sprinkle a few drops of batter in the oil and wait until these are producing mini bubbles before putting in the asparagus. Make sure the oil stays hot and supervise at all time.

Man, this was good! It was passed by servers as the one fried thing on a 7 item cocktail party menu. My guests loved it, and joked about feeling virtuous since they were eating their vegetables. I even served it with the mayonnaise. The only tweaking I did was to use sugar snaps and halved baby carrots as well. Anything that you would cook as tempura would work with this. I plan to try this with fresh white fish. And by the way, active people who eat real food (mostly plants!), shouldn't fear the occasional fried morsel.

This dish was amazing, instead of lager I used a stout, which was all i had, and used paprika, it was a little heavy and spicy but that is what I was aiming for, but I did not have the mayo, that would have been over kill.

Oh ya, these were good! Did not feel healthy while eating them, but loved having a new way to eat asparagus!The mayo dip makes them very rich and heavy, but thats good in my book!

This dish was a hit! The batter was more like a tempura. I used Creemore Lager - very easy and very fast. I also found white asparagus - made it visually a nice light dish. The lemon mayo dip was perfect too. Highly recommend!

I thought this was great. Used cake flour instead of regular in the batter to lighten it. Made sure the asparagus were dry before placing in batter. No problems. Made dipping sauce, but put in extra lemon. Also deep fried shrimp using the same batter and dipping sauce. All tasted great. Obviously more grease that if you grilled it, but hey, we're deep frying here.

This was tasty, just way too heavy. Maybe if i did it again I would try a yogurt-based dip instead.

We love asparagus and love french fries, so we thought this was perfect. However, the batter wasn't thick enough to really coat the spears, I couldn't keep the asparagus from sticking to each other, and the result was lackluster in flavor. That having been said, I have no experience with frying, so maybe I was doing something wrong?

This is a great once in awhile treat. I added way more lemon juice, zest and pepper to the dipping sauce. Everyone at the party loved it.

My husband hates mayo and is so so about asparagus but he ate this. I enjoyed the flavor but I need a tip on how to not get the oil to soak into the batter.

Excellent! Very, Very easy to make. I've made this for three dinner parties. They have always been a hit. Best of all, you don't even need to make the sauce. They are good all by themselves.

I thought this was a great recipe. I usually just use the basic 1-1-1 recipe for tempura batter, but I really enjoyed this batter as well. I made asparagus AND green beans. Both turned out beatifully

I am not much of a cooker. Maybe I didn't make the batter correctly b/c it did not really stay on the veggies. The batter did have a good flavor so I will try to make it a little thicker and use it on something else. I made the sauce but it was too heavy, it was all mayo.

Yes, these were good but not great. The batter fries up very crispy. Maybe it was my asparagus as I felt the oil overwhelmed the flavor. Would make the aoli more spicy next time

This was very tasty and simple. I did not serve it with the dipping sauce, just with some lemon-pepper grilled chicken breasts. I would skip the sauce, if for no other reason than the recipe would be too heavy.

My brother was the only person who wouldn't eat this appetizer, but everyone else said it was their favorite at the party. We fry mushrooms, tomatoes, squashes and other vegetables, why not asparagus? I thought it was a nice fried treat, especially since I love asparagus any way it is cooked. I used lowfat mayo in the dip and also added a little fresh minced garlic. No one at the party had ever had fried asparagus before, and it was a hit!

For once in a blue moon treat, this sure beats driving an hour to the yearly asparagus festival, paying to get in, waiting in line, paying for the treat, finding a pleace to sit, etc... One thing they DO do correctly at the asparagus festival is eliminate the dip and give the asparagus spears a healthy dusting of fresh parmesan. I'll do that next time and never have to travel to Stockton again!

Use the batter for any vegetable and for fish. Also, try your electric skillet for deep-fat frying. The temperature of the fat is controlled by the thermostat. This asparagus is a tasty first course

Yummy! I agree with the comments on the CA cook - don't cook it then! Obesity problems tend to stem from parents not parenting and not setting good examples. Everything in moderation I say!

To the cook from San Diego -- no one says you should eat this every day. Like many other things, I think most people know that this a treat, not a staple. Try not to ruin the cheesecake recipes too, eh?

Battering and deep frying ruined my asparagus. Never again. Will continue to steam and serve with balsamic vinegar.

I can't believe one would waste incredibly good and healthy asparagus by battering and frying it. And we wonder why we have an obseity problem?

The dipping sauce would also be wonderful with blanched, chilled asparagus. But if I ever served this to my husband and the boys on game night, they would laugh him out of town!

This was a wonderful treat. My kids loved it. We will definately fix it again. The only change I would make next time is using low fat mayo instead of regular. The dipping sauce was a little heavy for me, but it did have a great flavor.

Will be making this ,to have while watching WWE instead of chips. Just love it.

This was a departure from my usual style, i.e. much more of a snack food. Those asparagi disappeared in a flash. I used Bud and it tasted fine. Doubt this was a healthy treat but will make it again!

Made this last night to go w/steak and rice. Great! Fantastic pub food fare and the dipping sauce was perfect with it. I would recommend dropping the asparagus in one at a time and then you can avoid them sticking together.
