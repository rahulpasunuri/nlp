Gross, I boiled it for 2 hours, but it wouldn't thicken. better for syrup. I would try to find a different recipe.

This is a definite keeper! The first person I some to asked for the recipe. I does take longer to thicken, though. I boiled for over 2 hours and it came out perfectly set and delicious.

this marmalade is awesome- i've made it the last 3 years as a substitute for gravy (turkey) and it's always been a favorite. the marmalade will thicken if you leave the lid OFF the pot and let it simmer for a couple of hours (one year i accidently left the lid on and the stuff cooked far too long and came out sorta gross).

Terrible. I thought maybe I'd be successful with this recipe even though others mentioned it didn't set, but the same thing happened to me. I stashed the jars in the fridge, hoping they'd firm up, but they didn't. It ended up being so fluid that you could pour it like water. I had some on pancakes (basically using it as a syrup) but I don't eat enough pancakes that I could use up the dozen jars this recipe filled. Not sure what this recipe is lacking (more sugar? Add some pectic?) but I don't even want to play around with this recipe. Find a reliable orange marmalade recipe and throw in the pomegranate seeds.

This marmalade was easy and delicious!! I did need to cook it down a bit longer than the recipe required....a little less than 2 hours but it was worth the extra time.

Disastrous as well!! Although my marmalade did thicken very nicely, all the orange peels were burned. I cooked it on low-to-med heat the whole time, and stirred quite often. It boiled throughout, and I used a non-stick pan. Maybe I didn't disolve all the sugar initally?? I really have no idea what I could have done wrong... Not worth the trouble of seeding the pomegranate!

Disasterous. The marmalade never thickened even after cooking it for over 3 hours. The initial flavor was good but after cooking it for so long, it tasted burnt. This makes a better syrup than a marmalade. Good luck if you choose to try it.
