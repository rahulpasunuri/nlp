As part of a British, trifle loving, Sunday lunch posse, this was a must to try - it was very successfully received and named Trifle Nouveau. Made it in one big bowl with additional quantities of everything, especially the cream mixture. I admit to cheating with the sponge. I used a packet of Betty Crocker gingerbread mix and drizzled it with whiskey. Oh, OK, I soaked it in whiskey... my husband's 12 yr old single malt - got some serious stick for that! Once that's all soaked into the sponge and then everything else is added in and left overnight, no-one will know or care that the sponge is from Betty Crocker!! You just need to make sure that the cream goes right to the edge of the bowl all around, so that the blueberries don't drizzle down the side and spoil the layering effect. This is a spectacular new version of the traditional Sherry Trifle we were brought up on and is now a staple of Sunday Lunch.

Very time consuming, but fabulous! I made this for Easter 2009 for the in- laws and they loved it. Making it again for a 50th birthday party. I used the Trader Joe's organic blueberries, which are much smaller and it made a nicer presentation. If you like your lemon mousse super tart, use only 3/4 c of whipping cream.

Absolutely delicious! The lemon mousse is a fabulous complement to the gingerbread. I sprinkled the gingerbread pieces with Limoncello liqueur as I was layering the trifle. I would definately make this dessert again.

I loved how this recipe tasted! I was a little unsure as I made it but after sitting overnight the gingerbread soaked up the flavor of the lemon mousse and tasted delicious. I made one large trifle. It did not fill up my whole bowl so I would probably 1 1/2 times the recipe next time. Also, I was too lazy grate the lemon but the mousse was plenty lemon-y without it. The blueberry sauce was not as thick as I thought it would be but it tasted good.

I've made this at least three times and it's wonderful. The flavors meld together perfectly. The lemon mouse is so great you could just serve that alone. One of my guaranteed crowd pleasers.

I made this for Christmas dessert. My family didn't enjoy it at all. Although I followed the instructions exactly, the gingerbread was too heavy and dry. The mousse and blueberry sauce hadn't soaked in at all. I haven't had trifle before, but I anticipated a light and moist dessert. The lemon and blueberry might work better with a light sponge cake.

Personally, I found this recipe much too sweet for my liking, especially if you want to serve after several courses. If you have a super sweet tooth, this is the recipe for you.

Complicated and decadent. Takes some planning to make, but it is well worth it. Each part of the recipe was fairly easy and needed no adjustment at all. I did make two of the gingerbread, since I like a bit more cake in a triffle, but only used 1 and 1/2. You do need to start it 3 days ahead of when you want to serve it.

I MADE THIS TRIFLE FOR A TEA AND IT WAS WONDERFUL! EVERYONE LOVED IT. IT DID SEEM TO FALL SHORT IN THE 3 QT. BOWL THAT THE RECIPE CALLED FOR SO I ADDED AN ADDITIONAL LAYER ON TOP OF LEMON ZESTED WHIPPED CREAM WHICH I PIPED ON. DECORATED WITH BLUEBERRY/WHITE-COLORED PANSIES, IT WAS GREAT!
