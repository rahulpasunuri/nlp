This turned out bad. It was a thin, mustard with cheese and milk sauce. Three of us disliked it. Don't know what Welsh Rarebit is suppose to be like. Hopefully it's better than this.

I used homemade white bread instead of the brown bread and this turned out very nice. Resist the urge to add salt to the recipe - the cheese and ham add enough on their own.
