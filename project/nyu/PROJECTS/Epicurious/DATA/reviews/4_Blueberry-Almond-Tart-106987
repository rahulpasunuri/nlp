This crust was horrible. I have no idea how all the other reviewers didn't mention how crumbly this crust was. When I took it out of the tart pan the whole top crumbled off!!!! I will only make this recipe again using another tart crust recipe.

A very pleasing dessert. Simple in taste. Did not use the jelly on top.

I have made this tart at least 10 times and it has turned out fabulous every time. I am a die hard chocaholic but this is by far my favorite dessert. I make a recipe and a half of the cooked blueberries and add more berries on top. I like a fuller tart. Every time I make this recipe there is never a drop left. A must on any summer bakers list!!!!! I just wish blueberries were fresh all year!!!!!!!

Made this once before and found the uncooked blueberries on top fell off when cut. This time I mixed them into the cooked filling before filling tart and this worked very well. Also didn't need jelly on top. Lovely light tasting

This is a true winner. I made this for the first time last summer and got such rave reviews (and it's so easy to make) that I ended up making it for different people a few weeks in a row. It has now become one of my "go to" summer desserts. Spreading the jelly on the blueberries can be a little cumbersome, but it gets easier. I've served it with pure vanilla-bean ice cream from the farmer's market and it's a winner everytime.

This was really good! Very tasty crust. One minor change to the process: in the final step, I would mix the whole berries with the dissolved jelly in a bowl first before topping the tart. I found trying to use a pastry brush to spread the jelly on the berries too cumbersome.

I would not hesitate to prepare this again: simple, keeps well, looks elegant and tastes SUPERB. I prepared the recipe as given, only changing the sugar to Splenda. Made it for the first time for company and everyone who had it said it was the best blueberry dessert they'd had. Served it with sweetened creme fraiche. I, too, was surprised by the low rating! Don't let it fool or intimidate you!

A very easy make-ahead recipe. I did omit the lemon zest per another reviewer's comment.

This blueberry tart was delicious and easy to make. I took it to a cook out and people loved it, I had several requests for the recipe. If I were to change one thing: I would omit the lemon zest. It gave the tart a bit of a lemon bar taste (several people commented on that). In addition, my crust was a bit crumbly, but it was a very humid day, so that might have something to do with it.

I loved this dessert and all my guests have too. I have made it in a square tart pan as well as a round one.

I'm surprised at the 78% rating for this Tart. I have made this numerous times, and have not only persopnally enjoyed it immensely, but have recieved compliments from the many people I have shared it with. It's hard to go wrong with Blueberries in my book, anyways. A little extra lime juice is a definite taste enhancer.

I made this recipe exactly as described with blueberries freshly picked from a pick-your-own farm and it was outstanding. The presentation was beautiful and the taste (both the crust and berries) was top notch.

This is a wonderful recipe and I plan to make it frequently. Wonderful rich taste! I could not find a tart pan with removable sides so used my cheescake pan and it worked very well.

I can't believe anyone would be disappointed with this recipe! I've made it twice, to ooohs and ahhs both times. Everyone thought it was beautiful... but most importantly, tasted great.

My guests were disappointed in this tart. The blueberries that were seated on the top were tart. Overall this was a boring dessert. I could have dumped the blueberries in a bowl, drizzle with some melted red currant jelly and called it a day. Thumbs down!

Excellent and very easy. Great do-ahead dessert. I have made this 3 times already and plan on keeping on file. I have received lots of compliments on it, even from those that don't normally comment on what they eat.

To the cook from San Jose...You are stirring half of the hot berry mixture into the bowl that has the yolk and cornstarch. After mixing the yolk, cornstarch and berry mixture together you then stir that back into the other half of the berry mixture that is still in the saucepan.

I haven't made this yet, so this isn't a review. The instructions for making the filling seem to be missing something. What should be done with the other half of the "hot berry mixture" that doesn't get folded into the yolks? When, if ever, does it get added? Please help.

Lovely. Looked exactly like the picture, and tasted divine. Guests were awed. Perfect when you need a special dessert, but want to make your life easier. The crust was much less complicated than a traditional pastry. Will make again and again.
