Fantastic! It works great if you follow the recipe. From some of the reviews it would not be so good if you use a different fish and cook it differently - like baking instead of steaming. Are you kidding? You thought it would taste the same if you do not follow any of the directions? It is as good as I remember from my my favorite Chinese restaurant in Commonwealth Avenue Boston (Victoria). The overpriced French restaurant in Roseville CA where I now live served the worst bass ever - a chewy, tasteless monstrosity. Thanks for a fantastic addition to my repertoire.

Wonderful dish! It calls for a "deep skillet" but a skillet doesn't work. No skillet is deep enough to accomodate an inverted pie pan and a plate and still be able to cover it all so that it can steam. It should really call to use a wide stockpot. This was so delicious, the sauce really makes it worth it!!

I've made this twice now and both times it has been excellent. I rarely give 4 forks, but this dish deserves them for excellence of results, ease of preparation and healthfulness. This could not be easier or more delicious. I use my very large stock pot with steamer insert to cook the fish. I line the steamer with foil rather than using a plate. It works perfectly. This dish could be made with just about any white-fleshed fish, just adjust the cooking times for the thickness of the fish. I serve this with brown jasmine rice and a steamed vegetable. A very satisfying, healthy meal.

Yes, this was very good. It was also very easy to make. My husband would have liked more sauce (not much was produced from the cooking process). But the fish was very moist and the ginger and scallions added zing.

A delightful recipe that is refreshing and a great summer addition...I used tilapia instead and doubled the sauce to pour over jasmine rice and steamed spinach. Toasted sesame seeds were also a good addition.

This is an excellent recipe. We sometimes use snapper. I double the ginger and put 1/2 of into the stomach cavity. Instead of mixing the oil and soy sauce, I heat olive oil in a small skillet to almost smoking, and then pour it over the steamed fish, scallions and ginger. A Chinese cook taught me this method, and this dish will knock your socks off.

Very simple and easy yet full of flavor. I loved it.

Have made this several times and it has been wonder each time. My husband loves it also. I did use sesame oil instead of the canola and would recommend that everyone just make the change! I tried it with trout and that was good also.

This was wonderful AND easy. The fish was light and the ginger was perfect. It did not taste at all like a healthy dish, but it really is pretty guilt-free. I used sesame oil instead of canola, and I would definitely recommend that. I liked this so much that I will be serving it this weekend to a friend (and food-snob) who is in culinary school...

Loved it! Easy, healthy and delicious. Did have a bit of trouble getting the dishes in line but it was worth it. Will make again and again.

This was a last-minute addition to a dinner I was making when I discovered one of my guests didn't eat meat. I followed the recipe verbatim, but used jasmine rice. Very quick and simple, presented well, and tasted great.

I've also made this recipe several times and love it the only thing that I change every time hands down is sub out the canola oil for toasted sesame oil. I also preffer to use sushi grade rice to accompany this as there is usually a good amount of liquid and the sticky rice soaks it up, yummmmm.

We love this recipe. We usually use tilapia, with excellent results. It's also worth it to get jasmine rice rather than a generic white rice to go with the fish.

We used a vegetable steamer and cut all ingrediants in half for a great weekday meal for two. Four forks for an easy to prepare meal.

This is great! I made it tonight. Minimal prep, great result. The steamed ginger, green onion flavors went extremely well with the striped bass. So simple, however, worthy of company. Will definately make again and again. P.S. Cilnatro definately adds to the flavor. Do not omit!

I have made many, many, recipes from this site and have never felt compelled to respond until now. After reading all the reviews, I had such high hopes for this dish, but really thought it was awful. Granted, I used a filet and baked it in the oven in foil as some people suggested, but I don't think that made the difference. The sauce was basically all soy sauce, and it just did not taste good. One of the best sauces on this site, is the Javanese Roasted Salmon sauce - incredible!

i rarely gove 4 forks, but this was amazing. probably part of why is that i used chilean sea bass, which, while not very environmentally friendly (overfished) is like a stick of butter that swims in the ocean. i doubled the sauce and served it with the "sophisticated fried rice" aslo found on this site. i think my boyfriend would have eaten about twice as much fish if i could have afforded it!

Fabulous, easy to assemble, quick to prepare and very healthy -- what more could you want? Steaming the fish really infuses it with the flavors of the ginger and scallions, doctoring it up too much with other ingredients would overpower the fish completely. Perfect exactly as the recipe is written, and don't omit the cilantro!

This is almost identical to my own steamed fish recipe, except that instead of canola, I use oriental sesame oil, giving it more flavor depth. Works with any firm white fish.

This is fantastic! Better than any restaurant dish. No need for a steamer and with a couple of additions, it was incredibally tasty. First, add garlic to the ginger and scallions. I used a peeler to slice the ginger. Second, add a little teriyaki sauce to the soy and triple the sauce recipe. Bake in foil tents in a 400 degree oven for 20 minutes. Serve with steamed snow peas and jasmin rice. It is absolutely the best.

Excellent, mellow flavors! As another reviewer suggested, I baked the fish & sauce in an aluminum packet at 400 for approx. 20 min. The sauce is very good!

Delicious. Used a vegetable steamer with open aluminum foil on bottom of steamer., Worked well. Made extra soy & canola to have over rice.

This is a full of flavor, but light dish! Absolutely delicious. My husband and brother fish a lot, made it with fresh caugt bass. Have made it several times. YOU DO NOT NEED BAMBOO STEAMER!! I make it in a cover sautee' pan on top of stove, which gives you the juices to spoon over fish. Really delicious.

I had great success with this recipe just using the vegetable steamer insert on my large saucepan. Very easy! I drizzled with a bit of sesame oil at the end, which adds a bit to the fat content, but really added flavor. Terrific for a healthy weeknight meal.

Following the other reviewer's lead, I cooked the fish inside an aluminum foil packet, in the oven, about 20 min. at 400 degrees. I added some wine because I thought it needed an acid. Next time I would add some lemon or lime juice as well. However, it was still quite delicious as is. The fish has a moist and silky texture.

Getting past the steamer was bit of a challenge. Came up with a modification, which proved efficient and Fun. Prepared the fish as indicated, and placed each serving in an aluminum foil envelope. once two sides were sealed, I added the liquid and sealed the third side. To cook, I used the outdoor grill. The sealed envelpes puffed up, adding an element of fun reminecent of jiffy-pop pop corn.

This recipe came together well. The worst part is setting up the contraption for the steaming. The tastes blended well together and it was a quick, enjoyable meal.

A good recipe and easy to prepare. I used Halibut (I caught in Alaska)and substituted ALOHA SHOYU (a Hawaiian type soy sause)for regular soy sause. In addition I rubbed the fish with Old Bay Seasoning for additional flavor and color. Herm Graham, WA
