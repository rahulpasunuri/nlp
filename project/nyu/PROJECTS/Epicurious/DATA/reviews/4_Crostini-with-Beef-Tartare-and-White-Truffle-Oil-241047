Wonderful! I too was leery of the orange peel but they really make it. I too prefer a relatively small dice versus a ground. Maybe 1/4" pieces. What heaven!

I made it exactly as written, except that I chopped the meat and garnished each crostini with a few capers. I felt like using the truffle oil was almost gilding the lily, so the next time I do it, I'll opt out of the truffle oil. It needed a touch of salt, but it was still fabulous. I've eaten it many times (it's what I order at steak restaurants instead of a steak!), but I'd never made it myself. Oh my goodness, it was delicious yet easy to prepare.

I went out of my culinary comfort zone, and it was a success! I have never worked with anchovies or white truffle oil. I was a little nervous, and thought it would either be fantastic or a disaster. Made it for Father's Day, and my Dad LOVED it! He said it needed salt (I never add salt). I purchased one pound of beef tenderloin @ Whole Foods, and chopped it up into small pieces. Then proceeded to use my Pampered Chef Manual Food Processor to make the beef pieces even smaller. Overall, a great success. I would definitely make this again.

I made this recipe again (please see other Toronto chef posting for original posting), adding the truffle oil, and it was amazing! To be honest, I still liked it a bit better when I used my variations, but that's just the tartare flavour I'm used to.

This was the first tartare recipe I've made, but the taste is fantastic. I made a few alterations as I enjoy a stronger flavoured tartare (disclaimer: please note that I did not have white truffle oil on hand). I doubled the anchovy amount, doubled the Worcestershire sauce, and added a tsp of balsamic vinegar (or to taste). This added a bit of 'kick' to the tartare and in my opinion, elevated the taste level (without the pricier truffle oil additive, which I will try next time as I am sure it will create another layer of flavour). As well, I hand chopped the steak instead of using freshly ground tenderloin. This created a firmer texture. Great first recipe!

Good but I really think tartare is best when fresh meat is chopped not ground. Do it the way Tony Bourdain does.

Having had a tried and true Steak Tartare recipe for years, I was eager to try this one and it did not disappoint. I thought the orange zest would be strange but it was fantastic. Make this a few hours in advance so the flavors can meld. Out with my old recipe!
