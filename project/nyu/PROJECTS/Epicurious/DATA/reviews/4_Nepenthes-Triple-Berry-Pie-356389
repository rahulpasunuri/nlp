Delicious! But I made the following adjustments/changes -- 1) Used pecans instead of walnuts! 2) Used fresh picked raspberries (5 cups) and bluettes blueberries (4 cups) 3) Put 1/2 t. cinnamon powder (Penzy's Spices) in crumb topping -- thus only 1 tsp. in berries 4) Added 1 tsp.+ Grand Marnier to crumb mixture Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written. And, it was THE BEST fruit pie we've ever eaten (and we've eaten MANY!)

I made this pie and was extremely disappointed. The pie dough was not light and flaky. However, the worst part was the topping - I expect this was meant to be like a crumble but it turned out dry and tasteless. Very disappointing. :(

Very delicious and easy pie to make. I used strawberries and blueberries since that was all I had on hand. 5 cups of berries and halved the other filling ingredients. Also used a store bought frozen pie shell. Keeper recipe!

I have had this pie on several occassions and it has to be one of the best pies I have ever tasted. Cup of coffee and the views from Nepenthe, awesome.
