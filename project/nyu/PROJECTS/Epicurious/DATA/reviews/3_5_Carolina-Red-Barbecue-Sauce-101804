I was getting ready to make up a batch of this for New Years and thought I would take a look at the ratings. I think thosse that give this a low rating don't understand the reason we use a vinegar based sauce here in the Carolina's. First we don't douse the meat with sauce it is mixed in just to lightly moisten it. You use it to cut the sweeteness of the pork and pork fat. I might use a cup for a whole pork shoulder, maybe a little a more depending on how much it has dried out in the cooking. You can then offer side sauces to add to the meat if your freinds would like to add something more.

I made this for the Tangy Coleslaw recipe and halved/modified it based on reviews. That's why I didn't rate it. I used 1/2 cup vinegar; 1/4 cup ketchup; 1 tablespoon sugar; 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon red pepper. The finished dressing was not very tangy.

This is a great Carolina recipe. The first time that I made it back in 1999, I followed the recipe exactly. Now I use 1/4 cup less vinegar and a teaspoon more of the brown sugar and added a generous teaspoon of worcestershire sauce and 1/2 of a lime juiced. Yes it is a lot of vinegar but that is North Carolina barbecue sauce. I love the coleslaw recipe using Duke's mayonnaise and this sauce.

I love this - it goes so much against the stereotype what an 'American' BBQ sauce is supposed to be like. Packs a vinegary punch that is just so perfect with rich pulled pork. It is also so simple it is easy to fine-tune. For example, I'm avoiding added sugar so I use mesquite bean powder for sweetness instead of brown sugar, and tomato purée instead of ketchup.

This isn't your sticky sweet bbq, but a real vinegar base. If you haven't had NC bbq before, you may want to cut it and add some more sugar. We like it spicier, so I just add more heat and some more BS.

Let's be real people. This sauce is disgusting. I don't care what they eat in Carolina. If they drink a bucketful of vinegar laden with ketchup it's still gross. Have to slash the vinegar, increase the ketchup, increase the heat, increase the sweetness, increase the spices, and basically start from scratch. There's no way putting this on your pulled pork -- as is -- is a good idea after 8 to 12 hours of cooking . . . .

Made this with pulled pork. a refreshing change of pace. Go half on the vinegar at first. Keeps well and can be used on a lot of different things, from beans to rice.

This is a traditional Carolina red sauce. That means vinegar. It is not for everyone. If you are serious about learning bbq and its history this recipe is a must. From here you go on to try others and develop your own. It's a shame people rate this poorly without understanding what it is.

wow! waaaay too much vinegar! cut down by at least half and double the amount of catsup and brown sugar then you have a winner

This is a sauce recipe also available in the Smoke and Spice BBQ book. I elect to use cayenne pepper in place of crushed red. A little less vinegar can be appropriate. A must on Carolina Pulled Pork from the central plateau. Using this as the base, you can add mayonnaise to taste for an excellent slaw dressing.

This is a very very simple version of a NC red sauce, but honestly it's much better if you cut down on the vinegar and add lime juice and most importantly, worcestershire sauce. My family has lived in NC for several hundred years and, while I'm sure they didn't spend quite that much time perfecting their sauce, the generations above me do a pretty impressive job. They *always* do the lime and worcestershire, and always boil the sauce down first so that it turns darker and gets thicker. Then they marinade the meat in it (ribs or chicken, esp.) and brush it on three or four times during the cooking process. In the summers, sometimes we add a bit of boiled down/mashed peach compote and extra lime juice and molasses to make a fruity/tangy sauce. Chilies of various sorts can also make excellent additions, though I don't recommend jalapenos. My mom also makes a killer spicy raspberry sauce by adding boiled down fresh raspberries cooked in a little orange juice and chilies. Garlic and herbs can be great additions, or ginger and a tiny hint of soy sauce if you want to go a little Asian.

Although I added a bunch of my own ingredients to this recipe, as a "base" it is both simple and fantsic.. In reply to the reviewer "A Cook from Boston", you need to do some homework prior to reviewing a recipe... Obviously you have only tried Tomato based BBQ sauces in the past.. The east side of the Carolina's uses Vinegar based sauces. Sounds like you need to stick to the bottled stuff that you are apparently used to....

The best ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!

Great with the slaw--an instant classic! To the cook from Columbus: ketchup also contains vinegar, so it's the wrong thing to add if you're looking to reduce the vinegar taste.

This is by far my favorite Carolina style sauce. I have made it at least fifteen times over the years and it is always a big hit. This sauce is great to serve if you plan to put more than one BBQ sauce on the table. People can then use the tangy Carolina Red and sweeter sauces in combination if they so choose. Personally, I like it straight. I even use it as a mop for ribs. This is one of my all time favorite sauces!

this recipe was almost there..i was trying to recreate the spicy sauce from my fave bbq joint and it was so close. waaay too much vinegar. i added tons more ketchup and brown sugar to try to balance out the vinegary-ness and it still was too much. still, i think i'd make it again, but just be a little more careful.

I have been trying to replicate what we called Uncle Bob's Industrial Strength BBQ sauce for several years. Unfortunately, he didn't write down his recipe before he died. This is a great start for me and brings back fond memories of his pork shoulder and visits with my family in NC!

to the cook from boston, ma--why don't you read up on what carolina barbeque sauce is before you give it a bad review? ALL carolina sauces are vinegar based.

Rating: 1
Absolutely vile. This isn't sauce at all. It's vinegar with a little ketchup in it, which is what the recipe admits to being from the get go. I guess I just never imagined that anyone would think a barbeque sauce made with 90% vinegar would be tasty.

Amazing sauce. Makes the coleslaw taste terrific.

Terrific! Just what I remember from my Carolina days (and like most of us native New Englanders, I detest boiled dinner!). Added a little dollop of dijon mustard, and some more red and black pepper, but otherwise it was just perfect.

This sauce is so good. It takes so long to smoke a pork butt to falling-apart perfection that I can't believe people mask that goodness with a sweet, tomatoey sauce. This stuff hits the spot. Add your meat, your slaw and your cheap white bun, and the result is way more than the sum of its parts. We didn't use the rub or mop or slaw that accompany this sauce, but used similar recipes. Great stuff!

This is the 3rd time with this one. I have used the sauce with left over pork and let it soak for 3hr it was great

If you were to drive to North or South Carolina and sit down in a barbecue restaurant, you would most probably find a sauce very similar to this in a bottle on the table.

Great sauce all on it's own. I do make it with the tangy coleslaw.

Excellent, classic southeastern BarBQue sauce!! This stuff gets into your blood at an early age... if you can't handle the vinegar, stick to things like New England Boiled Dinner. I added a little more brown sugar to this recipe and also a small squirt of mustard which emulsified it a little and kept the pepper flakes from congregating at the bottom of the bottle. My new neighbors in southern California had never tried real barbque, and absolutely loved it. I served it with sweet, creamy coleslaw, hushpuppies, and Brunswick stew. The BEST sauce for pork.

Always a hit, increase ketchup and BS, decrease vinegar...for those in New Mexico...leftovers (if there are any) makes a great buritto with green chile and a little cojack.

I added about 1/8 cup more catsup and another TB of brown sugar. Very good with the coleslaw and pulled pork. For those that don't like vinegar, oh, well, but Carolina bbq is vinegar based and cooks from there that I know all insist that it be used. I thought it was terrific.

This is not what I consider a "sauce" at all, but simply a thin flavored vinegar. I've made it three times for the Carolina Pulled Pork Sandwitch receipe (big hit) however, not for the meat but for the coleslaw.

Totally awesome barbecue sauce. Made it for our Super Bowl Party and it was a big hit.

I made this exactly as written, and it is not to our taste at all. It is so tart and tastes way too much like straight vinegar for us. I'm trying to figure out how to fix it up to make the rest of my meat edible.
