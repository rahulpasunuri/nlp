I have made this recipe almost every Thanksgiving and Christmas since it was published, plus other dinners as well! My family loves it. It is interesting but not a dessert. A huge hit every time.

i wasnt really feeling this at all. for the time it took to boil the sweet potatoes and simmer everything, i would have just assumed make baked cinnamon apples, as thats all this recipe tasted like anyway.

I added a little water and pureed left overs with an immersion blender. Made a terrific soup.

I definitely liked the flavor of this recipe. However, I'd recommend cutting the sweet potatoes into smaller pieces before boiling. I used large sweet potatoes, and the ends ended up completely mushy and the middle was underdone. Otherwise, I loved the combination of apples, lemon, and sherry.

A nice alternative to the usual sweet potato concoctions. The tartness from the apple and lemon was welcome and as part of a Thanksgiving plate this dish helped counter the richness of other traditional items. I wanted to try making a soup out of the leftover but the family ate it up too fast.

I made this for Christmas dinner 2006 and loved it. I used deep orange yams, cut the amount of butter in half to lighten the fat and calorie load, and used Golden Delicious apples because I'm not fond of Granny Smiths. I usually find holiday sweet potato dishes to be too mushy and too sweet. This dish is light, the apples are a good flavor marriage with the yams, and the lemon flavor balanced the rest of the main meal perfectly: turkey with brown and wild rice stuffing and green beans with shallots. We enjoyed the meal so much that we are going with it again this year.

Don't usually like sweet potatoes but love this recipe, not too sweet. Even the finicky eaters in the family like it! I make it up as directed and then finish it off in the oven.

I am not a cook by any means, but I have made this recipe several times and there is never any left overs. After I have finished the recipe, I transfer it to a pyrex dish and cover with a layer of marshmallows and put in the oven to brown the marshmallows.

Loved this recipe. My sister made it for Thanksgiving and we were all asking for the recipe and even made it for Christmas! Can't get enough of it.

My family usually loves anything I make from Epicurious so we were all puzzled on why this dish just didn't work for us. I made it just like it says only I did use large granny smith apples but still there just wasn't any zing. Any suggestions? As is I won't make this again.

I made this when the recipe came out in 1990 and my family has demanded it every year since. A light, refreshing way to make sweet potatoes!

This was a hit. Not your typical cloyingly sweet sweet potato recipe. This is the first sweet potato dish I have actually liked. A big hit with my family.

Tried this version of sweet potatoes for Easter dinner. Although I had a few compliments, there were a lot of leftovers. The combination of lemon juice and Granny Smith apples was a bit too tart. Next time, I'd reduce the amount of lemon juice, and increase the amount of brown sugar and cinnamon.

I made this dish tonight to go with Roast Pork Loin with garlic and rosemary. Instead of Sherry I used Maraschino liquor. Excellent with the pork!
