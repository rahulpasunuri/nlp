Crazy good! Made just as written and came out amazing - even my dog was drooling for a helping. Big hit!

I have made this twice already and it has been a hit with everyone who had a slice. I used challah bread because it's more easily available and two cups of pecans because more nuts add a nice crunch to every piece. Will definitely keep this in my recipe box for years to come!

This was a big hit; however I did change a few things: 8 eggs instead of 5 (based on http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Bread-Pudding-with-Spiced-Rum-Sauce-105700) and I used brandy instead of bourbon. I served it with ice cream and a sauce that combined pure maple syrup and brandy.

this is an amazing idea and tastes out of this world. A real hit. Everyone loved it. I didn't have any vanilla, but threw some sultanas in instead. Beautiful. I was a bit "mean"with the quantities of fluid, and it was just about OK, but next time I will trust the recipe!

This was good, not great, but it is really easy. I bought sliced brioche from the bakery and cut that into cubes and from there it took about 3 minutes. The cooking time as written is correct and make sure to cook it uncovered. Resist the urge to stop the cooking because the top is getting golden brown, you want that. Ice cream or creme anglaise is the best topper as whipping cream is too dry.

Delicious with bourbon sauce from Bon Appétit, September 1999.

Well, I have made this recipe and variants of it. It IS a decadent, scruptuous dessert as is. So easily made. One addition that we (my wife, I and others) enjoy is a bourbon glaze poured sparingly over the top. Another variant that is just TOO much for even me is one we made with glazed doughnuts. If you try that, I suggest you cut the brown sugar in half! Enjoy, this is a very easy and delicious dessert.

I made a similar recipe for Thanksgiving but added a carmel sauce on top and served it with vanilla ice cream. It is a very rich, decadent dessert which was fabulous - and I'm not usually a bread pudding enthusiast. The only other significant difference in the recipe I used and this one is that the other called for 2 T. of poppy seeds in the bread pudding. I would recommend adding them.
