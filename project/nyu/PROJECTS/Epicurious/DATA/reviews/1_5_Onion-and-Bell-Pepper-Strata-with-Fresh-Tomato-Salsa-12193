In step 4, just wondering how you salt and pepper "to taste" when you're blending raw eggs together. Why aren't amounts given, since you give amounts for everything else? Since using too little salt results in a bland recipe, it's important to give amounts, whether it's a diet recipe or not.

Needs a little more zip. I would probably use Cheddar cheese next time, or add sausage or bacon. Tasted too much like diet food. I will try it again, but add something.
