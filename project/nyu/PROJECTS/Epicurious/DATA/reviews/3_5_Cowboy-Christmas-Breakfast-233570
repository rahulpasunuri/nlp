Not the most highbrow recipe, but a delicious, satisfying dish for brunch with friends. I used fewer eggs--more like 18-20, and it was perfect. Breakfast sausage, with its more traditional spicing, is important here.

The recipe turned out so dry. My Mom mentioned her egg casserole calls for 12 eggs and 4 cups of milk. I can hardly believe the difference in ratios between her recipe and this one. Next time around, I am going to use much more milk.

Well, I was going to make this for Christmas morning, but made it for Christmas Eve instead! As we are a family of four, I cut the recipe in half, except put a whole pound of sausage in it,and baked it in an 8x8 square pan. It was filled to nearly overflowing! Be sure to put a drip pan underneath in the oven. I used the pre-made frozen Texas garlic toast, as others suggested, and it was a great shortcut. I also added about 1/4 cup of roasted, peeled and chopped Green Chile to the egg mixture. Green Chiles and eggs are a marriage made in heaven! I had to bake the casserole an extra 10-15 minutes to set the custard, perhaps because my dish was so thick. But it came out delicious! Now, the question is - what do I make tomorrow??? LOL!

I made this for Christmas brunch using the Pepperidge Farm Texas toast per the reviews. I also tossed in some crumbled applewood smoked bacon and some pepperjack cheese in addition to the listed ingredients. I served salsa fresca on the side and everyone loved it.

Made this for a New Year's Breakfast and it was a big hit. I also used frozen Texas Toast and assembled it the night before. Easy as can be and positively delicious!

This recipe was ok- I give it 2.5 out of 4 forks because I made some pretty big modifications that I would consider necessary. As written, the recipe would have been quite bland so I increased the garlic from 1 clove to 4 cloves and added sautéed green peppers and onion to the recipe, but additional vegetable could have been added too. I also doubled the amount of cheese. I also think that the bread was a little too thick and overwhelmed the egg layer. Next time I would cut the bread to about ¾ inch. Overall, the recipe was good, but not great. That being said, the entree was easy to sever and everyone seemed to enjoy it.

I made this for Christmas breakfast and everyone loved it. It was easy to do, I used Texas Toast instead of making garlic bread and it sure made the process go very quickly. Our grown children loved it! It is definately a Texas sized breakfast!

Made this for a faculty brunch and it was devoured - several teachers asked for the recipe! I did doctor it a bit - used hot sausage and added 1 chopped red pepper, increased milk to 1 1/2 cups and used 1 1/2 cups cheese. As suggested, used frozen Texas Toast. Let it all sit overnight in the fridge which made toast much more moist. Will def make again.

This recipe is EASY and a hit - The weekend I planned to make this (girl's weekend away), the oven broke and I cooked it on the barbeque and it still worked! I didn't have a food processor for the garlic and butter - just chopped and it still had the right flavor. I'd recommend making this breakfast anytime.

Our family thought this was a wonderful brunch; hardly bland or tasteless. Perhaps others used the wrong sausage, failed to salt or pepper it as required or used insufficient garlic for the garlic butter. This served five adults and two picky eater grandchildren with two nice servings left over, all with rave reviews. It is not necessary to use a food processor for the butter, and I recommend an overflow pan in the bottom of the oven during the baking process.

I really wanted to believe this would be delicious. I didn't want to believe the one reader who said it was bland. After adding garlic and spices, et al, for pep, it was bland and disappointing.

I made this for Christmas brunch: delicious! I used Texas Toast with garlic as suggested. I also used 1 lb. hot sausage,1/2 lb. mild sausage. Don't bother trying to mix cheese into eggs; just sprinkle around casserole. I also used a lot more than 1/4 C. cheese. This is even good leftover.

I just realized that I only used 12 eggs instead of 24. I used the Pepperidge Farms Texas Toast and added mushrooms. It was very good, my whole family enjoyed it. That in itself makes me happy. I'll have to try it following the recipe. Maybe if I have more than 5 people to feed. Try it!

Unfortunately, this is the first recipe I've found on Epicurious.com that I was really disappointed with. I'm not a food snot, but have come to expect excellent, gourmet recipes from this site. This is a basic strata recipe, but it calls for 24 EGGS! The taste wasn't worth it...

I love this! I have made this many times for houseguests and it is always a hit! Great because you can make it in advance--however, I find that I need to increase the baking time by 50%...something to plan if you are getting up early to cook this before everyone else gets up!

I am a personal chef, and prepared this for a post-wedding brunch. It was the hit of the party...people came back for seconds and thirds. I did add tabasco, extra garlic and sausage, as I felt the original recipe needed a little pizzazz. A great dish for crowds that can be prepared the night before.

Way too many eggs! 12 to 18 are enough. And whisking the eggs to a froth is really important. I used hash browns in place of Texas Toast. Needs more jazz and pizzaz: creole seasoning, scallions, etc. I'll do it again, though. Super easy & the golfers I fed loved it.

I prepared this today for the first time and will definitely put the recipe in my "favorites" file. It looked and tasted delicious, and received many complements from my guests. It is a very easy, delicious and adaptable recipe. Thanks to the person who suggested using Pepperidge Farm Texas Toast -this was easy and yummy. Next time I may even try the P.F. whole wheat toast. I skipped the sausage (because I'm vegetarian) and it was still full of flavor. I may try adding chopped tomato or red pepper for additional color. I used "Convection Bake" and found it definitely cooked more quickly.

I used a frozen package of Pepp. Farm texas toast, but other than that made it just as written. it was a huge it, and was also great leftover. I assembled it the night before. quick and tasty and feeds a crowd. perfect.

I did a search for "low fat" recipes, and came up with this one. Although "low fat" was what I was looking for, I decided to make this anyway, because it sounded SO GOOD. It was quite delicious, but please be warned: it is in no way low-fat. I suppose it could be made low-fat . . . but it is most certainly not.

I was kind of underwhelmed by this recipe. It was flavorful, but dry--more like a souffle. When I need an egg casserole, there are many other options that I'll probably reach for.

Versions of this are very common in our area at potluck breakfasts. I always include at least 2 cups of chopped vegetables (peppers, broccoli, etc) on top. Just before baking, I dilute one can of a cream soup (chicken, celery) with half a can of milk and pour it over the top. That would take care of the dryness mentioned by another reviewer.

this is awesome and gets extra points for versatility and ease. first made this christmas morning and my boyfriend has been asking for it ever since! love that you can make it the night before and toss in whatever veggies you have on hand. i added green peppers and some spice, next time will do mushrooms and experiment with different cheese. yummy!

I used Ementhaler and Greuyer cheeses rather than cheddar because I had them on hand. And, I added sauted mushrooms along with the sausage. I made 1 1/2 times the receipt and had much more than needed to feed 12 people along with fruit, baked goods, etc. EVERYBODY loved it--I thought it could have been a bit more moist; but perhaps I over cooked a bit.

What a great idea! This recipe is so adaptable to agree with taste preferences or diet restrictions. I did forego the garlic butter and because I had a couple plum tomatoes that needed to be used, chopped and added them to the top. So very pretty and festive for a New Year's morning. What a bonus to have it all ready to pop in the oven.

Fantastic crowd pleaser and super-easy to make! I served this on Christmas morning and everyone loved it. Instead of making my own garlic bread, I substituted frozen Texas Toast. This hearty dish would be great to serve to a late-night crowd after an evening of New Year's festivities.

This is a great "group" breakfast. I made it last year for Christmas breakfast for eight. Adults and teenagers really liked it. It is great tasting, different and will be a special breakfast that people will be asking for again and again...along with the recipe. Enjoy!!!
