I made this for a potluck party and it was a big hit. It was so delicious. I used the peaches from my garden that just little ripe. I also add volka to the crush making process to make it more fluffy. I am in fact making another one right now

I would give this recipe 3 1/2 forks. This is a beautiful, delicious pie with only one alteration. I have experimented with leaving out half of the peach juice. I've found that this works well to reduce the overly-juicy tendencies of this pie. If you're into corn starch, I think that would be helpful as well. Local farmer's market peaches in june make this a god among pies. I've made this twice in the last week.

This peach pie was delicious.The only changes I made were to halve the caramel and to leave out most of the peach juice. This kept it both peachy and sweet, without being over-sweet or runny. It turned out great and I won 2nd place in a pie-baking contest with it, so I would say it was a big hit. I especially loved the crust. It was just a little sweet, and perfectly flaky.

I've made this pie every summer for the past few years, as soon as the peaches are in season. I love it! The only problem is that it is so runny. Even if I don't use all the caramel sauce, it still comes out runny. Any other suggestions?

Way too much trouble for an OK result. I have tried this recipe twice and have not had success. No more! Next time I will try a more basic recipe.

This pie tasted very good, the peaches had a great flavor, and there was a perfect amount of syrup. my only comment would be to cut the peaches a lot smaller, they were way to big. other than that, it was great.

I started to make this mid-week and ran out of time so I just dumped the peaches in with a cup of sugar. It tasted great and the crust - sweet and ever so slightly salty - was great. Last night I made it with the caramel sauce and I can see it's appeal but it's not for me. I prefer peach pies/tarts to be not as sweet with the strong cooked peach tasted dominant. In this it was all smoothed away. I'm going to try it with apples, though. Caramel apples. Should be delicious.

I was quite disappointed with this recipe. I didn't think it was up to the 4 fork rating. I had good peaches and I followed the recipe without subsitutions. I found it rather bland. I also found it rather a time consuming pie to make and am sorta glad I don't feel the need to make it again.

A friend and I could not find any decent peaches and decided to try this recipe with apples as a substitute. It worked deliciously. The apples loved the caramel. There was, as other reviewers had noted, too much sauce but we used the excess atop the accompanying ice cream. Someday I will try this recipe with peaches, but this recipe made the best apple pie I've had in a while.

Peach pie is my favourite and this did not disappoint. Making the caramel was tricky and I'm glad I didn't follow the time of 11 minutes as directed as I found my sugar carmelized in 6mins. To ensure that it doesn't burn, have the butter & cream ready to go right in after removing from heat as the sugar keeps cooking. Can anyone explain the reason for cooking the bottom crust first? I never do that with my fruit pies (and didn't here) The cooking time was the same as for any other fuit pie, and it turned out great, not soggy at all.

My boyfriend always raves about his late grandmother's peach pie, and not that I wanted to "out do" anyone at such a traditional "grandmotherly" dish, I DID want to bake what he deemed to be his favorite pie. The pie turned out flawless...the crust does, indeed, brown quickly, but the aroma of the juices along with the smoothness of the caramel make this pie absolutely to die for :)

Very good! Made recipe as specified except I left the skins on. This did deepen the flavor but my husband didn't like dealing with the skins while eating. I will remove the skins the next time. This is the first time I have made a caramel. I burned the first sugar syrup, then I realized that it is very important to watch the syrup closely at the end of the 11 minutes. The second took exactly 11 minutes and I watched it closely at the 6-7 minute mark, swirling frequently. Making the lattice top was not as difficult as I thought. Instead of trying to put ALL of the strips on, put the initial 6 strips on and then put one in the center, crosswise, and weave from the center out. Then put another next to it and do the same thing. This way you are only lifting small parts of the strips. It took me, maybe, three minutes to weave the top with no cracking of the dough.

This pie is absolutely delicious! I've made it several times now and found that I prefer the end result when I use quite ripe (juicy) peaches, sometimes in combination with nectarines. The pie is quite forgiving-- I've had the bottom crust shrink on several occasions, but once you've added the lattice crust you'd never know. All in all a 4 forks+ rating!

I made this last year with fresh Utah grown peaches and my family loved it so much, I am making it again this year!! It is very delicious and absolutely faboulous. I do agree, however, that there is a bit too much caramel sauce. I have tried putting the peaches in the pie first, then pouring the caramel over, and it turned out perfect!!

This is an excellent peach pie filling. Made it twice; got raves both times. Just the right amount of sweetness. The caramel is not strong - barely noticeable, but gives the pie an extra depth. I followed everyone's advice and used less of the caramel (maybe 1/2 to 2/3; my kids enjoyed dipping apples in the rest. I use my own pate brisee recipe for the crust.

I agree that too much caramel sauce was made - next time I would put the peaches in first then spoon in the sauce after, keeping in mind that the peaches would still produce juice during baking. Upon cutting it, a lot of juice spilled over but I just suctioned it out with a turkey baster and the rest of the pie was fine! The crust rolled out beautifully but was a little soggy the next day. Very tasty, though!

This pie is beautiful to look at, and fairly tasty too. It did fall short of my expecations, however. I followed the recipe exactly. The crust is easy to make and easy to work with, but not as flakey as my regular recipe. The flavor of the pie was acceptable, but again, not better than a more standard recipe. I had caramel peach sauce left over (wouldn't all fit without overflowing) which we served over pancakes the next morning. Wow! I WILL make the caramel sauce again, it's a taste sensation. I'll go back to my regular recipe next time I feel like peach pie though.

I pride myself in making pies, and once I tried this recipe I immediately added it to my collection. I wholeheartedly urge people to try this recipe - you will fall in love! (Careful with the caramel sauce - theres no need to use all of it)

Gourmet pie!

I agree with the previous reviewer the crust is my new favorite crust to make; it was easy and tasty. I thought the peach filling was a little too sweet. I don't think the carmel was necessary. All in all a beautiful and delicious pie though.

I've made every peach pie on this site and this is by far the best. Truly delicious. The crust will be my new standard pie crust. Be careful when making the caramel, I accidentally burned my the first time and had to start over. My crust did not require tenting to prevent burning. The pie was beautiful as well as tasty.

Best ever peach pie, the caramel really adds to the flavour. One taster thought the caramel should be doubled, I might try that next time and caramelize all the sugar, instead of just a portion. All in all, very good pie. Mine didn't brown all that quickly, didn't need to be tented. I also didn't blind bake the bottom crust.

Success depends on the peaches. Mine were in season - extra juicy, making for great taste, but pretty runny. A cut above your everyday peach pie.
