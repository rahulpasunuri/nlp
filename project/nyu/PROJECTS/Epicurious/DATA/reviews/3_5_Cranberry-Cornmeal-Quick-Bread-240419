Although slightly dense, this is my ideal holiday bread. It can be made the day before, as other comments say, and is a fairly quick quick-bread. There are just two combinations and then you're done. I suggest putting tin foil over the loaf after about 30 minutes, just to prevent it from getting too dark. The maple is the perfect compliment to the cranberries; it is definitely worth using Grade B syrup and buying the extract.

Pecans and cranberries is one of my favorite combinations. This was easy to make and came out tasting great. It took less time to bake than the recipe called for. I didn't have time to wait for it to cool and so it was very crumbly when I served it. Next day the texture was perfect and the flavors had settled together. I used splenda instead of sugar and sugar free maple syrup.

This is a delicious and healthy loaf of bread! Do not over-bake it and let it cool completely before serving or it will be dry. It is a perfect bread for toasting and eating for breakfast.

This is one of my favorite dead-of-winter bread recipes. As everyone else has said, substituting half the butter for 3/4 cup of applesauce keeps the bread moist for almost a week and a half. Also, I omitted the walnuts and doubled the cranberries and that seemed to help keep the crumb moist as well. A definite keeper.

Great right out of the oven. dense dense dense the next day. Would prefer to lighten it up some. omitted nuts and mixed in dried and fresh cranberries. fresh is the way to go. heated them in some honey til a few popped and then let them sit in honey while mixed up the bread. mixed them in at the end.

Loved this bread! Best quick bread I ever made--and worth the search for white whole wheat flour and grade B maple syrup.

The presentation of this bread is fantastic, bright and colorful and with the pecans nicely placed it looks very elegant. It is also very different from other breads. It's very heavy (which means it makes a great gift) and comes out a little dry for me, but putting some almond butter or regular butter complements it quite nicely. I made a few muffins, and they weren't very good. I can't figure out why it's so much better as a loaf than muffins, but it is.

I have made this twice for parties. Everyone loves it. The second time I doubled the recipe, used half the butter and replaced it with unsweetened applesauce. The loaf was more moist. We love it because it isn't overly sweet. Leftovers toasted are wonderful.

I doubled this recipe and baked it in a double-length loaf pan. It turned out fabulous--very pretty with the pecans on the top. We had a bit left over and toasted it up for breakfast in the morning. Wonderful! This is a surprisingly good recipe. Another winner from epicurious.com!

Delicious! It turned out very moist and made an excellent breakfast on Thanksgiving. I took it out about 5 minutes early and it was perfect.

A very quick, easy and tasty bread. I followed the recipe exactly with the except I toasted the pecans. My bread was done at the one hour mark. Excellent toasted.

I overcooked this a bit - and made as muffins rather than a loaf. I loved the maple flavor - important to use a good grade of syrup. I will definitely make again.

A rustic, sweet, quick-bread that didn't impress me much. Although it wasn't bad enough to throw away, and despite the fact that it grew on me the more I ate, I can't imagine that I'll ever make this again.

I followed the recipe using organic ingredients, vanilla extract instead of maple extract, and French salted butter. It makes a beautiful loaf, just as shown in the magazine. It is a little too dense and sweet (probably because of the organic sugar and maple syrup), but different and delicious for breakfast with a cup of good coffee. I will make it again, with less sugar.

I have to agree with clarityandstatic. It's very dense but also dry. After tasting the batter I did add a bit more sugar, but still not sweet enough for my taste. I doubled the recipe and have plenty left over since no one was particularly fond of it. It's edible but not a recipe I'd ever make again. It might be okay to toast, spread a little butter and cinnamon sugar on top. You're not going to wow anyone with this quick bread.

This was very heavy for a quick bread. Seemed like it should have been a savory recipe instead of a sweet one.

This was a great recipe! It's easy to make, yummy and pretty! One could even bring this along as a gift. Thought this could be baked as muffins instead of a loaf, if one wanted to.

Very tasty. Made a really large loaf. Not sure I loved the pecans, might leave them out next time.

Luckily, my housemates will eat anything. Ill make it again, if only to use up the whole carton of buttermilk waiting around. Next time, Ill definitely use maple extract instead of vanilla, and switch to a richer grade of syrup. Also, dont be tempted to throw in fresh cranberries, their taste really needs to be cut by a much sweet recipe. Lessons learned!

Excellant! Moist, extremely Flavorful. Going to make this again for Thanksgiving.

I love the cranberry cornmeal cookies on Epicurious, so I couldn't wait to try this recipe. I didn't include the nuts or the maple extract (used vanilla instead), but it was very tasty, looked lovely, had great texture from the cornmeal, and was nice and moist.

My 13-year-old son made this and it was great. We didn't use the extract but added a little orange zest. It was a big hit.

Substituted diced, peeled apple for the cranberries. Also didn't have maple extract.Very flavorful bread - could really taste the maple syrup. Tasted like something that might have been eaten in Colonial America.
