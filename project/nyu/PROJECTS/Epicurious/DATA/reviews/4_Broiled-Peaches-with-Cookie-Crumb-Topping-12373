This is so quick and easy, but so tasty. I have made this several times and every one has loved it. I use peaches and raspberries - the recipe is very forgiving, you can add other soft fruit, or a bit more/less sugar, lemon juice or butter, and it still takes great. I have put this together in 10 minutes (particularly if you don't peel the fruit), while guests are digesting dinner. Served last night with vanilla and ginger ice creams, and with the angel food/banana/chocolate parfaits (also on this website, served in trifle dish).

Made a double recipe, but had to substitue nectarines. Perfectly easy and delicious. Great last minute recipe.

Wow! Simply wonderful!! Easy and very yummy! I doubled the recipe, and still not enough for my family. Can't wait to make it again. Thanks for the recipe.

Really, really good; easy and quick too! Not too sweet, even perhaps a bit tart for my taste. I used graham crackers instead of butter or shortbread cookies and liked the result. Only complaint - two peaches were not enough for two people. Next time I'll try three.
