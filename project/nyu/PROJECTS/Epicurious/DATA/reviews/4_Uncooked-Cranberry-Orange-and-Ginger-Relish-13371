I had something like this relish at a friends Thanksgiving celebration and it was a big hit. People could not stop eating it. My friend said it was super easy just one whole orange, 1 bag of cranberries and sugar to taste. The recipe here sounded similar, but with the addition of fresh ginger. I peeled the orange first and trimmed the rind of the pith before adding. I grated my fresh ginger because I didn't want to risk a large piece getting by my processor. Luckily I started with 1/2 Cup sugar because it did not need any more. If you make this be sure to start with less sugar and taste it. Candied ginger sounds like a great addition also, but again, could reduce the need for all the sugar. It turns out very juicy so be prepared for that. Also the sugar does not dissolve that fast so it needs to be made a few hours in advance just in case so the sugar can melt. I use large grain organic sugar so it takes longer. It was delicious. It just requires the cook to taste as they go to get the right proportions of the simple ingredients.

This relish is wonderful. The version I had substituted 1/2 ground ginger for the ginger root and additionally, added about 1/2 tsp cinnamon. It's so good it can stand alone as a side dish.

This is a great recipe. I experimented and froze in plastic containers last year. Froze exceptionally well. Since cranberries are seasonal I plan on freezing more this year.

I love this twist on a traditionall cranberry orange relish. Instead of the ginger root, I used Gourmet Garden ginger spice blend from the tube, which I always find in the produce section near the fresh herbs. This makes it even quicker and easier!

Very simple and well balanced flavors. I did take some liberty and listened to previous reviewers, only adding half of the orange peel. I will make this again!

Absolutely delicious! This was the first time I made this recipe. I modified the relish using the peel and segments only. For a less tart relish I recommend using only half of the rind with the orange segments. I look forward to making this again soon!

This was the first time I made cranberry relish using raw cranberries. I'll never make anything else again. I was afraid it would be too tart. Wrong, it's exceptionally flavorful as written.

One of my favorites. I make it regularly as a light, crisp side. The one change to the recipe that I recommend is this: instead of including the entire rind of the orange, zest the orange first, and mince fine. Then peel the orange and chop the orange without the pith. This reduces the bitterness and gives you a cleaner orange flavor. Absolutely delicious. Lovely with toasted nuts and yogurt, or with any meat or cheese. Best after sitting for a day.

This is such an improvement over the usual cranberry concoctions, and I generally like them. Fresh, tart, and definitely snappy tasting with the ginger. I've made it twice and experimented the second time with actually a little more ginger and a little cilantro added - even more delicious!

My husband liked this alot. I think the orange pith flavor is a little bitter - but it is very refreshing and good on top of cheesecake too

Go ahead and make it for Thanksgiving - doesn't take much time - or make it Tuesday - it really gives a lift to some of those other traditional dishes one eats at Thanksgiving. I make this at least 6 times a year - YUM!

I LOVE this recipe! It is so easy and my mother always asks me to bring it to thanksgiving dinner the past three years. It is always a big hit.

Simple, basic, OK, quick, but nothing real special. The ginger did add a nice flavor.

Definitely a keeper! Simple, good, do in advance alternative to the "awful jelly stuff that comes in a can"! lol

Fresh, simple to make, tasty alternative to traditional sauce. I put this together in less than 10 minutes, from fridge to serving bowl. Will probably make this and serve it as part of a trio of sauces during holidays each year.

This was the second time I made this. I substituted crystallized ginger for the fresh and prepared it a day in advance. Fresh and zingy addition to the holiday feast! Very quick.

This is a great alternative to that awful cranberry-jelly stuff that comes in a can. I've been making it for years, and always have had great success.
