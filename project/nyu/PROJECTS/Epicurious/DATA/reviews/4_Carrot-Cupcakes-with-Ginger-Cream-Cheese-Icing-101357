I made these with some of the modifications people suggested: reduced oil to 1/2 cup, filled cups to the top (which wound up being the perfect amount, made exactly 12) and increased the ginger in the frosting to 3 tsp. They are amazing - I garnished the top of each with one of the following: thin carrot shavings (tiny bit of orange peel using a zester may work too), or slivers of candied ginger (which I did have lying around, but who has candied violets?!). Would definitely make again. Had about a cup of extra frosting left.

These are a little more bland than I would prefer, but they are a very kid friendly carrot cake recipe which is why I make them as is. Sometimes I save half the batter for a more grown up version and throw in a little shredded coconut, nutmeg and a few more sprinkles of cinnamon. Just use my fave cream cheese frosting recipe. Never tried this frosting recipe.

These have great flavor, but are much too oily. I put them on a paper towel after they cooled, and they left little oil circles behind. Cutting down to 1/2 cup would help. Otherwise the recipe is very good as stands.

Just made these and they're really tasty, not too sweet which works perfectly with a sweet icing like the related Ginger Cream Cheese Icing. I added about 1/4 tsp ground ginger and a pinch of ground cardamom to the cake to play off the flavors in the icing. Delicious! I'd give them three and a half forks, if I could. But, a word of caution: I always tend to overfill my cupcakes and they puff out all over the place and end up misshapen. So for once I was determined not to overfill. Well, these cupcakes did not rise AT ALL, and I ended up with very short, flat cupcakes - most actually below the edge of the liner. I had to build them up with a thick layer of frosting (not the worst thing in the world, but still). It explained why I ended up with about 18 cupcakes instead of the stated yield of 12. So, the moral of the story is: Don't UNDER-fill with these (the stated 3/4 full is not enough, I don't think). You should end up with about a dozen cupcakes, as the recipe states. Any more and you haven't filled them up enough.

My aunt wanted a layered cake with a cream cheese icing for her birthday. I doubled the recipe and used two 9 inch round cake pans. I sprinkled pecans on the top because I didn't have time for the candied violets. This is the first cake and icing I have made from scratch. WOW! My family loved it! The carrots and ginger took the most prep time.

I have made this recipe 3 times in the span of 1 week. I doubled it each time with the following changes and turned into more than cupcakes: First time - doubled everything and put into rectangular baking sheet. I did not double the frosting though and it was plenty! The only other change was that I drained an 8oz can of crushed pineapple and used the whole thing. The flavor was good... my cooking time was extra since my oven is HORRID! Even still it came out good and moist... though maybe too greasy Second time - doubled the recipe except for oil. I put 1 cup oil total to doubling the recipe. This time I doubled the frosting too (used 2x 8oz cream cheese) and had sooo much leftover (which leads me to the third batch, but I'll get to that) I baked this in 2x 9inch cake rounds and make a two layer cake w/ frosting between and toasted walnuts and also on top and on the side... it was PHENOMENAL! And the less oil was better! Wonderful cake. Third time - followed all the same stuff for the cake, but this time I finally made the cupcakes. Haven't tried them yet, but they got rave reviews at work... I did some w/ nuts and others without. I still have frosting left over at home! I guess it'll go to waste... but I now know I have a great and easy go to carrot cake recipe.

I made these with 1/2 cup canola oil and 3/4 cup sugar as someone suggested. They were plenty sweet and moist. I did substitute 1/2 cup apple/apricot sauce/purée for the pineapple. Will have to try with pineapple to see if they will taste even better.

I first baked these for Mother's day brunch. They were such crowd pleasers that I've since baked them twice! I find that they yield at least 16 cupcakes if you fill large cupcake liners to 3/4 full. I reduce the icing sugar to about 1 1/2 cups. You could easily reduce oil to 1/2 cup, however, the 3/4 c oil make the cupcakes nice and moist. I wonder if anyone has suggestions for decoration (besides candied violets). I pipe the icing on with a pastry bag (refrigerating the icing first). But I think it needs a colorful ornament on top.

These are a crowd pleaser! Easy to make and very delicious. I love that they stay so moist.

I followed other reviewers suggestions and used about 1/2 cup of oil (I used canola) and about 3/4 of a cup of sugar and they tasted great!!! You have to use the Ginger-Cream Cheese Icing with these - the icing definitely makes them AMAZING!!

I loved these cupcakes and they were a hit at the party! I substitued half cup prune puree and cut the oil to 1/4 cup, and used 1/2 cup Splend/sugar mix (comes mixed in sealable bag). They were super moist and the ginger pulled it together beautifully! This is one of my favorites!

These cupcakes are AMAZING!!! They are supermoist- which I love -and the ginger in the forsting is a fabulous touch. I made these as mini cupcakes and just reduced the baking time.

I had a problem with these rising...they weren't pretty, but they still tasted good. I made them with a regular cream cheese icing, but will try the ginger icing next time.

I used organic pastry flour and organic carrots, added a half cup of golden raisins, 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, 1 tsp of vanilla, half cup sugar and half cup Splenda. Came out moist and flavourful - a big hit in a family dinner party. The ginger cream cheese icing was great, I added an extra teaspoon of ginger as per other's suggestions and it was the right hit of flavour. Only complaint is that the icing recipe made way too much, now I have alot left over in my fridge.

I made these twice- once as cupcakes for Easter and once as muffins the other day..with the suggestions for reduced oil and sugar. I added pecan, golden raisins, vanilla, a bit of toasted coconut for the cupcakes and the muffins were moist, flavorful but not amazingly unforgettable. When making the Ginger frosting, it's not nessary to usethe entire stick of butter- it needs more ginger for a good pop of flavor. I also added some lime juice to the frosting and it was fresh and yummy!

Rating: 4
Followed the suggestions to cut down the oil (to 1/2 c) and sugar (cut to 3/4 c) and it turned out wonderfully! Didn't ice them and the muffins are perfect for breakfast or dessert. Definitely adding this as a new favorite recipe.

I loved this recipe. I used it to make mini cupcakes, and they were so light and moist--truly the perfect consistency for carrot cake. But the real thing to rave about here is the icing. The ginger is the perfect complement to the carrots, and so much more fun than plain cream cheese frosting.

I make this with 2/3 cup oil and 3/4 cup sugar, don't frost them, and call them carrot muffins. The whole family enjoys these for breakfast :)

great combination of light (not dense) cakes with ideal tang of ginger in icing (which I just used on pumpkin cupcakes).

Rating: 4
If you're looking for a less dense carrot cake recipe, I recommend this one. My husband normally doesn't like carrot cake but he liked this one because it was light and moist and of course the frosting which was excellent! They keep well in the fridge for several days too.

My mother (who makes a great carrot cake) asked me for this recipe, which means it must be great. I added a little extra ginger to the icing and topped each cupcake with a chunk of candied ginger. I love them and will make them again and again

The carrot cakes were good, but the frosting made them 10 times better than they were. I took them to a picnic and everyone loved them. I will make them again for sure.

The cakes fell in the center a little and like other reviewers I thought they were way too greasy. The frosting on the other hand was to die for. I'll look for another carrot cake recipe, but will keep the recipe for the frosting.

I made these for my boyfriend's birthday, and they came out great! Super moist, and very delicious. I made several changes to the frosting, as follows: added about a cup and a half of sweetened flaked coconut, and the juice of one lime, and only about a cup of powdered sugar. Wow!

Rating: 4
Easy and fast to make. Favorite treat at work. Very moist. (I add extra carrots--a cup more?)Make lots of little mini cupcakes out of the batter and ice with the ginger icing (though it really isn't necessary). The candied violets are too much work and I don't think anyone misses them.

I usually make this recipe as a cake, rather than as cupcakes. I also find them a little oily so I cut back on the oil a bit. I also find that cutting back on the sugar in the icing is better. Use a 9X9 cake pan and bake a little longer to make a wonderful carrot cake. I don't know of a better recipe for carrot cake, yet.

We did not make the carrot cake but used the ginger frosting for another bon appetit carrot cake recipe & it was fabulous! I love the frosting. If you don't use the cupcake recipe at least use the frosting!

Everyone truly enjoyed the cupcakes. It was easy to make and serve-(at a picnic). The icing is unique and added some zing to the traditional carrot cake.

Maybe it's the Colorado altitude, but I bake well and these turned out miserable for me. They fell in the center and were much too greasy. I didn't bother icing them, because they went straight to the trash. Disappointing, to say the least!

Rating: 2
Doubled the recipe, but took other reviewers' suggestion and didn't double the oil - used only 1 cup oil - tops of cupcakes were still oily looking, but tasted okay. The recipe was a bit too sweet for me. I would cut the sugar way down. The other Epicurious recipe for Carrot cupcakes with Molasses cream cheese icing went over much better with both children and adults. The ginger cream-cheese icing was good, though, and I would make that again.

I made these for my 4 year old's class and everyone loved them. I'm making them again for her to take tomorrow. I made a double recipe of the cup cakes, but a single batch of the frosting should cover them...

Rating: 2
Good, but kind of greasy. I agree with the cook from Washington, D.C. If I make these again, I would decrease the amount of oil. The cream cheese ginger frosting was absolutely delicious.

Rating: 3
Yummy! Next time I would just add raisins, and probably decrease some of the vegetable oil.

I made these for my son's Communion party and was surprised that the little kids wanted them as much as the adults (who they were intended for). They were easy, pretty and tasty.

I'm looking forward to making this recipe -- but could you give me some tips on making this at high altitudes? I live at ~6000 ft -- does this require any adjustment? I'd like to make this recipe this weekend -- could you help?? Thanks!
