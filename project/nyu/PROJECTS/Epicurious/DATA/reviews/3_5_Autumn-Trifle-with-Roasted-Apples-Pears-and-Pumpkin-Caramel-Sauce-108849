I love this recipe. I made it tonight and my family absolutely loved it. I did have an issue with my custard not setting up (it did thicken but then it turned to soup. A little cornstarch and it thickened right back up). I will definitely make this again in the near future.

I have made the recipe but not tasted yet (six hour cooling time in refrigerator before serving as dessert for late October meal). I skipped the cinnamon in the pastry cream because the flavor can be overwhelming and not everybody in my family likes cinnamon. I don't know if it is just me, but the pastry cream turned out to be a sort of oleaginous blob. Next time I will cut down flour or omit altogether. Agree that more fruit is needed. No way could I find the soft ladyfingers so I used the hard ones and soaked in plenty of Poire William (as opposed to sherry). I also only used pears, increasing the amount for the missing apples. Am curious to try, but nervous that this might be over-rich and gloppy, given the extremely rich combination of pastry cream, caramel and whipping cream....

Takes some time to make, but worth every minute.

This really wowed everyone at Thanksgiving. Very rich and a gorgeous presentation. Great to make it one day ahead so it makes it ideal for entertaining. Next time I make it I would add more roasted fruit. The pumpkin caramel sauce is to die for. This is a keeper.

I would never have chosen this dessert to make but it was a special request from a friend who saw it in Bon Appetit. I gave it a pre-Thanksgiving test run. I thought it was great! As I was tasting the different parts along the way, I did not think it would be that good but put it all together...combines to make a beautiful and delicious dessert! My only deviation from the recipe was to add some of the whipped cream into the lower layer. I will make again for Thanksgiving.

I made this last Thanksgiving and it was the best dish of all. I am happy to find the recipe again, and may try Calvados instead of the sherry, it wasn't pretty, but delicious!

Mine did not turn out nearly as pretty as this one. Pay attention to the picture: they put the ladyfingers in horizontally, not vertically. I put mine in vertically, and there was way too much room left at the top and I didn't get three layers of them, either. I would cut the cinammon in the pastry cream down to one teaspoon. This mixture is good, but not really attractive on the plate. I might do a different version of this someday and use a genoise or pound cake. Ladyfingers were too delicate for the hearty fruit. I would also probably make white chocolate whipped cream and find a way to incorporate some toasted nuts.

I made this for thanksgiving, I have a severe issue with making caramel, no matter how hard I try I always burn it, so I used jarred caramel, it came out a little to sweet because of that, but other than being a little to sweet due to human error it's a wonderful holiday dessert!

Very labor intensive, but worth it. Wonderful fall flavors. I increased the fruit and it was still very rich.

I used the body of this recipe as a jumping off point. I made the roasted fruit filling and pumpkin caramel sauce and then went ahead and used it as a crisp with a topping of toasted macadamia nuts and oatmeal. I have made it several times, once for a crew of about 40 for dinner and everyone raved.

Alot of work and have made better trifles that are still labor intensive but worth it.

I liked the roasted fruit layer. I ended up using hard lady fingers which didn't absorb and soften. I thought the cinnamon layer was a bit too thick. All in all our guests loved it - I'll would try it again with soft ladyfingers.

I made this trifle for Christmas with a few very successful substitutions. Instead of the lady fingers, I used gingerbread and instead of the sherry, I used Calvados. I also made three layers instead of two. This was a big hit with my family, even with the members who are not dessert fans. I will definitely make this again.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year and it was a great success. It is a recipe that really exemplifies Autumn flavors. I intend to add more fruit by half, but other than that, would not change a thing. This is a very elegant, (very labor intensive- allow lots of prep time!), impressive, and delicious dessert.

I've made many trifles from Bon Appetit and all have been wonderful. I have not yet made this one though but am thinking about Calvados or Ameretto instead of the sherry... Also, I have used hard ladyfingers from Trader Joe's most of the time without any problems. They soften up after contact with all the custard and liquor.

Rating: 2
I decided after this recipe that I just must not care for trifle. I made it perfectly as suggested, but the lady fingers made it "mealy" tasting. The combination was not for me. I guess I was not raised on trifle and don't appreciate the overall texture.

Rating: 4
I have made this dish every Thanksgiving for the last three years. The first two years, I couldn't find any lady fingers so I used pound cake cut into slices. Last year, I found hard lady fingers at Trader Joes. I think the pound cake was better than the lady fingers. This is a dish that will always be on my Thanksgiving table every year.

I made this recipe a couple Thanksgivings ago. It turned out so fabulously! I had to look for this recipe so I could review it, it stuck out in my mind so well. Mine turned out better than the picture and the colors were awesome. This dessert is awfully time consuming and does make a huge mess....but over all it turned out great!

Rating: 1
Where did I go wrong? It was bland tasting and had virtually no texture at all. I should have made a crisp!

Rating: 3
This is time consuming. End result is an unattractive trifle that tastes great. The cinnamon gives the pastry cream the worst color. The pumpkin-carmel cream is to die for. Do use more fruit. Do not use a glass trifle bowl.

Made this as part of my thanksgiving feast. I was looking for a recipe to pull together a pumpkin cheesecake and an apple tart. This was definitely it. As others recommended, I increased the fruit. There were no complaints from my family, only raves. Definitely a keeper.

Very good! Wow, did it make a lot - I was initially worried that it wouldn't feed everyone, but we had plenty of left-overs. I, too, couldn't find the soft lady fingers, so I used panettone instead. It worked beautifully!

I made this for Thanksgiving as well and it was a big hit. The only thing I would do differently next time is double the amount of roasted fruit. I could barely tell there was any in there by the time it cooked. Rave reviews from our holiday crowd. I would make again.

Rating: 4
I have made this 3 Thanksgivings in a row (to a Texas crowd) because it was such a big hit. I think the comments about not being able to taste sherry, fruit etc. miss the point. The beauty of this dish is the whole of it -- not the individual parts. It is a sublime dish. No individual layer dominates. I agree the caramel takes longer to melt than the recipe says.

Rating: 2
IThis was a disappointment. I followed the directions to the letter, but increased the fruit as others suggested. In spite of this, I could barely taste the apples or pears, and not the sherry at all. The pumpkin caramel, while good, seemed to overwhelm the other flavors. It looked better than it was. Sorry, only 2 forks.

I made this for thanksgiving last year and it was wonderful. I used about twice as much fruit as called for and substituted a Muscat for the Sherry- I think it was called Elysium which was fantastic. The sauce was so good I'm making it this year to accompany bread pudding- but I'm going to make twice as much so I can have it on icecream for a while.

When I first read this recipe I was turned off by the idea of using lady fingers but then I had a flash and substituted them with my homemade gingerbread. Yum! I received raving reviews on Thanksgiving.

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out wonderfully. Our guests loved it so did my family. I can not imagine using canned fruit and Cool Whip for this recipe (or for any other.) No wonder they are not impressed with the results.

This was a beautiful trifle, but time consuming. The taste is mellow and excellent. I made this for a New Year's Eve dessert just to try something. It came out nice and very rich, Next year I will make it for Thanksgiving, a holiday for which its flavors are more appropriate. I had to go to 5 stores before I found soft and not hard lady fingers. I took advice from some of the other reviewers and increased the amount of fruit, which helped. I used 6 pears, and 6 apples and still could have used more. I can't taste the sherry at all, so maybe you can do with out it. I used whipping cream but it did not hold too well. also the caramel does take longer to dissolve then they say it does. I will make more of the pumpkin sauce just to pour on ice cream or cake.

I made this exactly as described. It was beautiful, but nothing special to taste. No one complimented me on it. I am glad there were three other desserts on Christmas day. There is very little solid in the recipe, and the small cubes of cold fruit were not exactly pleasant texturally.

Rating: 4
Outstanding recipe, I increased the fruit by about 1/3 based on reviewers suggestions and felt like I had the perfect amount. Very nice change of pace from pie and chocolate for the holidays. I freely admit to using and enjoying Cool Whip!

Rating: 4
Definitely worth the prep time. You can do it in stages and well ahead of time. Though I made this for an early December party, I think it's going to replace my usual Thanksgiving desserts next year. I like it better than my usual pumpkin and apple pies, and it has the flavors of both. My guests really liked it too, and several requested the recipe.

Rating: 4
Fabulous dessert! Sure, it's time consuming, a calorie splurge and I probably won't make it again for awhile, but we couldn't believe how incredibly delicious it was. The combination of flavors in this recipe was heavenly. Be sure to order the ladyfingers ahead of time if you can, otherwise poundcake, as suggested below, is a great alternative. But, I have to agree, Cool Whip should never be used in such a wonderful dessert.

Rating: 4
As the other reviewers indicated, this is a labor intensive project but well worth it. I put the whipped cream on just before I served it and next time I will do that early in the day. I also like the suggestion of using some Sarah Lee Pound Cake in addition to the lady fingers. I had a couple of guests who do not like the taste of alcohol so I brushed the lady fingers with orange juice. This is a spectacular fall dessert that I will definitely make again for home or to take to a party.

This was an excellent dessert but very labor intensive. When I added the cream to the caramel sauce, the caramel hardened up into a big glob and took quite a while to dissolve but the end result was delicious. Also, I found that the fruit didn't need to roast nearly as long as the recipe called for, but I think that may be because of my quirky oven and not because the recipe is wrong.

Rating: 4
Yes, this did take some prep time (I did as much before hand as possible), but oh was it good! The caramel took a lot longer to dissolve in the cream than the recipe indicates, but it was worth it. I also put the ladyfingers vertically in the dish (opposite of the picture), and, since soft ladyfingers were in VERY short supply in the local shops, I used Sarah Lee butter loaf for the layers (where no one could see) and the ladyfingers for the bit around the bowl. I too would use a little more fruit next time, but, as it was, this dish a big hit on Thanksgiving.

Great Dessert, I placed the lady finges upright in the bowl (opposite of how pictured) made as much ahead as possible. This dessert was a harvest pleasure.

Rating: 2
This is a delicious recipe but far too time consuming. I would not make this again as part of a complete meal I prepared. If all I need to bring as a guest is dessert, Autumn trifle it is. I would us more fruit and less custard and skip a layer of ladyfingers.

I am also a Scottish gourmet cook who recently moved to San Antonio. We should get together and talk shortbread. When I tried this recipe, I was out of sherry so I used Galliano. My husband, Bob, thought it was fabulous. It was very time-consuming, however, and maybe next time I should use Cool Whip to cut down on preparation time.

I am a Scottish gourmet now leaving in Texas, so I have combined the best of both Scotland and Texas by making some changes: Substitute red pepper flakes for cinnamon; short bread for lady fingers; scotch for sherry and dried plums (of coursed soaked in scotch) for pears. I must also add that the reviewers in Oregon should stick to furit cake!

hmm. I made it this weekend and my family loved it. I did use cool whip as I have a hard time with whipping cream. I also used the cherries, but being from Oregon i used canned cherries, which I am sure the person from Boring also used since they are native to us....it was wonderful! I also used the mandarin oranges (had to pit them first). A girlfriend of mine who had it at Boring's house recommended it and I am glad I took her advice: little fuss and a great dessert. No dog hair tho!

I haven't made this recipe yet, but I am sure it will be delicious. Great idea from Boring to make with cherries, oranges, cool whip, and dog hair. What kind of dog is it?

I just graduated culinary school and have started working as a private chef for several families; all with very different palates. I have made this trifle three times already for three different families and the reviews are all the same. They absolutely loved it! Of course a little work goes into putting it together, but remember this dessert is what it is and the wow factor is the TRIFLE itself. Served in the proper dish, this was a beautiful and delicious ending to any autumn meal. I would recommend this recipe to anyone with a little patience and an appreciation of fresh ingredients. (PS-I wouldn't let Cool Whip within a mile of any dessert I make! Why ruin all that hard work with mediocre ingredients?)

Rating: 0
To the cook from Boring...pardon me, but I can't understand, how anyone who can tolerate Cool Whip, doesn't understand what a good sherry can add to a recipe, and would use maraschino cherries(do you know how they are made?), is even doing on this website.
