Nice pasta dish. Everything hinges on the quality of the cherry tomatoes you're using.

This was a great, easy weeknight recipe which Ive now made several times. I only had basil in the garden so I used that instead of the mint and parsley. Also added a touch of hot pepper and a splash of wine.

Excellent and easy. I added figs from my back yard and the sweetness played off the tart of the tomatoes - Yum

Very good, straightforward, easy recipe. I had some leftover asparagus that I added for extra flavor/variety. Also, I used spinach fettucine.

We loved this recipe. It was so easy to prepare (especially since our garden is full of tomatoes and herbs) and very light, yet creamy and satisfying. Next time, and there will be a next time, I will use less oil and fewer tomatoes. A definate keeper!

This was also really good the next day as a cold "pasta salad" - yum!

Everyone in our family enjoyed this dish and it is especially useful when the garden is bursting with cherry tomatoes.

A good quick dish. If your garden is putting out a lot of cherry tomatoes this is a good way to use them. I used red and yellow sweet 100s from my garden. I also added some chopped red onion with the garlic and used spinach fettucinni. The color combination made for a nice presentation.
