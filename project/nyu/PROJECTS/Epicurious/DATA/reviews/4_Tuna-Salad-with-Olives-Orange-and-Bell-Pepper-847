Delicious! Finally, a way to eat tuna for lunch, on a budget, that doesn't gross me out after one meal. Rather than on a bed of greens, I used quinoa, which I also have been trying to find a way to make it tasty.

I followed the recipe - except I use Kalamata olives instead of green olives. After reading the recipe I only made because of the 4 forks because it didn't seem exceptional. I can't believe how good it is. It elevates canned tuna to a completely different level. Make it and enjoy!!

Delicious! Excellent alternative to tuna salad. Fresh and healthier than mayo.

I was a little skeptical - what with canned tuna and oranges, a seemingly unlikely pair! But, we're trying to lose some weight and this recipe fit within our criteria so I gave it a try. WOW! It was fantastic. The dressing really enhances the dry tuna and the little bits of orange provide bursts of juicy sweetness. Not only would I make this again, I'd pay for it in a restaurant!

Delicious. I cut the orange segments in half which works better, and substituted capers for the olives.

I would give this 3.5 stars if I could, saving 4 stars for the truly exceptional. This recipe is delicious and so simple. I used two 6-oz jars from Trader Joe's (one in water, one in olive oil) and loved how it came out. The second time I used two cans in water and that was good as well. Chopping all the ingredients to almost a mince fooled my olive- and onion-hating boyfriend, who had seconds. I just bought tuna to make this a third time-- it's such a good staple lunch dish as a sandwich or salad.

Loved this, as did the gals in my book club. It was a leeetle liquidy but a slotted spoon for serving solved that. I added a cooked purple potato and used green olives with no pimiento. The potato was nice to help balance the sweetness of the orange, pepper & red wine vinegar. Perfect for summer (no heat!). I felt lively and healthy and like a million bucks after eating this meal.

Interesting and delicious. But because tuna is such a powerful flavor, next time I would leave the olives whole and peel and segment the oranges rather than premier them so that you would get a burst of orange flavor.

Substituted an avocado, cubed, for the red pepper as I don't care for them. Also used mandarin oranges - much easier than sectioning one by hand. This salad was a good change of pace.

A wonderful summer salad! Easy to prepare and the flavors complimented each other wonderfully. I'll definitely make this one again.

This was a delicious tuna salad, and a nice variation from the traditional mayo base. I roasted my own bell pepper, instead of using canned, and followed the recipe exactly. I think this would be even better with fresh grilled tuna over mixed greens.

I loved this recipe, tied of mayo with my tuna, loved the vinegar bite. I had no red bell pepper so I subbed golden raisens for that sweet tang, perfect really I may use them along with the red pepper next time.

Made my own variation of this for dinner last night. Used roasted red peppers instead of raw, and seared two tuna steaks as opposed to canned letting the other ingredients (except greens) sit in the dressing as tuna cooked. Piled the greens on a platter, topped with the sliced tuna, and finished it off with the dressing. Delicious and very attractive on the plate. Will definitely be making this one again!

Delicious! Made this for a cafe menu tasting of about 8 different tuna salads. I hate canned tuna but I did not want to stop eating this one. The interplay of flavors is a winner, as is the appearance. I would give 4 forks if comparing only to canned tuna recipes, but alas, it is canned tuna, so only 3.

All 8 of the ladies I served this to, loved it. Refreshing and complex at the same time!

This is a wonderfully colorful and flavorful salad, and a great use for canned tuna. I always buy tuna packed in oil, it tastes much better and isn't nearly as dry. And it will still be plenty healthy! This salad is quite good without the onion and parsley, and other nuts, such as pinon, can be substituted for the almonds.

I've never been a big fan of tuna, but I love this recipe! Instead of tossing this with greens I put in on french bread with a little cheese over it and baked it in the oven until the cheese was just melted. Yummy, yummy!

Great Recipe, but I would substitute the tuna with chicken breast. Let's face it canned Tuna's is always slightly over cooked and can be crumbly and dry. If you cut back on the olive oil you could also make something that weight watchers would love

This recipe was soo good. I used tablespoons each of the red wine vinegar an olive oil - I used a garlic infused olive oil because the flavour is more subtle. With so many flavours you don't need much dressing and it doesn't need to be strong. The oranges, onion and olives play off one another really nicely while the parsley keeps it all fresh. This is the ultimate dinner salad. I doubled the tuna to make it really filling but it wasn't necessary. Try it!!

This was fantastic. Made exactly according to the recipe and loved every bite. It was even good the next day - what little was left.

I'm not normally a salad fan but this was an interesting and tasty combination of flavours. Just one word of caution, I picked a bag of mixed salad leaves with rocket included in the mix - I normally love rocket but it tasted really weird in this salad and I had to pick them out!
