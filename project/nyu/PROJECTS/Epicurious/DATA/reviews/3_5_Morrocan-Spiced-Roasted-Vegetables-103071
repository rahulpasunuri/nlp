I know this recipe is really old, but I just made it yesterday and wanted to post a review. It was a great hit. I kept the ingredients and proportions more or less intact, but cut everything down by 25% and used even less salt than that. I brought the dish to a dinner I was attending, and everyone loved it. The spices were terrific, and I would not say that it was "sweet." And even at 25% less than the original recipe, there were a LOT of veggies! This is a great Thanksgiving side dish or veggie entre - I will definitely be making it again.

Just made this with Chicken with tomatoes and prunes last night. Very tasty. I used the butternut squash, shallots(lots), a red onion, orange and yellow bell pepper, sweet potatoes and carrots, very autumnal. Roasted everything together. Easy!

I made this with just sweet potatoes and carrots, and it was very good. I did add extra spices, although not double. Don't skimp on the shallots - they are the best part.

I love this recipe! I just use sweet potatoes, sweet onion and red pepper and it comes out delicious. Instead of dicing things, I cut everything long like french fries. I also add a little Japanese red pepper spice mix for extra zest. Truly a staple in my house!

I really liked this and would definitely make again. The sweet potatoes in particular were wonderful. I agree that the butter wasn't necessary--I'd probably just increase the oil a bit next time.

Really, really nice! The blend of spices is a nice accent to the veggies. Had to roast much longer than 45 minutes to get a nice carmelized flavor, but worth the wait. Had with Lamb Kebabs seasoned with Corriander and Cumin, and a couscous salad. Big hit. Also great with Beef-Short Ribs Tagine found on this site.

Excellent. Aromatic. Complex flavors. Made with lamb chops for a special dinner party and got raves galore.

LOVELY. the butter is unnecessary. use white sweet potatoes if you can. roast at 400 degrees on a cookie sheet for nicer caramelization. this is such a nice, flavorful change from the usual roasted vegetables!! i made it with a swordfish tagine and couscous with almonds.

It's very nice, but certainly nothing earth-shattering. I would recommend adding a very small amount of sugar to the spice mixture, and baby carrots to the vegetables.

Good. Not sure it's worth doing both butternut squash AND sweet potatoes, because they end up tasting the same in this recipe, with the same texture. So if you only find one, don't let it stop you. I sprinkle finely-diced caramelized onions on it (to a crisp) as well as heavily sauteed semi-spicy peppers such as pasillas. The peppers add color and oomph.

This is so good! We make it for potlucks all of the time, and everyone loves it.

I hate to break this recipe's winning streak but I really didn't like it. I was really hoping to based on all the other reviews. Oh well, nothing ventured nothing gained.

GRRRRRRRREAT! I added some additional spices (like Tumeric, cardamom, and fennel seeds) and I left out the red peppers- I also squeezed the juice of a large meyer lemon and an orange in the butter mixture (I used a non dairy margerine because of our dietary laws) and the people I served this too were literally moaning in ecstacy!

I made this last night for a friend's dinner party and everyone loved it! Instead of just using red peppers I added red, yellow and orange. It's a perfect fall side dish. Yum.

This is a fabulous dish, and the kids love it!! You could ease up on the salt a little if you wanted, and I promise the kitchen will smell sensational!

I believe it's spelled Moroccan.
