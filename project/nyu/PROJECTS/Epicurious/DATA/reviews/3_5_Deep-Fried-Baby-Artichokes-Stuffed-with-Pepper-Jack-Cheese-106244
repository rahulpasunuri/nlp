Too much work for something that doesn't taste amazing. They looked better than they tasted. Better off with simply frying artickoke hearts w/side of aioli.

couldn't figure out from the picture if these were artichoke hearts. I used the hearts and they were nothing special.

Mixed white cheddar and jack 1/2 and 1/2; chopped up some immature garlic from the garden and mixed it in with the cheese. It's not a small amount of work but baby artichokes never are. Everyone raved.

The flavor was ok, but definitely NOT worth all the effort. It took over an hour to get the artichokes prepared to deep fry. I'll look for another recipe for baby artichokes next time.

I served this recipe at Thanksgiving and it was devoured. I was surprized how simple it was to prepare--yet it was very elegant. Only thing I changed was the cheese: a sharp white cheddar; and I sauteed them in a little olive oil and butter with a little minced garlic. I'm not good at deep frying either.

This came out very well, even for the novice deep fryer that I am. I took a previous reviewer's suggestion and served with cold marinara sauce, which was the perfect compliment.

nice and got great reviews from my dinner guests. Lighten up Karl - this is a forum for chefs - not pompous a**es.

To the cook from Sunrise, FL, maybe your doing something wrong. I think as people become better chefs they learn to work a little faster. I thought that this was an interesting appetizer. A strong wow factor from guests. I think that the artichokes that I found were actually mini artichokes. They were about the size of a strawberry after they were fried, so I did not cut them in half. I served them on a platter with a thick marinara sauce that guests could spoon over, which went very well. To any cook that complains about a recipe that is to detailed, stay off epicurious please, go and buy the cheap worthless cookbook rags at the checkout stand.

These are good, but way to much work. I spent too long in the kitchen for such a small plate of appetizers. I don't mind spending this much time on something that is incredible. This was just ok. Not worth it to me.

I made these as an appetizer for my husband's birthday dinner last night. They were wonderful. I made a mistake and cut the artichokes in half before stuffing them, but I think they were actually better than they would have been because the bread crumbs didn't stick to the artichoke well at all but they did stick to the cheese. I used a rustic baguette to make the bread crumbs. They weren't ground very finely, but they worked and were terrific. I'll definiitely make these again!
