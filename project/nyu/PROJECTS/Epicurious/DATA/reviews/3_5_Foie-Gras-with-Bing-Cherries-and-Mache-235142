I made this for our Gourmet and it is fabulous!! We ordered the foie gras from Amazon, Rougie is the brand - very expensive. We bought 2 little tins and each person got 2 thin slices which was plenty. The salad and dressing were very good as well. The cherry balsamic vinegar was $9.99 at Bristol Farms and worth the price. It is actually a little chunky. I had to dilute the syrup as it got too thick after sitting a while.

I substituted Clear Creek Kirschwasser for the one Tblsp of balsamic vinegar used for the cherry and mache mixture. Delicious. Instead of using a knife, I like to use a cheese cutting wire that I originally bought for pancetta. Hold it over the stove for a few seconds before getting down and dirty. It gives you more flexibility in creating a design. Slices like butter. The flavors are bright and my husband loved it. Loved it.

Very simple and elegant. Ordered the foie gras from Dartangnan. The dressing made the dish. I used 1/4 cup regular balsamic vinegar and 1 to 2 Tablespoons cherry juice from some frozen sweet cherries to make the reduction and then used this to both make the dressing and to drizzle on the foie gras. The cherries and reduction add great color and flavor. Christmas 2008

To the other reader's question about when to cook the foie gras -- this recipe must be calling for the precooked foie gras that you can purchase at a gourmet food store. I used canned precooked foie gras that we ordered via the Internet (Rougie is the brand name -- you can purchase at http://www.gourmetfoodstore.com/foiegras/rougie-foie-gras.asp) and chilled it prior to use. And I used walnut oil instead of grapeseed oil. Loved it. This is definitely a fancy and pretty dish to be enjoyed with those who appreciate foie gras.

I don't see where it says to cook the foie gras. Am I missing something?
