So simple and scrumptious. This dip is really refreshing. It's is incredibly easy to make yet still seems impressive. I would certainly make it again.

Used the sauce on grilled pineapple and cantaloupe glazed with a molasses baste from another recipe on this site. Really liked the sauce - will make it for berries and granola for breakfast next time.

This is a great way to present fruit. I arranged the kebabs on a silver platter and garnished with mint leaves and the result was elegant. I gave the sauce a little extra kick with some orange zest and creme de menthe. I didn't quite achieve the result I wanted but I think it was because I was too heavy handed with the zest. A little goes a long way!

This is an adorable recipe that provides a nice alternative way to serve summer fruit. The sauce was delicious, as well.

The mint yogurt sauce was delicious. I actually just made a fruit salad and served the sauce as a topping.

The sauce was rather so-so. It just didn't pop. Hardly anyone ate it at the bridal shower where I served it. Perhaps a bit more sugar or a liquor would give it some depth. I think there are better fruit dip recipes out there.

Hosted a summertime kebab party to celebrate our great new grill/smoker. These fruit kababs were a cute and healthy end to a wonderful dinner. The yogurt vanilla and mint sauce is a wonderful complement to the tanginess of pineapple, strawberry and kiwi and the sweet juiciness of honeydew.

I made these for a birthday party that I catered. The fruit does not hold up well over-night. I would make again but allow enough time right before serving to cut and thread the fruit.

I made this for a fundraiser event that I catered. I couldn't find any fresh mint this time of year, so I oppted to use fresh lemon zest with the vanilla flavoring. I made 6 cups of the dip and used all of the zest from 2 lemons. I also put in some lemon concentrate to help thin the yogurt to the right consistency. It went over very well!
