I tried this twice, once with sea salt and once with kosher salt. The kosher salt worked better. My husband remarked that these were really ordinary and he was surprised that anyone even wrote a recipe for this. I thought they were ok, but I don't think I'll be making this again.

We love these -- next time I think I'll make a little garlic aoli on the side. The only problem I have (and it's not the recipe's fault) is that invariably I'm doing a main dish/roast in the oven that needs to be set at a much different temperature. I did what someone else suggested -- just made sure the potatoes got cooked, then cranked the temp up to 500 to get the puff at the end.

Delicious, easy, definitely a new staple. Didn't get 4 forks only cause no one else gave it rave reviews. Everyone ate 'em; just no comments. I used the garlic oil as suggested and I thought they were great!

These were delicious. However, mine did not puff up! I'm unsure of what I did wrong. Will try for puffi-ness next time.

Four forks because it's easy to prepare, impressive to serve, and delicious. I've made this recipe many times now and it never fails to get oohs and ahs, and its a snap. I've also used baking potatoes and they work. Just halve them on the narrow side so that they sit flesh up on the fat side. Cooking times can be adjusted. One thing to remember: don't be tempted to wipe off the salt and accumulated water they draw out [as I once did ]. This is what "puffs" them up like a souffle. Have fun!

Yummy. Good, easy method.

This one wowed me, and it was so easy. I will me making it again and again, with whatever creative variation strikes me. Pretty fool-proof. My oven was only at 400 degrees (for the other things I was making) so I just cooked them longer before cranking it up to 500. They turned out just fine, perfect actually.

My family loved this!! It is healthful too, with just a little (garlic) olive oil and salt--no butter, sour cream etc. Even my kids ate the potato skins on this one. :)

very easy and very yummy, almost better than a baked potato!

I gave this 4 stars because: 1. Its simple and very good 2. Easy to modify, a very good base recipe The second time I make them I used some roasted garlis olive oil(just oil that I had left over from another dish, 40 Cloves and a Chicken) and dish was even better. The whole family loves it.

This was darn good -- it gets four forks due to its simplicity. I used two medium-sized red russetts for two people, and the potatoes were creamy and well-cooked after 20 minutes in a 475 oven. I only needed about 3 minutes broiling on low (instead of 500 oven) to complete the browning. One thing-- the recipe says to oil the potatoes, then salt them; I salted the potatoes first, waited 10 minutes to draw out some water, then wiped the salt and water off the potatoes, since I'm not too fond of salt. Then I lightly oiled them and baked them. They came out perfectly salted. Also, be sure to use fresh potatoes -- I've found that older potatoes don't brown as well. Expect this to become an old standby in your house.

While this is not the type of potato to replace a croquette at a more formal affair,it is definitely a compliment to a more casual dinner. Served with grilled tarragon chicken and grilled asparagus with prosciutto is was a perfect compliment!
