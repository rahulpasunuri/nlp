While it's the wrong time of year for fresh corn and good asparagus, I made this last night with zucchini, scallions, peppers and portobellos. I also didn't have all the fresh herbs, so I used fresh cilantro and a few dried herbs. Really nice, fresh accompaniment to burgers!

Flavor was terrific. I roasted the veggies midday and left on counter. Great at room temp. Would have given it 4 forks if it was "prettier". Guests were surprised by the grilled endive and radiccio. Both added to the flavor.

I made this last night for friends and received over-the-top compliments on it. It is delicious and pretty. It was a perfect item for a warm July night.

This was delicious. Fresh, healthy, easy meal. I basically grilled everything (with the exception of the endive and radicchio) at the same time and the result was still fantastic. Didn't love the result of the grilled radicchio so ended up leaving it out. But all in all a really wonderful recipe. Loved the vinaigrette. Could go on tons of different salads.

I exchanged red peppers in place of the tomatoes, otherwise, beautiful presentation. The dressing was good, but the flavors of the grilled vegies were so fine on their own that I used about 1/8th of it. Next time, I will do a simple balsamic with olive oil.

Made it exactly according to the recipe. The Vinaigrette would also be great on any salad. Excellent, highly recommend.

The vinaigrette is also a fast way to dress up steamed veggies and fish. Can substitute other fresh herbs. I've used it with broccoli, potatoes, salmon.

This salad was colorful and delicious. The grilling really brought out the flavors in all the veggies. The dressing was so good, too. I will make this again and again to accompany many summertime meals.

Truly lovely! Be careful not to char anything or it gets too bitter, but otherwise I loved this!

We modified a little for a Thanksgiving side dish - skipped the radiccio and endive (feel it is bitter), and added more colors of peppers like the other reviewers. We broiled the vegies in batches (sprinkled with garlic infused olive oil) and broiled until the vegies blistered. I would try to grill next time, we couldn'tas our grill was in use with the turkey. If you make ahead, and are going to refrigerate, I would take the vegies off the grill while still fairly crisp. We made this ahead (4-6 hours)and kept dressing off until serving.The vegies kept their color and flavor, we let the dish get room temp before serving. A suggestion might be to serve dressing separate, as the vegies are great by themselves.

This is a great recipe. The drssing is delicious! My endive didn't grill nicely so I left it out. Added extra corn and asparagus. YUM!!

Did anyone make this ahead of time. Just wondering if it holds up and is as good.

My kids loved everything about this but the radiccio and endive, which they thought too bitter. We will make this again without these two ingredients or use salad greens as the Vancouver cook did.

This made way more than enough for 8 people. I loved this because it had big flavors. The grilling added a nice dimension to the vegetables. The vinaigrette had oomph and a lovely flavor. I served it as a composed salad, not chopped up. It was so pretty.

I made this for my children (2 and 7) so made a few changes. I substituted yellow pepper for the asparagus and served it on salad greens rather than grilling the radicchio and endive, and I cut the amount of oil in the vinaigrette down to 1/4 cup. The result was delicious and it was a healthy, kid-friendly meal that the adults enjoyed just as much as the kids. Will definitely make this again.
