We loved this recipe. I made a few subsitutions because of what I had on hand and it still turned out delicious. I used fried yellow onions (no raw), garlic salt, and no peanuts. This is an easy recipe. I'd like to try it as written too.

We are huge fans of Burmese food, and this one is spot on. I agree with the previous reviewer that if you don't like the ingredients in a recipe, you probably won't like the recipe. Fried shallots, ginger, and garlic (you can sometimes find these in packages in Asian markets, to save you time) are essential. I have also added fried favas, which give the dish a nutty taste. By the way, the dressing and all work well with just about any veggie combination - try broccoli, carrots, peppers, zucchini, etc. If you can't find the long beans, regular green beans will work, but do try the long beans!

This was WONDEFUL! I've been trying to expand my Asian cuisine repertoire and this recipe is a good addition. I made it exactly as indicated and the flavors were fantastic. The fried shallots are essential, as is fresh lime squeezed over top. A gentle suggestion: if you don't like the ingredients in a dish - you probably won't like the dish.

Colossal failures like this one raise a lot of maybes. Maybe it would have been better with long beans instead of regular old green beans. Maybe deep frying vs. stir frying the garlic & shallots makes a difference. Maybe I just don't like shallots. It's probably the latter. I've never cooked with them before, and picking them out of the salad made it marginally edible, though the peanuts and sesame seeds are also less than appealing. Whatever the reason, I will definitely not be trying again.
