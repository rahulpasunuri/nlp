Delicious. A bit sweet; next time I'll reduce the sugar by at least 1/4 cup. They spread a lot even if the dough is chilled, so separate them by more than 2". I made mine chewy and they were great, but next time I may try crispy (especially if I'm making them for an Xmas cookie exchange where soft ones would break apart and stick to other cookies). I second the suggestion to process the candied brittle less than suggested if you want something like the picture. I substituted macadamia nuts for about 1/2 cup of the almonds (the ones that get candied) and the balance was perfect. Finally, if you use 2 Tbsp of dough per cookies, you'll get about 3 dozen cookies, not 4 dozen.

These cookies were nice, although they really lacked almond flavor... which was hard to imagine with all the almonds in them. I think next time I will add 1/2 tsp of almond extract. They also lacked sweetness, even though there is a considerable amount of sugar in them, which would have been excellent if the almond flavor came through. The batter seemed runny, I thought I had perhaps forgotten an ingredient, but they came out perfectly once I got the cooking time right. I thought 14 minutes was far too much, 10 minutes was sufficient, or 12 for a crispy cookie.

It's like a sophisticated sugar cookie! A little time consuming, but well worth it. I made the cookie from the recipe verbatim without any tweaking and I was pleased with the results. One thing I noticed, though: if you want your cookies to look like the photograph, do not pulse the almond candy for very long at all, and use less than the prescribed 2 tablespoons when dropping the cookies.

Very good cookie but a bit on the sweet side and alot more work then a drop cookie.

Oh, my! These were delicious and LARGE! Definitely a few more steps than most drop cookies, but oh, so good! Now, what shall I do with the leftover egg yolks???

Made these as one of my 8 Christmas cookies this year. Cooked them 14-16 minutes and they came out wafer-thin and crispy. They were a favorite and several people asked for the recipe.

My new favorite cookie recipe. I didn't think it took particularly more work. Regardless, well worth the trouble.

Contrary to some of the other reviews, I thougbt these cookies were amazing. I was interested in reading about the "cake-like" texture that some experienced, because mine came out wafer-thin, crispy and delicately crunchy, which is why I liked them so much. I agree that these take a little extra work, but felt it was well worth it. These will be among my cookie repertoire from now on.

I expected more flavor. Tried both versions-soft and chewy (more cake like than chewy) and crunchy, but didn't care for either one. Maybe I did something wrong. Never the less, I probably will not try them again.

Very yummy. A little more work than I am used to, but worth it. I made them crunchy.

Pleasant enough.

Not wild about these. Possibly because I substituted the amaretto, since I didn't have any on hand, with almond extract. The cookies baked very nicely, I just wasn't wild about the taste for all the extra work that was involved.

I like a crunchier cookie and baked them 14-16 mins. They turned out great!. The toasted almond really comes through. I brought 2 of the 4 dozen to work and they were a hit.

We love almonds and I had to try this recipe. We were not disappointed - they're soft and chewy (if you bake them for 12 minutes) and have a nice pure almond flavor.

Good, but not great. I found that 14 minutes of bake time was too long. I baked for 12 minutes.

Truly....A Cookie beyond compare.

Let's just say that every time I make these (3 times since I got my issue) they never even make it to the cookie jar. I've made lots of cookie recipes but none that have been vacuumed up like these!
