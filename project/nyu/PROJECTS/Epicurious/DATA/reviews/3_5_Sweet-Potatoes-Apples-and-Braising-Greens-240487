Wonderfully tasty! As others suggested, I sauteed some shallots before wilting the spinach and the dish turned out amazing. By the way, I barely used 2 tsp of oil for the sweet potatoes, 1 tsp of butter for the apples and about 2 tsp of oil for the shallots and I found that this was plenty. Having said that, I think that the whole dish could be made without any added fat and the flavour would not suffer one bit.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner last night and it was delicious, so well received. Taking some ideas from other reviews, I cut the sweet potatoes into 3/4" cubes, cut the apples into narrow wedges, replaced some of the butter with olive oil when roasting the sweet potatoes, and added a little chicken stock to the greens. The greens were a combination of Trader Joe's kale and southern greens blend, which contains mustard, turnip and collard greens with spinach. I will definitely make this again.

Super good! Really easy, healthy--when you don't use butter to sauté everything. I used kale and tatsoi. The apple added a nice slightly sweet flavor. YUM.

So delicious! Very buttery - but mostly because I accidentally added way more butter than was called for. I highly recommend this dish. I made it with swiss chard.

This is my go-to staple side dish. We don't bother pealing the apples and it is still fine. I bring it to parties and it is always a hit!

I think the idea of this is more appealing than the actual dish itself. The sweet pot. & apples, delish but then the greens come along and it just doesn't quite work. I really wanted to like this. I kept tasting & tasting but I couldn't convince myself. My husband wasn't thrilled nor were my 10yr. old boys. (And they like pretty much eat everything) I do have to say that the colors of the dish are fabulous. They are bright & vibrant, very holiday-ish. 2 forks because of the creativity & uniqueness.

Delicious! Cooked the greens a little longer and prepared the sweet potatoes in advance.

Eh. I didn't like the soggy apples at all. If I ever make this again, I'll cut the apples into slivers and add them very late so they stay crisper.

I wish I had baking apples like granny smith, something that would stay a little bit crunchy after cooking. I had a lot of turnips so I added them for a little non-sweet quick. Definitely a recipe that is best day 1, but I liked this a lot. And very healthy (not heavy).

The harvest flavors, the bite of the greens and the sweetness of the apples and potatoes make for a savory meal or side dish. Added fresh thyme and a dash of red pepper flakes. Delicious!

A unique vegetable dish that looked and tasted great. I have chard growing in my garden, so I used that instead of kale, and it was the best recipe I've made so far using chard. The whole family enjoyed this quite a lot.

The original recipe uses too much cookware & butter. I put the sweet potatoes in a dutch oven with one-third of the butter on med-low heat. Five minutes later I added the apples, which I sliced into eighths. Five minutes later I added the kale. One pot, quick & low-fat.

I managed to cut almost almost all the fat from this recipe by judicious use of the microwave. First nuked the scallions, then mixed in some rather bland applesauce. Tasted and corrected at this point with balsamic vinaigre and brown sugar (good apples might not need this, but this is weeknight cookery). While I was doing this, and prepping the collards, the sweet potatoes had their turn in the microwave. Mixed the apple-scallion mix with the collards and nuked the result for about 5 min. Then folded in the cubed sweet potatoes. Tasted and realized it needed something and laced it generously with powdered garlic. Still thought it needed something, so I added half a jar of spiced pear compote that I'd put up a few weeks ago. Bingo! Just finished half the dish all by myself.

I used Swiss Chard and Cortland apples, cut the butter and salt down, and I didn't have any parsley on hand. I somewhat overcooked the apples. And despite all that, it was still delightful!

I made a half recipe of this and reduced the butter. I also coated the potatoes in olive oil instead of butter to use a healthier fat. And based on other reviews I cut the apples into cubes rather than slices. At the end I added about 1.5 tablespoons of balsamic to perk up the flavors a bit. I served this with a roasted pork loin and it went very well. Next time I will increase the amount of apple in the recipe.

This is so tasty and good - a great compliment to the pork roast I made. Family who said they wouldn't try had seconds. I suggest you watch the apples as I may have over cooked but it is a great dish and would multiply easily.

Very good and easy to make. Would make an excellent non-traditional side dish for a holiday meal.

I liked the combo of sweet potatoes, apples and greens. My complaint with this recipe is that the kale I had didn't get close to cooked enough in the time stated on the recipe. I ended up using a lot more water to steam the kale and cooking a lot longer, and it was still a little underdone. Also, I'm with the other reviews that the apples really are better cut into eighths or even smaller.

I made this with butternut squash instead of sweet potatoes. I didn't have parsley either. Results were pretty good, but not mind blowing: http://dinnerwithdavid.wordpress.com/2009/12/20/faux-vegetarian/

The flavors were good, but in general I found this way way too complicated for what it was, and also thought it used way too much butter. I cut the butter down by about 3 TBs, and next time would def leave the skins on the apples and sweet potatoes. I might also roast the sweet potatoes whole in the oven, then cut them up and cook them with the apples to save some time. The addition of a little vinegar and/or parmesan to this really helps it to feel like a full meal, not just a side dish.

Much better than I expected. Left out the parsley and topped the dish with shaved parmesan cheese. Next time, I might cut the apples smaller...into eighths instead of quarters.

In general, I followed the recipe and enjoyed it but made a few changes. I diced two large sweet potatoes instead of sliced them, and roasted them in about 2 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil and sea salt. While they roasted, I melted about a tablespoon of butter in a wok and cooked a massive apple, which I had diced, along with shallots, ginger and garlic, and added 1 t coriander toward the end. For the greens, I put a couple drops of oil in the (emptied) wok and added chopped swiss chard and a little water. After a couple minutes, I added a can of rinsed black beans, let the beans get warm and added the apples and potatoes and some ground pepper (much less than 2 t). Very delicious.

This tasted good, and my chard-hating husband actually liked it, but I won't make it again even though I make chard several times a week. It was too salty for my taste and used an immodest amount of butter. Just too rich.

Yummy combination for our fifth month of eating winter greens! I used a mixture of braising greens, and it was delicious.

This dish is deceptively simple ingredient-wise. It has a sophisticated balance of sweet and savory - the apple and sweet potato complementing the subtle kale. I loved it; it really creates a new flavour when combined that's like nothing else i've had. I did find 1/8 inch a bit thin for the potatoes which kind of fell apart, next time i'd do 1/4 inch.

Beautiful to look at and delicious to eat. I sauteed 2 tsp. of garlic with the chard. I have enjoyed the left overs.

This was a very pretty and tasty dish. The tartness of the apples contrasts nicely with the the earthiness of the sweet potatoes.

I had a buttercup squash from my CSA box, so I used that instead of the sweet potatoes. It was pretty dense, so I just added 4 cups of veggie stock and threw it in the blender. Put it back on the stove, added 1/2 teaspoon of sage and thyme, and it was a wonderful soup! Next time I might start it out as a soup and incorporate some coriander seeds and curry paste for a spicy result, but it was great the way it was.

Loved it! I had a bag of braising greens and a bag of arugula from my CSA box this week. They went great w/ the sweet potatoes and apples. This is a great fall/Thanksgiving dish. I used granny smith apples and cut them into eights instead of quarters - I think I will cut them and the sweet potatoes a little smaller next time.

This was surprisingly good - a great way to get the husband to eat kale. I added shallots and apple- chicken sausage to the apples. I only used a small pat of butter with the apples, and used canola oil elsewhere. I also chopped the apples into smaller bits - I don't know why they want you to use whole quartered apples.

This is really good! I made a few changes.... I served along side sausage stuffed pork chops, I made this in the same pan I browned the sausage and I added shallots as previous reviewers suggested. I also used chicken stock in place of water and instead of braising the kale separately I added it to the pan with everything else to wilt. This was a different and healthy side dish I will make again for sure! Made a tasty and low carb meal. :)

I took the advice of earlier reviewers and cooked 2 large shallots with the apples (which I cut into smaller pieces than quarters). For the greens I used kale. Otherwise I prepared as directed. All 6 people at the dinner party had seconds. I'll definitely make this again.

This recipe looked beautiful, and tasted unique. After reading the reviews I sautéed some shallot in the butter before adding the apples. I used kale as the green, and the bitterness of the kale created an important contrast with the sweetness of the rest of the dish. I'm always looking for a tasty way to prepare kale as it is so good for you. This is the best recipe I've found so far.

This recipe needs something. Next time I'm going to try sauteing a little chopped shallots and garlic in some bacon drippings and then stir in the greens before braising. I may try the other reviewer's idea of goat cheese sometime too. But that said, this is a very tasty dish. As with the other recipes in this menu, though, the instructions leave something to be desired. First, the sweet potatoes need to be turned a few times while roasting or they don't carmelize evenly. Second, the apples are really too chunky just quartered, unless you have very small ones. Use your judgment on the size of the slices. Still, a very tasty dish and a nice yet unusual combination of flavors and textures.

Is something missing from this recipe? I made this for Thanksgiving, with Swiss chard & granny smiths. It was interesting, but something seemed to be lacking. My fellow diners and I agreed that it could go either sweet (with just a dash of brown sugar or maple syrup) or savory, with lots of garlic or something lively to give it a little pick-me-up.

oh golly, this was delicious! I made it for Thanksgiving and I was very pleased. Everyone commented that usually the vegetable dish gets overlooked and forgotten on Thanksgiving, but that they wanted seconds of this dish. I used Rainbow Chard as my greens and Arkansas Black apples (which are dense and tart). At the last step of the recipe, as I was stirring it all together over low heat, I added about 3 ounces of goat cheese sliced into medium-sized half coin shapes. This addition was fantastic and got comments from all. I'll defiately make this again and again.
