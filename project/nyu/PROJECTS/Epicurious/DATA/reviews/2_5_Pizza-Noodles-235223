What a great quick alternative to lasagna. I happened to have some leftover meatloaf so I put thin slices of it on top of the noddles before the mozzerella. I used Classico brand Tomato Basil sauce and added in extra fresh basil, chopped fine.

Pizza Noodles? I call it another recipe for "Baked Ziti" (if you use ziti) There are many better recipes for a baked pasta dish. Don't waste your time with this one.
