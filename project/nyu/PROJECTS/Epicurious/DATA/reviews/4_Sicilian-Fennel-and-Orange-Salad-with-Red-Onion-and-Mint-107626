Loved this! Used a mandoline for super thin sliced fennel and onions. Soaked onion in OJ per suggestions. Served small quantities in big white bowls and it was absolutely beautiful. I would not change a thing. But, we did have just a bit left over and put it on top of arugula the next night. Worked great.

Wonderful refreshing salad, very quick and easy. Definitely a keeper. Next time I'll use a little less red onion, even though I soaked the onions in OJ I think the flavor over powered the fennel. I omitted the olives, but don't think they were missed. I served the salad as a side for CL recipe Shrimp & Goat Cheese Risotto (very good).

A crisp, light salad, perfect after a hearty soup and bread meal. Thanks to those who suggested soaking the onion in the orange juice; definitely took away any harshness. I thought the salty olives counterbalanced the sweetness of the orange and fennel and really brought this salad to life.

I have also made this with blood oranges, which I think makes the recipe even more interesting.

I made this for a brunch with a little adjustments. I skipped the olives and added thinly sliced cucumbers. Next time I will double the amount of oranges and try another cooks advice on soaking the onions in orange juice, as I found the red onion I used was way too intense. Nevertheless, this was a great recipe and interesting combination of flavors. Will make again.

I made this with blood oranges and skipped the olives, as I saw chef Marc Thuet make something similar at a recent cooking demonstration. I also macerated the onions in juice from the (blood) orange ahead of time, as it takes the sharpness away from the raw onions. Soaking raw onions in vinegar or juice is a lesson I got from a Chez Panisee cookbook. It makes a nice difference (to me) as I find raw onions too strong, and they upset my stomach, too. Macerating them sort of "cooks" them, I guess.

Loved this salad however it needs to be handled carefully because the fennel is hearty and the oranges are delicate. Next time I will assemble with some oranges so flavors blend then add remainder once it is plated. Needed more oranges and sectioning takes time! Oil-cured olives are salty so omitting additional salt is OK.

I made this for an Italian themed pot luck. It was delicious and refreshing (and I'm not even that fond of fennel!) I did use basil instead of mint. I'l make it again to go with salmon or chicken on the grill.

When I had this dish in Sicilia, they used basil instead of mint, which I think is better. (They would often also add fish, which I think is definitely *not* better!) Mine doesn't come out as tasty, but I think it's because my grocery-store fennel is pretty sad -- not to mention expensive. It's no wonder people are hesitant to try some of the more unusual produce given the high prices and low quality I see in my local grocery. But this dish could make a fennel-lover out of anyone!

Had a wonderful fennel and orange salad at a restaurant recently. I was hoping this might duplicate it. Alas it did not. Close but no cigar.

This was a beautiful, simple salad requiring no work but VERY fresh ingredients, exceptional extra virgin olive oil, and a little course sea salt to perk it up a bit, I used some orange mint the second time I made it, and it was even better.

I thought this was a very interesting blend of flavors! I might add some more oranges next time. Fresh mint is a must, though I julienned it to allow it to disburse more evenly throughout the salad. I also let it sit (not by choice) and the flavors seemed to combine a bit. Don't think it hurt though.

My boyfriend gave this 3 forks; I would have given 2. I thought this was simple to prepare and rather pretty. Had to use dried mint.Thanks so much to all the reviewers; I always learn from you and your thoughts influence whether I will try a recipe or not.

Delicious and refreshing, before, with, or after the main course. Added sliced cucumber, just to make it go further, and it was a lovely addition. (The Sicilians make an orange-cucumber salad with mint, so I knew it would be compatible.) Followed it with Oven-Braised Beef with Tomato Sauce and Garlic, accompanied by orzo. A good way to chase away the winter blues.

I really liked this salad and will make it again. It is a refreshing mix of ingredients that go well together. Next time I'd use less onion though.

I know that northern Italian cuisine is considered "in vogue" by some Americans, but this dish is another example of the genius of regional, southern Italian cuisine: using simple, but freshest quality ingredients and marrying them into unbelievable tastes.

A very refreshing salad and easy to make! I served it as a side dish with a hot and spicy sausage - it was great.
