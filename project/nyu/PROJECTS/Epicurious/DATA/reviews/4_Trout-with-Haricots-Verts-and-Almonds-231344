Simply delicious. I have made this a few times for friends and everyone is very impressed. I would like to know how Thomas Keller filleted the fish.

Excellent recipe. Will make this again for sure. The method of cooking the fish augments the flavors of the fish without covering it up. The haricots verts are amazing.

I have had this at the restaurant, and it was amazing. Made it at home without the haricot verts, with raw unblanched chopped almonds, and also forgetting the lemon juice. Reduced butter by a tiny bit. Still amazing. This cooking method really produces an absolutely perfectly cooked, just done fish. I was concerned about cutting "belly flaps" etc., but it was very easy to trim the trout as described--it will all make sense when you actually have the gutted and boned whole trout in front of you, and all you need is a pair of scissors.

This was delicious. My only adjustment was regular pepper instead of white pepper, but I ended up wanting more beans and more lemon juice. I suggest following the recipe but then serving with lemon wedges. This is a recipe worthy of a dinner party.

Wonderful recipe. Everybody was hungry, so I did it old mom's style with everything on the table before serving. I needed 6 whole fish and used fried potato halfs with skin for the side, for a total of 5 people. Had to make the texture of the potato just more consistent than the fish and yet softer than the haricots verts to make it blend with the dish - fried with olive oil and capers for the taste, added milk for the softness and some cherry tomatoes for the moist. Everyone loved it! The best fish we had in months!!

We changed a couple of things: skipped the beans and added cherry tomatoes and chives. DEELISH! Also,we simplified things by using trout filets.

One of my favorite recipes - such an elegant presentation, and absolutely delicious and satisfying. I just love the buttery crisp beans with the crunchy almonds. I make this with tilapia, trout or any white fish filets and it is a easy enough for a weeknight but special enough for guests.

I find it is much easier to cook the trout whole and eat around the bones. I wouldn't do them whole for a dinner party, but for a regular meal, it makes for a fast and simple but delicious dinner.

The presentation is what impressed me most about the dish. The satisfying mix of fish, butter and lemon would be thoroughly enjoyable, if not for all the hard-to-remove bones.

This was a wonderful dish. I was unable to find fresh trout so I substitued tilapia. I think any white fish would work.

Cutting off fins, and removing "gill plates," etc. was a real challenge! I had to go to the Silver Palate New Basics cookbook for help in figuring out the directions in this recipe for preparing -- or pan dressing -- the trout. But it was a successful adventure, and the dish is light and healthy and very good.

Outstanding!

PS -- Using pre-sliced almonds worked well. I did not blanch them but there was no hint of bitterness.

This trout dish was very simple to prepare, delicious, and inexpensive! I dislike trout because it is often tasteless, "muddy," or bland in texture, but the combination of the nutty almonds and butter with the fish's moistness and the haricot verts' crispness turned this into a new weeknight favorite. Per Mr. Keller's note, the fish should not be fully cooked when removed from the pan. We had some difficulty figuring out how to cut the trout (should it be butterflied?) but realized that it should open up like a cupboard with two doors hinged to a central "back" piece, which rests on the spine. C'est magnifique!

I haven't tried to make this dish but I did have it for dinner last week in Las Vegas at Bouchon. It was delicious! I will definitely try it after the holidays
