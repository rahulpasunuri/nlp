Doubled the garlic, useds crushed dried oregano which may have upped the quantity a lot, added celery for texture. This recipe ROCKS. Anyone who said it was bland probably seasons by measurement and not by taste. HUGE hit with kids and with my vegetarian husband. This will be a weekly staple for winter!

I used this recipe, with just a few small modifications, and it really turned out quite delicious! I omitted the parsley because we had none, and I used a 26 oz. package of Pomi chopped tomatoes (liquid included). In addition, I minced up some carrot and celery, leaving some bigger pieces for texture later, and sauteed that with the garlic before adding the tomatoes. I also added a generous portion of fresh, chopped rosemary and a different pasta, which I added to the soup dry near the end of cooking. The result came out more like a minestrone, but man, it was so flavorful and yummy!

This was really just okay at best. I wasn't impressed. Pasta Fagioli is something I thought that was more like a soup! Honestly, if I had knew how this turned out, I rather had just reheated some marinara sauce from a jar.

This is a great meatless recipe. I found it easy to prepare and my guests loved it. I tripled the amount of garlic for a full flavor.

With a few modifications this is a fabulous dish: double the tomatoes and don't drain them, increase the garlic, add some red onion & kalamata olives, and a splash of balsamic vinegar. Super quick & easy.

This was a delicious recipe, however I wanted more flavor so I fried up some pancetta and prociutto, and added fresh basil and spinach which I chopped in a blender with olive oil. I omitted the tomatoes.

Add 1 lb bronwed ground beef...it's great!

In agreement with others, this dish benefits from extra herbs & parmesan and the addition of broth (we added chicken broth). The sauce base is wonderful and could be served with shrimp or clams. Serve with foccaccia and olive oil.

Fantastic! I too was very generous with the herbs, didn't drain the tomatoes and added extra beef broth. It was so easy to make - I was overdue with baby #2 when I made this last month and didn't have a problem being on my feet long enough to get it on the table, and it tasted like it came from a restaurant. Yum!!!!

almost 4 forks....i love this receipe because it's yum and so easy (I like NY's comment that "it's earthy, made-on-the-cheap;" right on! i have made it many times & keep forgetting that it needs extra broth and/or water (i don't draink the tomatoes). eating it immediately, it's a yummy thick soup but then after it sits just a few minutes, it ends up chili-ish or almost just a pasta dish. i still love it!

Add about 16 oz of water. And don't pour sauce over pasta till your are just about ready to sever.

Always add crushed red pepper to make this dish a little spicy. Also, if you're interested in making a thicker soup, let the pot rest off the heat for 20 minutes. This allows the sauce to thicken. You can also added less pasta and use ditalini instead of elbows to make the soup thicker. These changes make this dish truly Italian, like what my gradmother used to make!

Make sure to serve the soup over the pasta (or the pasta soaks up all of the liquid). Also, this is one of few italian dishes that does not need garlic.

Easy enough, but to no surprise, very dry, especially the beans. I suppose if one is looking for a SOUP recipe look up the other Pasta e Fagioli recipe on this website (this is a dry pasta recipe, by no means a soup). I make a Pasta and White bean soup that I like very much. Here's the link: http://recipecircus.com/recipes/Catgurrl/Vegetarian/White_Bean__Pasta_Soup_with_Rosemary.html It's from a GREAT cookbook titled, "The Complete Italian Vegetarian".

This is a pretty wholesome meal, but that's about all it has going for it. I found it very dry and non-soupy, as others commented, and there isn't a heck of a lot of flavor. I made a big pot of it for my book club, and while no one seemed to mind eating it, I don't think anyone will miss it if I never make it again.

I took spicy turkey italian sausages out of casing, browned, and added to the recipe toward end and it was a delicious addition. It is very thick, but I think it is good that way-like a thick chili.

8 oz. of elbows is way too much, I use about 4 oz of ditalini. I also used a 32 oz. can of tomatoes as I felt the 15 oz was not enough. Also use more oregano and added the basil the last 5 minutes of cooking time so it wouldn't lose it's flavor. Occassionally I will also add a can of garbanzo beans to the pot in addition to the cannellini.

This has become a staple meal. Only variations I make are using dried parsley (because it's on hand), using an UNDRAINED can of diced tomatoes and adding some cooked broccoli. The sauce is done before the water boils and the pasta is cooked. Excellent.

Excellent flavor but MUCH too dry and starchy. I was expecting more of a soup and it turned out to be a hot pasta salad. Was adding cans of diced tomatoes and tomato juice at the end of the cooking process to try to make it into a soup. Will make it again but this recipe requires much more liquid and less pasta. Also sauted a small onion with the garlic and a healthy dose of good olive oil to the tomato mixture - added more flavor.

Excellent! It's a pleasure to make something delicious from stuff you have in your fridge and cupboard. I used excellent-quality Italian canned tomatoes (drained for the drinkable juice)and found this dish very attractive to look at while cooking in the skillet -- brilliant colors, and not soupy at all. It's earthy, eat-on-the-cheap food...the beans lend the impression of meat amidst the macaroni (which I paired with mini ziti cause that's what I had on the shelf). My husband immediately went back for seconds, and the leftovers were just as good as on the first night. Definitely a keeper.

My husband and I love this recipe!!! I'm Italian, and am always looking for great Italian recipes, and this one is close to the top of my list!

First, this dish made way more than the # of servings indicated. Second, putting everything into the bowl with the pasta made the whole dish cool down too quickly.

My original pasta e fagioli came from Bon Apetit in the 80's. It's faded out now but it's still the best around. I recently tried this one with the canned beans (didn't want to stay home for the fresh beans to cook). It wasn't as tasty putting the ingredients together so quickly. I think the slow method brings out more flavor. I use tomato paste instead of plum tomatoes. If you can find a reprint of the original one from 1982-85 try.

My husband didn't mind it but I put it down and opted for a bowl of cereal. There are better pasta recipes out there.

This dish got a unanimous thumbs-down when I served it to my husband and 7 yr old daughter. Too much starch. Not distinctive in any way, boring.

My husband loved this soup, and it was very easy to make. I used diced tomatoes w/their juice instead of the plum, otherwise it seemed like there would not be enough liquid. If you have leftovers you will have to add additional liquid the next day cuz the beans absorb it all. Instead of doing this we just used as a topping for pasta the next day and it was great.

Very good! Excellent for a busy day. Not difficult to make and my children liked it.

I substituted 2 cans of 14 oz diced tomatoes with juice instead of the plum tomatoes to give it a more tomato flavor. I also added some cayenne pepper to give it some pizzaz. You will have to add quite a bit of salt to give the dish some flavor (and I am not a salt lover.)

"Bis, bis!" This zuppa got rave reviews from my family tonight. I liked the cook from Lawrenceville's idea so added beef broth to mine, as well--e' perfetto! Recipe doubles well, BTW. Will definitely be enjoying this one throughout the winter months.

We love this with a salad and some good Italian bread. It's a great quick and easy dinner favorite at our house!

The combination of herbs is good, but it was too dry for my taste;not enough tomato sauce. I think I will use lentils next time, maybe with some spinach thrown in too.

The best Pasta E Fagioli I ever had! I included beef broth in order to get a soupier texture.

Very homey, comfort food. Great for kids. Try this with lentils for a change. Serve with a big salad and some hot crusty bread.
