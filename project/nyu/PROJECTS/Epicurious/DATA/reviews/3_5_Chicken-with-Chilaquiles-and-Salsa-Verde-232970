This recipe is kind of stupidly delicious for how basic and simple it is. I'm going to keep the ingredients on hand all the time for when I need a quick meal. I agree with the earlier poster who said not to add salt. If you use salted chips the recipe is plenty salty (though not overly so). It also makes good leftovers (I'm eating it for lunch as I write).

OK. Hubs said it's like a chopped up enchilada. I agree, & will make enchilada instead next time.

I love this recipe. This is a simple and fast dinner for company and every time I serve it, it gets rave reviews and recipe requests. One thing that makes this even better is squeezing a fresh lime and adding a pinch of salt to the sour cream sauce. You'll use less milk to get the right consistency, but the tang is wonderful.

This was fabulous! I used some homemade green salsa I bought at the farmer's market and I used a mix of salted and unsalted chips.

A co-worker brought this dish to a company pot-luck lunch. I had two helpings and insisted on the recipe. One reviewer said the dish's appearance made it difficult for his/her family to eat. That's just silly!

I made this as a half recipe, supposedly 2-4 portions. I ended up eating all of it myself because it was so delicious! It was incredibly quick to make, and would be a good last minute party dish. If I wanted to make it more healthy, I might try baked/fresh corn tortillas. You could even do this with leftover chicken from another meal, as it is shredded. However, like some other reviewers mentioned, I would suggest not salting the dish. The tortilla chips are already super spicy, so it can be a bit of salt overload. Will definitely make again, but be sure to make alot!

The last review said it all...so fast and easy! Used cilantro, tomato and avacado for garnish. I also used a mixture of cotija and pepper jack cheese..probably doubled the amount and added half to the pot and half for garnish. We are planning to re-heat in the morning and add a fried egg!

OMG - this is outstanding. Just a little prep work and the dinner is served in under 10 minutes. I used Mrs. Renfro's Salsa Verde and garnished with fresh cilantro, tomato and avocado and it was a 4 star dinner. Definitely add a little more broth and DO NOT salt the recipe. As far as presentation - it is all in the plating. As is is no big deal - but garnish with the above items and it is a masterpiece. Definitly keeping this recipe!

Excellent Recipe, adding fresh sliced onions on top makes the recipe 10/10!

Super easy and tasty. I found it to be a little salty, so I agree with a previous reviewer, skip the salt-- there is enough on the chips already. I used a tall pot and I was a little difficult to stir the chips in. Still turned out great. Next time, though, I will use a wider pot.

This works just as well with your favorite red jarred salsa! Can't get fresh cilantro easily, so I add dried with the pepper. Unless I use homemade stock, I skip the salt.

I certainly had my doubts while stirring the chips into greenish mush, but this recipe was simply delicious. I made it for myself, my boyfriend and a friend, and both thought it was fabulous. Since I had only one chicken breast on hand, I used that and a can of black beans for protein (could've used 2 cans probably), and I found that I had to add the entire 17 oz. jar of Goya salsa verde (which was totally sufficient, no fancy salsa needed) and more like 2 cups of chicken stock (rather than broth; it added more flavor). My friend commented that the many subtle flavors melded perfectly to give one intense but clean one. I agree, but I would caution everybody to do as I did and eschew the added salt: With feta, chicken stock (or even reduced-sodium broth) and jarred salsa, you really don't need any. You do, however, need all the garnishes listed, I think. I will definitely be making this again with stale chip leftovers and perhaps with more veggies, and even my cooking-inept boyfriend could probably handle throwing it together.

This is a delicious and easy meal. While not as good as the slow version it comes pretty darn close and I will definitely make it again. I wouldn't be ashamed to make it for my mexican family members...

This was terrific! I wouldn't layer the chips, though. The chips cooked with the sauce takes on something like a polenta texture. You would be missing out on that! Various cheeses would work well. This recipe is very easy and tasty the way it is written. I have made this a few times and used whatever cheese I had. Adding some diced tomato or salsa does give it some needed color.

This recipe was ok, especially considering it is meant to be a "quick fix", but was not anything I would make again. I would, however, use the ingredients and create something similar. I followed a previous review and put all the chips on the bottom and then layered everything on top. The idea was good, but the chips were still crunchy after cooking so I think I would replace them with corn tortillas. I like the layering since it is faster than rolling the chicken in the tortillas. The feta was fine, but many cheeses would be ok here as well.

This was fine, But nothing to write home about.Instead of a rotisserie chicken, I cooked some chicken thighs, and used the broth I cooked them in for the canned stuff.The texture was good on the finished product, although we found the tortilla chips to be pretty salty in there.I did use Mexican Cotija cheese instead of the feta, which I think is a much better cheese to use for this recipe.(why use a Greek cheese in a Mexican recipe??)Cotija cheese has a similar appearance to feta, and a nice tang to it.The fresh cilantro on top is a nice contrast, and I added some chopped fresh tomato on top too, for extra color and texture contrast, as well as flavor.It's a good family weeknight meal, but I think I'd use plain corn tortillas instead of the salty chips.

This was easy enough to make put I was extremely disapointed with the texture - very mushy!! I won't be making this one again.

Simply delightful. And delightfully simple. Even though I baked chicken thighs rather than using a rotisserie chicken, this came together in no time at all. It tasted even better on day two and three. I felt a bit guilty using an entire bag of chips, but at least I picked some locally made ones that were fried in safflower oil. Will definitely make this one again and again!

I've made this twice so far using the suggestion of A Cook from Chicago and it was a big hit at my house. Maybe someday I'll try the original prep instructions. In thia baked version it is a little more like chicken enchiladas than the chilaquiles I've eaten in Mexico, but so simple and tasty. All it needs is a little avacado& tomato and some refried beans on the side. Add a fried egg and breakfast just doesn't get any better

This was good - and easy - but here is how I made it and it seemed a little easier still... I spread the chips in the bottom of a casserole dish and pushed them down a little to even out the layer and crunch them some, I spread the shredded chicken over the chips, dotted it with sour cream mixture, poured the sauce over it and covered with Chihuahua cheese about 2 cups shredded. Baked it at 400 for about 15 - 20 min until top was golden brown and bubbly. Let it sit for 5 min before cutting up like a mexican lasagne with sprinkled cilantro on top - served with extra sour cream on the side and chopped avocados and tomato. We loved it - it will be a staple from now on and a great way to use up old chips - I'll never throw them away again!

This dish is super easy (ready in minutes) and very flavorful. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly and it was excellent. Tonight I was out of chicken broth so I used beef, and it turned out just as good. I use rotisserie chicken. I don't thin the sour cream because it's unnecessary. Hubby loves this one!

This is one of my favorite recipes. epicurious should also post the Chilaquiles recipe with eggs "for breakfast". It's also very good. Same recipe but eggs instead of chicken and no chicken broth.

I must admit that, although I am a frequent visitor to Epicurious, I don't post reviews of recipes very often. I feel compelled to review this one, however, because it is so surprising and brilliant. I probably would not have tried it in the first place were it not for the recipe's "trust us on this one" header note. That, and the fact that I happened to have a bunch of stale chips and chip crumbs laying around my kitchen. Which brings me to my first point -- this recipe gets one fork simply for the ease and moreover the economy of it, as it's a great way to use up those stale chips and crumbs at the bottom of the bag. Just save them until you have enough for the recipe. And three more forks for flavor -- it's akin to green chicken enchiladas, just deconstructed. I've made this several times now, using different brands of salsas and types of cheeses. Our favorite is Safeway brand salsa verde (a product I don't really enjoy on its own, but for some reason it brings out the best flavor in this dish). And, we prefer a good Monterey Jack to Feta. Also, I usually poach chicken breasts in a sort of court bouillon for this, but purchased rotisserie or leftover cooked chicken is also great. In the end, this is just easy and delicious comfort food. Try it!

I couldn't imagine how this would turn out when I read the recipe, but I was looking for something easy to do with leftover cooked chicken breasts so I decided to give this a whirl. It's nothing amazing, but for sheer ease of preparation it warrants three stars. This is quite literally the easiest thing I've ever made - crushing some chips and chopping a little cilantro were the only tasks required! I followed the times indicated in the recipe exactly, and when I poured the chicken / tortilla mixture into the platter it was still rather soupy, and I wasn't sure how to serve it. But by the time it made it to the table the tortillas had soaked up the extra liquid, giving the dish an appearance / consistency sort of like deconstructed enchiladas. Next time I would use a bit more feta and cilantro, to punch it up a little more. I wouldn't sub a milder cheese because for a dish that's mostly made up of mild chicken and soupy tortilla chips, it's good to have that zing. Also, I used the Frontera tomatilla salsa and the black pepper indicated, and it was quite spicy as it was - no need to boost the heat unless you're a real fire eater. This will go into the occasional rotation when I need to do something easy, and I mean easy!, with leftover chicken.

After reading the reviews of this recipe I decided to follow it and resist the urge to change it a bit. We loved it, keep extra chicken stock handy so that you can add a little more if needed, it doesn't take long for the chips to soften be ready to serve immediately. I did add fresh jalapenos with the cilantro and feta.. The Feta makes this dish, resist the desire to try a more "mexican" cheese. Easy and good for an informal gathering..

Either I screwed the recipe up, or my tastebuds aren't the same as the other reviewers. But I can honestly say that I will never make this again. I wouldn't even make it again for my dog! It was terrible. I may have let the chips cook too long, but I doubt if I made it drier it would have made any difference. Three bites and I threw the whole mess out. YUCK!!!

We;ve made it three times so far. For the chips we've settled on a low-fat brand with good corn flavor. Any kind of salsa verde works well. I added a bit more broth last time and fewer chips so that the consistency was a little soupier. Otherwise we make it as written. I don't know that it is a "dish beyond compare" but it sure is delicious.

A Mexican breakfast classic, try it with fried eggs on top or scambled instead of chicken. Also red sauce with some chipotle chile gives it a nice twist if you tire from the green.

I had leftover chicken, homemade chicken soup, salsa verde and tortilla chips at home. I didn't have feta or cilantro. But I improvised with monterey jack and it was wonderful. Even my domestic partner, who is usually rather picky, raved about it, and I got my almost five year old son to taste it and say he would eat it for dinner. And I loved it.
