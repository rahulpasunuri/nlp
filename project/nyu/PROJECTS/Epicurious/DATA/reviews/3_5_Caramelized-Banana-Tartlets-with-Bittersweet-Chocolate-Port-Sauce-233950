yummy. used slightly smaller tart pans and only baked for 20 minutes - right call. also, makes way too much chocolate sauce - not that it won't be delish on leftover vanilla ice cream!

The crust and sauce are wonderful, but not in this recipe. Try them without the banana: make the crust into cookies, serve with ice cream topped with the port sauce.

The banana part was tricky (use very green ones), but the end result was outstanding. With each bite I said, "$9.95 dessert". It was decadent and a keeper.

I made this for Easter and it was delicious! I didn't have hazelnuts, so I used walnuts and instead of making individual tarlets, I used a 10 in. tart pan with removable bottom and it turned out fine. I did use 1 1/2 times of the bananna filling. The chocolate I could have done without, definitely made more than what was needed for the dessert. I will definitely make it again.

The crust was very tasty but too crisp for my liking. The sauce was good but unless you want leftovers only about 1/3 of the recipe was necessary. I also found the cooking time too long - I had to lower the heat, shorten the cooking time and cover with tinfoil.

Not a crazy fan of banana but this is delicious.

This was a great recipe! The port sauce is the perfect finish!
