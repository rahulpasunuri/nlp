Great simple recipe that you can get right the first time you make it. Served it with grilled corn on the cob...the smoky crunch was amazing with the soft creamy fish. Paired this fab easy meal with a Picpoul de Pinet wine from Languedoc. Amazing

My partner and I used fresh Spanish mackerel fillets, bought that morning from our local farmers market. If you've ever eaten or cooked with mackerel, you know that it is best used that day. We substituted French gray shallots for chives. And we used 3/4-inch-thick slices of tomato that the recipe online states, although the original magazine recipe calls for 1/8-in-thick slices. The thick skin of the mackerel melts right into the flesh, making it creamy and unctuous. This is our new favorite mackerel dish. We served it with sides of Roasted Carrots (Gourmet Dec. 2008) and Mashed Cranberry Beans with olive oil lemon juice, dried parsley, and garlic. They all paired beautifully with our Tarragon Sour (3 ounces tarragon-infused vodka, 1/4 ounce lemon juice, 1/4 ounce lime juice, 1/2 ounce simple syrup, shake in ice and serve in chilled cocktail glass (serves 1 or 2)). www.CocktailBuzz.com

OOOH SOOO GOOOD. This is so light and mild, it could be used on any fish.

We used mackerel and the result was excellent. I used about half as much mayo and was more liberal with the quantity of herbs. Keeper!

Added a tablespoon of dijon mustard and a bit of tarragon, subbed shallots for chives. Success.

I've never had bluefish before, so it's difficult to tell if I didn't like the receipe or if I'm just not fond of the fish. The result tasted a bit like the Tuna Helper my mom used to make--a salty/mayonaissy concotion with little texture. The chives were great, and, were I to try the treatment on another type of fish, I might increase the herb portions.

We were lucky enough to have fresh Cape Cod bluefish, a favorite of mine. I added some dijon mustard to the sauce which gave it just the kick I think it needed. With beautiful, ripe garden tomatoes, it made a lovely meal.

I made this using a gas grill rather than the broiler in order not to heat up the kitchen in July. The result was just as good as the other reviewers say. I put the fish skin- side down on foil, and brought the sides of the foil up to contain the sauce and juices but did NOT tent fully. I cooked on a medium-high flame with the grill lid closed, registering about 550 degrees (if one trusts the grill thermometer) for 16-17 minutes. The fish was moist and flavorful, and even cooked evenly from the thick end to the thin. It was a big hit with the entire family, including my teenagers who eat fish but who can be "stand-offish" about new dishes.

Very tasty. Made a bit extra herb mix as I had many small fillets (the big blues aren't in yet). Served with simple grilled squash. Everyone enjoyed it.

made this with salmon and it was wonderful.

I thought this was good and very easy,and the fish was moist and flavorful; the oily, fishy quality people don't like was not present. My fiance, who hates bluefish, loved it. I grew up on Long Island, where bluefish is caught, and I'm hard to please; I felt that the recipe lacked a little something and will most likely vary the mayo mixture next time.

Excellent! I used frozen Boston Blue Fish fillets. Once thawed, I simply cut the "bar" of fish into 3 equal sections with each serving being about an inch thick and 3 inches in length. And instead of tomato slices I scooped a few tablespoons of mild, chunky salsa on top of each fish. A really big hit. Very flavourful and very easy to make.

Not just palatable...this was delicious with fresh CT bluefish and very ripe tomatoes this weekend. We followed the recipe exactly, except we grilled ~1 inch thick fillets on high, direct heat for 7 minutes over foil. Normally we are not thrilled with bluefish. This was so good, the guys went out to catch more the next morning!

Fantastic recipe. . I used frozen bluefish fillets instead of fresh. I cooked them straight from frozen in a deep baking dish, 30-40 min at 400... it was fantastic, it made a nice sauce that I mixed with some carrots and potatoes. definetly a fav!

I have never before found a recipe that made bluefish palatable. This is one to keep. Made it exactly as called for and the fish was tender and delicious. Now my husband doesn't have to throw back the bluefish he catches!

As a very simple recipe, this bluefish was surpirsingly delicious. The other reviewers are correct in saying that it is versatile, that it could be used to prepare many different kinds of fish. In fact, I think it would be excellent on grilled salmon. For this recipe I used Boston Bluefish, and though it was, I admit, frozen, it was still absolutely mouthwatering. Needlesstosay, I wouldn't change a thing.

This delicious recipe has had my guests oohing and ahing on several occasions. It is with joy that I revisit it this year.

It's true--bluefish is more of an East Coast thing. I used sablefish (aka black cod) and it turned out moist and delicious. Might try it with halibut next time.

Bluefish is tricky. This is by far the best bluefish recipe I have ever tried! The tomato really compliments the natural flavors of the fish.

I made this over the weekend with fresh bluefish. I followed the recipe pretty closely. It was excellent. Sometimes bluefish can be 'oily' or 'fishy' but not with this recipe. I don't think I would use the same recipe for a lighter fish, but while the blues are running, this is a terrific recipe. (I might try it on the grill next time!)

We use this type of sauce on all kinds of fresh gulf fish. Always with great results. Usually with citrus slices. Haven't tried it with the tomato, but I will. PS. East Coast Blues are delicious if you bake them whole.

Bluefish are plentiful on the east coast. My poor husband continuously goes fishing for striped bass and can only catch bluefish after bluefish. He will not bring them home and refuses to eat them because it is an "oily" fish, and therefore is an acquired taste for some people.
