I added 1/2 can of canned artichokes (packed in water) and left out the 1/2 cup of oil. The feta that was stirred into the sauce melted in to create a nice creamy sauce. The recipe didn't call for salt and pepper, but I did add a little seasoning. My husband said yum. This is a good vegetarian pasta dish.

I want to make this recipe, but it appears to be missing an ingredient. The preparation says to add the tomato puree, but there isn't tomato puree in the ingredient list??

It was good. Not great, but good. I chose not to add the olives because I'm not a huge fan of them, and I think this contributed to a lack of saltiness. I added extra salt and pepper, along with a generous helping of feta, but it still lacked something. If I were to try this again, I might add sweet Italian sausage and maybe some Parmesan or Pecorino Romano. Otherwise a perfectly tasty dish.

Could not be easier, and so good. I added capers because they were there, and decreased the feta.

This recipe has become the most requested dish at our house. I top it with sliced grilled ribeye. I too add the olives last.

We enjoyed this very much and will make it again. Followed recipe exactly except used only 1/4 cup oil.

Fast, easy and tasty - this is a great weeknight recipe, and satisfying even for non-vegetarians. I, too, used canned whole tomatoes, and the to-die-for Israeli feta from our local Trader Joe's. Makes a lovely creamy sauce that's even good as leftovers.

I made this recipe even quicker by using high quality tomato sauce instead of chopping and blending fresh tomatoes. It was delicious, very simple, and even my children enjoyed it.

I made this last night for the first time after saving the recipe for over two years. I used canned peeled tomatoes as tomatoes are not in season. I also couldn't figure out why I needed 1/2 cup of olive oil which seemed a lot so I used 1/4 cup instead. I used a Portuguese dry white vinho verde and it was perfect. This was delicious and is a keeper. Tasty and fast and fresh. I didn't see anything wrong with the layers of flavor at all. I will make this again soon (and the leftovers were good too!)

very tasty! quick, cheap, delicious. we used some week old pinot noir since we didn't have any white wine, and it was perfect. i didn't think the flavor was lacking anything, but i added chili flakes for spice.

Yummy, yummy, yummy! This was SO tasty! I followed some of the other suggestions and added some red pepper flakes and some whole Italian sausages. A real dinner hit! The recipe did not say peeled tomatoes, but I did peel them, but did not seed them. Also added about a tbsp of tomato paste.

Loved the flavor of this dish!!! Very easy to make. Like others, I added the olives last as I don't like the flavor of them cooked either. Accidentally used Sake instead of white wine, was perfect.

I followed the recipe as it was written and my husband and I thought it was great. It went into my permanent file!

Made this for a big crowd - 6x the recipe! It came out great. I did add some crushed red pepper to the sauce itself. One adjustment for that to make it more of a buffet style - I had one big bowl of the pasta, diced tomatoes, parsley, feta, salt and pepper, and second bowl of hot tomato sauce, then let people ladle the sauce over the pasta. This allowed for better distribution of all the ingredients in these larger quantities, and everything kept very well over the hour. I think mixing it all earlier would've resulted in a gooey mess and pasty pasta..

This is really easy and it is a great recipe. I agree that it could use a little kick, so I used spicy olives, which worked well.

I loved this dish! I served it to some vegetarian friends and everyone loved it - even my 4-year old! I made a few small changes though - I cut the oil in half, and added the olives much later in the process so they retained more of their flavour. All in all, a fantastic dish!!

This was some very good pasta, I do agree with lisamargaret that there is a layer of flavor missing...I added some spinach to it and a little ground red pepper for spice. It turned out delicious. This is a good pasta base for you to incorporate other meats or veggies, or perhaps as a side dish.

Good weekday dinner. A layer of flavor is missing, and I think a few anchovies, chopped and tossed in at the end, might fill the void.

This was wonderful! I cooked on the side some Italian sausage for my meat loving husband. I also grabbed what I though was an open bottle of white wine, but found out later it was Sake! The sauce still tasted just fine. I'm not fond of cooked olives so I left them out and had black ones on the side. This was very easy to make, I'd make it again!
