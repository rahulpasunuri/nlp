These were very good, but overshadowed by the 3 other types of deviled eggs on the platter with it (traditional, southwest (my husband's invention) and the garam masala recipe from this site). My husband got a little carried away with the tarragon, which was a little strong, but without that, these would have been very good. I will make again.

My daughter made this recipe yesterday for Easter. They were the best I have eaten. I am going to make them tonight. Substituted parsley for the tarragon because didn't like tarragon. They were delicious.

Recipe is OK. I made exactly as suggested, and did not have enough "zing" to it. After adding vinegar, lots of salt and pepper and more mayo, it came to life a bit more. People at the party didn't complain, and my toddlers loved them, too. I, however, prefer my mother's standard deviled eggs recipe.

These are so good that when ever we have pot luck at work this is the only thing I'm allowed to bring.

I make these all the time but I leave out the olive oil completely and add more mayo. The flavor of the capers and tarragon is really good.

I think I prefer traditional deviled eggs to these, but they were good and different. I cut back on the olive oil based on some of the reviews, but they seemed a bit dry. Maybe more mayo next time.

These were a huge hit at my Easter cocktail party. I did not use the full amount of olive oil and they came out perfectly. I just mixed until it looked right. Very good and will definitely be making again!

My guests thought these were way too oily, I had to agree, glad others enjoyed

Made this for Easter dinner and everyone loved them. I didn't add the celery on top and it wasn't missed. I will make these my go-to deviled eggs recipe!

Made this for a summer BBQ with friends and everyone loved it. Didn't have the celery, didn't miss it. Not a single adjustment necessary, except to make it healthier, I didn't put in the olive oil and used reduced fat mayo.

I was hopeful but found the mixture oily, next time, if make, will cut down on oil.

Very fresh version. I particularly liked the caper addition. I substituted fresh basil for the tarragon as that's what I had in my herb windowbox. Will try it with tarragon next time.

I made these as an appetizer before Scallops with "Melted" Leeks and Tarragon-Caper Butter (to stay with the tarragon - caper flavor theme while holding the starving teens at bay). Everyone enjoyed them - they were a nice change from 'ordinary' deviled eggs - very fresh tasting.

Made these for Easter this year for a twist on the traditional. HUGE hit! Added 4 T. capers, since you couldn't even taste them with just 1 T.

I brought these as an appetizer to Easter dinner. They were delicious. I split the eggs vertically and cut a sliver off each end; this makes it much easier to serve the eggs standing on a plate, and to pick them up and eat them. I minced the sliced-off egg- white slivers and mixed them into the yolk mixture. I also followed the tip for putting the yolk mash into a plastic bag and piping it from a cut tip. I didnt find that worthwhile, and for another batch just spooned the filling in with an iced-tea spoon; it was less fuss and came out just as well. The sliced celery garnish made a difference, and was worth it. Leftovers made great lunches throughout the week.

This was a hit at our Easter brunch. The recipe can easily be doubled. I'm not a celery fan, so I cut the required amount by half and garnished with a few tarragon leaves.

Loved this recipe. Was a little worried the mustard would be too strong and worried the capers would be overpowering. Perfect recipe as written. With the exception of using half of the oil and adding more mayonnaise and mustard.

The tarragon and capers are great--the celery is the finishing touch--do not add salt at all--at least not until the very end, the capers are plenty salty.

I liked the recipe (I particularly like the tarragon flavor with eggs), but I have discovered a far faster way to fill deviled eggs. Toss all filling ingredients into a zip-type plastic bag (quart size or larger) and moosh everything up. Snip off a corner of the bag, and voila, instant pastry bag. Faster and far less messy than using a bowl and fork!

YUMMY!!! I made these for a party, and even thought I forgot them and put them out after everone had already eated, they still disappeared. I added the tarragon gradually to taste, since it can be overpowering. It came out perfectly.

A really great combination of flavors. I absolutely love the addition of the sliced celery on top because of the wonderful crunch it adds. I added extra tarragon without overwhelming the other flavors. I also added extra mayonnaise and a little mustard because otherwise it would have been too dry. I made these a full day ahead of serving, but kept the filling and the whites separate until four hours before serving.

The best deviled eggs I have ever had! The capers are an excellent touch, and allow for a recipe that is both light and flavorful! I did have to add extra mayonnaise and mustard as the original mixture was a bit dry, but this may have just been personal preference. I will make these again and again!

Members of my herb club ate these up at our annual potluck. Made as directed but skipped the sliced celery toppings.

I love capers so any excuse to use them is good in my book. These were a big hit at our SuperBowl gathering, and disappeared in no time.

This was much better than the same old boring deviled eggs. Very easy, too. Once I boiled the eggs, the whole thing took under 10 minutes. I was out of capers, so I chopped up a few green olives in their place, and it came out excellent.

Excellent eggs. Nice way to use an overabundance of spring garden tarragon.We made this as an appetizer with 11 people at the table, and about half were eaten before we even sat down.

I used plain old onions. Tasty. Easy to make. A delicious snack.
