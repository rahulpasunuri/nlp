Quick and easy. Substituted 1/4 cup Sriracha (Thai garlic-chili sauce) in place of 1/4 cup ketchup and the garlic cloves for a spicy kick. Yum!

Followed the recipe exactly, and it was kind of bland, so I added a double shot of good, smoky scotch (Bowmore) and it turned out incredible. Every guest at the barbecue commented on the sauce, even the ones who didn't know I had made it myself. We're definitely making it again.

Great.Easy to make,did'nt even use the blender. For a ketchupy type sauce this rates right up there.Think it would be fun to vary the incredients to suit.

The sauce turned out more of a molasses color rather than the more red sauces available in the supermarkets. The one addition I made was fresh rosemary; the modification was hot paprika--nice tingle without overpowering heat. I basted the meats with fresh rosemary branches. Very nice!
