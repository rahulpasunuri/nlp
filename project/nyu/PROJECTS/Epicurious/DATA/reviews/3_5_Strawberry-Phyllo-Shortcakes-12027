My phyllo turned out quite dry and messy...and I used more butter than called for. I prefer real shortcake.

This is not very elaborate, just phyloo dough, cream, and strawberries but the whole is definitely more than the sum of its parts. Yummy but quite messy.

I found the instructions less than clear in the cutting of the sheets. I quartered, then cut the quarters in half, producing 4 layers per. It worked out very well and all four of us enjoyed the results. I sliced somewhat more than the 1-1/2 cups of berries, but used only the 2 Tbsp of honey and it was nicely juicy. Also, I successfully used light Cool Whip for the topping.
