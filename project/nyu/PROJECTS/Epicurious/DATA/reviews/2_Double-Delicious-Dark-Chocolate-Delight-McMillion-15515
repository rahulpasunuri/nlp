This recipe is a produces a great product, but there seems to be an error in the technique of making the mousse. I tried three times following the recipe to the letter with poor results. The mousse came out clumpy, not smooth. I consulted a few other books of mine and found it is best if instead of folding all of the whipping cream into the chocolate at once, whip about 25% of it into the chocolate then fold the rest. It was perfect after that. Questions? email me!
