SO good. Added about a 1/4 cup of white wine so I could deglaze the pan. Left the chicken in while I added the tomatoes, garlic, white wine, basil and balsamic because it was thick cut. Doubled the balsamic. Added lots of salt and pepper to the chicken before adding to the pan and over the whole skillet before serving. The tomatoes burst in your mouth! Served with parmesan-roasted butternut squash (this site, added apples, nutmeg, and cinnamon dashes) and wild rice. Big hit! My favorite way to make chicken thus far.

Simple, healthy, and delicious. The only change I would make is to make 3 chicken breasts (rather than 2) for the specified amount of 'sauce.' Highly recommended.

Loved the sauce but I'm not a big fan of chicken breasts. Next time I'll try using boneless chicken thighs. What a great way to use the thousands of cherry tomatoes in my garden.

It is hard to believe anyting this tasty could be prepared so quickly and easily. I used red grape tomatoes because the yellow were not available. Delicious. I'll be making this again and again.

Very easy, first time I have cooked chicken. My husband loved it, I'm vegetarian so I did not eat it.

I thought this receipe was wonderful...easy and delicious..the whole family loved it. The one suggestion I would add, and I did, just sear the chicken to start and then make the sauce and put the chicken back into the sauce and simmer for a while so that the chicken can absorb the flavor....

This was a great meal, and really simple to make. I loved the sweet tangy combination fo the balsamic with the tomatoes. I found that there was definitely enough sauce for me, though it couldn't hurt to thow in another tablespoon of balsamic. This would be good over a pork chop too.

Easy and delicious, I made this last night with fresh yellow plum tomatoes from my organic mkt and it was fantastic. I sliced readymade polenta and pan fried them in the left over drippings in the pan for a couple of minutes. I made a simple arugala salad as suggested with oil and vinegar and the flavors all complimented each other to perfection. I also served it with a nice chardonnay.

So easy and delicious...this one will be a staple in my kitchen for how fast it comes together. I served this over polenta that was spinkled generously with parmesean (sp) cheese, that added some nice depth to this dish. I look forward to making this again.

Excellent, Easy and it tasted and smelled fantastic! I add a little more balsamic to make a little more sauce. I served with rice and polenta cakes. Great healthy dish!! A keeper!!

Easy and delicious! I've made it 2-3 times a month since it was in the magazine. I use red grape tomatoes because they're always available (although I used cherry tomatoes halved once, with different but excellent results). I cook them slightly longer to get them wrinkly and releasing the juices a little more. (Never had a problem with tough skins. Think peeling the tomatoes, as one cook suggested, spoils the ease of the dish.)

Really good. I have a ton of cherry tomatoes in my garden so this was perfect. I put a little flour on the chicken to get a better browning and served with soft polenta that I made.

I really liked this dish, but i made a few revisions. I used much more balsamic than called for...one tablespoon didn't give me any sauce....I also kept the chicken in while i added the tomatoes and vinegar so it got infused with the flavor. I had pounded the chicken thin also. Next time i will blanch and peel the tomatoes as their skins got tough from sauteeing.

I made this last summer with yellow grape tomatoes given to me by my neighbor. This year I planted my own yellow grape tomatoes to ensure I had some for this recipe. Easy, quick and the left-overs make a nice little salad.

No yellow grape tomatoes so used fresh from the Florida garden red ones. This is easy but really nothing special in our book.

A little too much balsamic vinegar for my taste, as it was very sweet. I cut the chicken into strips rather than sauteeing the portions whole, & served it with linguine. Enjoyed it, & it was certainly very quick & simple, but slightly less enthused than the other reviwers.

This recipe was super quick and easy and incredibly delicious. I served it with a risotto on the side and it was fantastic.

This dish was wonderfully easy AND tasty. Added pierogies (potato/onion) to the sauce just to coat before serving. YUM!!!

I second the opinions of those below - this is WONDERFUL. I have never cooked w/balsamic before - so glad to have discovered how deliciously sweet it becomes when reduced. I have made this many times over w/golden garden tomatoes, yellow grape, red cherry, and plum tomatoes and all are delicous! The golden varieties of tomatoes do lend the sweetest results. One of my all time favorite recipes!!!!! TRY THIS!

This recipe is so quick, easy and tasty that I had to give it 4 stars. I absolutely love this sauce, who would've thought something so easy could taste so good!

When ease of preparation is taken into consideration this may be a four fork dish! It's hard to believe how little went into such a tasty dish.

Absolutely delicious - made this obviously in Winter and no yellow tomatoes were available but used red grape tomatoes. Extremely tasty - my husband gives it four forks, but for me, a dish has to have lobster for 4!

I cant agree more with the cooks that have already commented on this recipe...the smell alone of this dish while it was cooking was wonderful...so easy and quick to make after work...the chicken picks up such great flavor..

This is spectacular considering the amount of work which goes into it. I used ripe red garden tomatoes and it was delicious. Also doubled the sauce, which enabled us to drench the polenta in it.

This was summer on a plate. We used yellow pear tomatoes that took on a nice sweetness with cooking. The basil and balsamic vinegar made a delicious sauce - next time we'll make more.
