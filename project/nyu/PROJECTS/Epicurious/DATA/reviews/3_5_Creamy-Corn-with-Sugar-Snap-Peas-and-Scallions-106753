this was soooo good. the scallions really permeated through the cream/veggies, making it awesome. I used half n half instead of cream, and it was fine.

This was great. I used 2% milk thickened with a little flour (about 1/2 a T.) and really did not miss the richness of the cream.

very easy and delicious. perfect with fresh summer corn. to make the cream sauce thicker, just boil it longer with the scallions. this also infuses the onion flavor into the cream, which is nice with the sweet freshness of the corn and the snap peas.

I used frozen corn and frozen sugar snap peas and defrosted them in the frig. Mixed them into the cream and onions. Very easy, very fast, and good.

Simple prep with just a few ingredients. Great way to show off the flavor of fresh veggies. I subbed canned milk for the cream. If I made this again I would use just corn, or corn and red bell pepper with a dash of cayenne.

Delicious - I added broccoli and used half frozen snap peas and half fresh. I would suggest about a 1/4 teaspoon of flour in the sauce as well.
