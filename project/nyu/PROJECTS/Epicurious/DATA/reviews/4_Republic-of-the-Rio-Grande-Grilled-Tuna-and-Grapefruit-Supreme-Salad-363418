torn between three and four forks here. it was a very good salad--filling, tangy, tasty--but whether it was great or not ... could be me, could be them. I will DEFINITELY make it a few more times to find out though. Right now, I'm thinking the jalapeno was perhaps not what it should have been. We didn't get the mix and interaction of flavors we expected, and that seemed to be what was missing. Again though, could be us; German jalapenos, in our experience, are not always as hot as those you get in the US. Also, there's no need for the extra half grapefruit. If you section carefully, there's more than enough juice from the other two to make the dressing/marinade. Overall, a really good recipe--probably just need to be sure of good, fresh ingredients (as you always should).

fresh and bright tastes, great for a weekday bbq. I enjoyed the play between the sweet citrus and the spicy jalapeno, and the red onion tied everything together very nicely. I used albacore steaks because I had them, but otherwise followed the recipe as is. Nice with a Hall sauvignon blanc and some sliced avocado. will definitely make this again.
