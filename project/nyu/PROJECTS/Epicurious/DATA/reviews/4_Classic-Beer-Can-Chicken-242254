Loved this! Used a charcoal grill with indirect heat. My spice rub was what I had on hand...a 1/4 cup Italian seasoning, 1/2 t. garlic powder,2 T. of low sodium season salt and 1T. Wye River Spicy Black Formula. Used rub inside and out side of bird. I also set the beer and bird in a disposable aluminum pan. 7 lb.chicken took about 1 3/4 hrs. For a side dish I cut white potatoes into large wedges, drizzled with olive oil and used some of the dry rub for the potatoes. Put them in a disposable aluminum pan covered with foil and put them on the grill while the bird was resting.They needed to be tossed a few times so they didn't burn on the bottom. A fresh green salad and voila! The meal was fabulous and I will do it again, and again!

Made this recipe twice now and both times it has been DELICIOUS! Our charcoal grill would not fit a chicken once the lid goes on so made it on gas grill. A 4 lb chicken took about 1 1/2 hours on med low indirect heat. SO moist and tender!!

Have been skeptical about these recipes and was pleasantly surprised. Have used a vertical roaster for years with great success, tried this technique and was very happy with the results. My husband kept raving about it. Didn't use a beer can since don't like the idea of cooking on an aluminum can--bought a chicken roaster for the process (on sale at Williams Sonoma) which seemed more stable. Used some blackening spices and added some hot peppers to the beer. Didn't use chips. Turned out great--very moist meat, crispy skin, great flavor. This is a very good technique and anyone can do it at any skill level.

Wow!! We used beer, our favorite spices and cooked it on the charcoal grill with some mesquite. It was super moist and DELICIOUS. So easy.

Beer is just option to use for this method of cooking whole chicken. I have used pineapple juice, cola, etc and all seem to work nicely. I usually add a bay leaf and a few other things to the liquid like chopped garlic or rosemary to ramp up the flavor. I find this to be my favorite method for cooking chicken on the BBQ or in the oven.

I've been making this for years, though I use a smoker - I also use Season-All inside & out of the chicken before I add the other ditties. I insert 5 to 6 cloves of garlic under the skin of the breast, thighs & legs - more in cavity of the chicken if there is room after inserting a cut up apple or pear. Rosemary leaves and garlic is awesome too. I always use a cheap beer - a single that is larger than a 12 oz though I don't know how many oz the can actually is. I use cherry or apple wood chunks in the smoker with the regular charcoal briquets - for a slightly sweet taste in the meat. (The fruit inside the chicken cavity also adds a little sweetness as well).

Haven`t tried the oven yet, but it works in the oven. 350*f Meat temp to 180* Done. @ one hour fifteen to thirty Minutes. Good Luck

Has anybody attempted to make this in the oven? I live in an apartment so I can't do this on the grill/bbq, but I'd love to make this for my Dad for dinner on Father's Day.

I found it a very easy and fun recipe. Used an interesting spice rub from my local spice shop and added dried onions. Additionally, I put some of the rub in between the meat and skin of the chicken. Since I live in Colorado, I used good old Coors beer. The end result was moist and delicious! I look forward to trying it again with a different rub/beer combo for new flavors. After reading the last reviewer's troubles with a charred chicken, I made sure to keep my heat a little to the low side, and the chicken came out a delectable, crispy brown on the outside.

got all the information - put the chicken on my gas grill - left the center jet off for indirect cooking - 10 minutes later I opened the grill and had a charcoal black chicken looking right at me......are you kidding!
