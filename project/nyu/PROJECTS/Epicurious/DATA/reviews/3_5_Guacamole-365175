The best guacamole I have ever made by myself, and better than most Mexican restaurants. Easy to make too!

Easy & quick recipe... I would suggest an additional jalepeno pepper for more kick. One was not enough..

Great recipe, with a twist (mortar & pestle) I haven't used before in making guacamole. I loved it and it tasted like guacamole in a restaurant. It got great reviews from guests too. My mortar is small so I did part one of the recipe (crushing up the onion, cilantro, jalapeno) then added it to my bowl of avocados, etc. It worked just fine. This is my new guac recipe!

This was great, mashing the onion, cilantro & jalapenos was something different, but it worked. Try it!

I mean... how could you go wrong with homemade guacamole! There is some weird lime shortage now, so rather than go to a few different stores I skipped it. Still turned out amazing. So full from munching on it I didn't even have supper after!
