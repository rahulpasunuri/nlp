My family loved this. I did make a change and used some olive oil to cook the onions in instead of the oil from the artichokes and it was very flavorful. This might be my new spaghetti sauce, minus the artichokes.

The first time I prepared this recipe, we were having guests. It was so easy to prepare, and everyone loved it. I think this will be one of my staples. Yum!

I made this recipe last night and loved it. I used a can of diced tomatoes and then added a small can of tomato sauce. Kept it cooking for a while and added water as needed. I got artichokes in marinade with little oil, so only got the flavor of the spices. My co-workers loved having the leftovers with me at lunch the next day.

I made some changes to this recipe after reading the other reviews and have to say I really enjoyed the recipe. I didn't use tomato paste because otherwise the recipe would have been too sweet and I didn't add all of the artichoke oil at the end of cooking to keep it from becoming oily. I also added extra chili flakes for a little more flavor. Overall it was pretty satisfactory for a first try. :)

I did not think it was possible, but this recipe may very well have caused me to swear of marinated artichoke hearts. It seemed like they marinating liquid made the tomatoes taste off. It was the first dish I have served in a long time where nobody wanted to eat it. There should be a rating below OK where if enough people think it was terrible, it gets removed so others do not have to suffer through it.

What a waste of time this dish was. Save your time and ingredients for something else!
