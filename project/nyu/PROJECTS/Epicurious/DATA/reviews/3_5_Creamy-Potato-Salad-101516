This needs a little mustard and olives to make it more piquant. It takes ingredients on hand and is good but not great.

As is this recipe is not that great, the first time I made it the vinegar flavor was overwhelming. I made it again and halved the vinegar, and used 1 part mayo and 1 part plain yogurt, because mayo also has a lot of vinegar. I also took the suggestion of green onions, which have a great flavor but are not overwhelming. These changes really helped improve the flavor and made a yummy really creamy salad that my guests loved.

Best potato salad I've had in years! I subbed scallions for the standard onion and used white wine vinegar instead of red because I find that red just overpowers anything you add it to.

This was edible, but not a keeper. The vinegar was a bit too intense for most people's taste. I can't imagine layering mustard over the vinegar flavor as one reviewer suggested. Ick. Bottom line: this is a slightly different take on potato salad, and a respectable dish, but nothing exceptional.

Made this for a cookout. It was a complete hit with everyone, but especially the men. Many said it was the absolute best potato salad they had ever eaten. The only change I made was to double it.

I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS IN ADVANCE. I made it for a barbeque an hour or so before and it was good. But the next day it was GREAT.

I like this as a basic potato salad recipe, and I think it could be even better with some experimentation. I added an extra hard boiled egg, and sprinkled a little paprika on top for appearances. I think it needs a little more of a "kick" but not sure what to add

This was ok, but not as wonderful as I had expected it to be after reading all the glowing reviews. A bit on the bland side. I did omit the peppers, as I don't like them. I think I'm going to have to add a bit more mayo and maybe some spicy mustard to give it a little more zing. Just added the mustard. A VERY generous squeeze or two of Gulden's Spicy Brown Mustard did the trick. MUCH better!

Having read all of the positive reviews, I passed this recipe along to my mother, who always makes excellent potato salad without using a recipe. She made a double batch of this for our Canada Day barbecue and guests raved about it. She said that this will be her standard potato salad from now on. The only change she made was to put in green onion instead of white onion. Highly recommended.

I loved this recipe. I also received a lot of compliments of it. I also tried "State Fair Potato Salad," but I didn't like it as much as this.

I didn't have the peppers or radishes in the house this morning, but decided to make this recipe anyway. It was WONDERFUL! The dressing is soooo delicious and I plan to make this often.

As a personal chef, I tested this first, and it's a definite go ahead for my clients. I used yellow and orange bell peppers, as that was what was on hand. Used 65% less fat eggless mayo from Trader Joe's and was fabulous. Best the next day, so give it time to infuse. Simple and tasty.

Wonderful- I made recipe as is but substituted red onion which I think added that extra something that made it delicious

I would add fresh red radishes and green onions, and I would leave out the wine and vinegar
