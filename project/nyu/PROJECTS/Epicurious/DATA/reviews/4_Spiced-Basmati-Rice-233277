Super easy recipe, I just threw everything into the rice maker and turned it on. It has a good base...I think I'm going to try and work on some add in's. Good!

It's been a while since I made this recipe but I remember that the rice turned out just right. I used regular dry bay leaves (I don't know about Turkish). I don't remember what kind of stock I used (perhaps bouillon cubes). I wouldn't call it exceptional, though. I wouldn't make it again because it's simpler to use water than stock (I make my own or I use the cubes), and I don't feel the cinnamon was well-spent in this recipe.

Yuck! This had no flavor at all. Smelled wonderful when it was cooking but ...

The proportions of rice to liquid is perfect! Fluffiest rice. I made it differently though- I sauteed some chopped onion in butter and saffron powder, then stirred rice in the onion mixture and then added water. was verrrry good!

Lovely. I used brown basmati rice and omitted the butter and it still had wonderful flavor and aroma. It will be a staple!

This is excellent. I make it exactly as the recipe says. My children and hubby love it as well.

Made with the chicken & fig (like Silver Palate marabella) recipe on this site and it was fabulous. Just the right flavor combination.

Wow. Almost 2 years since last review. I made this without the Bay Leaves (we didn't have any) and it still rocked. No reason to ever make "plain" Basmati Rice ever again

Made this two nights on the spin and have to agree with the reviewer below that it was probably the best part of the meal. So simple that it is bound to take the place of 'plain old rice' when I cook.

This rice was delicious. I made it with the lamb stew and the rice was our favorite part. Made the recipe as is and won rave reviews from my boyfriend - will definitely make this again.
