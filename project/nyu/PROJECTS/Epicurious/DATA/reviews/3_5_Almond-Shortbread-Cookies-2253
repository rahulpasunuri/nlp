this recipe is delicious! Fantastic with tea - I added a ghosting of chopped up mexican chocolate to the top and loved this addition.

Very tasty and easy cookies. But - if you cut them into rounds, do not bake them for 22 minutes! I took them out after 13 minutes and that was plenty. Next time I'll start checking at 10 minutes.

These cookies were crisp and delicious. However, if you roll out the dough and use a small round cookie cutter you can make 17 cookies, not just 8. You can place almond chunks on top for decoration before baking. If you serve these on a platter, red rasberries or other small fresh fruits can make the platter more atractive.

I'm happy to have found this recipe again. My old magazines were tossed in a move and I've been looking for some old favorites since. Still looking for caramel tarts from Bon Appetite.

This is the perfect shortbread to serve with fresh strawberries. Be sure to use a non-stick cake pan.

I liked the taste of these, but the texture wasn't right. I followed the recipe exactly and when I pulled the cookies out of the oven the edges were a nice, golden brown. However, when it came time to serve the cookies, they didn't taste or feel "done" except around those outside edges.

EASY! EASY! EASY! and Great with coffee or espresso. A nice change from Biscotti at the end of the Italian meal.

YUMMY!! ... a favorite for holiday baking ... repeating for Mother's Day guests! .... the brown sugar adds a bit of sweetness not found in the Chocolate Dipped Orange Hearts or Lemon Shortbread .. although those 2 were also very good! ... the trick to those is finely grated peel! lol ...
