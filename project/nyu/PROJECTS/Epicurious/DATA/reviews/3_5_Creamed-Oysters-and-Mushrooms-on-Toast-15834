De-lish!! It came out so good and really quite easy. I cooked the sauce a lot longer to thicken it a bit, that way it spread really well on the toast. Great recipe and I will definitely make this again.

This was just delicious. I threw in some snow pea pods and some thin-sliced Buddig beef to add to the meats. A great comfort food - I didn't even use the mushrooms because I didnt' have them on hand, but I will definitely include them next time - and double the oysters! We were left wanting more...

With one exception, I have served this recipe for Christmas Brunch for many years and is a family favorite; now I will try adding the mushrooms. I have always used Tawny Port insteaqd of white wine in this case, and served with a slice of Country Ham, thinly sliced on top of the toast, then the Creamed Oysters, it truly is the Necter of the Gods!
