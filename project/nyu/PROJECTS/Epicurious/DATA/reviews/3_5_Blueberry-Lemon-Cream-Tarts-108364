I think this recipe tastes like something out of a box for a lemon cheesecake. I don't think I will make it again. I added lemon extract and zest to give it something extra, but it still seemed blah.

Great recipe but per the suggestions of other reviewers I include the all the zest from one lemon and add about 2 tsp. lemon juice to the cheese mixture - adding both flavor and making the cheese easier to spread.

Made this for an old friend... The cream is lovely as is (following the recipe), but I found that a bit more zest & lemon juice made it even better. The fresh blueberries make the lemon flavor pop, and the graham crackers just tie it all together. I would definitely recommend this: 100%. It's delicious and incredibly easy to make. If in search of something simple and summery, look no further...

This is easy,quite yummy,and a pretty presentation! However, I found that the filling recipe only made 2 desserts. I had to double it for 4.

Wonderful, fresh dessert. I'm typically a chocolate person but this is super easy and got great reviews. Not too lemony.

I doubled the filling and added more sugar, vanilla and fresh lemon juice as I like the filling more flavorable. And I start the outer circle in strawberries then blueberries into the middle. Everyone loves it!

Lovely and light dessert using most any seasonal fruit. I made it for the 4th of July and subbed a prebaked vanilla wafer and almond crust for the graham crust. Also added lemon pudding to the sour cream and doubled the cream cheese to firm up the finished product. Used 1.5 pints of blueberries in a 9.5" springform pan . Heeding the reviews of others I added lemon juice but no zest- replaced that with lemon oil. When less kiddies are on hand I think I'll add some lemonciello to the filling. This recipe requires lil thought and time but the final product and praise will make people think you slaved hours over a hot stove.

Yes,, I make this recipe for special freinds.. To help the brown sugar from becoming hard,, I put a slice of white bread init,, keeps it soft all the time. bread needs to be changed each two or three weeks to keep everything fresh. I have used lemon extract, n and almonds in this also to make it flavored!!! yummmy!!!!!!

I cannot even explain how good this tart tasted! To the filling I added a couple drops of lemon juice & heavy whipping cream so that it would make it creamier. It was fantastic! I am so making this again!

This was a good and easy recipe. It was certainly a great choice for a no bake dessert on a hot, humid summer day (provided the ready made tart cups are used). Rather than lemon zest, I used about 1/2 tsp of lemon extract. The lemon flavor was definitely there but not overpowering. I used reduced fat (neutchatel/one-third less fat Philadelphia cream cheese) and regular sour cream. I think that kept the filling softer. The consistency was good. Maybe because I am not a big cheese cake fan I thought there were good, not great. My husband also thought these were good, but thought it was not really a "company" dessert, inspite of the attractive appearance.

As suggested, I added lemon juice and 1TBS heavy cream to soften the filling. I also glazed the fruit, sliced strawberries & blueberries with a little melted preserves for a shine. Spray the tartlet pans before adding crust, then after chilling cover with clear plastic wrap, turn upside down and tap with knife. Mine came out of the pans and looked beautiful. Tasted great!

I took another cooks suggestion and made one large tart. It looked great and everyone loved it, however I do agree that it needed to be more lemon-y. next time maybe I will try it with lemon mousse or curd. It was amazingly easy as well.

Love this. It's easy, and impressive. I personally like it better with raspberries, but its great with blueberries.

I really like the idea of this recipe but the cream filling was hard and stiff and there was an absence of lemon flavor. I will make it again but will either substitute moscapone for the cream cheese or, as another reviewer mentioned, add some whipped cream. And, for heaven sake, some lemon juice.

I have made this recipe several times and the crust continues to fall apart. Very good filling but can't manage the crust

Easy and delicious. I brushed the crust with melted and strained apricot marmalade so they could stay crispy.

Despite the fact that I used non-stick tartlet pans and followed the recipe exactly, the shells all fell apart. Even putting them back in the oven for a couple of minutes did not seem to make any difference. I don't know if the crust needs more butter to hold things together? And this filling was tasteless. This didn't turn out well at all.

I thought this recipe was delicious. Instead of individual tarts I made one large tart and substituted blackberries for the blueberries - everyone loved it. Yummmy!

Great for impressing gourmet chefs! I doubled the crust, and tripled the filling making one large tartlett pie. I used peaches in addition to the blueberries which looked wonderful and tasted delicious.

I would make again. Everyone loved them. The only thing I would add ia a bit of whipped cream so the texture would be a bit more creamy, verses tacky. Quick, easy, you can also use pre-made, little, graham tart crusts.

Maybe it was just me - the shells all broke - and I found the filling too bland. I was hoping to find an entertaining summer dessert that could be made early in the day - anyone have a suggestion.

Makes a terrific looking dessert with little fuss.

Really good, but is it just me? these are the tiniest little things I've seen. The amount of filling the recipe makes maybe only halfway filled up the tarts. Next time I'll probably make 4x the filling and just put it in a pie crust. But its definitely tasty.

A beautiful and elegant dessert. I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the amount of lemon rind in the cream cheese mixture and will continue to do that in the future. The whole thing can be made ahead up to the point when the berries are put on top. Next time I will try raspberries or another more flavorful berry on top. My guests loved it and ate the rest for breakfast the next day!

This was a big hit with young and old at a recent family BBQ. It is easy to make and very tasty and it can easily be multiplied for more servings. I used wild blueberries and added the extra lemon juice to the berries--yum yum. I am making another 12 at the moment for another BBQ tonight. Thanks Epicurious!!!

A great summer dessert. Blueberries were on sale so I bought them then found this great recipe. Following others' reviews, I added 1 tbsp of fresh lemon juice for extra zing. I also cheated with ready-made individual graham cracker crusts. I am adding this to my list of make-again recipes!

For ease of preparation (bake your tarts in the morning, finish the dessert after work) it's a 3 -for taste a 2. The filling needs a lot more lemon flavor. I let the berries rest in 1 T lemon juice and sugar for about 30 minutes before topping the tarts. I imagine you could flavor the cream any way you wish - lemon, lime, orange, almond, cinnamon, chocolate - and top it however you like.

Absolutely delicious... finished mine and than my husbands... try with the rind of lime for something different

My husband thought these were fabulous. I didn't have the equipment to make the shells so I used Keebler mini graham cracker pie crusts and it was so easy. They don't take long to make when you do it this way. I received rave reviews when I served these at a cookout.

These tarts were delicious and very easy to make!! We loved the taste of the cream cheese filling and the blueberries were the perfect complementary fruit topping for this!! I have non-stick tartlet pans but they do not have a removable bottom, so I was pleasantly surprised that the each tart shell stayed together upon removing from the pan even though I had to turn each one upside down and tap on it to remove!!

This was a very easy & quick tart recipe & definitely had the "wow" factor at the bridal shower I made it for. I do think that there either needs to be more lemon flavor in the cream cheese filling (I'll add more rind next time) or a more strongly flavored berry (like a raspberry) for the topping. I found it a tad bland the first time...

Simple and quick! The entire family loved it. You could use any berry and it would still be wonderful.
