Hi everyone, I added blood orange sections, and, because we have children who object to green bits in food, steeped a teabag of mint tea in the juice as it warmed.

of course there is kosher gelatin, a common feature at many meals, in my bubba's home was Ko-Jel (not related to kojak) which was also commonly watered down by auntie Ruthie... runny gealtin...mmmmmmm . There was never a single item that entered that home that was not 100% kosher...

Sorry to dispute you Savta but gelatin is kosher for Pesach and all year round. There are varieties made from fish bones with the most reliable kosher agencies(hechsherim) supporting them as well as many Rabbis who allow any gelatin as it is not edible on it's own and therefore unable to make something treif. Brush up on your halacha.

FYI - gelatin is not kosher, much less acceptable for Passover. from Savta Atlanta.

A great ending to a heavy meal. I made a double recipe (plus an extra grapefruit) in a large crystal bowl and spooned it out at the seder table, family style. Everyone appreciated the sweet and tangy flavour.

This is a fun take on an old fashioned idea. Very fresh and "citrusy" - great after the lamb. I added Meyer lemon to the mix. Served in parfait glasses, the dessert looks like glowing jewels. (Top with sliced strawberries.)
