This recipe is terrific! The sauteed veggies with fennel were insane!! My husband and I were ummmmmin' and lovin' each bite! Absolutely scrumptious!! As other reviewer, I would also add more fennel seeds to the veggies and be sure to dip the focaccia in the remaining flavored oil from the saute pan fantastico!

3.5 forks. I made this on top of the cracked pepper and rosemary focaccia. This is an excellent dish and easy to prepare for a quick lunch. I would double the fennel seeds next time. I also used red and orange peppers.

We LOVED this sandwich. Because of a time crunch I had to order the bread from the local bakery. He made rounds topped with sliced black olives, parmesean cheese and chopped onion. I normally don't like sausage. The sausages were fresh from the meat market. We thought we died and went to heaven. I CAN'T WAIT to make this again.

This was really good and very easy to make. Nothing fancy just great simple to make food. We will positively make this again and again.

I served the peppers and sausage over polenta rather than focaccia, and it was a hit! Next time I'll double the amount of fennel and cook the peppers for a couple of minutes before I add the onions. Otherwise, a great snow-day dinner!

Have made this dish for friends as well as family, and everyone loves it. It's fast and easy. Make your own foccacia in your bread machine to make it even better, as I do.
