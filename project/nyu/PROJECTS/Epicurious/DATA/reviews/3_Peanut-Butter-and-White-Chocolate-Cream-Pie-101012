This pie is really easy to make, but way too sweet for me. I guess one could reduce the amount of powdered sugar in the peanut butter crumb und definitely in the custard, since you add so much white chocolate... But I used the graham cracker crust instead, as recommended by other users! Great idea!!!

This pie is wonderful. There is nothing to making it (a great primer on custards for the inexperienced baker). The only problem with it is how piggish you will look for eating it so quickly. It is lovely.

I have gotten in the habit of bringing the recipe along with me when I prepare this for a party or get together, I am always asked for the recipe and my significant other requests this delightful treat often!!! (Even the kids like it!)

The pudding filling was great. But the crust was difficult to cut and people did not know how to take some... whether to struggle to slice it, or scoop it out. I don't think the crust added anything to it... I would change to some kind of cookie crust or just make the filling to serve as a pudding.

Fantastic pie! The peanut butter, white chocolate and banana flavours go so well together. Easy to make and it held together nicely. Easy to slice too - doesn't all fall apart. One of our favourite pie recipes.

Brought this to a party and it has since been requested over and over . Banana Cream Pie with a lot more pizazz! Resist the urge to add the final topping until ready to serve tho...tends to soften the filling.
