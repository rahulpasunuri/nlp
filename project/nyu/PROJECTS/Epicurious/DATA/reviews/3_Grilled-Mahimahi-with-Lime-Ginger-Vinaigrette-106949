To the cook from Virginia : ASian grocery stores carry lime leaves. My store freezes them since they do not last long fresh.

To the cook from Vancouver, BC ... where do you find Kaffir lime leaves? We've been unsuccesful in our search for them. Or if anyone else knows where to order/get them from it would be much appreciated info! Oh, and this dish was delicious!

I made this dish for company, and everyone really liked it. The flavor of the vinaigrette didn't over-power the flavor of the fish, just complimented it. I served it with wild rice and spinach salad. I will definitely make it again.

There really is no reason you should have to grill this type of fish. Next time try to poach or sautee this fish, grilling adds alot of unwanted flavor.

Light but interesting taste. Easy to whip up quickly.

Simply superb! Quick and easy to make with great results - fine restaurant quality! The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly. Made again last night but subbed Atlantic salmon for the mahimahi and added half a jalapeno seeded/minced and 2 Kaffir lime leaves to the oil infusion - outstanding flavours! Brushed oil on all surfaces of the salmon and broiled rather than grilled. Just as lovely as the grilled mahimahi - maybe even better. The vinaigrette is excellent and beautifully complements the fish. I think it would also be nice with shrimp/prawns, scallops and sea bass. This is a true winner!

This is a FANTASTIC fish dish! I was lucky to get fresh MahiMahi in the middle of the U.S. in the middle of the winter and it was a real treat to have it grilled with the wonderful vinigrette. Everyone at the table raved and not a bite was left on the platter. I would like to try the vinigrette with other things too. Maybe shrimp or crab. The lemongrass/ginger oil is beautiful!

I made this over the summer - I didn't have lemongrass either but used lemon mint from the garden instead. Also had to sub red snapper for mahimahi. Served it with a fresh tomato salad and a dry gerwurztraminer - the combination of flavors was wonderful! Highly recommended!

I made this while we were on vacation in Hawaii. There was no lemongrass to be found anywhere, but I made it without, and it was fantastic nonetheless. Very easy and very good. Can't wait to try it with the lemongrass!
