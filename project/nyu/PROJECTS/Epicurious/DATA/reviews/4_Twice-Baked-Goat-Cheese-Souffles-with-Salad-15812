Also, didn't feel like the sauce added anything - really not necessary. Used oregano instead of thyme due to availability, very good. Any number of cheese/herb combos could work here.

I was skeptical that any number of these steps would work - particularly, that the souffles would slide out of the ramekins to be transferred. But this recipe is surprisingly easy and not very time consuming, and very tasty and light. I used a combination of hard goat cheeses and the taste was delicious. Also plan on trying other cheeses, think anything would work. Super convenient to pop the leftovers in the fridge and you have a tasty meal quickly (though took longer than 5 minutes to reheat).

This was my very first souffle. It was easy and delicious.

I served these at a dinner party for 14, they were easy to make and a great hit. I will make them again

The first time I made this was for a 30-person, sitdown, 3-course dinner... whew! It was absolutely divine plus a dream to serve. I made the souffles the day before and served each on a small salad plate in a pool of balsamic vinegar reduction with baby romaine greens on the side. People raved. It has since become a standard for casual dinner with friends because I can do all the work (prep through cooking) the day before and be a relaxed hostess on Saturday night!

In terms of flavor, these definitely were delicious. I served them with a salad w/vinaigrette that included Dijon mustard so the flavor would complement the Dijon in the souffle. I tried to alter the recipe a bit and use 1 cup souffle ramekins. Apparently I didn't adjust the cooking time sufficiently because when I tried to turn the souffles out, they fell apart in the middle. I just reheated them in the ramekins. So, I am not sure if this recipe can't be made in a larger size or not.

This was fantastic! I made it exactly as the recipe said. It made an excellent Sunday lunch for friends. All done ahead of time.

Loved these! We had them last night as a first course at my birthday dinner and they were a huge hit. Great texture and flavor.

I attend a culinary school and I had to make a vegetarian dish, so I picked this recipe and the souffles came out very beautiful, but a little bit " too rich" , so I tried again at home and instead of using 100% goat cheese I used 50% goat cheese and 50% cream cheese. The souffles came out very delicious and creamy!

These are totally easy and absolutely delicious. They make an elegant presentation. I usually make a salad with butter lettuce, mache, and raddichio for some color and additional texture. I also skip the cream garnish and dress the salad with a shallot vinaigrette.

This is great for a party! Add more dijon if the goat cheese is bland. I omit the cream sauce and make a dijon and sherry vinegar salad dressing.

blasphemy, but I halved the recipe and used skim milk (it's all we had) plus a little extra butter. they were a little soft but perfectly light and delicious. husband raved and I loved them too.

A Christmas Day appetizer for years! So delicious and mass appeal.

I make this in smaller ramekins every Christmas Eve for the salad course- adds great flavor and different texture to a usually heavy meal. The make-ahead claim is accurate with no texture loss and guests love it because many folks never take the time to make a souffle for themselves. A keeper

Absolutely FANTASTIC! The recipe doubled well, but some took a little longer to cook so you have to watch them. I found a great selection of aged and firm goat cheeses at Whole Foods market, and agree the mix of soft and aged firm cheeses is great! The sauce needs to boil/simmer a bit to thicken. Will try with other herbs, too. GREAT make-ahead!

This is great. I've tried different mixes of fresh and aged goat cheese, and it's always good. With fresh goat cheese the flavor is more subtle. One of the greatest things about this recipe is that all the work can be done far in advance, and all you have to do is pop it in the oven for a few minutes just before serving. It's very elegant and everyone loves it, even those who usually don't like goat cheese.

Excellent and very elegant. This has become a staple in my home. Friends request it constantly.

This recipe was easy to follow - the only thing I would change to this is to add more cheese or use a stronger goat cheese. My souffles needed more time in the oven, so I think i will not bake them bain marie next time I make time. Over all they were yummy and look great!

HAVE MADE THIS SEVERAL TIMES AND ALWAYS RECIEVE MANY OOHS AND AAAHHHHS --IT'S PERFECT TO MAKE AHEAD AND POP INTO THE OVEN AT THE LAST MINUTE AS A START TO A FABULOUS DINNER. I HAVE EVEN FROZEN A LEFT-OVER SOUFFLE AND IT TURNED OUT O.K. FOR A LATTER LIGHT LUNCH.
