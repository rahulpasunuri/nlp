This dish makes an excellent summer light meal, especially if you add the hard-cooked eggs. The mustard sauce is excellent. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and added some shredded red cabbage since I only had one Persian cucumber. I made this for a party, cutting the recipe in half and using 1/2 # cold-smoked salmon and 4 hard- cooked eggs cut in quarters. The dish was very popular!
