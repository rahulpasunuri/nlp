Easy, easy, easy! Who would think that even the thickest carrots would cook through in 20-30 minutes. It's a delicious change from the standard glazed, overly-sweet carrot dishes.

I needed a last minute dish to add to our huge Christmas gathering and happened to have carrots and leeks in my fridge. I found this and out of all the dishes I planned and worked so hard on for the dinner, this one rocked everyone's world. It was simple to do and fairly healthy and pleased everyone. We didn't even have good quality red wine vinegar. They were all excited that I didn't glaze them with sugar.

I love the combination of carrots and leeks with vinegar, but I agree with cook Shelley that the vinegar flavor is too strong. I reduced the water to one cup and the vinegar to 3/8 cup; next time I'll try only 1/4 cup of vinegar.

Like it just fine. Made it twice now, both times had to add more water during the 20-25 minute cook time because it had all evaporated.

Delicious! Have prepared it more than once. My mother also likes it--as is.

Way too much vinegar - reduce by half, at least.
