YUM. It was easy to make. I also sprinkle some grated parmesan cheese on top before I sent them into the oven. They came out with a nice crunchy top.

Really cute, tasty appetizer - and easy, too. I don't see how anyone could think these were a lot of effort. And my client and her friends LOVED them. They go in a flash so make lots.

We loved these! I made them for a party and people went nuts over them! They are so CUTE and the buns are yummy. I didn't think they were that much work...really.

Not at all worth the effort. Buy croissant dough at the supermarket, cut in half cross-wise and wrap them around the hot dogs. Better-tasting in one-tenth the time.

Not that exciting. The buns seemed like too much work for how they ended up.

I made these for a 'junk-food' themed bachelorette/cocktail party. They looked just like the picture and were a total conversation piece! The buns are SO easy to make, but need to be eaten rather quickly. All together they were a really easy, fun appetizer.

These were a big hit at the dirt track on Friday night. I substituted the red hot dogs made mostly with chicken parts that are available around here. Great with chow chow on top, and processed cheese instead on American. Also used margarine instead of butter.
