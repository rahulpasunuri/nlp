This recipe is INCREDIBLE!! Not only is it obscenely easy, but the flavors are tremendous. Instead of cooking the bass in a pan, I cook it in foil either on the grill or in the oven. I make the sauce on the stovetop. So much easier and less oil. Restaurant quality!!

Follow the instruction to the letter and this will work great. However, make sure you get a really good cut of Sea Bass. Also, I usually double the garlic and quadruple the thyme. I pull off the thyme leaves from the stems on all but 8 springs and add them to the garlic sauce. It just intensifies the flavor. Well worth it!

Excellent recipe. Makes a wonderfully light and tasty sauce. I used fresh tarragon instead of thyme, hoping the licorice flavor would add the "something" that other reviewers felt was missing. It worked. Also, flavoring the sauce to taste before serving makes all the difference.

the trick is using really good quality olive oil, and letting the garlic cook down thoroughly and slowly. fresh lemon juice is a must as well. very simple and very hard to mess up once you get the component parts right. a really delicious way to enjoy good bass.

This was such a simple recipe but had so much flavor! The chemical reaction of the lemon juice hitting the garlic and oil did the trick. This was a tasty simple dish.

While I thought this recipe was good and would probably make it again, I didn't find it to be very exciting. Perhaps more lemon juice would do the trick... The garlic really added a lot. But, I'm still holding onto hope that I'll find a better sea bass recipe.

I made this dish for a small dinner party during the holidays and everyone raved about it. I used the Sea Bass, which I had ordered from Simply Seafood since it's hard to find in my area. I have made this dish 2 other times with Tuna and it is just wonderful.

MAde this with tuna - it was pretty good but not interesting enough to make again. Reminded me of Basque dishes and might be much better with a richer fish...

Very nice and a hit with guests (4 of us)...used tuna steaks, cooked medium (yes, 8 min. too long); garlic became soft and rich, lemon juice a fresh finish for the sauce. So straightforward, I'm doing it again this week!

I sustituted tuna that i had on hand. Please don't do what I did and cook the fish for the full 8 minutes-too dry!! Next time i will reduce the cooking time to 2 1/2 minutes per side. Very good and easy.

Excellent! So easy but tastes like alot more went into making it. My husband who doesn't normally like fish LOVED this dish. I loved it so much I would have it again tonight.

This is an old and favorite dish of mine. I've made it with both types of fish and both times were delicious. It's not overpowered with garlic even though it seems like a lot.

One of the best tuna recipes ever. Sounds like too much garlic but is not.
