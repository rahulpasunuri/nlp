I returned to this recipe after 4 years. This time I used a chicken thigh. I 1/4'd the recipe for one and added a bit more cream at the end. Absolutely great! Excellent week night recipe for one, two or more.

really good - next time, I will use chicken breasts only, since that is all my family will eat. Browning first made a big difference, and the sauce was very tasty.

Fantastic weeknight supper. Made with all chicken breasts (bone out, skin on) and it was still delicious. Cooked the sauce a bit longer than recommended to make it a bit thicker.

My family hates chicken on the bone so I made this with skinless boneless chicken breast and it was so good. The sauce was outstanding!!

Added some flour to the sauce to help thicken, but overall a tasty recipe. Served with couscous and swiss chard, which made a good pairing.

I am sorry Soda Springs...but your post turned me right off. I now have to look for another recipe!

The flavor of this sauce was good but as others have said it was thin. I added some arrowroot but that didn't get the consistency that I like. With all the strong ingredients, I thougt it would have more flavor and especially mustard flavor but it was quite mild.

The recipe was easy enough and tasty enough, although I realized that a mustard sauce is just not my thing. The recipe is easy to make in one dish that you can use on both the stove top and the oven, and the chicken did brown nicely.

This was very good, but next time I would reduce the sauce a little more than half. It was kind of soupy. And not in the Chicken Soup for the Soul kinda way.

For me, the dijon flavor was not strong enough. I thought this was too bland. I did take one cook's advice and browned the chicken first - I can see that this step vastly improved the color and presentation.

Oops, forgot to rate the number of forks in previous review - absolutely 4 forks!

This recipe is great; we make it all the time and even my 2 young children love it. They love the crispy skin, and the tangyness of the mustard sauce. Similar to other reviewers, I don't use cream, but rather 1/2 and 1/2 or even just milk if that's all I have. I often serve this with Israeli cous cous and my husband loves to mix the cooked cous cous in with the pan drippings, so if you don't feel like mopping it up w/ french bread, try the large Israeli cous cous -- very yummy!

Rediscovered this recipe in my Gourmet Mag. I pretty much stuck to the recipe, and it was fantastic. Trimmed off some of the bigger pieces of fat on the chicken, which made the perfect amount of drippings. Used flat leaf parsley instead of chives, which was great. I served it with mashed yukon golds, with steamed baby carrots, and sugar snap peas.

With slight modifications this is a keeper. Everyone liked it. I made the modifications suggested in another review, namely, using a fat separator to strain the fat & solids out of the sauce before adding half & half (substituting for heavy cream), and boiling the pan juices a bit longer than instructed. I also used a little corn starch mixed w/ a couple of T of broth to thicken the sauce, before removing from the heat and whisking in the mustard and chives. For the side dish I served rice and sauteed spinach. I wonder what others have used? The plate could use some color.

A friend made this for me for dinner last night. Fantastic! The chicken was so moist, and we mopped up all the leftover sauce with french bread like little piggies. It must have been easy because he invited us at 6, went shopping, and served us at 8. I can't wait to try this myself.

I browned the chicken in an enameled cast iron pan and then roasted it in the same. Worked well. Having read the reviews, I made the following changes. When I removed the chicken, I placed it on an oven-safe dish and put it back in the oven - I know my family prefers chicken that is cooked beyond the "safe" zone. I added the broth, shallots and wine (Gallo Vermouth) to the pan drippings and cooked three minutes to reduce a bit farther than the recipe says, then put the liquid in a fat separator, removed most of the fat and the solids, and put the liquid back in the pan. At that time, I had a smooth liquid that was reduced by half. I used half and half instead of cream as that was what I had on hand. I waited a minute and it seemed too thin for what I wanted, so I mixed about 1/2 T of cornstarch and 2 T of cold stock and added it into the pan sauce. It thickened nicely. Taste was excellent, certainly not too "mustardy" at all.

Very tasty, used split chicken breasts as they were on sale. Added a little extra ingredient I don't recommend. When pulling the skillet out of the oven my grip wasn't great and the whole pan shifted and three of the four pieces fell on the floor. The girlfriends I had over said 'No problem' and we ate it anyway after pulling off the floor-tainted skins and taking full advantage of the sauce. We're not sure who was the lucky one to get the piece that stayed in the pan. Served it with some garlic mashed potatoes and the green bean and pecan recipe on this site.

Very good recipe, except that after taking the skillet out of the oven I grabbed the handle to put the shallots into the pan and absolutely burnt my entire hand. So please remember to be careful and put your oven mit over the handle!

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe tonight. It took me longer than the recipe states, but I reduced the sauce a bit more than half. I will definitely make this again.

This was quick and easy and delicious. My husband loved it! Used sour cream in place of heavy cream and had no problem thickening sauce.

After reading the rave reviews, I was a dissapointed with this one. The chicken was nice and moist, but the sauce had too much dijon flavor and over powered everything else. We don't eat much salt and the dijon gave it a very salty taste. Probably won't make it again.

DELISH! I am a relatively novice cook, with a very Italian boyfriend who knows his food well :) I prepared this recipe with all of the specified ingredients and the following modifications: used 4-5 boneless, skinless breasts; cooked entirely via stovetop; Added 2-3 tablespoons whole wheat flour to thicken the sauce after addition of heavy cream to pan (worked like a charm); I did NOT strain sauce, and added mustard and chives into the pan while still simmering; returned chicken to pan and simmered 'til cooked through. This was absolutely fabulous, and even better, SIMPLE and fast to make. My boyfriend, literally, asked me to make a "batch" of this, he loved it so much, and he is a very picky eater. I wish there were more of these "quick and easy" recipes on epicurious that tasted so rich. LOVE IT!

Simple and yet impressive! the sauce is a bit runny but with a side dish like rice it works well. Made this three times already and will continue to!

Simple and delicious. The sauce is a bit runny, so I will thicken it with some flour next time.

I've made this dish 3 times and have used a variety of high end ingredients vs. cleaning out the fridge, bottom- of- the-barrel substitutes and it was wonderful all 3 times. I have even substituted a couple of different mustards, which I realize removes the "French" influence from the recipe. Either way, great for guests or by yourself.

Good recipe for quick and easy chicken that is very tasty. The sauce is quite spectacular. I used more Dijon than called for and substituted creme fraiche for the heavy cream as it was already in the fridge. Also I took the advice of other reviewers and added a bit of flour to thicken the sauce (much needed!) and everything turned out perfectly. Will make this again and again!

I used a homemade chicken stock for this recipe and I think that made all the difference. I can't remember the wine I used for this, but it was something that was better than average. The sauce I thought was absolutely yummy.

I don't know if this will help, but I make a similar recipe stove top with boneless skinless chicken breasts. The original recipe called for heavy cream. I now use sour cream instead and it makes a thick creamy sauce.

The recipe for Roast Chicken with Rosemary-Garlic Paste is FAR superior! This recipe was very disappointing! Even with the addition of more Dijon the sauce did nothing for me. Basically tasteless chicken with a runny sauce that lacked any pizzaz.

Had a very similar experience as Cook from Denver. My husband made this recipe last night and it was just delicious--a combination of tender chicken, crispy crust, and a smooth, creamy, delicious sauce. It is company worthy! We served it with garlic and mushroom couscous that complimented the dish nicely.

Good sauce; I agree with other reviewers who thought it needed thickening. Certainly an easy, tasty main course.

I cheated and used boneless chicken breasts, but the sauce was very nice. It didn't thicken up well so I returned it to the pan while warming up the chicken. It then thickened up nicely. We enjoyed it, but it wasn't very memorable. It it an easy way to make a quick sauce for chicken though!

Absolutely fabulous recipe! My husband made this for me this evening and it was outstanding. The sauce was rich and creamy, and the chicken pieces were tender and juicy. We will make this for company. I'd rate it 4 forks, but the 4th fork won't light up.

Easy to make a good flavors. I used only bone-in chicken breasts, and they worked wonderfully. My only complaint was that the sauce came out the consistency of water. Next time I'll try thickening with flour.

This is easy and delicious. I used all thighs and amazingly already had all the ingredients in the house. I used a little more Dijon and heavy cream than called for and thickened with flour and water mixed to make the sauce perfect! Once the sauce was complete, I put the chicken back into the pan with the sauce and let it sit for about 20-30 minutes and served with white rice. Great weekday night meal - my husband just loved this!
