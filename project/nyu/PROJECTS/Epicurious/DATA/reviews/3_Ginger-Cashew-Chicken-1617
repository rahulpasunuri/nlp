Not so much dull as just plain wrong. Mustard? For real? And cook the flavor out of everything while you're at it. For those who like chow mein. For all others, avoid.

This is one of the dumbest recipes I've come across. First of all, you cannot cook the onions for 10 mins on high heat, it will be burnt to a crisp. Second, cooking everything on high heat for 20 plus mins will burn everything to a crisp. Third it taste like any other Chinese stir-fry without the veggies. Plus it does not specify if you use ground or whole mustard, I would opt for a good stir-fry recipes instead of wasting time with this one. Clearly this person should not be writing recipes.

Ok, if you have a lot of celery to use up. Cashews and scallions ad a nice touch, but overall the dish is average.

We loved this, served it on brown rice pilaf. I pounded the chicken a bit to get it uniform and followed the recipe. excellent.

This dish was delicious, and the perfect way to use up chicken that I've removed from the bone and shredded after making soup with it (let the chicken boil in the soup for an hour and remove it before it loses all its flavor). I only have one complaint: it takes exactly like the chinese food a good restaurant makes. There was nothing particularly unusual about it. That said, I will probably make it again. Regarding the sauce, next time I'll make two or even three times as much. I felt that the dish could have used more. I also didn't have sherry on hand, so I just added extra chicken broth.

This was easy to make and had a great taste. I did not use celery or sherry, but the ginger taste was a little overpowering. The flour did not thicken so I will try cornstarch as suggested by other reviewers. We used jasmine rice so the overall taste was very good.

This is an easy and tasty dish. I am always struggling for things my kids will eat and they really enjoyed this. I added red peppers and asparagus tips - I think broccoli would be good also.

I wanted to say after reading these reviews, that the dish was quite nice - not too spicy, but needing 'crunch' like most chinese does. I did have problems with the flour for thickening, and will use cornstarch the next time - but the onions were so well flavored that my onion hating family didnt notice them. I would recommend trying this dish yourself, and add in whatever veggies you have to 'crunch' up the recipe.

I must confess that I don't dare make this recipe given its lukewarm reviews below, but to improve this recipe I would suggest doing the following (1) add 1.5 or 2 tbsp rice vinegar to the sauce, (2) add 1 or 2 tsp brown sugar to the sauce, (3) make sure the "small onions" (shallots?) and garlic pieces get good and brown during cooking, (4) marinate the chicken before cooking (e.g. in soy sauce and vinegar). For a similar Asian comfort food dish, try the "stir-fried chicken with yellow peppers and snow peas" recipe on this site. It's classic, if slightly bland, and even picky eaters will eat it.

I would agree with some of the previous reviewers that this recipe was rather bland and was missing something. I thought I would like it better given the combination of ingredients--I'm thinking that if I make it again, it might help to marinate the chicken first in sherry, soy sauce, dry mustard, garlic, and ginger and to add some hot pepper to the entire dish.

:( It was a waste of ingredients. It was really missing something. My family sat around the table trying to brainstore what would make this taste like something worth eating. 1 tried wasabe to add some heat,,, it was ok... we added some sesame oil to the bowl on the table (hoping it would make it better) but alas, it did not help. I followed the receipe exactally. My ginger dressing on my salad did save the meal :)

This recipe had an excetional taste tome. But I don't think the public ould prefer somthing more blan. I have learned that the public dose not value natural taste they l9ove to add to much spice. Most of the time the spice is salt that takes away from the orginal flavor.

Liked it, didn't love it. Good for a quick and easy weeknight dinner, but I'd add mushrooms and other veggies to jazz the chicken up a bit.

Really enjoyed this recipe! Definitely one to do again. I did not have fresh ginger on hand, but found that using ground ginger from the spice rack worked just fine!

This one is good. Just don't forget to roast the cashews before you put them in the dish.. makes it a lot better.. I would recomend this to anyone who likes asian dishes with a taste of ginger.

I loved this dish.I took the suggestions to use cornstarch and I substituted wine for sherry, which worked really well.I usally make chicken stir-fry, which doesn't have the a very tasty sauce.This dish has a wonderful sauce that has a fabulous taste.Everyone in my family just loved this dish.I think I'll be making this dish a lot more.

I de-boned thighs and legs and used corn starch to. We loved the ginger and garlic flavors,I didn't have sherry so I used wine,this worked ok to.One bad thing is,it's hard to keep the kids from picking out all the cashews,I will make this again. Yum

Very dissapointing. It seems to be almost there but doesn't pull through. This one goes off our list.

Very good. I loved the sauce, although I found the fresh ginger seemed to burn on the bottom of the wok. Or was that just me? I'll be making this again. Next time I'll try cornstarch too!

Used the conrnstarch tip, and added a bit of oyster sauce for a more Asian flavor. Delicious!

Very delicious. I took the cornstarch tip and it worked out very well. I found that I had to cut the ingredients in half because it was just too much for four people. Two pounds of chicken and six cloves of garlic is a lot. Otherwise it was wonderful and I would definatley make it again.

Delicious and simple. Thanks for the cornstarch tip. I added shitake mushrooms with a very good result.

It's fine, but I still find using corn starch preferrable to flour. By dusting the chicken breast pieces first, it keeps them moister. The sauce has a prettier shine, as well. I tried it the first time with the flour and had to be careful it was cooked enough without burning. It's probably only a matter of taste and what you're used to, however.
