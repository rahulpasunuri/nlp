A great way to prepare radishes for the non-radish lover.

Terrific! But note that the radishes should be shredded on a box grater. Do not use a food processor to save time.... I found the texture unpleasant, and the radishes do not give off their liquid resulting in a watery spread after a short time.

I followed the recipe exactly, to the best of my ability. I loved the idea, but I am afraid the radishes in Europe are different than the ones in America. The finished product had a powdery, almost alum-like mouthfeel. I can't love a dish that makes my mouth feel funny. I guess this recipe just got lost in translation.

I agree with the previous review - just flavored cream cheese. I would not make it again.

I am sorry to go against the prevailing wisdom on this recipe, but I was rather disappointed by it. While it tasted fine and made a nice-enough presentation, the taste was hardly more than that of any flavored cream cheese. One day I will learn to be more skeptical of Epicurious recipes that feature cream cheese or sour cream as prominent ingredients!

Add this to your canape standards - it is wonderfully different, very tasty, and extremely cheap and easy. A real winner for corporate entertainment and large functions. I will use again!

These were surprisingly good and very well liked - once I convinced my guests to try them despite the pink color! Next time, I'll peel the radishes or consider using daikon radish instead. I also used scallion in place of chives, and probably a bit more than recipe called for. And as other reviewers previously noted -- you gotta have the rock salt just before serving.

Let me add my voice to the chorus of cooks raving about this recipe! What a simple, easy and tasty delight. I also used finely chopped green onions and topped with a radish slice and more onion. You couldn't ask for a more picture perfect presentation. Made it the night before and spread on pumpernickle triangles as guests arrived. Everyone loved them and kept asking for more. The texture made some ask if it was crab. And -hello!-sooo inexpensive! This is a great recipe! I will make this again and again.

This was a big hit at our spooky story party. I used finely chopped green onion instead of chives. The final sprinkling of coarse salt was a perfect topper. I served them on toasted squares of whole wheat rye. Will definetly make again.

Easy, unexpected, delicious. My guests were blown away and I couldn't have asked for an easier hors d'eouvre to make. and it's wonderful on any cracker, not just pumpernickle.

This is a delicious recipe. I like to add poppy seeds for additional crunch, flavor, and color contrast, and some minced fresh dill. My family and guests loved this.

I made these for my annual Bastille Day Sparklers Bash. Everyone raved about them! I used toasted coctail pumpernickel bread(cut diagonally), as I couldn't find the larger bread. I think it was just fine on this bread.

This was WONDERFUL! I served it at a small gathering, and it was truly a hit. I accidentally shredded my 12 radishes rather than reserving a few to garnish with, but was glad I did--by the time you squeeze the water out, there's not much left (make sure you squeeze them as dry as possible!). I had more radishes, so sliced a few of those for garnish. We served on thinly sliced French bread, which was also very good.

If you are tired of the same old hors d' oeurve, try this for a change of pace and taste. I love the radish taste, but usually it always seems to be in a salad. This spread on the toasted dark pumpernickel was great, and my guests gave it a four. I grated the radish, using my processor's finest shredder blade. Radishes do have a lot of water, so do not forget to squeeze the water out. This recipe is great for a nice crisp and fresh taste during any spring or summer gathering, and I am sure that it could be adapted (for example, stuff it in cherry tomatoes).
