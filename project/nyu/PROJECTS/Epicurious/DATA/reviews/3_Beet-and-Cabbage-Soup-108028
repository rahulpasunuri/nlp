This is wonderful! Typical borscht recipes are too sweet for me but the combination of flavors in this works very well. It was a hit for the adults but not the kids.

This was much better than I anticipated. Similar to Polish borscht in many ways (which uses vinegar and lemon juice to provide the accentuating tart flavor). I'm not sure I would have gone out of my way to make this, but I sure was glad to find this recipe when my CSA bag arrived with half a head of red cabbage, beets and jalapenos. Didn't have the celery so didn't include it. Ended up much better than expected. The cilantro adds a nice touch. Pretty good.

Delicious! Added more cabbage, cut the butter in half. Also, we did not puree the soup as we prefer the chunky aspect with the broth. Turned out delicious! Definitely a keeper!

This was very easy to make and tasted very good....I think. I liked the taste for the most part, but something was off to me. I have a feeling it was more due to not being used to that ingredient combination than not actually liking the taste. I used a regular onion instead of a red one, but stuck to the rest of the ingredient list. Next time I will try some of the substitutions the other reviewers suggested, and I bet I'll like it more.

This was a good soup. Nothing memorable though. A little sweet and the color was a bit odd. I added some cream instead of sour cream. Will I make it again? Maybe.

I needed to use my csa vegetables so added more cabbage, fewer beets, white instead of red onions, celery root instead of celery, several carrots, 2 Tbs hot peppers which gave it a nice bite (while I love spicy, I don't like it so hot it masks the other flavors), 4 c. organic low-sodium chicken broth diluted with a couple cups water, 3Tbs lime juice, and some fresh dill. Also added a quarter pound shiitake mushrooms (during simmer). I used my Cuisinart's slicing blade to chop everything (except the mushrooms) which saved a lot of time, especially during cooking. Simmered for 40 mins. and substituted olive oil for the butter during the saute. Also did not puree, which made it more like a borscht, and the color was just as beautiful. Delicious and easy!

Great easy soup. Made this since I had some leftover cabbage from the Farmer's Market. I roasted the beats a bit before addding to the other vegetables ont he stove. And I skipped the jalapeno. Cooking for a 4 year old. It also froze easily. Seems like a great recipe for salvaging summer fresh veggies and enjoying later when it's cold out.

Great recipe for an uncomplicated soup. The trick seems to be in getting just enough lime to balance but not overpower the sweet beets. I've tried skipping the sauteing step and throwing everything in raw. Comes out wonderful, believe it or not.

This is really delicious! I added about a tablespoon of cumin and garnished with cilantro. Both made a huge difference. Loved it!

Absolutely delicious. I also made with what I had on hand. Less beets, more cabbage. Green cabbage and white onion instead of red (the soup was still a beautiful bright pink), and I didn't de-seed the jalapeno because I like things a little spicy. My family and I loved it. A lovely way to start a meal.

Nice texture, great color, but the flavor is nothing to write home about. Seems like some herbs such as thyme or spices (which ones?) would help.

Oh Yum! I made this dish with what I had on hand - extra beets, lemon juice instead of lime juice, white onions and cabbage instead of red, and prepared crushed chilli instead of jalepenos. Gorgeous colour, great taste - very spicy! It took an hour and 45 minutes until the vegetables were "very tender" (during which time I added 2 cups of water), but that may have been b/c my veggie chunks were too large. I thinned it with another 2 cups of water after blending. yum!

This soup has an odd combination of flavors - earthy, sweet and sour - that I found really off-putting. Unfortunately, I ended up throwing out the entire batch. Proceed with caution on this one!

Made this again to my own rave reviews (so far). Subbed carrots for cabbage since I have so many. I put a couple of tubs in the freezer, but they won't last long......

Wow. This is a GOOD one. Used white cabbage instead of red. Next time I'll double the cabbage and add a bit more jalapeno for extra heat. Fried tortilla strips make a nicer touch than chips.

excellent and super easy recipe!

Great. The jalapeno gives it a nice kick. I would add a little vinegar at the end, though. Even in addition to the lime juice.

I made this soup with what we had on hand: more beets, less onions, and green rather than red cabbage. It was beautiful and delicious. A keeper.

I first ate this soupo at La Reposada in Cuernavaca. It was sooo good! I was thrilled to learn that the recipe was available here. The atmosphere is not as soothing here in Texas, but the soup is just delicious!
