This recipe tasted great eating it right away and a day later stored in fridge. I used dried mangoes, prunes and cherries, but imagine any combination of dried fruit would work. I also added a little lemon juice to the liquid to give it a little more kick.

I made this for a mid-week treat. Loved it. Next time I will not cut up the dried plums. Apricots and dried white peaches with yogurt are excellent.

I served this for New Years' Day breakfast with the Spinach-cheese strata from this site and got rave reviews. Particularly from the men, which kind of surprised me. I used Trader Joe's dried fruit mix and probably should have chopped the fruit up a bit. Other than that, this dish was excellent - it's relatively low in fat, it's easy, and the yogurt is a perfect topping and cuts the sweetness (and kind of makes the dish "healthy" - despite all the sugar!) I'm going to make it again as a compote for pan-fried quail - I'll probably increase the nutmeg and cinnamon to make it a bit more spicy.
