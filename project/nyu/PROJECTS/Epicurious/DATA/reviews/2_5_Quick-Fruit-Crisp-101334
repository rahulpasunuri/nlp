I followed the recipe and was very disappointed and so were others that ate it. It was not sweet enough and was way too much food for the pan. I made it again, but omited the pears and the apricots and I doubled the topping. The results were way better. The modified version will be a part of my recipe file.

This is delicious and it makes a large dessert, great for a crowd. I loved it and so did everyone I served it to. To be honest, I took it to a funeral luncheon, but the other food at the luncheon was delicious and there was lots of it, but still people dug into this dessert. It has a wonderful, fruity, sweet, crisp quality. I've added it to my "make often" files.
