Moist, gingericious, and a hit! I substituted cake flour which really improved the texture. The only thing that didn't come out as stated: the demerara sugar didn't make a lovely crust as the picture shows here.

Such a delicious cake. I didn't bother with the strawberries. The cake is so yummy on its own the strawberries aren't needed.

Terrific dessert and not a really difficult from-scratch recipe. The raw sugar encrusted sides of the cake were delicious and crunchy but didn't look like the photo. Easily served 20, a keeper! B.J. Harrick

Delicious, moist, relatively easy for a cake from scratch, and easily feeds 20 people. Certainly did not look like the photo but the crunchy taste of the raw sugar was effective. B.J. Harrick

This was delicious! I am always reducing fat and sugar, so I did not make it as written - I used 3/4 stick of butter and replaced the rest with applesauce, reduced the sugar to 1 & 1/4 cups, and substituted half of the flour with whole wheat. Oh, and used reduced fat sour cream. Still as moist and delicious as I had hoped,from reading other reviews, despite my changes. Also substituted some cinnamon, nutmeg, and cardamom for some of the ground ginger, added some grated fesh ginger, and made a dulce de leche (with nonfat condensed milk) to garnish. It is not always successful when I fuss with recipes for baked goods, but this was excellent! This one is a keeper.

I just made this cake and it was very good. I made caramel peppermint with fresh ginger sauce and it was awesome! Thank you very much for sharing the super delicious cake!

This is an exceptionally delicious cake which is not difficult to make. It is moist and flavorful with a great crust of carmelized sugar. To make it sparkle, I brushed it after baking with a simple sugar syrup made with ginger slices (1 cup sugar to 1 cup water, plenty of fresh ginger boil for 45 minutes or so). then I sprinkled it with coarse sparkling sugar which stuck well because of the syrup. It was really pretty and tasty.

It must be a great bday cake--I just made this for my sister for her birthday, since she's a big ginger fan! We both loved it! I followed the recipe as is, and loved the ginger- infused strawberries--I thought they complemented the cake wonderfully. The cake has a really bold ginger flavor and a fantastic creaminess (yes, due to the cup of butter, cup of sour cream, and nearly 5 eggs). As for the sugar on the outside, I'm fairly certain they must have pressed it on after baking for the photograph. Even without the sparkly look, the sugar forms a nice crust on the outside that's delicious. I'll definitely make this cake again, and won't change a thing-- loved it!

Made this because my brother loves crystallized ginger and it was his birthday. We loved the finish cake without the ginger infused strawberries, which overwhelmed cake. I used 1/2 buttermilk and 1/2 sour cream and the cake was great. I also reduced the sugar by 1/2cup to 1.5cups. I used a silicone flower shaped cake pan (not Bundt) and I had to bake it for an extra 15minutes or so until the center solidified. We expected little from this cake and it offered a lot. I also made an Almond Cornmeal Pound Cake with Mascarpone Filling, and the Ginger cake was the favorite. I loved the crystallized sugar on the edge of the cake. YUM! I would definitely make this again, but wouldn't bother with the ginger infused strawberries.

One of my favorite cake recipes, but needs a few alterations: I substitute whole-milk plain yogurt for the sour cream, which preserves the tang but lightens the cake up, I change the 2 sticks butter to about 1 stick butter and 1/3 cup oil for moisture, and I substitute fresh grated ginger for the ground ginger (which has virtually no flavor) (and then add an equivalent amount of flour). And I often omit the egg yolk. This seems to solve two problems: the heaviness of the cake (I mean... 2 sticks of butter AND sour cream AND eggs?!) and the blandness, which the fresh ginger fixes. Also, does anyone know how to get the sparkle effect? The sugar always melts into the cake...

Followed the recipe exactly - delicious. The "sparkle" effect didn't happen - the sugar melted exept around the rim. Not a big deal. I would double the syrup recipe next time in order to serve a slice of cake in a puddle of the soup with a dollop of whipped cream

i just loved this recipe I did change a few things I make this into a layer cake with a brown sugar maple italian cream frosting. I also only used 2 teaspoons of ground ginger and found a recipe for candied ginger to use thanks to a pastry chef on line..

Loved the flavor and texture, especially that it was light and fluffy inside but slightly crunchy and sugary on the outside. However, my crystallized ginger all ended up on the bottom (while baking, or in other words on the top after being turned out of the pan) so it ended up being a white cake with sort of a ginger "crust". Maybe I just didn't chop it finely enough. It also stuck to the pan despite my greasing the pan VERY generously.

This is an exceptional cake. We had it with two "bakery" desserts from a fabulous bakery and this was the first to be eaten--everyone came back for seconds. A winner!

So many good ingredients, but all together it tasted bland and was too heavy. I made it for 5 people and only 1 person finished their piece, how sad. The only good thing - a pretty cake, raw sugar on the outside is a good idea.

although this cake is moist and has a nice flavor ...it is nothing special.not worth the effort.

The recipe steps are out of order. Since the strawberries aren't needed until after the ginger syrup boils and cools, you can clean and slice strawberries after making the syrup. I did before, which left my strawberries a bit slimey.

Loved the ginger flavor, crunchy outer crust from the sugar, and really moist cake.

Made this Easter weekend. Loved it. Used a mixture of Crystallized candied and Uncrystallized candied ginger from Trader Joe's and both turned out nicely. Couldn't really tell the difference in taste, but speaks to adaptability if you have one around the house and looking to use up. Will definitely make again!

My daughter made this for our pre Easter feast. We are all ginger fans and were, not surprisingly, very enthusiastic in our response. The strawberries are an essential component, not only for color, but also for their complimentary taste.

I plan to make this today for Easter Dinner, tomorrow. If you are looking for great Crystallized Ginger try Penzeys at penzeys.com. They have the best quality spices. Their vanilla is amazing too.

Gorgeous and delicious, with a tender, light texture. Usually, Bundt cakes have a coarse texture I don't especially like. I agree that the cake is not as sparkly as the picture. I have an elaborate Bundt pan, and I was afraid that the cake would stick, but it turned out of the pan perfectly using the directions in the recipe. I get my crystallized ginger from Williams-Sonoma, which is a bargain compared to the supermarket spice section, and the ginger is tender and not fibrous.

Found an excellent and cheap source of crystallized ginger. Nuttyguys.com It was in my local grocery. Can be purchased on line. The texture is soft and the flavor wonderful. Have not taken the cake out of the oven yet. It was easy to get there.

Absolutely delicious! This cake has a lot of flavor and it is probably the most moist cake I've ever made. The crystallized ginger is a very strong flavor, so don't use all of it if you aren't sure about the flavor. The raw sugar on the outside gave the cake a wonderful crunch -- don't skip it. Easy to make, very delicious. Used 'light' sour cream with no problem.

This cake is great! You do need a lot of crystallized ginger, though--but instead of spending $40 on store-bought stuff, just make some yourself. Do a google search for it; it's really easy to do (and yummy!) and it makes for an excellent cake. Oh yeah, and the sugar is always going to caramelize on the outside--but it's no big deal, it's caramelly & cruchy and delicious!

Made cake yesterday, will serve tonight. Cake didn't come to top of pan, so with my fingers I scraped the sugar that was still on the side of pan & sprinkled it on top of cake. It stayed overnight. Just took a bite. There is a good crunch, strawberries are wonderful & may serve with some (optional) whipped cream. To heck with calories when you have company! Also great for brunch or tea time.

I am making this cake today for the second time. It is much easier to make if the cryistallized ginger is not hard. I buy it in bulk from Whole Foods, and it is very easy to chop. Don't cut it small. I used a mix of fat free sour cream and fat free yogurt and it turned out great. I will add more powdered ginger. I was not impressed with the ginger infussed strawberries, we liked the plain cake better.

Crystalized ginger is available at Trader Joes. However, I was not impressed with the cake. Nice texture, but no life. Needed something to play aganst the ginger. Also, although I butttered the pan well, and went heavy on the raw sugar, the cake did not glisten as it did in the picture. You had to "look" to see the ginger and it gave the cake a crust which you do not usually find on a cake. Too many better recipes out there. Would not make again

I haven't tried this yet, but looks great!! This is a note to tell you where to get crystalized ginger super cheap! If any of you reading this are SDA or Seventh-Day Adventist then you know what the ABC is. For those of you that aren't and I'm guessing that's most of you the ABC is the Adventist Book Center. They sell it in either .5 lb or 1 lb bags for less than 3 dollars, as opposed to at least $9 at your regular grocery store. You can get locations for the ABC online. Just thought I get this info out there for people looking for cheap, crystalized ginger!

This was a huge hit at a small dinner party, and equally loved at a potluck the next night. It's extremely rich...I agree with spidey that both the cake and the syrup were a bit too sweet for my taste, but not for others. In any case, I'd reduce the sugar by at least 1/4 cup for the cake, and put some lemon juice in the syrup just to give the infused ginger back its edge. People loved the fact that I didn't chop up the ginger too finely; some slices had large chunks of ginger that added texture and tang.

I made this cake to take to friends' house. We all enjoyed it. I had about 3/4 c. of crystallized ginger on hand, so maybe it didn't have all the intense ginger it would have had with a cup. I loved the crusty sugar coating on top. We also liked the strawberries with it; however I would use more ginger for the infusion. I loved using one of my pretty bundt pans. I will definitely make this again just to use a full cup of the crystallized ginger.

Tracy6530, this is the reviewer from Orange County....thanks for the info on crystallized ginger. It's good to know. Also, for others: a friend of mine (who loved this cake) found affordable ginger at Trader Joe's.

This cake was excellent, lots of ginger flavor. My cake wasn't done at 55 minutes so it baked more like 60 minutes. The raw sugar for the most part baked into the cake but it gave the outside a nice texture the complemented to the moist dense inside.

This cake was ok. A little too sweet. I liked the strawberries, I would probably use a little less sugar in the syrup as well.

This cake was easy and excellent - moist, tender, and flavorful. The strawberries were good but did not enhance the cake. The strawberries would have been better on ice cream. I will do the cake and the strawberries again but not to serve together.

While I have not tried this recipe myself, I did want to offer a comment about the ginger being an expensive ingredient. I tend to cook with ginger quite frequently and found the crystallized ginger to be expensive, as previously mentioned. The spice section in your typical grocery carries a small amount for a big price. I wanted to pass on that I have found crystallized ginger in my organic section of my regular grocery store that is in a 18 oz bag under the name of "Reeds". It's crystallized with raw cane sugar which is why I guess it's considered organic but it's the same thing that you would find in the little spice jar and costs way less. I have found it in the baking section within the organic section and also by the speciality drinks, i.e. natural root beer, ginger beer. So, it's worth a look around your store and just wanted to pass along my own experience.

I loved this cake, as did my supper guests ( included one who claimed not to be a fan of ginger and then came back for seconds). The cake came out beautiful and moist. The raw sugar made the cake slightly "sparkle" and gave the outer layer another dimension (both in texture and taste). The ginger infused strawberries were just right for this.

I thought this cake would be a good one to bring to an upcoming event. I tried it out yesterday to mixed results. My cake was not nearly as pretty as the one in the photo. The raw sugar got absorbed into the cake instead of sticking to the cake's exterior. The overall taste of it is good. It's light and moist for a bundt cake. I found the crystallized ginger a bit overpowering. It also was an expensive ingredient. The recipe calls for 1 cup of it, chopped. I paid $8 for a 2-oz jar at my local grocery store. The ginger-infused strawberries were a nice touch. I liked them; my husband did not. If you really love the flavor of ginger (and I like it, not love it), you will enjoy this cake. As for me, I'm going to keep looking for a dessert recipe for the party.
