This has been a favourite of my family for many years. I make it exactly as the recipe states and it is perfect. Sometimes I add some fresh kale or spinach right before serving. My family likes to grate fresh parmesean cheese on it.

This recipe is surprisingly delicious for the few ingredients used. Very easy and simple to throw together on a weeknight, and quite satisfying! I halved the recipe, used a 32 ounce carton of low sodium chicken stock, and cooked the pasta with the beans and sausage. As expected, the pasta absorbed most of the liquid. It was still delicious for lunch the next day. Just added a splash of water and heated it in the microwave.

A simple stand-by that my entire family loves. I've substituted different types of sausage (hot italian, sweet italian, turkey sausage) and it's always tasted great.

This is a great soup/stew that I make often. I add more beans (red kidney) and spinach at the end and yes you need more liqiud. It is so flavorful the next day for leftovers I just add water when reheating. The flavors are awesome and its a hearty winter meal that is easy!

Great recipe, but I would recommend cooking the pasta separate and adding it as you eat the soup. I made the soup last night and it tasted great, but today it is a big mess of pasta with precious little broth.

This soup was absolutely delicious! I did not puree a can of chickpeas (garbanzos) (my youngest reacted to lentils and I didn't know whether she would to chickpeas - preferred to keep them whole). Instead of using 2 cans, I substituted one with black beans. Also, next time I would not cook the pasta with the soup because it soaked up the broth and ended up more like a stew. Had to add more broth to the leftovers. This is such a hearty soup and quick to make if you don't have time. Highly recommended!

I love, love, love this recipe! I use northern white beans instead of garbanzo beans, add a little cayenne pepper, spinach, and use mini cavatappi noodles. Sometimes I will add a splash of red wine too to give it a little earthiness. I'm making it tonight!

Love it! Helpful hints: 1/8 to 1/4 volume of chick peas can be replaced with Cannelini beans to make liquid more hardy. Double the red pepper flakes. Grill the sausages for more smokey, crispy chunks. Any type of kielbasa or sausage is fine; hot Italian is excellent. Chicken or vegetable stock both work Titrate intensity and texture by adding stock and blending with a hand-held blender in steps. Stores frozen very well except for pasta absorbing too much liquid; If you have the inclination, it's best to keep pasta seperate for portions that will be frozen and eaten later. Finish with spinach for more

I just made this and it was wonderful even on a hot summer night! I did make a few modifications to suit our tastes. I followed the suggestion of others and only used 1 cup of pasta, sliced turkey kielbasa instead of sausage, kidney beans (canned, rinsed) instead of chickpeas, 1/2 tsp of dried rosemary plus 1 tsp each of chili powder, cumin, paprika, thyme, ground coriander and oregano. I also added some black pepper. Instead of chicken broth I used vegetable broth. I didn't puree any of it and it was pretty thick thanks to the beans and pasta. I served it with some crusty bread, which was delicious dipped in the soup.

Rating: 4
I thought this was really good. I did make modifications. I can't stomach the thought of cooking with that gross stuff that the beans are canned in. I even rinse it off the beans, so I pureed the beans with 3/4 cup water. Then I used hot ital turkey sausage and only a tsp. oil. I used 6 cans of stock/broth and a cup of water. Also, at the end I threw in some fresh baby spinach that I had sliced up for some color. Next time I might use swiss chard. Definately use the orrichiete (sp?) because it is hearty and wont overcook easily. Really yummy!!

Followed the recipe...but interestingly, found it too SOUPY rather than too thick - even after a fairly extensive simmer - did a quick puree with the immersion blender to get the a better texture. Would probably increase the crushed red pepper next time as I like things a bit more spicy. A good 'meal in a bowl' and even better the next day.

This soup was perfect for a cold winter day. I confused the amount of pureed garbanzo beans, but it made no difference. Other reviewers said the soup was too thick with only 5 cups of broth, so I used 7. I would 1 or 2 more next time. Regardless, the flavor was great.

Rating: 3
If you increase servings on this recipe, and are making the soup ahead of time, do not add the pasta until you warm up the rest of the ingredients the second time. I made the soup early in the day, then reheated it, and the pasta got too bloated and doughy, but the recipe was still very good.

This was outstanding and pretty simple to prepare. I backed off the pasta per other reviewers' suggestions and it was just right. I used quality sausage and might consider adding a little fennel next time...and there WILL be a next time.

Too much pasta, seriously. I read reviews, cut the pasta to 2 cups, added at least 4 more cups stock and it's till too much- next time I'll try just a cup or maybe 3/4 cup. Besides that, this soup is DELICIOUS, I love the little bit of tomato and the spicyness of the sausage. I added some spinach at the end too. My man put it in his top 5 and I make a lot of soup. This will become a staple in our house.

Rating: 3
We really liked the flavor of this soup but it was too thick. It had very little liquid to make it soup-like and the leftovers were all pasta! Also, the garbanzo beans did not puree very well. I think they are too hard. Next time I will cook the pasta separately (and less of it) and make only enough for one meal.

Rating: 4
I thought that this soup was very filling, and super good! I agree that the chickpeas should be rinsed if you are looking to reduce the saltiness. I also agree that the liquid needs to be increased as orecchiette takes a lot of liquid. I accidentally pureed the entire can of chickpeas, and it was still good! Next time, I'll add basil instead of rosemary, although that was good as well. Didn't have any Romano, just Parmesan, but that also worked.

i love the taste, but 8oz. of pasta by weight really overwhelmed the dish. I ended up using approx. 7 cups of liquid just to make somewhat soupy. I would make this again and just adjust the amt of pasta.

We really liked the flavour of this soup but it turned out WAY too thick - there was no broth at all, it was just pasta. I used orzo - maybe that's what caused the problem?? Anyway, next time I'll cut back the pasta to 3/4 cup and see if that leaves some broth. I also used only one 19oz can of chick peas, which seemed plenty to me. And I think next time I'll add some celery and carrot as well.

Anyone who cooks Italian has all of these ingredients in their pantry/freezer. Or some that will comply. While it's best the 2nd day, it's great for last minute company. We all keep salad supplies, the soup items, & I always have 1/2 loaf of crusty bread in the freezer. Dessert? I'm not always so good about that. Well--if none, offer a 2nd bowl of soup.

Very tasty and packs a hearty wallop on a cold night. I used whole wheat pasta in this soup, which I like and which I prefer for nutritional reasons. The smallest kind I could find was a little bigger than the pasta called for--but I thought the texture and taste worked well with the flavors in the soup. I did need to add more stock. Will definitely make again.

We make this recipe all winter and just love it. If you double it you get enough for a large crowd for a nice casual meal. I often use turkey or chicken sausage. I also use campanelle (sp?) for the pasta which I believe is a larger pasta and makes the dish even heartier than it already is....why it's such a favorite of my husband. To simplify since this is my fast, mid-week, too tired to cook meal, I use dried herbs - often thyme instead of rosemary (as I don't like dried rosemary). I serve with Jiffy brand corn muffins! They remind me of my childhood and I just love them! Enjoy!

I made this soup with Cannelini beans instead of chickpeas and did not puree them as they are such a soft bean and broke down in the soup anyway. This soup was quite spicy and flavorful. If you drain and rinse the beans it cuts down on the salt considerably. Overall, a very tasty and different soup.

This is a great recipe. I only made a few changes and made a double batch which I am very happy about since it is delicious! I left the sausage in its casing and sliced it rather than chopping it up (cooking it before adding it to the pot). I also added spinach, kidney beans and carrot both for flavor and color. I used about 1/4 the cheese suggested, and less pasta too. It makes for great leftovers. It is a crowd pleaser indeed!

Beddy beddy good!! As with just about anything, I doubled the garlic, and added to the red pepper, due to the relativly mild "hot" italian sausage. The flavor of the chickpeas is very evident and adds an earthiness to the dish. Very easy to adjust and customize to personal tastes.

I made it the first time as the recipe reads, and it was delicious. I thought inorder to make it a little healthier, the next time I made this, I would try ground turkey instead of the sausage. Well, let's face it, sausage is sausage, it was good once I added more red pepper flakes and rosemary though. So next time, and there will be a next time, I'll try turkey sausage, or at least half ground turkey and half sausage. But my review of this recipe as is: Great tasty stick-to-your-ribs dish!

Rating: 3
Has just the right amount of bite on the tongue. Pasta absorbes most of the broth. Recommend 6-7 cups of broth. Fresh basil adds to the rich flavor.Add a can of broth to leftovers if you want to maintain the soup consistancy. Really enjoyed it---but then again I love peasant food.

This is delicious, but it almost turns into stew instead of soup on standing. I used one can chickpeas and one can lima beans and pureed half of each can. I also used spicy mexican pork sausages and added 250ml V8 juice and a can of chilli diced tomatoes. I would suggest using less pasta because it really does soak up all the liquid. Will defiitely make his again.

I'm in a "clean out the pantry and use what you've got" phase and this filled the bill. I substituted those small smoked sausages some serve on hors d'ouvres buffets (my husband loves to use coupons)and chipotle chile powder instead of chili flakes and it's a keeper! Easy and fast prep puts it on our week-night list of regulars. Delicious.

Rating: 2
The flavors were good. However, I used orecchiette pasta and the didn't separate for one another...so as a result, I had almost balls of pasta (once they heated, the "little ears" stuck together even more!). I certainly make sure that the pasta was in distinct pieces before adding OR maybe try another small pasta (one that wouldn't have the tendency to do this). ONE IMPORTANT NOTE: I froze the leftover soup. The pasta must have super-absorbed the liquid because once thawed, this was incredibly thick, with the pasta super-chewy (see note above). We actually had to discard the leftovers because we just couldn't eat them.

I found this recipe looking for something to do with garbanzo beans. I was skeptical - it just didn't sound that good to me - but I was persuaded by the positive reviews. It turned out to be a great family week-night item. I also used "Gimme Lean" sausage substitute. As a result, it was a fabulous low-fat protein dish. One note: If you want this to be soup-like, it takes far more broth than the recipe specifies. My batch turned out more like a chili.

I read all the reviews and did the following: I added minced onion, carrot and celery (since that is all I had on hand) to the sausage saute with 4 cloves of garlic (rather than the called for 2).

I found the soup to be too thick. I added an extra cup of chicken broth but it didn't help much. My problem may have been the chickpea puree. I did more than the recommended cup.

Made this last night for my sausage-loving husband; he declared it officially added to his list of favorites! I increased the garlic to 4 cloves and the crushed red pepper to 1 tsp, as we like spicy.

I'm glad I read and heeded the reviews here regarding the rosemary. I decided to just use dried and used about 5 teaspoons crushed. It was still quite a bit of rosemary, but not overpowering. I also used fresh parmesean cheese instead of romano, I don't know how much of a difference it makes, but that works fine, and it is even good without cheese, but the cheese rounds it out nicely.

I don't care for spicy foods, so I substituted cheese and parsley sausage for the spicy sausage. I used regular chicken broth. I loved the texture of thepasta and the beans and the way the pasta held the sauce. It could no longer be called a soup by the time I ate it. I made it early in the day and ate it in the afternoon. By that time, the liquid became very thick. It was more like a very saucy pasta dish. It was still good.

Have made this dish twice- and it's a hit each time. We aren't too big on spicy so I have substituted different flavored sausages (such as Garlic-Artichoke) along with Italian stewed tomatoes instead of the tomato paste. Great either way

This was a fantastic soup, but the sausage was spicy enough that I wouldn't add the crushed red pepper next time. Otherwise, a wonderful recipe!

My family enjoyed this soup. I used spicy Italian turkey sausage. To avoid the pasta soaking up all the soup, I just added the pasta to our bowls just before serving. Delicious with biscuits.

Excellent soup! Decreased the pasta a bit and still turned to almost a stew. Great snow day soup.Will definitely be a keeper.

My wife and I just loved this soup. As some of the other cooks recommended, I cut down some on the rosemary. I used a bit less oil and chicken sausage cut create a low fat dish. I used less pasta (orzo) and the soup was still quite thick. This is a keeper!

This soup was a hit with my family! I have to admit I was skeptical about using the liquid from the garbanzo beans due to the high sodium content, but the broth was great and not salty at all. Going from past reviews, I did reduce the rosemary to 3 tsp. and increased the chicken broth to 8 cups. I also increased the tomato paste to 1 (6 oz.) can. I would also add some dried thyme next time I make it. My husband liked this reciped better than another sausage and chick pea soup I regularly make during the winter. Mushrooms and green peppers would also be great additions!

This is an amazing soup! I used chicken sausage instead of Italian sausage and pureed all the chickpeas, since I am not a big fan of whole chickpeas and increased the stock. Since I cannot tolerate gluten, I added a little rice in lieu of pasta. The final result was wonderful. The garlic, chili flakes and rosemary combine beautifully to make a deliciously tasting soup. Add Romano and mmmmm!! I am telling everybody about this soup! Definitely a keeper!

A great rainy day soup. I used about half the rosemary and drained the sausage after it was browned. This cut down on the grease factor. Everyone in my family loved it. Even my 2 teenage sons and, also, my wife who won't eat anything with beans in it (I told her they were chick peas). A new family favorite!

Very good. I love rosemary but still felt that it was a bit overpowering - would cut down just a bit. Also agree to use less pasta, unless you want more of a stew than soup. Used regular italian sausage instead of the hot and found the heat to be just right with just the red pepper flakes.

I loved this recipe! Even my husband, who doesn't really like Garbanzos, loved it. I added some chopped mushrooms, 1 bunch of chopped Kale, and a splash of some red wine.

What a great soup! I used hot Italian sausage and it was GREAT! I did notice that the pasta sucked up all the broth, though so I'm thinking next time I'll make the pasta separately and then add it to each bowl of soup...that way I'll have more broth. My neighbors loved it as well! I will definately make it again! :-)

My mother made this soup this week, and all of us--soup and non-soup people--LOVED IT. We used about half the amount of pasta because we used a small tubettini that always packs itself into the measuring cup. We didn't have as much heat with the sweet sausage, but for those who are wary of spicy foods, the sweet is an excellent choice. Overall, for two discriminating soup lovers like my father and I, it was a DELICIOUS experience. (And it's just as wonderful reheated.)

I, too, found there was either too much pasta, or too little broth. I added extra broth and ended up with a huge pot of soup. I used orzo, which may have made the difference. I also added diced squash and a can of diced tomatoes. Very filling - but good.

I found the pasta ate up a lot of the moisture and that the "broth" was a little bland, especially versus the sausage. I would add some flavor to the liquid part of the soup either via tomato sauce, a dash of worsheshire, or perhaps some more chicken broth. I would also cut back slightly on the rosemary. Even with all of that said, I still think the soup is good!!!

This is very much like a soup I've made many times in the past. I use white navy beans and also add pepperoni cut in small chunks. It's one of my dad's favorites.

Fantastic! We loved this recipe. It was easy and fun to make. This recipe was delicious as written, and 'tho we didn't use all the cheese called for, and didn't add any salt or pepper, we thought the soup was delectable and we will make it again and again!

This was delicious. Easy to make and will become a real favorite at my house. I added a 14 ounce can of diced tomatoes, and took the suggestion of adding zucchini, very good! A real warmer upper in the non stop rain.

FABULOUS! Delicious!! The ONLY change that I would make is not using the pasta suggested. Because of it's size the pasta became a bit "mushy". I would use one like a penne. I also did not add the hot pepper flakes as I thought the Hot Italian sausage would be Hot enough for my two girls. It was. The whole family loved it and I would most definitely make it again, only adding the hot pepper flakes for an adult evening. I hope you enjoy it as much as we did.

Fast, easy, great hardy and filling soup. My kids enjoyed it too ! Used hot turkey sausage and parmigiano reggiano instead of romano.

Great, my husband loved it! I used a lowfat spicy chicken sausage which brought the calories down a bit.

I make a similar recipe with hot and sweet sausage. try adding tomatoes and zucchini as well as carrots. Almost anything you want to add will enhance the flavor.. You can use orzo or any other small pasta. ENJOY it's one of my family's favorites!

You could use any type of bean you preferred. Great Northern or Italian beans would be good.

Any suggestions for alternatives to the chickpeas? I would like to make this soup, but am not a fan of that type of bean!

This is a very fast, easy, and a fire house favorit. You can make this dish as hot or mild as you want by adding more red pepper or not using it at all. Other types of sausages make for a differnt tast every time. We prefer to make our Spicy Pasta "CODE 3".
