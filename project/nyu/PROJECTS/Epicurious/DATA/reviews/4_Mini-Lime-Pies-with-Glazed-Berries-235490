An interesting and eye-appealing twist on a traditional favorite. Not sure I would make it often, but it is worth a try.

I was short on time, so I used a refrigerated crust in a 9" tart pan and prebaked it. I added the curd and chilled for a couple of hours. I spooned the berries on top when I served it. It was delicious. A definite "keeper"!

Impressive and delicious. Though I prepared it exactly as describe and it turned out perfect, I'm not sure I'd fuss with making the pastry rounds next time. I might just assemble it all as as a lime curd tart with berries. Blueberries alone would be just fine. The lime curd was dreamy.

An excellent make ahead dessert. I substituted lemon for the lime and I made things even simpler by purchasing frozen pastry. I used only blueberries and dusted the assembled pies with icing sugar before serving. Watch the timing on baking the pastry rounds - mine took only 5 - 7 minutes. A brule torch is definitely required to caramelize the sugar. Beautiful, light and tangy.

We made this for a special summer dinner party, and it absolutely made the evening. Well worth the effort. The lime curd was so perfectly tangy and the presentation was gorgeous. We served it with a tiny scoop of homemade rosemary lemon sorbet and berry scattered around the plate.

I made this as a finishing touch to a lovely lime-themed dinner (see Chilled Carrot Soup with Cumin and Lime and Salmon with Lime Butter Sauce), and each element was a huge hit. I was cooking for 7 so there were only 2 cookie layers per person, but that ended up being a good thing because they were a little hard to cut into. Each assembly was beautiful and inspired many compliments. My grandmother (who eats like a bird) had two, but it was not a hit with my 10-year-old cousin. Overall a definite keeper... just give yourself plenty of time to prepare (each step is pretty simple, but together it takes a while).

A bit hit! The dish is really beautiful as well as tasty. I'm making it again tonight.
