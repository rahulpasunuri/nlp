This is definitely a good platform, but needs some tweaking. I found the gelato's texture more like an iced milk and when frozen, it got pretty solid. I had to leave it out at room temp for about 20 minutes so I could scoop it into the puffs. Maybe next time I would use half cream, half 1/2 & 1/2? Then, when I made these puffs, the dough didn't seem right (it was runny), but I baked it anyway. Total disaster. So I found a recipe with good reviews and used that instead (Profiteroles with Caramel Sauce). They came out marvelously. The sauce is great, no complaints. Everything tasted great together and it got raves at dinner. But one word of warning: this is murder on sensitive teeth!

Since I didn't have any hazelnuts on hand, I used roasted pignola nuts. This was delicious! I will try hazelnuts for a comparison next time. Hint: the pignola nuts roast fast, so keep aneye on him.

Only made the profiteroles. SO easy. Now I keep a batch frozen all the time so I can reheat and serve with a scoop of ice cream whenever the urge strikes.

I only made the gelato - I was specifically looking for a hazelnut gelato recipe where the nuts are not strained out because I like the texture they add. This was quite good, although not as rich and creamy as I'd hoped. I might try substituting cream + whole milk for the half & half and/or increasing the number of egg yolks. I'll also try the profiteroles and sauce next time.

I wish I could rate the parts of this recipe separately because some were outstanding and others less so. First, the gelato had great flavor but in the end I didn't like the grittiness of the nuts left in the mixture. Most other gelato recipes for hazelnut gelato strain out the nuts before freezing and I think I would have liked the gelato better if it had the traditional creamy texture. Second, the ceam puff part was fine. Solid recipe, nothing exceptional. But last, the sauce was excellent. True, it is little more than chocolate, cream, and Kahlua, but then again, what is not to like. I have made the sauce again and shared it with friends as a hostess gift. It is wonderful. Beware - -the recipe makes a ton of it.
