This was mediocre at best. I would not say completely unedible, but I found that I had to do a lot of doctoring to the dish before I could serve it guests. I'd suggest using roasted tomatos instead of tomato puree.

Wash down with champagne??? ... you've GOT to be kidding.

It wasn't bad, but the combination of spices didn't thrill me at all. They were a bit strange tasting to me. I wouldn't make it again. However, since it was such an easy and quick preparation, I would consider using this method again with a different combination of spices.

If I could give this a negative rating, I would. It was pretty icky.

this is a great recipe... take the medallions out of the pan immediately after they brown (or they'll get tough) We used cous cous instead of pasta.

Nice. Add a little (4 Tbsp) Marsala for sauce and garnish with fresh cilantro. Wash down with champagne. Nice!
