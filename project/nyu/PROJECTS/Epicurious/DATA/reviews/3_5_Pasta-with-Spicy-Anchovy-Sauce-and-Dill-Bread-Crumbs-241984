As written, I'm guessing this recipe might be lacking. But add about four cloves of garlic and then quadruple the amount of anchovies and red pepper flakes, caramelize the onions and then you have a 4-star dish.

Fabulous! My husband remembered this as the cover to a 2008 Gourmet, so we found the back issue (I save them all!) and tried it. It was great! He added a couple of cloves of garlic to the bread crumbs in the food processor- excellent flavor! As we are both spicy cooks, my husband also added more red pepper flakes. Will definately try the suggestions of additional anchovies and capers the next time as an alternative. Excellent meal!

This is a great recipe. It's easy to make and the combination of flavors works well. I used both yellow and red onions and dried dill and it was still good. I don't understand how people can use words like "sick" and "disgusting" to describe food. Shame on you! You call yourself a cook? You have such a long way to go!

This is a potentially great pasta recipe, provided you love chili peppers and anchovies, of course. But don't kid me, ONE 2 ounce can of anchovies for a Pound of pasta? No way, quadruple the anchovies, at least. Also, be careful that your onions don't get burned, 14 minutes is a long saute. Great mix, though!

We loved this. I didn't have dill so I used fresh thyme. I froze the extra non-toasted bread crumbs and made the fried mozzarella cheese salad (Gormet July 08)

I love this recipe. I use less oil and more pasta water. The crumbs are great and I keep some to toss on top of other dishes.

We had a family dinner of six this afternoon. We absolutely enjoyed it and licked the bowl clean. The keys to our good experience were: fresh dill, hearty buccatini, well cooked onions and crunchy bread crumbs. Next time we're going to add more anchovies and crushed red pepper.

I've been married 15 years and my husband has loved everything I've ever cooked...until I made this! How all those yummy ingredients (and following the recipe exactly) could end up being such a pile of blah is beyond me. We fed it to the dog--and he liked it, but what does he know?! Luckily, we're still married....

This recipe held up great with whole wheat pasta. It deepened the flavors perfectly. I will absolutely make this pasta again.

This was a great and easy dish. I pared it down for two and didn't use all of the bread crumbs. Make sure you let them geat nice and dark and crispy. Also, carmelize the onions so they are very sweet. Oh, use fresh dill, it makes all the difference.

SICK!! This recipe has all the right ingredients but is horrible. I think if you put it together differently it might be good but following this recipe will leave you with a bready soggy thick messy. I read the bad reviews and still subjected my BF to it. He didn't break up with me ...

This was a very tasty dish. I kind of wished for a bit more anchovy impact. So next time I will add more anchovy. Overall, the flavor combination worked well and my guests enjoyed it very much.

This was really delicious. I read all of the reviews before making it, and was a little nervous, since it was so split. But it turned out to have a really lovely texture and refined, delicate flavor. I think the key is to use the freshest and best ingredients (dill, breadcrumbs, etc). You also need to toast the breadcrumbs until they are good and crispy, even if it takes longer. And the onions should be nearly caramelized. I also recommend using the salt cured anchovies, as a cook mentioned above. Nice flavor. The texture of the long tube pasta is also important, I think, so try to find it. We'll definitely make this one again.

Although this recipe was on the cover of Gourmet magazine, it just wasn't good enough to make again. Fresh dill and anchovy are a good flavor combination, but the breadcrumbs were completely out of place. It was blah.

We loved this. The crunchy breadcrumbs, the sweetness of the onions, and the subtle salty anchovy flavor...YUM! Great combination, and all parts essential. And so quick and simple! I did grate some parmesan on top before eating, and I think this worked well too. I would definitely make again and again.

I made this for dinner tonight and my husband and I both liked it a lot. Next time I would add about twice the hot pepper flakes and half the oil (to sautee the onions), but other than that I thought it was great.

This was simply amazing. I do not ever use anchovies as they rather frighten me, but I loved the way the savory anchovies balanced the sweet red onion. Yum. Can't wait to make it again!

Absolutely the worst! No flavor and all those bread crumbs! I adjusted the amount and even added more liquid for sauce but still gross. It's not even worth one fork! Are the measurements off??

This was absolutely awful. Tasteless. When visiting my sister, I saw the April issue of Gourmet on the kitchen counter. I mentioned how I made the cover recipe, and thought it was very disappointing. She laughed, and said they had made it the night before and ended up throwing it away.

The dill flavor really came through, very tasty and satisfying. Didn't have red onion, so I used shallots and also always use salt- cured anchovies for a more subtle taste.

I made this recipe last night, and it prompted me to post a review for the first time. Unfortunately it's because it is so very disgusting!!! I've been cooking for my husband for 10 years, and this was the first and only time he actually would not eat what I made. I don't blame him, I couldn't stomach it either. I even read the other reviews and put in a little extra anchovy and red pepper, and it was still terrible. I rate this recipe One Spoon, to gag myself with. GROSS!

Not bad. I majorly adjusted things, but kept the whole concept the same. No onions, just sauteed garlic and 6 anchovy filets in oil w/ crushed red pepper. Toasted breadcrumbs and tossed with dill and lemon zest. Pared it down to serve 2. Would make it again!

Very good, though I find this is condiment for 4 servings, rather than 6.

Enjoyed it as a light lunch. Next time I will also double the anchovies and add capers.

I was surprised how the dill and onions echoed each other flavorwise with the anchovies adding a subtle hint of saltiness. If you really like anchovies, add more to the dish.

I followed the recipe exactly. My family thought the flavors were too subtle to satisfy for a main course. Next time I would use two 2 oz. tins of anchovy fillets and increase the red pepper flakes to 3/4 teaspoon.
