Delicious--even with half the sugar and no frosting. Makes 6 regular-size cupcakes.

These were very good. The kids loved them as well. I used 1/2 whole wheat, 1/2 white flour. I would test the mini-muffin tin times yourself. I found 15:00 was too long and overcooked them. Probably start testing at 11-12 minutes for doneness.

I made these this morning for my toddlers. I love that they are not too sweet and a healthy alternative to most muffins (I consider these more of a muffin than a cupcake). The kids will eat them unfrosted, but they are good enough to serve with frosting to the grown ups. I made my own oat flour with a food processor. I plan to make a second batch to throw in the freezer.
