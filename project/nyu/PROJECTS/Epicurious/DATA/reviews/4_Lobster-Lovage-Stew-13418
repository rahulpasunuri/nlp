This is an all time favorite. Using lovage (which grows very easily in an herb garden or in a pot) does make a difference. Also, you need not boil with huge quantities of water and then reduce. I extract the meat, then use the reserved shells, covering with just enough liquid to make the broth. Also makes a great stock base for seafood stew.

I agree that this is a very good recipe. I added a bit of roux to thicken to what I felt was a bit more of a "stew-like" consistency. I was also unable to find Lovage. Having never used Lovage before, I can't say that the recipe suffered from its absence, but I would be interested in including it in future attempts.

Wonderful!! It was 1 of the best soups/stews I have ever had. Labor intensive because of having to reduce the stock but well worth the reward. For the chopped tomatoes you might want to try and roast fresh tomatoes in the oven for 1/2 hr. then ad them to the chopped carrots & shallots, roasting will sweeten the tomatoes.

This stew is fantastic! I made 1/3 the recipe for my husband and I as a main course and it was a perfect quantity. I couldn't fine lovage leaves in fact the produce managers had never heard of them so I used celery leaves and the flavor was fantastic. When I make it again, I will make another attempt to find lovage leaves to see if there is a difference. This is definitely a starter to impress guests!!

This stew is outrageously excellent. We have done it twice and the first time I was unable to find lovage so substituted celery leaves. It worked just fine, although the lovage is most definitely superior. It is quite a project...I like to do the initial broth a day in advance and finish off the same day as serving. Most enjoyable!!

The final outcome was superb -- my first time making a dish like this. It took 6 hours for the broth to reduce though, so it became a multi-day endeavour. Well worth it!

Not as hard to prepare as first thought seafood lovers will love this dish
