I agree with cutting the garlic in half. Also to use yellow & serrano chillies to add more of a kick

Made this for a Cinqo de Mayo party and it was a big hit. I couldn't bring myself to put in 10 cloves of raw garlic, so I roasted it first. Will definitely make again, but will probably chop everything by hand next time. Wasn't thrilled with the consistency of the food processor.

This has become a constant request at the Fire House. I end up making a batch the first shift of every cycle. As always, better a day or two later. Modified it at bit though. Cut the garlic in half, added some diced green onions and doubled the stewed tomatoes. Also used 3 jalapenos, 3 serranos, and 3 yellow chilies. Gave it a bit of heat...Fireman, go figure.

I've made this several times for parties or what not, tried others and they don't compare. I always double it at first and split it so I can have mine a bit milder and then my hubby can have his spicier with an added extra Jalenpeno pepper with the seeds and a habenero pepper...yikes!

I have made this salsa several times and have gotten great reviews. I changed a few things - like the degree of heat, and I cut down on the garlic. But otherwise it is great! The combination of flavours goes really well together.

I wasn't really wowed by this recipe. I would suggest taking it easy with the cilantro. A bunch is a relative term and I used too much. I don't know why but this salsa is brown in color and it didn't look apetizing to me. Maybe it was the cilantro?

this salsa didn't really turn out for me for some reason. i guess it wasn't really what i was expecting in a salsa.

I was told, after making this, that it was the best salsa ever. I had no choice but to tweak the ingredients, but only slightly. Due to the fact that I visited a very limited grocery store in a very small town on my trip to obtain the ingredients, I had to substitute fresh cilantro with dried, and fresh jalepenos with the bottled-pickled sort. This was a quick, easy, and amazingly flavourful salsa. I daresay that I will never buy the store-brand kind again. This was not only good on its own with tortilla chips, but added just the right amount of kick as an ingredient to a mexican chicken entree that we served at the same time. You MUST try this, folks, you won't be disappointed...and although the recipe yeilds 8 cups, you won't be left with a whopping bowl of leftover salsa...especially if preparing this for a crowd. Bravo!!

Made this for a party & almost every single person there asked for the recipie. It's the best salsa I've ever had. I've tried it without the canned tomatoes, just using fresh and it loses something. There is something perfect about the combination of ingredients. We have noticed that we have to adjust the jalapenos according to their heat. We're fairly inexperienced at jalapenos so it was news to us that their heat can vary. We loved the garlic & as long as everyone has some no one will notice! The lemon & lime juices seem to be essential too. I've tried with one or the other and it's just not quite perfect. Best salsa in the World!!

This is the best salsa I've ever tasted. Every gathering I go to I make this and everyone raves about it. I did cut down the garlic after the 2nd time I made it. I will never by store bought salsa again. There is no comparison.

A very good side to cheese enchiladas. Everyone enjoyed it!

We are very picky about our salsa. This is has become a staple. I roasted the fresh tomatoes to get a richer flavor, and didn't puree them. Highly recommend.

My husband proclaimed this the best salsa he has ever had! He is already thinking of which other occasions I can make it for. I used the food processor on the canned tomatoes, onions, garlic (8 cloves), and jalopeno and then I just chopped everything else by hand to give it a chunkier texture. I've had a bad cilantro experience so I only added half as much and didn't food process it. The salsa really did turn out most excellent! Thanks for the great recipe!

This is more work than most salsas, but worth every effort!! The only change I make is to cut down on the garlic - 10 large cloves is too many (who wants to have strong garlic breath at a party?)

Boy am I going against the tide! I made this with no changes and wasn't "wowed." First of all I like a more chunky salsa and I got a little food processor happy with this one, which was my fault and not the recipes. Secondly I think there are other better and easier (less ingredients) recipes out there for basic tomato salsa. I wont make it again only because I prefer other salsas. This wasn't bad! Just not REALLY good. In further defence of the recipe, I am the first person (as of the date of this post) that wouldn't make this salsa again.

I made some adjustments to this recipe-- I cut way back on the garlic (3 cloves), onion, green onion, and cilantro, and I used the juice of one lime, but no lemons. I agree with the person who said that taking the seeds out of the jalapenos takes out all the heat. I ended up grinding some dried red hot peppers into a powder and adding it to the salsa to give it a little kick. It was very popular with my guests!

Finally a good salsa. I have been searching for years for a good salsa since moving from California to Florida. I did as others did and cut down on the cilantro and garlic. This recipe now has a permanent place in my recipe book.

A good fresh tasting salsa. I'm a garlic lover but i even found the amount of garlic in this recipe a little strong. I found that if blanch the garlic first and let it cool, you still have the garlicky taste but without the strong spicey bite that it sometimes has. Otherwise, an easy and great tasting salsa.

This is a terrific salsa. Perfect for dunking chips! I also used it as a side sauce for panko crusted shrimp. It was also awesome. A real keeper!

Wow!The best salsa I've made by far. I'm so pleased. In stead of three jalepeno peppers I used one serrano.

Made this salsa for a large group & everybody loved it & many asked for the recipe. Very different from bought salsa but very much like the one you would have in Mexico.

This salsa was not bad, but I must have used a really big bunch of cilantro, because the cilantro seemed to over power the salsa. When I make it next time, I think I'll cut back on the cilantro.

All members of my very large family loved this easy salsa!!! One note: once the jalepeno seeds and membranes are removed, so is the heat. I ended up adding some Tabasco at the end to restore the salsa bite. Next time I will be less cautious about stripping the jalepenos!

This is a great recipe, although the galic is a bit overpowering. I used 7 cloves instead of 10, but next time will probably use a couple less.

Fast, easy and excellent for entertaining a large group

I made this recipe a couple of times when we had some friends coming over and it was so good that they asked me for the recipe. Plus, we couldn't stop eating this salsa. It is by far the best!!!
