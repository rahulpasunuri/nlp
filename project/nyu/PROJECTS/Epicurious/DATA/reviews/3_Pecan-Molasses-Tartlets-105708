I used mini phyllo tart shells and baked the filled shells at 330 on convection and they took about 10 minutes. I made thirty tartlets though out about 1/3 cup of the liquid and 1/3 cup of pecans. Everyone loved these.

I made one tart, I ended up overcooking it. I was hoping it would be a little different from pecan pie, but it didn't taste very different. It's good, just did not seem worth the extra ingredients.

These were out of this world! The crust reminded me a little of sugar cookies and the filling was delicious without being too sweet. I only got 8 tartlets out of it but I think my pans were bigger than what the recipe called for.
