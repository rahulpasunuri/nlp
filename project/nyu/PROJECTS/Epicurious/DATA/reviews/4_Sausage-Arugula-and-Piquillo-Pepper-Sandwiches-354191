We love this recipe! We use Chicken Andouille and add a little bit of sliced garlic to the pan as we brown to amp up the flavor. I also shaved some manchego we had over the top of the warm sausages. One of our favs!

really quick meal but very satisfying. A great alternative to the usual sandwich. Tons of flavor.

Easy and delicious! We changed it up a little. Our store had a sale on hot italian sausage, so we cooked that along with some onions instead of getting fully-cooked sausages. We also used black olives, because that's what we had, and roasted a red pepper (hey, the grill was on, might as well). It's a good combination of flavors and very easy. A delicious spin on sausage and peppers!
