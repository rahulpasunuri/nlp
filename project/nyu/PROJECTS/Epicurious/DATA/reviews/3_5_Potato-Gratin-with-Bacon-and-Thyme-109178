Yum! I made three changes: omitted the bacon, used dried thyme and Russet potatoes. The flavor was lovely and was quickly consumed at Christmas dinner. I was wary of using plastic wrap to bake it in, but it turned out just fine, with no melted mess! This will be my go to potato gratin now!

We found the flavour to be rich and tasty, but also thought that it was too greasy. We also ran short on the cream mixture so added a bit of fresh cream at the end. Flavours get 3 stars but the feel in my stomach was a 1.5 star.

This is the very best potato dish I have ever made or eaten. I save it for the holidays and all my friends and family look forward to it. It always takes center stage in the meal.

I made this for a large dinner party. Everyone raved about it!!! Although it is fattening, it is the ultimate comfort food. Love it!

I would give this five forks if I could. I roast the garlic at the same time as I leave the bacon and onions to cook together, while I am do other things (slice potatoes, prep the rest of the meal), then add the garlic and cream. That all takes about 45 minutes, but it's max 10 minutes of actual work. I do think the recipe is better if you add more cream/milk than they call for -- I have doubled it in the past, to get a creamier result. I have had the saran work, and the saran melt, so now I will try the turkey oven bag idea. This really is the most delicious potato recipe I've ever had.

This is ALWAYS a hit. The first time I prepared it I was VERY VERY leery about using saran wrap and foil. I did do it...but was nervous that it would be a toxic mess. I decided to use Reynolds Turkey Oven Bags instead...omitting foil. It worked out fantastic. If you use foil only it takes much longer to cook (you need the bag concept to create steam). No more worry...it turned out superb!

I used applewood smoked thick cut bacon which imparted a really great flavor to the dish. I thought it was a good balance of creaminess, salty and savory - very delicious!

I gave this only 1 fork because it was too time consuming for the mediocre results.

These potatoes are really good, worth the labor involved. Just be aware that they are not really creamy if that's what you're looking for. Knowing that, you won't be disappointed with the great taste of this dish.

Although this recipe has several steps, there are quite a few shortcuts you can take. First of all, the onions can be made up to about 4 days ahead and refrigerated, and you can make them in the crockpot if you wish. It may take several hours, but the results will be the same. In fact, you may want to make extra and use leftovers for sandwiches, etc. They're a good condiment to have around and can be frozen. Second, you can do both the garlic ahead of time as well as the bacon. As much as 3 days ahead, you can put the garlic in the oven along with something else you're baking, then squeeze out and refrigerate or freeze. Or you could put both the garlic and the bacon in the oven at the same time. Check the bacon after about 15 minutes to see if it's ready. Once you try baking bacon in the oven, you may not go back to frying it on top of the stove. Just use a pan that has a handle that is oven safe. If you find ways to do a lot of your prep ahead of time, you'll probably cook more and enjoy it more.

This was amazing! The only problem I encountered was that there just wasn't enough of the cream sauce, I had to make more at the last minute with some thyme, bacon drippings and cream. Absolutely delicious!!

This did take a lot of prep time but everyone LOVED it. My only question/concern is using plastic wrap and then foil. I followed the recipe exactly but I think I'd try an alternate method next time...not worth the risk of the plastic wrap melting onto the food. I'd like to see if anyone has had an alternate idea that worked well...or if Bon Appetit would give us a different method to accomplish the same thing.

You're sure to be a hit with this recipe. I made it for the first time last weekend, and everyone wanted the recipe. This will definitely make a return engagement to my dinner table.

Awesome. Have made many times and it's become a fall party staple. Used pancetta and went about half on the cream balanced w/ milk. I also like to get the potato very thin (~3/32") on the mandolin. Just seems to make it more special though it's a little more work.

I have made this recipe many times with raves from guests. Yes it is time consuming and quite a lot of steps, but well worth it. I add a little chopped garlic to the onions and use an italian cheese blend on top. YUM!

You all weren't kidding when you said this is labor-intensive. If it didn't taste so incredibly good, the work would have put me off. But, it really is an incredible dish-- and I will make it again despite it taking hours. . . . Buttering the dish was a great tip.

I prepared this a day ahead of serving, and just reheated before a dinner party. The recipe is not difficult, just time consuming - but well worth it! Couldn't bring myself to use cream, and substitued whole milk, which worked just fine.

This was wonderful. I made this for a dinner party, and everyone loved it. it is time consuming, but nothing is difficult. There's more cooking time than prep time. Well worth it.

First recipe I have ever made form epicurious. A little long and overwhelming at first. This is sooooo worth it. Just jump in, hang in there because the reward will be great. Made this for christmas dinner at a friends house....served with standing rib roast, yorkshire pudding and hericot vert.

I agree with a previous reviewer - it just wasn't worth the effort. It was only "ok".

We served this at Thanksgiving this year and all of our guests loved it. I agree with all of the other reviewers that it was a time-consuming recipe, but we enjoyed it very much nonetheless. Going to make it again for the office holiday pot-luck party next week.

Way too much work for mediocre results. Regular old mashed potatoes would have been easier, cheaper, less time consuming and just as good.

If you like small dabs of rich, delightful texture and flavor, this is a recipe for you! Clearly, leave off the plastic wrap--common sense told me to. I only made one change in the recipe by using dried thyme (too late in autumn for using the stuff I grow in pots outside the kitchen door) instead of fresh. The scent of this baking is a delightful greeting for guests! For those of us on low-carb recipes, you will love this 'forbidden treat.' Good thing about it: you can only eat about two tablespoons, it's so rich. Not too many carbs in two tablespoons of potato!

Yum! As previous reviewers have stated, this is a time-consuming recipe but easy enough to understand and put together. I found it very convenient to bake it ahead of time and pop it in the oven for the final 15 minutes right before my company arrived. This dish was a hit (there were hardly any leftovers) and I will certainly make it again. I am so glad that I recently purchased a kitchen slicer ($10 at Target), since it made the slicing of the potatoes a breeze. I can't imagine how frustrated I would have been using a knife! The amount of cream mixture did seem a bit skimpy for the number of layers, but I was pretty good at rationing it out. I did "rinse" my pan out with a splash of milk and used that to drizzle over the top instead of reserving two tablespoons of the mixture. Fabulous recipe!

I made this recipe for my family and they loved it. I will definitely make it again although it was a lot of work. I double it as well and did not use plastic wrap. Plastic wrap doesn't hold up in the oven!

I doubled the recipe to serve 12 and it worked great! This recipe does take a long time to prepare but well worth it at the end. I baked the garlic the night before which helped a little. I used less onions than what it called for and the taste was still there.

Time consuming, but very flavorful. It is rather rich, so would recommend serving it with a simple grilled meat and salad.

Rating: 3
Very good but alot of work, it seemed to me that the cream sauce was not enough to do more than one layer so I had to remake the sauce. I did not use plastic wrap and buttered the pan as the previous cooks suggested and it came out beautifully. It was great reheated the next day as well.

Very good, will definitely make again. I did not use the plastic wrap, what were they thinking?

I really did not want to bake the garlic so I substituted chopped garlic from a jar and added it to the pan to brown and warm just before adding the cream. This also helped cut down on the prep time though it still is a rather lengthly (but easy) process. I also used 2 instead of 3 onions. Despite these changes, the dish was still very good and my family loved it. I am not a lover of scalloped potatoes but found this dish rather tasty as well. I first saw this recipe in Gourmet Magazine and there it did say to butter the dish, so this step was just an omission.

Delicious and very rich! It does take a long time though. Like the previous cook, the plastic wrap melted on my pan. Also, against my better judgement, I did not grease the pan because the recipe didn't say to do it. Big mistake - the entire bottom layer of potatoes burned onto the pan. We scraped it off though, and the remainder was delicious.

This dish was incredible. The taste was out of this world (I brought leftovers in for my lunch the next day at work and everyone wanted me to bring in the rest of the leftovers for them!) It is a time consuming recipe. Very easy but time consuming. It is well worth the time - delicious!! Only problem was the plastic wrap melted on the potatoes - I knew better than to add it but I did it anyways - will do without next time (oh yes there will be many next times)
