This is a good recipe, although the proportions of sugar to vinegar don't work for me--I have another version of this that relies on 1 TB brown sugar and 2 TB red wine vinegar for a medium head of cabbage, and used that instead. Also, not necessary IMO to blanch to cabbage first, since sauteeing until it is wilted, then adding the liquids, seems to work just fine if you cook it about 45 mins to an hour. However, I followed a suggestion from one reviewer and used walnut oil, which was nice. I also used ground allspice,since that is what I had, and added a few juniper berries--seasoning was good. I gave it three forks with those adjustments.

I love adding the color or red cabbage to my meals, but this was a very bland "rotkohl" recipe instead of a savory side dish...it was improved by soaking raisins and currants in cognac, increasing the red wine vinegar by 1/4 cup and adding 2 tbs of balsamic vinegar, increase sugar by 3 TBS, and grating a bit of zest near the end of cooking...a lot of doctoring to bring it up to presentable and palatable with my meal....

Good cabbage dish. I use very little sugar, and I found that 1T sugar is fairly enough for this recipe. I didn't even bother to discard the allspice berries and garlic cloves; they taste good. Here is another suggestion for cabbage: "Braised Burgundy Cabbage": 2t walnut oil 1C thinly sliced red onions 1/4C chopped walnuts 1 garlic, minced 4C shredded red cabbage 2T balsamic vinegar 2T fresh chopped oregano 1 red apple, cut into 1/2" pces 2 1/2onz goat cheese crumbled (optional) salt and ground black pepper - Warm the oil in a large no-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the onions, walnuts and garlic. Cook, stirring often, for 5-7 min. Add cabbage, vinegar, and oregano. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, for 12-15 min. Season with sal and pepper. Add a little water during cooking, if needed - Remove from the heat and add the apples and goat cheese, if using. Toss to combine. Note: red cabbage has potential cancer-preventing benefits. Enjoy !!!!

I am very disappointed in this dish, the flavour is bland and it doesn't look good.

Very Tasty. Be sure the water is boiling rapidly before you blanch the cabbage; otherwise you risk keeping cabbage in tthe water too long and having it fade in color. Very healthful dish and pretty too.

Wonderful..served it with Beef Wellington! Everybody thought it was great...especially my friend a chef.

Delicious. I cannot understand why anyone could give this dish less than 4 forks. The balance of sweet and sour is perfect- not too vinegary, but very tasty and not mushy. It was able to stand up against the strong flavors of venison or a roast. A nice touch.

Awesome! This was the first time I made something like this. Served it with a venison tenderloin roast, and it was the perfect side dish. The flavors were great together. The bright red color also looked great on the plate!

I was very disappointed in the outcome of this recipe. For our tastes it lacked the sweet and sour "punch" that I normally taste in my own red cabbage recipe. It was also too crunchy for our liking.

Beautiful color and wonderful flavor. Served it with Deep Fried Turkey. I think it would go better with a stronger meat but it was great none the less.
