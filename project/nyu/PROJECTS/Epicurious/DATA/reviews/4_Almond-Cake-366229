1/2 pound = 1 cup right? so should it be 1 3/4 or just 1?

Has anyone tried freezing this cake? I was hoping to bake it ahead of time and freezing it till needed. Any insight would be appreciated.

This makes a much larger cake than I wanted, so I used fewer eggs, I think 4 as I remember, proportionally less sugar, and then added cognac because I like the addition. I then used a 8 inch pan that was a regular cake pan. I buttered the pan well, cut parchment paper to fit the bottom and buttered that. I cut a band for the sides and buttered that. I thought it was a bit too sweet and plan to keep this on my list, but will make it less sweet.

Easy and tasty for a gluten free cake, but too sweet for my taste - I'll reduce the sugar next time.

We really did enjoy this--very light and delicate, but the flavors come through. I am not a gluten-free expert, but I imagine this would be a good choice for those who avoid gluten.

I made this cake for a ladies' lunch featuring paella and other foods of Spain. I used the almond meal flour rather than ground almonds and baked the cake in a 10" springform pan. The recipe was easy and the cake delicious. Everyone wanted the recipe. I have a feeling this cake will be even better after it ages for a day. The recipe is a keeper!

I am a sucker for almond cakes and try new recipes all the time. This is the best almond cake I have ever made - delicious! I made 3/4 of the recipe and baked it in a 20cm (8in) round cake pan with a removable bottom, lined with a circle of baking paper (buttered and floured).

I served this cake with a fresh apricot brandy sauce and drizzled it with bittersweet chocolate ganache. It was amazing! All nine of my guests agreed!

Exceptional cake! Very simple and delicious! I have used both store bought almond flour, and blanched almonds that I ran through the food processor (it takes a little while to get the texture fine enough). The blanched almond recipe was the slightest bit more flavorful, but this is a very nit-picky observation. You really can't go wrong either way!

Excellent cake! I used half a pound almond flour as suggested by other reviewers. It was very difficult to add the egg whites, but with a little elbow grease it is more than manageable. Will make many times more for sure!

This is a beautiful and flavorful cake. I made exactly as described except I used 8 oz (by weight) of finely ground almond flour instead of grinding my own blanched almonds. As other reviewers have stated, the egg yolk/almond mixture is VERY thick and sticky and it is hard to mix in the egg whites. With a good rubber spatula and a healthy dose of elbow grease, it's very doable. This cake is best served warm with a little powdered sugar. The flavor is delicate and refined, and has a unique, light, texture. Definitely going to be a go-to recipe in my book.

I used 8oz ground almond meal from Trader Joes but found the mixture too stiff. I added the juice from the orange and lemon to the yolk mixture which worked really well. Baked for about 5 minutes longer. The cake was flavorful, moist and delicious. Definitely a keeper.

I really like this cake but think there might be a typo on the almonds. I ground up 1 3/4 cup almonds in the coffee grinder which made about 2 cups ground almonds. Recently I bought a scale per Alton Brown's recommendations. When I weighed the ground almonds it was almost 16oz. so I reduced to 8oz.which equaled about 1 cup. Cake was delicious.

Read a line in a book I'm reading about a cake that "made the house smell of almonds and oranges." Well, I had to have it, so I found this recipe. Loved the ease of preparation! But, first time out on a recipe, I always make it exactly so, to see what was intended, never mess with it. In this case, it was nice, hit the spot, but was too sweet for me by far. Used Trader Joe's Organic Sugar, wonder if that's what did it. Now I'll make it again with less, and maybe use Superfine.

I made this for Easter brunch, baked the night before serving. Excellent cake, got rave reviews from everyone and I was disappointed there weren't any leftovers. I added a splash of Grand Marnier in with the batter. Instead of grinding my own nuts, I used the almond meal from Trader Joe's, as many others did. I have to think that the people who had to add water to this used too much meal... since 1-3/4C almonds would grind down to much less, I used a heaping 1C of almond meal and it turned out perfectly and was easy to work with. I powdered the top as shown and also served warm marionberry syrup on the side... it was delicious both ways! Absolute keeper. Delicious and easy.

I made this as indicate in the recipe. No kidding, I did find the almond-egg mixture tough to work with when folding in the egg whites. I used an electric mixer up to that point and did the egg whites by hand. Used a convection oven and reduced the heat 25 degrees per oven instructions. Moist, flavorful and not too sweet. I made a homemade whipped cream with orange zest and almond extract and a little sugar to server alongside it. Major hit with the family.

The cake is a good option if you are allergic to gluten and looking for a light dessert with no added oil. Mine turned out good; moist and fragrant.I followed the recipe to the letter ( except i used just a bit less sugar). I did not have any trouble with thickness. I personally prefer the richer Almond cake with kirsch from this site though.

Great recipe! I used agave nectar, 1/2 cup, in place of sugar, which made the yolk/almond mix a bit thinner. I also topped it with a marscapone/whipped cream/ammaretto cream topping, and toasted almonds.

I made this for our supper club, as we had a tapas theme. It was a hit! It is simple and delicious. I used blanched almonds instead of almond flour; the texture turned out to be surprisingly smooth. It helped to run it through the food processor several times to ground the almonds to a fine consistency. I will definitely make this again!

Brought this to the office Christmas party and everyone loved it. I only have slivered almonds on hand and used that. Now if only the husband is not allergic to almonds...

This is a fantastic cake - a couple of notes. The dough is very stiff, I find that if I incorporate a large scoop of the eggs whites and just beat it in with the mixer to soften it, then fold in the rest, it turns out fine. I use 1/2lb of almond flour, Trader Joes brand is great, I substitute Grand Marnier for the almond extract. Every time I make this it vanishes. It's also great for people who can't have flour. The almond flour is wonderful

This is a wonderful cake. I used 1c of granulated sugar, and used vanilla extract instead of almond. Like a previous reviewer, I also found it necessary to add 1/2 cup of water to the egg yolk/almond mixture to make it mixable. Didn't seem to change the cooking time. The flavour is wonderful and I just love that this is a naturally gluten-free cake that tastes yummy. No weird ingredients. I'd love to make two, and layer with coconut cream filling, orange preserves and whipped cream. I think it would make a showstopper dessert. Yum!

Used 1 cup of sugar on the advice of reviewers. Not sure why superfine sugar is called for; the ground almonds make the texture grainy. I added half a teaspoon of Triple Sec with the almond extract to enhance the orange flavor and keep the cake moist. Used the juice of the orange with 1/2 cup of Triple Sec and a vanilla bean, reduced slowly in a saucepan, then added a tablespoon of butter to finish the sauce, which we drizzled over the cake. Leftovers are great brunch fare.

This was super easy and very tasty. And it seems fairly fool-proof as I didn't follow the recipe precisely. I only had unblanched almonds and didn't want to bother removing the skins, so I just ground the almonds as they were, skins and all. I also used a 9" spring-form pan (not the 11" called for here) and just baked it 8-10 minutes longer. And I only extra large eggs on hand and so used five of those instead of six larges. And it still came out just great.

Great recipe. I served this dessert as part of a tapas evening to rave reviews by my guests. I did decrease the sugar by 1/4 cup and despite decreasing the amount of sugar it was still alittle on the sweet side.

Easy to make and turned out really well. Will make it again.

The flavor and texture of this cake were really nice BUT with some important alterations. I followed the recipe as noted, but when I added the almond flour to the egg yolks, the mixture was so stiff that the whipped egg whites wouldn't have mixed with it and still retain their airiness. I had to thin the stiff batter a little with some warm water so that the egg whites could mix with it properly. Also 1 1/2 sugar was a bit too sweet for me. Next time I will try it with just a cup of sugar only. Otherwise the flavor was excellent.

I followed this recipe exactly as it is listed here, and found it wonderfully delicate and tasty. The zest gives a subtle flavor at first, but comes out the longer it sits. This cake is in fact better after a day or two. A great gluten-free option as well.
