The flavor of black sesame paste and pears combines to create a light unexpectedly AMAZING muffin. If you don't have a spice mill - no worries just use your food processor. In my opinion the food processor works far better plus it has a bigger motor. :) I did double the baking soda and added 1 more tsp baking powder so they wouldn't fall so much. This created an almost flat top muffin. Enjoy!

Such a unique and delicious recipe. I agree with other reviewers about cook time being too long as the cake was done in 1 hour, 20 mins. Also, it was a bit dry. I put the sesame seeds in my mini processor which ground them into paste in no time. I purchased sesame seeds from Wegmans in the Asian food isle and almond meal from Trader Joes. I'll make this again, with a few minor modifications to increase moistness and pear flavor.

I followed the recipe for the most part but added two Bosc pears instead of one per based on the recommendations of other users and sprinkled two tablespoons of sanding sugar instead of regular so there would be more of a crust. I baked mine for the entire time and it came out moist, nutty, and absolutely delicious. The pear didn't seem to add much of a flavor in itself but the increased amount did make the loaf less dense. I didn't cut back on the sugar and it was fine, not too sweet at all. I'd probably serve it with a dollop of fresh whipped cream next time. Yum.

Some of the reviewers noted the cake was too sweet. I substituted 1/3 cup of the sugar with skimmed milk powder which sufficiently cut the sweetness. I served it with fresh whipped cream. My Chinese in-laws are rather particular about their food and thought it was quite good. I think it could be a little bit moister, but otherwise the flavor was great.

MMMMM! Loved it. Cut the sugar in half, used 2 Bartlett pears, and cooked it in two 8" round cake pans for 55 minutes. I was careful to beat the batter for the time estimates in the recipe, and did not go out of my way to make the top especially flat. I did not have any problems with the crust collapsing or cracking. Was rewarded with a delightfully fluffy and tasty cake. Note to those with an Asian grocery within reach: you may be able to buy black sesame paste (and black sesame powder) there - I used 1/4 cup of paste in this recipe.

This recipe turned out great and has a wonderfully unique flavor. I used 2 small pears since some of the comments suggested it could use more pear chunks. I checked the cake after an hour and 20 minutes and it was completely done, so don't wait the suggested 1 hour, 40 minutes before checking it!

this is a great cake. turns out moist, rich flavor, a little crumbly but not a big inconvenience. i didn't have a spice mill so rolled and pounded out the seeds as best i could and although i didn't have the patience or the time to get it to a paste consistency, it still tasted nutty and flavorful. i definitely would cut down on the sugar. the pears lend enough sweetness to the cake. after reading the reviews, i cut the sugar to 3/4 cup but think i could even cut it down to 1/2 cup and it would be fine. definitely be sure to smooth the top out before baking it in the oven. it will look more even and less cracked when it comes out. highly recommend it!

An odd cake and not one I would make again. I'm an experienced cook with with wide-ranging taste, but this one just... failed. I like sesame seeds and sesame wafers and candies and all of that, but this had a kind of soapy and bitter undertaste. Perhaps the black sesame seeds I bought were old. I don't know of any other explanation that would account for the disappointing taste of the final cake. The texture was crumbly and dry, too.

Delicious, nutty and just sweet enough to be pleasant but not cloying. As my husband observed, this is a dessert for adults. I agree that more pears could be added. I also think this would be great served with a slice of poached pear and a dollop of creme fraiche.

Ground the almonds for the almond meal. This takes some time but I am at the edge of the earth in W. OK. I ordered the black sesame seeds from Amazon. I will line the pan with parchment when I make this next time. I took the tea cake to a lunch with my Korean friends and they raved. I might reduce the sugar a smidge next time.

I made a couple of mistakes while making this cake. It seemed as if the batter would fit into three small aluminum pans, so I put it in just three, but sadly, it overflowed the pans onto the floor of the oven. So, believe the directions and use 6! I'm not sure I like the way the cake sort of collapses on itself in the middle. But it tastes really good.

Now this is an interesting cake. Flavor was excellent and top gets nice and crusty. Might add more pears. Definitely let cool all the way in pan before turning out. I didn't and it cracked apart in several places.
