Always a big hit for guests. You need to use really good ice cream!

I made this for a "picnic" themed party (I left off the sauce). The brownies were a breeze to make and were nice and moist. If you use salted butter, decrease the salt in the recipe to 1/2 teaspoon. I bought a square container of ice cream and sliced it to fit. This was MUCH easier than softening and spreading.

Delicious and can be made ahead of time. A little time consuming. But if you have the time why not? Kids will appreciate.

There were too many steps for a finished product that was only so-so.
