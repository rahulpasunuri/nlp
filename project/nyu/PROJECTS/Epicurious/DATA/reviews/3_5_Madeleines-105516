For me, this was the perfect Madeleine recipe! They turned out exactly as I'd hoped: airy, with a crisp edge, and with a perfect bump on the non-scalloped side. I dipped about a third of the cookies in chocolate. The batter certainly didn't 'triple in volume' as the recipe said it should during the mixing, so I worried that they wouldn't work out. Perfection!

This is mainly for "the cook from Seattle" I know exactly what she means. I too have had them in France, she might try using a recipe for "Ladyfingers" but using almond extract for the flavoring. True Madelines are similar to ladyfingers, but they do have more of an almond flavor.

I think this is a simplified version of what traditional madeleine should be. If you follow the recipe, you'll get the light and airy madeleine that totally look the part. However, is it really madeleine? no. Had a few issues with it: 1. The batter (once filled the pan) need a good knock on the counter to shake off any air bubbles trapped in there, so that the madeleine won't come out with tons of holes 2. The outcome madeleine did not have a nice crust to it, nor was it caramelized. 3. The signature bump is not very pronounced. If you make it with traditional recipe and rest the batter, the bump would be much higher.

This is a great recipe! My whole family raved about these, including my dessert loving husband. I will be making these time and time again, especially since I bought 3 Madeleine pans just to make this recipe.

I made this pretty much as listed, except I decreased the vanilla to 1/2 tsp and added 1 tsp orange flower water. I prefer orange to lemon so I used about 1 tbsp orange zest. When they were cool, I tossed them in sugar (granulated). Soft and fluffy after minutes; they firm up after a couple hours. Quite good, really.

I personally would recommend this recipe for several reasons: one, being that it was so fast to make, and the second would definitely have to be that I believe that you can't get better madeleines than this! I believe that from the time I got my ingredients out to the time they came steaming out of the oven, it took me an hour (tops). Great recipe!

Amazing. For someone like me who doesn't really know what he's doing, these were relatively simple, and the results were beautiful. High praise from spouse and neighbors. Now, if I could just figure out how to not eat them all in one sitting...

Recipe is great start for basic madeleines. However, technique is key. Tried a different recipe the other day and didn't do it too carefully... turned out dense and too floury. This recipe is similar, but I measured/sifted flour more carefully and turned out perfect: like mini lemon angel cakes.

Perfect. I used both a silicone mold and a metal mold and the silicone madelines came out much better than the metal ones. A very lovely cookie.

The original recipe uses egg whites and almonds. the butter needs to be browned in a pan and then chilled before using it.

There's another Madeleines recipe in this web site. Has anyone tried out that one yet? I'm looking for a recipe that will give me the kind of Madeleines that they sold at Starbucks! These are moist, buttery, soft and perfect looking - with real indentation and a lump, which Madeleines should have.

I also swapped out the lemon zest for orange zest and they are fantastic! They were best eaten about 15 minutes after they came out of the oven when they were crisp on the edges. This is a great recipe that is easy to modify with different flavors depending on what you want your madeleines to taste like.

I made these the other night to try out the new madeleine pan I received for my birthday - fabulous! This recipe makes perfectly Proustian madeleines.

The ones at Starbucks taste so good, I thought mine tasted like a blah cupcake. People at work liked them though. I sifted the flour like I was supposed to and everything! It's the only Madeline recipe I've been able to find, I'm not sure if another recipe would be any different. I guess it just tastes better when someone else makes it.

This has become my all time staple for baking for the kids and teachers at school as a special treat - they love them. I sometimes use different flavors, like orange extract, coconut extract which is yum yum yummy. Thanks for this very fast and simple recepie.

I found this recipe a little boring when I made it, so I tried another that used powdered sugar instead of granulated sugar, and slightly different proportions of the other ingredients. That recipe was only slightly better. I think the problem is that I want mine to taste as though I had bought them in France! I'll keep looking for the recipe that tastes like it was made by a french professional, even when I make it!
