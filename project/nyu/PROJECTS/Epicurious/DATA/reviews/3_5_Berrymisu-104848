I've made this recipe since it was published in 2001 and have never been disappointed. 1) it's BEAUTIFUL! 2) I've given the recipe out EVERY time I've made it for personal or work functions and 3) it's delish! In fact, I'm making it tonight for a going away party at work tomorrow!

One of the best deserts ever! A fair amount of steps involved but result well worth it. Try substituting raspberry liqueur for 1/2 of lemon juice once syrup has cooled. This desert goes a long way. You could also try substituting lady fingers with plain chocolate cup cakes slices -- it does become a whole other desert though (as a variation).

my search is for NON DAIRY desserts...... last time I checked cream cheese and whipping cream were dairy.

This is an all time favorite. Delicious and impressive.

I didn't have the lady finger cookies. So I tore apart a purchased angel food cake, mixed it into the raspberry cream base and then chilled it in the refridgerator overnight. Served it w/ whipped cream and fresh raspberries on the side and everybody loved it. YUMMY!!

I seem to be in a minority but I first made this recipe when it appeared in the magazine because it looked so pretty but I found that it looked better than it tasted. However, because of all the great reviews I decided to give it another try. I still did not love it (although it looked very pretty for July 4 as I topped it with whipped cream, raspberries and blueberries). The taste of the cream cheese overpowers the raspberry flavor and I would much prefer a lighter raspberry mousse made with whipped cream. I brought it to a BBQ - people were oohing and aahing when they saw it but nobody said that it tasted great! A beautiful bowl of berries would have been better.

I put in a review for this recipe, but I've since made it again...following my own advice. It was even better. If you are using a large glass dish, use two boxes of Nilla wafers. It ends more of a "cake" layer. I also included a layer of sweetened whipped cream after each raspberry cream layer. It tones down the flavors. Delicious!

Absolutely delicious. Used fresh blackberries instead of raspberries and whipped topping instead of whipping cream. I'll be making it again soon for my child's birthday.

This is an excellent dessert for intimate occasion or for family and friends. I have servered this dish several times and time nothing but raves and others wanting the recipe.

I served this dessert at a dinner party. It was a huge success. It was light and refreshing. I have been asked to bring it to other parties. I took the time to find the Champagne biscuits and they were wonderful. I really like the idea of adding some raspberry liquor. Might try that next time.

I have made this several times. Once with home made lady fingers and again with store bought. the home made lady fingers are much better as they don't get soggy! White chocolate curls was an excellant addition to the raspberry garnish. Someone else suggested raspberry liquer in the sauce, which sounds great. Will have to try it again soon with liquer!

I made this for the first time yesterday and I have to thank previous reviewers for some great tips. The first thing I did was reduce the fat content - used a container of low-fat Cool Whip and 8 oz of 1/3 fat + 4 oz of regular cream cheese, and put in a 1/2 tsp. of almond extract. I also used 1/2 a bag of frozen and 1/2 fresh rasberries. It was no big deal straining the seeds either (using a metal sieve). I too used Nilla wafers (almost the whole box) as that's all I could find. My husband does not like lemon very much so I was worried about those comments and added about a tablespoon of Chambord (rasberry liquor) to the dipping mixture. Added the fresh berries at the outside edges, where the wafers didn't meet, on each layer for visual appeal. Delicious!

Very refreshing dessert. Dip ladyfingers briefly in lemon mixture. I like the idea a previous cook had about adding white chocolate curls with the rasperry garnish, will try that next time.

Wasn't too impressed. It was on the runny side and I found the lemon flavor a bit too strong. I love raspberries but I will find a better use for them next time.

A very tasty and somehow, rich but still refreshing dessert. It was worth looking for real Champagne biscuits, which eliminated any disintegration problems. My husband insisted, however, that it needed an extra something ... he suggested some medium Sherry. Then again, being English he's used to trifle. Has anyone tried adding any alcohol to this dish? I assume it would be added to the lemon syrup.

Rating: 2
A nice idea - unlike many people I was able to find Italian champagne biscuits. However, the tart lemon flavor was very overpowering - and I barely dipped the biscuites in the lemon sauce. It would be nice to try again, but it takes so long to strain those raspberries that I probably will just choose something else.

Rating: 4
Tastes great, but takes FOREVER to make. Definitely leave plenty of time to make this, perhaps even starting at night and finishing the next morning. But if I ever have time, I would definitely want to eat this again. Not sure about the cookies, I just bought something that looked like it'd work, and it did. Anything plain and sort of oval shaped should do.

Fabulous dessert!! I wound up using fresh strawberries as a garnish as my raspberries went off. That seemed to work well and I received many compliments on this dessert. I also used a large round bowl as I didn't have a 12 cup trifle dish. Easy to prepare and delicious to boot.

I very much enjoyed this dessert, and so did my co-workers! I did change the recipe a bit, though. I didn't have a food processor handy, so I did my best to press the thawed raspberries through a sieve. Probably didn't come out as thick, but tasted nice. I also made up the recipe in a 9x13 pan since I didn't have a trifle dish either. Per my aunt's request, I'm making this again this weekend for her church's bake sale. I also think it would be fantastic with strawberries!

FIRST TIME: If I could add a "half-fork" to my 3-fork rating, I would. It was a bit time-intensive, but it was worth it. This dish was so refreshing! This dessert was the perfect balance between tart lemon juice and sweet sugar and tangy raspberries. The predominant flavor in this crimson-colored mousse is raspberry, so it could be the "finale" for any occassion, any meal, any season. SECOND TIME: I STILL love this recipe. It was less time-intensive as I got better with the recipe. I "jazzed" it up by adding a layer of whole raspberries ontop of each layer of cream-mixture. PLEASE use only fresh raspberries, the frozen ones are too gooey and make the dish soggy. Then I garnished the top with more fresh raspberries and fresh mint leaves, and served it during brunch. This recipe became FOUR forks!

My review should be taken with a grain of salt, as I didn't follow the recipe exactly. Since I couldn't find "champagne biscuits", or even find a store that knew what I was talking about, I followed up on the suggestion of another reviewer and used Nilla wafers. I also substituted low-fat Cool Whip for the whipped cream (catering to a lactose-sensitive sister). That said, I was displeased by the texture and found the dessert too sweet for my taste. I don't agree with the reviewer who found time-intensive, though. I suspect that if I were to follow the recipe (though maybe reducing the amount of sugar), I would be better pleased with the results. As it was, the rest of the family enjoyed it (or claimed to, anyway!).

Wonderful dish! I made it for Easter dessert and everyone loved it. I used strawberries (instead of raspberries) and added an extra layer of fresh strawberries on top of each layer of mousse. Definitely a keeper!

This is a great dessert, but I think the amount of lady fingers should be increased. What I also did was substituted Key Lime Juice for the lemon juice, the lime flavor really enhanced the dish more than the lemon flavor.

This recipe was excellent. I am forever making rich deserts, and this is a beautiful change. I will try this with other berries too. It was simple and has a great presentation. Oh, to the Cook from Miami, you are either quite the comic, or a fool. Either way, I had a good laugh.

Would it be possible to make this with cool whip instead of whipping cream? I haven't made this yet, but would like to cut down on some of the fat-- does anyone know?

We made this with strawberries instead of raspberries. It was still delicious! I would probably add fresh sliced strawberries (or raspberries) in layers on the bottom and after adding the champagne biscuits to give it more berry UMPH!

This is by far the best dessert I've ever made. I, too, put it in a 9x13 pan but then served it in sherbet dishes. I also used Nilla Wafers (made it easier to cut in squares) and shaved dark chocolate curls along with fresh raspberries on top. My guests raved about this recipe. Yum!

This was a real winner. So incredibly easy, everyone loved it. I made it exactly as the recipe said and it was delicious. The best part is, you can have a light fruity dessert in the middle of winter, when raspberries aren't around. I used a 9x13 glass baking dish and it was lovely.

Served an Italian dinner to friends and wanted a light tiramisu type of dessert that was not coffee based since several guests do no like the taste of coffee. This was the perfect dessert to serve! It was light and it got rave reviews. Instead of trifle I made it like a traditional tiramisu and used a lasagna baking dish which I covered with plastic wrap. I used the lady fingers as a base and instead of dipping them into the lemon syrup (because they were desintegrating)I opted to coated the lady fingers with a pastry brush. I also cut the sugar and layered fresh rasberries. Served the berrymisu topped with chocolate shavings and fresh raspberries. This is a nice dessert to serve for a bridal shower lunch.

This was a big hit with friends and family. Some improvements that I would make - add more ladyfingers, and add fresh berries inside the trifle.

Good refreshing fruity dessert. I made for a memorial day barbeque - in the spirit of the holiday, i added some fresh blueberries to the fresh raspberries between layers and a sprinkling of each on top with a bit of whipped cream for a red,white and blue theme. Very good!

Very tasty and beautiful dessert. I also used ladyfingers- they worked great. I did not bother straining the raspberry puree, and it was wonderful. I wanted to do a fresh fruit layer in there also, but the grocery was out of raspberries, so I used fresh sliced strawberries. A very berry dessert! Great! Lots of compliments.

Very easy to make and tasty, however my strainer is so fine that none of the raspberry juice would come through at all so I had to use cheesecloth instead. I also ended up with a lot of leftover cream mixture. Next time I'll try it with egg whites and cream of tartar since my eyes nearly popped out of my head when I read the fat content of whipping cream. I also used ladyfingers and found that they held together perfectly even after dunking them in the syrup.

Although the dessert was simple and delicious, I thought it was too sweet. Cutting down on the sugar in the mousse would be my recommendation.

Very easy to put together and beautiful presentation (tasted good too!). I used ladyfingers and put fresh raspberries in the layers for additional color. Next time, however, I would sweeten it a bit more, lessen the cream cheese and/or increase the whipping cream.

I, and my many guests that I have made this for, have LOVED this dessert. It sound complicated, but it is truly simple to make and I will make it over and over again. The only change I made was to add a raspberry in between each lady finger in all the layers. You can see them through the dish and it makes the presentation that much better. Enjoy!!

I served this to my dinner group and they just raved about it. It is easy and delicious. I couldn't find Champagne biscuits so I too used ladyfingers. I might play with less cream cheese and more whipped cream. It was a perfect ending to a heavy meal. Make it!

Very elegant, delicious and refreshing. I used fat free cream cheese and prepared with fresh strawberries. Ladyfingers should be good quality, they will not disintegrate when dipped in syrup. Be sure to prepare the day before to give time for the ladyfingers to soften and absorb the syrup. I prepared the Berrymisu in individual fancy stemware. This recipe makes 6, depending on the size of the stemware or cup.

read the other reviews so revised a few things. put puree in a saucepan, with 1/4 C chambord, 1/4C seedless jam, then reduced. then added 3/4C to the cream cheese mixture. then..instead of ladyfingers put a brownie in the bottom of the bowl, with the raspberry mixture on top. It's Great!!

Everyone at my dinner party(sophisticated eaters all)absolutely loved this dessert, and it was so easy to make (except that you have to quickly plunge the ladyfingers into the lemon juice, not coat each side individually, to keep them from disintegrating). Light and fresh after a heavy dinner.

My ladies' group loved it! It's fresh, pretty, and perfect for spring. When preparing this recipe, I used a pastry brush to coat ladyfingers in the serving dish rather than dipping them individually. Also, let the dessert sit out for at least 20-60 minutes for a melt-in-your-mouth result. I can't believe the other reviews; this is a wonderful recipe to keep for a summer dessert/brunch without baking and with fresh fruit!
