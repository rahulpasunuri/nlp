Made this last night for a dinner party. It was excellent and everyone loved it. I did use less oil and vinegar as others had suggested. I used 3 Tbsp of balsamic vinegar and 1/4 cup of olive oil and kept the other ingredients the same. It was perfect. I will make this often as a side dish. If I don't have fresh oregano on hand I may try it with fresh basil.

Used as a dressing over torn leaf lettuce. Guests raved. I used 50/50 regular and white balsamic and was generous with chilis.

Excellent. I've made this several times to rave reviews. This time I added cooked lima beans, fresh red bell pepper and fresh corn off the cob. Fabulous!

Very good on tri tip recipe, some people also ate it as a side salad. I was out of balsamic and used red wine vinegar, was still good.

Perfect and so pretty. Served it on a platter with grilled steaks. Absolutely gorgeous and so fresh for a summer bbq! Loved it, will use it with different meats and fish.

Wonderful! Served this with a stuffed lamb roast for Easter, I will use this recipe again with any grilled meat. I followed suggestions of other reviewers and used 2/3c oil and 1/3c vinegar which was plenty. I also chopped up a fresh mild chili (Anaheim, I believe) which was very good. The fresh oregano was so unexpected and tasty with this dish, tastes great the next day, too.

Make sure you use really fresh sweet cherry tomatoes, which makes all the difference in the world. Fresh, is key. I used chives and oregano from my garden, and a really good Italian balsamic vinegar. I made the whole recipe for only 4 people, and there was only 1 serving left. ;-) That's how much we liked it.

As noted, this might serve more as a decorative dish than for flavor, but it should be said that the recipe calls for 1/8 cup of the diced chili, but the original recipe as found in Bon Apetite calls for 3/4 cup. This might make a difference. Otherwise the tritip is just absolutely magnificent on it's own.

A great accompaniment to the tri-tip. I used only about 1/2 cup oil, very sweet tomatoes and 10-year balsamic vinegar. I recommend a good, older balsamic to stand up to the meat. Balsamic on tomatoes, what's not to love?

I agree with the other reviewers who found the recipe lacking in flavor. I modified it to use 1/3-cup vinegar, 2/3-cup oil, and added cumin and diced mangoe, but papaya would have worked as well or better. Also, I prefer Roma tomatoes coursely chopped rather than the cherry tomatoes.

I cut back on the oil, but still was disappointed with the lack of flavor. Pretty easy, but really worth the effort.

This is a fantastic recipe. The only thing I have changed is to use fresh cilantro instead of ordinary parsley.It is a beautiful, colorful dish and very tasty. I have made it several times for guests, and it has always been a hit. It is especially good in the summer, served cold.

I made this to be served with the Tri Tip but forgot to put it out at our Memorial Day party. The next day my husband and I had it with leftover tri tip and didn't especially care for it. If I try it again it would only be for a colorful presentation.

I made this recipe with a sauteed jalepeno and poblano mixture insted of using canned chilies (yuk!), and with much less oil. It had a nice depth of flavor, and was a great partner with the tri-tip.

A perfect side dish to compliment the tri-tip. A combination of sweet from the tomatoes, and tangy from the balsamic vinegar. Will reduce the olive oil to 1/2 c. next time.

This wasn't bad, but it is kind of heavy and doesn't let the freshness of beautiful garden tomatoes shine through. I think it would be better without the oil, a lighter vinegar, and fresh chilies. But then, that would be a different recipe...

I made this as a side dish and served it with Filet Mignon at a season opener football tailgate party. It was also a special event as it was a dear friend's 40th! It was quite a dinner and the steaks were awesome, but everyone agreed, the cherry tomato side was absolutely delish! One variation to note, I used grape tomatoes instead, and they were wonderful. I'd recommend using those if they are available.

This is a great relish, but I agree there is too much oil and vinegar. Actually, to make this more kid friendly, I halved the vinegar to the same amount of oil. For most adults this might weaken the vinegar taste too much, though. It's great with the Tri-tip.

This relish is great with the tri-tip. I added the olives per the suggestion of one of the other reviewers. The olives absorbed a lot of the liquid but the relish took on the color of the olives so it was not attractive. Nextime i would leave out the lives and cut back on the oil.

This was a huge success!!!! I did cut the vinegar and olive oil in half and it was perfect.

there is WAY too much oil here--I used a scant 1/4 c olive oil and still thought it was too much. the flavors are okay, and this was decent on the tri-tip roast it was intended for, but this was a pretty boring accompaniment which I wouldn't bother making again. spicy carmelized onions would've matched much better with the meat.

While this was very good, It seemed that there was too much oil and vinegar. I will try decreasing the oil and vinegar by approx. one half next time, as my tomatoes were swimming in it. I also might try a lighter flavored oil..

After reading this recipe, I realize that I make something so similar that I had to mention it...The only ingredient that I add is chopped black olives and I have served this for years as an appetizer with tostito chips. It is always a hit and I serve it every time I have guests as my husband LOVES the leftovers putting it on everything he eats...meat, salad, potatoes, and veggies...I add a small can of the chopped black olives...Delish...

This is super with the grilled tri-tip. Kick it up with fresh jalepenos. Easy meal to prepare.

i used this with the tri-tip and everyone loved it, i used fresh jalapino peppers and it gave it a nice kick (the green ones, not the red)

Instead of salt & pepper for seasoning, I user Mrs. Dash Original recipe, McCormick's Seasoned black pepper, and about 1 1/2 tbls of sugar. It was perfect, just on it's own!
