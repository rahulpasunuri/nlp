This was fantastic!! Easy to make and delicious. We added about 1/4c of ricotta to the eggs before cooking and mixed the Parmesan with a little Locatelli Romano. WOW!!

I made this for breakfast (on a work day!), and it was quick and tasty. I felt good all day knowing I had eaten vegetables at breakfast! It goes great next to a slice of buttered whole-grain toast.

Love this recipe, but I add onions in my Spinach & scrambled eggs.

I did everything as instructed except I had chard in the fridge and no spinach. Worked awesome with chard too. I sliced it thin and cooked it a little longer, checking to make sure the texture wasn't too crunchy. I great way to use up greens that are on their way out!

Oh my gosh! How can something this good for you be so delicious? Well, it is! I made it twice the first week I rec'd the magazine, and have made it at least once a week since. Hubby and I can't get enough of it. Oh, and I'd give another star just for how easy it is to make!
