I used chicken skinless breasts - worked great. And I used chicken stock instead of water, and served with basmati rice. Quick, easy and made my spice-loving husband and son happy. This is a repeat!

Wow - earthy and juicy. Who knew I could pull something together that's so exotic BUT SO SIMPLE. I used 6 chicken thighs and doubled the powder and liquid (white wine and chicken stock). Fresh lime and cilantro bring it all together!

Very happy...picky fiance approved! It's always hard to find easy weeknight recipe and trying to find something reasonably healthy. Really appreciated reviewer who tried boneless skinless chicken breast and chipotle in adobo sauce in place of chipotle chile powder! Just what I happened to have on hand. Was afraid chicken breast would be too dry, but cooking long time with low heat did the trick. Could possibly taste better with skinless thighs, but trying to keep it healthy. Non-health conscious fiance raved about this dish. Note changes: used chicken broth in place of water and a tiny dash of Knorr's chicken bullion powder. Didn't have lime on hand but a battery of vinegars. Picked a splash of white wine vinegar to give the dish some acidity without overwhelming the dish. Used only 1 chipotle chile in adobo sauce for entire recipe which added nice smokiness and a hint of spice. We normally love spicy food but are cutting back due to fiance's acid reflux. Added a bit more cilantro than called for (nearly 1/2 cup) but it didn't overwhelm. Added a couple of dashes of corn starch to thicken sauce to almost a gravy like consistency. Served over a thin layer of rice and basic green beans. Great with plenty of sauce spooned over it.

This was good but not great. Happy tummies but wouldn't make again. Couldn't really taste the cilantro or lime juice much- maybe use more? Chipotle chili powder definitely gave it a punch and a little flavor, maybe add something extra- cumin? Used homemade chicken stock instead of water.

This was wonderful! I used boneless skinless chicken breasts that I dredged in flour. I used chicken stock instead of water. The sauce for this dish is amazing, but I didn't think it made enough. Next time I'll add another 1/2 c of stock.

This came out really delicious! I used chicken thighs (on sale), veggie stock instead of water, and served it with basmati rice and steamed broccoli.I'm glad I persevered and found chipotle powder instead of just using chili powder, because it is a really different flavor and has a big effect on the heartiness of the dish. I made an effort to really caramelize the onions first, which I also think added a nice layer of flavor. I loved the cilantro more than I thought I would, and would probably put in a little extra next time. I also appreciate that this is on the healthier side!

Just made this for dinner for myself and a picky roommate, and we BOTH loved it. Absolutely delicious, and super easy/simple (always a fan of one-pot dishes). I substituted the chipotle chile powder (couldn't find it) with one canned chipotle chile in adobo sauce (and a little of the sauce - we like things spicy), and added a little extra cilantro. I added maybe half a tablespoon of flour to the sauce too (and didn't remove the onions near the end, just the chicken) to thicken it up - it probably would be just fine without, but I really liked the sort of spicy onion jam/chutney consistency it ended up getting. Finally, used two boneless, skinless chicken breasts in place of chicken pieces. Really, definitely try this - easy, quick, full of flavor, not so bad for, and could go great with so many things (had it with broccoli, would love to have it with spanish rice next time).

Yumm! For some reason I was just sure I was going to mess this up tonight (I was a little scatterbrained) but... I think this is a foolproof recipe! and it tastes great! -- I made it with the rice and it came together nicely

Even the picky eaters at my house loved this. I thought they might think it was too spicy but I think they picked around the onions (which were too die for) and most of the heat stay with them. I was surprised that some reviewers said they needed to add a thickener. My sauce thickened so quickly, I thought it was going to break. Try it without it first.

This was not hard to make and turned out amazingly well my first stab at it. I used chicken thighs and the chipotle chile powder. Paired with the coriander rice dish that's recommended it made for a very special meal.

I followed the suggestion and used chicken stock instead, and the dish turned out perfect. It was a hit!

Great recipe! I'll definitely make this again and again. I made it per the recipe except I used low salt chicken broth instead of water.

Hands down an excellent dish.

Absolutely beautiful...I added a bit more salt before I added the chicken into the onion mix...and also flour to thicken it...fantastic recipe.

Awesome recipe! I made this for dinner with the Warm Herbed Coriander Rice Salad as suggested in the recipe. My wife took one bite and just said "wow". She later said it was a restaurant quality meal. I've made many recipes from this site, but that's the first time I've gotten that reaction from her. The only tweak I made was the addition of two tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken the sauce, as recommended by another reviewer.

So this recipe was awesome. I don't usually follow recipes but I think Ill do it more.. This dish is savory, moist and all around good. I added a little corn starch to the sauce for a little more gravy like texture, and I didn't use chipotle Chile just regular Chile powder plus a touch of Cayenne for a little extra kick. try it you wont be sorry.

Absolutely yummy! I forgot to buy onion so I used shallots instead and it came out great.
