Fresh, zesty, and delicious. I give the recipe 3 forks instead of 4 only because adding water is completely unnecessary. I can never find red jalapenos or serranos so I make it with green ones; obviously, serranos make a hotter sauce. It is fantastic on the lamb kebabs, but also on virtually anything else: I spread it on ripe tomato slices, grilled eggplant, even crackers.

I could not find fresh red serrano or jalapeno peppers so I used a mix of fresh green jalapenos with a few serranos mixed in - ended up cutting back a little on the pepper. The end result; a beautifully verdant hot and flavorful sauce with a pesto-like texture. I have no idea what happened with the soggy sauces reported by other reviewers. My advice for this recipe - stay away from peppers in jars, cans or packed in liquid.

In defense of that Portland cook, I'm pretty sure the "roasted peppers" bought at the farmers market are not jarred red bells, which was the conclusion somebody jumped to. They are either poblanos or Anaheims, which are roasted by a vendor at the market. No, they're not the jalapenos or serranos called for in the recipe, but they're not sweet bells, either. So simmer down, K?

How did this get rated so poorly. It is fabulous and a must have with any type of lamb. Make it often for guests and they rave about it.

Sorry! I forgot the forks! I'd give it five if I could!

As my food processor is a piece of junk, I threw all the ingredients into my blender, which isn't. The result was the most delicious pesto-like sauce, excellent with the lamb kabobs and wonderful alone with the pita bread. To the "cook" from Portland: roasted red peppers are decidely not jalepenos or serranos. They are regular old sweet red bells. If you want to complain about a recipe, perhaps you should use the ingredients called for. You might as well have begun with a ripe banana. I never cease to be amazed at the willingness of people to tout their ignorance to the world...

I have made this regularly for years, it is a staple in the frig. I have never added the water. I have always used small jars of red jalapenos.

I've not made this recipe, but I'm slightly baffled by the 1/4 cup of water required. When I make similar dishes I use the just-washed greens that still have some water on them.

Only tried this recipe to use up roasted peppers purchased at the farmers market. Will not remake, as it is indeed watery and lacks a lot of flavor, as the previous reviewer noted.

For a similar recipe use the sauce from Fried fish with Moroccan style herb sauce. Almost the same ingredients but somehow the proportions work out much better - for a nice smooth and thick sauce. This one here was watery and not spicy or tasty enough.
