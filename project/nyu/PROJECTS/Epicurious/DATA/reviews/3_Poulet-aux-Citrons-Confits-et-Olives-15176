I didn't find this had the depth and breadth of flavour I expect in a tagine-style dish, though I guess that should have been obvious from the list of ingredients. Will try variations based on other recipes, as I love preserved lemon and olives.

I've made this with chefs in Provence, excellent recipe but I would alter the preparation slightly: If you have a Dutch over/Le Cruesett, use it...first add a little oil to the pot and brown each chicken piece (I use breasts and thighs with skin) 3- 4 at a time...once crisp, remove and set aside. Do not discard any of the oil or pan flavor -- saute the onions, garlic, ginger, etc. in the same pan - it REALLY develops the depth of flavor by effectively deglazing,and the oil is still less that 1/2 cup. I also add some cumin (as another reviewer recommended) and liked the dried coriander. Add the chicken back in, and bake on 300 for 50 minutes, slower cooking at lower heat, but also remember the chicken is partially cooked. When you remove from oven, toss the chicken in the pan, then remove to thicken the sauce and add the lemon prserves (a critical indredient) and olives. When sauce thickens, just plate the chicken and sauce on top/side. Coucous with chopped raisins is a great accompaniment.

This is excellent and has such a different taste. The preserved lemons are worth making not only for this dish, but to use in others, as well. The cinnamon with the preserved lemon is quite a delicious contrast. As others suggested, I added a healthy pinch of cumin-- not detectable, but adds greatly to the depth of flavor. I also cooked the 'sauce' ahead of time then piled chicken pieces on top, covered and slowly braised in the oven. I added the fresh herbs and olives at the end, pulled the soggy skin off the chicken and served. Was even better the next day for lunch and could be made ahead, chilled and reheated using boneles, skinless breasts.

I made a few changes that helped improve this dish (I think). First, I used chicken breasts; next, I sauted the onion, garlic and ginger in 1/4 cup of olive oil until soft. then I added other ingredients and baked as directed, but for less time. This gave the dish a depth of flavor that was lacking previously. I've served it at several dinner parties to raves.

Good, but too many other recipes to try to make anything twice that isn't great!!

This is one of the best chicken recipes I've ever made. My husband says it instantly became his favorite! I used half breasts rather than the whole chicken, added a little crystallized chicken bouillon, and used both the pulp and rind of the preserved lemons. Fabulous!

I love cooking with preserved lemons, and this dish is a user-friendly take on the moroccan classic. It can get a bit oily when you finish the sauce, so I recommend cutting back the oil when you start out, or using skinless thighs. I've made this with game hens, whole chicken, and cut up chicken. It's always good, though bonesless, skinless breasts can get tough - thighs are preferable.

This dish was delicious! My whole family loved it & I would certanly serve this at a dinner party. I found it very easy to make & liked the simplicity of putting everything in the pot at the same time. I did not have any fresh coriander so used ground coriander instead (just less than 1 tsp.)...it worked well. I removed the skin when the chicken was cooked ( less fatty & a more appetising appearance). Instead of serving this with rice, I used Couscous. The combination of flavours is very Moroccan, so the couscous works very well. I sprinkled each serving with parsley. I also think the key to the success of this dish is to use an organic or free range chicken... the flavour is incomparable.

I like cinnamaon- I really do! My perfume is Cinnabar but--to me (and I'm adventurous) it is a bit too much. Too much spice, too much hullabaloo. However, for when you are in the mood for something different, it is really very good! I know, I know! My opinion is a study of coonflicting statements, but I cannot help but observe that this dish offers a lot of conflict also. For one time, only,(like a mountain climbing cheese and wine 'thang', I say "Bon Appetit"!
