While I'm sure this is very tasty as written, as far as I know (and I've looked), nobody makes kosher sherry vinegar, let alone kosher-for-Passover. Similarly, I've never seen kosher-for-Passover smoked paprika, although one can find it for the rest of the year.

This was a delicious first course at our Passover Seder. Even those of my guests who don't love fish had multiple helpings. I couldn't get fresh sardines, so I used Spanish mackerel. I'm usually not a big fan of mackerel but I was pleasantly surprised; the marinade really tamed the strong, very fishy taste that mackerel often has. I also substituted 2 cups of fresh-squeezed orange juice for the 2 cups of white wine, because I thought that the recipe as written would be too acidic for the kids at the Seder. Even so, when I tasted the marinade after reducing it, it was very vinegar-y, so I added a teaspoon of ground cinnamon and 3 Tablespoons of brown sugar. The sweetness of the orange juice, sugar and cinnamon helped balance the acid, which mellowed still further after a few hours of refrigeration. I especially appreciated being able to cook and refrigerate the dish a full day in advance of the Seder, which made my Seder preparation that much less hectic. I also liked the way the Mediterranean flavors complemented those of the Spinach Matzo Pie, also on this site, which I served as a main course. This will be a regular feature on our Passover menu.
