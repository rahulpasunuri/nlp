Tasty and pretty, but two problems: First, all the whole spices get in the way; who wants to chew on a mouthful of cloves and allspice, etc? Maybe put in as a bouquet garni of sorts? Second, letting shrimp sit in lemon/vinegar acid for that long - especially after a quick boil - leaves them terribly "overcooked" by the time you eat them. Maybe cure them in the lemon/vinegar from raw first for an hour or so, then add the vegetables? Recipe has potential but not perfect yet.

I don't know why so many are down on this recipe--I, and 10 guests, loved it! And the leftovers. I will most definitely make it again. You do have to like vinegar-y pickles, though.

if you treat this as a pickle, something you just have a few bites of, it's really good. especially the fennel celery onion combo with the vinegar. the shrimp makes it odd as a pickle, to me at least..

I really wanted this to be better. I have made it twice and even with some tweaking, I wasn't that excited about this dish. I tried adding more crushed pepper to off-set the over-powering pickled flavors but that didn't really do it for me. I do like pickled things it was just that for some reason, this didn't work for me. The fennel and onions, perhaps, soaked up too much of the pickled flavor? It wasn't terrible -- it just wasn't the kind of dish people will be asking for again and again.

We made this as written, and it was a rare disappointment from Epicurious. This recipe needs work. The fennel needs to be cooked longer and the pickling spices shouldn't be all mixed up with the shrimp. Good concept, but it needs to be rethunk!

Mine came out too sour and the whole spices made it tricky to eat.

Looks good but I am deathly allergic to shellfish. Any ideas for substitutes?

fabulous! very easy to make, colorful, and full of flavor. We are not big garlic fans, therefore I used 1 garlic clove only in the marinade and none in the water. Also, used a 2 lb bag frozen large shrimp in shell, instead of the suggested 3 pounds. Results were outstanding! I'm sure I'll be making this dish again.
