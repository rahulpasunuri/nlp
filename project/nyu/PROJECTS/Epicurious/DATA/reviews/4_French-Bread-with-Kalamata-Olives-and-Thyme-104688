Wow this recipe is great!! I made a few substitutions as am amalgamation of other reviewers suggestions, I halved the amount of water and added 3/4 cup of greek yogurt. I used buttermilk which weirdly separated when I simmered it but it still worked. I used my mixer because I have elbow tendonitis which doesn't allow me to hand mix dough but the dough rised just fine and cooked great but I used a 2" frying pan (wok) with 2 cups of water to supply steam and that seemed to extend the cooking time beyond 10 minutes so I just went by crust time. I used loaf pans because I couldn't find baguette pans at my local bed bath and beyond store and they turned out so unbelievably moist I am a fan for life of this recipe!!

The bread was good but not great. I loved the crust but it lacked a little beyond that. All in all a good starting point, quick and easy to make. Adjust it to fit your own taste and it can be great.

A note for those of you think the dough is coming out too wet, weigh the flour instead of measuring. Dry ingredients get lost in translation when using liquid measuring units, plus you'll come out with a much closer measurement (I didnt even use my full "4 cups"). I decided to add sundried tomato w/ the olives as well as some sliced garlic. Absolutely delicious.

This is my first attempt to make bread though I make pizza dough all the time. This certainly was a lot stickier than pizza dough and kind of hard to handle but it turned out really good. My wife loved it.After my success with this I might take up bread making. I also used a skillet with water instead of misting.

I used this recipe in my first attempt (ever!) to make bread. It came out fairly well overall...excellent considering I had never tried anything like it :) Thanks for the hint of oiling my hands before working with the dough. It was a huge help! I also used the iron-skillet-with-water-in-it trick rather than spraying. Worked like a charm!

Great artisan bread dough recipe. I didn't follow the given instructions exactly when handling the dough. Actually handled it more than the recipe suggested. I folded it over in thirds, letter style, let it rest for 15 minutes and then folded it the same way again. I then formed into long round loaves, let them rise, and slashed the top of the dough before baking. Did not use the egg wash. Put boiling water in a cast iron pan at the bottom of the oven when I put the loaves in to bake to create steam. The crust was crunchy and split open on the top, just like bakery artisan bread. The texture was great, with lots of nice holes for trapping olive oil when eating! Yummy. Will definitely make again.

This was my second time to make this recipe and I couldn't have been happier with the results. I read all the reviews that have been submitted since my first attempt and I thought the tip about oiling your hands with olive when you're ready to separate the dough into loaves (as well as a spatula) was excellent advice. I made one loaf last night after the dough had been refrigerated for six hours and plan to bake the other loaf tonight. I used a perforated baguette pan (bakerscatalog.com)and sprayed it with cooking spray. The loaf came out beautifully - nice amount of crispy crust and a moist interior. Wonderful stuff!

I always make substitutions to try to make things healthier. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesnt. Just a warning to others who like to substitute, my changes did not work out this time. I used whole-wheat flour, oil instead of butter, and skim milk. The result was a way-too-flat loaf. Whole-wheat is just too heavy and dense to manage without kneading. The bread tasted okay, but didnt rise enough. Would not make this again with those changes.

It really is a great recipe! I prepared it plane without the olives and thymes and it came out pefect even so! Mine looked like exactly the way it looks in the picture :-)thogh I must make the note that I added an extra cup od flour because I found the dough to be too much soft. It was crunchy outside and soft inside. It was very easy to prepare and my family loved it! I will for sure prepare it on regular basis.

Mine came out exactly as described, AND it looked like the picture! However, I am not a big fan of olives. (I thought I might be able to develop a taste for them. No such luck with this recipe) But this bread was decent, and not real hard to make. If I develop more of a taste for olives, I'll make it again.

Great bread. Didn't turn out as round as in picture, but really didn't matter. It was moist and I even brought it to a Thanksgiving dinner and impressed people. But to make whole process easier buy pitted olives. Cutting pitted olives is a pain.

Easy, messy recipe that turned out perfect. I used olive oil instead of butter, and it worked just fine. The dough was really wet and sticky, but I just plopped it on the baking tray. I don't have a spray bottle, so I put a dish of water in the bottom of the oven during the entire baking. The crust was crunchy and the inside moist. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. An amazing treat, especially considering there is no kneading.

This is very good bread, except for I thought it was too salty. Next time I will cut salt in half. My loaf also spread out on the sheet making it rather flat but it still was yummy. Next time I will use a loaf pan.

This is so yummy! I had some wonderful olives that were a mix of kalamata, black, and green and used these. It was so yummy. Mine didn't look ANYTHING like the picture. It probably was a little over an inch high. I was so tasty though. Maybe next time I would try placing it in a baking dish for more thickness. It was very easy to make too!

This is the second time I am baking this bread. The first time was for a dinner party where it got rave reviews. ( I did the "do ahaead"version) It is quite simple to make (I love the fact that there is no kneading involved) and extremely forgiving. All the quantities and times worked perfectly. I didn't need to add any extra flour or change the cooking time. Instead of forming it into two loafs I baked it in a Teflon pan as a huge round loaf. It is definitely a keeper.

As everyone says, be wary of the extremely sticky dough. I found the best way to prevent the dough from sticking to your hands as you work is to lightly coat your hands with olive oil. The frustrating mess notwithstanding, this bread is absolutely delicious and well worth the effort.

Rating: 3
I used 3/4 cup water with the milk, and 4 cups flour, and the dough still turned out fine. Definitely reduce the cooking time. Next time I'll try baking it all at 400 - I think it will cook the inside better and let the crust be a little thinner. But delicious anyway!

*** Though I love the original version, I just made this again with the following changes: (YUM!) Omit olives & thyme; Use: 2 cups whole wheat flour; 2 cups & a little extra white flour; 1 cup raisins; 1/2 cup chopped walnuts; 3 tsp sugar (instead of 2); 1 tsp salt (instead of 2) This is incredible--a wonderful, wheat-raisin-walnut loaf, made according to the instructions, though again reducing the baking time (and covering loosely with foil). Adding cinnamon would be a nice touch, too. Mmmmmm.

This bread came out extremely well, in part because of previous user comments. Rather than bake on a "baking sheet," I used a baguette pan. The pan prevented the very sticky and nearly-flowing dough from flattening out and instead forced it to rise. One warning, though. My baguette pan is perforated with lots of tiny holes. Next time, I will line it with parchment paper to allow the baked bread to come away easily. If you are used to the usual bread recipes, this "dough" will seem very strange. Not only should you not knead it, you couldn't if you wanted to. It is very, very sticky. I used at least 4 and 1/2 cups and would probably use a bit more next time. The resulting bread was great -- well-risen, soft inside and nicely crusty outside.

Outstanding! Like other reviewers, I was disappointed with the initial appearance of the "flat bread" as it came from the oven, assuming I had ruined yet another loaf of bread. However, I sliced into dipping size peices and served it with a great tapenade and my guests devoured both loaves, all asking for the recipe. It was truly restaurant-quality bread that I would liken more to foccacia than a loaf-style bread.From a non-olive fan, this is great bread!

Very very yummy!!! I used nonfat milk and it still came out delicious -- although it was a little flat, maybe I inadvertently skimped on the yeast. The recipe says that it makes two small loaves, yet mine were generously sized. I served one loaf at a dinner party and made croutons out of the other loaf. Delicious!

Extremely easy and tasty. If you're going to use the olives, definitely go the kalamata route rather than the tinned olives...tried both kinds and the latter does not have any sort of "olive-y" taste. I expected this to come out more like a baguette, but it's a more dense bread. If you don't have a water spritzer, just toss in a small cupful of water -- that's what I did and it seemed to work just fine. Also did not have thyme and used oregano instead -- seems to be a very versatile (or forgiving :) ) recipe -- experiment!

Yum-yum and so so so easy!!! I left out the olives..I don't care for them and had to use dried thyme. Used 1 percent milk-it's what I had on hand. It took less time to cook like 10 minutes less or so and had very crunchy crust. Served with beef stew. Husband finished off one loaf.

This bread is the best thing I have ever baked. I followed the recipe exactly... because I was finishing the flour in my house, I ended up using 2 cups of all purpose flour, 1 cup of bread flour, and 1 cup of whole wheat flour. I added a great deal more of whole wheat (easily more than the extra 1/2 cup) but the dough was still very sticky... I went ahead and let it rise overnight anyway. I baked mine perhaps too long - 10 minutes at 500 and 30 minutes at 400, but the inside is still chewy and the outside has a delicious crust. It really is as good as everyone says!!!

I made the bread without the herbs and olives and am pleased with the results. I cut the baking time by 15 minutes, but should have had about five minutes more patience. Considering this is my first attempt at bread-making since I was a Brownie (a very long time ago) I can't complain. I'll happily try this one again.

Wonderful bread, I made it for a party to serve with a appetizer of spinach (water squized out) Kalamata Olive spread, topped with feta cheese.baked for 15 minutes Everyone one loved it. The bread is easy to make and flavor is wonderful

Even when I screw this recipe up (like running out of flour) the flavor is still absolutley incredible. I also love that I don't have to knead this one. Sometimes I don't have the herbs for it, but I love black olives, so I don't miss the herbs.

Rating: 4
This is the best bread. Tastes more like an herb bread. Not a strong olive flavor. My guest could not believe olives were in this. I chopped green and black olives really fine in chopper. I also added rosemary, a little basil, and a little sage. It is awesome!!! A really crusty light French bread. Great alone. Also great to dip it in balsamic vinegar, parmesian cheese and olive oil all mixed up. YUM!!

This is definitely worth making. I made it for a family get together and it was huge hit. Even two guests who claimed not to ordinarily like olives came back for seconds and thirds. To be honest, I goofed up a little and didn't add quite enough flour and, though the dough was a little sticky to work with, it still came out great!

Rating: 4
I used my bread machine to make the dough and it worked very well. 4 cups of flour made a lighter bread with more air bubbles, 4.5 cups made a denser loaf. Both were great! Just poured the dough out and let sit for 15 minutes and then baked as per the others' comments. A definite do again!

bread success at last! best results from a yeast bread yet! i made this just plain, and took the good advice from others on shortening the baking time.. didnt use the entire xtra flour. crusty. tasty. will be making again with olives, herbs, and anything else kicking around the kitchen. delish out of the oven with butter.... and so easy!

This is my FAVORITE bread recipe -- no kneading!! I used the overnight method, and the dough rose perfectly. I only added 2 pinches of dried thyme, because I'm not a big fan of herby breads. I also cut down the baking time by 15 minutes, as suggested by others. This is as good as any olive bread that you get from a bakery. Next time I want to try adding prosciutto to the dough.

This is restaurant quality bread! I thought I was in a fabulous Chicago restaurant. Dont cook as long as it states! It also looks beautuful. Next time I make it I'll use a variety of fresh herbs instead of the olives. THIS WILL KNOCK YOUR SOCKS OFF!!

I love this recipe. I've made it on several occasions and it has gone over well every time! I cooked it a lot less than recommended (about 15 minutes less). Best part of this recipe - no kneading!

I thought this recipe was perfectly written. The bread came out deliciously crisp on the outside and light, airy and moist on the inside. I did need to add the extra 1/2 cup of flour. I will definitely make this bread again, and maybe try varying the add-in's at some point (sun dried tomatoes, basil etc. This recipe is a definite keeper!

I have made this recipe many times and it is always a success. I usually make it without the olives and thyme because my husband hates olives. I have made it both the day before and the day of and it works beautifully. BUT it does not need as much cooking time as the recipe says, so watch it very carefully.

Made this in my bread machine on dough cycle many times. Baked in oven. Always gets rave reviews. Texture is excellent. Use waxed paper dusted with flour after turning out of machine as it is very moist. This is a keeper if you follow the recipe and the instructions for dough cyle in bread machine.

Sorry folks, bad news. This recipe had some problem. My guess would be that it needed more flour. I added an extra cup and the dough was still too sticky to handle. I did not like the flavor enought to try the recipe again with more flour. What a disappointment.

I have had great success with this bread. It isn't beautiful, but it is so quick (for a yeast bread) and easy and delicious that I don't really care that it isn't gorgeous. I make it as written, I always think I'll have leftovers, and I almost never do.

A very different recipe for making bread. The crust was delicious and our guest kept going back for "just one more piece."

I've made this bread three or four times already. I leave out the olives and thyme and make it just plain (family doesn't like olives). It is easy and delicious. Once I made it as one big loaf rather than two small; then it works well for sandwiches. It has to bake a little longer, but not much. My oven seems to cook much faster than the recipe expects, though; my bread is usually done in twenty, not thirty-five, minutes after I turn the heat down to 400. So watch it.

What a great, crusty bread!! Not too difficult to make, considering that I don't work well with yeast! It's best the day it's made.

This recipe is a bit of a challenge. In our home we say 'looks bad, tastes good.' The bread never really reaches it's potential by not rising as well as it might. Baked it twice, so far, and the family loves it.
