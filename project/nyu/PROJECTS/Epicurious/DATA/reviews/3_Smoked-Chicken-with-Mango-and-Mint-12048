This is an easy beautiful recipe that looks impressive, but I admit the taste was a little bland. The second time I made it, I marinated the chicken in Trader Joe's Island Soyaki sauce...which is like a tropical pineapple terryaki sauce and the flavor went great with the mango and mint and totally made the dish. Now this is a dish I feel I will make again and know it will be tasty. The chicken definitely needs a little more flavor to complete it.

This is a fast, easy and delicious appetizer that is always a great addition to any of my parties. It may not be the one people ooh and ah over, but it's pretty and there's never any left. A staple!

I needed a quick dish to take to a party. I used marinated and grilled chicken breasts. While the tray looked very pretty, the taste was rather bland. Friends are used to me bringing the best dish on the table, but this was a real disappointment. Half of it was left, and probably went in the trash.

This is now an old favorite of my family and friends. One of the easiest recipes to make and so delicious. I have served it so often at dinner parties and its always a hit. I have just been asked for the recipe, again, by a couple that want to serve it at their 25th anniversary party.
