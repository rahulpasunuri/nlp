Good and easy but not fast. Tons of prep work, between scraping the corn off the cob (the fresh corn was sweet, so it was worth it), peeling the shrimp (at least they were deveined), and dredging the dozens of them (the large shrimp at my market was more like 30/lb). Tasted good. I used 3 of the chipoltes in the can of adobo and it had a nice kick. We all liked it, but not a meal to make in a hurry. We ate late.

This recipe is outstanding! I've made it several times now and just can't say enough about it... easy to prepare and absolutely delicious. This is a restaurant quality dish that will impress your family & friends. Serve it with a tossed salad for a delightful dinner. Try this one; you will not be disappointed!

I made this once before and it turned out great. I made it tonight and the shrimp was not crispy. The breadcrumbs were soggy on the bottom. Any ideas why?

I love this dish. Very easy and quick to prepare and pretty healthy! As others have suggested, I added a bit more chipotle and adobo to the mayo (you just have to taste and adjust to what you like). I also cooked the shrimp separately on a foil-lined cookie sheet, adding after the corn had already cooked for about 7 minutes.

I have nothing bad to say about this dish -- the shrimp was crisp, the fresh corn was cooked perfectly -- but it is also exactly what it says it is: shrimp on top of corn. That's it. Really nothing to get very excited about.

This was just okay. The chipotle flavor was not strong enough. That many shrimp don't fit comfortably in one layer of a baking dish, and I halved the recipe. It needed something else to make this a meal too, not sure what.

Rating: 4
Really tasty! I increased the chipotle and adobo by half again and added cayenne to the panko. Also cooked the shrimp separately -- all pre others' suggestions. This kicked the spice up a LOT, so beware if you don't like spicy. The only thing I regret was using canned corn. The recipe was easy and quick enough that it would have been well worth it to use fresh corn.

So delicious!!! Amazing! The shrimp are so crunchy and tasty and the spicy mayo balances the sweetness of the roasted corn. I think this would also be great in flour or corn tortillas, as tacos with 'roasted corn salsa'. I haven't tried it yet, but I will. Also, the roasted corn and scallions make a wonderful side dish for any summery meal. I served it with steak, to a bunch of men who NEVER eat veggies and they loved them.

I took Fairfax cook's advice for baking and additions to the panko. This is light and wonderful!

I made this as written with the exception of taking the advice of roasting the shrimp and corn independently, which worked very well. Note: the corn needs 18 minutes; the shrimp on their own only need about 10. Next time I will add some finely shredded Parmesan, and a little cayenne to the panko. All in all, very very good, particularly if you love sweet corn. After making it with fresh corn, I can't imagine using frozen corn.

We loved it, made it for some friends and they asked for the recipe. I just did the shrimp, no corn. Also I used the "juice" from the chipotles only and didn't chop any. We made it on vacation and found out our shrimp was already cooked, and no place to get more, and believe it or not it was still delicious!

Pretty good, especially considering how quick and easy it is. I only had two ears of corn, so threw the corn and scallion mixture in a pie dish, and layered shrimp on top. Not all the shrimp would fit, so I threw the rest in a second dish. The ones in a dish by themselves seemed more flavourful, probably because none of their coating came off. They also came out crisper. Next time I'll cook the corn and shrimp seperately. Next time I'll add a little more chipotle, I used two whole chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, and it didn't have quite enough spice. My fiance suggested it'd also be very tasty with a bit of lemon squeezed over it.

Unfortunately, this dish was really bland - i think you need to add salt to the shrimp coating or something. i was really disappointed b/c it looked so good.

Easy and tasty dish! Will make again.

Perfect for a quick weeknight dinner. Using fresh corn makes all the difference. I followed the recipe but added some chopped cilantro to the corn mixture. The scallions add just enough crunch, although my shrimp crisped nicely as well. Next time I might try adding asparagus tips or blanched snow pea pods for extra veggies.

I've made the shrimp (no corn/scallions) 3 times. Put the shrimp on a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Very crispy and delicious. If you don't like chipotle, mix some cocktail sauce in with the mayo instead.

This was wonderful--followed the recipe exactly but used frozen corn instead of fresh and still loved it! I will definitely be making this again.

This was really just OK. It was easier than it tasted, true, but it wasn't great. And... it looked a lot less beautiful than the picture. I know that's food styling and all, but it was really much more casserole-y than you might think.

This wasn't bad, but it doesn't live up to the hype. There are better recipies out there. I won't be making this again.

Oh my gosh . . . YUM! Excellent blend of flavors and easy to whip up for a week night meal. I used fresh breadcrumbs I had on hand and it still tasted delish!

All in all this was a solid recipe. The flavors were great, and although the shrimp were not as crisp as I had hoped for, they tasted very good and the corn was delicious. I decided to cook two pounds of large shrimp and since there was not enough space for all of the shrimp to cook on the corn, I cooked the extras on a baking sheet in the same oven. The batch of shrimp cooked on the baking sheet were quite a bit crispier than those cooked with the corn. Will definitely be making again.

I love this dish. Based on all the previous reviews, I made some changes. To tone down the heat of the chilis I added more mayo. Fresh corn makes all the difference. An easy way to remove the corn is to place the cob on the tube part of a bundt pan and let the corn fall into the pan as you cut away. I made the corn and the shrimp separate. Let the corn cook for about 8 minutes in the baking dish before putting the shrimp in the oven. Place the shrimp on a nonstick cookie sheet and cook it for about 10 minutes. DO NOT overcook the shrimp. When it begins to turn pink, take it out along with the corn. It will continue to cook from the heat of the cookie pan. My own addition was a bit of shredded sharp cheddar cheese to the top of the corn during the last minute of baking. Taste the chili mayo mixture and you will know if you want more or less heat and adjust to your preference. Do try this at least once.

pretty good, but neither my husband nor I were overwhelmed. it was actually a touch too spicey for my tender palate (perfect for his though) and the panko crust didn't get as crunchy on top as I'd hoped. might make it again though, just because it was so easy and quick.

I made this tonight for me and my grandpa, and I decided to make the full recipe, and we finished it off, it was that good. Definitely would make it again. My grandpa picked out a great Spanish white wine that paired absolutely wonderful with the recipe, along with a chardonnay that was good as well. It is so quick and easy that I will definitely make this again. I thought the spice was just right--it added a nice balance to the sweetness of the corn, yet in no way did it over power the recipe.

Rating: 2
Wish I could say I liked this recipe as much as others. There is a distinct smokey flavor coming from the adobo sauce that you either like or you dont. The shrimp are tasty but they definitely feel baked and I would strongly disagree with calling this dish "gratin-style" since there is no cheese, butter or béchamel sauce. I served it over steamed jasmine rice and it was fine but nothing great and probably not worth the effort of preparing the corn, peeling and cleaning the shrimp and cleaning out the food processor. Fine, but not especially memorable.

I was disappointed with this recipe. While I enjoyed the taste of the spicy chipotle peppers paired with the sweetness of the corn, the overall dish didn't taste that great. However, it is a quick and easy way to prepare breaded shrimp.

Wow...Who Knew? Easy and tasty. Totally worth the four fork rating. I followed several of the other reviewers' ideas and doubled the chipolte mayo mixture, adding a lil bit more of the chipolte. V-Good. Try it.

This was good (husband raved - I think he'd insist this was worthy of 4 forks). Thanks to a previous reviewer, I didn't put the shrimp on top of the corn mixture, and I do think that helped it be more crispy on the bottom. I punched up the chipotles some because we like our food spicy.

Rating: 4
really good. a little too spicy for our tastes so will cut back on the chipotle, but will definitely make again. the corn bit alone would make a good side dish

Wow! We LOVED this ... the shrimp was so plump and crispy...you have so many flavors going on, too: sweet, salty, spicy. Fresh corn off the cob is the way to go. Perfect summer dish!

Oh MY...Oh MY!!!! PLEASE try this...it is SO SO excellent! You have: crunchy, sweet, salty and spicy all at the same time...and SO easy! (Well, okay..went to Albertson's for the Gulf Shrimp...they didn't have any Panko so I had to drive to Publix, mind you, after work..) but at 8:30 p.m., we enjoyed a MOST delicious dinner!!! This is a truly awesome dish!

This was really quite tasty. Crisp, spicy, sweet. I used fresh corn which was a lot of work, I think I'll try with frozen next time. Besides the corn, the rest of the recipe was easy and quick. I'll definitiely make again.

I ended up with a few extra shrimp that I cooked on a silpat covered baking sheet. I enjoyed these shrimp even more than the ones on the corn as they were crispy on both sides. The shrimp cooked on the corn were soggy on the corn side. Great flavour!

This shrimp recipe was so tasty and easy to make; comes out crispy without frying-- DELICIOUS! I made two batches of chipotle mayo and omitted the salt the second time and didn't miss it. I used 6 cobs of fresh corn and it was plenty. Will make again and again.

Rating: 4
This gets a 4 for ease and combo of flavors....I don't think for 4 people you need 7 ears of corn and will cut down on that next time. Yes, like others, could use a bit more chipolte...served with roasted broccolini and cous cous with sauteed mushrooms, but you don't even need the cous cous.

Rating: 0
This is a very good recipe...as others have already said, it's great to find a crispy shrimp recipe that doesn't involve frying. Cutting 7 ears of corn off the cob is time consuming, but definitely worth the effort. Next time I will use more chipotles & add a side of rice (maybe I'm just a carbophile but I felt it needed something like that). I'll definitely be making this one again

I almost never give four forks, but this earned it. I liked the idea of crispy shrimp that has not been fried; this is better than any fried shrimp I've ever had, and it's EASY. The husband went nuts for it. I did use about 1/2 again more chipotle, which came out just right for our tastes. The fresh corn is way worth the trouble of cutting it off the cobb. I recommend "Ian's" panko crumbs, found with the other breadcrumbs in the store or in the natural foods section, not with the Asian foods. "Ian's" has waaaaay better ingredients than regular panko crumbs, and it worked perfectly. The shrimp was tender and the panko perfectly crispy. Also did not puree anything (so omitted the water). Came out FANTASTIC. I'll never fry shrimp again.

Easy prep, skipped the food processor, just chopped the corn and scallions. Used 10-15 shrimp from Costco which were perfectly cooked. It was quickly devoured. We are doing this again, but with Old Bay, more chipotle and maybe some Cajun spice, plus a dipping sauce.

I loved this recipe, even though I totally messed it up. I added all of the mayo mixture to the corn (because I wasn't paying attention), so I made a little more to coat the shrimp. Total winner recipe.

Rating: 3
A little overboard on the salt, would back it off a bit. Conversely, I would up the chipotle level up a tad. I think it said to bake the corn but I didn't, also I cooked it for about 16 minutes and the shrimp was right on. Also, I mixed some rice vinegar with some adobo sauce and scallions to make a little drizzle for the shrimp, and that topped it off nicely.

I thought this was absolutely delicious. My husband did too. I added more chipolte and used lowfat mayo. This was one of my favorite recipes of this year. We are having a big 60th party for my husband and this will be the main course. Use fresh corn - it makes a difference.

Made this tonight and was very impressed. Used frozen corn and skipped the pulsing step - just mixed the corn, little of the chipotle mayo (used veganaise), and green onion in bottom of dish. Garnished with fresh cilantro. Excellent

This was delicious! We've been on a chipotle kick lately, incorporating them into lots of different recipes, and this was great. Using fresh corn (and maybe kicking up the chipotle level a notch or two) was key! We're making this one for company....
