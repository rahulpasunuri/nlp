My company loved this recipe. I used white wine vinegar as a previous poster, it was delicious. Also added a little cayanne pepper to the flour mixture. The taste lingers on.....

The remoulade sauce needed some changes. I deleted the oil and added mayonaise. I also added 1 Tbsp. capers. To the flour mixture I added Old Bay seasoning as well as the salt and pepper. This was really very good! We live on a lake that produces a lot of Crawfish and where I come from we call this "Cajun Popcorn"

This is delicious. However it was a little too acidic for my taste - so I used white wine vinegar in place of distilled. I also added capers, 2 tbsp mayonaisse and fresh basil mmmm...
