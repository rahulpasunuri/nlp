It is much easier to just make CHEESE GRITS and is really more of a Derby Dish than the Hominy Grits Souffle

A bit time intensive but well worth it. I butter and then coat the sides of a souffle dish with grated parma to held it climb and hold its height. Clients love it.

I wouldn't make it again because it was too labor-intensive for a weeknight meal. Stirring those grits for 17 minutes nonstop is hard!

A nice fluffy side dish to go with my salt rubbed chicken tenders. it was feel good food, easy to make, easy to dish up and very easy to eat. even my super picky sister-in-law liked it. I only had quick cooking grits, so i cooked them for a little less time, and they turned out great. bravo craig!
