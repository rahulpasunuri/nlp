I made these largely out of curiosity. I had to go to 3 grocery stores to get all the ingredients & the tab came to around $50. The cupcakes aren't bad; I am sure that they would be a nice treat for those on restricted diets. Their flavor is good, but the texture is a bit more gummy than that of cupcakes made with wheat flour. The icing really needs food coloring - it's an unappetizing tan without it. Also, it has a strong coconut flavor & many would interpret it as coconut icing. I would make these again, but only for someone on a gluten-free diet.

Shopping for these ingredients took almost as much time as cooking the cupcakes. If you don't already have some of these items lying around then you may want to price it out before committing to making them. As for taste, I was impressed with them, considering they were vegan. However, I made these for two little boys with dairy and egg allergies. They ate half of them and then said "meh." My own kids won't eat them, either, so now I have some very expensive cupcakes in the freezer.... Bottom line, these are probably great for vegan friends or people on a very restricted diet, but not for kids that are used to regular candies and cakes.

This is an amazing recipe! Which is good, because it is insanely expensive to make compared to a normal cupcake recipe. Only make it for someone you really like. I agree that you should not attempt it without a stand mixer. Cupcakes are definitely best on the day they are made, but the frosting needs to sit a long time in the fridge to get to proper consistency. Make it the day before.
