Very good but something's missing. Will try it with a couple of cloves of chopped garlic next time.

Add potatoes half an hour into simmering everything else, or they'll turn to mush. Also don't cut them too small. I didn't have beef broth, so I used chicken stock instead. The lamb was really tender. I'll change my rating once I've made it properly.

I think this recipe is great! Simple and yes, you do have to use 10 bay leaves (or similar); I used 8 small fresh bay leaves, and it gave the stew a very fresh, characteristic flavor.

This was delicious and very easy to make. I used gold yukon potatoes instead of russet because I had those on hand and I doubled the carrots and the beef broth. My husband and I loved it.

My 4 kids loved this! It needs a little tweaking- I read other reviews and adopted many of them. It's very tasty- I agree that it's a little "single not" but very flavorful. I added a bag of frozen peas, doubled the carrots, doubled the beef broth, used almond meal flour (gluten free recipe), and added Bisto gravy mix ( a great UK product that enhances dark gravies). Net result was a sumptuous stew.

Made this using red potatoes skin on. A good stew that focuses very strongly on the lamb; it is definitely the star of the show here. A little bit one-note, but that note is very delicious.

Great stew but I omit potaties and add baby bellas instead. Served over egg noodles...my kids loved it!

Made this for St. Patrick's day as a change from the usual corned beef. I made it in a crock pot and used a mix of Irish garden herbs (rosemary, thyme, chives). I used red potatoes and kept the skins on, and used more carrots. Came out great. Even the kids gobbled it up.

Sweetie and I really loved the stew and felt like it was as close to authentic Irish stew as any we've tasted. I made a few changes to the ingredients and prep. First, instead of russet potatoes I used Yukon Gold. I prefer a sturdier potatoe in my stew. I also only used 3 bay leaves and even at that I was a bit worried that it was going to be too strong. 10 bay leaves...is that a typo? I browned the lamb then added the broth and seasonings. I let simmer for about 30 minutes before adding the vegetables. Also, I didn't add the flour early on. Instead I made a roux with 2 tbs butter and 2 tbs flour then added one cup of beef broth to make a gravy. I added the gravy mixure the last 15 minutes. The leftoverswere eaten the next day at lunch. On a cold Pacific Northwest afternoon, it was eye-rolling good. Sweetie had a Guinness and I had a nice red wine.

Very good stew. Next time I'd increase the lamb to 1 1/2 pounds. I like carrots so increase them and use chicken broth for a lighter taste. But great recipe as is. Added frozen peas at end of cooking time and used frozen pearl onions in place of boiling onions. 2nd time added finely chopped onion to the end of browning lamb. Always reduce broth for more flavor prior to adding to recipe. Did use a little Demi-glaze. Cut lamb into 1/2 inch pieces. Used fresh Rosemary sprigs in place of thyme.

A great dish for those cold winter nights. Fairly simple to make.

Oh my God! This dish is the simplest, scrumptious dish for winter. It's fail-safe and bascily cooks itself. This will be making many an encore performance at our table. Thank you!

I made this recipe thanks to the rave reviews, and found it to be nothing special. the lamb was tender, but the actual stew itself was pretty bland, and a little too sweet, not savory, due to the carrots and onions.

We made this recipe for a dinner party and it went over very well. Bought beautiful lamb at the KaDeWe and had the expert butcher cut it for us. I was a little dubious at first, it was so simple and it didn't look like anything spectacular, but this recipe really lets the lamb speak for itself. Served with red wine, this dish started a dinner party that lasted well into the Berlin night.

Excellent flavor. Tried the thyme for the first batch, then the rosemary in the second. Definitely preferred the rosemary. Also, the veggies and potatoes get mushy if you cook for one hour, so definitely put in after at least a half hour of simmering. Reheats wonderfully too!

This stew was delicious! I also added peas at the last minute and we devoured every morsel. Serve with some crusty french bread and nice red wine and you are happy,happy,happy!

This was really tasty :) I replaced the tyme with rosemary then added about 1/4 cup of dijon mustard in with the onions, Then I cooked the lamb/onions in the broth for about 1 hour then added the veggies. Cooked it for about 30 mins more really good, will make again

This dish was very tasty. The onion, potatoes & carrots only took 20 minutes to be tender so don't add them as soon as recipe says. I also added peas at the last minute and we had a hardy meal that was enjoyed by all.

Great recipe! I changed it slightly, I used a stock pan rather that the dutch oven. I also tripled the recipe (big Irish family). I also added portobello mushrooms and a little rosemary. Give it a try.

This was okay, but not excellent. One thing I would change if making it again would be to cook it less - the potatoes seemed got really mushy.

Easy to make and quite delicious. I used leftover lamb and it came together in a flash.

I've made this dish twice in a crock pot, and I didn't brown the meat, but it was very satisfying. For crock pot cooking, I placed the potatoes on the bottom. I substituted cilantro for the parsley and placed it on top. A nice rice dish to serve with it is the Saffron-Cardamom Rice.

The recipe was just so simple to follow. The stew itself comes put very tender and rich tasting. I can't make it often enoudg for my family. It goes great with a cood bottle of cab.
