chose this recipe to use some oj and short ribs we had on hand, and the smoked paprika sounded like a nice addition. i tossed the frozen ribs in the crock pot, added oj, paprika, cumin, salt, a few cloves of garlic and and onion. let that go until the meat was tender then set the meat aside and reduced the cooking liquid on the stove until it was thick and glaze-like and served it with corn cakes and chopped salad with salsa vinaigrette. very tasty flavors inspired from this recipe!

Outstanding. The sause was incredible, really got that smokey taste from the paprika. Will definitely make again and will defintely try the sauce with other meats.

Interesting recipe. I've never had beef ribs before. Pretty tasty recipe. Fairly inexpensive meat. Extremely easy to make. Good for a weeknight meal.

This is super easy and super tasty!! I used hot paprika since I didn;t invest the time in finding smoked paprika. Served it with some corn fritters and salad.

The flavor was great but the 'meaty ribs' (ie short ribs) are just too dang tough to be cooked this fast. There was no eating these as is. I threw them in the crockpot the next day with the sauce and some extra liquid: very good.

Thought this sounded weird enough to be good - but it wasn't. Flavours just didn't work for me and I really love smoked paprika. I won't even try and doctor this one up.

Thank the cook from Bethseda! We love ribs, but the more tender the better! I will attempt the smoker and can't wait to try the sauce. Get tired of the same ol BBQ type sauce. This one might be sweet enough for the kids!

I liked the contrast of flavors. Next time, I think I'll try it with Pork!

When I saw this recipe, I realized right away how I could simplify it. Have you heard of the chipotle sauce called HOT SQUEEZE?? It's smokey and sweet and has a perfect "kick". I followed your recipe, using the dry rub and then basted on Hot Squeeze at the end. Amazing! And so simple. This sauce works on everything! Everybody needs to know about it.

It's a very rare day when I suggest that we have ribs for dinner, beef ribs no less, but after reading the recipe I was just in the mood. We doctored up the rub a bit, adding a little extra cayenne and other seasonings. I made the sauce as directed and I thought that these were excellent. Sure, a little tough, even over the low heat, but I was ready for that so was not disappointed. I really loved the sauce! I used King Kelly marmalade which has nice long strips of orange in it, and the ribs were beautiful. I appreciated how simple this recipe was to prepare and thought that the flavor was excellent - but then orange marmalade and smoked paprika are 2 of my favorite things. I would use the rub and sauce recipe for any ribs, beef, pork, whatever. Because of the richness, I served the ribs with the Sweet Slaw recipe that was on the same page in Bon Appetit (designed to go with grilled asian flank steak) and some very simply roasted asparagus spears. Great dinner, not healthy, not tender, not fancy, but perfect for a simple Memorial Day dinner at home.

I love orange and smoked paprika, but this just didn't hit on all spokes for us. Thankfully, I made the sauce ahead and tasted it before proceeding with the recipe. Once we tasted the sauce, we decided this was not the one for us. The flavors just didn't marry well. I had already rubbed the ribs with the s&p, cumin and smoked paprika. We just proceeded to grill them with our own BBQ sauce and they were wonderful. I do agree with previous reviewer that back ribs require a low and slow cooking method. We used thin cut flanken style ribs, which grill up quickly and always turn out tender. That would be the cut of rib I would suggest if you try this recipe. Frankly, we weren't impressed by this sauce.

This is a great recipe! But here are some hints. 1. Smoke your own paprika in a skillet. It is very easy to do. Put the paprika in a small pan and toast it. 2. In my opinion back ribs are best cooked slowly on a smoker. This also imparts better flavor. I did mine for 6 hours at 225 3. Put the dry rub on the night before cooking and then mop the sauce on at the 3 hour mark and every hour after that. I Used a hot, wet smoking technique with hickory wood. DO NOT BE DISCOURAGED. Get a smoker it is worth it. I smoke our Thanksgiving day turkey every year as well as trout for passover. And numerous other meats throughout the year. The grilling here just seemed two short and may result in significant charring of the sugars from the OJ and marmalade
