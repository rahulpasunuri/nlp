Used cut up pieces of country ham instead of bacon, and omitted the lemon pepper, instead just using salt and pepper. This was absolutely delicious...even a friend who had never tried turnip greens liked this.

Leftovers? What leftovers? This was excellent!

Wow. We had never had turnips greens before, but I wanted to try them when we got a big bunch of turnips from our CSA this week. We left out the bacon and used freshly grated lemon zest with lots of pepper (didn't have lemon pepper on hand), and this was awesome. My husband wants to keep all the leftovers to himself for his lunch on Monday!

After almost throwing away the greens from the turnips that came in my organic produce box, I decided to keep them and look for a recipe instead. Am I glad I did! This was fabulous, made almost exactly as written although I sauteed bacon and onion for about 5 extra minutes and mixed lemon zest with pepper as I didn't have any pre-made lemon pepper. Served over brown rice for dinner!

As mentioned by other reviewers, I tried this as a last-ditch effort to redeem heretofore mysterious turnip greens from the compost (I'm a Northeastern girl, whaddo I know??). My veggie-and-particularly-greens- averse husband loved them. Of course, he loves pretty much anything involving bacon grease and hot sauce. Anyway, I recommend and will make again if ever confronted by turnip greens.

Easy and delicious! Greens are never going into the compost bin again.

simple, easy and great for those green tops. I left out the bacon and used lemon and pepper. There are some really good flavors in this recipe!

We belong to a CSA and had turnip greens that we were going to compsost till we found this recipe. We used some of our organic farm fresh onions, with a high quality cured bacon. The dish smelled so good we could hardly wait for it to be done. The louisanna hot sauce added yet another dimension with it's tangy spicyness Perfectly delicious!

I also bought my turnips at the Farmers' market, so I followed another reviewer's tip and included the stems as well as leaves. I followed the recipe as written and the result was pure comfort food. The seasonings are excellent and this was a fairly easy recipe!

I had never used lemon pepper before, but as its main ingredient is salt, this dish came out WAY too salty, with the 1 T of lemon pepper and no added salt. Too much bacon for my taste, also. Next time I'll stick to just sauteeing my greens with a little olive oil and garlic!

I made this with Kolrabi and it's greens. We loved it. I will definately make this again with turnips.

I bought turnips at the farmer's market and they came with greens attached, so I searched for how to cook them and tried this recipe. Include stems or just the leaves? Included the stems, it was the right choice. This was delicious. Added a little half-and-half at the very end. Excellent.

What a pity it would have been to toss away those delicious, nutritious greens. If you don't have a REALLY large bunch, use a bit less bacon. The Tabasco gives it a real zing. Served it with brown rice.
