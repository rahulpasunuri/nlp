We hadn't fixed this recipe for several years, but pulled it out last night. It's much better than we remembered! I thought there were a few too many capers, but my husband didn't. The flavors blend remarkably well and nothing overpowers. It's not lowfat, but once in a while, it's good to do cream & cheese. It went together quickly, too. And by the way - I cannot imagine using coconut milk & black olives! Don't rate a recipe if you aren't going to cook that recipe!

Interesting option: substitute unsweetened coconut milk and black olives for cream and capers.
