Like a good wine, the flavors in this soup are multi-layered and hit you in parts of your palate that are new. Used half homemade chicken stock, and half free-range stock. We had the soup alone, with a hearty French bread. But maybe in Tunisia (we've only been to Morocco) it's a starter. I found myself craving lamb roasted on a spit. And I don't even eat lamb.

This is an amazingly tasty soup, perfect for the winter months, and a good way to get your greens! I used ground cumin instead of whole cumin, and Sriracha sauce instead of harissa, with great results.

Be careful with the harissa -- for me there was a fine line between not enough and too much. I did use a variation of the global gourmet harissa recipe that other reviewers have recommended. I didn't put in noodles because I have a bad cold & didn't have any egg noodles. I think the noodles would have solved my "too much harissa" problem. Otherwise the soup was delicious. I recommend chopping the chard stalks pretty small -- easier to brown and fits better with the soup. All in all, a healthy, pretty easy to make soup.

This is a wonderful soup, and the harissa is really easy to make on your own. It is a mix of spices that a lot of us have at home (chili flakes, garlic, cumin, paprika, etc - check the recipes that people have posted here), and it turned out pungent and unbelievably tasty. I'm looking forward to using the harissa for other recipes as well. I used small white beans instead of chickpeas. Careful with the amount of egg noodles - they expand! Mine kind of took over the soup. Next time I'll use less.

I am completely thrilled about this soup. It is delicious and beautiful! I made my own harissa and I used dried/soaked chickpeas and 100% whole wheat udon noodles to make it even more nutritous. I served with optional accompaniment of roasted chicken thighs rubbed with cinnamon, cumin and yogurt. Yum! I will definitely make this again.

Oh my god, this came out SO well; subtle flavors and nice heat.

I thought the soup was bland and one-note in spite of the spice. By boyfriend agreed, though being a good sport he finished his bowl. I am willing to believe that a home-made/good quality broth would have made a big difference. I used bouillon, so maybe I got what I deserved, though I've used bouillon in other recipes where it hasn't made too much of a difference. Used kale instead of chard (not a big chard fan), ground toasted cumin and homemade harissa.

This soup is amazing. The key is to make your own harissa, and to add roasted chicken. You may also want to add stock, so have extra on hand. I used this harissa recipe, and it was excellent. Start with 1.5 tablespoons. http://www.globalgourmet.com/food/special/2002/spiceherb/harissa.html

Very nice. Easy to do. Used ground cumin, store-bought imported harissa, and vegetable broth. Really nice flavor. Will definitely make again.

This soup is absolutely wonderful but its flavor lies with the harissa. It is really worth making it yourself since the harissa in cans and tubes is barely edible in my opinion. Here is a link with a fabulous harissa recipe: http://www.globalgourmet.com/food/special/2002/spiceherb/harissa.html

Blandness was definitely a problem, but it improved on the second day. I added a shredded quarter of rotisserie chicken on the reheat and it made a ton of difference - if I had it to do over again, I'd have it in from the beginning. The chickpeas are fine but add almost nothing in terms of flavor.

Absolutely fantastic. Made it without the cumin seeds, just used ground cumin instead, but was still incredible. Next time I'll get the seeds.

This was good - i like the Chipotle Chicken Tortilla Soup from this website better. The flavor of the soup gets better the next day. I added the fire roasted tomatoes as suggested and added half a shredded chicken (from when i made the broth). I got the harissa at williams sonoma

My husband and I loved this soup, and we thought it was very flavorful--not at all bland. I made my own harissa, which I think was key, and I added some chopped celery with the onion and chard stems. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. We added more harissa to our bowls as we ate.

I had tons of chard from the CSA and my husband is sick. The perfect way to use chard. This is delicious, although next time I would like to add lima beans as well. Whole Foods Market does a similar version with lima beans which is excellent. I completely agree that toasting the cumin is really worth it. I used a mortar and pestle to grind.

This is a great soup that got rave reviews at my house. I also cheated and used ground cumin with great result. Upon tasting the soup, however, I wanted a bit more of a complex flavor, so I added some fresh cilantro and rotisserie chicken that I had on hand and it turned out fantastic. I kept thinking how you could replace the noodles with some matzoh balls and it would make a great passover soup!

I've made this soup several times and it's been great every time. Quick and flavorful plus it's healthy! The only substitution I made was ground cumin.

Lovely soup. I added fire oasted toamtoes -- that was a great suggestion! Toasting the cumin gave it a wonderful flavor. I tried a tiny bit of sour cream ot a spearate sample bowl after the meal -- it was wonderful with & w/o a cream.

Just made this, with a few substitutions (beet greens for chard and chicken for chick peas), and it was excellent. Unfortunately my husband didn't like it, but I enjoyed it enough to make it again anyway.

Really great! I didn't have harissa so used a dried chili instead. I know it's tempting to use ground cumin, but I think toasting whole seeds brings a lot of depth to dishes. I don't have a spice grinder, but I just crushed the toasted seeds with a wooden spoon.

Very good. I skipped toasting the cumin and used cumin powder, and instead of harissa used habanero sauce. It was very delicious.

I was looking for a recipe to use harissa, and this one turned out to be outstanding. Really flavorful, and with the chickpeas and greens, it feels so healthy. To make it faster, we didn't toast our own cumin - just used cumin powder, and it turned out fine. This recipe served two of us for three nights - we added a salad and bread.

This recipe leaped out at me as the ideal embodiment of my New Year's resolution to eat more veggies and legumes, in keeping with the Mediterranean diet. While the flavors and ingredients were interesting, the recipe as written was surprisingly bland, despite the heat of the harissa. I proceeded to adulterate it by adding a 15-oz can of fire-roasted tomatoes, and the smokiness and acidity really woke things up. I would definitely make this again, but I consider the fire-roasted tomatoes an essential addition.

Really great recipe. I didn't have any harissa so used 1 tablespoon of Rooster sauce. Will make again

Fabulous soup. I used broccoli rabe instead of chard and added a tablespoong of Ajavar, the new comdiment I cannot do without.
