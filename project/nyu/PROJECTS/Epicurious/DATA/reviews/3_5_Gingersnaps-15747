These are awesome cookies! *NOTE: The recipe calls for 1.5 STICKS of butter, not cups! I see that I'm not the only one who made this mistake and had to then double the recipe! *I added a litle extra of each spice that is called for. *These cookies spread a LOT - I could only put 8 on a sheet for baking. * Buy the turbinado sugar - you need more than you can get by lifting little packets from the local coffee shop, and it really does make a nice addition. *I'll try the recommendation of reducing the butter next time just to see how they turn out.

Perfect gingersnaps. Followed the recipe exactly. Took them to a potluck and wanted to hover over the bowl so others wouldn't eat them and I could take them home! Even my picky husband and toddler liked them.

I made these cookies to go with a Gingersnap-Crusted Ham with Apricot-Mustard Sauce (AWESOME--google it). The cookies worked just fine for the recipe, but I was hoping that a gingerSNAP would have a little more, well, SNAP to them. These were a little cakey for my tastes, but still very good flavor-wise. They come out looking very nice with the sugar on them!

My go-to recipe for this type of cookie, with or without the accompanying mousse. I underbake them at 9 minutes, then call them molasses spice crinkles. Great with finely chopped crystallized ginger added before the final addition of flour. I have frozen the sugar-rolled balls of dough in a zip-top bag so I can bake fresh whenever the mood strikes.

These were good; I doubled the spices and added a couple of shakes of black pepper. If you flatten them with a glass or in your palm, they won't get the characteristic cracked look of gingersnaps. I make them smaller: somewhat rounded measuring teaspoonfuls. The parchment paper is totally unnecessary. I sprayed the pans very lightly with a cooking spray and the cookies came off the pans easily.

These were great as big soft cookies served warm with ice cream. Form the dough into balls a little bigger than a walnut and bake them just until they are just barely set. Serve immediately with a scoop or two of vanilla ice cream and a sprinkling of cinnamon.

I have not tried this recipe, but discovered that adding a dash or two of cayenne pepper to my "standard" recipe gives gingersnaps that "kick" that makes it so good.

Yummy gingersnaps! I might go a little heavier on the spice, but in all these were fantastic. Went well with homemade vanilla ice cream!

I love these gingersnaps! I packed them up as holiday gifts and they got rave reviews.

These didn't turn out that great for me. Would probably flatten cookies before baking and add more ginger if I ever make them again...

This recipe always has a perfect turnout. I like to double up the spice. A perfect crowd pleaser and super easy to make!

This is a great recipe! I originally made it for the crust to the Pumpkin Chiffon Mousse, but my family loved the leftover cookies. Even my mother, who doesn't care for cookies, liked it.

Loved them. Worked well as softer cookies, I didn't try them as crisp because my family doesn't like them that way. Didn't change a thing.

I looked for a gingersnap recipe just to compare it to my own traditional one and this is the exact recipe! This is divine with lemonade on a summer day! One thing though, I always press mine down with a fork because I like them a little bit crispier and I make them much smaller-I usually make 96 cookies instead of 56. Hey, it just means you can eat more!

Reminded me of pumpkin pie during the prep. I was a bit skiddish on baking these up, since I'm not a pumpkin pie fan but decided to take a chance. Whoo! I'm glad that I did! These are great, even if they do leave a bit of an after taste. But that can be remedied with milk. Enjoy!!

Just wonderful. Gingersnaps are a perfect combination of some of my favorite flavors, and I like them crunchy OR soft--doesn't matter. These were not crunchy, or really soft either, but sort of in between. I made these for my cookie giveaways this past Christmas. Forced myself to, indeed, give (almost all of) them all away.

These were great! I made them for the first time for Christmas and they were a hit! I made another batch for my New Year's Party and used them as the crust for mini cheesecakes -- really good! Definitely a keeper!

Not very snappy at all. I really like the spicy and gingery-ness of real ginger snaps, and these just didn't cut it, even after putting in more spice than the recipe called for. I'd say some fresh ginger was in order.

Made for holiday gift giving. Made the first batch too small -- less than an inch. These got crispy and had a good flavor. I much preferred the second batch, however, which were more like 1 1/4 inch balls, and they cooked up just right. Very chewy in the center and super tasty, even a few days after baking.

I liked these fine, but they were too sweet for my taste, and not spicy enough - real gingersnaps should have more of a kick! I would recommend the recipe from The Best Recipe.

Help please! I do not have a review, but a question. When a recipe asks for brown sugar what type am I supposed to use? Light brown (golden) or dark?

Made this recipe exactly as directed and came out wonderful. I will definately make these again. The only change I would make would be to add slightly more of each spice to kick it up just a bit.

Incredible cookies. They were soft and perfectly spiced. I added the zest from one orange and a teaspoon of orange extract to give them an unusal kick, and they were the most popular Christmas cookies I made this year. Yuuuuum.

If you want flat, rock-hard cookies with a sharp bite, don't make these. This recipe yields tender cookies with a pleasantly spicy flavor that appeals to both children and adults. I followed the recipe to the letter, and the results were outstanding. It only produced about 40 cookies, though, not the 56 as promised.

Most definitely, add more spices. I served these cookies as a great counter point to the ultra sweet wedding cake I made for a friend...people asked for more cookies than cake! Easy to make, perfect for holiday baking with kids. But be sure to increase the spice! Makes a big difference.

This is a wonderful recipe, and is my most frequently requested cookie during the holidays. It even converted my boyfriend, who was a cookie purist (only chocolate chip & peanut butter cookie snob), to a gingersnap-lovin' fool. I also grind leftover cookies up to make a pie crusts. They go particularly well with Sweet Potato Pie. Make this recipe! You won't be disappointed.

Very good; chewy, not crunchy. I only put in 1 stick of butter, and I doubled all the spices. I also added 1 teaspoon nutmeg.

To A Cook from Seattle, WA on 11/19/03. I use shortening insead of butter and my cookies come out chewy. Hope this helps.

These cookies are certainly soft, and remain soft days later, which is one thing I like about them. However, I was hoping for a chewy cookie and my batch wasn't chewy - does anybody have ideas about how to make these chewy? I, too, was liberal with the spices, at least doubling them, because I love ginger. I used 1 cup butter as was recommended by another reader.

My father has a great recipe, way better than this! However, these cookies are easier than some recipes I have encountered. Besides, kids love to make cookies!

These are the perfect gingersnap, in my mind. Of course, I like a softer bite to the cookies. Straight out of the oven (after cooling slightly), they've got a great crispness on the outside with a soft center--upon storage overnight they became softer overall. I think these are actually even better the next day. Not too sweet at all. And definitely be liberal with the ginger and cloves! This will become a staple cookie in my house!

Perfectly adequate, soft cookies. I doubled all the spices. I also rolled some of the dough out and made cutouts - they were also good, but were quite soft (almost a stale consistency).

Didn't like these at all. They were way too sweet for my taste, and mine missed the 'crunchy on the outside' part. Will not be making these again.

AMAZING!!! I added one teaspoon of nutmeg, but only had salted butter so that's what I used, and only chilled for one hour. These cookies really put store-bought ones to shame.

These are perfect cookies - crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I reduce the butter to 1 stick (don't need that extra half) and add a ton more spices - white pepper, fresh ginger, cardamom, nutmeg - they turn out wonderfully!

FANTASTIC!!! Everyone loved these! Many asked for the recipe. The texture of these cookies is just wonderful. Crispy on the outside chewy on the inside, just how a Gingersnap should be. I have made these over and over again!

Very tasty and pretty cookies, more soft than crisp but still very good.

These had a wonderful taste, though they didn't puff up and collapse as promised. Instead they became little gum-drop shaped tea cakes that tasted great with coffee! A really great addition is to roll them in SANDING SUGAR instead of regular --a large grained sparkling sugar that adds a professional touch. Available from www.bakerscatalogue.com

The only bad thing about these cookies is how addictive they are! Seriously, I love how much softer and moister they are than the traditional gingersnaps. Someone at work said they reminded him of happy-brownies from the 60s!

Made these with my niece who likes spicy cookies so we tried these. We were impressed by how professional they looked & how great they tasted. We have both made them again & everyone (even those who aren't "gingersnap people") loves them.

I have used this recipie many times, each with great success. The cookies taste great and are easily stored if you want to make them ahead of time. The recipie is also very simple for those who do not bake often.

I usually don't like gingersnaps at all. I made these only for crust for a cheesecake, but because I accidently used double the butter, I had to make double the recipe, and had many, many cookies left over. But they were good! They didn't have the overwhelming molasses flavor of most gingersnaps. I took the leftovers to a family gathering and everyone loved them.
