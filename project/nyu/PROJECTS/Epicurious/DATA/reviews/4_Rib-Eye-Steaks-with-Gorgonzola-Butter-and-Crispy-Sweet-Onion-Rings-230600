Great recipe, the butter can be frozen and reused easily with this or other meals.

I made this years ago when it was featured in the magazine for a dinner party ( one of my first ) and everyone loved it. Since then I have made the butter for a family BBQ and they put it on everything but the steaks and still raved.

We made this for NY's eve dinner, and it got rave reviews all the way around. Only change we made was I rubbed in some herbs de provence with the olive oil on the steaks. The butter really went well with the steaks, as did the onion rings. We did the onion rings in a deep fryer and they had a great light taste.

Absolutely exceptional! The only change we made was adding basil instead of parsley to the butter. The gorgonzola butter complemented the steaks so well and onion rings were the perfect side. I just woke up from a nap to find my husband making me this exquisite meal. One of the best meals I've eaten.

I was disappointed with this. =/ I gave it two forks only because I burned the onion rings (and felt they were necessary to complete the flavour of the dish). The steak and butter without the rings was really lacking. =/ Crumbling some blue cheese on my steak would've been easier and more flavourful. Gorgonzola is a bit too mild, and once mixed with the butter became almost undetectable.

The steak was very nice, the butter, however is what makes it special. Very honestly, I would have preferred to use a different cut of meat for it. The butter is phenomenal. I went by the recipe and it was glorious tasting on the beef, the gorgonzola is just delicate enough to compliment the flavor of the meat while still being present on the palate. The onion rings were FANTASTIC. I know it sounds like they require an unbelievable amount of work, but if you're doing a special dinner, it's worth the time. I wasn't planning on how time consuming they were, but if you feel like cooking for a bit, they are completely worth it taste wise. Also, if you are going to make the onion rings, pre flour all of your rings and set them aside in a separate dish. Doing a few at a time is a sweet and romantic idea, but the logistics of it is stupid. I did a few that way and realized that by the time I had floured the next 5 my oil was too hot. It's much faster and more fun to just be able to plop 5 in, let them get nice and crisp and be able to move on instead of getting yourself covered in flour again. Altogether, great meal.

This was really yummy! We made it for our anniversary dinner and had no regrets! The kids were melting over the steaks, we loved the butter (i froze back the rest in small portions per suggestions from other viewers) Had Cab sauv. and made choc. pts de creme for desert. EXQUISITE!

PS-I will keep some of butter in the freezer to swirl in all kinds of dishes!

Kill me now. We love steaks with all kinds of butter melted on top but the roasted garlic made this incredibly good. And, I mixed a tiny bit of truffle butter in as well. Left out the cheese and served it on the side as it is too cloying for me. Sauteed some sweet onions, made smashed taters with a little of the garlic butter stirred in, and that was it. Drank a big fat spicy Zin. (Cosentino's Cigarzin, to be exact.) Hubby says this rivals anything he has had at a steak house. High praise indeed!

One of the most indulgent and satisfying meals. The butter is fantastic and on potatoes as well, a delicious treat. I didn't have gorgonzola, but blue cheese substituted beautifully. Spend the money on the steaks - get a great cut and swoon.

I love cooking steaks... broiling them specifically and I LOVE dipping my steaks in butter (Ruths Chris turned me on to that). When I found this recipe, I was a little skeptical since it was the first link on Google... but I tried it anyways. I didn't make the onion rings (didn't have buttermilk), but I made the butter - it was P-H-E-N-O-M-I-N-A-L. We host a lot and I had enough leftover for three dinner parties. I served the butter at all of them. Everyone asked, "where I got it from" and someone else asked if Bonefish gave me some. As we speak, I'm making some more - just to have some to dip some bread in later as a snack.

Oh. My. God. This is the most decadent, rich, delicious thing I've ever eaten, and I can say safely that after attempting the recipe once I ate steak at least once a week just to use more of the gorgonzola butter. I used dried parsley instead of fresh, but it was still the most divine steak I've ever had. I've served it to friends at dinner on several separate occasions, and each time, my guests are ecstatic. I couldn't get my boyfriend to like it, however- he still hasn't grown to love blue cheese.

The bleu cheese garlic butter is killer, and even better melting slowly over a grilled rib eye! This is a terrific recipe and well worth trying. It has gone in our rotation for special dinners--tonight was for the in-laws!

This is one of my top 5 recipes ever. The gorgonzola butter is exceptional and can be used on almost anything; it is perfect though with the onion rings and steak. I added more garlic and onion powder to my flour mixture and my onion rings turned out exceptional as well. Single folk, make this for the special someone you are wooing, I promise they will be with you, if only so you can cook this for them again and again :) Its that good!

Used Bleu Cheese because it's what I had on hand. This made for the best steak butter I've ever had. Not only was it tasty but gave the steak another layer of flavors. I froze what we had left over and used them again on steaks a few days later without any problems. I also used them on wings! I tossed the wings with the butter and added a few dashes of Frank's. Made for the best wings ever. Will make this time and time again.

i just have to say... i made an account just to rate this recipe. it is amazing. ty for this recipe.

Yes. This sauce is bloody insane. But it's better if you just chuck the gorgonzola straight over the rib-eye or shave it on top. Keeps the flavours sharp and without the fuss. We tried it with a Neal's Yard Stilton instead - that was insane, with a Bordeaux.

I have been cooking this on a monthly basis ever since this issue came out in 04! I love it! Now when Im stocking up on basics at the grocery store i always get gorgonzola for spur of the moment cravings. This butter is best on a well marbled ribeye but also works well on filets and strips.

I have made this twice and both times very impressed! The butter is without a doubt incredible!! Do not leave out a thing and you will not be disappointed. It makes the dish. Try it!

Made this for our family for Valentines Day. Did the butter, steaks and rings. Husband melted as fast as the butter on the steaks. Rings were a bit of trouble (deep frying always is) but worth it. . . and were a universal hit with kids and adults. Used Montreal Steak on rib-eyes. Compound butter was best of the meal, though, and I plan to keep some on hand for any and every possible meal/snack.

The gorgonzola butter is truly beyond compare. I used Nature's Seasons on the steak instead of just salt and pepper, which I think improved the flavor because it added a bit more than salt and pepper alone would have.

I didn't make the onion rings, but the butter is out of this world!! I have had requests over and over to make it again...a big hit!

I'm so surprised not to have loved this dish, but it was just lacking in taste. . .Although I used filet mignon instead of rib eye (which may be the culprit) and didn't make the onions. The flavor just wasn't what I expected. My guests enjoyed it, but I was disappointed.

Loved it. The butter was a great touch and I have plenty left over. I never made onion rings before and boy were they a fresh dinner item for us. I made the rings a bit too soon, though. Didn't realize how quick they are to cook, so they ended up overcooking a bit in the oven while I finished things up. Still great, though.

I didn't like the onion rings much and it seemed like way too much work for the end result. You're better off getting some bag o frozen onion rings and tossing them in the fryer instead of using this method. Either that or get some from the local fast food joint. The gorgonzola butter was AWESOME, but needs to be nice n soft or melted after you take the refrigerated log out. One can pair this butter with just about anything like meats, crackers, breads, etc. It was the only thing I liked about this recipe.

This was great. Agreeing with other reviewers, the gorgonzola butter is the star of this meal. if you like garlic, you will love this. i would probably add a little more gorg next time, but thats just a personal preference. the sweet onion rings are a great accompaniment to the steak/butter, but if you prefer dunking and sauces with rings, you might think about whipping up a remoulade or using a blue cheese dip. overall, great meal, will make again soon.

i had something similar at the cowboy club in sedona a week before this mag came out, so when this mag showed up with the steak on the cover my husband HAD to make it. the gorgonzola butter turned out so good that he makes it all the time, even for hamburgers.

I am only really reviewing the gorgonazola butter as I paired it with the Rib Eye Steaks with Bell Peppers. Thought this gorgonzole butter might be more interesting and it was fabulous!!!!!! Such an easy and simple dinner and yet interesting enough for company. I will definately make it again.

The butter was good, but the onion rings were nothing special.

This is another one of my favorites. The gorgonzola butter takes an already great cut of meat to the extreme. I never use it all, so I save it in the freezer for other uses - it's great with lamb. The onion rings are to die for. I soak them for several hours. I also add a little toasted ground cumin to mine. This is a very rich dinner, definately not for everyday, but oh, what a treat! Open a big juicy cab and a simple tossed salad with balsamic vinegarette and feast away!

The gorgonzola butter is excellent. Steak is good on its own but with this butter, it's divine. Very, very good!

I can't rate the steak or gorgonzola butter. Didn't make them. But these are the best onion rings I have ever tasted! I made them when I thought I was in a pinch (my old standby onion ring recipe requires an overnight soaking)but turns out I have a new standby. Wow! The spice in the coating just does wonders....

I made this dish complete with the onion rings for my extended family while on vacation. I can't tell you how much everyone enjoyed the flavor of the gargonzola butter. Hey, I just got an idea, I think I will try this butter in my Thanksgiving mashed potatoes.

I didn't make the onion rings, but after reading the other reviews, I will! The butter is deeeeeeeeeeeelish and was fantastic on the steaks. I used the leftover butter and steak to make sandwiches and they were great! I made this for my husband and I, but next time I will certainly make it for company...it's too easy and too good!

After not having eaten red meat for 15 years, I tried this recipe and the first few bites were heaven--an hour later it was a gastrointestinal disaster. but that's my problem, of course! thing is, the butter is soooo good and it's sitting in my freezer b/c I can't think of anything else to put it on. Help!

Fantastic great all in one meal. Just add a fresh tossed salad and a loaf of fresh bread to finish it out. The butter goes great on more than just steaks so make extra and stash some in the freezer. Get some to grill the steaks while you make the onion rings otherwise it can be a bit of a tricky timing issue.
