Good. A bit too sweet but the non-sweet berry mixture helped temper this and crème fraîche would have if I'd used it (served with vanilla ice cream instead). Used orange extract instead of Grand Marnier, following directions on package for substitution (1 tsp extract per 1 Tbsp orange liqueur required). Cooked in silicone Bundt pan 45 min, could have benefited from a lower temp & few mins more - it was slightly underdone on interior but nicely browned on top/outside. Multiple inversions led to rack marks on the cake, flipping between plates might do better but the cake might stick to them. Next time I will apply syrup in baking pan, transfer to serving plate and apply syrup to the other side, then chill and serve from there (my Bundt pan has a pretty bottom so cake looks nice either way up). Start to finish this took me 1 hr 30 minutes (not counting cooling time after applying the syrup). The syrup and berries are nice additions but the cake is also delicious without them.

Three forks only because I didn't make the glaze. The cake is fabulous. I layered it with pastry cream and my hustand was in heaven. Love this cake.

This cake is a winner - flavorful, moist and has a beautiful texture. I made it with an orange icing topping and it went down a treat with my colleagues when I brought it in for tea.

Great Cake - light texture, very flavorful. It is labor intensive but the perfect crumb achieved through the right mixing and whipped egg whites is absolutely worth the work. I did not have orange flavored liquor so used white rum instead - worked perfectly. Did not do the berry topping. Instead, i split the cake in two layers and filled it with orange marmalade and yogurt filling - it was delicious. The filling: heat 1 cup orange marmalade (sweet for milder or bitter for more intense taste) in a small sauce pan until melted. You can strain it if you smoother texture, but there's no need for this cake, really. Turn the heat off and thoroughly mix in 1/2 cup vanilla yogurt (lowfat or full fat - both work). mix until the mixture is uniform and smooth. Add a tablespoon of rum or orange liquor. Spread the filling generously on the bottom half of the cake. It will seem like a lot, but it really absorbs in the cake. Top with the top layer and sprinkle some powdered sugar on top. Will keep well covered in the fridge for a couple of days.

I have made this twice now for summer dinner parties and it is really special--in taste and in presentation. I love serving it with a dab of greek yogurt. It's in my "keeper" file.

I made this as a bbq party dessert and the guests would not stop raving about it. It was a great alternative to the "usual" chocolate dessert cake. I did not have double-acting baking powder (used regular baking powder), poppy seeds, berries or Triple Sec (used Chambord) and I served it with vanilla ice cream instead of crème fraîche. Still, it turned out absolutely delicious. If you omit the berries, you can cut the syrup portion in half. As for the number of bowls, I used three bowls plus a large measuring cup for the dry ingredients.

This cake is fantastic! It is full of flavor, light and fluffy! I cut the cake in half and filled it with apricot preserves, then topped it with a creme fraiche mousse.

This cake is devine. I made it last summer and my family is still talking about it. I will have to make this again soon!

The cream of tartar isn't quite necessary. And as for the syrup, use more orange juice instead of the liquor. As well, the cake tastes better without the powdered sugar. It goes great with yogurt!

This cake was great!It was time consuming but well worth it. I had a problem making the creme fraische, it never really thickened. I did let it sit for 12 hours but maybe it needed a longer time. Thanks for a great new cake recipe for me.

I love this cake! I cut the layer in half and put the berries in as filling. I then frost it with orange cream cheese frosting and decorate with fresh berries. I've made it several times and it never fails to impress.

This recipe took 6 different pans and bowls by the time it was finished, not counting the cake pan. It was very tasty, but nothing I couldn't have made from a much easier recipe (or even a cake mix!) and adding the syrup. Nothing special for all that work.

I think that this cake is fabulous. I made several since it was published in 1992, it is always a huge success with my guests. It is elegant enough to serve it as I did at a small gathering for a pre-wedding dinner or unpretentious with good friends at a summer BBQ by the pool.

While the cake was fairly easy to make(first time cake baker) and very delicious - I felt the sauce was overbearingly orangy and smothered the taste of the cake. The sauce plays an essential part in flavoring the cake and making it extra moist but can be left out as a topping. I will definitely make again with variations for my family's tastes.

Made this recipe (in Australia - so some of our ingredients are a little different) for a birthday dinner and it received rave reviews - "the best poppy seed cake ever". I actually piled the berries on top of the cake and then dusted it with icing sugar to make it a very spectacular cake. It's well worth a try! Enjoy!

I don't bake, but my wife does. Every time we serve this dish it comes out perfect and get rave reviews. How is it that people think we're brilliant just because we copy a Gourmet Recipe. I don't get it
