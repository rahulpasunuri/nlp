This was surprisingly delicious. I used half the pasta, a little extra zucchini, and fresh parsley. Also, I added a pat of butter to the oil and water at the end, and I think it makes a big difference - the overall texture is creamier.

Perfect dish for a snowy day (like today - here in DC)! We've loved this for several years now. I do, however, like to add extra zucchini to up the veggie content and if you don't have fresh basil, dry works pretty well too.

I also used Romano cheese instead of Parmesan and added dried basil.

This is a very simple recipe, so do not expect anything elaborate. However, it is good for extra zucchini and potatoes. I added onion and garlic to the boiling water, and I used whole wheat rotelle. I also added lemon juice, halved cherry tomatoes and less olive oil than was called for. Next time I would add the zucchini later so that it does not get too soft.

I roasted the potatoes first for about 30 minutes, and then added the zucchini for another 20 minutes. Both were tossed with a bit of olive oil and sea salt. Roasting really brought out the flavors of the potatoes and zucchini, which I think probably made it more flavorful than the original version. Very simple but very delicious!

I absolutely love this recipe: the ease of prep, the simple ingredients, the taste I make it exactly as it is written (no basil or parsley) but I can seen that it would be easy to modify.I believe it is integral to add the amount of salt as written. Also, since it is so simple, every ingredient should be quality. I also believe the 12 oz of cheese has to be an error--stick with the half cup.

I make this all the time, it is really good and pleases the whole family. In the olive oil I cook a little garlic and pine nuts before combining. I reserve 4 forks for only the most amazing things on the site, but this should get 3.5 forks simply because of the added bonus of ease of preparation. If you use fresh high quality Parm, or a Parm/Regg mix it should have plenty of flavor. I don't bother peeling the potatoes since I use thin skinned fingerling potatoes. You could also sprinkle in a little dried basil, if that's all you have mid-winter.

I really loved this dish on a cold winter night. I added some crushed garlic, onion and diced dry salami to the olive oil in a small skillet and put the mixture on low heat and added it at the end with the pasta water. I think some pancetta or bacon would have been good too.

I honestly was skeptical the first time I made this a few years ago; it sounded pretty bland, but we love to try unusual things and I had a bumper crop of zucchini that year. Surprisingly to me, both my husband and I loved it. I use redskins, usually, and use slightly less pasta and LOTS of fresh basil--plus, I'm never shy with the cheese in any recipe. :) We look forward to it as a summer treat to use the goodies from the garden. The flavor is subtle, but very enjoyable. Absolute summer comfort food.

eh. It didn't taste bad, but it wasn't good. It was just kind of bland. I put in a lot of extra cheese and garlic, and it didn't really help.

Quick and tasty.

This is the worst recipe I have ever made. The sauce is tasty, but the combination is horrid. We picked out the zucchini and ate that, but threw away the rest. If I could give it no forks, I would.

Really tasty! I found that a LOT more cheese was needed, but it was a fast and simple meal that even a hard-core meat eater liked!

This is one of my favorite every-day recipes-- it lends itself to all kinds of variations. We have been making it regularly for years.

I made this a while back and, unfortunately, I thought it was just awful. I really wanted to like it too because it was very easy to make and I love pasta with zucchini. Perhaps I did something wrong?

My husband, who normally only likes traditional pasta sauces, LOVED THIS. It was really easy and very tatsy.

I've been making this recipe since it was first published in Gourmet. This has grown to become one of my favorite quick meals and definitely comfort food. I wouldn't change a thing. The beauty of this recipe is its simplicity.

We really enjoyed this pasta dish; along with a lamb chop, but what a great vegetarian entree. I took the advice of others and cut back on oil, used basil, a small amount of brocolli and a seeded and chopped tomato tossed in last along with a healthy squeeze of fresh lemon. Potatoes and pasta - wonderful comfort food.

The only addition I made was a clove of garlic cut in half and added to the water for extra flavor.I used basil fresh from the garden. Next time I will try it with fresh parsley and maybe onion instead of garlic. We liked this dish very much.

Good starting point. Never tried potatoes and spaghetti together. Will use it as a starting point next time.

I'll be the first to admit that this is a strange sounding dish, but I had extra zucchini and little time so... This dish was delicious and really easy! Following the advice of a previous rater, I cut the olive oil. Next time I will add fresh tomato for color.

Tasty and simple. I used tri-color shells rather than spaghetti and a little less oil than the recipe called for. Broccoli might be a nice addition.

A little bland, but does well as "comfort food". I would use a little less olive oil and a little more Parmesan if I make it again.

So simple yet so tasty! Great dish for quick weeknight meal. Plus, appeals to my Irish heritage!

This was a terrific dish--my only mistake was that I used shredded cheese rather than grated. The grated would have given it more taste but it was wonderful. Would make a very good summer dish.
