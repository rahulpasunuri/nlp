This is so good, definitely deserves 4 forks! We love lamb and by far this is one of the best ways to prepare it. Broiling it works wonderfully if you don't have a grill, but grilling is amazing! My husband's favorite!

I found them simple to prepare and quite delicious. The leftovers were great the next day.

This was a nice recipe. I followed the directions and marinated the chops for several hours. I used a grill pan to grill the chops about 4 minutes per side for medium rare. They turned out lovely. I recommend this recipe to all.

Not the most spectacular lamb recipe, but it is nice and easy to prepare. We marinated for about four hours. Don't have a grill, so we basted the meat before putting it under a preheated broiler, broiled 2.5 minutes, basted, broiled 2.5 minutes, basted, flipped them over, basted, broiled 2.5 minutes, basted, and broiled a final 2.5 minutes. Came out a perfect medium rare. The flavour from the marinade was pretty subtle.

Really simple but, a great recipe. Don't over cook lamb! Oil your rack and use a high heat.

Outstanding way to grill lamb chops, and very little work as well. We have made this recipe many times and it never disappoints. Also, dried oregano works fine.

This recipe has become a staple in our house, and is adaptable to many meats. It does very well with pork.

I have a hard time doing anything to lamb chops except broiling them because they are so good (and expensive). However, this recipe was amazing! The flavors were so complex and wonderful. Great dish to impress the heck out of your guests!

I made these for a Greek-themed dinner party and got rave reviews. I also cut up a frenched rack, but we did grill them, and they were absolutely tender and delicious. Even those who don't usually eat lamb ate them.

YUM! I didn't have loin chops so I cut up a frenched rack and marinated that. Of course the cooking time was halved and I broke out my two 10" cast iron skillets to sear and brown the chops. I also added thickly sliced red onions to the marinade and seared them too. I didn't add the honey to the marinade since I wasn't basting the chops on the grill, but drizzled on the chops as I put them in the skillet. Served it with garlic mashed potatoes, the griddled red onion, and the luscious chops. Rave reviews from all!

This was one of the best Lamb dishes I have ever tasted. I cooked it exactly as directed on this recipe.

VERY VERY GOOD. I have made this recipe several times even though I'm not a big lamb fan. I make as the recipe is written, no substitutions. I'm making again tomorrow night for guests. Try it, you'll like it.

Excellent dish! I had to substitute balsamic vinegar for the red wine, and dried oregano for the fresh, but it still came out wonderfully. I marinated overnight and cooked it on my Calphalon grill pan on the stovetop. Worked perfectly - the chops were tender, juicy and flavorful, and the addition of the honey made a gorgeous caramely brown coating. I served it with a mixture of purple potatoes and cauliflower roasted in the oven with garlic.

This was very nice, easy to make, and I had all the ingredients on hand, tons of oregano from my garden right now, so I was glad to use it! I agree it's subtle, and the lamb taste comes right through. I marinated it for about 12 hours. A keeper.

Truly wonderful.Followed exactly as written, as I had all the ingredients. Best lamb chop recipe I've ever used, and I've gotten some really good ones from this site. Marinated for 11 hours. Accompanied with the same wine that was used in the marinade. A keeper.

This was fabulous. I marinated the chops for about 8 hours. It was extremely tender, and the flavor wonderful. You can still taste the lamb, but subtle. I will definitely make it aqain.

My husband and I didn't enjoy this dish and wouldn't make it again. We usually like strong flavors, so I marinated it overnight as recommended by others here. There was a strange flavor to the meat (imparted by the uncooked wine I believe) and the oregano was way too strong.

This was incredible. My first time with lamb was a breeze. I marinated over night and the flavor was intense and complimentary to the asparagus I served it with. The only variation I made was to grill the chops on a higher flame. They cooked quite quickly and were delicious. My left overs soon left the tupperware and ended up as my roommates 2nd dinner, she couldn't deny them once she detected the aroma.

Megaloprepis! Marinating overnight imparts a rich flavor while the acids in the wine serve to tenderize the lamb. The sugars in the honey carmelize quickly in the heat of the grill, adding to the complexity of the flavors.

I can't imagine lamb chops tasting better. I either marinate them overnight or start marinating very early in the morning. Also based frequently while grilling...this tips may make a difference.

A very nice dish. I always marinate the chops overnight, which probably explains why we find it so tasty.

This marinade smells fantastic - I marinated the chops for 4 hours and one could clearly taste oregano, but otherwise I was a bit disapointed in the taste considering how great it smelled! I broiled them instead of grilling and that worked fine. Overall, a nice recipe and good to eat, but not something that I'll make a regular dish.

Worth a try once but didn't catch my palate enough to try again.

This was a good, easy recipe. I only marinated the lamb for about 1 hour but even so did not get a strong taste from the glaze. I'm not sure what the honey added.

Very nice dish -- chops browned beautifully!

This excellent dish is easy to prepare. Once you have the lamb in the marinade, the meal comes together quickly the next day. I have served this to guests on several occasions and I always get wonderful compliments.

Excellent recipe! Have made this dish four times with pleasing results. Easy preparation too. Recommend boneless sirloin chops.
