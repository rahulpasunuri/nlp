I had previously reviewed this recipe in November and I didn't really like the bitter/sour taste, although my husband really enjoyed it. I spoke to a friend who has had thai cooking classes and she said the sour taste comes from the tamarind paste. So, I made it again in January,and cut back on the tamarind and it was much more to my liking. The complexity of the rest of the flavors is outstanding. I made it again this weekend to use up some kabocha that I bought at the farmer's market and it is really, really flavorful. I still cut back just a tad on the tamarind paste, although next time I may use it all since I'm developing a taste for it.

Excellent! Made with lime juice/zest to substitute the kaffir lime leaves.

I used jarred kaffir lime leaves - I think that's what made it too sour for me. It wasn't the creamy Thai curry I'm familiar with. I'll try again with fresh kaffir lime leaves if and when I get my hands on some.

I wasn't crazy about this dish and I agree with the prior reviewer that it was sour; almost bitter. I think it was the tamarind paste that did it. I have never cooked with tamarind before (found it at Whole Foods), and a little dab on my fingertip was very sour. Before I put the tamarind in, the curry tasted like a regular coconut curry sauce. I thought adding the tamarind would add some depth, but the sour taste overwhelmed the dish. I agree that Kabocha is hard to cut, but I love the flavor, so I decided it was worth the effort for this dish since it looked so beautiful on the cover. I take a cleaver and cut into the side and then whack the cleaver with a hammer. The squash pops open (usually with a bit of jagged edge). I had a large squash so I cut it into eighths and placed in pot as recommended, but then I took it out after the first 15 minutes of cooking and easily cut the rind off because I don't like eating it. The Thai curry paste that accompanied this dish is wonderful and I will be making that again, but I'll stick with my usual coconut curry sauce next time.

I must admit that I haven't made this recipe yet but I want to make sure that it is understood that the inclusion of fish sauce makes this dish NON VEGETARIAN. When I make this dish I will omit this ingredient but to advertise the dish as vegetarian is misleading. Sure one could argue that to omit fish sauce isn't authentic but including it isn't vegetarian.

Followed the recipe exactly for an autumn dinner party and it was phenomenal. Some slight problems, however: kaffir leaves are extremely hard to find. I had to order them online but it was completely worth it (I used import food.com -- 2 day delivery and the total cost was $20 with more than enough leaves to freeze). The curry paste is equally wonderful, but both dishes are pretty labor intensive. Also, kabocha squash is hard to cut and its skin is somewhat thick. Acorn squash works just as well and is easier to handle with thinner skin. An absolutely scrumptious, bold dish for anyone who loves thai curries. It was a complete hit at the dinner party and I would absolutely make this again.

The flavor of this dish is lovely. That said, I would make some changes next time. I simmered the squash for 15 min., which was too long - it dissolved in the stock. Perhaps my wedges were too small, but hard to know. The direction, "remove squash, return squash, transfer squash", is too fussy for me. Next time I'll simply remove the squash when it's done, replacing it after the tamarind concentrate etc., and just before serving.
