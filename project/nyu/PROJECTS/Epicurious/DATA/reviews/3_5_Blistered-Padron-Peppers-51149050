Excellent to serve with drinks. I've only used shishito peppers, substituting sesame oil for the olive oil and finishing with a bit of the Japanese spice togarashi. These delicious peppers can sometimes be quite spicy, so you might want to warn your guests.

Fabulous. Serve w/ brie & crostini on to help cut some of the heat. Used a very hot, large cast iron skillet. They splatter pretty wickedly, so beware. Use a lot of salt -- and a small squeeze of lemon is great, too.
