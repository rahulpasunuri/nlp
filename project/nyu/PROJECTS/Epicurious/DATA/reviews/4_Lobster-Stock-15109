Fantastic stock. I used canned, fire roasted tomatoes instead of paste, added some shallots and swapped 1/4 cup mirin for the white wine. I also used some store bought seafood stock and some clam juice to replace half the water. After straining, I added a dashes of black and white pepper, salt and a sprig of fresh thyme and let it reduce for another 25 minutes. The result is a beautiful, rich, sweet base that's good enough to eat on its own.

Great flavor and useful in different Thai soups or seafood stews. It's practically criminal to throw out a lobster carcass - mine go from lobster stock right into the compost pile. Freezes well too.

As one reader already suggested, a couple of chopped fresh tomatoes are better than tomato paste. I also substituted a large leek (white and pale green parts only) for the onion. This is great to make the day after serving whole lobsters in the shell. Many people (not I) discard the bodies and eat only the claws and tail, leaving lots of lobster to flavour your stock.

I use this stock to make Gourmet Shellfish Stew Provencale, a traditional B'day dinner for a few in my family. It is an excellent stock and freezes very well. A good strong lobster taste.

Great recipe! Good lobster flavor and easy to make. Made my own pasta sauce and used this stock instead of water or chicken stock. Added a few small clams--what a dish!

Easy,easy recipe to make!! Is very forgiving! I had shells from 3 2lb lobsters - added a little more of some ingred. and used the cooking broth in place of water. Threw in some leftover lobster meat and served witha touch of cream. The men loved it!!!!!

Great stock. On my second attempt, I added some whole black pepper, three medium size fresh Jalapenos and substituted the tomato paste with two extremely ripe tomatoes - an improvement according to my guests.

Made the stock - is delicious. Can't wait to try it in a recipe (either a bisque or pasta sauce)!
