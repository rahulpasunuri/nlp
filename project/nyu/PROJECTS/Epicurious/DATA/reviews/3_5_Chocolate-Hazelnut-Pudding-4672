Good texture and fairly easy preparation. As did the previous reviewer, I found that the pudding needed more than five minutes to come to a boil. Also, I thought the texture was a bit soupy.

Yum. Used Scharfenberger bittersweet chocolate, skipped the whipped cream and ladyfingers and didn't miss either. Dessert was rich and satisfying. I also stirred constantly and found that it took longer than 5 minutes for the pudding to come to a boil. Thought my husband was going to lick the bowl clean to get every last drop.

Took the tip from SF cook and stirred constantly. I'm glad I've been working out. Used Scharffen Berger chocolate and served to my cooking club to good reviews (I quadrupled the recipe). Serving tip for large quantities - I put the whole pudding in a punch bowl and spooned and garnished into littler serving dishes just before the fact - much easier than having many little breakable dishes taking up fridge space.

I made this for an Italian dinner and what a hit! I couldn't find lady fingers and didn't think the pudding needed it. I used a very fine, semi sweet chocolate.

I haven't made this recipe (I'm about to give it a try) but as a veteran pudding-maker, I suggest constant stirring to make sure it comes out perfectly smooth and creamy..

Delicious! I left out the hazelnuts and used Amaretto liquer and it was terrific. Nice chocolate flavor. I thought the texture could be a little smoother, but that won't stop me from making this again.

Great dinner party dessert--easy and you can make it ahead. I garnished with the whipped cream and some strawberries. I don't think the lady fingers are necessary b/c the hazelnuts give it some crunch. I served it with coffee and Amaretto.

We made this dish as the dessert portion of our Italian Gourmet Club dinner. Even after a very big dinner, a small portion of this dessert was perfect. It was sublime! It was dense, smooth, and we licked the bowls clean (well, almost!)
