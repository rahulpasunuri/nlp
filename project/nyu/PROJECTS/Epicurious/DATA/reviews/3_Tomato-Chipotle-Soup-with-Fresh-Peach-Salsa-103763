OK.....this is a salsa in my opinion.....I love..love tomatos...but this one does not do it for me unless served as a salsa....my first disappointment....so sorry....but a decent and different salsa!!!!

Very nice twist on cold tomato soup. I liked the peach salsa a lot, but just popped the soup ingredients into the blender and pureed them. Add a pinch of salt and sugar to the soup.

Very nice summer soup. The chipotles give it a nice smoky hot flavor. I might substitute mango for the peach next time, or even leave out the salsa--it was sort of distracting for me.
