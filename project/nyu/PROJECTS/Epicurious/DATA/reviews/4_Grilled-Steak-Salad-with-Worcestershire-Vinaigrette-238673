If allowed I would give this 3.5*'s. I really liked the combination of the grilled onions, steak and dressing. The dressing sounded a little weird to me when I first looked at this. I am glad my initial skepticism was overcome. Though simple, the fresh thyme pulls this together. Thyme is the best herb with steak in my experience. The 1/4 tspn of salt seems superfluous since Worcestershire has enough salt. My only slight change was to put a little charmoula on the steak when I let them rest after cooking. Sliced the steak very thin and enjoyed a fantastic meal. This would also make a great appetizer for probably 10-12 people. I used a blade steak with worked equally well. I think flank, top sirloin, and round steak would all work fine.

The onion/arugula salad part is quite nice. I could'nt figure out if the meat was on the side, or cut up into the salad. Serve the meat on the side and marinate/season it your usual way, because it did'nt have any flavor using this dressing. (do'nt know what went wrong here) Also, if you do do it this way, the salad needs something else, maybe feta? to make it noteworthy. Dressing in the sauteed onions is quite good however.

The sum is greater than the parts--I loved this salad and was surprised it was so good. I didn't have fresh thyme and had to use dried; I pan-grilled the onions until they were burnt--crunchy, bitter and sweet. And I added croutons, a little reggiano parmesan and a spoon of fresh goat cheese. I think it would have been just about as good without my additions, and certainly better with fresh thyme. It's the perfect steak salad. I'll make this often.

We substituted the arugula for orzo and grilled veg: asparagus, zucchini and red onion. Topped with grape tomatoes for color. Remained in keeping with the idea of a light and refreshing summer dinner, just a bit more filling. Overall it was absolutely amazing.

Perfect for al fresco dining. Doubled and served 10 for a buffet dinner. Took advise from another reviewer and served with a platter of sliced tomatoes (three different types). Rave reviews from all.

This was an amazing recioe. Quick but looked like you spent alot of time. I made a rub of thyme, chopped garlic with the kosher salt and olive oil and let it marry with the beef before grilling. I used flank steak instead of skirt. Served with sliced tomatoes with feta cheese and black olives. The presentation was colorful and delicious. A great spur of the moment dinner for friends.

This was very easy to make and extremely tasty. Just make sure not to overcook the steak. The vinaigrette is excellent.

This is really good and really simple. I use a red onion and a Vidalia - mostly because I like grilled Vidalias. It must be good - we'd only had this issue of Gourmet for 2 weeks and had already destroyed the page this recipe was on with worcestershire sauce.

This was so quick and yet elegant and delicious. My husband wants to know how soon we can have it again. It's the perfect summer entertaining meal - quick, easy and presents beautifully, so you look like you made quite an effort, without actually having to! There is plenty of dressing, so I'll use it on something else later in the week.
