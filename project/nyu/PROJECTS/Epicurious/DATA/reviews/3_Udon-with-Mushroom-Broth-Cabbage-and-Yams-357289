While this recipe is a bit time consuming, it's well worth the effort if only for the nutrition that's jam packed into every bowl. Grab your partner or a friend and get them chopping. It's a great cure for a cold or the body blahs.

This is made more simply by using a "dashi": one ounce kombu brought just to a boil in 6 cups of water. Don't let it boil, remove it from the heat, remove kombu and stash in fridge. It keeps 4 or 5 days. When you're ready for soup you can add the tamari and vinegar & shitake right to the broth. Pre-cook the carrots, yams and noodles and whatever else and let people add what they want. Save the green onions and ginger until the very last. There are many variations on this: Miso, instead of tamari and vinegar; mirin and soy. Easy. Tasty. Kids know when something is fresh and clean. They'll like it. There is a way to pickle the kombu. Does anyone know it?

I hadn't read all of the instructions before starting the recipe -- big mistake. No kombu or dried shiitakes in the cupboard. But, the broth with fresh shiitakes turned out great and the soup tastes healthy and is quite satisfying. Not sure how to save all the lefvtovers, but looking forward to dinner tomorrow night!

My kids thought this was great. That's a surprise. If only it wasn't so time consuming. But over all SUPERB!

I made this for my picky children one night. THEY LOVED IT. It is magnificent and very healthy. I tend to like my soup thick, so i added more noodles, DELISH!

I made this at the request of my son and his wife, I was cooking dinner for them, not having dinner with them so I didn't partake of this dish. However, I found it very odd that the recipe calls for Kombu which is simmered for one minute and then discarded. I wonder how much this could possibly add to the flavor of the broth and it seemed wasteful. The kids said it was ok but questioned why there was so much broth in proportion to the solids. It did seem very healthy. Would not choose to make this for myself and doubt the kids will request it again.

Healthy, light, easy (although time consuming) to make. the steps are all easy, but there are many of them. It is well worth it given how great all those colors and flavors look and taste.

Ok so its like 2.5 forks (really good). I wouldn't describe it as labor intensive, as its just some chopping and boiling of things, but it is very methodical. It took me about 45min to an hour to make (exclusive of the broth which I used my chicken stock because all vegetables are better when bathed in a little chicken stock), and the resulting dish is beautiful.

This was waaaay too much work for the result. Tracking down all of the ingredients was difficult and quite expensive. I only have one large pot so that made things still more interesting. I understand the whole japanese "sushi mindset" idea of serving food simple and as raw as possible, but soup and crunchy half-raw veggies don't mix on my palette.

All I can say is WOW, delicious! I usually fail at any type of Asian cuisine, but this was incredibly straight forward. This recipe is easily adaptable to any season, swapping out different veggies. Keeping the garnishes separate from the broth really adds a lot to the taste. Everything retains its own flavors and textures. I can't wait to make this again!

eversince, if you skipped all the veggies didn't you just end up with cabbage, mushroom and scallion? Rikerj I think you are supposed to split the noodles, veggies and broth in 4-6 bowls together not in separate bowls. That said, recipe looks good and I'll be back to rate once I make it!

I love all the ingredients in this soup and somehow, after following the directions to T, I found it lacking. Because all the veggies are cooked separately, it didn't come together the way I had hoped. I must say it is a very great looking soup though.

This one is a handful, especially if you make the lovely vegetable broth as well (worth it, by the way), but great for a winter day when you're staying home out of the cold. Skipped the snow peas, yams and carrots; there were plenty of healthy vegetables without them. Any vegetable you like would work well. Overall, really satisfying and worth the work.

Definitely delicious and definitely intricate to make - even though it doesn't seem it should be. Since each ingredient ends up in a separate bowl before each person serving themselves, make sure you have enough bowls clean. I followed the recipe exactly and the product was soooo good.

While a good soup, will probably not make this again. Too much work for the result.

This was a good soup, but I didn't think the mushroom broth added much flavor. Next time I would just make a a basic, easy miso broth and add the vegetables called for in the recipe (including parsnip), as well as ginger, cilantro, and a dash of lemon juice and then season with a dash of hot sauce (I used Srirachia). I thought the sweetness of the yams and parsnip balanced the heat of the soup well. All in all, a good soup, but not a great soup, and too labor-intensive for the results.
