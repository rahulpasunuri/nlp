Easy and always receives rave reviews. I've used both Callebaut and Lindt.

Super easy to make! I reduced the alcohol in half because I don't care for the taste - and half was perfect -it still enhanced the flavor without leaving a distinctive alcoholic taste.

Fabulous, and very easy, even for a first-time truffle maker such as myself. I used plain old Nestle's white chocolate chips and substituted Kaluha coffee liquor for the rum - took these to a party and everyone loved them. However, even though I made them small I yielded only about 35 fairly truffles, so adjust accordingly. I'll definitely make these again!

Wonderful recipe! I make this every year for the holidays -- it remains a HUGE hit! Be sure to use good quality chocolate, as others have noted.

I used Valrhona's White chocolate with Myer's Dark Rum for its full flavor. It turns out to be a big hit! The truffles are smooth and wonderfully rich in flavor. I also coursely chopped the nuts to enhance the special texture of macademia on the bite. Be careful not to over-roast the macademia (as macademia nuts has a higher fat percentage, it's easy to over-toast them). A slight toast will do. If you are using microwave, chop the chocolate to 0.5 inch squares or smaller, put it on 40% power for 1.5 - 2.0 minutes. Make sure the chocolate doesn't completely melt in the microwave (that means you are burning the chocolate and its taste). One thing, next time I will skip the coconut. The truffles look as professional as they are without coconut, and in my opinion, better in taste without it.

This is scrumptious. To my neighbour in West Vancouver, the macadamia taste is very identifiable but you must use a very good quality white chocolate since Baker's is too sweet and hard - try Calebaut. This will solve your problem of oversweetness and also the hardness you encountered. There is more cocoa butter in a good quality chocolate and you should get a nice smooth ganache. Don't microwave the chocolate - it ruins the texture. Coarsely chop the chocolate and follow the directions in the recipe.

This recipe consistently impresses, even those who flinch at the thought of "white" chocolate. For a holiday party, I made this recipe as well as one that took three times as long to make (with three times the ingredients and cost!) This one hands down. In my care, this recipe makes 32-48 truffles, not 64.

I made these using hazelnuts toasted in the oven with a light sprinkling of salt. They were fabulous! The flavor of the nuts really came through. Once the mixture was chilled, I turned it out onto a large pastry board and cut them into little squares before rolling them. They are sweet and rich, but addictive!

At first I thought Vancouver was being a bit churlish, complaining about the directions, but after making it I must agree, the procedure is a bit fussy. Try chopping the white chocolate in big chunks and microwaving it, as well as using a melon baller to create the truffles. The taste is great, though. Try keeping some larger chunks of macadamia nut if you think the flavor is getting lost.

A delightful and easy additon to a pastry tray. I used real white chocolate instead of Lindt and didn't find it too sweet as one reader suggested. . Lightly toasting the macadamia nuts also intensifies the flavor. Will make them again.

Tried this with bittersweet chocolate - much richer (prettier, too). I had the macadamias on hand, but I think any nut would do just as well and not be quite as expensive.

Too sweet and too expensive - if the final result was outstanding, then the cost would be justified. However, you could hardly taste the macadamia nuts and would have to be doubled to taste them. Not rich enough, just cloying sweetness. And the instructions are cumbersome - you don't have to "finely grind" the chocolate b/c it gets melted anyway! And, once you chill the "ganache" it's impossible to roll into balls, so I had to warm it up to soften it enough to work with it!

These truffles are very easy and delicious. I gave them as gifts to several people and everyone who tried them wanted the recipe.
