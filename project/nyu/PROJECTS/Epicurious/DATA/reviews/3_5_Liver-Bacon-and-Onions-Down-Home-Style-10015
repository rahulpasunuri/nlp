I don't know - what you guys were thinking but this dish is awful....liver is not meant to be mixed with barbeque sauce - because essentially that's what you end up with here....this is the most god awful dish I have ever made from this site....my advice = "don't do it"

This was good, cheap and easy, but it did not taste like the way my mom made it. I guess I need to experiment more? In any case, it's close enough, and I like it enough to make it again.

Yum!!!! I would say "just like mum made" but it was even better!!(sorry mum!) I added a dash of worchestershire sauce to the ketchup and after making the gravy i put all ingredients in the pan for a few minutes...the liver soaked up a lot of the gravy and was very moist. a deffinate keeper

I don't even like liver and I thought this was great!

I agree, this IS the best way to prepare liver and onions ... (As a kid I always hated the dish and would run the other way anytime my mother fixed it.) Now my taste buds have matured and I enjoy rediscovering the "oh yuck!" foods of my youth!

I probably only make this dish once a year, or less. It reminds me of growing up. This is EXACTLY the way Mom made liver and onions and is the ONLY way to do it. If you're not going to saute in the bacon grease, don't bother with the recipe. Olive oil and/or butter just won't do it. In response to the last reviewer, to make a good pan "sauce," you need to have browned the onions and liver real well, don't clean the pan during the whole process, and then scrape up all the bits stuck to the bottom into the sauce and reduce for a few minutes. Serve with buttery mashed potatoes.

The sauce is too weak, lacks substance. I would subsitute a medium thick gravy and complement the dish with mashed potatoes and garden peas.
