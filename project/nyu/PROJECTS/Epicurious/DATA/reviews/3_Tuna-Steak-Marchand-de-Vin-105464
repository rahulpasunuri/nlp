My family declared this the best fish dish theyve ever eaten. I used fresh Yellow Fin Tuna (who was swimming merrily in the Gulf of Mexico yesterday), an Australian Merlot and, for my herbs, thyme, dill and marjoram. Found the sauce to be a bit thin so I enriched with butter as Mamma Julia taught me and salted to taste. Served with roasted new potatoes, and lemon-roasted green beans with Marcona almonds from Ep.com. Divine!

A bit sour so I added some brown sugar and it turned out great. It could have been my choice of wine though, I used some Pinto Noir.

Stop bickering, all of you. It's disgusting.

My family loved it. I added a chopped sweet red pepper & hot red pepper. After cooking down the wine I discoved it was really hot, so I added sour cream to cut down the heat. It was superb.

I made this exactly as printed, using fresh herbs. While the result was good enough to try again, I felt both the sauce and beans needed a little more flavor. I'll try the rosemary, lemon juice and hot pepper mentioned by the previous poster.

This was really delicious. Whenever I read reviews of a recipe that has been completely changed from the original, I always wonder, why bother posting? It's not the same recipe anymore, but, in this instance I made quite a few changes that I think really added to this to make it noteworthy. 1st the beans. I did use canned. I sauteed onions and garlic, along with some chopped fresh rosemary and about a 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes. At the end of cooking I added about 1/2 of a roasted red pepper chopped, the juice of 1/2 a lemon, salt and pepper. The finished result was amazing. SO GOOD!!! When I cooked the tuna I coated each side with salt and coarse freshly ground black pepper and seared for about 2 minutes on 1 side and about 45 seconds on the other. (it was frozen tuna that we had caught over the summer.) I didn't have shallots on hand so I used about 1/2 a small onion and a large clove of garlic instead. I sauteed those and then deglazed the pan with about 1/2 cup of wine instead of the full cup the recipe calls for. I reduced for a minute or 2 and poured what was left over the fish. ( I also added chopped fresh rosemary to the sauteeing onions and garlic. I forgot that part above) The result was absolute heaven. When I read the reviews of this recipe I was ready to disregard it ,but, I'm so glad I didn't. With a little help it was one of the best meals I ever made.

I only made the tuna and wine sauce, I did not make the beans. The wine sauce was unexciting. I followed the recipe exactly and used fresh herbs from my garden, but I definitely won't be making this one again.

This was OK, I used frozen tuna. Probably fresh tuna would be better. I used the canned beans, and it was very nice. Oh, also frozen herbs, probably it would be better with fresh

I, like Anne Willan, resorted to canned cannellini beans, and they were delicious. They would make a great side dish to any number of entrees...horse meat would not be one of them, though. I think a sushi grade tuna steak seared to rare, and not much more, is an ideal choice. This is an excellant "have it again" dish.

I Think That This Recipe Really Should Use A White Fish, As Opposed To Tuna. Something Like Black Bass Or Monkfish.I Also Pureed The Beans Which Works Well.Try The Sauce With Loin Of Horse Meat.
