It's not easy to get one's hands on Meyer lemons in Northern KY, so when I saw them I seized the opportunity to make this decadent dessert. It is over-the-top delicious. The bits of lemon rind set it apart from other lemony desserts. Next time I won't bother with the creme fraiche; I thought the cake was better without it.

What a well-balanced dessert! Not too sour nor sweet, but light and quite flavorful! I made it exactly as written, but omitted the crème fraîche and topped it with raspberries and blueberries. I will make this again since it's easy to prepare and makes a lovely presentation.

We have a Meyer Lemon Tree that is bursting with frusit. Every year I try and find reciepes that where I can use the lemons. THis one is perfect. It is light after a heavy meal, it looks professional and tastes wonderful. It is actually fairly simple to make too. The creme fraiche is a nice touch, but I know in some parts of the world it is hard to find. If you cannot find it, it is rich enough without it.

I liked this recipe, but I gave it 3 forks because I have another recipe for "Lemon Pudding Cake" that is on the food network's site. That recipe uses regular lemons, not Meyer lemons, but it is so similar and beats this one out by a nose. I did follow the recipe exactly accept we decided not to top it with the crème fraîche since it was creamy enough as is. So, we topped it with some fresh berries and everybody enjoyed the desert a great deal.

This is a nice dessert when you want something light and different. Add a few fresh berries, I used blackberries, to the plate for a nice color contrast and a new burst of flavor. I also sprinkled the plate with some additional finely grated Meyer lemon peel. Can't have too much of that flavor!

Loved it! Didn't and wouldn't change a thing...my teenage son went crazy for it!

I was surprised by how bad this turned out. The flavor was terrible and the texture was . . .unique. I used Meyer lemons, and followed the recipe exactly, and it was a cloyingly sweet sugar bomb. The bad texture is probably attributable to my technique not the recipe, but nevertheless, the best word I have to describe it is gloppy. Do not recommend.

This was fine but nothing special. Felt like i was eating a partially finished dessert. Easy so would maybe do again but for the most part not that exciting.

Lemony deliciousness! Used Meyer lemons only and omitted the extra 2T. sugar with the flour mixture. As much as I love whipped creme fraiche, I felt this lovely dessert did not need any type of accompaniment.

made this for the first time for a get together with friends- a major hit!! This is my favorite Meyer lemon dessert recipe.

I tried this and loved every spoonful. I did not want to add the crème fraîche or whipped cream but I did turn each cake onto a plate dressed with sliced local strawberries. This dish should not be hidden away for winter. It is a beautiful end note and can play a part in meals of any season.

Absolutely the best recipe ever.I double the amount of zest as I love the taste of meyer lemons.Fortunately we are blessed with them in southern California.Do not deviate from anything in the recipe.It is perfect.For the person who has difficulty folding in the meringue, be firm and use a large spatula.I use extra large eggs so that also makes a difference.The tops do NOT brown and that is okay.I have made them and refrigerated them for up to 3 days with no problem.It is my favorite dessert.

I enjoyed the lightness of these cakes, howver, mine did not brown on top-I ewven cooked additional 10 minutes like other reviewers suggested. I used ramekins that were shallow and wil try next time with deeper ramekins to get more pudding texture.

Superb! I made it with passion fruit puree instead of lemon juice. Fantastic bright flavor, very intriguing soufflee-like texture. Served in ramekins. The kids hated it, because it wasn't a donut, the guests shrugged because it wasn't a candybar, but my husband and I who love citrus desserts had a duel over the final cake. Yum, yum, yum.

I accidentally used 1/3 cup flour and put 1/3 cup of sugar in the egg whites. I also used regular lemons because thats all I had. It still came out wonderful. Considering how easy it is to make, the flavor and texture are impressive. I will definitely serve it at parties maybe with berries on the side. One other note: I tried it after 3 hours in the refrigerator and it was great, but the next day after chilling overnight it was even better.

we made this with meyer lemons from our own tree, and it was outstanding! Almost as good warm as it was chilled. even a friend who is not big into citrus-y desserts went for seconds. I'll be making this again just as soon as our next batch of lemons ripens.

These little cakes are delicious and really easy and foolproof. I'll definitely make them again.

Terrific taste, however, custard did separate. It was difficult to fold the egg whites into such a "liquidy" form. Used regular lemons and liked the creme fraiche. Will do again as the separation looks a bit like the photo?

Was GREAT except everyone agreed there was too much zest. Next time I'll reduce it to at most one tablespoon.

wow this was a terrific dessert. And really quite easy. I made it as written except I had to cook it about 10-15 minutes longer to get the tops to brown at all. Lovely smooth rich but light texture. The creme fraiche was perfect along side.

Rating: 4
I made these last minute and feared that only 3 hours in the fridge would not allow these to be their best. I couldn't have imagined them better. I used whipped cream along side, instead of creme fraiche. I think it would be preferable since the cakes are tart and the rich, creamy whipped cream is a nice contrast. I will definitely make it again. Perfect do-ahead dessert for company.

this was such an easy and super fresh and delicious dessert that we were just amazed! i actually made extras and vacuum sealed them right in the ramekins and froze them for later use. i tried one of the frozen ones and it was as delicious as the freshly made ones! EXCELLENT RECIPE!!!!!

This is a simply marvelous dessert. Follow the directions explicitly and you will have a great ending to whatever meal you are cooking regardless of season.

Excellent, light dessert. Have made it twice and served it to guests at dinner parties where it was a hit each time. I plan to make it again this week for dessert for a discussion group we're hosting. Be sure to serve the dollop of creme fraiche. It is a nice contrast of flavors.

This is a great dessert and turns out perfectly whether you use ramekins or a large dish. Recommend it highly!

I used regular lemons for this and the recipe came out great. the cakes are a great souffle texture, it was a bit sweet and acidic but the creme i think balanced that out very well. for the creme i made a simple syrup with 3 tablespoons water, 1/8 cup sugar and chopped up mint leaves. then stepped and strained the liquid with 7oz of heavy whipping cream. whipped that up for a sec and added 7 oz of creme fraiche and kept beating until whipped. I think the two of these whipped together made it a wonderful consistency and not to sweet for the cakes. i also put a couple raspberries on top.

I made this recipe as written except for cooking time I added at least 10 minutes and cooked till the cakes pulled away from the sides of the ramekins. Very delicious. I did make sure to check the acidity of my lemons. The meyer lemons are less acidic and sweeter than reg. lemons.

Mine came out brown on top but it looks like the bottom 3rd is liquid--making the top (or bottom once flipped) cake and the top a sort of syrup. Is the photo on this recipe page actually supposed to be the finished product? I wouldn't put whipped cream on this, it's already super sweet and tangy--as an alternative to creme fraiche I would use a thick greek yogurt to cool it down. even sour cream. as long as there's no more sugar added to this sugar bomb. PS I used regular lemons and 1% milk.

Oh boy! I just logged on to find a recipe in which to use the juice & zest I harvested from a grocery bag of lemons I received from a neighbor! I can hardly wait to try this.

Whoa Baby!! This is as good as water for a thirsty man! The Poker guys went nutz for this dessert as did my family. Easy enough to do and impressive on the table.

This was very good and a nice light dessert. I left them in the ramekins as it seemed like they would not unmold easily. They were not at all cake-like,but more like a souffle/custard. Friends said it was like a lemon merengue pie without the crust. I also used much smaller ramekins and it was a good size as the dessert is rich.

I love meyer lemons and I really liked this dessert. It was not too sweet and very lemony. I used whipped cream instead of creme fraiche and put a few chocolate shavings on top. Not difficult to make either. I am making it for dessert at friends house tomorrow

While the flavor was light and airy ... (I used regular lemons) ... my desserts came out more like a curd than a cake ... not sure why that was (I think you need to add more flour). Something needs to balance the lemon a bit to tone down the acidity ... even something herbal like basil or tarragon.

We were kind of underwhelmed by this. It was fine, but there are such better things to do with these special lemons. Like previous reviewers--the cakes never browned though I added 10+ minutes to the cooking time and whipped cream would be a better accompaniement, in my opinion, than creme fraiche.

This is a great, light desert to follow a heavier meal. I used 2% instead of whole milk. The cakes never did get golden brown on top - and I baked them about 10 minutes longer than suggested! But they still turned out light and delicious, and my guests enjoyed every bite.

I thought it too acidic. My husband thought it too sweet. But our guests said they loved it. Light and lemony.

The perfect dessert, if you like lemons, and we do! This is super easy, delicious, and the presentation is impressive. I used Creme Fraiche as a topping, but will use whipping cream next time as recommended by prior reviewer in B.C. Next time I make it I am going to try fresh raspberries on top.

This was a fantastic dessert for a group of girlfreinds at a January lunch I made today--the recipe is easy to do--best of all 'do-ahead'; I did add one more egg as I find that only 2 do not give enough oomph to the meringue. The texture is sort of souffle--sort of feathery moist cake? pudding?...and the flavor just what we needed after the Xmas heavy spice scene.Refreshing, lemony and a nice hint of tart. I used a dollop of whipped cream instead of the Creme Fraiche--I am not going out in 2 feet of snow hunting down this item! Four stars for sure!
