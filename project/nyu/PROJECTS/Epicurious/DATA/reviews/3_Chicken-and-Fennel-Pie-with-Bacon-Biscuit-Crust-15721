I thought this turned out OK. My husband really liked it, though. I thought it was easy to prepare--no different than most pot pie recipes. The fennel was interesting, but subtle. If I make it again, I don't think I'd include the bacon in the crust--I couldn't really taste it and didn't think it was necessary.

A lot of wirk but well worth the effort.

absolutely to die for! yes, the crust as listed is quite devilish, but i also used milk (2%) and it was phenomenal. i cut the fresh fennel back a bit and did not add seeds...small children in attendance! took forever to prep, but the rich flavor was well worth the effort!

Why in the world do you need almost 6 cups of liquid to boil 2 pieces of chicken and a few vegetables? The bird was dead when you bought it!! Fortunately, I have always bought chicken on sale really cheaply, and made my own rich, delicious, fat-free stock. Then I keep the meat ready-to-use in my freezer, so I was able to skip the entire first process. I simply sauteed the vegetables (including garlic) in butter to tender, added the chicken/seasonings and heated through. From that point, all I had to do was to add flour to the mixture, and enough stock to achieve the consistency I wanted. It was a snap. I used buttermilk in the crust, a simple egg and water eggwash on the pie, and I also baked it in a cast-iron skillet seasoned with bacon drippings. I used a little larger skillet so I could increase the volume of filling, including throwing in some English peas, still in their tender pods. Scrumptious.

This recipe has a fatal flaw that is easily remedied: two cloves of minced garlic should not be added just before baking. They do not cook thoroughly and the sharp garlic flavor takes over the dish. Sautee these with the roux, perhaps, or cook with the veggies. I also recommend sauteeing the fennel and onion before boiling in broth: these vegetables get a waterlogged, low-flavor quality when boiled. But it is a clever recipe and delicious (if a bit greasy--why heavy cream in the biscuit recipe? i used milk, which was fine). Finally, a cast-iron skillet is perfect for baking it in--preferably seasoned from frying the bacon.

I love this recipe and make it at least a few times a month. It is always well recieved, and not at all hard to make. The crust also makes great biscuits if you have any left over.

This is a wonderful recipe. The fennel added a great flavor to the dish. The really tough part of this recipe was finding a 12 inch 10 cup round baking dish to cook it in. I ended up using an existing round roaster I had that was 13 inches across. This worked out fine as I had added extra chicken and used a number of small red and white potatoes I had in the pantry and some rather large carrots. I am amazed that no one had rated this recipe previously. It is easy to prepare and the results are delicious.
