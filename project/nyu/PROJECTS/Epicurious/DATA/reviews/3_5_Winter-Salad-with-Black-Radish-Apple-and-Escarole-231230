I couldn't find black radish so I used turnip instead - still delicious.

Terrific & simple salad for a weeknight dinner. My husband has made it about ten times this winter. It is tart and crisp and goes great with a small vegetable pizza and a glass of wine.

Black Radishes are beautiful but the skin is tough and inedible. While slicing it very thinly is one solution to preserve the beauty and color of the skin, it still makes for the sensation of eating pungent woodchips.
