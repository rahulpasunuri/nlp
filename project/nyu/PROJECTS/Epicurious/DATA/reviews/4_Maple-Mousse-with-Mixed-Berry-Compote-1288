I made this on Christmas Eve when my parents came to visit and served it after an exquisite fish dinner. It was fabulous, very Christmasy and elegant and appreciated.

When I read the reviews for this dessert, I cancelled what I had been planning to serve for New Year's Eve. And I am glad I did. This was wonderful. My guests loved it. Easy, with a sophisticated "gourmet" taste.

Loved it, so did my director of operations. He loved it so much he requested I put it on the New Year's Eve menu and it was a hit. Did it in a chocolate tear drop, which complimented the mousse and berry compote

I made this at the request of a friend, for a group of executives on a retreat. We were on an island with no power but for a generator and a I mixed it with a little milkshake mixer, and it was a hit.

Elegant, fabulous, easy, makeahead dessert. It's perfect for any occasion, any season. Not a strong taste of maple. Some people who tell me they don't like maple, liked this.

elegant, yummy, and fun to make. you can play around with the mix of berries, add liqueurs, serve with shaved candied almonds...

Great! I had to make some berry substitutions but that was no problem.

This dessert is easy to make and really tasty. The maple syrup gives it just the right flavor and sweetness. Really nice alternative to heavier desserts during the cold winter months.
