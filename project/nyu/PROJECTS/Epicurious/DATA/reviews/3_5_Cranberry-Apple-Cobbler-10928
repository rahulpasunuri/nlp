Very good, easy, fast and easily to substitute ingredients. Made once by the book and it was great, but a little tart. Today I was missing several ingredients and made a number of substitutions. I also felt creative and made some additions as follows: Substituted brown sugar for white sugar and molasses; butter with earth's spread, shortening for whipped cream cheese; granny smith apples for Macintosh; orange zest for lemon, and vanilla yogurt for plain greek. I added sugar to the dough and ginger and a touch of cayenne pepper tot he fruit mix. OMG. IT WAS SOOOO GOOD. My husband loved the little kick form the cayenne. Didn't serve with ice cream.

Made this for a potluck. It was easy and quick. Used vanilla yogurt for topping and frozen cranberries. Other than that followed recipe and doubled it. Nice sweet, tart flavor and pretty presentation. Will definitely make again when I need a quick desert.

Ive made this a few times myself and here's a few tips... When your making the first part add the fruit last. mix the sugar and spices and flour and zest( yes you should DEF use it) together well then toss it with the fruit. *You can freeze cranberries when they are in season to use later. I have also tried it using frozen cherries and it turned out great. *The biscuit part doesn't NEED vanilla yogurt, it's just a taste preference. the biscuits are great the way they are. the contrast of the creamy biscuits and the sweet filling is perfect. A good cook can get this out on the table in 45 minutes. It's very easy to do and you don't need any special equipment to hurry it along. It's very tasty and looks nice for guests. Also works with fresh whipped cream and I want to try it with whipped Mascarpone.

I love this recipe. I have made it a few times now, and I usually add more cinnamon, use vanilla yogurt and omit the orange zest as others have suggested. It has always been well received.

I've made this twice, once per recipe and everyone loved it... said it would be a great addition to Thanksgiving. The second time I did not have all the ingredients on hand so skipped the cranberries & orange zest and added more apples. I did not have yogurt so substituted 1/2 brick cream cheese mixed with a few TBS. milk to make a yogurt consistency. Also tossed 1/2 cup of rolled oats into the dough mixture. The kids loved it!

Not too tart, not too sweet. Used the vanilla yogurt as suggested and added some extra brown sugar. Also tripled the recipe easily and with vanilla icecream it easily served 8.

Very yummy, I easily tripled or so the recipe but would also make a nice dessert just for my husband and myself.

Very good. The adults in the family enjoyed it, but the kids didn't. I think it was a little too orange "zesty" for them. Next time, I'll cut back on the zest - maybe by as much as half. It seemed to overpower the apples and cranberries. This would be great at the holidays.

The perfect dessert for a large Christmas dinner. Very festive and very homey. I doubled it, used the vanilla yogurt and served with ice cream. My guests practically licked their bowls.

Loved this recipe. I also tripled it, and doubled th amount of cinnamon and light brown sugar. Does anyone have an alternative for the 'dough' topping? Thanks! Lori

Very good. I added a little extra brown sugar and used the vanilla yoghurt. Turned out fantastic. I've also tripled it. It makes a spectacular presentation in a larger pan.

This is an excellent recipe for a quick dessert. I doubled the brown sugar and cinnamon and added a pinch of ginger powder and nutmeg. I also used vanilla yogurt in the cobbler. Can't wait to make it again!

I agree with the cook from Chapel Hill. I tripled the recipe, used vanilla yogurt, and added more sugar and cinnamon too! The results were delicious. Everyone loved it. Easy and yummy!

I want to first say that this is a really good and is very pretty and impressive looking dish when tripled in a 9x13" dish. I'd like to add a few notes to the recipe. First, add more brown sugar, more cinnamon, and toss the mixture in bowl before adding to the 9x13". Also be sure to use the vanilla yogurt, EVEN if you like tart desserts. I didn't serve with ice cream, although some added whipped cream.

I liked this recipe a lot. Instead of making a cobbler dough I used puff pastry shells and covered the dish to cut down on time. I also added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp ground ginger and 1 tsp cinnamon for added depth. I also used an additional fiji apple.

I've made this dessert 3 times now, always tripling it. It's been quite a hit, and it's also just beautiful to look at. The first time I made it, it was too tart unless eaten with ice cream so I've since added a bit of brown sugar to the topping, or made it with vanilla (instead of plain) yogurt. Also, sprinkling walnuts before spooning on the dough adds a great crunch.

We served this cobbler at a "Harvest Meal" last night and it was a hit with everyone. We tripled the recipe and made it in a 9" X 13" pan. The cooking time was about right. We had shopped at a local farmer's market for the ingredients and were able to get fresh Wisconsin cranberries and Granny Smith apples. We loved the sweet tart flavor. The locally produced Gilles custard topped the cobbler off perfectly!
