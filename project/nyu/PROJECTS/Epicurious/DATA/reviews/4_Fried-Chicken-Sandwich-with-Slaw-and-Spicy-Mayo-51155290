Excellent and easy since, as the reviewer below mentioned, I'm not into frying chicken, so I baked some frozen, breaded chicken tenders from Whole Foods and loaded them on the buns with the slaw and mayo.

A really great combo of flavors. If you are not into frying chicken at least try the slaw, dynamite tasting salad.

Wow! This was great. I was a little scared at first but the flavors together were pretty good!!

This sandwich rocks. I despise mayo and bread-and-butter pickles by themselves, but putting all together with these ingredients makes something magical. I've made this 4 time in the past 2 weeks and it's not getting old.

Made exactly as recipe was written. Excellent. Next time I will add some hot sauce to the buttermilk or some extra cayenne to the flour mixture for more zing. Maybe chipotle in the mayo for more spice. Was really delicious. The slaw was perfect with Famous Dave's sweet and spicy pickles.

Very nice flavor combination. I think I will try the chicken on the grill next time. Had a great light flavor
