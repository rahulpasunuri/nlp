this is probably the best meal i've made off of epicurious, tbh. modifications that i made: i used skinless chicken breast and regular bread crumbs because i already had a huge container of them that i was never going to use. the flavors of this chicken dish are FLAWLESS. it has just the right amount of everything. given the modes that i made, my chicken probably didn't turn out as crispy as it was supposed to and i probably should have skipped the butter drizzle, but i didn't even care-- THAT'S how good it tasted. the dressing for this salad has an extra zip to it and i LOVE that. i had two helpings tonight... which totally negates the purpose of leaving the skin off, but whatevs!

Easy to make and delicious! I put the chicken in the marinade in the morning before going to work, then my husband was able to finish the chicken and make the salad in the evening! We both like the chicken but thought the salad was the best part of the meal.

I was looking for a fried chicken alternative and this chicken is flavorful enough to fit the bill. I started making the recipe before I realized it had to marinate overnight so I only marinated my 6 thighs for 30 minutes or so which was fine. I will do it longer next time - for chicken breasts I imagine it is more important. I used dried thyme and put too much so, if you are using dried just be aware - the thyme was too strong IMO. I also used half the cayenne which turned out great. My teenage daughter and I loved this - will definitely make it again as an alternative to fried.

I made this for my 3yo's bday dinner (8 adults and 4 kids), so I doubled it. It was extremely well-received by all ages, super moist and flavourful. I did a 19-hr marinade. NOTE: this was not the fastest dinner combo I've ever made, so I'd consider it more of a Sat or Sun meal rather than "quick-enough for TUE dinner", but I have little ones. I had 6 VERY LARGE boneless breasts (+/- 3# ea) and 6 organic boneless/skinless thigh pieces as I dislike bones in my chicken. Knowing we'd have some young palates, I left the tiniest hint of cayenne out of the recipe. I tasted it in dry form and personally loved it, but was still a little worried some children would think it was spicy, however it was perfect for everyone. I DEF recommend putting foil under the racks, as I did as an after thought. I wanted to put potato coins below the racks as another reviewer suggested, but didn't and glad because there was some charcoaling from the butter and addt'l coating I'd tossed on missed areas. Instead I paired this with yukon gold potatoes using the super fast "Garlic Thyme potatoes" recipe from this site, which fast and super yummy. SALAD: Amazing! I also doubled it and we needed it tripled for the headcount. I dressed the salad lightly and had nearly half left over (I think it would have swamped it if I'd added it all). Additions to the salad could be toasted, sliced almonds and chunks of avocado to use here or as an anytime salad. Dressing was raved about.

The Marinade was quick and easy to put together . We really enjoyed it, next time I will make it with boneless skinless chicken breasts as suggested

Amazing! I didn't have the time to let it soak overnight, but the few hours it did soak seemed to do the job. This is a wow recipe!

Fabulous! Superb! The chicken came out perfectly with loads of flavor. This is a great variation of fried chicken. (For those die-hard traditional fried chicken lovers: this recipe won't cut it. But for those who are fine with an oven-baked version, this is the tops!!!)

Great and easy. I only marinated the chicken (skinless and boneless) for a few hours. The dressing is great and fresh thyme is important. Panko mixture is great but if you have a spice aversive crowd - thyme, cheese, panko, salt and pepper are great on their own.

This was just terrific! The chicken was so tender and the flavor was perfect. I didn't change the recipe at all. I did, however have to tent the breasts with foil for an additional 5 minutes of cooking as the edges were getting over browned. I served it to a group and everyone loved it. Even the kids liked it.It went great with Mashed potatoes.

Great salad & great chicken. I put cut up potatoes under the chicken to soak up the fat. They got brown & tasty.

This dish was delicious! I marinated the chicken breasts for a full 24 hours. The chicken was tender and flavorful, and we loved the crispy coating! Definitely a "do-over". The buttermilk biscuits I made to accompany the chicken and the salad complemented the meal perfectly.

I love this recipe. I add capers and croutons for fun. Once I substituted crunched up Corn Flakes for the panko and it was great too.

Great recipe - not really quick - but everyone thought it was delicious and could be served to company Used skinless breasts and went heavy on the coating - very moist and perfect doneness with 40 minutes

Too much trouble for a dish that wasn't all that. I won't make it again. I was surprised that this recipe was in the quick and easy section.

Great recipe. Chicken stays nice & moist. I added a little cayenne to the marinade as well, but otherwise pretty much followed the recipe.

I made this using boneless, skinless chicken breasts to eliminate some fat and calories. Otherwise I followed recipe exactly. The coating did stick to the rack (probably because the chicken was skinless) so I will brush the rack with olive oil next time. The bit of coating that fell off the chicken I just threw into the salad, I sliced the breasts on the diagonal and served on top of the salad, and the whole thing was delicious! Will definitely make again!

Nice and easy weekday meal. I like the spicy crust. I prefer to coat the chicken in a second dish so I don't end up with soggy coating for the last few breasts. I also cut the breasts in half because the chicken breasts I get from my local poultry farm tend to be on the larger side.

Salad: almost unbelievably good. A real find. Chicken: good, but the lemon zest overwhelmed. I'll omit next time.

This recipe exceeded my expectations! I made exactly as directed and the chicken breasts turned out perfect and very tasty! I thought the salad dressing was just okay - but it was a nice combination with the chicken.

Did this recipe with boneless, skinless chicken breast strips. Tasted great, but needed twice as much coating, I guess because of the added surface area.

Oops....forgot to mention that there really isn't any need to keep the skin on these breasts. The panko makes a really nice crispy crust.

This was pretty good. Chicken breasts are so huge these days that I just made 4. I went ahead and made the entire recipe for the coating and was glad I did because I used it all. The cayenne adds a nice little zip. I really liked the salad! The dressing is very tasty. I added some sliced kalamata olives.
