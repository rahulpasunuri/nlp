Very, very good and kids loved it. It is flavorful, easy and surprisingly light. Very minor adjustments -- didn't use egglant and used a can of Muir Glen Fire Roasted tomatoes instead of italian plum tomatoes. Also added in a little sgrated swiss cheese in the topping.

I thought this was good but my husband LOVED it = he rarely says anything about my cooking without prodding so this is high praise. Said it had very deep flavors. Made per recipe but added some red pepper flakes, extra garlic and used a bit smokier sausage.

This is a wonderful, easy recipe I will definitely make again. I did not use the margarine and just used the 2 tablespoons of olive oil to saute the sausage. I doubled all the quantities of vegetables and used 1 pound of sausage. I also used dried Italian spices instead of the basil and parsley and used 5 cloves garlic because I love garlicky stews. I topped the whole thing with Parmesan Reggiano and ribbons of fresh basil to serve it.

omitted the eggplants and substitutaed mushrooms, sliced. Also used red pepper flakes instead of cayenne. Because we love sausage, I put in a pound. Very good casserole.

I mad the recipe as written and it was very tasty - except that I felt it was a little watery. Next time I might dice the eggplant, salt them, and let them drain to eliminate some of the moisture. Also, I suggest the you fully drain the tomatoes and add 1 tbls of tomato paste.

This recipe is delicious and full of vegetables. I use turkey or chicken sausage, and double the zucchini and eggplant. You do not need to add the margarine and could get by with less oil if you are trying to be heart healthy.

Awesome and healthy! We used more of a brat-like italian sausage cut up in little chunks and added mushrooms.

Just brought this to a potluck. I doubled everything except the tomatoes and used Muir Organic crushed, not whole. Didn't have zucchini so frozen green beans filled the void, Also, missed the direction where it said to bake...it was a huge hit, just as it was!

My family absolutely loved this. My dad is diabetic, so Im always trying to find ways to limit carbs and this was fantastic. I increased the amount of eggplant to give it more bulk and served it over spaghetti squash instead of pasta. The casserole was so flavorful, he could barely tell. This is definately a keeper.

This is excellent! I used yellow squash instead of eggplant and for the tomatoes...I swear by Muir Organic Fire Roasted Tomates in any dish that I used canned tomatoes. Since my hubby and I like spicy food, I added some crushed red pepper with the sausage, kicked up the cayenne and used pepper jack cheese. Fantastic!

Great one pan dish. I used my cast iron skillet stovetop and in the oven. I used only olive oil, no margarine and subbed fresh tomatoes instead of canned. I used black pepper but think the cayenne will be better. I didn't have any problems with soupiness which I think is due to using fresh tomatoes. I served it over spaghetti squash which added great texture.

I created 2 versions, one w/ sausage for my carnivore husband and one w/ a morningstar mealstarter for my daughter and I. I used muenster and cheddar on the veg one and I thought it was better than the mozzarella and parm on the other. I also left out the green peppers and used crushed instead of plum tomatos. My husband loved it and doesn't like eggplant typically. He said he thought it would taste great as a hotdog topping! ;)

My husband loved this dish. He said it tasted very fresh! I used TVP (textured vegetable protein) to soak up the juices and had a casserole that stood up. First, I put a solid layer of dry TVP on the bottom of my oiled casserole. Next, a layer of sliced raw zucchini and eggplant. No onions or peppers in the house but I doubled the garlic. Then I added a layer of browned turkey sausage, spread tomato sauce over this. Next, coarsely grated Munster cheese and finely grated Romano and Parmesan cheeses. I repeated all the layers a second time and baked it covered at 400 degrees for 30 minutes and uncovered for an additional 15 minutes. The vegetables continued to soften after it was taken out of the oven. I plan on making this again and again, varying it with whatever I have on hand.

Loved this dish. Just made it, but added mushrooms and didn't use any pasta. Also, turkey susage is all I ever use and this went very well with a toss salad.

Added an egg custard,and put it all into an home made savory crust. Used sliced fresh tomatoes.

This recipe was pretty good. It's healthy and I'll definitely make it again.

We absolutely loved this dish. I didn't find it soupy at all. I drained a can of diced tomatoes really well and transferred everything to the baking dish using my slotted spoon. I also added about a cup of mushrooms to the mix and omitted the eggplant. I sprinkled some bread crumbs on top before I added grated Swiss cheese and a little Parmesan. I baked for 15 minutes and broiled for three. I didn't need any rice or pasta, just served with a simple salad. I can't wait to make this again!

As many of the other reviews said, I wouldn't really consider this to be a casserole. It's a great basic pasta sauce (I guess without a lot of sauce). I would definitely serve it with some form of carb, i made roasted potatoes.

This is REALLY GOOD served over spaghetti squash. A great fall pleaser. It's got it all for me; it's tasty, healthy, easy, cheap, full of veggies, low cal, and a one dish meal. As a one dish meal it really only serves about 3. Maybe should be called a "skillet" it's definitely not a casserole.

2 1/2 forks (very tastey). I will make this again but will double the amounts of sausage, onion and cheese and will increase the amount of eggplant and zucchini (but not the tomatoes). The dish is good and healthy (relative to other sausage dishes), easy and pleasant to prepare. I served this with crusty, fresh bread (ideal) and rice (not ideal); next time, I will substitute a green salad for the rice.

I needed another idea instaed of the usual sausage / pappers / and onions.....this recipe was great....I added sliced lettuce as base on the plate and just placed the rest of the casserole over the lettuce.

This was very good and simple to prepare. I used turkey sausage instead of pork. My 4 year old liked it also. He didn't know he was eating eggplant and red peppers. Definitely a keeper!!

We made this for a beach house full of 12 people of various ages and tastes and all proclaimed it wonderful. It was a big hit and one that I would definitely make again.

Loved this, as did my husband and 3 year old. I used butter not margarine, added more cheese and served it over penne pasta, not as healthy but tasted great!

This is a keeper. A very tasty dish. I doubled the amount of cheese and used only a partial can of tomatoes which I had left over from another meal. I guess the smaller amount of tomatoes helped the consistency, because mine stayed together quite nicely as a casserole. However, I did serve it with some penne on the side. I also sprinked the top of the casserole with some Parmesan cheese before baking.

I like the low cost of these ingredients. My grocery store didn't have any eggplant, so I used a mexican squash instead. I also added some leftover chopped fresh tomatoes I had on hand in addition to using the canned tomatoes. It was soupy, so I served it on pasta and it was good.

Mine also didn't look like it was going to hold together, so I went the bread-crumbs-and-noodles route, sprinkled with cheese, and baked. Absolutely delicious-- you know when your husband AND your kids gobble it down, that you've got a hit.

This was totally awesome. I used butter and not marjarine. I doubled the cheese. Mixing some into the CASSEROLE. I used petite cut tomatoes which I drained very well. And on the last 15 minutes of cooking made sure the juices were cooked out. Since I cook in cast iron I made and served the casserole right in the skillet. Cut it like uh pie. It stands alone with hot crusty bread. Used no rice or pasta.. Delish. Will make often...

In answer to the casserole debate: I boiled some rotini pasta and then mixed it with seasoned breadcrumbs and an egg. I followed the rest of the directions for the sauce and then covered the pasta with the sauce and baked it. I loved it and it's better the next day! If you want to keep it vegetarian, just don't incorporate the sausage.

I thought this dish held together quite well actually. I drained my tomatoes really well and added twice as much cheese than was called for and it stayed quite nicely on my plate. I had no peppers so I used extra eggplant, zucchini and sausage and it tasted excellent. I served mine alongside rice (been eating a lot of pasta lately) which was a nice change. I would definetly make this again.

I used cooked polenta to turn this in to a casserole dish, and that worked out quite well.

I agree that this dish is less of a casserole. I omitted the cheese and zucchini, added some capers and used it on top of pasta (penne), we added parmesan after. We had some left overs so I added a bit more tomato sauce and baked it with mozzarella cheese. Both dishes turned out very good.

Do you guys think that adding an egg and bread crumbs would solve the "casserole" delimma?

Absolutely agree...not a casserole. It needs something under it. It was good, but I prefer my own meat sauce.

Yes, very tasty, but does not hold together as a casserole. Maybe it needs more cheese. I spooned this on top of slices of good bread as a fantastic warm relish.

VERRRY tasty. However, it seems more like a sauce than a casserole, and we made it twice because it tastes so good. It stays in my repertoire as a topping for big noodles, not as a casserole.
