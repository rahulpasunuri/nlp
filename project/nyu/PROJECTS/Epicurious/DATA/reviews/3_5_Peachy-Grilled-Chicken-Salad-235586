I added some goat cheese and toasted slivered almonds to this. The only change I made was to leave out the onions in the dressing and I grilled the peaches after halving them. It was an absolutely fabulous way to eat summer fruit. I will definitely make this again. The marinade on the chicken complimented the dressing perfectly.

Fantastic! I made a few adjustments (didn't have Sherry wine vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar instead) and omitted the avocado. Still a lovely, light and flavourful summer dish! =)

Great main course salad. It was a little overdressed the flavors were great together. Next time I will add more avocado. I served this with a homemade tomato soup.

I'm eating this as I type. It's great! I'm constantly looking for new salad recipes that are interesting and easy, and this one hits the mark. It's perfect if you're on a low-carb diet, or if you're just in the mood for something healthy. Don't leave out the radicchio--it keeps everything from tasting too sweet.

very much enjoyed this salad. used tarragon instead of thyme, which was very nice and more peaches. made it a few times last summer and can't wait for this season to commence to be able to do it again.

This recipe was outstanding. My husband raved about the combination of flavors. I made it with fresh Carolina peaches which I dipped in the dressing and then grilled with the cut side down. The chicken was moist and delicious. I will make it again.

Very tasty. I also grilled the peaches before adding them to the salad.

The peaches and avocado were an unexpected and tasty combination, perfect for a summer meal. (Obviously you need to make sure your produce is good quality and ready to eat.) We loved this salad and will make it again!
