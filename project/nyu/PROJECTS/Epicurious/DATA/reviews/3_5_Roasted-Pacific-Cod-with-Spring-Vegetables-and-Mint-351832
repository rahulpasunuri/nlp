so easy and delicious- dinner party for 8: just added more fish and more greens-substituted canned artichokes like the other reviewer, and cut haricot verts for peas + more mint- served with side of quinoa with julienned beets/carrots for a pretty color combo--

I was skeptical of this recipe, since the flavors seemed so simple and it seemed so healthy it might be on the verge of "meh". I was pleasantly surprised, though-- it was fantastic! I didn't have artichokes, and I used basil instead of mint, because my husband hates mint, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly, plus a small squirt of lemon at the end. So delicious! So fresh! I will definitely make this again.

Great way to use up all the veggies in the fridge. Made it per the recipe, and agree that the mint (OK, I mixed basil and mint, from garden) made it. Needed more salt and pepper than I expected, but it was so fresh and seasonal. I had a large hake fillet, it took about 20-25 min to cook. Served with brown basmati rice on the side.

This was easy and yummy. What a great way to get all your veggies, made it for friends last night and everyone declared it a do again three fork. The mint is a must so don't leave it out!

I rated this very healthy dish 4 forks due to its unique and wonderful flavor, ease of preparation and presentation. I followed the recipe as written, and my husband and I loved it (my young kiddos won't touch anything with this many greens in it - sigh). I had no problem with the frozen artichokes turning gray.

Made this tonight with some significant changes. Haddock was on sale, so I used that instead of cod, and it was still delicious. I'd never roasted fish so simply, but it really was flavorful, and so quick! I didn't have scallions or romaine, so I added onions, squash, and a little corn to the zucchini, peas, and artichokes. It tasted delicious and looked so pretty on the plate with all the green and yellow. I saw the review about the artichoke hearts being gray and ugly--I used canned artichoke instead of frozen, and they were a lovely shade, so maybe that would help. The mint is unusual and gives an interesting flavor to it all. Overall, this is a healthy, fast, and flexible dish that I will definitely make again.

I was so excited about this - a little peek at spring to come. As we ate it, we were depressed by the sad gray artichokes on the plate! Everything else was so bright and delicious and the frozen artichokes just dragged it all down into the slough of despair. I don't know what other people thought about it, but I'd make this again and leave out the frozen hearts.

This was delicious! I made some minor adjustments, but nothing that deviated far from the recipe. Strangely, I couldn't find any fresh cod so I used pacific rockfish instead. Subbed canned artichoke hearts for the frozen and used fresh sugar snap peas in place of the frozen peas and the romaine, since I didn't have any on hand. Made everything else as written with a bit less oil. It was light and the flavors were fantastic.
