I made these muffins to go along with breakfast and they are great. Delicious and interesting with the hint of heat from the cayenne. I am planning to serve them with some Mexican fare next time I make them. I recommend this recipe.

These weren't anything great. I was very disappointed. I won't be making these again.

These muffins were really delicious. I used a half of a teaspoon of cayenne and increased the cheddar by about a quarter cup. Next time I might try a little jalapeno for an extra kick!

Moist without being greasy. Tender texture. The cayenne gave them a nice kick.

Really moist, buttery, muffins, very tasty. Substituted yellow corn meal instead of white & it tasted great!
