i think this recipe is great- i sliced my calamari really finely so it was crisp and beautiful the only problem was that i found the vegetable oil to have a bit of a fatty flavour to it??i'm going to hunt around for another lighter tasting oil. Otherwise i served it with some homade mayonnaise with lemon wedges instead and it was great. i loved the sieve idea too!

Finally a recipe for one of my favorite restaurant foods that works! Made exactly as directed, and the coating actually didn't end up in the pot but stayed on the calamari...light tasty and the mayo tastes just right with the peperoncini! It helps to leave calamari in metal sieve while cooking in the oil as it's much easier to remove them all together and safer.

Excellent recipe. I, of course, used more of the seasoning in the coating: 1 tsp and a little more of salt, 1 tsp of black pepper, 1tsp of dried parsley. Very tasty. The rice flour makes the calamari really crunchy. I did not shake off excess flour as suggested in the recipe so I had a thick enough coating. By the time I got to the last batch, the flour had become soggy (too lazy to pat dry the calamari beforehand) and so that batch didnt crisp up. Be careful to fry only a minute or the calamari becomes stringy and hard to chew. Only negative is that the color is not the typical fried stuff golden but more of a pale brown. I dont mind that. I never thought I could make calamari at home, let alone make is so that it would be better than what I've had in the restaurants! Thanks for this recipe.

Okay, the only reason that I would make this again is because my boyfriend really liked it, so maybe it's just personal preference. I thought the coating was too light...sorry, but I like crispy golden calmari. Anyway, I am going to keep looking for another recipe.

The calamari was so easy to make, I never order it when I go out to eat any more! We also tried dipping the calamari in beaten eggs before the rice flour and it turned out great! The rings were a little heartier.

The best Calamari, so crisp, just like my favorite restaurant.

This is now my favorite recipe for Fried Calamari. I love the delicate crispy crust. Not at all soggy or gloppy. Sorry I didn't make the mayonnaise I just used tomato sauce but you can be sure I will make the mayonnaise the next time!!

And you might try the mayonnaise as a "different" dipping sauce for Tempura. Really good.
