I found this recipe to be a waste of good (and expensive) lamb. The flavors were overpowering and we could have been eating anything underneath all that. After one chop, I gave up on putting sauce on the lamb and ate it without, but then it was too dry and still not very good. I tried the sauce on rice and even that didn't work. I actually tossed the leftover lamb chops. It takes a lot for me to do that. I should have listened to my instincts but it was rated so highly I decided to give it a try.

Made this with 4 thick lamb chops, so cut the rub into third. I used 1 TB chipotle chili powder which made the rub very spicey - would cut back on amount of chili next time. Reduce the sauce recipe in half, using 1/2 tsp chipotle chili powder. Great tasting rub and sauce. Will definitely make again. Nice change of flavor.

Made this last night with racks of lamb instead of chops. This was particularly flavorful lamb that stood up to the hefty flavors of this rub and sauce. Made both according to the recipe, but my chile powder is very spicy, so it was hotter than others would be. We also used our own rich beef stock. We used the sauce sparingly, but it was really great and complemented the lamb well. I will definitely make this again. We loved it.

Great recipe! I don't know why they call the sauce chili-CILANTRO since there is no cilantro in the sauce. Quite simple to make and the flavors are great together. I actually added a little chopped cilantro to the sauce but not enough to even taste it. Next time I will add more. They sauce does need a little more flavor and maybe less butter.

Loved this dish, served on a bed of garlic mash with some grilled zucchini and it was fantastic. Will definately make this recipe again.

It was great! I made extra of the spice blend and used it on other meats as rubs. I would definitely make this again.

This was a very easy recipe to make for a novice in the kitchen. The lamb chops were moist and well-seasoned. I am very nervous about making meat -- I either overcook it or undercook it -- the chops were perfect! I took the advice of others on the board and avoided the McCormick's Chili Powder, which I'm sure made a difference!

Made this dish last weekend and it was a HIT at my dinner party. Even those who were not fond of lamb thought the flavors were great. I followed the recipe but added a litte salt and marinated overnight. I served it with curried couscous and asparagus with gorgonzola butter.

The Best-an unusual flavor combo for lamb- easy and great paired with plain buttered short grain rice and green beans with cilantro/lime dressing and a margarita.

This is a fantastic way to serve lamb chops! Prepared it as written and they came out wonderful. This is the second time I fixed it this way and will cook it again and again! Very easy and very tasty, two things that make it even more desirable. I used fresh cilantro the first time and dried the second. Both were good and work well. I didn't have enough time to let the chops sit for 8 hours (only 3 hours) and couldn't tell much difference. By all means, give this one a try, you'll be glad you did!

I made this dish for a Mexican party and naturally had to try it beforehand. It melted in my mouth and so it will in yours too. My guests couldn't get enough of it and it was gone in the wink of an eye. Absolutely divine!!

I don't know why anyone would change even one aspect of this recipe. It is perfect as is. I've made it over and over. Be careful to refer to the instructions, so you don't use the whole 4 T. of chile powder in the rub. I love cilantro, and can't imagine omitting it. An all-time fav!

This recipe sounded different and kind of strange but it was outstanding! Very spicy. I don't care for cumin, so I left it out and otherwise followed the recipe. Absolutely delicious - try it!

we made only the rub and used it on lamb rib chops. left rub on overnight. grilled chops to medium rare. i was apprehensive when i smelled the rub. it seemed to have too much cumin but, the grilled result seemed to be better balanced. i used ancho chile powder. cilantro doesn't seem to add anything to the rub/marination process, a little fresh chopped for garnish was a nice finish though.

I used the "rub" on pork chops about an hour before grilling them. Didn't have time to make the sauce. It was terrific; will surely make it again, maybe with lamb!

In a word...outstanding. Didn't have shallots and used same amount of chopped onion. Worked fine. Took others' advice and cut the chili powder in half. Good tip. Would also recommend a quarter of the butter recommended and adding as you see fit, depending on how buttery you would like the sauce to be. Can't wait to try out this wonderful recipe on guests!

I thought the dish was very good. I cut down the chili powder to 1 tablespoon on the marinade and 1 tablespoon in the sauce, this way it was not to overpowering. I would recommend this, it puts a different twist on lamb.

I thought was recipe was great. Maybe the dislike with the chili powder comes from cooks using chili powder from McCormick spices which includes not only chili but cumin, oregano, garlic etc. (this would overpower the lamb). The New Mexico Chili Powder (from Mojave which is sold in bags in the mexican spice section of most markets) just has chili powder which is like adding cayenne pepper to a dish - adds spice. It might be worth another try with this switch.

Do not let the negitive comments about the chili powder scare you off! This is an outstanding way to cook lamb chops! I have served this many times with rave reviews. Give it a try.

Chilli-powder and lamb? I don't think so........ omit the chilli-powder and it's a decent recipe.

I'll have to agree with the first reviewer, the chili powder completely overpowered the whole dish. It may turn out ok if the chili powder were reduced by half or as much as 3/4.

My first try with this recipe was a disaster. I may have been a little heavy on the chili powder, since that was the part I liked the least. I will try it again, though. I am a big fan of lamb.

I made this when I first saw the recipe in Bon Appetit and have made it several times since. It has become my favorite way to serve lamb. It does have a bit of a bite.
