Really excellent as written, we've made it multiple times for guests and it's always been a hit.

I have made this recipe many times and served it this past weekend. I used 7 oz. chilean sea bass. A friend is allergic and this was dinner for 12 so I gave that guest shrimp with same sauce. I make double the sauce for the 6 pieces of fish as I think it adds to the recipe to have it saucier. I also add two TBS of hot chili sauce to the sake mixture and more soy than recipe calls for. The hot chili sauce gives it more kick. I also add approx. 3/4 cup of chopped seasonal vegetables to steam with the fish. It takes 20 minutes this way but is a more complete meal!

had chilean sea bass and didn't have time to marinate for a few hours. great simple recipe. i forgot to salt the fish before. next time, i will include a some miso and slivers of gingers to include.

Fun and easy to make and it's so healthy, I'd like it to be a regular weeknight dish. I made it adding the shitakes and yellow peppers as another reviewer suggested. It was really good, but I think it needs a little fat to distribute the flavor. I'm going to add a little olive oil next time.

This was a GREAT receipe. The only thing different I did was use aluminum foil instead of parchment and added garlic & sesame oil (but no sugar). I sauteed all the ingredients besides the fish for a few minutes to marry the tastes and then cooked for 15 minutes. Served over rice and stir fried bok choy with similar sauce. Amazing light and healthy dinner.

P.S. in addition to the Yellow Peppers, Shitakes, and garlic, I use a little more of the soy/sake mixture than the recipe calls for... I find that adds more flavor. Made the mistake of adding TOO much sauce and it tasted a little too boozy with the sake.

4 Forks... but with the following additions per pouch. 1/8th - 1/4 Yellow Pepper cut in thin strips. 4+ shitake mushrooms cut in thin strips. A little minced garlic. That makes it perfect.

very bland needs more complexity Probably will try again with some modifications...

I agree with a few of the other folks, it was a tad bit bland. It was good, but there was something missing. I'll try the recipe again, but perhaps will take the lead of someone who mentioned using lemongrass - I'll prob throw in a bit more salt, and perhaps a little garlic.. The scallions added an amazing flavor, so don't skip out there.

this was outrageously delicious. the market only had tilapia, so no sea bass for me but it was a great replacement, near as i can figure. previous reviewers were spot-on to surmise that any meaty white fish would do and the big T is so inexpensive. i found the presentation rather awkward, so when i make it again tonight, i'm gonna lose the parchment packet before setting down on the table. my boyfriend said it looks as though dinner was being served a wet paper bag and he was not incorrect. [he shut up pretty fast when hoovering up the delicious dinner, though!] my only other change was to increase the grated ginger by about half but i loooove fresh ginger. i have no doubt that it would have been equally tasty exactly as written. i served my fishies with the bok choy/cabbage/sesame oil combo on this site and jasmine rice. delicate, tasty and good for me. 4 forks! yeah!

This recipe is so easy and delicious that it is worth trying. I read the other reviews and made some changes. I heated the sauce ingredients and added grated garlic (3 cloves) and some lemon grass to make it a little more complex and flavorful. I took the lemon grass out before spooning the sauce over the fish. I also added shallots to the green onions and thinly sliced shitake mushrooms. I didn't have parchment, so put 4 pieces in foil and folded it over to seal. I cooked it 12 min and the fish came out perfectly. However, I will say the flavor was a bit mild for me--others loved it. Next time, I will marinate the fish about 30 min. prior to see if I can get a little more flavor.

Delicious!!! I added honey instead of sugar ...not by choice but because didn't have sugar at that moment.It looks good! It tastes great! I used a risotto with clam juice as a base for a side dish.

So yummy! The whole foods near us didn't have sea bass so I substituted it with halibut. The dish was a huge hit.

Followed the recipe to a T. Used a Junmai grade sake- I'm of the opinion that if I wouldn't drink it, then I wouldn't cook with it... Used beautiful pieces of Sea Bass. We thought this was fantastic. Really easy to boot.

Delicious and great presentation. I substituted Tilapia for Sea Bass as it was not available at our local co-op. Paired with the stir fried cabbage and bok choy. Yum!!!!

great recipe! definitely needs more liquid (sake). i softened the green part of a scallion in hot water and used it to tie the parchment. i think it looks better for presentation.

Excellent. Not a really mindblowing sort of dish, more of a subtle flavor that is about quality, delicacy and simplicity. It is basically like the Chinese famous dish of steamed fish with ginger and scallions, this one just adds sake and puts it into parchment which advances the presentation. It is easy- takes about 5 minutes to prepare- and tasty. The sauce is critical to make enough of since this dish is so simple and your guests will want to have some so that the fish is moist and it can run over into the rice.

WOW! this is an amazing recipe. sea bass is my favorite fish, so i'm a bit partial. my husband told me this was the best meal i'd every prepared for him (i paired it w/ the napa cabbage w/ cilantro dressing recipe and rice). if you want to impress someone who likes fish, this is how to do it!

Made for dinner and thought it was perfect as is - since I'd never made this dish before I followed the recipe perfectly, and I would not change a thing. Served with steamed sugar snap peas and quinoa.

Delicious, light, and is gorgeous on the plate. My sister accused me of showing off, in a joking manner, then immediately wanted the recipe.

Absolutely the easiest dish to prepare! Quite dramatic with the parchment and no clean up. I used a little more sake and added some lemon zest. Will do again and again... everyone thought it took hours to make

I used halibut rather than sea bass, and I think any meaty white fish will do. These packages present beautifully and the sauce flavored the white rice and sauteed bok choy (from the same issue of Gourmet) I served alongside. The only drawback is: what to do with the parchment paper? I just collected the pieces from everyone at the start of the meal. A delicious, elegant dish. I was asked for the recipe.

This is delicious and the presentation is lovely for company. I will make extra sauce next time - it is terrific on jasmine rice.

This isn't a "wow" dish but very pleasing and healthy tasting, I used Chilean Sea Bass and it was delicious. I tried the lemon zest and it definitely enhanced the flavor. Presentation is lovely.

Served this last night along with the Gourmet Mag. recommended stir- fried bok choy and cabbage. I didn't have sake so I used rice wine vinegar and served all of this over brown basmati rice in a large bowl to use the wonderful juices from the fish. Yummy! Will definitely serve this healthy meal again and again.

Great recipe and so simple. I used Basa fish (on sale at Dominick's) and think any firm whitefish would be good in this recipe. Served with jasmine rice and stir-fried pea pods.

Delicious! Substitued agave nectar for the sugar, and tamari for the soy sauce. This came out perfect. My one piece of advice is to really stir the sake mixture before you spoon it over the fish. The ginger is an important part of the dish, and it sinks to the bottom when it is not stirred right before. I posted the updated version on my blog!

Great recipe and very easy to make. I found sweetened sake so I eliminated the sugar. Serve it with Jasmine rice and stir-fried bok choy for a healthy and wonderful meal.

I loved this recipe. The flavor was slightly sweet. The parchment made it really easy to bake the fish without worrying about overcooking. This would be a great recipe for company.

wow! Great recipe and sooo easy. I too used a bit more ginger and a tiny bit more soy sauce - and had flounder on hand, not sea bass - oh yeah - added about a teaspoon and a 1/2 of lemon zest (cuz I like it) and it was delicious! Will definitely make this again soon!

Served this last night to rave reviews. Simple but delicious. I like fresh ginger and doubled the amount. It was extremely flavorful. I will definitely make this again.

I was torn between three and four stars. I did feel this needed something...more flavor. I added ginger but it still needed something. Lemongrass? Mushrooms? BUT...it was so light and SO easy to make. The cooking time was perfect! I would definitely make this again and would recommend it!
