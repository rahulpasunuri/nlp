If I could give it more forks, I would. Wonderful!! I used plain, lightly sweetened whipped cream for the topping. I will not make any other chocolate pudding!

Everyone who tries this, LOVES it! My mother even requests this instead of her birthday cake. Be sure to temper the eggs slowly and use the blender as it can affect the texture if you don't. Enjoy!

Fabulous! I cocked up and halved the recipe, but didn't halve the Guinness, oops. It probably worked out well as the chocolate I used turned out to be more semi-sweet than bitter-sweet. Still, it was a lovely texture, and a nice balance of sweetness and bitter, and indeed quite rich: My housemate couldn't finish his, what a tragedy that I had to have more. I'm making it again, and this time I'm intentionally doubling the Guinness called for, going with fully bittersweet chocolate, and I'm not going to burn the Guinness syrup either! (It was perfectly palatable with just slightly sweetened whipped cream) I like the idea of a Baileys whipped cream though, so if there's any of that around next time I make this, that's going on top.

Tasty, but too sweet. I'm a bit nervous about losing the texture by cutting back on the sugar, but will try it if I do decide to make this again.

Figured out it was MY mistake in reading the recipe...whoops! So I made it again, and...WOW!! It's amazing! Definitely VERY rich but definitely will make this again sometime. I omitted the Guinness syrup in the whipping cream per other reviews which really complimented the pudding...but then again, I'm not much of an actual Guinness fan in the first place so I didn't miss it but the Guinness was sure good with the chocolate!! Definitely needs the whipped cream to help temper the richness of the dessert...so good...

This was a HUGE hit with my friends. I have made it twice now. I changed it up just a little and used one bar of 72% cacao and one bar of 90% cacao. I also added 3 tablespoons of Sugar to the "foam" that way it was a little sweeter. I put the pudding in little 9 oz clear plastic cups to make it look more like a little drink.

Loved this - it was a big hit for St. Patrick's Day. I did add just a touch of sugar to the whipped cream topping. The pudding is delicious and very rich. The next time I make it... and I will make it again... I will make smaller servings - Did I mention it is very rich?

Ok, so wondering if it is actually supposed to be a "pudding" or a thick drink...trying to decide if I just messed up or really came out with the right dessert...mine never set up to a stiff consistently...just thick...help???

Made the recipe with a micro brew chocolate stout and did not make the cream topping. The pudding turned out terrific having used the best 72% dark chocolate I could find. For the topping, I used chopped Andes Candies and some chocolate nibs. This will be saved and repeated.

So here's the thing...without those particular glasses this is just a delicious pudding dessert. It doesn't translate for St. Patrick's day without those cute glasses! But that being said, the pudding is delicious. I did decide to instead make whipped cream using Bailey's and powdered sugar. That really pumped up the dessert and actually made it taste more like a "car bomb" drink. Very rich and yummy, but darn I wish I had the glasses!

This is absolutely amazing! If you are looking for a St. Patrick's Day dessert - look no further. It's easy and one of the best chocolate desserts I have ever had or made! Made it last year for St. Patrick's Day and am making this year again. Didn't love the Guinness in the cream, though. Straight whipped cream is better.

I have made this three times now for an annual St. Pat's party, and I always get asked, uh, told, to "make it again." This time, I am making it with Brooklyn Brewery's Black Chocolate Stout and Green and Black's organic 72% baker's chocolate. So far, the pudding is delicious! Will top them tomorrow with the chocolate stout whipped cream. I find this pudding is so rich, that filling a smaller beer tasting flight glass (4-5 oz.) and topping it with the whipped cream is enough. The flight paddle then makes a great serving tray. To enjoy this fully, focus on the fact it has DARK chocolate in it, and live in denial about the rest!

I made this for my husband and his friends one night when they were brewing beer. It seemed fitting. This recipe is delicious. Everyone loved the chocolate pudding, even me and I don't like beer at all. The cream on top was not a hit until I added 2 Tbsp powdered sugar to counter the bitterness of the Guinness syrup. I will make this again, but will serve it in smaller portions since it's so rich.

We used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of bittersweet chocolate. Also, I put Bailey's in the topping, instead of the Guiness syrup. Rich, chocolatey, and delicious! The Guiness is not very detectable in the flavor, but it makes the pudding taste a little like mocha. Planning on making this a St. Patty's Day tradition!

Rating: 4
Recipe turned out perfectly. Couldn't really taste the Guinness in the pudding but definitely in the whipping cream. I didn't blend it so it was probably a bit denser than intended & I portioned it out to 8 servings (perfect for the guys, a little much for the women) which is how I'd do it again.

Rating: 4
I actually followed the recipe, so I'll rate it. The recipe was excellent as-is. A bit gimmicky (Get it? Looks like a Guiness? HA HA HA!!! CUTE!!! ugh...) Put the dessert in smaller containers, as it is very rich.

Great recipe, but I would definitely reduce the serving size as it is very rich. I think I could have easily made this into 8-10 servings. Be sure to use good quality chocolate as it is the dominant flavor in the pudding.

Rating: 4
Loved it! I used the whole cup of Guinness in the pudding, next time I think I'll cut back the sugar to 3/4 cup as I found it a little too sweet. I didn't put the syrup into the cream as I prefer cream to just be cream without anything added. It's really important to simmer it for at least 15 minutes (it took 20 minutes for mine to thicken). It does take a while to set, I had it in the fridge by 10am and it was perfect at 6pm. Delicious desert for our St Patricks day dinner. For the Aussies, this recipe fills 6 middy glasses.

Rating: 4
Excellent pudding, with a great balance of flavor between the chocolate and Guinness. It took a bit longer to set than I anticipated, but it was worth the couple day wait. Also, the whipped topping was too bitter, so I added a bit of sugar and vanilla to it, and it was perfect. I will definitely make this again.

Nice, grown-up chocolate pudding. Perfect for St. Paddy's day.

I'll be making this again! It's so good, but I'll use Murphy's next time around if I can get it, as I'm partial to Murphy's to Guinness. The Guinness whipped cream was a little bitter, but it didn't detract from the finished pudding at all and made it look like the pudding cups had a frothy head, which added to the presentation. Thank you so much for this recipe!

split the recipe into about a dozen servings! very tasty but too much at once.

This dessert is very rich. Delicious, but it was difficult to get through a half-pint of it. Served in smaller glasses it would be excellent. If you follow the recipe the dessert sets well. The Guinness taste is well balanced with the chocolate. I used Green and Blacks 70% cocoa organic chocolate, and you could definately taste the Guinness through it. Very nice.

I recently made this for a large St. Patrick's Day party in mini glasses.It is rich and delicious, and was a big hit. Do NOT restrict yourself to eating it on St. Patrick's Day--it's too good to eat only once a year!

Made this last night and found it to be awesome! Made some substitutions because I live in Iowa where premium ingredients are not always readily available. Used 4 oz. 60% Giradelli cocoa bar and 3oz. Hershy's dark cocoa(9 T. Hershey's dark cocoa powder + 3 T. butter flavored Crisco) that I had on hand and needed to use. Used 4 whole eggs in place of 8 egg yolks (because I don't like waste). And lastly used a pint bottle of Young's Double Chocolate Stout because all the Guiness was in 6 packs. Wasn't sure about the syrup in the whipped cream, but added it anyway to keep with theme. The whipped cream doesn't need sugar, as the pudding has plenty. The beer taste of this is very mild, but a perfect accompaniment for St. Patrick's Day.

I think you can make the shamrocks by rolling folded construction paper into tight rolls, glue, then make a "stem" with another folded piece. Good luck!

Yummy and very rich. I've made this dessert every St. Pat's Day for the last 3 years and will make it again this year, as well as for the Oscar party I'm going too....(rooting for The Fighter). The fact that it goes into the blender was huge for me because of my fear of pouring hot into eggs.

hey guys! I tried this recipe the other day and I loved it. It was chocolatey, and the guinness was the perfect combination. It was so good it even reconnected me with a long lost flame. But one thing that i have to say is that if youre having troubles with it thickening, then cook it a little longer. You are supposed to cook it to the nappe stage, which means it coats the back of a wooden spoon, and using your finger, you can draw a clean line through it. If it falls off the spoon in a stream, its not thick enough. You dont need cornstarch. In fact, in european puddings, cornstarch is never used because they didnt have corn until america was discovered. This pudding is thickened with egg proteins, which dont coagulate (thicken up) until the mixture reaches at least 165F.

Rating: 4
I followed the recipe with the exception of 2 items. I had to use Murphy's stout as the last can of Guinness at the beer store looked like it had been driven over by a truck. I also added some powdered sugar to the whipped cream topping. I have to say that this pudding is really good. If you like chocolate, this one is for you. I used Green and Black's chocolate (85% cocoa). It was rather intense. But oh, so good! Will be making this again for sure.

I made this decadent dessert with Valor Chocolate from Spain and what a hit this was for a St. Patricks day celebration. And yes enjoying a pint of Guinness while cooking just makes it all the better. I also put a Shamrock design on each dessert. Premium chocolate is the only way to go with this recipe.

I never thought I would have said this about my favorite site, but this was AWFUL! First, it did not set up....I am an avid cook, making chocolate pudding from scratch for my chocolate cream pie....how does this thicken without cornstarch???? Cornstarch is in just about any pudding/custard I've ever made. And, no bringing to a boil? Second, it is wayyyyyyyy to intensely flavored, & the bitterness of the whipped cream did not balance with the overly sweet chocolate-----liquid. There is no picture & that's too bad because perhaps this is meant to be a drink? rather than a pudding or custard? A photo would have definitely helped. I know I didn't goof on the directions. As several others put it....."what a waste of Guinness"!

very good, I had trouble with it setting up. I made it as instructed so not sure, no one else seemed to have this problem and I'm not inexperienced...hmmm. 1/4 c. cornstarch did the trick but I wouldn't add it if you don't need to....used chocolate mint baileys in the whipped cream instead of the syrup and threw in some mint into the pudding.

I made this to bring to a st patrick's day party. It was a huge hit. I used 1/2 60% cacao and 1/2 100% cacao bittersweet chocolate. When I make it again I will use less 100% b/c it was a little on the bittersweet side. but still very tasty and easy to make.

I recently made this for a friend's birthday party in lieu of cake because she's such a big Guinness lover. She loved it, and so did everyone else who got a taste. It didn't taste quite as Guinness-y as I would have hoped, but it was rich and delicious. I'll definitely be making up another batch when St. Patrick's Day rolls around.

I made this as an alternative to cake for my husband's recent birthday. Since it was just the two of us, I halved the recipe and served it in old fashioned glasses. We're both big fans of Guinness and dark chocolate and couldn't imagine a better pairing of the two. We'll definitely make it again.

Would be 4 forks, likely, if I had used whipping cream instead of half & half .... oops. DO NOT SUBSTITUTE 1/2 & 1/2 FOR CREAM -- it will never set properly ... made for decadent chocolate shakes!

Loved it - rich and decadent. Used 74% cocoa and a Guinness stout and changed the whipped cream only by ditching the reduced guinness and adding about a tablespoon of powdered sugar and a couple of teaspoons of irish whiskey. My beer lover guests loved as well. One guest who does not like beer but loves chocolate thought that the beer flavor just made the chocolate taste funny. I was drinking a Rogue chocolate stout with dinner and thought that the pudding was the solid to my beer's liquid.

We love this and always get rave reviews. The topping is very strong by itself but compliments the pudding wonderfully.

Love this recipe. No, the pudding doesn't taste like guinness (thank goodness!) but it does taste like chocolate plus something...perfect. I prefer plain whipping cream with it - the guinness syrup whip cream is definitely NOT a hit with kids. I add a little vanilla to make the "foam" the right color. I use 9 oz plastic glasses and it makes 8 servings. Yum.

A friend brought this to our St Patty's day dinner and it was a huge hit! I tried using it as a filling for a birthday cake and it was absolutely perfect. I think this pudding is great because, yes, it does have rich chocolatey flavor, but the Guinness adds a hint of something different that, I feel, really makes it special.

I served this in glasses that look like pint glasses only 1/2 size. With the Guinness whipped cream topping the glass looked just like a freshly poured Guinness. As for taste it was deep, rich and creamy. A huge St. Pat's day hit. Everyone wanted the recipe.

Rating: 2
Definitely a charming dessert, but extremely rich...almost too much. Reducing the Guiness left me with a bitter taste that I didn't think enhanced the whipped cream. Instead the whipped cream needed confectioner's sugar to counter-balance the richness of the rest of the dessert. Not sure I would make this again.

This was excellent! The only complaint I had was that it didn't really taste at all of Guinness- I think the chocolate overpowered it. But it was so delicious nobody cared! I actually divided it into 10 servings and it was plenty because it is so rich. Will definitely make again, but next time I will try making a reduction of Guinness for the pudding as well as the topping.

Rich! Serve in small dishes. If you don't want it to be runny, don't lick your spoon. Taste with a new spoon every time you taste. Your saliva will digest the pudding making it soupy. Same goes for salad dressings using sour cream or mayo.

Made this for our St. Pat's Day party along with the Corned Beef/Cabbage and Champ recipes on this site. The pudding is great but why the need to blend it?? ? I put it in my blender as stated and promptly wound up with pudding all over myself and my kitchen (and I was making use of the steam valve). NOT FUN! Other than that, the recipe was simple enough and looks beautiful. Happy Saint Patrick's Day!

I just made a trial batch of this to determine whether to fix it for St. Patrick's Day. The taste is sensational! Even my 14-yr old picky eater loved it (and spent the whole time shouting "brilliant! " as a result). It looks great in glasses, but considering how rich this is, I will use much smaller dishes next time (4-6oz juice glasses would be perfect). I also stamped the whipped cream with a shamrock cookie cutter, as they do with Guiness in most Irish pubs. My only mistake was that I cooked the pudding an extra long time (wanted to be very sure that it would set up properly). The result was something more the consistency of purchased frosting (in a tub) rather than pudding. Next time I'll just follow the directions. I sweetened the whipping cream with a little sugar, but no other adjustments were necessary. Fabulous dessert for adults and children too!

Rating: 4
the first time i made this people were licking the glasses clean. it's incredibly easy to make, although i could not get the guinness to reduce to save my life-it ended up tasting bitter. instead i made the whipped topping with a bit of coffee extract, which added to the overall flavour of the pudding. the second time i made this was for a large gathering, and i doubled the recipe. the end result was very soupy and thin-thus, if making more than the recipe calls for, make the batches separately.

I made this many years ago but didn't use beer in the recipie. Chocolate mouse (using 80% dark chocolate) for the black part, chocolate instant whip for the lower head and double cream for the top head. I thought I had invented it but great minds think alike. Definitely for chocoholics only. I called it "Eat the dark part through the white part" which was based on an advertising slogan used here in the UK many years ago. JG (just an amateur cook).

This is one of the most rich things I've ever eaten. You will not eat anywhere near a full pint of this, and if you do, you will struggle to breathe the rest of the night. That said, it was really good. I also added a little bit of powdered sugar to the cream, but it might not be necessary.

Rating: 4
This recipe is fantastic! Hold tight on the lid of the blender so chocolate doesn't go flying everywhere... and make sure to stop beating the cream for the top when it starts to "peak" I kept beating mine and the consistancy turned a little chunky- but that's my fault! You will only have RAVE reviews with this dessert! One last thing- it is very rich. I think cutting the serving size to 4 oz would be good, and that way you have more servings (someone can always have seconds!)

this was amazing - the guinness added such a nice, bittersweet taste to the pudding - will make all year round!!

I also made this for St. Patrick's Day and it was awesome. Like another reviewer, my old fashioned glasses were larger, so the portions, after adding the whipped cream, filled the cups up about 3/4 of the way. I cooked the remaining beer for the syrup whilst the pudding was cooking, to save time. I have good pans (All Clad copper core) so it took just the time it said in the original recipe.The whipping cream is a bit bitter, but it's a nice foil for the dense complex pudding. I guess you could sweeten it, but it was stunning just as is. Two quick notes: the "special equipment" that it calls for also includes a blender set up and ready to go (no big deal, but if you didn't read through the recipe totally, you'll be scrambling!), and this recipe uses quite a few eggs. But it's easy, fun, unique, and tastes incredible!!!

This recipe is destined to become a St. Patrick's Day tradition in our home! I used Scharffen Berger chocolate, but realized that it was unsweetened baking chocolate instead of bittersweet, so I had to reduce the chocolate and increase the sugar, and it turned out great anyway. My old-fashioned glasses were larger than 8 oz., so the servings were too large for so rich a dessert. Overall this recipe was fun and delicious - we'll make it again and again!

This was delicious, and fun to make. I made it for a St. Patrick's Day party, and everyone loved it. I used 60% cocoa chocolate, because I couldn't find any 70%, and it was still rich and dark. Boiling down the guinness for the syrup took more like 40 minutes. I added a pinch of sugar to the whipped cream/guinness mixture, because it was so bitter. Since I was bringing this to a party, I put it in small clear plastic cups. We put the cups on a round platter with a full can of guinness in the center, which made it look festive. I would make this again!
