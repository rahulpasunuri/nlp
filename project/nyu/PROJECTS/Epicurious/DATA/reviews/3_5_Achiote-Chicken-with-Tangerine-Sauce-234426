I don't even bother doing the sauce. Just marinate the chicken then throw it on the grill. HUGE hit for Taco night.

Very tasty, yet mild, WITH three changes I made: 1. I used more than a tbsp of oil for frying the chicken (1/4 cup), 2. I used an orange liquor instead of juice (although less of it), and 3. I mounted the juices that remained after reduction with mascarpone to make a rich sweet sauce.

My husband loved this recipe. I used the paste on cornish game hens and basted with the tangerine juice mixed with the remaining paste and baked in the oven.

Yummy, I'd eat this happily,but it was a bit too 'ethnic' tasting for me. Flavors were simple, it literally tasted like orange juice, so I wouldn't make it for a fancy meal. Tasty, but overall not impressive enough.

Outstanding! Very tasty and unusual! And extremely easy. Will definitely make this again.

I had to go to Queens to find the achiote paste but it was well worth it. I made this dish for a dinner party and it was a huge hit (I made it with Valencia oranges because tangerines were out of the season). The chicken was very moist and best of all there was very little oil needed. I wouldn't add anything (especially not parmesean cheese as recommended by someone else??).

Very, very good. Interesting to pair the sweet tangerine with the usual tangy vinegar achiote preparation, with good results. Well accompanied by Sauvignon Blanc. Wife's review: I can make this any time.
