This was my first time making this type of dish, and wow I must say it is an excellent recipe. My husband said it was the best thing I ever made (granted we have only been married 1 year, but still, I cook at least twice a week). Easy, quick, and better than a restaurant! ( I did use real tomatoes instead of canned though, and a bit of chicken stock),

Love this recipe as a starting point. I add a third bell pepper, one anaheim pepper, one hungarian pepper, and 3 small red jalapeno peppers, seeded; Great with whole wheat penne and I liked experimenting with pre-cooked chicken andouille and venison sausage. Has the benefit of being even better when re-heated the next day.

I used twice as much garlic as called for and added it after the sausage was cooked. I also added a teaspoon of fennel seeds and red pepper flakes to the sausage while it cooked, and added chicken stock at the end for more substance. Very tasty!

Quick, easy, and delicious weeknight pasta dish. From start to finish you can have it ready in a half hour. 4 forks for the combination of taste and convenience. Much lighter and brighter than using a jar of pasta sauce (my wife's old standby impromptu approach). After making the recipe "straight up," I find I agree with other reviewers that you should use somewhat less oil (plenty in the sausage!), and that the garlic should be added later to avoid overbrowning (I think I'd add it for the last minute or so of sauteeing the sausage, before the vegetables are added). I used hot Italian sausage and didn't feel a need for red pepper flakes, which I might have wanted if I'd used the sweet. Just don't use a bland Italian sausage; as another reviewer noted, you want a well-seasoned quality sausage here.

Made this for a family dinner. I used chicken & apple sausages, since that's what I had in the fridge. I skipped the canned tomatoes and used chicken broth instead, since I have a daughter who hates tomatoes. It turned out to be delicious! Good, simple flavors that combine really nicely.

It makes for a quick and easy weeknight meal, especially as the ingredients were at-hand. I used pork sausage with sun-dried tomatoes. Also, I halved the amount of sausage, which works well for us. I didn't add the garlic until after the vegetables were added, as I didn't want it to burn.

It is too easy to burn the garlic in this recipe. I would suggest that the sausage should be browned first and then add the garlic and the rest of the ingredients.

Vegans and vegetarians should not rush on past this recipe. It can easily be turned into an intense and memorable meatless delectation. Simply substitute a vegan sausage (there are no splendid vegan sausages but Tofurkey makes OK Italian and Kielbasa) and knock the total down to one pound since the recipe is too sausage heavy to begin with. You could also substitute Morningstar Crumbles or the excellent Dominex Eggplant Meatballs for the sausages. I would change the prep procedure by starting with a large diced onion and sauteeing for 3 min then adding 3 peppers cut into shortish strips slong with the garlic (5 cloves minced). Continue for 5 minutes. I then tossed in a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes with Italian seasonings plus a 10 oz can of tomatoes with hottish peppers and the basil, oregano and one-half t of red pepper flakes and followed that with 4 oz of red wine (which I think was a highly virtuous contribution to the final result). Then simmer 15 - 20 min or until the liquid is reduced to your specifications. The vegan sausage or meatballs will be precooked and can be heated up separately and added 2 or 3 min before the end. Almost any dried version of Italian pasta will be vegan (but check for eggs on the ingredient list to be sure). Enjoy.

This was a delicious, quick recipe. Both of my kids ate and enjoyed it. I used fresh basil instead of dried, about 1/3 cup. Very comforting on a chilly night.

Rating: 2
I agree with most of the previous reviewers. This dish is good, but not great, weeknight meal. It's quick and can be made with pantry/freezer items. To make it healthier, I cut WAY back on the oil and added more spice. I used twice the garlic, along with red chili flakes and fennel seeds. Finally, I put in a splash of balsamic vinegar to bring out the sweetness of the peppers. I'll make it again.

I didn't expect much from this recipe, other than it looked easy and was made up of ingredients on hand. The result was so good! I used a 12 oz package of Applegate Farms fire roasted red pepper sausage, which I highly recommend if you can find it. In order to make a bit more sauce I added about 1 cup of TJ's chicken stock, about 1/4 cup red wine, and about 1/2 tsp double strength tomato paste. I cooked the onion and sausage first (the sausage I used was already cooked), adding garlic, bell pepper and other ingredients after. I simmered the sausage/vege mixture for about 1/2 hour partially covered to thicken. I added chopped fresh spinach just before I added the pasta so it wilted perfectly. I omitted the oregano and used thyme instead. I used bow tie pasta and crumbled feta cheese. Excellent! Will make again and again!

This is another one of those recipes I made without being aware I was doing it. I just stumbled across it here, but had already conjured the same thing up without the recipe. The Italian-Irish boyfriend says it's the best pasta he's had...and he's picky. It's a kitchen staple from now on...

The simplest most delicious sausage pasta recipe! Instead of canned tomatoes, I used a bottle of Barilla Three Cheese Pasta Sauce. Made a big difference. Either way, this recipe is brilliant.

Rating: 2
A little too greasy. Have used a similar recipe for some time which calls for cooking sweet sausages first and draining excess fat. The onions, garlic and peppers are sautéed in a small amount of olive oil and the sausages are added back with the diced tomatoes. adding fresh basil at the end brightens it up, with an overall effect which is less heavy.

Rating: 4
I've tried this with other sausages, but hot italian is definitely the way to go. I do not use very much oil ~ 1T for sauteeing the garlic and sausages. I do not drain the grease from the sausages - did once and it came out too bland. This is also likely why other cooks find the original recipe too greasy; it starts with too much oil and doesnt take sausage grease into account. The kids are big fans of this recipe, especially when I use regular bow-tie pasta. The whole wheat pastas do not compliment this dish very well: too chewy.

Rating: 2
This was good. I would give it 2 and one half if I could. There wasnt enough flavor in the sauce. Like other reviewers suggested I would definitely add the garlic later in the recipe and double the tomatoes. Next time I will add a little tomato sauce or paste to give it a more rounded tomato taste

Rating: 3
Wonderful and delicious comfort food. Also very easy to make but it is essential to follow the recommendation of other reviewers to cut down the grease. I used no olive oil at all. Just spray your pan with a little olive oil cooking spray, brown the sausage and then add the vegetables. I used a bit more garlic and a few grinds of red pepper. Very tasty and easy for a winter weeknight at home.

I make this frequently. I don't use the canned tomatoes, I use a 15 oz. can of Contadina Tomato Sauce with Herbs and it's just delicious.

I love this dish. It is delicious, EASY and (depending on the sausage you use) low fat. I use sundried tomato and basil chicken sausage from Trader Joe's. I keep them in the freezer and have thrown this together for unexpected guests with great success.

My boyfriend thought this was good. I thought it was just O.K. With 3 tablespoons of oil and Italian sausage, I thought it was too greasy. The 'sauce' was essentially oil. I tried this recipe to take advantage of fresh bellpeppers from the garden. If I make this again, I will follow the advice of other reviewers and use hot sausage, a 28 oz can of tomatoes and add the garlic after the sausage so it does not burn (as it eventually did for me.) If the garlic is added after the sausage, the 3 tablespoons of oil are unnecessary. In fact, I recommend pouring off the oil prior to adding the tomatoes and spices (unless using a dryer turkey or chicken sausage).

Simple and delicious-added a generous grating of Parmesan and used whole wheat rotini(very South Beach)with chili pepper sausages and apple chicken sausages together. Loved it.

I love this dish and make it several times over the course of the fall and winter. I agree that hot Italian sausage is key, and that adding the garlic after the sausage works better. In fact, I switch the timing on the garlic and onions altogether. It's also great with turkey Italian sausage and comes together quickly on a weeknight.

Good, basic recipe for weeknight dinners. My two year old and 5 year old both ate it without complaint.

Update on adding chicken...it needs something extra to spice it up. I added a splash of balsamic vinegar, whorchester sauce(sp?), white wine and a small can of tomato sauce (didn't have tomato paste). I think tomato paste would have done the trick. Next time I will use sweet italian turkey sausage instead. But, all in all it came out okay (two and a half forks).

I made this recipe last night with sweet italian sausage and all I can say is...Yummmm! It came out great and my boyfriend loved it. I am trying it again tonight, but this time I am using chicken to cut done on the fat factor. The taste tests are good so far.

Garlic tends to burn when added so early in the recipe. Next time I would add the garlic after the sausages have browned. Definitely needs more garlic and tomatoes. I also added a handful of fresh basil, and some fresh spinach. Tasty!

This recipe is wonderful! I searched everywhere before I finally found this recipe. It is just like at an authentic Italian restaurant in my city. If you want it more saucy it is good with an extra can of diced tomatoes too.

Wonderful sausage and pepper recipe. I add more garlic than the recipe calls for, a little fresh rosemary, and use the recipe required amount of tomatoes. At the end, I put grated mozzerella cheese on top of portions, replace the lid and let it melt. We eat it with crusty french bread for dipping and forget the pasta. Spicy Italian sausage is great with it.

Rating: 4
Excellent and easy with a few modifications: 1. I used a 28oz. can of crushed tomatoes instead of diced for a more "saucy" dish. 2. I doubled the garlic called for. 3. I used sweet Italian sausage for tender palates and set out crushed red pepper flakes for sprinkling for those who wanted a kick. I agree with a previous cook, you definitely need to find quality sausage for this dish. And by the way, turkey sausage works great. When the temp hits single digits, look no further for great comfort food.

I give this 3 forks, not because it's incredible, but because it is so quick and easy. It is the perfect dish to make when you're home late after swim team practice. It also lends itself to picky eaters in the family. By this last I mean that my 12-year-old son can easily pick out the sausages to eat and my husband can pick them out to not eat (don't take sausage out of the casings for this). Definitely use 28 oz. of diced tomatoes as other reviewers suggest, unless you want this dish to be primarily sausage. I used half sweet and half hot sausage since I'm cooking for kids, and that works well. Don't worry too much about watery nature of the sauce when it's simmering--you can always take off the lid and turn up the heat slightly. The excess liquid quickly disappears. One of the great things about this dish is that it can simmer longer while the family is yelled at to come to the table. In my house, that means something.

This is really really good. Quality HOT Italian sausage is the key here! No cheap stuff! I doubled the garlic and added a can and a half of tomoatoes as recommended by another reviwer. This is a very hearty MAN dish. Guys love it, my husband ate TONS of it! I enjoyed it too! Be sure to cook it longer than 8 minutes. I cooked mine for about 35 minutes. I will make this again!

Good recipe because it allowed me to use what I had on hand. I used a red, yellow, green, and orange pepper so it was nice and colorful. The only sausage I had was chorizo, which gave the dish a nice kick. Also, use 28oz. can of tomatoes and cooked the sauce down so it was nice and rich. Topped with romano cheese. The family like it.

I thoroughly enjoyed this delicious, quick & easy meal. I crumbled the sausage, used a red and a yellow pepper and added a dash or two of cayenne (having used mild sausage) and tossed it with bowtie pasta. It was great and I had everything on hand. A great weeknight meal! My husband and two small children enjoyed it too. I will definitely make this again!

Rating: 3
Wow. 3.5 Forks. I skipped the peppers, took a previous reviewer's suggestion to take the sausage out of the casing, de-greased? it with a slice of bread, and then added a couple splashes (or so) of sherry before adding onions. I think it would still be great without the sherry, but having it in was v. nice. Also tossed in some slices of fresh mushrooms. After simmering it covered about 15 minutes, opened and simmered a good long time (my sister called -- 30+ minutes?). This reduced the juices just the way I like! You know, I also added about a tablespoon of light brown sugar with the crumbled sausage, since I didn't realize I'd be simmering the tomatoes so long. Given the reduction of juices and/or since it was so delicious, it turns out to be more like 2 or 2-1/2 servings.

This receipe was very simple, and delicious. You can tweak it up a bit here and there with a few of your own additions. I added a tsp of sugar to cut the salt, and to sweeten it up a bit, it adds just a bit of extra flavor. This was a delicious recipe.

Very good. A nice variant would be to substitute Cajun sausage for the Italian and serve over white rice instead of pasta.

Not wonderful, not horrible. I felt the outcome was something you didn't really need a recipe for - just throw the ingredients together for a quick weeknight dinner. Guess that's all it's really supposed to be, anyway. I think it might be better if the sausage was taken out of the casing and crumbled into smaller pieces. Just a thought.

This was a tasty weeknight dinner, but nothing more than that. I followed the recipe exactly and added some red pepper flakes and extra garlic. I also used yellow onion and some red onion (all I had) and with yellow and red peppers and it gave the meal nice color. I liked this because it was lighter than several other sausage recipes that have cream in them. My husband liked it too, and I'll add it to my recipe box, but my 7 yr. old picky son would't touch it.

Rating: 3
Yum! Very quick and easy, and the end result was really flavourful. To lighten up this recipe a little (1 1/2 pounds of sausages seemed excessive for 4 people) I decreased the amount of sausage to 3/4 pound. I also increased the amount of peppers (using red, yellow and green peppers), added an extra half can of tomatoes, and added hot pepper flakes to add kick. For those curious, I used Our Compliments brand mild Italian sausage and it was perfect. I might try using turkey sausage next time. This recipe is a KEEPER!

This was very good. I added some tomato paste but am not sure it really needed it. Next time I'll try it without. Hot Italian sausage made the sauce nice and spicy. I made it early in the day and it reheated nicely at dinner time. I'll make this recipe again and again.

I made this to take it to a potluck one Friday night so I cooked it late the night before and heated it twice on the day of the dinner. The result - the sausage seemed to infuse the sauce with a hearty flavor that was missing the first time I cooked it. Cook the sauce a little longer, and add crushed red pepper flakes for a kick - easy, and a crowd pleaser!

I couldn't rate this recipe a dish beyond compare, however it is an excellent dish. I think that this dish appeals more to men than women. My husband rave about it and although I really enjoyed it, I can think of other Gourmet recipes I've enjoyed more. I too, drained the excess oil before adding the peppers and onions. Very easy and fast especially for a week-night dinner. Make exactly as written - you will be guaranteed a wonderful result!
