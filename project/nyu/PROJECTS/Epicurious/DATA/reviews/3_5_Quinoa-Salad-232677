such a good vegan recipe! i used 1cup (measured uncooked) quinoa plus a bag of frozen shelled edamame, grilled corn with the kernels sliced off the cob, diced white onion, diced cherry tomatoes, plus the dressing. i used approx 5 tbsp wine vinegar, 1-2 tbsp olive oil, 1-2 tbsp dijon mustard and salted and peppered to taste with a pinch of sugar. such a good topper for a green leaf salad!

This is a perfect alternative to pasta or rice dish. The key to this recipe is using it as a jumping off point for yummy inspiration. It is a great base and then you get to make it what you want. For example, this time I added some minced jalapeno for a little kick, fresh lemon juice, green onion, substituted pumpkin seeds for the sunflower seeds, etc. I might add chicken to the leftovers tonight! Play with what you've got in the cupboard. I'll definitely use this "base" recipe again to remind myself of how yummy this sweet, salty, tangy type of salad can be!

Changed my mind. It is better after sitting a day or two in the fridge. And after adding some rice vinegar. It definitely does not need as much oil as the recipe calls for - I found the result slimey and unpleasant, after only using half the dressing. Definitely do make the dressing separate and add to taste as the others suggest.

Meh. I was not impressed.

Just made this...so good! I tweaked it to a salad I had at a baby shower...substituted green beans for red pepper, cranberries for cherries, and almonds for sunflower seeds. I also grilled chicken and added to my personal bowl. Love the dressing light and refreshing-delish!! Definitely making again & again.

Just made this, eating it as I write review...I have been looking for a similar recipe that I had at a baby shower. I did tweak it:) 3/4 c. Quinoa 1/4c. green beans 1/4c. cranberries 1/4c slivered almonds I added grilled chicken to it as well. Love the dressing, light and refreshing- delish!

Really nice, easy quinoa recipe with lots of possibilities for substitions/additions. Used 2 cups quinoa, didn't have any bell peppers so used a leek and a small amount of garlic lightly sauteed together, then added to quinoa with onion and edamame. Didn't have cherries to add. Dressing is nice, light. Did 3x dressing for the amount of quinoa used. I'll make this again.

This is in my stack to make again and again. Very delicious and healthy. I used currants instead of cherries. They have a nice tart flavor that was very nice in this dish.

My favorite quinoa salad recipe. I quadruple it. You can substitute and tweak and it always turns out great. Add dressing in increments because it doesn't need it all.

For anyone who doesn't want to sacrifice great food for staying in shape, put this recipe in your box and use it all summer long! Quinoa and edamame (soy) are 2 of the 10 top ab-friendly foods, FYI. When I first read the ingredients I wasn't sure if it would all go together, but it was delicious. I quadrupled the recipe both times I made it (you're going to want leftovers), used red onion and ocean spray craisins. Add the dressing to taste because you don't need quite as much as it says.

I wanted to make a larger quanity: I used 1 cup red quinoa/2 cups vegetable broth and added 2 diced carrots (then cooked the quinoa.) After it cooled I added 1 cup shelled edamame, 1 TB chopped fresh thyme, 1/4 cup chopped red onion, about 2/3 - 1 cup dried cranberries, and about 1/2 cup sliced almonds. I also used my own homemade tarragon vinaigrette and salt & fresh pepper to taste. Delicious!

Good basic recipe to build on. I quadrupled it to have as a main dish, added feta cheese and walnuts because I had them on hand. Very tasty.

Not as tasty as I would have liked. I find that some of the Self recipes are low on flavor, but I plan to try this one again to find a way to make it work because Quinoa is so good for you!

I was really surprised how good this turned out! I used cranberries instead,and made 4X the food for 1X the dressing, and otherwise followed the recipe

Really good and easy. When it came time to deal with the leftovers, I mixed them with leftover wild rice and liked that even better with the additional texture and nutty flavor.

Quick and easy. Served with salmon roasted in the oven, and used some of the same flavors, (dijon mustard, olive oil, salt, pepper) to flavor the fish. It was a hit with my family.

I've made this recipe many times now, and multiplied it by 8, with triple the dressing, which is plenty. It's a bit on the bland side, but I still find it addictively delicious. I used dried crans instead of cherries, and red onion. Guests LOVED it, and not only requested the recipe but also that I make the same salad on their next visit!

This really is one of those "kitchen sink" recipes- I used the vinaigrette dressing but then basically used whatever I had available (onion, cherry tomato, edamame, frozen corn, golden raisins, basil...) with delicious results.

This is yummy and great as a light main dish. It's even better the next day! The balance of flavors and textures are wonderful. We also substitued dried cranberries for cherries.

Very nice. Loved the balance of flavors. I used dried cranberry instead of cherry, used red quinoa, and used scallion instead of straight onion. I quadrupled the recipe and left the dressing as written based on others' comments - perfect!

This recipe was nice! I used frozen edamame since that's all I had and cooked some raisins to plump them up and used those instead of cherries. I also added a tiny bit of curry powder to the dressing and used much less oil to lighten it p and to give it a little flare. Very good, very healthy. Also added a little bit of chopped pecans since I had those, too! Nice!

with many changes, this is good: 8x food, 3x the dressing. Didn't use red pepper (hate it), used a red onion, and added feta. Less sugar in the dressing. Yummy

Add corn if its in season, why not? And definately skip on the sugar; the dressing is sweet enough. I put in a lot more red pepper, edamame, onion and sunflower seeds than advised. Dried unsweetened tart cherries are a myth. The ones at Whole Foods are so sweet, but make for a great little bite in your quinoa salad. Took it on a Vegan outing to the lake and it was gone in less than 3 hours (i tripled the amounts).

I used this salad when I had to take a dish over to a neighbor's cocktail party with almost no notice. I made quinoa as a side dish two nights before so I had it on hand. I used my rice steamer to make quinoa and used a bit of olive oil, sliced garlic and chicken broth to steam it. I made the salad as written, except I didn't use the onion and I added a chiffonade of fresh oregano and basil to the quinoa. I then used a small ice cream scooper (probably 1 ounce) and placed a ball of the salad in the base of individual leaves of Belgian endive. The bitter leaves were a good compliment to the sweet(ish) salad. I sprinkled the tops with chopped parlsey and more sunflower seeds. It was really good. I also don't give 4 forks to anything but the absolute best recipes (few and far between).

Excellent. This is in regular rotation in our house. Lots of flavour, texture and excellent as I'm trying to loose weight too. I love it just as it is, but it adapts well to what ever ingredients I have in the cupboards. I do love the cherries though.

I liked this recipe a lot. It's the fist time I cook quinoa, and I was pleasantly surprised. Made a couple of changes - dropped the onion (don't like raw onions) and put dried cranberries instead of cherries. Topped with alfalfa sprouts and sesame seeds (allergic to sunflower seeds). It turned out nice, light and fresh on a summer evening.

Great! Simple and tasty, with good textures. I substituted chopped dried apricots for the red pepper and added pine nuts. Love this with the edamame! Thanks for something so simple and good!

Yum. I added a bit of hot sauce, which I add to almost everything, but this was wonderful! A really satisfying, but not heavy salad. Quinoa rocks!

Rating: 3
This salad is lovely but I found it way too sweet. This could be because I used dried cherries that weren't "tart". I made six times the recipe because I was making it for a party, and found that using half the dressing was more than enough. Otherwise, though, the salad was very well recieved.

Delish! I substituted fresh chopped spinach for the edamame and dried cranberries for the dried cherries. I also added some toated pine nuts! It was quick and easy and tastes great! Would definitely make again.

This salad is delicious. I substituted dried cranberries. I will certainly serve this again.
