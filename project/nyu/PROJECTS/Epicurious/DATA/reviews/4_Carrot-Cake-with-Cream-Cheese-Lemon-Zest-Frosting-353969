Delicious!!! I followed others and strained the carrot/pineapple mixture - added the fresh ginger at that time - wanted to make sure it was mixed in well. I also split the two layers into 4 - so the icing amount worked out really well (yes, that icing is the perfect complement to this cake)! I like a really moist carrot cake and this was superb!!

I made this yesterday for my very picky spouse's birthday (he won't order carrot cake at restaurants because he doubts it can possibly be as good as one made several years ago by a friend). This cake with the lemon-zest frosting is now the new gold standard by which all others will be judged. I followed the recipe exactly since it was my first time making it. Perfection.

Perfect! Used all purpose flour for the whole recipe but otherwise followed exactly.

I used some organic, some not. Added all of the optional ingredients. The cake and frosting were DELICIOUS and moist!!!!! But, admittedly, I am a frosting addict, and even I think the frosting recipe made a lot of frosting...more than you will need for this cake...it was yummy frosting though ; )

I loved this recipe and it will be the only carrot cake recipe I will ever use. I must say it is so helpful to read the reviews in advance--I learn so much from other cooks. I used a mixture of organic and non-organic products and it turned out great. As other cooks suggested, I drained the carrot and pineapple mixture a bit-the cake was wonderfully moist without being soggy. I watched my mixing time on the frosting, as others suggested, and it was perfect. Huge hit with my husband who is already eating his second piece of the day and it's only breakfast time!

Just used regular everything, not organic and it came out wonderful!! Very moist, delicious without being too sweet. Made double the recipe for a huge birthday cake. Some Carrot Cake lovers said it was the best they ever had! Will make again and again. Making it for Easter too.

This is great carrot cake, we loved this!! I didn't have any issues with it being too moist but I used fresh pinapple verses canned. This got rave reviews and we loved the icing too.

sorry I did not like it, the taste is good, but I'm looking for a more spongy cake

I didn't add the brown sugar and used 1/4 c oil & 1/2 c applesauce. Added macadamia nuts, raisins and crystalized ginger.

I am sad to say that this cake was just fine; it's got great texture, it's moist, and it's pretty bland. I did make a few changes, but not ones that seem likely to affect the taste much. I skipped the coconut because my kids hate it and can detect it in anything. I used cake flour for the pastry flour. I used a 9x9 cake pan instead of 2 round pans. Maybe I should have put in ginger. In any event, the frosting was delish -- I used tangerine for the lemon (both peel and juice) because I was out of lemons.

This is the best carrot cake I've made or had. I make it as written (except I don't use all organic ingredients), and it has always come out wonderfully. The frosting recipe makes way too much - I cut it by a third and that makes plenty.

This is going in the family birthday cake recipe box. It's AMAZING. I doubled the fresh ginger, didn't soak the coconut and added about a 1/2 TBSP candied ginger, finely chopped. I also added a little bit of ginger to the icing, just a touch, with a few pieces of finely chopped candied ginger, as well, for a nice little surprise. The icing was so amazing I ate it straight for days (I'm a heavy icer and it still made a lot of icing.) OINK! I'm making it again tomorrow for my sister's birthday. Can't wait!

I tried this cake due to the rave reviews is got but was not impressed by the results. Since so many reviewers claimed it was the BEST carrot cake ever I am going to blame it on the baker and not the recipe!!! I followed the recipe to a "t" but wasn't impressed with the soggy texture. Can't really figure out where I went wrong but if you are trying this cake I would recommend following the advice of other reviewers and strain the extra liquid from the carrot-pineapple mixture. Worst thing I have baked in years!!! Oh well!

I made this cake for my boyfriend's birthday and everyone LOVED it! The pineapple, coconut, fresh carrot mixture makes for a deliciously chunky sweet combination. Grab a helper and bake this NOW!

INCREDIBLE! Everyone who had it said it was the BEST CARROT CAKE they've ever had. Restaurant quality...very easy to make. I only baked them for 45 minutes and put the pineapple and carrots in the strainer after I popped them in the food processor to drain a little of the excess juice. I also doubled the lemon zest in the icing and put half again as much fresh ginger. LOVE IT!! Oh and this was my first time making carrot cake ever! This is now my staple carrot cake recipe... Thank you Epicurious!

To sarahamb from Toronto, you probably over-beat your frosting. Cream cheese frosting can go from being the perfect texture to super runny in seconds. You have to stop beating as soon as you think it's the right texture for spreading. This carrot cake is a go-to for me! When I make it as cupcakes I add pepitas in place of other nuts and flax seeds for a little crunch. Makes them have a sliiiightly higher nutritional value.

Best carrot cake recipe! I made mini cupcakes and they turned out moist and delicious. Really an expceptional recipe. Frosting was great too.

Rating: 4
I made cupcakes with these and they turned out great at the 35 min bake time. I did however only get 18 cupcakes, not 24. I filled the pan almost to the top so maybe that was why. To the cook from NY who had a mushy result - I put the carrots and the pineapple in the food processor, and there was a lot of extra liquid from pureeing them - I did not add that liquid to the cake but poured it off (it was about 1/2 cup) - this might help. Also, I added the ginger which I think made it taste much better - I wouldn't skip it. I did make one alteration and that was to cut the sugar with stevia powder - I subbed 1 c. sugar for 2 tbsp. stevia (added the other sugars as directed - if you use too much stevia, it ends up tasting weird.) For the frosting, I was trying to be more healthy so I used Neufchâtel cheese instead of cream cheese because it has less fat/calories. It turned out great, and I will deff make it again. When I make these next time, I am going to try to cut the oil with some applesauce or fruit puree - the oil in this recipe is almost 1450 calories! Yikes! I am thinking of halving the oil and adding 1 c. of applesauce instead. Has anyone tried this?

The cake turned out really yummy (even though I forgot the coconut... oops!); it was moist, dense and so tasty. The frosting, however, was a COMPLETE DISASTER! I don't know how nobody else had issues with it, but mine came out very runny, even after adding an extra 1/2 cup of sugar and refrigerating it for 2 hours. Frosted, the cake completely fell apart. The recipe also made waaay too much frosting. I would try this recipe one more time, just because it's been so well-reviewed but I would reduce the frosting by at least 1/3.

I doubled the coconut & ginger quantities, and did not soak the coconut. This cake is truly outstanding. The texture is light and robust at the same time. I love this with the lemon cream cheese frosting. Minted cream cheese frosting (same recipe, just chopped mint instead of lemon zest & juice) is also a lovely taste combo for this cake.

Wow....This is the best carrot cake I have ever had...unbelievable....it didn't turn out soggy like some of the reviewers complained....I didn't soak the coconut....I also didn't use organic ingredients...I didn't have any...but I did put in all the add-ins...so the ginger, raisins and the walnuts....I was too lazy to make the frosting and I don't like frosting anyways...so I ate like it was with a glass of milk. I am convinced that a better carrot cake recipe doe not exist!

I found this recipe to be absolutely delicious. I made cupcakes and they turned out wonderfully. Also used vegan cream cheese for the icing instead of regular because one of the people I made it for was lactose intolerant. It was suprisingly yummy. Definitely recommend this recipe. It's easy, fun to make and tasty.

This cake turned out AMAZING! I did do a lot of alterations though. I put in 1/2 cup pineapple, only one cup of cane sugar and a little less oil than called for. It turned out very moist, balanced flavor and just the right amount of sweet. I also cut the frosting recipe to have 2 packages of cream cheese and 1 1/2 cup of powdered sugar. It was sweet but not too sweet where you can only have 1/2 a slice. YUM!

Absolutely THE BEST Carrot Cake Recipe!! I've made this numerous times & now it is the #1 request for any parties in my family. It definitely needs to cook longer than what is specified. I usually do about 50 min & it is still very moist. This is definitely a keeper!

Making carrot cake probably for the very first time might be frustrating but then again, lessons are learned :) Talking from experience by the way :) I am part vegetarian- fruitarian person and this cake is a combination of fruit for the icing part and batter for the vegetable part. Had to decrease the cream cheese though :) Amazing :) Thank you for sharing this recipe :)

This cake was delicious. I made the lemon cream cheese frosting without the butter. For cooks whose cake came out too soggy- overbake a tad and then let the cake sit uncovered until cool. The cupcakes worked well because they tended to dry out more to a moist perfection. Fill the cupcake cups almost to the brim. The sweetness was just right.

I modified the steps (simplified actually)in making this cake. Do not soak the coconut-it loses flavor and you don't want to add more liquid to the cake. I also began with beating the oil, eggs and sugar together, until light, then added the carrots and pineapple, and then the dry ingredients. I used a natural brown sugar with the molasses in it. It is a very wet batter, and it worked perfectly as cupcakes,which could be filled with batter almost to the top.

This cake was not good. It was overly moist almost to the point of being soggy. The nut and raisin mixture made the cake not hold together properly. The cake also had a distinct pineapple taste which completely overwhelmed the carrot cake flavor. This was not a carrot cake. It was a huge nut filled, pineapple tasting mess.

This is the best carrot cake recipe I've ever made. The ginger is a must, though, and not optional (unless you really hate good food). I used a full Tablespoon of crystallized ginger. It does take awhile to bake, so be prepared.

Excellent, moist cake. I made this for my book club last week and they LOVED it. I took some advice from other reviewers and shredded the carrots using a hand grater first, then put the carrots and fresh pineapple in the food processor to cut to really small pieces. Also, I wanted really lemony icing, so I added more fresh lemon juice. Truly a fabulous recipe. I am making it again this weekend for another get-together.

I forgot to put the parchment - big mistake. The cake stuck to the pans, even as I put plenty of butter/flour. I am aware though that this is a common occurrence with carrot cake, so take extra precaution and don't omit the paper! That said, this is by far the best carrot cake I ever tasted. It was moist and the coconut and pineapple added extra interest to it. And the lemon frosting is to-die for (I halved the amount stated on the recipe and it was enough) . Highly recommended.

Excellent carrot cake! Very moist and has a balanced sweetness. The frosting is equally as good. This will be my go-to carrot cake recipe.

This is great! Use the walnuts, I think the carrots might be better if you grate them instead of put them in the food processor.

I love this cake, have made it twice. Second time used only 2 tubs of cream cheese instead of 3, and it was still plenty.

I'm giving this two stars because I didn't like it at all but my boyfriend loved it. It turned out to be very dense and moist, and I personally prefer a drier cake. I'm not the biggest fan of carrot cake anyway, but I really didn't think this had enough flavor. The frosting was fantastic, though!

This cake turned out amazing! The best cake I have made yet. It was moist, rose well, and definitely delicious. Everyone loved it. I will say that although the recipe for the icing says it yields 4 1/2 cups of icing, I ended up with entire BOWL of icing, more than enough to ice two cakes! Just means I have to make another cake :)

Very good, an excelent dense texture. I was a little short on carrots so I added some gratted zucchini to make up the difference which worked out just fine.

this is unbelievably awesome - my daughter made it for a 4th of July party and every guest was raving about it. The best of all is that it is very flavorful, but not as sweet as the typical carrot cake, especially the icing. No need to ever make another carrot cake recipe - this is the best!
