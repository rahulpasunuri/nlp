We were craving raw vegetables after weeks of holiday fare...and this recipe was perfect! We used broccoli instead of cauliflower and added Piquillo peppers, otherwise we followed the recipe exactly as written. Beautiful salad that is great for company.

What a vegetable this is. I love how versatile cauliflower is. Marinating it is now my most favorite method of preparing it. I love your recipe and am looking forward trying it later this week (I have 3 heads of cauliflower waiting for me at home.) Would you like to take a look at my marinated cauliflower salad recipe? cuceesprouts.com/2010/09/marinated-cauliflower-salad/

Every time I have made this, it is a hit! The marinade itself is great for any veg. I mix it up and have fun with whatever veggies I have on hand.

This was a big hit at my October book club dinner featuring fall foods. This is a strong flavored salad, but if you like Kalamata olives, you will love this recipe. I used spring mix salad instead of the arugula to add color,

Made this for Thanksgiving 3 years ago - guests raved about it and asked about it every year. Usually I try to do new dishes, but I'm caving and doing it again, because it really was delish. I use Olive Oil instead of Canola Oil.

I made this for a group potluck; the marinade was too sharp-tasting, especially paired with Kalamata olives. I don't know why I was expecting anything really special, as the ingredients are often used together, but I had all the ingredients on hand to start the marinade the night before, and that was my main reason for choosing this salad. It wasn't bad, but there are more interesting recipes out there.

The marinade as written seemed to give an overpowering vinegar taste. We added a little sugar to conteract the vinegar and a little dill to liven it up a bit. But still it was enjoyable with pasta and I'm sure we'll make it again.

This is a very good salad! I used spinach instead of arugula. My family, who thinks of salad as "lettuce" of some sort, really liked it!! I made it for Thanksgiving and will propably make it for Christmas dinner as well.

I am known for making exceptional salads. This salad will certainly stay on my list. The unusual combination of ingredients was delicious and drew rave reviews from some of my culinary peers.
