Loved it! Very delicate flavor. I didn't have smoked almonds so I add smoked paprika to the mixture and it came out great. definitely a keeper!

I made this last year at our holiday dinner and it was a huge hit. Definitely making it again this year!

I thought this was absolutely foul. It is probably the worst thing I have ever made from Epicurious. If I could I would have given this 0 forks. And I wouldn't make it again -- my regular salad with figs is waaaayyyyy better than this.

Great Recipe. I halved the recipe, used artisan lettuce instead of arugula, used sliced pear instead of fresh figs (out of season), the ricotta and cream was easy to make. Guests loved it

This is a lot of work but really good. I baked the prosciutto and used goat cheese instead of ricotta.
