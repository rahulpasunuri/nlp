My Girlfriend and I loved this with Red Snapper. I agree with the wine sauce reduction. I placed the Fish over Smashed Red Potatoes which picked up well with the sauce.

I see many recipes tried that aren't as written so I'm going to add mine. I used skinned fillets caught way out off Neah Bay here in Washington by a friend. The herbs I used were fresh parsley, dried dill, and a small amount of minced onion since these were what I had on hand. I think fresh dill would have been better. I started with the onion in the pan before deglazing. I used grapefruit juice instead of lemon and the sauce turned out very tasty. I decided to serve the fish on top of polenta (made with a good lump of butter and enough salt to make it great on its own) and then added a few spoonfuls of sauce and then grated parmesan over all. The creamy polenta with the flavorful fish and just the right amount of flavor from the sauce was a terrific combination. I will make this again!

Read the other reviews and so reduced the wine. I also used dried herbs apart from Parsley which I have growing on the windowsill. I skinned the fish because that's how my diners prefer it and added garlic - was rated a success (I'm veggie so didn't try it myself but it looked good).

had black sea bass 1 hr old! caught in the Chesapeake Bay where I live (it must be the secret). also reduced the wine ( a must). used twice as much butter in the sauce and in the end added lump blue crab meat to sauce. WOW!! Try it!

How can you complain about this! Okay, I modified a little, used dry herbs and chicken broth- lime instead of lemon, added cumin seeds.. okay, so maybe I created something completely differnent.. but YUMMMMMMMM and EASY!!!!!!! For the effort, it kicks butt.

The fish was delicious and the sauce a perfect accompaniment. The texture of the fish was perfect - crispy on the outside, light and delicate inside. Letting the wine boil down a little while deglazing the pan will avoid a sauce that's too watery.

Sorry to disagree with most of the respondents, but this recipe was disappointing. The sea bass was delicious, but the sauce was too watery and thin. When I poured it over the fish, it looked drowned in watery soup, while the sodden herbs clung to the fish. Not the elegant presentation I had hoped for. Tasted good, but I'd never make it again. There are too many better recipes out there for sea bass.

This dish simply melts in your mouth-- by far the best fish recipe I've tried to date. It has just the right blend of herbs. I make this dish for friends and every time I receive rave reviews!

Best treatment of Sea Bass I've ever had! The dill flavour really compliments the fish.

This recipe is great. It's simple, quick, and can be used with so many different types of fish. I actually substituted dry spices and cut back on the amount. I also found that this was delicious with halibut. I would think that it would be great with any sort of white fish.

Simply delicious. Easy to prepare and perfect as it is. I accompanied it with small red creamer potatoes and seared baby bok choy. yum.

I loved this recipe for its elegance and simplicity, andmy wife or I made it several times. We used line-caught sea bass from the market in Ferney-Voltaire, France. The sublimely fresh fish in this recipe needs only the herbs and wine to make it truly delicious. I've used the searing technique with other fish. Now I plan to try it in South Africa, but I haven't figured out which fish to use. Any ideas?

The sauce was really good, but I think the problem with the recipe was that I didn't care for the way the sea bass turned out. I'd consider using a variation of the sauce on grilled or broiled sea bass.
