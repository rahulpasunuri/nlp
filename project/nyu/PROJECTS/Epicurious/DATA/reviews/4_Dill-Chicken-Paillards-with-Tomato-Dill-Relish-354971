Exceptional is a hard score to give any recipe, however, this was very, very, good. I did not use dill, I used about a tablespoon of thytme and a tsp of dried italian seasoning - that is what I had on hand. Tasty!

This was great, although I thought the dill was a tad overpowering. I followed suggestions of reviewers, who marinated the chicken beforehand, and I think if I were to do it again, I'd skip the marinating. I would also play with other herbs as other reviewers suggested. The relish was fantastic though, and could work a perfect complement to a range of meats -- the fresher and sweeter the tomatoes you can find, the better.

We love the tomato sauce. We have made the sauce for other recipes and even as a salad.

It is so quick to make and so delicious. When dill is not available, I used the squeeze tub variety. It works perfectly.

This is a real good meal! I used regular mustard with a touch of Dijon mustard instead of the grainy and used dried dill but will use fresh next time.

This recipe is SO good! I use chicken thighs because I prefer dark meat. For the tomato relish I also like to add lightly steamed asparagus for more of a salad effect. I've made this recipe almost once a week for a month.

Excellent- chicken was a little dry, but relish was amazing. So easy.

This was excellent for the whole family and super easy. MY child who doesn't like tomatoes simply did without the relish. The rest of us ate it up! I wouldn't change a thing.

I make this all the time -- everyon eloves it. Sometimes I cook or grill or roast the tomatoes beforehand for more flavour. Guests have always commented on this delicious dish.

This recipe was extremely easy and quick to make. I might have "tenderized" the chicken too much, but it still tasted fantastic. I am a big fan of dill and was worried that the amount of dill called for in this recipe would be too much, but it was perfect. Since I couldn't use my grill I cooked these in a hot grill pan and it still came out fantastic.

Very good and easy, but I would have preferred a bit more flavor. Maybe next time I'll use a combination of shallots and garlic, make double the relish, marinate the chicken in half the relish for an hour or so reserving the other half for serving and add the tomatoes at the end.

This was really simple and quite tasty - delicous and pretty for spring. I used baby heirlooms.

Delicious! The tomato-dill relish (salad, really)is wonderful the next day too. The combination of dill, shallots, and grainy mustard is terrific on both chicken and tomatoes.

Yummy. Love the dill flavor. The combination with the tomato relish is wonderful. Kids even liked it. This one is a keeper.

Deeeelicious! Quick and very easy. I substituted Quorn cutlets (fake chicken) which I sauteed in olive oil. My boyfriend said (unsolicited) after the first bite "This is a keeper. I can't wait to have it again!"

Love it! I don't have a grill so I baked the chicken at 350 for 35-40 mins. For the tomatoes I drizzled olive oil over them and placed under the broiler for a few minutes. Delicious!

Not as good as it sounded. I was really craving a strong dill taste, but it just wasn't there. I definitely think marinating the chicken breasts for at least an hour would help.

this is so EASY and so GOOD. Quick and flavorful, great weeknight dinner.

this was such a hit at my recent late-summer dinner party. The only thing that I changed was that I used heirloom cherry tomatoes and it was such a pretty (and tasty) dish!

My husband made this for my birthday dinner and it was wonderful. He, too, used grape tomatoes. I can't wait to have it again!

This is such a simple dish that you wouldn't expect much, but it was absolutely delicious.

I'm not that crazy about dill, so I've done this with tarragon and also with basil, both EXCELLENT! Tiny sweet "grape" tomatoes (cut in half, as a previous reviewer suggested) worked beautifully, as would medium-diced beefsteak tomatoes.

I thought this would be plain, but it wasn't - it was delicious and so easy. Actually marinated the chicken for a few hours, and tossed together the tomato mixture, since I knew I would be squeezed for time in the evening, and that worked great.

We doubled the recipe and rather than grilling, we broiled the chicken breasts oh hi close to the flame for 4 minutes on one side and 1 minute on the other. We also cut the cherry tomatoes in half. The chicken came out great, tender and juicy, the tomato relish was perfect. The sweetness of the tomato, the earthiness of the dill and the tangy was complimented the chicken very well!

Excellent! Very tender. Wouldn't make one change. Also, try "relish" on grilled halibut. My sister even ate it and she asked me for the recipe and she only eats air.
