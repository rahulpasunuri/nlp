These were delicious, but I have deducted a fork as I don't think the mixture made a true shortcake, this was more like a cross between a shortcake and a scone. I made the spiced plums which went with them lovely but I did add more spice than the recipe called for and was very glad that I did as it was still quite mildly spiced and had I used the stated quantities I don't think that it would have had enough flavour.

I used different fruit on top, but I would like to try the plum resipe too. These were really great shortcakes/scones! Mine came out beautifully and were delicious. Everyone wanted more, even without the fruit and whipped cream!

I've wanted to make this for years, and I'm glad I kept it in mind. I made the shortcake and whipped cream portions only, and they were even better than I excepcted. I used a food processor to cut in the butter (5 one sec pulses) but otherwise followed directions. Used peaches sauted with frozen, sweetened raspberries and rose wine.

These are the best! I have made them for my family many times and everyone loves them. My step mom wanted the recipe to make up just like scones, which they are. I agree that cream works well in the recipe. I haven't used the plums, yet, but the shortcakes go great with strawberries.

A few seconds processing for the oats alone before adding the other dry ingredients lightens the cakes a bit; but the main reason for dry cakes is overworking the dough after the milk is added. Whipping cream substituted for the milk for does wonders.

These shortcakes were fabulous. Even my husband who does not usually care for shortcake loved them. I did not make the plums but instead filled them with blueberries and strawberries. I had no problem with the temperature. I may have taken them out early. I just went by how they looked.

I found the shortcake dry and a little too dense; sort of like a scone, but less flakey than the best scones. Baked them at 400 instead of 425 due to others comments and got no burns.

This is the shortcake recipe I've been searching for my entire life! I threw all the dry ingredients in my Kitchen-Aid and blended with the paddle while I dropped in cubes of cold butter. It was done in a snap and baked beautifully. I had no problem with the time or temperature--they were done on the stroke of 20 minutes. I use Air-Bake cookie sheets (which always give some extra time for the bottoms) and position the rack a little below middle. I've pre-measured dry ingredients for 4 batches into 1-quart Ziploc bags because strawberry season is upon us. Wonderful!!

I made this recipe based on the reviews. I baked it at 425 like the recipe says butr only for 18 or 19 minutes. The cakes were like biscotti and burned around the edges. They made great frisbees. My guess is that the temp should have read 325 instead of 425. maybe they taste great if the temp or the time is correct but this is definitely out of kilter.

GREAT shortcakes! I did not make the plum filling, but the shortcakes themselves were exquisite! I used yellow and white nectarines, and strawberries, sliced and sugared. We topped this with whipped cream and decided that shortcake doesn't get any better. Perhaps the previous reviewer's problem with baking the shortcakes came from using the convection oven. It simply cooks faster.

This is an A-1 shortcake but I am surprised that noone has mentioned the high temperature of 425 degrees for 20 minutes. I checked mine at 8 minutes and they were burnt on the bottom. I have a new convection oven that has not let me down. Anyone else encounter this. I looked a long time for a moist textured shortcake...this is it. Do try them.

I made just the shortcakes, and they were very good. To cut down on fat I substituted about 1/3 cup mashed banana for as much butter. This left the cakes tasting a bit like banana bread, which was not a bad thing though.

This was divine! I have been searching for the perfect shortcake and this is it! I agree with Joanne that these will go with any fruit any time...and yes, they are wonderful as scones for breakfast! Quick and easy, too...what more could you ask for in a recipe?

I've made this recipe at least two dozen times and I felt I had to add my two cents ... These shortcakes are very versatile. They are easy to make and wonderful with strawberries, boysenberries, peaches or plums. My family's favorite is strawberry shortcake. The shortcakes keep very well in a plastic bag and can be warmed as a breakfast bread, that is, if you have any left. They remind me of an oatmeal scone. Wow, you have to try these. Note: I use my food processor to blend the flour and butter. Makes it fast and easy.

I used Damson Plums as they are the only ones currently available from our trees. They are tart so I doubled the sugar. So good that I'm going to preserve a couple of pints for winter use with the shortcake.

I only made the shortcakes and they were wonderful. The oatmeal is a nice addition. the plum filling looks tastey but I chose to use fresh peaches.
