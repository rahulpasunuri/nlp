I used the zest of one orange, super fine sugar instead of the honey and added a couple splashes of Grand Marnier. It was fantastic and will now be a holiday staple.

This is the most enjoyable holiday cranberry anything I've ever tasted and so easy to make. Whips up in minutes. I added a bit more honey to suit my taste. I would call this more of a salsa if anything.

No need to cook the cranberries, just prepare exactly as directed in the recipe. This sauce is excellent and will convince people who thought they didn't like cranberry sauce because of their canned sauce experiences to change their mind. Really great in a panini with leftovers, or turkey ravioli if you want to get fancy.

I don't get it... do you cook the cranberries?

This sauce was easy and delicious. My husband's family is very suspicious of new things on the Thanksgiving table and they loved it. Next time I'll use a lighter color honey (orange blossom would have been perfect)with more subtle flavor, though.

Oops. My review went with "Fresh Orange-Cranberry Sauce with Walnuts." Sorry! I've tried this recipe, too, (the one I'm actually reviewing now), but the oranges got bitter. We much prefer the sauce with walnuts... take a look!

Everyone really liked this! The most frequent comment was that the orange flavor is an unexpected and welcome change. Because I have had bad luck before with cooking zest too long and a resulting bitter taste, I waited to put the zest in with the orange pieces. Don't skimp with the walnuts, and make sure to toast them well -- it brings out the flavor like you wouldn't believe. This will definitely be a repeat with our turkey dishes!

This is a family favorite. I prepared it for the first time a few years ago and finally managed to break them of the jelled cranberry-in-a-can rut. Very tasty.

Sometimes you can't tell if cranberry sauce is homemade. This sauce is very fresh tasting, especially with the oranges.

This is a fabulous recipe...nothing beats fresh cranberries and oranges in a sauce on the Thanksgiving table! I have been making this recipe since 1996 and will continue to do so every year as it has become a staple.

Make it every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas. My family practically demands it.

Very easy to make and tastes great. More of a relish than sauce, but was a crowd pleaser.
