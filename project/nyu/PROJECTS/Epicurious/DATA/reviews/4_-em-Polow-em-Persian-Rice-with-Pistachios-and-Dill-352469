I did not make this recipe, so am not rating it. I am an enthusiast of Persian cuisine, and noticed in the video that the chef could not even pronounce the Persian food terms correctly. I was highly suspect of the quality of a dish that the chef doesn't bother to properly pronounce, and this has been confirmed by other Persian reviewers who say this recipe is not authentic and weird.

This came out very good. I got just a little bit of crust (maybe because of electric stove), but the flavors were delicious. I will sub peas for the pistachos next time, because they got soggy.

It is not a Persian dish at all!!! rice, pistachios and dill???.... It looks like a joke to me!!! we never make polow like this!! I think it is better to search internet before publishing these kind of fake foods!! You just have one Persian food in your site and thats not the real one!

My only variation to the recipe came as a suggestion from Farhadf (see below) where I ditched the parchment paper and used a kitchen towel between the lid and the pan to absorb the steam. I also started out at 15 min on med-low than turned the rice down to the lowest setting for 40 minutes. My tahdig was perfect. A fantastic recipe!!

I cheated and made this in a rice cooker, without the dill, and only adding yogurt at the end (because some of my guests don't do dairy in combo with meat, which was my main dish). It was great, and I even got more crusting than I expected, though not as much, I'm sure, as if you've prepared it the way it should be done. The flavors are nice even with out the crusting, though.

Didn't have pistachios or dill but otherwise followed the recipe and absolutely loved it. Would recommend a higher heat for the 20 minutes that you're forming the 'crust'...I found after following the instructions that I had to crank up at the heat and let the bottom caramelize for 10 extra minutes. I'd also suggest using a REALLY large bowl to cool the pan off in I didn't get one large enough so it made getting the rice out more difficult. It didn't come out in one piece but I scored it and then used a spatula to get 6 large chunks out which I then served atop the beautifully steamed, aromatic rice. Everyone LOVED this dish. I highly recommend it.

It is not appreciated that this recipe insinuates that the meaning of Polow is rice with pistachios. Polow just means rice that is cooked...... not necessarily with pistachios and dill. Tahdig cooked in a coat of yougurt seems completely ridiculous to me. The recipe sucks and so does the careless manner in which the creator chose to respresent it; what a rude and inept immitation of a cuisine that encompases the use of very fine flavors.

When somewhat doctored (as per advice below) this is a pretty OK recipe - but I wouldn't bother. Though it's kind of a hassle, I much prefer:"Persian Rice with Pistachios and Dill (Gourmet|May 2001) which is REALLY really good - I'm just trying to figure out an easier (and safer!) way to make it!

I've had polow at a middle eastern restaurant here in town and loved it, so I was excited to see this recipe. Unfortunately this is awful. Although the taste was almost what I expected, the texture was like sticky mush. A spectacular failure, expensive too.

I could not decide if I should laugh or cry when I was watching the video for this recipe. I am an experienced cook and also an Iranian American. There were so many things wrong with the way this woman made this dish that I lost count! Let's just say there was not anything that was correct about this. Iranian cooks take pride in making rice the traditional way, which in no way is this recipe. Please oh please when representing a dish from another country and calling it the "national dish", check your facts and your recipe. The end result maybe fine in this case, but please do not call it the Persian national dish, because it isnt. This recipe is completely wrong. Let's just start by saying; it needs butter added to the saffron water and a pot that fits! A lid should be placed on the pot and not a piece of sad parchment paper! This is important for the steaming process. I could go on and on...

Somebody made this recipe too complicated. I'm not Iranian, but I do have a lot of Persian friends that insist that I cook the rice instead of them at dinner invitations. Cut the recipe in half. Boil the rice with 1/4 cube of unsalted butter and salt. When the rice and water are still bubbling lower the heat to medium low and stir in the saffron. Wait 1 minute and fold in the rest of the ingredients. Lower the heat to as low as your burner will go and move your teflon coated 6 or 8 inch pot to the 12:00 o'clock position over the heat with the lid on. Set the timer for 12 minutes. move the pot to the 9:00 o'clock position over the low heat for 12:00 more minutes. Repeat this operation for the 6:00, 9:00, and center position. Scrape the crunchy bottom with the rest of the rice and serve to everyone.

I'm Persian and have never seen the "tahdig" (crusty layer) form in 20 minutes. The other reviewer is right - you need to keep the temp up at medium low for about 15 minutes (depending on range & thickness of pot), then turn to very low for 45 minutes or more. Also, instead of parchment paper, you want to wrap a towel around the lid and fit that over the pot - the towel absorbs the steam and makes the rice more flaky

I did not make this recipe but have made albalu polow (rice with sour cherries and saffron) which uses the same principles for preparation. In making the albalu polow, I found that making over 2 cups of rice lessens your chances of achieving that wonderful crust. Also, the butter must be melted at high heat, the rice layered, and then kept at high heat for a bit to achieve the crust. I chose not to follow the pyramid shape because it meant less crust. Finally, I experience the blotches from the saffron pour and it helped to mix the top a little to make it look more attractive. Don't mess with that crust though. Good luck to others.

I followed the directions precisely and used all organic ingredients. It is extremely tasty. However, I gave this 3 forks instead of 4 because I was disappointed that a crust did not form at all after 20 minutes. Apparently the only way to know if this happened is to unmold the rice and be disappointed. Also, the saffron formed ugly blotches where it was poured into the holes, so the entire dish looked quite unattractive. I'll try again. PS the leftovers were very good next night with ...enchiladas suizas!
