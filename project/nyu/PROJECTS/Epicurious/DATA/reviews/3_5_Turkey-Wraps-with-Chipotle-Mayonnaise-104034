The chipotle mayo is a keeper. I left out the lettuce (didn't have any on hand) and added provolone, avocado, crumbled bacon, cherry tomatoes, red pepper and alfalfa sprouts to my mine - delish!

Yummy! I followed the recipe closely only substituting miracle whip light for mayo. It does have a good kick so you may want to adjust with chilies. I added tomatoes, swiss and wholly quacamole to help balance the mayo. Delish, I am going to make for party cut up in smaller sizes. Definite keeper.

The best part of this, as mentioned by other reviewers is the Chipotle Mayonnaise. Definitely take others' advice and add avocado, peppers, sprouts, pepper jack etc. to your wraps for some flair. We will be using this aioli on many many future sandwiches!

I loved this, but my husband thought the mayo was just a bit too spicey for his taste. Next time, we'll cut back the chipotles just a bit. I used grilled chicken breasts instead of the smoked turkey, and that worked fine. This mayo can be used in so many different things - a keeper for sure!

I should have read the reviews before I prepared these. I think an avocado and red pepper or tomato would have helped. The wraps were good, but not extraordinary.

Only made the dressing, (so far), but it was fabulous on my Spicy Chipotle Turkey Burgers! I think next time I may use plain yogurt instead of mayo, the mayo was a little too rich for my taste! But, the flavor is amazing! I plan to use this dressing on MANY things to come!

Really, it's the chipotle mayo that makes this wrap a hit. Made as is last week and it was delicious. Yesterday, we had a couple of vegetarians visiting, so I made this with tofu "turkey" slices, roasted pepper, havarti and mache. . .and truthfully, it was just as good. Will keep the mayo recipe around to spice up other sandwiches... like grilled cheese, avocado and turkey sandwiches or panini?!

I am actually only rating the dressing. I doubled it, and then set out herb & garlic and roma tomato wrap-sized tortillas along with platters of ham, turkey, cheeses, lettuce leaves, sprouts and roasted red pepper halves and the sauce. Everyone chose his favorite combinations, and even the pickiest child in the bunch liked it!

These wraps are always a hit with company. Making the spread the night before really makes the taste even better. I usually skip the lettuce and add avocado though.

I made this wrap for my family, and we all loved it! The mayo is very tasty and easy to prepare. I added bacon, Monterey Jack cheese, avocado and tomatoes to the wraps and they came out great. Very easy and delicious summer dinner. Perfect for when it's too hot to cook.

I added tomatoes and avocado slices to this. They were very good, although next time I will add mango strips. A little bit of "sweet" would have been the perfect touch. served with a black bean and corn salad, and they were a big hit.

Pretty good. I'd add avocados or tomatoes to give the wrap a little more bulk and interest, but the mayo is quite good and overall the recipe is quick, easy, and tasty.

I added a small clove of garlic along with the chipotles in adobo, chopped them in a chopper and added the green onion and cilantro along with a bit more of the chipotle sauce. This Mayo is great on any sandwich. My friend's teenage son says it Rocks!!!

The chipotle mayonnaise made the wraps. Everyone wanted the recipe. I did not find minced chipotles at the store, but found the whole canned ones, removed the seeds and minced them myself. I added the chipotles to taste, until it had the "kick" I wanted. Just turkey and lettuce for the wraps seemed a little too bland, so I added tomato, cheese, sprouts, avocado and it tasted fantastic. Also, I let everyone make their own and the chipotle mayonnaise stretched farther than the recipe called for. It has such flavor that you don't need as much.

This recipe turned out wonderfully well. Delicious. Quick and easy, too. I added cheese and might add avacado as suggested. I will be serving these again.

The mayonnaise is very good, but I think it needs a little something more for the filling, maybe tomato would be good. I'll definitely make this again though.

Very easy and delicious! Next time, I will add a tablespoon of the adobo sauce to the mayo and cut down on the amount of cilantro and green onions. Took advice from previous reviewer and added provolone and avocado to the wrap, it was SO yummy!

I made these turkey wraps ahead of time for a picnic lunch, and they turned out wonderful! To save on time, I purchased a bottle of chipotle mayo and added the green onions and lime juice. I used southwest flour tortillas and added some sliced avacado and provolone cheese, which made these soooo good! I heated them up slightly so that the cheese would melt. I served the "Black bean, corn and tomato salad" from this website which was a perfect salad to accompany the southwest flavors! Will make both again and again!

So quick easy and very tasty. I only used half the amount of mayo mixture for each wrap and found it to be plenty.

I was looking for inventive things to make for my husbands lunch. This recipe was a hit! The flavor is absolutely fantastic and it took about 15 min. to make. I will definitely make this recipe again. This is a perfect sandwich for picnics.

I was looking for a way to use leftover chipotle peppers in adobo, so I gave these wraps a try. They were certainly quick to make and pretty tasty. My preference would be to cut down on the cilantro just a bit, and possibly try substituting cream cheese for the mayonnaise. Avacado or nice ripe tomatoes would work great in this recipe.

We loved this dish. We had smoked a turkey breast on Sunday and made these wraps to finish off the leftovers. The may was a huge hit, and we're thinking of all the ways we can use that again. I served the wraps with the summer corn showder recipe on this site. All in all, a great dinner.

I think overall the idea is good, but the chances of finding chipoltle in certain ares of the country at certain times of the year are very slim. But it was easy to prepare and very tasty.

I made this recipe (with a few alterations) with leftover turkey breast. I used a baguette in lieu of a tortilla, and I also added tomatoes. My husband and I thought it was delicious. The sauce was out of this world! I think I am always going to keep some on hand to spice up any sandwich! Definitely will make this again! :o)

I MADE THESE FOR MY SON'S 1ST BIRTHDAY PARTY FOR A GROUP OF 30. I GOT RAVE REVIEWS AND I THOUGHT THEY WERE TERRIFIC AS WELL. I AM GOING TO MAKE THEM AGAIN THIS YEAR FOR HIS 2ND BIRTHDAY PARTY. THE CHIPOTLE MAYO REALLY MAKES THIS SANDWICH.

I used deli sliced turkey and didn't have any cilantro or green onions on hand. I added some minced Vidalia instead. This sandwich is so flavorful and completely quick and easy. I may have added a little more chipotle and adobo sauce than called for, but my spicy-food loving father even thought it was "good and hot". Delicious.

This has become a staple Saturday lunch dish for us in the summer. An added bonus is the chipotle mayonnaise. We use it on crab cakes and lots of other dishes.

The chipotle mayonnaise is delicious! I first used it as spread for little turkey lettuce sandwiches on small bagette-style dinner rolls. Then I made the mayonnaise again and used it as a base for tuna salad.

The Chipotle Mayo is great!! The only problem I have with this is this recipe is too BLAND. I kicked my wrap up a notch by adding tomatoes, avocadoes, extra sharp cheddar cheese and bacon.
