This is an exceptional way to use left over boiled shrimp! I made this several hours ahead of time and I think by sitting in the fridge the flavors developed in the stuffing. Initially, I thought removing the gills from the portobellos (grapefruit spoons rock and make it easy!) was silly--however, after I did it I realized that it gives you more room for the delicious stuffing. I also broiled for a few minutes to brown the tops. We loved it and will make again.

Excellent recipe! I kept the quantity for the filling the same, but used it for two servings for lunch. I sauteed the chopped mushroom stems with the onion and garlic mixture, and replaced the basil and rosemary with fresh cilantro. Instead of fresh breadcrumbs, I used packaged panko and replaced the mayonnaise with reduced fat mayonnaise. Instead of parmesan, I used the shredded fontina, asiago, parmesan mixture from Whole Foods. I also added some fresh-squeezed lemon to the stuffing. I stuffed two large portobello mushrooms, instead of the smaller ones, after removing their gills. I found the baking time and temperature to be accurate.

This recipe is amazing! This is my first time cooking with Portobello Mushrooms so I was kind of hesitant, but it turned out wonderfully. Here are some more specifics on what I did: I used small northwestern cooked shrimp from Vons; I chopped up the mushroom stems and cooked it with the onions, garlic, basil, and rosemary; I sprinkled some mozarella cheese on top before I baked; I removed the dark gills, just like the recipe called for; and I used 3-1/2 inch mushrooms. Tips: don't cook the mushrooms for too long! They shrivel up because they contain a lot of moisture.

I had a pound of shrimp and an 8oz package of sliced portabellos in the fridge, as well as all the other ingredients on hand, so I used this recipe as an inspiration for a casserole. I doubled the stuffing recipe, sauteeing the pound of shrimp (just until barely pink) in the skillet after the onions/garlic had softened. Then, I folded the mushrooms into the stuffing mixture,spread it in a 13x9 casserole pan, topped it with a little more parmesan cheese, and baked it as directed. It was fast, easy, and quite tasty... not to mention being made of kitchen staples (always a plus). A rich dish that made a complete dinner served with a lightly dressed green salad and the rest of the loaf of french bread. However, it did turn out greasy/oily... I imagine that the extra olive oil had no where to go in the baking pan, but would have drained off, if I had followed the recipe exactly. I would make this again as a casserole, but reducing the amount of oil and/mayonnaise and look forward to trying it an an appetizer as intended. The flavor profile wasn't extraordinary enough to warrant four stars... just a good, solid basic recipe, but this recipe is a keeper.

Yum! I hadn't cooked with whole portobellos before - I removed the gills - I'm not sure what the difference would be. I added a little bit of chopped fresh spinach and topped with some mozzarella cheese. Very tasty!!

Made this with a few changes. Used white stuffing mushrooms, chopped the stems and put into the stuffing mix after sauteeing them with onion and other items, sauteed in butter not EVOO, used 2 Tbl mayo, 7 Tbl Costco Stravecchio Parmegiana Reggiano, 2 Tbl dried bread crumbs from homemade white bread, and large, cooked shrimp, finely chopped.I prebaked the mushrooms the day before stuffing them to dry them out a bit. I only had dried romsemary leaves so I reconstituted them in water in the microwave for a minute, then chopped the leaves (similar to using dried chiles that you soak to reconstitute). These are fabulous, and I plan to use leftover stuffing mix as a seafood stuffing for flounder or sole.

This is a great, easy to make, versatile recipe--it can be served as an appetizer (using the mini portobellos), or as a main/side course (using large portobellos). Regardless, it is delicious!

I loved these, they are quick and easy to make. The only change that I made was to add a few more mushrooms and chop the stem pieces up finely into the mix. Also bake the mushrooms for 10 minutes before stuffing to help reduce the moisture. I have served them at several get togethers and they are a hit.

I stuffed 2 large portobellos for a main dish instead of app. I removed the gills from one and left the other. The one with the gills kept it's shape better and did not discolor the filling. I will not remove the gills in the future. The recipe was delicious although unfortunately I only had kraft parmesan available. That took away from the recipe a little bit but it was my own fault. Next time I would sprinkle some Panko on top with a tiny little drizzle of garlic infused olive oil.

More or less followed the recipe with large portobello mushrooms as an entree (I used less oil, less onion, less cheese, and a variety of dried herbs as it is winter--savory, rosemary, oregano and sage). I pre-roasted the mushrooms as suggested with some evoo and salt and pepper and made my own breadcrumbs on the stove per another reviewer's suggestion. Our family of four really enjoyed the dinner with some salad and artichokes. Yummy, satisfying, EASY!

Absolutely delicious! This made a great main-dish for our vegetarian family by omitting the shrimp. I used 4 large portabellas and doubled everything else in the recipe except the oil and mayonnaise to accommodate the size of the mushroom caps. I ended up leaving out the basil as I forgot to purchase it and didn't feel like going back to the store. Everyone raved about it and the Carmelized-Shallot Mashed Potatoes (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Caramelized-Shallot-Mashed-Potatoes-241649) I served with it.

This recipe is great. I never had mushrooms prior to this recipe and now I am hooked.

This recipe is excellent! Despite the simple list of ingredients, the flavor was fabulous.

I, too, used large portobello mushrooms (4) and added the gills to the mixture. Subbed oregano for rosemary, a tad bit extra basil to make up for it and a little less mayo than called for. The gill addition made the stuffing very dark, so presentation suffered but it tasted amazing. Also, fresh breadcrumbs are key! (Just toast ripped apart French bread in some olive oil stove top.) Wonderfully rich!

Wonderful recipe. I made this last night for the first time as an main course and it definitely is a hit. The flavors are terrific. I did encounter a slight bump with trying to get the "gills" out but managed to keep everything intact. Next time I'll try to do some other variation like vegetarian (butternut squash cubes, spinach, artichokes) or maybe adding in some bacon.

A great recipe for entertaining as you can make it ahead of time and just pop in the oven (I made it in them in the morning, covered with Saran and stuck in the fridge). I used 4 large portobellos so it could be a main course. Also used Panko and cooked the shrimp with the garlic and onions. I also made some as a vegetarian dish by roasting an acorn squash with butter and salt and pepper and then cubing the flesh and using that instead of the shrimp. Both ways got raves reviews from guests. I would definitely use a grapefruit spoon to scrap out the mushroom gills, it makes it soooooo easy- thanks for the suggestion from a previous reviewer!

Have made often using larger chopped shrimp and cayenne pepper. Can be an entree using larger bellas. I also use the chopped stems which makes mix go much further and can also be spread on crackers and served. I prebake the mushrooms for about 15 minutes before filling to get rid of the water.

I love this site, but I'm continually amazed at people that review a recipe after they've completely changed it. What exactly is the point of that? That's like test driving a BMW after you've replaced the engine with a VW engine, suspension with a panel van, transmission of a Yugo, and the body with that of a Ford Pinto...then proclaiming, "I didn't care for the BMW...way over-priced for what you get".

MMMMM. So easy and so good, even with mushrooms that were a day or two past their prime. (Old mushrooms may the source of some of the "flat" mushrooms others have had problems with, as well as difficulty scraping gills. Fresh 'shrooms clean out very easily.) Only thing I might change next time would be to cut the oil by a third, and to sprinkle some parm curls on top for serving.

I made this recipe using 2 types of mushrooms-- baby bellas and "gourmet stuffing mushrooms" (what appeared to be really large button mushrooms). The bellas tasted better, but didnt hold together nearly as well. For presentation I'd definitely go with other mushrooms. Both were done after 30 minutes (where the bellas were almost flat after this much time). Also, I used the panko breadcrumbs, used a melon baller to remove the gills quickly and easily, and added crushed red pepper for a bit of a zip. I also added butter and a little parmesean to the top, as one review suggested, which was wonderful.

I made this last night and it was delicious. I used raw large prawns and cut them into thirds before adding them to the mixture. I also used Panko as others had suggested. I didn't have fresh rosemary but used powdered instead -- about 1 tsp and 1/2 tsp black pepper. I used 4 large portobello mushrooms generously stuffing them using all the mixture. This was such as easy receipe to prepare and I will definitely make this again. I am also going to try this filling in pastry shells and as a topping for grilled salmon. Next time I will use additional basil to garnish the cooked mushrooms.

I loved this recipie. I must admit that I actually changed a bunch of ingredients as I did not have all on hand, but it still turned out beautiful!

Would definitely make again!

I made this recipe but used 1LB italian chicken sausage (casings removed) which I sauteed with the herbs and onion and garlic.

I will make them again and again and try some variations artichoke hearts, roasted red bells, shrimp and scallops, salmon, etc etc. Yummmy!

Easy and delicious. Sauteed raw shrimp with the onions, used dried herbs and cut back about a third on the oil. Didn't find it too rich or too bready. Excellent in large portobellos with salad for a dinner. I'll try this again with fresh herbs.

My chief complaint about this dish is that is has far too much breadcrumbs. Unfortunately, I put the breadcrumbs into the bowl first and added all the other ingredients before mixing. Bad idea, obviously. It was far too bready. Like others, I sauteed large shrimp with the onions and herbs, wich smelled and tasted delicious on its own. I should have added breadcrumbs to taste, and to my desired consistency. I'll make it again, but add the beadcrumbs last.

Like many others, I chopped large shrimp and sauteed them with the onions; then packed into large portobellos to serve as a main course with watercress salad. They were very rich, perhaps too much so, and delicious, but I felt they were lacking something. I look forward to making them again - and again - and tinkering. I may try Sweden's suggestion re: decreasing the amount of mayo and adding a little horseradish for zip.

Served on a weeknight with a salad, and my family loved them. My husband must've said "thank you for fixing these!" at least 10 times! They were easy and relatively quick to make. One question -- what's the best way to remove the gills from the mushrooms? I tried to carefully scrape them out with a spoon, but despite my best efforts ended up messing up a couple of the mushrooms by accidentally pushing the spoon through the side of a mushroom a bit.

Excellent and easy. I used Panko bread crumbs so the filling was a bit dry. A splash of Pinot Grigio brought it to a nice, moist consistency. I found a small sized cast iron pan, instead of a baking sheet, held the mushrooms quite nicely. After twenty minutes in the oven I dotted each mushroom with a bit of butter and added more grated Parm on top. A quick two minutes under the broiler resulted in a perfect, crisp brown crust. The only thing wrong with this recipe is that it doesn't make enough!

The cheese in this recipe was by far the dominant flavor which sort of spoiled it for me. I would use considerably less cheese next time, maybe even a milder cheese. The homemade bread crumbs added a lightness to the filing that I really liked. Next time, in addition to changing the cheese, I will fill whole portobello caps instead of using the babies.

Easy, quick and delicious! I used regular size portobellos, scallops and a dash of white wine when cooking them with the onions, garlic and herbs.

Have made these as stated, only w/panko & larger, shrimp & large portobellos and they are very good.

Hi, I used the big portobello's and made this as a meal vs. an appetizer. I used tiger prawns and chopped them into large pieces. Smaller might have been better. I cooked them first in a little olive oil, garlic, and white wine. I did use mayo, but only one Tbsp. because I don't like the idea of mayo in cooking. I used pesto instead of basil and omitted the rosemary. It was stupendous. Yes, that's what I said: Stupendous.

I also increased the fresh herbs quite abit.. though I used dry basil since I was without fresh. FANTASTIC.... highly suggested

I made this as an appetizer for Thanksgiving dinner. It was great, and they were eaten in a flash! The only adjustments I made to the recipe were to use "Lite" Best Foods Mayo (NOT not fat-free), larger sized shrimp (chopped) and 2" diameter mushrooms. I had almost half of the stuffing left over which I froze, in hopes that it will be fine for Christmas appetizers (can't imagine why it wouldn't be). One comment/tip - as much as I love stuffed mushrooms (nearly ANY recipe), I've always disliked the fact that they are very "wet" finger food, and often the stuffing separates from the mushroom, making them messy to ear. Ironically, the day after I made and served these, I saw Rachael Ray making stuffed shrooms and she said she saute's the mushrooms before stuffing them to let them release most of their moisture...and that not only does the stuffing not separate from the tops, but the mushroom "shells" stay much firmer for easier handling...who knew!?! I'm definitely trying this tip next time.

Rating: 4
This was a huge hit! And even after I forgot to put in the breadcrumbs! It still made lots of stuffing...enough that it needed 8 large white mushrooms, again w/o adding in breadcrumbs. I think it'd fill a lot more mushrooms up if you added the breadcrumbs. Can't wait to try putting mornay sauce on top of this...

I have made this recipe numerous times, and each time has been a success. My husband requests this dish at least once a month. I have used baby portobellos and also large portobellos-- this recipe fills 2-3 large ones. I wouldn't change a thing about this. Make sure that you use fresh, fluffy bread crumbs, as they make the "crust" of the mushrooms very light and crispy.

I made some substitutions as I didn't have all the ingredients called for. French bread was replaced by organic multi-grain and shrimp was replaced with pollack, (fake crab). I used a Mayan onion, (sweet), and added a pinch of lemon juice to the mixture to balance it. This is a great main dish and I would definitely make it again. Maybe a sourdough bread and real shrimp next time!

I have made this many times since it was published. I always use the largest portobellos I can find and I hand chop large shrimp.

I wish I made more!

These were quite good. I did lighten them up considerably but not using any oil, just cooking spray, but adding the chopped mushroom stems for body and then using only 1/4 cup bread crumbs, and by using 2 Tbsp. lite mayo instead of 1/4 cup full-fat mayo. The mushroom stems added enough moisture that next time I'll try it with just 1 Tbsp. lite mayo. I didn't have any Crimini mushrooms, so I used button mushrooms and I used chopped larger shrimp, as so many others have done. This was a great, non-light tasting recipe that I'd serve to company. Next time, I'm using half shrimp and half lump crabmeat, and perhaps a touch more fresh rosemary. We really enjoyed these as a light supper with a salad.

I followed this recipe almost to a T, just instead of Parm. I used Picorino Romano. Also I put the filling into large portobelloes and had them for a main course. I've never comined shrimp and mushrooms before the flavors were wonderful together. I think I would like to try Tomas K's suggestion of smoked oysters. Sounds most intriguing. Also next time I will add more rosemary. The flavor of it was lost somehow.

Delicious! I doubled the shrimp and chopped it up and used crushed croutons instead of bread crumbs and they flew off of the plate. Also used a romano/parmesan/asiago cheese mix.

You really can't go wrong whether you follow the recipe to the letter or improvise freely as have done so many of the cooks who have listed their comments below. I used fresh shrimp, big portabellos (no small ones to be had the day I shopped) and chevre instead of mayo. Very nice. I served them to my #1 "Most Fussy Guests" who almost never finish everything on their plates... but who gobbled up these savoury, nicely textured, delicious stuffed mushrooms.

This recipe went into my Favorites Notebook after the first time I tried. My husband and all his family really loved it. They are all good cooks so this really says something. I used the large mushrooms, and I think the Frsh Rosemanry and good cheese made the difference. I used Asigao the second time. Have made this 3 times and it is on tonight's menu as well, along with Grouper Picata.

I made this exactly to the recipe but also added about 8oz of lump crab. Everyone raved about the mushrooms. I also used the large portabello mushrooms and 1/4 them to serve. Very easy to prepare. Definatly a keeper!

I love to cook but an accident left me in a wheelchair 12 years ago, so I look for for easy to prepare table fare that still seems like I worked hard at it. Stuffed mushrooms are winners at dinner parties, and this base recipe helped get things off the ground in a hurry. I made some with baby shrimp, some with crab meat, and some with smoked oysters. I crushed seasoned croutons, used a good sized dribble of caesar dressing with Hellmans for moist consistency, added romano, parmesan, and mozzarella cheeses, a pinch of cayenne, sea salt, and fresh ground pepper and bon appetit!

I served this the other evening and it was a real hit. I used the bread I had on hand for the bread crumbs(which was an Asiago Artisan bread from our local market). I coarsely chopped the shrimp. Excellent!

Wonderful recipe! Our guests were really impressed, as it also wasa great match with the Champagne. I had to reduce the cooking time though. Almost overcooked after 25 mins.

This is the second time that I've made this recipe and I modified it a good bit each time: no fresh basil on hand, used various dried. Did use fresh rosemary, which added a nice flavor. Used fresh, large shrimp (chopped), lump crab, seasoned breadcrumbs, guyrere cheese instead of parm, 1 package of cream cheese instead of mayo, and added chopped green pepper plus a little cayenne. Made this for family and everyone loved it...while vastly different than the original, I loved the blueprint! Thanks!

We used fresh shrimp and 1/4 cup of dry breadcrumbs. We also used larger portobello mushrooms. Terrific recipe

This was good but not great. I too used the small baby bella mushrooms. I have found other stuffed mushroom recipes that I prefer.

I LOVED this! I used 3 large shrooms and served it for dinner - I will most definitely make this again. It was great and VERY easy!

I used regular white mushrooms, a bit of extra cheese, and a sprinkle of dried bread crumbs--just enough to firm up the stuffing. This is fast and easy to make & can be fixed ahead of time. Our guests loved it, and I have to agree that it was delicious and very low effort. Highly recommended!

I made this recipe for the second time over the weekend for a friend's party and they were a huge hit both times. Everyone loved them. I did make some minor changes however to the recipe, the stems i removed from the mushrooms I chopped up and sauted them with the onion and garlic and used them in the stuffing. I also used flavored bread crumbs instead of plain. Other then that I followed this recipe exactly and they came out great. I would make this recipe again and again.

The family loved it and so did our guests. I would make it again and try crab like the previous rater advised. I used crimini mushrooms which are small portobellos. It was a tasty and substantial appetizer. You can't lose with this recipe.

YUMMY--made these into small stuffed mushrooms rather than big ones--everyone loved them! followed the recipe exactly except for using smaller mushrooms, and they were a hit! Served them with lots of other Epicurous recipes--what a great site!

Excellent. I used medium shrimp, peeled and deveined, chopped them in to 3-4 pieces each, and 4 large portobello mushrooms. I did not cook the shrimp before adding them to the stuffing mix. This made a wonderful main course!

I made these for a New Year's Eve party and they were quite a hit. I think I may try lump crab in place of the shrimp next time because the filling is such a great combination of flavors. This recipe will definitely go in my party file.

This is my second visit to this recipe and the reason I enlisted with epicurious. A great (and easy) starter for dinner parties. Skip the mayo and use chicke broth as NJ recommends- fantastic!

Absolutely wonderful!! In fact, the best I've ever had..no kidding. I didn't changed a thing and will be making these over and over again!! I'm even going to make these for the Holidays as an appetizer, and just use the smaller portabello mushrooms. A MUST try for any mushroom lover!! Liz

I love this recipe and so does everyone I make it for. I follow the recipe exactly as is. I've tried both baby portobellos and the larger variety. I think it was better in the smaller mushroom caps.

Fabulous! Made according to recipe and used fresh herbs, but did use low-fat mayo. Combo of the flavors are to die for! Everyone wanted recipe, including my gourmet-cook friends. Easy and great as it can be made ahead. Have already made three times.

I loved this recipe. It was delicious. I deviated slightly by adding some white wine when sauteeing the mixture and I also added fresh tomatoes. I will definitely make this dish again.

These were amazing!!! I got rid of the fatty mayo and used chicken broth. I'm not sorry at all. I also sprinkled a little cayenne pepper on top to spice it up a little, made them even better! I'd make these again anytime.

I used small toasted bread 'cubes' from fresh sourdough in place of crumbs. About three cups. Cubes held herb flavoring better. Also used 3 large portobellos to the same stuffing recipie. Dinner for two. Nice dry wine to compliment.

excellent recipe, very easy to improviseI added a little roasted garlic and ginger and it was delicious, next time I make it I would not stuff the mushrooms and bake I would do it seperate as the mushrooms were a bit soggy, but everyone raved about them and went back for more

Thoroughly enjoyed the dish. Much more flavorful than the bland lunch my friends and I had at the Ritz-Carlton in Cleveland.

Fabulous! Quick, easy, delicious,and elegant, especially with a spring mix salad, crusty French bread, and a crisp white wine. Fresh herbs are a must. One large mushroom is sufficient per serving as long as you mound the shrimp mixture. Even my 14 year old son raves about it. I've made this dish 4 times in 2 weeks!
