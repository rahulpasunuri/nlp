Buy the short ribs with the bone in. Love this dish.

This was ok. I used can garbanzo, and chopped the veggies. Pureed the beans a little to thicken the sauce. added bacon in the beginning, and highly recommend you do so. I used boneless ribs like other reviews. However, they came out totally dry. Perhaps, I should have decreased the cooking time (duh!). Overall, a good dish, but I bet there are better short ribs recipes out there...

Served this to our gourmet group and received rave reviews, plus requests for the recipe. It took most of the day, but worth the time.

A very nice winter dish. I actually made two meals out of this. The first was the recipe exactly (except that I forgot the last minute peppers). We ate all the short ribs that night but had the veggies left. So the next night I broiled chicken and apple sausages and we ate them with the beans and veggies (with the peppers, which I remembered this time). With homemade garlic bread, it was great both nights. I like the short ribs better, my husband liked the sausage better. Either way great. You should definitely chop up the carrots and celery and I used more carrots than the recipe called for. But I'd recommend this highly.

Really great winter meal. My kids (4 and 15 months) are not fans of garbanzo beans, but my husband and I enjoyed this very much. I was baking French bread today as well, so I ended up cooking it in my paella pan on the stove instead. Came out fine!

The ultimate recipe for using short ribs . . . takes a long time (be prepared) but worth it! The rosemary flavor is delicious. I used canned garbanzo beans so skipped everything for the dried beans and just did the 45 minute simmer with veggies.

This recipe is delicious. I have made it twice for New years Day. The cherry peppers really make it. It looks festive and the peppers give the dish a wonderful acidity. I wouldn't change a thing!

I thought this was a good recipe and I would make it again, but I'd use only half the amount of sherry vinegar as I though the taste of sherry vinegar was overpowering the meat. I recommend low sodium chicken broth. I also think chopping all the vegetables makes sense. I don't see why the recipe calls for cutting them only in half.

Really, really good. Also used canned garbanzo beans.

Fantastic dish. I didn't think it was that complicated or time consuming because I used canned garbanzo beans and boneless short ribs. My guests raved about the entire meal.

This is a different take on short ribs that really works. To save time I used canned garbanzo beans, and only had them simmer for 45 min w/ the vegetables and herbs. Worked great. Also used 4 sweet cherry peppers and 4 hot (found this a perfect balance).

This was dee-lish! It is time consuming, but easy to make extras, so we've been enjoying it for a solid week. Those cherry peppers added the zing that really made it special.

This is one of my favorite recipes. However, it is time consuming, so I only make it once in a while. The flavors are wonderful. The cherry tomatoes add depth to the recipe. Awesome!

this recipe has a few problems; 1) the onion, carrot, & celery need to be rough chop (not quartered or halved) or you end up with large pieces in your garbanzo beans - not attractive. 2)after browning the short ribs there is way too much fat in the pan - dump out all but 2-3 tablespoons. 3) it should be noted that if you do the beans and the ribs at the same time the recipe takes at least 2 3/4 hours so start early!

Used boneless short ribs and the results were wonderful. Followed the recipe and found this very easy to make and flavorful to eat.

Great recipe. Cooked the dish on the stovetop with added liquid - just perfect.

I have made this recipe several times, with rave reviews each time. I use golden raisins as well as regular raisins for color and added sweetness. It's well worth the effort, as it is an unusual and absolutely delicious dish.

Not a review, but a suggestion. Many of the braised, slow-cooked recipes which call for short ribs also turn out beautifully using beef shin - the beef version of osso buco. Very tender, flavorful, and about 1/2 the price of short ribs.

One of the delicious food I ever tasted! It's an unforgotten experienced! I was so excited to finish it up cooking just to let my family tastes the new recipe i got. I am terribly nervous when they started tasting it, looked at me so meaningful and I really didn't know what they thinking. I saw them walking slowly up in me. They smiled and embraced me so tight and said "We love you for keeping us so special in your heart, we know, because you prioritized us when it comes to your expertise in cooking". I was very, very shocked by that time! But I'm so happy for the result! EXCELLENT!

This dish was good but alot of work. I think I would just skip all the garbanzo beans next time and just move ahead with the meat and the wonderful sauce, adding more carrots and perhaps some raisins. The meat was soft and delicious and the sauce is yummy. Took alot of time.

Vancouver, I sympathize. Are you sure you are logged in, do you try to save from the actual recipe page instead of from the recipes Main page, have you tried setting up a new account, and if all else fails can you print out the recipes you want to save? good luck --

I click on "add to" but get no confirmation and the recipe is not added. I have e-mailed epicurious numerous times with no response. Any ideas???

This was fantastic! I put the cherry peppers in at the end and they do spice it up quite a bit. I even bought the crusty bread to sop up the sauce and it was wonderful! An added bonus was that all of the fresh herbs made my house smell great. I will make this again very soon.

This was a wonderfully flavorful dish and well worth the time and effort. The addition of fresh herbs is key. We would reduce the amount of chicken broth next time and we did not use the cherry peppers. We doubled the recipe in order to have leftovers and everything was devoured. My cooking partner suggested putting some of the garbanzo beans and the broth into the food processor next time to make a thicker "gravy". We will make this again.
