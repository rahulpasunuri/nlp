This was okay, nothing special... until we added sweet potato, then it was out of this world.

The flavor has potential, but this is low-fat masquerading as gourmet. The way the recipe is written the texture etc. is very bad. I put the whole mess in the mixer after I had riced potatoes and buttermilk all over the kitchen and added butter, cream cheese and hot water. The flavor as written is good but the texture was DIET and not faster than the traditional stove-top method. I vote drop the microwave and add some fat.
