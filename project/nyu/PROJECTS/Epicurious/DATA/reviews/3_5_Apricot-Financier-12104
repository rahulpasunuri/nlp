Delicious and so easy! Instead of apricots, I topped mine with halved and pitted cherries and sliced almonds. It took at least 30 minutes to bake in my oven. Might be even better with browned butter.

I thought this was very tasty. My apricots were not super sweet, so it needed ice cream to be a dessert, but was great plain for breakfast.

I tasted this once before when a friend made this for a potluck. I ravished it before anyone had a chance to even look at it! I made this on my own and the taste was a little different than how I had it the first time. My outcome was just a tad more "fluffy", probably due to the whipping of the egg whites. Instead of using apricots, I used canned peaches, which worked just fine. My friend had also added almond slivers on top, which I did not do. I thought it tasted better with the almonds because there were contrasting textures. I would definitely make this again.

This is a wonderful cake and we often don't even bother to top it with ice cream or whipped cream as the recipe suggests since the flavors are so good. We find it best the first day, but if you're lucky enough to have any leftover from dinner, try it for breakfast with coffee. YUM.

A great recipe. We often drizzle chocolate on top of the apricots to make it more festive! It is easy enough for the kids to help out and tastes great.
