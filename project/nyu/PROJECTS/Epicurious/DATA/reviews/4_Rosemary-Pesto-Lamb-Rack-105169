I was alittle hesitant to try this recipe, since every other recipe for rack of lamb tells you to brown the meat first and then finish it in the oven. But I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out great! Meat was a perfect "medium-rare", and the rosemary-pesto formed a delicious crust. Don't think about trying this recipe, just try it!!

Simple, very flavorful and very easy! Goes well with mashed potatoes. I also ate it with glazed carrots. For medium-rare, I took it out a bit early.

very simple and perfect for lamb. I had to cook lamb longer than the recipe suggets to get medium rare.

A very good, and tasty dish. My changes included adding one tablespoon of Parmesan and Romano chesse (a little more bite), and using single rib chops and coating both sides with the pesto. The latter change forced me to reduce the heat to 400 degrees, and cooks for 8 minutes per side for medium rare.

I made this using prepared(Costco) pesto to which I added extra fresh, finely chopped rosemary,basil and parsley. I skillet browned the meat before putting on the pesto, then baked it at 325F until the remote reading thermometer read 122F. After tenting with foil for 10min the temp was 137 and perfectly rare to med rare.

Fantastic! I made this exactly as directed with one small exception: I used 3 1 pound racks (served 4 easily) with same amount of pesto, cooking time likely varies by size of rack. The lamb was exceptionally delicious, moist and tender. I had not prepared rack of lamb before and search the website for ideas; this one does not require any pre-browning and is very straightforward to prepare. I look forward to making it again.

I loved this recipe. It was so simple and fuss-free, and most if can be prepared ahead of time. My Dad said that the herb crust was the only thing that redeemed the 'normally bland' lamb. I wouldn't really call lamb bland, but okay. This is a nice dish for holidays, company, or a weeknight dinner.

Outstanding. The first thing I cooked off of this site. Simple and delicious. I cooked it for Christmas dinner for 2 and it was the perfect main course for a large dinner. Served with oven roasted root vegetables and roasted chestnut soup.

This is an absolutely fantastic dish. I made it for a dinner party and everyone was going nuts over it. I even had one lamb hater going back for seconds. I started the racks out in the bbq to give a bit of smoke to them then finished in the oven. This worked very well and added to the flavors.

I didn't have parsley in the house so I took all the bitters out of a salad mix and it was just as good, If you are having troubles with the pesto, just add oliveoil and more cheese, that always works for me

My boyfriend loved this! I'm vegetarian and have never cooked lamb before. Recipe is so simple. I cooked 20 min at 450, and 20 at 400 for medium rare. It smelled wonderful and was eaten within minutes!

I fixed this last night for my husband and he just asked me to fax it to his office. He must be giving it rave reviews. I thought it was easy , had eye appeal and was the best lamb I ever ate. I put about a 1 1/2 t. of lemon juice in and used a little fresh oregano since I was a little short on parsley in my garden.

I've made this recipe 3 times to rave reviews each time. I like to keep some of the sauce and serve it on the side with the lamb. Have made it for 6 people and it's just as easy. (Marinade can be prepared ahead of time too).

This was fabulous. I made it for my husband and he loved it. I will make it again and again. Actually I am planning a dinner party for 12. Do I dare try to make it for that many?

Substituted basil for rosemary, and asiago cheese for parmesan and it turned out fabulous! All my Easter guests had a 'pile of bones' on their plates! It was wonderful with roasted baby potatoes!

The first time that I've ever prepared rack of lamb was for a dinner party last night and everyone loved this dish. It was remarkably easy. I cooked it for about 20 minutes at 450 degrees and it registered 132 degrees on my instant read thermometer. My oven may be off, but, I would have overcooked it if I had gone only by the minutes. It was perfect.

This recipe is delicious. A excellent way to prepare a lamb rack. The coating is superb. It is quick and easy to prepare. I did cook the meat longer then recommended. 20min. at 450, and about 25min. at 400, it was perfect. This is definitly a keeper.

Fantastic. I have made this for dinner parties as well as a week night dinner with my husband. I normally add a little more rosemary to give it lots of punch! Served with mashed potatoes.

Doubled the recipe, fed the troops, and was inundated with praise, and requests for the recipe. A definite winner.

Have made several times! Like to serve with a white bean dish. Many lamb recipes call for a bread crust so this is very flavorful for those who can't eat gluten. I found I needed to cook about 20 minutes, though

I knocked this together for an impromput dinner party and it was a roaring success as well as easy to prepare in literally minutes My guests licked the pan clean. I might use more rosemary next time as it was a bit too subtle. I served it with couscous.

I served this recipe tonight for company. It was so easy and delicious! I followed the directions for roasting. I did keep it in a little longer than stated because I wanted it to be medium instead of medium-rare. I will defintiely make this again!

Very easy to make, and delicious. Excellent as a do-ahead for dinner parties of up to 8 people! Serve with a nice couscous or mashed potatoes, and asparagus. And of course a wonderful red wine --

Important to use Italian parsely and a little more than recipe stated. Also use parmigiano reggiano cheese and not any old supermarket stuff. Lamb racks are expensive don't stint on the other ingredients! This was delicious with garlic mashed potatoes and brocooi rabe wilted in 1 tsp. balsamic. Eat with 1997 Brunello wine -- superb!
