I made this as a side salad without the chicken, and my husband said it was the best salad I'd ever made. I used shallots instead of red onion and added homemade Parmesan-coated croutons, but otherwise did nothing different. I loved how the hot dressing wilted the spinach. This is going to be my go-to spinach salad from now on.

I gave this recipe 4 forks because it helped me use up a leftover fried chicken breast, a bag of salad leaves and some bacon. It was so easy, I wondered why didn't I think of this before! Delicious and filling. Go for it.

Excellent, simple recipe! I used a little bleu cheese and toasted pecans on top. Cooked my own chicken (thighs) to keep sodium low. My bacon was very lean so I added a bit of olive oil and boosted the balsamic (I had a lot of spinach) This is a keeper.

delicious! I'm sure I would have liked it as written but I wanted to make it into a substantial meal. I like the idea of adding a cheese but I had none on hand. I added grape tomatoes and diced avocado. It's a nice basic recipe that lends itself to customization. I used center cut bacon so I didn't end up with enough drippings. I added oil to make up the difference giving it a little less trans fat.

I loved this salad, as did my company. I did have to add more balsamic vinegar to make more dressing. I also added crumbled blue and some toasted almonds. The added "bite" and "crunch" was awesome.

I used a brined and grilled chicken breast leftover from last night's dinner - great choice. The flavor of the dressing was great; although it seemed quite fatty compared to a canola oil dressing. Topped with mozzarella, which didn't add too much but it was a cheese I already had on hand.

Best salad I've ever made! I served pecan-crusted chicken on top and enjoyed every bite! The cornbread on the side was a great suggestion too.

My husband and I loved this recipe! We followed it exactly as is, and then added gorgonzola cheese and walnuts on top. It was very delicious and I can't wait to make it again next week! So yummy :)

A wonderful salad. For those who prefer, it could stand up to some serious blue cheese as well. I served it with some cheesy french bread. Yummy!

A weeknight staple in our home. Easy and delicious. Crumbling gorgonzola on top and sprinkling with toasted pecans or walnuts takes it to the next level.

Easy and good weeknight supper. I ended up cooking the onions for quite a while in the bacon drippings/balsamic mixture, and they were very sweet and good. However, this resulted in only enough dressing for 2 salads (which is all I needed anyways). I also crumbled gorgonzola on top, which added a lot to the the salad.

Fantastic and easy week night supper! My husband and I both loved it and will make again and again. We added a little crumbled bleu cheese on top which was a nice finish.

I didn't think this salad was so great... my husband was polite and said it was good but I think that was because he was starving..LOL!! Not alot of flavor ...I have made better spinach salads from scratch...

Very good. I doubled the recipe, but used a little less than double the amount of chicken. I added sliced mushrooms. This salad would also taste good without the chicken. I would recommend making a little extra dressing.

This was great, although I did add a few things. Instead of roast chicken I marinated bite sized chicken chunks in garlic, basil, oregano, S&P and a little white wine and olive oil for about two hours. To the salad I added tomatoes, fresh mushrooms, roasted peppers and fresh mozarella cheese. Very nice summer meal.

Easy, fast, delicious--what more could you want? A fine meal for a hot, sticky night. I added toasted walnuts as suggested below. A fine addition.

A nice salad. Easy to prepare. I crumbled blue cheese on top - a worthy addition. I would also use walnuts next time. I did not use chicken.

This was good and simple. I would consider exchanging the balsamic vinegar with 1 1/2 T ume plum vineger

This is an excellent recipe. I was looking for a salad to go with a pasta with a tomato cream sauce so I did not add the chicken to the salad. I did, however, add some sliced almonds which complimented the dressing and texture of the salad very nicely.

Wonderful! I was a little skeptical at first, but after the first bite I was hooked! Will definitely make again. I used boneless/skinless chicken thighs and I roasted them in my Ronco Showtime rotisserie for about 1/2 an hour. I also toasted some crushed walnuts and added them with the bacon. I, too, added a little more balsamic and just a touch of extra-virgin olive oil as I was tossing it. Superb! My wife was leary before she had a bite...then it was all gone! Yum! Great, easy recipe.

so quick and easy- just love that the dressing as directed is a little sparce so I used more bacon drippings and balsamic.

I made this salad for my daughter who's on weight watchers. She loved it, and it's not really that many points. As a non-dieter, it's excellent and easy. will definitely make it again.

I made this twice in the past two weeks and it has been a huge hit! My only change was to use boneless chicken breast that I cooked myself. The flavors blend together so well! I served the salad with tomato soup and a crusty whole grain bread. Yum!

I was looking for a side salad to go with some soup . . . so, I did not add chicken and I didn't have a red onion on hand, so I thinly sliced (paper-thin)1/2 white onion and 2 shallots. It worked really well and we all loved this. My husband has requested that I make it to go with Thanksgiving dinner this Thursday.

I made this meal for my parents-in-law. I followed the serving suggestion and they were impressed. It was very easy to make as well. The dressing seemed to be little less than I would like, so I put out the balsamic vinegar for anyone who like more dressing. Because the salad already had the bacon taste, it worked out.

I enjoyed this for lunch. Quick, tasty, and very easy.
