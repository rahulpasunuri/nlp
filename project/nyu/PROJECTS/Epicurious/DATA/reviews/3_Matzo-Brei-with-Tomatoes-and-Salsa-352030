Just so-so. Expected more from the recipe.

Do not hesitate to make this one, as I did, because it is fabulous! A bit more prep work than I'd like for a breakfast or brunch item, but worth it. Full of flavor and a great variation. Be sure not to overmix the salsa into the matzo mixture; leave it streaky.
