These pancakes are wonderful; they are fluffy, brown nicely, and do not suffer from the lack of oil in the batter. The only change I made was to use 1/3 cup whole wheat flour and 2/3 cup all-purpose. Be sure to oil griddle or skillet well for good color. I frequently make pancakes for supper, and this version will be on the menu for next week. Another note: I always use Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt (in red and white box) for most cooking. This is the salt used in the Bon Appetit Test Kitchen and has a lower sodium content than most other salt.

My favorite pancakes, period.

I used 1/3 cup oat flour, 1/3 cup white, 1/3 cup whole wheat and used skim milk and added some greek yogurt. Also added some pumpkin and pumpkin spice. YUM. I think the recipe is pretty foolproof and they are light and fluffy and not at all gritty like some whole grain recipes.

These freeze very well - make a double batch, let them cool, then freeze them in a tupperware with a piece of waxed paper in-between. In the morning I toss 2 in the toaster and voila! A great alternative to toast. Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/notes/Maple-Walnut-and-Flaxseed-Pancakes-109072#ixzz1axNVxxCS

I have been making this recipe now for the past year or so, and the pancakes come out good each time. I have experimented with many variations, including 1/2 whole wheat flour, adding bananas, substituting butter milk with milk/yogurt mixture. It all works!

These pancakes are absolutely delicious. I'm not usually a pancake person, but I can eat these plain... also delicious with maple syrup or jam on them. This is definitely a keeper recipe! Did not change anything to it.

These are delicious and healthy pancakes. I used 3/4 c of whole wheat pastry flour and 1/4 oat flour instead of all purpose flour. I also added 2 mashed bananas to the wet mix as others did. I used almond milk instead of the buttermilk (lactose free family). I wound up adding an additional 1/2 cup of almond milk because the batter is very thick. The walnut flavor wasn't very strong so I think I'll double the walnuts next time. I meant to sprinkle with cinnamon as others did but I forgot there's always next time!These came out light, fluffy and very tender. Yum!

These are delicious! Easy to add a few things and try different variations depending on your mood..I threw in a few raisins and cinnamon and also used soy milk and they were great.

Yum! Big fluffy pancakes. Used all whole wheat flour. Reduced the maple syrup in the recipe since I knew we'd pour it on later. A keeper in my file!

This is my go-to pancake recipe. I make 1.5x for my family of 4 (the boys can throw down some pancakes...). I like to sub in ww for half of the white flour and we often include mashed bananas, then serve with strawberries sliced on top, which is absurdly good, especially considering how simple it all is...

These are so freakin' great! I made 6 larger pancakes and I ate four of them myself they were so good. I topped mine with strawberries and a very lavish dressing of maple syrup.I might add a dash of cinnamon to the batter next time...

If there is anything negative to be said about this recipe it is that the pancakes are so good, it is easy to eat too many! Wonderful recipe the way it is written, but I also made some changes in the last batch: I had some leftover whey from making yogurt cheese, so I used that in place of buttermilk; used 1/2 all purpose flour and 1/2 whole wheat, added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon & substituted pecans. Heavenly!! Had to watch the batter closely so it did not burn, as very few bubbles appeared to show the first side was done.

Best pancakes I've ever had! We substitute whole wheat flour for all purpose (gives them a better taste and texture, not to mention health benefits) and always add fruit to the batter (blueberries, bananas, apples, etc are favorites). We make these EVERY Sunday we love them so much!

This was excellent! I made a few changes: used half all purpose and half graham flour. I didn't have flaxseed meal so I used old-fashioned oats. Turned out great!

I made these for a group of women who cook for kids at daycares...we all just loved them! So delicious...I'll make these instead of regular boring pancakes anyday,

Wow! I have been so impressed by these healthy pancakes, I make them all the time. I use spelt flour instead of white bleached to increase the nutrition. When you do this you can also increase the buttermilk to 1 1/2 cups and add a bit extra maple syrup to make the pancakes a little bit thiner. I found they cook better this way.

Simply put: these were delicious and very easy to make. Had all ingredients on hand. Next time I'll use ww flour and I like the idea of adding a banana to the wet ingredients. Will definately not be buying premixed pancake batter again.

These pancakes are wonderful. Of all the pancakes recipes I have, this one is one of our very favorites. I make them without any changes and use Bob's Red Mill Whole Ground Flaxseed Meal. I always have this on hand in order to sprinkle two tablespoons over our cereals each morning.

I just made these for the first time this AM and was very happy with the great flavor of much healthier pancakes. Just as several other reviewers have done, I replaced half of the regular flour with whole wheat flour and topped them with bananas before serving... excellent! Next time I'm also going to add some cinnamon to the batter. No more pre-made pancake mix at our house!

Four forks for healthiness...unfortunately not as good in taste as a store-bought mix! Kind of dry and un-interesting, thus required lots of berries on top.

Every time we make these we say they are the best pancakes ever. I usually just use milk instead of buttermilk and still so delicious.

An excellent recipe - I used a previous reviewers recommendation of half whole wheat pastry flour and added frozen blueberries - healthy and delicous!

this was excellent!! i used honey wheatgerm instead of the flaxseed and added a little extra buttermilk because i thought the batter was too thick.....then threw in fresh blueberries while in the pan. they were scrumptious. will make them again this weekend!

A great, wholesome recipe. I substituted all of the AP flour for whole wheat pastry flour. I also added one whole smashed banana to the wet ingredients; I think the addition of blueberries inside the batter or made into a sauce to top with would be excellent - will try with next batch.

I love these pancakes and make them often. Only changes: I use whole wheat pastry flour instead of white flour and double the amount of walnuts. Since I'm a single woman, I freeze leftover pancakes and when I need them, warm frozen pancakes in the microwave for 30 seconds, then crisp them in my toaster oven for a few minutes. Healthy and really terrific!

the best pancakes ever! I also used soymilk and they turned out great. Even my picky 3 year old liked them.

WOW! I expected these to be quite grainy but I was very wrong. The flax and walnut taste is subtle an nutty and delicious. Do make these for a healthier pancake treat.

I love these pancakes! They're moist and delicious! I use organic whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour and it works just as well, if not better.

These were great filling pancakes. I substituted light soy milk for the buttermilk and oats for the walnuts since I have a little guy who doesn't always chew nuts so well. I also added one smushed banana and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. Very nice.

Sooooo gooood. So much omega-3 essential fatty acid, too! I replaced the buttermilk with unsweetened soy milk and topped the pancakes with cottage cheese and fruit preserves.

Loved them! I even changed the recipe a bit to make them even healthier and they were still yummy.I subbed 1/2 whole wheat pastry four for the white flour and reduced the salt by almost half. Out of necessity, I subbed 1/2 of the flaxseed meal for wheat germ. Served with sliced bananas and maple syrup. These are pancakes I would feel good about serving to my children on school days, not just the weekend, albeit with yogurt and fruit on top.

These pancakes are great! I didn't have flaxseed meal, so I substituted with old fashioned oatmeal ground in a spice mill. Still great. Light and fluffy and slightly sweet even without additional syrup. Will make again!

FLAVORFUL AND HEALTHY These were wonderful pancakes; nice airy texture, good flavor and hearty without being heavy. You could also add some fruit to the recipe (I made as written) without feeling like you were concocting something completely different. Rave reviews from the family!

Tasty, light and just the right level of sweetness. Excellent with raspberry jam.

Nice and hearty- the batter seemed to be a bit thick and the undrside browned before the bubble really appeared. Maybe I just didn't get the heat of the stove right. Here's a trick I learned from my mom- as we never have buttermilk on hand. Add some viniger to the milk and let it sit for a few minutes before adding it to the recipe. But I'd like to try the yogurt suggestions made by other reviewers.

This recipe is my pancake staple. They are great warm with butter and syrup or jam, and just as good as a snack without any toppings. I usually don't have buttermilk on hand, so I do the skim milk/plain yogurt combination... Today I used buttermilk and the flavor didn't seem different... if anything they were a little fluffier.

Delicious and healthy! After making this recipe once, my husband and I crave it every Sunday morning! I substitute 1/2 nonfat vanilla yogurt and 1/2 nonfat milk for the buttermilk.

Love the flavor and substance of these pancakes. Also tested well with my daughters, ages 4 and 7. Only alteration was for the buttermilk; I had none so I used 1/2 skim milk and 1/2 plain yogurt to replace it. Yummy.

Wonderfully nutty taste and really nice texture. These are pancakes of substance, not those light, starchy airy things drenched in sugary syrup.

Delicious! I love pancakes and adding walnuts and flaxseed to the receipe is a healthy way to make them guilt-free. For extra flavor, toast the walnuts. (The flax seed won't add much flavor to the recipe, but if you grind them yourself, you'll preserve much of the healthy omega-3 fats.)
