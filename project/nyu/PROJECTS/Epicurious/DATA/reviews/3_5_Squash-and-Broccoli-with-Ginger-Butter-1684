I didn't do a particularly impressive job of cutting the crystallised ginger for this, and so it tasted more like veg in butter with random ginger lumps. With veg as fresh and tasty as this, I'm not sure you need to add much - the extra ginger was a little overkill for me.

To the cook from Okanagan, BC - I would try this recipe with regular ginger (freshly shaved is best) instead of the crystallized ginger called for in the recipe. You'll get a much lighter taste to the dish, and the vegetable flavor should come through more strongly.

This was absolutely delicious. Didn't steam the veggies, used a lid one size smaller than the pan to cook the veggies in the butter. Also used twice as much crystallized ginger...first time my kids voluntary ate squash. Must try recipe!

I was intrigued by the use of crystalized ginger and decided to give this recipe a try. I made 1/2 times over on the sauce, added 3 steamed carrots, a mexican and italian squash and reduced the crook neck squash to one and the broccoli to 2 cups. I then served this at christian leadership meeting of 12, everyone loved it. I got great reviews.

I like all the ingredients in this recipe, but didn't like the recipe. The ginger butter tasted too dessert-like -- like a ginger shortbread that I make at xmas. The flavour was too cloying (not sweet, but overpowering) and didn't go with the vegetables.

To the cook from Boston: crystalized ginger is closer to candied orange peel than dried ginger. Somewhat akin to "Cotlets and Aplets" in texture, with a sugary crust and a strong ginger flavour. It's a very popular ingredient in Australian cooking and is delicious. Try to find some at your supermarket (I get it in the bulk section up here) and let me know what you think!

Neither my husband nor I are big fans of yellow squash or broccoli, but this recipe disguised it well and had great ginger and butter flavors.

I made this with dried ground ginger and it didn't have much ginger flavor. I'm going to try bottled ground ginger next time and cut veggies smaller to see if that was my problem.

Since I didn't have any squash on hand or crystalized ginger, I made it with just the broccoli and regular ginger. I liked it and my husband loved it. I'll make it again according to recipe ingredients. But it was quick and pretty tasty as I prepared it anyway.

Very interesting and unique combination of flavors. Since it has a slight sweet taste, proabably would be good with grilled or baked meats Even my husband who isn't a lover of yellow squash, thougtn this was really good!
