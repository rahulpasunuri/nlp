I didn't have a marinara sauce or white wine convenient, so I substituted a can of Italian stewed tomatoes that I did have. Added garlic and fresh basil per the recipe and topped it off with grated Parmesan cheese. Excellent and quick  about 5 minutes to prepare. Just enough time for the oven to preheat. As I also did not add wine, I did not have to reduce the sauce. This will stay on the keeper list for sure. Next time, will probably try it the conventional way it is written, but if you want a great main course in less than 30 minutes, this is great. Might even be 3-1/2 forks.

If you've got snapper that's so-so on the freshness side, this might be an excusable recipe. But the sauce is so overwhelming that it completely smothers any legitimacy that fresh snapper may offer. Spaghetti, yes, this would be just fine. But good fish deserves something far less dominant than red blob sauce.

Excellent and very easy to prepare! I used a tablespoon of minced garlic instead of pressed garlic cloves and it turned just fine.

Easy and quick to prepare & serve. Try with Basmati (Pari) rice cooked in Japanese rice cooker. Make sure you have fresh basil, & watch the salt when using prepared marinara.

My local fish market said to try the red snapper, so I bought two fillets, brought them home and found this recipe. I had never prepared red snapper before, but my husband was sure glad I did! This recipe was delicious, not to mention simple to prepare! I used prepared, minced garlic which was just as good. I wanted to give this recipe 3 & 1/2 forks.

Very tasty and easy to make. Easily made into a lower-fat recipe by carefully selecting the marinara sauce (I used a tomato and basil sauce with only 1 gram of fat). Also, be careful about salting the fish... the store-bought sauces tend to have enough salt in them already. Tasted great, prepared in 30 minutes or less, and a little left over pasta and sauce for a quick lunch.

Excellent!!!! Would never have believed something so easy to make could taste so good!!! Did add some red pepper to season the fish and added mushrooms to sauce....sooooo good!!! Can easily be served alone or made up with pasta and bread as a great dinner party dish!!!!!

Superb! So easy and so quick (prepare other dishes while the fish is cooking) and so healthy too. This tasted delicious and will now become a regular on our weekly menus. I used fresh bell pepper and substituted fresh oregano for the basil and it was still delicious. Highly recommended.

This dish was so simple and yet SO delicious. I also paired it with pasta and added a dash of red pepper flakes. and it also looked great in my pasta bowls ;-)!!

This dish was fabulous and easy -also a great starting point on which to improvise. I used fresh peppers instead of the jarred roasted peppers - both red and yellow, julliened, also peruvian onion, and mushrooms. Also substituted oregeno for basil. delish! I live alone and just saved the rest of the sauce for later in the week - perhaps I'll use a sea bass next time. Definitely recommend this!
