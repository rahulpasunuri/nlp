This recipe was very easy to make, and was delicious! I love eggplant parmesan, and I enjoyed how this was a healthier version with similar flavors. I had some fresh mint at home, so I was happy to be able to use it. The goat cheese was surprising, but definitely made the dish- I added a bit extra when reheating the next day. One thing I did that is not suggested is I pureed the tomato sauce. I found it made it easier to layer with the eggplant slices and spread over everything a bit better.

Very happy indeed to have come across this recipe! It is absolutely perfect for a filling vegetarian supper on the cheap. Somehow the sauce, even though the ingredients are really basic, is incredibly delicious (wouldn't mind making a pasta with it) and combines beautifully with the eggplant. The goat cheese adds the perfect tang. Can't wait to use the leftovers in a sandwich!

very disappointing. the dish didn't come together. the eggplants definitely should have been peeled. and i even made the sauce with fresh roma tomatoes.

Yum -- Made this using Chinese eggplant. I also had some ricotta left over so I mixed that with the goat cheese and layered it on top. I didn't have any fresh basil so skipped that. The dish was delicious. Flavorful and easy to make. We ate leftovers in an omlette the following day with some spinach.

Fabulous. Tons of eggplant and tomatoes in the garden now, so this is perfect for late summer & whatEVER will I do with all that eggplant?? We use fresh tomatoes (seeded & chopped) instead of canned, fresh oregano instead of dried, whatever cheese we have on hand (although feta and goat are best) and add the basil with the mint to the sauce. Foolproof and delicious. I wonder if it would freeze well. . . .

This is definitely going into our regular rotation of easy, delicious, healthy, quick, meatless meals to whip up on weeknights. Seriously tasty and could hardly be easier. My fiance doesn't even like goat cheese and he devoured this.

This recipe was a big hit as one of two main courses for a vegetarian dinner. I made it pretty much as written, but I did double the mint as suggested by other reviewers. It was a super sauce, and even with the extra mint, the sauce was still subtle and delicious. My only change for next time would be to slice the eggplant a little thicker - maybe 3/4 inch instead of 1/2 inch since it shrinks a great deal! I served this with the tofu phyllo strudel from this website, and it was a wonderful combination.

This recipe was a lot better than I was expecting. I made half the recipe because I only had 1 eggplant, and I used diced tomatoes. When I was cooking the sauce I tasted it and I just thought...hmm onions and tomatoes, this will be boring, but it certainly wasn't! I guess the flavors just blended together when it was baking. It was also really nice because I could put cheese on half (my boyfriend can't eat cheese). Will make again!

Excellent dish, I will definately make this again. The mint really makes this meal. So easy to make, I forgot the oregano (ran out) but the sauce still tasted amazing. Just as a precaution for those cooking with gas, 10 mins per side for the eggplant seemed a little too long I almost charred mine -watch it closely.

Wow, this was great! I thought I was going to be disappointed by this recipe because it is so simple, but it delivered big on taste. I followed the recipe to a tee, except for the addition of more mint as recommended by other reviewers. I found the eggplant to be perfect; not mushy, but tender and delicious. This will become a new weeknight staple for us!

We LOVED this recipe! Like some recommended, we added little extra mint and some red pepper flakes for a kick. I accidentally let the sauce reduce too much, so I mixed in a bit of chicken broth which worked out very well.

I liked this a lot, even though I'm not a big eggplant fan. The eggplant was tender but not sickly mushy. I added some wine, red pepper flakes, and brown sugar to the sauce. The mint is key. The recipe is like a lighter, healthier version of eggplant parmigiana.

This was good and easy to prepare; definitely an easy and tasty weeknight meal. Next time I'll probably try more mint as others have suggested.

I was really surprised at how easy this was to make and how wonderful it tastes! I doubled the amount of mint, as other reviewers suggested, with good results. I halved the recipe since I was only cooking for myself and ended up eating nearly all of it in one sitting. Will definitely make this again. Very little kitchen time required.

As a vegetarian, I am always eager to find satisfying, hearty recipes that are inexpensive, easy to make (e.g. not too much vegetable chopping), and - more importantly - that my carnivorous boyfriend will enjoy! Both of us loved this recipe. We added more mint, as suggested, and a little extra goat cheese to the top, which gives it a nice, salty kick. This will definitely become a standby busy- weeknight dish.

found this recipe a few years ago and have made it often since then... only change is to cook sauce about 40 minutes

This was easy, delicious and healthy. I subbed garlic & herb goat cheese, and forgot the basil. I enjoyed it a lot.

This is easy and good. But, I did use fresh tomatoes and the baking part took 35 min. I love eggplant and this recipe is a good and accessable weeknight way to cook.

Definitely a recipe to keep in our files. Only change, maybe add a bit more mint. Delicious and satisfying dish.

Wonderful dish! It has become a regular.

I was surprised how good this dish was since it uses mint as opposed to the standard basil/oregano Italian seasoning. I added a second 14.5 oz can of plum tomatoes because my beloved prefers more sauce and substituted crumbled feta in place of the goat cheese. Very tasty!

very pleased with this dish. Only change was adding 1/4 cup mint (an increase was suggested earlier). I will make it again and send it to a few of my friends!

I made this with a few changes. Less oil, added chicken, a shot of hot sauce, and used low-fat feta instead of goat cheese to make it weight watcher friendly. It was absolutely delicious. We are having the left overs on toasted low-fat sandwhich rolls tonight. Delish!

This was easy and good. Not gastronomic, but good comfort food. I didn't have goat cheese tonight, so I used parmesan. Served it with organic spelt pasta from Provence and it was a surprisingly amazing dinner. I can't wait to try it with the great goat cheese in this area. Also used olive oil instead of nonstick spray. Burned the eggplant a bit but it didn't matter. It's such a forgiving recipe. The mint and (I used fresh)oregano make it special, and the basil at the end is important. I would definitely make this for guests, possibly with lamb the next time.

Outstanding! I didn't have mint so I added lots of basil. I added a bit of good quality red wine to the sauce and I should have added a touch of sugar as one revewier suggested. So easy.

We love this dish...my husband is a huge fan of eggplant so I'm always looking for new recipes. The mint in the tomato sauce is very refreshing. Made exactly as recipe called for and was a great side dish. Would definitely make for company next time.

Since I'm not a goat cheese fan and the recipe sounded Greek, I substituted feta- yum! I like eating this hot with a flat pasta such as farfalle. When cold, it makes a damn fine sandwich in a pita. Messy, but delicious!

I loved this dish (and I am not partial to goat cheese). I really thought it complemented the flavors of the eggplant and mint well. I used double the mint and garlic, a touch of red pepper flakes, a dash of cabernet vinegar, and a little bit of brown sugar to kick the acidity. I would definately make this again. My husband also loved it!

I had a lot of eggplant to use up, and it disappeared quickly with this. The mint was a surprising, but pleasant flavor. My family enjoyed it and I definitely will make it again.

Pretty tasty - very fresh flavors. I added a little more mint and a bay leaf to the sauce while it simmered. Great with a simple green salad and crusty bread.

The sauce is great and it fills you up. I made this for my family and they all loved it. However, they all wished there was a side dish. So make sure to include some type of side dish. I would suggest something light.

This was delicious and very easy to make. I grilled the eggplant first, on a stove-top grill. After heating through, the flavor of the sauce and eggplant blend so well, you wouldn't even know it was eggplant. I brought this to a pot luck supper and it was one of the few dishes that was completely gone. Several people asked for the recipe! I will definitely make this again.

I'm not usually an eggplant fan, but this was terrific! I salted the eggplant slices and drained on paper towels to be SURE it wasn't overly soft, but I doubt it was necessary. This is definitely good enough to serve to guests.

A very good recipe and a great way to use up any extra mint one might have on hand. A tiny bit of freshly grated parmesan gives the top a nice texture/ flavor. I served this to a known eggplant hater, and he thought it was delicious!

This was really good. I grilled the eggplant which gave it a slightly smoky flavor. Two fresh vine ripened tomatoes were chopped and used in place of the stewed ones and simmered for about 5 - 10 minutes. Then back to the recipe. Great way to use eggplant.

This was a fantastic way to use eggplant in something other than a dip or using tons of olive oil to cook it. It was well balanced in flavors, easy to make and healthy! The mint in the sauce gave it a wonderful freshness! Will definately serve this to my foodie friends.

Fresh mint and oregano from my garden combined with the special flavor of goat cheese made this an easy winner. It was hot out, so I grilled the eggplant on my gas grill.
