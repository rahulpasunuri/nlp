This is a delicious recipe, especially with fresh strawberries in season. I agree with the other reviewer who uses a Cuisinart ice cream maker - the recipe makes too much volume for the tub to hold. I reduce the quantites by one third and it fits perfectly.

Loved this ice cream. I've made it many times and the first time exactly as recipe and than used half and half and whole milk and just half and half and just whole milk. All turned out excellent. Today I'm making it with blackberries.

Excellent ice cream. Followed recipe exactly. Very rich.

My only complaint is that it made way too much mix for my Cuisinart ice cream maker to hold.

I've been making ice cream for years but surprisingly I've never made one with fruit. When I decided to make peach ice cream, I spent hours scanning through recipes and reading reviews. Finally decided to take a stab at this one substituting the strawberries for a jar of canned homegrown peaches I received as a gift (about 4 1/2 cups). That was the only change I made. I must say that I was a little skeptical about the 9 egg yolks. Well, I just tasted my creation and I have to say it is the best peach ice cream I have ever had! I will use this as my standard base for any fruit ice cream I make going forward. Oh, I did have a bit of a problem with the custard breaking down a bit even on very low heat. This was remedied by the straining. Got a little nervous at first but the texture came out perfectly!

At first I was surprised at the proportion of berries this called for as compared to the milk and eggs. I thought it would be too intense a berry flavor. But it was actually perfect. Even those in my family who professed to disliking typical storebought strawberry ice cream loved it

Made with home grown fruit - this is the best strawberry ice cream I've ever had!

YUM! we had a bumper crop of wild strawberries this year, so i used them in place of regular strawberries, which gave this ice cream an incredible flavor. i also reduced the egg yolks to four, because nine seemed a bit excessive, and it was still super creamy and delicious.

The first time I made this (3 years ago) it turned out perfect! Each time I've made it after that I've had trouble with the custard breaking apart as it thickens. I wish I had read the review about putting the warm custard in the blender in order to save it before chilling. I am now convinced that I have been thickening it over too high a flame. It has never come to a boil, but the heat was, I think, still too high. So in the directions where it says "Return mixture to saucepan and stir over MEDIUM heat," I would change that to "stir over LOW heat." Hopefully that'll work better. When it works, it is truly the tastiest ice cream ever!!

this was probably the worst strawberry ice cream I've eaten. I don't completely blame the recipe. There is so much liquid in the strawberries it is very difficult to avoid getting ice-crystal filled ice cream unless you have a top of the line ice cream freezer. If I make ice cream again with juicy berries I will try and find dry ice to pack the finish product in immediatly after coming out of the ice cream freezing machine.

This recipe is the 4th one I've attempted since I bought my ice cream maker. The ice cream was fantastic. I had read that if the custard ever came to a boil, it was history. Today, I didn't pay close attention and it did come to a boil. I don't know how long it had been but I decided not to throw it away as my strawberries were almost "over the hill". I mixed the warm custard in my blender and then refrigerated it as requested. I doubt that my ice cream could have turned out any better. So....don't despair if you don't get it off the burner in time. It CAN be rescued.

This ice cream is so good it has become an annual tradition.

I haven't made this recipe (so kill me) but here is a tip for those who want some chunky strawberry pieces--macerate the cut-up strawberries with a little of the sugar for a while before folding in. This will prevent them from freezing quite so solidly so you won't have chunks of strawberry ice in the ice cream.

This is, hands-down, the best strawberry ice cream I have ever had.

Absolutely out of this world! I subbed one tsp Watkins double strength vanila at the end of the custard cooking instead of the bean. This worked great. Fortunately our local berries were available which gave this dish some outstanding flavor. I also recommend saving out a few berries to coarsely chop. The rich custard can use this textural counterpoint.

I enjoyed the ice cream tremendously. This recipe definately worked very differently than other ice cream recipes I have tried...they have not used a custard base. The ice cream was much creamier. Also, I pureed all the strawberries but set aside some of them which I chopped up and tossed in later prior to adding the puree to the custard. I really like the Breyers style strawberry that has big chunks of frozen strawberry. This method did not seem to alter the taste of texure otherwise.

Hmmm... This was my first attempt at ice cream and I can't say that I fell in love with this recipe. The texture of the ice cream was a little too custardy for my taste. I made the pistachio ice cream recipe this evening - now that's some yummy ice cream!

I made this strawberry ice cream for my husband's family reuniun using small intensely flavored berries my neighbor shared with me from her patch. The results were out-of-this-world. The usually boisterous crowd fell silent as they devoured the best strawberry ice cream we'd ever tasted. I will make use this recipe every summer from now on!

I can't believe no one's reviewed this recipe!! It is the most fantastic strawberry ice cream I have ever tasted (and I'm not a big strawberry ice cream fan)!
