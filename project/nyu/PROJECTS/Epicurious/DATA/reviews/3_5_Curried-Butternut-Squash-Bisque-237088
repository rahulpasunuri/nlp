I made this recipe as close to the original as I could, the only exception being that I was about 1/2 cup of squash short of the called-for 3 cups. Also, I was making this to try and use up the stash of butternut squash we got from our CSA, and I was looking for a recipe that my husband and I (not the hugest of squash fans) might enjoy. That said, here's my two cents: I think my red curry paste was a milder variety, as I needed to generously double the amount called for in order to taste it at all. Even so, I ended up adding a little bit of cayenne pepper to bring out the heat. I imagine that having a spicier curry paste would really affect the amount you should use, so tasting the paste beforehand is probably very, very important. Contrary to the advice of several other reviewers, I added both the whipping cream and the honey. I think that both were necessary to meld the flavors properly. The bisque was sweet without the honey, but the honey deepened and smoothed the flavor of the squash. The final thing that I think really *made* the soup was a generous quantity of fresh ground pepper added right at the end. I didn't end up adding any salt, but I did add probably at least a full teaspoon of ground pepper, and it made all the difference in the world. We'll definitely be making this again next time we find ourselves buried in squash.

Maesri red curry paste is THE best thai red curry and the only one I would ever use. This soup was fantastic and like other reviewers - I agree that the honey is not needed. I am making it again tonight but I am going to substitute coconut milk for the cream.

Made this tonight for pre-trick or treating Halloween party. Delicious! The bisque was sweet enough on its own that I didn't add the honey. I found the cream to be a great addition. Because I was serving this to a houseful of kids, I added half the curry and thought it still had a decent kick. Like others, I used a bit more broth to thin it just slightly. I will definitely make this again!

Everyone loves this soup when I make it. I use the canned Maesri red Thai curry paste and it gives the soup a wonderful flavor. One of my favorite soup recipes in my rotation and the hand blender makes pureeing a snap.

Super easy and tasty! I had home made chicken broth and used extra as suggested by others. I didn't have carrots, so skipped those. I put in a scoop of chili paste and cumin. The richness with some heat was very tasty. I was unsure of the sweetness with apples AND the honey, but it was a great balance. Will definitely make again and got raves on it.

Carmelized onions for deeper flavor. Used chicken stock instead of broth. Bisque was thickness of peanut butter- added more stock. Tasted better without pepper- Overall good flavor - would try again w/some tweaking.

This was sooooo yummy! I used 1 cup of apple and half and half instead of heavy cream and it was perfect. Like other reviewers, I would use more broth. I used the low sodium Pacific Natural Foods broth, and it did need a little more salt in the end. I used the Thai kitchen red curry and it was a perfect spicy level - had a little bite, but not too hot. If i ever make this for a dinner party, I will definitely put the sour cream in a squeeze container to make for a really nice presentation, This is a beautiful dish. I can't wait to make it again!

This was a wonderful starter for the Thanksgiving dinner. I added a little more chicken stock to thin out a little. Depending upon the sweetness you like, you should adjust the amount of honey. Instead of honey, I used maple syrup, and that worked out well.

I've tried quite a few butternut squash soup recipes, and this is one of my favorites. As the name implies, this is a bisque - so expect a thicker consistency. I made a couple changes this last time, which worked well. I used about 32 oz of chicken broth to thin it out slightly. I also substituted half and half for the heavy cream, and really could not notice a difference. Would also recommend that you taste the bisque prior to adding the honey, some squash and apples can provide enough sweetness so that you might now want to add the full amount of honey.

3.5 Forks it is! Pretty damn good and filling. I didn't have heavy whipping cream so I used half and half in stead. My boyfriend and I loved it!

I would give it 3.5 forks if I could. Thought it was a great taste of flavours. Went apple and squash picking and was looking for recipes to use all my goodies!!! My 10 mth old daughter ate this as well so I didn't put the honey in and put only about 1 tsp of curry paste. I also put a little more apple in simply because I have so many. I liked the idea of coconut milk but I thought it would be too similar to the spiced pumpkin soup on this site that I make all the time - plus there was something about apple and coconut that didn't seem right to me. http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/foo d/views/Spiced-Pumpkin-Soup-107258

Absolutely delicious! I was going to make half of a recipe, so I only roasted 2 small squash, about 2-1/4 lbs. total. When I scooped out the flesh, I had the 3 cups required by the recipe, so I made it all. We like curry, so I used over 2 tablespoons and it still wasn't overly 'hot' in our opinion. Unlike other reviewers, I think the added cream at the end was divine, and I used 1/2 cup because the bisque was too thick. Next time I will prepare with about 32 ounces of chicken broth. I make my broth with Better Than Boullion, so it was not low-salt, but as it turns out the salt was needed. I thinned the sour cream with a little cream and placed it in a line across the bisque and drug a knife through it a few times to make a beautiful 'swirl' effect. Instead of garnishing with cilantro, I sprinkled a little paprika which was beautiful on the sour cream swirl, then I sprinkled a few roasted sunflower nuts on top. Gorgeous presentation in a white bowl and served with a piece of garlic toast. The few sunflower nuts were just the right treat to bite into every once in a while. Glad that I grew over 100 butternut squash this year! I'll be freezing to make this bisque until planting time next year.

Great flavor. This could have used another 1/2 teaspoon of red curry paste (I love spicy) and the cream at the end isn't totally necessary. Time consuming but worth it!

This is so good. I reduced the amount of curry paste because my family does not like things too spicy but added additional to my bowl. If you like spicy use it all. Had a great flavor and the cilantro and sour cream on top were a great addition.

I love this recipe! I highly recommend the Roland Brand Red Curry paste. It's hard to find in New England, but worth it. The Thai Kitchen Brand is VERY hot. Not all curry paste is the same, so test it before you add it to see how hot it is.

Rating: 4
Very flavorful soup but the consistency was a bit like pureed baby food. I used half and half instead of the whipping cream and only a couple of teaspoons of honey and frankly it probably would have tasted just fine without it. Will definitely make again maybe with a bit more broth to thin it out.

All I can say is Mmmmmmm. Because of previous reviewers comments about the amount of spice (and already being a spice-wimp myself), I only added 1/2 tsp. of curry paste. The amount was just perfect -- detectable by a nice subtle kick in the back of the tongue and throat, while still being able to taste the sweetness of the apples and carrots. I added a bit more cream, more like 1/2 cup, and added 1/2 tsp. of good sea salt at the end. Delish!

I made this Bisque tonight but I doubled the recipe. I bought tiger curry paste and only added the 1 1/2 tsp per recipe but when I tasted it more was required. I ended up adding about two more teaspoons and it is wonderful. I did only add 2 tbsp of the honey because it was perfect with less. This will become a winter staple for us.

Rating: 4
If I could give this 10 stars I would, it is THAT good. I was practically licking the bottom of the pan to get every last bit of it. Only because I'm watching my weight did I use half/half instead of cream and omitted the honey (the apple gives it the perfect amount of sweetness). I am going to stock up on butternut squash and freeze diced up cubes - this is one recipe I'm going to be making all winter long!!

This was really excellent.Before adding the honey, I tasted, and decided not to add it, as the various vegetables had already given the recipe plenty of sweetness. And next time, I might skip the cream, the bisque would have been plenty rich without it.(And I definitely wouldn't make an extra trip to the store if I didn't have any on hand.) But wow, this was good.

This sooup has a nice kick to it. I used panang curry in place of the red curry since that's what I had in my fridge. I will definitely make it again!

This is a terrific recipe from which to start. I used coconut milk instead of cream, curry powder instead of paste, a touch of cayenne pepper, a peeled sweet potato, a handful of carrots, two large shallots, frozen winter squash (four boxes). Simmered for half a day, pureed then served with a touch of fresh whipped creme (unsweeted of course!) and toasted pistachio nuts that I chopped after toasting. Guests loved it!!! Quite a different recipe but the one here certainly served as inspiration.

I'm not a butternut squash connoisseur. I've had a couple of bisques and thought they were good but not remarkable. THIS was amazing! I thought I had red curry paste but only had green, so I used two teaspoons of curry seasoning instead of the paste. Very flavorful.

Awesome recipe! I made this twice...definitely recommend. Used a different spice, from but whatever you use, it gives it a great kick.

Great recipe, a really wonderful mix of flavors. 3 stars because I think the 2 t. of curry overpowers the other flavors. I agree with the other reviewers who suggest using 1 1/2 teaspoons. Normally I'm a big fan of spicy foods but this was a little too much. Also, since I was in a bit of a hurry I simmered the soup for only about 15 minutes. Came out great anyway!

really good! the heat of your curry paste is crucial -- taste it first to gauge how much to add to the soup.

love this! i actually prefer chunky soup so i didn't puree it at the end. substitutions: 1 can cocounut milk instead of cream. no honey. 2 cloves garlic. i also toasted the seeds in the oven with a light seasoning of cayenne and salt and topped my soup with it. wonderful!

This was a fantastic recipe; rich, creamy, with layers of flavor. I left out the honey, and garnished with cilantro and coconut milk (vs. sour cream in recipe). It had the perfect level of spice for our tastes. Could also be done with pumpkin for a slight variation.

It was good as a soup... but I think it would have been better as a sauce served with chicken or tofu and rice (this is how I will most likely use the leftovers). Then again, I didn't realize I didn't have quite enough squash until halfway through the cooking process, so I used about 2 cups of squash and 1 cup of spinach (frozen). I also halved the curry because we don't like things too spicy, and it had the perfect amount of heat and flavor. Didn't add honey, was sweet enough as it is.

Just wasn't interesting enough for us. Maybe my red curry paste is old. Ours was barely spicy.

I really liked this dish, and did not find it overly spicy at all. It was definitely hot, but not too much for my palate. I found the red curry paste added a really nice layer of flavor to the other ingredients. I did a 1/2 c of apple juice and 1 1/2 c of broth to get a little more sweetness in there.

This is the best butternut bisque. I wouldn't change think. Make sure to add the sour cream and cilantro to the top. It cuts the hotness.

Loved it and would make it again. I didn't have butternut squash so used acorn. Also next time I will reduce the curry paste by half.

We really enjoyed this warm soup - perfect for a cold winters evening! I left out both the whipping cream and sour cream. Instead, I reduced the soup until quite thick then added pure Maple syrup, in lieu of honey. When served, I added a drissle of maple syrup - it was a nice complement to the heat of the curry!

I just made this recipe for me and my husband - The results are: A little too spicy for even my husband who adores spicy food. I will cut down on the curry next time. When I did a taste test, I found it to be tart on the back of my pallet; distractingly so. I also found the soup to be lacking in depth. The only thing I could think of to remedy the situation was tarragon. So I added 2 TBSP of crushed dried tarragon and it completely transformed the soup. Because of the addition I did not garnish with cilantro. This addition made a fabulous, well balanced soup. Be careful with the curry, though. Enjoy!!

Hi, I thougtht this was really good, I made exactly as written. The only problem I had was that it was a little too thick at the end, I thinned it out with some 2percent milk but next time I am going to use about a cup or two more broth so that it's a more soupy consitency. But, all in all, very nice - I like it with a bit of shredded parm or gruyere.

We all found it absolutely delicious. I am fairly new to this website and I will read the reviews before making any recipe. Cutting the Red Curry Paste would have made it perfect.

If you like sweet and hot, this is for you. I think you could get the same effect with a little less red curry- like 1 1/2 teaspoons worth. Also, I used a homemade prosciuto stock that was wonderful.

Perfect soup for a winter night...I was over on the red curry paste by maybe 1/2 tsp and whoa! this soup had heat alright. Half and Half cream replaced the whipping cream as it was the only cream in the house (and I used closer to a cup)but ahhh what a soup! If I had drowned in that soup, I would have died a happy woman.

Delicious! Use a good quality curry paste. Look at the ingredients and avoid one with preservatives. The pastes with preservatives have a tinny or metal taste, not good eats. I used more curry paste since we like it spicy. The honey is a nice touch at the end as is the topper of sour cream.

For my palate, the Thai curry paste called for was just the right amount. It marries beautifully with the subtlety of the squash and the sweetness of the apple. I substitued Splenda for the honey, with no loss of flavor. My house smells DIVINE!

Tough to use the Red Curry paste. We love the curry flavor, but to taste it enough, you need a touch more than called for, however, that made it MUCH too spicy. I will definitely try this again if I can find Thai Yellow Curry paste (which I've not been able to so far...)
