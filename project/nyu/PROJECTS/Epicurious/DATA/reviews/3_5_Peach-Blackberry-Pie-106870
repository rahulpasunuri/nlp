To finely chop/gring the crystallized ginger, pulse it with the flour/sugar combination. This will allow for a more even distribution of the spice. I prefer to use the crystallized ginger (more than suggested) because it does add extra sweetness.

This pie was excellent but next time i would add a little more corn starch/flour. the cystallized ginger did not ground well so i settled for finely chopping...the flavor was excellent. I also added more blackberries then it called for which in retrospect I think i would stick to the recipe or cut them all together. blackberry and ginger did not go together quite as nicely. overall, I got great reviews...it was just a little too runny for my taste.

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday and he LOVED it. I used Pillsbury crust and no one could tell it was store-bought. It's definitely worth it to get the crystallized ginger. I used more blackberries than the recipe called for, and fewer peaches, which I recommed highly. More peaches and I think it would have been a bit too soggy.

It was very good. I rolled out the top crust and used a star-shaped cookie cutter to make stars that I overlapped on top. It looked so gorgeous. I used powdered ginger and found the filling a little too tart. Maybe next time I'll just omit it and add a little more sugar. Everyone else loved it though.

I made this pie with a few changes that I think turned out maybe for the better! Instead of peaches I used nectarines (and only 2 cups-peeled and sliced) then added about 1/2 cup of fresh blackberries, and added 1/2 cup-2/3 cup of fresh rasberries as well. Since the amount of berries was more than the nectarine, I added a teaspoon of corn starch to help soak up the juices from the berries. The nectarines were a shot in the dark, but they complement the berries well and aren't too sweet. The blackberries are pretty tart - but since the rasberries are nice and sweet, they balance eachother. I also used the ready -made 9" Pillsbury dough crust which I found was just as delicious as crust made form scratch and a lot easier if you don't have the time. I was really happy with the way it came out! I'm going to make this one again!

I took the advice of another reviewer and I used ground ginger instead of crystallized ginger. That worked, I guess. The ginger flavor was very subtle. This recipe is good, my 8 year old son loved it. The blackberries are a nice touch. I thought it could've been a little sweeter -- maybe it needs a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side. Easy to make.

Okay, I cheated. I used Pillsbury crust. But, after using the egg wash, my crust came out perfect. I also didn't use crystallized ginger, just added in about 1/2 teaspoon of powdered ginger. Excellent, and quickly consumed by two guys who are known to be picky eaters. A keeper for when you have good fresh fruit, and I promise next time I'll try to use the technique listed to make my own pie crust!

Another keeper for the recipe box. The ginger was almost too mild. I would recommend increasing it slightly.

So nice to find one of Sheila's recipes here! The only major adjustment I made was omitting the ginger. I'm sure it would taste terrific but my kids are too young to appreciate such a strong spice. I also ^ the berries & used less peaches, & added ~1t. cornstarch because I was afraid it would be too runny w/ more berries. The crust is flakey and the flavors are good inside and out! Easy to make too!
