I made this with a few adjustments - much less oil, half wine/half veg broth, and 3.5 oz lemon goat cheese instead of 7 oz feta. We had basil, rosemary, sage, green onions, and mint as the herbs. It was really delicious - tasted more interesting than I expected. I think the lemon goat cheese really made the dish, if I made it again and couldn't find the lemon cheese, I'd add some lemon rind to brighten it up. With the changes mentioned it'll be a frequent weeknight dinner in our house.

This was lovely; I used basil, rosemary, thyme and parsley. I think adding shrimp would be nice or perhaps some jumbo lump crab. I will definitely make this again.

Reduce oil to 2 tbsps. Add big dash of red pepper flakes. Use 1 red and one yellow or orange pepper for more color. Use 3/4 cup (or less) white wine. Add a handfull of kalamata olives at the end with the feta. Nice!

Love this recipe... easy and light... Be very generous with the fresh herbs. I used basil and tarragon and coarsely ground black pepper... This dish is even better the next day...

I made this recipe following the directions and really didn't care for it.

Very good, simple and light -- especially with these changes: I dramatically decreased the oil and used just a touch with some cooking spray for the peppers, since they will get most of their flavor from the garlic and white wine. I made only 1/2 pound, using a garlic and parsley angel hair I found at the health food store, and kept the same amount of herbs (used basil, parsley and a little sage), and used a fatfree feta that has sundried tomatoes and herbs in it. To melt the cheese more you might put the pasta with cheese in it on low heat for a minute. Serve it with a salad or to make it more substantial, next time I might even add arugula with herbs and some halved cherry or grape tomatoes. This is very simple and light for the few non-carb-phobics left among us ... just watch portion sizes because 1 pd for four people is an awful lot.

Wonderful! Used it as a side dish with a simple grilled fish. Definitely a great weeknight dinner, and helps use up the tons of herbs in the garden. To the person who said "tasteless" I cannot imagine how you could achieve tastelessness with this recipe!

The entire family enjoyed this. It was quick and easy, and different! I reduced the oil to 2T and still too much -- trim to 1/2 or 1T. Paired it with salad, bread, and cobbler for dessert -- WONDERFUL! Could even do it for company.

I used the oil from the oil-packed feta cheese I used. It made the whole meal way more fragrant, in a cheesy way. Also, didn't have that many fresh herbs. so i used fresh parsley and dried thyme and basil and oregano, still came out very tasty. i did not add the reserved water. i think it would have made it too watery.. Overall, this was so simple to make and very flavorful for the amount of effort. i will make this recipe again.

This is great pasta dish. I used fresh basil, sage & chives along with tomatoes. I also added spicy seasoning to liven it up a bit at the end. Served cold or hot, its tasty.

Made this for a quick addition to our grilled sausages. Loved the warm red pepper taste. I added a bit of hot sauce (from the bottle) to the pasta and tossed it -

This was a wonderful easy recipe to make with ingredients from our garden. I used basil, sage chives and rosemary with yellow peppers. Delicious and a boon to me since my husband is recovering from surgery and I need quick good food.

This is a fantastic recipe. It was extremely eas to make and the result was wonderful. This one is a definite summer recipe. The pasta is even great served cold.

It's recipes like this one that make this website great. Quick, easy and delicious. I used ziti pasta with fresh sage, tarragon and basil which helped as these are intense herbs. Also I chopped the red pepper into larger chunks than the photo. Next time I would like to add some kalamata olives.

It's OK, but I agree that it's rather bland. My husband liked it. I cut the recipe significantly since it was for 2 (can anyone really eat a 1/4 lb of pasta is one sitting?!), so I don't know about leftovers. I added a lot of black pepper to enhance it. Next time, I'll stick to the "assertive" herbs.

I did change this dish just a tad. I traded a red pepper for a yellow pepper (it added great color)and added sauteed shrimp. The outcome was fabulous! I would recommend this recipe to any cook, regardless of cooking ability. The recipe is very easy to follow and the result is a truly beautiful dish.

This was wonderful, beautiful to look at and got many compliments. Served it as a side dish with "Salmon with balsamic glaze". The fresh, finely chopped herbs in generous quantities are a must. I used parsley, basil and sage. Also substituted a yellow pepper for one of the reds (great colors!)

This dish is not bland. The secret is in the herb mixture. It is very flavorful. Add Crystal Suace if desired. It is difficult to criticize. Maybe add sun-dried tomatoes.

the first night we thought it was bland. we had leftovers the next day for lunch...wow, what a difference! all the ingredients really melded to wonderfully overnight. we did add red pepper flakes that added the needed vavoom.
