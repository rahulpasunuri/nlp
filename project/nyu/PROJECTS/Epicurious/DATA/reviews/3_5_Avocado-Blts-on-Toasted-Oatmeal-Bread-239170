Well this was a surprise. My Family sat at the table (MY lovely wife and 2 teenagers) and custom built their BLT. They were chattering away, ... when they started to eat the BLT everyone went silent. I was watching them all savoring the combination of tastes in that BLT. I can not remember the last time that happened ... They really enjoyed the sandwich. They asked me to make this again ... now that was great to here.

This made a really great dinner with a soup beforehand. I used veggie bacon for a vegetarian meal. Delicious.
