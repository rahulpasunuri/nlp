This is a great quick recipe for aioli that really livened up a quiet dinner at home for my boyfriend and me. I don't see the need to be snobby about the store-bought mayo. This was a great timesaver and tastes delicious. There's no reason you can't go ahead and make your own mayo if the thought of storebought horrifies you so much! I livened this up with cayenne, cumin, fleur de sel, and a very teensy amount of apple cider vinegar to brighten it up. The recipe seems endlessly versatile. A great way to impress company!

If you are planning an elaborate Tapas Party with a dozen guests make it from scratch. If your next door neighbour calls and invites you for an impromptu tapas party, make this recipe add a pinch of saffron, and roast some small red potatoes. And smile when you say thank you for your homemade aioli. And no one needs to get their knickers in a twist.

Very easy, but made quite a mess! Delicious, and very practical. My family used it as dip for veggies! It is really nice with lamb. I could think of 100 uses for it. It would be great smothered on lamb, and then grilled. The essence of the garlic would stay, with the fat of the mayonaise burning off. I used store bought mayo, that was made with safflower oil, and very low in fat, and the aioli tasted fine. It makes a lot, but it will go fast (good on sandwiches). A make again!

I love this recipe. I sometimes just dunk bread in it and eat it as such (I am a garlic maniac). To the reviewers who were horrified at store bought mayonnaise - I too prefer the taste of my own mayo but when time doesn't allow I buy the stuff in jars. What I don't understand is why u have to criticize other people? If u have all the time on your hands to make mayo that's wonderful for you but not everyone does. So why don't you make the recipe with your homemade mayo and stop being so silly over something so small as a recipe.

after I grew and pressed my olives from my olive orchard into olive oil, I dug up only the freshest cloves of homegrown garlic and gathered eggs from my perfect aracona hens and carefully made my own aioli in my antique french mortar and pestle. It was **WONDERFUL** served on bread made from flour I milled my self from the wheat I grew on my farm using only natural yeast that I gathered from the wild.

Oh get over it, cooking snobs! If you think spending your evening whipping up your own mayonaise makes you a real cook, you are sorely mistaken.

Where can I buy this "Mayonaise" that everyone is speaking of? It sounds truly exotic!

should be called trailer park aioli, but then again, sometimes that extra 10 minutes helps.

why not make it easier? Buy store mayonnaise and chopped garlic and just mix together but please don't call it alioli, just garlic mayonnaise.

Obscene to make it with storebought mayonnaise. Too lazy to make your own or what ?
