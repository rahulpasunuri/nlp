I used creme fraiche, which is available cheap as Crema Mexicana if your store has a Mexican cheese section in the deli case (Cacique Brand), you can get 16 oz for around 3 dollars, it comes in a tall plastic jar. You can also make your own. In Mexico, this would definitely be made with creme fraiche, this recipe is just trying to imitate it.

I served this in warm flour tortillas with Blackened Halibut & cabbage salad. Store bought fresh salsa on the side. Very good.
