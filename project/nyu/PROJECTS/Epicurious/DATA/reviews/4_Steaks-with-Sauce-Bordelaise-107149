I read the reviews regarding the use of marrow in the bordelaise sauce and was surprised that one reviewer referred to marrow as "solid fat." For your information marrow is a soft but fatty gelatinous "tissue" found in the leg/shank bones of animals. It is NOT solid fat per se. Marrow is used in the making of gelatin (that is, JELLO).

I looked up other versions of this sauce and found many variations. I decided to follow this one and omited the parsley and added a few sprigs of thyme( a good choice I believe). I reduced the sauce and pressed it through a "chinois"-- a strainer. It was good, but, I experienced an aftertaste coating on the roof of my mouth, an almost grease like coating. It may just be my taste, but I think I would prefer a balsamic vinegar-red wine reduction along with some shallots and some nice portobello or shitake mushrooms, rather than the marrow. I do believe it's worth the effort to try and decide for yourself. As far as side dishes, I had steamed asparagus--chilled with arugala and parmesan shavings with a shallot-lemon juice-zest-sherry vinigarette, sauted green beans and garlic in extra virgin olive oil, and, home fried new potatoes with oregano and a bit of parmesan sprinkled on top. A good cabernet goes well with this meal.

The bordelaise sauce was good, but after making it, I realized how much fat was going into it and couldn't enjoy it. I did not tell my guests and everyone liked it. No requests for the recipe though, and thats one of the standards I use for a truly great recipe, a keeper. I had never worked with marrow before, so I guess I was naive, didn't expect marrow to be solid fat.

This is a popular request with my regular dinner guests. Not only would I make it again, I have made it several already and would highly recommend it especially for chilly fall days with hot crusty bread and a full bodied red wine.

Made this at the request of my 17-year old son for his birthday. Ymmmm!!!! The sauce texture was creamy and the flavor enhanced a great steak. Would definitely make again and great for company.

Question for you reviewers: I want to make this for my husband. Will the meat 'hold' while we have a glass of wine, an appetizer, etc? Or must I leave the table to finish the steaks in the middle of the meal? Thanks

This sauce is incredible! My guests went on and on about it-and they regularly travel to Bordeaux because of the food. Am definitely making this again for company next weekend.

I agree with all. This is a delicious dish. The marrow is a nice addition to our usual reduction sauces.

This was wonderful! I made the creamy potatoes and the mushrooms that were featured with it and everyone raved. I would definitely make everything again.

Now I know why I heard a chef once remark that marrow is the 'butter of the gods'. The sauce is heavenly, rich and tangy. This recipe is superb, definitely something to serve company. .....and I didn't change a thing.

This is delicious, very "bistro". The marrow makes a velvety sauce. Add some homemade "frites" and some steamed spinach, and this will become your new comfort food.

The dish was tasty ( and rich). We used NY strip steaks and bought beef bones for the marrow and stock. The mushrooms were a good accompaniement. I would only make this again for a special occasion.
