I made this several times. This is genious because it is very easy to make and at the same time it looks like you spend hours making it. I disagree with 1st person who said it was sloopy. I think it looks rather rustic and its not supposed to look sleek and meticulous. Ice cream is the last choice for desert for me. But adding nuts and crunchy cookies just attractive enough for my taste buds. I preffer additing more nuts and cookies and i think the darker the chocolate ice cream, the better the end result is.

Made it, it turned out well, looked better than photo here. Tasted great. BTW I think it's very snotty to leave a review like the LAST person did without even making the recipe. Talk about pretentious.

This is severely poor plating. It looks like it tastes good, but it is just not an attractive picture. Something needs to be done to the icing to make it flow smoothly it to a shiny round shell. Also, instead of a single cherry stuck in it with the stem up like some sort of antenna, I would place two or three cherries on top of a bed of chocolate leaves.
