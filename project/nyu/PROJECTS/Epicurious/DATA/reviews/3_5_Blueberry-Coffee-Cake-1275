I wish there was a rating for "horrible". I felt the coconut and blueberry comination was just awful. As I reread many of the reviews, the higher ratings came from people who eliminated the coconut. I wish I had done so! I added walnuts, unnecessary if you are usng the coconut as you'll have lots of texture, and also lemon zest , which just compounded the horror! I will have to throw this out. Also, wish I had seen the oven temp correction. I baked it at 350, assuming the 357 in the recipe was a typo, and it took 15 min longer. A sad, sad waste of ingredients and time.

Another four star rating. I've baked this coffee cake twice, once with blueberries, once with raspberries, and followed the recipe to the letter. But I would make two suggestions: 1) put whatever fruit you choose on the very top of the batter (it will sink guaranteed), and 2) half way throw the baking time cover the pan with aluminum foil to avoid burning the topping. Each time I've served this I was asked for the recipe. It's a winner!

Made this with fresh blueberries, skipped the coconut topping & just sprinkled Cinnamon & Sugar on top before baking. Excellent!

I love this recipe and make it whenever blueberries can be had fresh picked locally. It always gets rave reviews. Note to Epicurious: the temperature (357) needs to be corrected to 375.

Delicious and perfect for a special breakfast/brunch. I used organic frozen wild blueberries which have a very intense flavor. I added 1 tsp of ground cinnamon to the batter and 1/2 cup walnuts to the topping.

I made a GLUTEN FREE version that was scrumptious! I followed other users' suggestions and cut the sugar in half, adding the zest and juice of a lemon. For the flour I used 1 part each of brown rice flour, tapioca starch, garbanzo bean flour, and almond meal, with a teaspoon of xanthan gum. My preference is to put all the fruit on top right under the crumb mixture. The cake was sweet, moist, and my whole family loved it! Next time I would use a smaller pan for taller slices.

I just made this coffee cake over the weekend and it was wonderful. After reading the reviews, I baked in a bunt pan for 55 minutes at 375 F. I used fresh blueberries and floured the blueberries in the bottom layers. I greased and floured the pan. I layered the topping in the bottom. I substituted 1 cup of chopped walnuts for the coconut. Next I layered a portion of the blueberries. Followed by about 1/2 the batter. About half of the remaining blueberries, then the rest of the batter followed by the remaining blueberries. I made the following changes to the batter: I used 1/2 cup sugar and 6 tablespoons of butter. I added 2 tbsp of lemon juice and 1 tsp of vanilla to the batter. I also happened to have buttermilk on hand and substituted that for the milk. It came out great, but note the cake is crumbly and it will break easily. Everyone that has had it loved it.

Could not ask for more out of a blueberry coffee cake. I made this exactly per the recipe. It was moist, tender, excellent crumb, not too sweet. I will definitely file it away for those occasions I need a coffee cake for a brunch or a work event.

I used unsweetened coconut, 1% milk, and 10 ozs of frozen blueberries, and it turned out FANTASTIC. It seems like it would make great muffins.

Any time a recipe has a page of "fix this" it should be a bit of a red flag. I tried the spring form pan, the lemon zest, vanilla. It was a good enough coffee cake, but after all the fussing, not sure it was worth making again.

Rating: 4
The recipe was wonderful. I listened to the previous reviews and used less sugar. However, I also used skim milk and unsweetened coconut and thought the cake was sweet enough without being too rich. Peaches were in season, tossed with flour and layered along with the blueberries between the cake and crumb topping. A big hit at brunch.

Rating: 0
THE BEST coffee cake I have ever had. Let me tell you, I used shaved unsweetened coconut, so it was a little more coarse, but it was great topping. Also, didn't have milk but I did use almond milk and fresh picked blues. SOOOOO good! A true hit at the gathering I made it for. I also use fresh grated lemon peel and about 1 tsp lemon extract.

I added lemon zest and vanilla to the batter. Best recipe for blueberry coffee cake I've found so far!!

Rating: 4
This is most deliscious...the only change I made was to add lemon zest and a few tbsp of lemon juice to the batter. I halve the batter and layer all the blueberries in between with a few plops of toping all over than continue with other half of batter and topping. I also bake it in a spring form pan which takes, 70 minutes or so but I think it makes the cake look more elegant when serving to guests. I have made this many times with rave reviews.

I took this cake to a church activitiy. Everyone loved it! I didn't have blueberries, so I used frozen saskatoon berries. Also I made a couple of suggested adjustments. I added vanilla, and orange vest. I also decided to use cake flour instead of all purpose flour. It turned out so tasty and moist.

This cake is moist and delicious and everyone raved about it. I added 1 tsp. vanilla and about the same amount of grated lemon peel to the batter as suggested by other reviewers. I also substituted pecans for the coconut in the topping to satisfy pickier eaters, but coconut sounds fantastic and I'll try it next time.

Rating: 4
This was a hit at the office. I took the advise of previous reviewers..... added blueberries to the top of the batter instead of mixing in. Also, added juice of one lemon to the batter and lemon zest and pecans to the topping. I always try to decrease the amount of sugar and so used only 3/4 cup.... Very good!

Rating: 3
This is very good. The only problem I had twice was in omitting the coconut the streudel becomes too moist and the cake ended up rising around it and swallowing most of the streudel. Next time I will do more flour and used chilled butter which will make it more crumbling. This cake is very very moist. I added 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla and I prefer to oil and flour cake pan. I think buttering it makes the outside too hard. Also, I cut the blueberries in half and it was plenty. The 1st time I made it it was too sweet and I thought WAY too many blueberries.

This is one of my favorite easy to make cakes. It is always a huge hit at work. I usually replace the coconut with chopped pecans and add some cinnamon and orange zest to the batter, but it is very good exactly as written as well.

Excellent- so moist and delicious. Per some of the other reviews and to make it lighter, I made the following changes- I substituted 1/4 c unsweetened applesauce for half the butter in the cake, 1/2 c fat free vanilla yogurt for half the milk, 3 egg whites instead of 2 eggs, and only used 3/4 c sugar. I also used a springform pan. I didn't have time and berries aren't in season- but this would look beautiful with sliced strawberries or raspberries on top with a dusting of powdered sugar.

Rating: 0
This is a really good cake and I am pretty picky! I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and the zest and juice of a medium- sized naval orange to the batter. The vanilla and the orange gave it SUCH a nice flavor. I think without these 2 ingredients, you end up with a a sort of plain yellow cake. It would be good with lemon zest too, if you prefer that over an orange.I also prefer baking it in a 10" springform (vs. a 13x9" in pan) for about 1 hour.

Rating: 3
A very nice coffee cake and a great way to use up the berries you picked this summer and froze! I omitted the coconut because of fussy family members. Definitely use the pan size stated in the recipe -- I baked at 375 for 45 minutes. A smaller pan will up the baking time. Also, to the cooks who aren't accustomed to cooking with blueberries: Leave your frozen berries frozen, even if they are coated with frost -- the frost won't hurt the end product! If you thaw them they will sink during baking and make a mess of the cake.

Rating: 2
Well, after reading all the reviews, I took the advice and revamped the recipe. It was amazing. First, I added zest of one lemon to topping and didn't use coconut. Then I added zest of one lemon to batter and omitted the cinnamon. Instead of 1 cup milk I used 1/4 c. lemon juice and 3/4 c. milk. It curdled to make buttermilk and made the batter real creamy. Instead of mixing berries into the batter, I placed all the berries on top of the batter then sprinkled the topping over the berries. I baked it in a 10" springform for 1 hr. at 375 deg. In conclusion, I came up with a flavorful, moist cake with all the berries on top encrusted in the yummy topping. I brought it to my bookclub and every last crumb was eaten! In my opinion, blueberries always need some citrus to perk them up. It was great. Try it this way, you'll be the hit of the party.

Delicious, not overly sweet but as others have said, it took much longer to cook than stated @ 375 degrees.

The cake was moist but tasted bland. Although it rose in the oven, it became dense upon cooling. Perhaps some buttermilk or sour cream subbed in for regular milk would make it tastier. I don't know what would lighten the density.

Rating: 3
This is a very good recipe despite a few problems with the way it is written. I wasn't clear if the recipe called for 350 or 375 degrees (as 357 seemed like a typo). I baked it for 40 minutes at 350 and it wasn't even closed to done. The timing needs fine tuning. Additionally, I would like to find a way to prevent the berries from sinking to the bottom. A friend mentioned that dusting the berries with flour should do the trick. As written, the berries fall right to the bottom of the pan. As per the suggestion of other reviews, I used a spring form pan which worked well. I chose to omit the cinnamon in the topping as I thought it would overpower with cinnamon flavor. I will certainly make this again-- with fine tuning this can be excelllent.

I was really excited to try this cake, but I noticed a typo, 357 for the oven temperature. I wasn't sure if it was 350 or 375. I just want to make sure, so that I don't mess it up. Does anyone know?

Lovely Coffee Cake! Not too light, not too dense. Favourful! I used a 10" springform pan and layered the blueberries in the middle. If you want to feel like a pro, this is your dessert.

This was fabulous! I made the topping without coconut (because I didn't have it). I also cut down the butter and sugar somewhat: used 1/3 cup butter in the topping, and 2/3 cup butter and 2/3 cup sugar in the batter. I thawed and rinsed the frozen blueberries, and assembled in layers as recommended. Baked in a 10" springform pan for 50 minutes at 375--came out perfect. It's the new standard for coffee cakes at my house.

Rating: 3
If you use frozen berries, try thawing them, rinsing them and allowing them to dry. Will help with the "blue" color in the cake and will cut down on the moisture. As other reviewers suggested, I layered the berries and this seemed to keep them from sinking. Also, added a few tablespoons of lemon juice and the zest of one small lemon....

This is really, really good. I will note that the 13x9x2 produces a very thin coffee cake, which is not my preference. I make this recipe in a 10" spring-form, which works beautifully. Enjoy...this is a keeper; I continually hear, "...this is the best coffee cake I have ever had".

I did notice the blueberries sank a little to the bottom, but not sure what the big problem with that is.

I used fresh farmer's market blueberries and this was delicious. The only thing that I did wrong was to use a 9 x 9 ceramic dish. The center didn't cook all the way through. Next time I will definitely use the 13x9x2 pan as directed.

Super Easy Recipe. I used brown sugar in batter which helped not make it too sweet. Made this twice already w/in a week. 1st time as a cake with granulated sugar in the batter and 2nd time as muffins with brown sugar in the batter. I like the muffin version better. Just cook them for 20 minutes instead of the 40 minutes. The batter made about 20 something muffins. Everyone in the office raved about them, couldn't eat just one muffin.

This was an easy recipe, using ingredients most people would have at home. The only drawback was that all the blueberries sank to the bottom. The batter itself didn't have much flavor, either. The coconut crumb topping is excellent, though, and a welcome addition to the cake.

For a low fat version I substituted light butter and Egg Beaters; plus, used 1/2 cup soy milk and 1/2 cup light sour cream instead of plain milk. The result- a moist, dense coffee cake with a kick. Lemon zest added to the topping balanced out the sweetness and provided some extra zing. Yum!

It is a great cake to make if you have lots of berries on hand!

I've made this cake since the recipe first appeared once or twice a year and we've always enjoyed it. If you like blueberries and coconut, give it a try. The only negative is it doesn't keep as well as other cakes. It gets moist on the bottom quickly, so it's best to serve at a brunch or bring to a gathering where it will all be eaten that day. It's good for two days or so after baking before becoming too moist. Half of it can be frozen for smaller servings. I've also used half frozen cranberries when I didn't have enough fresh blueberries on hand, which was good, too.

This is terrific! I've made it twice, and every loved it both times. Folks: Why are the words frozen and unthawed difficult to understand? It's two ways of saying the same thing. The berries are to be frozen; do not thaw them. If you've ever made anything from thawed blueberries (berries that have been frozen and are now thawed, you know that it turns the batter blue. That effect is lessened if you leave them frozen. Once you start cooking a bit more that will become something you read very often. Hopefully it worked out ok for you - - this recipe is really good.

Yes, I can't help but wonder what "frozen, unthawed" means, since "thaw" means: "to go from a frozen to a liquid state : MELT b : to become free of the effect (as stiffness, numbness, or hardness) of cold as a result of exposure to warmth" (copy & paste from http://www.m-w.com/)

This coffee cake was incredibly moist and I even cut back on the amount of butter used. I used cranberries and blueberries, it was an interesting combination.

Would have been 2-1/2 forks, if that were an option. Will definitely experiment with this recipe; "Squeeze" liked it a lot. But as someone who has been baking for 45 yrs. (since 3), I'm not satisfied. Studied other reviews carefully... Used a 10" springform pan, for nice presentation on cakestand. Floured the berries, per advice, but they did sink nonetheless. (sigh) VERY moist --perhaps too much so... despite using 1/3 less butter and 3 egg whites in lieu of 2 whole eggs. Today is day #2, and it's a bit sodden (toaster oven?) Blueberry season here in NJ, and not keen on pie nor muffins for health reasons, so will definitely try at least one more time. (Plus make lotsa jam :-)

I've made this three times now and everyone always wants the recipe. It is sooo good! I flour the blueberries and sometimes they sink, sometimes they don't. Go figure. It's delicious regardless. I double the topping for added crunch. This one is well worth the small effort it takes to make it.

I also coated the raspberries in a little flour per the previous suggestions. They did not sink. The cake was extremely moist, almost a little on the dense side. Not sure if that was due to the berries or not but this was well received at the office and everyone loved it. Will make again!

Followed this recipe exactly - no changes - & it certainly does make a delicious, moist, aromatic coffeecake. Mine took a good 5 minutes longer to cook, but that could have been my oven. My only problem was the blueberrries (I used frozen) falling right to the bottom of the cake. This wasn't a major problem on day one, but by the next morning, they'd formed an almost jam-like layer on the bottom of the baking pan, which detached itself from the cake as I tried to lift slices out. Still tasted great. Next time I'll avoid cutting corners & dust with flour, as suggested by an earlier reviewer !
