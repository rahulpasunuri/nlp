My husband's aunt always makes a version of this for the holidays but I'd never tried it. This is like a chocolate cream pie, with no cream! I'm not a pecan pie fan and I really like it. It's really easy for anyone new to baking.If you buy pie crust it's even quicker.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was a huge hit. Followed advice of others and used 2/3 c semi-sweet chips instead of bittersweet chocolate and added 1 tsp vanilla to the egg mixture. So easy, so rich. This is my new go-to pecan pie recipe.

I made this for bookclub and there wasn't a crumb left. It was easy and delicious. I used a pillsbury pie crust to make it even easier (the kind by the butter section). I will definitely make it again. My family wished I had made two!

I made this for Thanksgiving and thought it was so great! Excellent texture and strong chocolate flavor. I added the vanilla as others suggested, used semisweet chocolate, and sprinkled some chocolate chips over the pecans before adding the filling (also as suggested). Perhaps it was the chips, but I would describe this as a chocolate chess pie with pecans, not a pecan pie. Other than the texture, it didn't taste like traditional pecan.

Just made this for Thanksgiving and it was wonderful! I used a family recipe for the pie crust, but the filling was the same. I did whisk in 1 tsp of vanilla with the eggs as some others suggested. The pie had a wonderful and intense chocolate flavor, and the texture of the filling was smooth and consistent.

Everyone loved it, but not to my taste. It was "good", as the descriptor for 2 forks say, but not "delicious" (i.e. 3 forks). I substituted dark corn syrup for the light, as other reviewers have done. Very easy to make.

I added the whole chocolate chips before baking as well, and served with a caramel sauce made for apple dipping. It turned into a "turtle pie". There was not a crumb left. I cheated and used pillsbury crust- there were no complaints!

I made this for Thanksgiving. Even my pecan pie "purists" loved this recipe!

Followed previous recommendations: doubled bittersweet chocolate, substituted some molasses for corn syrup, and added 1 tsp. vanilla. Also cut back sugar a little and toasted extra pecan halves to arrange nicely on top. Excellent and very popular at the special event (wine tasting, goes well with port). Served with whipped cream. Definitely recommend making this!

This was a hit at thanksgiving in Austin, in spite of leaving it in the oven an accidental extra 50 minutes (thanksgiving red wine). Generally this recipe copes with being fooled around with. Moist, flavoursome, and decadently chocolatey.

Okay, I love chocolate and as well as our local pecans. I used bitter chocolate and added 2 Tablespoons of brown sugar and 1/2 tsp. of vanilla. Baked @ 330 for 55 minutes. Absolutely loved the results.

I had an extra disk of the Easy Pastry Dough (recipe from this site) and decided to give this filling a shot - easy, very rich and quite delicious. I prefer bittersweet chocolate to cut the sweetness of traditional pecan pies. I used Scharffen Berger chocolate and light brown sugar - will definitely make this one again.

Unbelievable!! This must have been the best dessert I've ever made. I used a store bought crust and added 1/2 tsp vanilla. Other than that, I followed it to the letter. Rich, but not too heavy.

Wonderful pie. I followed the directions exactly, except for adding chopped pecans to the pie crust.

I've used this recipe three times this holiday season and had great results. At a thanksgiving party several people stashed slices to take home. I always have to cook it for more like 70 minutes. I do the toothpick check, if it's too runny I keep baking.

Delicious! Don't take this the wrong way -- I had to toss the last 1/4 of the pie, only b/c I could not stop eating at long after my guests were gone...

Sublime! My guests loved it. Not too sweet, not too sticky, it was just right. I made the following changes: Pillsbury refrigerator crust,added 1 teaspoon vanilla, used 2 cups pecans, 3/4 cup syrup, and 2/3 cup Nestles's semisweet choc chips. I also added an additional 1/4 cup of chips, unmelted, right before pouring the mix onto the pecans. Made the whole thing in a blender, going only 2 to 3 seconds after adding the whole chips. Melted butter/choc in the microwave-very easy, but you have to watch carefully because the choc will retain its shape after it is melted-it doesn't look melter- and burns easily. Use 10% power and start with 30 seconds and then add by 10 seconds. I baked 60 min total, covering crust with foil after 20 and removing foil for last 5. I served it cold, with vanilla whipped cream. This will have a permanent spot in my list of top desserts.

I used to make a chocoate pecan pie and was horrified to find that after I had promised to make it for Thanksgiving, I hadn't gotten to keep the cookbook in the divorce. Well, this pie SOUNDED similar enough, and it was delicious. In a household where there were five other pies, this one disappeared in no time at all. Easy to make, this pie will guarantee a repeat invitation if you bring it to the next dinner party you attend.

What a waste of fine ingredients, especially the pecans. I baked the pie for 55min at 350F, then for another 30min at the same temperature & it never setup. It was quite syrupy & overall was disgusting. I think, I'll just stick with apple pie for the time being.

I made this for Thanksgiving 2004. It was a huge hit w/ my guests. I will definitely make it again. The crust tasted good but was very hard to handle.

Rich but not too sweet. Have made it with pecans and also with walnuts - works well with either. Definitely best served warm. I made this pie recently for a pot-luck at work and received lots of positive feedback. And what I like about this recipe is that it is so easy to do! BTW- the missing measurement for the corn syrup is 3/4 cup - I got the recipe from Bon Appetit originally.

This is a FANTASTIC pie! I made it for the first time and received OOH's and AAH's galore. I used semi-sweet chocolate chunks and only melted half with the butter, keeping half of them whole to bake in the pie. I also used a pre-made crust which worked just fine. I'll definitely make this recipe again!

This one got rave reviews from my guests; it was not too sugary like most pecan pies. I used a store-bought crust, 1 cup corn syrup (b/c of the missing measure I guessed) and 1 cup (~6oz) of chocolate chips. Easy to make and a great use for those pecans straight off the tree!

I liked this pie more than I thought I would. It was not as sweet as I was worried it might be. I did make a couple of changes to the recipe. I used light brown sugar instead of dark, and to compensate I substituted 1/8 cup of molasses for light corn syrup ( for a total of 1 cup).

This is a very simple and great tasting pie. I have made it before and am planning on making it again this Thanksgiving. It is great served warm with a scoop of Blue Bell Homemade Vanilla!

I took the advice from another the person who reviewed this recipe in 7/00 and used 8 ounces of chocolate instead of 4 ounces, I found that it made this pie way too rich. Will stick with the 4 ounces next time.

very simple to make and my husband the pecan/chocolate fiend of the household has rated it a definate "keeper"

The missing measurement for the corn syrup is 3/4 cup. I found this pie to be lacking in chocolate punch. Next time I would increase the chocolate amount to a total of 8 ounces. I would use any combination of unsweetened, semisweet or bitter chocolate. Upon serving try a dusting of praline powder or a drizzle of carmel sauce on the side.
