I LOVE this lamb shank recipe! I cook the shanks about an hour longer so they are "fall off the bone" delicious. I also add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice and fresh, chopped rosemary. When I add the artichokes I also add a drained can of white beans. YUMMY!

My husband and I love lamb shanks and have them often in the cold weather up here in the finger lakes. With all the positive reviews we thought we'd try this one. What a mistake. The flavors are off. Going back to the best - Tom Valenti's on this site.

p.s. I have never had to take the meat out and reduce the sauce as it can take about two hours to cook and the sauce is usually quite thick.

This is a great dish for entertaining or make ahead weeknight dinners. I buy julienne sun dried tomatoes to save time. I also sub boneless lamb stew meat since the shanks can be quite fatty. I add 1/4 C red wine when I add the broth and tomatoes. I also add 1 T of dried basil and 1 T of dried oregano. I have always received rave reviews with this.

Excellent and very flavorful. However, the lamb shanks need to be cooked for much longer in order to be very tender - I had them in the oven for over two hours and ended up having to turn up the heat to 400 as my guests were beginning to starve! I served with the creamy parsnip mash and the peas with mint, which went well.

Very straight forward. Put it on top of couscous (chicken stock + parsley). Next time I'll try it with chicken. My (Australian) husband who likes the taste of lamb thought the sauce masked the flavor.

I was very scared of making this, since I have never made lamb, and most restaurants even get it wrong. This dish was fantastic: it tasted amazing (think restaurant-style with the best mixture of tomato flavors) and was incredibly easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly except that I started the stove cooking in a pressure cooker and then (instead of transferring to the oven) put the weight on the pressure cooker for ~15 minutes. It took a total of 40 minutes to prepare and tasted amazing!! Even my very picky husband loved it.

I think they've edited the recipe and added the part about taking out the lamb and reducing the sauce. I've made this about a dozen times by now and don't think the reduction is needed. Feel free to skip it!

Boy, this was good. My husband said it was like something you'd get at a bistro in Europe. Throw in a little extra lamb to have the next day -- it's really good left over. I used one cinnamon stick and canned artichokes, quartered, instead of marinated ones. Cooked for 2 hours, served with saffron rice and spinach for color. The sauce cooks down a lot and everything's all melty. mmmmmmm.

A wonderful cold-weather dish! I used both sundried tomatoes and artichokes which were not packed in oil, and it was absolutely fabulous. I also threw in a can of rinsed cannellini beans, which seemed a natural to me, and fresh rosemary. A definite keeper!

I am not a big lamb fan but wondered if anyone has tried this with chicken. any suggestions?

I've been making this recipe for the past 2-3 years. It always comes out perfectly tender and juicy. I passed this recipe onto my sister and it's one of her faves too!

Delicious! I added red wine and some canned crushed tomatoes and served over orzo as suggested. A great dish for company or for a chilly evening.

this is the 2nd time i've made this and always get rave reviews. the only suggestion i would make is to use a fat separator when preparing the sauce or make ahead of time and wait til the oils solidify. there tended to be quite a bit of oil -partially from the lamb (could only trim so much fat), the sun-dried tomatoes, and the artichoke hearts (give them a good rinse). Also, ask your buther to cut the shanks into 3-4 pieces.

I served this with the orzo, and it was even better the next day. Don't get lamb shanks too big for your pot!

I'm not a big lamb shanks fan but my husband is. He thought this was super. That makes it a keeper at our house.

this was delicious. my daughter who thinks she doesn't like sun dried tomatoes & artichokes went for seconds. A nice greek salad goes great. I added lemon juice & parsley to the orzo & boiled it in chicken broth instead of water. Can't wait to taste this again!

This was excellent!! I simmered it on top of the stove for 2 hours instead of using the oven and the results were fantastic. The meat fell right off the bone!! I also used a 1/2 cup white wine during the braising. This is a must for anyone who loves lamb.

An absolute delight to eat! I added a bit of white wine to the braising sauce. I served it on a bed of potate and root vegetable mash (the recipe is on Epicurious) and the flavors were just wonderful. If you like lamb, you'll love this!

Stupendous! Serve over orzo or "Israeli"-style couscouse (the extra large grains). Keeps well for leftovers, too.

This recipe is extremely delicious. I've substituted rib chops and red wine (for the broth), and it's even more delicious!

Wonderful dish! I've tried several lamb shanks recipes, some of which I really like. This one far surpasses any other that I have.
