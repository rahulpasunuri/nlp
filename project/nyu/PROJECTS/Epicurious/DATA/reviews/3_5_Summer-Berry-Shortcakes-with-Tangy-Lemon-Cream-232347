I haven't made the shortcake but the berries and cream are great. I added some lemon zest to the berries, and added a little lemoncello liqueur to both the berries and the cream. Next time I'll add it just to the berries. Also I used Equal sweetener instead of sugar.

The lemon cream is one of the most delicious things I've ever tasted. I was super skeptical because I dislike sour cream, but wow. Amazing.

So first, I have to confess that I used store bought shortcakes. I have no doubt this recipe would have been even better if I had made the shortcakes myself. Nevertheless, I really loved the lemon cream mixed with the berries. It is so easy to make. I have used both fat free sour cream and greek yogurt and decided that I prefer the former. Great for a light summer dessert. It also works well without the shortcakes.

AWESOME.

The berries were heavenly, as was the lemon cream. The shortcakes were just okay, more of a vehicle than anything good on its own. If you have your own shortcake recipe, I'd recommend using it instead with the berries and lemon cream as here.

I was looking for a shortcake recipe to use with some strawberries, and this was just perfect! So easy, and just delicious. Next time, I'll try the berry recipe, but this shortcake recipe is definitely a keeper.
