Super recipe. It took me no time to through together. I made it two days ahead and the flavors had really deepened. Because I wasn't paying attention, I used smoke Spanish paprika by accident. Not to worry! The result was really good. Next time I will use a mix of sweet and smoked paprik on purpose.

This is a very good base recipe. It needed some tweaking as it was a bit on the bland side as written. The recipe calls for 5 cups of beef stock and 5 cups of water. I would advise 7 cups of beef broth and 3 cups of water. I used a 3" wide slab of bacon and cut it into 1/4" pieces. This allowed the bacon to really crisp up and have more tooth in the final product. I also found that it lacked that real Hungarian flavour, so I added an additional 1/2 tsp of caraway seeds, and 3 medium carrots cut to 1/4" slices (added at the same time as the potatoes). Some like their goulash to be clear, I on the other hand, like it to be a little more hearty. I took 2-1/2 cups of the soup (with beef, potatoes, carrots, etc.) and put it in a blender. Then added it back into the soup. Much better. Definitely let this soup rest overnight to let the flavours meld. It is much better the next day. An excellent recipe! Be prepared for a lot of prep work to get your mise en place ready.

I had just returned from Dusseldorf where we had Goulash just about every night. Love the stuff. I had to make my own and this recipe is fantastic. I added some sauted sliced mushrooms to the recipe, otherwise stuck to the ingredients. I have 3 very picky eaters at home that asked for second helpings. I think using good quality Hungarianpaprika, as per the recipe, makes the difference. I would highly recommend this to soup lovers.

I love this goulash -- one of the best. I use one cup Kilkenny Irish beer, four cups beef broth and two cups water instead of the 10 cups water/broth. I also add about two tablespoons of molasses to temper the flavours. I use 2.5 tablespoons very fresh paprika, and half a tablespoon lightly smoked paprika. I also use roasted red peppers instead of fresh. Altogether wonderful served with sour cream and fresh dill.

Good, but I don't think this really distinguished itself from other goulashes that I've had. Also, could someone suggest a way to cook the meat that results in it being more tender? Bigger chunks, maybe?

F-A-B-U-L-O-U-S! This turned out beautifully. In looking at others' comments, I tweaked the recipe -- adding the spice element via Chipotle peppers and dried red chilli peppers. I did use Stout Lager thereby reducing the water which made the biggest positive difference. This was so very worthwhile, and I'm glad I made it. Frankly, it borders on Beef Bourguignonne versus Stroganoff.

I used this recipe as a basis for a quick weekday dinner for myself and my spouse and was exceptionally pleased. It was rich, flavorful and relatively easy. I skipped the bacon (which we don't use) and substituted fennel for caraway seeds (which we didn't have on hand), and used pimentos instead of peppers. We cut out the water and used vegetarian broth, which reduced cooking time. Delightful!

Rating: 4
Excellent, and hearty indeed! I made a half batch, and followed the recipe exactly, except I omitted the potatoes and served over egg noodles, and right at the end I thought it needed to have more tomato and salt, so I added ketchup (horrible, I know). But it turned out really really well!

Fantastic recipe - my husband and I are currently living in Austria and have our pick of cheap and delicious goulasch at many local restaurants, but this recipe is by far our favorite so far. We halved it, using a liter of water, a beef boullion (a sin, I know, but our small refrigerator isn't big enough to hold homemade beef broth), and a pinch cayenne pepper or hot paprika, which gives it a tiny bit of a kick. We also simmer it for nearly 3 hours. We've told ourselves we're only going to make this recipe once more before Christmas, so we don't get sick of it before we make it for the in-laws on Christmas Eve.

This is really great. I'll first admit I had no stewing beef so I converted the recipe for chicken (chicken stock, white wine vinegar, etc). The flavour and consistency was spot on - exactly how I remember my grandma making it. I also made one more modification using only half the liquids. In my recollection, it should be quite thick and stew-like. I will definitely make it again, next time with beef!

Use a dark beer instead of water for better body. Also excellent without the potatoes in the soup, but mashed potatoes under the soup. Yummy

Made this while camping. Perfect for a cool rainy day. Served over mashed potatoes. I did not measure anything, simply used it as a guide and slowly simmered for a couple of hours. I used the bagged bacon from Costco to make it easier The result was really good. My husband said "Not my mother's goulash" (which I describe as meat, ketchup and a bay leaf). I also paired with the suggested wine. Has anyone used a different cut of meat for this? I hate trimming chuck and I really want that tender cut. Suggestions?

I've made this recipe many times - love it! In tweaking this recipe, I had to omit the bacon because of cholesterol issues. To compensate for the smokey bacon flavor, I added 1 Tbsp. smoked Spanish paprika to 2 Tbsp. sweet Hungarian paprika. It may not be authentic, but the smoked paprika adds depth to the flavor. Also reduced the amount of beef broth by 1 cup and added 1 cup to 1/2 bottle dark beer (don't use light beer). I serve the soup with sourdough bread and a salad with a vinaigrette dressing like Eugene, OR suggested. Yum!

I failed to mention we served this with amber beer to drink and hearty rye bread. Made a cucumber, red onion and dill salad to lighten things up, nice contrast of flavors. I like a previous poster's idea of adding beer instead of water-- I'll try that next time.

I made this for a casual dinner party for six and we ate it ALL. Instead of adding potatoes we served this over homemade spaetzle and let everyone top their filled soup plate with a dollop of sour cream and handful of parsley. DEElicious, am making again for 20 for Christmas Eve.

Best goulash I have tasted in a long time! Clued in by some other reviewers, I used a bottle of beer instead of water and simmered this on the stove for several hours. Delicious over mashed potatoes (I did this instead of putting potatoes in the goulash) , but I am sure great over rice or pasta too! Better yet, leftovers sopped up in bread the next day are even more scrumptious!

Made this soup today using Bon Appetite's recipe from Oct '89. Since I'm not big meat eater, used linguisa sausage instead. Was delicious. The Bon Appetit recipe does not include wine,tomato paste or flour, but had the other ingredients. I kept the sausages whole until the very end. After removing the sausages from the soup (after 30 mins simmer) I let sausages cool down then chopped them into small pieces and added back into the soup. Also, I used a TBSP sour cream to top it off with a little snipped cilantro on top. Very good!

I halved the recipe, added a little extra paprika (Hungarian sweet -- from Hungary, I know because I bought it in Budapest) and instead of russet, I used Yukon Golds to hold up under the stewing and added about 15 minutes to the simmer time and it was absolutely killer.

I also used less water to make it more of a stew. In addition to the red pepper, I added green peppers (to compliment the strong reds in the recipe). I would definitely make this again and try it out with beer as someone suggested here.

This was very good. I'd probably lose the bacon next time. I did use beer instead of water and yukon golds instead of russets. Having good paprika definitely makes a difference and I like a mix of hox and sweet. A light rye bread with butter is perfect for dipping/sopping.

Excellent,very authentic, I could have been in Vienna tasting this soup on a chilly evening. No need to change anything.

Great soup, however authentic Hungarian goulash does not have any garlic in it, only onions,paprika and perhaps a little bit of tomato paste. I would never use russet potatoes as they are for baking. Use yukon gold, cook it separately and add it at the end. Also, you can add a bay leaf and remove it at serving. I can't see how cumin would add to the outcome, will try it next time? Best to cook the day before, without the potatoes.

Awesome. I cut this recipe out of Gourmet in 1994 and just made it in 2007. I looked online and the recipe is here. As a 1/2 bohunk by heritage, I have lots of goulash tasting experience. Don't overcook the potatoes as they will sit in the hot broth and become mush. My sister in law and husband both raved about this soup. Me too. Serve it with sour cream.

Rating: 4
Four forks! I made a half this recipe. I had not even read the reviews here; the called-for 5 C of liquids (half the recipe amount) seemed a lot and I definitely wanted a stew and not a soup, so I cut back the liquids. I used 3 3/8 C of beef broth (2 13.5 ozs cans) and no other liquids. I used 1.5 Tsp "regular" paprika (recipe's exact amount): I liked it. I used 1 tsp caraway seeds (versus recipe's 0.75 tsp): I liked that too. I cooked it on Sunday afternoon, let the "stew" rest overnight, eating it Monday evening: as with all stews and long-cooking soups, I much prefer the result one day later than immediately after cooking.

Rating: 4
This is a really good basic recipe. I too, omit the potatoes, but use half hot and half sweet paprika. For a really rib-sticking winter dinner, use half the amount of stock (so it is like a stew) and serve over spatzele or wide egg noodles.

I made this recipe exactly as written with the exception of doubling the garlic (personal preference). It came out fine, but not great. The russet potatoes become too grainy once you've refrigerated and then reheated the goulash. Canned new potatoes may work better as they hold up better to long cooking times. The caraway seed was just this side of distinguishable and if I made this dish again, I would lessen by 1/2. My friend and I added a thick balsamic vinegar just before eating and it gave me the idea to add it earlier in the cooking process to deepen the flavor of the dish. I, too used 2 cups of lager instead of the 5 cups of water. I can't imagine using so much water in this dish as with 7 cups of liquid, it's still very soupy.

I thought this was great and the amount of paprika was just right. The only change I made was I used Spanish smoked sweet paprika instead of Hungarian sweet paprika. It gave it a wonderful smoky flavor.

I would have to say this dish was really good and hearty. I made early one cool morning and didn't eat it till late afternoon. It was delicious especially the next day. I turned around made a large pot and invited the neighbors and also made a batch without the actual bacon and beef and substituted with shrimp and scallops browned only in the bacon grease for a neighbor who can't eat meat, I must say it was exceptional. Thumbs up

I love this recipe. I've made it several times. Using beer instead of water is a great idea. This recipe is even better the next day. Many reviewers complained it was either too thin, too thick, had too much paprika, or too many caraway seeds. I thought it was just right. The only change I made was the use of beer instead of water.

It's been raining here (forever) so I thought I would make a nice bowl of soupy stew with leftover roast. I basically used the ingredients in the recipe but pared it down for about 4 servings instead of 12 and made a "quick" version. I didn't think this was anything special, however, I didn't use bacon and I didn't stew it and I'm sure this would have made all the difference. I would recommend putting a dollop of sour cream and some fresh dill on each serving - it took it from mediocre to good (for me). Maybe I'll give this a try some other time and do it "the right way" :)

I had some left over pot roast and decided to try it in this recipt. IT WORKED OUT GREAT! The only thing I did differently was put in more beef broth than water. Delish! I certainly will make it again, maybe I'll try with the raw meat, rather then left overs

I loved this recipe, although I made it without the bacon. Someone wrote a review that the amount of paprika was too much, but that is NOT at all true. If you're using a SWEET HUNGARIAN paprika, the 3 tablespoons is just right and makes it so savory! My family loves this recipe served over ziti or large elbow macaroni.

I wanted a Goulash recipe that was different from the one that has been passed from mother to daughter (for who knows how many generations)from my Austrian family side. I used the bacon from this recipe and fresh tomatoes instead of paste, I used one extra onion and only 1/4 cup of water because I cooked the potaoes on the side and not in the Goulash. The recipe came out more like a stew, I cooked it in very low heat for about 2 and 1/4 hours, until the meat was nice and tender. I must say this was delicious, because the juices were all from the onions and peppers and the meat, no added H2O, there was lots of juice ... yummm! The bacon added that extra sinfull taste to the dish. Awesome!

Rating: 3
First and foremost, goulash needs to be made 1 day before - no exceptions. Secondly, you must use a lot of onions -equal part onions to meat and saute onions until they become black (the blackness gives your goulash a more traditional flavor and color - they eventually disappear into the sauce.) I took the advice to add in a beer (as I'm Czech, I used a good Czech beer - which definitely enhanced the flavor.) I didn't use any bacon, but substituted spicy chorizo (which didn't really add to the dish - not sure if I would add any bacon, as I prefer less smoky flavor to this particular dish.) Make sure you simmer this dish until the meat is completely soft and pulls apart easily with a fork. I served with dumplings and garnished with raw slices (very thin) of red peppers and diced onions (and a dallop of sour cream.) Absolutely a hit with our friends - and would easily make this dish again! Hope my comments help.

Rating: 1
Sadly (and surprisingly considering the number of posted comments), this is a ruined recipe owing to a typo. 3 Tablespoons of paprika renders the dish hopelessly unbalanced and bitter. Three teaspoons would have been more than ample. This is not just a matter of personal taste; see the other goulash soup recipes posted which call for either one or two teaspoons of paprika for a similarly sized portion. The current newstand version of Saveur magazine, again for an equivalent portion size, recomments a single teaspoon of the spice. As written, it's revolting.

This is very good. I browned the meat with seasoned flour and put in my crock pot. Added all the ingredinets exceptions: 4 cups of broth, no water, 1 bottle of dark beer & no bacon. Cooked it on low for 10 hours. It was to soupy so I made a slurry with the soup and flour 1/3 cup. Sooo good. I plan on going Xcountry skiing this aft and this will be the waiting for us for warm up and comfort

Absolutely delicious, the best goulash I've ever had!!! Definitely use all beef broth and some beer, and add extra garlic. I passed one cup of the soup in the mixer to thicken it up a bit. It's great the first day, but out of this world the second!! We have it with crusty garlic bread and sour creme. I highly recommend this recipe, and it's by far my boyfriends favourite soup!

This is pretty good, but far from the authentic Gulashsuppe found in central Europe. I think Americans always over complicate recipes when trying to reproduce foreign flavors. Less is More! Also try this with venison if you are fortunate to get some, an incredible dish. No bacon, too smoky, best done with lard and cook the onions over the lowest possible heat until they melt(this can take an hour), don't let them color. No garlic, no tomato, no vinegar, Hungarian paprika definitely (try a combo of sweet and hot to taste)caraway and salt, diced red bell pepper and potato or spaetzle and a good rich beef stock are the only incredients necessary but mushrooms make a nice addition, drink the beer don't add it to the soup. Long slow cooking is what tenderizes the meat and develops the wonderful flavor, put it in a 300 degree oven for 3-4 hrs and you dont't have to worry about scorching. Like most stews and slow cooked dishes, it is definitely better the next day!!

This is a really good, solid stew. I used the beer and broth, no water. Add liberally your own mix of spices as it is a bit bland. And, if you are serving for a dinner party or anything, DEFINITELY MAKE THE DAY BEFORE. The stew the day of is just so-so. The day after, it is divine.

Relied heavily on feedback from those who made before and it turned out excellent! Used smoked sausage instead of bacon, used 2 bottles of very good German beer (Salvatore) instead of water, doubled the garlic and backed off the caraway seeds by half a teaspoon.

We've made this recipe twice now -- never use the water. the first time we used the dark beer as another person suggested. The second time we used wine. Makes it a different soup... I like the dark beer better. In fact, I have to say to try different paprikas, maybe a Spanish smoky one.

The Hungarian food lovers in the group thought this was "finom" (tasty). We made many modifications: used smoked sausage instead of bacon, pork instead of beef, regular vinegar, tomatoes instead of paste, vegetable broth instead of beef broth, and 1 pepper only. Plus we added carrots, parsley root and dumplings. Basically, we reinvented the recipe because my sister forgot to buy most of the ingredients required. Our version deserved 4+ forks.

As with the other reviewers, I modified the recipe somewhat. I doubled the amount of garlic, reduced the amount of caraway, and used both beer and stock for the liquid. I added some hot paprika in addition to the mild. I simmered the goulash uncovered for entire time. The result was a fabulous stew. The best goulash my hubby ever had. Even the kids liked it too.

My dear fellow reviewers -- I'm sorry I didn't listen to you!!... absolutely omit the water and use more broth + beer to get to those 10 cups of liquid.. the last thing this needs is water... used hot paprika which gave it a nice kick... Would reduce caraway seeds next time, too overpowering

This was a very good soup. I was looking for a really good Goulash recipe and although this is a great recipe, I'm still looking for a recipe that is thicker and more authentic. I doubled the garlic and paprika. Next time I will double the beef as well. It does taste much better the second day!

For those of you who followed me from the "other" goulash on this site, Hi! I made this last night and I thought it was terrific and my guests raved about it. I used the czech beer, I didn't and wouldn't puree it and I used a full half pound of applewood smoked bacon. (What would I do with the last three slices?) The only thing is you will run out of meat and potatoes before you serve 12 although there is plenty of broth. The curly endive salad and crusty bread are good recommendations.

I made this recipe for an "austrian" dinner party and it was very well received. I served it over homemade spaetzle noodles which I believe made it even more yummy. I did not have any problems with lack of flavor....perhaps because I used all broth instead of broth and water. Two people requested the recipe and I would definitely make this dish again. This is much more like a stew than a soup and comes out wonderful when made ahead. I even froze some (I had made 2 batches) and it was still very good after being frozen. You must use the sweet Hungarian paprika which is not easy to find but this will give it a distinct flavor and I held back a bit on the amount of caraway seeds as this too gives a strong flavor which I felt would have been a bit overpowering with 1 1/2 teaspoons. Good luck and enjoy!

This was a big hit at my winter soup party. As others had recommended, I also substituted beer for water (used 4 cans of beef broth and 2 bottles of beer as total 10 cups of liquid). My addition was to use a hand blender to about 3/4 of the soup - including meat - making it thicker but still leaving hearty chunks of potato and beef. I also added a sour cream garnish. Yum!

I made the entire recipe and the only changes I made was to use a bottle of Killian's Red and two cans of beef broth in lieu of all of the water. I also added carrots, celery, more garlic, and I omitted the potatoes because I wanted to serve it on top of noodles. It was bland and not remarkable. I ended up adding more salt and a generous half teaspoon of red pepper and that helped, but I don't think this was a particularly distinctive dish. Indeed, as I read the reviews, it appears that just about everyone made changes in an effort to give some taste to this dish.

Pretty good, but maybe not so "hearty" as I'd expected. (Maybe too soupy and not thick enough.)I followed the recipe as written and served it to our Book Group. There were two other soups also; this was the least favorite. Since there were leftovers, I froze them. It survived that process well, and we enjoyed a later meal. Perhaps when not closely contrasted with something tastier, this is just fine.

What a GREAT soup recipe! I too used some of the suggestions made by the other reviewers...I cut this recipe in half and used one bottle of Pale Ale and 1/2 c. water instead of using all water. I also increased the garlic considerably. I also added just a dash of cayenne for a little kick. The soup was a perfect consistancy (I really didn't understand why it didn't work for others), the meat was so tender and the flavors were perfect! It was so quick and easy to prepare, I am looking forward to making it again. Also, my friend just returned from Germany, which is what prompted my to make this dish, and she thought it was spot on!!

We loved this!! It really helped with all the suggestions...I changed it up quite a bit. I coated the pieces of beef with a flour/salt/pepper mixture before adding to the bacon grease. I still browned the meat. Then I used a mix of different ground chili peppers (chilpolte, arbol, etc). I cut it in half except for the meat, garlic and paprika and change from potatoes to homemade herbed dumplings--noodle-ish (recipe is on this site). And I substituted a bottle of beer for the water. Then, because everyone said it made a lot of gravy, I served it with fresh bread, a sweeter french bread type. It was terrific!

In response to "Dan from Hamilton, Ontario" who states that "MORE THAN ONE MEAT" is used.... I would ask if he is aware that bacon and beef come from different animals? And he is making 20 litres of soup a day? Anyway - make this because it is a wonderful dish especially when served with a spaetzle - YUMMY is the word!

I make 20 litres of soup a day for a living and therefore, consider myself an expert. This recipe works if you use chef grade "A" potatoes (they're much bigger) as well as Elephant garlic. Disregard the instructions following browning the meat. Use the fat in the pot to make a chocolate brown roux of flour and butter then add the vegetables, slowly adding more flour until thick as pea soup. Then add beef stock and remaining ingredients. A Goulash is supposed to mean MORE THAN ONE MEAT! Usually beef and lamb or beef and goat, but, North American tastebuds prefer beef and Pork. Try adding Bacon and using its' fat to make your roux. Whoever suggested adding a beer is more right than they know. It is traditional to serve Goulash with a pint of beer. Cheers!

Making this soup is no small task - it makes a TON. I took the advice to substitute a can of beer. It smelled great cooking and was certainly delicious (add more garlic and pepper to liven it up), but I agree that it needs thickening. I should have taken the advice to puree some of the potato.

It was o.k. I don't know if I was just being lazy the day I made it, but for all the work that goes into it, I thought it would be a more satisfying soup. And the name is deceiving...Hearty?

My stepmom loved it, but I wasn't too impressed. Definitely get out the SALT & PEPPER and add more GARLIC, you're gonna need it!

I made a few modifications after comparing the recipe with a recipe from Slovakia. Added 1 can beer instead of some of the water, 1 tsp marjoram, 1tsp crushed red chilli peppers, dash more salt. Also added 2 very fienly diced potatoes to thicken the soup. This soup passed my Slovakia neighbour taste test with flying colours-he took half my batch with glee. EVEN BETTER THE SECOND DAY. Let it sit if you can-it is well worth it. This is one soup not to pass on.

I thought this soup was very good. I thought it needed a toch more garlic and pepper (I used crushed red pepper flakes. The meat was incredibly tender and the broth was thick and velevety. Definatley a great winter meal. Hint:Use a good beef broth- I used the low sodium kind and ended up adding a ton of salt in the end.

Excellent flavor and authentic tasting. I would caution against adding or changing this recipe too much as it was great just the way it was. The carroway seeds, vinegar and paprika along with the beef and potatoes are a perfect combination that tastes very Hungarian. There was plenty of left overs.

OH MY GOD!!!! This was out of this world scrumptuous! I made it 3 days ago and still am savoring the results. I used a whole small can of the tomato paste and found that was sufficient to thicken the soup, keeping in mind that this is soup not stew. I added 4 extra strips of bacon, only because I am addicted to it...It was beyond perfect. I am Slovak/Polish and this brought me back many fond memories of my mothers wonderful "comfort" food. Everyone both young and old had seconds.

Wonderful! Next time, I plan to cook the meat a little bit longer and maybe add mashed potatoes to thicken the broth. Overall, a fantastic recipe!

This dish was so good I didn't get to taste a bite. I made a pot full and decided to let it sit in the frig one day to blend the flavors. Before the 24 hours was up my skinny wife ate the whole batch proclaming the soup was beyond good and she is a picky eatter. She rates this a Four. I'll have to take her word for it. See what you think, it is a pretty easy dish to fix.

This is a delicious goulash soup that tastes very authentic. If you like goulash soup then you will enjoy this recipe. I added parsnips and carrots to mine and used slightly less vinegar than the recipe called for. The result was a hearty rich soup. This recipe makes a good deal of soup so if you have a small family you'll have extra to share with a friend or a neighbor.

I just made this soup for my Austrian husband (we live in Australia) and his said it was fantastic. He wants me to make it again ( a strong recommendation if you know Austrians!)

I thought it was too vinegary and too thin, so I added more flour for a thicker soup. It wasn't like the Gulaschsuppen I'd had in Germany and Austria, so I'm continuing my search. It's not a horrible soup; it just wasn't what I'd hoped it would be.

I made this soup for a group of visiting Germans - and they LOVED it! I did however improvise one ingrediant, and added about a bottle of beer! It gave the soup a delicious flavor.

I have made this soup twice. Delicious both times. I added macaroni (precooked) to the last soup. Some liked it better without macaroni. Some liked it better with macaroni.

This soup had real body. It tastes as good as any premium restaurant's soup. Great for a cold winter's day!
