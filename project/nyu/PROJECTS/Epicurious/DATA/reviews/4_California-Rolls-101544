I have made this salad twice as a main dish, but with two changes. I used soba noodles instead of rice and shrimp instead of crab. For some reason I never get rice right when I need to and the soba noodles are much more consistent and faster. Everyone loves this meal including my 1 and 3 year olds. I put very little dressing on the kids servings. Fun summer dish!

A little time consuming, but they taste great and are a lot of fun to serve. Expect sticky rice everywhere-it lives up to its name!

Not a review, but a question before I make the California Rolls. The sauce ingredients call for soy sauce and rice wine or scotch, but the instructions say to combine the soy sauce, VINEGAR, and rice wine. What kind of vinegar?Rice Wine Vinegar? AND rice wine? Seems to be an error....

I paired this with the Tuna Teriyaki with Wasabi Butter. It was a great combo, because not only did I do the California Rolls, but also used the Ahi Tuna for some of my sushi. I stuck to the recipe on this one except for the rice. I used real sticky rice (not long grained) I couldn't fine "Asakusa" nori in my Asian store, so just got the sushi kind (don't know what the difference is) Didn't need lemon, my avacado was PERFECT. OH, also added seedless cucumber slices into the sushi. Nice addition. I think more truly California Roll. All my ingredients were cut the size of a skinny french fry. Tasted just like Japanese Sushi Bar - Definately a keeper.

Didn't know that sushi could be this easy! A little time consuming, but not hard to put together. Will serve at my next party.
