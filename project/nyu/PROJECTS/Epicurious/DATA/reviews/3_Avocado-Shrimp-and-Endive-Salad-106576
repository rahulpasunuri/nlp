I thought this was wonderful. Simple and delicious, it is important to have really top quality ingredients as this is about their basic flavours and textures. Sweet, creamy, sour and bitter, I just loved this salad. It is also quick enough to make any day you just happen to find yourself with these ingredients peaking.

I made this recipe because all the ingredients are favorites. I was very disappointed. The result is bitter and unappealing... too much endive and it needs less mustard and more mellow ingredients to balance it.

Delicious. This was a big hit when I served it for a light lunch with friends. The dressing is especially good.

Great light recipe. Perfect as is...tomato will change the lightness of this.

This is easy and yummy, and I agree that the dressing should not be too strong or the delicate taste of shrimp and avocado are drowned out, rather than being enhanced. I think the recipe is great as is.

I really enjoyed this light salad. Granted it needs to be tooled with. I used halved cherry tomatoes that fit in nicely with the rest of the ingredients. I used 3 avocados and a pound of shrimp, so inturn I increased the mustard to probably 4 tablespoons and the lemon juice to 4 tbsp in the dressing as well. If you like avocados and shrimp, make this recipe. Don't forget the cherry tomatoes!!!!!

I thought this was a nice, light dressing for a simple salad. More flavor would take away from the ingredients.

Found this recipe to be pretty bland. Pepped up the sauce with a dash of tabasco sauce.
