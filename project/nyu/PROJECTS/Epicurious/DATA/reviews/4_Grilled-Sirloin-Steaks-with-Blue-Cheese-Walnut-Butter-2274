This recipe didn't really work for me. The steak had a very mild flavor, it needed more salt and fresh rosemary would have worked better. I used supermarket sirloin, which is not the best cut, and that's why I looked for a recipe with something added for flavor. I liked the blue cheese butter in itself. I think it would be great on sliced bread. The parsley brings a nice freshness to the mixture. However, the flavor was too intense for the meat. It overwhelmed it without complimenting it. In all, I wouldn't make this again.

This has been my families favorite way to make steaks for years. My sons usually ask for these steaks on their birthdays in lieu of famous steak house meals. The recipe is perfect as written. If I'm hosting an eclectic crowd, I make sure and use a milder bleu cheese. As with anything else, the better the cheese and steaks you use, the better the result. If you're a steak lover that likes bleu cheese -- this recipe will knock your socks off.

My husband and I made this for date night and it was wonderful! Suitable to impress guests, just make sure they like blue cheese because it is quite strong. But tasty!

Every time I make this recipe for guests, they rave and say it is the best steak they have ever had. I've made this as an anniversary dinner for my in-laws and they said it was better than any steak they've ever eaten in a restaurant. Have used rib-eyes, t-bones, sirloin, etc. Really any cut of meat is fabulous with this dish.

I have made this recipe several times now and have also used the topping for fillets, although it is wonderful with the sirloin. I made this for a small dinner party. Everyone raved about the blue cheese topping. Of course, if you do not like blue cheese, don't eat it. Maybe you could make a butter topping with the walnuts and herbs and leave out the blue cheese. It really is great.

No modifications necessary on this one - fabulous as is! Have made this countless times and it is always a hit with everyone! There is typically a little walnut butter left over - I freeze it and save it for next time.

I made this steak at a cookout recently, and it was a huge hit! My friends were all very impressed, and already want me to make it again!

My husband made this for me and I'm not sure if he made it correctly considering the ratings from everyone else. I found it very overwhelming. The flavors were all so strong, that the only thing I could taste was rosemary and blue cheese. Too much of both. I think maybe we will give it another chance with a more mild blue cheese. We used stilton because someone suggested it. I think maybe cambozola next time. Any suggestions?

This was fantastic. I served it exactly as written, with twice stuffed potatoes, roasted asparagus and sauteed mushrooms in garlic butter. The meal was to die for!

Delicious with just the garlic paste. I will definitely try the Blue cheese-walnut butter, but don't hesitate to make the steaks by themselves.

We really enjoyed this, the only suggestions I would make is to make the butter ahead let it come to room temperature and put it on the steaks while they are resting. We will definatly make this again.

I made this exactly as written, dried rosemary and all, and it was one of the most flavorful things I have ever made, hands down. This is not a dish for people who like things "medium." This is for the kind of folks who like to enjoy all of their senses to the fullest.

This was SO good! My husband rarely orders or grills steak because he insists that nothing comes close to his mother's. But he's already requested to have this recipe again. The garlic-rosemary rub gives the meat great flavor. And oh, that butter! Yum! We both loved this.

Rating: 4
Deb, thank you for the fantastic suggestion! I made a double batch of the butter and added one batch to grilled vegetables (bell peppers, red-skinned potatoes, snow peas, mushrooms and red onions). So easy to make but it really does not taste like it.

Rating: 4
Wow, the butter is so good! However, the steaks didn't need it. I used the butter on some grilled vegetables the I served alongside the steaks. I grilled the sirloin steaks using mesquite/hickory charcoal and grilled them to medium rare. Next time I will pull them off a minute earlier to have them more on the rare side. The flavor of the rosemary really comes through on the beef and it was "melt in your mouth" perfection. Lovely dinner.

wow! best way to prepare steak on the grill... the rub made the meat taste awesome on its own... and the butter! so amazingly yummy... spooned it over grilled veggies and spread it on slices of french bread... both the rub and butter would be good separately. overall, a wonderful steak recipe.

Somewhat disappointed after all the rave reviews. We love blue cheese but are generally not big steak eaters. It was OK but probably would not make again. If you like the combination of blue cheese with steak, try the blackened steak salad (on this site) - THAT was good!!!!

I didn't have time to marinate the steaks with pepper, so I just made the butter mixture and put in on top of regular grilled steaks. It took only minutes and my boyfriend thought it was delicious.

This is delicious!! The bleu cheese butter was great on the steak and on the baked potatoes I served with it. And the rub on the steak was to die for. And it was so easy to prepare!

I doubled the blue cheese butter recipe. Good thing I did, we were practically eating it from the bowl! It was perfect with the sirloin. We even spread it on our baked potatoes and melted it on french bread. Our friends were still raving over the dinner the next day! I am definitely making this recipe again!

We're not big beef eaters in the first place but every once in a great while we crave a juicy steak. After purchasing a wonderfully huge sirloin from our excellent butcher, I proceeded with the recipe. I made the compund butter but ommited the rosemary and sub'd toasted pecans in place of walnuts. I wanted to make it useful for more general purposes and my thought was that the rosemary in the rub would be sufficient. It wasn't. First of all I prefer to use fresh herbs but only had dried, (I do keep all other herbs growing in my garden though). It basically just took a "bouncy ride" in my food processor's mini-bowl and didn't break down much. I went ahead and used it, just hoping that the juices from the steak would re-hydrate it somehow. The little "dried sticks" turned to a charcoal and didn't impart any flavor at all! It was the butter that saved the recipe. I am willing to give it another try after I purchase a live rosemary plant. Served with a simple side of steamed broccoli with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice and a large glass of a smooth, mellow pinot noir.

QUESTION: Are any of you familiar with how garlic becomes bitter if burned? (My husband readily notices burned garlic, but my palate is not that refined.) That in mind, I wondered it the garlic-paste rub became bitter when grilled. Or if, even though I didn't see it noted, some of you (knew to) scrape(d) it off. --Comments from those of you sensitive to burned, bitter garlic?

Wonderful! The butter was especially good. The whole family loved this recipe. Definitely a keeper!

The garlic and rosemary on the steaks was delish! However, my husband and I like blue cheese, but the butter was way to strong for our tastes. You really have to LOVE blue cheese to enjoy it. I'll definitly make the rub again though.

This was incredible! What a treat! The blue cheese spread was delicious and in addition to serving it on our sirloin, it was very good spread on our crusty bread too! A major splurge...but well worth the calories!

Served this to guests tonight. All liked it BUT agreed that half of the blue cheese butter would be plenty. Next time, I'll save some of those calories.

Very flavorful! I loved this recipe. Simple yet delicious and impressive enough to serve to guests. I do have to admit that my husband said he would rate it only three forks, he is not as much of a blue cheese lover as I am. I omitted the parsley because I did not have any on hand. I boiled green beans and used a pat of the blue cheese butter for a great side dish.

Rating: 4
DELICIOUS!! Blue cheese is the perfect compliment to a grilled steak. This very simple and time efficient recipe is very impressive for guests. The compound butter can be made days ahead so prep is minimal. I made this for my new in-laws the first time I cooked for them and it was such a hit!

This was a dish to leave something desired. The blue cheese walnut butter was way to over powering. You couldn't pay me to make this again.

Oh my God. This is just awesome. I didn't have time for the marinade so I just used some good ole worstershire sauce & pepper for the meat. The butter is incredible. I mean really incredible. We've made this many times now and I definitely reccomend using good steak for this. It's a splurge kind of meal anyway. I leave out the parsley--having made this with and with out I think the presentation is much prettier without the tinge of green in the butter and the flavor lacks for nothing without it. (If you like this recipe, try the new potatoes with black peppercorn butter--also to die for--but not on the same day as the steaks, it really might kill you!)

Terrific! Guests loved it. For non-red meat eaters I marinated chicken breasts in a Lawry's herb marinade(comes in an envelope at the store) then bbq'ed them with the meat, put that wonderful butter on them too. Served with Epicurious twice-baked potatoes and chopped green salad. Four forks all around.

This was delicious. My husband made it for the family for dinner and other than the teenager in the house who doesn't appreciate cheese it was a huge hit. I'm glad we made extra butter as we'll be trying it on chicken.

My kids refuse to eat anything with nuts in it so I do without the walnuts, but this is still an outstanding dish. It makes a relatively inexpensive cut of beef taste like it came out of a five-star restaurant. IF you have any leftovers, slice it thin for the world's BEST french dip sandwiches!

My husband who isn't a blue cheese fan loved the blue cheese-nut-butter topping on his steak. We used Choice strip steaks and his only comment was next time I should spring for a better quality steak . . . I'm thinking prime would be a worthwhile splurge. I toasted pecans with a tiny bit of butter and salt instead of using walnuts simply because I had pecans in my freezer. I used Maytag blue cheese. I served the steaks with steamed broccoli and baked potatoes to keep from competing with the flavors of the blue cheese and nuts in the butter. It was scrumptious! Even if you're not a huge blue cheese fan, try it anyway because you'll be surprised that it's not overpowering - the blue cheese is subtle but adds so much flavor. Great recipe . . . definitely a keeper!

This was incredible! I made this recipe several times again. I did add more olive oil to the marinade to make it more pastey.

I have to tell you, we had a problem with our grill and burnt the heck out of our steaks, and me and my husband (who is not a big fan of blue cheese) said that the sauce was what saved it! I added a Tablespoon of garlic and a teaspoon of anchovy paste and it just tasted so good, but would have been good any way without it.

This dish was so rich, wonderful, and impressive. We felt like we were eating at a 5-star restaurant! I drizzled some olive oil in with the rub to make it a little easier to spread and also put a little olive oil on the garlic head before I roasted it. I left out the rosemary because I thought it would be too much, but we sprinkled some on our steak after it was cooked and were surprised at the wonderful flavor. I would like to try steaks with just the rub sometime. This recipe will become a staple in our home and will be used with other meats.

Absolutely scrumptious dish. Goes well with twice baked potatoes and asparagus on the grill. Next time I will double the garlic-rosemary rub and cut down on the amount of walnuts used.

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe. The flavors of the blue cheese and the herbs go so nicely with the grilled flavor of the steak. The rub worked well, but I think next time I make this,I will double the garlic, salt and pepper to make the coveeage on the meat more complete. I also used pecans instead of walnuts due to the fact that my boyfriend is allergic to walnuts. This would be an excellent and easy recipe to serve to guests.

Use with any steak. Added a finely diced garlic, one finely diced basil leaf, and a dash of tabasco to the butter for some zing. Wheeeeee! Raves from everyone. This is an at least once a month staple in our home!

I used beef tenderloin steaks instead of sirloin, and omitted the walnuts from the blue cheese butter - it was excellent! I may mix the walnuts into the leftover blue cheese butter and try it that way, too! I really liked the rub, too. Very good for company - make rub & butter ahead. I served the steaks with "Joe's Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes", also from Epicurious, and also very good.

I make this without the bleu cheese butter. It's an excellent rub for steaks (have also used on filets and porterhouse) and gives them a great flavor. Not such a big fan of the bleu cheese butter. The grilled potato and onion pockets that go with the recipe are excellent and easy to make!!
