These were fine but a bit moist. I used a half a stick butter melted and cooled, a whole egg, agave syrup and a bit of molasses instead of honey. They taste good and the recipe is much easier than all the others I have found. I will continue to experiment with this one. (It made 14 muffins.)

They were just OK. They were a little dry. I did add some oil but don't know if that made it better.

I found thes muffins to be quite dense and somewhat dry. I will try them again, perhaps adding some apple or sultana raisins.

I tried this recipe. The muffins did not rise fully (maybe 65%). I re-read the recipe to see if I missed something. There is NO shortening! I checked all my cookbooks. Everybody uses 2 to 6 tablespoons of oil or shortening. Is this a mistake, or are these Flat Muffins?

This was an excellent recipe. I used two cups of the all bran and added fresh blueberries. The recipe made 12 muffins and my family loved them. I will definately add this one to my repetoire.

I make these muffins all of the time - they're wonderful! Not too sweet, either.
