I love this cake. It's perfect if you are entertaining guests who are gluten-free and is a great addition to a Passover meal. It's also just wonderful if there are no dietary restrictions. I agree with other posters that the double boiler isn't necessary - just melt the butter and chocolate together over low heat and stir constantly. I also find that 20 minutes is enough baking time since carry-over cooking takes place in the pan after you remove the cake from the oven.

This was excellent! Only had a 9 inch spring pan so I did 1.5 for the recipe, with the exception of the sugar which I kept to 1c. Also, traded sugar for stevia and it turned out great! Used 72% chocolate and it was a tad darker/bitter than I'd like so I'll change it up next time. Served with fruit and was excellent. Also added 1/2 tbsp vanilla, few shakes of cinnamon and almost 1/4 tsp cardamon to spice it up a bit, very glad I added them in. This recipe is great because it's a good slate for whatever you want to add spice-wise! Sky's the limit! Next time I'll try with almond or mint extract.

LOVE this "cake". I have made it many times. I love how easy it is. I also swapped coconut oil for the butter just to try it. It was GREAT! I saw Dr. Oz say you can swap 1 for 1 butter for coconut oil and he was right. Try it!

Amazing. Easy. Fabulous with raspberry sorbet. I only had milk chocolate chips in the house so that's what I used and it was still perfect. (It's like the best brownie you've ever eaten if you like them a little underdone.)

Fantastic! I added shaved almonds to the top and accompanied it with a vanilla bean gelato. Wonderful Valentine's Day dessert!

Used a 9" springform pan for easy removal. Since the recipe is for an 8" pan, I used 1.5x the recipe to create the perfect height for the cake. Melted the butter in a small saucepan and added chocolate into it - easier than a double boiler. Delicious! Topped with fresh raspberries.

I had to take a dessert to a buffet luncheon so decided to make this in mini- muffin tins. I used the paper liners, and brushed them with soft butter and dusted with cocoa. Don't know if I needed to do that, but they turned out so fabulously! The recipe makes 28 mini-muffins, and I baked them for about 18 minutes. I made four without the paper liners and they looked overdone and sloppy. The others were picture- perfect dusted with powdered sugar.

EVERY time I need to bring a dish to a party or get together I bring this cake. It is pretty much fail-proof. I always double it and use a springform pan, as mentioned. Both wax paper and parchment paper work fine. My 16 year old daughter also whips this up semi-regularly!

This cake is amazing. One of my fave local restaurants makes a flourless chocolate cake so I did a search and decided to try this recipe. SO easy and DELICIOUS! Always a big hit. If I bring something else, I get asked why I didn't bring the chocolate cake. I top it with whipping cream whipped nice and fluffy with cinnamon. Cinnamon and chocolate is always a surprising, spicy combo. Yum!

I've made this cake a few times now as it is an easy and makes a great impression as part of a formal dinner. They don't have wax paper where I am, so I tried buttering and dusting the pan with cocoa. It works great and adds a nice even darkness to the outer layer. I also shave chocolate on top after it is completely cool. Fantastic!

One tip: Use a springform pan. This recipe is the bomb-diggity (I have made it several times), but it can be hard to remove from a regular pan. To becsapronstrings: Waxed paper is fine to use in the oven in this way (sandwiched between a greased bottom and the batter) -- it won't burn.

Rating: 1
This is the worst recipe ever! First of all, you cannot bake with wax paper, the wax melts in the oven. I have tried to make this three times now and the cake falls apart every time. Do yourself a favor and get a box of brownies and make alagaise sauce with raspberries to garnish. It is better and saves time!

I made four of these for my wedding, partly because I have friends who can't eat gluten, partly because it's delicious. It's fast and easy enough that even a frazzled bride can find time to put it together. The recipe multiplies fantastically - no need to make any adjustments to double (or quadruple). I just made a giant batch of batter and split it among the cake pans. I sub in a little milk chocolate (about 1/4th of the total amount), because it makes it a little sweeter and I like what it does to the texture. Best of all: we put this recipe in a cake buffet with professional cakes, and everybody assumed it was from a bakery.

I made this for my 1 year old's first birthday party since she is sensitive to wheat. I did it as 12 cupcakes with a maraschino cherry in each one. It was delicious. I just made it again for my 4 year old to take to his class for his birthday. It is nice and not too messy for kids in cupcake form.

A perennial favorite. Made it to rave reviews today for Mother's Day. My three suggestions: 1. Penzey's Natural High Fat Cocoa. I made this for years as a 4-star dessert. Penzey's Cocoa made it 5-star. 2. After trying many high-end chocolates, they tended to make the cake overly rich and intense. Believe it or not, the best combo I've found with the Penzey's is good old Nestle chocolate chips. Combined with the Penzey's cocoa, it's perfection. 3. Vanilla ice cream is a must. Some sugared mint leaves scattered around won't be unappreciated.

Rating: 4
Oh so delicious! I made mine in a 9-inch spring-form pan (didn't have an 8-inch), and baked it for only 22 minutes. Make sure you spread out the batter as flat as possible, since it's thick enough that it won't really smooth itself out upon heating. (Mine was delicious but lumpy.)

Rating: 3
This is an excellent recipe to use when you don't have a lot of time. I can say that because I left the first one in a bit too long and so was able to make a second in no time flat! Anyway, use an 8-inch pan...the 9-inch pan comes out a little thin. I dusted with confectioners sugar, but would be equally good with a chocolate glaze or caramel sauce.

I used unsweetened chocolate and it came out really well, nice and dark. I baked it in a little ramekin for 17 minutes. It would have been even better at 15 minutes. A very yummy dessert.

I just made this recipe for our last passover-safe dessert, and it was delicious. It tasted like the normal brownies I make when it's not passover, which are fudgey and decadent. I will definitely make this again next year! I liked serving it with whipped cream and caramel syrup, which balanced out the intensity of the chocolate.

This is the perfect Passover cake. It is virtually a saucepan-only recipe - no beating at all. Here are my minor suggested changes: I find the cake a bit monochromatic in taste, as is, so I add 1 ts vanilla, 1 Tb Medaglia D'oro instant espresso coffee, and either 1/4 ts almond extract or 1/2 ts ground cinnamon. I have doubled it precisely as suggested by fsilverman from Brooklyn. Works beautifully. I top it w chocolate ganache: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Ganache-109253 (TJ sells good quality bittersweet chocolate, which they call "dark chocolate" IIRC.)

While this is a good recipe it needs to be edited. 1 stick of butter is NOT 1/2lb. I stick of butter IS 1/4lb. Me, not knowing what to do went with the weight measurement out of consistency. 1 stick is not a unit of measure. Well It came out Ok, just way to rich and it didn't hold together as it should. I attribute this to the extra 1/4 lb of butter.

My son who thinks mac 'n cheese out of a box is cooking made this for our New Year's Eve family dinner. We typically have a 4-course meal and cook as we go along. He pulled this together after the 2nd course and it was perfect and warm by the time we were ready for dessert. Only change would have been to bake it little less than 25 minutes.

I'm not a baker, but I saw the recipe and decided to give it a try. So glad I did! It was a big hit at my office party...now I'm making it for a New Year's Eve dinner. The first time, I dusted it with confectioner's sugar, this time I will serve it with whipped cream and raspberries.

Judging from some of the negative comments about this recipe, I think some reviewers must be unaware of just what a flourless cake is supposed to be like. Rather than your typically light, fluffy layer-type cake or even a dense pound cake or carrot cake, a flourless cake is supposed to be thin (about 3/4 of an inch thick) and very dense, somewhat like a chewy brownie. This is an excellent yet very easily made version of the dessert. I prefer to dust it with sifted powdered sugar rather than cocoa before cutting the cake. Some people add 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and it might be good with chopped nuts, too. However, it's great without modification, especially if you're a chocolate lover, and especially when served with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream (or both).

Rating: 4
This was my first attempt at this recipe, and the results were phenomenal.It's not the most amazing flourless chocolate cake recipe I've ever had, but it was a smashing success, and a breeze to make. The only adjustments I'll make the next time is using a slightly smaller pan, as the final result did come out a bit thinner than I'd anticipated. But it was delicious and dense, and has quickly moved up in the ranks of chocolate cake recipes in this household!

This cake was a huge disappointment. Whatever you do, do not "whisk the eggs well." I made it in a KitchenAid mixer and what I wound up with was a fallen soufle. The taste was pretty good, if a bit too sweet. I'm really surprised because I usually do well with epicurious.

While I wouldn't exactly call it cake, it was super easy and super tasty. I am not a fast baker and it took me about 20 minutes to get it into the oven. Then you have a dense chocolaty brownie-like cake shaped thing- less than an inch thick. We ate it with strawberries and whipped cream. It was great!

The Gourmet Cookbook has a version of this. All ingredients listed are doubled. Use a 10 inch springform. Baked at 350 for 35 to 40 minutes. Serves 10 to 12. Served it today for a Passover party and the chocolate lovers went crazy. Out of their minds crazy. Everyone asked for the recipe. Have made a few times. The first time, it fell apart and I had to serve it cut up. Now I let it really cool before I carefully move it from a rack to a plate.

Even though I am usually a lousy cook, I made this for Valentine's Day and it turned out very delicious! Used a 9" pan and I didn't have "butter paper" so I just lined the bottom of the pan with parchment paper and buttered that. The coconut-lime sorbet is the perfect companion for this cake, to cut the richness & make it feel even more fancy!

This recipe is quick and a crowd pleaser. I followed the recipe as written and served it warm with vanilla ice cream. Everyone loved it! Be careful with the time though - I checked on it three or so minutes before the timer and it was done perfectly, so you should probably only cook it for 21-22 minutes to get the crispy crust with fudgy inside. Yum! Will be making this one again!

Yummo!! Made in a 9 inch pan which I think is a good idea because the cake is very rich. I served it with fresh rasberries it definitley needs this and or a coulis for some sweetness. SOOOO GOOD. Oh and I added a teaspoon of vanilla as per other reviewer's suggestions

I love this cake. It is so easy to make, with just a few ingredients and 25 minutes in the oven, and is super chocolatey. It can go with a lot of different things - flavored whipped creams, different flavors of ice cream, fruit, etc. Customize as you like. My only complaint, and the reason for the three, not four, forks, is that I follow the directions exactly in terms of the buttered wax paper and it still sticks to the bottom edges of my cake every time... not to the center, just the edges. Really annoying and means I have to cut off chunks of the cake since the paper won't come off. That said, I love the cake and will keep making it.

easy, elegant, delicious. I used 1/2 special dark chocolate cocoa and half regular and was rewarded with deep flavor. if you use a 9-inch pan, I recommend reducing the baking time by 2-5 minutes otherwise it turns out a little dry.

Fantastic. Brought to a Xmas Eve dinner and it got raves. Multiplied by 1.5 (minus one T butter) for a 9 inch pan, cooked 25 minutes. Topped with Alton Brown's chocolate ganache (1/4 of his recipe since his is for a full two-tiered cake) and it was perfect. The cake does not look very appetizing without something added on top. I was a little worried until I took the first bite. Silky, rich, delicious. Great with peppermint ice cream.

I had this cake a Sebastians in Racine, WI and always wanted to make this flourless chocolate cake. I found this recipe on Epicurious and tried it last night...Yuck! It was dry and bitter. I revamped the recipe this morning and Yum! I changed to 1 cup sugar, 4 eggs, dash of kosher salt and a splash of vanilla in a 9 inch spring form pan. I reduced the baking time to 20 minutes and it was moist and delicate tasting, just like Sebastians.

I had this idea that a cake with no flour would be light and airy. However, when made it this weekend, it was rich and heavy, and sort of damp and silky. Not what I had hoped for, but wonderful in a different way. People had very small pieces, but I think that was the richness of it.

This recipe is a keeper! EZ, EZ, EZ & melt-in-your-mouth delicious! I only had unsweetened Valhrona on hand, so I increased the sugar to one cup, which worked fine. I also added a pinch of salt & a tsp of vanilla extract (personal preferences: the recipe "as written" would most likely be just as good w/o these adds.) Served with home made vanilla ice cream & baked as individual cakes in a muffin pan - same cook time. A large variety of toppings would go very well with this wonderful chocolate creation as the base. On the next go-round, I'd like to try creme fraiche or home made whipped cream. drooooooooooooooooooooolllllll :-P

It was very easy to make and tasted good, but not the best flourless cake ever. It seemed to have an odd texture, like sort of "chalky" almost? hard to explain.

This is ridiculously easy, I went from start to end of cleanup and with it sitting pretty on the table in under an hour! I made this with 3 mini heart-shaped pans and they were overflowing from a double recipe. The chocolate flavor is really pronounced so I strongly suggest using the best chocolate you can afford (I used Ghirardelli 60% bittersweet and Trader Joe's unsweetened cocoa powder). And its very rich so I suggest sharing~ I think others are right, it would definitely benefit from vanilla so I'll try that next time! Other additions might be stuff that goes well with chocolate - like bananas, strawberries or raspberries to decorate or maybe something tropical like mango or coconut.

This is my go to dessert for guests. I usually make this with a raspberry sauce to drizzle on the plate before sering--makes for a nice presentation.

Have made it twice and loved it both times! First time I overcooked it (8" recipe in 9" pan) second time I made the 9" recipe but undercooked it! Fudgy goodness either way! Last night I made a layer cake out of it with a raspberry preserve middle and glaze on top. It was decadent!

Very tasty dessert! I made it in a 9" tart pan (non-removable bottom) and followed another reviewers suggestion to modify the ingredients....6 oz. chocolate, 1 cup sugar, 5 eggs, and 3/4 cup cocoa and bake for 25 minutes. I served it with fresh sweetened whipped cream and it was a hit. As "fudgy" as it is, it's not overpowering with the sweetness which was really nice. I'll definitely be doing this one again but maybe tweaking it to include cinnamon, vanilla, espresso powder...etc.

Love this recipe! Flourless Chocolate cakes always seemed so gourmet and impossible to make but this recipe is easy and fast. I've brought to several parties and everyone is so impressed with it, they look at me like I'm a professional chef! I've had fun with the toppings with this as well, my two most popular ones are white chocolate sauce: heat whipping cream in a sauce pan until it lightly boils, remove from heat add white chocolate chips and stir until melted. I found it helped to whip the cream to make it thicker and creamier! I also do a whipped cream and add almond liquer. Turns out great!

This is an exceptionally easy and exceptionally good flourless chocolate cake. The recipe is very forgiving.

I made this for a seder I was attending--my first. I had trouble getting it out of the pan, even after soaking bottom in boiling water (didn't have a springform with me.) I ended up salvaging it by slicing it, arranging it in a pinwheel on a lovely plate, sprinkling the top with cocoa powder and casually-strewn raspberries, and passing it off as a "rustic chocolate torte." Unfortunately, many of the guests were keeping kosher and wouldn't try it, but the handful that did RAVED! I'll know better next year.

Amazing. I made the larger 9inch recipe, and it was FANTASTIC! It is even better the next day (and the next) I can't seem to stop myself from wandering in to the kitchen and cutting myself a slice.

I approached this "Project" with a bit of trepidation, as I do not cook as often as I used to. Here are my findings: 1) The cake was so delicious that I ate the entire thing in five days! (OK, I'm a glutton ) 2) It was so ridiculously easy, that when the finished product turned out beautifully, I had to laugh at myself for being totally psyched out into thinking I couldn't possibly do it. 3) I have limited bakeware, so i followed other reviewers' measurements and made a 9" cake. 4) I'm making it again for Mothers' Day and will try adding a splash of vanilla. 5) Will serve at room temperature with raspberry sorbet on the side. 6) I still cannot believe there's no flour in this cake. It has the consistency of a cake made with flour. (Perhaps this is from the cocoa powder?) 7) I don't have a "real" double boiler, so I simply placed a teflon coated pot over a larger pot of water. 8) Whisked the entire concoction in my Kitchen-Aide mixer with the plain, non-whisk attachment. 9) Was very cautious not to over mix, and baked for the exact time indicated by the recipe. 10) Enjoy and indulge! Cheers! Happy Mother's Day!

Extremely easy to make! I was pressed to find a quick dessert that is gluten free and I found this. I followed another reviewers advice and used 6 ounces of chocolate, 1 cup sugar, etc, so it would fit in my 9 inch pan. Worked out wonderfully.

I thought this was a really good flourless cake. I followed the recipe but also added a dash of vanilla. I had two different bars of chocolate to use up so I mixed 3 ounces of coffee-infused with 1 ounce of bittersweet (Valrohna and World Market). To be honest, I think the 1 ounce of bittersweet was closer to 2 but I wanted to use it up. The Cafe Noir chocolate was not very "coffee-y" so I doubt that added much flavor. Instead of one 8" cake, I made three small cakes (springform pans). They turned out great. They had a crisp but chewy crust with a wonderful lava-cake-like center. I served the cake with vanilla bean ice cream and a sprinkling of powdered sugar. My son loved it and wanted a whole cake for himself. Many of my friends are gluten free. I would share this recipe or bake this cake for them in a heartbeat. It's such a blank canvas; you could add anything to it such as vanilla, coffee, cayenne pepper, ginger - whatever you feel like.

This cake was nearly foolproof.. I did it with a double boiler, a wooden spoon, and a fork for kitchen tools. (I just moved so I am lacking on the whisk or mixer front..) To go with the cake, I made a chocolate sauce with cayenne spice and paired the cake and sauce with a mango sorbet. The presentation was gorgeous and the finished product has become one of my favorite desserts.

Loved this one! Simply amazing I glazed with a simple chocolate orange ganache made with some orange zest and conitreau. Then i topped it with orange segments dipped in the same ganache. INCREDIBLE!!! Had the whole neighborhood here and ended up making two!!! Best part was I had all the stuff in the house already!!!

This recipe is one of the easiest cake recipes ever. It's also the perfect size for a small dinner party.The problem was that the cake had four crater-like depressions on its top after it cooled. Possibly the egg wasn't whisked through enough. It tasted fine and the cosmetic flaws didn't bother anyone. I'll try this recipe again, but if it looks like the one I made yesterday, I'll go back to my old recipe for flourless chocolate cake.

Rating: 4
For the bold or those who want more depth, I usually add a little splash of vanilla and/ or strongly brewed coffee. Another addition to mix things up a bit is to add just a detectable amount of heat to the chocolate, maybe some cayenne pepper or something else with a punch.

The cake is rich and delicious, and much like many of the flourless chocolate tortes from restaurants. The test is comparable to "lava cake" without the melted fudge. The recipe is easy and delicious, and is wonderful with a homemade vanilla bean frosting or vanilla bean ice-cream.

This is a keeper! Really easy to make, and delicious. To make it just like bakery-bought flourless choc cake, I topped it with chocolate ganache from Flourless Chocolate Cake With Chocolate Ganache (this website, Bon Appetit 1/99). Served it with mounded raspberries on top and it was a hit. Not as heavy and rich as some recipes, which we preferred, and we also found that it was more dense (and delicious) the next day (covered, in fridge overnight, and served at room temp). Next time I will make it 1 day ahead on purpose. Also I will start checking for done about 5 mins early as I think it could have come out a few minutes earlier. A great recipe to vary with vanilla, dried coffee powder, etc. as others have suggested. I used good quality chocolate.

When I realized I messed up our x-mas eve dessert, I decided to make this as a quick alternative. It came together in a flash and tasted great. Very chocolaty.

I'll definitely make this again - even if it's not an emergency. :)

this was perfect as a quick and easy way to satisfy even the most indulgent chocolate craving! for the reviewer who was looking for more depth...maybe you can try my modifications (or play with some more of your own?)--i threw in a splash of vanilla (seems wrong not to use vanilla when i bake), a few drops of almond extract, probably about 1/4 tsp of cinnamon (i didn't measure), and about 2-3 tbsp grand marnier. i didn't have an 8" pan, so i used a 9" pan and baked it about 18 min. it turned out perfect! definitely de-stresed us girls while we studied for exams!

I'm not rating this recipe, as I didn't follow it as written. Instead, I took some of the reviewers' suggestions, some of which did not work well for me. First, be sure that you don't use chocolate that is *too* dark. I used half Valrhona 71% and half Valrhona 85%. In the future, I would probably use 60%, as (even though I adore dark chocolate) the resulting cake was just too bitter/chalky. Second, don't cut down on the sugar the first time that you make it. I used about 2/3c sugar instead of 3/4c, and (even though I habitually reduce the sugar in a recipe) it just didn't work quite right. Third, the texture of the cake was moist, but very crummy. I'm not sure how to fix that. I'd have preferred the brownie texture that other reviewers achieved. I did bake it for 20 minutes -- perhaps that was too long? In the end, I served the cake with a generous dollop of cocoa whipped cream (recipe from Joy of Cooking). This saved the cake from being a complete flop. In short, I would recommend trying the recipe as written the first time you make it.

Rating: 4
This was very good. I sliced the cake and then drizzled a thick raspberry sauce/jelly over individual slices. It looked very pretty served up on white plates, and the kids loved it! I did beat the egg whites separately and the cake came out great.

"Better than brownies" Is some of the comments I got from friends and co workers! Very easy to make and I used Ghirardelli chocolate, couldn't find the lime sorbet but used coconut instead. It was not bad.

Rating: 3
This recipe is exceptional but not perfect (and having read the reviews, I was expecting perfection). I think a flourless chocolate cake needs a bit more depth. I did add some powdered cardamom to the batter & dusted the top with cinammon after baking (both of which I recommend) but felt it still needed something more. Next time I will mix cardamon & cinammon with the powdered coca before sifting & use a bittersweet chocolate with a higher percentage of cocoa (I was at 60%). Then, I may attain perfection. I think vanilla would also be a nice addition, but am unsure if adding this would ruin the consistency?

I used trader joe's cocoa and Scharfenberger chocolate. Following prior reviewer's advice, I beat the egg yolks on high speed to get them fluffy before adding them. It came out very moist and dense but not in a brownie like way to me--more like fudge, which was great! It did, however, have two big lumps from air pockets that were rather hideous. So I had to frost the whole thing with a very thin layer of lightly sweetened whipped cream. But still, the recipe was great!

Rating: 4
What more can you want? Delicious, easy, and very rich chocolate cake. I made it twice--the first time with Hersheys cocoa and ghiradelli chips and the second with fancy Scharfenberger for both. I actually thought it was better the first time--the more expensive chocolate cake was a bit dry and crumbly. So if I do it again, I might just go the inexpensive route. Great with homemade whipped cream and berries.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe since 1999 or 2000; trying different combinations of chocolate and using Splenda at times. This time I used Scharffen Berger 60% chocolate bars and Hershey's dark chocolate powder. I also used just 1/2 cup of sugar. I beat the 3 eggs by themselves before adding to the mixture. I use a 9" springform pan and it is done in 25 minutes. This 'cake' travels well - it's really very 'brownie' like. So easy and soooo good!

i made this for my boyfriend's birthday and it was a success. however, even though i know flourless cakes are meant to be dense, this was really heavy. i might try the egg whites separately whipped next time. i used scharffenberger bittersweet chocolate, and ghirardelli cocoa, and agree that the quality was critical here - you could really taste it. i increased the quantitites by 1/2 for a 9"pan: 6 oz. chocolate, 1 cup sugar, 5 eggs, and 3/4 cup cocoa powder, baked for 25 minutes. Dusted with cocoa powder and served with warm raspberry coulis (pureed frozen raspberries and a little sugar), fresh raspberries, and sorbet. Looked really beautiful with a cluster of fresh raspberries in the center. yum! keeps well too - i made it the night before.

I gave this a two-fork rating, but I think it would have been higher if I'd made the recipe as stated. I was trying for a relatively low-carb dessert for a prediabetic family member, so I used half sugar and half Splenda, which I think interfered with the texture of the finished cake and caused me to overbake the cake. The top never formed a thin crust in the oven, as the recipe directed. Of course, including the Splenda compromised the flavor, too. I don't think this is a bad recipe; I'm just submitting my review for purposes of data collection. :)

I made this for Valentine's day dessert. Followed the recipe exactly, didn't separate the eggs and used the microwave to melt the chocolate so it was a one-bowl recipe. Baked it for 25 min., next time will try 20, but it was still outstanding! Didn't have a doily so used wax paper and cut out hearts, sifted powdered sugar over it for the Valentine theme. This is definitely a 'show off' dessert but so simple. Loved it!!

Fast. Easy. Delicious. No fancy ingredients or complicated prep. I tripled the recipe and added four ounces of unsweetened baking chocolate to reduce the sweetness. Lined the cake pans with crisco'd parchment and had no trouble removing cakes. I baked all three 8" cakes in the oven at the same time, alternating position midway through with no ill effects. As others have commented, this is just the beginning of a terrific dessert. Depending on the season, different sauces can really jazz it up, e.g., hot fudge sauce, Grand Marnier & Orange sauce, raspberry sauce -- the possibilities are endless -- with of course fresh lightly sweetened whipped cream!

This is a delicious jumping-off point for a really gourmet dessert. I made the cake as directed, then dumped half a bag of frozen berries into a saucepan and cooked into a sauce with about a teaspoon of cornstarch added as a thickener. It was perrrrrrfect. And took no time at all to make! I'll definitely make this one again.

Superb!!! Very impressive (but not visually), an excellent light texture and very easy...in fact the hardest part was converting it all to metric. :) It does need decorating though, just icing sugar and strawberries seem to do the trick. If you use a big glass bowl and melt the chocolate and butter in the microwave, this is a one bowl recipe (and what a lickable bowl it is!).

Made this for an additional dessert for Easter. Very rich and chocolatey. Fudge-like consistancy.

Used a springform pan and parchment paper it worked great.

I made this recipe 1 day ahead of serving, and I followed the tip of whipping the egg whites separately and folding in. The cake was delightfully moist and VERY chocolatey, and not too sweet imo. I served it with a side of cherries macerated in kirsch liqueur. If using dairy isn't a problem, creme fraiche, or whipped cream would be a lovely addition. I understand that there are pre-whipped frozen soy milk toppings, but have never tried those. Next time I might try a spring form pan, but the cake easily came out of the pan prepared according to the recipe. This recipe is a winner both for incredible ease of preparation (and ingredients anyone is likely to have on hand) as well as its suitability for Passover or non-dairy diets. The flavor is definitely tied to giving it at least one day to mellow. I rarely give out 4 forks, but this one comes close, call it 3.5

I've made this dish twice and it's absolutely scrumptious. There was quite a difference between the first and second time, though I'm not quite sure why... anyway, I was told yesterday that by my very fussy guest that it was possibly the best chocolate cake he'd ever had! It was yummy... dense almost fudgey, and fine to eat on its own. The only thing I would recommend is cutting down a bit on the sugar esp if you're planning on eating it with ice cream. Wonderful recipe and soooo easy!!!

What a great recipe! It could not be any easier to make (and I'm a fairly hopeless cook, so if I can do it, anyone can), and it is completley delicious. It's also very versatile - you can serve it with a variety of different toppings (ice cream, whip cream, berries, sauces) to suit the crowd that will be eating it. Like some other reviewers, I just melted the chocolate and butter in the microwave (about 2 mins), and haven't noticed any difference.

i made this twice, first by the book. it was very good with ice cream, etc, but wasn't good on its own. it was just too dense. the second time, i whipped the egg whites separately and folded them in at the end, as recommended in some reviews. i also added a shot of dark dark rum because i am a lush. maybe if you have super elite chocolate, you don't need the rum. but i used trader joe's choc and cocoa powder and found that these more middle class ingredients appreciated the flavor boost provided by the rum. anyhow, with these adjustments, the texture and flavor were much improved, but still incredibly dense and chocolately.

I rarely give 4-fork ratings--maybe that means I'm not a great cook and things don't usually turn out as they should, but this cake was great. Quick, easy and delicious. I didn't happen to have super premium chocolate on hand so used good old semi-sweet chocolate chips and Herseys cocoa and it was absolutely fine. Served with vanilla ice cream and a tart raspberry coulis. Try it.

This recipe is fabulous! It is sooo easy! I doubled the recipe (thank goodness)and poured the batter into a 9 inch springform pan. I baked it for exactly twenty minutes and it turned out perfect!

This cake is FANTASTIC. It is a snap to make, the ingredients are easily found in any grocery store, and my guests raved about it. I am not a baker. I love to cook, but I usually buy dessert or accept the offer when a guest suggests they supply dessert for a party. This recipe did not intimidate me one little bit and the result was MARVELOUS. I served it on a bed of raspberry coulis with a dollop of whipped cream and this was the perfect combination. The cake is a CHOCOHOLICS DREAM, but for guests who needed to cut the richness of the cake they could scoop up a little extra raspberry with every bite. It is so good that I am seriously considering eating the leftovers for breakfast.

Why not add another 4-fork rating to the already enormous list of excellent reviews this cake has received? The recipe deserves it. This is a ridiculously simple (even for an inept baker such as myself), decadent, cost-effective, non-fussy, impressive-tasting, quick chocolate cake. It certainly is flexible in terms of presentation/accompaniment - from ganache to coulis to nuts or confectioner's sugar - my humble opinion being that with a cake this rich and delicious, keep it simple and let the chocolate speak for itself. A dollop of creme frache or very lightly sweetened fresh whipped cream is a wonderful compliment. Beware of overbaking... better slightly underdone than overdone on this one, or the heavenly moist and dense texture is lost.

Rating: 4
This is a very elegant and amazingly delicious dessert without complicated procedures. I did cheat - threw chocolate and butter into a bowl and zapped it on high for 2.5 minutes in the microwave. This can be taken to higher hights by adding coconut or ancho chili powder - I just happened to have creme fraiche and served a dollop on a slice - wow. Yes it is very chocolaty - but then that's the point - rather like saying an opera has too many notes if you think this has too much chocolate. This comes in handy when you have dinner guests who have wheat intolerance. A keeper, thanks.

I used different chocolates I had left over in the kitchen from other recipes -- 2 oz of Callebaut semi-sweet, 2 oz of Hershey's Unsweetened (I tend to like desserts less sweet), and Scharffen berger unsweetened cocoa. I otherwise followed the directions precisely, and the cake was delicious. The best thing about this cake is that it's fun to make. I enjoyed every part of the process, and for that reason am likely to bake again.

THe BEST "chocolate emergency" recipe that can be whipped up in minutes when you simply must have chocolate :-) Just a handful of ingredients that are easy to keep in your pantry, and takes only minutes. (A tip: as soon as you make this, buy some more chocolate to have ready for another emergency :-) To make this really quickly, use the microwave to melt the chocolate, and it doesn't seem to matter what kind of pan you cook it in - I leave it in the oven for no more than 15 minutes to make sure it stays super-dense and moist instead of cakey. Nothing satisfies that deep chocolatge urge like this!

TIP for LOW CARBERS & FRENCH COOKS: A tip for everyone for a superior cake follow some classic french cooking techniques. Melt the choc & butter as described, and have on hand 2 more bowls. In one, put the yolks and beat with sugar/sweetner till thick. In the other, beat whites till triple in volume (you can add cream of tartar as a stabilizer too, to prevent collapsing), and set aside. Cool choc mixture, and SLOWLY dribble choc into yolks. (And not the other way around!) If you are hasty, you will cook them instead and ruin the recipe. When mixed, fold in the whites in 3 equal scoops, don't worry if you have some white patches- better this than overmixed. Bake in oven as per recipe, do not open the door. You will have a higher, more velvety result! Low carbers: the secret to getting this to work with unsweetened choc is to make sure you have the right sweetness as you go along, so taste it at every step. To get the least "artificial" flavour, mix different sweetners. I use a bit of Splenda, and both white and brown Sugar Twin. I also bite the bullet and add the tiniest amount of icing sugar into the melting chocolate, maybe 1 tbsp max- you really can't totally fool Mother Nature when it comes to the chemistry of baking. For the few extra carbs, I'd rather have a smaller slice of something delicious than a larger piece of not-as-good cake. If you do all of the above, you'll be in heaven with this recipe!

Oh my!!! Decadent, mouth-watering... This was so easy to make and like my mother said, it tastes like a restaurant $8 dessert. Really yummy if you are a chocholic. Great dense texture and not too sweet either. I didn't try the sorbet that goes with it. I made a chocolate sauce that I drizzled on the plate. It might be good with raspberries.

Rating: 4
Very simple, delicious and quick. I was making this cake for a kosher household, so I had to use pareve margarine, but it worked out fine since the chocolate is so incredibly intense. Also, since I couldn't serve this with whipped cream, I made a chocolate ganache (semisweet chocolate and water) to frost it--it looked beautiful and tasted great. The easiest, quickest dessert of its kind that I ever made!

This is not the most amazing recipe ever, but it is excellent considering the extremely easy preparation. I would serve it at something casual or just make it for myself. It is actually better than a glorified brownie. It is rather moist, and I prefer a crumbly flourless cake, so I will slightly reduce the butter next time.

I've made this cake twice. The first time it was two forks worthy, to be honest-all it tasted like was a brownie made into cake form (to be fair, I didn't use the best chocolate, just a Baker's bar I had in the pantry). I decided to give it another chance last night for dinner at a friend's house. This time, I used Ghiradelli's bittersweet baking chocolate, 1/4 regular cocoa, 1/4 cup Dutch process cocoa (both Hershey's), and I topped it with both types of cocoa and sliced almonds. I served the cake over a simple strawberry sauce (puree 1 16 oz package fresh berries, stemmed and hulled, and 2 tbs powdered sugar in a blender in a blender until smooth). WOW! I will definately be making this again with the variations, and it earns four forks.

Rating: 3
This is actually between three and four forks considering how quick and easy this was to make.

Don't change anything!! This is a WONDERFUL dessert and so easy to make. It is not the prettiest looking cake, but with a little raspberry coulis and small scoop of really good quality vanilla ice cream, this is a dessert to rival any upscale restaurant. It is so rich and wonderful - you only need a really small piece. Don't forget to pop any leftovers in the microwave for a couple of seconds to get that melting rich chocolate taste!

I made this for a dinner party, and doubled the recipe and baked it in a 10" springform pan. It was good, but it had a powdery consistency. Maybe I over-cooked it (I added on an additional 5+ minutes to bake) I might try it again, but will underbake to see if that makes a difference.

This has become my signature dessert! It's so easy to make ahead that I knocked out 5 for a summer engagement supper at my house and served it with raspberry coulis and mint sprigs. I've served it to my book club with high-end raspberry sorbet. (I prefer the coulis because I find that something cold like sorbet on the tongue sometimes dulls my taste buds to the intensity of the chocolate, which is not the desired effect, right?) At last night's pot luck Christmas party I served 11 with two cakes topped with peppermint ice cream (breaking my own cold tongue rule) and (sparing) hot fudge sauce. Unless I'm serving my mother (who is allergic to corn and wheat), I use the December 1997 Chocolate Glaze published as an accompaniment to the Gianduia Torte. Half a recipe of that is enough for one cake, and talk about easy! I actually used that same recipe last night for my fudge sauce. And for the tea I'm hosting Wednesday, I'm going to make this cake in a square pan and cut into tiny squares to be eaten with the fingers. (Pinky elevated, of course.)

I don't consider myself a cook, much less a good cook, but this recipe made me feel brilliant--I actually did a little happy dance in the kitchen when I tasted it. It's something I'd be proud to serve at a dinner party--tastes fancy and is so simple to make. The cake came out thinner than I expected and wasn't much to look at, but that's easy to remedy with any one of the options other reviewers mentioned here. Next time I make this, I'll probably increase the recipe and cooking time some, and serve it with fresh raspberries. Simple, and SO yummy.

This was easy and absolutely delicious. I doubled the recipe, used a 10" spring form pan, and increased the cooking time to 35-40 min. I topped the cake with fresh whipping cream and fresh raspberries.

Worked great for a quick weeknight dinner party. Used ghiradelli powder and a generic semisweet belgian chocolate--will try a higher quality next time, but don't let the fact that you don't have the good stuff in the pantry keep you from trying this recipe. Because I was pushed for time, I simply served this with unsweetened whipped cream. Would like to add a bit of grand marnier and zest next time.

I made this cake for Sunday dinner this past week. Everyone loved it. I followed the recipe as written only I served mine with a raspberry coolie and whipped cream. When I took it out of the oven it started to deflate and I was disappointed but when we tasted it I found that it was very dense, rich, and pure heaven.

This is the exact same recipe for flourless chocolate cake with caramel sauce, also on this website. The only difference is the chocolate quality. I have made both, and highly recommend Valrhona. The cake is fantastic and fast!

Wow, rave reviews for this cake from the 15 people who ate it - and it's so easy to make!!! I used Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate, doubled the recipe, used a 10" springform pan, and made a chocolate ganache/glaze for it (2/3 c heavy cream, 2 Tbsp light corn syrup, 8 oz bittersweet chocolate), and it was fabulous! I would definitely make this again! (And it *is* really good with the coconut lime sorbet =-)

Fantastic !!! I added fresh pitted cherries and a bit of cream to the batter; made it moist and even more delicious. Served it with a sauce of cherries, kirsch and powdered sugar.

For those of you curious about baking with sugar substitutes, I made this cake with Splenda. I noticed a few things that I think were due to the Splenda 1) the cake was not sweet enough- and I LOVE super dark chocolate, so I dont require much sweetness to keep me happy. but, served with frozen yogurt or ice cream made up for that. 2) Splenda gave it an aftertaste. But, my guests raved about it nevertheless. I think the ice cream (we used low fat, low carb/sugar yogurt from Penguin's) was key. This recipe is great with Splenda, so I'm sure its awesome with real sugar.

Rating: 4
I've been making it for more than 6 years for all those who work in my family's enterprise -and everyone who tried it, likes it so far. The easier way I learned to make it -when I do not have much time left- motivates me to often have it to serve; it also can be kept for a long time!!

This is the second time I have made this cake. The first time I made it I hadn't enough unsweetened cocoa so I used a little less than 1/4 cup of Ghiradelli's Chocolate Mocha Hot Chocolate. I knew that it might be a little sweeter. It created an extremely rich flavor. The second time I also used the combination and Valhona 71% Bitterweet Chocolate. I also tried not to whisk any more than necessary and that produced about a 50% higher cake. It's delicious with warm berries.

I served this with a chocolate-almond ice cream made from the same chocolate combo I used for the cake (Ghirardelli Bittersweet and Dark Sweet chocolate). Delicious! The cake was a perfect consistency to serve with rich homemade ice cream; you could eat it easily with a spoon.

This was the simplest thing that turned out to be fantastic and my family loved it. I served it with a vanilla creme sauce and fresh berries, but it was also just as good on it's own. This is one of those perfect impromptu desserts that you can whip up with so few ingredients in less than 30 minutes.

How about using sugar free chocolate in lieu of the regular, and splenda? Any thoughts? I'd love to find a low carb treat like this.

Great fast recipe, and sooooo easy! I had a dinner party to go to and little time to make a dessert. I doubled the recipe to make 2 cakes. I added 2 TBS amaretto and 1 tsp almond extract when adding the eggs. I also sprinkled a generous amount of slivered almonds atop each cake before baking. Served with amaretto flavored whipped cream. Delicious! Everyone loved it. Will definitely make this again and again. Next time I will double to make 2 cakes and assemble like a layer cake with a ganache filling.

Rating: 3
I made this recipe in the past using semi-sweet chocolate and real sugar and it came out great. However, I am now low-carbing and made the mistake of using unsweetened chocolate even though the recipe specifically says not to, and used Splenda in place of sugar. It was horrible. I take full credit for it being so nasty, DO NOT USE UNSWEETENED CHOCOLATE!!! No matter how much sweetener I added it tasted awful. Not the Splenda's fault, I use it all the time with great results. Just too much bitterness from the chocolate, it was overpowering.

Rating: 3
This is a very simple and delicious cake. However it came out looking hideous. It got stuck in my heart shaped pan (although I buttered and cocoa powdered it) and and had to be coaxed out and cobbled back together. I tried to camouflage it with cocoa powder. But the cake itself is fantastic! Very chocolatey. I used an Venezuelan chocolate with 71% cocoa.

Rating: 3
Word of caution: don't try to make this in a springform pan. Novice bakers like me might think it would be ok but you'll get a giant (really giant) bubble on the bottom and it ruins the cake. I guess air gets in through the seam of the pan and gets stuck under the cake. Oh well. This has happened to me twice, the first time I thought my parchment had a wrinkle in it.

Rating: 3
I doubled the recipe and used a 9-inch pan. The cake turned out great, though it did puff out a bit over the lip of the pan. After I flipped it out onto a rack, I just sliced off the puffed out part and it was perfect. I covered it with a chocolate ganache and garnished with strawberries. Amazing!

This is so easy and so good. Great served warm with vanilla icecream. I didn't go to the trouble of using the wax paper, just buttered the dish and it was fine.

This was extremely easy to make. It took minimal amounts of time. I prepared this while making dinner. Very easy to make. I received great reviews from all the eaters (who finished it). I sprinkled some confectioner sugar on top once the cake cooled and served ice cream (vanilla or choco) on the side.

Rating: 4
This cake was easy to make and everyone loved it. Based on the reviewer whose cake was only 1/2 inch thick, I doubled the recipe and made it 2 layers. I used 8 inch cake pans and each layer turned out to be nearly an inch thick. I stacked and frosted the layers with Chocolate Rasperry Frosting (also on Epicurious, it's the one with sour cream and butter.) It was incredibly moist rich and intense. Kind of like eating a giant truffle.

Rating: 4
This is a favorite of mine that I make again and again - never fails to be a crowd-pleaser. For a little extra decadence, I make a chocolate glaze (you can search for it on this site) that is fantastic. Have also found Lindt to be the best chocolate for making this. You will not be sorry.

Rating: 4
This is a dinner party favorite. Lindt's Excellence dark chocolate is a good choice. I double the recipe, and bake in the round, shallow corning ware pan with a buttered parchment paper round I cut for the bottom. Turn it out on a decorative plate, peel the parchment paper, and then do the powdered sugar through a doily trick. Beautiful, rich, and delicious with a scoop of good vanilla ice cream, especially is served warm.

Rating: 3
The beauty of this cake is its simplicity and ease. After reading some other reviews which complained of thin and unattractive, but otherwise delicious, results, I decided to make the cake twice and assembled the two with a simple chocolate ganache. The glaze helped to shape the uneven surfaces and keep the cake moist for the few days it took to eat it. The doubled height was a more satisfactory 2+ inches, and allowed me to divide it into many more slices, each incredibly rich.

Rating: 4
Decadent! I served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, sprinkled the cocoa powder over both, and then followed with both a raspberry and a chocolate sauce drizzled overtop it all. My guests were all moaning and grunting with delight as they ate. :0) It was beyond rich and moist, even though it looks blah when cooked --don't be fooled!)

Rating: 4
This cake was amazingly good. I did a "practice run" with Baker's chocolate; didn't want to use the really good stuff in case it was a flop. (high altitude + old oven = many disasters.) I added the zest of one orange, and it came out heavenly. If I add a flavor like that again (pepperment maybe?) I will not bother with more expensive chocolate. And it was easy! The only thing I'd like to improve is the look. Mine came out very thin, 1/2" high in an 8" springform pan.

Rating: 4
So easy and soo good -- a crowd pleaser every time -- I serve it with good quality vanilla icecream and either strawberry or raspberry sauce!

Fantastic!!! This cake was devoured at my last dinner party. I used Ghiradelli chocolate in the cake, and topped it with a rich glaze made this way: boil half a cup of heaving whipping cream and half a cup of dark corn syrup. Remove from heat and stir in 9 ounces of finely chopped semisweet or bittersweet chocolate. Spread half of glaze on top and sides of cooled cake. Put cake in freezer for 3 minutes. Pour rest of glaze on top of cake. Allow to fully set in the refridgerator for one hour.

Rating: 4
Fantastic! Increased the recipe by about 1/2: I used 6 oz. Scharffen Berger chocolate, 1 cup sugar, 5 eggs, and 3/4 cup cocoa powder in a 9-inch pan, baked for 25 minutes. Came out perfectly, looked really pretty just dusted with cocoa. Served it with raspberry sauce and Hagen Daz vanilla ice cream--a big hit with the whole crowd.

This was a really great recipe, I did grease the pan really well, and that made a difference it was not crumbly at all , I made it for my brother-in-law who has Celiac disease and cant have flour and he raved over it, Served it with fresh strawberries and whipped cream... Delicious

This cake was very easy to make and enjoyed by all. Mine didn't come out crumbly or "unattractive" as some reviewers said. Perhaps because I also papered and waxed the sides of the baking dish? To serve, I dusted the top with cocoa, cut a star-shaped stencil from cardboard and dusted powdered-sugar stars on top. Added fresh whipped cream, raspberries and raspberry coulis. Looked beautiful and was delicious!

This was the easiest dessert ever! My twist was that I made individual servings in metal brioche cups. I purposely under cooked the center to have a molten chocolate lava cake effect. Very delicious! The baking time is about 11 minutes for this. First time I did it, I waited about 2 minutes too long and it was almost baked through. Excellent recipe!

Fabulous and easy! My only change was to add a tablespoon of coffee liqueur. I am not found of dusted cocoa, so I combined equal parts of (melted)bittersweet chocolate & butter mixed w/ heavy cream to make a shiny glaze. Served it with rasberry sauce, a few fresh rasberries and a bit of whipped cream. PURE BLISS!!

To the cook from 1/24/2003, try Valrohna or Scharffen Berger (see Epicurious recipe for chocolate fondue) for superlative results. Other chocolates use lesser quality ingredients -- which results in an inferior finished product. Good luck!

Yum! This cake was so good hot--my only question is: the next day when I had a bite, there was something funny about the consistency, like little waxy bits. So did I not whisk it well enough or was the chocolate not fine enough (ghirardelli's bittersweet bar)? Thanks & happy eating!

This is more like a brownie than a cake... but what a delicious brownie it is! Very, very easy as well. This has a lovely, rich chocolate flavor, not overly sweet. I ate it with sour cherries, which I think complemented it nicely and cut the richness flavor a bit. I would not serve anything too sweet alongside of it.

Very good and very easy. Everyone loved it and kept asking, "is it complicated?". Served it with home made ice cream and zigzagged some chocolate sauce (Also Epicurious.com) across the plate. It was perfect. Thanks Epicurious!!!

Very easy to prepare. I suggest buttering the sides of the pan. I used parchment instead of wax paper which was very effective. I added an even layer of finely chopped walnuts to the pan before pouring in batter and melted cocolate chips on top while the cake was still hot to form a 'crust.' I then put more parchment on the chocolate and flipped onto a plate.

Rating: 4
A winner! Could not be easier or better. I always get asked for the recipe and prep time is only about 5 minutes. I like to sprinkle it lightly with powdered sugar (shows up nicer than cocoa, and doesn't taste bitter) and serve with Haagen-Dazs Swiss Almond Fudge ice cream.

This recipe didn't work quite as well as I had hoped, but the end result was definitely still edible ;) Some tips - be sure not to over cook it - I have a powerful oven and cooked it for about 23 minutes, which was too long, and it ended up a little dry. Also, use extra large eggs or 4 of the 'normal' sized ones - I used regular large eggs and mine definitely could have used another. Of course, use the best bittersweet chocolate with the highest cocoa percentage you can find.

Udes Belcolade chocolate....it came out wonderful Everyone loved it....and since it's so rich, a little goes a long way. It kept well wrapped in plastic wrap, still moist after nearly a week. I would make this again...it's very easy and quick! :o)

This was INTENSELY chocolate. I think it was more because I used Schauffenberger, and doubled the recipe in a 10" pan (little too much). If dark fudge could be made to taste like a brownie, it would be close to the taste of this cake. I *highly* recommend a light contrast for the flavor, like sorbet or a fruit topping. I wish I could have made the coconut lime sorbet, but did vanilla instead with macadamia nuts and chocolate glaze (from another flourless choc. cake here). It does present like a restaurant dessert when iced/glazed (looks like a round brownie if not).

This was almost orgasmic it was so delicious. I've spent several dollars just for a serving of a chocolate cake that looked good, but I'd rather save my money and my tastebuds for FLOURLESS CHOCOLATE CAKE. It freezes well and can be dressed up with fresh fruit, powdered sugar, edible flowers on a sterling silver platter. And...I've made it with half the amount of butter and it suffered none! I doubled the recipe and made it in a 10" springform pan. I also beat the eggwhites and folded them in to make it lighter.

Much easier than my previous flourless chocolate cake recipe. This is really rich and dense, more like a brownie, which is how flourless cakes are supposed to be.

Good cold but also great heated with ice cream. Made this twice already and will make again. It's really easy.

Excellent cake. I varied the recipe a bit, and took a earlier suggestion of adding cinnamon. Also, I used the glaze technique from another flourless cake recipe, halved it and served the cake cold.

I have made this cake many times and am always asked for the recipe. In reading the numerous reviews I noticed that nobody made the coconut lime sorbet! The combination of the two flavors is amazing.

I had 30 minutes to amaze my future sister and brother-in-law with my culinary talents and I picked this amazing little treat. I added a teaspoon of powdered espresso and for grins I baked it in a water bath. It was perfect. It rose only slightly and was smooth and shiny and set up just perfectly at 25 min in the oven. I served it slightly warm with vanilla ice cream. Next time I might use softly whipped very lightly sweetened whipped cream. I used Sharfen Berger (sp?) chocolate, semisweet and it was definately worth the cost. My fiance put it in the fridge and wolfed it down the next day cold. Romph!

Wow! This cake is so quick to make, and easy. I made this for the first time tonight. I can't believe I'm admitting this, but the first cake I made I forgot the entire stick of butter. After I buttered the pan and wax paper, I set it down on the counter instead of putting it in with the chocolate. Didn't realize it until it was already baking. Let it go and tasted it when it was finished. It was fantastic. I also added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon to the batter because I like nothing better than chocolate and cinnamon together. I made a second cake with the butter (I'm supposed to bring it to work tomorrow so I thought I should do it right), it's cooling now. I'm sure it's going to be even better. But it's good to know if you want to save the zillion grams of fat, it works without the butter. On both, I used an 8" doilie with lots of cut outs and placed it on top of the cake, then sprinkled a mix of Ghiradelli sweet chocolate powder and cocoa powder on top to form a very pretty design. I'm so glad I found this recipe. Now I'll always have a very tasty, quick dessert to make for any occasion that's sure to please many.

Excellent & easy recipe. I only had a 9" pan (not the 8") so I increased the recipe by about 25%, which worked well - otherwise the cake would have been too thin. Made raspberry coulis by blending raspberries, sugar, and lemon juice and served that on the side along with raspberry sorbet.

This is a nice recipe for flourless chocolate cake--it can be made in a pretty short time and doesn't cost an arm and a leg to buy the ingredients.

This was very easy and quick. I made it last minute for a party and people loved it. It is serious chocolate, though. Not for the faint of heart.

It is amazing that a website as benign as this could generate the animosity displayed by the Boston/NYC/LA viewer. I you don't respect other people's opinions, do not read their reviews. While you are at it, decide WHICH town you are from and stick to it.

Hhmmm. Interesting comments from the cook in Boston. Clearly, a website such as Epicurious is going to attract cooks of all skill levels. What an experienced cook may find quick & easy may prove quite demanding & time-consuming to the novice cook. I am a professional cook & often find myself disagreeing with other cooks (whose opinions I respect) over the merits of a particular recipe. We all - thank goodness - have different likes & dislikes, varying palates & preferences. If this were not the case, there would be a very limited number of recipes around !

This recipe is about as simple as it gets for a "scratch" cake. It's absolutely delicious. In the event that there is any ambiguity in the first ingredient, I bought "Baker's 100% Pure Bittersweet Chocolate". I served freshly whipped cream with this cake. The intensity of the chocolate flavour is...... well.... all I can say is TRY IT!!

This recipe is easy and delicious ! My father was asking for more. Everyone one at work just raved. I'm not a cake person, but I make this recipe alot. It is especially wonderful for chocoholics who are in a hurry but need to impress ! It always turns out great !

I've made this several times and always get rave reviews from all my guests. I used the advice of one of the other cooks in the review who suggested cutting back the corn syrup, and it still turned out fine. Sometimes the cake cracks more than others, but even if it doesn't look stunning, it tastes so good that it doesn't really matter.

This is an excellent recipe to convert those like me who are skeptical of most cake recipes. I thought it was deep, intense and satisfying in its flavor and texture, and I'd make it again for guests. I'd serve it with a raspberry coulis!

This was fabulously easy and everyone loved it! I served it for New Year's dinner. VERY important to use a good quality chocolate; I used Hawaiian Vintage Chocolate (www.hawaiianchocolate.com) and everyone could tell that it was something special.

Wonderfully quick and easy dessert which turns out decadently chocolate. Great with vanilla ice cream.

This cake was very easy to make, however, it doesn't look pretty on top, even when inverted. I served this w/ a chocolate whipped cream. Next time I would make a chocolate glaze for the top to cover up the cracks.

I made this dessert for Christmas Eve and it was a hugh success. I served it with whipped cream and a cranberry-raspbery sauce on the side to make it a little more festive. The cake was moist and delicious and I will make this again soon.

I thought this turned out a little dry, but it could be my fault as I used a 9" cake pan rather than 8" pan. The top was very concave, so I filled with Cinnamon Whipped Cream. I also passed fresh strawberry sauce with it, so the slight dryness was really not a problem. Really very easy, and guests liked it. Served 8.

This cake is as good as it is easy! It is moist, rich and served warm with ice cream or whipped cream....to die for! I would highly recommend making it for any special occasion.

The flavour of this cake is wonderful! I'm a chocolate addict and there isn't a more chocolatey cake anywhere! However, because of its richness, I tended to think more along the lines of "brownies" and cut it up into squares and topped them with icing. As a cake, or as brownies, this cake is a must!

My husband made this for my Birthday. Probably the 1st thing he ever baked. It was out of this world, everyone loved it. The most decadent chocolate cake I ever had. This is now my mandatory Birthday cake.

This was very easy to make and tasted delicious. I definitely plan to make it again. Next time I won't invert it though -- why serve the ugly side up? I sifted powdered sugar over the end product and served it with cinnamon whipped cream. Yummy!

This is one of the best and easiest flourless chocolate cakes that I have ever made. I have made it a number of times and receive rave reviews every time I have made it.
