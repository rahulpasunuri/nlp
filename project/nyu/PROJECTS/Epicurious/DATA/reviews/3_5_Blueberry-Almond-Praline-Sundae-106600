I made this dish for Father's day. My husband and I were both amazed at how easy it is to prepare and how delicious it turned out. The blueberry sauce melted the ice cream slightly, and the praline provided a wonderful contrast in taste and texture. Can prepare the pralines ahead of time.

I've made the almond praline twice, and did a version of the sauce once (didn't have enough blueberries, so I added strawberries and made a mixed-berry sauce). The praline is tricky, it got a bit overdone the first time I made it, although was still tasty.
