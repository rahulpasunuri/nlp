Yum-my! I brined the pork for less than a full day using the pp's recipe (apple cider, salt, brown sugar, etc), skipped the bacon and the pan sauce and this was a major hit for Thanksgiving. The stuffing is deceptively simple and delicious - I used homemade pain de mie for it, which surely helped. Most of mine didn't fit in the cavity so I added a splash of chicken broth to the rest and baked it In a casserole. Easy and delicious!

One of these annoying people who's rating a recipe they didn't follow exactly. But made this for Christmas, and it was great. Used a different stuffing (not that good) and didn't wrap the roast in bacon because I didn't want that smokey taste. Cooked it for 3 hours, to 160; let it rest for 30 mins and the temp rose to about 165. I don't like pink pork, and it was perfect, still tender and juicy but cooked through. Super easy and it looked really impressive.

The roast was amazing. Based on the glowing reviews of the stuffing I must have messed it up because I wasn't thrilled even though I followed it to the letter. Couple things about the roast. Mine was 9lbs - $43 from a local excellent butcher shop. I forgot to tell them to french (cut the meat off the tops of the bones) so I did it myself leaving about 3 inches of bare bone which were covered with aluminum foil. I brined it using the recipe from the previous reviewer with the apple cider, water, kosher salt and brown sugar overnight. I did not rinse the brine off. Capped it with the stuffing and put the rest of the double batch of stuffing in baking dish. I set the roast upright directly on the bottom of a roasting pan. 350 for about 3 hours. I pulled it at 150 degrees and it rose to 155 while resting for 30 minutes. When we cut it, it was PERFECT. Not overdone, juicy, tender and flavorful. Everyone raved and my 65 year brother who is an outstanding cook said it was the BEST pork roast he ever had. I served with the stuffing, truffled mashed potatoes and honey glazed carrots. I was really disappointed with the stuffing. You can't get much stuffing in the roast as it's not like there's a big hollow there - just the top. Maybe that was part of it. It seemed too tart and soggy. I may have over cooked the apples as they were really mushy? Prepping the stuffing is very time consuming. Next time I will make a more traditional stuffing but otherwise exactly the same for the pork.

I made this on the weekend for our annual Christmas potluck party and it was a HUGE hit! I brined it overnight in the fridge in: 6 cups of water, 6 cups of apple cider, 3/4 cup coarse salt and 1/2 brown sugar. I too doubled the stuffing but found that most of it didn't fit in the centre of the crown so I cooked most of it on the side (350 for 45 minutes). I made a large roast ( over 8 lbs) and there were no leftovers. It was delicious, a real winner!!

I have made this for two Christmas dinners now - it is REALLY good. I double the stuffing recipe and brine the pork a day in advance, otherwise don't change a thing. Served it with mashed sweet potatoes, green beans almondine, and a spinach salad with pears. Also a really great bottle of wine. :-) It always impresses!

A great recipe and of course, what a presentation! A few notes: I too doubled the stuffing, skipped the sugar, left the peels on the apples and cut them in chunks instead of wedges as called for. I also skipped the bacon on the bottom of the roast. I had a 10 lb roast and it was done in 2 hours - at 155 degrees. I served it with the Potato and Celery Root Gratin (from this site) and sauteed Green Beans. Dessert was Spiced Pears with Pumplin Ice Cream.

We had a late Christmas dinner for 7 adults last week and the entire menu was a huge hit - and may become a tradition. We did not brine the pork, but regardless, it was tender and delicious. Next time, I will double the stuffing, which was just the right amount to stuff the pork but not quite enough for the vacuum cleaners who came to dinner. I thought the glazed apples were redundant, but was overruled. We served balsamic glazed carrots, a red & green salad with pomegranate seeds, and toasted coconut cake with lime filling - all Gourmet recipes. A major production (the cake!) but 100% worth it.

I made this for our first family Christmas dinner at our house. I ordered the roast from a local rancher, 10 lb. beauty, it really makes a difference starting with an excellent meat. The stuffing was wonderful, especially with fresh herbs. I also left the skin on the granny smith apples which was fine. I used a red current jelly to finsih off the sauce and also made a rou to make it more of a gravy, very good. We decided to make this dinner a tradition for Christmas in our family! I served a root vegetable gratin, sauteed green beans and fresh baguette! Beautiful presentation and taste.

This was incredibly moist and tender! I brined for only 8 hours. Added rub of thyme and sage to roast. Cut the sugar like others recommended. Changed the gravy as I didn't have the jelly. Deglazed with wine and added shallots and chicken stock. Delicious too.

I served this for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it. I didn't brine it but it was still moist. I chose thick-cut applewood smoked bacon which contributed to the final moisture and overall taste of the pork. My family likes stuffing more wet than dry, so I added some chicken broth to the stuffing mix initially (maybe 1/2 cup). I also used a mix of artisinal bread and a nice honey wheat from my local market instead of white bread. I plan to make this again this year but do plan to brine it to see how that changes the outcome.

I served Thanksgiving dinner for 11 with this recipe and it was a huge hit! I doubled the stuffing as suggested and we barely had leftovers. My only complaint was that it had to cook for much longer than the recipe suggested, I was just lucky that we had plenty of munchies.

First, i had tried the stuffing out at Thanksgiving with our deep fried turkey. I added walnuts and used sourdough bread, it was good but too sweet. This time I left out the sugar and it was much better. We had it again with the Crown Pork Roast for Christmas Eve for 18 people, and my butcher made a 14 lb 22 rib roast. It would have been a lot heavier, but he cut off a lot of bone. I had the little hats and they wouldn't stay on as well with the bones cut down; tell your butcher that is an important part of the presentation...it was still delicious and beautiful, got a lot of compliments. I did brine it for 36 hours using the maple brine on this site. I cooked to 155 degrees, let it stand covered so the stuffing wouldn't dry out. I tripled the recipe of stuffing and had it on the side as well. I used all the meat drippings for a wonderful gravy-wow- which we prefer to that type of sauce...I will do it again, but for a smaller crowd- it would be easier to do on a smaller scale. By the way, I almost used the 22 min/per pound that another reviewer had suggested- it would have ruined it...it would have been more like five hours for a 14 lb roast instead of three and a half, which is how long it did take to get to 155 degrees...so go by temp not time...

Rating: 3
Get the largest the butcher can supply - 11 lbs or so. Maybe this will give more room for the stuffing. Make sure butcher frenches the ends well. Keep stuffing well-covered or it will be dry as a bone. Stuffing near the center is delicious, but there isn't much actual room for stuffing in the center. The pork meat gives the stuffing it's flavor, so, perhaps could cook extra stuffing in a glass dish w/ a couple of chops layered over it?? Try this on its own sometime to see if it works. Try the cider gravy from the other recipe; the meat would have benefitted from some gravy. Otherwise, it's fabulous.

I brined the crowned port roast for two days. I didn't do the stuffing (which might have contributed to the dryness) I cooked it to 155 and it was too done and tough. Would do again just wouldn't cook it so long.

This really is fabulous! Very easy and so beautiful. As another reviewer said, the stuffing is to die for. I would definitly double it next time around. I was a bit alarmed that there wouldn't be enough so I added some pork sausage and it added great flavor and stretched the quantity enough so that I had a small amount leftover. I baked the stuffing separate from the roast. Consequently, 2 hours was too long for the roast - it was a tad overdone but I had followed the suggestions to brine it and it was still very moist and flavorful. I didn't make the pan sauce but served it with roasted pear chutney (also on this site). Homemade applesauce and a vegetable gratin rounded out the meal.

The stuffing is "to die for" and a meal in itself. Definitely double or triple. But, used high tech thermometer and pork was over done. Used the brine suggestions for a second attempt with pork loin and was much more satisfied than with crown roast.

I'm giving this 4 forks for the stuffing - it makes this recipe. My only complaint is that there wasn't enough of it. Next time, I'd double the stuffing recipe.

This was delicious and very impressive looking. I brined it for 48 hours, did not use the bacon, added more bread in the stuffing and cooked the stuffing outside the roast because the cavity on my roast was very small. Even though I accidently left it in until it was over 160, it was moist and delicious.

This is a masterpiece meal and very easy to cook and prepare (time consuming, but straight forward). I brined using the recipe from "Grilled Maple-Brined Pork Chops." I also sat the roast on a bed of 1/4 inch sliced green apples. Because I doubled the stuffing there was no where to put the bacon (the whole crown was full) so I skipped it. However, I have to disagree with the reviewers who said to double the stuffing. We had far more than enough stuffing. And next time I'd go for a far smaller roast as well-- 11 pounds was 12 pork chops too much for our party of 8!

I have found that the key to a moist crown roast is to cook it on a bed of sliced apples. I use granny smith's, and as they break down while roasting,it gives the pan juices extra oomph! Used a medium dry white vermouth to deglaze the roasting pan to add complexity of the flavor without adding more sweetness to the dish. Got raves and will add it to my dinner company repertiore.

We smoked a turkey for Christmas this year and I was searching for something different for a "stuffing." This filled the bill perfectly, the sweet (I did use the sugar) and savory taste was perfect with the hickory smoked bird! I assembled it and then cooked it in a covered dish in the oven. I didn't add the parsley (not another trip to the market!) and will make it again and add a little more sage. I'll try it with the pork next time.

Rating: 4
A wonderful dish. We made it without sugar or cinnamon or nutmeg in the stuffing. We think parsley is superfluous so we left it out. We made double the stuffing for a stunning presentation. We also did not use any jelly in the pan sauce, but made gravy using apple cider and pan drippings. Everyone raved about it! We served it with braised red cabbage, roasted brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes and a cranberry, blue cheese and spiced walnut green salad.

I made this last night and it was delish! The stuffing really was great, and I doubled the recipe and mounded a lot in the center, and then made some in the oven beside it! Everyone was totally wowed by it, the presentation was very dramatic! I made my own pan gravy which was delicious as well. Everyone loved it and kept raving over it. I had no problem with the meat being dry, it was moist and perfect. Served with mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus.

This dish is amazing! Pork turned out so soft and tender and full with flavor. It is a great dish to make for company - the cut is not too expensive ($20 for 4 people with leftovers), the presentation is impressive and once you get in the oven, you don't have to check it or baste it for over 2 hours. We found that the sauce looked a bit thin, but tasted wonderful and once you got it over your pork, the pork instantly absorbed it. Stuffing was so good too. Do not skip toasting of the bread - it is key and adds a crunchy texture. We used sourdough that was a day old. Fresh herbes are also key. We served this roast with roasted vegetables and grilled asparagus (wrapped in proscuitto with parmeasan cheese and balsamic vinegar). Our guests were very impressed. We can't wait to make it again! Also try chocolate coconut fondue for desert - also from epicurious, it hit the spot after this delicate roast.

FAB! Not one complaint, only sounds of "yums" and "wows". I made this for a dinner party. Everyone raved about the stuffing. This recipe could not be simpler! A great presentation without much work. I made the stuffing the morning of the party and it was absolutely delicious, but could easily be prepared the night before. Watch the cooking time; the roast was done earlier than expected. I will DEFINITELY use this recipe again at my next dinner party.

Impressive and easy! I made two roasts(one on the grill but I took it out of the crown shape) for a huge christmas crowd and quadrupled the stuffing. I also cook the stuffing separately. I was too chicken to make the pan sauce so I made a traditional gravy with the pan drippings and it worked well. I have also made the stuffing separetly and served it with roast chicken or with pork chops.

The stuffed crown roast made for a beautiful presentation and received rave reviews from my guests. As suggested, I doubled the stuffing recipe and was glad I did because there was none left over. Although the apples give the stuffing a much sweeter taste than traditional stuffing, the flavor complimented the pork wonderfully. The pork was very good however I would reduce the cooking time in the future because it definitely turned out "medium" as opposed to a little pinker in the center which I prefer.

I didn't pay strict attention to the recipe and forgot to cover the stuffing with foil causing it to burn on top.Must cover it. Also, perhaps placing a pan of water in the oven would have made the meat a little less dry. To "kick up the gravey another notch" I added 1/4 cup Calvados apple brandy!

I made this for Christmas and it was fantastic. Based on the other reviews I really wanted to brine the roast. After reading several different brine recipes, I came up with my own that worked out very well. Here's what I did: I mixed 6 cups each water and apple cider, 3/4 cup kosher salt, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 3 t dried rubbed sage, 3 T ground black pepper, and a head of garlic cloves mashed with a knife and lightly chopped. I warmed this on stove to disolve the salt and brown sugar, then put the roast (about 5 1/2 lbs.) in. I put the covered pot in the fridge for 48 hours. I rinsed and patted the roast dry before proceeding with the recipe. I didn't buy the roast in the crown presentation. I also did the stuffing on the side (about 45 mins in the oven at 350 in a covered dish.) I may have missed out on the presentation, but the taste was fabulous!

The roast was out of this world. I was so proud to bring this to the Thanksgiving table. I did brine the roast for 8 hours first. I skipped the bacon. I did not put the stuffing in the center of the roast, but cooked it separatly. The stuffing was good, but not much of it got eaten, it could have just been that there were too many other dishes to sample! My only comment would be to those, who like myself, don't have much experience with buying less common cuts of meat, this was extremely expensive! I don't regret getting, it, but if cost is a factor, you might want to keep it in mind.

Divine! The roast was fork tender and delicious--I cooked it 22 minutes per pound as the butcher suggested. The stuffing was wonderful, although I think I cooked the apples with the spices and herbs at too high a temperature because they turned out "squishy" in the final product. However, we all agreed that it was like chunky applesauce . . . with a great flavor! I served the roast on a round platter with the stuffing all around, decorated with parsley and little "footies" for the rib ends--made a beautiful presentation. Served with spinach, avocado & pomegranate salad with cranberry vinegrette, roasted asparagus and creme brulee. Will definitely do again.

I COMPLETELY disagree with the last reviewer. This stuffing is OUT OF THIS WORLD!

Every one was so impressed with the presentation, the taste, and the amount of work that it "seemed" like I put into this dish. I actually embarassed myself as I kept mmmmming at my own cooking! The stuffing just melts in your mouth. My mother-in-law has been known to make "comments" about non-traditional food and she really loved this stuffing. I made double the recipe and only had one cup of leftovers! I really wanted to brine the pork overnight but the butcher forgot to make the roast and I didn't get to pick it up until the morning. As a result, the pork was slightly dry but still extremely tasty. But no matter, the INCREDIBLE gravy certainly took care of that. I've never tasted gravy so delicious. The entire meal was a smash hit and I couldn't be happier with the results. Several guests stated that they thought they were eating in a gourmet restaurant. This will be my special dinner from now on.

It was bound to happen, an epicurean dinner that was not a hit. I used only the stuffing recipe, to serve along side a roast turkey and was quite disappointed; I felt the ingredients were lacking in 'something' and the spices certainly needed a few alterations. There are amazing stuffing recipes out there, I feel this is not one of them. If you have a favorite, send it my way...please! PS: If you have not tried the port wine, fig and cranberry sauce recipe on this site, try it tonight! It is AMAZING! Served with roast chicken and crème on a baguette the following day...yummy!Live life, drink it up and love those around you!

I just had 18 family members descend for a pre-wedding family gathering. I took the reviewers seriously and made stuffing for 36 people. There's only enough left over for our Sunday dinner (for 2). This is the simplest stuffing -- and S-O-O-O-O tasty. I've given the recipe to my new niece-in-law who has been assigned to bring stuffing to her family's Thanksgiving. You don't need the roast or the turkey to make this scumptious dish. The pork is delicious and impressive -- but the stuffing wins the big prize. Don't hesitate. (Add whole pecans just before cooking.)

For the cook from Peoria. A brine is a process of soaking meat in a liquid that has been heavily salted. It is good used with pork, chicken and turkey to greatly increase texture and flavor. There are a couple recipes that use brines in epicurious. Hope this helps.

Rating: 0
To Peoria: You're going to get at least 5 responses to your question, but I'll put in my $.02. Brining usually means soaking large cuts of meats in a solution consisting of salted water that often includes, sugar, spices and herbs as well. It serves to tenderize and flavor the meat (usually large cuts i.e.: roasts, whole turkeys, hams, etc.) The method has risks, however, unless you have researched it. You must pay special attention to temperature, and sometimes means a lot of work. I highly recommend it, however. It's amazing how much better well-brined meats are. I will never cook a T'giving bird again without brining. There is plenty of info on this site about brining, as well as other sites on the internet. Bon Appetit.

Easy & tasty.I brined the meat for about 6 hrs., rinsed and dried the roast well and then refrigerated it for a few hrs until time to cook it. I omitted the salt from the final precook seasonings. The result was tender, moist and delicious!

What a fantastic -- and easy -- recipe! I made it for 6 guests for a Christmas Eve dinner, and it was a smash hit! Almost no prep time (more time to enjoy your guests) and I used the leftover chops to make pork sandwiches with dijon mustard and cilantro the next day. A crown roast recipe can seem overwhelming, but this one was so user-friendly, and yet still an elegant meal!

This was the absolute hit of my recent celebration. I did, however, make at least 1 1/2 times the dressing, but next time will at least double the recipe. Everyone had seconds, even my daughter and she rarely eats any meat. The meat was tender enough to cut with a fork, the smells in my home were beyond compare. Thank you for this wonderful website. I shall visit it often.

This will be one of my special meals. It was wonderful. I took the advice of others here and used a low-strength brine for around 5 hours. Also, I added about one cup of dried tart cherries to the stuffing. The meat was tasty and tender, not salty and the stuffing was delicious. I served it with a spinach salad, and Pinot Noir.

I used a different recipe for the roast and sauce (and am sorry that I did). The stuffing was outstanding!!! I just wish that I had made more. I had 8 adults and there was enough for everyone to just have one helping. It was very disappointing not to have leftovers the next day. Next time I will double the recipe and cook the extra in a dish with the roast.

I wanted to make an unusual turkey for my French friends who had never experienced Thanksgiving before. I found this recipe and decided just to use the stuffing alone, so prepared it for Thanksgiving. I put the stuffing in the turkey cavity and roasted it in the oven (I also added stuffing around the turkey in the pan about a half hour before removing the turkey from the oven.) Well... it was just heavenly. My French friends couldn't believe it and asked for more. In fact, I think they far preferred it to the turkey!

I am using this for a cooking class. I would make it again...however I would brine the pork to keep it from drying out. Pulled it from the oven at 155, but it still was a little flavorless. Have had great results with pork brine, will try next time. The glazed apples did not brown but burnt. Would recommend roasting rather then broiling.
