original ingredients make a good marinade, personally, I wanted more flavor w/o adding more salt, soy sauce was added to do the trick.

Excellent for quick guests; also can be modified with green and red bell peppers finely chopped onions also . The sauce of this marinate is Beautiful. I serve it many times a week!
