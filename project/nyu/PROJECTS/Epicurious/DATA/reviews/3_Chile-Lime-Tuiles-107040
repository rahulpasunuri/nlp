I made these for a cookie exchange and won the prize for most unusual cookie! The taste is quite delicious, and they are beautiful. However, they are lots of work, and are very delicate cookies that break easily. I found the recipes suggestion to drape them over handles a little cumbersome. In the end, I rolled them around a handle and that worked well. They also broke less. I also took some practice to time it exactly right as to when to scoop them off the parchment. Too soon, they mush up. Too late, they don't shape easily and you need to put them back in the oven to soften them.
