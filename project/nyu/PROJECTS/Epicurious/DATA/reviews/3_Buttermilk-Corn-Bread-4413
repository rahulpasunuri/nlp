We used this cornbread recipe for the thanksgiving stuffing 15 years ago when it was first published and have been making it ever since. We make it exactly as it is written though periodically cook as muffins. That way we can eat as many as we want for dinner and freeze the rest for a future dinner side. They freeze very well. Muffins take about 14 minutes and it makes 16-18 muffins or so...

I feel that I have to rate this as we have made it every Thanksgiving for at least 10 years. My daughter feels that it is the world's best stuffing. It is just spicy enough and we follow the recipe with minimal changes. It has been the only constant in all of our Thanksgivings.

This recipe is easy and works perfectly as the crust for Roasted Pork Tenderloin with Sage Corn Bread Crust, found on Epicurious.

This is a reliable and still surprisingly aromatic and essential corn bread staple. The foodies, the grandmothers, and all in-between rave each time. It stands alone, and we never modify it. It's too good.

This is my favorite corn bread ever-I did do a few things differently though to make it my favorite. I took 1/2 c corn kernels chopped them in the food processor then added the sugar, buttermilk and eggs. I added 1 1/2 buttermilk because the recipe is to dry otherwise. Next I omitted the oil. After mixing wet and dry ingrediants together I added a stick of melted butter into the batter. Lastly I Heated a cast iron (one time a nonstick skillet) with a little olive oil and poured the batter into the prepared pan. Then baked according to directions. I cannot tell you how many people have loved this corn bread-it is outstanding. I even forgot to add the eggs one time (when I was making 3 batches) Although crumbly it was still moist and absolutely delicious.

I have been making this for years to go with barbequed ribs. It has never been dry and has always been enjoyed by our guests. I usually bake it in a pie plate. No modifications yet - like it just as it is, plain as a great accompaniment to spicy ribs.

Leave out the sugar completely and add a whole can of creamed corn....delicious!

Good alone or for stuffing. Will use less sugar next time if for stuffing. Moist,tender,flavorful cornbread. To double, use a 13"x9" pan, and bake for the same length of time.

Easy but somewhat bland.

This recipe has become a tradition at our Thanksgiving table. Although cornbread is sweet, andouille sausage and spices offer a refreshing change from traditional sage-laden bread stuffing. For those who are wheat/grain/flour intolerant, this is a chance to enjoy!

This is a great basic corn bread recipe. I did add twice amount of the sugar because our family likes our cornbread sweet. I didn't find it too be dry at all. And when making the stuffing, I always use my own judgement in adding liquid, this way it's always moist to my taste.

This cornbread was soooo dry that if I hadn't ben using it for stuffing I would have had to throw it away.

I chose this recipe so that it would serve as a basic corn bread. It is delicious. As I said, I wanted this to be a simple, fundamental recipe. Tonight, I wanted a chunky, spicy corn bread. I used a can of Ro-Tel tomatoes, 3/4 cup of fat-free half-and-half, cutting out the milk. (I just made it so that the liquid from the Ro-Tel and the half-and-half added up to 1 cup, then added the drained tomatoes and chiles) Next, I added a can of Niblets corn, drained. I also cut the oil in half. I like to watch the fat, as you well know if you read my other reviews. However, if I hadn't made any modifications, it would still have been great. I think you can do just about anything with this bread. If you want a tasty picante corn bread to accompany chili on a cold night, try my suggestions.

I would give this 2.5 forks, because I think that it's a good recipe for corn bread and it works very well with the Southwestern Corn Bread Stuffing, but I feel that there is way too much sugar in the Corn Bread. I only added a tablespoon or two and it was much better.

This was not the most memorable corn bread I've ever had, but it was a nice foil for the Vegetable and Bean Chili on this site. The only changes I made were reducing the sugar to 1/4 cup, and replacing the buttermilk with soymilk and a tablespoon of white vinegar. I didn't think it was too dry or too dessert-like, as some reviewers commented. I will likely make this again.

I would actually give it 3.5 forks; this recipe will be the one I use for corn bread. I baked it in an 8"x8"x2" pan because thats what I have, and it came out moist with a nice texture. I did not find it overly sweet.

This is the recipe I'll start using from now on. I add a little bit more sugar because we prefer it that way. I'd like to add corn kernels and green chili's but my daughter prefers it plain.

I was concerned about the amount of sugar, so I only added about a tablespoon. I thought the recipe was going to be way too dry and had to resist adding more buttermilk. It was perfect for the cornbread stuffing I used it for. I would always use this recipe for stuffing. Although, I think it's a bit heavy for corn bread side dish.

This may be fine for stuffing, but is not good on its own. As someone at the thanksgiving table aptly put it "It was like eating a desert." Dry, Dry, Dry! and it was cooked exactly to specifications.

Best cornbread I ever made. Might try to add some jalapeno peppers next time for a little kick.

Made this to accompany sweet potato soup for Thanksgiving lunch and got great reviews. The bread was dense and moist. Gave the leftovers to family members to take home and they said it was better the next day.

Good and easy to make but a little sweet for my taste. Same recipe handed down to me from my Grandmother except she only used 1 tbsp. sugar and lard instead of oil.
