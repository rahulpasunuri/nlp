I made this recipe last night and let me say how wonderfully simple and delicious the gratin turned out to be. I did make one small addition I added some chopped fresh rosemary to the cream as I tossed it with the squash. So delicious. Something this easy is sure to be a regular player in my kitchen come squash time.

Tasted great, but a little too creamy for my taste.

My comments echo (some)things below: Do yourself a favor and get peeled squash. Add some kind of herb or spice, I used Bell's seasoning (a little) and thyme. Oh, and this is definitely what I would term a "chef's recipe", that is, a lot of things are left out that an experienced could would do. In other words, I defy you to cook the recipe as written and make it turn into anything good. So, here are some hints: do the initial squash cooking longer and heat the cream before adding it to the squash. It still takes more like an hour than a 30 minutes.

I made this recipe as part of a meal for a date and i all i can say is that it was even better than i thought it would be! I didn't have enough butternut squash so i mixed butternut in with acorn and found that the butternut was def. better for this recipe. outside of that it was great. will make it again!!

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was really delicious! I used Parmagiano Reggiano and it added great flavor. I did make some tweaks to the recipe that I would recommend - I skipped the boiling step and just sliced the squash thin (1/8 inch) and cooked it longer until tender. Also, I cooked fresh sage in butter and added it along with nutmeg within the layers. It was really wonderful and even guests that weren't squash fans really loved the dish.

I loved the simplicity of this dish. However, I did substitute parmesan for gruyere cheese, which has a more nutty flavour. I also layered it in with the squash. I needed only a fraction of the cream this dish called for. Nutmeg would definitely have made a nice addition.

This was so not worth the effort. Took way too long and tasted like plain unflavored butternut squash. Definitely won't make again.

I've made this several times with only one modification; I add a little freshly grated nutmeg. I've tried using lo-fat evaporated milk to cut down on the fat, but it turned out pretty awful. I stick to the recipe as written (with the nutmeg addition) and it gets rave reviews every time. Great for special occasions.

This is wonderful. Do take the advice to use pecorino romano, more than 3T, and add fresh sage. I also found that 3/4 c of cream was plenty.

Made for Thanksgiving and it was very popular. Cut back on the cream, used pre-peeled squash from Trader Joe's, and added sage. Tasty tasty!

I gave this recipe a lower rating as it was 'blah' according to my husband's comment. I must agree,'very bland'. I rated it with two forks, as I believe with some changes the recipe may be improved on. First reduce the amount of cream, to 3/4 cup. There was just to much liquid. I will definitely add more parmesan cheese as well (maybe 1/2 cup). And finally I did add sage, but apparently not enough. So I would add at least 1 tsp dried sage (2 tbsp fresh chopped sage). I will give this recipe another try with the changes to see if it will give this dish some umph.

Very easy to make and everyone loved it! Just need to cut down on the heavy cream, there was too much liquid.

I was very disappointed with this dish. It was simply "blah" even after adding the asiago and sage based on other reviewers' recommendations. Definitely the least popular item on the Thanksgiving table!

Followed olthers suggestions and added sauteed sage in middle of layers also nugmeg and some asiago. Assiago and Parmesan on top. Fabulpus!! Give it a try!!!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and all of my guests absolutely raved about it. Very easy to prepare. I made ahead of time by preparing as directed and stopping before adding the cream. Also, I felt the cream was a little much. I'd use just one cup next time.

To the cook from Wellesley, I made this in the AM and then just heated it up b/f dinner - it turned out great. The flavors are wonderful and it is very satisfying!

This is wonderful. The top is crispy and the squash melts in your mouth. I make this every year, but confess that I'm so lazy I buy prepeeled chunks of butternut squash.

can any part of this be made ahead of time?

This was terrific! I cut the squash into small chunks and sauteed them in a little butter with some sliced onions until the onions were really tender, then spooned it into the gratin dish. I also used fat free half and half, which tasted fine, but separated a bit during the cooking and left a clear liquid in the bottom of the dish. BTW, I use a Y-shaped peeler. First cut the squash into two sections, the neck and the bulb, then peel the neck vertically and the bulb like an apple. I've never had a problem. Squash has become one of my kids' favorite vegetable (ages 4 and 6).

This recipe is very easy to adapt/improvise. I've made it a few times and added either ginger, sage, sliced apples, rosemary, orange zest or nutmeg. Also, please accept this bit of wisdom - butternut squash is simple to peal. Some other reviewers mentioned this also - believe us! Just use a potatoe peeler. No cutting at the stem or knife necessary! Try it!

My first attempt at squash. I, and my family thought the dish was awesome. Will make often for us and special dinners too.

peeling a butternut squash is simple, just use a potato peeler. I would not have believed it my self til I saw it done and then tried it. Trying to go thru that skin w/ a knife scared me. a potato peeler works like a charm and without loing a finger.

Made this for Thanksgiving. It was a)extremely easy b)took very little time c) looked beautiful For a tasty variation I added sage warmed in butter throughout and as a garnish.

I am currently making this and I wanted to comment that it CAN be peeled (as several people have asserted), but letting it bake is so much easier, and then you don't lose all the vitamins in the boiling water. Better for you, and easier too! Enjoy!

Made this to replace that sickly marshmellow/sweet potato casserole last Thanksgiving (and several times since then). And everyone was so pleased! I really don't see what the problem with peeling the squash is. I cut it at the neck, use a sharp, sturdy kitchen knife, and am done in a few minutes. Alternately, you could cut in in slices, then lay slices flat and cut the peel off each one...anyway, I've quit measuring the ingredients and just wing it--always turns out great. You can cook the squash less for a firmer texture, and a long time for a creamy casserole flavor. Be sure to let the cheese get a little crispy on top--that's my favorite part!

This was awesome!!! A great substitute for sweet potatoes at a holiday meal with more subtle flavor and smoother texture. AND...so incredibly quick and easy to prepare. I would definitely recommend using the technique suggested by another reviewer to bake the squash whole in a 350 oven for about 20-30 minutes. Remove and cool. Then squash is very easy to peel and prepare for dish. I did not boil the squash after this step and the result was awesome. This dish is a keeper.

Yummy! a nice alternative to potato gratin. Its sweet and a little creamy at the same time. I would recommend slightly cooking the squash in the microwave on high for around 7 minutes (this cuts your cooking time!), and reducing the cream. It makes a great side dish to any winter holiday meal.

Great dish! Everyone loved it at our dinner party. I made squash 2 different ways: 1) Gratin using this recipe and 2) BUTTERNUT SQUASH AND CARROT PUREE WITH MAPLE SYRUP (other recipe on this site) Everyone preferred squash gratin style over the Puree style! Enjoy!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit.It was different yet still had the traditional look that is so important for my family. I sliced the squash in half and baked in oven, then scooped out squash to avoid peeling. This worked just fine. I also used less cream. A definite addition to our Thanksgiving menu.

You don't have to cut up hard squash raw and risk cutting yourself. Put the squash in the oven at 350 F. for 25 or so minutes on some foil until it gets oily in appearance and can easily be pierced with a knife. Remove from oven with mitts and cool. Now you can easily cut up the squash and seed it without any danger to knive wounds. I do this will all squash and it works. The seeds left in for 20 minutes give more flavor to the meat. ...proceed with the recipe into the dish for baking. Yummy!

Wait! No need to peel the squash before it's cooked. Cut in half, bake flesh side down in about an inch of water, covered, until it's just tender. THEN peel and slice and continue with this recipe. Guaranteed you'll have a nasty kitchen accident if you try to peel before it's cooked.

It's excellent this way, BUT if you really want to add to it...use pecorino romano (and alot more than 3T) and use some chopped fresh sage - just sprinkle in and around the layered squash. YUM!! This is yummy as is, but I like my version better.

I really liked this although it could have used a bit less cream. Would definitely make again. Added a but of nutmeg as well because I like the combination of gorund nutmeg and squash.

This was terrific (but it was very rich). It was very easy and quick to make. I would cut back to 1 cup of heavy cream next time, though.
