Absolutely delicious! Yes the dough is sticky but a little extra flour helps. My dinner guests are still talking about this recipe. Easy and impressive. Definitely a keeper.

We loved it. Yes, the dough was sticky, but it finished perfectly. Will definitely make this again.

This was delicious, beautiful (jewel colors), easy. I used a mix of blueberries, blackberries, raspberries. The dough was, as some have noted, sticky, but I floured my hands before handling, and worked it on floured freezer paper.

Good, but needs some tweaking. The dough was very, very sticky, so I added more flour than the recipe called for. Also, the bottom of the biscuits never quite baked--in the future I'd roll them thinner/make less biscuit dough. My cobbler was also quite runny and could have used more cornstarch/tapioca, but that might have been because of the fruit I used (cherries, red raspberries and blackberries).

A FANTASTIC cobbler recipe. Absolutely loved the biscuit dough on top, and the in-season berries were understandably divine (used Strawberries, Blueberries and Blackberries). Simiple and wow-worthy - will make again and again.

This is amazing. I doubled the recipe and used 11x17 glass dish. My only issue was the "dough" which was more like sticky biscuit dough. I had helpers and they added all if the milk at once. That may have caused the sticky problem. No idea how one could roll out the dough... I just dropped it on the top in 8 piles and sprinkled turbino sugar on top. Adults and kids loved this cobbler.

Great cobbler-made it with blackberries, peaches and some nectarines. Everyone loved it. Will definitely make it again.

I had bought a 5# bag of frozen berries at Costco awhile back before fresh berries were in the market, so when I saw this recipe I had to make it. My company really liked it and the lack of fresh berries was not noticable. It will be my "go to recipe for dessert" for any summer gathering. The only thing I would change is adding more cornstarch if you are using frozen berries.

Really good! I didn't use strawberries-- just blackberries, raspberries, and blueberries. It was really hot in my kitchen and the dough stayed super sticky even with extra flour, so I ended up with one big dough circle instead of the pretty separate pieces.. but who cares when it's covered in ice cream? It was delicious!

I added one more cup of mixed berries (blackberries, red and yellow raspberries, blueberries and strawberries) and baked in 8 individual ramekins. Did not increase the sugar or cornstarch and it was perfect. Loved the biscuit topping--very tender. Very easy to put together. Served with homemade vanilla ice cream. Absolute hit at a dinner party. This one will go in the "permanent" file!

Made this for the 4th of July and it was a certifiable hit!! I used the same mix as the reviewer above. Served warm with vanilla ice cream. I also increased the berry mixture by 50% as my dish was larger and I knew that my company wouldn't have a problem eating more...
