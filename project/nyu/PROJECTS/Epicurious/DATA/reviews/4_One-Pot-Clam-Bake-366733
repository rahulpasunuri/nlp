This was incredibly easy and a big hit! A little too much quantity for the 30-quart pot, and so I ended up grilling the corn. Used seaweed at the bottom to give it the smell of the sea and protect the lobster. Substituted onion for celery. Used 3lbs of potatoes rather than 2.5, and used 2lbs of sausage rather than 1.5, and I think those quantities were correct. Next time I will drop the eggs, which added nothing, and add shrimp. Served on a tablecloth of newspapers, which made clean-up a breeze. Defintely, this will become my "signature" dinner!

I made this for a Cape Cod family gathering summer 2012. It was a smash hit and a really easy way to feed a big table with all local seafood (except the shrimp). We didn't use lobster just to cut down on the mess. If we were eating out doors, I would absolutely use a coupla' lobstahs! Note: I would add the chorizo later as it was overdone to my taste. My small modifications below - served 9 with leftovers for chowder that I'll make today using the strained broth. Increased to 1.5 L bottle of white wine, added a small handful of bay leaves, 5 - 6 dried chili peppers, sprinkling or Old Bay Seasoning. For potatoes I used a combination of red, white and blue fingerling potatoes. For seafood I used 4 pounds mussels, 4 pounds cherry stones (about 18), 2 doz littlenecks, 4 pounds shrimp and 1.5 pounds chorizo, (omitted lobsters, eggs and celery) I added the chorizo per recipe with the corn. The corn was perfectly cooked but the chorizo was over cooked and dry. I would instead add the chorizo with the clams or maybe even half way through the 10 min. clam period.

Great clam bake...I've made it twice and had rave reviews...Used 2 bottles of dark beer and old bay seasoning instead of the wine...great flavor. Added 2 lbs of shrimp 5 minutes after adding clams and they came out perfect. Hard to mess this up.....

Made this recipe last night for a birthday celebration. Everything came out excellent. A couple of things to note: 1) When they say 'serves 8' they mean very hungry people. If you plan to serve appetizers, snacks, or any food for the remainder of the week, invite more people. 2) We swapped the amount of mussels and clams, and still thought it wonderful. 3) We borrowed a 40 qt (10 gallons!) stockpot from a friend, and everything came to within an inch from the rim. This size pot took up 2 burners on the stove and stands about 2 feet, so make sure you have room. To make the steaming rack, I inverted some ramekins on the bottom of the pot and balanced some metal cooling racks on them. Steaming everything tastes much better than boiling them. We would definitely do this again. Now, what to do with 2 lbs of left-over mussels and clams...

I seriously questioned throwing eggs in a boiling pot but not only did they survive, they were delicious. The seasoning, once sprinkled on the food was so tasty that I used the rest in salads- I'm so glad I had doubled the recipe. Obviously if the eggs and seasonings were good, you can only Imagine how delectible everything else was. The only problem was finding a pot the size of a small swimming pool!
