I didn't use the bacon but loaded on the salt (less fat, but still tasty). I also used green onions. Really good, but I'm sure the bacon would have made it better!

this dish is really tasty. I used turkey bacon for a healthy alternative.

Always looking for something different to do with Chard and am sick and tired of Beet Borsht. This recipe was so easy to make and very flavorful. Served it with wildrice and ribeye steaks. The 3 of us finished it all. Will make it again for sure. Super Healthy and quick
