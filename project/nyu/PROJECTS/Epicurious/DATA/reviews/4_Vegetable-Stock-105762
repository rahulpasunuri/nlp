Love this stock. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe as is. This is also a great approach for broth bags. If you don't use these, they are an amazing cost saver. When you cut celery tops, onion tops, zucchini and summer squash, mushroom stems, anything you don't normally use in a recipe, and toss it in a ziploc bag in the freezer. Once you have a couple of quart bags of bits and bobs that would be thrown out anyway, simply roast the contents of the bags, then follow this recipe from the deglazing step on. You can look at the contents of the bags and decide if you want to emphasize a flavor by adding fresh vegetables, I usually add an extra carrot and some garlic, otherwise most of my stocks are made from "garbage". And, if I do say so myself, my soups get rave reviews.

Its a very easy and very forgiving stock. I used leeks / shallots / garlic to cut on costs, forgot about the mushroom, and used turnips and sweet potatoes, carrots and celery to cut the bitterness of the turnips, I added a pich of brown sugar. For herbs, I have thyme and sage and rosemary as well as sea salt and pepper. For a bit more depth, I added about a quarter cup of red wine when adding the tomoatos. The first time I made this, I couldn't throw out the vegetables, so I pureed them with some of the stock and made a fabulous roasted vegetable puree. Using the stock in a cooking demo on Saturday on a hearty Vegetarian Minestrone

This made an absolutely wonderful stock. Rich in color and flavor and very easy to make. I could not find portabellas, but I was able to find criminis (baby bellas). Worked out just fine. We have a lot of vegetarian friends, so this is great to have on hand in the freezer.

I made this stock for the Winter Vegetable and Pesto Soup this afternoon. Wow! Both recipes are winners individually, but together, they create a very tasty, hearty soup. The time spent chopping & roasting the veggies is well worth it. This recipe would be a great base for vegetarian gravy as well.

I've been a vegetarian for 16 years and this is easily the best gravy I've tried. I did find the tomato flavour too pronounced in the stock alone, but not in the finished gravy, where it disappears into the overall richness. I make a double recipe and use 1/2 organic vegetable broth (Pacific brand) in place of the water for even more flavour.

The soup is a little more labour intensive than making a normal vegetable broth - but what a world of difference those extra steps made! This is the best vegetable broth I've ever had. It has a deep and savoury flavour - whereas the vegetable broths I'm used to have been quite bland. This soup could be eaten on its own, simply as a broth. However, I used it as a base for a french onion soup - and it blew everyone away. I used a bit more water - and would actually double or triple the recipe and freeze what I don't need right away - just because there's a little more effort involved in making this soup - so once I'md doing it, I might as well make a big batch of it! But this recipe is a definite winner!!

I was influenced by the glowing reviews of the stock. I did not peel the shallots, nor scrape the dark undersides of the portobello mushrooms. If I were to make it again I would do both. I thought both contributed to the very dark color of the stock. I also thought it had a very strong onion flavor. I want to use it as a base for a vegetarian butternut squash soup, but am concerned that the stock will discolor it.

fabulous stock. Rich and flavorful. to keep costs down (i'm a starving grad student) I used a quarter pound of shallots and the rest yellow onions, and rosemary and sage (which I grow) instead of parsley (which I don't). Also put in a few pinches of kosher salt and boiled the stock with a few peppercorns, because salt and pepper never hurt anything. Even my carnavore parents thought this was great and flavorful

I have never enjoyed the flavor and smell of a stock as much as I did when I first made this. I have never made a stock with roasted vegetables. I've always just thrown stuff into the pot and simmered it. When I made this stock the first time in 2001, I almost changed my mind about what I was serving for the Thanksgiving feast, but my family probably wouldn't have been real impressed with just soup. :-) Personally, I enjoy the tomato flavor and wouldn't leave that out of the mix, but we all have our individual tastes. I've used this recipe as a basis for gravies/soups a few times now, and I will never think about making stock the way I used to again.

First, I'm a vegetarian, so I'm always looking for tasty recipes. This recipe is used in the Portabella Vegetarian Gravy recipe found on this site, which I will be serving at Thanksgiving this year. I found the stock a bit too sweet and would either eliminate the canned tomatoes next time and/or add onions to the roasting mixture. I'd be eager to hear other suggestions to correct this.
