First, if I could give only one piece of advice about cooking this dish, it would be DON'T DO IT ALL IN ONE DAY. I am not a professional chef, and maybe a professional chef is used to cooking for hours and hours at a time, but I allowed myself 4 hours to cook this for my dad's birthday dinner, and a) I was absolutely exhausted and frazzled by the end, and b) I was scrambling madly to finish in time. Other than that, I used parsnips instead of salsify, as the other reviewer suggested, and they were very good with the dish. My chardonny reduction was too thin at the end, so I would allow more time to make sure that reduction is perfect. The recipe didn't say to cook the broccoli sprouts, so I didn't, and consequently, my dad left them on the plate (I would steam them a little bit next time--I prefer them that way too) and I didn't have any truffle juice so I just used truffle oil, a couple tbsps. One could use even more than that. Also, I used some kind of giant exotic shrimp instead of langoustines. My dad loved them.

(continuation of previous review) I'm not sure what the 'advanced techniques' are that they refer to. The recipe only looks complicated, but is in fact not all that hard as, for example, Boef Wellington. There are some heat level indications missing, though. Cleaning the shellfish is not fun. Do be sure to thoroughly clean out the heads! I would add a bit more mint and basil than in the recipe - I couldn't taste any difference with the amounts as they are. I guess Mr. Gras has stronger flavored and fresher ingredients than I do. Peel the salsify under running water. It exudes a sticky sap if you don't. Fry it on high heat until it starts to look a little glossy and translucent, then add the stock. Do try to get salsify if you can. It is absolutely delicious! Do the final roasting right before you cook the shrimp. The sauce has a very complex taste. It's hard to guess the ingredients if you don't know what's in there. Presentation is fantastic, looks great on white plates - use large restaurant sized ones if you can.

This recipe is a real showstopper! I made it twice, for New Year's and a week later at request, both times with some substitutions (no surprise): first 2-3 oz frozen tiger shrimp, then a smaller size. Both excellent, smaller are much cheaper, so that's what I'll use in the future. Second time I used a good quality bought lobster stock -- was just as good. Had the easier-to-get Riesling instead of Chardonnay. Used plain old black peppercorns, though a few more. Used the black variety of salsify called scorzenera (schwarzwürzel, for those who want to know) which are really easy to get here. Since that's really hard to get stateside, I think parsnips might make a good subtitution. Scorzenera are more delicate tasting though. The pan got washed after making duck breast before I could intervene, so I used butter in place of the duck fat both times - duck fat wasn't missed. Used a small squeeze of truffle paste intead of the juice, holy basil instead of regular, alfalfa sprouts for broccoli sprouts the first time, and since the alfalfa sprouts are as hard to get here as salsify is in the U.S., finely chopped rocket the second time.

At last, something to make with my leftover duck fat, salsify, and Indonesian peppercorns!
