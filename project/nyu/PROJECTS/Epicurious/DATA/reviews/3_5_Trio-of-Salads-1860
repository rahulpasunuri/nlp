Wonderful! These three little salads made a big impression on my guests. I can't believe how easy it was to make something so pretty.

After visiting Paris, I longed to find the recipe for crudites (with beets, celery root, and carrot), as we had been served in our travels. Although the vinagrette was not quite the same, it enhanced the flavors of each of the vegetables while reminding us of our lovely French vacation.
