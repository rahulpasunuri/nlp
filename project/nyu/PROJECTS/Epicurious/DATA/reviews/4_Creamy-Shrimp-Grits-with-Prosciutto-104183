Hastings varied this somewhat in his recipe published from his appearance at the Atlanta Food and Wine Festival in 2012. In that version, he adds a 1/2 cup mirepoix (equal parts finely diced carrot, celery, onion). He also adds 3 Tblsp lemon juice and uses twice the amount of butter. Country Ham is used instead of prosciutto . I made it per the Atlanta recipe. It was wonderfully rich and 5-star. However, next time I will cut the butter (it doesn't have to be that rich) and cut back by half on the lemon juice as the lemon was too prominent. This recipe is the best Shrimp and Grits I've had in years.

I was looking for a shrimp and grits recipe that had tomatoes in it. So glad I found this one.

Great recipe. Be sure to salt and pepper the grits when they are almost done. Also I added some cayenne to the tomato and prosciutto sauce for a little heat? Yum

I made this recipe for southern friends of mine and they loved it. I do saute shallots and omit the chives now. After I dish out the grits I sprinkle sharp cheddar on them before ladling the shrimp on top. I always serve this with a few different hot sauces on the side.

Amazing!!! super easy and full of flavor. I didn't use all the butter it called for, but it still tasted very rich and yummy.

This dish was fabulous. I used thick cut bacon instead of prosciutto the second time and liked the flavor. I also only used half a can of the tomatoes instead of the entire can.

This recipe has achieved legendary status with my friends. It is truly extraordinary. The sweetness of the shrimp perfectly balances out the saltiness of the prosciutto. You could cut back on the butter though.

Not at all fabulous! I liked the flavor of the grits, but the shrimp was just... shrimp and tomatoes.

Always on a quest for the best shrimp and grits, I made this recipe substituting the grits with the "Baked Cheese Grits" recipe from this site. It was fantastic!

I made this as a first course for my husband's birthday dinner and had to cut down the recipe so that it would make two servings. It was fabulous! I would love it as a main course. I used regular cornmeal and served it with a glass of Kung Fu Girl Riesling. The portions were generous. For a first course, the whole recipe would easily serve 8. This is a keeper!

This is a great recipe to start with. I severely bastardized it but it still turned out DELICIOUS! Grits: Used half & half, and 1/2 the butter called for. Threw in some fresh corn at the end (a must--so delicious!). It turned out a little bit thick so I would probably add more water or chicken stock next time. Maybe try low-fat milk instead of half & half. Shrimp: Didn't use very much butter, used lots of garlic & shallots, threw in leftover sausage & pancetta instead of proscuitto, used fiery tomatoes, and threw in some leftover red wine. I wish there was more sauce...maybe some tomato sauce or something next time. All in all, it was sooooo tasty and I will definitely make this again soon.

I tried this recipe the other night for my husband and some house guests. They all loved it and I would definitely make it again. Of course, my husband had to add some Frank's hot sauce for some extra flavor but I loved it as is.

Great grits - need to season with salt and pepper. I also suggest seasoning the shrimp prior to their sautee. I also like to use pancetta instead of prosciutto.

Absolutely fantastic! I had a few strips of cooked bacon, so used that instead of Prosciutto. ...But this recipe will make you a rock star!! Unbeatable! Will make this again and again!!

delicious indeed! however the amount of fat in this dish is completely unnecessary. for a more heart (and thigh) healthy version i sauteed shallot, garlic & shrimp in a tbs or so of olive oil w/ a dash of butter for flavor. i used light cream at 1/3rd cup. still extremely robust and creamy. may try fat free half and half or 1% milk on other occasions. great with diced fresh tomato as well.

Delicious!!! And pretty simple to make with many staple ingredients. Unfortunately, I drained the tomatoes and didn't keep the juice, which really is necessary. So I just added a little bit more white wine. Never hurts! My husband and guests had no problem cleaning their plates. This recipe is going in my recipe box!

This is a great version of shrimp and grits. I sauteed matchstick pieces of pancetta before adding the shallots instead of using proscuitto later. Also, I would used half as many canned tomatoes - their flavor overwhelmed the shrimp. We cut our large shrimp in half lengthwise for this dish and cook them a little less. Also, the chicken broth will give the grits a tinny artificial flavor! I make grits (Logan Turnpike Grits from GA - order online and keep them in the fridge) with water and then add a can of evaporated milk at the end and let them sit for a while. Overall my husband's grandmother would approve!

Rating: 4
Excellent flavor...well received even by a polenta-skeptical husband! As suggested by other reviewers, I cut back on the butter and used half and half in place of cream. I didn't have shallots so I used scallions and saved the green tops to use in place of chives. Great meal!

Best shrimp n grits I've had. I like to use hot rotel for part of the tomatoes to give it a kick.

Amazing. I was just making this for my husband and I and didn't want to mess it up by converting the recipe to 2 servings. That said, I only cut the shrimp in 1/2 (1 lb) and kept everything else the same. I also used regular grits (not quick cook). This was superb. I might use fresh tomatoes and pancetta next time. Although the proscuitto was great, the canned tomatoes tasted, well, canned.

Exceptional. It is the best shrimp & grits recipe I have ever eaten! I can't wait to have it again!

Made half the recipe since we were only 2. Followed other reviewers suggestions and used only 1 tbsp butter (which was plenty) and 5% cream instead of whipping cream. Used vidalia onions instead of shallots and added red pepper flakes. Waited until the grits were ready before making the shrimp and kept them on very low heat so nice and creamy by the time shrimp was done.

Rating: 4
Added chipolte pepper sauce and cut butter by a tablespoon in grits. Very good. Next time would cut butter to about 2 tbsp in the grits. Let the grits stand for 10min before serving. We didn't and it was way to soupy and hot. Next time I would let them cool down.

Excellent recipe to introduce yankees to the joys of grits (though that much butter sort of stacks the deck). I used half the proscuitto, half and half rather than cream, red onion instead of shallots and added some red pepper flakes.

I fell in love with shrimp and grits when we visited South Carolina a few years ago. I haven't been able to reproduce the wonderful flavors. However, we really loved this recipe. After reading all of the comments, we added chipotle peppers in adobo to add some heat to the shrimp and grits. Fantastic! We could not find unprepared polenta, so used corn meal instead. The grits were smooth and tasty.

substituted soy milk for cream, and since it was a sweetened soy milk, i used stewed tomatoes instead of diced. it was teriffic with the addition of some cajun spices!

Excellent and easy dish! This is a great, easy dish with wonderful flavor, and a welcome change from the same old everyday thing. I didn't have grits, so I used regular cornmeal and it worked out just fine. I also used Italian style diced tomatoes (it's what I had), and that may have added a little extra flavor, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It came out wonderfully and I got raves from my boyfriend. He scraped his bowl clean and wanted more. Will definitely use again. Thanks!

This recipe is so full of flavor. I am not a great lover of shrimp so I substituted scallops. It is very important to find the stone ground grits. You need the real deal, Quaker just won't do.

Grits and polenta are NOT the same thing! Both are corn, but grits are much more coarse. Try the grits from Anson Mill in South Carolina -- well worth the 1 1/2 hour cooking time. Their polenta is excellent as well. I buy it right from the mill and it is shipped directly to my home. Look up the mill on the web. Once you try it you'll never want the supermarket variety again!

I followed the instructions to the T and was very surprised at the outcome. The end result just wasn't cohesive- didn't make sense at all. First, the grits need to be salted. Also, there is too much tomato with the shrimp, and the prosciutto & tomato juice definitely don't seem to go with the dish at all. IF I made this again (which doesn't seem likely), I think I would eliminate the tomatoes altogether, just stir the shrimp into the grits, and get some spices going (like cayenne?)

I made this for Thanksgiving brunch-it was amazing! Everyone loved it and is asking for it again. I did not have corn grits, so I used instant regular grits. It worked great. I added a little grated parmesan cheese to the grits also. This dish is so easy and takes little time to prepare. It saves and reheats well too.

OK, so I changed a few things - olive oil instead of butter, low fat kielbasa instead of proscuitto, quick grits cooked in chicken broth - but it was excellent! The tomatoes were a good addition to the regular shrimp and grits. It was very quick and easy too.

Sell my clothes, I'm going to Heaven. Used Half & Half instead of cream, and a little less butter (but not much!) and it was absolutely wonderful. Big portions -- cut the recipe in half for two and could have easily served three.

The search is over!! We have tried numerous shrimp and grits recipes, in order to find one like we had had several years ago. This one is even better. The combination of flavors is fantastic. I could not find dry polenta in our little town, so I used the yellow corn meal. I cant imagine the polenta being any better. I also used a lot more garlic than it called for. We served it for guests last night and it was a big success.

My husband gave it 3, I gave it 2. Let's call it 2.5. I thought the grits were too rich, but as you see from the reviews, others seemed to like them as they are. I would replace some of the chicken stock with water (yes, water!) and use 1/2 the amount of butter called for. We will make this again, but I will lighten it up next time.

I made this for a baby shower. It was loved by ALL! I substituted regular quick grits for corn grits and had to put in more grits than it called for. (I approx the liquid to grits based on the back of the grits box.) Also, I cooked the shrimp mixture ahead & just made the grits at the time of the party & it was perfect. I will definitely make this again. Can feed an army!

I thought this made a tasty,easy,and delicious Friday night supper. In the interest of lowering the fat, I made the following changes: only 2+1/2 Tbsp. butter and no-fat evaporated milk in the grits and 2 Tbsp. butter to saute the shrimp. I used frozen shrimp(I know fresh would be tastier but didn't have any) and country ham(this is Virginia).Yummy !!

Very good recipe. The grits are something we don't usually eat, but with the addition of the garlic, cream and butter they had a very rich taste and probably a few extra calories. This dish was easy to make and would make a very good dish to serve for dinner guests.

We expanded this receipe to feed a large group at a luncheon buffet on New Year Day. We substituted country ham for prosciutto. We had several guests ask for the receipe and everyone raved about it. Quite unusual for a northern state where grits isn't on many menus. Definitely would do this again.

I do enjoy shrimp & grits so I thought I'd give this extremely high-fat rendition a try. To my disappointment I found the dish a bit bland. Yes, butter, wine, and garlic are a wonderful trilogy in the Culinary Kingdom. However, to my surprise, it was just too rich! I hate to say this, but my favorite shrimp & grits recipe is from a Cooking Light recipe I have from the magazine. I recently swore off low-fat food & have decided to opt for the "real deal" & a bit more exercise. However, my 4 forks go to Cooking Light on this one. This is a good recipe, but a better one exists. Check out the Cooking Light web site & you may find the recipe I'm talking about. My boyfriend agrees that the Cooking Light version is much more flavorful.

This was delicious and so easy! I ended up using stone ground yellow corn meal as a substitute for the grits as you recommended and it was wonderful. Such a nice melding of flavors. We will definitely make this again! Shrimp is in season here in Charleston.
