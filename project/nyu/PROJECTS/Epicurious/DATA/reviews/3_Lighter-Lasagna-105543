This was a really quick and easy recipe that tasted great. The problem I have with it is that it is really difficult to eat! The noodles slide all over the place, and the layering doesn't allow for a good mixing of flavors.

Yummy! I added italian seasoning and fresh basil to the sauce. I also made my own whole wheat lasagna noodles and added ground turkey to make it healthier. My family didn't even notice! :)

The lowfat cheese was a little chewy, but I can't expect much for a lowfat lasagna. I added spinach to the ricotta cheese for some flare. I would make again!

I was hoping to be able to add this to my weeknight recipes, but it was disappointment. Even after jazzing up the sauce it was bland. It would be good for kids, not for adults.

This recipe sounded too easy, so I added a couple of personal touches: red pepper flakes to spice up canned spagetti sauce, and just a touch of pesto to the ricotta layers. Turned out that these additions probably weren't necessary, but my boyfriend liked it!

Quick, easy and the whole family enjoyed, used prepared sauce.

Easy to make. Tasty, but I didn't like the low fat cheese on top- it tastes like plastic- use real cheese instead.

we practically inhaled this dish and have repeated it often. The clean taste, ease, and attractiveness of the "lasagna" make it a keeper. If you have made a lot of sauce this summer and froze it, this becomes an almost instant dinner
