Excellent sandwich w/slight change. Made with homemade bread in a panini press.

Curry mayo makes it fantastic. I used gruyere. I didn't have fennel--so I made two batches with alternatives. Sauteed leeks or raw green apples. Both great--and apples paired really nicely with curry.

I hand-cut the fennel, ending up with perhaps thicker slices than most. I liked the crunch and thought the taste balance was refreshing. Easy, impressive lunch for guests.

WOW - this was unbelievably delicious....i made exactly as stated, except (of course) i used garlic instead of shallots (to avoid trip to the store) and olive oil (i don't even have veggie oil in my house). also, i roasted the fennel. sooooo good. who comes up with this stuff? thank god for them!

After reviewing the comments below, I used granny smith apple instead of fennel AND pumpernickel. Flavorful and unique. Reminds me of what you would find on a menu at a hip, vegetarian restaurant.

Loved it! I do agree that the fennel was not as pronounced as I thought it would. I'll try sauteing and/or thicker slices. Also as another poster recommends, the pumpernickel sounds like a wonderful variant.

If you roast your fennel, try adding thinly sliced apples for crunch. Apples & fennel go very well together.

Delectable!! But don't tell your cardiologist! I roasted the fennel as suggested by a previous reviewer but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

I didn't think that this sandwich was exceptional.

Instead of fresh fennel, I roasted the fennel, thinly sliced with some olive oil and garlic cloves until lightly browned. It took the sandwiches to the next level.

Very good. The curry mayo is great on other kind of sandwiches too. The fennel seemed odd, but works perfectly.

I made these to accompany the Spicy Tomato Soup. I loved the curry mayo. My word of advice is to apply the butter, mayo and cheese in very modest proportions, because when you add them all up, you've got a very rich (fatty) little sandwich. Delish, though!

We have made this recipe over 10 times. It is our favorite grilled cheese - the curry mayo rocks! We love the fennel as is. I've sliced by hand, so maybe thicker slices make the fennel more pronounced. This is also great with pumpernickel or sourdough. If you are using the baguette, keep the slices thin or chewing the sandwich becomes a little challenging.

Unexpected combination and fabulous taste. I agree with the other posters about roasting the fennel first, to help bring out the anise flavour more and soften the fennel (although the crispness wasn't bad). The curry is an excellent accompaniment.

Yummy! Definately will make again. I used my mandolin (sp?) to slice the fennel extra thin. I love love love fennel, but do agree with the other poster that you really couldn't taste it. Maybe next time I will roast the fennel first and then add it to the sandwich.

I had to leave out the fennel because the grocery doesn't carry it in the winter, but this was the best grilled cheese I've ever had! I fed this to two friends on separate occasions and they both agreed (without prompting)! I used a sourdough baguette, which I think complemented the curry mayo nicely. Just the right balance of curry - not too much. Wonderful comfort food!

I loved the curry mayo -- and I'm not usually a mayo fan. And the sandwiches were good. I'm not sure what the point of the fennel was. It didn't add a discernable flavor and didn't do much for me. But I'll try again sometime and I'd be curious what other reviews think. I've never worked with fresh fennel before -- I thought it would be a solid bulb and was surprised to discover celery-like stalks...
