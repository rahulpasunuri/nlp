This was amazing! I will always use this from now on for chocolate frosting. I made it for my 5 year old daughter's birthday and it was a hit for adults and kids. I used some bittersweet and some semisweet chocolate. I added a little confectioner sugar before I let it set because I got concerned the bittersweet chocolate taste wouldn't appeal to my little ones. Pairing it with a mild chocolate cake recipe was the perfect combination. It has a dark chocolate flavor. To get it to set I put it in the fridge, stirred every 20 min for first few hours then let it sit overnight covered. Once I brought it to room temperature the next day it was the perfect consistency for decorating cupcakes.

This frosting was heavenly! So rich and decadent it was almost too chocolately (I know, impossible, right?)I used it for a 12 double layer spicy orange chocolate cake. I didnt get to simmer, it came to more of a slow boil as the mixture was quite thick so I think I could have cooked it a tad longer. I was anxious for the frosting to cool to a spreadable consistency so I placed it in the freezer. After a few minutes, the butter started to separate and rise to the top and I thought Oh no, back to the store. I took it out and placed it in an ice bath and whisked it until the butter was incorporated and the frosting was perfect! I used Ghiradelli 60% chocolate chips, which were great, not too sweet and orange extract instead of almond. It made a ton of frosting, I had a very generous layer on a big cake and still had left over (hello truffles!). The cake got rave reviews and the frosting was definitely a big part! Try it!

This icing is fabulous. I was making a birthday cake for work, and the birthday-boy wanted chocolate cake with chocolate frosting. Based on the rave reviews, I decided to make this recipe. OMG, what a hit this cake was. Everyone loved it. I made the "Hershey's perfectly chocolate cake" to go with the icing, and it was a match made in heaven. And both recipes are so, so easy to make.

This icing turned out great. Let it chill in a larger bowl or shallow container to set up more quickly, and remember to stir. I wonder if people's problems stem from using chocolate chips (which have additives) instead of chopping up chocolate bars. I used Ghirardelli bittersweet 60% and the icing was fab. Perfect chocolate flavor.

I was looking for a homemade chocolate icing recipe to use for my husband's birthday cake last month and ran across this recipe... after reading all of the reviews, I decided to use half semi-sweet and half milk chocolate chips for the frosting and I have to say it turned out AMAZINGLY! I followed the rest of the recipe to the letter. I did end up allowing the frosting to refrigerate and firm up overnight (I still stirred the frosting ever few minutes for the first few hours then left it overnight and stirred again the next morning) and the next day it was the perfect consistency. I frosted a two layer 9-inch yellow butter cake and had just enough frosting. This will always be my go to chocolate frosting recipe from now on!

I will never buy canned frosting again! This was a hit with everyone, young and old. It does take some time to set up, but worth every second. After 40 minutes in the fridge (stirring after every 10), it still wasn't set up. I put it in the freezer for the next 10, stirred, then another 5 minutes in the freezer and it was ready. It definitely makes enough for two, 9" round double layer cakes. I used 16 ounces of Ambrosia semi-sweet chips (costco) and the taste wasn't quite dark, but as my husband said, perfectly dangerous - because it's not so sweet that you have to stop eating it. I will be making this again and again. So delicious!

Prettiest cake I ever made thanks to this icing recipe and the hint from a reviewer who said to put the knife in hot water when spreading. I wish I had read reviews first because i would not have made this for a group with kids (though I'm glad I learned how to make this anyway)AND I would have made half the recipe which is enough for one double layer cake. No problem with seperation. I split it in half and after it did not set up in an hour, put one half in the freezer for about 10 minutes and it was perfect.

Wow. Yummy! I changed the recipe. I substituted agave sweetener instead of the corn syrup. I added 2 cups powdered sugar. I reduced the chocolate to 11 ounces. After I melted the chocolate, I added my powdered sugar and whipped it with a blender until nice and smooth. Then refrigerated it. It makes a ton of frosting! My frosting never separated. And after a week in the fridge, it was still perfect and we used it on graham crackers. Everybody just wanted to eat spoonfuls!

Just a suggestion if this ganache separates and you get a layer of fat on top, you can melt it down and mix (preferably with an immersion blender) until it comes back together. Then let it sit! Over agitating it will make it separate. If it still won't come back together, add some simple syrup or liquor.

Best Frosting Ever! Add a shot of Baileys, Amaretto or Rum for a hint extra flavor. I use it with Hersheys Black Magic Cake and it is Amazing! Easy & Beautiful - Rich and Creamy not overly sweet.

Best chocolate frosting ever! You have to plan ahead though. You have to let it cool unless you want to use it as a glaze or once cooled in the fridge you have to let it come to room temp to get it to a spreadable consistancy. Make it! You won't be sorry. We used 16oz of Hersheys chocolate. It is what my daughter wanted for her birthday.

Delicious. I used all semi sweet chocolate and it was perfect. Like others say, it takes way longer to set up but once it does it spreads very easily on the cake. I can't believe anyone would add powdered sugar to this recipe.

This was delicious - it makes a ton, and I had guests sneaking tastes out of the leftovers because they enjoyed it so much. It was on the dark side, but I love that taste. I decided to refrigerate the frosting for much longer than 45 minutes because of other comments, and while it did set, the frosting separated, leaving a layer of I think butter on top. Did anyone else have that issue? I just skimmed some off and beat the rest but it wasn't too appealing to begin with!

The perfect chocolate icing. Not too sweet...just right! Beware, this makes a TON of icing. You could cover two cakes easily.

This was very good. I did amend the type of chocolate used, as other reviewers suggested. I used half semi and half milk, and it was just on the edge of being too dark. (I loooove bittersweet chocolate, so it wasn't too dark for me, but it was for the rest of the family.) I used Guittard chocolate chips. As for waiting for it to set up, be sure you stir it every so often when it is in the fridge! That makes a huge difference. After 45 minutes, it wasn't set at all, then I stirred it. Voila! within 15 min it was ready to go. It looks lovely and shiny on the cake. It did make for a very pretty presentation. This will most likely be my go-to chocolate icing from now on. It is good that I can adjust the type of chocolate used based on the people I'm making it for and the type of cake.

The consistency of this frosting is luscious, and it is very easy. I agree that for some cakes, it might not be sweet enough. But it is very easy to substitute some milk chocolate for darker chocolate, uses semisweet rather than bittersweet, and add a little sugar with the corn syrup, and tweak with powdered sugar when you mix in the chocolate after heating. Overall, it is outstanding... not grainy like confectioner's sugar-based frostings often are. Creamy and delicious.

HUGE PETPEEVE...please dont review recipes unless you have actually tried the original recipe. The recipe, as is, is fantastic. No modifications required. It has a great flavour and consistency.

I made this frosting recipe...Came out great!! I used half milk chocolate and half semi-sweet chocolate, once it was cooled in refrigerator, I sifted in 2 cups confectioners sugar, it came out perfect!!

I followed the recipe exactly and used top quality ingredients (plugra butter and Valrhona semisweet chocolate). The consistency was perfect and easy to work with, but the chocolate was much more intense and less sweet than I would have liked to pair with a yellow cake. This would have to be paired with a very sweet cake. If I made it again, I would use milk chocolate or a misture of milk and semisweet.

This is the best chocolate icing I have ever had. It is sooo creamy and not too sweet. Perfect. I will definitely use this again. I made this a couple of days ahead of time and softened it slightly in the microwave when I needed to ice the cake. Worked great. No problems.

This was chocolatey and a deep chocoloate color just like I hoped. It was not as sweet as I like so I added powdered sugar. It lightened the color slightly but was great. Like other reviews it did take longer than 45 minutes to cool and set up. Allow for the additional time and this works out great.

I am a chocoholic and this recipe was just bad. It was wayyyyyyy too dark and rich for an icing. It was fudge-y like a dark ganache. My adult guests loved my cake, but scraped most of the icing off. The kids could not touch it. Blech. Do not use for a birthday cake if children are involved.

Used half bittersweet and semi-sweet chocolate. It was outstanding!

Divine - this icing recipe is easy to make and is delicious. You could eat the icing on its own, it is so good without being too sweet or fatty/buttery like buttercream recipes. The only thing that I found, is that the icing took longer than required to stiffen up. As time was of the essence, I helped it along by sticking in the freezer for a bit. Worked fine. Makes a lot of icing (had lots left over with 3 layer cake).

This icing is fantastic! I like a more almondy flavor, so I reduce the vanilla by a half tsp. and instead use 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 tsp. almond extract. It's great this way, especially on chocolate cake or pound cake.

Great icing and so easy. I made it the night before I needed it and it was the perfect consistency for spreading. It was for my sons 5th birthday cake and the children loved it. Running a knife under hot water every few minutes ensure a glossy finish!

Normally, I wouldn't bother with a recipe that only 75% of the reviewers said they would make again. But all I could see were three reviews, and all of them gave this four forks, and the ingredients looked great, so I decided to go for it. And wow, am I glad I did. This frosting comes together like a dream with almost zero effort. Yes, it takes longer than 45 minutes to set up, so allow for that. The quality of ingredients is key. So for the chocolate and cocoa, use a brand like Valrhona, Ghirardelli, etc., and do not substitute for good-quality butter and cream, and you will not be disappointed. I think that the 75% rating must have something to do with the cake recipe that this frosting recipe originally accompanied.

This is the perfect icing! I have hunted for years for an easy - spreadable and delicious icing and I finally found it (cue ray of sun bursting through an opening in the clouds and angelic music) The first reviewer said cumbersome!?!?!?! I LOVE this recipe.

Rating: 4
Oh my God, what fabulous frosting!!! I can't believe the previous reviewing found it "cumbersome", as it couldn't have been simpler. Stuck it in the fridge for a couple of hours to set up while I made other portions of a birthday dinner, took it out, beat it, and frosted the cake. Fantastic flavor and texture (bring on the Lipitor!). I used it with the Easter cake from the April 1999 Gourmet, and it drew nothing but raves from all concerned.

This Cake is reminiscent of the Lord Battenburg cake of the 19 century. It has the Almond and orange features that were popular of that era. So I Tried it. WOW! The frosting was a little cumbersome time wise so plan about 1/2 hour more than given, but worth the wait. I added a covering of marzipan before I frosted and it really had the Battenburg cake taste.
