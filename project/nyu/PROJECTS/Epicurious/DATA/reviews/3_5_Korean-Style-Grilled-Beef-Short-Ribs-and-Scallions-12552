The recipe is a good pace to start, but I made the following changes: brown sugar and beef flanken ribs. Marinating overnight and then grilling makes them very tender and flavorful.

I know that ribs should always be cooked low and slow..... I'm not sure why I fell for this grilling business. It's too late for me but save yourself!

I've made this a couple of times and everyone who has tasted them, has loved them. They can be tough and fatty, so be sure to have them cut as the recipe suggests and marinate overnight as well. Grilled scallions are very good as are seasoned grilled white onions in foil with these ribs. The chopped spinach with sesame seeds suggested with another korean style rib recipe and rice makes a terrific dinner.

I made this for dish for Christmas eve - everyone loved them but the meat was a little tough for me (not a big beef fan). I will try the marinate with chicken/pork as well. Overall it made a nice presentation.

Iwill def make this again. I broiled these on high, top rack for 6 min turned and then 4 minutes. They were perfect and tasted jsut like grilled. I used rice vinegar and the kiwi trick and marinated 24 hrs. Next time I think I will addd more sugar.

The flavor was fantastic! I made this for a party and received nothing but raves about it. The grill time was quick so be sure to watch it carefully. This is a keeper.

Made this for the first time and both wife and 18 year old son loved it. I too used the rice vinegar. Not only were the short ribs done just right, the scallions were delicious also. Definitly a keeper. Already entered in my recipe box.

This was just delicious. I was scared to make ribs for the first time but it was so easy. Like other reviewers suggested, I rubbed the ribs with kiwi before marinating them. I also used rice wine vinegar instead of cider vinegar. I let them marinate for about 8 hours and then made them in the broiler since we live in an apartment and don't have a grill. Absolutely delicious and I can't wait to make this again. I'll definetly give the ribs at least 24 hours of marinating time because this was so good after only 8 hours - I am sure they'll be absolutely divine with the extra time.

These are wonderful! My family loves them - when beef short ribs go on sale at the store, I know what I'm making for dinner. If you start them the night before, it's a quick meal - throw them on the grill when you get home from work, serve them with steamed white rice (I sometimes get it from the local Chinese carryout to save time) and a little salad (cucumber ribbons, seasoned rice vinegar and sesame seeds make a great, simple salad), and everyone is happy.

Excellent! My family requested I make this again so I decided to rate the recipe. I follow the other cooks and rub the Kiwi on the ribs and used Rice wine vinger. I wouldn't change a thing. The ris are tender and juicy. This is definetly a keeper.

Good recipe -- I would use a little more sugar maybe to help counter-act the saltiness of the soy. I live in an apartment so instead of grilling them I broiled them on the lowest broiler pan "slot" in the oven - worked great!

Since moving to rural Iowa from Las Vegas, there are no Korean restaurants, therefore, have had to make my own Korean dishes. This Korean bar-b-que (Kalbi) is very easy. Have eliminated the scallions, sesame seeds, and less garlic, depending on who is going to eat it. Nevertheless, it was still very delicious, and enjoyed by my husband's daughter and her family in Virginia, who do not adventure in too many ethnic cuisine. I have it at least once every two weeks, and use boneless beef ribs. They do not sell ribs with bones, here in Iowa where I live. My husband loves it as I do.

Excellent!

Wow! This was very yummy! As recommended by the others, I added kiwi, more sugar and soy sauce. I also used seasoned rice vinegar instead of the white vinegar. I used this sauce to marinate some beef and made stir-fry with onions & peppers!

I haven't made this but buy pre-marinated kalbi short ribs from a local butcher and they are amazing!!! I can't wait to try this. Does anyone think it would be good for marinating boneless skinless chicken thighs?

I love this receipe! I have added a bit more soy sauce and sugar. I usually let it marinate for about 36 hours - it seems to pick up more flavor. I have used the marinade with all kinds of ribs including pork, country style, and baby back ribs - friends say these are the best ribs they ever ate.

I've had better Kal-bi short ribs. This marinade is OK, but seems to be missing something.

SUPERB! I MADE THIS RECIPES TWO TIMES LAST WEEK. THE SECOND BATCH I INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF SUGAR AND SOY SAUCE WHICH TASTE EVEN BETTER. MY FATHER AND I ARE GOING TO DROP OUR FAVORITE KOREAN BBQ RESTAURANT WHCIH EVEN SERVE THE PRIME MINISTER OF KOREA. AGAIN, I AM SO GREATFUL FOR THE ONE WHO SHARE THIS RECIPES WITH US.

I grew up watching my mom make this dish (kahl-bee) in the kitchen, but going to college, i noticed that she never measured for any of her ingredients. This is a great recipe that is similar to the one that my mom makes. to make it a little more sweeter, try adding a little coke/pepsi to the marinade... just a few teaspoons.

I make this recipe because I had all the ingredients on hand. Used boneless short ribs, substituted rice vinegar as suggested. I didn't have enough green onions to grill, so I just diced up what I had and threw them in the marinade. The results were great. Next, I'll try the July 2002 recipe, and compare the results. BUT, you can't go wrong with this easy, tasty dinner.

A little bit salty. I used boneless short ribs and they were so tender. Everyone enjoyed this dish.

Rating: 4
I also used rice wine vinegar and rubbed the ribs with kiwi. I paired this with the Asian Noodle, Mushroom and Cabbage Salad recipe and the Chopped Spinach with Toasted Sesame Seeds in the July 2002 Bon Appetit. Dessert was Grilled Nectarines with Balsamic Vinegar Glaze - another epicurious recipe. A wonderful summer dinner. Thanks to the cooks who suggested the small changes to the original recipe which I believe made a very big difference.

Grilling in Guam. I read the reviews prior to trying this marinade. Used boneless short ribs. I rubbed the meat with kiwi fruit as suggested and used rice vinegar. Totally tender and definitely delicious. We had it tonight and my family wants to have it again. One of the best marinades we have had. We will make it again and use this for friends or special BBQ.

Being Korean myself, I have tried several different "cookbook" recipes of this Korean BBQ and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with this one. As mentioned in a previous review, I rubbed 1/2 a kiwi on the meat before the marinate, changed the vinegar to rice wine vinegar, and finely sliced scallions into the marinate. It was delicious! My husband loved it and it was easy to make. I give it 3+ forks :)

Don't everyone yell at me at once, but I think this is an amazing recipe once a few changes are made. I've made it five times with beef ribs and once with veal ribs, so far--it's great. I ditch the ginger, add sesame salt as well as the sesame seeds, use rice vinegar instead of white, chop about 6 scallions very finely and add them to the marinade, and add about 1/4 cup Korean hot bean paste (this really doesn't make the ribs too spicy, but rather savory and excellent). I let them marinate for 48 hours, mixing the seasonings into the meat and flipping the container every 12 hours. My mouth waters just thinking about this dish--it's very, very good.

Excellent recipe! I definitely would make it again and it's so easy to make especially for a large group of people. I actually used boneless beef shortribs from Costco, chopped some of the scallions and added it into the marinade along with some cayenne pepper. It turned out great.

This recipe was delicious! I made it for a family luncheon and everybody raved about it. There wasn't a peice left. I will definitely make it again.

I haven't tried this specific recipe yet, but as a born and bred Korean I'll disclose a secret: rub beef with a mashed kiwi to keep it tender. Don't use too much kiwi or else the meat will fall right off the rib bone. Try it...you won't be disappointed!

This is one of the best and simplist marinades that I have ever used. It has also recieved the highest praise from my friends - "can you make that again for us?" Serve with brown rice and grilled veg - a knock-out!

Taste almost the same as in the Korean Restaurant. Add some black pepper will make it perfect.

The marinade is really wonderful. I agree that it should be tried on pork ribs. Short ribs are too tough. Pork baby back ribs would be great!

Be brave. Add some red pepper flakes to the marinade. Whoo boy!

I really enjoyed this recipe. For all of you who have been to Hawaii and had the "secret sauce" ribs at Kimos, this is as close as it gets. I only had a 6 hour marinade time and the meat was still very full of the marinade flavor.

delicious marinade, the whole family loved this, i might try the marinade on pork ribs too.

A fantastic dish to have for dinner with some white rice thrown in. I was hesitant about the scallions but they made a great accompainment to the ribs. I bought the meatier beef short ribs; it took almost 35 minutes to cook for medium-rare but it was well worth the wait.

The next time I make this dish I intend on using rice vinegar instead of white vinegar. I think the flavor will be a bit better and a whole lot more "oriental".

If you can spare the marinating time, these short ribs were an absolut hit at our last dinner party. They are easy and make for a great meal while entertaining.
