Great! Was skeptical about the syrup but it is fantastic. Really pairs well with the walnuts. Made it again with pistachios instead and also added some cranberries it was just as good. Also great with some poached pears.

Loved this recipe! For the syrup, I doubled the lemon juice and zest. I did not have honey, so sustituted pure maple syrup and used turbinado raw cane sugar which gave it a little molasses flavor...YUM! This is a keeper...

This is a great recipe - very quick and easy to put together from ingredients in your pantry, and no cleanup required either! I increased the amount of lemon juice in the syrup to 3 teaspoons, and also added some dark rum along with the zest. Next time I might add a wee bit more flour so that the cake is a little less sticky after having soaked in the syrup.

I doubled the recipe because there was two of us. I was looking for something quick and easy to make because I had to prepare a birthday dinner in a very short time. This was perfect. Would have been too sweet if not for the lemon, which balances the sweetness well. Definitely a keeper for me.

Its a bit hard to rate this, as I used King Arthur toasted hazelnuts instead of walnuts and the end result was a bit too dry. As others have mentioned using other nuts, I submit this as a recommendation to use more butter or even yogurt in the cake if using these hazelnuts. Texture aside, the flavour was excellent.

Oh my!! Just perfect for the singlegirl needing a dessert fix. Easy to make, great flavor. The lemon zest is the key. Looking forward to making this again this weekend.

I doubled the recipe and used toasted pecans. Wonderful!

This is truly a fool proof recipe. Fill up the ramekins so they puff up nicely. I would love to try this with other nuts (almonds maybe?)
