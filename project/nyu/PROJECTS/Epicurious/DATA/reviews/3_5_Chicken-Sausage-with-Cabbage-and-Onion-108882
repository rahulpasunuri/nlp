I made this as a side dish to a roast pork w/o the sausage. It was delicious! I'll make it again WITH sausage just for fun.

Well, it's been 7-1/2 years since I made this the 1st time. This time I actually found fully-cooked Turkey Sausages!!! Jimmy Dean's 75% less fat Turkey sausages, along with BB's 65% less fat Turkey Bacon allowed me to add extra butter to fry the onions, since I had no l/o grease in the pan. EXCELLENT RECIPE. Hubby said it was a Gourmet delight--I just said it was EPI!!! (Served hot buttered brown rice on the side.) Seriously, do try this just as written--it is very simple and the apple cider vinegar and butter at the end really add depth to the flavors. Can't wait to make it again...

I made this with a cajun chicken sausage and the added spice was a great addition. I did as others did and chopped the cabbage, cooking it with the onions and then adding the sausage and bacon again to heat through. Great flavor.

This is now a regular staple for a weeknight meal. Even my 2-year old loves it. It's sweet, salty and satisfying without being heavy at all. Cooking it ahead of time allows the cabbage to mellow out a little bit, but even the night of, it's delicious and worth a try.

this was good, i substituted prosciutto for the bacon and used olive oil in place of the bacon fat. i still felt it was kinda greesy and unhealthy and the cider cut the gressyness in an unappetizing way. it did go well over the cabbage, though.

This was delicious, fast and easy. I used red cabbage, and omitted the bacon...replacing the fat with olive oil, instead. I'm sure the bacon is very tasty but I didn't have any on hand and well, I have to pick my battles in the fat dept sometimes. Do use a very large onion, as mine was more on the med/large size and we found ourselves wanting a bit more onion/sauce to go with the cabbage. Otherwise this was terrific, filling, and great with an Alsatian Riesling. Simple red potatoes or great crusty bread would make a great addition, too.

I'm watching my fat intake so I eliminated the bacon and butter and added extra virgin olive oil instead. This was soooooooo good--and reheats great for lunch the next day.

The combination of flavors in this dish is OUTSTANDING!!! Didn't have pre-cooked chicken sausages, so I used a mix of 25% raw Italian sausage (casing removed) and 75% bulk turkey sausage. After mixing these two together, I formed small balls that I fried until they were done. Removed them from the skillet and then fried the bacon (Louis Rich 65% less fat) until almost done. Added the onion to the bacon and fried this a couple more minutes. Then added the sausage back in, and then added the apple cider vinegar and butter. Served this with "Mashed Potatoes with Green Onions and Parmesan". A MEAL TO DIE FOR. ENJOY!!!

I made this frying the bacon first, then removing it from the pan and sauted aidells smoked chicken and apple sausage, cut in half lengthwise in the drippings (the apple flavor complimented this dish wonderfully). I then removed the sausage and sauted the raw onion and cabbage, covering it and stirring often to bring up brown bits from the bottom of the pan until the onion and cabbage were wilted.. this took ~ 1/2 an hour. Then I added back the sausage and bacon and heated through, added the vinegar and heated, then removed from heat and added butter.. this was delicious but even better the next day. Next time I will make this a day ahead.

I have been making cabbage, bacon and onion for years. I like the addition of the chicken sausage. Try this variation...it will add quite a bit more flavor to your cabbage: Fry bacon until crisp and remove from pot. Add diced onion to grease and cook slightly then add chopped cabbage. Cover and stir pot quite often, scraping bits from bottom of pan. Cook until cabbage is wilted and add cooked bacon back in. I cook cabbage for quite a while, as it become quite mellow the more it cooks.

I have to confess I used red cabbage because I don't like green cabbage. Otherwise I made the recipe exactly as written. It was delicious and a nice change of pace. Next time I might use a bit less bacon, so the flavor of the sausage and the onions come through a bit more. Definitely worth making, however. Enjoy.
