I agree with all the reviews that give this recipe a low rating. It was surprisingly bland and I will not make this again.

Boring! I too was looking for a warm autumn salad, but this missed the mark. It needed something. Maybe if the apples weren't cooked? The texture was boring and the flavors were too bland. It looked delicious and sounded delicious with the chestnuts...but missed the mark in my book.

My fiance and I did not really enjoy this one, despite the fact that we wanted a warming autumn salad... I think he only ate it because he was so hungry! We took the earlier advice and used sherry vinegar instead of red wine vinegar because it was available. I felt that it too sweet and not enough variability to really excite us. Won't do this one again!

I disagree with the previous reviewer - I thought this salad was lovely and a nice change to salad dinner on a crisp Autumn evening! The warm rich dressing slightly wilted the arugula, but the more hardy greens stood up to it. (Since I had no escarole, I used a mix which included frisee --a terrifc addition). Also substituted sherry vinegar for red wine and it worked fine. This is a keeper.

Love everything in this recipe, but I was disappointed by the final product. I'm usually pretty good about finding a way to pull so-so recipes together, but this just didn't work. Don't waste the chestnuts -- there are too many other great uses for them, such as the chestnut and celery soup elsewhere on this site.
