Bland, quite surprisingly, and spicy.

It's the only way I've ever had lima beans prepared that they didn't tasted like a nasty wet baby poo.

I recommend making this recipe a day in advance. I used a heavy hand with all of the spices, including the salt and pepper. I liked it much better the next day, once the flavors had a chance to develop. I served it at room temp, with some olive oil drizzled on top, as well as some black and white sesame seeds. Delish, and my friends loved it.

I took this to a party where it was a major hit. I used fresh lima beans and kicked up the cayenne a bit and served it with pita bites. UMMM!

I would definitely make this again, everyone that ate it LOVED it including my three year old who is green averse.

I loved this take on hummus. To give it more flavor, I sauteed the onions and garlic. In the same pan, I added the lima beans and simmered them with chicken broth instead of water. I didn't have mint on hand, so I had to forego. I served it warm with veggies.

After all these great reviews, I had to try this recipe, even though I am wary of recipes that call for boiling onions and garlic. That method always produces an unpleasant smell and taste to me and this recipe did also. I guess I just don't like the taste of boiled onions and garlic. I think if they were sauteed in olive oil and then added to the processor with the cooked lima beans, I would love this recipe. I will be serving this tomorrow but would not make this hummus as written next time.

I love this, and it has been a hit everywhere I've taken it. I skip the mint, don't wilt the onion, and add a 1/2 bunch of chopped cilantro at the end as well as a few spoonfuls of green-chile/tomatillo salsa for a little extra kick at the end. Whir it around in the food processor, serve with pita chips and voila...party dip. I've also used the leftovers as a filling for a begetarian wrap sandwich--spread hummus it on a whole wheat tortilla, add thinly sliced tomato, bean sprouts, thin sliced cukes and some feta cheese, roll it up and lunch.

fantastic! i love limas and love spices more so i reduced the amount of beans to a 12 oz bag so it was nice and spicy. the mint and dill really do add something so don't skip them. this is similar to another great recipe on this site that uses the puree as a bed for roast lamb. search for lamb and lima and you'll find it. yum.

I agree completely with the previous writer. I also made this for our New Year's Day party, and will definitely do so agian. I tastes like a little hint of spring in the middle of winter. I won't wait for another party to make it -- it would be great to have on hand during the week.

This is the second time I've made this for our annual New Year's Day feast, and for the second time, it was a huge hit. Healthy and tastes good? A miracle.

For some silly reason, the grocery store ran out of frozen lima beans and the canned ones were way too pricey so I resorted to the usual chickpeas (garbanzo beans) for this recipe. I followed this reciped to the 'T' and I have to say I've never had better hummus in my life! The dill, mint and cilantro make such a big difference! I'd definitely want to try with the lima beans but just so you all know, it also works wonderful with garbanzo beans too! Cheers!

Sure don't know what all the shouting is about with this one. It needed about one cup of the boiling liquid to get to a decent consistency, plus a couple of tablespoons of butter to give it a good taste. I'll agree you can fool your lima-bean-hating friends with it, but I think a recipe should have more going for it than that.

I liked the novelty of using lima beans instead of run-of-the-mill garbanzo beans for hummus -- but really, the flavour isn't all THAT different. I wouldn't bother making it if I didn't have the fresh herbs from my garden on hand. The color is quite pretty, though -- and your guests will certainly enjoy it.

This was incredible...took it to a party with people who are not 'food adventurous' and I had people asking me for the recipe all night!

This is delicious, easy to make and very good for you, too! I made half the recipe (it makes a lot) and since I didn't have fresh dill and mint, I used a bit of dried thyme and dried mint along with the fresh cilantro and parsley. I think you could easily play with the herbs to your taste. I ate it with store-bought rice crackers.

I recently bought dry baby lima beans and was looking for a recipe to use them. This sounded so good. So I soaked the beans overnight and cooked them until tender the next day. I added the garlic and onion at the end and simmered about 10 min. Turned off the stove and started adding the cilantro and parsley and followed the recipe out. This was a yummy and filling meal. We used pita bread that we brushed lightly with olive oil and toasted both sides on our pancake griddle.

I even went to the grocery prior to making this hummus. When i got home I realized I didn't have any cayanne pepper!! yikes...so I substituted a jalapano pepper..Not sure if that was a good or bad substitution, but we LOVED the hummus..We never would have thought it was made from lima beans and as other readers have mentioned, its very light...this IS better than any hummus we have purchaced in a grocery store....try and enjoy!!! We will make again for sure!!!!

I didn't think I'd ever like anything with lima beans. But when my son planted some unknown white beans in our garden bed and up they came, I had to find something - and this was perfect. I love hummus and the fresh herbs make it so intense and tasty. Great with the pita chips or crostini. My mother didn't even make me sit at the table until I was finished eating my lima beans: They were gone! Made half the recipe - plenty.

Wow! This is really good! 3 1/2 forks. No one could believe that this was made w/ lima beans -- and the lima bean haters loved it even after they found out. Half a recipe was still a whole lot of hummus. Next time I make this (and I will), I will increase (prob. double) the garlic, but no other changes.

Fabulous and healthy, and unless you tell people it's lima beans, they'll never guess! It's a perfect blending of ingredients. However, I halved the recipe, and it was more than enough for the 6 people it was serving - making a whole recipe would have been excessive.

Everyone that tried this liked it. One friend says she doesn't like lima beans, but this is the second time I've served them to her & she liked them!!

Weeks ago I inadvertently purchased a package of frozen lima beans that I have been desperate to get out of my freezer. I came upon this recipe by mistake and fell in love with it. As a non-lima fan, this is a winner. The flavors are wonderful and it tastes great with baked pita chips.

I've made this twice now and everyone wants the recipe. This hummus is strangely light and delicate. I used fried flour tortilla chips and the combination was incredible. (Suggestion: a little powdered ginger in the lima bean cooking water mutes the effects of beans on some North American digestive systems, so says Aunt Edna.)

This recipe makes A LOT of hummus. I divided it up and froze 4 containers (hope it freezes well). I served it in toasted pita bread with romaine lettuce & sliced tomatoes and a tossed salad on the side. EXCELLENT!!!! Such a wonderfully healthy meal!

Made this recipe for a Super Bowl party and it was a great hit. Today (May 27) a friend reminded me that I still owed him this recipe. Definately a hit with great legs (4 months and stillrequested!)
