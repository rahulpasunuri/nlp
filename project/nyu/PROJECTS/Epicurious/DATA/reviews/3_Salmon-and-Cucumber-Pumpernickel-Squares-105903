This recipe was delicious! I have made it twice so far and have made extra filling to keep in my fridge to eat with fresh raw veggies or homemade bagel chips. It's amazing just how much the dill & cucumber enhance the taste of the salmon. The second time I made this recipe, I substituted the poached salmon with canned sockeye salmon. It was quite nice.

Waiting until the last minute to add the diced cucumber is a good idea. Overall, this is too expensive for the result and, as noted, too rich to eat much of - most guest ate only a single square or two.

This recipe called for way too much cucumber. Even half was too much. It needs the addition of capers or something to relieve the blandness. Definitely doesn't need the cream.

Made this recipe for a black tie Clinton fundraiser I catered...everyone raved and asked for the recipe.

I made mini pans (6 sqs ea) for christmas "thank you"s. Got great reviews.

Decent recipe as is, but I suggest a few minor changes. As is, it is extremely rich and I didn't eat more than two squares. The second time I made it, I used some plain yogurt and a little less smoked salmon (which also cut down on the price). A little freshly ground black pepper on top not only looks nice, but adds to the flavor. One note, I made it day ahead of time and the cucumber looked a bit 'wilted', so I might cut and add the cucumber closer to serving time. This is easy to prepare and being able to get most of it out of the way a day or two in advance is a great benefit when hosting a party.

Excellent taste and appearance. The only change I made was to use 1/2 a cucumber.

This was too much work and far too expensiveto be so disappointing! The crust fell apart and the filling was nasty-rich. I made it as a Christmas hors d'oeuvres and nobody ate more than one.

What could be better than a make-ahead hors d'oeuvre??? This was my contribution to Xmas Day dinner. I made it two days ahead and it traveled beautifully (in the pan) via subway to the host's home. Looked great when cut into squares and place on a bright red platter. Everyone LOVED it...so light and refreshing! Many requests for the recipe!

Like the other reviewer I gave it two forks because I liked but did not love it. The mousse part doesn't call for S & P and it DEFINATELY NEEDS it. I made the crust too thin but it still worked out. I ran the knife under hot water before cutting and it did cut very nicely. I also would not call this a "keeper" as it is somewhat time consuming and therefore not worth the effort.

I'd make it again, but with modifications. I'm always amused by posts in which the recipes are modified creating a new dish. Well, here I go. I liked this dish when someone brought it to an office party. The salmon filling had been cut in half, and there was less smoked salmon in it. Unmodified, serve it from brunch with a salad and champagne. It's really a meal left unchanged.

Took the advice of a reviewer and made these in metal mini-muffin cups (sprayed with vegetable oil)... pretty presentation, easy to remove from the pans, and delicious. (Recipe makes 60+ mini-muffin-cup sized morsels.)

It cut beautifully - just like the photo in the magazine. I had been afraid that it wouldn't, but it was fine. To help the cucumber adhere, be sure to cut it into small enough dice. Also, do use your hands to press the it slightly into the salmon filling. I feel bad only ranking this a 2, but the description for a 2 says "Like it, don't love it" and that really does fit. It IS good, don't get me wrong, but it isn't great.

Nice combination of flavors and excellent presentation. Fabulous for parties! Easy to make, too.

This was wonderful! Everyone loved it. It was a bit hard to handle with the cucumbers all over the top, they kept falling off. Next time I will use less cucumbers. The salmon mixture with the cream firmed up nicely in the refridgerator. A definite party item!!!!

Great combination of flavor and texture. Made in both metal baking and non-stick mini muffin pans. Like the mini muffin pan version better -- perfect appetizer size and much easier to manage. Guests loved them!

The pumpernickel crust developed tiny cracks when it was in the oven, but after being refrigerated with the salmon mixture on top it held together just fine. My guests must have loved it; someone ate the leftovers right out of the fridge.
