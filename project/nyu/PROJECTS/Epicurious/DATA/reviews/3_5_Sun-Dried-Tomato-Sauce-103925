Just OK and unnecessarily complicated, but a good base for a creative cook. I added cayenne, saffran and garlic and then it was perfect. I don't see why you couldn't make the reduction and then add everything, cook, season, strain and blend.

I like a tart sauce with my fish like malt vinegar but I did think that this one was a bit too tart. I added a little honey at the end and then it was very good but for all the fat in the sauce, 1 whole cup of cream and oil-packed tomatoes I don't think I would make it again.

This fell a bit short of my expectations. It was quite tart due to the amount of vinegar. I did use less cream than stated, maybe that was part of the problem. I also believe that 8 minutes was too short for the flavour of the pepper and the bayleaf to infuse. And I don't see why you should add the chicken stock only until the last moment. But still, it's a nice recipe, it only needs to be worked on.

I followed other reviewers' advice and used basil instead of thyme. I could only find vinegar that was a mixture of red and white wine, and that might have been too strong because the end sauce was a little too vinegary. Next time I make it I think I'll use lemon juice instead. I also omitted the chicken broth to make it kosher. This time I put it over spaghetti, so next time I will use chicken broth and not cream and put it over chicken.

This sauce is so good. Even my picky 5 year old likes it. I added 4 cloves of roasted garlic and 1/2 tsp. of dried basil. We will use this recipie again!

Very tasty, though the sauce wasn't thick enough for my taste. I added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken. I did not puree the tomatoes, just chopped them a bit for texture. I also doubled the recipe and it seemed as if 2 cups of wine was too much, since it took forever to boil down and never quite got down to just 6 tablespoons.

Great sauce! I changed thyme for 1 tbsp. fresh basil and I loved this recipe. Very versatile, goes well with chicken or pasta.

I served the sauce over penne with chicken. It was good, but not good enough to make again. I think that pureeing the sun-dried tomatoes took away their zing and made the mixture taste more like tomato paste.

This has to be one of the best sauces I've ever tasted! The only change I would make would be to add a little fresh basil, and use slightly less thyme. I will also try it with half and half to lower the fat content a little.

This sauce is absolutely delicious! I don't have a food processor but I managed just fine with a blender (blended the chicken broth with the tomato mixture in order to keep it from going all gluey at the bottom) It doesn't have to be smooth at all; tangy chunks of tomato in the sauce are yummy!

We really liked this sauce. I used half and half instead of the cream and it worked just fine. We also cooked chicken in olive oil and garlic, diced it up and added it to the sauce and pasta. Yummy!!

This sauce was great! Very light, for a cream sauce. I used white balsamic vinegar, and fresh basil instead of thyme. I put it on fettucini with sauted chicken and garlic, next time I would add some mushrooms. The recipe as written was enough for one 9-oz package of fresh pasta.
