Exceptional salad! I have made this several times for differenet groups and ALWAYS get compliments and/or requests for the recipe. The dressing is key!.I do sub feta for blue cheese. I think any lettuce works but I like the butter lettuce. Have also subbed dried cranberries when I don't have pomegranate seeds handy. Equally good I think.

Flavors are great.

Made this recipe as written for a dinner party and it was very good. Ive since also modified it into a healthier/every day version with spinach instead of butter lettuce (tarragon optional), toasted walnuts instead of sugared and no oil in the dressing - less sophisticated but also pretty good.

This is an exceptional salad with many interesting flavors in the mix, one of the best salad recipes in a long time. As to the previous reviewer who was not able to find pomegranate seeds.....well you need buy a fresh pomegranate available at most large grocers.

The dressing for this salad was awesome, as for the salad I was unable to find butter lettuce so I used Green Leaf lettuce, though next time I will use field greens, I also could not find pomegranate seeds and instead of glazed walnuts I used glazed pecans, I used feta crumbles instead of blue cheese and granny smith green apple instead of Fiji....but with these changes the salad was a huge hit!! I will make this again for sure!

I made this for Superbowl and all the women raved it and wanted the recipe. The men, well, they gravitated toward the dips, roast beef and potatoes...wouldn't even try it. I guess Superbowl wasn't a salad kind of day for them!

Has become my salad favorite--everyone loves it--I cube the apple and coarsely chop tarragon--also any crisp tart sweet apple is fine.

This salad hits on all cylinders - sweet, salt, umami, sour, even bitter (just a bit, from the kernel of the pomegranate seeds). Absolutely delicious. If I were to make one change, it would be to reduce or eliminate the honey in the dressing, but that may be due to the level of candy on the walnuts I used. The fresh tarragon leaves are a stroke of genius.

Excellent salad! The first time I made it I used Spring Mix; the second time I used butter lettuce (preferred the latter). I skipped the apple and forgot to add the taragon. Everyone raved about it.

Great salad! Added a pinch of dry tarragon to the dressing as I had no fresh and used glazed walnuts from another site recipe. Everyone loved it.

This is one of the best salads I have ever eaten. It's a little labor intensive for salad, but that hasn't stopped me from making it three times in 2 weeks. It has gorgeous flavor and texture, great as a side dish or main dish.
