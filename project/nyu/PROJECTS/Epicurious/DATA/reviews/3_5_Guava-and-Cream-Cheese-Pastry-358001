This really didn't work for me. I bought some guava paste on a whim and was looking for a way to use it. To begin, my cream cheese mixture was rather runny (warm day, not the recipe's fault I realize), so "spreading" it onto the pastry was not an option, it oozed far beyond the 1" border. Conversely, the guava mixture (and the previous reviewer is right, it is not a pretty color) was too thick and sticky to dollop with ease, leaving me wondering what would have been so wrong with blending the two mixtures together beforehand. Out of the oven, it just wasn't that great. The cream cheese had an odd texture, and the guava paste just wasn't a hit with me and my boyfriend. I love fresh guavas (when I can get my hands on some), but I'll think twice next time I feel like cooking with paste.

We were looking for something to do with a guava paste and this turned out really good. The guava paste looked a little like hot dogs inside the pastry. I'm going to have to play around a little to get it to look a bit more appealing to the eye. But the taste was really great, and, once cut up, the appearance problem was nonexistent.
