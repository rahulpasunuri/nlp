YUM!! I made a couple of changes based on reviews and ingredients I had on hand. I followed a recommendation from a review and marinated the chicken as stated, but took the chicken out of the marinade to cook, then added the leftover marinade to the sauce. I used 1/4 tsp ground ginger instead of fresh (didn't have fresh on hand), a whole red bell pepper, and the juice of 1 lime since I didn't have lemon. The lime is what sent it over the edge with the flavor. It was FANTASTIC! Thanks for the recipe!!

The peppers and mushrooms caused there to be a lot of water in the pan that I should have drained before adding the sauce, i think that would probably have helped the flavor. Also the cornstarch mixture came of the chicken pretty much right after it went in the pan. Mine was a big sloppy mess, but with some tweaking i think this recipe could still be good.

I usually stir fry the meat part first and then remove it to a plate while I cook the veggies. I followed the other suggestions and took the chicken out of the egg/cornstarch and stir fried it in about 2 tsp oil until browned then removed the chicken from the pan. Using about 1 Tbsp oil I stir fried the veggies then after I mixed the remaining egg mix with the sauce I added that to the veg, cooking until it thickened and reduced and then added back the chicken. This keeps the chicken from being overcooked.

I followed the previous reviewer advice and took the chicken out of the egg mixture and sauteed. I added the remaining egg mixture to the sauce at the end and it worked out perfectly. My only complaint is that the chicken was dry. I usually adjust cooking times but didn't in this case because it sounded okay. But when you add the 3 miutes with the veggies and 1 1/2 minutes to glaze and then 1 minute for the spinach way too long for halved chicken tenders. They should be taken out after 2 minutes and add back for the glaze. Good flavor and a nice weeknight dinner with white rice.

I think I see the problem some people have had. Since Velvet Chicken is a phrase that Barbara Tropp uses, I went to her cookbook to see how she "velvets" chicken, and it always involves dipping the chicken into water broth or oil, removing it, and then using it. SO I took the chicken OUT of the egg white mixture to stir fry it. No problem with a gooey mess. I added the marinade back in to the sauce mixture -- since it was going to boil to thicken, there wasn't a health risk. And got a great dish! Next time, I'll add the lemon peel and ginger with the garlic instead of with the sauce, and maybe add some crushed red pepper, but otherwise, it's great!

Follow your instincts. This can be a great base recipe. I tossed in a variety of spicy Asian seasonings and adjusted the listed ingredients. Everything turned out flavorful and tender. No issues with the cornstarch slurry. This recipe made my monthly rotation.

I'd give it zero forks if I could. I still can't figure out what the cornstarch/egg white mixture was for. All of it came off as soon as it hit the pan and made a big, sticky mess. Yes, my pan was hot, oil was smoking. The vegetables couldn't stir fry because of all the moisture, so they basically boiled until the sauce reduced enough. Flavor was OK but very unappealing look and texture. I use tons of Bon Appetit recipes, this is the first time I've been disappointed.

Did not care for chix bits in pan. I will use whole breasts next time and remove before doing the other ingredients. Needs a bit more cornstarch and a bit of broth to glaze well, but great combo of lemon and ginger. I think I'll try the red pepper flake that was mentioned. Served over basmati. Very light and fresh-tasting meal.

My wife and i loved this :) I used a whisk to make the corstarch mixute fluffy, yes it did stick to the pan, no Biggie. The bell peppers really didn't do much for use. This is a keeper and is one of the best i have made so far. Very Healthy and i never use MSG or anything that may contain it. Thanks

Cornstarch was sticky. Recipe just needed some MSG.

I thought this was subtle and delicious. I don't know why people didn't like it. I don't measure too much but I'm sure I added more of the ginger (which I zested) and the juice and lemon zest. Maybe that changed it. The person who added half the lemon must not like lemon like I do ( but then, why would you make it?) I also added 1/4 cup of minced cilantro. The cornstarch part is no problem. Let the chix sit in it like they say. When you add the sauce it all blends. A tasty, healthy stir-fry. Nothing too fancy but good.

This was basically a good stir fry. I think it was lacking in flavor though. The Garlic and ginger came through but I don't know, somehow it was lacking. Also, like other reviews said, the cornstarch at the beginning was really weird and stuck to the pan. In the end it turned out fine though.

Another keeper for sure. I had no problem with the chicken/cornstarch mixture crusting on the bottom of the pan. It's important to keep stirring the chicken quickly as it cooks. Also added only half of the lemon and lemon peel.

The chicken has a nice tender texture but the rest of the recipe needs more punch. Good backbone despite 2 forks - just needs doctoring.

Rating: 3
I thought this was delicious, but agree with the others who had problems with the egg/corn flour mixture. I made sure to get the wok really hot before adding because I had read that it was a problem and nevertheless it covered the bottom of the wok with a crust. Next time, I'll just marinate the chicken in a soy sauce and sherry mixture before adding it. Otherwise, a great mixture of vegetables and tastes. I also added half a leek - a nice extra touch.

I love the tenderness of the chicken, especially as it is softened by the egg white. This is a very healthy dish and I love the combination of ginger and lemon. It may be a bit different for some palettes, but I really enjoy making this one. The only problem is all the preparation required - cutting the mushrooms and peppers, cleaning all that spinach, grating the lemon, shredding the ginger, etc. I still find it fun to make and I would definitely make it again!

Quick, easy and light. But quite bland! I added crushed red pepper, but that didn't help. I will try it again and double the sauce without doubling the lemon and ginger.

This recipe was delicious, melts in your mouth. I used baby arugula instead of spinach and it added a nice bite. I would definitely make it again. I also used the entire red pepper, not just the half.

My husband liked this dishmore than I did, though the chicken is amazingly tender! Next time I will cut back on the amount of fresh lemon juice required, as it overpowered the rest of the sauce ingredients.

This is an easy stir-fry dish with a zingy sauce that makes it more interesting than many we've tried. Even my husband who is a tough critic, really enjoyed it! I used regular white mushrooms and substituted teriyaki sauce and a little red wine for the sherry. I also added crushed red pepper for a little more kick. Served over rice, this is tasty and filling, and the veggies make for a colorful presentation. Might add yellow or orange peppers next time for even more flair.

This recipe is awful. The chicken looked unappetizing and the ginger over-powered everything. Pass on this one folks.

Delicious low-fat recipe that is a breeze to make! Great lemon/ginger flavor. Did not have shitake mushrooms on hand, so I just used regular sliced white mushrooms and it tasted great!!

Recipe was just okay -- it didn't get rave reviews at my home. The flavors were good together -- but it was just nothing special. Surely there must be some better low-fat chicken recipes.

on a low fat diet you can get awfully tired of chicken. This perks it up tremendously, especially with the lemon juice and ginger. Also easy to make and with little cleanup involved.

Good quick recipe. I whipped the cornstarch mixture until it was really frothy before adding the chicken, and then mixed it well again before adding to the hot wok. I also removed the chicken when almost done, and stir fryed the vegetables alone before recombining the ingrediants.

Very tasty, very easy, and very attractive with bright green spinach, brown rice, and my favorite blue pasta bowls. In fact, I think my favorite part about this dish was how nice it looked when it was served. We had trouble with the cornstarch coating (meaning that it stuck to the pan and not the chicken), but I think if I listen to the recipe and use a nonstick pan next time, I'll be all set. The lemon flavor was just pronounced to make this sauce stand out. Next time I'll use a little bit more ginger.

I find it a shame that some people found this bland, I found it to be quite tasty, but definitely expandable! The sauce is the key, but my cornstarch miture did NOT stick to the chicken like it was supposed to! Oh, well, it cooked up nicely anyway, and I think that I will try it with shrimp the next time! I also want to try it with just vegetables, but that might be tricky! All I know is that my husband, who hates anything different, said I could definitely make this again, so it is for sure a keeper!

I followed the recipe precisely and had good results. It's a tasty low-fat quick meal when served with rice. I would probably use a little more cornstarch and add chicken stock to create more sauce the next time.

I loved this very easy dish. I made some alterations to use things available in the kitchen: 1 tb madeira instead of sherry, those everyday white mushrooms instead of shiitake, and a yellow onion instead of the bell peppper. I also added a chopped celery stalk and went heavy on the ginger. The lemon peel was zested instead of grated. With the spinach I added some (a 1/2 cup?) of chopped cilantro and a little diced hot chili pepper (fire roasted separately) to finish. All ingredients were fresh, which I think made a big difference. The cilantro with the lemon and ginger gave the dish a little Thai twist. As a previous post mentioned to remember... I forgot to start the rice ahead. Instead we made a quick batch of cous cous. This worked really well, and through out the meal comments of "This is so good!" were heard.

This was a easy and delicious dish. As suggested in the other reviews, the addition of vegetables such as carrots and green onions, compliments the dish. Be sure to cook the rice as you prepare the vegetables so that it will be ready to serve upon completion of stir frying.

This dish had scrumptious flavor! I had a little trouble keeping the egg-cornstarch mixture on the chicken after it was supposed to rest for 15 min. It kinda just slid off. I also used just a green pepper, as thats what I had on hand. But the sauce was something else! Really delicious.

I made this last night and found it to be delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, making sure I used two very large garlic cloves. I had to add an extra half-teaspoon of cornstarch to make the sauce thicken and form a glaze. I didn't find the dish to be bland at all, and enjoyed the fresh lemon and ginger flavor (I grated my ginger). If you wanted to make it spicy, you could add some red pepper flakes to the sauce. A bit of dark sesame oil might be a nice touch too. Enjoy!

I followed the recipe to a tee and both my husband and I liked it very much. I am generally picky about stir fry. So many of them just taste like soy sauce. I found the addition of sherry and lemon very pleasing.

We found this to be very bland. If I made it again I'd definitely add more garlic and ginger and maybe some soy sauce. It also would benefit from a greater variety of veggies like carrots, squash and brocoli for more flavor, color and crunch.

This was so-so. Not bad, but not memorable either. We added some garlic chili sauce to zip it up but my husband gave me one of his "don't make this again" looks. Also, I'm not sure why, but my chicken did not look like the picture - i.e., it didn't have that glazed appearance.

I would nearly double the sauce or at least add more garlic and ginger to make the stir-fry a bit more flavorful. All and all it was a delicious and easy weeknight dinner.
