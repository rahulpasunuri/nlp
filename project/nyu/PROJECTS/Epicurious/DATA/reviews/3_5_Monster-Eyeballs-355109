The taste is amazing...but I agree with only using 2 cups of sugar. I found them very easy to make...I warmed the peanutbutter before mixing, and before rolling into balls. I stuck toothpicks in before chilling, froze the p.b. balls instead of using the fridge, and did in batches. They looked good, tasted great, and wern't too messy or time consuming.

This recipe is delicious and very simple! What I found helped was to warm/melt the peanut butter and butter before mixing, and again before rolling. It made rolling easier. I also put a toothpick in each ball before chilling, which made dipping easier. I also melted the chocolate and shortening in my fondue pot, which kept it warm the whole time I was dipping.

I made this for our office halloween party and they turned out well. I am so glad I read the reviews because you should absolutely half the sugar in the recipe. I did and I am so glad that I did. I was surprised how easy it was to dip the dough so it looked like corneas. But I agree with the reviews that you should dip in batches and keep the other balls frozen, or else you run the risk of breaking the dough apart. This makes a good, not revolting Halloween treat. Also - it's probably one of the messiest things I have ever made - so beware!!

One of the best candy recipes I've seen. They are amazingly easy to make and taste GREAT!

Way too much sugar. I highly suggest using half the called for amount. And hard to dip, i tried every way possible. Using a fork only broke the balls in two.

I made these and thought they were great tasting and easy to make. The only part I thought was pretty hard to make was the peanut butter balls because the crumbled easily. I thought the chocolate and peanut butter tasted amazing together and will definitely make them again.

Way too much sugar. As easy as it was it wasn't even close to a peanut butter bar.

I made this recipe for the halloween season. I followed the recipe as written... bad idea! I would highly suggest cutting the sugar from 4 cups to 2 cups. Also it was really hard to cover the eyes with chocolate I used a fork and some eyes fell apart or I just covered the whole eye!!!

Excellent - tedious to make, but the taste is worth it. They go fast, so I would recommend at least doubling the recipe for a party - and definitely freeze the balls a few minutes before you dip in the chocolate.

Very easy to make. I found it easier to use my fingers to roll eyeballs in choclate.

I'm giving this 3 forks because of the changes I made... which I usually hate when people do! But here you go. I used organic peanut butter with the oil poured off. I started pouring the oil off a month in advance and kept pouring it off periodically until it was really dry. 2 cups of dry peanut butter 1 can sweetened condensed milk 1 cup powdered sugar I mixed these up together as best I could, microwaved them for 1 minute intervals until it got bubbly hot, stirring well in between. After this cooled and, I chilled it over night. Formed them into balls, dipped them in melted chocolate, topped them with an M&M. They were fabulous! So much so that I can't imagine doing them any other way! I might add a little salt to the peanut butter this year ;)

What a great twist on candy Buckeyes! I loved these. I used a natural peanut butter (Kroger's store brand) that didn't have any added sugar and the final sweetness and consistency was fine. It really did help to freeze the pb balls and to only pull out a few at a time for dipping in the chocolate--thanks for that tip. One other note, we brought these to an outdoor Halloween block party and by the end of the evening the few 'eyeballs' that were left had runny irises (m&ms). Not that that stopped people from eating them!

This was easy and delicious. I left out the shortening and substituted about 1 oz of parafin wax which my great aunt used to use for a butter creams recipe I still make. it worked great to keep the chocolate in tact. Also, I put the peanut butter balls in the freezer for about 20 minutes with the toothpicks in them which made dipping much easier. I took them to work and everyone loved them and wanted the recipe!

The monster eyeballs were not only delicious, but also CREEPY! They were the first item that sold out at my daughter's Halloween bake sale.

I made a batch of these and they taste wonderful! I agree with the reviewer who wrote that they taste like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. I gave some as a gift to friends, and froze about a dozen. I will make these "monster eyes" for Halloween every year.

Made this for a halloween party. They came out delicious. I reduced the sugar a bit. Mixing the peanut butter and other ingredients together was very messy. Definitely use your hands.

Very easy but tedious! I put everything in the stand mixer and the consistency was great, not lumpy. I chilled them and had no issues with dipping in the chocolate. I really don't understand the negative reviews, they were so simple! They taste like Reeses Peanut Butter cups.

I made these recently for a Halloween party at work. They were all gone in minutes! However I only had one...but that is as many as I would want. They are very rich and sugary. I didn't even put in the full amount of sugar that was called for (thank goodness!) I also used ghirdelli (sp?) chocolate which was great. I couldn't find mini M&Ms so I just made them a bit bigger and used regular M&Ms. These were very easy to make. Just a bit time consuming. I wouldn't make them again for myself, but they make a great dessert for a party.

I enjoyed this treat very much. My boyfriend from Ohio was thrilled to see that I was making "Buckeyes" My only suggestion would be to not use the vegetable shorting. Its not necessary for having the chocolate solidify and it adds an unpleasant taste. I tried the recipe without it and it works great!

These were easy to make and came out great! I used "natural" peanut butter and they were a little dry. Next time I will add a little more butter. They were a little difficult to dip in the chocolate, but once I got the hang of it there wasn't a problem. I too used the m&m to cover the skewer hole.

I've just made my second batch. The kids loved it the first time, the adults loved it the second time. I loved it both times, but I'm covered head to to in chocolate! I used regular peanut butter the first time, low fat the second time. I didn't have any significant trouble with either. I used a wooden satay skewer for the dipping, and used the m&m to cover the hole. I did find that I occasionally had to reheat the chocolate, though.

These look and taste great. We made them a little larger than called for and used regular sized m&ms for the iris. refrigerate the balls and take out a few at a time since if they get too warm they will fall off the toothpick or fork when you dunk them in the chocolate

Way too much sugar. And when making the eyeballs, the teaspoon referred to is not the measurement type but the silverware type.

Rating: 1
The choc. part is very difficult. I messed up 20 out of 67 balls before figuring out a method. Balls should be frozen before "dipping". Chocolate is too thick for dipping. Put melted choc. in a very shallow bowl and use corn cob holders to drag the ball thru the choc. Then fix holes left by holders.

When you use VERY soft butter the dough is very easy to handle and this is a very easy recipe for the end result. Everyone loved these! They are very sweet, next time I may try cutting sugar in half. I also used chopped raisin pieces for the eye instead of M&M's.

These were very tasty, and everyone loved them at our Halloween Party, but a few key suggestions: 1) Don't use lowfat peanut butter as I did - I think the lower fat made it less sticky, and thus they didn't bind together as well. 2) I added Rice Krispies as did another reviewer, which I highly recommend - the crunch added a lot, as they are very rich if just plain. 3) When dipping in the chocolate, you may need to keep rewarming in the micro to keep it soft/fluid enough. 4) I froze mine for about 40 minutes after forming, before dipping, which made them nice and firm, using a toothpick to dip, which worked well. But I did need to use a dab of chocolate on the back of the M&Ms to get them to stick on. Then refreeze until ready to reserve.

I was NOT a fan of this recipe. The peanut butter mixture is FAR too sweet (come on -- an entire BOX of confectioner's sugar?) and was difficult to mix, both by hand and by stand mixer. When I attempted to dip the peanut butter balls into the chocolate they kept falling apart (even after chilling and rechilling!) I brought these to work for a Halloween party and no one could finish one -- they are just too much. And they don't even look that cute, since the peanut butter balls turn out lumpy, and the dipping is difficult. Fail.

The resulting eyeballs were rather delicious, but the recipe was messy and it was not easy to mix with little hands, as is suggested. I would make it again, however, as they received high acclaim when served.

Very difficult for some reason-the peanut butter balls did not stick together even in the frig overnight before putting in the choc-tried a half recipe and perhaps it isn't one to be done in halves. Very disappointed

These were actually pretty easy to make. The peanut butter, butter, sugar and vanilla came together well and the chocolate and shortening were easy to do in the microwave. Tip: To make the openings more "eye-like," you want to rock the ball back and forth in the chocolate to get the oblong shape.

I use a little wax instead of lard and make these every year for Christmas. People start asking me in November when I will be giving them out so they will be home. They hate to miss these "Buckeyes." Instead of M&Ms, I drizzle a little melted chocolate over the top and they look elegant.

Wow, minus the vanilla and m&ms, this is my recipe for Buckeyes! Always a huge hit at parties, even though I no longer live in Ohio. (I now call them "Peanut Butter Balls, though, as some football fans want nothing to do with anything associated to OSU.)

I haven't made these yet but they sound like heaven and fun for kids. For those of you cringing about the lard/shortening, you need this when melting chocolate for coating things. It tempers the chocolate so you get a nice, pretty, shiny coating on the eyeball. Maybe you can cut back, but it's important for the outcome.

DELISH! Just don't think about the fattening ingredients. I must say that the next day (after all the flavors had a chance to settle together overnight) when I placed them on the counter and they hit room temp, they were melt in your mouth FAB!

YUMMY! We make these treats with rice krispies for Christmas every year. The shortening helps the chocolate be shiny. YOu can also use food wax, which is what our recipe calls for.

These are very tasty and are not meant for anyone on a diet! I also made them as a child. The shortening assists in helping the melted chocolate set up. Personally I would not use lard with this.

Lard, butter and peanut butter? I'm all for treats, but this is surely over the top. Wouldn't it be just as good using marshmallows as the center and just melting the chocolate without the shortening?
