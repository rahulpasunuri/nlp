buy the tomato jam and aioli, skip the fried herbs, and this recipe is still fabulous. This is a restaurant recipe that is just too many steps for most home cooks. Store purchased tomato jam and aioli do not change the recipe that much. Will make this again.

This is the most exact recipe I've ever seen. It sounds like a lot of work but delicious. I will add it to my recipes, for when I have a lot of time on my hands.
