This spread/dip lacked personality. It was too bland. Maybe some garlic or, as the previous cook suggested, herbed goat cheese would give it some interest.

I made this dip for a party and my guests raved about it. I used an herbed log of goat cheese instead of plain goat cheese and found that it added a lot of flavor. The only strange part of this recipe is the green beans and corn which are not sturdy enough to be dipped. I'd stick with baguettes and radishes to dip with corn and green beans as a garnish.
