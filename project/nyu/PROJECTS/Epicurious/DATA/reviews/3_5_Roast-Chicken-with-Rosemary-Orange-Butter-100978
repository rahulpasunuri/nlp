I used this as a base to roast a chicken. The main part to take away is to separate the skin from the bird with your hands and then spread the inside and outside with the butter (I do use the rosemary in it). No orange at all. I stuff the bird as well and it comes out great. Gravy also very good.

I thought this turned out superb. The chicken was very moist and flavorful, and the sauce was delicious.

Such a great roast chicken! And the pan sauce was fabulous. I agree with other reviewers: seriously cut back the butter. I also think the amount of orange peel needs to be increased significantly if you want more of that orange flavor. The skin was crisp and the meat was moist.

This was a very nice roast chicken. I followed the recipe and added rosemary and the cut orange to the cavity after zesting it. I also added red potatoes to the other vegetables as my husband loves potates with everything. All in all a lovely supper.

I was ready to put the 7.5 lb. chicken in the aluminum disposable roaster pan and realized I had no rack. I had recently purchased some dried seed-in prunes. I put 6 on the bottom and after roasting pulled them out and was pleased with the added sweetness to the sauce.

I love rosemary chicken, and I found this recipe to be quite good - however (is't there always a however, due to personal taste?) - I baked two chickens, and cut the butter down to 1/2 a cup - and that was way too much butter. I would suggest same amount of herbs, (adding garlic, as previously suggested) and making it more of a dry rub under the skin - with just a tablespoon of butter. Definately toss in a bit of orange, rosemary sprigs and garlic cloves into the cavity! And save any leftover juice or gravy for when you boil down the bones for broth - it made the most amazing chicken noodle soup the next day.

This is more like 2 1/2-3 forks. It was easy and the vegetables were very good. I added oranges to the vegetables which really gave them a fresh citrus flavor. I think the vegetables might have been boring if the oranges had not been added.

I have fresh lemons from our trees and fresh rosemary from our garden, along with some fresh picked flat leaf parsley. Using this recipe and tweaking a bit as suggested, it was awesome! I did use a baste with a touch of grand marnier and limoncello, and that zinged it up a notch in our opinion. I used two whole breasts, with the legs/thighs cut away for this recipe and it truly was a very moist and delicious chicken dish!

Great recipe. With all of the comments about the rosemary being too heavy, I substituted chopped fresh parsley mixed into the butter and orange peel. This provided a nice, fresh but not overpowering flavor. Then, I sprinkled ground rosemary, salt and pepper on the top of the chicken skin. Delicious! Leftover chicken cut up in a green salad were good too.

This recipe was fantastic! I have made it adding lemon peel, cooking potatoes with them and adding whatever fresh herbs I have in hand to the butter. I also added a lot of garlic. We love it. The skin gets crusty and the chicken stays juicy!

One more thing - eat the skin. I basted the bird with the pan drippings throughout the cooking process. They way the orange zest caramelizes on the golden crackle is devine.

It was over 100 degrees this May afternoon in our suburb outside of Los Angeles. So what prompted me to roast a chicken for almost 2 hours in this heat? Admittedly, when I perused the online recipes, I had all the ingredients on hand for this one. Period. Now, I am turning off the air conditioner so the amazing aromas are not filtered out of the house. My family is still at the table as I write this review. I can see my one- year old literally licking her plate a la barbarian. My mother is eating the gravy at the stove top. Ugh! Will there be any leftovers? I prepared this meal per the recipe with the following exceptions: I pushed the pan- roasted solids through the sieve as much as possible, strained off all but a tablespoon of the fat and then put the drippings into a saucepan, brought them to a boil and thickend it with some cornstarch for a silky consistency. Scrumptious! Now, my grandmother is calling, asking me to deliver a plate full. Do make this recipe and try to use the best ingredients you can find/afford. If you would not drink the wine, do not use it to deglaze the pan. Also, I try to keep butter imported from Normandy or Devon in the house. Don't think of the extra cost as you spoon off the fat. The superior flavors make the dish.

Not my favorite roast chicken recipe. I found it haad little flavor. Julia Child's is still the BEST!

Delightful orange flavor with a hint of white wine. If roast chicken can taste gourmet, this recipe certainly achieves it. I put cut the rind-ed orange into quarters and put it in the chicken cavity, which resulted in delciousness. Also, make sure to skim the fat off the "gravy," which isn't a thick traditional gravy but more like a white wine broth sauce. I will DEFINITELY make this again, accompanied by mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce. YUM!

I liked this recipe because it made a moist chicken and also because most of the ingredients I keep on hand. Tip for the sauce: I put it in a bowl in the fridge for an hour so the fat would solidify on top and I just skimmed off.

This chicken was fine, but no great shakes. All I tasted was rosemary. I like the roast chicken chez Louis from the New Basics cookbook much better. More moist and flavorful -- and no stuffing things under the skin required.

This was simple and lovely...I made it with chicken thighs only, arranged in the roaster, and skipped the sauce. Roasting the orange slices was a big hit! Served this with cranberry-pecan quinoa. Would definitely make again.

This was delicious and a huge hit with my guests! It looked just like the picture! I did have to cook it longer than the recipe stated, but it wound up being perfect. I followed others advice and stuffed the cavity with the leftover orange sections and a sprig of rosemary. I followed the recipe just as written, and had no problem skimming off the fat at the end with a fat separator. I also used half the amount of butter mixture, 1/2 was plenty! It would have been overkill, next time I'll half it. I also liked this recipe because it was lower in fat than some others, in spite of all the butter used. Will definitely make again!

The chicken itself was delicious.....all the grease left to make the gravy has a lot to be desired. Entirely too much fat and straining it was not an option for me.

Rating: 3
Excellent flavor, very moist. The aroma during cooking is wonderful. I too stuffed the chicken with quartered orange, fresh rosemary and carrots and used marsala instead of wine. Depending on how much you put into cavity, cooking time may need to be increased. Will definitely make this again.

This is a wonderful chicken recipe that results in tender, juicy and highly flavorful meat, plus a bunch of burnt stuff in the pan. Next time I do this, I am going to start it at 375 for ten minutes and then reduce the heat to 350 for the rest of the cooking time. As it was, I strained the burnt vegetables out of the pan and was able to salvage the juices to make an excellent sauce. (Those who say it was too greasy may have missed to part about skimming the fat, which takes no time with a fat separator.) My husband is not a chicken fan, yet he picked this one clean.

YUM YUM, Its a KEEPER. Invited my friend for dinner. She couldn't stop with how wonderful it was. Like the other's I put the orange and rosemary caviety. I will be making this one again soon. I even gave the receipt to my friend who's not a cook. She's making it for dinner tonight. Jane

This recipe has quickly become a family favourite! I also fill the cavity with quartered orange. The bird is so moist and juicy, and the juices that run are soooo flavourful! Will make this over and over and over again!

I enjoyed this recipe, it was very flavorful. I stuffed the cavity with oranges and rosemary swigs as well. I recommend using less butter, I found it to be a little heavy. With roasted chicken, you can't beat rosemary!!!

This was wonderful and easy. My guest loved it. I made 2 whole chikens so I doubled. I took the advise of others and added crshed garlic to the butter mixture. I put the fesh orange ( after grating for the peel) cut in fours and placed inside cavity. I used dry Marsala wine instead of the white. I squeezed some fresh orage juice over the chickens and I cut the shallots in large pieces to add to the pan so they didn't burn. I cooked them in a large roast pan covered and, uncovered for the last 1/2 hour to brown them up a little more. This made them so moist and gave me a ton of juice but not brown bits for the gravy. Since I had so much juice from the birds I did not add the canned chicken broth but used a tablespoon of powdered broth for taste. I also added about a tablespoon of flour to thicken the sauce.To date this is my best roasted chicken recipe and I will make it over & over.

I served this to houseguests, and they thought it was wonderful. My sister, who would ordinarily have skipped the vegetable portion altogether, had helping after helping of these. I would have liked just a little more orange flavor, so next time I will try adding a little reduced OJ like a previous reviewer.

I liked this recipe. A nice change from my usual roast chicken recipes. (Even my 8 year old son tried it and liked it.) The only "tricky" part was deglazing the roasting pan...I can't put my roasting pan on top of the stove and we missed out on all those yummy little brown bits that add flavor to the sauce. My husband preferred it dry.

This was delicious. After reading others' reviews, I made some modifications to this recipe to suit my taste. I added garlic to the shallots to give the chicken more flavor (who can say no to garlic?). I also used Marsala wine instead of the white wine because I think Marsala goes so well with orange. Also, after zesting the orange I cut it in quarters and stuffed it inside the bird for more citrus flavor. Next time I'm going to split the butter mixture in half and use the shallots/garlic in half the mixture. I'll use the orange butter mixture over the chicken without the shallots (as they had a tendency to burn) and use the orange/shallot/garlic/butter mixture under the skin only. I also added some flour to the sauce to thicken. The results were terrific and resulted in a very moist bird.

This was the best roast chicken recipe I've ever tasted. My husband had been the hands down winner of the roast chicken recipes, but I have now assumed that title with this one. The meat is tender and moist. The rosemary-orange butter makes it all very savory and makes the pan juices delicious. One thing that I added to the rosemary-orange butter was some orange juice that I had reduced first.

The chicken turned out wonderful. It was nice and juciy and the butter really complimented the dish. I always make chicken in the oven and never really do alot to it, but this was great.

Don't let the other reviews fool you. This recipe is good, it's not that the chicken lacks flavor, the flavors are just subtle. My pan juices turned out very tasty-the onions carmelized very nicely so the juices were sweet.

I made this last night, and neither I nor my husband cared for it. It had very little flavor and the "sauce" was very greasy and salty. I've had something similar using lemon zest, garlic, rosemary, and white wine...those flavors seem to go better together than the ornage and the shallots. This was a big disappointment. Not to mention, my house still smells like it, 24 hours later...

I made this dish with turkey since I had no specific turkey recipe. The turkey came out juicy and with the liberal seasoning, very tasty. I stuffed the bird with left over apples (peeled) and the orange (minus the peel I used for the butter) and the sauce was sweet. Did not use the wine but did not need it. I will always cook turkey this way. We only had turkey once a year but we may now have it twice, even three times a year! I would suggest thawing your turkey in salt water as well.

The chicken was very juicy, but needed a little more flavor. The gravy was quite greasy and even with garlic mashed potatoes was quite bland. Increasing the amount of rosemary and orange, or adding some garlic may help.

This chicken was perfectly fine.....but nothing special. If I were to make it again, I would use garlic instead of shallots in the butter and generally spruce up the seasonings overall.

This is a wonderful recipe for company. The chicken comes out extremely moist and juicy, and the company raves about the taste. This is a keeper for the recipe box!
