Great recipe with awesome berry flavor. I've experimented with adjusting the amounts & types of berries, never having a bad result.

A really yummy pie...of course, I did use a different lattice-top pie dough recipe but incorporated the pecans and orange zest found that freezing the cut lattice strips makes it quite a bit easier to form the top crust of the pie. I used frozen mixed berries with fresh cranberries and substituted tapioca (ground-up small pearl because I didn't have the instant kind) for the cornstarch. I tossed the frozen berries with about 1/4 c sugar and allowed those to drain for a few hours, reserving the juice to reduce it along with the juice of one of the zested oranges down to a thick syrup that I poured back in with the berry mixture before filling the pie. I tend to cut back on the sugar in pies and so ended up using probably only 3/4 cup of sugar altogether for the filling (note: the syrup ended up being quite sweet from the orange juice, and I did use the full 1/4 cup of marmalade the recipe calls for), but we all still loved the final product!

First, I used a 16 oz. bag of mixed frozen berries and a 12 oz. bag of frozen cranberries, about 6 cups total. I drained them overnight into a bowl on my countertop. I toyed with the idea of reducing the juices to a syrup but decided there was enough liquid in the pie as is. I also did not have marmalade on hand, so I substituted a 1/4 c. honey, minus a tablespoon or so, and mixed it with the balance of OJ. Secondly, I used my own fool-proof pie dough recipe (CI) but used the toasted pecans and orange zest as well. I sprinkled half the pecans/zest on top of the pie dough as I was rolling out the top so it was embedded in the crust. I forgot to add it to my bottom crust as I was rolling it out, so I sprinkled that portion over the berries before adding my top crust. I used a 425 degree oven and baked the pie on the lowest rack on a pre-heated cookie sheet. I protected the crust for 20 minutes and then reduced my oven to 375 degrees and removed the pie crust shield. I baked it for another 50 minutes until my clear glass pie plate showed a nice browned crust when I looked underneath. There was no overflow of juices. The taste is tart but sweet. Very good. I would make it again.

I had excellent experiences with this recipe both times I made it. The second time I cut down on the the berries as shown a little and added blackberries. I had no problems with the crust as others had described. I made cookies out of the excess crust.

Wow. The marmalade makes this. If you forget it, it's just a pie. I haven't bothered making the special crust but it's still delicious with a standard crust..

I really had high hopes for this pie - the crust dough tasted great and the prebaked pie looked so pretty. Then it baked and half of the crust melted off. The pie was also really hard to cut. Presentation was awful. The actual pie tasted really good, but I wouldn't make it again just because of the messy look/complication of getting it out of the pan.

I thought this pie was great and easy to make using frozen berries. To prevent the "bubbling over" problem that others described, I drained the frozen berries in a colander for a few hours while they defrosted . I also agree with cutting down on the allspice. I used my own pie crust recipe, so I can't comment on that.

I make this pie every year for Thanksgiving, and everyone loves it. The crust is great!

Would rate this recipe 2 forks as is, and 3 forks with the following tweaks. I only prepared the filling part of this recipe, and used my own tried-and-true pie crust. The overall taste was wonderful with the addition of the orange marmalade, and zest. I purposefully omitted the allspice because I don't care for it. I did increase the amount of cornstarch by 1T. to counter the excess liquids that frozen berries produce. Even after through draining, the filling still cooked up too loose and had an overwhelming pasty taste to it. I think that adding tapioca to fruit pies is a superior option for next time.

I am about to make this pie for the second time. I used the cream cheese pastry recipe on this site, however, not the one given here. What I loved was the filling--it is really special. I am not a pie lover, so a pie has to be really unique to get my attention. This one was just so delicious and everyone who tried it thought so!

This pie tastes wonderful, but I have to say "like it, don't love it" because it was so hard to make and such a mess to serve and eat. The orange flavors in the crust and filling were what made it so good - the citrus and berry together was wonderful. But I questioned using frozen berries to begin with (it's so tempting because they're so much less expensive than fresh!) and I think that fresh is where it's at. Maybe I needed to drain them overnight or something, but they had just too much liquid. The whole thing was totally soupy. Also, as good tasting as the crust was, it was the stickiest trickiest crust I've ever had to work with, and it was impossible to get a nice-looking lattice.

This is my favorite pie to make! It was a hit at Christmas.

Me and my guests found this pie too sweet.

What a great mix of berries and with the orange peel (I did use a little less than the recipe called for) it is wonderously tasty!! I do use some pastry flour in my crust that makes it especially tender and flavorful. Will definately make again...and again.

This pie won me first place in our Company's Thanksgiving Luncheon bake-off. A word of caution: I found the dough sticky to work with and the amount of allspice a little overwhelming. I suggest cutting it in half.

This is the best berry pie I have ever made! The citrus flavors balance the sweetness of the berries. Great tasting crust.
