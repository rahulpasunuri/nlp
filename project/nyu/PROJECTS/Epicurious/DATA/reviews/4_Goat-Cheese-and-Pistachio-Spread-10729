This was very good. I think next time I will try at least part cream cheese instead of butter to improve the consistency. I served it on baquette slices and added sliced steak to the top which really made it over the top. I think this would be good melted over the top of fish as well.

This is absolutely delicious. Since the recipes makes quite a lot, I used only 1 log of goat cheese and 1/3 stick of butter and cut back on other ingredients proportionately. Would definitely make again and again!

The idea of a stick of butter turned me off although I could tell from the ingredients list how delicious the finished spread might be. So I substituted the butter for Fage 0% fat Greek Yogurt. The consistancy will be softer than the original recipe but just as tasty with less the fat and calories! I also omitted the salt but used salted roasted pistachios.

I cut the salt in half (might leave it out altogether next time). I spread it on crostini with a cranberry relish on top--fabulous!

A great recipe that I have made many times since 1992.

Absolutely amazing. I took the suggestion of using cream cheese instead of butter - perfect. I use more garlic and more pistachios (unsalted), I do not add salt - the goat cheese adds plenty.

I have been making this recipe for about 6 months and get rave reviews and multiple requests for the recipe every time I make it. Just remember to take it out of the fridge about an hour ahead of serving so it softens and it easy to spread.

Easy & delicious for a large party. I usually double the recipe and use any leftovers to stuff inside a chicken breast, which I then bread & bake.

This recipe is absolutely over the top fantastic. I have been making it for years to rave reviews. A tip for those who find it uneasy to spread - I add 4-5 tablespoons heavy cream to the mixture. I serve this in an oversized martini glass and scoop the mixture into the glass with an ice cream scoop. I then add a fringe of flat leaf parsley along the back of the glass by sticking the stems in the mixture. It makes a lovely presentation and is best served with Paris toasts.

I'm obviously in the minority here, but did not find this recipe to be anything special. Somehow it lacked personality. It wasn't bad, just not great.

Delicious! However, disappointed in the consistency once it was chilled. Very crumbly, and hard, even after sitting out for awhile. Made exactly as written. Any suggestions?

I have found it better using 8oz. cream cheese in place of the butter and it is easier to spread.

A real keeper! We bought goat cheese at our local Famers' Market, making this spread an instant favorite. It meets my 3 main requirements - tasty, easy to make,and can be made in advance!

I've been making this since it first appeared in Bon Appetit! Everyone who has this has asked for the recipe. I cut back on the salt, however, and usually add more pistachio nuts. This is a real winner!

Delicious! So easy, yet so good. I make this any time I need a quick appetizer for a party. The flavor and texture are perfect.

Loved it. Very creamy and tasty. I had this at a holiday party with LOTS of food and people seemed confused because they didn't know what it was. Next time I'll put a little sign because people had NO idea what they were missing. I'm bringing this to an appetizer recipe exchange party next week. It's a winner in my book!

This is a great appetizer and very simple. I made a lot of substitutions with what I had in the house. I used some parsley instead of chives, and used two four ounce (120 gram) logs of goat cheese: one was plain, the other herbed. I also only used 1/2 stick of butter. The result, although I'm sure different than the original recipe, is wonderful.
