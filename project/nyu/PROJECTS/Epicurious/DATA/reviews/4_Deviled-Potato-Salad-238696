Very good, with some modifications. I used green onions instead of sweet ones, did a half-half mixture of mayo and sour cream and used several more tablespoons of Dijon mustard. Also added some dried dill and did not use the hard boiled egg. With these changes, everyone raved about it.

I add a clove of fresh garlic (pressed) and a teaspoon of Chipolte Hot Sauce, it makes this dish more flavorful!

AMAZING! Easy too. I added one additional egg. Loved it.

Love this recipe! My boyfriend insists that this be the new go-to potato salad. I made some alterations including adding extra celery and onion, using more mustard (the sweet and sassy variety) and adding celery seed, but the overall recipe was very good as written. Because I used a sweet mustard, the amount of vinegar was fine for me.

Very good simple potato salad. Agree that a little less vinegar is better.

Delicious! I cut the vinegar to 2 tbsp instead of 3.

I used yukon gold, three hb eggs, 5 diced scallions, one small finely diced red pepper, and a little extra mayo as I thought dijon/vinegar (used only 2T) was a little over powering. It is delicious!

Yum! I've been looking for a great traditional potato salad recipe, and this is the best one I've tried in ages. It is better after a few hours or overnight in the fridge. If you use reduced-fat or fat-free mayo, I recommend eliminating the sugar as they are usually sweeter than regular mayo.

I've tried several different potato salad recipes on this site. Most of them are great, but really too fussy for the humble potato salad. This one delivers a nice flavor with minimal fuss. And my husband, who hates most potato salads, loves this one. I've made it several times now and it's always perfect. I don't change a thing to the recipe.

Nice, simple, sweet, clean and pure. I eyeballed the measurements (for gosh sakes it's potato salad) and left out the celery. Also I substituted yukon golds. No problems with consistency and in fact it was delightfully creamy.

Very disappointing. Dressing was too runny, cutting back to 2T vinegar would of helped. I used white boiling potatoes, the dressing just kind of ran off of them. I missed the way russets absorb the dressing. I'll go back to my 1950's Betty Crocker version.

This is the best potato salad recipe! It has a lot of flavor. The small red potatoes cook evenly and quickly and provide a nice color to the salad. I will definitely make this again - a real winner!

Great balance of flavor - I have a fear of too much mayo flavor but this was perfect!

This is a great traditional potato salad recipe. Based on other reviews I cut down the cider vinegar to 2 tbsp. Because I love deviled eggs so much, I reduced the black pepper and added about 1/2 tsp paprika to the mayo mixture. I also substituted green pepper for the celery. Yum!

Excellent potato salad recipe.

Very Tasty. I made this the night before the picnic and let it sit in the fridge overnight for the flavors to meld. Everyone loved it.

When it comes to mayo recipes I like Hellmanns.com. Interestingly enough this recipe is very very close to theirs. A bit higher vinagar and onion ratio in this one.

This is the recipe that I have used for 25 years, sans the vinegar. Make sure the potatoes are the red or waxy sort. I always get raves on my potato salad

This is a good potato salad recipe. There are better ones out there but this is pretty close to a 'typical' version.

This is a nice salad I made it for Memorial day picnic. The cider vinegar gave it a nice tang. Will definetly make again.
