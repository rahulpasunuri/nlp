Amazing! Perfect balance of tart and sweet (I also omitted the zest and ginger). Also replaced half of the rolled oats with steel-cut for more crispiness.

I made this without the ginger or orange zest--as other reviewers said it masked the taste of the rhubarb. I also used almonds for my nuts and splenda for my suger. This was delicious!

I did not use the ginger or the zest of orange or cornstarch. I used almonds instead of pecans. and I added strawberries. I thought this came out delicious!

This recipe is good, but I've made crisps with toppings that have a better texture. I think the egg gives a cakier texture, when I'd prefer it be crispier.

This recipe is a keeper. I made a few changes to the ingredients thanks to the previous review. I cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup, and used lemon rather than orange and also omitted the pecans and ginger.

Although the finished product tasted good, the taste of rhubarb was missing. The orange zest and ginger flavors strongly over powered the fresh spring rhubarb I used. I also substituted 3/4C graham flour for regular white flour.
