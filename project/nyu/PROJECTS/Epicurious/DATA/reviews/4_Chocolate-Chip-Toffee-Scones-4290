Overall, great recipe. I made several changes and it still worked out great. We had to leave out the toffee chips (didn't have them) and the walnuts (Child alergic), still, the family loved them. What is not to love--essentially chocolate chip cookies for breakfast. I think I would have enjoyed it more if I could have used all the ingredients called for.

These were great. Very light and not as dense as most scones. I didn't have whipping cream and used heavy cream which worked just as well. Instead of chocolate chips and toffee bits, I used mini-chocolate chips, dried cherries and walnuts...delicious.

subbed dried blueberries and lemon essence. Raves all around. Tried savoury version with same base and blended parma and rosemary, topped with cornmeal, excellent results. Great with chowder! Cold, wintery nights topped with chowder or bisque served with these will never be the same again!

Oh my gosh! This is one of the best scone recipes I have tried so far! Just made my second batch in less than a week. Entire family gobbled them up so fast! Will attempt subbing chocolate chips, toffee and walnuts for dried blueberries and lemon (husbands fav)

Delicious and easy to make! The recipie made 12 big scones that all of my friends loved. Very easy to make since you don't have to cut in any butter!

I had a cup of cream to use up so I made a half recipe for the toffee-obsessed boyfriend. I used 1/2 cup toffee bits, 1/2 cup chopped chunk dark chocolate and 1/4 cup carmelized cocoa nibs thrown in. I even screwed up and accidentally turned the cream into butter, but I mixed in the dry stuff anyway and in the end it didn't make any difference. Next time I won't even bother to whip the cream. The dough was fairly sticky, and by then it was too hot in the kitchen so I put it in the fridge until I was ready to bake late in the day. These were orgasmic, and made about 8 fairly large domed scones, with a delicate crumb and not too much mixins. Will definitely make again.

Followed the recipe except for subbing chopped almond roca for the walnuts and toffee. These were easy and delicious, much better than the dry scones you can purchase - not that messy - a cross between the mess of yeast dough and a piecrust. Made two 8" rounds and cut into 16.

Everyone loves these. To save time when I make them in the mornings, I mix all the dry ingredients in a bowl or ziploc and set aside and put the mixing bowl for the cream and the beaters in the fridg or freezer.In the morning I quickly whip the cream and continue with the recipe. I, too, shape into two rounds and cut each into 8. They are plenty big. The sticky dough is worth the effort. I follow the recipe to a "T" and have never been disappointed

These were pretty good but I don't quite think 4 stars. It took about 30 minutes before they turned golden brown. I had no problem with the dough--used my Kitchenaid with the dough hook to knead into a ball. Wedges looked great on the pan before I put them in the oven but they did not hold their shape well at all--just blobs when they were done. Seemed a bit dry to me but I just spread on extra butter before eating and that took care of it.

I have to admit I did not follow the recipe exactly as -is. I did not have English toffee bits so I substituted white chocolate chips. I also left out the walnuts as I was making these for a friend and her 4 year old daughter and was unsure if the daughter had a nut allergy. Next time I will make the recipe as-is so I know what I missed by not having the toffee bits! After adding the whipped cream, I did find the dough to be a bit sticky to work with, but I solved that problem by mixing it with my hands. The scones turned out beautifully. They warm up nicely, too. I also made the tangerine and cranberry scones on this site. It was nice to be able to compare a whipped-cream scone to a butter-and-egg scone. I have to say, I liked them both.

I make these scones with blueberries and white chocolate chunks (Starbucks idea but these are WAY better). I get a requests for these for every brunch I host. They are a little bit of work and messy, but totally worth it.

Rating: 4
These are amazing. Halfway through making them I swore I would not make them again because they were so messy. I used a too-small bowl to mix and it overflowed from the top. I ended up just dumping all the ingredients onto a granite surface to incorporate. They turned out wonderfully! They save really well, also. Several days later they are still good after being heated for 15 seconds in the microwave. Highly recommended!

Rating: 4
I love this recipe because I always get really moist scones. I like the moist dense ones rather than the bready kind. I left out all the chocolate and toffee stuff and made it with just currents and another batch with just ginger. It comes out moist and delicious every time. And... actually 2 cups of whip cream is less calories than the amount of butter that some recipes call for.

Rating: 3
My dough ended up too wet to roll out. I ended up dropping spoonfuls onto a cookie sheet lines with parchment paper and sprayed with cooking spray (I hate buttering pans!). My guess is that I didn't whip the cream long enough. They still taste great, though! Even if they're not right out of the oven, microwave them for a few seconds, and they're yummy!

Rating: 4
I made two half batches, one without whipping the cream and one with whipping the cream as stated in the recipe. The scones made without whipping the cream first were definitely flatter and spread out wider than the batch made with the whipped cream. I think it is worth taking the extra couple of minutes to whip the cream. I made 2 rounds which each cut into 8 scones which were still pretty big so next time I will try using my round cutter to make the traditional oven scone shapes from Scotland. I had no problems with the dough with either batch. I left out the nuts for the kids and they loved them.

This is the most delicious scone with chocolate and toffee that just oozes when eaten warm! This is often requested by friends and family!

For those looking for a way to lighten this recipe, I've had good success with using 1 cup whipping cream and then gradually adding skim milk to the dough until it comes together (usually about 3/4 cup). Skip the butter glaze and instead glaze with skim milk. And if I make a whole batch, I made two dough rounds and cut each into 8 scones. I've tried using all skim milk, but in my opinion the texture and taste really suffer.

i love to make scones and am so glad that i found this recipe. made it for the first time to take to an event and got RAVE reviews! followed reviewers who said to reduce the baking powder to 1T, 1/4t., upped the toffee bits to 1 cup, used regular toffee bits rather than choc covered (which i think would have been serious overkill). didn't have 2 full cups of whipping cream so used about 1/2 cup of 1/2 & 1/2 to make up the difference. whipped that all up but not to hard peaks. dumped all of the dry ingredients into my kitchenaid bowl, whipped the cream with my hand blender, folded together, then used the bread hook to knead the dough. dough was pretty sticky but using enough flour on the counter and hands proved sufficient. made 2 balls/disks and cut each into 8 wedges. didn't even bother with the butter and extra sugar and they were over the top! will be using the basic dough to make other variations -- apricot, rum raisin, etc.

Rating: 3
The previous reviewers were right that these are easy and absolutely delicious. I cut the baking powder and didn't whip the cream like suggested and got light, fluffy scones. I had trouble, though, with kneading, shaping, and cutting the dough; it was incredibly soft, sticky, and hard to work with. My advice is, after folding in the cream, just mix it gently in the bowl with a wooden spoon and then drop heaping tablespoonfuls of the dough onto parchment-lined baking sheets. Seventeen minutes was a perfect baking time, I found, and they slid right off the parchment perfectly. They aren't perfect wedges this way, but I yielded about 30 scones that were 2 to 3 inches in diameter; I can't imagine wanting them bigger, and they'll feed more people that way. Will definitely make again (and would bump up to 1 c. of toffee).

Rating: 4
I'm always looking to cut calories and fat so made these with skim milk rather than cream. The dough was a pain and I ended up with wonderful biscuits. The next time I used single serving greased and floured heart shaped pans and my daughters were thrilled. I'm sure that they are that much better with the cream but if you want to lighten up the recipe, I recommend using skim milk and forgoing the traditional scone shape. Just wonderful!

Rating: 3
The moisture and lightness of this scone is unlike anything I've experienced before with scones. For those who are expecting a more dense, buttery, flaky crumb, you might want to keep on looking, but I would still recommend this recipe. They're basically miniature, creamy, light cakes! MMMM. I might add peanut butter chips next time.

I served this for brunch and everyone was delighted. The lemon cream scones on this site are also delicious and I often substitute other flavors for the lemon peel.

I agree with the previous reviewer. Probably the best scone recipe I've ever tried. My fiancee is a scone fanatic and these are by far his favorite. Will make it over and over again!

So yummy! I was intrigued by the fact that this scone recipe didn't use butter but whipping cream instead. Fresh out of the oven, the toffee bits were chewy and the scone was very moist. Scones were still good after 2 days and although the texture changed (became a bit more crumbly and dry), they were still outstanding! Probably the best scone recipe I've tried!

Honestly i thought these were very bland. Though my mother and her friends enjoyed them. They may have tasted better if the oven hadn't been smokey.

This were absolutely delicious!! I'm printing out copies of the recipe for my guests now. I increased the toffee bits to 1 cup and added milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet. I also cut into much smaller wedges, as the scones expand while baking.

Delicious, a little tough to keep together in the assembly, but I had read previous reviews and knew that I should not add more liquid. My family loved them and finished the first batch Christmas Day; I made another the next day. A couple additions, I added toasted pecans and made an espresso glaze, which I drizzled on top.

Probably the best scones I have ever baked, or for that matter, ever eaten. The chocolate chips (I used Hershey's Dark Chocolate Chips because I was out of semi-sweet chips; tasted rich and wonderful!) and chocolate-covered English Toffee Bits (Hershey's makes a product called Heath Milk Chocolate English Toffee Bits- - can be found in the baking chips section of most supermarkets) just "ooze" when you take your first bite into the scone. So if you really want to experience these scones at their very best, eat them when they're still just a touch warm. Otherwise, they are still terrific once they have cooled, and I think even better the next day. So very decadent with a good cup of coffee or tea, or a big glass of milk.

I've been eating these scones for the last 4 years at the restaurant where they are made in Ann Arbor, MI. They are unbelievable! No other scone recipe compares.

I followed the recipe exactly and did not get an overpowering baking powder taste. I used fresh, non-alumninum powder and the scones were light and fluffy. I used Enstrom's toffee and it put this recipe over the edge. It's a fabulous recipe but is more like a dessert. Very indulgent. My kids wanted leftovers again and again.

A very good recipe that my husband gave 2 thumbs up to. I also used only 1 tb + 1/4 tsp baking powder and regular toffee chips (didn't have chocolate covered ones). I made them the night before and they were just as good, if not better, the next morning. They were gone before I could finish saying, "They're Chocolate Chip-Toffee Scones!"

I thought these were great, and so did the mother's who received them as mother's day gifts. I followed some of the previous suggestions, using less baking powder (1T,1/4tsp), not whipping the cream, and a full cup of toffee. They were absolutely wonderful, with a nice, light crumb. I plan on using this basic recipe soon to make these with fresh raspberries or strawberries.

Read all the reviews before making these and I found that the tip about less baking powder worked. I used white chocolate chunks and english toffee bars broken up - Absolutely will make again, will have to as I have eaten most of them myself!

Light and scrumptious -- Everyone adores these scones and they are super easy to make. Try adding more toffee bits - I do almost a cup. I don't whip the cream at all -- just pour it straight into the dry ingredients and fold in. I make 2 rounds instead of one and cut each into 8 pieces, like another reviewer -- they are still fairly large. Increasing the temp to 385 makes the 20 min baking time perfect. They shouldn't be too golden brown, just a hint. Also, using parchment paper removes the need to butter the cookie sheets & cuts down on cleanup.

Rating: 3
I liked this recipe a lot. I did have to adjust the baking powder amount, the first batch was too soda-y. I changed it to 1T and 1/4 tsp. Also, have tried it with toffee baking bits and it worked. I suggest milk chips or a semi/milk mix. Straight semi was a little bitter with the toffee. They freeze great too. Enjoy!

Very delicious. I actually tried the recipe with Hazelnut creamer (coffeemate) in place of the whipping cream and I think that did it for me.

I was disappointed with this recipe. The texture was tender, but in the main it tasted like a baking powder biscuit with fattening tidbits thrown in. You could taste the baking powder, and it really needed plenty of vanilla or other flavoring to give it a boost. Also, it took something like 30-35 min. to bake to a golden brown. I love baking scones but this would be low on my favorites list.

Rating: 3
More like 2.7. Not sure why but these never got 'golden brown'--they were still pale and sickly looking after 20 minutes, but they were definitely done. Very good texture, between a muffin and a cookie, and quite sweet; I guess you can tell from the title this is a dessert not breakfast. I would use this again as a base recipe but with less-sweet add-ins, or at least add some brown sugar or vanilla. I though the taste was a little flat. They were very quick and easy and I liked that it didn't call for eggs.

This is an easy and excellent scone recipe. I use mini morsels choc chips (3/4)cup and increase the toffee to (2/3) cup because I am not a big chocolate fan. And I use pecans instead of walnuts. Everyone loves them! If you don't need all the scones at once, store the dough on a cellophane wrapped cookie sheet for a few days and after brushing with butter and sugar pop them in the oven--they don't dry out.

I get nothing but rave reviews when I make these scones!!! Bakers beware: unless you grab one right away, they will disappear faster than you can say chocolate chip-toffee scone. I have even left the toffee out, and they were amazing. From a baker's point of view, I thought the recipe was perfect. They turn out beautifully every time.

These scones were incredibly rich...the guests at my tea really liked them.
