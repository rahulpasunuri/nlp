I made this exactly as written, it isn't necessarily bad...but i'm on my way to the market to buy some olives and ? something to give it some flavor.

Great salad. Served for a party and everyone loved it. LIght, healthy and flavorful. I don't think I initially added enough b. vinegar but once tuned, it was fab. Easy to make!

Fantastic way to use up that last bit of produce and avoid leftovers.Don't skip the pine nuts!

Why just make one serving? Make more for leftovers, even if it's just for you! This was very light, yet satisfying. Pine nuts are NOT optional. They really make the dish. I did add chopped kalamata olives though, since it seemed to need a little something to 'brighten' the flavors. Will definitely make again.

I have quadrupled this recipe and made it many times for BBQ's and it has always been met with RAVE reviews. It is just a winner.

I'm suprised at all of the good reviews of this. I found it to be very bland.

This recipe is good--I'm definitely making it again--but I felt it was a sort of plain at first, so I added some kalamata olives and mozzarella. Tasty.

This salad is fantastic! Light easy and delicious. Pine nuts are essential for that something extra.

I doubled this easily and made it for a quick dinner that neither of us could get enough of! This is delicious, simple, and healthy, I can't think of a better combination for any meal! I had thought about adding some freshly grated Parmesan, but found that this recipe needed absolutely no changes!

A nice change from the orzo with tomatoes and feta. If you love arugula like I do, don't miss this one. I think it needs the pine nuts so don't leave them out.

I added red onion and feta cheese -- it was delicious. This recipe only makes enough for one person though so you may need to double or triple it!

This was a perfect summer side dish. Light, refreshing, and definitely recommended.

Easy to make, very good flavor-the pine nuts are a wonderful touch.

Wow what a dish, and so easy. I followed it almost to a T--just added more pine nuts. I love them.

Very simple, easy, and good recipe. I liked the mix of textures. The flavors scared me a little before putting it all together, but they do complement each other well -- making for a different and unique tasting side dish. My husband doesn't like arugula but loved this salad. I also added a dash of sugar to the oil & vinegar before mixing with orzo. I made this along with a roast chicken, but it really would be great at room temperature next to summer/barbeque foods.

It is a wonderful dish, especially in the summer. The flavors are layered and very interseting. It is a good compliment to many other dishes, particularly grilled. I have made this several times, and guests always ask for the recipe.

I made this dish to accompany grilled chicken w/stuffed with ham and Saga cheese. A good compliment to the main course but a little on the bland side . .. next time I might add a TBSP of pesto to give it some kick . . .

Ok, this is one tasty dish. Licked it up the next day. Room temp is important. Adding Feta next time but certainly tasty without. I agree with Vancouver - easy to multiply for bigger crowd. Appealing and 'pretty' dish to serve (is that corny?) Make it wow your friends.

Thought this recipe was fabulous! Made it for the rest of the summer...for just the two of us or for a crowd. It was easy to multiply the servings, just added the ingredients to taste.

I thought this was a great side dish, and I'd give it 4 forks, except that I changed it around & substituted sundried tomatoes (b/c fresh weren't very good). For 8 people, I used 4 1/2 c of cooked orzo, mixed with 2 T of olive oil and 4 T of balsamic vinegar, nearly an entire bunch of arugula, and a bunch of basil, and some salt and pepper, and a package (3.5oz) of sundried tomatoes, soaked in nearly boiling water. Quite super, I thought, and I'd definitely make it again.

Easy and Delicious! Everyone that I have served this to has requested the recipe. The first time I made it, I made it for 16 and I have always estimated the amounts since I have made it for more than one.

Excellent as a warm salad and even better the next day. The hard part was multiplying the servings to get 8! This will be a staple for my tomato and vegetable garden bounty.

I thought this recipe was to conspicuously healthy. I doubled it and served it with grilled steak and grilled corn-on-the-cob, and it was the only mediocre part of the dinner. Making a big salad would be a better use of the arugula and tomato.

Easy, delicious, unusual. Will definitely make this again. I didn't have pine nuts and I couldn't find fresh arugula -- substituted parsley -- and it was just great.

Great dish! We fixed it as a side dish to garlic & chili rubbed flank steaks. We weren't able to get arugula at the local grocery by our lake cottage, so we substituted spinach. The recipe serves one and we were multiplying the receipe to serve 7. Just as good the next day!
