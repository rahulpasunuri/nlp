Great summer easy desser. I used dried wild blueberries and soaked them in Kirsch for that extra touch.

I used frozen pie crust (what I had on hand) and the recipe made 8 2" x 4" hand pies plus extra filling. These were delicious and a big hit with my husband.

The Dafour pastry is wonderful, but it has to be stretched to its absolute limit to yield 9 pies. Based on the reviews, I threw in about a 1/4 cup more cherries and ended up with some left over filling. There seemed to be enough filling if you use a 1/4 c measure to scoop it making sure to stay just under the rim. Four forks for the filling alone over ice cream: a beautiful, delicious and time efficient dinner party dessert!

I love this recipe, so easy & good. I add a splash of Kirsch, brings the taste level up. I also use Wegman's puff pastry; it IS better than Pepperidge Farm.

Excellent! The filling was the perfect balance of sweet and tart. Used Pepperidge Farms puff pastry and rolled each sheet out just a bit & cut into fourths for a total of 8 pies. Filling was enough for only 6.

I made this but made a couple of changes. First off I couldn't get the recommended brand of pastry dough so I used Pepperidge Farms. This posed a problem in that the dough was not large enough to make the indicated 9 pies. I ended up with four large pies and 4 mini pies. Also I thought the flavor was good but I added a dash of Jack Daniels to give it some depth. They were completely done if not a little done by 30 minutes. 25 would have been more accurate. I thought they tasted great, but would make my own pastry dough next time.

Very easy and fun to make, I really liked them but was not blown away (thus the 3 stars). I would make them again though.

These were a huge hit with my family. I used the Dufour pastry, which gave the finished recipe a wonderful buttery taste. Would love to try it with blueberries.

I've made blueberry hand pies, apple hand pies and of course the original cherry. I rarely have the opportunity to eat them because they fly off the plate! They're a keeper!

I added dried cranberries instead of dried cherries and added a bit of lemon juice and lemon zet for a bit of tartnes! I should have made more! It's wonderful.

The pies are so easy to make and absolutely delish. Made them twice for guests using Pepperidge Puff Pastry sheets. The second time I made the mistake of adding more dried cherries than stated. It made the filling too dry and chewy. I froze the extras without the egg wash and sugar.

Easy and awesome!

I used Pepperidge Farm puff pastry and adjusted the size accordingly. These are really good, especially warm! Some of the flavor is lost when they are served at room temperature.

I really hate the aftertaste of cornstarch in a pastry. I used ground tapioca for a more neutral taste. I also plumped the dried cherries in Amaretto to compensate for the water in the cornstarch. A very good recipe for those summer cookouts.

Excellent, fast, and easy if you use the Dufour and a big jar of pitted tart pie cherries packed in water, drained (both at Whole Foods). I made six extremely generous pies. If you have quality jarred cherries available, there is no reason to pit or make these only in season; they can be made year-round (think hot cherry handpies on a cold winter's day!).

These hand pies are yummy and are great to prep in advance for a party...but no way the active time is 25 minutes...at least not the first time. It took me that long to pit and cook the cherries, then I still had to make all the individual pies. I'll do it again, though.

I used almond extract instead of vanilla, but otherwise followed the recipe. Would try again with regular pie crust.

The filling is good... quite good. Not the most exceptional cherry pie filling I've ever made, but good. But the puff pastry crust... very disappointing. Perhaps if we'd eaten them right out of the oven... they would have been better. But I found that the crust just got sort of tough. My regular homemade pie crust would have been a lot better. These sound better in theory than they tasted in actuality.

Made our own crust using Melissa Clark's recipe in In the Kitceh with a Good Appetite- the filling was delicious! Highly recommend and so easy, even with making your own crust. The doulble crust recipe gave us 8 pies.

This is a great and easy recipe, especially for those who have trouble making crust like me.

If you are a cherry lover, this is such a treat. This is the first time that I baked with fresh cherries and it was well worth the effort. The puff pastry was very easy to work with. I followed all the directions according to the recipe and my hand pies looked great.

Very yummy! A huge hit at the 4th of July party this year! Made with my own puff pastry. Agree that this doesn't quite make enough filling. My last two were slim on filling.

These are the three little words every guy that loves food longs to hear: CHERRY HAND PIES! Awesome. These were a huge hit at our 4th of July cookout.

Wonderful and much easier w/ Puff pastry than Phyllo like most recipes call for. I couldn't find the Dafour, so used Pepperidge Farm and slightly rolled out. Could cut into 4/sheet w/ a half leftover per sheet of pastry. ended up making 9 total, but ran out of filling and made the last two (1 full and 2 halfs) w/ nutella...kids loved those. Husband and I really enjoyed the cherry! Cooked faster than expected and should of used my airbake pans because the bottoms were a bit dark. I will make again.

Agree, these are delicious. I used regular puff pastry, the Dafour was $13 a sheet ( you need 2!). There was a bit of trimming to get the sheets to come out the right size and I only came up with 8 pies. Somehow that's all the filling I had anyway The first sheet I rolled to the indicated size. The second one I didn't roll out. Both methods were excellent. If you can spring for the expensive stuff I can imagine these would be absolutely killer.

This dessert is out of this world. The combo of dried and fresh cherries is wonderful. As soon as I saw this recipe, I too knew that I had to make it. These individual pies are almost too good!

As soon as I saw these I knew I had to make them for an evening picnic at a local winery. So easy, so delicious. Made them a 2nd time with peaches. YUM!
