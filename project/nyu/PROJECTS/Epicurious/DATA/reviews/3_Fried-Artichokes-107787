I came across a pack of ten baby artichokes for $4.00 at a national grocery. Followed the recipe and served with lemon/garlic mayo for an incredibly awesome dish. It did involved some effort but well worth it. I have printed the recipe and will archive it for many future uses.

I loved this dish! I fried in ex-virgin olive oil and used a candy thermometer for temps. I sprinkled with freshly grated romano instead of salt and they were a huge hit! They are a lot of trouble, however.I also snipped the tips of the outer remaining leaves because they're usually stringy. They were tender you could eat the whole thing.

I love artichokes, so I was intrigued by this recipe. I bought fresh baby artichokes and followed the directions to a T. Afterward I couldn't find any part of the artichoke which seemed edible.

Great recipe, but I couldn't bring myself to discard all the yummy parts of the Artichoke!!! I steamed the 'discard' pieces of artichoke, and served them on a large platter, with the Fried artichoke and traditional 'lemon-garlic mayonnaise' dipping sauce in the center. Mmm! Artichoke Menage a Deux!
