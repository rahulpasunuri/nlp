There are so many different recipes for Carne Asada and most are great, but if you don't grill the meat over a mesquite or other hard wood charcoal, you are wasting your time. Just make hamburgers, and their better over a hardwood fire too! Jeff

The WORST recipe I've ever cooked off this site! Tasteless, tasteless, tasteless, tasteless meat. There is NO way you can char a chile in just five minutes. Perhaps five minutes each side! Total waste of ingredients.

A quick, satisfying meal. Works equally well on the grill or in a pan. The green onions are really good. We also add avacado and tomato - maybe not "authentic", I don't really know, but yummy.

Yummers. I recommend letting the garlic and seasoning sit on the steak for a good half hour to tenderize the meat, but otherwise this is perfection. I also swapped the poblanos for jalapenos for a little extra heat. And it's low carb for people looking to lose weight (unless you accompany it with a lager like I did).

Love it just the way it was written, ran out of the onions first. To warm the tortillas I "grill" them over the flame on my stovetop.

This recipe was delicous. After reading the other posts, I omitted the onions and grilled some pineapple instead which was an amazing addition! I used shaved angus sirloin and served with sour cream. I will definitely be making this again.

This was a great recipe that I would definetely make again. Really easy to do on the grill outside or a grill pan inside. I agree that the onions could be omitted - I served with salsa, avo, sour cream and cheese.

When I first reviewed this recipe I liked it a lot but didn't yet realize that it was to become a part of our standard repertoire. It's incredibly easy, it doesn't mess up your kitchen, and it's delicious. We no longer bother with the onions, and it's true that grilling the tortillas doesn't work all that well. The grilled poblanos are amazing, though, and we always eat all of them. I would definitely suggest that you try this.

My boyfriend and I thought that this was delicious. I used extra garlic and thought it was yummy. We think that next time we'll use a meat tenderizing technique learned from Cook's Illustrated (for London Broil in their case)--coat the meat with kosher salt and let it sit in the fridge for at least 4 hours. It also adds a nice flavor. I would highly recommend this recipe for the nights when you're in the mood for fajitas and want something simple, easy and authentic.

This is good. The salsa is the better part of the recipe since there is not much to the meat prep. Way too many poblanos and the grilled onions are just okay for this recipe. Also, grilling the tortillas made them too crisp and hard to fold. I served with refried beans and Spanish rice.

Maybe 2 1/2 forks. It's adequate, nothing special, thoug I'd make it again. I find poblano chiles too picante for such use, and recommend Anaheim instead. The Salsa Mexicana is very, very good.

i upgraded to new york strip steak - and sauted the veggies and steak rather than grilling. this was delicious - fresh, flavorful and just spicy enough. i will replace my steak fajita recipe with this one...and i will likely make the 'mexican salsa' instead of purchased from now on!

This was ok, but nothing special. Skirt steak needs to marinate in some acid to tenderize it - next time I'll marinate in lime juice & garlic for 30 minutes before grilling.

Simple and delicious -- a great recipe to have in your repertoire. Wouldn't change a thing except use less poblanos as I had loads leftover.

Delicious and simple. I served this with a number of side dishes (beans, rice, cheese, avocado, lettuce, etc) which seemed to stretch the dish a bit beyond 6 - 8 servings and left me lots of steak and peppers left over. The Salsa Mexicana recipe also makes quite a lot. Another note: peeling and seeding the peppers was time consuming for me, which made timing the steak a bit tricky. Have an assistant on hand for that step!

This was amazing and easy. I had the butcher slice the meat for me and just barbecued the strips. And I used green peppers because I couldn't find Poblanos. I would definitely make this again.
