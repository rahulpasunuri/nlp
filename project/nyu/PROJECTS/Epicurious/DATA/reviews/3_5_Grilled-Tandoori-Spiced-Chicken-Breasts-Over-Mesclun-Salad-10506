ended up baking this dish because it was chilly outside and we didn't have but a few hours to marinade. it turned out really well, only mushier than if grilled. but hey, indian food is usually pretty mushy anyway, right?

I haven't made this, but wanted to add suggestions for those who found this lacking in flavor. I have used another Tandoori recipe with good results that includes 1 teaspoon garam masala and 1/2 tsp chili powder. I don't think the recipe would taste like a Tandoori without these. Of course Tandoori should be flavorful, but not particularly hot, so you shouldn't expect that. If you want heat, go Vindaloo.

tried it twice- once, whole chicken breast and the second time, chicken breast cubed; not very flavourful considering all the ingredients

Very flavorful - will make again. Substitued the lettuce (husband on restricted diet and unable to each lettuce)with a garbanzo bean salad flavored with Moroccan spices and Pita Bread.

Simple dish to make. It's nice on a hot day. The chicken was very moist, but flavors were not that impressive. I'd probably make it again

Wow! What a taste sensation! I don't remember tandoori chicken as being this spicy and good. I used skinless chicken parts, doubled the cayenne ( per one reviewer's suggestion), and substituted garam masala for half of the cumin and cinnamon and mixed spices. I think I used 1 t. garam masala since I couldn't decide whether to make this recipe or another Chicken Tandoori on this site. The latter calls for garam masala. This ranks right up there with Jamaican Jerk Burgers for favorite grill recipes.

This was a great receipe - really yummy chicken - I didn't have access to a grill so I cooked it in grapeseed oil in a pan. I would suggest cutting it into smaller pieces ahead of time rather than after. It also went great with braised lentils receipe on this site

Excellent flavors! The chicken came out moist and tender (practically fell apart on the grill!). Marinated a little longer than called for to get a stronger flavor and more tender texture. All seven dinner guests loved it!

I tried this recipe twice. First, I followed the recipe exactly. I found it to be very flavourful. However, I thought it could be spicier (i.e. hotter). I grilled my chicken on the George Foreman grill and it came out so tender and juicy! I used the chicken on a fresh salad, on a pita sandwich, and in a stir-fry. For my second attempt at the recipe, I made a few alterations. I doubled the amount of cayenne pepper. Instead of making grilled chicken with the marinated chicken, I made a chicken curry. I sauted onions, mustard seeds, and fennel seeds. I added the marinated chicken and some finely chopped tomatoes. It was fabulous!

I just love this recipe. It is simple, yet yummy. I didnt even marinate overnight, as I had forgotten to do that one step. My chicken breasts probably marinated about eight hours. My grill was out of gas, I was informed by my husband, so I ended up having to pull out my George Foreman grill. With all of these setbacks, this still gets three forks from me. Everyone loved it!

I marinated my chicken for 2 days, but it didn't seem to pick up much flavour. The marinade was good and spicy, but it didn't really permeate the meat. I'd like to try this again. Maybe I should make slits in the meat before marinating?

The marinade can be reduced over the stove until desired consistency for a sauce or for basting at the last minute.

The recipe is great...especially when you feel like trying your own hand at the stuff you can find at the Indian restraunt down the road. The Tandoori I'm familiar with is usually bright red; apparently, there is Tandoori dye that is available from Indian market that can achieve this color. I substituted about 1.5 Tbl. Paprika (a tip I got elsewhere on the net) but the color still fell short.

Wow is this good! Now, please don't scream; I did make a substitution! I had no plain yogurt in the house (odd for us!), and used apricot/mango with ginger instead! It was wonderful (Horizon Organics makes this, and it's not too sweet). I also used lime juice in place of lemon. I put the whole thing in a ziploc, and left it all day. What a wonderful flavor! Even the kids asked for seconds. I served it with the pineapple apricot salsa (on this site, but I subbed mango jam), and a wild rice salad. With some warm naan, it was a great meal. This will definitely be a frequent addition to our dinner table. (Would make great skewers)

Loved the chicken- only marinated it for 2 and 1/2 hours and it was tender and delicious! I added a little bit of crushed red pepper flakes, too.

Very easy. The kids ate it! I will bring this one camping. I think some chopped red peppers to the salad would be a nice touch.

superb. i let this marinate for 3 days. bordering on unsafe, but i couldn't resist the thought of the most succulent yogurt-marinated chicken. what a payoff. i'd seriously suggest grilling over open flame if at all possible; try to avoid the broiler. but make sure you oil the rack properly. the chicken is very delicate and it will tear. i'll bet seasoned charcoal would be an interesting twist. can anyone think of a way to use the marinate for something? i hated to throw it out.

I really took liberty with this recipe because I could tell it was good. I made it as an appetizer. I also grilled the day ahead. I cut the ckicken into thin strips before marinating. Then I threaded onto 8" bamboo skewers, and grilled. I did this the night ahead and covered tightly with foil in an oven proof pan. I reheated in the oven for 20 minutes until warm. Served warm or room temp is delicious. any questions e-mail me.

This was very easy to make. I had all the ingredients on hand and it was a snap. I marinated for about 3 1/2 hrs. and then grilled skewers with green and red bell peppers, red onion, cherry tomatoes and mushrooms and it was delicious over a wild/brown rice pilaf. Just the right amount of spiciness so that my young son could eat it as well. This is a keeper in this house!

Excellent flavor. Chicken very fragrant and mellow. I marinated chicken for less than 4 hours, cut slits into the boneless breast meat, and came away with succulent, well-seasoned grilled gems! For extra KICK, I finely chopped three chili peppers and added it to the marinade. Served it over coconut-pepper rice and a side dish made from potatoes and chick peas (subtle sweetness of the coconut a good balance to the zesty chicken). My boyfriend's culinarily discerning Indian co-workers were very impressed!

My husband and I thought the recipe was kind of bland. I marinated the chicken for about 24 hours, and yet it didn't seem like the chicken got much more flavor to it..just a hint. It wasn't spicy either, which is what I was looking for.

This had a wonderful flavor. I didn't have time to marinate the chicken the night before so I cut it into 1 inch chunks, marinated them for 4 hours then stuck them onto skewers and put them under the broiler. I'll be making this one again.

Made this recently for a dinner party and it went over very well. It has a nice grilled flavour and goes well with the salad as a whole meal. It wasn't very spicy but you could easily adjust to taste. A definite keeper for the grill!

This is a great weeknight meal! Instead of the salad, I served the chicken on Near East's Toasted Almond Pilaf. The pilaf provided a wonderful additional flavor and offered interesting texture. The meal went very well with a California Syrah.

This is the second time making the dish and we just love it. It is very, very easy. Can marinate the same day and still tastes great. Grilled on an indoor pan and tasted just as good.

It's pretty tough to get 4 forks from me, but this recipe is flavor beyond compare and is so easy to prepare.Tip:Serve the salad on the side and use your own salad dressing.

Excellent dish, althought I used a bed of rice instead of greens.

Our friend Michael (who can't cook at all) prepared this dish in record time, forgetting to marinate it overnight. It was delicious and he was so proud of himself. Definitely a must-do for company, and perfect for grilling over hot coals.

I used 1/2 teaspoon Garam Masala spices, instead of the 1/8 teaspoons of the mixed spices, was delicious!

This recipe is delicious. Even my husband, who hates Indian food,really enjoyed the flavor of the chicken combined with the greens. The vinaigrette seemed slightly too heavy for the delicate greens--next time I will use less of it. I did notice that the leftover chicken tasted MUCH spicier the next day.

I used the broiler because I don't have an indoor grill. It was great. It didn't dry out and was very flavorful. I will make this one again
