This isn't that amazing of a recipe BUT the rating was so low that I wanted to raise it, since I'm very glad I found this recipe and I normally wouldn't consider one with only 2 forks. We get a lot of carrot & celery in our CSA box and the family doesn't really like either; however, this made both not only edible but delicious! My kids SCARFED the tofu - granted, I did not buy it pre-made but found a recipe to make my own baked 5 spice tofu (easy - just google - there's a million options). I was skeptical that the celery/carrot would get cooked but they did cook up beautifully. We subbed green beans for the preserved vegetable (what is that?) and they could have used more cooking time, but the veg it called for worked fine. Definitely will make again!! Just be sure to make your own baked tofu.

This was delicious! I made a lower fat version by using cooking spray with 1 tsp of olive oil and reduced the sesame oil to 1 tsp. I couldn't find the szechuan vegetables so instead used La Choy chop suey mix in a can. I also added 5 spice powder as I did not know where to find the savory baked tofu cakes referenced. Very tasty!
