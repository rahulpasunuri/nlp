This cake is great and I have made it several times using the note for crystallised ginger as that is very easy to find. My only suggestion is that it would be better with a ginger or line syrup icing. I haven't found the perfect one. Thankfully I have very willing guinea pigs on that quest.

Fantastic cake recipe. Made the loaf, didn't last the day. I used the corn syrup and glace ginger...Wouldn't change a thing.

I only had fresh ginger on hand so found this preparation worked well: put 3 cups of water and 3 cups of sugar in a pan and bring to a boil. Once the sugar dissolves add a generous cup of peeled, slivered ginger. Simmer for 45 minutes. Set aside ginger to be used in the recipe. Boiled down the syrup for another 45 minutes for some AMAZING ginger syrup (great in tea). This cake is delicious, especially served with whipped cream and toasted, sliced almonds on top, but doesn't rise to exceptional as none of my friends asked for the recipe!

Lovely and moist cake, bursting with sweet ginger flavour. For those outside the states, 2 sticks of butter is 225g.

I'm addicted to Starbucks gingerbread loaf with cream cheese icing. Can anyone tell me if this recipe is close to it? Or suggest another?

An excellent cake. I used the crystalized ginger. The flavor far exceeded my expectations!

Wonderful! Didn't have all ingredients on hand so used crystalized ginger mixed with chopped fresh ginger, one stick butter and one-half cup canola oil, and dark corn syrup instead of light. It worked just fine, although when beating the butter and oil, it looked more curdled than fluffy! Obviously not a problem with the final results.

Have made this cake a half dozen times. First couple times w/amount of ginger listed in recipe; there after with extra chopped ginger and the corn syrup. I've also made it with chopped Trader Joe's "uncrystallized" ginger - this makes a spicier cake.

This cake is SO GOOD. It appeals to people who don't like overly sweet cake; the chunks of ginger are pleasantly spicy. It's still a bit sweet, of course. People who love ginger will go wild. Others will come to love ginger because of this cake. Those who really hate ginger should really stay away! I've only made the cake with crystallized ginger (because my husband eats crystallized ginger as a snack, so we usually have some in the house). I also go over the 7.5 oz without really affecting the flavor or texture. If the stem ginger is better, I'm not sure the cake would be legal in the states. :) I have made the 3 mini-loaves twice now, and the one big loaf once. I like crusts, so I prefer to make the mini-loaves. They're fun to share, and have gone over with my friends and coworkers very well.
