I first made this recipe, along with the accompanying recipe for pickled cauliflower, for Thanksgiving 1985 when the recipe was first published. It has become part of our family tradition and has been passed on to our children, nieces, nephews, and whoever asks for it. I've tinkered with the proportions over the years to fit with whatever the current food trend is (less sugar, more dill, etc.) but the original recipe is the tried and true I always return to. Easy, delicious, and a refreshing counterpoint to the rich Thanksgiving meal.

I took this recipe in a different direction. Instead of dill seeds I used cumin seeds and a fresh Chinese red chili pepper. My first pickling project, but was surprisingly easy.

great, simple recipe! I did half carrot sticks, half kohlrabi sticks and they're both very tasty. Played around with the added seasonings too - mustard seed and black peppercorns as I had no dill seed on hand. Looking forward to trying other variations!

To those who aren't blanching the carrots first - please be sure and use these quite quickly. Without blanching the enzymes present in the carrots will continue to develop and will cause much quicker spoilage. Blanching allows them to last much, much longer.

Liked these for a different and healthy snack. But I don't understand why to blanch the carrots at all - to preserve maximum crunchiness, I just poured the boiled brine over the raw carrot sticks in a bowl. Also I wonder if rice vinegar would provide a more delicate flavor that I think I would prefer. I know you need the more acidic 5% vinegar for pickling when canning, but if I am just keeping these in the fridge for a few weeks I don't think the type of vinegar should matter, right?

Amazingly good. I made these last year and about to start this year's batch. Didn't have any apple cider vinegar so I used some apple juice with plain vinegar. Also, as the jar got low, I just kept adding carrots and it lasted all summer. Grandkids loved them. I did not peel the carrots since I get fresh organic at the curb market.

I'm sorry, but . . . I thought these were so awful they were inedible! Something about the mix of spices? There's nothing here that isn't usually part of a classic pickling recipe, but I thought it went terrible with the carrots. First recipe from Epicurious I've ever panned . . . Oh, well.

Addictive! A big hit at Thanksgiving pre-dinner. I made them Tuesday night before Thanksgiving to give them time to pickle. As one reviewer suggested, I did not blanch the carrots but rather added them to the boiling pickling liquid for one minute, which worked just fine and was much simpler. I also added some radishes to the pickling liquid, and they were delicious as well, even though they lost their bright pink color. I will definitely make this again and again!

Maybe this is a silly Q but... do you peel the carrots? The author does not say.

Delicious and healthy snack. I didn't have any dill, so I used fennel seed, celery seed, and a small bunch of parsley which I added after boiling.

I've never pickled anything before, but these are easy and yummy! I used cauliflower and celery in addition to the carrots.

I made this for a picnic and everyone loved them. I was asked for the recipe by the people that were there

Awesome! To spice things up and make them more like the traditional mexican style pickled vegetables, I used only 1/2 tablespoon dill seeds, added 1 jalepeno pepper sliced in halved with seeds removed and added some cauliflower.

I doubled the recipe for a party. These were the first thing to go, on a table full of cheese, cookies, hummus, etc. I did not boil the carrots first, although I did throw them into the brine after it had boiled for 2 minutes and cooked the carrots in the brine for 1 minute before pouring them into a bowl. I also used dried dill since I don't keep dill seeds in the house, and it worked fine. Lovely. A real keeper.

Have you tried these quintessentially English pickles? http://huntergathercook.typepad.com/huntergathering_wild_fres/2008/11/in-a-bit-of-a-pickle.html

I made these to garnish Bloody Marys. They're fantastic.

Really good, really easy, and so pretty too. I can imagine this pickling juice would work with many other veggies. I'll definitely make this again and again.

This is one of my family's favorite recipes. I make them often for parties or buffets and they always disappear. You can substitute a small bunch of dill for the seeds.

I've been making these carrots since 1985 when it first was published, they are GREAT.

Outstanding! I am really finicky about pickled foods, and I was a little apprehensive about these. But once I tried them, I was hooked...and so was everyone else at my party. These were the first thing to go. I am making them again tonight.

These are excellent, just like the pickled carrots from the Armenian grocery I grew up loving but could never find a recipie for!!! I've already made them twice, and it works well with other veggies, cauliflower, celery, peppers, etc...
