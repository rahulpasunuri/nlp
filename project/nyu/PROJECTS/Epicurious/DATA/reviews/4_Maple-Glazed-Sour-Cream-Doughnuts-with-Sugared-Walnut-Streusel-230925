These were great doughnuts. They had a nice, almost crisp exterior and an incredibly light interior. The taste was perfect. I made the dough last night and refrigerated until morning. I made the glaze, but omitted the streusel. I will be making these again

So delicious! I made these without the streusel and they were AMAZING! The recipe is really simple, and I had all of the ingredients lying around the house, so it was no hassle. I used a deep-fryer and they turned out perfectly--the doughnut holes were gone within ten minutes! I'm not usually a fan of cake doughnuts, but these are so wonderful.

very good as is. I didn't do the streusel but simply iced these with some chocolate buttercream I had leftover from another recipe. Easy, relatively quick and wonderful dough.

Best donut recipe I've tried yet. I halved the recipe, omitted the cinnamon and used some orange extract instead of the grated orange. It made about 8 donuts and 8 holes. I had good luck frying in shortening instead of oil (seems to be less greasy that way). Also, definitely keep the temp around 356 or oil will get absorbed into the donut. I just put each in a sandwich baggy, removed much of the air, and froze...they were still great weeks later :)

These are amazing! Perfect dense wonderful texture, delicious flavour. I didn't make the streusel or glaze them, and omitted the orange and cinnamon in the doughnuts. They made 12 doughnuts and 12 doughnut holes, but maybe our doughnuts were too thick.

These were good, but for the amount of time involved frying them, I wouldn't make them again. The local doughnut shop makes better doughnuts.

Yum, but next time I would roll the dough slightly thicker and use a larger cutter. Maybe 3 1/2" or 4".

You can make the dough the night before which makes it so much easier to actually have them for breakfast!

So sinful, but so good. They came out much better than store bought doughnuts. The recipe is pretty much fool proof. It does take a lot of time, but it's worth it.

I made these doughnuts along with the others in the article and found them to be wonderful. Ok, I love anything that is maple flavored, but that aside, I had made them for a moving party and everyone loved them and asked for the recipes.
