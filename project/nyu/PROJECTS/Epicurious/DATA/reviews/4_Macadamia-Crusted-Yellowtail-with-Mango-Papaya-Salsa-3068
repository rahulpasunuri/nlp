great meal, I served brown rice made with pineapple juice,over that I put a big helping of the salsa, then slices of the tuna (albutcore),I also used sliced almonds crushed with meat hammer,instead of macadamia nuts.I do believe I over cooked the fish abit,but the favor was still great. will make this again and again.

Exceptional is the word! This is a really great meal. We revised it a bit, though: - We grilled the red peppers and peeled them before adding them to the salsa. - We added more Rice Vinegar and cayenne pepper than the recipe asks for. - We also used kingklip instead of the yellowtail, and left out the frying of the fish in the skillet - we just put it in the oven for about 15 minutes. The result is marvelloso!

This recipe was SO good and also SO easy!! I was given some free yellowtail and started searching for a yummy recipe for it! I followed this pretty exact, however I also added some chopped coconut flakes to the ground macadamia nuts when I coated the fish! It was absolutely delicious!

We didn't make the salsa but the fish was fantastic as prepared. We also used Tilapia which has a nice firm texture and as a result is easy to bread.

Excellent recipe. Had it with red snapper. Will try it with halibut next.

We had this with Halibut in a restaurant, my husband loved it!! I followed this recipe as is except we used halibut. Also, put the nuts in a ziploc and use a rolling pin to chop the nuts, the nuts get gummy very fast in a processor.

I have made the salsa several times and it is always a hit - I can never make enough of it! I substituted the macadamia nuts for bread crumbs, ground pecans, and ground flax seed (from the Bulk Food store) - great results. You can also use Tilapia, Orange Roughy, or Mahi-Mahi if you can't get Yellowtail - I've tried them all and prefer Orange Roughy. I make the Toasted Pecan Pilaf (from this site) as a side, along with some grilled veggies (yellow pepper and zucchini). You will definately impress your guests when you serve this.

made this for my mom's birthday last year and got rave reviews from all! this year my sister requested it for her birthday dinner and already we are all salivating in anticipation. the salsa is great! even terrific eaten w/ tortilla chips (if you make extra- do it!)

I made this for my husband two years ago on our first date and now we're married, if that tells you how good the recipe was! I'm making it again tonight for his birthday. I used the recipe from this site for avocado tropical fruit salsa and it works really well. I also added coconut to the fish before baking, which is nice.

I have not made the yellowtail, but have made the mago-papaya salsa many times. It is delicious! Have served mainly with jerk chicken or a spicy pork. Have had nothing but rave comments from guests.

Well, this was a good dinner, I made with coconut-ginger rice and steamed baby green beans, but it really wasn't what I had expected from all the reviews...I had expected something with a lot more flavor. Don't get me wrong, everything went great together and the salsa was wonderful, but it didn't just say 'WOW, this is a GREAT meal!' I would suggest the pistachio crusted pork tenderloin with the fried leeks instead...it has a similar texture but it is a dish that really says WOW!

Excellent. Will make again - the salsa and macadamia nut crust went well together.

Another winner. I used grouper because yellowtail was not available at the time. The salsa is really good and the crust is crunchy and tasty.

Delicious. Easy. I almost didn't make this recipe because the "cat-fight" of reviews was a turn-off. This is Epicurious not Epicattyous. Kindness to your fellow cook is ALWAYS appreciated (even if we are not a walking webster's).

do you have to spell to cook?? this dish is great.

Patty from San Francisco, a cook from New York, and a cook from Seattle definitely need to learn how to spell "definitely".

I served this dish (with snapper) to friends for dinner and we all loved it! I increased the amount of macadamia nuts to coat the fish a bit more heavily and it came out perfectly. I was surprised that the crust stayed on so well with cooking. I definately plan on making the recipe again.

Very simple. The result is very good with colorful presentation. Definately worthy of a try.

Fabulous! I used grouper to make this dish for a dinner party & everyone loved it. The brightly colored salsa creates a beautiful presentation. Be careful not to grind the nuts for too long if using a food processor, because they will begin to liquify & become messy to work with & do not adhere to the fish as well.

This dish was excellent and simple. However, as I was making this dish, my husband was sitting on the couch eating my mango! Therefore, it was papaya salsa. I know the mango would have made all the difference. We liked it nevertheless!

Well, I've tried this dish with Red Snapper; substituted mango with cantalope, and macadamia with pecans. In one word: awful. I hated the fish....I hated the salsa; it had no "signature theme" let alone flavor. I probably should have just saute'd it with butter & lemon; forget the baking....and whirled the salsa mixture in my blender for a sauce....maybe not.

I was looking for a recipe for some great tuna steaks I picked up when I came across this. My husband opted out of the nut crust but I made mine with pistachios. It was so good my husband ate my serving! Neither of us care much for mango but the salsa was great! Also did not have papaya and had to leave that out of the salsa.

Made this dish for the first time for my fish loving family. I am not a fish lover and normally do not eat the fish I make. I did try this and loved it!! I wished I would have made more!!! Also an easy recipe to make.

What an amazing meal! Adding coconut to the macadamia nuts as someone had suggested made for a nice consistency and flavor. I used fresh halibut and served with saffron rice and fresh green beans. I will definately make this again and again!

Awesome! I added coconut flakes to the nuts and a little ginger to the salsa. Guests raved and asked for the recipe. I served it on a bed of coconut rice with an avacado and hearts of palm salad (from this site) on the side. The colors made for a fabulous presentation. Served with mojitos it's a great carribean style dinner.

WONDERFUL! Everyone was crazy for this dish! I used halibut and sprinkled coconut before baking as someone recommended...delicious! Thought the red pepper was spicy enough, didn't need to add the jalepeno. This was SOOO good, will definitely make again and again.

Made it with Halibut - it was delicious!!! Threw some avocado in the salsa as well fresh jalepeno for a little more of a kick

Absolutley delicious! Tastes fabulous, and the salsa makes it look beautiful. I crusted the fish ahead of time and kept it on the bottom shelf of my fridge. This allowed me to serve an appetizer and then return to the kitchen to cook the fish without making another mess and leaving my guest for too long.

I made this dish for my husband, who is a professional chef. He loved the salsa. Be careful the macadamia nuts burn easy - watch it close. I served with garlic mashed potatoes and a nice California sparkling wine.

Excellent dish, particularly the salsa. I served it with coconut rice, which was a good complement to the other flavors on the plate. This is a keeper.

This salsa is fabulous. It will go with any white fish - we made it with halibut.

Wonderful dish both in flavor and presentation. We served it for our gourmet group and used Mahi-Mahi and sprinkled coconut before baking. The side dish was a ring of garlic mashed potatoes, with the fish and salsa in the center.

Living in Hawaii, we have a long season for the yellowtail tuna ( 'Ahi )and mangoes are in season from about late May until about mid-September. When I first saw this recipe in the magazine I tried it immediately and loved it! It was a great success at one of my dinner parties and we use a variation of this recipe in our cooking classes.

This recipe was easy to prepare. The results were amazing--delicious, exotic, and beautiful. By the way, I used tasty cashew nuts instead of Mac nuts, which was a great combination with the salsa.

I prepared an islands theme dinner for some friends, while on vacation, in Florida. They raved about the salsa and insisted on having the recipe. I used grilled tuna steaks instead of yellowtail. The combination worked very well.

Amazing! This dish reminded me of being in an island, eating delicious fish and fruits! My fiance raved about it too! We are planning on using the salsa on grilled chicken breasts too. The only drawback was that the recipe was relatively healthy until I added the mac nuts, but it was definately worth the taste!

This salsa is PURE HEAVEN! We served the salsa on the side in "bowls" of red cabbage leaves. Great dish for company!

Absolutely excellent! I also made the salsa over a spicy chicken dish and our guests raved about it.

This was absolutely wonderful and very easy to make. I made it with swordfish rather than yellowtail. I used extra mac nuts to coat. The nut mixture keeps the fish quite moist.
