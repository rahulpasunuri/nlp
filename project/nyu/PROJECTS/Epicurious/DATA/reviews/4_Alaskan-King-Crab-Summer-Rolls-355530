Very, very good! I made these as an appetizer and they were devoured! I didn't add the roe, and rolled them in single rice wrapper papers instead of the overlapping method. The flavor was exceptional!

I used this recipe as a base for my summer california roll. I used cucumber, daikon, and sprouts, with sliced avocado, and tobiko/crab/mayo/sriracha mixture. The roll up method is perfect.

Delicious, yes! But "quick and easy?" Come on. After all the slicing, a trip to the pantry for Yuzu, Tobiko, daikon and rice paper? Maybe the quick and easy part is having your restaurant crew prepare these for you.

We loved these! The avocado sauce worked well with the sweet crab and the carrot/daikon mix gave another dimension of flavor. Had to make do without tobiko but will definitely use next time for that extra taste/texture contrast.
