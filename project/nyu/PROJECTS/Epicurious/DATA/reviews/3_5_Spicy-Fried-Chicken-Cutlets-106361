I made this recipe for my family and it was a big hit. It is so good. I did change a few things...I did not have buttermilk so I used half-n-half and I also used panko break crumbs instead of fresh. I also put the chicken on a wire rack to drain after frying to keep it crispy. This is one that I will make again.

YUM!!! I slightly modified this recipe, but it turned out delicious! I sliced the chicken breast into thin strips (instead of pounding it) and made chicken fingers. I didn't have any fresh bread crumbs (or bread) so I used a mix of dried bread crumbs, masa harina and cornmeal, which made the chicken fingers nice and crunchy!

I didn´t have buttermilk so put lime juice in milk and used pepper flakes instead of hot sauce. Also added parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs and it turned out delicious. My teenager loved it!

This was our first recipe on epicurious. This was fabulous. I highly recommend making fresh bread crumbs. Also, the recipe says press "gently". I would press a little harder but make sure you refluff the bread crumbs. Also, watch your oil temperature. Too hot and the crisp up too quickly, not hot enough and the bread just washes off.

My husband and I LOVED this! Who would have thought that something so easy could be this good? I did use more hot sauce in the marinade and more cayenne in the breading because we like the flavors. The chicken was so moist and was good even without extra hot sauce (my husband) and with it me). YUMMY!

read some of the reviews and saw many thought it wasnt spicy enough...so instead i used 2 tablespoons and i teaspoon cayenne....sounds a bit excessive but gave it a really nice kick!

I've made this recipe 3 times thinking I did something wrong and each time I am disappointed. The bread crumb ends ups of at the bottom of the pan in a big lump. The chicken has no bread cumbs on it every time I make it.

This is great comfort food for a week night. The batch frying can take a while if you are just using a 10 or 12 inch skillet so be prepared. I would not recommend making it without the buttermilk, but you can skimp on the marinating time without much flavor loss. It's more like chick fil-a spicy than hot tobasco spicy. But that's why i love it!

I changed the recipe slightly, and thought it was very good. I added a bit of a Hidden Valley Ranch salad dressing packet to the buttermilk marinade and I also added some to the bread crumbs when I coated them. I marinated the chicken for 2 hours and found them really moist and tender. Served with creamed spinach and had leftover chicken today on a sald. Yum!

I read the other reviews saying this chicken wasn't spicy - so I added LOTS of hot sauce to the buttermilk (it was bright orangish pink) and left it to marinate for an hour. The final product was delicious and moist, but even with the cayenne, NOT spicy at all (I'm fairly sensitive to spicy things). I'll try it again later and really kick it up.

Teenagers love this recipe, and the rest of the family likes it too. The first pieces to fry weren't as good as the later pieces; perhaps I should have waited for the oil to get hotter. The chicken is a nice mix of interest (the spicy seasoning) and comfort food (the tender chicken).

My teenagers devoured this. We dont have very much fried food and this was a great treat. Wonderful balance of crispiness and moistness.

I doubled the cayenne and hotsauce, as others recommended, but it still wasn't 'spicy'. It had a nice flavor, though, and I added hotsauce on the table. I cut the breasts into strips, allowing for more surface area/breading/flavor per piece, which worked well. I'll definitely make this again!

I made it exactly as in the recipe except I added extra cayenne to the bread crumbs (oh, which were Progresso, not fresh -- and half Italian flavored because that's what I had). I thought it was excellent. The chicken was moist and the breading was flavorful -- just spicy enough without being overwhelming. Served it with a green salad and some fresh applesauce and hubby and I both loved it.

The cutlets were delicious, succulent and tender, but not spicy, despite my doubling the hot sauce amount, almost doubling the cayenne, and letting the chicken soak in the buttermilk mixture for almost 2 hours. I used panko instead of the bread crumbs. I made the blue cheese dressing, which was fabulous alongside. Next time, I will just have to come up with some ideas to kick it up a notch.

This fried chicken has been a staple in my house since I first discovered it over a year ago. It always comes out delicious. I do recommend marinating the chicken a little longer in the buttermilk (about an hour) because it really tenderizes the chicken. I also on occasion add some chopped rosemary to the marinade. It's delicious

This was okay at best. It wasn't as spicy as I would like, and was actually a bit bland. If I'm going to bother to fry something, and deal with the mess, it better be good. This one didn't make the cut for me.

This was ok. I might make it again but only if I play with some other spices though.

I got many compliments on this dish. I decided to make chicken strips instead of cutlets....and they turned out terriffic. Would definitely add a little more spice next time, but just my taste preference.

this is one of the few dishes that my picky 6 year old son requests me to make and he actually eats it and comes back for seconds. i will make this as often as he asks.

One would think if you like things spicy, you would add more, which I did. Letting the chicken sit in the buttermilk for several hours helps. I thought it was very tasty, it's a no brainer

This was terrific! My family and I loved it.

We really liked this recipe. It's fast, easy and tasty. Used way way less oil than called for. Sprayed the pan and put about 1 tblsp of oil in to brown the cutlets. They were great.

The recipe was alright; nothing spectacular. I'm a spiceaholic, so next time i shall use more pepper. (go easy on susan...i didn't see anything catty about her post...)

This was OK, but I've had better, I could barely taste the spiciness, but at least my son was able to eat it. I served it with the blue cheese salad as well. Not bad for a week-night dinner, but all the splattering from the oil was a pain to clean up afterwards. Not really worth all the mess.

These were fine but nothing wonderful. Might be good on a sandwich but I won't try again. BTW I used chicken tenders which are so very tender anything is good with them!

Enough heat without black pepper. Added garlic powder and celery salt to buttermilk for extra flavor. Susan, this is not a traditional southern recipe.

I found this recipe flavorful and easy. But frying is always a challenge on my electric stovetop in a condominium's kitchen with a skimpy hood/microwave combo. Grease splattering everywhere! I used tobasco sauce which I thought would be too spicy but it was just right. A new family fave.

I made this dish this evening for my Chef husband who ate raw chicken as a fraternity pledge and had sworn it off since then. In a strong attempt to cut down on our red meat consumtion, I have been searching this website. I have never heard such raves about chicken..I suggest not using store bought bread crumbs...I thought they looked to bulky at first but they actually turn into a kind of cayenne stuffing around perfectly tender chicken. I almost switched to progresso when I looked at them...so glad I didn't!

i am a avid fan of spicy food,and chicken is my favorite meal,so i get the best of two worlds

Imake this dish all the time..it's great for a quick dinner and also holds up well to take along on a picnic..I save calories by baking the chicken in a 400 degree oven....I spray a cookie sheet with non stick spray..then spray the cutlets...30 minutes on each side..when you turn spray again..also lightly toasting the breadcrumbs in the oven before coating adds snap

Cut the recipe in half for two, which worked fine. Served with the recommended salad. For that I left out the watercress, used iceberg lettuce and celery and the blue cheese dressing.
