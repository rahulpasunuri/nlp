I've made this steak many times and it is delicious and always a showstopper. Any advice on making two at the same time?

I did as Lizziebearcooks did. I used the spice mix itself, and not the salt crust. I rubbed the mixture of spices into my porterhouse steak, and then pan seared it in a little peanut oil. My steak was about an inch and a half thick, so I seared it for 4 minutes on each side, but that was pretty rare for my husband, so I would suggest 5 to 6 minutes on each side. When it is done, put it on a platter and tent it with foil and leave it to rest for at least 5 minutes before eating.

I am reviewing based on the spice mix itself, not the salt crust method. I simple scaled down the spice mix by half and omitted the extra salt altogether. I blended in a coffee grinder and rubbed on 4 1 in. t-bones. I pan seared them to medium rare and they were exceptional. This blend of spices is superb. Don't be put off if you don't want to try the salt crust - just do the rub.

Even after removing the salt crust (which was very impressive), I still had rinse the steak because it was inedible. Rinsing made it tolerable, but it was too salty. I followed the recipe exactly. This recipe was a waste of a good steak.

I love salt but this is WAY TOO SALTY. And no, as suggested in a previous review of another reviewer, I did not eat the crust. This is a total waste of a fine Porterhouse.

Excellent! The steak was perfectly seasoned - not at all salty. I am wondering if maybe the previous reviewer tried to eat the salt crust? Cooked perfectly in 25 minutes and was very moist.

way tooo salty...the seasoning was good but at the end the salt crust was just too much to handle...had to dump it in the trash...very disappointed though, very expensive cut of meat into the trash...never make again

Steak came out moist and well-seasoned, and the presentation is very impressive. I kept the salt crust, just crumbled it in a jar and use it as flavored salt.

I've made this twice. 4 steaks the fist time and 5 the second. This recipe is perfect. I'm lucky that Table 8 is closed for renovations because my clients are really enjoying this steak. Govind and his crew definately have all my respect and thanks for sharing this recipe ( It has evolved since it's first printing in the Times) Buy the porterhouse from Maracondas at the Farmer's market. Follow this recipe exactly.
