Kid friendly and they can do it themselves. I use "George" for some warmth. The kids use the microwave to melt the cheese. Easy way to get rid of leftovers.

I made these for a speech I had to do for my Speech 205 class and everyone loved them. I used normal tortillas though because I could not find chili-flavored ones.

I omitted the jalapenos from the recipe and instead added----- grilled onions, tomatoes, oregano, black pepper, and crushed red pepper seasoning. I used Perdue Shortcuts, and the Quesadillas were tremendous!!!

It's nothing fancy, but it's fast, easy, and good. I've served it as an appetizer and as an entree and always recieve complements. I always serve it with salsa, sour cream, or guacamole though.

Looks like reviews are negative but if you view the recipe as an outlet for leftover chicken or turkey it's pretty good. Add some cilantro, guacomole, and some salsa for dipping and it's just fine. It won't win any awards but it's good if you got a taste for it.

The only problem with this recipe is the lack of suggestions for appropriate toppings. Quesadillas should be topped with a choice of sour cream, guacamole, spicy salsa, sheddred lettuce and finely grated sharp cheddar. Cut the quesadilla like a pie and share it and the toppings with your guests.

I think the whole mexican food experience suffers due to this kind of over simplefied pre prepared out of the freezer cuisine. Chef Seattle, Wa
