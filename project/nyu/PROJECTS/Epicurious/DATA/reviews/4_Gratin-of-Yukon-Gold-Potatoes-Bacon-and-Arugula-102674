I left out the arugula--great! Other reviewers cautioned that it could be runny, so I used half-and-half instead of whole milk. It cut into perfect slices that retained their shape, no running whatsoever. Mine cooked in 45 minutes, so be careful about the 1:15 cooking time.

Rating: 4
This dish has become a Christmas staple in our house. VERY rich. I don't worry about using whole milk as we never have it in the house and using 1% certainly doesn't effect the richness of this dish. Would like to do some experimentation to cut down on the whipping cream. Guest always rave about this-and curse the calories. Just enjoy!

I have made this every Thanksgiving and/or Christmas for the past 4 years. When I asked the family what they wanted on the menu for Thanksgiving this year, my nine year old requested "the potatoes w/ the bacon and cheese". So easy and so good!!! FYI... my hubby does not like Gruyère cheese so I substitute Parmesan.

Rating: 3
Made this 3 or 4 times and is always a hit. try it with smoked gruyere cheese. yum

I made this for an Easter gathering. Everyone enjoyed it! The arugula gives it an "edgy almost bitter & mature" taste to it but gives the dish a balance amongst the richness of the ingredients. The alterations I made were: I used less liquids (after reading the other reviews) and I used 5 oz of baby arugula (it was all I could find at my store and it was plenty!). I may try spinach next time. But overall, it was scrumptious and a keeper for special occasions.

I was worried about making this for my family as they tend to like more traditional dishes. I was worried about the arugula - but I tried it anyway (I figured I could tell them it was spinach!) - I should not have worried...they loved it!

I had high expectations for this dish when I saw it had a four-fork rating. Made it instead of my usual au gratin potatoes and took it to a 50th birthday party. Other than a couple of known foodie friends of mine, no one really liked it. I personally just thought it to be okay... nothing special and certainly not better than my 'boring' au gratin recipe. Oh well...

The flavors in this recipe are delicious! I did find it a little on the liquid-y side, but I served it with slotted spoon and it turned out wonderful. I haved the recipe with no problem.

I made this, but instead of the milk and cream, I used a jar of Alfredo sauce with mushrooms and added about a half cup of cream and a half cup of water and mixed it together in a bowl...my guests raved about it...delicious!

Rating: 2
I thought this was just okay. If I ever made it again I think I may sauté the arugula first to drain some of the moisture out of it. I served this with the filet with port wine and shallot sauce from this site. The sauce for the filet was phenomenal!

Rating: 4
This dish was superb and my guests all wanted the recipe. Owing to personal preference, I did make some alterations: I added shallots that had been sauteed in the bacon fat and I used less arugula than called for -- maybe only 25% of what the recipe called for.

This is by far the most EXCELLENT and DELICIOUS potato recipe! It is a HUGE hit everytime I serve it whether at home or elsewhere. It is hard to imagine finding anything to top it.

Rating: 3
I have made this recipe many times, though never with the bacon and replacing the spinach for the arugula at least once....it is always outstanding. You might be thinking "with that fat content, how could it not be", and thus the three forks instead of four. However, for those of you willing to overlook a little extra fat for a holiday meal, it makes a perfect and delicious accompaniment to Christmas or Easter dinner.

Rating: 4
Extremely good and I will try the pancetta next time. I thought there may not be enough bacon but the flavor comes through easily. Good Gruyere helps too. And it bubbled over on me even though I used a bit less liquod.

Rating: 3
Forgot to mention - YES! put foil on the bottom of your oven; it does spill over!!

Rating: 3
A delicious recipe; next time I will use a bit less liquid. I used a mandoline for the first time and the thin slicer - maybe the potato slices were too thin? I cooked early in the day and then reheated for 15 min. Used pancetta instead of bacon.

Fantastic recipe; the best au gratin I've made. It does tend to bubble over; I suggest setting the baking dish on a foil-lined cookie sheet.

Have now made this twice for holiday meals. Never any leftovers and always sure to be a hit!

I was astonished at my holiday guests' reaction to this dish. We thought we were going to have to break up a near-fight over the last servings. I made two huge lasagna pans full and still every last bite was wolfed down (and silly me I thought I'd freeze the second pan...). I used about 1/2 liquid; substituted high-quality pancetta for bacon, cut back on arugula, and made them a day in advance. All of those things (all suggestions from previous reviewers) worked wonderfully, apparently. Delicious with beef tenderloin.

Rating: 4
This dish was delicious, It tastes amazing with roast beef. I took it to a christmas eve party and all loved it.

Rating: 4
Wonderful recipe! I was a little concerned that it was to much liquid for the amount of potatoes, but it came together nicely. Made this with a standing rib roast. Usually like to incorporate the bacon drippings into recipes calling for bacon, but given the cream/whole milk/cheese in recipe, figured it would be a little too much. Made it one day ahead. Reheated easily.

12/02: This one is a "keeper", as my husband says. Served this with prime rib and the baby carrots w/tarragon for our Christmas dinner. Everyone raved about it! 12/03: UPDATE!! By popular request, served this again but with the Herb and Garlic-Crusted Beef Tenderloin with Red and Yellow Pepper Relish (an Epicurious recipe). My calorie-counting daughter raved about this yummy recipe. I said, "um, I have to tell you.....it has 2-1/2 cups of whipping cream, 1-1/2 cups of whole milk and 2 cups of grated Gruyere cheese". She just about had a heart attack but asked for a second helping! Oh well, it's only once a year! Happy Holidays!

Rating: 2
I thought this was inferior to classic, more delicate potato gratin, such as Julia Child's. The arugula flavor was lost, and the gruyere was too overpowering. We had leftovers which I'll serve tonight. Maybe this dish wears better the second time, but I doubt I'd make it again.

This dish was awesome! I made it for company and everyone raved and asked for the recipe. Even my husband, who is not a big potato fan, thought it was delicious. I sliced the potatoes (russets) on a mandoline, almost paper thin, and the result was a creamy, cheesy, melt in your mouth delight!

To the cook from London...Yukon Gold is a waxy potato that has yellow flesh and has a smooth, almost creamy texture - I'm sure you could substitute it with another yellow-fleshed European variety. I liked this recipe, but I think another recipe on this site - Scalloped Potatoes with Goat Cheese & Herbes de Provence - is even better. Try them both!

Rating: 0
Could anyone suggest a European equivalent for Yukon Golds - I'd like to make this but am not sure what kind of potato you need. Many thanks.

yes. i agree. delicious. i made this the night before and the consistancy was fine. However it totally bubbled over my 9x13 pan and preceded to smoke up my kitchen, from now on foil on the bottom of the oven for a quick clean-up. it really brown quickly. I reccomend covering with foil for part of the baking time. it was delicious.

Rating: 4
This is the first dish that I have rated here--because it was soooo good. I couldn't find arugula so I used spinach, I think to favorable results. I also couldn't find gruyere so the woman at the cheese store recommended a blend of Emmenthal (like a swiss) and Raclatte (a very stinky cheese) which is what they use for fondue. VERY TASTY! I also substituted prosciutto for the bacon--YUM. However I think next time I'll go a little heavier on the spinach and prosciutto. Also I thought it was a little liquid-y from the cream/milk so maybe I'll cut back a little on that. Be sure to cook it for the full 75 mins, because I was a little rushed and felt my potatoes were a little al dente in places. Definitely will make it again--husband went nuts for it.

I served this dish to my family for Christmas dinner, to great reviews. Both kids and adults liked it (I did leave out the arugula so the kids would try it.)

Rating: 4
Made this with prosciutto instead of bacon to attempt to not make this dish a bit less greasy. It nicely accompanied the "Herb- And Garlic-Crusted Beef Tenderloin With Red And Yellow Pepper Relish". Since I made too much, there were leftovers, which I am very grateful for! This dish might even be better the second day.

Rating: 4
It's a winner! I did make the dish the day ahead, and unlike others, had no problems with it's consistancy. The Gruyere cheese gave it a distinctive flavor, but I didn't feel the Argula made such a difference that I would search for it again to include in the recipe. Rewarming it though does take longer than indicated, and I did reheat it from room temperature. I was concerned that the top of the dish seemed too dry but once it was cut into the rest was wonderfully creamy with a nice crisp top. A dish which allows you to concentrate on the rest of the meal while being assured that your potato dish is different and ready.

Rating: 3
This is the second year I have made this dish for Christmas, and again there were no leftovers. This year I paired it with the New York strip loin with garlic herb crust, and it really was great. I also made it a day ahead this year, and would have to agree that its better the same day; it does tend to separate a bit when reheated.

Rating: 4
This dish is fabulous! I made it for Christmas along with Prime Rib with garlic and thyme gravy. The whole meal everyone kept commenting how good it was! Definitely an impressive sidedish. I would also cover the top about 15 minutes before finished. It does get a little dark. Would not use spinach in place of arugula. The arugula gives it that one of a kind taste! Yuummm!

Rating: 4
This was absolutely delicious. I substituted baby spinach for the arugula, which was perfect! I do recommend covering with foil for the last 15-20 minutes of baking because, as another reviewer noted, it browns very quickly, burnt a few of the bacon pieces on top. All in all, the dish is GONE! No one could stop "picking" even after dinner! Thumbs up for this one!

Rating: 3
I made the mistake of cooking this dish the day before our party and then reheating it. Even though I took it out of the refrigerator 1+ hours prior to reheating, it was cold in the middle and quite greasy after 30 minutes @ 375*. The flavor was great, but the "butter" separated from the cheese/cream and it looked icky.

Rating: 4
One of the very best gratin recipes I've ever made. The only change I made was using half cream & half 2% milk! The arugula seems to blend in with all the flavors - do not leave it out. Also, I did not have a runny problem and wonder if substituting spinach would cause more liquid. I can't wait to serve this to company.

Rating: 4
I had picked this recipe out as a side dish to my upcoming prime rib dinner on Christmas Eve, and thought trying it out would be a smart move. I also substituted the arugula for spinach--and I could not have been more pleased with the results. It was perhaps the most fabulous gratin I have ever experienced in my life. I recommend using thick bacon, cooked extra crispy. YUM!!!!!

Rating: 4
This is one of my absolute favorite recipes! I must admit that I am not an arugula fan, so I always leave that out, but everywhere I take this it is a hit. In fact, my family has asked that for all future potlucks, this is the dish I bring! Would recommend making it one day ahead of time and reheating. It is always a bit runny when freash from the oven. A simple and classic (albeit rich!) side dish.

Rating: 4
I haven't given many dishes 4 forks, but this is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!. This is the best side dish so far I've made from epicurious, (though I'm usually looking more lowfat) This dish is worth every single calorie. Will be on my xmas menue.

I was a little worried about making this dish for the first time for Easter dinner. No need to worry; it was a huge success. Even the skeptics who had never heard of arugula (thought it might be a disease)liked it. Not bitter at all. This is the best gratin recipe I've had and it is a keeper!

Very, very rich. Although my guests enjoyed it, no one could dare have seconds (some couldn't even finish the first serving.) It was, however, delicious. I think next time I make this, I would cut back on the amount of cheese and bacon, so the potatoes could shine. The Yukon Golds were wonderful, but you could hardly taste them.

Yummy! Didn't use Yokon Golds, but was excellent anyway. This was good leftover, too.

This dish was fantastic. I made for New Years Day along with prime rib, green beans and sauted shallots. Since I had 15 people I made one regular size and one half recipe, did it the day before and then all I had to do was warm it for a half hour or so. I wouldn't cut back on the cream because it is a wonderful recipe that I would only use for special occasions anyway.

Rating: 4
How can anything with good fattening ingredients be bad? Good thing the arugula counteracted the fat. I made this with a filet mignon recipe from this site. Even my son that dislikes cheese (so he thinks loved it) I made it a day ahead of time, it turned out great

Rating: 4
I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a great hit! I did the prep work such as grating the cheese, frying the bacon, and chopping the arugula the night before. My grocery was out of Gruyere and I used Swiss Emmenthaler cheese. I also doubled the recipe and made it in a 5-quart casserole dish (Chantal has a great one) and increased the cooking time to 90 minutes.

You really have to know your potatoes and your oven for this one. I didn't, breaking in a new air oven and buying anonymous potatoes, which came out raw, while the rest of the gratin risked burning. It was a minor disaster for me, but I could tell the dish had potential. I'll try again until I get it right.

Rating: 4
Very well received by all guests. I loved the fact that I could make this a day ahead. In fact, I believe its better that way. I ended up putting foil over the last 15 min of baking as it was getting pretty brown. I also think it would be fine with a bit less cream. I will definitely make this again.

Wow. I made the serving for 10 when I had only five guests and had no leftovers. Even my choosy guest had a second serving. A rare thing, indeed. Going to replace my previous gratin potato recipe with this one. Could cut back on the cream if it's too much. It'll still be good.

My husband cringes whenever I want to make a potato gratin - it has to do with the cheese and cream that he tries desparately to stay away from. So...I didn't tell him I was making it but I used less cream (half cream and half milk), and left out the bacon, and he *totally* loved it. I mean he raved about it. This is a first - I think I should keep it!

We didn't follow the recipe exactly, but it was great the way we made it. I think it is much better the day it is made than it is a day later. I wouldn't recommend making it a day ahead if you can avoid it. I used a mandolin to slice the potatoes, and it was so fast. It took longer to cook than the recipe says, allow 1 hr 30 minutes to make sure you have enough time to have the sauce thicken. I was dumb and didn't measure the salt and pepper. I would recommend measuring out the full amount of each into a dish, and then just sprinkling from that dish as you put the layers together. We used baby spinach instead of arugula and left out the bacon, and it was still wonderful. We served it at our fancy holiday dinner party, with prime rib, and it was perfect. We have had plenty of potato gratin recipe's fail, so this recipe was a great find. We will definitely make it again.

I made this for a dinner party we hosted last night. It's a great do-ahead dish that can be reheated right before serving. I'd recommend covering it with foil for part of the time when baking--the cheese browned very quickly and threatened to burn.
