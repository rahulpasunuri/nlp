YUM! Added a splash of olive oil and salt. Great soup topping.

In the warm months, I make this weekly and change it up a bit by adding orange (or not) and oregano (or not). Great on everything from a pizza and pasta to grilled meats. I even add it to yogurt for a great veggie dip. I find a couple drops of olive oil keep it moist if you're going to store it for a few days.

Just added extra virgin olive oil to this recipe and substituted for the argentinean chinichurri for grilled meats, getting a great variation and taste.

Nice addition to braised dishes. I substitued orange zest for the lemon and served over lamb shanks. It really brightened up the flavors!

Have cooked many stews with and without osso bucco and the gremolata makes a huge difference.Crusty bread to soak up any leftover juices is also recommended

This stuff is really powerful, a little goes a long way. Well worth the addition to the Osso Buco-Style Halibut but let your guest add it to their dish.

Gremolata recipe worked very well with the halibut "osso bucco". This recipe makes a very good crust for halibut filets by adding 1 Tbsp of anchovy paste and the minced zest of half of another lemon. Make sure that the filets a well seasoned with kosher salt and cracked black pepper. Place 1 1/2 Tbsp of the crust on each filet and bake at 425F 10-12 minutes. Serve with lemon buerre blanc.
