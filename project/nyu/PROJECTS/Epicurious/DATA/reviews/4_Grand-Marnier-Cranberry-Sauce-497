This sauce is super easy and you don't have to watch and stir the pot! I definitely recommend to cut sugar in half! I did and it was perfect!

Hands down, best cranberry sauce ever. Family tradition established (including trip to liquor store to buy the airplane sized Grand Marnier)

Rating: 4
I have made this cranberry sauce for at least ten years; a few deviations, but found that decreasing the sugar to 3/4 cup, adding freshly squeezed tangerine sauce and zest really make all of the flavors pop. I take the zest from one tangerine, and the juice from two. And like many of the other cooks here, I have a heavy hand with the Grand Marnier... One thing I forget every year - wait until the cranberries cool before adding the Grand Marnier, and smelling it, the fumes will knock you over!!!

This is my favorite cranberry sauce recipe. I must confess to being a little heavy on the Grand Marnier, but otherwise I make it as directed. This has been my go to cranberry sauce for the past few years and I realized when I came back to bookmark it for this year's meal that I never reviewed it. Highly recommended!

Delicious and easy cranberry sauce!

After reading the reviews I made this yesterday and it's really delicious. I was busy and forgot it was in the oven until it was in for an hour and a half! When I took it out, it was perfect! I used Truvia instead of sugar, the zest of one lemon and one orange, the juice of one and a half oranges, and then I increased the Grand Marnier by a couple of tablespoons. Only problem is to keep from tasting it so much that there's nothing left for Thanksgiving!

This flavor combination is wonderful, but, I've found that making this in a large pot on the top of the stove greatly speeds the process and eliminates major clean-up. Just put the cranberries, sugar, and orange juice concentrate in the pot and simmer covered until the berries pop.We cut the sugar to 3/4 cups as we prefer our sauce a little more tart than sweet.

@ ldarden76 from Raleigh, NC I've made this recipe for years and have always just used a couple of tablespoons of regular orange juice. They have always come out wonderful. The key is adding the Grand Marnier at the end. Enjoy!

For those who substituted fresh orange juice, how much did you use? I found online that 2 tablespooks = 1oz and that 1 oz of orange juice concentrate = 1/2 cup fresh orange juice. Obviously there is a big difference between adding 2 tablespoons of liquid or 1/2 cup of liquid. Did anyone find this to be a problem?

Rating: 4
I confess that there is a simpler way -- the microwave. They are perfect - everyone loves them and the sauce is great warm. I offerred both this version and the jelly version and a 10 yr old at the table asked for "more cranberries" - his Mom reached for the jelly ones and he said "No Momma - I like the other kind"!! Pretty high marks I think!!

On the taste/presentation of the dish alone, I'd actually only give this recipe "3 forks," as I think it very good, but not "exceptional." However, it is so ridiculously easy to prepare... it deserves an extra fork just for that. Tripled the recipe (cooking for an extra 10 minutes in a larger pan) for the Thanksgiving lunch at the office and several people have already asked for the recipe.

For this recipe do you boil the cranberries as the package tells you then put the cooked berries into the pan with the orange juice and the Grand Marnier to bake? The way this is written its a little vague. Thanks!

Found this very simple recipe that nearly prepares itself--the flavor was without any tartness without being too sweet and the texture was great--it was a big hit even amongst those that don't usually eat cranberry sauce. I will be using this one for a very long time.

I have used this recipe since it appeared in the magazine. We had guests for Thanksgiving yesterday, who brought two different cranberry recipes. My kids asked to make our "regular" cranberries today. They missed them, even though the others were also good. I did, too, so I had to look it up, as I could not find it in my box. Thank you for the recipe again!

Absolutely the best cranberry sauce -- very festive but great anytime. You can substitute orange juice for the frozen concentrate but use Grand Marnier (as opposed to an off-brand orange liquor). The flavor of the Grand Marnier really comes through.

Be sure to place the dish of cranberries on a cookie sheet (with sides) when you bake it! If you just cover it with foil and stick it in the oven, you will have a huge mess on your hands; the cranberry sauce boils over the sides of the dish. I have a gas oven, and the cranberry sauce caught on fire. There were 8" flames inside my oven, and my kitchen was filled with smoke -- the day before Thanksgiving! Besides the mess (and panic), the cranberry sauce was the best I've ever had. I loved the combination of Grand Marnier and cranberry.

This is so simple to prepare, a bit messy on the oven, but if you use a cookie sheet under the pan it's also simple to clean up. I did add the grated rind of 1/2 an orange and 1/4 of a lemon along with the liqueur.

I've made this dish many times to the delight of family and friends. I've never had the "boil-over" problem that several cooks have cited. Could this problem be caused by using previously frozen cranberries? I've never used frozen ones....

My fault, but I didn't think about using a cookie sheet under the pan like I always do for fruit pies. It boiled over, and now I have a terrible mess on the bottom of my oven the day before Thanksgiving. I do have 2 ovens. So will bake my pies in the other, while I clean this one. Tool a taste while putting it in container for refrigerator. It tastes wonderful, but a little too sweet. I will use less sugar next time.

Oh my Goodness!!! I make this every year for Thanksgiving and everyone raves about it. You MUST use the Grand Marnier and no other substitute. You can make it 3 days ahead and each day it gets tastier and tastier.

Good easy recipe. I have two tips though: 1) You MUST place your cranberry sauce on a cookie sheet. There probably will be some boiling over and messiness involved in the oven, if you don't. 2) Grand marnier it turns out is pretty pricey (especially when you're just using 2 tbsp.). Get a tiny, toy-size bottle (about $3.50) instead of a big one.

I thought this was good, but not great, so I added the zest of 1 orange and 1/2 of lemon when I added the Grand Marnier. Wonderful, just the punch that it needed. I even used the cranberries as an extra layer in a Gingerbread Pumpkin Trifle.

I have made this for the past 4 years at thanksgiving and christmas - our whole family loves it!! I've had great success with some alterations. You can use other sorts of alcohol if you haven't got the orange liqueur, Jack Daniels worked great last year ;) I also added more than just a little zest - I slice the peel off, scrape out the pith, and chop it into small cubes. The baking (and sugar!) takes the bitterness right out of it and it's very pretty. I also added chopped walnuts last year, which were a hit. It seems I can do no wrong with this recipe. This year I've bought a bottle of Pom (pomegranate juice) to use rather than orange juice. I expect it will be just as awesome. !

This was without a doubt the best cranberry sauce I've ever had. Sublime. I'm ready to make it again this week. I made two batches last week and the texture of each batch was completely different from the other. The first batch - the berries retained their shape, but w/ the second batch the berries were more cooked down and lost their shape. I'm positive I made them in an identical fashion. They tasted the same, but the first batch was more attractive. I didn't experience the boiling over w/ either batch that other reviewers experienced.

I make this recipe twice a year and it is always such a hit I've learned to double or treble it. (One recipe serves about 4-6, in my experience.) I add the finally grated peel of one large orange and the juice of that orange intead of the OJ concentrate. (Mix the peel with the cranberries before your add sugar and juice.) Also, don't spend a lot of money on orange liquer. The taste is not noticable, so gin or vodka work almost as well if you're out of orange stuff. I double the amount of liquor.

This was fantastic.. but with all recipes I added a twist... instead of the Orange Concentrate I added a small can of passion fruit pulp and went a little light on the sugar... this was out of this world... will make again and again and again!

This is a nice, easy alternative to canned cranberry sauce. Not too sweet and the orange infusion adds a nice touch. Many of the berries stayed whole, providing nice consistency. This sauce was a hit with everyone at the table! I plan to add this to my Thanksgiving recipe file.

So delicious, and so, so easy...you'll never buy the canned stuff again. I used regular OJ instead of concentrate and it was fine. The Grand Marnier adds a great touch and the flavor is even deeper if you make it a day or two before serving. One word of advice: I baked the berries in an 8x8 Pyrex dish and, despite the foil, they bubbled over the sides and made a mess in my oven. Put the dish on a cookie sheet before you put it in the oven and life will be easier.

This was a great recipe.Being a chef in Michigan I decided to experiment with this one.Instead of cranberries I used a dried cran-raisin that I use at work everyday.I decreased the sugar to 1 cup,added orange & lemon zest. And instead of baking this I brought it to a simmer on the stove top and added a slurry(cornstarch & water) to thicken it up.If your not familiar with how to use a slurry start with a little at a time because it will thicken quickly.Then let simmmer on low for 10 minutes on low.

This was incredible! My family was skeptical because this was my first Thanksgiving dinner and they are used to the "traditional" cranberry sauce, but they loved it. I needed to decrease the recipe by half, but I then decreased the sugar by 3/4 a cup or more and tossed in some orange zest. The sugar would have been overwhelming in my opinion, but perhaps not everyone wants the cranberry sauce to edge toward the sweet/sour side... This is a keeper!!!

This was excellent and the flavor packed a giddy wallop for sure. I made it the night before. I think next time I will make it shortly before dinner and serve it slightly warm to preserve that great Grand Marnier taste. I also used tangerine juice rather than orange. This was very easy to make, too. A keeper!

This is the most insane cranberry sauce I have every had/made!!!!! I am soooooo loving this recipe!!!!! I modified it a little by decreasing the sugar to 1 Cup and then drizzling on a 1/4 Cup of honey.

I am taking this dish to a Thanksgiving get together tomorrow and I know everyone will be begging for this amazing recipe!!
