I love this recipe. I made it before Hurricane Sandy figuring if the power went out (it didn't) it could sit out and be fine. Used bouillon cubes instead of veal stock. The flavors are so elegant.

I recently made this again for a dinner party and everyone loved it as a side dish. I did, however, make a few adjustments. Firstly, I only blanched the haricot verts in lightly salted water - MUCH better texture than the "completely tender" in recipe. I also used the vinaigrette from MESCLUN SALAD WITH SHALLOT VINAIGRETTE also on this site. I found the veal stock in the original vinaigrette to be an odd accompaniment - particularly with the subtle taste of the leek and onion mixture.

Yuck. I should have known better. This recipe looks and tastes as gross as it sounds.

With a husband who resists vegetables, the 2 of us could not get enough with a serving for 4. The beans must be the very best quality if harictos verts are not available. I preferred it with and increase in shallots. And SO easy!
