I was just trying to use up the last of my Christmas brussel sprouts and oh my do I ever wish I had used this recipe at dinner! We had plain sprouts the first time round and they were seriously meh. But I actually want seconds and thirds of this recipe. Miam miam.

Yum! I added some leftover pork and a touch of honey to this recipe and it was delicious!

I really liked this (if I could, I'd give it 2.5 forks, but I feel generous). It was a nice alternative to steamed sprouts, which is what I usually do. I think I'd make with olive oil next time--the butter w/Dijon was a bit odd. And, I used regular Dijon, but I think the coarse-grain would be better.

I don't know why we hated this compared to everyone else. We, as in my family, like brussels sprouts, but we couldn't eat this recipe, it just sat on our plates.

This is one of my families favourite vegetable recipes. I never thought I would be asked to cook sprouts or hear the words "try them they are really good". It is a forgiving recipe and can be made ahead and reheated successfully.

We love Brussels sprouts for Thanksgiving dinner and were looking for a new recipe. Tried this one and we found a winner. Easy to make. Excellent presentation, and the taste is a perfect counterpoint to turkey, stuffing, and sweet potatoes.

This was definitely a success. We don't often eat Brussels Sprouts, but started getting them in our weekly winter produce order and started looking for recopies. It is very simple, and the results are great. Tender sprouts with nice caramelized onions and spicy mustard. I have also added grated carrots for color and a little flavor with success.

This is a fantastic recipe for brussel sprouts... They are so boring just boiled or steamed, and this recipe gives them a kick without adding too much longer to the prep time. The mustard really is a very complimentary flavor, will definitely use every time i make brussel sprouts!

Big disappointment after the excellant reviews. Although I followed the recipe exactly (something that is hard for me to do), it was bland and very forgetful. Nothing special in any way.

What a great recipe! So easy and so delicious. I halved the brussel sprouts and added some minced garlic on the adive of another reviewer. Enjoy!
