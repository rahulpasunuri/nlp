Variation: I had leftover dough from making spoon cookies (recipe onsite--basically a browned butter shortbread). I formed it into tart shells, baked and cooled as instructed, then proceeded with the rest of the recipe. While the tarts were cooling I spread melted chocolate over the top and...OMG!!!! Fabulous dessert that seems much harder than it is. It's so rich though, this version needs a little sweetened whipped cream on the side.

Easy to make, only the baking time for the second baking seems a bit too lomg (at least in my oven). Delicious combo, I think I'll make a pecan brittle without the crust next time. And I'll have to try crumbles of these in vanilal ice cream...

This is absolutely scrumptious! I could not quit eating them. Yes, I'm sure they are very, very fattening, but they are the good, old fashioned praline taste in a cookie. None better.

Outstanding! I made these for xmas and the inlaws gobbled up every last one. They made me promise to bring them next year. I cooked the cookie crust for only 15 minutes as others suggested and it was perfect. I cut them into 32 pieces each approx 2 by 2. This is a lot of work but the caramel is so delicious do not even think about buying sauce.

So good!! These got rave reviews from family and friends - even those who insisted they could only have one came back for another. The salty-sweet caramel complemented the crunchy pecans and the buttery shortbread really well. I too was worried when I added the cream and the sugar hardened, but don't give up! It eventually melts. The only thing I would say is that they are a little messy - it isn't as hard as a brittle, so the pecans were falling off the cookie. But overall a standout recipe!

I have made these dozens of times always to rave reviews! I only cook the cookie for 17 minutes and have trained myself to let the sugar melt without messing with it. They freeze beautifully.

Great recipe, everyone raved over these. I made a few modifications and used a combination of toasted macadamia, walnut and pecans and used a pate sucre base. Definitely a keeper!

scrumptious and relatively easy. followed the suggestions and found that the shortbread did take about 10 minutes less to cook. caramel was quick cooking as well. all in all, it's a lovely balance between the shortbread crust and a rich, salty caramel!

These were a hit... I added 1/4 Cup of water to the sugar when I melted it to make a simple syrup, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and they were great! =)

I love the mixture of caramel and pecans so this recipe caught my eye right away. They were very tasty! The only difficult part was making the caramel. And even that isn't truly hard, just time consuming! The only things I would change are, baking the cookies even less than they say (they brown very easily), and making more caramel. It was barely able to spread the mix over the entire sheet of cookies.

Rating: 4
Everyone looks forward to when I make these. The recipe works very well, but I only cook the base for 15 min., which prevents burning or being too hard, and then when I cook the top, I cook for 25 minutes, letting it bubble for a while, or else the center, while delicious, can be too gooey to hold. I find the balance of ingredients to be perfect! Just made a half sheet cake size, doubling the recipe, which saved time from making 2 separate batches.

I made these for a cookie contest at work at received rave reviews as well. I followed the other reviewers advice and sprinkled coarse sea salt over the top which added a very nice counter point to the sweetness. I did have a problem with melting the sugar the first time and had to chuck it. It burned very quickly. I would recommend keeping a close eye on it and as soon as you see it melting remove it from the heat and stir until you get it under control before putting it back on the heat.

Rating: 3
Got rave reviews from co-workers. I used coarse sea salt which made it more of a salted caramel and nicely offset the sweetness. I have to admit that I did cheat using pre-made cookie dough, but it made for a very easy but elegant dessert (and no one could tell!)

Rating: 4
I've been using this recipe since 2003 and people never seem to get enough of it. It wins every cookie contest and disappears from the dessert tables very quickly! It's easy to do and it's a real crowd pleaser. I find that I don't need to bake the butter cookie base as long (I usually do 10 minutes less) and I cut them into squares as opposed to triangles because they're so decadent that you don't need that big of a bite!

I prepared this recipe yesterday afternoon and found it incredibly easy which was a bonus as I do not enjoy baking. I will cook anything and everything but baking is an art I have not bothered to master. I found the recipe to be terrific and made only one or two minor changes. I sprayed my pan with Pam, lined it with foil and sprayed it again, then put down parchment paper. Nothing stuck and the cookie was not soaking in shortening. And, cleanup was a breeze! I have come to love the current trend of sea salted caramel, so I substituted Italian sea salt for table salt when making the caramel. It was super! And, my extended family love it. Such a simple way to make a classic just a bit different without reinventing the wheel. I can always count on Epicurious to provide great recipes and instructions. Thanks!

Made this as part of our holiday goodie gifts this year. We had had good success with other cookies that used the basic butter cookie as a component (we have the pages from the 2003 Gourmet in our files) and decided to try this one as we had extra pecans. We doubled everything and used 2 9x13 pans. The crusts were thicker than the recipe indicated and the edges did burn using the time allotted. In the end, we just trimmed off the edges and everything was fine. The caramel was a bit of a surprise, with the sugar turning into a huge disc when the cream was added, but we didn't give up and in the end it did dissolve back into the cream and these were to die for. They turned out quite a bit thicker than the recipe and picture seemed to indicate, so we cut them into 1" squares and wrapped them in waxed paper. Everyone that had them raved about them. We would say that they were better than pecan pie, and much richer. After reading the reviews (we didn't know this was available at epicurious before we made them), we would agree with reducing the time that the crust cooks.

FAVORITE holiday cookie- no contest! It took me several batches to get these down to a science, however. I recommend taking at least 10 minutes off the cooking time for the butter cookie base. My first batch was burned beyond recognition, so later batches only stayed in for about 17 minutes. I also recommend using a pot with more surface area on the bottom when making the caramel. Also, be sure to un-tilt the pan after you add the cream. The first few times I made it in a smaller pan and kept it tilted for a while, and I felt like the giant, hard ball of caramel would never melt. With the bigger pot kept flat, the caramel dissolved a LOT more quickly. I love this recipe, and will make it every year for my Christmas Cookie Swap... but only once a year, since these are decadent!!

I started making these cookies for Christmas 2004, and now my sisters demand them every year! They are a little bit of work but totally worth it. Make sure you let the cookies cool completely before even attempting to cut! They are super rich so I cut them in small squares and then on the diagonal to make triangles. They are so yummy!

This sounded so good! But it seems untested - cookie dough was hard, tasteless, and overcooked in less than given time - caramel topping was just uninteresting! How could it be with such good ingredients?.It might be fine if tweaked. (I know my oven temp is fine!)

The pan was to big for the time alotment to cook therefore the under layer was slightly burnt. There was not enough carmel for the 9x13 pan. Overall the level of effort to the cookies was not worth it.

Rating: 2
The caramel topping is excellent however the butter crust is not. It was hard and much too thick. I did the recipe exactly as prescribed and found that the 13 x 9 pan is too small, the thickness of the crust turned out to be double what you see in the picture, the caramel layer was also too thick. The recipe should be made in a standard size cookie sheet. I recommend a classic shortbread base as a substitute for the butter cookie here. Now we're cooking.

I took a chance and added these to my assortment of Christmas cookies this year, and I am so glad I did. I personally thought they were delicious, and I heard back from several friends that they enjoyed them as well. Instead of making the basic butter cookie dough from scratch, I bought a roll of sugar cookie dough from the supermarket and pressed that into the pan. It took less time to bake - about 20 minutes rather than 30 - and it turned out perfect. Also, I found that letting the bars cool on a rack for an hour, then moving them to the refrigerator for the second hour made them just right for cutting and serving (or packing for gifts).

These are truly delicious. Following the suggestion of other reviewers, I too used the Basic Butter Cookie Dough, '95. I used half of the recipe and instead of the 13" x 9" pan, used a 10" x 15" sheet pan. The thickness and the amount of caramel is perfect, making this cookie not overly sweet or rich. Can't wait to put these into my christmas give-away boxes! That is, if I have any left...my husband keeps sneaking them!

Rating: 3
Be careful not to walk away from the pecans when they're toasting. Mine weren't burned, but I think that they're far gone enough to have a bitter aftertaste, which definitely detracts from the cookie. Second, they're extremely messy, and I can't figure out how they can simultaneously be too sticky yet crumbly; the topping didn't want to hold its shape, despite the fact that I cooled them overnight rather than the recommended two hours. I will have to tinker with the recipe because my coworkers love them. I gave them three forks because it's not the fault of the recipe that I overtoasted the pecans. As I made them, I'd give them two forks.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delish! Its very rich, so make sure to cut into pretty small pieces. Also, I would suggest making it the night before you plan on serving it to give the caramel a bit more of a chance to set. It keeps very well, so dont be afraid of it getting stale or anything like that. Also, I followed the other reviews and used the different recipe for the cookie dough base. It was great, and also pretty resilient (I accidentally put way too much flour into the mix and it still turned out great), so I cant really imagine it being better with the included cookie recipe.

So delicious!!! I also used the butter cookie dough recipe other peopler suggested, and it turned out wonderful. If people have issues with it being too gooey, make sure that you cook it in the oven long enough so that it bubbles. Also, making it the night before, and then letting it sit helps keep some of the gooey-ness under control. It also keeps very well, so dont worry about having left-overs, because this recipe WILL make a lot.

This recipe is a wonderful addition to my cooking repertoire. I used the Basic Butter Cookie Dough recipe from '95. The cookie part was great, flaky but not crumbly and not too sweet. Take the time and make the caramel sauce, it is absolutely delicious. It would have been a shame to waste such a good cookie recipe with store bought caramel. I used a 13" x 18" jelly roll pan and reduced the cooking time a little, because I was afraid that the smaller pan would make really big cookies. I will definitely use this pan again, next time I make these. A definite must make cookie that will impress everyone. Enjoy!!

Despite the fact that my dear husband doubled the butter cookie recipe but didn't double the size of the pan, these came out great. It was more of a caramel-pecan topped shortbread, rather than cookie, but it was still wonderful. I brought them to an office party and got many requests for the recipe. Definitely a crowd pleaser!

Rating: 4
This recipe is great! I made it along with a lot of other variations of the basic butter cookie recipe, and this was the biggest crowd pleaser of them all. The dough was really easy to spread in the bottom of the pan, I didn't even chill it first (I put a sheet of wax paper on top of the dough while I rolled it in the pan, it keeps the dough from sticking to the rolling pin and your hands). The caramel did take at least half an hour of stirring, but the taste was really worth it. When I poured the cream into the melted sugar it created a big rock of sugar which I never completely dissolved and had to throw away, but it still made enough caramel to make the dessert work. Once I baked the dessert completely and cooled it, it was really easy (and not messy at all) to cut it into pieces. The only thing different I would do next time is double the recipe so that I could have more to give away.

Too sweet, gooey, time consuming. Crust was falling apart, and topping kept separating from crust. For a similar, but far easier, far better recipe, find Maida Heatter's Book of Great Desserts and use the Pecan Squares Americain recipe.

Well, I didn't find the caramel so easy to make. Mine never really became caramel, but I used it anyway and the cookies tasted good (love the dough on the bottom!!) Mine came out more like little bits of pecan pie. I'll try it again sometime and see if I can achieve caramel.

Rating: 4
Followed the instructions exactly, and it turned out great! A big hit with everyone at the office and at home. I will definitely make it again when I bake Christmas cookies next year. Some tips: to avoid burning the caramel topping, make sure the heat is not too high when you are melting the sugar, and take it off the burner immediately once the caramel melts in the cream. And watch it like a hawk while it's on the burner--caramel sauce is not hard to make, but if it burns even a little bit the taste will be ruined.

Complete failure. The cooking time is too long, the sugar burned and when i put it in the oven, it just made it worse. It tasted burned so I think the cooking time mentioned in this recipe is not accurate.

Made it last night and it was well worth the effort. Took Alice 12/31/03 advice using the basic butter cookie recipe in 1995 Dec. issue of Gourmet. Followed the recipe but I used a large cookie sheet 17'1/2 by 13' and it made 80 triangle cookies. Came out prefect. This recipe will be in my collection book and I will make it again next Christmas. Yummy!!

Used this recipe as the basis for my contribution to the office holiday party and the results were a great success. My changes were: didn't have pecans, so used walnuts; used a different tried-and-true shortbread recipe as the bottom layer; drizzled melted chocolate over the top per other suggestions; used a bigger cookie sheet/jelly roll pan rather than 13x9 since some reviews indicated they were gooey and messy; and added a splash or two of rum to the caramel. Yum, yum, yum!

Rating: 4
AMAZING! I've made these several times, and they're always a hit. I cut them into very small, bite size squares, since they're so rich. Also, the shortbread can easily brown on the sides and corners--I just trim those off, and cut up the rest. A definite keeper!

Rating: 2
Tooth achingly sweet. My only complaint was that the directions for baking the cookie crust for 30 mins. before putting the topping on was too long. 15-20 minutes would have been fine. I ended up frimming off the outer edges because they got too dark and crunchy, tooth breakingly crunchy. I did add about 1/3 C. Meyer's dark rum to the caramel. Great flavor addition.

Rating: 4
Incredible cookie crust - much like a shortbread. I reduced the amount of sugar in the cookie crust. It turned out perfectly flaky and buttery - and didn't compete with the sweet top layer. I was tempted to melt caramels instead of making my own, but it was easy. For the first attempt with a particular recipe, this was a great success!

Everyone raved about these cookies and wanted the recipe - I made several kinds and these disappeared first everywhere I served them. For the crust, I used the basic butter cookie dough recipe from the 1995 December issue of Gourmet. I highly recommend it - it makes more of a shortbread - a little less sweet. Be sure to bake these long enough. I underbaked mine the first time but that didn't stop people from inhaling them!

This got a rave from my co-workers and family. I used a variant method on the topping, similar to my family's caramel icing recipe. I caramelized 1/2 cup of the sugar, and added it to the rest of the sugar and cream which was heating to a simmer on another burner while the caramel was being cooked. The advantage is that the caramel does not lump as much-- sometimes it doesn't lump at all.

While I can see how these could be considered excellent, but they are just far too sweet. Obviously, seeing as they're pretty much straight sugar I knew they were going to be sweet, but they're just too cloyingly sweet. Although quite easy and fast to make, I wouldn't make these again because their extreme sweetness and messniness/stickiness just isn't conducive to entertaining. And I was so excited about them too....oh well. Liked the brownie squares in this issue much better.

I made 7 dozen for a cookie exchange. It was a lot of work and very time-consuming but in the end it was worth it. Be willing to put some time in on this recipe.

They were very delicicious but required some labor but they are impressive.

Yummy and delicious! I made a double batch to bring to a cookie exchange and to the office. It was the favorite at the exchange and gone in minutes, with raves, at the office. This is very easy to make and, because of the caramel, tastes much better than a pecan pie. The only part that takes a little care is in making the caramel, which needs to be watched. To those who said this cookie was crumbly, try patting the dough in the pan firmly without overworking it. Mine stayed intact and cut easily with a chef's knife. As a variation, next time I'm going to coat the top with tempered chocolate before cutting and make it into chocolate turtle cookies. Low in calories, it's not!

I just made the caramel pecan topping, using my own cookie recipe. The topping was wonderful, although a bit messy. (That may have something to do w/ the fact that I tried to pour it over individual cookies, hollowed in the center). It's also fairly rich, but seeing as I made it for a Christmas party, I think everyone expects desserts like that. Vanilla gives it a nice, smooth flavor - be sure to use a high quality vanilla extract. Would be incredible over fresh vanilla bean ice cream.

I was trying to bake three things at once and accidentally neglected to bake the cookie crust prior to putting the caramel mixture on top. Even with that mistake, it came out GREAT!

Very easy recipe even for a beginner!

These are only ok....I won't bother making them again. The sugar cookie base just isn't 'shortbread' enough for this topping...and the topping is time consuming if you are doing much holiday baking. I much prefer the Dec 95 Gourmet butter cookies with several variations.
