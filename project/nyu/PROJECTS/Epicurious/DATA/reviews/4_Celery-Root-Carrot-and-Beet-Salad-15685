the dressing is really nice - I used 1/4 c oil . The beets didn't fit texturally so I used a watermelon radish & make this almost like a slaw & add greens at the very last minute. We love it with arugula!

Very tasty, indeed--just had it at brunch today and everyone enjoyed it. Kept the beets out until the end and used walnuts and and herbed goat cheese. I like my dressing a bit more on the acidic side, so next time I'll increase the vinegar and bring down the oil, the dressing recipe makes exactly enough for the salad.

Loved the flavors and composition. Not so fond of taking an hour to julienne the vegetables, though it was the right thing to do for the best texture.

Beautiful presentation. Easy and a great fall salad. Toasted walnuts are a good substitute. Very nice and will definitely make again.

I skipped the carrots and the color was great! The flavor is so good and the texture is a nice accompiament to roasts or meat.

Tasty. I used champagne vinegar and a bit of rice wine vinegar and it came out fine. I also nuked the carrots and used canned beets. Though purists will gasp it made it easier to do the recipe.

A very nice presentation, as you get the orange of carrots, white celery root, and red beets. I agree with the need to be very careful with the beets, as they stain everything they come into contact with, so mix the salad at the last possible minute.

I wish there were a 2.5 forks choice. I really liked this salad. I thought the dressing was great; I thought the colors were great, and I thought that it was impressive to serve. I just don't really like cold beets. I would probably serve this as a warm salad next time, and maybe add some crumbled bacon. I haven't got it all worked out yet, but the salad has great potential.

The colors alone make this salad a feast for the eyes as well as for the tummy. However, don't make the mistake I did; I did not pay close attention and mixed the beets with the carrots and celery root and ended up with topping that slowly turned dark pink! Luckily I was serving close friends and we had a good laugh. I made all of the dressing as directed but did not toss all into the salad and had enough left over for another salad the next day. Toasted pecans worked well.

Excellent1 Very different and interesting salad. Not hard to make, just be careful not to overcook the vegetables. The dressing is very interesting.

The dressing for this salad is delicious though perhaps I would try and cut down the amount of olive oil for dietry reasons only. Nevertheless, it will become a "favoured" salad recipe when I want something a little more special. I used spinach and pumkin seeds in place of the latter two ingredients and they worked really well.
