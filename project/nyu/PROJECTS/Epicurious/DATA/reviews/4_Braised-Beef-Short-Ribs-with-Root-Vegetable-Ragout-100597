This was so good. Served at a dinner party and our friends all had second helpings. It was easy, delicious and a keeper for future dinners. We did skim off quite of a bit of the fat.

Really delicious! I made the root veggies that go with it, too, and they were also wonderful. Lots of work though!

This recipe was wonderful and easy. It got rave reviews from my father who ran a Nebraska "steak house" for 45 years and knows his beef. He said they were the best short ribs he'd ever eaten!

Rich, deep flavors. This was delicious. Don't even think about not browning the ribs first. Only problem I had was that the cooking time was too long and the meat had almost totally fallen of the bone. Easy to correct though, by just keeping an eye on it.

After reading the reviews I made this dish for a dinner party and was underwhelmed. Admittedly, I took a short cut. After marinating overnight and searing I put it in the crockpot on low instead of braising in the oven. I also used boneless short ribs b/c I doubled the recipe and short ribs w/bones were too big for the pan. After a few hours of cooking I thought the sauce was too flat and added tomato paste, a few chopped onions and some chili sauce for a bit of spice. Definitely perked it up but for all the time and mess of preparing the marinade and the other steps, this was definitely not worth it. My brisket takes 1/10th of the prep time and I'm certain my dinner party guests would have far preferred this.

This turned out to be one of the best make ahead winter dishes EVER. The flavor is multilayerd and rich. I also did not have veal stock but used beef stock instead, am not sure how the veal stock could have improved this dish. If we could award ten forks we would...

An excellent recipe, easily scaled up for a large group. It is essential to brown the ribs thoroughly to creat the most flavor. Also, the only veal stock I could get was quite pale so I subsituted half veal stock and half demi-glace. Will definitely make again.

A great receipe! I did not have veal stock, so I substituted homemade beef stock. Marinated for 24 hours instead of 8.
