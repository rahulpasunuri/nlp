I have made this many times, and it is excellent. Based on the last review, I may try adding lemon juice this time.

This is a very solid eggplant olive base. The mix of eggplant to olives to capers is just right. Check your eggplant after 40 minutes to be sure you don't overcook it. I have tried many different add-ins with this base with wonderful results... lemon juice, garlic, green onions... have fun.

Delicious! I doubled the recipe. It was better the next day, sserved at room temperature.

First, since I was short on time, I broiled the eggplants for about 20 minutes - worked fine. Then after blending, it needed something. We added Cumin...it was a great addition. Probably making a day ahead would be even better to let the flavors blend.

Since I like the taste of all of the ingredients, I liked the flavor of the spread with pita bread. However, I cooked my one pound eggplant for exactly 50 minutes and it was over cooked. It needed draining. I also recommend making it ahead and chilling the spread and then bringing it back to room temperature for serving.

I have tried many recipes in this website and all of them have turned out fine. I did as required but found the taste quite horrible. The olives didnt go well with the eggplant. What should it taste like?

Wonderful flavor and so easy to prepare. There is another similar recipe on this website: Roasted Eggplant & Olive Spread w/Pita Bread Chips which had garlic in the ingredients so I added minced garlic and it was a great addition. I did not add any oil to the puree.
