I didn't have any tomatoes on hand, so I just made the lamb chops with the spices, and served some cauliflower puree on the side. Very good dinner with very little effort.

A quick and delicious recipe, a taste of "méditérannée". I added a zucchini with the tomatoes for a more colorfull dish. Great with couscous and a bottle of Cahors type of wine.
