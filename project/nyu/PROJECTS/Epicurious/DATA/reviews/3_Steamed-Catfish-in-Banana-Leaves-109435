Excellent! The banana leaves were much easier to handle than expected. I used our multi-pot for steaming. There's a great Thai grocery store (Sunrise Grocery) on Brighton Ave. in Brighton, MA that had the curry paste. I substituted lemongrass for the Kaffir lime leaves (couldn't find them anywhere) with good results.

I followed the directions for preparing the catfish exactly since this was my first time cooking fish this way and it turned out well. Everyone cleaned their plate. I served it with coconut rice & eggplant & greenbeans.

For Cook in Los Angeles CA: Like Long Beach said, you should be able to locate banana leaves at an Asian market. If you live in or near SFV, you may want to try Tai Lee in Canoga Park. I've found that is my favorite Asian market to go to (it's pretty well-stocked). They also have live catfish if you want to ensure the freshness of your catfish.

I have not made this recipe yet, but banana leaves may be purchased at Pacificrim.com. They keep in the freezer for six months and I can truly say that they are wonderful with fish. I have a grouper recipe that is to die for!

>>A Cook from Los Angeles, CA on 05/11/04 I would like to try this recipe. Where can I purchase banana leaves?<< --I haven't tried it yet, but the first place I'll look for banana and kaffir leaves is an ethnic supermarket perhaps Asian or Latin...if you live in LA (I live in Long Beach,) I can't imagine that these two ingredients would be too impossible to find, cuz of all our diversity... Gardena has a huge number of Asian speciality markets, as does Long Beach & heck...maybe Pavillions, Gelsons or Whole Foods will be able to help...good luck! In my experience, people at speciality markets are BORN helpful and will point you in the right direction. I'll be trying this out in the next few weeks & will post back at that time.

You know how important it is to have the appropriate name? Well, Crisco Kid says it all. It conjures an image of ignorance and "lard ass" mentality. The recipe is ethnic. It is simple and delicious. Too bad you won't enjoy it.

Hey Crisco kid, maybe if you had cut out the Crisco a little sooner, your "life partner" wouldn't have become obese. As for putting catfish, or any kind of fish for that matter, into banana leaves, it's a fantastic way to get a great flavor! And a pretty presentation too.

Seems that Crisco Maryland's "rules" on how to enjoy fish recipes are a bit ethno-centric, ignorant, and downright stupid. The banana leaves impart flavor, and Southerners did not write the book on catfish.

Wow, that was petty NY, NY...very ignorant considering that Californians are more health conscious than New Yorkers. I really doubt anyone really cares that you felt a Filipino claimed this dish and if you read more carefully...he said he tried fried catfish before...so go belittle someone else...it's just a recipe! By the way, Asians aren't the only ones who cook this way.

As previously noted, this is a classic dish that Asians & Pacific Islanders have prepared for many years. Filippinos, such as myself, prepare various foods in banana leaves to both add flavor & lock in juice/keep moisture. Although I love fried catfish-one should not be closed minded in preparing fish this way or you would really be missing out!

I liked this recipe...banana leaves are a great way to cook a variety of meats. I buy them frozen at a mexican or asian market.

Oh, please. This is a classic Thai and Cambodian preparation, very flavorful with a wonderful texture when prepared well. Just wallow in your Crisco, while the rest of us enjoy Southeast Asian cuisine.

I would like to try this recipe. Where can I purchase banana leaves?

Rating: 0
Please nobody be angry because I have not yet tried the recipe. I just want to bring to everyones attention to the fact that the fish is wrapped in the banana leaf to avoid its loosing taste, just in case the previous review puts you off trying this dish out.

As a southerner growing up in the chesapeak bay area of Maryland I take issue with recipe from the start. With my life partner now on a limited diet for obesity, and a heart condition fish and vegies have become a main stay in our diet. I will not and cannot condone this treatment of catfish preparation no matter how evolved my culinary talents are pushed. Steamed sea food is wonderful however when it comes to fresh water fish the only two ways to prepare it so as to keep its flavor or incorporate other complements is to poach it or bake it. Steaming fresh water seafood is like washing sea food with soap your tongue will not appreciate it at all. In closing if your not on a heart smart diet, please remember that the best way to enjoy catfish is to fry it....enough said.

Tasty low-calorie dish. No banana or kaffir lime leaves in MS -- but we got plenty of collards (and catfish)! Worked fine to replace the banana leaves and I substituted grated lime zest for the kaffir leaves. Tasty!
