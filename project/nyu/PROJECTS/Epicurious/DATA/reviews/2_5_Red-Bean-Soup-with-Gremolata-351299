I don't think it's 2.5 q of water. Probably 2.5 tsp lol

For gremolata: 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest 1 garlic clove, minced 1/4 cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley 2 1/2 quarts water 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 2 1/2 quarts of "water"?????????

Um...the last two ingredients from the soup were included in the gremolata recipe by mistake. Leave those off and you'll be fine!

ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. I threw it out!! There is no flavor at all, despite the fact that it smelled great. Negative flavor. Also too watery. This recipe seemed promising but fails to deliver in every way.

I used more peppers than called for, more paprika, more garlic, and added some jalapenos, too. This recipe is great as long as you figure out how to fiddle with it -- otherwise, it's too bland. Many guests loved it. I watched the liquid and made it in a consistency I liked,

This was better after it sat around for a couple of days. The gremolata was the key to the whole thing and was really good. Just don't add the last two ingredients on the list. That appears to be a mistake from the soup portion of the recipe.

I took some of the suggestions from the previous reviews, using chicken stock instead of water and adding an additional Hungarian wax pepper for some more depth. I also added a full teaspoon of sweet paprika instead of the half in the recipe. It gave it more kick. Using half the liquid recommended also made it a thicker, heartier soup. The gremolata is a must--and drizzle some of the oil from the sundried tomatoes for some extra flavor.

This recipe was quite disappointing. The soup's consistency is not unlike watery refried beans; the peppers give it little heat or flavor. I would suggest using hotter peppers, chicken stock rather than water, and upping the spice quotient quite a bit. Also, if I made it again (which I won't), I would only puree half of the mixture to give the soup some sort of texture. Indeed, the next night I cooked off the excess liquid and used the soup for bean burritos--this was far superior to the soup by itself!

Very watery...what did I do wrong?
