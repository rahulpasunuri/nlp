This is one of my favorite dishes to keep on hand. I love it for a quick and easy to take along lunch. It's wonderful at room temperature so it's perfect for picnics too. I also cut the recipe to make a smaller batch. I add what ever veggies I have on hand at the time. My favorite is frozen peas! I agree you must like the tartness of lemon, but you can add any spice you fancy!

Similar to tabbouleh but without tomatoes, the salad is tart and light. I loved the dill. One fourth made a family size salad. I added lemon juice to heated water to cover the bulghur.

Delicious, easy and pretty close to authentic tabboulah if you omit the red bell pepper and use seeded, plum tomatoes instead. The other thing I changed was to cut down on the oil (used 6 oz water + 4 oz oil). It's a refreshing make-ahead salad for summer but you must like the flavor of dill, mint and parsley.
