Excellent, and, oh, so easy! It is so rich that it was hard to convince my family that it was not a cream based soup. I used regular cabbage and a chunk of leftover ham. After pureeing the soup per the instructions, you can add cooked chopped carrots or serve with croutons.

I'll make it again. I made it with a lot of modifications, for various reasons. I give my version 4 forks; I have no idea how it compares to the original. My modifications: 1) no onions, because I'm fighting reflux. Instead, I used about 6 crimini mushrooms, because I figured that they'd give some body and some nice earthiness. 2) 10 oz of American, but non-cured bacon (it's what we had). I adore the flavor of Vermont Smoke & Cure's maple brined/cob smoked bacon. 3) no butter; previous reviewers recommended sauteeing in the bacon fat, and since I was worried about losing the onion flavor, I did it that way. 4) I had cabbage from the CSA, and it may have been a napa cabbage, not a savoy. It seemed to work. I could have used more. Other than these minor changes... :) I followed the recipe and included my homemade stock. It came out wonderfully. I used an immersion blender right in the soup pot and it was quick. I blended half the bacon with the soup and added the rest back in at the end. I love the texture of the soup, and the flavor was heavenly: smoky, rich, just right for a crisp fall or winter dinner with some dark sourdough multigrain bread (which we sadly didn't have), and butter. We added in large dollops of sheep/goat full-fat yogurt. If I had access to a chest freezer, I'd double or triple this recipe, so as to have a quart + for leftovers and a quart + to freeze for later in the winter.

i went with the ingredients as listed, but opted for rustic style. i started by cooking the onions in bacon fat.my hubby likes thick soup so i used only 4 cups homemade stock, and doubled the potatoes. i used russets and left the skin on for more flavor and texture. i used a whole small head of green cabbage rather than savoy. i removed half the veggies before blending the soup in the pot. i added 12 ounces diced roast pork shoulder at the end. we dunked in some leftover crusts of ciabatta, a decent substitute for soda bread. a simple, satisfying meal in a pot for a wintery night.

Had to chime in again ... Irish bacon is not bacon in the American sense. It is actually a big hunk of pork. In Ireland, streaky rashers = bacon and even then, they aren't all that common. Regular rashers, which are not smoked and look like think slices of ham with a lovely rimming of fat. And I also thought it was odd that a 1/3 lb measurement was given, I usually find it in 2-3 lb cuts.

I made this last night and it was quite good. A few changes: added in fresh broccoli and carrots. -Used bacon (with fat trimmed off before cooking) -Didn't use butter and used bacon grease as substitute

Used applewood smoked bacon, two slices, cooked with onion as suggested by other users. This soup was easy and delicious.

I know it was really not suggested but it still tasted delicious using smoked bacon, I was in a time crunch and didn't have time to hunt down a suitable replacement. I also made the mistake of using a chicken broth with salt in it, and then adding more! Luckily I did consider that a little and went a bit easier then the recipe suggested on salt. It turned out really well for being such an easy preparation soup. Next time, no salt in the broth... or no extra kosher salt.

We loved this soup! I made it the traditional Irish way and served it with soda bread... brought back fond memories of our trip to Ireland. Unfortunately it is difficult to find Irish bacon outside of the larger cities here in the States but if you want the true flavor of Ireland don't use regular bacon ~ substitute Canadian bacon if you can't find the real thing. I found some on my last trip to Philadelphia and bought extra for the freezer. There's nothing better, in my book, than to sit down to a platter of Bacon and Cabbage with Parsley Sauce with a slab of Soda Bread.. but this comes darn close :)

Just an FYI. Smoked bacon is NOTHING like Irish boiling bacon so if you are looking for a substitute, stick with a salt cured and NOT a smoke cured product. So, American-style bacon is really deviating from the recipe but I'm still it's sure good. Who doesn't like American style bacon? If you want to try and order the boiling bacon online try foodireland.com or if you live in a city with a big Irish population (I'm in the suburbs of Boston) you might be able to find boiling bacon at the local convenience stores to towns with lots of Irish locals.

Bacon in soup? Yes, please! To cut way down on the fat, I used turkey bacon, and omitted the butter. The big flavor addition I used was rosemary--approx 3 tablespoons of the fresh stuff--minced and sauteed with loads of garlic and shallots. Also, to add more bulk, I brought some carrots and celery to the party; glad I invited them ;)

Wow. This is a truly delicious soup! I noticed that most of the reviewers here made modifications, so if youre wondering about the original recipe, I followed it exactly, and it turned out fabulous. It is now in our very favorites category. We paired it with panini-grilled pumpernickel bread and a light arugula, strawberry, grilled Halloumi salad. Awesome weeknight dinner.

I was surprised how good this was. Yes, it isn't pretty, and do cut the salt if you're using a salt-cured ham product in place of the Irish bacon. I made this once with regular bacon and left it partly chuncky, but the ham-like Irish bacon and total puree was WAY superior. Really simple, hearty and delicious.

I used green cabbage, baking potatoes, and regular bacon. Put the bacon right in the pot and cooked, then browned the onions in the fat instead of butter, then added the broth and potatoes and followed instructions from there. So easy with my new immersion blender! Really ugly, but very tasty and satisfying.

So simple and so delicious. I used Niman Ranch smoked bacon, diced it and cooked it with the butter and onion.

This soup is really simple and tasty! I followed almost exactly, except I used "cottage bacon" from the butcher. I chopped it and cooked it with the onion, rather than boiling(didn't need to add the butter.) I also omitted the Turkish bay leaves, because I didn't have any. For saving time, I used bagged, shredded cabbage. The soup is just as good reheated.

Used red cabbage instead of green because my kids like it better. When pureed, it is just BEAUTIFUL. Such a pretty purple color. Also used turnips instead of potatoes, though next time, I think we'll use both turnip and potato. And for the bacon, I used pork back bacon, and it was very yummy.

Quick to make and surprisingly fantastic flavor considering the simplicity of the ingredients. In place of the Irish or Canadian bacon I used 4 oz. of Niman Ranch's Natural Applewood smoked bacon (from Trader Joe's), chopped crosswise into 1/2-inch chunks and cooked in the stock pot until light brown. Then added the onion, potatoes, stock, etc. The only other differences were a single California bay leaf in place of the Turkish and based on other reviews, I skipped the puree step. The perfect soup for a chilly gray day.

I didn't know what to do with the cabbage I had so I was looking at soup recipes and decided to give this one a whirl. It was easy, it was delicious and it was substantial. Perfect for a cool fall or winter day.

My husband and I love this soup. It's good with some leftover ham too! I puree it and don't have exorcist thoughts, just looks like a creamy soup. Enjoy!

It's funny, but my hubby agreed with "frenchfriend from Seattle" & remarked that it looked like something from The Exorcist, even though it smelled good. To me, it was just ok....nothing special. And I agree with others as well in that next time I would not puree it. Some soups, especially a heart one such as this, should be chunky or have a little texture. I would have preferred it that way.

I don't know that this was 100% four forks, but it was such a light dish. I cut down the butter to 1 tbsp and added some cauliflower because it was going to go bad... other than that all the same. It tasted great, was inexpensive, and contained few fattening ingredients. I recommend it heartily.

If I were to make this again, I would not puree it. The flavor was good but the light green thick mushy texture reminded me of "The Exorcist". I think I would also try regular bacon instead of Irish/Canadian bacon for more flavor.

If you substitute 4 bay leaves for "turkish" bay leaves you will have an uneatable mess. The chemical taste of bay was so strong I had to throw it away. the recipe should warn of this possibility.

Mmm....as an Irish girl, this is really a comfort food. I have made it a few times with bacon (2 or 3 strips), cooked in the butter with the onion. It's faster and tastes wonderful - and a little bit healthier than a big chunk of meat, but without losing flavor.

super simple to make, good result. i stuck quite closely to the recipe, except i used 100g of unsmoked lardons in place of the irish bacon (just try finding that here in france!) and sautéed them with the onions, then puréed everything together at the end, resulting in a smooth velouté. strangely enough, the bay leaf-bacon combo reminds me powerfully of my mother's split pea soup - and i hate split pea soup, but i like this savoy cabbage soup.

Easy delicious warming winter soup. I made the canadian bacon but decided the soup was tasty enough without it, so saved it for another meal. Added 1/4 t cinnamon and 1 keffir lime leaf, and used rich home made beef broth. Will make this again for sure.

I made this soup once using 5 slices of regular strip bacon instead of Irish bacon and it was delicious! I thought it was so rich that I could double the recipe with the same amount of bacon but it came out way too watery. Then I had twice as much mediocre soup to force on my small family. Because I made the two batches within a week of one another, I overdosed on it so I won't be making it again. But if you stick to the recipe and only double it if you have a lot of mouths to feed at once, then I think it's a divine soup.

So happy to have found this recipe. I did a healthier version using turkey bacon and browned it with the onion. I also used low sodium broth (added very little additional salt). Also, I substituted cannellini and butter beans in place of potatoes. I left the soup chunky. It was tasty, filling, and quite healthy. What more could you ask?

I made this recipe last night (except I used smoked ham in place of the bacon) and it was quite tastey. I had leftovers tonight and the soup is even more delicious than the night before. This is something I will make again and again.

I doubled this recipe and used leftover ham instead of bacon. Ham was pretty salty even after boiling, so I cut the salt in the recipe by half. Good recipe for St. Patrick's Day communal lunch at the office - or for any blustery day. Very good!

Loved the recipe. Used regular bacon that was fried crisply as Irish and Canadian bacon are nearly impossible to get here. Only blended half the veg so there would be chunky bits. Practiced restraint on the seasoning so that guests could season to their taste. Recipe is a keeper!

What a treat for a cold snowy March evening! I added a few carrots that I had on hand, used regular bacon, and added cayenne and a pepper mixture to my taste. I thickened the broth with a potato boiled in the bacon water, mashed and mixed in. My guest for dinner had two bowls, saying it's a delicious treat.

Super good! I needed a way to get rid of half a Savoy cabbage, which I'd decided never to buy again, but after making this soup I will. I have a non-meat- eater in the household, so I used a herb broth and replaced the bacon with very leathery oily sundried tomatoes. Travesty? Maybe, but a delicious one. Only complaint is that if you use a stock with any sodium in it at all, two teaspoons of salt tastes like a bit much. And I also used an immersion blender and it was fine. Don't mess around with back-and- forthing near- boiling liquids with a standing blender!

I had some left over cabbage from a stuffed cabbage (the inner leaves). Thought a soup might be interested. Attempted to follow this receipe exactly but as I was making it, found it needed more uph. Read the other reviews and picked & chose what sounded good. I may some alterations. I added more pepper and less salt, used regular bacon and about a 1/4 pound of kielbasa (cooked first before boiling. Drained and patted excess grease dry. I would suggest to boil the bacon the day before or several hours before using and cooling it in the refrigerator. It is easier to remove the grease. Used the boiled water as suggested by another reviewer with the stock. I added more pepper than recommended. I only used two potatoes but in the future would use one or two more. Added a couple dashes of cayanne pepper to give a little more kick. I only pureed half the soup (remember to place t-towel over top of blender to prevent splashing. Returned to pot adding some 1/2 & 1/2 to thicken the soup. In the future, I would add celery and other vegetables for a good way to get a daily allotment of veggies. Be sure to check the labels of chicken both. Some have high sodium content. Even though I reduced the salt content I thought it was slightly more salty for my personal taste.

Delicious and simple. Used uncured Canadian bacon as I could not find true Irish bacon. The water did not foam when it was cooked and smelled strongly of bacon, so I added it to the soup liquid instead of discarding it. Cabbage was tender enough to use an immersion blender. Kids even liked it.
