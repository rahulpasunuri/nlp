This was a big hit at my dinner party. The flavor was good, but it was a little oily -- I'd use less oil next time. Also, I think I'd add some heat -- maybe a serrano pepper.

This was wonderful. We used fresh peaches picked from a relative's farm and took the suggestion of adding serrano chile. The texture and flavor of the peaches really lend themselves well to salsa making. This was not overly sweet. A welcome change to tired tomato stuff on the chips.

I have made this recipie three times. It is perfect for grilled/smoked leg-o-lamb. I have even added more oil and vinegar, plus serrano peppers.

Nice, but it could use some red onion to tone down the fruit sweetness and the oil. Or maybe a little more vinegar. It's a good recipe to experiment with.

Since fresh peaches are seasonal, I used canned. I also recommend marinating longer than 2 hrs. This was a perfect condiment to lamb.
