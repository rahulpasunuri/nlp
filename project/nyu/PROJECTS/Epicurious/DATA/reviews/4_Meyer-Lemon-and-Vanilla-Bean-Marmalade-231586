Although most recipes say that Meyer lemons have enough pectin in their seeds to gel really well, I have found that unless I want to cook this until it is really dark, i,e to a very high temp, it is necessary to add a box of fruit pectin to MY lemons (grown in my yard, Houston, TX). That makes it more the consistency of marmalade inpurchased in stores. Your call on how dense you want it to be.

Delicious recipe!! I will definitely make this again. I cooked for more than 30 minutes and it wasn't reaching the temp the recipe called for, so stopped at 220 and consistency was fine. Canned 3 8 oz and 5 4 oz jars.

A great use for my first crop of meyer lemons. I cut the sugar by about a quarter cup and would not cut more than that. I stirred constantly for about 20 minutes and the temperature reached 227, and I stopped. The final product was a little too loose for my taste so next time I will go to 230 degrees.

Delicious! Used half a vanilla bean and the flavor was perfect. Turned it off at 218 degrees and marmalade was too thick, will stop earlier next time - and there definitely will be a next time!

I have made this recipe 3 times now: once without canning and twice with canning. I love it. It does need less sugar for my taste. I use about half or 2/3 as much. I also like to supreme the fruit if I am giving it as a gift. Just using the pulp and peel makes the marmalade look spectacular. Don't worry about hitting the temperature. I don't think that I have ever hit the specified temperature on a marmalade recipe. Using the chilled plate method, it usually turns out just the right thickness. I also put the extra segments, seeds, and pith in a jelly bag, and left it sit overnight with the peels. It helps the thickening by adding extra pectin. I have always given some away and gotten rave reviews. I just wish that I could find organic meyer lemons for this.

I made this again with half the vanilla and now I can't stop eating it. Best marmalade I've ever had. Making it again right now.

I followed the recipe exactly except I used only 4 cups of sugar and that was plenty. Maybe my vanilla bean was exceptionally large, but I found that the vanilla overwhelmed the Meyer lemons. Still good, could be better. I will use half a bean next time.

Delicious! The vanilla bean takes a little of the edge off the lemons. My electric range barely and begrudgingly limped all the way up to 220 for the recommended time and jelling was perfect. 2.5 pounds of lemons yielded enough marmalade to fill 8 5oz canning jars - perfect size for gifting and damned cute besides.

We've done this twice now and really like it. The only suggestion is to quit cooking at about 223-224 degrees. We toughed it out to 228the first time, and the consistency on that batch was rather thick. I ended up relying on the tried and true cold plate method to find our optimum thickness and found we didn't need it to get all the way to thread temperature.

love this - made with 5 meyer and 1 regular which gave 3 cups of lemon/juice. Continued with the proportions in the recipe and filled 8 1/2 pint jars. First time cooked to 230 and it took forever. 2nd time cooked to 220 - still a long time but not as long and it was just as firm.

I just finished making my second batch of this marmalade. It is absolutely delicious!! It makes a beautiful gift, I make sure to put a vanilla bean segment in each jar. I did not agree with the recipe as to temperature of the finished product. I tested mine with the chilled plate/wrinkle method, and it was perfect at 222 degrees. After cooling, this batch was the perfect consistency. I processed the pint jars in a water bath for 10 minutes. All my friends are very happy with my recent jam/marmalade adventures!!! The flavor of this marmalade is lemony orange, with a very warm back note from the vanilla. Perfect on homemade english muffins.

Wonderful recipe! I made it with regular lemons (we either don't have Meyer or they are not distinguished) and it turned out great - not too sweet, with just a hint of the bitterness. I didn't leave the vanilla bean in, because I split the batch in small jars to give as gifts. The thermometer never got to 110 C, but the marmalade jellied perfectly. I would definitely make it again!

Delicious. I made this with the few remaining meyer lemons from my tree. I followed the earlier tip and canned the jars in a hot water bath. The consistency is beautiful - nice presents for the few jars I'm willing to part with!

I REALLY wanted to love this recipe since I adore meyer lemons, but I found it very disappointing. I'm hoping that the flavor might develop as other reviewers suggest. All of the distinctive flavor of the meyer lemon seems to have evaporated and it simply tastes like regular marmalade--with strong vanilla overtones. I processed it in two ways. Most of the batch was processed in a hot water bath (which I think makes the color very dark) I had a small bit left over and no more jelly jars so I've refrigerated that one. Personally, I don't think I could eat that much marmalade in two weeks, so I think doing a proper canning is essential. Thus far, I've only tasted the 'fridge batch and it's just "okay". I think there are better things to do with meyers (lemon buttermilk sorbet and preserved lemons, for example)

This is THE BEST lemon marmalade. It is beautiful to look at with the peels, bean and little specks and tastes fantastic. At first i didn't think the lemon flavor was strong enough and had a mixed flavor (more vanilla-ish) but after a week, the lemon flavor really kicks in. This is the go-to recipe for lemon marmalade. You will fully maximize the meyers, and we know they are precious!

The flavor & aroma of this marmalade is exceptional. I put up 3-4 different fruit preserves a year and this is by far my favorite. I have altered the recipe slightly because I enjoy a whole fruit consistency & process it in the canner, but I believe the flavor is perfect either way. I love this stuff so much, I'm planning on getting a Meyer lemon tree to grow indoors so I can have a steady supply of this stuff. YUM!

Very good. Everyone who has eaten this, loved it.

I have made this recipe twice. The second time I doubled the recipe which was a mistake because it "browned" meaning almost burned - my fault. Makes great gifts, my UK friends love it.

Just made this for the 3rd time in two years. It's fantastic & the only way I've found to use a lot of lemons. The consistency has always come out perfect. For more versatility, this time I used 1/2 the sugar and extra juice so that it can be served as a sauce over gingerbread.

I made this a few days ago. Very easy. It didn't "gel" like I'm used to seeing marmalades in the store (even though I boiled it to the proper temperature), but is more of the consistency of a "spoonable" marmalade. The taste is incredibe! And the vanilla bean floating in the middle is just beautiful! I plan to secure a long, thin "espresso" spoon to the jar (I made them in 1 pint jars, 7 of them, one of which is mine) to let gift receivers know how to use it. A butter knife will probably not suffice. I made labels for the jars identifying the contents using the fresh Meyer lemons as a faded backdrop and a vanilla bean. All and all in great presentation and a gift I, personally, would love to receive. I hope my recipients feel the same. I would make this again, as I LOVE Meyer lemons.

I made this exactly to recipe and gave some jars away as gifts. It was very pretty and received rave reviews. For safety, do be sure to read up on sterilization techniques if you are new to canning

i just tried this recipe, cutting it in half for the first time, and it's very tasty (although i'd probably reduce the amount of sugar next time). can anyone explain why the marmalade became almost unspreadably hardened after refrigerating?

I've made this recipe 2 years in a row to rave reviews both times. I wouldn't worry about perserving the marmalade as it is so good, it won't stick around. I've added this review to help up the overall % - it really deserves it. Enjoy!

This jam is soooo wonderful! Make sure to use the Meyer lemons, canning is great because you can enjoy the jam long after the lemons are out of season. Also makes a good gift.

I made two batches of this with my lemons, canned it in Weck jars (pretty!), and my whole family loves it. My only complaint: I still have too many lemons on my tree!

This marmalade was the perfect way to use up my lemons. Gave it away as gifts and received rave reviews from everyone. The vanilla bean added a wonderful flavor to the already perfect lemons. Thank you for the canning info, it will be nice to have some on hand when Meyer lemon season is long past.

This is good, and easy. How unfair for the first three reviewers to have rated this without ever having made it. I'm glad I overlooked the 25%, 1 1/2 fork rating and tried the recipe. Keep stirring while the marmalade is cooking or the peels will carmelize, not a bad taste at all but it made the marmalade look orange. I love the flavor of the vanilla with the lemon! I cut the bean in four pieces after scraping out the seeds so that a piece could go into each canning jar.

Please don't use paraffin. It shrinks and expands with the varying weather temperatures thereby allowing bacteria into the product. Instead, leave a 1/4-inch headspace (distance from the rim of the jar to the top of the product) and apply 2-piece lids treated according to manufacturers dirctions. Process in a simmering hot water bath at 190 degrees F. for 10 minutes. (Hot water bath - can use a stock pot with a cake rack on the bottom. Jars should never touch the bottom of the pot. Leave a space between jars. Water should cover the jars by at least 1-inch to 2 inches. Start timing when the water remp. reaches 190 F.)Bernardin has a website and sells 2-piece canning lids.

Other than the vanilla bean, it looks like a pretty standard marmalade recipe to me.I'd pour it straight from the stove into sterilized jars, and top with melted paraffin.

This looks really good and I would like to try and make it. But, for two of us, it makes a lot more than we can eat in 2 weeks. Some preserving tips would have been useful. If anyone has any ideas, I would appreciate your posting your tip(s). Thanks.
