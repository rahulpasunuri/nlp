This was very easy, and very bland. If I try it again, I will season much more liberally, and add something with a bit of kick. Honestly, I'd rather make a roux and white sauce, and have it taste like something.

Fabulous. Panic on Xmas day. I had made the Julia Child recipe for a friend's dinner party then told more needed. This was quick, almost same ingredients except all I had was heavy cream. Used half Emmenthaler, half gruyere. A little less elegant than Julia's but really just as good with much less work.

I like to make it with blue cheese. It's delicious!

I used 300g potatoes with 100ml half-fat cream and 150ml milk. I didn't pre-boil the potatoes but simply baked in 180 c oven for 55-60mins. I added half a minced garlic. Was yummy.

I've made this every Christmas for 5 year's to serve with Ham. It's soooo much easier then layering ! Only thing I do differently is add about 1/4 tsp. ground white pepper & 2 or 3 fresh thyme sprigs to the pot, removing the stem's before putting into the baking dish. OH, also set the dish on a rimmed pan in case it bubble's over.

I made the recipe as written and found it to be tasty! The Gruyère cheese adds tons of flavor creating a golden crust on the top. Potatoes are moist and delightful. Try this you'll like. Adding other flavors will probably be fun too. As written though, it's tasty enough as is...

My family loves this recipe. Used some whole milk in place of the half and half and added a dash of nutmeg.

Doubled this for an 11 person dinner party and it was a hit. It was a little soupy on the bottom, maybe because I ran out of half and half used more milk than half and half, but everyone still loved it. Also did the Panko crumbs suggested by another reviewer which worked well.

I've made this dish often and it's always a crowd pleaser. I follow the recipe, but some of the additions from other reviews, like the breadcrumbs on top, sound great. Make this - you won't be sorry.

This is by no means the end all be all of Dauphinois, but it most certainly provides a quick delicious base recipe. My addition: i slice one vidalia onion (same thickness as potato) and treat it as it was potato after that. It reminds me a little of my granma's homemade pierogie filling...mmmmm

I haven't actually tried this version of the gratin, but when I was living with a family in the north of France, they taught me how to make a traditional northern dauphinoise. It calls for eggs and milk beaten together and poured over the layers of potatoes and gruyere. I'd never go another way!

Delicious and easy. I mix in panko crumbs with the cheese.

As written, the recipe produces a pretty tasty dish. But for a more interesting gratin dauphinois, add some freshly grated nutmeg (about 1/8 teaspoon), and generously rub the baking dish with fresh garlic. One could also simmer the potatoes in milk first for about 10 minutes (before simmering in the cream) to help remove the acid in the potatoes and prevent any unattractive curdling.

Superb. For an herbal twist, add some chopped fresh tarragon generously throughout the slices before baking. I agree that bread crumbs mixed amidst the cheese adds nice texture. Also learned that you dont want tissue-paper thin potato slices because they will fall apart in the pre-cook stage. Notable especially if you use a mandoline to slice.

Good dish. I made two changes: added some of the grated cheese as a middle layer, and added some fresh bread crumbs to the top cheese layer, which makes it crustier. Served it with a rack of lamb. Enjoyed by all.

I rarely follow directions but this time I did--Yukon potatoes, half-and half, and Gruyere cheese. This makes an expensive dish of potatoes! Since I doubled the recipe, the cheese alone came to $14.00. I love the flavor of Gruyere, but the amount did not flavor or juice up the potatoes. It ended up tasting like most scalloped potato dishes--good, but not special.

Great recipe. Im a culinary student and in class I made this using a mixture of both gruyere and mozerella. Also I dropped the potato slices in boiling water and as soon as they came back up to a boil I took them out, put them in a hotel pan, poured on cream, mixed in about half the cheese mixture and then topped it with the rest. Very tasty.

Sorry, don't shoot me, but I haven't made this dish. However, I certainly intend to - sounds delicious! Re the cooking time: when I make scalloped potatoes, sliced about 1/8 inch thick, it takes a good 1 1/2 hours in the oven to cook. So, the time shown sounds pretty realistic to me. To the fat conscious: ya know, conscientious people really don't eat this kinda stuff on a daily basis. If your everyday diet is generally on the low fat side, you can consider recipes like this a SPECIAL TREAT on a once-in-a-while basis. What kind of life would it be if you ate nothing but carrots and celery simmered in vegetable broth, or other such similar fare? BORING!

To the cook from Utah - if you are concerned about fat, you're on the wrong site. Check out Cooking Light.com or eat Lean Cuisine but son't rate recipes you haven't tried.

Hi, I just thought it necessary to mention that there is a slightly less calorie-loaded version of this recipe... The french have a variation to the theme of Gratin Dauphinois where instead of the half-and-half mixture being cream and milk you can use cream and low fat beef or veal stock. Leave the cooking time the same but skip the first 15 minutes on the stove top. If you've sliced the potatoes thinly enough, they will soften anyway!! As the french say, Bon appétit!

Haven't tried this one, but in December 1993 Bon Appetit(too old for Epicurious I guess) there is a fantastic recipe for Gratin Dauphinois - wish I could put it in my Epicurious file!!

I was going to make this until I noticed that it says to simmer the very thinly-sliced potatoes for 15 minutes in the half-and-half, or "until they are just beginning to soften." It seems like you would have mashed potatoes or mush if you followed this direction. Would love to hear from someone who tries it.

Just to let you all know that in French, it is Gratin Dauphinois and not Dauphinoise. Same thing with Boeuf Bourguignon (not Bourguignonne). One of the many perks of the French language.

I am simply reviewing this recipe, it looks like a prepayment for a trip to the caridiologist's office with all of the cheese and cream!! I think there may be less high fat choices elsewhere!
