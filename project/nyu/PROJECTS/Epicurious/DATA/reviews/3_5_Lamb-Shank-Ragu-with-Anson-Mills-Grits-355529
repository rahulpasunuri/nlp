I followed the recipe exactly (as I do on the first pass every time) and found this dish bland and pedestrian. The dominant tone was vegetal, and the lamb was weak in the background. The grits were also bland, even with the infusion of manchego. I tasted it again the next day, but the flavor had not improved (as it often does with a braise). Looking back over the recipe, I suppose I am not surprised at this result; there's really nothing in here that would create depth of flavor. Will definitely not bother with this one again.

Just remembered that I also used more lamb, as I believe someone recommended. It was still plenty saucy, but in a very good way. Sauce was great

Phenomenal recipe. I just remembered making this last winter, and realized I never reviewed it. I made some changes, although I can't remember exactly what. I likely upped the hot pepper flakes, omitted the radicchio, and used some balsamic to add a little more tang. I omitted the sour cream from the grits, and made more of a polenta out of the cornmeal we had. Everyone raved about the dish and wanted me to forward them the recipe. Great warming comfort food in the middle of cold winter.

Thanks for all the good advice, reviewers! I made it as written a couple of days before a dinner party, refrigerated it, and served it with Anson Mills grits. Yum! Yes, it is saucy, but I liked that.

very yummy, with quite a kick. maybe my red pepper flakes were extra hot. like other reviewers, thought it was quite saucy, sort of stew-like, but loved the juice over grits. didn't have fennel bulb, so doubled up other veggies/mushrooms, and substituted napa cabbage for radicchio at the end. actually made it two nights in a row!

After making this recipe, my wife and I both agree that it could use more lamb, given the amount of "broth" there is. We also believe, especially after seeing the photograph, that there is something not quite right with the given recipe. At first we thought that maybe we didn't cook it down enough at the end, but that still wouldn't have given us the reddish color and thicker ragu we were looking for. So, the next night when we had leftovers, we added tomato paste and then simmered and reduced the liquid. The result was infinitely better than the original preparation. Served it with polenta and it was excellent. We'll definitely make it again.

I followed the advice of the other reviewers and used 4 lamb shanks instead of 2. To accommodate the additional shanks, I used a shallow dish which meant that the shanks weren't completely covered in liquid. I turned them often and cooked for 4 hours. I also used slow cooking Anson Mills grits and made them in the slow cooker. Turned out great! Perfect amount of meat to broth.

Made the recipe as written. It was great. Very flavorful, just the right consistency. I actually ordered the grits from Anson Mills and they were pretty fabulous. I had never eaten grits before. A definite keeper!

I made this recipe exactly as written except I doubled it. I thought the sauce/meat ratio was fine. Perhaps my lamb shanks were meatier? I made it several days ahead, froze it and finished it off with the radicchio and scallion when I reheated it. One of the best lamb shank recipes I've ever had. I couldn't find the grits in our store but a good quality polenta was fine.

This was like eating your grandpa's mahogany-walled, red-leather-encrusted Smoking Study over a side of Everything that's Good about Dairy Fats. Very impressive. We're veg, so there were some major substitutions. Homemade "lamb" seitan (thx atebitvegan!!) worked wonderfully if treated differently than actual lamb: pan fry to crisp it, then throw it in during the last 10 minutes of simmering. The insane amount of scotch simmered down to a leathery perfection. Super brothy finished dish, but as much as I was tempted to thicken with tomato paste... it didn't need it.

I agree with the over reviews. The sauce was delicious but too much for the amount of lamb. I would definitely make this again but use more lamb. I think four shanks would work well.

Very good but, as previous reviewer mentioned, too watery. We thickened with corn starch. Three cups chicken stock is too much. Maybe one?

Did the recipe as stated (to the letter). It was really good, except, it produced waaaaay too much broth and not enough lamb. Next time, I'll try a 2-3 lb. LEG of lamb instead. This would produce enough meat to accomodate the volume of sauce. Also, the grits were a bit more runny than I'd like (this was because they were still hot when I served them). I'll either use more grits (probably around 1 cup dry) to start with, making a more polenta-like texture, or wait until they reach room temperature so they have the consistency of mashed potatoes. Other than that, it was quite tasty. I couldn't wait to eat the leftovers (runny as they were).
