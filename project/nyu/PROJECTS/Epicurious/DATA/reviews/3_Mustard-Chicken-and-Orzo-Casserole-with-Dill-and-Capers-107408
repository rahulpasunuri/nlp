I agree with the reviewers who said that there were too many steps in the recipe. I liked the idea of adding spinach, it added a lot of flavor. With the amount of mustard in the recipe, I decided not to use the dill and nutmeg. They would have been lost. I disagreed with the author's instructions to add all the poaching liquid at once to the roux. No wonder people had problems getting the right consistency! I added my liquid in half-cup batches, stirring until smooth, and heating until the sauce started to thicken before adding the next batch of liquid. This way, the thickness of the sauce can be controlled. Here's my take on the recipe. I cut boneless, skinless chicken thighs into bite-size pieces. I cooked the chicken and the celery in the chicken stock [eliminates one step and improves the poaching liquid]. I stirred defrosted 10-ounce package of spinach into the orzo when it was almost done cooking. I used non-fat milk instead of cream. I drained the pasta-spinach mixture and returned it to the pan. I stirred in the chicken. I stirred in the sauce {eliminates one large mixing bowl]. Once it was all combined, I put it into a Corningware roasting pan and covered it with its own lid [eliminates one piece of foil from the landfill]. This recipe is a lot of work and uses a lot of dishes. I would not use it for week nights, but would consider it for weekends or for making ahead and cooking later. It is very satisfying and makes good leftovers.

Made this as written using only 1/4 cup dill and "eyeballed" nutmeg. I like the flavor, but I can't believe orzo is in the title. It needs a lot more orzo in my opinion. I am cooking more orzo to throw into the end result. I think it will soak up the sauce. Next time I will add spinach as suggested by others. I think that would be yummy.

I always get a kick out of the bad reviews because I can usually see by their complaints just what they did wrong...eg. too much liquid? I don't see any liquid in the recipe, but a thick sauce...did someone forget to drain something??? I love this because I would never have used these ingredients together and they do taste wonderful... the biggest problem, I think, with some "cooks" is that they follow a recipe without tasting as they go along....I like dill but in very small quantities, so I put a little in , taste, then add more if I like. The same with mustard and capers! A little goes a long way and I use the recipe as a guide , etc. Anyway, this recipe is for experienced cooks who more of less know how it will taste by reading the recipe. And for my unlisted ingredient...I had to put in some garlic...mmmmm mmmm mmmm! So, I got that off my chest!!!LOL! Please enjoy the sauce-making and taste as you go...Cheers!

Way too much dill. I love dill, but it completely overpowered this dish. If I were to ever make it again, which I won't, I would have left out the dill completely, used rotisserie chicken, not boiled, and added some more veggies. Very disappointing.

YUMMERS! Definitely one of my favorites! Especially great when family comes over -- this can be prepared ahead of time and yet isnt' your ordinary chicken casserole. Even my 'foodie' relatives oohed and aahed over this dish that even the finicky toddlers devoured -- what's not to love! I make a 1/3 of the recipe for just my daughter and I but the full recipe serves 6 easily!

This is a great dish for a party/buffet because it can be made ahead. I've made it for several parties and everyone loved it. I left out the celery and sour cream, and increased the amount of capers and mustard.

This recipe received rave reviews with the children. I added small cut garden veggies and eliminated the sour cream. Good week night food.

I felt there was too much liquid in the casserole, so it didnt hold the dish together. I think if the chicken was cut into bite size pieces instead of shredded would improve the texture. I did make one modification by swapping out the celery with sliced leeks. I love all of the ingrediants and the casserole concept very appealing but wont make again without my personal preference changes, e.g. more orzo, less liquid and staying with the thinly sliced leeks.

I printed this out a year ago and the ratings back then were in the 90+s and now it is in the 80's. I should have followed my instincts and based it on the most recent ratings. This dish was a waste of time. Just bland and mushy. Box casserole dishes are better and they are horrible. I would never make this again. My husband thought it was okay.

Given all the reviews, I was sort of disappointed. This recipe wasn't all that special - just another chicken casserole with heavy cream. I like the mustard in it but will be moving on to other recipes

Made this last night and substituted spinach (two bags fresh, wilted and chopped) instead of celery. It was delicious. The sauce itself is wonderful and could be used for many things. In terms of it not thickening for some, I think that's technique more than anything. More flour could help, but, if made right, it shouldn't be runny. The only thing negative is that I felt it was more of a side dish then a meal. So, next time, I will eliminate the chicken altogether and double everything else (orzo, sauce, etc.) and bake it just the same. And I'll make a roast chicken (or turkey) and potatoes to go along with it.

Horrible. Almost inedible. I use epicurious almost daily; the only recipe I have hated. I had to apologize to my family for this one.

Rating: 4
My guests and I really enjoyed this dish! Even my pickiest eater had multiple helpings. I did sub 1 box of very well drained frozen spinach for the celery, and used the water from the spinach in the water to boil the orzo. I cut the chicken broth back by 1/4 cup or so, and used a very large saute pan to simmer the roux and broth, so it reduced very nicely; I actually had to add some liquid. Finally I mixed some shredded parmesian cheese into the topping, and it browned very nicely. A great dish, although it does take about an hour of prep time.

Rating: 2
First off, this recipe was NOT quick and easy, that is if you make a proper roux, cook the orzo separately..see recipe, cook the celery separately, see recipe...and poach the chicken properly, let it cool properly and then shred it..see recipe, you will know what i am talking about. that in and of itself takes an hour +, easy. that said, if you have an hour and a half to put together a casserole that looks like a 4th grader made it, it does tastes great and makes killer leftovers for the next day.

Rating: 4
One of our favorites! I used rotisseire chicken for extra flavor. I decreased the chicken broth down to 2 1/2C. and increased the flour to 3 1/2 T. I added spinach because that sounded so good. I let the casserole sit for 5-10 mins. and it set up fine.

Rating: 2
I thought that this was pretty tasty, and my husband was okay with it too (perhaps just being polite).....I think this is best suited for "ladies' luncheons". If you're not just crazy about dill, don't add as much as the recipe calls for. Trust me, a little goes a long way.

sort of a white version of beef stroganoff. I thought it was okay, but certainly there are a lot of better dishes out there.

Didn't care for the flavors in this, though my boyfriend did. If I made it again I would sub out the celery and use spinach (as suggested) and cut back on the capers. I also cooked uncovered as it seemed pretty soupy. (Perhaps I should have cooked it on the stove longer or not used all the chicken broth after the chicken came out.)

My first review is prompted by how much my guests liked this dish. I substituted 1C. of brown rice for the orzo to make it healthier, and chopped kale (frozen, rather than fresh) for the celery to give it more taste. One friend took three helpings!

Loved this casserole! I was wondering what to do with the leftover chicken we had from a party, and this was a hit! I omitted the capers as I don't much care for them (other than with smoked salmon). I was out of orzo so I tried a larger pasta (orchiette) and slightly increased the sauce. When I was putting the casserole together, I, too, felt the sauce was a bit on the runny side, so instead of baking it covered in foil, I cooked it the entire time uncovered, then broiled at the end. It was perfect. I also love this recipe because you can actually taste the dill - I used the full 1/2 cup. One hint that I have that made the recipe quicker: since I used a larger pasta that took 15 minutes to cook, and was using pre-cooked chicken, the first thing I did was boil the pasta, then added the celery half-way thru cooking. While that was going on, I made the sauce and in the end, the whole recipe took only 20 minutes to put together. Family loved it!

Rating: 1
Disappointing, and I wouldn't make it again. Too many warring flavors -- dill, capers, mustard -- and the chicken and orzo are too bland to stand up to them or complement the flavors. Dark meat chicken would have stood a better chance, as would barley in place of orzo. But I didn't even think it worth doctoring or trying again.

Rating: 3
I will make this dish regularly. As one reviewer suggested, I eliminated the celery and used two packages chopped spinach. I think the improved the "what the cat yacked up" appearance that some complained of. My sauce didn't thicken either...I'll have to brush up on my roux. My husband called it "high brow comfort food." We loved it.

With the addition of frozen chopped spinach or broccoli I had a great one-dish meal. Extra dill and some garlic and the flavor was wonderful. I don't have a clue what is wrong with the cooks who claim this is runny. If you don't know how to make a roux and white sauce don't bother with this recipe. If you do know how you will love this!

this was a great casserole for a large crowd. I cut the chicken instead of shreading, added a cup of sliced crimini mushrooms, and fresh drained spinach (would do more spinach next time). I also used 2% milk instead of cream and it worked just fine. Fresh dill is a must. I left out the capers...too salty! will make it again for another crowd next month. Only downside was it took much longer than the 45" prep time!! but it was great as left-overs.

Rating: 4
I have made this dish for my friends, my parents, and my husband, and every time it is wonderful! I highly recommend this recipe! They will ask for more. It's even better the next day. I don't care for capers so I 86'd those and I haven't used the nutmeg since the first time but either way it's good. The sauce is never thick nor runny and is so flavorful.

Rating: 1
This was not good -- at all. The amount of flour suggested to make the sauce was not nearly enough - the sauce was very runny so I had to add more flour just to make the sauce thick enough. Also, it was very bland even when I added more dill than was called for in the recipe. After I baked it as directed (covered with foil) it still was bland, nondescript, and runny. It probably should have been baked uncovered and for much longer than indicated but this recipe still would not have not been good..... My suggestion: don't make this. Nothing about it works.......

A favorite in my house. Capers and dill are favorites of mine. Leave out the celery and substitute one(or two)packages of frozen chopped spinach(thawed and squeezed dry as possible)when you mix ingredients at the end. You now have a delicious one-dish meal.

Very Tasty! It's hard to find good casseroles... this is a keeper! Used for a dinner party and got rave reviews. I almost cut the dill in half, but I'm glad I didn't. Followed the recipe exactly. Yum!

I thought this recipe was quite nice as a light dish. It could easily serve as an accompaniment to another item with a stronger flavor. Fresh dill is a must! I also think a good blend of mustards helps (we used Dijon and Pommery.) We found the dish actually improved overnight, with time for the flavors to mellow. We'll definitely cook it again, probably as a summer dish.

Rating: 2
I found this dish way too rich. If I made it again I would cut the cream. I would also cut up the chicken into chunks. The shredded chicken had an odd texture and I didn't get enough chicken flavor in a forkful. Overall it tasted good, but not worth the effort.

Rating: 4
My friend first made this recipe and I wanted a copy right away. I've made it at least 5 times now and am making it for a dinner party tomorrow. I leave out the capers and use soja (soy) cream instead of the heavy cream. I also only use the course grain mustard. The fresh dill is definately the way to go. It takes a long time but it's WELL worth it!

Rating: 3
I just have to add my voice to the disparate comments. I didn't follow the recipe to the T, but certainly followed its spirit. The inspired combination of chicken, celery, capers, mustard and dill is really, really good. I cooked with what I had on hand (no whole grain mustard, no sour cream and limited cream) and we found it a wonderful marriage of flavors.

I could tell the roux was too scant for the amount of liquid, so I added more butter and lots more flour. I found the preparation rather involved for a dish that tasted, when served, just like my mom's tuna casserole. Don't even THINK about tuna casserole when eating this, or that's just what you'll have.

Rating: 3
the flavor was great--really liked the umami combination of mustard and capers--but i would agree that the sauce wasn't nearly thick enough to serve as a binding agent. i cooked some additional roux and that helped. my other complaint was that, while tasting great, the dish kind of looked like something the cat yacked up, especially the next day. along with another poster, i don't know that the casserole had to be baked at the end. in fact, i think the whole thing would be better as a sauce over a long-cut pasta (pappardelle would be my choice, or fettuccine).

Rating: 2
I said I would make this dish again, but with a modification. The flavors were way too sharp and vinegary from the mustards and the capers. I would cut the amount of capers to about half of the recipe to reduce that vinegar taste. Maybe it was the mustards that were too vinegary (Gray Poupon). I don't know, but it needs to be modified. The celery helped to balance this, but not enough. And watch the amount of dill - some plants are stronger than others. I used the minimum amount and it was plenty. The idea of adding fennel or mushrooms is a good one (thanks!). I added minced shallot because I could not imagine doing without some kind of onion. I couldn't find orzo, so I had to substitute some other microscopic pasta - and it was excellent. Any small pasta will work. The sauce was delish and perfectly thick. I baked the casserole in individual oval dishes topped with a bit of grated gruyere. Served with a crusty roll. Yum!

Rating: 3
Although it didn't thicken as well as I would have liked, my family really enjoyed the flavor of the fresh dill and the celery. Am considering trying substituting the celery with fennel or mushrooms and making a greater quantity of roux the next time. But the family would eat it again, as is.

I love the flavor of this recipe. The first time I made this, I followed it to the letter except I didn't have a non-glass casserole dish, so I couldn't broil it. I decided the sour cream topping didn't add anything (could be due to the lack of broiling) and the baking just added waiting time. The second time, I skipped the baking part and was just as happy. I also changed the chicken/orzo ratio; I used a whole 16 oz box of orzo and decreased chicken to 3/4 pound. Next time I think I'll substitute carrots and/or mushrooms for the chicken. Don't skimp on the dill!

Rating: 3
I made this tonight and had checked the other reviews beforehand. But I had no problems with the thickening. A few suggestions -- you must really cook your roux, low and slow, until brown. It takes the stock much easier then and thickens nicely. I reduced the amount of cream, too, but that was to watch calories, not for thickening. I added some carrots in addition to celery, and the dish was delish.

This recipe needs some work. The flavor is interesting but sauce/roux didn't thicken enough. Also something should be substituted for the orzo to add some texture, maybe rice? Pretty underwhelming overall.
