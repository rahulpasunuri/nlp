This is fantastic. I made it for Mother's Day, and the only one who didn't like it is my picky cousin who tends to stay away from "grown-up food". His loss, because the combination of flavors, and especially the salty-tangy salsa verde with the cool ricotta and mint was exceptional. I thought it was a fairly simple preparation and I was pleased that the roll-ups stayed rolled up. Will definitely make again later this summer when farmer's markets have eggplant.

I minced smoked red peppers, and being out of salsa verde, used some mint chutney. Wonderful! I also made sandwiches rather than rollups. Was a bit messy but just as tasty.

Made this for vegetarians at Christmas dinner, took advice from others and minced red pepper, that worked well, I used basil instead of mint also yummy choice. Warmed it as per others advice too, then added the salsa verde - so much flavour - really delicious! I don't like eggplant and I loved this - looking forward to making again.

My husband really liked this and he is no fan of eggplant. It was as delicious to eat as delightful to look at. Wonderful grouping flavors. I just added this recipe to my "keepers" list.

My all time favorite recipe for a 1st course of a special meal. Made it many times and everyone loves it. A little time consuming because of all the steps but can definitely be made ahead as someone previously mentioned. I put on salad plates and cover with plastic wrap at room temp till ready to serve. So pretty, so yummy, so impressive. Use spinach leaves if arugula isn't readily available.

Wonderful recipe for a hot summer day. Light, refreshing, and a nice mixture of flavors with the mint and salsa verde. A big hit for my vegetarian friends!

I thought this was going to be a delicious recipe. I was wrong. It was not interesting at all but the presentation was beautiful and the parsley sauce very nice. In my opinion the eggplant was blant and needed extra flavor.

Excellent. I as well put in some garlic and lightly pureed all the ingredients together with a little heavy whipping cream, the flavors came together very well. i cut the eggplant to about 1/8th inches thick and double wrapped it b/c i wanted it to stay together and not get too much of an eggplant taste, this worked very well. also i made a champagne fig sauce instead of the salsa verde and garnished it with fried carrots. it was amazing.

I made this as an appetizer for a discriminating (scary!) group at a wine-tasting, and received tons of compliments. I did mince the red peppers before putting them into the rolls, which seemed like it helped with smoother rolling . I also (for ease of eating with fingers) cut each roll in half and placed them cut-side-down on a bed of arugula--the platter looked beautiful with the red pepper, mint & cheese, and arugula sticking out of each roll. Many people requested the recipe and I will use it again often, even though the whole process is time-consuming!

I have made this dish twice and I totally agree with previous reviewer to cut eggplant into 1/2 -inch thick slices, not 1/4-inch. Also make the filling ahead so it will blend as it stands. Maybe next time i will follow Shaker, Ohio's trick of turning it into a dip ;-).

DON'T PASS THIS UP!!! A wonderful medley of flavors. Used fresh eggplant and mint from the garden. I was a little hesitant to use the mint but it gives a wonderfully fresh taste. Also, I used garlic\basil feta and also added fresh basil to the salsa verde. Everyone loved this dish!!!

I wasn't sure about this one but it got great reviews from my dinner guests. It was really easy to prepare and the presentation was very pretty. I used goat cheese instead of feta and the result was very good. I think i'll grill the eggplant next time since they did become a bit mushy under the broiler. All in all though, i'd make it again.

This recipe was amazing. Not only is it great because you can make it 2 hours ahead of time then let it sit at room temp - but it's easy. The flavors were wonderful and I must mention that the men at our party loved it! Not a chick dish :)Helpful hints: I recommend cutting the eggplant 1/2 inch thick - so it doesn't fall apart during baking. Also, I suggest making the filling ahead of time and chilling it so that the flavors come together. I was a bit nervous, but people raved!

Wow! I absolutely loved this recipe. (So did my husband & my niece.) The salsa verde was fast & easy to make and is great as a dip and/or topping. The feta-stuffed eggplant rolls tasted fabulous and the presentation is great! This is a definate hit with company and/or to take to a group dinner party!

I MUST tell you what happened when I attempted this recipe...I cooked the eggplant a little too long, and without another option, decided to throw all the ingredients (minus the mint) into the blender. I added a little extra garlic, salt and pepper, and made a FABULOUS dip! We used pita chips, and nobody ever knew that it started out as a completely different dish! When in doubt, wing it!

I've served this many times since I first saw it. Always loved by all. The salsa verde adds the perfect compliment and brings the flavors together. Delightful summer fare.

I was scrolling through the eggplant recipes when I saw this one again. I made it several times last summer when I had fresh arugula in the garden -- always to rave reviews. I substituted spinach for the arugula during the winter months in our northern location but didn't like it nearly so well. The peppery taste of the arugula seems to be the perfect complement to the other ingredients. In any event, I wanted to add my enthusiastic response to those of the other correspondents -- this is a really wonderful dish and I look forward to making it agin often this summer.

Beyond incredible. #1: the presentation is beautiful. #2: the taste of the eggplant, cheese and salsa verde and arugula just melts together for such a delicious flavor #3: it's easy and #4: all of my guests wanted the recipe!

My husband and I thought this recipe was excellent. It was visually appealing, and delicious especially with the 'salsa verde'. The next time, I would like to make the mint and cheese mixture a few hours ahead of completing the recipe to give the mint time to flavor the cheeses. I also made one of the rolls with an herb flavored goat cheese, and we both think that we may like that even better.

I made this for an executive PDR meeting to break up the monotany that comes with their vast dietary restrictions. Now I'm stuck making this all the time until I can find something to compete with it. It's a great recipe, really.

I have made this dish for my friend's house-warming party and it was a big hit. There was nothing left and everyone wanted a recipe. I really enjoyed this dish and recommend it very highly.

We had rave reviews with this dish. It's easy to prepare, and very tasty. A great vegetarian appetizer (we substituted olive paste for the anchovy paste - a different flavor, but still very good).

Thoug I have had guests that were not thrilled with this recipe, most think it is fantastic and I belive it is worth every bit of work that goes into it. It is truly delicious.
