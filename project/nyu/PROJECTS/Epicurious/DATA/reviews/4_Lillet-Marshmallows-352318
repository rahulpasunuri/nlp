Make this recipe! They're amazing!!! This is now my "go-to" marshmallow recipe. I played with the ingredients a bit and am happy I did! I subbed the Lillet with both champagne in one and gin in another. The fluffiness of the champagne was far superior. In another recipe (non-alcoholic) I used club soda and the result was even better. If using the Lillet, sub the regular water with club soda or seltzer and the carbonation will add the loft that you're looking for in marshmallows. They were delicious and everyone raved about them.

I tried two different batches, and neither worked (and yes, I've made marshmallows before). I thought maybe I poured the syrup in too fast the first time, so I went painstakingly slow the second, to the same non-marshmallowy end. It came out with the consistency of slightly fluffy playdough. Oh well, with the Lillet it was still tasty. I rolled it into little playdough snakes and cut it into candies. Gave up after the second try and used a marshmallow recipe with egg whites, which turned out great.

The marshmallows were super easy to make and the texture was great but I thought the Lillet flavor was too strong. We used an already open bottle so maybe the Lillet wasn't good anymore but I probably won't be trying this particular recipe again.

I LOVE this recipe. Lillet is our house apéritif, so it's fun to try it in different ways. Always delicious and always a hit with guests.

I've never made homemade marshmallows before, but for some reason I had to make these! I actually went out and invested in the Lillet. These are utterly addictive!!! The Lillet flavor is very subtle and haunting. I made them a second time for a family gathering. Not everyone was as in love with them as I. I think these need to be served without competing flavors. They are awesome with coffee!

I LOVE making marshmallows for holiday gifts. I use all kinds of flavours but the most popular is gin, with a little green colouring. Strictly for grown-ups, and delicious.

Love home made marshmallows. A pizza cutter is the only way to slice them. I sprayed it once w/ a bit of Pam and sliced the entire pan.

I wish I could have these around all the time! A couple of them and my sweet tooth is satisfied. They were even great roasted on a fire and made into s'mores with some good chocolate and fresh graham crackers, and they bubbled in a really interesting way. They did not turn in flavor after sitting a few days. Great one, Maggie!

I haven't made this with Lillet, but I've used the same ratio of water with a 1/2 tsp. of almond extract, and another batch with 1/2 tsp. peppermint extract and a red food coloring swirl. They're good! A greased knife works okay for slicing them (better than water), but I'd be interested in hearing about any methods that have worked better.

I was totally surprised by the reviewer's experience of the marshmallows changing to an off flavor. I made these quite a few times and kept them for extended periods with no vinegary taste.

These were easy to make and delicious. I haven't had any problem with the flavour turning.

Really great twist on homemade marshmallows, but you need to eat them within a day: As they get older the lillet turns to vinegar, and they taste like vinegar marshmallows. Of course, homemade marshmallows are best fresh anyway, so that's added incentive to eat them quickly.
