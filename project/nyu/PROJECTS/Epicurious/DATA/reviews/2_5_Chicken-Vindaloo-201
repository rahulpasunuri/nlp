I would have to agree with the previous review. I have had this dish prepared by someone whose mother grew up in Indian so I'm probably a little jaded.

I am not Indian but I've eaten plenty of Indian food to know this recipe is a disgrace. There are better Vindaloo recipes out there. Don't waste your time on this one!!

This recipe deffinitely needed some punch to bring it to life. I added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and an additional chipotle to bring it back from the morgue.

My husband and I loved this. I was worried, given some of the negative comments. But with one chili (not a can), lots of cilantro, and even with no change in the amount of vinegar, we thought this was really delicious. It reminded us of dishes we've eaten in Indian restaurants (regardless of whether it's a genuine vindaloo). Not too hot, flavors well blended, we're eager to make this again.

This is not an indian vindaloo! Having grown up in India, The real vindaloo comes from Goa, and has its roots in the portugese dish called sarpotel, where you use pork, vinegar, chilli and paprika (tone down the heat but gives colour), garlic and salt (No ginger, or any other masala). Portugese sailors preserved pork on their long voyages to india and substituted indian spices in the traditional sarpotel to make vindaloo. The secret is to make a paste of the spices and vinegar and marinate the meat in this, then SLOW cook until the pork fat raises to the top.

I made this with bone in thighs and grilled in a pan on bbq. Worked really well. But the taste was not as I expected, and way to hot. Hubby sweated as he ate! He's requested me to NOT make this again.

This was a disappointment. I've found much better vindaloo recipes and will go back to them. I don't really know what's wrong with this, perhaps too much vinegar, but the balance is all wrong.

I actually used the whole can of chilis and I loved it. It was *really* spicy but so is the vindaloo I've tasted at Indian restaurants. I loved it!

i have to echo the comments of the bicoastal cook: if you all thought this was too spicy, you must have done something wrong. i found this dish to be absolutely brilliant. i followed the recipe explicitly--even marinated an extra day--and loved every bite. my boyfriend was seriously weighing the risk of eating the chicken raw because the marinate was so overwhelmingly tempting.

Not a review, just a note for Seattle: you aren't supposed to use one large _can_ of chipotles, but rather you're supposed to open up the can, remove one single chipotle, and use that single pepper in the sauce.

This recipe was awful. The dish was so very spicy, it was flavorless! The recipe doesn't indicate how many ounces of chipotle adobo sauce you should use, therefore, you don't realize how spicy this dish really is. To use a "large" can of sauce just doesn't cut it. Chicken Vindaloo is my favorite Indian dish and thus far, the recipes from this website has been a let down.

The other vindaloo recipe is MUCH better.This is too sour and very one-note. It is hot without complexity. After it was done cooking I re-heated, added chutney, chopped almonds and dried cranberries. Much better but a different recipe and I guess not at all authentic.

I agree with Scott 100%--the vinegar is too overpowering, and the chicken is not really spicy enough. The aroma while it cooks is heavenly, but end result is disappointing.

I really liked this recipe. I took the advice of the other reviewers and used only 1/2 the vinegar, but really thought it had great flavor. I also used chicken breasts, and served it over yellow rice with steamed asparagus on the side. I'd definitely make it again.

I did not care for this at all. The vinegar was far too potent, though I did not find it too spicy, as others did. I won't be making this again.

The flavor in this recipe was great, but it was so spicy that we could only eat a couple of bites. And I like foods with kick. I added some potatoes and stewed tomatoes to dilute the spice and served yogurt on the side--even then, it was a little too fiery.

A little on the hot side.Less chipotle peppers and more adogo sauce would help maybe.But it was tastly.

This is authentic as I am married to an Indian.

This is more like 3 1/2 forks, a great recipe. I used about 2 lbs boneless chicken breasts and a little more chipotle. But it won't serve 6 at all - my husband just wolfed it down.
