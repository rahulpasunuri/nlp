I reduce the sugar to 4 tablespoons and sub out the whipping cream for whole milk and it's still amazing every time.

Truly delicious and I almost gave it four forks because it was so easy. But I usually save my four forks reviews for something extra spectacular or impressive. The next time I need to bring something to an autumn pot luck dinner - this will be it!

We've made the the last couple thanksgivings and will be making it again this year. Like other reviewers, I decrease the sugar slightly and leave have the corn kernels whole. Its not very healthy, but so delicious!

This is fantastic. My only advice with this recipe is to make extra (lot's extra) because it goes very fast. It is so good, no one is polite about getting their fair share and then some. I have seen perfectly nice, sharing thoughtful people growl viciously at folks reaching for the last bite. Violence may ensue :-)

My favorite corn pudding--and I've made a lot of them. Doubled the recipe so it took longer to bake. Used frozen sweet corn and cut the sugar in half. Perfect.

This dish was fantastic. I doubled the recipe, used as a side dish for pulled pork sandwiches and we ate the entire thing. I too, cut down slightly on the sugar, added some whole kernels and sprinkled the top with grated white cheddar before baking. This dish has a lovely texture and flavor. Adding this to my recipe box.

Being asked to bring a corn casserole to an event and having never made one, I quickly found that apparently most people open a package of corn muffin mix, add a few ingredients and come up with something edible. I decided on this recipe mainly because it had ingredients I had and seemed easy. It received rave reviews and recipe requests. Mind you, I doubt corn, butter and cream are going to be on most people's diet list, so I would suggest that its nutritional value is negligible, but I doubt most people who like corn pudding are worried about that. Several people noted the moist interior and crisp crust, as if to say, wow, I never thought you could come up with a better product using real ingredients rather than a stale muffin mix. I thought it was quite tasty and would make it again.

Just bought 10 ears of corn & was looking for a corn pudding recipe as my husband suggested that this would be a good use. I halved the recipe as we are only 3 people for dinner. Very easy tp put together & I added in some whole kernels as someone suggested. Came out so good. I will def make this again although a bit fattening!

Light and fluffy, WONDERFUL. My husband and daughter can hardly wait until i put this on the table. It is sweet. Reduce the sugar according. Next time, I'll use 5T sugar instead of 6. It's a keeper!

A++. Make this. This is the epitome of a true southern creamed corn pudding. It is also called "spoon bread" in the south. It was sweet, with the perfect balance of flavor. I reserved 1 of the cups of corn and added it just before going into the oven, so those kernels stayed whole. I also did mine in a cast iron skillet with a bit of butter. I melted it on the stove, added the mixture, then the whole corn, then into the oven. Perfection!

This recipe has become a must have at Thanksgiving and Christmas. My Grandmother, who doesn't really cook anymore found out I was making a corn pudding and she followed me around the kitchen and watched, how cool is that! This is so easy to make and it's a hit.

Rating: 4
I made 3 minor changes to this: reduced sugar to 3.5 tablespoons, which was perfect amount of sweetness for me; pureed the 4 cups of corn but added another 2 cups left whole kernel, and used 1 cup whole milk with 1/4 cup half and half and 1/4 cup 2%, just to lighten it up a bit. Took to a thanksgiving dinner and it was scraped clean. Delicious, different and nice contrast to all the typically heavy sides.

For those of you who subscribe to Bon Appetit, you may have seen the November 2011 issue where the editors list the Thanksgiving dish they cant live without. One mentioned Baked Corn Pudding in the Pennsylvania Dutch style, but BA didnt list the recipe! So off to Epicurious I went to research. I settled on this recipe, and couldnt have been happier. For one thing, I let my 5 ears of corn sit a bit too long in the refrigerator, so they werent as fresh and sweet as they could have been. No problem for this recipe, which tells me it will be awesome made with frozen corn, too. I didnt have any cream, so I used all half and half (1 ½ cups) as one reviewer suggested and it was creamy and perfect. It did take a bit longer to set, about 50 minutes for me. I also left about 1 cup or so of the corn kernels to stir in after processing as others suggested, and agree that this is a must. And I used cornmeal instead of flour, but Im not sure this would have made any difference. I used 5 tablespoons of sugar since my corn was a bit old, and it was still pretty sweet, though not overly sweet for me. 6 tbl would have been too much though, and if you are using sweet, fresh corn, I would suggest starting with 3 tbl and adding more if you think you need it. All in all a fantastic recipe if you love creamy, corny goodness!

Rating: 0
This recipe is so fantastic! I took the advice offered by another reviewer on substituting cornmeal for the flour and ricotta for the milk. I also left 1 cup of corn whole and mixed it in after pureeing the rest. We served this with grilled ribs and potato salad. Even my 2 year old couldn't get enough!I will definitely be making this again.

Rating: 4
Delicious! Used all light cream, and used less sugar from reading other reviews. I used fresh leftover corn from a previous night's meal. It's summer now so the corn was so sweet and delicious! Also used other reviewers suggestions and pureed only 1/2 the corn. This was such a great side dish that everyone gobbled up!

Rating: 4
I altered this a bit as others have suggested by pureeing only half of the corn and adding the other half of the kernels whole. I didn't think my family would like the texture of a creamier "pudding". Everyone agreed that the dish would not have been as well received had I pureed all the corn so I'm glad I made this alteration. Some mentioned that the dish was too sweet for their liking, so I might cut back on the sugar a bit next time. However not all agreed, and personally I thought the flavor was spot on.

Rating: 4
This was fantastic. I actually followed the recommendation of a previous reviewer and used ricotta cheese and corn meal to substitute the milk and flour. Great call because I cn't see how regular flour would have worked as well. I would actually add another TBS next time. It's not too sweet as other reviewers mention...the recipe is called Sweet Corn Pudding so you may expect it to taste sweet, but it's not overwhelming.

This dish is fabulous. It has become a Thanksgiving tradition in our family during the past 7 or 8 years. The past couple of years I've added a dash of nutmeg and that seems to enhance the flavor even more. Enjoy!

This recipe is perfection! My family has been making it for both Thanksgiving and Christmas for years now and it never gets old. I can probably count on two hands how many other families have made this part of their holiday tradition too, thanks to me introducing them to the recipe. Its slightly sweet, warm, and delicious. A superbly unique addition to any holiday (or weekday) table. I do find the recipe tends to take a little more than 45 minute to cook through sometimes, depending on the dish I use. Other than that, its not temperamental. I heart this recipe and am confident you will, too! Mmm, is it Thanksgiving yet?!

I made this with fresh corn leaving about a cup of kernels whole, farm- fresh ricotta since I didn't have any cream, cornmeal instead of white flour, and about half the sugar. It was very good and moist without being as soggy as the last time I tried it, most likely because of the ricotta and the corn meal substitutions. I will make this again.

A favorite! I've made it several times, always to raves. I use 2 cups of whole corn and 2 cups of blended corn for a better texture. It also works with less sugar depending on how sweet the corn is.

Ignore the comments about this recipe being too sweet!! The recipe is called Sweet Corn Pudding and it is PERFECT! I just came home from a family reunion full of foodies and every last scrap of this was gone, and that NEVER happens (I always bring home leftovers)!! I even made a double batch, which did take about 30 minutes longer to fully set up. Many people asked me for this recipe. The ONLY thing I changed was keeping one cup of corn whole and mixing it in. It has a wonderful texture, set up great, and will definitely be used again! Thanks!

Rating: 4
Great recipe -- you can use frozen corn (not thawed) - process half & then add other half of corn if you like the chunkier consistency. Add 5 minutes to the cook time to account for the cooler product going into the oven. I also cut the sugar in half & used half & half (total liquid amount) instead of milk and cream. It travels well too -- took it to a potluck & it held for a few hours in a warm oven (covered) without drying out or collapsing (like a souffle).

Rating: 3
The recipe's title is "Sweet" corn pudding, so it shouldn't come as a surprise. I love a bit of sweetness to things like cornbread, but cut down the sugar in this one a bit and would reduce it more in the future. No more than 4T for my taste. I used a combination of frozen and canned, as that is what I had on hand, plus I subbed half and half for the whipped cream and milk, using about a 1/4 cup less total liquid, which worked out great. I didn't process the mixture till ultra smooth, which left some kernels intact. Good consistency and would make this again. Very easy, although it does take longer than the stated baking time.

Rating: 3
I've made this recipe three times now and can never get it to the consistency that I've had other corn puddings without baking it for about another hour or so. I've found it helpful to stir the pudding so that it all cooks through but I'm still experimenting with it. I also use a little less milk than called for.

Sorry, one more item, I don't know about other people's food processors, but mine couldn't take that much liquid so I use our blender. It just fits one batch. Again, love this recipe, so easy my husband can make it and it's good.

Sorry forgot to add that when I started doing variations, I would add about two ounces extra of whole corn kernels at the end just before it went into the pan for extra texture. That said, I liked it on its own as well and for the record, in the south, this apparently doesn't count as sweet (per my husband's family).

Rating: 3
I thought this recipe was great. It is simple and easy and quite light. It turns out more like a souffle. It does need more time than the recipe calls for in an 8x8 pan, we cooked it about 55 min. Once we tried it straight, I have done it in ramekins and have added pepper and nutmeg to give it a bit more oomph. Everyone at my Thanksgiving loved it and I had some foodies there. I didn't have any leftovers and I did a double batch.

This stuff was horrible slop. The consistency is somewhere between corn bread and creamed corn and the flavor is bland. I have several dependable recipes I use for the holidays, and always experiment with a new one or two to keep things interesting. My guests and I enjoy reviewing the recipes each year and we almost unanimously hated this one. I should add that I have worked as a line and catering cook at a very upscale winery restaurant, so I don't believe it was due to any cooking error on my part. My 13yo daughter LOVED it, so some people might also enjoy it.

Made this for Thanksgiving using Rice Flour because two guests have wheat gluten allergy. Worked out just fine and got rave reviews from all. Because I had a large crowd, I doubled the recipe and cooked it in one large pan; but the middle did not set up fully. Next time, if doubling, I'll just bake in two pans. Will definitely make again.

after reading even more of these reviews, im thinking there are 2 different schools of thought on what corn pudding should be: savory or sweet. to me, it's a psuedo dessert and should sweet like candided yams...i would NEVER eat scallions or red peppers in my pudding (but i dont think it should be savory so...) with that in mind, cutting the sugar for a savory recipie would make sense. if you are in the soul food realm, however, and think corn pudding is supposed to be sweet...follow my earlier review, increase the sugar, lower the egg content, and enjoy

i dont know HOW people thought 6T of sugar made it too sweet! i added an additional 2T of dk brwn sugar for color and sweetness and it STILL wasnt that sweet. Tried again w/ 1/2 cup each of white and dk brown and it was better, also, only use 3 eggs- 4 eggs was too much egg flavor, and DONT be generous on liquid ingreditents. texture was best with 3 cups blended (but not pureed), 1 cup intact corn. over all it was okay, but i had to make TOO many adjustments to make soul food worthy corn pudding.

I have been making this recipe for several years now and enjoy its flavor and simplicity. It puzzles me that so many reviewers try to improve on the recipe by changing its very nature. If you want, chilies, ham, spices, etc., in your dish, then make a different recipe altogether. But please leave this wonderful recipe alone! The only "change" I would accept is, if you are using the super-sweet variety of corn, to reduce the sugar by a tablespoon or two. But otherwise enjoy this delicious recipe as is. We have a Mexican restaurant in our town called El Cholo and it serves a sweet corn side dish which is famous and deserving of the raves it receives. This Sweet Corn Pudding recipe is, if not identical, then close in the complement of sweetness it gives to the meal. Enjoy its originality and authenticity!

I made this for Thanksgiving and was disappointed. The flavor was good, especially since I used fresh local sweet corn that I had frozen, but the texture was a disgrace. I made the recipe as written and did not take the reviewers suggestions for leaving some corn kernels whole. The end result was a gooey mess, resembling grits, that never seemed to firm up. I served it, but only with a disclaimer! If I make this again I will leave whole corn kernels and decrease the amount of sugar by half.

I followed some suggestions to leave a portion of the corn whole and after having it both ways I prefer it completely smooth.

I really enjoyed serving this for thanksgiving and everyone liked it. It's not too sweet.

I make this every Thanksgiving as written with the following changes: I use 1/2 the amount of sugar. Instead of 4 cups corn, I use 2 16oz. bags of Pictsweet Deluxe frozen corn. Each bag has about 3 cups of corn. The first bag goes into the food processor with the other ingredients and I blend. The second bag is not blended, just added to the other mixture and poured into the pan.

First made this dish for the family Thanksgiving and now I'm expected to bring it every year! Frozen corn kernels work just fine, although you should adjust the amount of added sugar depending on how sweet your corn it (it can vary greatly). Definitely set aside about 1/3 of the corn to mix in whole. It creates great texture. I like to add chopped chives to the custard before baking. Be sure to taste a bit of your custard to adjust for sweetness and salt before putting it in the oven. I have doubled and even tripled the recipe with no problem.

My little sister has been searching for a corn pudding recipe for a while and we kept coming up with bad ones. This however, was a complete success. After reading the suggestions of the other reviewers, I only used half the amount of sugar, which was just about perfect.

This was a big hit around Thanksgiving - I ended up making it for four different potlucks, and everyone loved it. I didn't blend the corn into the liquid ingredients, though - I just put the corn kernels in the pan and poured the rest of the mixture over it.

A delicious version of a classic comfort food dish common in the South for everyday meals, this corn pudding does not call for a water bath. Because of that and instructions to use frozen corn rather than fresh scraped off the cob, preparing the corn pudding is especially speedy and nearly effortless. The cream lends a smooth texture. Great results for little effort make this a winner. Reducing the amount of sugar by a third improves the dish, which otherwise borders on too sweet.

Was a good recipe. Reduced the sugar to 2T, added Hatch green chilies, medium chop, for texture and a gourmet freshness used 4 ears of fresh Silver Queen corn and milked the ears, (it's deep summer). Made up the difference in quantity with frozen corn as directed, doubled the recipe. Added a touch of cinnamon and allspice for a Yucatan approach. Cooked it 55 minutes going on the review from Albuquerque as we are at altitude. Served with grilled chicken breasts, burgers and such at a picnic. It ROCKED! The 2005 review by "A Cook in NY in 2005" is not worth the review. If this person were a wise cook they would have read the recipe and known immediately that it was a custard, as are corn puddings AND the dis about "typical American food?" Sorry, corn is a native American Indian crop given to us immigrants by that population. There is nothing typically American about corn pudding except perhaps a combination of cultures. We borrowed corn and added a French touch--likely from the Scotts-Irish in America whose native history is mixed with the French. Further, this particular recipe was submitted by a Mexican cook from Guadalajara. Typically American? I think not.

I loved this dish and I'm serving it for Thanksgiving. First of all, it was SOOOOO easy. Secondly, I took the advice of other reviewers and thought it made for a delicious dish, plus I put my own spin on it. So, in addition to the recipe, I added two scallions to the food processor (I halved the recipe, so will add four when I make the full amount), I also added some freshly ground nutmeg and a pinch of cayenne. Then, like a reviewer suggested, I saved some of the corn (actually I saved half) and stirred it into the mixture so it had some texture. Lastly, I grated gruyere cheese over the top and it made a very tasty and crunchy topping.

Served this to a tableful of Dutch folks last night. It was received initially with hesitation, as many Europeans are far from fond of corn. However, it was the hit of the evening. Every last bit was scraped out of the dish and I had to promise the recipe to every cook in the bunch. Really delicious, the classic, basic, luscious and creamy corn pudding as it should be. You could, of course, gussy it up with herbs and cheeses and the like, but why? Its simplicity is its strength.

This is my favorite corn pudding recipe. I've only ever used frozen white corn, but I imagine fresh would be AMAZING. Too much sugar in the recipe though, I think 4.5 tablespoons is perfect.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving one year, and my brother-in-law no longer thinks it's thanksgiving unless he gets some of this. My extremely health-conscious mother even took the recipe (for special occasions). It is a custard, so it has lots of eggs, but I've never had it turn out too eggy except the one time I overcooked it. It reheats very well, so when I'm making a lot of dishes, this is one I make in advance and just reheat before serving. I prefer the consistency of the pureed corn so I puree the whole batch, but I've made it both ways and both ways work. I tinkered with the recipe at first, but I ended up back at the original. It's very good and pretty hard to mess up.

Rating: 0
I will make this, though the recurring comments about scrambled-egg consistency are troubling. My mom's corn pudding recipe (not bad, but I'm looking for an alternative) calls for stirring the pudding twice during the first 30 minutes of baking. Would that possibly correct any eggy texture problems, I wonder?

This is the first time that I have made corn pudding. It has never been a staple at our holiday dinners. After reading all of the reviews I decided to give it a go and was pleasantly suprised. I made it the evening before Thanksgiving and doubled the recipe. I put it into two separted 8x8 pans. No, I didn't use a water bath (bain marie) although I did cut down on the sugar by half. I used super sweet corn and small white baby corn. I too, held out a cup of corn from the food processor for texture. It was simple, easy and reheated nicely.

Doubled recipe, used half and half, almost all the sugar, pureed half of corn, increased cooking time slightly due to doubled recipe and comments here. Next time, will use all of the sugar--it was far from too sweet. Will also use cream & milk and cook in a water bath. The consistency was not as custardy as I wanted around the edges. Reminded me strongly of Stouffer's corn souffle (not that there's anything wrong with that necessarily, but if I'm making it myself, I'm not exactly shooting for a Stouffer's comparison), but I think if I got the consistency right by using the cream and water bath, it would be less Stouffer's-like.

I don't know what all the fuss is about with this recipe. I have never eaten nor have I ever made corn pudding in my life. So,............. First of all I have all my belongings in storage for the moment including my food processor. So, I whipped the ingrediants in a bowl - took fresh corn from the cob and tried to puree it with an emersion blender which is all I had on hand. Then I added half the corn whole into the mixture - put it into the baking dish and cooked it for about 55 minutes. I realized at the end that this is basically a custard with corn. Well, quite honestly I don't think it is worth the bother - I would rather just have my corn separately and make a delicious REAL custard on its own which brings the experience to a different level. I think perhaps four cups of corn was too much and, I would have preferred more of a custard quantity. Will not make it again but something tells me this will be better the following day. I will try to freeze it in portions. I did not grow up on typical American food as most of you sound like you have - but that should not matter. I love to cook and I enjoy trying new things. I just thought this was rather blah, heavy on the stomach, and, and not worth the bother. SORRY

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. I added some garden onions (chives would also be good). I held back some of the corn kernals from the processor to give the dish a little more texture (plus added about 1/2 cup of unprocessed kernals). Great make-ahead dish.

I usually make the Corn Pudding recipe on this site, which was always well-received, but finally decided to try this one this year. This one is much better. Everyone really loved it.

Wow. I read the reviews and got a little nervous that it might not set right, it might be gross and eggy, but I really really wanted corn pudding like grandma used to make for our thanksgiving dinner. OK, so I followed the recipe exactly except for cuting down on the sugar (3 tbsp) and sprinkle of nutmeg on top. Had to make it in 2 batches in the processor, because it ran over!Was afraid to try to double it, so I prepared a second recipes worth. Then I had NO glass pans!! So I used ceramic. One oval and one pie plate. It set in about 1 hr. And browned beautifully. But I was still nervous. Showed up at the dinner with it and there was no room in the oven, so we had to heat it on the grill!! Aggh! I was doomed!! Well, let me tell you, this was unbelieveable. Better than grandmas. It didn't look anything like scrambled eggs. It scooped out nicely. Everyone liked it. Make it. Follow the instructions. You wont have any trouble withit, I promise! Side note: I made it in the morning, to be served about 6 hours later, and I have to agree the flavor was better after it sat. If you are nervous at all about it tasting good, make a tiny custard dish alongside of it so you can taste before you serve it.

I just made this for Thanksgiving and it was great! I did cut the sugar in half and it worked out wonderfully. As my aunt put it, this is a keeper!!

Easy and scrumptious. I used fresh corn, pureed only half & used only half the sugar as others suggested. Added red bell pepper and scallions to the blender.

I followed other reviewers' comments and reduced the sugar by half -- it was still a little too sweet although my guests loved it. I sprinkled grated sharp cheddar on top towards the end of cooking, it added a nice contrast to the sweetness of the pudding.

Excellent side dish. Look forward to trying it this summer using fresh corn. Followed Chicago cook's suggestion and set aside one cup of corn kernels, adding to puree just before baking. Made for nice texture. Otherwise, used all ingredients as given. My son the critic thinks snippets of chives would be nice. Next time.

Great recipe! I now have to make this every holiday, it is so popular. I cut back on the sugar, used a regular bag of frozen corn, and I only blend half the corn in the blender- I stir in the rest of the corn kernals whole. I also cook it a bit longer than suggested- perfect every time!

This was a big hit at Thanksgiving. I took the advice of others and cut the sugar drastically (to 2 1/2 TB), used frozen baby corn and with low fat milk instead of cream and whole milk. Since I made a double recipe, I had a ton of leftovers. I "recycled" the leftovers into soups by blending the pudding in the cuisinart (a blender should do just as well). I added chicken broth to part of the blend to make a quick "cream of corn soup." On another night I enriched the "cream of corn soup" with coconut milk, thai fish sauce, fresh lime juice, some hot chili oil, and cilantro. I added crab meat to make it a thai corn/crab soup, but the soup works well without the crab or with shrimp or tofu.

This is excellent. I made it for 20 for Christmas dinner and made it again 1 week later for New Year's Eve dinner because everyone loved it. I added half the sugar based on what everyone else had said. I made it the day before, put it in the frig without the baking powder, then added the baking powder, stirred it, put it in the pan, then the oven. Perfect! If you blend the mixture well, you will have a cross between a corn pudding and spoon bread type dish. (which I love.) If you don't blend it too much, it will be chunkier and more corn puddy-ish.

I have been using this recipe for a few years and it is always a hit. I have modified it slightly for our tastes: reduce the sugar to 4 tblspns. because it is too sweet otherwise; I use half and half instead of the whipping cream and whole milk combination; and, I bake it for closer to one hour so that it is a bit more done. If you like corn, you won't be disappointed with this recipe. Enjoy!

I made this for 16 people. Due to diet contraints, I had to make some subsititutions. I used only 3 eggs, not 4. For the whipping cream and whole milk, I used half 2% milk and half skim milk. One of my guests hates eggs, so to cut down on the taste of the eggs, I added an additional tablespoon of flour and 2 tablespoons of corn meal. I also reduced sugar a bit. Everyone absolutely loved it. I had to give out the recipe, and gave away all of my leftovers (to the egg-hater actually). The flour and cornmeal really helps out on the egg factor. I have made this recipe to the letter as well. Both ways are good, but I liked the addition of the flour / cornmeal better...

I made this for Thanksgiving, just to have something different and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. I did as other reviews said cut the sugar in half. Wonderful recipe.

I made this yesterday for Thanksgiving, and it was delicious. Because my husband can't eat wheat, I used his gluten-free "flour" mix instead of the regular flour and it tasted no different. I also processed the corn separately and mixed it in with the batter so there was more texture.

Rating: 4
This was fantastic as promised by other favorable reviews. I also cut the sugar back ...by half. I used fabulous fresh sweet corn that I steamed, cooled in an ice water bath, and cut from the cobs. I will make this again for sure only next time it will be made with frozen corn kernels.

We made this recipe in our cafeteria at culinary school and it was a hit! High praise from a discerning group! I think the recipe is fine as is, however it did take a little longer to set...say 50 min to an hour.

This is a very yummy corn pudding, however, I would make the following minor changes: It seemed quite salty, so I would reduce the salt to 1/2 t. I would add Carnation milk (bakes better) instead of whole milk, would add at least one more T. of flour to make it more bready and would add 1 t. vanilla. I would definitely make it again. The batter was enough for two 9" pie molds (glass is better). Enjoy! :-)

I have made this recipe dozens of times. Everyone who tries it loves it. I mix all ingredients, then add the corn last and pulse only a few times so it's not pureed. I use all the sugar. I do find it takes longer to set, about 55 minutes. Great for both special occasions and casual meals.

Rating: 4
This was just wonderful. Served it with grilled steak and a green salad. I also reduced the amount of sugar and pureed one cup of corn and left the rest whole. I also used fine cornmeal to dust the casserole with (after I buttered it)before adding the mixture. Turned out really nice.

I was looking for a recipe from my youth. I finally found it. Just like my Mother made for Easter. I decreased the amount of sugar by half that the recipe called for and left out 2 cups of whole corn for the texture. It was fantstic! Thank you!

This is a delicious corn pudding. I, too, reduced the sugar to 3 tablespoons. I used a mixture of white and yellow frozen corn. I pureed three cups of the corn and left one cup whole for a more interesting texture. When fresh white corn is available, I'll follow the cook from Granite Bay and use 1 1/2 cups of fresh. Yum!

I served this recipe the first time with jambalaya and everyone loved it ! This was shortly before thanksgiving and everyone asked if I could bring more for that occasion. I will be serving it next with BBQ ribs and I will reduce sugar to 3 tbsp.'s as I have before and keep one cup corn solid and add green onions.

I've made this twice...for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Both times, everyone RAVED about it. I cut the sugar to 3 T, as suggested by others, and it was still plenty sweet. I also used 1% milk, not whole milk and it didn't lose a thing. I pureed 3C of corn and put 1C in whole, so it had some "substance." I also added 2T chopped green onions but it would be just as good without.

I took this dish to a church pot-luck and had to promise to bring many copies of the recipe to church on Sunday. I did reduce the sugar to 3 tblsp as others had suggested and would consider going to 2 the next time I make it. And there will definitely be a next time. I'm looking forward to trying some of the add-ins that have been suggested like bacon, onion, bell pepper or chives.

Rating: 4
Outstanding! I also cut the sugar to 2 TBSP. The comments about "scrambled eggs" escape me - the texture is fine. I tried cooking 1 day ahead and reheating, or eating the same day, and found it delicious either way! And the recipe is so simple! Do try it- it will become a regular for you. By the way I used baby white and yellow frozen corn, the only "white" type I could find.

Rating: 4
What a taste treat, I did take suggestions and cut back on sugar (4 Tbs) because I used sweet corn and I processed only 3 cups of the corn and put the rest in whole. It was a favorite around the table. Will definately use this again and pass it along to corn pudding lovers!

Excellent. I used 3 tbs of sugar. I also altered a bit: 3 cups of the frozen corn. I then pureed. Then I mixed in 1 1/2 cups of fresh white corn, and about 2 tbs of chopped green onion, and baked according to the directions. Delicious!

This was very good and easy. There were no leftovers! Do let it rest the 10 minutes after it comes out of the oven, it needs to absorb some of the moisture. Yummy!

While I liked this dish very much and my husband has declared it a favorite one to be made again, I found it a little too sweet. Next time, I might cut out 1 or 2 tablespoons of the sugar. It was also a little runnier than I expected.

I made this for a church potluck last night. It was gone so fast I didn't even get any. Luckily, I had made a second dish to eat at home. I went with eariler suggestion of 4 TBS of sugar and only pureeing 3 cups of corn. My six-year-old loved it as well.

This recipe is awesome - I've made it many times. I reduce the sugar to 4 T, and add nutmeg and chives, as well as puréeing part of the corn, all as suggested by other reviewers. No other corn pudding comes close to this one, when made with the little tweaks suggested here.

Very tasty, fluffy, custardy- I agree with others on the need to reduce sugar (even though I like things sweet- I used 4 tablespoons, which was still plenty sweet), only puree 3c of the corn and add the other cup whole, and also that it's better the next day. If you eat the same day, make sure you do let it set for 10-15 mins after cooking or it won't hold together as well. Yum!

I was disappointed with this recipe. Despite using whipping cream and whole milk, I thought it wasn't "pudding-y" enough. It definitely needed the applewood smoked bacon and sauteed shallots I added (per another's recommendation). Those ingredients saved this dish. Half the sugar is plenty. My suggestion; try a creamed corn recipe instead of fooling around with this recipe.

Unlike other reviewers, I didn't change a thing when I made this for Christmas Dinner. It was the first dish to go with even the most pickiest eater going back for seconds. yes, it was on the sweet side, but served with the right entree and other side dishes, it was just right. It was so popular, in fact, that I have had to make it for two subsequent dinners.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner-all 16 raved about it!.. My husband says this is a keeper. I did double the receipe, but only used 2 tablespoons of sugar and all skim milk. Baked it the day before, as suggested by most folks, than just reheated the whole thing for dinner. Wonderful!

Made this for Thanksgiving, but was somewhat disappointed - I thought it was sort of bland and fluffy. However, warmed up the next day it was much more flavorful and had a better consistency. I'd make this again, just do it a day or two before. I also reduced the sugar significantly since previous reviewers mentioned it was quite sweet - only used about 1 1/2 T, which was fine the 2nd day. This might also be interesting to add some tomatoes and cheese to for a different kind of main dish.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner and it came out wonderfully. I lightened it up a LOT, using only fat-free milk (and Lactaid at that, one of my friends is lactose intolerante) to replace both the cream and the whole milk. It still set up beautifully after about 55 minutes. To make it even more lowfat, I plan on using just 4 egg's worth of egg whites next time around. This recipe seems to be very receptive to lowfat substitutions. Everyone loved the dish!

My two-year-old loves corn, and since fresh sweet corn season is over for the year, I decided to make this for her. I used half-and-half and 2% milk instead of the whipping cream and whole milk, and slightly decreased the amount of sugar. I also followed the suggestion of leaving a small amount of the corn kernels whole. She inhaled her first serving and asked for more. Mama thought it was pretty good too.

I was really surprised that something so easy could be so good. Delicious. I decreased the sugar to 5 tablespoons. It took about an hour to brown and set instead of the 45 minutes stated. Next time think I will follow reviewer from Charleston WV and put in some kernels whole. It was even better warmed up the next day.

I made this for family and friends and got rave reviews. I used fresh corn (we live in the Midwest!) and lightened it a bit by using whole milk and 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream. I also did not puree it all untill smooth - I left about 1/2 cup of kernels whole for texture. Wonderful!

After reviewing several corn recipes from Epicurious I decided to make this one. It went over very well, everyone wanted the recipe.
