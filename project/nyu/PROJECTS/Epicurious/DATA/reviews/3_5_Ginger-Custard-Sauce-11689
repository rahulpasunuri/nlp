I love this sauce with fried plum ravioli. BUT I make it like a normal custard and I only use ginger. Scald the cream, don't boil it. Whisk the eggs and sugar by hand and add the hot crem in small batches, whisking hard with each addition (tempering) until all combined. Then set bowl over a pot of simmering water and stir witha wooden spoon until thick enough to draw finger through and ON the spoon. It's really good!

Just the perfect accompaniment to a simple dessert of pound cake and fresh berries. A very nice hint of ginger worked well with the blackberries. Will definitely keep this close by for a quick, simple dessert.
