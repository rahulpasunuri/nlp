I've been making this candy for over 2 years now and never a problem. The directions need to be followed very carefully and I find it best to have someone else pour in the Baking Soda, salt and Almonds while I stir, for a more consistent mix. It hardens FAST (as soon as the foaming stops, so you have to get it out of the pan and spread thin very quickly. It is still a favorite with my friends and family. (see my 2001 comments)

I've made this recipe for the last 6 years or so. It is excellent, but you have to add MUCH less baking soda (that's what gives that bad fluffy texture). I do one teaspoon of soda and it is great.

If you have a candy thermometer, this recipe is easy to make--it's just not very good. The texture of the brittle is puffy/crunchy--like styrofoam. I made it to include with other cookies/candies to give away for Xmas but ended up throwing it out. Make buttercrunch candy (toffee) it's much better.

Alas, there is no way to give this recipe less than one fork! I tried it not once, but twice, and both times ended up with a panful of simulated Martian landscape, and a house full of the fragrance of burnt sugar. After the first disaster, I checked the quantities and even tested my candy thermometer. All to no avail. Finally, I resorted to the old standby, the Joy of Cooking, and got perfectly delightful brittle on the first try.

If you like brittle, you'll absolutely love this. IT is so easy to make and every one asks me when I'm making it again. I use minature tollhouse semi-sweet morsels for easy application and a better taste than bittersweet. It also melts great without having to spread it out.

After failing with a recipe from the Stewart site, I found this one & it tastes great! You do need to work quickly-- don't stir in the kettle too long after adding the final ingredients. A new holiday tradition.

This was my annual Xmas candy disaster, but ultimately it turned out tasty. Know something about brittle making before you try it! Volume will qintuple when you add soda & salt; don't work fast, work at lightning speed, or whole thing will harden in the pot (as happened to me).
