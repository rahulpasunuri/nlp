I love this recipe and make it all the time. I normally add some fresh black pepper, cumin and Roma tomatoes.

This was awesome! I never have put raw garlic in my guac, but it was nummy....

I love this recipe and make it all the time. It's as low cal as guacamole can be and very very tasty. I like to use white onion.

I love guac and this is OK. Needs hot sauce and tomato. It also has a bit too much cilantro.

I LOVE cilantro, and this recipe as-is has too much. I made it using 1/2 cup of chopped cilantro per avocado (tripled the recipe) -- and it is totally out of hand. Then I thought about it and I think it should be 1/2 cup of cilantro per avocado and THEN chop it. Right? My husband likes it... but I just can't taste the avocadoes at all!! And trust me, I love cilantro, but this is just a bit too much.

I've made this guacamole a number of times and every time I make it someone asks for the recipe. I always use more than one avocado (usually at least 4) and I increase the amount of salt and lime juice in proportion. The rest of the ingredients I leave at the amounts in the recipe. This guacamole is better than most restaurant guacamoles I've had.

A solid guac recipe. I would suggest mixing in your cilantro to taste. A lot of people don't like a strong cilantro component in their guac.

I was worried as I made the dish that it was looking like way too much cilantro and not enough avocado. Was I wrong! It was delicious, and the other guests at the party I brought it to devoured it. It's not a "traditional" guacamole, but it's just as delicious and, in my opinion, even more refreshing on a hot summer day.

Altered slightly to taste; less cilantro, more jalapeno.... I didn't like guacamole until I made this for a friend, and now this is a summer staple.

Guacamole? More like Cilantro Dip with a little avacado for filler. I had to double the avacado because the cilantro flavor was so strong. Four avacados might have been better. Maybe it's my Midwest taste buds, but it was not the guacamole flavor I know and love. And we do have authentic Mexican restaurants in my small town.

Fantastic "as is"! We make this all the time!

This is a wonderful guacamole with no tomatoes. Interestingly, it's the identical recipe used by Staci Raymond at the Chipotle Mexican Grill in Phoenix.

What can I say- yum! Simple, easy, delicious!

Very hot and yummie! I am always looking for a way to give things a little kick and this was a great way to take quac that I love and make it spicy!

Leave some chunks of avocado - don't make a smooth paste. Most people prefer it this way. A sprinkle of small radish chunks adds a great crunch! Consider also, adding a bit of olive oil - helps blend the flavors.

Unspeakably good. My boyfriend has been known to request guacamole for dinner since I found this recipe, and then to promptly eat an entire recipe. I have to double it in self-defense.

Got rave reviews. (3 requests for the recipe so far!) Too much cilantro though (and I love cilantro!) Don't add all the cilanto at once in case you agree with me. My store didn't have any serrano peppers so I used one really hot little guy (I don't know what it is) Now I know why they say to wear gloves when cutting hot peppers. My fingers still burn and it's 12 hours later!!

I used this recipe for a school project, every one in my class (and more) said it was GREAT!!

This is truly the best guacomole recipe I've ever come across. Rave reviews from the partygoers! I added chopped fresh tomatos as well. It's just as good as the fresh guac served at my favorite restaurant, Rosa Mexicano.

Best guacamole recipe I've tried. I did add seeded, chopped plum tomatoes, and had to substitute jalapenos for serranos, but loved the results!

This is the guacamole recipe that I've been using for years. Love it.

this was my first attempt at making guacamole, using this recipe, and i have to say how impressed i was with the outcome. not only was this recipe very simple and fast to make, but it was delicious. i followed the recipe verbatim, but next time i think that i will make some alterations, such as more lime juice and adding a tomato as suggested by other reviewers. also, i will add more peppers, since i am a big fan of spicy foods. i definitely plan on making more of this guacamole soon.

I made this for a mexican potluck; it was the first thing to go! I added the one tomato as already suggested. I couldn't find any seranno chilies so I reallly improvised w/one habenerro and a small green pepper. Fortunately I'm spending this year in West Africa where avocados are about 15 cents because I plan to make it again and often!

I get nothing but raves with this recipe. I add plum tomatoes as another reader suggested and I do not over mash the avocado.

Rating: 4
simply fantastic. i've already made it many times, and each time it disappears very fast. since the mashing part is quite muscle instensive, i've tried using food processor to do the mashing -- my conclusion is that the "chuncky" home-made texture you get from hand-mashing suits this guacamole much better.

This was great, but only after I made some adjustments: I used one clove of garlic; I used red onion; I added juice of half a lime. The 2 serrano peppers was plenty of spice for me!!!

I made this for a football party and it was gone in 15 minutes!! Everone loved it!! I do do suggest adding one tomato and more lime juice to the recipe!!! YUM!!

I did not find this spicy enough and may have made a mistake in using a large Florida Avacado instead of the smaller California fruits. I added tomato and chili powder but need to crank up the spices more next time.

I added a tomato and extra lime juice and serrano pepper. Also used a red onion. It was excellent and plently spicy.

Good "base" recipe. Don't stop with 2Tb lime juice, however. Squeeze LOTS of fresh lime juice into this recipe. Definitely use a seeded, chopped Roma tomato. Can also use jalepenos instead of chiles. Change the onion to a red onion. Add Cumin and fresh black pepper. Plenty of fresh garlic. Stir together. Top with crumbled feta cheese. chill. Dig in! Nothing tastes better!!

Made this for a party, and even non guacamole eaters were scraping the bowl clean. Ands some new flavors and just the right amount of heat to a classic.

I made this using all listed ingredients the first time; the second time I omitted the cilantro and chiles and added a freshly chopped tomato and more salt & pepper and it was MUCH better!!

I WOULD LIKE ONE ROMA TOMATO ADDED

Fantastic dish, but like other reviewer I added tomatoes and it only made it better. I'll make again for sure.

I added diced tomato and it was great. I'll definitely be making this again real soon.

Very authentic taste! For large bowl, place avocado pits in bowl and spoon guacamole on top. Will keep without turning brown for several hours. Easy to keep fresh for large party.
