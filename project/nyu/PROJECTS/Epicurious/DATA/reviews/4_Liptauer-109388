Wish my mother had this in her recipe file! I substituted quark for the cottage cheese and added chopped scallions as suggested by other reviewers - YUM!!

As one reviewer suggested, I substituted chopped scallions for the capers & cornichons, since I didn't have either on hand. I also added a couple of garlic cloves, a splash of Worcestershire sauce, and went heavy on the seasonings. Great! This recipe lends itself to experimentation, and there are a lot of ways to make liptauer, so have fun with it!

Very nice retro recipe. I have a similar one -- 8 oz cream cheese, 8 oz cottage cheese, 4 oz butter, 2 oz beer, 3 T freshly-ground caraway seeds, 2 T mustard, 2 T chopped cornichons, 2 T minced onions, 2 T sweet paprika, 1 T anchovy paste.

Made slight changes to this, but the result is outstanding!!! I omitted the cottage cheese, and mustard. Added approx. 1 Tbs. of anchovie paste and reduced the batch to a half. This is a possitively delightful spread. Serving with pumpernickel pretzels and fresh radishes, for our Thanksgiving apps. Oh, next time I won't add any salt, as the cornichons and capers are salty enough. Happy Thanksgiving!!!!

Great recipe! to make quark, mix 1 ltr buttermilk that has set out over night with 1 ltr of whole milk and drain in a cheesecloth. Grussy!

My Dad (Hungarian born) and Mom (Swedish) prepared this for years as part of any hors doeuvres spread. I cannot spell the name in Hungarian, but I will say theirs had butter in it also (room temp butter and hard type cream cheese)...they did not use the capers however I can see that being a suitable addition ..and always Szeged sweet paprika; and the caraway seeds are kind of a must!. It is very good... however I do not think great for coronary arteries!

I live in the UK and couldnt get hold of caraway seeds and the store was out of cornichons, so I used more capers and a small red onion instead. I kept it in the fridge for two hours before eating it, and found it a bit bland. I'm going on a caraway seed hunt and will attempt this again, and do it with the listed ingredients and perhaps making it the day before to see if the flavour is stronger?

There are undoubtedly as many recipes for Liptauer as there are for goulash or any other Jewish/Central European delicacy, but this recipe is pretty darn good. Strangely enough, like Nigella, my grandmother also taught my sister and I to make "creme rose" as she called it, and I cherish the recipe. In my nagymama's version, cottage cheese is never used, making it easier to get a smooth consistency with just cream cheese. Use ONLY sweet paprika, never hot. Also, instead of capers and cornichons, use 1/2 bunch of chopped green onions. I swear that's what makes this dip the addictive treat it is. This spread is absolutely heavenly on sour dough or with bell peppers.
