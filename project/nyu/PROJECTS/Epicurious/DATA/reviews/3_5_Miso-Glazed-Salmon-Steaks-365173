Don't bother. There are lots of delicious sesame oil/ginger type marinades that are better. The miso doesn't add anything, in my opinion.

we eat salmon two or more days a week. So, anything that varies it up a bit is welcome. THis is a simple, tasty and quick-prep sauce that my wife and daughter love. PS--I recommend ignoring the extra salt and making sure you use Mirin.

Not sure I would make it again. I did not include the salt and still found this too salty for my liking. My husband liked it though!

Really easy and delicious. An obvious dish for pairing with an Asian salad or slaw.

This recipe is very easy and is more mellow than you would think. We used it on fillets, rather than steaks so make sure you move around the fish so that the broil cameralizes evenly around the fish.

We love this quick easy salmon dish. It works for fillets as well as for steaks. I use red miso if I am out of white. I definitely agree with others about the salt. Miso adds enough. Great paired with rice and a stir fry.

We love simple grilled salmon but occasionally want a change. This one will definitely go into the repeat file. Great flavor and even easier than grilling. My market didn't have steaks but did have thick fillets formed into the shape of steaks and it worked beautifully, nice and crispy on on the top and bottom and moist on the inside. I also omitted the salt as the miso brings plently.

Delish! Made this with a big one pound slab of salmon steak and it only needed 3 minutes on each side, total of 6 minutes on the broiler at 550 F. Anything more would dry out the salmon and that would be a crime.

Good but not great. I don't see what the big fuss is about miso - it just tastes salty to me. I liked that the recipe was so quick and easy, and the salmon itself was delicious, but the glaze just tasted like very salty ginger. Definitely do not add more salt than what is already in the miso!!

Wow! This was outstanding--broiling the fish allowed it to get a yummy, crusty glaze while still keeping the fish tender on the inside.

WAY too salty. We had to scrape the miso glaze off just so we could eat it.

Solid salmon recipe. Would have given it 3 forks but it gets 4 for being fast, easy, and I already had all of the ingredients minus the fresh fish. Only a few slight variations...I used Pam spray instead of vegetable oil, approx 6-8 oz steaks instead of 10-12 oz (to be more portion-control friendly), and red miso instead of white miso. I left out the sprinkling with salt step because if you've ever cooked with miso before, you know that it is very salty. I let the steaks marinate for the full hour before broiling. Note that some of the thick marinade will "melt" off during cooking, but don't worry this is a good thing cause it allows the fish to get a beautiful, slightly crisp texture around the edges. The fresh squeezed lime adds a nice burst of flavor. Served with brown rice w/ sambal oelek, baby bok choy, and Malbec.

Excellent. Grilled the fish and lost some of the glaze in the process but excellent taste

Made this recipe last week. It was so easy and so delicious! My whole family loved it. You could easily use the miso coating on other types of fish as well. Can't wait to make it again!

Yum, Yum, Yum! I, too could not get steaks, but cut a 1 lb. filet in thirds and cooked 4 minutes a side with the flesh side down first and skin down last. My 8 year old loved it.

In my house, I am the cook--but when my husband does do the cooking, he makes salmon, and always very well. He has been moping for the past three days since I made this recipe, though, because now I am the reigning salmon queen! This is by far the best salmon I have ever made or eaten...the miso melts into the fat and creates an almost liquid texture out of the meat. The broiler also adds a crispness to the top of the fish, which I love (though I had to use 4 6 oz. fillets, as my fresh seafood butcher doesn't carry steaks). It's absolutely perfect. Served with sesame green beans and a ginger-cilantro rice, also from epicurious, and had our guests asking for thirds!
