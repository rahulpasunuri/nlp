My husband made this for our family as we were recovering from a tummy bug. It is a simple yet soothing recipe. Suggest you skin an organic whole chicken, add 2 bay leaves, only add back in the carrots after cooking chicken at medium heat for about an hour. Increased rice to 1 Cup since had more broth. Perfect. Plenty of broth for those who only want liquids and just hearty enough for others.

Following the ingredients exactly, I used all the boney parts I had left over from cutting up farm chickens. This made just the right combination for a tasty chicken stock!

I made the recipe exactly as stated (made a double batch), and I found it delightfully simple, comforting, and delicious. Regarding some of the other reviews suggesting that you make a thousand modifications and additions: ultimately, none of these reviews are actually for the recipe here. I'm sure everything they made was also delicious, but if you are looking for a simple, clean soup just do what the recipe says, and you'll probably be very pleased with the results. I'll go back to this recipe whenever I'm craving some hearty chicken soup.

Good basic soup recipe as long as you make some modifications. I took some user suggestions and used 6 cups chicken broth and 4 cups water. I only had chicken breast on hand. So I boiled it and then shredded the chicken. I also didnt strain the broth after cooking. I just quartered the onion so I could pull it out as I didnt want onion pieces in the soup. I also used two bay leafs and added some oregano, basil and a little thyme.Still a easy recipe and it taste great!

Made quite a few adaptations based on other's reviews and was very pleased with how this turned out! I used a whole chicken, boiled and made my own stock. Then added 2 bay leaves and extra garlic, as well as the addition of some cayenne, chili powder and cumin. Also used brown rice instead of white. With those changes, it is a definite keeper.

I've never made chicken rice soup before, in fact I've never made any kind of soup other than Beef Stew and German Pea soup. It took a little time to make it but it was well worth the effort. It tasted wonderful! I used more chicken, carrots and onions than the recipe called for but it still came out great!

This was a delicious, easy, healthy meal. Substituted two skinless chicken breasts (approximately 8oz each), omitted thighs and increased rice to 1 cup. Breasts coarsly sliced, seasoned lightly then browned in EVOO before adding to soup. Also added 4 oz pkg of dehydrated crimini mushrooms along with uncooked rice and used organic, 100% whole grain "harvest medley" rice. This is a blend of CalMati brown rice, sweet brown rice, wild rice, and heirloom red rice (sold under label of Sun West, California at Costco). Instead of parsley, I added a handful of whole leaf uncooked spinach as a garnish/extra dose of healthy goodness before serving and it was perfect!

This was really good and had a nice, light, clean flavor. Based on others' advice, I used 4 c. water and about 6 c. chicken stock, upped the veggies and garlic a bit, used a liberal hand with salt and pepper, and didn't bother straining out the celery and onions. I also used skin-on chicken breasts and leg quarters and removed the skin before shredding the chicken. I agree with those who suggested increasing the amount of rice next time. This will be a go-to recipe in cold and flu season.

Like some of the other cooks, I also used a whole chicken and ten cups of water. I also took the cooked vegetables, pureed them, and returned to the soup. I then added 1/2 cup each of diced celery and carrots and simmered for ten minutes. At the end I added 1 cup of chopped steamed kale when I put the shredded chicken back. The whole family loved it.

I tend to agree with most of the other reviewers. This is good, but not great. However, I have a very difficult time finding chicken soup recipes that I really like. I totally agree that you get a much bigger kick from the bay leave than I would have expected. Of course I did not follow the recipe as written. I had roasted a chicken yesterday and made my own stock. I took the stock, diced up the left over chicken (removed the skin). Added diced onions, baby carrots and sliced celery and other seasonings per the recipe. Brought this to a boil and added 3/4 cup of arborio rice. I'm interested to see if my kids enjoy it for dinner this evening!!!

This was wonderful! I used 4 whole chicken legs and no breasts since that's what I had. I also used half chicken stock and half water. I didn't drain the soup, just scooped out the right amount for the rice and chopped the veggies beforehand. Delish, I will make again!

Rating: 3
I thought it was delicious and hearty. I didn't have whole chicken legs though and so I just used more skinless,boneless chicken breasts. I also used Jasmine Rice from Trader Joes and it turned out just great. Oh and I drizzled some olive oil at the end for a boost of richness.

Lacks flavor. I had to add chicken broth and lots of salt before eating just so the broth had a taste. Used orzo as a previous reviewer had, that was a good touch.

Rating: 4
I love this recipe. Its simple and hearty and makes you feel great when your sick. Modifications: - double the water (and add additional bay leaf)- because the rice expands and makes the soup REALLy thick. - I add a teaspoon of dried hot red peppers (makes the soup a little spicier) My husband loves this recipe.

We didn't love this. I make the chicken and rice soup off this website where you put all ingredients (a brown rice) into the pot and cook, then take out the chicken and shred and add back. Easier and I think tastier. I also didn't really like the addition of garlic.

This is a great, basic chicken soup recipe - you just need to keep that in mind. I used long grain brown rice, a dash of chili, a little bit of cayenne pepper, doubled the garlic, added a tsp of cumin, a tblsp of spicy mustard, and a bottle of lager.(Which I think improves just about any soup!) It was a delicious, tasty soup on a snowy day.

The recipe was definitely bland but to improve on this I added extra salt, fresh squeezed limes, and cilantro instead of parsley.

Great soup on a cold winter's day! I've made it both straining it and not; I don't think it is a necessary step and worth the extra mess. I also add dumplings for my hungry husband!

We also felt this was a bit bland - okay just nothing special. After cooking the chicken with the vegetables, I set them aside and boiled bow-tie pasta to include in place of the rice. Put everything back together and heated through. Still haven't found THE chicken soup recipie I want to keep.

My pot holds only 8 cups so I used about 6 cups of water and a small frying chicken -- by mistake I added orzo rather than long-grain rice, but it was a happy mistake. I will use this recipe again, it is well worth it.

I left the skin on the chicken. I then refrigerated the completed soup and skimmed off the fat. After reheating, I thought the broth was a little bland, so I added freshly ground black pepper and cumin. Also added more salt than it called for. All in all, a great gloomy day soup.

DELICIOUS!! I'm eating it as I write this review. I've got a horrible head cold and chicken soup was the only thing I wanted, but I didn't want canned, I wanted fresh, homemade, soup. This is it! I added a handful of fresh mushrooms for fun. Yummy! This is a keeper.

This was great. This kids are helping with the next batch. I agree with the others - Take most of the skin off of a whole chicken and use 10 cups of water. Easy and delicious.

I made this soup for my in-laws who were both sick with the flu. This is a delicious recipe and I will definitely make it again and again!

I realize that most people believe that skinless white meat chicken is healthier. However I have never made a very good broth with breasts. A FAR MORE FLAVORFUL broth can be attained w/thighs (w/skin). Simply skim the soup later or the next day to remove any excess fat.

Maybe I missed something in the directions, but this was a pretty bland dish. I did as others had done and left all the veggies in, but it didn't seem to help.

I would definitely make this soup again. I have never made a chicken & rice soup that I liked, but this one is delicious! I used a whole chicken without skin in 10 cups water. I only removed the bay leaf, and I pureed the onion & celery in the blender. Very easy for an inexperienced soup maker.

Very good. I used a whole chicken, used ten cups of water, and discarded only the bay leaf. Good flavor, and was better the secon day.

Ah, a soup that warms right down to your toes. I kept all the cooked veggies, pureed them, and returned them to the soup. Lovely, and a hit with all age groups. Add this recipe to your collection.

I needed a 'recovery' dish for a few heary party goers the next day and prepared this soup. It was a great hit with all. No one could believe that the only seasoning was bay leaf, salt and pepper. It was even better the next day.

I loved this recipe. It was easy to make and turned out delicious. I used a whole chicken rather than the pieces. I did remove the skin though. It also said to discard all the veges except the carrots. I kept them all and it made the soup very tasty. I will definitely make it again.

With all due respect to the reviewer from Vancouver, I'm rather puzzled by the troubles you describe with this recipe. If you used the indicated 1 1/2 cups of broth to cook the rice with you should have about 6 to 6 1/2 cups of broth left to add to the cooked rice to complete the soup. I don't really understand how you could just end up with "flavoured rice" unless you stopped "following the recipe to the teaspoon" right before the paragraph describing how to finish the soup.

Rating: 2
Is it just me, or is this soup TOO hearty? Admittedly a novice in the kitchen, I followed this recipe to the teaspoon and ended up with nothing more than flavoured rice! There was no broth left to spoon. It also seems a shame to throw away all of the extra veggies from the strainer. I think I'll bite the bullet next time and go straight to mom for a more satisfying chicken soup recipe.

So easy and so good! I made this according to the recipe. This goes into my permanent collection of recipes!

This was delicious! We added a fair amount of freshly ground pepper to the soup while it was cooking to give it an extra kick. We didn't strain the soup like the recipe says. Instead, we kept everything in the soup and added potatoes, tomatoes, zucchini, and banana squash to make the soup much heartier!
