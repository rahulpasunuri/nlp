I had a red & green themed dinner club this weekend and made these for an appetizer. I followed the recipe, except using 1# salmon, 1 whole avocado and wasabi instead of horseradish. Besides the taste, the great thing about this appetizer is not only can you make it ahead of time, but the rolls can be prepared at least 24 hrs ahead.

I served this to family over the Thanksgiving weekend, before dinner..It was a big hit - I took other reviewer's advice and didn't mix avocado w/ cream cheese..presentation was excellent! Definitely easy enough to make as a quick appetizer before dinner on any Friday night...

I rate this recipe four forks because it is delicious, beautiful, simple, elegant, transportable, uses accessible ingredients, complements many other dishes, and appeals to most palates. It is a great potluck dish. I follow the directions precisely except for using a whole avocado in the filling (better color and texture) and one pound of smoked salmon instead of a half pound. I spread the filling thinner, which makes smaller (in diameter) rolls and twice as many appetizers, so I use a slightly smaller cutter and buy two rolls of pumpernickel cocktail rye instead of one. Last night at our annual holiday party, we ran out of pumpernickel, so we used baguette slices. Guests said they missed the visual and gustatory contrast but, even so, were not about to turn down seconds and thirds. Thanks to other cooks for suggesting wasabi flavoring, leaving out gelatin, separating white (cream cheese) and green (avocado), and serving without bread; I'll try these.

In my circles, this as been known as Marc's Salmon Rolls (I haven't devulged my secret source. Everyone loves them .... I probably wouldn't get invited to parties as much without these as amunition (or bribe).

My guests loved this one. Make sure you get quality lox. I added minced chives to the cream cheese mixture which added some nice color. A trick to help cutting the roll - have a pitcher of water to dip your knife in! This is a trick I adopted from making sushi. Just dip it in the water and let the excess run off (or run the side of the knife against the pitcher to force off extra water).

Very much enjoyed this, and I think the previous posters idea of using Wasabi instead of horseradish is a good one. One warning, you really do need a very sharp knife, my first attempt I used a random, not-so-sharp knife and ended up with very thick (and no longer very round) slices.

I've made this outstanding recipe since you first published it and it's been an incredible hit with my guests each time.

Did not like this at all. Was planning to bring the dish to a party and luckily I tried it out first. The horseradish overpowered the salmon and you couldn't taste the avocado. Just awful.

This recipe was delicious. I made it for a party and it disappeared with raves. It didn't come out as pretty as i imagined because I unknowingly bought salmon that wasn't sliced superthin. the result was that there wasn't enough to flesh out the rectangle it is supposed to form, so there were gaps and the avocado mixture oozed out. but no one seemed to mind! i will make this again.

Loved this! I served this appetizer on Christmas Eve and my guests gobbled it up. It's beautiful, delicious and can be made ahead of time. Use the best smoked salmon you can find. I'd love to subsitute wasabi for the horseradish next time I make it, and I do plan on serving this again. A winner.
