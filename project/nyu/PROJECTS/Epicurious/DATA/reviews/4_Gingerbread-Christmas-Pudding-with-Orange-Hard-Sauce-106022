Cooked the cake for 1 hour and 30 minutes and it was perfectly done. My only problem was when I went to unmold the cake the top stuck! I sprayed Pam and butter the mold. Maybe I needed to let it sit for more than 15 minutes. Otherwise the cake tasted fabulous (pressed back the stuck pieces to the mold and it was okay after being cut). We looked up an English toffee sauce and served that warm on the plate with the cake on it and then topped with the hard sauce. Very English and truly addicting!

Made this for Christmas and, ss other cooks have said, all raved and said we should have it every year. Next time I'll user a larger bundt pan (my six-cup one overflowed into the cooking water) and will remember not to cover the top of the tube. Will also add the extra butter and dried currants. Great idea about the Gran Marnier in the hard sauce. Delicious!

My pudding took exactly the time it said to cook maybe I had a thin bundt pan. I did cover my hole with foil- and it turned out fine- not mushy- I really covered my pan well with foil- maybe that's the key- to just keep as much steam in as possible.

This has become our Christmas Eve dessert. I add diced crystalized ginger to the pudding. Yum! You could add some currants, too.

Pretty tasty pudding, very easy to make.

Steamed ginger pudding is probably my favourite dessert and I think that this is the best recipe I've tried in my 20 year quest. Next time will add the extra ounce of butter mentioned below. I missed out the hard sauce as I've never seen the point of it and served it with Bird's custard and cream instead.

This recipe has become the holiday dessert for my family and friends. I make it exactly as written and add a half cup small dried currants to the batter at the end of mixing. It is a no-fail recipe and everyone loves it! I usually steam it for two hours and unmold it at 15 minutes after steaming, using a small knife to loosen it from the pan. Garnished with candied kumquats it is superb!

This is really good, but .... I had a hard time getting it "done" in an hour or two. When I looked online at other pudding recipes, well, most of them said to boil for three to six hours. And, that's what this one takes. Also, I add several handsfull of dried fruit - raisins, cherries or whatever I happen to have. With those changes, it's a sure hit! I've made it for the past three or four years.

I loved this recipe. I actually used mini-bundt cake pans instead of the full sized bundt or pudding mold and they were lovely (and I suspect easier to do). I also added raisins, which helped to make it even more delicious.

I made this for Christmas dinner dessert, very easy and tasty. Didn't have enough plain orange marmalade, added home made cranberry orange marmalade. It was very good. For a more gingery flavor I added minced fresh ginger. Just the right kind of dessert.

This Christmas Pudding was just what I was looking for. Easy to make and the flavor was wonderful. I poured warmed brandy over it and flambeed it at the table.

I halved this recipe and steamed it in a small ceramic mold. It tastes like a cross between gingerbread and carrot cake--the moistest cake-type dessert I've ever had. Like other reviewers, I used Cointreau instead of brandy and had to steam for much longer than the recipe calls for. You must try this!

Ditto to the comments of Cook from Annapolis. Another enhancement I tried was to add 1/2 cup of finely chopped crystalized ginger to the final batter. Mix a scant tablespoon of flour with the ginger to distribute it well through the batter. It added just the right zing.

Followed advice of previous reviewers and steamed for 2 hours. Also used Grand Marnier in the hard sauce. My only change to the actual recipe was to use a whole stick (8 Tbsps.) of butter in the batter. the finished product won rave reviews from all dinner guests! The cake was incredibly moist and the best gingerbread I have ever had! There were 10 for dinner so I made two puddings. One did not look to be enough to serve 10 although the recipe says it serves 8 to 10. Will definitely make again!

This was amazing! Followed the advice mentioned in the previous reviews - Cook for 2 hours / do not cover the hole of the bundt pan. Added 1 cup of currents and made a custard sauce instead of the hard sauce. Reheat individual slices in the microwave for 40 seconds.

I only needed the time called for in the recipe. I used foil and made sure not to cover the center tube of the bundt pan. I then put the lid on the pan, only needing to replace water one time. The sauce was a bit too sweet and I think I added too much brandy. I will try a liquer next time.

A winner! After making this for Christmas dinner the entire family declared we have a new Christmas tradition. I agree! As other reviewers have said, cooking time is significantly longer than the recipe states.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and got rave reviews for it. I had never made a steamed pudding before and was delighted at how easy it was. I did steam it longer than the recipe instructed, taking the advice of the other reviewers. I also added about a cup of candied crystallized ginger (my family swooned) and substituted Drambuie in the hard sauce. I think this just became a new holiday tradition in my family.

Hard sauce was wonderful, what's not to love? Butter, booze and sugar...it's like lookin' in a mirror. Pudding itself was good but not amazing. I'd make it again but serve it immediately instead of waiting 2 days.

This recipe is extremely easy to make and a crowd pleaser - This is a new Christmas Tradition in our family.

Note to Readers: Be sure not to cover hole of bundt pan with the foil, because the steam will rise up from the pan and right into the batter (a big, mushy mess). This is a great cake that I make every year.

This was a HUGE hit. Wonderful pudding. Great texture. I steamed for 2 hours (which is my minimum for puddings of this type), and added 1/2 cup raisins. This dish received full marks by all who ate it!

Fabulous - this has become an instant Christmas tradition at our house. Was especially loved by my husband, who's not a big dessert fan - so a true endorsement. Easy to assemble, too. Definitely steam for 2 hours, though.

Yup - it needs 2 hours' steaming. Like another reviewer, added raisins and currants and made it better. I used Gran Mariner in the hard sauce. Big hit - will make next holiday. It is such a beautiful rich molasses brown/orange color when finished, that it dresses up any table.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was absolutely delicious. In my English family steamed puddings are a Christmas staple, and this one was loved by all. The pudding itself was wonderful, but add the orange hard sauce and it is a true treat. I warmed up the one leftover slice the next day in the microwave for 30 seconds and it was just as good. This will become a regular at the holiday table. However, as the other cooks experienced, it takes nearly 2 hours to steam, not the 1 hour 25 minutes that the recipe states (which as a little frustrating as I kept taking it out of the boiling water to check).

Like another user of the recipe, I found it unsolidified even after 2+ hrs steaming - so I finished it in the oven at 250 for about 20-25 mins and it turned out a treat ! I also added to the batter a generous handful of golden raisins shaken with flour - It is much more delicious than "plum pudding" and easy to make.

This smelled great, but it was nowhere near done in the time suggested. I steamed it an hour longer and, when unmolded, the top was still a gelatinous mess! Where did I go wrong?

Loved this! Will use it every Christmas. Added minced sugared ginger instead of orange peal.
