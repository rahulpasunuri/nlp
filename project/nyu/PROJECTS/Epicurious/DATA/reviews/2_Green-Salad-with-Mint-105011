I was intrigued by the simplicity of this salad and I had a craving for mint. With a few minor modifications, it was refreshing and delicious (and, most importantly, quick and easy) I added one minced shallot to the dressing along with a teaspoon of honey. I whisked the dressing in a bowl before tossing with the greens.

There is nothing really new or spectacular about this recipe..in summer i often add mint to my green salads...its ok...First of all I I like only ripe tomatoes. and I dont feel its a good idea to mix tomatoes in a green salad for the foolowing reasons.. 1) I think delicate greens should be by themselves ,and tomatoes would cloud this ability to appreciate the subtle tsases 2.aaa0 tomatoes tend to make greens very soggy after sitting a few minutes on the table un less they are hard, and i dont like eating hard tomatoes
