Raves for spicier version with garlic, red onion, red pepper flakes, 1/2 cup Italian bread crumbs, 1 cup parmesan & mozzarella, and fresh parsley, oregano, and basil.

After a trip to a friend's garden, this was a lovely dinner. On the light side as a main course, but so tasty. I used basil instead and added some onions. Yumm.

We have a CSA share, and get lots of corn and tomatoes--this is my favorite way to use them. Other herbs work well if you don't have dill, and I agree w/chef's notes that the salt & pepper are key. But overall, a great summer dish!

i'm afraid to say this dish had a lot to be desired. it fell apart needed a good binder to make it a success...i think a good zuchinni pie is the way to go.

I used basil instead of dill, added hot pepper to the cheese and bread crumbs, grated the zucchini and added all the ingredients to a store-bought pie crust. Yumm! I would go a little easier on the black pepper next time, but will definitely make again. My family loved it!

Surprisingly good. I made a half-portion in a Pyrex pie plate with fresh corn, zucchini, couple of green onions, a little thyme, red pepper flake, salt and melted butter. Then used probably equal amounts of panko bread crumbs and fresh grated parmesean cheese with a little more melted butter for the topping. Took 45 mins. in a 375* oven, but turned out great. Very simple but impressive summer dish. Only to be made with fresh ingredients.

Add a chopped onion for more flavor.

This was a great summer recipe! I had all the ingredients on hand - used dried dill and it worked fine (will try basil next time). Only thing I added was some red pepper flakes (2 tbls) to the cheese/breadcrumb mix for the top. Will definitely make this all summer!

I love zucchini, but I thought the recipe was really bland.

A great, fresh summer meal. Using fresh corn made all the difference. I substituted crumbled goat chees for romano and it was very tasty.

I loved the fresh taste and parmesan crust. However, my husband was less than impressed and called it "bland". I blame his lack of enthusiasm on his preference for meat and potatoes. Make at your own risk.

Quick and easy, although not too substantial as a main course. For a light dinner, it was nicely complemented by garlic bread. I skipped the breadcrumbs and added more cheese.

A little bland, but if your garden is overflowing with corn, zucchini, and tomatoes, this recipe will help reduce your inventory.

I used the dill and thought the vegetable combination was great. I think I'll use more cheese and less breadcrumbs next time around.

ok, I really screwed the recipe up because I didn't read it all the way through, but it didn't matter. It all worked anyway. I hate dill so replaced it with basil, cut the zuchinni into rounds, used frozen corn & mixed 1/2 the tomatoes in with the corn & zuchinni before I realized you weren't suppose to. I left out most of the salt & added lots of pepper. It was really pretty darn good.
