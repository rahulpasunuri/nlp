So delicious, and about as easy as can be. My salsas usually have roasted or cooked tomatillos, or at least the salsas are usually cooked after blending - this raw salsa is very flavorful just as it is.

This is an excellent accompaniment to BBQ chicken - really simple to prepare with lots of fresh flavour!

Why no lime juice? If you put in a tablespoon of some kind of acid, whether lime juice or your choice of vinegar, it will take it over the top. There's already some tartness, but it's not multidimensional. Still a delicious recipe, though!

This was great. Fresh, super easy to make, and the perfect topping for the carnitas tacos!
