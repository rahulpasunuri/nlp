I usually do pretty well with recipes that I'm making for the first time. I followed this one to the letter, and the cookies were a disaster. The dough was dry and crumbly, too dry and crumbly to cut, and the cookies I did manage to cut just burnt in the oven. The entire house smelled like burnt almonds. I was trying to replicate those almond thins that Jules deStrooper makes, but this recipe was not even close.

My boyfriend and I took these cookies to a holiday office party. We are college students with small kitchens and had to make some substitutions: walnuts for almonds, vanilla extract for almond extract and honey for corn syrup. The batch did not make more than 35 cookies, but they tasted wonderful.

I was worried because the dough never really came together in the bowl, but I pressed it into a log and refrigerated overnight, and it sliced up cleanly the next day. They were a great accompaniment to lemon ice cream.

These were very good. At first I balked (right in the middle of putting them together) because I suddenly realized no egg was called for. But the dough does bind (the same way that pie dough does) and they came out buttery and delicious. I am sending these as a birthday treat. I am sure they will not disappoint!

I loved these cookies! They have a nice light flavor and are really crispy. My cookies had more of a "finger" shape, rather than the squares pictured in the recipe (my dough-log was a near-flat rectangle that ran the length of a half-sheet pan, and cookies do not spread when baking). Would definitely make these again!

I made these for a barbecue and evryone loved. They were ard to cut because of the nuts. Is there a trick to this that I don't know?
