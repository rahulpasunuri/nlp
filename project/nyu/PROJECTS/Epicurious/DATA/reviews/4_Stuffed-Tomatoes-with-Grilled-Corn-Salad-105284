i made this for a beach bbq a few weeks ago. I did add a little wild rice and goat cheese to the mixture and it was amazing! I also used plum tomatoes and just cut the tops off.

I really like this recipe! I cut the tops of the tomatos instead of halving them..I also mixed some goat cheese into the salad aswell as using cheese on top..refridgerated it for about 30 min..than stuffed the tomatos..and again refridgerated the for about 30 min before serving..it really brought out the flavors and let the juices penetrate into the tomatos! It was delicious!!!:) I can't wait to try this recipe w stuffed cherry tomatos to use as an appetizer!! I bet it will b a hit!!

I was very disappointed with this recipe. I used all fresh ingredients from my garden, and followed the recipe to the T. Still, I didn't like these. I felt that the lime and cilantro over powered the corn and tomato. The goat cheese was good, but not enough. I even tried these the next day to see if the flavors had blended at all. They tasted the same. This is one of the few recipes I've tried from this site that I will not make again. It would require so many adjustments that they would make it a new recipe altogether.

Excellent addition to a cocktail party by using cherry tomatoes instead of the larger beefsteak ones. A little more effort, but my guests loved the light bite.

Delicious. Great presentation effect, and the flavor is very pleasantly summery. Quite a bit of work for an appetizer type dish (stove grilling, the whole thing took about 30 minutes active time), but the taste may be worth it.

We had this last night at a friend's house. It was paired with lobster. I could have eaten two of these and forgotten the lobster, that is how yummy it was. I can't wait to make it and have it again!

This was good. I added goat cheese to the corn mixture as well as placing it on top. I loved the taste but it seemed to be lacking something in presentation. Wondered about a light sauce or vinaigrette to enhance the taste as well as the visual presentation. Any suggestions?

Made this with 'Stuffed Peppers with Mozarella and Basil', both for a cold summer lunch. Am in the city, so used frozen corn and grilled the pepper over the stove. Wait till the pepper is black and peel off the black parts to reveal a lovely grilled pepper. Omit the 'tomato solids' for best results. the central flavor note you want to hit is tomato + corn, which is a beautiful summer flavor. For stronger top notes, I would substitute finely chopped green onion for shallots. Chill the plates and chill the tomatoes before serving.

Absolutely loved it. Next time I will stuff the tomatoes well in advance to give the dressing enough time to penetrate the tomatoes.

This is an excellent recipe. Tastes great! I have used cottage cheese instead of goat cheese with great results.

I've made this dish a few times, always with excellent results. I use feta instead of goat cheese. I usually have some leftover corn salad, which works wonderfully as salsa the next day. This dish is pretty to look at, and is a great addition to any summer meal.

I have made this recipe many times and it was always greeted with rave reviews. I usually skip the corn roasting and just thaw a bag of frozen roasted corn from Trader Joe's...this way I can make this dish in the winter too by substituting chopped cherry tomatoes for the beefsteak tomatoes.

Really enjoyed this recipe. I added chopped cooked bacon and chopped artichoke hearts. Colorful and delicious!

yum. Like previous reviewers I would make this even without stuffing the salad into the tomatoes.

Loved this as a salad...grilled the corn, removed from husks, added the grilled red pepper and other ingredients; but served as a salad on top of a bed of sliced red and yellow tomatoes. Made a beautiful presentation....fresh and delicious as a side dish or summer salad.

This salad is fabulous!! I substituted feta for the goat cheese, but I followed the exact recipe otherwise. I wish I had made enough for everyone to have two tomatoes worth, because everyone was longing for more! I put extra feta out on the table. I made this with two other recipes from Epicurious.com: Pan-Seared Tilapia with Chile Lime Butter (yummy!) and Mexican White Rice. My dinner party was a hit!

This is a very pretty recipe. I think I would use feta instead of plain goat cheese, it needs the saltyness. I did mix a little cheese into the corn mixture and I think the other reviewer was right, that helps balance the spicyness. I had to use smaller tomatoes and even though it was pretty much the height of the summer, the tomatoes were very tough. If I didn't have perfect tomatoes next time I might broil them for a few minutes so they aren't so crisp.

This was a great salad. I didn't stuff tomatoes, but just added them to the mixture. It was a big hit. I doubled the recipe to serve fourteen, and it was almost all gone. Added a little extra corn. The goat cheese was perfect!

Excellent -- I left out the goat cheese, which I love, because I didn't have any in the refrigerator and it was still wonderful. I served it with fish tacos and Coronas -- delish!

Excellent lunch. I added a little goat's cheese into the corn mixture. It helped to balance out the spice. Great taste and super easy.

THIS SOUNDS LIKE A WONDERFUL RECIPE FOR THE SUMMERTIME.

This recipe is fabulous! The goat cheese is a must to balance all the flavors...and I'm not a huge goat cheese fanatic. Its better after it sits a while to let the flavors meld.

This was an amazing recipe . I did alter it a bit. Instead of cutting the tomatoes in half I just cut off the top to make them deeper. Also I did away with all the insides and and used the excess from the tops in the mix. I took the end result one step further by baking them for 20 minutes. I then added the goat cheese and put them in the broiler until the goat cheese turned slightly brown. Great for a cold day!

I didn't stuff the tomatoes-- just cut them up in the salad. Extra jalapeno, and skip the goat cheese. This was a huge hit with my husband, and I thought it was quite good. next time I might try using fresh red pepper versus grilled pepper -- the crunch might be a welcome addition. A GREAT way to use up corn that is not as sweet as we like to eat on the cob. PS - on the second try, I did use fresh red peppers and very little olive oil. Healthier and even better tasting.

Very nice flavor and presentation! It has inspired me to experiment with other stuffings. After halving the tomatoes, we used a regular small spoon to take out the seeds before removing the solids. Worked great.

I made this for the 4th of July and everyone thought it was pretty and tasted good. Strong flavors though for children. I sure wish I could have found some tomatoes that had some taste to them.

I make this corn salad throughou the year. It's especially good with grilled fish or seafood. I usually leave it out of the tomato cups but add some tomato to the mix. I also add one can of rinsed black beans to give it some oompf. Other than those changes, whenever I try to alter the rest of the ingredients, it always turns out less exciting so now I stick to the suggested portions.

LOVE IT!! I made this for a cookout so I didn't stuff the tomatoes - I madde the salad and served it on a big green platter surrounded by tomato wedges. Beautiful colors and tasted GREAT! It has a wonderful fresh flavor and went well with a menu of steak/chicken skewers and potato salad. Definitely a keeper!

This was the perfect side dish for a dinner party we were having.Get good fresh corn. Couldn't find Beefsteak tomatoes, so I used whole medium to small sized farmstand tomatoes.Had difficulty seperating the seeds from the tomato solids.Time consuming - but worth it!

Made this for a dinner party just last weekend; everyone raved. It's gorgeous on the plate, and shows a great complexity of subtle flavors. I roasted the corn in the oven and peeled the tomatoes to make them easier to eat. Just delicious, and I could assemble it all before my guests arrived! Takes a little time, but is worth the investment.

An easily varied recipe that can be changed to reflect what ingredients you have on hand and your time availability. I used corn on the cob that I boiled quickly and cut from the cob, and bottled roasted peppers to save time. I also used basil rather than cilantro and lemon rather than lime juice. The final result was scrumptious -- great flavor, texture, and presentation. An excellent summer dish.

I thought this recipe was refreshing and yummy. Perfect for a summer meal side dish. My boyfriend just thought "it tasted funny". To cut prep time, I used frozen corn and roasted it in the oven. Also used a jar of roasted red peppers.

Good summer vegie/salad. It was simple to make but definitely time consuming. It can be made ahead so would be a nice presentation for company. I added the crumbled feta to the salad instead of sprinkling it on top.

Though it is a little time consuming, the results are worth the effort. I used roasted red bell peppers in the jar to save some time. Grilling the corn adds a unique flavor. The presentation is beautiful and it tastes as good as it looks!
