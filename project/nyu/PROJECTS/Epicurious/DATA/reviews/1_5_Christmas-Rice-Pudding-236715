Not so good. The recipe is off and as other reviewers said there is not enough water in initial cooking and not enough sugar. Pretty simple dish so I would just try another recipe.

I also had to add a bit more water to cook rice initially. I also added a bit more sugar. It dries up in the fridge if you don't serve immediately, but just add some cream/milk and it warms up nicely in the microwave. The cinammon sticks is the key ingredient, no doubt!

This is pretty good, but needed a little more sugar. I added 2 Tbsp. of sugar toward the end, and used a bit of ground cinnamon at the beginning and toward the end since I didn't have any sticks in the house. I also had to add about 1/3 - 1/2 cup of water two times toward the end since the rice was getting too dry. Finally, I added a little vanilla extract, too. This was much faster than baked rice pudding and not too sweet like a lot of puddings... I'm having some for breakfast.
