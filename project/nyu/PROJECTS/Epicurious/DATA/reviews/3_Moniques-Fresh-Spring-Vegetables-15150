How my husband laughed when I proposed making this recipe! He said I could cook up a box of Bird's Eye Peas & Carrots and get exactly the same dish. But I stuck with it, and I'm glad I did. This is delicious and fast if you take the following shortcuts: don't even think about shelling 4 lbs. of fresh peas! A 20-oz package of petite (baby) peas is fine in this, and don't try to peel and slice fresh pearl onions, either. Plunge them into boiling water for 1 minute, then squeeze out the onion inside. Add the onions together with the peas and lettuce at the very last, then cook for 3-5 minutes only. A little veal glacee in the water would be nice. Another Tablesp butter at the last helped bind the flavors. And this badly needs an herb. I added 1 teaspoon fresh tarragon (because I had it) and it was just enough to perfume the dish, not dominate it. P.S. Guess who ate two huge helpings and loved it?
