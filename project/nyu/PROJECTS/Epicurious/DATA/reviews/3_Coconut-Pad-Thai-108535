This is an amazing raw, vegan, and super healthy salad based on the flavors of Pad Thai, though it is definitely not Pad Thai. Less laborious than it seems and super delicious! If anyone is seeking a lighter version of Pad Thai, this is the best way to do it! Even my skeptical boyfriend loved it. Between the two of us, there were no leftovers. I did include shrimp and Sriracha on the boyfriends plate :) you can see a pic of my entree here: http://www.eatstretchlovelife.com/3/post/2013/04/coconut-pad-thai-salad.html I did not go through the process of tamarin pulp from a block, but switched it out with tamarind paste. I also did not have fresh serrano's on hand so replaced them with dried miniature Thai chiles.

A note to future cooks, the tamarind steps can be omitted by using frozen tamarind pulp found in the spanish/latin sections of grocery stores or in spanish/latin markets. Just thaw the pulp and use as is, no seeds, no soaking.

if anyone is wondering why you might substitute coconut for noodles...altho high in fat, coconut is a nutritious WHOLE FOOD. noodles are not...and the dish is otherwise raw, which does not kill the enzymes needed to digest itself. if you are looking for a lower-fat version of raw, healthy pad-thai...you can use a zester to make long thin "noodles" out of zucchini and carrots as well!

this is not a low fat recipe - I think it is misfiled - and should be low carb instead!!

Actually - i am intrigued by this (very labourious looking) recipe - however i just can't get over the fear of eating a plate of coconut... Is this recipe actually low fat (as it is tagged)? Is there some coconut/fat secret that i do not know about?...

I have a feeling this recipe was designed for "low carb". That's the only reason I can see for having a Pad Thai recipe without the noodles.

A nice combination, but requires too much time. You can also prepare half the sauce, vinaigrette and coconut slices, it'll be just enough.

True, the time involved for this dish is NOT inconsiderable. But we about melted with pure food joy when it finally came time to eat. It was really, really good- it is better than any pad thai I've had in a restaurant. It was my first conscious introduction to tamarind, and I am completely sold on it. It is worth the extra effort in my opinion, if it is available to you. I WAS confused by the white coconuts... okay, I admit, I did end up gingerly tasting the HUSKS of the coconuts before re-reading the recipe, and realizing the edible part is trapped on the INSIDE. Once that mystery was cleared up, everything was just fine. Meanwhile, being dubious about the potential success (and fat content) of the coconut, I cooked up some rice noodles, which were also good. Things I discovered on the way- 1) canned almond paste is NOT the same as almond butter. Paste is loaded with sugar. 2) all bean sprouts are not created equal. I would drop them altogether before casually subbing one kind for another, again.

Very nice. We used rice instead of coconut & skipped the tamarind paste (rare in our part of the world) but it was really good anyway. We enjoyed it best with all the parts mixed together.

so, i haven't made it either. but i have had a very similar dish at Roxanne's a raw food restaurant outside of San Francisco. the coconut really does an amazing job of standing in for the noodles.

I would have to agree...and btw, where are the noodles? All the Pad Thai I've ever had contained noodles and not cabbage!!!

Okay I admit I didn't make this, but it sounds like a major pain in the you-know-what. Just go buy it at the local thai restaurant...
