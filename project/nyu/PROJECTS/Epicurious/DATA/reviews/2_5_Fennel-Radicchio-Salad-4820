We love fennel in a variety of preparations, but this was not something we'd make again. The shallots in the dressing were overpowering, even when made again with only one-half the indicated amount. The combination of fennel and raddichio did not blend well in our opinion.

This salad was absolutely delicious. I made it tonight to accompany my spicy baked cod. Everyone loved it. The fennel adds an interesting flavor. I made an herbed parmasan vinaigrette with red vinegar and olive oil to go with it. Delicious.
