Too much baking powder! These buttery morsels had a delicate crumb, and perfect amount of sweet, enhanced by the orange. All was overpowered by the nasty soda flavor.

Forgot to say that I sprinkle turbinado surgar on top for a bit of crunch.

Really great taste and texture, plus super easy using the processor. The first time I made these, I followed the recipe exactly and thought they were too crumbly, not holding together, so I made a note to add more liquid next time. I'm glad I tried again, with a bit more liquid. They were moist and held together well. Delish out of the oven. I prefer my scones in wedges as well and just patted it into rounds and cut accordingly. Will definitely keep making!

Everyone loved this one!!! So easy to make and light and fluffy. I used chocolate chips instead of currants. I made without the zest and it was delicious.

Absolutely delicious! I made with the finely chopped dried apricots and added a little sprinkle of oats along with the sugar on top. Beautiful! I cut with a 1 3/4" round cutter and it yielded 19 scones and they are a perfect size. I will be using these for a brunch for 150 early next month. I think the ladies will LOVE them.

Good Scones - not too sweet, but rich and relatively moist due to the butter and buttermilk. Worked well in my new food processor. Next time I will add more currants than 1/2 cup.

I hate it when people rate a recipe and it turns out they changed the ingredients but . . . I'm doing it anyway. These were great! But I didn't have orange zest or currants so I substituted 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 a cup of mini chocolate chips. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. Soooo good -- light, flaky, crispy top, tender inside. Love love love.

These were delicious scones! I would even consider these cafe worthy treats! I used dried cranberries in place of the currants and the zest of three clementines because I didn't the currants or a navel orange. Also, I used 10 tbs of butter since I was short on supplies after the Thanksgiving meal. I cut them into wedges and they were a hit! I'll be making these again and again!

I used raisins instead of currants, because that's what I had on hand. To make it a bit healthier I used fat-free half and half instead of buttermilk and only 3/4 stick of sweet butter. They came out perfect! So moist and flavorful!

These are great! I made them as written with the exception of fresh blueberries and lemon zest instead of dried currants and orange zest. They're still warm, so I find them a little more cakey rather than dry, but we'll see what happens when they cool down.

Really good, even with oat flour for gluten-free friends. Prepared and refrigerated overnight, placing cold baking sheet in oven and scones came out extra buttery and yummy.

Prepared this recipe for the first time last night..and it surely will not be the last time. I have tried numerous scone recipes over the years, and I have found some good recipes before..BUT this one is the BEST I have EVER come across. My food processor bit the dust recently, so I had to go old school using a pastry cutter..the final results were well worth the effort. Wonderfully lite, excellent crumb and delightful flavor. I didn't have any oranges in the house, and it didn't seem to make a huge difference. I prefer the wedge shaped scone..however, since I don't have a single one left for my Sunday morning coffee, I will be preparing these again tomorrow..after I pick up some oranges at the market! This is a keeper, and I encourage everyone to try this recipe.

I've made this twice. Once as-is, minus the currants, and adding a scraped vanilla bean. It was awesome. The second time, I subbed light buckwheat fluor for the all purpose. It was equally awesome and surprisingly light. Great recipe! I also prefer the more traditional wedge scones, so I divide the batter into two circles, cutting each into 8 wedges (to make 16 medium scones).

Very satisfying! Used to make them for our cafe and were always popular.

I made this yesterday and just had it for breakfast... boy, this is an awesome scone or what??? So moist, refreshing and hearty. I replaced currants with prunes and used self-made buttermilk (add some acid to whole milk) and only 1 stick of butter and it still turned out GREAT. Eaten on its own or with some whipped cream and English tea, mmmmm... simply divine!

delicious and fast, light and flaky. I substituted 2/3 cup of the flour with whole wheat, slightly reduced sugar. Next time would try lemon zest and small dried blueberries instead of currants and orange zest.

I am so not a scone person, but I had buttermilk that I needed to use, so decided to give these a shot. They are so delicious that I was actually eating the dough before I got them into the oven! What a wonderful recipe - perfect texture and flavor, and they made the house smell great on a rainy Sunday. I don't have a food processor, so I winged it with my blender...not easy, but fun and what results! This is everything a scone should be. May also add a bit of lemon zest next time.

Lovely. The dough is very silky and easy to work with. The baked scones a very moist, tender and just slightly sweet.

My husband didn't particularly like these - he said they tasted too much like cornbread. But I've been dieting and needed something bread-like and good. They hit the spot for me.

Followed previous suggestions, reduced butter to one stick, used craisins instead of currants. Cut into twelve wedges, molded into cupcake pan. This one is a keeper!!

These were incredible. Made with dried cranberries because I didn't have currents and subbed half OJ half 2% milk for the buttermilk because I didn't have an orange. The dough was sticky, but I took the advice of one of the earlier cooks and patted it out in a 9" pan. Baked it for around 18 minutes, and don't foresee this batch lasting more than a day.

Yum! My dough was very sticky as noted by others, so just added a bit more flour and patted into a circle and cut into 12 wedges-saves all the trouble of re-rolling and toughing the 2nd dough. I didn't have an orange on hand, so substituted some lemon zest instead and ate them with some orange marmalade. Definitely a keeper recipe and will try the suggestions for using only one stick of butter and at least half of the flour as whole wheat.

Made this recipe adding double the zest and Just Blueberries instead of currants. The dough was wet and I ended up having to add a bit more flour. I rolled them into balls and patted them into little rounds. The end result was beautiful with wonderful flavor but it was way too flaky.Anyone have any suggestions on how to fix this problem?

Snowy Sunday morning in New England begged for warm scones. I too, used slightly less butter. Chopped dates intead of currants... Brushed the tops with buttermilk and "natural"large- granular sugar. Patted into a circle and cut wedges. Tender, will make again.

Ok, the recipe i tried is from April 2003 Bon Apetit!, but this one is almost exactly the same, so i'll do my rating here! I thought these scones were delicious! The oats give them a nice earthy taste and texture. I used craisin's instead of currants and baked at 400 degrees..since that's what my recipe said to bake them at! I'll try this recipe and compare them. Very tender scone as well!

I prefer the Scottish oat Scones recipe at this site. Very versatile as these are, too. Try adding toasted chopped pecans and craisins (dried sweetened cranberries) and then serve with orange honey and butter. So awesome~

I make these scones fairly often - the whole family loves them. I only use 1 stick of butter, and I often use 1/2 whole wheat flour (but that's me), and just as other reviewers have mentioned, I always just pat out a large circle and cut into wedges.

Doesn't get much better than this. These are good. Plus the food processor sure makes it easier to make! Made 'em for my teens after-school snack. They were a smash.

Very gucci scones! Look and taste like they came from boutique bakery. checked out the advice from others and just patted into a circle and cut into wedges. I've tried dried cherries and blueberries with equally good results. A definite keeper.

Outstanding-- very light and flaky with a nice texture. I only had 1 stick of butter, so that's what I used. Less butter didn't appear to make a difference. I agree with the chef from Vacaville--don't bother rolling these out, simply cut them into wedges.

YUM! Just like the Starbuck's oatmeal scones I used to get. Didn't bother with the food processor step as I prefer a more "toothy" oatmeal scone and they turned out perfect.

GREAT scone recipe! These were the first scones I made. They came out delicious, my whole family liked them. I substituted dried wild blueberries for currants. They were some of the best scones I've ever had. It was very easy to make and I'm definately making these again. :)

Have made this recipe several times - easy and delicious! I add a dash of cinnamin, and top with turbinado sugar.

Great scones. I forgot the buttermilk glaze and they still turned out great. I used dried cranberries and more orange zest.

These are my family's favorite. I replace the currants with dried cranberries. I form a 1" circle out of the dough and cut into wedges (very easy & less handling of dough). I dip the tops in buttermilk and then in superfine vanilla sugar before baking. Makes for a very attractive scone and yummy too!

This dough was easy to make and work with. And the resulting scones are delicious... not too sweet and looked pretty also. I will make these often.

This is a good recipe. I attempted to lighten it up using Brummel and Brown spread as a substitute for the butter, and it worked fine. Soaking the currants in hot tea added a bit of additional flavor. I did one batch with the buttermilk brushing prior to baking and one with a an egg-white wash -- the buttermilk gives a better finish for this type of scone

These scones were great. However, I changed a few things not because I was afraid they wouldn't be good, I just wanted to try a new idea, and it worked! I used a "CarbSense" pancake mix instead of the flour. It only has 7grams of carbs per 1/2 cup. I also grinded my oatmeal very fine because that is how I like it. I happened to have some fresh chopped cranberries left over from another recipe so I decided to throw it in with this one. It worked great, the orange zest with the cranberries and the currants really complimented each other. My last change was that I didn't roll these out and cut them, instead I just buttered a 9" round cake pan (2 of them) and patted the dough into it. It worked, I baked it on 400 degrees convection for 15 minutes. They were deliciouse, not to sweet. I didn't find these scones dry, just perfect. I am glad I experimented, will make these again real soon!

These scones were very good! Love the great orange flavor. I was in a bit of hurry when I made these and did't read the recipe too well....oats never got to see the food processor. Just mixed all the dry ingredients in a bowl, used a pastry cutter to cut in the butter and threw in the wet ingredients and gave it a stir. Baked them, threw them in a baggie and headed for the hills. They were great with coffee at daybreak, but wished they were just a little sweeter. (they kept very well) Got home and reread the recipe...if I had just followed the directions and added the sugar on top before I baked them, they would have been perfect. I guess I'll just have to make them again!!

I love these scones. They were easy to make, not too sweet, and a huge hit. A tip: be sure to flour the inside of your biscuit cutter frequently, and only sprinkle sugar on the tops of half the batch for those folks who are watching their sugar intake.

We liked these very much. I halved the recipe and for some reason my dough was very sticky. (Maybe I ended up with too much egg.) I just patted it with some more flour and proceeded. I sprinkled some turbinado sugar on top and baked them at 400 degrees. They are not too sweet, with a nice oat taste. Just what we had in mind.

Rating: 2
This dough was awfully wet; I added another 1/3 cup flour. I also used lemon zest and raisins because that's what I had on hand. These have a nice sweet flavor and flaky, oat-y texture, but spread a little too much while baking. But they taste good and I'd make them again.

I've made these twice already, once with the orange zest and once without. Both times they disappeared immediately. They are tender and crunchy at the same time. Definitely give them a try.
