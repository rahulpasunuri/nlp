I've had French toast before and somehow I remember it more yummy and comforting (and fattening!) than this. I took the advice of previous reviewers in adding vanilla extract & cinnamon. I sprinkled sugar on top but they just weren't anything special.

I wrote another review before but it isn't showing up ? I wouldn't use the salt. I always put a ton of cinnamon on my french toast. And, I usually put some vanilla extract in. Lastly, I have never put sugar in the egg mix. Sometimes I use some powdered sugar, but it is all preference. Great recipe.

Great recipe! I always, always add a ton of cinnamon it adds so much flavor. and of course, some powdered sugar. Leave out the salt, there is no need for it.

This recipe was/is delcious! Definitely add the nutmeg, cinnamon, and vanilla that other reviewers recommended. Also, the idea of having the bread be a little dry to start would help make for a little crispier toast. This recipe is a keeper for sure!!

The salt measurement is a typo. It should be a 1/2 teaspoon, not tablespoon. But as another reviewer noted, why add any?

I used slices of french bread, and added cinnimon like someone suggested. I had to soak the bread slices a little longer, but it was delicious.

Skip the salt, why bother? I used my homemade whole wheat bread with sunflower and fenel, gave it a nutty flavor. Excellent.

Whoops. Yes, DEFINITELY a typo with the salt amount. If only I had read these reviews FIRST! The recipe is simple and yummy... add some cinnamon (a little less than 1 TBSP) to the mixture and then put powdered sugar on top when you serve.

I think it's safe to assume the amount of salt is a mistake. More likely a half teaspoon, not TBL.

I would like to rename this recipe French Mediterranean Sea Toast. It could be used in a barn as a salt lick block for livestock. I felt fortunate I did not have to stick an IV in my arm for dehydration. Please, for the love of all humanity do not add salt to this dish.

This was so easy and so good! I skipped the salt and sugar. I added real vanilla extract and ground cinnamon to the eggs and milk and used white bread. My husband and kids had three and four helpings apiece. Yum,yum.

Ok, I only pu in 1/2 tsp of salt, and thank goodness it was only that much. Next time I'll skip the salt. I also added a dash of cinnamon. Served with warm maple syrup - It was a hit!

I only added 1/2 teaspoon salt and a dash of vanilla. I used white bread and dried it in the oven for a few minutes. It was delicous.

I took this recipe for what it was, a basic recipe for french toast. I skipped the salt but added lots of trimmings when I served it -- icing sugar, cinnamon or other spice, maple syrup, even cream cheese. My family enjoys it since I can whip it up in less than 15 minutes in the mornings, even on busy school days!

I checked Fannie Farmer and it is supposed to be 1/2 TEASPOON and not 1/2 tablespoon salt, so beware!

Very ordinary... By all means, SKIP THE SALT and add both vanilla and cinnamon. My daughter has been making better french toast than this since she was 7 years old.

This recipe is good, but bland. I have a suggestion, to spice it up, in the egg mixture, add garlic powder, onion powder, thyme, black pepper and hot pepper, if you like. as well as your salt and milk. This makes a big difference. Not everyone may like it, but it's a change!

For the love of God, do not add 1/2 tablespoon of salt. I prepared this as directed with 1/2 tbsp of salt and we had to throw it all out. It was absolutely disgusting. If you try this recipe, maybe try 1/2 teaspoon of salt. It's probably a typo. I can't see anybody eating more than a couple of bites with half a tablespoon of salt in there.

I've never made French Toast with sugar and salt added to the egg/milk mixture.. but it did make a difference.. It was great.. I even threw on top a little powder sugar and my husband thought it was a great "special" breakfast!

The plain way is OK but I prefer my french toast with sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg to taste. I sometimes use Bailey's Irish Creme or Frangelica in the egg & milk batter for special occassions to add nice flavor topped with maple syrup and place sliced strawberries marinated in balsamic vinegar and brown or raw sugar on the side.

This was a pretty bland recipe of french toast. Much more lacking than what I would expect from Bon Appetit. I recommend adding some vanilla (at a bare minimum) to brighten up the flavor.

My mother introduced French Toast to me when I was very young, about 53 yrs. ago. She used to just scramble the number of eggs she figured would do, add some milk, little salt & pepper, to taste. When they were ready to eat, all we added was some butter (marg), and salt & pepper if needed. We never added sugar or topped it with maple syrup etc. I have tried it but find I like it better the old fashioned way the best. My husband and children eat it the same way.

Good basic recipe. Try adding 1/2 tsp vanilla for an interesting and flavorfull change.

Not bad, a pretty basic recipe for french toast. I would add less salt next time, and definitely serve with cinnamon and sugar, or maple syrup. It could be a little more flavorful, I guess.

This is even better with cinnamon and nutmeg added to the eggs and topped with apples sauteed in butter with brown sugar and walnuts. Or, try adding a dash of almond extract to the eggs.
