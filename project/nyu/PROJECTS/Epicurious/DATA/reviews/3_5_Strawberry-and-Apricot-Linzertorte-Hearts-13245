These cookies are unbelievably rich, tasty, and truly wonderful. Definitely not an everyday cookies as they must have a million calories. One change I made: I substituted almond meal (I had it in the house) for some of the almonds as it was chopped more finely than my food processor could get that many almonds. I baked the cookies on parchment and I'm glad I did- they're so delicate. The 325 oven helps control browning. Has anyone considered using this as a dough for a pie? I imagine by cutting the sugar down a bit, this would be AMAZING with a chocolate mousse pie or something slightly bitter.

I personally found these biscuits too dry, but I made them for an afternoon tea and everyone else loved them! When it came to dividing up biscuits to take home, everyone wanted to take leftovers of these. So I would make them again for others, but not myself. I would also roll out the dough a bit thinner as you do get a big mouthful of dry crumby dough when you bite into these.

These cookies are beautiful and have a unique flavor. However, they can be tricky and crumble after they are baked. Care must be taken when removing from the cookie sheet onto the rack. They make excellent gifts and freeze beautifully. Have fun and be creative with shapes - definately a pleasure to look at, bake and of course eat!!

These scrumptious cookies are delicious in taste, intoxicating in aroma, and total eye candy. The recipe and can be varied infinitely. I made packages of these cookies for friends and family to celebrate Valentine's Day--each cookie in a recipient's care package was different in flavoring and shape. In some batches, I varied the almond base, substituting hazelnuts or pecans. After dividing the dough into disks, I flavored each disk differently. I had about 25-30 different fillings, some of my favorites being Elizabethan Lime Curd with Honey topped with toasted coconut; Quince & Rose Petal Preserves topped with dried rose hips and crystallized rose petals; Wilkin & Son Orange Curd over bittersweet chocolate onyx wafer, topped with cappuccino chips and sprinkled India Tree Chocolate Vermicelli, etc. Some fillings were simple, such as using only Organic Maple Cream or various chocolates. Some favorite red-pink-purple fillings were Raspberry Peach Champagne Jam from Maine (incredible color), Swedish Ligonberry, Cranberry Chutney , Sour Cherry Preserves (use Sadaj brand from Iran in Middle Eastern grocery stores--cheapest and best), Wilkin & Son Little Scarlet preserves, Davidson of Dundee Guava Butter, Arome Violette et lavande en gelée, etc. I thinly spread various flavors of honey butter on the lower cookie when a filling had a good bit of liquid, in order to avoid bleed-through. I rolled the cookies very thin to avoid too much dough and not enough filling, yielding 50-75 finished cookies per batch (depending on size of cutter).

The recipe for the dough was delicious, as the was strained jam. Together, however, the cookies were too thick and with the two layers, you'd get a couple dry mouthfuls before the jam. I thought I had messed up and rolled the dough too thick, but I ended up with two more cookies than the recipe yields. I think they'd be wonderful if you roll the dough twice as thin, and you'd get twice as many cookies.

First rate recipe. I substituted raspberry jam inplace of the strawberry and apricot. Better than a bakery cookie!
