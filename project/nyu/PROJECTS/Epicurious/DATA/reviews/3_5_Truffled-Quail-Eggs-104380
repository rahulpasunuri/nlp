I think this recipe produces a sophisticated, subtle and unique hor d'oeuvre. That said, I was hoping for more flavorful eggs (when I had them poached at a restaurant they were incredible--perhaps the difference in how they were prepared). Also, used prepared black truffles that were not particularly "truffley"...which was disappointing. And finally, I encountered similar problem with the shell and membrane sticking and being quite difficult to peel. I think next time I would steam the eggs rather than boil -- makes traditional eggs MUCH easier to peel and might make it easier with such small, fragile eggs. Ultimately, the were excellent and everyone thoroughly enjoyed them.

These were delicious and beautiful. Although I improvised a bit and used used truffle oil and light mayo for deviling them. I will make them again and again.

I breed Japanese Quail for eggs for eating and for hatching eggs so I came to view recipes here. I should be able to accomodate those of you that can not find the eggs locally. E-mail me at chicksnducklings@aol.com for information. Delicious!

Shame on all of you with your ridiculous sarcasm. I'm unable to find fresh porcini in my city, but it doesn't stop me from being interested in recipes based on this incredible mushroom- it only peaks my interest, and makes me anticipate cooking them at some time in the future. I thought this was a site for epicures? (Incidentally, I DO feel sorry for all of you who live in such horrible towns in the USA- if you can't find quail eggs, you must live in very insipid, colourless and cultureless cities). My condolences. Why don't you move to somewhere with culture?

I have been reading these recipes for quail eggs and there is alot of sarcasm about thinking it is impossible to find quail eggs. GO TO YOUR LOCAL ASIAN GROCERY STORE. We have them even in Ohio. It would be such a pitty if epicurious started omitting any unusual recipes because of this kind of comment. Do we want nothing but mac and cheese, chili and meat loaf?

Hee hee hee, A Cook From New England. BTW, as a tourist in Japan I ate quite a few cute, tasty, little hard-boiled eggs, about an inch long - anyone know what kind of eggs they might have been?
