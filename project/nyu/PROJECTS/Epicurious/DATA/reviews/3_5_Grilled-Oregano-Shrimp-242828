This was OK. Nothing special. The orzo is better! BUT still very quick and easy to put together with ingredients always in the pantry (apart from the prawns).

Super easy and very tasty. I used my mortar and pestle to crush the oregano even finer. Let the shrimp marinate for 1 hour. Love it when a recipe is simple, yet amazingly flavorful. I did make with the orzo, too. Thought the recipes worked well together, as this is a mediterranean dish.

We love this recipe and have made it for guests several times since discovering it a few weeks ago. It's amazingly easy, and the flavours work so well together. We do it in a grill basket, rather than on skewers, which makes it even easier. Yum!

amazing, tasty and so easy. Definately serve with the orzo pasta salad suggested. Its great...even made on my griddle pan for lack of a real grill. I hate apartment living....

This shrimp dish was very easy to prepare, which was great for a quick weeknight meal. I prepared the feta orzo pasta as recommended, which was a nice pairing. The flavors reminded me of those I've had in my favorite Greek restaurant.
