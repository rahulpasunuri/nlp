I used frozen corn, too, simply because of the ease. The dish came out ok, nothing spectacular; I, too, thought it would've come out creamier, and thought it tasted rather bland...I wound up adding quite a bit of salt and ground pepper to slightly liven it up!

It was not like I expected. I thought this reciepe would have been creamier.

This isn't knock your socks off cuisine, but it is tasty and easy to prepare. I used a bag of frozen corn and prepared it stove-top, and finished it with a bit of butter. Nice, simple, and even the in-laws ate it!

I really liked this corn recipe. My husband didn't care for it, but, he is kind of a fuddy dudd. I would add a little extra cream next time, but I like my food real rich. I wouldn't worry about the calories because you don't eat these things every day.

As a personal chef, I've made this twice for clients. Each time, I can't stop nibbling, and it's gotten rave reviews.

I made this with frozen corn and it turned out great. I don't think I would bother with getting corn off the cob.

I first had this dish at a friend's house for a girl's night dinner party. It was so good that I came home and printed out the recipe for myself. It is easy and delicious, and the pepper really adds a nice touch. I too would add a little additional cream.

This has become a standard side for me and I've made it many, many times. This isn't the most exciting recipe, but what makes it great is that it's simple, not time consuming and it tastes really good. I add a little more half and half as I think it gets a little dry with just 3 TB.
