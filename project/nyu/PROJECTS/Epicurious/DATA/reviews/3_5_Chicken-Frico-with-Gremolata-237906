We found the raw gremolata overwhelming & the chicken breasts boring. But the frico is amazing! So we are off to make some more impressive-looking parmesan crisps!

This was a simple and great recipe. I put the chicken over sweet pea and asparagus risotto with added a little sweet contrast from the gremolata and added chopped parsley over the frico. Everyone raved about how good it was and how beautiful the presentation was. Will definitely make again!

The fricos were SO easy and delicious. I thought the gemolata was a little salty but otherwise added a nice fresh taste.

This was such a quick and easy recipe that I was shocked that it tasted so great and gourmet! My husband said it was like we had ordered it from a restaurant. Very good. Very easy.
