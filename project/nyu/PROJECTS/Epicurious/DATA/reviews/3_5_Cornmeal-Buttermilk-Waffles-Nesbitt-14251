GREAT recipe. The trick, as other reviewers have noted, is to cook the waffles till crispy. Cornmeal crisps up like nothing else. For me, this made 14 4" square waffles. I didn't have all the ingredients so used 1 cup flour and 1 cup Indian Head stone ground white cornmeal, which is a fine grind. I only had two eggs so I added another 1/4 cup buttermilk. I used melted butter instead of oil.

Great crispy, tasty waffle! Made a few substitutions: used a buttermilk substitute (scant 2 cups of 1% milk + 2 TB vinegar), didn't have wheat germ so added an extra 1/4 cup of cornmeal, and added about 2 TB sugar for a little sweetness. The batter was surprisingly thin but they rose just fine. Used about a scant 1/2 cup per 8" round classic waffle, and this made about 10 waffles. Didn't need extra oil for the nonstick waffle iron. This came together really quickly and easily, and was very tasty, especially for being so lean. Great with syrup but even better with strawberries!

My King Arthur High Fiber blend flour was about to expire, so I used just that. With no wheat germ on hand, I put some flax seed in the spice grinder and tossed that in. Since my corn meal was medium grind, I also put that in the spice mill before adding, otherwise it may have been to gritty and probably made the corn meal taste more subtle. I would rather sift dry ingredients than whip and fold eggs whites, so this came together in a jiffy. Like other reviewers, I used a bit less oil to no ill effect. These are good and good for you. The best part is - with just two of us, there are leftovers to warm up on a weekday.

Used 1/2 cup whole wheat, 1/2 cup all purpose - sifted those before measuring, but didn't sift entire dry mix. Toasted the wheat germ, used 1/4 cup of oil. I was suspicious of not separating the eggs and beating the whites, but the waffles turned out beautifully. Loved the cornmeal crunch, and don't think they need sugar. Referencing a previous review, I added orange zest and 1/4 cup toasted pecans, finely chopped, but didn't really notice them. Used 1/2 cup batter per waffle (7" waffles), got 10 waffles. Am already thinking of lunch - melt some provolone on a waffle, add some tomato and basil, fold & eat!

Made the recipe with a few changes to the ingredients but followed the procedure exactly. Used ground flax seed instead of wheat germ and used only (which is still a lot) 4 tbsp. oil. Waffles were good. My two-year olds loved them. I have never seen them eat so many waffles. For me, the texture was great but the flavor was okay. I also didn't use syrup or butter on them, which would probably really help. I will try another recipe before making this one again.

For his birthday dinner, the 16 year old requested chicken and waffles. I was glad to find this recipe rather than my sweet breakfast waffles. The cornmeal was a brilliant addition-- especially given the southern flavor of the meal. I skipped the wheat germ but used whole wheat flour and added 1/2 tsp of ground sage and 1/4 tsp of thyme. Turned out crispy and savory. Fried chicken and a side of collards helped sop up the maple syrup. I was skeptical, but don't knock it til you try it! This was "the best birthday dinner ever."

Still worked with a couple shortcuts. Didn't sift more than once (cornmeal was too coarse and was getting jammed in my sifter) and used a buttermilk substitute (two cups 2% milk with two tablespoons lemon juice left for 10 minutes). I also didn't shake the buttermilk up. Regardless, delicious. Great tooth with the coarse cornmeal. Crispy outside with the oil. Always worried that so much baking powder and baking soda will leave the batter bitter, but it didn't. Really super.

MADE THEM GLUTEN FREE = DELICIOUS Instead of 1 cup of all-purpose flour I used a gluten-free flour mix (Pamela's), and instead of wheat-germ I used more cornmeal (although I think buckwheat would be great too). I also substituted the 2 cups of buttermilk with 2 tablespoons of organic apple cider vinegar + enough hemp milk to equal 2 cups. For oil, I used virgin coconut oil. I know I replaced much of the ingredients in an effort to make these healthier, but the turned out absolutely delicious.

I used 1 cup of soymilk and one cup of plain yogurt as a replacement for the buttermilk I don't keep on hand, with no other changes. The resultant waffles were crispy on the outside and airy inside. I don't like sweet for breakfast, so these, with their cheery crunch, were perfect.

These were very light and delicious. I used 1 cup each of white and whole wheat flour with a little corn meal and no wheat germ. Used yogurt and soy milk instead of buttermilk. I think key was to sift flour a couple of times.

I don't know if this is the same recipe as the one Gourmet commended from Cafe 222 in San Diego's Gas Lamp district, but it sure tasted the same. The waffles were such a hit my family requested them two days in a row. Good thing they're easy and quick.

This was great but I modified quite a bit to eliminate the white flour. Used 1 c whole wheat pastry flour, 1/4 c corn meal, 1/4 c oat bran, 1/4 d buckwheat flour, 1/4 c ground flax seed. Instead of buttermilk used 1cup of kefir plain plus 1 cup of low fat milk or could use soy milk. Added 2 tbl sp of butter to 4 tbl sp of olive oil. Even the kids loved them. I will cut back on the oil next time a little greasy.

I have made this receipe many times and it is always a hit. I made it yesterday and realized I had no buttermilk. The yogurt option worked very well, I don't think anyone in the family noticed the difference. I also like to use whole wheat flour in this receipe.

Quite easy... Didn't sift, used wheat bran instead of wheat germ, yogurt & water for the buttermilk - still turned out lovely and fluffy. Good basic recipe, fine with jam or syrup.

An Excellent waffle recipe! Last time I added a few chopped pecans and a little orange zest. It's a keeper!

Had just the right amount of whole wheat flour that needed to be used, so I used it to replace both the white flour and wheat germ. The corn meal gave the waffles a pleasant crunchiness. I also like the absence of any sweetener in the batter, which makes it a perfect accompaniment for both sweet (e.g. syrup) and savory (e.g. creamed dishes) additions.

Made these for breakfast yesterday and they were very good. The cornmeal crisps up a bit in the waffle maker and is delicious with the maple syrup.

I really liked these because they were different. If you've ever had buttermilk cornbread, that's what the taste of these remind me of, they're just lighter. The Yeasted Buckwheat Waffles on this website are better and more healthy (less eggs and oil), so I'd probably make them before making these again.

Best waffles I've ever made! I followed the recipe as is except I didn't have wheat germ (substituted oat bran). I particualrly liked the texture of these waffles. The triple sifting made them light and airy while the cornmeal and oatbran gave them substance. I disagree with the cooks who thought the batter needed sweetness. However, be sure to serve with real maple syrup; the imitation stuff won't complement the cornmeal as well. From now on this is my standby waffle recipe.

Yummy! I made these for breakfast and they were delicious. I omitted the wheat germ (didn't have any) and substituted 6 tablespoons of old fashioned applesauce in place of oil (watching my fat intake) and they were tasty. I agree with others in that you must make sure your waffle iron is H-O-T or you'll end up with a soggy mess!

Since the ingredients in these waffles are somewhat unusual (cornmeal, wheat germ), I was intrigued to try them. Also, the other comments sounded pretty positive. They were delicious and a little different. I added 1 cup of blueberries and let them bake until rather brown and crispy rather than the usual golden. I used my Belgian waffler so there was lots of room for melted butter and warm maple syrup!

Very good. I agree with others as to the texture of these waffles- crisp and light; however, I thought they were lacking something, a little sweetness or flavoring, perhaps. I agree with a previous reviewer that they tasted like hot cornmeal. Although good, they really needed the syrup or topping to cut the blandness. Will definitely make again, though, but will try adding a little sugar or honey to the batter.

Light and airy compared to traditional waffles, this recipe accomplishes a delicious combination of crispy crust yet moist and tender insides. Delicious.

I have been making waffles for years, and this is by far the best batch I have ever made. I left out the wheat germ (too much healthiness), and here was the key bit: set the waffle iron as hot as she goes, and make sure that the waffles are cooked as brown as you dare. Crispy, exztremely light, and not too greasy. As good as the waffles I used to get in Germany at Christmas markets!

I rarely give out 4 forks so take my 3 as an excellent. Had no problem with lack of crispiness and I likes my waffles crispy! Added blueberries to the batter and omitted the wheat germ (didn't have any on hand) and they came out just great. Could probably get a similar result my mixing cornmeal with bisquick if you want a shortcut. Also these froze very well. Reheat in 325-350 oven for 5-10 min and they'll be extra crispy-tasty!

I made ths recipe this morning for the first of what will be many times. With the waffle iron at the table, we ate the waffles just as they came off the iron, with blueberry sauce...yum!

I've made these waffles several times already and everyone loves them. We love the crunch they have and the wonderful flavor. They definately need to be eaten right out of the wafflemaker or they get soggy, but they are the best waffles I've ever had.

It was just hot cornmeal. The cornmeal took over the flavor and texture. Not crisp or chewy. Limp. Fruit topping helped alot.

Toasted the wheat germ and served with cherry compote and bourbon pecans ~ my guests were blown away! Very tasty and easy to make. The texture of these waffles was nutty and wholesome ~ will be hard to use a plain waffle recipe again... They were equally splendid the next day after warming them in the oven... mmmmmm!

Extremely good waffle recipe!

This recipe was a big hit. The waffles crisped up nicely and were still light and tasty. Even a non-waffle person in the family asked for seconds. We may try this again without the wheat germ, although it did add substance and flavor to the batter. I agree with the previous rater about the benefit of using oil rather than melted butter. This is a keeper.

Out of this world - great flavor and wonderful texture. Crispy outside and tender inside. Two things make this waffle recipe easier than most: (1)it isn't necessary to separate the eggs (2) use oil rather than melted butter. I doubled the recipe for brunch - perfect.
