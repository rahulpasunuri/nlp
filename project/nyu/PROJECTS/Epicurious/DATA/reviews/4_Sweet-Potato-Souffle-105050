I did this almost exactly as the recipe was written and everyone loved it. I used raw sugar instead of regular and boiled the sweet potatoes in coconut milk for extra flavor. I didn't bother with the marsh mellow topping for the original serving, but used them for leftovers served to a late arriving cousin and it was great either way. I am already making them again for a Christmas party and they may find their way into my Easter and Valentines menu as well. They really were "that" good. Way to go Selma Wilkes! I am putting your cookbook into my Amazon wish list.

I make this every year for traditions sake and to get some southern comfort in our PacNW Fall, but this year I tweaked it. I always bake both sweet potatoes and jewel yams the night before and let them rest vs. boiling just sweet potatoes. I also used 3/4 c. of brown sugar vs. 1.5c of sugar, add 2 tsp of finely ground crystallized ginger, omitted the coconut and added the whipped egg white! Yummy and we feel like we are home for a day!

This is beyond awesome, with some changes. I substituted lemon zest for 1/3 navel orange zest, with juice from it of about 3Ts. Also, living in New England mandates that dried cranberries substitute for raisins. Lastly, I included 1 extra egg white and whipped it well. I baked this in 2 different souffle dishes for extra time (totalling ~40 minutes) before the marshmallows. The result was nothing short of spectacular--light, airy, and full of excellent holiday flavor. (P.S. I omitted the coconut and made sure the pecans were lightly toasted before chopping.) Follow this and you just can't go wrong.

I substituted pumpkin for the sweet potato, since they are pretty interchangeable. This recipe seems to be a twist on a custard-type rather than a souffle because the eggs are mixed in rather than whipped separately and folded in. I thought the addition of lemon was a bit weird. And the cooking time was twice - 1 hour - instead of 30 minutes (which could have been because of my following a reviewer's note substituting maple syrup for some of the sugar).

This was delicious, but I did make a couple of changes. I'm not a fan of too-sweet sweet potatoes, so I reduced the sugar to only 1/2 cup and left off the marshmallows. It was still quite sweet enough.

Substituted 1/2 cup brown sugar for all the white, but otherwise made as written. HUGE hit at Christmas dinner with everyone.

This "souffle" has become a holiday tradition in my family. The tartness of the lemon offsets the sweetness of the potatoes and marshmallows. The raisins are a plump treat that even the kids love.

I have not tried this recipe but it is very close to my own. The main differences are that I use 1/2 cup of brown sugar plus about 1/2 cup of maple syrup, no raisins (most people don't care for cooked raisins), orange juice concentrate instead of lemon, 1/2 cup of heavy cream instead of evaporated milk, 1/2 tsp of ground ginger, 1/2 tsp dried whole thyme, and no coconut or marshmellows. I've also used sliced almonds instead of pecans which worked well.

I made this last Thanksgiving and am making it again this year. we had some students from Mainland China at our Thanksgiving last year, and though the texture (especially the coconut) was strange to them, they enjoyed this very American dish! I think it helped that it was sweeter than the pumpkin pie!

To begin, I made this recipe with changes (noted below - don't say I didn't warn you) for what I felt to be a more elegant, crowd-pleasing entree for a pot-luck dinner party. It was delicious & everyone loved it! CHANGES: 1 cup sugar, no raisins, no nuts, no marshmallows + 1/2 tsp ground ginger.

This could be a dessert! Very tasty, I got rave reviews at thanksgiving.

Wonderful. This one is replacing my old recipie. I took other readers' suggestions and baked the potatoes & used 3/4 cup of brown sugar. We don't care that much for coconut nor raisins so left them out. This was absolutely wonderful, light, fluffy, sweet and yummy!

This was to die for - I loved it! I've had this at Mrs. Wilkes in Savannah and I remember I loved it then. This time, I had to omit the nuts and raisins (allergies and my husband hates raisins) but it was still divine! Will make this every T-giving!

Very tasty and rich. A great recipe.

I've lost count of how many times I've served the sweet potato and carrot puree from "The Silver Palate Cookbook" to rave reviews. This epicurious recipe is a welcome addition and much less rich and filling. One note however: the lemons we now have in California are probably twice the size of the lemons used when this recipe was formulated in the South so I advise being judicious about the amount of lemon rind. Although my guests loved this dish, it was uncomfortably too close to Lemon Pledge for my tastes.

Had I seen the previous remark about using less sugar, I would've... loved this recipe regardless.

This recipie was lovely and easy, great side dish to Thanksgiving dinner. I used squash instead of sweet potatoes, and omitted the sugar, the squash was sweet enough. Also, I beat the white seperately and folded it in. It gave it some extra fulff. Nice recipie, I'll do it again, with sweet potatoes next time :)

Amazing dish with a few adjustments. Took everyone's advice and cut the sugar way down to 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also cut the butter in half (seemed like a lot and for Thanksgiving any opportunity to cut the fat is good) The lemon and rind is the key. I didn't use any pecans because of a nut allergy. Will try it next time. The coconut gave it a little texture which was great. It didn't seem to give very much coconut flavour though, so don't be scared off. The fact that this is not a "souffle" as mentioned by other reviewers is irrelevant. The recipe is simple and delicious and I made it the day before. Just popped it in the oven Thanksgiving day...fantastic.

This is a hit! I've made it twice now. An adjustment on the 2nd try was purely functional- I was low on granulated sugar so I substituted with brown sugar and it was better than the first time. This is going on my Thanksgiving menu.

I rate this four forks only after having made the following changes: I cut the sugar by half, omitted the raisins (just don't fancy them when they're cooked) and omitted the marshmallows. Great result, definitely sweet enough without being overpoweringly sweet, and a lovely presentation and texture.

This recipe is really good. I am from the South and love things that are sweet but this would have been too sweet for me with 1 1/2 cups of sugar. I only added 3/4 cup sugar and it was plenty sweet. Also, baked the sweet potatoes rather than boiling them. Suggest that you taste the potatoes before you add all of the sugar. Everyone loved this. Its so easy. I would highly recommend it.

Delicious and easy to prepare. A little too sweet.

I, too, am from New York, though I don't consider myself a "smart aleck", just a smart cook. Yes, this dish is a little too sweet for a yankee, so I simply cut down on the sugar, and kept it a little plainer than Mrs. Wilkes did. Like most recipes that people share, copy, etc., everyone tweaks them for their own individual needs. Our household just doesn't care for sweet potatoes as sweet as these would originially have been with all the added sweetness. Enjoy your souffle however you adjust it to your liking.

I used yams instead of sweet potatoes, 1/2 cup of dark molasses brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar (instead of 1.5 cups of sugar - southerners are wonderfully too sweet), blonde raisins and clarified butter and it was fantastic. There is nothing worse, however, than a smart aleck from Westchester, NY - leave that ingredient OUT! Even here in the Bay Area we know that this dish is colloquially known as a souffle and not by a strict definition of the word! A great dish with a few minor changes that I think Mrs. Wilkes would have approved! Enjoy, enjoy!

A little to rich for me. But.. everybody at my Thanksgiving meal just raved about them, including people who normally don't care for sweet potatoes. (no leftovers & I made a double batch!!) One suggestion... skip the raisins & add a bag of cranberries (if you double the recipe), they add a nice tart Thanksgiving/Seasonal touch to them. Enjoy

NO---this is not a traditional souffle, but it is what it has always been called Down South. I'm quite sure the experienced and knowledgable Mrs. Wilkes knows a real souffle---but she was (she died last month)a Southerner, and, well, frankly, that makes everything all right. Delicious, delicious, delicious!

Sweet and rich, a real Southern classic.

Someone should tell Mrs. Wilkes that 2 eggs in the recipe doesn't make this a souffle. I got 1/2 way through (also used 1/2 the sugar) before realizing there was no beating the egg whites and folding them in, but decided to make it anyway. Still, it is a casserole so if you're looking for a souffle you're out of luck.

Had this the first time at Mrs. Wilkes' Boarding House in Savannah, which is a place beyond compare for Southern comfort food. This was my favorite dish they served, so I made it yesterday for Thanksgiving. It's on the sweet side but not overly sweet. Lemon gives it a subtle, fresh flavor, and the raisins are nice as well. I toasted the pecans before adding them. Yummy!

This was a good holiday sweet potato dish. My husband loved it, I thought it was better than average but didn't knock my socks off. I left out the raisins because there is plenty of sweetness in the dish given the other ingredients. The lemon rind was a nice touch. The potatoes are a bit heavy, but sweet potatoes tend to be so. I would suggest adding a bit more pecans.
