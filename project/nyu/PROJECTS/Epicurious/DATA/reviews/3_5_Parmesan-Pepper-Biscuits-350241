I thought these were tasty & not at all hard to make, but I'd definitely categorize them more as a cracker. I would definitely like to try these with a nice spread or thick dip.

These are nice, easy to make, needed more liquid to bind them, though, so I added about a tbsp of milk and then they came together well. These are definitely more of a "wafer" than a biscuit or a cracker though, which is what the recipe calls them.

These are very quick and easy to make and taste fantastic. They also make a nice gift with a bottle of red wine.

These are fantastic. Very easy to make and very tasty. Went very well with pan-fried ham steaks, and sauteed kale/bacon/onion.
