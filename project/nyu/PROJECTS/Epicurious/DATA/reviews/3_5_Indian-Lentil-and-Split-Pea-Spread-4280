I used red lentils and yellow split peas and found the spread delicious. The recipe does make a generous quantity. To what was left over, probably totaling about two cups, I added most of a 14-1/2 oz. can of vegetable broth, heated the mixture, and created a delicious soup.

This is an excellent recipe, flavourful and easy to make. Followed other reviewer suggestions using red lentils and yellow split peas and of course split peas take longer to cook. Recipe made exactly 4 cups..but drained thoroughly so there was no excess liquid. Extra 3 tablespoons of oil was not required. Great recipe for potluck and flavour improves overnight. Will definitely make again.

4 forks with variations: used channa dal (yellow split peas) and masoor dal (red lentils). Cooked the channa dal first for 30 minutes, then added the masoor. Cooked the onions till brown at the edges, then added the garlic and cooked till both were browned, then added the spices. Indian cooks never cook onions just till translucent--the caramelized smoky flavors are essential to the flavor. Didn't use the extra 3 tablespoons of oil, but if you wanted it, would recommend melted ghee. Great with pita chips, also lovely as a spread on naan with tandoori chicken and raita.

SO good. Followed some earlier suggestions and used red lentils, cooking the split peas a half hour longer. Upped all the spices, esp. the tumeric which gives it a nice golden color. Used it for a week, dipping onto pieces of store-bought naan.

We created this spread in a mass quantity for a work banquet and it was such a huge hit! The best part is that it can be made ahead of time. I will say that it isn't "pretty" in the same way that hummus is, but people were impressed with the new flavor and "local" ingredients (we're from an area that grows a lot of peas and lentils).

Has anyone tried freezing this? It seems like it would be a good sandwich spread, but if it makes the eight cups some reviewers are suggesting, I can't imagine that it would stay good long enough to eat it all.

My first review - I use Epi all the time and typically agree with 4 fork recipes. I made 1/2 recipe (as printed) for a party this one was just BLAH and still had TONS of leftovers. Disappointing.

This spread is delicious! I used red lentils instead of the split peas and increased the cumin and turmeric to 1 tbsp each based on previous reviews. I think I'll halve the recipe next time though. As written, it makes WAY more than four cups--more like eight.

This is a fantastic spread, and endless in variations. I've been making this since it came out in 1997. If anyone considers this bland, I can just assume the use of spices is not sufficient. Agree with former reviewers, the peas take longer to cook than stated.

My husband and I actually ate this at the restaurant in Vail (they serve it with their bread before the meal), loved it and requested the recipe. The printed out recipe they gave us was much different than this one, however: more peas, cilantro, and olive oil-a lot more- so I am confused. Maybe I'll try it again with this version; it seems more manageable than the one I used!

My friends and I love Indian food, but this dish was very very bland. I added more spices and even more salt, which I am hesitant to do, and it was still fairly tasteless. This recipe is not worth the effort.

I agree with a previous reviewer. The split peas need more cooking than the lentils. I used yellow split peas and cooked them for 45 minutes, then added red lentils and simmered for an additional 30 minutes. I received many requests for this recipe, which yield a generous amount, improves with age, and is an ideal make-ahead party dish.

This is a fine dish but the recipe is not well written. Split peas are much slower to become tender than lentils. Cook the peas at leat 1 1/2 hours, then add the lentils for 35 minutes. Don't confuse the chili powder with the stuff that goes into chili con carne. Instead use Cayenne pepper. "Liberally" adding salt and pepper is bad for the blood pressure. Instead, add salt "to taste" and I saw no need for pepper. This is a good dish for a party dip or quick snack. It becomes even better with age.
