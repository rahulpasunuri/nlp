If you like halva, you'll love these!!!! These cookies are extremely easy to make. I had to speed the process and mixed the seeds in the batter, before adding the flour mixture. They have and absolutely dreamy texture: very buttery and melt-in-your-mouth, with the ever so light crunch from the seeds. Other than adding the seeds in the batter and skipping the gold dust, I followed the recipe exactly. Make sure not to burn them. The bottom browns very easily. Take them out as soon as you see the tops crack. For me it was 14 minutes; 13 would have been even better. Some people commented that there's a bitter tahini taste. PErhaps it depends on the quality of the sauce you use. i used joyva roasted tahini sauce, from whole foods. It gives the cookies splendid halva taste; no bitterness. will make them again for sure. be warned though, they are addictive!!!

Really good. I used black sesame seed paste from the Asian supermarket instead of tahini, and rolled one batch in black sesame seeds and the other in yellow ones. Note: at first, I tried cutting the butter in half and the sugar by one-third (which I often do with recipes) but after chilling, the dough wouldn't hold together. Ended up adjusting back to the recipe as written. The cookies were excellent, and not overly sugary, but next time I will still try to reduce the butter a bit.

These are perhaps my favorite cookies ever! Have made these at least a dozen times and they always turn out fabulous! Roll them in a sugar/sesame seed mixture -- adds a bit of sweetness and a bit of sparkle without the gilding powder.

I really liked these. Like others have said, they're not too sweet nor too savory. They feel very classy and foodie-y. I rolled the seeds in powder and I think it baked off in the oven. Now I'm not sure what to do with the rest of my powder. Next time I might mix seeds with gold dusting sugars for more color.

OMG - these are fantastic, addictable, pretty, and so easy! There's not a letter to be changed about the recipe (ok, I skipped the gilding, but think that doesn't really count as a change), it is perfect. What a treat.

This recipe is fool proof and really delilcious. It's sets itself apart from the usual cookie. Great texture, light and just sweet enough. I've made it many times now and have become known for them!

My guests raved. Not too sweet, and yet not savory. USE toasted tahini and not raw tahini for a greater depth of flavor. Also, hulled sesame seeds are more refined, but both get rave reviews. Make sure to toast them before rolling the dough in them no matter what type of seeds used. Lastly, brushing the tops of the cookies with gold powder rather than mixing it with the seeds makes a more pronounced sparkle. (Somehow I think the user rating is incorrect, I can't believe with the fantastic reviews written here only 2/3 would make them again.) Enjoy.

These cookies were delicious and very unique. They are buttery (because they have butter obviously) and the vanilla and the slight bitterness of sesame go well together. In the directions it doesn't say to shape them after rolling them into balls. I guessed that they weren't the kind that melted and that I had to shape them, and I was right. But I had a moment of uncertainty. I didn't bother with the silver. I only need a few tablespoons of sesame seeds. I only put them on top because I thought it was more aethestic.

Surprisingly easy even with the dough chilling step, and the other reviewers comments about halvah were spot on. Not too sweet, either, which makes it a nice adult dessert.

These are amazing. I added cacao nibs for a subtle chocolate flavor, but I bet they would be great with mini chocolate chips.

I made these cookies last year & had no problems making them exactly as directed. They were very pretty & very popular. I loved the flavor, maybe I should try halvah!

Wonderful recipe. The 1st time, they were a bit crumbly. The second time, I added 1 egg white. Didn't add add'l flour. After their stay in the fridge for an hour or so, they rolled better, didn't stick to my hands but the sesame seeds stuck perfectly, and were just as delicious.

East to make, different tasting-then again I like sesame. Made them for the company Holiday Baskets & got a request for the recipie immediately from one of our customers.

This is a lovely cookie, and easy to prepare. If you or your cookie-eating public like halavah, you will LOVE this recipe, because it produces a tender butter cookie that tastes exactly like halavah. Actually, halavah is sometimes chocolate covered, and chocolate-dipped, instead of sesame-coated or gilded might just send these cookies over the edge from delicious to obscene. But I digress...Anyway this is a different flavor, and not for everyone. But it is quite original and very tasty, and I encourage everyone to try it!

This was just so-so. It's certainly a different cookie and the flavor was nice if you are a fan of sesame but people who weren't found them to be bitter and dry. The gilding was hardly noticeable and not worth it.

I absolutely love these (but then, I would take a chunk of halvah over a chunk of chocolate). I found the dough very easy to handle, possibly because I took the precaution of emptying the entire bottle of tahini into the food processor and thoroughly blending it that way instead of merely trying to stir it. I did not bother to try to gild the cookies, and I made them smaller than called for (about 4 dozen), which meant I needed about half a cup of sesame seed. One thing-- my oven is pretty accurate, but it took me longer than the 12-15 minutes the recipe lists: even with the smaller size, it took 16 minutes for one sheet and 20 for the other.

I had no problem with the dough coming together. It was a very easy to dough to work. I did have a problem with the bitter flavor from the tahini. I purchased a new jar of tahini specifically for this recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems at all. I love the peanut idea though. My husband loved it but it tasted too much like Halwa to me (which I don't love).

What a major pain in the ass of a cookie. I followed the recipe exactly and could not for the life of me get the dough to hold together enough to make little balls. I ended up adding more butter, and it worked, but then the sesame wouldn't stick to the batter. Had to dip the balls in water to get the sesame to stick. They ended up very pretty, but the tahini made the cookies taste a little bitter. Yuck. Next time, for the same effect, I'll use a peanut butter cookie recipe with the sesame.
