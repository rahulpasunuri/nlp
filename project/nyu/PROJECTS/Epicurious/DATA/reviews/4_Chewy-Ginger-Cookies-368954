The first time I made this recipe, I substituted a couple of ingredients. And I rated it excellent. This time I followed the recipe almost exactly and they were even better! Honestly. I don't know why anyone else would criticize them. I used the extra ginger I chopped and grated to hand mix into some ice cream and I made ice cream cookies - delicious. Great recipe! Let's see. The only things I didn't do: pepper and nutmeg were not freshly groung. Salt was just table salt. And I had put the dough in the refrigerator before baking in the hope that it would be easier to handle and because my kids were up from their nap before I could bake them.

Really good recipe! They turned out even better than I thought. I followed the recipe and instructions exactly, except I substituted margarine for the shortening and I didn't have any crystalized ginger so I added maybe an extra tsp of fresh ground ginger. I will make these again!

These were decent cookies. They did not turn out as the picture did though. Definitely chewy, but I felt like the ginger was a little too strong.

These didn't turn out looking the way they did in the photograph, but I rated them a four based on the flavor and the texture. I'm not sure why other reviewers complained about the difficulty in rolling them out. I read the recipe several times and nowhere did it say anything about rolling them out. Perhaps rolling them out was an attempt to achieve something closer to the photograph. But they're drop cookies. Given the soft, sticky dough, I can imagine it would be difficult to roll out. They did spread out way more than I expected. That may be because I made them too big in the first place. If I make them again (and I'm sure I will) I try making smaller balls of dough. That said, I loved the texture. They were indeed chewy, and the raw sugar added a pleasing crunchiness upon biting in to a cookie. Afterwards, the chewiness seemed like a nice change from the crunchiness of ginger snaps. I know some reviewers felt the cookies lacked enough ginger flavor. I can only say that the batch I made had plenty of ginger flavor. I did add a little extra grated ginger root, but not much. Less than 1/8 teaspoon. I wasn't sure about the black pepper, but I think it augmented the heat of the ginger nicely. These cookies passed the ultimate test in my house: the kid test. Both, ages 5 and 10, gave them the "thumbs up."

I rated it 3, because I thought they were good. I had no issue rolling them and they came out close to the picture. No need to refrigerate. I did find, that in my convection oven that the sweet spot between burnt and raw was just too tight. So one batch under baked the next batch burnt. I do find them tast.

FANTASTIC! I sell these at the restaurant I work at, and everyone loves them. I am not a big fan of molasses, so I substitute the same amount od dark corn syrup. Err on the side of underbaking, than overbaking...

These are NOT chewy ginger cookies, they are hard ginger snaps. They spread like crazy and the dough is near impossible to work with. Terrible! After the first disaster batch, I added a LOT more flour - not sure how much, but probably at least another half cup - and that improved the texture considerably, but I still was not very excited about the flavor.

Rating: 4
I thought these were exceptionally good and will definitely make again. They do spread so it took extra batches in the oven since I put fewer on each sheet, but well worth it. I loved both the flavor and texture.

Exquisite. I've tried a few ginger cookie recipes on this site and I like this one the best. The only ingredient I changed was using dark molasses instead of blackstrap. I highly recommend chilling the dough for at least one hour. I chilled the dough and had no trouble at all rolling them. Also, mine did not spread while baking. (I placed them on a center rack in the oven) They were about .5" high after baking. Hot out of the oven they are absolutely amazing. Both soft and chewy... I was proud to serve them!

These cookies are wonderful. I put them in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes and cooked them for about 13 or 14 minutes. They are a little bit of a trouble to make but I will bake them agian.

I've made these cookies twice now. I found that refrigerating the dough ovenight helps with the stickiness and spreading issues others have noted. I rolled the in raw sugar. Mine never came out as dark as the photo or as sparkly but they were pretty good. I like the intense ginger taste.

Rating: 0
I may have done something wrong, so I'm not going to rate this. There was NO way, even after extensive chilling, that I could roll out this dough. Too soft and too sticky. I ended trying them as drop cookies. They spread all over the place. I had to cook them at least 5 minutes longer than the recipe called for, and they were just raw in the center. I made a dozen different cookies from this site this year and all turned out beautifully except these. Per the reviews, I'll try them again, because they sound like the ginger cookie I've been hungry for.

Rating: 2
These should really be called chewy molasses cookies. The molasses flavour is much more powerful than the ginger. they are good with apple butter spread on them though. However I don't think I will be making these again.

Rating: 4
Hands down, best ginger cookie i've had. separate them more than the 1 1/2 inches...mine ran into each other. baked on silpat mats...worked wonderfully. yielded more than the stated 4 dozen for me. my family and friends loved them.

Rating: 4
I used all butter and wore latex gloves to roll them since the dough was so sticky (I wear them when I make truffles too. Keeps my hands clean). I rolled them in turbinado sugar and was surprised at how much they spread. They were very crispy but got chewy by the second day and seem to get better and better. I made a second batch and added 1/4 cup more flour but I didn't like the taste or texture as much as the original. I will make them again since I LOVE the intense ginger flavor.

These cookies are fabulous, assuming you like ginger. Which I do. Rolling the sticky dough in sugar sounded like it might have been a clumsy process, but it was not; the sugar allowed the dough to adhere easily in a ball. The only thing I'd say is that I needed to increase baking time by about a minute; I always use an oven thermometer, so I know my temperature was accurate. Even people who don't care for ginger cookies raved about these, and they'll will go in to regular rotation.

The first time I made these, I got more spread than I wanted so the next time I didn't cream the sugar and fat to "fluffy" but just to "light." I also baked them for an additional 2 minutes and got a nice ginger snap that reminded me of my grandmother's. This will become a tradition in my family. Everyone loved them and they looked exactly as photographed in the magazine when using raw sugar.

I used turbinado (Sugar in the Raw) sugar for dusting, and the cookies came out looking just like the picture, and slightly chewy in the middle. We loved the gingery flavor and the texture, but we found them way too sweet, possibly because the crystallized ginger was very sugary, or too much sugar on the outside. We usually reduce the sugar in recipes by between a quarter and a third, but it didn't make sense with this one. Next time I'll put much less sugar on the outside, and try another brand of crystallized ginger, and maybe soak it in hot water to remove some of the sugariness.

I made these cookies for the first time this Christmas and they are delicious - buttery, gingery and flavorful. I used 100% butter rather than shortening, refrigerated the dough and baked for 8 - 10 rather than 10 - 12 minutes. They do err on the cakey side which is usually not my preference, but the flavors are still decadent.

Rating: 4
I made these with and AP gluten free flour and 1/2 tsp xantham gum. They're delicious! We chilled the dough which made rolling the balls very easy. I had to extend the baking time by about 2 minutes.

Rating: 2
The flavors of this cookie are very good. It is a hugs sticky mess to make, and my cookies turned out very flat, not small, not mounded, and not crackly, which was what I was hoping. They will be good to eat, but will probably not make it to the Christmas cookie plate for display. I will try it again with Blackstrap molasses rather than the only kind I could find at my supermarket. Perhaps the highly processed molasses will help keep the shape.

Rating: 3
These are pretty good, but not the best ginger cookies I've ever had. Mine did not turn out chewy, but rather slightly crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle - nice, but I was hoping for chewy. The flavor is very good. All in all, pretty good cookie, not my favorite though.

Rating: 4
These are fabulous. I didn't bake up all of the dough immediately and definitely found the refrigerated dough easier to work with, though the results from both the unchilled and chilled dough were great. Used raw sugar for rolling. Looked just like the photo.

What a disappointment. I was lured in by the beautiful sparkly picture, thinking this is a notch-above ginger cookie! But now I think the one pictured in the magazine must have had some "work done." I followed the recipe religiously and all I got was a flat, boring ginger cookie. A LOT of work for little return. I assume the magazine glamor shot was done with the sanding sugar--I used raw sugar. The recipe said to space 1.5 inches apart---I erred on a bigger gap and yet almost ALL of my cookies spread into each other. On the plus side---the recipe said it made 48 cookies and I definitely got 48 cookies out of this; but never was I so happy to be done with the dough-a sticky mess. If, and that's a big IF, I ever make these again, I will chill the dough first, leave more space between than recommended and get the sanding sugar. If I could give the recipe 0 forks and have it count in the rating, I would do so.

Of all the Christmas cookies that I made, these are the ones that people are raving about! The dough was very soft, but it was easy enough to use a spoon to push it around in the bowl of raw sugar. I followed the recipe exactly, taking them out at 10 minutes when they were nice and crinkled. At first, I was afraid that they were underbaked, but once they fully cooled, the texture was perfect....they are beautiful, slightly crisp and chewy - I will make these again for sure! I might add a dash of cayenne next time to add even a bit more zing.

I need to make some more! The first/last batch disappeared. I substituted half of the flour with some high fiber blend flour from King Arthur Flour and the texture came out perfect - chewy and cracked. I was surprised how they looked store bought. Not being an avid baker, I found the timing a bit off or maybe my oven, but I was very pleased no matter how light or dark they were. The flavors were great. If you leave them out, they will crisp up like a ginger snap cookie - your choice.

Not sure why others had problems with the dough/flavors. I thought it was very easy to work with and tasted delicious. I used turabino sugar and you got the sparkly sugar look like the photo.

I agree with ninniesandtwits. Made this cookie twice now and did not like the dough and the final product. The coookie seems to spread a great deal and the sugar that it's rolled in gets baked into the cookie. It doesn't stay on top and sparkle, like the photo. I was looking for the perfect chewy ginger molasses cookie and for me, this one wasn't it. Thanks for the referral to the other ginger spice cookie recipe. I'm going to try it.

Rating: 2
I found the dough annoying to work with, the nutmeg overpowering, and the final product somewhat unattractive. I will go back to my favorite ginger cookie recipe. I always use blackstrap molasses and fresh ginger and they turn out delicious and perfectly cracked every time. http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Ginger-Spice-Cookies-103156

Great base cookie recipe. I altered the recipe into a gluten free version and made a couple other changes, but loved the addition of crystalized ginger. Great hit at my holiday party!

Great ginger cookie- wonderful ginger flavor. Loved the salty contrast w/ the sugar.

Wonderful cookie - I already ate 2 and want another... Fantastic with tea or coffee. In my convection oven, I baked about 11 minutes. I also let them sit on the cookie sheet for about a minute before moving them to cookie sheets. They set up a bit and didn't squish as easily.

These ARE by far the best Ginger Cookies I have ever made! I cannot pin-point what specifically is coming through because all the flavors are perfect! I will make these again and again!!

These are great! Super gingery, very chewy - just right, I'm going to make another batch tomorrow for all my coworkers! FYI- I didn't have shortening, but I used canola oil and they still turned out beautifully!

These came out great! They taste like a gingersnap. Mine were not super chewy. I added some pearlized gold sanding sugar into the regular mix for a festive holiday touch.

OMG this was the best ginger cookie I have ever had. Some reviewers commented their cookies came out cakey, not chewy. Mine were chewy and flatter than the pictured cookie. But my four year old son threw in some extra baking soda when I had my back turned! I tried to scoop out as much as I could, but I know extra got in -- that could be the secret -- an extra pinch of baking soda!

I have been looking for a flavor-blast ginger cookie recipe and this is the one. The combination of fresh and crystallized ginger is spicy in a good way. It took about 3 inches of fresh ginger grated on the microplane to equal 2 tsps. I rolled them in raw Maui turbinado sugar which gave them a sparkly finish.

I am a huge ginger lover, and these were incredible!!! I ran out of the fancy sugar after baking half the dough, so mixed in some good quality chocolate chunks for the remaining dough (with no sugar). They were equally yummy!

These are absolutely delicious! The crystallized ginger, combined with the fresh ginger make these cookies rich in flavor. My daughter could not stop eating them! A definite keeper.

This is a fine cookie, but for my liking, it isn't the best ginger cookie I've ever made. The texture was not chewy, it was actually cakey - like gingerbread. (Followed the recipe as written.) What I did like was that it is less sweet, very gingery and the crunch of the raw sugar.

These are fantastic cookies. If you like your gingersnaps soft with alot of flavor this is the recipe for you. This is a keeper.
