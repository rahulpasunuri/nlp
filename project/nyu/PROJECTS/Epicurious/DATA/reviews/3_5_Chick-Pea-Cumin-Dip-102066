How can this be considered hummus when it's missing the key ingredient...tahini?

Rating: 2
the real key to great hummus, aside from lots of cumin and garlic and lemon juice, is red aleppo pepper. i am so thankful to the armenian woman who taught me this.

This dip is somewhat BLAH as written, but I added 2 large cloves of garlic and a bit more parsley. I also added salt and pepper which really helped the taste. With the additions this is a great dip.

I agree with "a cook from SF" and "medeiros from Sacramento"... all of the people in my cooking club agreed there was something missing from this recipe...that would be the taste. It is just chick-peas and the overwhelming taste of cumin. Salt really should be added because it is quite bland without any other flavoring. I agree that the tofu does lighten things up a bit and that's nice. Other than that I would make this hummus again but with a little pepper and garlic just to kick up the flavor. It wasn't even good with the pita toasts and that is pretty bad.

This is one of my favorite versions. The tofu lightens the texture but the flavor is just the chick peas and seasoning. You might like to add salt.

This was awful. It was very bland, so I added a tablespoon of asian chili-garlic paste which made it passable. I plan to stick to hummus with garlic next time.

This is an outstanding recipe! I added ground cumin (as well as the toasted seeds), roasted garlic, cayenne pepper, and more lemon juice. The tofu blended into the beans for a smooth texture. No one can tell that tofu is used; I usually dislike tofu but loved it in this recipe.

I love hummus, but haven't ever been able to make anything at home that remotely comes close to the ones I buy at the store. This recipe does. The texture is excellent - not quite as smooth as some commercial hummuses, but now the problem is more my food processor than the recipe. Skipped the olive oil and parsley and added 3 garlic cloves instead. Also, as I used dried chickpeas instead of canned, I had to add salt to taste - prob around 1.5 tsp. Healthier and just as tasty as the best store-bought stuff - this is going to be my default recipe from now on.

No discernable difference from regular hummus, and it's delicious. Bonus that it's lower in fat/calories.

This recipe is better than any hummus recipe I have found on epicurious. I absolutely love it. I first made it just as recommended, and it was good. However, with the addition of extra lemon juice, garlic, dried red pepper, cayenne, and garam masala it was GREAT.

I added 4 cloves of roasted garlic and a tablespoon of sesame oil and it was absolutely wonderful. My guests raved about it, and no one had any idea that it was made with tofu!

This is very good! I followed others suggestions and also added more lemon (it definately needed it I thought), plus sesame oil, garlic, coriander. Also, I did not have cumin seeds, so I just heated ground cumin seeds and it worked fine! I couldn't find my cayenne, but I think that would be a good addition as well. And couldn't be easier to make.

This dip is fantastic! I omitted the olive oil and added 1 tbsp sesame oil instead...added 2 cloves garlic...doubled the lemon juice...added ground cayenne pepper and ground coriander. Plenty of salt (i'm addicted) and it was perfect.

Since I am always looking for recipes that I can use tofu, this recipe fits the bill. Your friends won't even suspect unless you tell them. An updated and healthier version of hummus. I will definitely keep this recipe as a vegetarian alternative to high fat dips. P.S.- I added some minced garlic. Thanks...

I can't believe I made anything using TOFU! I must really trust the reviewers. With garlic added this is so yummy.

A really good dip! Tastes just like hummus and no one can tell that it has tofu. You really don't miss the tahini. However, I did add a teaspoon or two of sesame oil and a little more cumin, and I didn't bother with the parsley oil.

Highly repeateable, given teh following modifications: I reduced the amount of oil by a half teaspoon, added more lemon juice, roasted red pepper, crushed garlic, cilantro, a diced serrano pepper, and salt and pepper to taste. It turned out FABULOUS!! Husband and company are still raving. I will never buy prepared hummus again! Next time I will experiment with an olive-based version. Thanks, epicurious and reviewers for your advice.

I found this dip a little bland when I followed the recipe,so I added pressed garlic, a bit of sesame oil and a healthy dose of cayenne pepper, and then it was much better.

None of my guests could believe this was made with tofu. My version ended up a light shade of green because I mistakenly used the food processor to blend the parsley into the dip. Look out, St. Patty's Day! Tasted great regardless. Used extra lemon juice and parsley as previous reviewers recommended, and agree with their improvements. This stuff is addictive!

Hooray!!! This was a terrific lowfat hummus! Not to mention sooo easy. I took the advice of another cook and used silken tofu. Also added 2-3 cloves of garlic and lots of italian parsley. You really don't miss the tahini. I served it with grilled country bread and it was was terrific!

This was very good simulated hummus! I used a low-fat silken tofu to further "lighten" it. I thought it needed more lemon juice then the recommended minimum amount. I added more parsley (as did other reviewers) too. Next time I would definitely add garlic, and perhaps even a dash of cayenne to give it some zing. I agree with the reviewer who said that the lighter texture makes it a hit compared to tahini-based hummus. A definite keeper!

I tried this recipe because the tahini in most hummus recipes makes me nervous about feeding it to my son, who has peanut and nut allergies. Hurrah -- no one missed the tahini OR detected the tofu! The basic recipe is excellent, and I've also had good results by adding a bulb (or two) of roasted garlic and a roasted red bell pepper to the puree'.

I have made this dip many times now, with many substitutions and it's wonderful. It definitely needs a bit of garlic though. I've substituted groud cumin for the seeds, but it just doesn't work as well. Definitely a keeper. Best with toasted pita.

Every time I have served this, it has been a hit. I find its better the next day, when the tofu has had time to really soak up the flavors.

Will definitely make this healthy hummus again and again. I added garlic and extra parsley. Many times I make hummus and it doesn't get eaten. Too heavy. We gobbled this one up quickly. It's great served with toasted pita wedges topped with a sprinkle of parmesan. YumYum!

Wow, what a great dip! I too added the cloves of garlic. I made this for my parents and my in-laws but I didn't tell them there was tofu in it until they said that they liked it! I didn't have any cumin seed so I just used the powder... maybe because it was in that form that I really couldn't taste it. Next time I'll try to add a little more or maybe a bit of curry paste. I served it with just small crackers. I even took in the leftovers to work, now they want me to bring more! This is definitely a keeper!

This is a fine dip, quickly made, and a great way to use tofu. I added the two cloves of garlic and would continue to do so when I make it again.

This is an excellent dip to make for upcomming holiday parties. I added 2 cloves of garlic and 2 tbsp. grated parmesan cheese.

The tofu gives this dip a very creamy texture. I added 2 cloves of garlic for a little more flavour. Excellent served with veggies as well as pita.
