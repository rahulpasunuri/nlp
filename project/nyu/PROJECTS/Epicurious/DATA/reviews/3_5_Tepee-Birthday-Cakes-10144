This was a great idea. I used it for our Chief's 90th birthday. He loved it. Yes, he is Native American Indian.

I gave this recipe 3 forks not for taste, but for the look on my sons face. Exactly like the previous review, this was alot of work, the end result was too sweet for my taste, but I'm glad I did it. His eyes lit up big time for his 6th birthday party. I'm so glad I did it, but I will NOT be repeating it. Anyone who wants to create a spectacular memory for a kid, have an Indian theme party. We made headbands with elastic and feathers for hats (of course my son had the Chief headband). We strung beads and feathers for Indian jewelery. Pin the tail on the Indian Painthorse and a bucket full of cowboys and Indians poured out onto the table to play with and take home for souveigneers completed a wonderful day for him. I enjoyed watching him most of all.

these cakes were work work work!! But I have to admit my son and his friends were very appreciative and although I wouldn't make them again I am glad I gave it a whirl.....the cakes themselves were pretty good as well.
