Don't make this unless you have the ingredients on hand (such as leftover tomato sauce and cooked fish) -- otherwise it is a lot of effort and expense for an unspec tacular dish. I did put some of the leftover fish mixture in crepes as suggested below and thought it was nice.

Yuck. Nobody ate it.

This dish was excellent, but a ton of work! I added grated nutmeg to the bechamel, used savory crepes instead of no boil lasagne, and sauted the red pepper and swiss chard in garlic and olive oil. Overall delicious, but do not attempt this dish unless you have a lot of time for preparation.
