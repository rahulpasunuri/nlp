I was looking for a rub to use on one sliced, boneless chicken breast that HAD to be cooked in the next 30 minutes, and found this one. I rubbed the spice/butter mixture on the chicken and fried it in a pan. Despite the lack of marinating time and no grill, it was exceptionally good. I served it with coleslaw and it was great. I wish I had taken the time to read all the reviews, though, because I would definitely have halved the salt!

We tried this tonight and it was absolutely delicious. I thought it may be too salty at first, but it was unbelievable and everyone loved it. The grilled bread was awesome and I had to make more from the leftover butter/spice mixture. Will definitely make again.

Really great recipe I used smoked paprika instead of the cayenne,but the rest was like the recipe. The butter spice mix is excellent I will use this rub again. Makes a nice golden skin on it.

This recipe is a family favorite. I can't remember how many times we've made it. The bread made with butter and the rub is soooo good that we always need to make extra. Yummy. Easy. Perfect!

This is a wonderful chicken recipe. Easy and very tasty. Chicken stays moist and the spices add a very nice flavor. A definite keeper.

My six-year-old son calls this his favorite chicken! As there are just 3 of us, we always have leftovers, which are great as is. But I've also used the chicken, pulled from the bone, to make soft tacos the next night. I saute onions, mushrooms, and peppers from the salad bar, sprinkle the veggies with some of the rub, add the chicken to warm and serve with tortillas, salsa, etc. Quick and easy and very yummy!

Made it for my roommates and then took it to work next day after. Everyone went crazy for it. I had people texting me in the middle of the night: "Chicken!! More chicken!!"

Delicious hot or cold. I donot put butter on afterwards; the chicken does not need it. I use the butter and extra spices to toast pecans to serve with drinks before dinner. 1 tablespoon spices w/ 2 tablespoons butter, toss a couple handfuls of peacns and bake 10 minutes at 350. YUM!

Needed a way to spice up my buffalo wings, and this was it. Cook in a covered grill on a baking sheet med-hi heat,20 minutes or so each side. Drain and add the reserved spiced butter, cover and cook until crisp as desired, turning frequently. Add a bit honey BBQ/ hot sauce near the end for a nice depth of flavor.

marinated overnight. unbelievable flavor!!! the butter was key addition at the last mintue on the grill. added 1tsp. chipotle powder - unanimous praise at 4th of july

This chicken was moist and delicious...and a kid pleaser. I altered the recipe slightly by using only 1 tbsp of salt and a little oil on the skin side instead of butter.

I have made this recipe pretty much once a week for the past couple of weeks. Everyone loves this recipe, especially my 2 year old daughter. Like everyone else, I reduce the salt in half, I don't use Cayenne, but I replace it with one teaspoon of Chipotle powder. I skip the cornstarch, the lemon pepper seasoning and the butter (don't really need the extra fat and calories) to make a simple dry rub. I put it on and under the skin of on-the-bone chicken. Make sure your grill is at a nice medium heat, and I cook the chicken covered though the recipe doesn't specify. One last thing, I add apple wood chips to my charcoal. A real winner.

With so many positive reviews, I was really excited to try this recipe. Maybe it was too hyped up, but I didn't like it. The first time I made it, the grill flared up so bad (and so quickly) that everything was burnt. I tried making it the next day and stayed next to the grill the whole time. The chicken looked great, but didn't have an impressive taste. Not worth the time or effort.

A great dish! I also used half the salt. Brushing the spiced butter on the chicken after it comes off the grill is key. Delicious!

I used 1 tablespoon kosher salt and half the cayenne (kids!). It was really delicious, and we will have this rub again. Thanks!

I reduced the salt by half, however it was way to spicy. The kids had to use ranch dressing to cool it down. Yuck. If I were to make this again, which is very doubtful, I would cut the cayenne by half.

So delicious! I cut the salt in half, but still thought it was too salty on the bread. I'll use less next time. I made this with bone-in chicken breasts, and we had the leftovers cold. I will be making this often.

WOW this was incredible! I was in a hurry and didn't realize I was supposed to add the spices to the shortening so I just beat the daylights out of my boneless/skinless chicken breasts and rubbed the spice mixture in...then dredged in flour per previous reviews...then rubbed more spice. Then (when I realized my fallacy) I massaged a little olive oil in. Everyone said it was amazing, and I agree! I also didn't have time to read enough reviews, and I would have DEFINITELY reduced the salt content by at least half. It was doable this time, but it would be immeasurably better with less sodium.

Wonderful! I, too, made chicken breasts sans the skin. Rub the spice mixture in well, then dredge in flour. Use the remaining spice mixture & you're set! I grilled them on medium high, indirect heat. 30 minutes was perfect. Mmmmm....

This chicken is superb! My husband loves to use his bbq, but normally isn't a huge fan of chicken. However, with this spicy rub and easy directions, I've found a winner that I'll make over and over that we both love! Followed directions exactly and it's turned out perfect both times.

I literally cleaned the bones, this was so good. I used chicken breast on the bone, but I took off the skin. I did everything exactly the same, except I wanted to make sure it stayed moist, so I rubbed the chicken with spices, then I dredged it in flour (to retain moisture) and shook off the excess, then I rubbed more of the spice on. I also made it in the broiler, and it turned out fine, but the bread on the lower rack. I definatly made extra spice to keep. I honestly think this may be the best grilled chicken I've ever had, it is beyond compare, it really had a great smoky flavor (thanks to the brown sugar) even from the oven! Try this, it's super easy!

The chicken turned out great! It was juicy and very flavorful. The only thing I would change is the amount of salt. I used 1 TBSP and it was still a little salty. I would also add a little more brown sugar.

I used a rotisserie and it turned out great. I can't wait to make it again. Like other reviewers, I also cut the salt in half.

Very tasty. Nice zing. I went with earlier feedback that there's a bit too much salt. I used 1T and it seemed to be plenty. Very easy BBQ dish.

The rub is WAY too salty. I made it with just one tablespoon of salt, and it was still too much. I also followed one reviewer's suggestion and added more sugar. And I think it needs a bit more pepper. I used the rub on a four-pound boneless, skinless turkey breast.

This recipe was way to salty for our taste. If I did happen to make it again I would cut the salt in half if not even more.

Our favorite chicken recipe for grilling! Very easy to make, turns out delicious everytime. One suggestion I have is to reduce the salt slightly. Also, we normally make it with boneless chicken breasts -- not what the recipe recommends, and it turns out great!

Doubled the spice rub as the amount specified seemed a bit skimpy, and would definitely recommend it. I let the rub sit on the chicken for 8 or so hours, and my dinner guests and I loved it-- bread was great too.

This is very good!! It rained the night I wanted to grill it, so I made it on a grill pan. I can only imagine how much better it will taste on a real grill. We also used the butter for corn on the cob. 5 Forks!

CROWD PLEASER! Everyone seems to love this! I substituted paprika for the cayenne however or my hubby and kids choke. I also double or triple it depending on # of guests, except the pepper, which I keep to 1 Tbl. And I use kosher Salt to give a more coarse/crunchy texture. Bon Appetit!

This is the 5th time I've made this recipe. I just double the recipe and store it in spice jars. It's great on just about any poultry, whether baked, broiled or grilled.

Making this for the second time. It's a great and easy way to grill chicken. Wouldn't change a thing. As a transplanted Southerner, I can say we ain't afraid of a little salt or spice.

This is the best chicken I ever ate! It was too cold to grill outside, so I made it in my oven using a roasting pan at 375 degrees F for 45 minutes. I grilled the bread in a frying pan on my stovetop. My family was impressed. I served this with homemade potato salad and biscuits. I will make this again and again.

Easy to make and delicious. Not too spicy and the chicken was very moist. We served it as a salad over lettuce/spinach, tomato, cucumber and toasted pumpkin seeds! pefect for a hot summer evening with a glass of white wine.

Really great dry-rub recipe. Just watch out for flame-ups when grilling the bread. I used less than half the salt, which was about right, and used dried chipotle pepper instead of the chili powder / cayenne mix for a smokier taste.

Rating: 2
All in all, the rub had a pretty good flavor. I agree that the rub was too salty and possibly a bit spicy, depending on your taste. We also overcooked some of our pieces, so watch them carefully. I used the butter on panini bread and didn't really care for it, again I thought it was too salty.

This is one of the best barbeque chicken recipes ever! We put it together fully rubbed with the marinade and then sealed it in plastic bags and kept it on ice for two days while on a boat trip before taking it out and grilling it and our group of 10 couldn't get enough of it! Wonderful flavors, I tripled the brown sugar, to create a carmelizing effect of the rub on the grill. so good!

I finally found the grilled chicken recipe I've been looking for, one that tastes as good as the picture looks! The chicken was incredibly flavorful and moist, and the bread was crispy and utterly delicious. The only changes I'd make would be to (a) cut the salt portion in half, and (b) watch the cooking time carefully - on my gas grill the cooking times are consistently 10 minutes less than called for. This recipe is a keeper, although not for those on a low-fat diet.

Awesome grilled chicken recipe! One teaspoon of cayenne is a lot for the proportion of other ingredients, so cut it down to about 1/4 teaspoon. Did 6 skinless, bone-in breast halves perfectly - and the BREAD!! Need I say more?!

Delicious moist chicken. Cooked on a gas grill for consistent heat. Spices gave lots of flavor without being overpowering. Plan to make it again soon.

The bread was the hit. The chicken was ok, but the butter spread on the bread was gone in a flash...it never made it to the grill.

This is very spicy. I liked it better than my family but basically too spicy for us. I didn't do the bread and I didn't put the flavored butter on the chicken after it was cooked(to cut down on calories). I did sprinkle the spice mixture on a variety of veggies that I was grilling along with the chicken and that was almost better than the chicken. Potatoes, onions, summer squash and fresh green beans sprayed with butter spray and the spice mixture.

Too delicious... try this with cornish hens, split in half, and skip the baguette. Wonderful with skewered grilled vegetables brushed with a little of the spiced butter.

Just like A Cook from Buffalo, I've already made this wonderful chicken 4 times. To get smokey flavor, I added 1 teaspoon of smoked paprika powder. I didn't let it sit overnight in the fridge, but it came out really great.

I'm giving it 4 forks mostly because of its ease and flavor. I didn't find it too salty, and let it sit on the chicken for about 6 hours in the fridge. And I also didn't make the accompanying baguette. Everyone said it was delicious.

This was tasty but too salty. Next time I make it, I will reduce the salt by 1/2. I will also let the rub sit on it longer, overnight in the fridge (as suggested by the prior reviewer).

This had a good flavor - however, I would definitely let the rub stay on longer, probably overnight in the fridge.
