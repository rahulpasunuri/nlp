I actually caramelized Vidalia Onions instead of using shallots and added a touch of garlic to the mix. The flavors were exceptional but I found the mashed potatoes to be dry. Next time, I am going to use more milk or maybe use some heavy cream instead.

A HUGE hit at Thanksgiving. Just perfect. So delicious. Only changes - used grapeseed oil (amazing - try it) instead of olive oil, used a little less than 2 cups shallots because it sounded like too much (would probably have been fine with full amount). Definitely use fresh sage.

Best mashed potatoes ever! I used rosemary instead of sage because its what I had on hand, and it was delicious. This is now my standard potato dish!

This was a very tasty dish although the shallots looked a little stringy when served. The amount of sage needs to be bumped up in order to be present, but I think the amount of milk called for was perfect.

Quite tasty. But I cut down the amount of shallots in mine to about 1 cup...2 would have been way too many.

This turned out well, gave flavor to otherwise plain mashed potatoes.

These were SO GOOD! The sage flavor was masked by the shallots, though. Next time I will add a bit more. I took the user suggestions and added a bit more milk, and increased the cooking time to 40 minutes.

This dish is deliciuos. I adore mashed potatoes and this was a great, easy variation for the classic. The shallots and sage added a nice sweetness to the yukon gold potatoes. Definately recommended!

Great flavour but it is even nicer with a head of roasted garlic to round out the flavours.

The base for the mashed potatoes was really easy, although I made it twice and had to add extra milk both times to get it creamy. The shallot/sage mixture really gave the potatoes a much better taste. Alone the mashed potatoes are kinda bland. I used yukon gold potatoes. Will definitely make again, thanks!

Delicious & easy, but try cooking the potatoes more like 40 minutes to ensure they are done. A new family favorite!

The flavors were delicious, but I had a big problem -- after simmering the potatoes for the 20 minutes called for, they were still not tender (though I didn't know it until I started mashing). I honestly prefer the good old-fashioned boiling-til-the-end method. I'd rather have potatoes that were too soft than those that were not cooked through. I also didn't use two cups of shallots, but a cup of shallots and a cup of onions (I had run out because of another recipe for Thanksgiving). Also, I bet this would be terrific made with the baby/fingerling potatoes. I've always found mashing those to be a snap.

Portland chef, the recipe refers to the Perfect Mashed Potatoes in the first line. Just click on those words and it wil link you to that recipe.

Sounds like a wonderful recipe. Where, ah, are the potatoes, though?
