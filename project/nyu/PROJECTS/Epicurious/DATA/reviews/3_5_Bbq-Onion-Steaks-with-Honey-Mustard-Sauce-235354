I have made this recipe twice. It is a great tasting and easy recipe. Don't over do it with the oil/butter baste - they get too oily. The honey mustard sauce is a bonus to grilled onions.

I accidently mixed all the ingredients together at once and they came out great. Now I do it that way all the time. It's enough sauce for 3 -4 onions.

The sauce is gilding the lilly. Just grill the onions with the butter-olive oil mix. Use sweet onions (like Vidalia). Just a bit too much honey. even thise with sweet tooths in the family could only eat less than a whole slice.

Summer savory is an herb. Spice Islands seasonings carried it dry. You might be able to find fresh someplace like "Whole Foods" or "Bristol Farms" I haven't made this recipe yet, but after reading the ingredients it has to be fantastic. We love grilled onions on the BBQ

Can someone please tell me what Summer Savory is?

Wonderful with grilled steaks. Had to grill longer than the directions stated for the onions to be tender.

This is a great side with any grilled meat.
