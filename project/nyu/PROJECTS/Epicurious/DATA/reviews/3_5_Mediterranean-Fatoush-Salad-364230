Very refreshing - good compliment to an otherwise heavy meal.

just for reference, it's kosher for most Sephardim, although not for Ashkenazim. We (Sephardim) do eat legumes on Pesach.

We just had this salad at a passover Seder with my inlaws and it was EXCELLENT! Everyone around the table commented on how fresh and tasty it was. I'm going to make this often!

We couldn't find fresh arugula. Substituted Boston lettuce. Salad was big hit at our seder last night. Light, unusual taste fit nicely between gefilte fish and soup course.

Just made this for Passover. Needed a larger quantity so I used Trader Joes bagged lettuce - one bag of arugula and one bag of Sorrento Blend which has baby arugula, baby spinach and some red leaf. Added some used diced heirloom tomatoes along with the grape tomatoes since they have more flavor. I put the tomatoes in a bowl and sprinkled with "Herbamare" seasoning while I was preparing the other ingredients. The dressing is what we use daily since we have lemon trees and I make it in a larger quantity. I didn't make the matzo chips since I was serving this in a big glass bowl as part of a potluck. Since I don't care for sweet salads I was very pleased with the fresh taste of this one.

great recipe! many countries have a day old bread raw veggie salads! Shwarma spice is the same as za'atar spice (sesame/tumeric/oregano) and gives the best flavor. prefer day old bread to matza chips but for passover it works. I don't know what those posts are about that mention chick peas-there are none listed in the ingredients?? Enjoy a fresh alternative to the seder!

Za'atar is an Israeli spike that may have been used in this salad for an Israeli preparation. It's hard to find in stores but can be purchased online, and is a great addition to any spice cabinet!

Alexa, this is for Passover, Namm? i don't think so and for chick peas, those are not acceptable for _Passover either

Fatush is a Lebanese salad my mother was from Lebanon. What makes this salad is the bread. You usually use yesterday's bread instead of to throwing it. so This is not the best salad for Passover It is not Kosher

My neighbour makes Fatoush all the time. She is from Isreal. She uses a lot of mint and a lot of parsley and it is really good. Also some sort of sesame seeds and sumach powder and some kind of Isreali spice she gets form her mom, not sure what that is, does anyone else? This recipe sounds very similar to hers otherwise and it is delicious.

I love fatoush and this recipe was really good but I made some alterations and additions. I didn't use mint (couldn't find it at the store) and I don't care for tomatoes so I left those out. I added chickpeas, olives, marinated feta, thinly sliced sundried tomatoes and capers. I also bought some Naan - tore it up, toasted it and tosed it in at the last moment. It was a really statisfying vegetarian dinner..
