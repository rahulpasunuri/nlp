it's a great place to start from... I used 2 Tbsp olive oil in place of the margarine & 2 Tbsp butter (instead of 1/4c) and added half an onion diced and two packets of chicken oxo. I made it in my rice cooker too. It was perfect with chicken souvlaki. mmmm

I made this with only one substitution, olive oil for the margarine. It was very tasty. I would make it the same way again to serve with any richly flavored or acidic dish. I served it with "Sole with Leeks and Tomatoes" and it was perfect. All the additions others added make it a totally different dish that they are reviewing. I think the idea of this simple dish is the creamy richness of the butter. Obviously anything can be added to rice.

I susbstituted 1/4 cup of orzo for 1/4 cup of the rice, used vegetable stock instead of water, and omitted the second addition of butter. So, I guess, I didn't make this recipe, but what I did make was a great side dish with fish.

I like this recipe because it's so basic. There are so many things that can be done with it and that it can be served with it. I'll also be using chicken stock instead of water. I'll also add green peas and sauteed chopped carrots, onions and mushrooms to it. It will be served with orange sesame pork chops.

I really liked this recipe! Well, I used the recipe as a base - then I used chicken stock instead of water, then at the end I added chopped cashews, scallions, and the parley. The crunch of the nuts was perfect, the scallions gave great additional flavor and color. Ate this with salmon and really liked it! Will definitely make again.

actually, some authentic indian dishes require a vast quantity of ghee, not butter (butter is rarely, if ever used in indian cuisine). ghee is a form of clarified butter which gives indian dishes a distinct flavour and aroma. this recipe is an anglicised version of the "buttered" rice that would accompany a rich, spicy indian curry. cooking the rice along with some cardamom pods and a stick of cinammon would greatly enhance the flavour this dish. a sprinkle of roughly chopped blanched almonds would add an interesting texture too.

This recipe is awesome to me. Grant it, alot of butter was used but the name is "BUTTER rice pilaf". For those that do not want to use alot of margerine, "I can't believe it's not butter" serves the same purpose and taste the same, it's just healthier. This recipe get an A+!!!!!!!!!

This recipe has too much butter,and what is up with the margarine?,as far as I know,mediterranean food is based on olive oil,not butter. Anyway,I make a similar recipe,but is a risotto and it has peas on it,try sauteing some minced onion,add some peas and the parsley with the rice and then add the liquid and cook. To aila@hotmail.com,tell me what when wrong and I'll tell you what to do.

To L.A./Cambridge: The reason this was with an Indian menu, it that they like to cook with LOTS of butter. Their foods are so highly seasoned with curries and so on that to have the rice as equally flavoured would be too much. This is meant to accompany...not to dominate

i don't understand why this recipe is on an indian dinner menu. it's a basic european pilaf. indians don't even have parsley! a simple indian pilaf would involve fried onion and a couple of toasted spices -- maybe whole black peppercorns, turmeric and black mustard seeds.

Per previous comments, I cut way down on the butter, using half butter, half olive oil in the beginning and omitting later additions altogether. I also sauteed 1/4 cup chopped onions in it first, before rice, used chicken broth instead of water and added some dried parsley since I didn't have any fresh. It turned out okay. I would make it again.

Perhaps I did not make this recipe correctly. Maybe someone can give this first time cook a few pointers or two? Anywho, I'm not impressed and yes, the recipe uses too much butter.

Half a cup of butter? Way too much - reduce to about 3-4 tbsp. I also added powered chicken stock to the water - to add another taste sensation to the buttery rice. Good all-round rice to go with almost anything!
