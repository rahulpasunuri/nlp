This is the first time I've had a bad experience with any recipe from epicurious. The spread turned into a gooey, oily, tasteless mess. I had to drain the oil off the top and was embarrassed to serve this. At this point, I have no idea how to salvage this recipe, but be warned......yuck!

The cook from Roseville has it right. You can spoon off the yellow oil, however. But still not good. Many other similar recipes that are much better.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. After baking it the spread was covered with yellow oil from the cheese and butter leaving even the most fearless fat eaters cringing.

I made this as an appetizer for a recent party and it was a great hit! It was so simple, using canned clams, and it had a delciously different taste. I had thought it would be thick to spread on crackers, but it wasn't, which made it good to dip chips into as well. I had to make copies within days of the party (which also helped spread the word about epicurious.com!).
