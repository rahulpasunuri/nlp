I've made this dish many times. It's flavorful, satisfying, and a real treat in the middle of winter, since frozen corn and limas are decent. With a nice salad, it's perfect for dinner with another couple.

A tasty dish good for lunch or supper and a great way to use up leftover ham.

I have been making this recipe since it first appeared with great success. I normally use part of ham (e.g. black forest) instead of a ham steak. It's great with leftover ham too.

I love lima beans and succotash, so I made this recipe based on all the good reviews. Eh. I don't understand all the great reviews. It wasn't terrible, just boring. I'd rather eat plain succotash. Don't waste your time.

Very tasty! Great comfort food; cheddar biscuits were great. I'll definitely make again.

I made this mostly to use up some leftover ham and a can of lima beans that I wanted to get rid of, and was surprised at how tasty it was. I used more thyme than called for (1/2 t., approx.) and added a sprinkling of white pepper. I've never used a beurre manie to thicken a stew this way before, and I really liked the resulting consistency of the stew - not too thick and pasty and not too watery. It would make a good pot pie filling. Next time I make it I might substitute something else for the limas (mushrooms, maybe, or sauteed red bell peppers, or both) since I am not a lima bean fan.

I've been making this recipe ever since it first appeared in Gourmet magazine. My family loves it! However, I use leftover baked ham as I find packaged ham steak watery and generally lacking in flavor.

Not bad, but very so-so. Not worth the trouble, in my opinion.
