These are great, delicately flavored cookies, at least the way I made them. I replaced the sugar with half splenda, half dark brown. I also replaced the minced walnuts with almond meal and some chopped hazelnuts. The recipe is quite small, next time I will double it.

I wasn't terribly impressed with this recipe--the cookies were flat and unattractive, and tasted of little more than chopped walnuts, even after the addition of chocolate. If you're dead set on making these cookies, take note: while you do end up with a fair number of cookies, each is quite thin, making the overall cookie volume rather low (relative to most cookie recipes).

Loved these little thins! I made half per the recipe and half with pecans and 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips. Prefer the latter, but they are delicious both ways. Be very careful not to over cook. Don't use a dark cookie sheet. In my oven these need the bare 5 min.

I can't bake them fast enough to keep up with my family. A favorite because they are not overly sweet.

Great little cookie! Cooked half the recipe as is, the other half I threw in some mini chocolate chips. Yum!
