Absolutely one of the best tuna recipes I ever made. Easy and yummy!! No changes to this recipe are needed.

Loved it! The capers, pine nuts and fresh herbs added wonderful little notes to every bite. I used what I had on hand so substituted shallot for onion, canned diced tomato, just a sprinkle of currants instead of 1/4 cup of raisins, and no olives. I'm sure the olives would be great too so I definitely plan to make it again. I served it with rappini -- any bitter green complements the slightly sweet tomato sauce.

This was fantastic, even though I didn't have capers or pine nuts or the fresh herbs--and my tuna was a few days old! Loved how fast it was. I used a yellow heirloom tomato and some red grape tomatoes. I can't wait to try it with capers and fresh tuna. YUM.

I did this a tad bit different, I eliminated the raisins because I don't like sweet stuff in my savory foods. So I sauteed a minced shallot then added everything else, I added a 1/4 cup white wine let it reduce, I used a can of diced Roma tomatoes with juice and let it cook down. Much better... :-)

I never had thought Tuna can be so tasty when mixed with tomatoes. It's a surprise really.
