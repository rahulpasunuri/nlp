Need more cooking time and a bit pedestrian. Herbes de Provence don't have fennel seeds btw. Thyme, Rosemary, sometimes oregano and savory.

No doubt this dish is super easy to make. The lamb needs much more cooking time than recommended, most other lam shank recipes go ~3 hours. I was disappointed with the sauce, it was a bit too strong, perhaps less red wine, and some beef broth instead.

This was delicious. I cooked the meat for about three hours, until it was very, very tender. After skimming off the fat, I thickened the sauce with a beurre manié so that it clung to the meat a bit more. An absolutely lovely, easy way to enjoy lamb shanks.

Made this for Sunday dinner, scaling down from 6 to 2. Substituted shiitake mushrooms for porcini, and served it over spaetzle. We loved it. Very tasty, very easy. This is a keeper.

Great recipe, but I have a nice twist. I have made this many times and it is always a crowd pleaser. My best however was to replace the lamb shanks with lean stew beef (sirloin tip), add cubed yams and one additional cup of wine. It turns out a bit different as the yams break down a bit and create a puree broth, but it was really great. This base recipe works for just about any slow cook meat.

I made this recipe this evening to great reviews from my husband. I agree it was quite good. I followed the recipe as stated with only a couple of deviations; 1. I added about 1tsp of sugar to counter the acidity of the wine and tomatoes. 2. I simmered the shanks for 2 hours. The shanks came out so tender you did not need a knife, it came right off the bone! I served this over mashed potatoes which was a lovely combo. This was an easy and tasty recipe that is definitely a keeper!

What a great recipe! When the cookng was finished, the meat literally fell off the bones, The Hrbes de Provence added immeasurably ro the exotic flavors. I served the shanks with Champ * mashed potatoes with scallions infused with milk and butter. Defiinitely a keeper!

Great recipe. Easy to prepare and the wine and tomatoes flavor the meat well. Used a petit Syrah for the wine and butter instead of olive oil (my own preference). Did not like the sprinkling of parsley at the end, as it didn't add much to the dish, just looks pretty. I also needed more time for the meat to start falling off the bone, about 2 hours.

Not a bad dish - very easy to prepare, however, the sauce needed a little honey to remove the acidity of the wine and it also comlimented the lamb. I cooked this dish for a little under the 2 hour mark, wish I had slow cooked it in a crockpot for about 8 hours - I'm sure the lamb would have been a little more tender. Great dish, will be trying this again for sure...

Delicious. I had to make a few changes due to what I had in the pantry. I reconstituted dried shitaki in boiling water for 45 mins and used that sliced up instead of the porcini. I also skipped the carrots and used dried parsley. I subbed 1/2 of the mushroom water and 1/2 rice wine for the dry red. Still came out wonderful. Also, I had to cook my shanks for a good 45 minutes longer than the recipe stated to get it to that falling off the bone perfect stage.

I thought this recipe was delicious. Use good wine and olive oil and you are guaranteed success. Very easy to prepare. Followed it exactly however I did chop the garlic. I would serve this to company. Patti Robbins Robbins Family Farm, Makers of CA. Extra Virgin Olive oil San Luis Obispo, CA

This was very good but not exceptional. I added additional tomatoes and carrots because the sauce was a bit "dark", meaning heavy. I used a good bottle of wine and I am glad I did; you can really taste it. I probably will try something different next time, but I enjoyed it.

Made this exactly as written and it went over great at our little dinner party. Big points for being EASY. I wish I could give it 3.5 forks. Made it with rice but it would also be good with polenta or mashed potatoes.

A very nice dish considering I put next to no work into it. Took it 3/4 of the way in the early afternoon, left it on the stove with the lid on and the heat off. I returned 5 hours later, simmered for another hour while I made mashed potatoes and it was done.

This recipe is just wonderful. Only tried it once so far but it was a great hit. Meat fell off the bone, the Herbes de Provence are a 'must', I think - nothing quite compares. Sauce was delicious. Wonderful over decadent buttery mashed potatoes...life's too short not to enjoy GOOD food - I'm with the French and their Herbs de Provence!

I have a favourite recipe for Lamb Shanks but thought I should try something new. Made this recipe last night (scaled down for two lamb shanks). It has taken over the favourite spot on my Lamb Shank recipe list.

this dish was fabulous, very flavorful and what an easy dish. I would increase cooking time however, I found the meat was not quite as tender as it could have been. Will definitely make this again.

I'd have to advise the cook who rued the wasting of a good bottle of wine to reconsider. . .can't imagine that he/she followed the recipe precisely because it's a knock-out, especially paired with creamy polenta. Lots of flavor, even with no changes or additions to recipe. And very, very easy to prepare.

What a delightful dish and so easy too! I too used only four shanks; but I will say that it took a good two hours to cook. Served it over rigatoni and my guests were so happy.

I took the risk of making this dish the very first time for friends of ours. I used crushed garlic, instead of whole cloves, and inadvertently left out the carrots. Also, I substituted 4 lamb shoulders for the six lamb shanks at the recommendation of my butcher. It came out just great and, it was easy to prepare.

My husband & I enjoyed this dish, however, we did make a few minor changes. First, I chopped the garlic. Whole garlic cloves don't thrilled me even if they've been braised for an hour and half. Second, we added the carrots the last 20 minutes of cooking. They were still tender and full of flavor, as opposed to the recipe calling them to be adding in the beginning, which would have left them over cooked. The sauce was delicious and cut through the heaviness of the lamb. Great over polenta!

I followed the recipe exactly. Very disappointing flavor. The sauce was bland, bland, bland. Complete waste of a very good bottle of wine ('01 Whitehall Lane). Will not make this again.

We entertain at our home in Napa and our vineyard/winery friends love this dish. Great Zins/Syrahs make it happen!

A great dish, and once everything is in the pot there's nothing to do but wait for it to be done! I used veal shanks instead of lamb shanks (it's what the grocers had on hand) and increased the cooking time to 2 1/2 hours. I served it on top of mashed potatoes and it was a hit! Make sure you add enough salt...

Absolutely delicious! Use a good quality red wine since that flavor dominates the dish.

I normally reserve hearty dishes such as this one for winter months,yet we enjoyed this recipe so much we couldn't wait to eat it again. It certainly helped to get over the "June Gloom" here in California
