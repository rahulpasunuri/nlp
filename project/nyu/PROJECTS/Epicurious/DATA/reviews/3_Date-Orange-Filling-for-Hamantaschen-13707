Wonderful Flavor! Simple and easy to make. More than enough filling for a hamantaschen recipe.

I really liked this filling and used it with the cream cheese hamantaschen.

This very tasty filling is a little different from the standard poppy seed or fruit filling. It's easy to make, especially if you can buy blocks of pitted mashed dates (which I obviously can).

We loved this filling (adults moreso than kids). Would be a wonderful topping for brie as well. Don't let the (initially) strong almond flavor scare you off -- it mellows after a few hours. We'll make this one again.
