Loved this salad. I used balsamic vinegar and sprinkled it with crumbled goat cheese. With some crusty bread and a glass of white wine it was a wonderful light dinner but also fabulous with grilled steak!

Love the combination of flavors, but I like a higher ratio of vinegar to oil for the dressing.

Another great recipe. I had left over and made a sandwich the next day with a slice of fresh mozzerella. It was delicious, delicious, delicious.

Delicious-- even when made using an indoor grill. The peppers and the shrooms were wonderful. I've made more dressing using the leftover rosemary, and its great on regular salads as well.

I substituted balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar and served the entire dish on baby spinach leaves. It was the hit of the meal!!! A total 10!!!

This is a really flavorful, satisfying dish. I tossed in a can of cannellini beans to fill it out and ate it as a vegetarian lunch. I don't have a grill at home (and it would take hours to do all this grilling in my 10" grill pan) so I roasted the peppers and mushrooms in the oven instead, and they came out fine. I also saved the juice from the peppers as I peeled them and whisked it into the dressing, so as not to lose all that flavor. Delicious!

This recipe is easy and fun to make. A new great B-B-Q season favorite and it tastes like it should have been on the menu in the first place. The mix of flavors will wake up your tastebuds and have them begging for more. It goes well with a London Broil, Grilled Chicken or Swordfish and your favorite Wine.

I loved this when I first made it 2 years ago, and I still make it all the time, it's a delicious salad as is. I made this for a dinner party for my mother, and her guests raved! If you like portobello mushrooms this is a must!

This was good and different. Did not absolutely love, but enjoyed. Definitely do not need all of the mushrooms called for!

A nice change from the regular green salad. My only suggestion would be to go easy on the olive oil.

I don't cook often, so I appreciated a recipe that was easy to make yet tasted so exquisite.

Many have begged me for this dressing recipe. Mandatory fresh rosemary, and more red wine vinegar. I like red onions on this as well.

This was very good and easy to make, I was invited to dinner at 6:50pm and had this ready to bring at 7:30pm, used my broiler instead of grilling, gas stove, and used arrugala since that was what I had in the fridge.

I agree that you can reduce the amount of mushrooms by 1/3, but this is truly delicious as written. It goes equally well on spinach leaves.

This is such a good salad...popular with carnivores and vegetarians alike.

This is really good. I did cut back on the amount of portobello--there is really no need for that many. Here is a hint for left overs or maybe even the original day...For lunch the next day, I also had some left over cooked penne pasta--so I thought, why not and I combined them and boy that was terrific as well!

Excellent, loved by all. Will definitely make this on a regular basis. No changes necessary.Served it with the rosemary baked salmon which I did in foil on the barbacue instead of in the oven.A wonderful meal.

Fantastic salad. Here, in New York restaurants, salads like this cost $8-$10 and this one was better!
