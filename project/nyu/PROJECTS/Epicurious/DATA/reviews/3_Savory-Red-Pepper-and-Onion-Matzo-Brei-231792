2 eggs per sheet of matzo? I don't think ju1244 has a clue about Matzo Brei (or friend matzo, as we called it growing). The ratio is more like two sheets of matzo per egg. Otherwise, we're talking an omelet! Plus I have never in over 50 years of traditional Jewish cooking ever heard of anyone browing matzos separately. Trust the other reviewers and disregard the 90210 maven.

I am so tired of readers completely changing the recipe then giving it a good rating! The idea is to RATE THE RECIPE, allowing for small touches makes sense. I WILL NOT make this recipe again, while I do believe that turning jewish cooking into cuisine is always a challenge this was fundamentally bad in every way. The ratio of eggs to matzoh is wrong by 50% Needs to be at least 2 eggs per matzhoh, generally matzoh are browned separate from the eggs, this approach seemed healthier but it was lousy. My husband said if I make it again he will leave me; yes it was a joke but the recipe was that bad!

I made this recipe for Passover this year and it was a big hit. I used boxed matzo farfel instead of the regular matzo and doubled the recipe.The ratio is 1 cup of matzo farfel for every egg and then just double the rest of the ingredients. I'm sure I'll be making this every year!

What a wonderful variation on an old favorite, adding the onions and red peppers, but the best part was the dill and the addition of some lox bits toward the end. I also took another's recommendation to cook the onions till they were fairly crisp. Both of the recommended changes made this an absolute hit, and I made the dish twice this Passover. Totally delish!

Made this for seder tonight. Was so good, my sister-in-law asked me for recipe. Would not change a thing. It is the perfect sidedish.

I have made this recipe before and would suggest one addition--lox. Just break up some lox into the skillet as you are frying the eggs. It is delicious and our family makes this a traditional brunch at holiday times. Perfect for Passover. You can, if adding lox, decrease the salt.

Didn't have any dill, but other than that, it was absolutely delicious. Best bet is to brown the onions so that they are very crisp. I've been making this for years without the red pepper and it's also excellent.
