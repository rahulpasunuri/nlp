This was not particularly flavorful. I expected more from the chili and lime juice.

I know...it sounds funky, however I have made a similar dish with lemon juice and Tabasco and it is surprisingly refreshing on a hot day...give it a try...and remember salt tends to draw out moisture, so maybe a colinder is a good idea...
