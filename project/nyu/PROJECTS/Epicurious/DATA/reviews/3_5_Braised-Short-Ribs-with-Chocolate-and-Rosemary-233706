made this exactly as written, using grass fed beef and organic everything. had to let the ribs go for another 60 minutes before they really got tender and then it was, maybe, the best short ribs of beef I have ever had.

This was excellent. Easy enough to make as long as you have some time. I added mushrooms to sauteed veggies and used an imersion blender at the end for the gravy. Put it over horseradish mashed potatoes, and served roasted asparagus. Big hit. Thanks !

I cooked this for some friends and it was enjoyed all around. The chocolate adds depth of flavor. My advice: be careful to add the exact amount of chocolate - too much is...well...too much and to let the meat simmer at the lowest temperature possible to ensure tenderness of meat. I served with standard Yukon Gold mashers and corn.

Absolutely delicious! I made it just as in the recipe. There wasn't a bite left and the guests were using bread to get at the gravy. Clean plates all around. You'll want to make mashed potatoes or something to put the gravy on. It even impressed the "foodies"!

Made this for dinner and my husband and 13 year old son loved it. Served over polenta with steamed broccoli. The only changes I made were to add mushrooms (I had some that were going downhill and needed using), using bacon instead of pancetta and cooking the second half in a 300 degree oven for two hours. Perfect for a cold winter's night.

We love short ribs, so I decided to try this new recipe. I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, but a couple of comments: you need a really big dutch oven to fit 6 lbs. of short ribs and all these ingredients. Finding pancetta was not even a possibility w/o driving 40 mins. to Whole Foods, so I used center-cut bacon but I don't think anything is necessary. I didn't buy fresh rosemary, I used dried, but I should have splurged. The chocolate flavor is extremely subtle which I think is probably a good thing. The meat was amazingly "fall of the bone tender" as it always is with short ribs when you cook them for 3 hours. At the end, I took most of the solids out and ran the liquid through a fat strainer and added just a few vegetables back in; served over mashed potatoes. One last note...I didn't cook these on the stove, I put them in the oven on 350 for 3 hours with a lid on; a gas oven is much more efficient than a stovetop and I like the heat to surround the food.

This is a great recipe. I have served it to many different people and they all love it. I would appreciate tips on how to keep the meat on the bone as it makes a better presentation. I served them with Joe's Garliced Mashed Potatoes.

Great flavor. I was very worried after adding the chocolate and rosemary as it smelled more like fudge than a savory entree, but the finished product tasted outstanding. The meat was literally falling off the bone so we ended up with boneless short ribs. Served over plain mashed potatoes which worked well. Will definitely make again.

This is our favorite recipe for short ribs, and a hit to serve to company. It can be halved with full flavor, and we have found that we do not like it reheated--the chocolate makes the sauce bitter the second time around.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe 5-6 times. it is ALWAYS a hit but in my opinion some info is wrong. The time to cook the ribs is more like 3-4 hours NOT 1.5. also it really helps to have the butcher cut your ribs in to 3" lengths to make everything easier to handle and reduce cooking time. also shallots seem to me unnecessary and I find that I need more broth & wine & tomotoes than the recipe calls for to keep enough liquid in the mix to cook the meat.

I cut back on the chocolate (based on suggestions from reviews) the first time around, and was less than impressed. The smoky sweetness is just what this recipe needs.

This recipe is the best I have ever had for braised beef short ribs. We've made it twice, following the recipe exactly and the chocolate is the best part-- it brings out the flavor. The only bad thing about this recipe is that you need to devote about 4 hours for the dish to become a success. But follow the recipe and you will love the results.

I love this recipe. I served it last night at a wine tasting dinner for sommeliers and chefs and they loved it. Have made it several times. HOWEVER, there is too much chocolate in the recipe. Use half as much. That way you end up with a je ne sais quoi taste that no one except pure experts can identify rather than a chocolate sauce. I also modified the recipe as follows: use one can of regular diced tomatoes and one can of fire roasted diced tomatoes. Remove meat from bones (which are great later for a stock). Then break up meat so that you have a least one or two nice chunks per person. Serve over polenta squares.

This was disgusting. Up until the point I added the chocolate it was fine, but afterwards it was really awful. I love Mexcian moles with chocolate but this just had way too much. The cholate dominated everything else and not in a good way. It's difficult for me to understand how anyone could like this.

I actually made a few changes to this recipe when I made it. I used oxtails instead of short ribs. I also added dried wild mushrooms. I think it was very good this way. I did over salt it a bit at the beginning though.

Rating: 4
This is a very good recipe, and the final additions of chocolate and rosemary do a lot to deepen the flavor. A good bit of seasoning is required for the ribs here, and I always add a bit of cayenne for heat. I have made this both on the stovetop and in the oven in a cast-iron Dutch oven. I tend to like what the dry heat of the oven does to soften the meat. Short ribs are just fatty cuts, plain and simple. If you're afraid of the fat, then cook these, debone and pull off a lot of the fat--it comes off quite easily--and shred the meat a bit like pulled pork. Refrigerate it and the sauce overnight. Remove the congealed fat from the sauce and bits of fat that have solidified on the meat. Reheat the sauce and put a bit of it over the meat in another pan, and use this as a reheating liquid for the meat. Then pass the sauce at the table. I sometimes swap beer for the red wine, and you can add other flavors. But this is a good base to build from.

I used ordinary bacon and boneless ribs. After sauteeing the veggies, I put everything in a slow cooker for about six hours, and refrigerated ribs and sauce separately. I cooked the sauce down and then pureed it (to hide the cooked carrots my husband dislikes) and then returned the ribs. I'll use the leftovers as a soup base.

I've made this at least 5 times. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly. It was simply excellent! My husband liked it but wasn't thrilled with the "mole" flavor. So since then, I omit the chocolates. We both love it. I have made it for friends/family and they usually ask for the recipe! This is a great recipe and I recommend that you give it a try!

Delicious! If you happen to cook this in Germany, ask the butcher for 'Hohe Rippe'. It's boneless short ribs.

Almost gave it a 4. Very good, relatively simple, and great flavor. Stick with the suggested amount of chocolate/cocoa, as it's easy to overdo, but more vegetables and rosemary can't hurt. We sauteed mushrooms to extend the leftovers and that was great too. Our 2 year old, who doesn't eat much beef, loved it, especially with the garlic mashed potatoes.

This is a great hearty dish with lots of flavor, however next time I think that I'll increase the rosemary a bit. I used boneless short ribs, which worked out well, and I served it with mashed potatoes with marscapone and a bit of shredded onion and steamed green beans. Great dish!

Rating: 4
I took one chef's advice and did this in the slow cooker and all I can say is... WOW! The key here really is the carmelization of the meat and the slow infusion of the red wine into the meat that really makes the flavors connect. The chocolate and rosemary were a lovely finish. I should've reduced the sauce more to make it thicker but overall it was delicious!

Cooked the recipe a couple of times and then altered methodology and ingredients. Ingredient changes as follows: 2.5 cups onions; 1/2 cup shallots; 1/2 cup celery; 1/2 cup carrots; 1 tbsp rosemary. Cooking method; seal pot with aluminum foil, cover and place in a 300 degree oven for 2 hours. The original is an outstanding recipe, and I added it (w/changes) to my permanent recipe file - the 8th short rib recipe on file.

Actually three and half forks but I'm feeling generous today. Seriously though, this is a wonderful dish. I followed the recipe to the letter except that like others, I used half the amount of short ribs (all other ingredients were as per the recipe.) I usually do my short ribs in the oven so this was the first time I had braised them stove top and it worked out beautifully (as I use Le Creuset pots it was also easier on my back.) This recipe is a permanent addition to my repertoire.

Would I make this recipe again? It was so delicious I ended up making it on back-to-back weekends. The first time I used short ribs and the second time stew meat. Unless you are able to get really good short ribs, I would go with the stew meat. My husband and I, (and our guests the second time) loved the richness and complexity of the sauce. Both the chocolate and rosemary were evident but but not overpowering. The polenta cooked with Reggiano Parmesan was the perfect accompaniment. This will definitely be one of my mainstays.

Great dish! Great over wasabi mashed potatoes. I agree that chunks of chuck roast could sub. for short ribs. If you like this, try Mahogany Beef Stew with Red Wine and Hoisin Sauce (this site) ...another delicious, flavorful sauce!

Halved ingredients as well as cooking time using 2 lbs. of boneless chuck instead of 6 lbs. of short ribs. Measurements were right on. I added a generous amount of button mushrooms halfway through. I made couscous on the side for the gravy, which was ample, and the taste of gravy was very rich and satisfying.

Was thoroughly unimpressed with this recipe. Brown goopy sauce. Tough cut of meat despite stewing it for a long time; chocolate made it heavy and unpalatable. Ended up throwing most of it away.

My butcher was out of short ribs so I made the recipe with beef stew meat. The meat was not as moist as I imagined it would be with the short ribs but still very delicious-the chocolate really adds a layer of complexity to this dish. Can't wait to make it again with short ribs.

Delicious! This was the perfect dinner for a rainy day. I followed the recipe as written. I used canned San Marzano tomatoes, Valrhona Chocolate, Scharffen Berger Cocoa powder, fresh from the butcher short ribs, good wine ... like another reviewer said "sublime" sauce. Served on top of mashed potatoes. Would definitely make again.

This was excellent. The meat was done sooner than expected; the second 1 1/2 hour simmer was closer to 3/4 hours. No one guessed that chocolate was the "secret" ingredient. I served it over polenta accompanied with baked zucchini, a perfect cold rainy Sunday night supper.

Rating: 4
I must say, the sauce was sublime, I didn't change one thing. My only problem, as stated by previous reviewers, was the quality of short ribs falling somewhere between fatty and perfect. I have had much difficulty finding perfect beef short ribs for recipes, and have tried meat markets in Philadelphia, as well as suburban gourmet shops. I find them very difficult to buy. They are either too fatty, or sparse and tough. Every once in a while you get lucky with beef short ribs, and if you do, use them in this recipe, you will be delighted!

My husband made this for Valentine's day... and cooked it in the slow cooker for six hours on low after browing the meats and sauteeing the veggies. He reduced the sauce at the end, adding chocolate as recipe calls for... the ribs were fall off the bone delicious and this required little effort! Totally delicious.

A major disappointment. I had great hopes for this recipe, as I generally love the use of chocolate in main courses. But the chocolate here overwhelmed the dish to the point of obnoxiousness, and had an unpleasant bitter taste. I agree with the poster who observed that the sauce was much better before the chocolate intruded. Oh well, live and learn. Won't make this recipe again,

Delicious! I followed the advice of another reviewer and added a tablespoon of adobe sauce for a bit of smoky punch to the chocolate. As suggested, I also finished the sauce with a hand-held blender for a smoother, silkier texture. I, too, used beef broth, but found myself adding things here and there to round out the taste, which is quite unusual, not really a mole, but similar. Because my reduction, after blending, was a bit thick I thinned it with a little more red wine and beef broth; added a bit of kosher salt and more rosemary. This is a recipe that needs tweaking to be sure! I was so unsure of the flavors I was assembling that I was completely convinced the sauce was a mess. That was until I put the ribs back in to simmer and get warm. What an unusual delight! The flavors all worked together and it was fantastic! I had a lot of left over diced pancetta from the recipe and sautéed it with diced shallots and par-boiled haricot verts and served along with roasted garlic pureed potatoes. Great!

I was really looking forward to using short ribs, but in this city, they usually get made into hamburger and are hard to find. So, I substituted some cubed brisket instead. The chocolate made the sauce incredibly rich and dark. Delicious - but to be honest, I thought it would taste more interesting - instead it tasted very much like a snobby beef bourginone with no mushrooms. I'd like to try it again with short ribs.

This dish was superb. I saw it in Bon Appetit, thought it sounded good (I love mole, which combines meat with chocolate) and it looked elegant enough to serve to a special guest. I followed the recipe exactly, but in my haste I realized I had forgotten to add the cocoa. The recipe did not suffer-- it was SO good!

We bought short ribs from the butcher but found them to be almost inedibly fatty. The sauce tasted really great before the chocolate and rosemary addition, but afterwards it just tasted too weird. It must be a matter of taste, however, as we made the recipe after a rave review from a friend. Also per this advice, we made half the meat but all of the sauce. I would suggest investigating your meat options and not adding the chocolate if it doesn't sound like something you'd normally like. We ended up throwing most of this out.

Wow! 'Made this tasty dish for guests and had them licking their plates! Only adjustments I made were to substitut beef broth for the chicken, and to add a tablespoon of adobo sauce from canned chipotle peppers to the chocolate finish step to add a hint of smoky heat. I also strongly reduced after both the wine and final removal of the meat before the chocolate finish and use a hand blender to smooth the sauce. I accompanied with baby green beans and garlic mashed potatoes. Hmmmmmmm!

A friend gave me several bags of beef short ribs from a side of beef she'd purchased. I perused many recipes, settling on this one. I'm glad she couldn't come to dinner the night I prepared them. What a disappointment. To call this recipe mediocre would be the highest of compliments.

I liked the sauce a lot -- still not sure how I feel about the chocolate but even without it the sauce was excellent. This was my first experience using short ribs and I found them too rich. I'd try this recipe again with a nice chuck roast but have to admit that the sauce wouldn't have the depth that the rib bones bring.

Be forwarned, I haven't made this recipe yet, but I plan to soon. I wanted to speak to those cooks who had trouble with their short ribs, since I cook them often. 1st, be sure that you've actually purchased "beef short ribs". 2nd, "beef short ribs" are a very fatty cut of meat, which is what makes them so lovely & tender, when cooked properly. I feel that browning them in a skillet is not only messy, but it doesn't rid them of quite enough of their fat. I brown mine in the oven, to render some of the fat, before I braise them. You'll still have to skim fat from your sauce, but there will be less of it. I hope this helps. Thanks to everyone who rated this recipe - now I can look forward to enjoying it too!

Rating: 2
I had the same problem as a previous reviewer in that I bought prepackaged short ribs and some of them contained very little or no edible meat. Are short ribs usually like this or did I just get a bad package? Would I have better luck requesting the cut straight from the butcher? Without this problem I would have given the recipe at least 3 forks but for me it was a lot of cooking effort for the amount that was edible in the final product. Otherwise, the sauce was tasty (though I could take or leave the chocolate).

To get a great sauce use great ingredients! The red wine should be a fantastic, full-bodied bordeaux style with layers of flavors. Use dutch processed powder as recommended. For the bittersweet chocolate use Scharffen Berger which has 70% cacao. This is what will give the sauce depth and character. I did use a stick blender at the end to give the sauce a satin finish. A GREAT dish!

This recipe was okay-not great. The sauce just didn't hit the mark - missing the 'bottom note': chicken vs/beef broth? too much onion? thyme? cocoa powder? Not sure. Was much better on day 2; but could be strained for better presentation. To Mick R: Short ribs are pretty pricey in St. Louis, too (what's up with that?!), but as you discovered,any braising cut of beef works nicely.

I have two comments: First - be sure to inspect your ribs. I had never cooked short ribs before. I purchased prepackaged ribs. About 1/2 of them were so full of fat they were inedible. The meaty ones were fabulous. Second comment: I tasted the sauce before and after adding the chocolate and frankly won't bother with it in the future. It adds an earthiness which isn't unpleasant, but I thought the dish was more savory without it -- so you might taste it before adding the chocolate too -- to draw your own conclusion.

I tried this recipe last night for guests, but I altered it slightly. Have never really liked mole/choco sauce, but wanted to retain the Mexican style flavour, so at the end I put in a small tin of chipotles in adobo sauce. The ribs were magnificent! Everyone enjoyed them and kept commenting on how delicious they were. Had quite a bit of sauce left over, which I will freeze for use in another dish. I would definitely make this again; after the 3 hrs cooking time, the meat was falling off the bone and as tender as you could want. Excellent dish!

Yep, this is a keeper! It generates a lot of fat, so after cooking we separated the meat and the sauce and chilled them overnight (everybody knows these types of things are better the next day, anyway). Next day we broke up and discarded the solidified fat on the top of the sauce. We reheated the meat in the oven while warming up the sauce so we could minimize the need for a lot of stirring in a crowded pot. Then we added the chocolate stuff and the meat. This was truly divine. My wife and I are going to consider serving this to company. Toothsome!

I just read the recipe and it does sound promising. I've done cocoa with some other spices as a rub for steaks with good success. I thought I could shed some light on the few questions. To the Brittish Fellow a short rib is really a meat product that comes from either pork or beef. It comes from the rib section that is not suitable for a rib roast. It's usually very inexpensive. I would think that a beef or veal shank would also do well with this type of braising. Pork might not hold up to cocoa flavor but I'll try anything once food wise. To my neighbor from Brookline, the sidedish is very unlikely polenta which almost always has a very yellow color as it comes from cornmeal though I suppose you could make a white corn meal from a highbrid but I've never seen it. If it's a mashed potato let me suggest a recipe from a farm in the north of england near coldstream scottland where I like to go to fish. http://www.heritage-potatoes.co.uk/recipes.htm

Dear Annoying: Give bones a chance. I have not tried this recipe yet. Short ribs are one of my favorite cuts of meat. The bones add flavor and substance to a sauce. So give it a try. I think with the stew beef you may not have as much flavor and body. If you use the flaken variety, the bone can be easily removed. I should add that I HATE chocolate and still am willing to give this a try.
