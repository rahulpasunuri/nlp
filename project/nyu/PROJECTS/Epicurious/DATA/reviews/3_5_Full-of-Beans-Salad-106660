Very delicious. I added a crushed clove of garlic to the vinaigrette and a lot of salt (2 - 2 1/2 tsp) to the salad. It is beautiful and tastes great.

I didn't have parsley, so I decided to use cilantro instead. I also left out the mustard in the vinaigrette and a pinch extra of salt. It turned out to be very tasty!

Nice basic recipe, very flexible for add-ins or substitutions. I expect to make this often! RECOMMENDED: " Chopped fennel stalks and fronds add that faint licoricey flavor and crunch. " Chopped green and/or red bell pepper add crunch and a complementary flavor. " Red onion slivers instead of scallions for yet another color and a better flavor to my mind. " Butter beans add another color, shape and texture. NOT RECOMMENDED: I used canned green beans and it was a mistake. Blanched fresh ones, as in the recipe, would have had much better texture. OTHER SUGGESTIONS: " Celery would work if the fennel isn't handy. " I bet some gently flaked solid white tuna would be marvelous mixed right in.

This seems to be this recipe pretty much with a slight variation on the vinaigrette.

All I had for beans was black and kidney. But I had a beautiful english cucumber, red and green bell peppers and threw in some onion. Also, threw in some cooked spelt rotini.The vinaigrette is to DIE for! Thank you for giving me the base on which to build a fabulous summer salad on this day when it reached over 90~!

Very easy to put together. I used canned green beans because I had them and skipped the wax beans and added some diced tomatoes. The dressing adds a nice flavor. I made this several hours ahead so the flavor would have time to soak in.

We liked this one as well! In a pinch I found it and threw it all together. I did not have any wax beans so we did without but I have to say it was a tasty, easy, throw together salad perfect for summer time. It's a keeper...

Try this with diced mangoes, cilantro instead of parsley, and dried red pepper flakes! If you prefer fewer beans in the salad, you can substitute them for fresh corn kernels. Finally, lime juice brings out the flavor of all your ingredients!
