I had high hopes for this given the previous reviews, but I didn't find it as remarkable as others. It was good, for sure, but I didn't think it was out of this world and felt like it lacked something - maybe a dash of white wine to cook with the mushrooms or some garlic.

Made these last night for a dinner party and they were a big hit. Delicious and quick. To save on expenses I used mostly creminis, with just a few shitake and oyster mushrooms for beautiful flavor and texture. A keeper!

Delicious - a huge pre-dinner party hit, especially the vinaigrette, which we put on fish afterwards - incidentally, the recipe makes way more vinaigrette than you'll need...but you can use it elsewhere.

This is excellent and easy! The dressing really makes it! Will make again and again. Great starter for a dinner party.

Very tasty appetizer! I skipped the truffle oil, but the thyme vinaigrette wasn't lacking in flavour at all.

Good, but didn't blow me away. Also, the thyme vinaigrette needed some salt, in my opinion.

This is my tried and true appetizer that I make pretty much every time we entertain. I love the simple, short list of ingredients, easy preparation, the option to do all of the chopping and sauteeing the day before, and the wonderful reaction from those who enjoy it! I was never into mushrooms, but after making this dish am now hooked to anything and everything mushroom. I think the play between the earthiness of the mushrooms, the "zing" of the vinaigrette, and the distinct truffle oil taste are perfectly balanced and melt in your mouth. Wonderful paired with a variety of wines and a dish I return to again and again without any recipe modifications.

I also meant to mention that I don't know if I would bother with the truffle oil. I had some on hand so I decided to try it but the vinaigrette overpowered the subtle flavour of the oil - but maybe that's just the oil I was using.

This was fantastic! To turn this into a meal, I added a few jumbo shrimp that I needed to get rid of - sauteed them with some butter & shallots on the side, chopped them very coarsely and mixed into the mushrooms just before serving for a more substantial topping. I recommend trying asian grocers for a better assortment of fresh mushrooms - especially shitake & oyster - at MUCH cheaper prices.

Quick, easy and delicious! I had to use fresh oregano, since thyme was not available. I wish I had made a salad. As others stated, the dressing was awesome!

I served this last night with drinks before our thanksgiving meal. The thyme vinaigrette take this appetizer from good to great! I used a mixture of mushrooms (60% crimini, 20% fresh shitake, 20% fresh oyster) and the mixed textures and subtleties were delicious. If you had to choose only one kind of mushroom, get the criminis as they give good flavor bang for your buck! This is definitely a keeper!

Excellent! I made these for a friend's wedding and they were the first to disappear. We served them as small canapes. There was no way to toast bread at the last minutes so we made croutes the day before: dried the bread out in a 325* oven until golden brown, brushed with oil halfway. They'd be even better with freshly toasted bread, I'm sure. The vinaigrette is a beautiful pale green color and it makes a wonderful presentation.

Simply wonderful. Fairly simple recipe with outstanding results. Wouldn't change a thing.

As I'm the only one of us out of truffle oil,I made it anyway and it was great.

Loved it! Though I had to makes several variations: Wild Mushrooms were too expensive so I used Crimini only. I didn't have mayonaise available but I had some homemade aioli. I used that and left out the shallots. The vinaigrette turned out great I used the leftover as a salad dressing. On one of the slices of bread I placed a thin slice of cheese and then topped it with mushrooms. It was delicious and well received. Will definitely make again and forward to friends.
