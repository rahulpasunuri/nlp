Added shredded pineapple and a little juice. Used it as a dipping sauce for lite grilled shrimp. Marvelous.

I should mention, I didn't use the hot sauce when I made it for the kids, and it was still good.

Simple preparation with stellar results. We basted chicken with the sauce while grilling. The husband ate his piece, skin and all (which he usually doesn't do) because he said it was like candy, or bacon--it was that good. The kids liked it, too. I loved that it wasn't too sweet, but had a nice balance of flavors. Will definitely make it again.

It came out very good, I did use on grilled shrimp, but the second time I used two peppers instead of the hot sauce and it was better.
