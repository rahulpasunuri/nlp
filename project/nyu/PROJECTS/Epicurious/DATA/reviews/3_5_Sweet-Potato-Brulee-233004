I thought this was rather bland. I'm not a fan of sticky-sweet sweet potato recipes but this lacked enough spice or interest for me. The brulee was fun but didn't make up for the lack of taste.

Very impressive dish, and easy to boot! My husband actually had the duty of preparing this one, and for him to do so with smashing results really says a lot about how easy this was to prepare...he doesn't even make mac 'n cheese unless absolutely forced. Our dinner guests loved this dish, as did we. Definitely a keeper!!

I personally am not a sweet potato fan, but the members of my family who do like them gobbled up this dish. I didn't have the kind of dish the recipe specifies, but I used a Pyrex pie plate sucessfully instead. I also found that the recipe sounded like much more work than it actually was. Finally, I also used the make-ahead instructions and it turned out well.

This is a wonderful, fun recipe. I have brought it to Thanksgiving dinner the last two years, and our family loves it. Bringing a blow torch to finish it is fun too. We like the contrast of the creamy yams with the crunch of the sugar. The sugar / spice is also a nice contrast to the other traditional flavors.

I agree with Margot, the texture was a bit loose for my taste...i was looking for more of a sweet potato fool which is what I might make next time

I made this for a big family dinner, and everyone loved it. My sister in law ate about half of the dish! Even my picky husband said it was good. I am making it again this weekend for another dinner pary. Definately making this again for future dinner parties. To make it quicker I purchased sweet potatoes that were already cut and peeled from Trader Joes and microwaved them for about five minutes- MUCH FASTER than cooking them in the oven. The pre cut and skinned potatoes cost about $2.00 for a pound, to me it was worth the cost to cut the cooking time by so much.

OK but not great - texture was too loose for our tastes. I agree that the sweet potato brulee recipe from a couple of years ago was better.

Love this dish. I've made it twice this season so far and am making it again today. It's been a guest favorite.

This recipe really lacked flavor and the rich mouthfeel of a creme brulee. Last year there was a recipe with the same name made with yams and heavy cream that had everyone raving. Can't find it on this site anymore.

Very nice texture and so much more delicious than those other thick, sticky sweet recipes. Next time I will make this with a pecan struesel topping that I use on my other favorite sweet potato recipe, instead of the scorched sugar.

My husband made this for Thanksgiving. He is a wiz at creme brulee so it seemed right up his alley. It turned out fine--like a creme brulee--but got mixed reviews. I thought it had a lovely texture with a nice subtle taste, but my husband thought it didn't have much flavor. He recommends the sweet potato and apricot puree with pecan streusel for future Thanksgivings.

This was the stand-out dish of our Thanksgiving celebration, and hardly any was left over. Definitely will add to my annual repetoire.

This dish is easy, make ahead if you need your oven for other things, and delicious. I was working in a kitchen with no food processor so used an immersion blender to puree the sweet potatoes. I strained the mixture into my casserole dish. I'm not sure if it's always so creamy and light, but ours was amazing.

Everytime I make this people think its one of the best things they have ever tasted. Its easy, can be made ahead and warmed last minute and even served as a desert.

This dish went over extremely well with our guests, everyone found it very impressive. It is a very special dish, by taste and appearance. Everyone raved. My husband, who is cooking impaired, made this dish so it must have been pretty easy! The sugary crunch and super-smooth consistency of the pureed potato custard was wonderful. This will probably become our sweet potato recipe for every Thanksgiving. This one comes highly recommended!!
