Made exactly as written and it was very very tasty. Much more flavor than Pho, not too spicy as written once everything is put together. The thai bird chiles though...use caution!

Very good. Used only 1/2 of sambal oelek and substituted chicken for beef, because my husband is not fond of either. Very tasty.

Bun Bo Hue as served in authentic Vietnamese restaurants usually has some fatty pork slices and pork-blood sausages in it. I think this recipe is better adapted to Western tastes and I am looking forward to trying it. Getting lemon grass and rau ram may be a challenge, but there are two Asian markets in my town so that should be possible.

This is a wonderful soup. My husband is a big fan of pho (I'm not) and asked for seconds. I have a very good asian market in the area and was able to find all ingredients. I used only the amount of sambal oelek called for and found that with all the ingredients in the soup it wasn't that spicy.

Luckily, we have a decent Asian market nearby, so ingredients were not the problem. I really liked this recipe- it takes pretty much all day (mostly hands off time), but the soup is really delicious. It makes a lot- excellent for left-overs. Yummy! Stir well before serving as ingredients tend to settle.

Difficult to get to an Aisian market.
