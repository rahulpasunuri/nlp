I read about the blandness of the original recipe and edited it substantially in the following way and it turned out very well: - Used homemade chicken stock and chicken thighs (skin & fat removed) - Removed ham hock and potato - Added celery, leeks, & mushrooms - Added lots of dried basil and other dried herbs, peppercorns, garlic powder, and double the garlic. - Added some lemon juice for acidity I cooked the beans separately and discarded the liquid as I've learned that helps reduce the musical effects of eating beans :). I brought everything to a boil, reduced the heat, and simmered on very low for a couple of hours. Super easy preparation.

This soup was great and really easy to make. Added chicken stock instead of water, and homemade salt pork instead of ham hock, used kenearly yellow eye beans. Thoroughly satisfying, our household ate it up and we will definitely make it again.

This was incredibly disappointing. I may have used too much water, but the flavors never came together and the textures never developed into a rich soup. I did try the chorizo, (Spanish), as suggested by one reviewer which helped a little. I've made much better white bean soups that were also easier so I will dig those out of my recipe file. I won't be making this one again.

This is awesome! I up the garlic and used canned beans. I also added some linguica (smoked sausage). I highly recommend. Not a pretty dish, but the comfort makes up for it.

Its pretty ugly to look at. I thought it was boring to eat, but the family ate it up and thought it was okay.

Since I rarely eat pork, I substituted a half pound of turkey bacon for the ham hocks. I cut the slices into smaller pieces and browned it with the onion, which I chopped and replaced the water with chicken stock. This was the best soup I've had in ages! Froze the left overs and looking forward to enjoying it again very soon.

This was fine, but I've had much better cabbage and white bean soup so I won't be making this recipe again. It was just too bland. The only changes I made were omitting the parsley (because I didn't have it) and used sweet potatoes instead of white. I'd follow the suggestion of other reviewers and add some vegetable or chicken stock instead of plain water.

We made this New Year's Day... for good luck! It was excellent. I did not have ham hocks but did have some Spanish Chorizo which made the soup taste like a Spanish Holiday. I forgot to add potatoes but I bet some Yukon Golds would have been delicious in this. Good Luck in 2010!

Yummmm. Easy to make. Lots of good flavors. Great way to use the left-over ham/bone from holiday parties. The changes I made: I used 2 quarts of vegetable stock and 1 quart of water. Added green beans, extra potatoes, extra cabbage.

This recipe was very good! I couldn't find ham hocks so substituted a smoked picnic ham and the flavor was great. I also used 2 cups of chicken broth instead of all water for added depth. I highly recommend this recipe for cold winter nights!

I don't typically have ham hocks on hand, so I added a fennel/garlic sicilian sausage and added some spicy spanish paprika while cooking (as suggested by another reviewer) which I also sprinkled on top. It really added the smokiness missing and added depth. I also used my own vege stock after reading others' suggestions. Skipped the potatoes and added celery for added texture. Would like to try it again using linguica (as suggested) instead of the sausage.

This is one of my very favorite Gourmet recipes! I've made it numerous times with very slight modifications - cubed ham with broth, bone-in ham with water, and as directed. My favorite is just with a big chunk of ham on the bone and water. I always add extra potatoes and cabbage. And it most definitely is better the second day. This is a winter staple in our house!

Given the reviews, I was hopeful that this recipe would be good -- but I wasn't expecting great! I did take the advice of some other cooks -- I used chicken stock instead of water, and added about a cup and a half of sliced carrots. My family doesn't eat red meat, so I replaced the ham hock with cubed turkey ham and skipped the one hour boil, instead just adding it with the beans and seasonings. We all absolutely loved it! And I'm very excited to taste it today to see if it really does improve after a day; I can't imagine it being better! This is a cheap, nutritious, and delicious meal that will feed my family of two adults and two toddlers probably four full meals. Don't let the rather humble ingredients fool you; magic happens with this recipe!

This soup doesn't have to be plain looking! By adding colorful ingredient, it enhances the flavor ten fold as well. I added sliced carrots, chopped onion, red potatoes instead of yukon. Plain water gives plain flavor so use vegetable stock instead. I used a ham bone purchased from Heavenly Ham and threw it all in the crock pot on low for 8 hours and WOW! I also used canned beans. I stuck the clove in the ham since I chopped the onion.You won't be disappointed!

Very tasty; try serving with a dusting of smoky paprika for color and flavor.

Simple yet delicious. I agree with the previous reviewer that toasted garlic bread is a nice addition.

Simple, fast, filling and economical. Despite the description, this soup is a bit bland. So thick italian garlic bread instead of buttered baguette toast brings more flavor.

I made it for New Year's Day--cabbage is good luck and is has all the ingredients I love! I was pleasantly surprised--it was delicious and well worth the time. I did tweak it a bit-- -used 1 lb of beans, added 2 cloves, 2 bay leaves, chopped the onion, added more thyme and garlic. I did quick soak the beans per the package instructions, but my Mom says ---not necessary. Will try that next time and hopefully.... I will have good fortune the rest of 2008 due to this great soup!

this is exactly like a soup my grandfather from portugal used to make, except he used hominy instead of beans. love it and it reminds me of being a child. also added portuguese sausage called linguisa and it makes it that much better.

This soup is the real deal. It is a hearty and very flavorful stew-like soup. The cabbage balances out the flavor of the ham, and adds a depth to the flavor of the beans. It is also very satiating (not one of those many soups that leaves you still hungry after a large bowl). Because I am a graduate student, plighted with foodie proclivities, at the beginning of every semester, I make a bunch of soups and then flash-freeze them for the nights when I don't have time to cook and my scholarship money is running low... and/or for when my boyfriend wants a good home-cooked meal, and I don't have time to make a multicourse dinner. I tested this soup out because I get bored with vegetable purees, and boy it is really yummy. It freezes brilliantly. The first time I served it to my boyfriend (a talker), he was silent throughout the first course because he was so focused on the soup! Do make it, and enjoy it. And if anyone has any suggestions for how to get re-constituted beans less grainy, please let me know! I don't like the mushy canned white beans, but when I reconsitute the beans they always seem to have a slightly chalky texture.?? Any experts out there?

Made this for our St. Patty's Day party this weekend and it was a hit. A little drab in color but very tatsy. Followed recipe with a few modifications based on ingredient limitations and previous reviews: Doubled the recipe, used 1lb dried beans soaked 12 hours and rinsed, then covered with chicken broth and added sliced smoked turkey sausage. Cut up the onion vs. leaving whole and used ground cloves (did not have whole on hand). Also added a few chopped carrots. Thickened up nicely and was gobbled up by guests.

This is a family favorite. I make it in a crockpot. I just throw in all the ingredients, using whatever meat I have on hand (sometimes chicken, sometimes turkey) and let it cook overnight. Our family eats this often for weekend brunch.

I added a few carrots and some sliced mushrooms. The carrots complement the ham nicely and add some (needed) extra flavor. I salted this dish pretty generously. My boyfriend, who is running a fever today, is very happy to eat some hot, homemade soup.

I must have had a lot of faith in this recipe, because I made a heeyouge stockpot of this! I used smoked turkey legs, and a smoked chicken carcass that had been largely picked over of its meat portions, instead of the ham hocks. I smoked these at home. There was not even enough fat to skim! Much lower sodium too. I used more garlic, and used canned beans because it's been oppressively hot here to be cooking them from dry. But I don't prefer canned beans ordinarily. I froze and vacuum packed many portions for later. Anyway, I liked it a lot and it was a crowd pleaser. If it doesn't have enough flavor for you, perhaps throw in some andouille or other smoked sausage that appeals.

Rating: 3
Mmm-mmm! Good simple fare. I cheated a bit with this and made it quicker (used a little bacon instead of hocks and canned beans) and added a little vegetable stock to give it more flavor, but having tried it I'm definitely going to attempt the REAL thing in the future.

It isn't the fat that makes it gelatinous when cold, it's the fact that you boiled it with bones. When you boil with bones, you extract gelatinous proteins, which will gel when the broth cools. The fat will still float to the top, and will be an obvious layer separate from the gel.

Should be called "Smoked Ham-hock Soup with Cabbage and White Beans." It's really all about the ham-hocks. Not quite tasty enough to justify the time commitment. Also, despite following the recipe exactly (rare for me), there was no way to scrape off the fat--the whole soup was gelatinous when chilled!

Really good soup, I gave it three forks only because I had to add ham soup base at the end from lack of flavor, that did the trick! I am a huge fan of cabbage, beans and potatoes so this was a winner for me, cannot wait to eat it tomorrow as they say the second day is better, I definatly recommend this recipe.

Wonderful stick-to-your-ribs peasant food. This is a great combination of very basic, hearty foods - white beans, ham hock, potato and cabbage. It's going to be a regular.

This soup is absolutely delicious -- it's a bit more time-consumming than i'd like it to be, but it is well worth it.
