I used a beautiful, sweet, ripe honeydew for this. It was fun to make, and was a big hit with my guests. I think it's a perfect summer dessert.

For anyone else who was confused a "Charentais" is a "Cantaloupe"... why they needed to be all mysterious about it is beyond me.

I did not care for this at all. Very "perfumed" flavor and odd tasting with the cream. A total waste of a good melon.
