Instead of white sandwich bread, I use good old Wonder cinnamon-raisin bread. The whole family loves it.

Any time you make a creme anglais, or anything with a hot liquid going into eggs, you have to temper them. Taking small amounts of the hot liquid and slowly pouring into the eggs while whisking. This slowly raises the temp of the eggs without scrambling them. Once they have been heated enough, you can whish together the whole mixture without curdles.

This is absolutely the very best Bread Pudding ever! I have for years tested so many that sounded possibly good as my husband is fanatical about bread pudding (also a flan fan). This beats all and even though more effort is beyond all others and worth the extra work. I also use extra cinnamon/sugar (be sure its a quality cinnamon after all the work that you are putting into it) and sometimes I even do the toast the night before for less work. I add one extra ingredient but please do not let Julia know, I add golden raisins (soaked in brandy, etc, then drained to plump them up) she really would not mind after all. I keep trying other recipes but nothing compares to this as a bread pudding and must be placed under Bread Pudding listings!

To the poster below, just because you botched a simple custard like creme anglais does not make this a bad recipe. You have to be very careful working with yolks and heat.

What a waste of 10 eggs. What others failed to mention in their reviews is that if your creme anglaise curdles, which mine did in a split second - the pudding tastes like scrambled eggs. Yuck. Never again. I've been cooking for 30 years and have never had such a miserable failure in the kitchen.

This is just wonderful! My husband, a bread pudding fan, loved it! It's really more of a "flan meets french toast", which is a great combo. I also upped the cinnamon & sugar. It wasn't clear from the recipe when the custard was ready to pour, though, and it began to clump on me... Still, definitely worth the time!

Everyone in my office raved about this dish. Even though I could not get the custard to work. I have tried this dish twice and both times the eggs would scramble and seperatem, but I will try it again to see if I can get it to work.

Slightly difficult, but overall, its worth it! Our result was a light, and airy, yet still rich bread pudding with a spoungy consistancy. I used LOTS of cinnimon sugar to give it more of a taste, and I was glad I did. The best bread pudding I have ever tried. :)

This bread pudding is easy, different and delicious. I made it for two friends who share my love of bread pudding. They both raved about it.

Absolutely wonderful, and not difficult at all! I made this on a Thursday for a Saturday dinner party--kept it in the fridge for two days and warmed it up in a water bath in a 350 degree oven before serving. It was just scrumptious, and a big hit with our friends. Will definitely make this one again.

This is awesome! Yes, it's more work to make that a regular bread pudding, but it's really fantastic. My husband, a complete non-breadpudding person, had to have seconds. The whole thing rests on the quality of your cinnamon and your vanilla, so get the best. I used both from Penzey's, and I have the Vietnamese cinnamon.
