I think that this recipe is really good.I thinned the sauce with a bit of water and spooned over the fruit. I have a bed and breakfast and am always looking for new ways with fruit. I served this warm over plain, whole yogurt sweetened with a bit of apricot preserves. My guests liked it and the presentation is very appealing.

I think my apricots were not ripe enough because I found the dish quite sour. I used buckwheat honey instead of sugar and threw some blueberries in just at the end for about 30 seconds for color. It looked beautiful on yoghurt but yes it was quite sour. I think it would be beautiful on oatmeal in the morning.
