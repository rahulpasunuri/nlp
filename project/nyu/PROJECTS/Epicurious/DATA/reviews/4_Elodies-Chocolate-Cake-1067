I've been making this cake since it first appeared in Bon Appetit, in 1995. To me, it's more like a brownie than a cake, but whatever it is, it's absolutely delicious! I've gotten so many requests for the recipe and so many compliments, that I'll keep on making Elodie's Chocolate Cake until they won't let me out of the nursing home!

Also, not a brownie. It's a true flourless cake. Also also: I use half soy flour - half WW flour. It seems to give it a subtle nutty flavor.

There are not many cakes an amateur baker can successfully make after consuming half a bottle of wine. This is one of those cakes. You simply can not mess up this recipe. Literally it is flawless in art and design, so to speak. But in all honesty, it's divine. Rich beyond measure. Easy beyond belief. The fact that more people don't know about Elodie's cake is a mystery to me.

I have been using this recipe for the last 15 years and was delighted to throw away my recipe card with the pasted magazine recipe once Epicurious entered the scene. :-) This is the fastest, most delicious, most requested cake I have ever made. I have almost given up on making any other cake only because this is so simple and beloved. I often serve with a lavender infused cream or raspberry sauce. This is a no-fail recipe, it is not too sweet, and it has a perfect texture. Mmmm....

This has been my go-to dessert for weeknight company for the 15 years since the recipe came out. Dense and rich like a nearly flourless chocolate torte should be, save yourself some time and money by using Nestle's semi-sweet morsels. The flavor is just as good as more expensive brands of chocolate, and no chopping.

People who think this is a brownie obviously aren't true foodies with any knowledge of what it takes to make a first class virtually flourless chocolate torte! Go leave your negative comments someplace else where the vast minority hangs out, please. This cake is EXCELLENT and has STOOD THE TEST OF A LONG, LONG TIME!

I have been making this cake for years and we love it. We don't find it to be "brownie-like" at all. Add berries and a bit of Cointreau infused whipped cream..nice and easy.

A few reviewers earlier have noted that this is a brownie and not a cake. However due to the rave reviews I decided to ignore the minority of those who expressed this opinion. To my disappointment, the minority was right, this is really not a cake but a brownie. It may be moist but still a brownie.

I love you Elodie! This is restaurant quality good. I am such a chocoholic that I don't usually like chocolate cakes because they often lack a real chocolatey taste. This one rises above the rest. I had picked it out for my bday and my husband (who is not a baker) made it for me. He used 6oz Ghirardelli semi-sweet and 4oz unsweetened (despite the recipe warning). He baked for more than 10min past the recommended time, as others have previously noted was appropriate. I'll definitely be making it again, and I think I'll be requesting it as my bday cake again next year!

This is an amazing and super easy recipe. It simple enough to whip up right before guests arrive and they're always impressed. Our daughter's name is Elodie so we're inclined to like this cake but it really lives up to its name.

This cake is always requested by friends and family. Beat the eggs thoroughly until the sugar is completely dissolved. Use the best chocolate - I use the 120z semisweet and use the extra 2 oz to decorate the top. Melt with a little whipping cream and honey and drizzle on the cooled cake.

This is a fabulously tasty, moist, and easy cake! One tip though, if you make it for a birthday, don't put candles on it because when the birthday girl/boy blows them out the powdered sugar goes flying!!! :)

I was hoping for a more dense chocolate cake. However, for what this is meant to be it is delightful. I made cupcakes. Very chocolatey yet light and airy. I was worried about the previous cook's comment about it being too "eggy" but I did not find that. Perhaps the eggs I used were smaller. I imagine it would be amazing with whipped cream. Overall very simple and yummy.

One of the best chocolate cake recipes I've ever tried. I have baked this a number of times in a rectangular cake pan, and topped it with a chocolate ganache made from one part bittersweet chocolate to one part whipping cream. I have also substituted potato starch for flour, for a gluten-free cake. No one noticed the difference!!

This cake was absolutely scrumptious, and very easy to make. I made it even easier by melting the chocolate and butter in the microwave. It did require more cooking time than called for but it was well worth the wait. I topped it with creme fraiche and raspberry liqueur and it was amazing.

My daughter and I both make this cake frequently, especially if we're asked to bring dessert to an event. It's always a big hit. I've added my own touches, like fresh raspberries or a raspberry sauce. It's also good if you add espresso granules and very decadent topped with chocolate ganache.

I made this for my husband's birthday. I mixed bittersweet and semi-sweet chocolate and it turned out perfectly. So good, in fact, that it was requested a few days later at my husband's office. I did find that it took about 8-10 minutes longer to cook than the directions state. YUM!

I have made this many many times since it first came out. Lately I have been making it with the Vahlrona Orange chocolate that one can get at whole foods. It adds a whole new dimension to the cake. And yes, it always takes longer to bake than the recipe calls for.

Wow! This is worth every calorie. Like other reviewers, I had to bake the cake about 8 - 10 minutes longer than it called for in the original recipe....heaven...

Though I baked the cake for over an hour, the center still wouldn't set. It tastes good (I used half ghirardelli bittersweet, half guaranda varietal from Trader Joe's), but is too gooey and dense. It might work better baked in ramekins.

Rating: 4
Sooo moist! The rave reviews about how easy this cake is led me to do a trial-run before a dinner party. I had previously tried a recipe from a well-known pastry chef here in Canada and it was awful (and time consuming!!)...very dry with sickly, pasty icing. Elodie's was so quick and easy and very, very moist. I did find it a little brownie-ish the first day, however stored at room temp, the following day it had a real cake-like texture and still extremely moist. A definite 'keeper'! Will try it for guests with cream and fresh berries.

Rating: 4
so simple but sooo decadent! I've made this cake 3 times in one month - the second two times were by request! It's delicious! I used half bittersweet and half semi sweet chocolate. Like the others, I think it needs a bit more cooking time than the recipe calls for.

This cake is extremely decadant and rich (no, it's not a brownie) and is simply delicious. I usually top it with raspberries and sprinkle with powdered sugar. The following is also delicious: after cooling - halve the cake into two layers and spread with a raspberry puree or sauce. Replace the top layer and sprinle with powdered sugar.

I did not have my 10 inch springform pan with me so I put the batter in oven proof ramekins. I baked them for for 15 to 20 mins so they would have a warm oozing center. Served with ice cream or creme anglaise- it's my favoite dessert!!!

OH MAMMA!!! This cake is a little taste of heaven. I have another flourless chocolate cake I usually make, but not anymore. I used a spring form pan. My other cake didn't rise like this one. I served it sprinkled with powered sugar, with whipping cream and fresh strawberries. Everyone went back for seconds. We usually rate on a 1 to 10 scale and my husband rated this a 12. I highly recommend this if you are a chocoholic. And it's easy.

I've made this for my wife every Valentines day for the past 3 years. Interestingly every year the cake tastes different. Last year with basic Baker's chocolate and cocoa the cake wasn't great. This year with semi-sweet bakers chocolate from France and gourmet baking cocoa, the cake was incredible.

This cake was a big hit. It had a great, moist almost fudge-like texture and satisfied everyone's craving for chocolate. Did not have anything better in the pantry than run-of-the-mill semi-sweet chocolate chips, but it still tasted wonderful. Perfect with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream or fresh berries. Is definately a keeper.

This is a fantastic cake -- my picky 10 year old loves it dearly, as has every dinner guest that has put a fork in it! Had cut it out of Gourmet way back when and used it often; recently thought I'd lost the recipe and was very unhappy -- thank goodness for on-line recipe box! You will not be disappointed with this super easy, super elegant, dress up or dress down chocolate wonder -- make it today, and many days to come!

My very favorite recipe of all time. I cannot count how many times I have served this - dusted with powdered sugar, strawberries or raspberries on the side, a sprig of mint...that is all you need.

This is my absolute FAVORITE chocolate cake ever. And so easy! It was the perfect finish to a post-hike autumn feast ... a definite hit from age 9 to 76. I used Chambord (raspberry) liqueur which was good though would increase quantity to maybe a tablespoon. Next time might try soaking dried cranberries or cherries in the liquor and add those. This is a wonderful treat! It's the new specialty of the house.

I've been making this cake for close to 7 years and it never fails to please even the most discerning chocoholics. It can be dressed up by sprinking the powdered sugar with a stencil and serving the cake with whipped cream and raspberries, but is equally fine on it's own. Most importantly, it is quick, easy, and virtually foolproof. Yes, there may be more decadent chocolate desserts, but this makes a pretty dessert and it is more than chocolately enough to satisfy.

Absolutely delicious, and better than a brownie, in my opinion. Instead of 10 ounces of chocolate, I went insane and used about 12. The result, as a friend of mine said, was "Godiva with crumbs." Perfect with whipped cream and/or French vanilla ice-cream. AND it was very easy to make, perfect for baking rookies such as myself.

From the ingredients I thought this would be a recipe for a decadent chocolate dessert, but it's not. By itself it is a moist but otherwise undistinguished cake considering the amount of designer bittersweet chocolate I put into it. There are several great brownie recipes on this site which to me are better chocolate desserts.

Served mine with vanilla bean ice cream and a homemade cherry sauce. I ended up scraping everything off and eating the cake alone. It's a stand out with just a sprinkle of powdered sugar.

May be the best chocolate cake I've ever eaten! I cook it 4 extra minutes before covering with foil, and 4 extra minutes after covering, and it comes out perfectly.

For such a simple recipe, this was fantastic. I definitely recommend this. I've made flourless chocolate cakes which are divine (and very rich); this was still a bit dense and very chocolatey, but it's a bit lighter and less intense than a completely flourless cake. I will make this again for sure!

I make this cake all of the time, and everyone loves it each time. It is so easy, and very delicious. I usually substitute 2 oz. of semisweet chocolate, with 2 oz. of unsweetened chocolate, for a more intense chocolate flavor. Try offering a raspberry wine to drink with it.

The great thing about this cake, other than the fabulous taste, is that it is truly an easy cake to make. The only "fancy" equipment you might need is a springform pan (though you can do it without one). My best friend is such a bad cook - even she can make this one! I find that the microwave works beautifully to melt the chocolate with the butter. Just do it in short increments so you don't overdo it. I glazed this cake once with a bittersweet glaze, but it was too much! Better on its own with a bit of whipped cream or ice cream. The best!

Wonderful easy and impressive cake. First time made it per receipe, second time (for Christmas dinner) added 1/4 cup Baileys Irish Cream to cake mixture and made a Creme Anglaise spiked with Baileys with raspberry sauce dotted and swirled onto plate for decoration - absolutely fabulous in both presentation and taste! Only problem I found was that it took half again as long to bake as the receipe states. Next time I might try Grand Marnier or rum

Although this cake is excellent, I'd have to say that I have at least 2 other recipes which are in the same league...although not as simple to make.
