This is the best pickling liquid for beets on the entire epicurious site! Substituting beet cooking liquid for the water used in most recipes is brilliant, and I cannot speak highly enough of the Salad Dressing made with this pickling liquid. It has become a go-to dressing for me, and I find myself cooking and serving more beets as a result of it. You can find it here: www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views /Watercress-Salad-with-Pickled-Quail- Eggs-109302. First made this as part of the Memory and Desire menu in April 2004. Not a fan of pickled eggs, the quail eggs are quite bearable because they're so small.

I breed Japanese Quail for eggs for eating and for hatching eggs so I came to view recipes here. I should be able to accomodate those of you that can not find the eggs locally. E-mail me at chicksnducklings@aol.com for information. Delicious!
