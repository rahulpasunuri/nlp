This recipe is delicious, extremely tasty, and very easy! The only thing I did differently was leave the garlic in the olive oil. Will definitely be repeating it!

This was a fairly good recipe, but needs some modification. After looking at the proportions, and reading a previous review, I too, was concerned about the seasoning being overly perfumy so I cut the oregano and thyme in half. However, the main gripe is with the heat level. We found that there simply wasn't enough kick in this "spicy" blackened catfish. In fact, even my dinner guest who is typically very sensitive to spicy foods added more cayenne tableside. I'd double the pepper and cayenne next time. Left the garlic in the oil while cooking. Overall, good flavors, but needs more heat.

This is a good, basic recipe. I liked the garlic-infused oil. Next time I would, however, omit the oregano and thyme, which lent an unwanted "perfumey" flavor to the fish.

I make theis recipe very often and to save a lot of time, just have the seafood counter season heavily with cajan spices. Bring it home, dip in some egg, then flour, then panko, fry on an olive oil base then add the butter. I use a mayo, yogurt, and sriracha dipping sauce. Garnish with lime/lemon. 15 minutes tops and the lady thinks you're a pro chef. Game over.

This was so quick and simple to make and tasted great!! I didn't have any cayenne which adds the spicy to this recipe, but it was still great. I'll be sure to have some cayenne when I make this again next time!!!

Very successful. We used no salt but used small grouper fillets which we had on hand. It's easy to overcook smaller fillets! In other respects we followed the recipe as presented. We paired it with the Carrots and Brussels Sprouts recipe from this site. My wife loved the meal!

This was very good and took no time to get from prep to the table. I used Rockfish fillets which I highly recommend. The end result was more like a steak - moist inside with a crusty exterior. Will definitely make again.

Awesome!! We loved this zippy, easy recipe. I did take another readers advise and coated the fish with oil, then applied seasoning, then grilled in cast iron outside. Very nice flavors. Served with a simple tomato and arugula salad. YUM!

Very tasty. I doubled the spice mix, added garlic powder, and used both hot & sweet paprika. Skipped the butter. Prepared it in my cast iron skillet outside on the gas grill. I served this with rice (added about 2 tsp. of spice mix to water) and okra and tomatoes.

Rating: 4
I substituted salmon because it's what I had in the fridge -- absolutely wonderful. I added more cayenne and did without the butter, frying the fish in just olive oil; any more fat and it would have been too greasy. The salmon blackened perfectly and fell apart in perfect flakes. I would make this for company in a heartbeat.

Found this recipe to be one of the tastier for catfish. I cannot eat garlic, and the recipe was delicious without. Forgot the sugar, and used key limes instead of lemon. Doubled the amount of cayenne and used hot paprike - the burn quotient was perfect. My non-fish eating husband took a taste lured by "the burn" and loved it!

My boyfriend loves spicy food but isn't wild about fish, and I love fish but don't want it so spicy that it makes my eyes water. This recipe, after trying many blackening recipes, is the best hands-down. We both love it, and he adds a little hot sauce to his when it's done. I agree that it's a bit oily and opt to coat the fish in something other than oil or butter. I've tried lemon juice, but my favorite is a roasted red pepper spread made by Roland - we found it in the grocery store.

This recipe is a keeper. My husband, a blackened food fan, rated it an excellent. I thought it was very good, and that is saying something since I am not wild about blackened food. After reading all the reviews, I made a few tweaks as suggested by doubling the black pepper and red pepper. Next time I think I'll increase them both more since it had just a very mild kick. I'm also not a fan of oregano (yuck!) but it didn't overpower the blackened mix at all, which was my fear. We also dug out our camp stove and cooked it out on the porch, again because the reviews warned about smoke. To complete the southern touch I served this with the Epicurious recipe of sautéed okra with tomato and corn, and it was a perfect accompaniment. For the reviewer that asked about spices, I find the best quality are Penzey's Spices. You can order from them at www.penzeys.com, visit their stores, or just drool over their catalog! They are also a great resource when needing to know more about specific spices.

Excellent. Not too spicy, not burnt. As given, I thought there was too much salt, even after reducing it by 1/3. Will reduce by half next time. Otherwise, great.

Rating: 3
The seasoning mixture is delicious, however, the method of preparation makes the fish way to oily for me. I prefer to coat the fillets with either melted butter or olive oil and then add the seasoning. I use a well seasoned cast iron skillet that is heated over very high heat, without any additional oil, to blacken the fish. This creates a lot of smoke so adequate ventilation is appropriate! I double the recipe for the spice mixture because I use it a lot, and I also add onion powder, garlic powder, and more pepper.

Really easy, really quick recipe. Agree with other reviewers....add extra cayenne, pepper and a tad sugar. Need to make extra rub overall as catfish really sucks it up. I served it with an avacado, pinapple, ginger, onion, cilantro, lemon juice salsa...it was wonderful. Will definately do again...for company.

Rating: 4
Excellent seasoning - I've been searching for the right combo - this might be it! I tried this on chicken & tilapia - both great. I doubled the cayenne and black pepper - the chicken could definitely handle the spice better - maybe a little too hot for the fish. I used garlic powder in place of garlic, and no butter. As long as you keep enough oil to keep the meat from burning you really don't need much at all.

Fantastic fish and I am NOT a big fish lover. I took note of a review and halved the butter and oil. I'm very glad I did. It would have been WAY too greasy. Was plenty as it was...I might reduce even a little more next time (I did use a Teflon skillet). I also took heed of the advice of yet another review and doubled the spices. Also, glad that I did that as I rubbed a good amount on each fillet. THAT'S what made 'em so good! I'd definitely make this for guests without question!

Per the comments I increased both the cayenne and black pepper becasue we wanted really spicy. I also agree that the bitter/oil could be reduced to half. My boyfriend said it was fine but I thought that it was a touch oily. All in all, very good for such an easy recipe.

Tried it....not so sure?....willing to try again with a few variations. Was hoping to re-create the blackened shrimp( using this blend) we recently had in Chicago. Not very close.....since this was really designed for catfish..... not sure this critique is quite fair? Elaine Leon Nevada City Ca

Very easy - quite good. I used frozen Costco catfish - the ultimate in convenience and cost! Turned out great. Takes nowhere near 45 minutes - including defrosting the fish in my microwave. I'd say that it's more like 25 minutes with fresh or defrosted fish. Good stuff!

This recipe is easy and fantastic! The salt, sugar and spiciness compliment eachother very well. I recommend doubling the recipe as I like to coat the fish very heavily in the seasoning. Wonderful!

This dish is a little lighter and spicier than traditional fried catfish, and is easy to tone down or pep up. Preparation was a cinch! I used store-bought creole seasoning that I already had (basically the same as the recipe), and it was fabulous. My husband LOVED it--the bready texture of the catfish goes well with the salty/spicy blackening. Easy and delicious.

I doubled the cayenne and black pepper, added 1/4 tsp more sugar, and left everything else the way it was. Served with rice and a saute of celery, green peppers, and onions. Delicious -- a keeper, especially for weeknights when neither my husband nor I have time for lengthy preparations. I've also used basa and snapper with good results.

this recipe is great, but it does not include the instructions for drying out the catfish, which means that if you do it as it reads, you will get a huge amount of grease & the fish won't taste so good. i recommend that you use tilapia instead. it also works very well for steak.

The first time we made this we "kicked it up" to a level that made our friend's daughter cry. Since then, we follow the recipe exactly and serve it often for company with black-eyed peas and rice, corn bread and greens. For the holidays, we've mixed up a big batch of rub and are giving it as Xmas gifts.

This recipe is fantastic. I took it easy on the cayenne and even my 4 year old loved it. I have lived in New Orleans and eaten a lot of catfish - this is the best recipe I've found that can be done on top of the stove. It will be in our regular rotation for sure!

I don't know what happened! I followed the recipe exactly, I even left the fish in the pan longer, but it never blackened. I only took two bites and couldn't finish it, my husband ate it but asked to take that off of our "menu". I won't be making this again.

Outstanding. I upped the cayenne pepper to my liking. Perhaps it was just the amount of fish I used, but I thought the prescribed amount of seasoning wasn't nearly enough to cover two whole fillets. I ended up making the mix twice (once per fillet). This catfish came out very black, very spicy, and very very cajun. My girlfriend and I devoured it gleefully.

Excellent, cheap, and easy!! Perfect "nice" weeknight dinner. I doctored up the spice rub with dk brown sugar, twice as much cayene, and a little ground red pepper. I heated up a cast iron skillet in a 450 degree oven while making the garlic oil/butter stovetop. then transferred the oil/butter to the hot cast iron skillet stovetop and seared the filets 3-4 minutes per side. Absolutely Excellent served atop some baby spinach tossed in olive oil, with roasted sweet potato slices from this site. A definite keeper of a menu!

This is a great base to start from, but I found that the garlic butter tends to drown out the flavor of the spices and the catfish! I changed the sugar to dark brown sugar, added a pinch of allspice, and then put the catfish on a gas grill. Preheat the grill to the highest setting. When hot, place the catfish on the grill and cook for 4 to 5 minutes on each side. The catfish holds its shape when you cook it, so you don't need tin foil and since you aren't destroying the spices and drowning the delecate catfish flavor with the garlic butter, it will be a great low-fat dish that explodes with flavor.
