Took this to our "movie group" last night and it went over really well. Tip: Trader Joe has frozen roasted corn that worked perfectly. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written.

This was an awesome salad! I've made a corn dish with almost all these ingredients (minus the pasta), and making that into a pasta salad was an excellent choice. I'll definitely be making this again!

I've actually made this dish twice, the first time as written. The second time I added more pumpkin seeds, lime juice, and switched the queso fresco out for feta. Also to make it easier , although I'm sure less authentic, I roasted everything on sheet pans under the broiler because the first time, it took a long time of standing over the cast iron skillet cooking batch after batch.

Tasty salad. I had never worked with Poblanos before and was surprised how easy it was to char and peel them. The gemelli pasta held up very well as a buffet dish. As recommended by others, I added more tang(approximately 1/3 cup of 50/50 lime juice and olive oil.) While very good and fresh-tasting, the preparation time was longer than I'd anticipated on a day when I had multiple dishes to fix for our Cinco de Mayo party. I'm not sure if the result merited all the preparation time.

Tasty Mexican play on a pasta salad. I halved the recipe (but used a whole jalapeno) and added little extra cumin. The sweetness of the corn balanced the spicy peppers nicely, but like other reviewers suggested I think I will add a squeeze of lime next time.

This is definitely something I'll make again. The flavors were wonderful! A couple of notes: I too think it needs a bit of acid (depending on the acidity of your tomatoes). I made half a recipe and squeezed half of a large lime in. Also, I think it would be better with a cheese that has a bit more attitude. I'll try a good goat milk feta next time. Oh, and keep in mind that it's 6 MAIN course servings. As a side with chicken (half a recipe), my bf and I had a ton left over.

I made this with a friend last weekend and we LOVED it! The flavors are so fresh and combine so well together! It was literally gone the next evening! I made a non-spicy version for my almost 2-year old and she loved it too! I'm making it again this weekend! The only addition I made to the recipe was to add lime juice. Excellent! Exceptional!

good, nice flavors. I'll make this again and play with it a little bit

I wish I could give this 3 1/2 forks because I thought that it was better than 3, but I rarely give out 4's. So I should also start by saying that I really hate it when people review a recipe to which they've made a lot of changes. I'm abut to be guilty of this very thing, but I had my reasons, and I think that it's a testament to the recipe that it can be messed with and remain yummy. It's probably better as written, but Whole Foods was out of poblanos, so I used roasted red peppers. Roasted poblanos are one of my most favorite things, so I would love to make this again and use them. I also used canned tomatoes and frozen corn because these ingredients are currently out of season. If tomatoes are in season, I would suggest using fresh ones, but only if they're really good. Otherwise, the canned was fine. Next time I might use more garlic and cumin, and I will again add some toasted cumin seeds. This recipe got A LOT of compliments, and most of it was eaten. Usually there's a lot of leftover pasta salad at parties, so I was impressed that so many people liked this. It's also nice that it doesn't have mayo or vinegar, which some people find offensive. My only issue with it is that it's very time consuming to prep. However, most of it can be made the day before.

Made this for a luncheon and everyone liked it. However, make sure you do serve it with the cheese - otherwise your guests may sweat profusely. I subbed feta cheese from Boars Head which worked well.

A nice showcase for late summer vegetables. I thought it looked like a lot of veggies when doing the prep, but the resulting texture was perfect. If you are a veggie lover, I would not increase the amount of pasta. While frozen white corn can taste much like fresh, the crunch of fresh corn and toasted pepitas MAKE this dish; I wouldn't bother with this when corn and tomatoes are out of season. I used ricotta salata and found it ho-hum next to the other ingredients; will try to find queso fresco next time. I paired this with grilled bratwurst sausages to please the hubby; with the brats along side, he liked the salad as much as me. This will go into our rotation a few times a summer, but we'll make it over the weekend next time.

We thought this was good--a nice way to eat a lot of vegetables. I liked the flavor everything received from the pan roasting. I skipped the cheese and use pine nuts instead of the pumpkin seeds, and I think the results were good.

I didn't have enough tomatoes, but still the veggie mixture was way too much for one box of pasta. Flavor was OK but it was gloppy. Next time, I'll use 2 boxes, or halve the other ingredients.

This was a waste of ingedients. Nothing special. Actually less than nothing special.

This is an excellent combination of lovely Mexican flavors that has been a repeated success with all guests. Excellent!

My question is, "Does anyone hull pumpkin seeds without roasting"? How do you use them?

Excellent. Every time we serve it, we get accolades.

I made this for a Mother's Day BBQ, and was shocked at what a huge hit it was--especially with my mother. I served it room temperature, used frozen corn, canned tomatoes, jar jalapenos chopped and store-bought roasted pumpkin seeds to save time. I also left out the cheese completely.

Just a note about the pumpkin seeds - they are called pepitas in stores here. I know from experience that the fresh roasted are a bit better, but not as easy as the already roasted.

Excellent recipe. A big hit. The cheese might be difficult to find. Also, the green pumpkin seeds are generally found in a store like Whole Foods and may not necessarily be called pumpkin seeds. I would suggest using more pasta than just 12oz. At least a full 16oz box and maybe even more.

This was very good. I roasted the peppers, corn and onions on the grill. Adds a nice smokey flavor. Labor intensive but worth it.

This is so great it's amazing - who knows why??? Great as a side dish with a sandwich. I think it was still good several days later....I know I kept sneaking it out of the fridge.

Very good - I will definitely make this again. (Would have gotten 4 forks, except it is pretty labor intensive having to roast all the vegetables separately.)

I'm from Mexico City, I think the recipe is really good, it shows the autentic mexican flavor,my boyfriend was so happy with the mexican ingredients.

Excellent! There are many recipes similar to this one floating around...this one is very good! The dry roasting of the veggies adds to the visual appeal. I excluded the jalapeno, and in its place added a few shakes of california red chili pepper. I served it cold, and it was just as good!

We made this dish for a Sunday afternoon barbecue and served it with baby back ribs and a green salad. Everyone agreed it was delicious and and we will certainly have it again. It was also a very pretty dish to set on a table.
