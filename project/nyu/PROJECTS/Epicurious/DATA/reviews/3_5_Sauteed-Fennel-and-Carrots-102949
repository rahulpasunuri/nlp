made as side dish to Roast Chicken with Mustard & Rosemary sauce-- only mistake was that I didn't double the recipe. Would also be good with seafood main course.

Tasty and simple, my favorite combination. Followed the recipe to the T adding only one small addition- a couple of pinches of Herbes de Provence during simmering time.

Exceptionally easy and sophisticated. I didn't have any white wine on hand, so didn't use it. It wasn't missed - the dish was just fine without it.

Great recipe. So simple- especially for my first time preparing fennel. My guests called it "perfect". I added a touch of butter to finish.

I think this is a great simple way to make fennel. I make it with a thinly sliced pear instead of the carrots, and it goes great with a pork chop for a simple after work meal.

I thought this was delicious, and while I made it to go with chicken, I think it would go well with many things. I used red wine because it was all I had on hand, and I think the results were great. I will try it with white to see how it differs.

This was ok, a bit bland but not bad. It was quick and tasted better than frozen veggies but it certainly wasnt anything spectacular. If I make it again I would cook if for less time as I found it lacked crunch. A bit of fresh ginger might add some zip......?

I used thin whole carrots with a bit of the greens left on for color. Also, I didn't have a fennel bulb handy so I substituted 1/2 tsp fennel seed during the simmer stage for the flavor. And I used just a pinch of sugar-I can't stand oversweetened veggies. Excellent with pork loin!

Thanks Epicurious! I think this is awesome. If I had eaten veggies like these as a kid . . . some of my family members chew fennel seeds to aid their digestion, which I think is nasty. But this recipe made a fennel lover out of me. Served with the lamb and yogurt sauce recipe also on this site. My boyfriend has since requested the "licorice carrots" many times, but with so many recipes on this site, why make the same thing twice?

I wasn't impressed with this. It wasn't bad, it wasn't great. The cooking time suggested made the carrots and the fennel overcooked to my taste. The sauce wasn't much flavor, just sort of a sweetness.

We enjoyed the dish a lot. Fennel at this time of year is pretty pricey.

Very tasty. The second time I made it, I substituted Chinese cooking wine for the white wine and it was excellent. This recipe will make a fennel lover out of you.

Good recipe, quick and easy, but like others before me, I reduced the sugar to one teaspoon.

I had never tasted fennel before so I was delighted with this dish. Easy to prepare and my family all gave it a three and one half.

This is a very good low-fat recipe. I also cut the amount of sugar in half. I think a full tablespoon would be too sweet.

An easy way to use winter vegetables. Very tasty.
