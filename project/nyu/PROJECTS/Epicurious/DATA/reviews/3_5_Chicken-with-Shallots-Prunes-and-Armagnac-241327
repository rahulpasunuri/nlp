This dish was a hit and good for company as you can make it ahead and gently reheat. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and sprinkled powdered thyme on them along with the salt and pepper before browning.I would make a bit more sauce than the recipe calls for..my husband and my guests were scraping the pan to spoon over rice!

I made this as written. Butchered a whole chicken into pieces. Loved the sticky, rich sauce. Served with steamed fingerling potatoes and asparagus.

My husband and I made this together 3 or 4 times a couple years ago. Then, we moved and we forgot about it. He's recently asked what happened to that recipe. Yea, here it is. We followed the recipe with the exception of substituting another quality French brandy instead of Armagnac (couldn't find). We both love it; easy to make and you feel practically French. The taste of the prunes (they're just dried plums) along with the shallots was sophisticated and so easy to make. Served over a nice basmati rice, it's great. Light a few candles and eat at the dining room table. It feels like a date in a French restaurant. I'd also serve for a special occasion. Company would think you're a gourmet chef.

This was delicious. I used bone-in chicken breasts. The prunes and shallots kind of melted into a great sauce. Everybody including the children liked it.

I used sherry & onions as well but really it wasn't all that?! I'd def not bother making it another time. Waste of good ingredients more like.

First of all, let me say that sometimes I find it irritating when people completely change the recipe, then give it a bad review. That being said, I totally bastardized this recipe, and it was still delicious! I used what we had, including boneless, skinless chicken thighs, and framboise liquor, as well as dry thyme (they ran out at the supermarket). Still, we were all very happy with the finished product. There's something so delicious about chicken with fruit and some kind of wine/liquor. The shallots were flavorful without being overpowering. I served it with wild rice, and roasted winter vegetables (brussels sprouts, parsnip, pumpkin), to rave reviews. It's a great fall dish.

My husband RAVED about this dish. I decided to go out and buy the Armagnac as I wanted to stay true to the recipe in that respect. I used 1 chicken breast and 1 drumstick and halved the other ingredients. The chicken took 20mins.

This was a great dish. The sauce was outstanding. Although my teenage kids did not like the prunes. But Hubbie and I loved them. He had two servings. I used rum and sherry as I did not have the brandy or armagnac. And use onions instead of shallots but the result was still delish!

Delicious! Made with chicken breasts cleavered in half (and also as Laura recommended below). Served with roasted red potatoes and steamed broccoli. A lovely meal for family and guests.

The sauce was really delicious. I used corvassier and grand marnier instead of armagnac. The flavor and consistency were great. What I didn't like was the chicken. The nicely fried, crispy skin turned soggy and kinda slimy. Next time I'll fry then broil the chicken and serve the sauce on the side. I think next time I'll also add green peppercorns to the sauce.

Delicious! I used 4 half breasts with bone and skin instead of a whole cut-up chicken. I also used more shallots and prunes, as those are the most sought-after treats. I had to cook it for longer than the recommended 17 minutes before the breasts were cooked through. Probably closer to 30, but they were large breasts. Served with multi-grain rice. Guests were quite satisfied, as were the wife and I.

Much anticipation, mediocre results, despite following the recipe exactly. A waste of good (and expensive!) Armagnac.

I forgot to add this note in my previous review: I recommend adding twice as much prunes and shallots or onions as the recipe calls for, at least--we were all fighting for these delicious tidbits, as always happens, I find, when cooking chicken with dried fruits that get plumped up and onions that get carmelized by roasting. mmmm... getting hungry just thinking of it!

This was one of the most delicious meals I've made in a long time. I didn't have armagnac so I used calvados and it was great.

Actually I would give this 2 and a half forks. It was definitely good, but perhaps not fully delicious. The flavors came together nicely. Thanks for the tip to add the prunes at the end and to cook the chicken a little longer. Otherwise I followed the recipe as stated.

This recipe was a hit at my house. I used bone in, skin on chicken thighs, could not find shallots, so I subbed onion quarters, also used good quality brandy in place of Armagnac and balsamic vinegar. Followed advice of others and added prunes at the end. I served with roasted red potatoes and asparagus. Very tasty!

This was fantastic. Only change I made was to use chicken breasts - bone-in, with skin - and it was just the right amount for the rest of the ingredients.

This is truly delicious. Like other cooks, I used bone-in-skin-on chicken thighs: my favourite cut for this kind of dish. Cooks who said this needed extra time are cooking at too low temperature. If you're doing this for a dinner party, make sure that your guests are lurking around the kitchen when you add the second 1/3 cup of armangnac. Also make sure that they are standing well back!

This was OK. Would not make again. Chicken took much longer to cook. I used dried apricots, prunes make me feel old. The sauce was a bit bitter, added a little honey. Added half shallots and fruit at the end to retain shape. Served with couscous.

Subbed sherry for the Armagnac which was terrific. Subbed red wine vinegar for the sherry wine and with the combination above produced and aromatic, flavorful dish. Serve over couscous with nuts and dried cranberries!

Delicious! I added frozen peas for the last 5 minutes of cooking, used chicken thighs, and cognac instead. Also added 1 cup of white wine, with a little pat of roux to thicken the sauce. Served it over whole wheat couscous and it was remarkable. My children 4 and 6 loved it! My son wants it for his school lunch tomorrow.

Very excellent. I used plenty of brandy and prunes as that combo is the true treat of the dish. Goes great over rice and garnished with tyme sprigs. I paired the meal with a Belgium "Dubbel" brown ale. It complimented the dish nicely.

This is bistro fare at its best - and easiest. Armagnac and prunes are a classic combination but cognac works well, too. The only substitution I made was to use aged balsamic instead of the Sherry vinegar. I also swirled one tablespoon unsalted butter into the sauce to finish. Lovely with couscous.

fantastic. i used organic split chicken breasts, and served it with basmati rice and broccoli. the sauce was wonderful - my kids dipped their veggies in it. very easy weeknight recipe.

I was really disappointed in this recipe. It sounded like it was going to taste so good, but really had hardly any flavor at all. I did not use Armangnac, but another kind of "very special brandy" -- but I don't think that change should be significant. It really just didn't taste like much of anything. The prunes and shallots were just OK, and the meat was hardly flavored at all. A real disappointment.

Rating: 3
The dish makes the kitchen smell great! Four thoughts: 1) prunes should be added in last 5-10 minutes of cooking; 2) OK to used red onions cut across the ring if you don't have shallots; 3) cook chicken longer (about 30 minutes); and 4) the sauce needs the vinegar. I prepared dish until just before vinegar addition, cooled on stovetop, and then reheated when ready to serve. Adding the vinegar when plating chicken.

Rating: 2
Decent. Chicken took 3 times as long to cook as recommended in the recipe. Prunes were mushy and unappetizing. As we ate this I began discussing a radical make over including pan roasting the chicken and shallots and creating a pan sauce by deglazing the pan with the brandy, stock, prunes and thyme. My wife then added that such a radical make over means it's not this recipe.

It's very hearty and reminds me of a rustic French dish that a mother would serve. Great for winter.

Very good and easy. Shallots and prunes are tasty. I used chicken breasts and thighs, as opposed to the whole chicken, because it's what I had on hand, the dark thigh meat was excellent in the sauce. I skipped the sherry wine vinegar, because I didn't have any.

This was magnificent!! I cut the shallots in half to brown them. Next time, I would remove the shallots and prunes until the last five minutes, to retain more of their texture and shape. Added another splash of armagnac with the vinegar reduction. Lovely full, sumptuous flavors.

I didn't have Armagnac, but used brandy and thought this was just OK. I nor my husband liked the combination of chicken and prunes...it was bland and not worth the trouble. He suggested adding hot sauce to it as a joke, but I don't think I'd make it again.

My clients loved this recipe and want it added to the repeat list. I served this with Wild Mushrooms, Haricot Vert saute and a smooth Potato/Fennel Gratin. We started the meal with Butternut and Apple Soup, then a salad of greens and sauted goat cheese then finished off the meal with individual Apple Crostatas and Whipped Cream.

I didn't have shallots or prunes or armagnac; however, it was fabulous with onions, apricots, and brandy.

The flavors sounded wonderful together, but I made it a little easier. First, I bloomed the prunes in Hennesy Cognac, then reduced them as suggested. I then made everything else in a dutch oven on the stove top substituting whole garlic cloves for shallots. Nothing had to be separated, I just kept adding everything to the same pan making it a little easier. Once it was simmering, I finished it in the oven at 350 for about 30 minutes. Since I already had the oven going, they came out at the same time as the dauphinoise potatoes, which used the remaining fresh thyme. The flavor sensations were out of this world. Paired with creamy, thyme scented potatoes, green beans with white wine, lemon and garlic and a hearty Chianti...the evening was memorable. I would also suggest a spinach salad with fruit, nuts and a citrus vinaigrette and ending with a light refreshing sorbet. Thanks for the great recipe. All the recipes you print are fabulous. We need more recipes like this for cold Minnesota evenings.

This recipe is a winner. I marinated the prunes in the Armagnac before boiling them. Our guests loved the sauce. This was almost good enough to make the "four forks" rating.

Made this last night for our family of four. YUMMY! I cut up the prunes prior to cooking with brandy, which I think allowed the center fruit to infuse more with the sauce. Only had cherry brandy in the house, and it was a fine compliment to the sweet and savory flavors.

This was delicious! I made it for a small dinner party, and we couldn't stop eating it! I used brandy flights to cut costs. 12 shallots seemed excessive, but it wasn't because they soften up when cooked and are delicious. I will make this again!

Gets 4 forks for ease and deliciousness. My husband made a coq au vin the same weekend and this was just as good and so much easier. I used generic brandy instead of armagnac - keeping the good stuff for after dinner.
