Just drizzle with oil, plain or any flavour, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Baste every few minutes, and enjoy! Really good!

I have made this over a dozen times and it is always a hit. I do core the cauliflower and cut it into florets and evenly distribute across the bottom of the pan which ensures everything cooks evenly. About halfway through the cooking time I turn over the florets. Cutting up the cauliflower does not give me the burnt issues some of the other reviews discuss but carmelizes perfectly. It is absolutely delicious and a fan favorite

Did not have the 90 minutes to bake so I microwaved the whole head for 6 minutes and then convection roasted for 30. Perfect! As other reviewers suggested left out the capers.

I made this without coring the cauliflower and it came out great. Note, I didn't make the sauce. I made Polonaise sauce instead.

I made this for the first time tonight (trying to use up a lot of cauliflower left over from a couple of crudite party trays). It really started smoking the apartment up around the 50 minute mark so I heeded the other reviewer's advice and turned the oven off and let it sit for another 10 minutes or so. It was good but still a little crunchy for my taste except for those parts that touched the pan which were perfect. Next time (and there will be a next time) I'll just suck it up and open all the windows and let it cook.

I LOVE this recipe. I've never made it--not once--when someone hasn't asked me for the recipe. The only thing: Check oven after 50 minutes. Depending upon size of cauliflower, can get pretty dark and crunchy ater 75 minutes (though that tastes good, too!)

Yuch, capers do not go with cauliflower. Not a pleasant flavor at all!

Hey, yum. I had my oven at 450 and my cauliflower started burning at the 50 minute point. Put a tinfoil tent over it, turned the oven off, left the cauliflower in there til the rest of the food was ready. Kept it from burning intensively. All in all, a good dish. Just watch the time you leave it in the oven.

This was good but I let my cauliflower sit too long before putting it in the oven, so the caramelization didn't really turn out as expected. However it was still delicious! Would make again.

Excellent! Added potatoes to the pan to roast together. So yummy. And super easy.

I could have eaten the whole cauliflower to myself! Yummy and so easy!

This was not hit with my family. I actually liked it quite a bit - but majority rules around here. I'll steam the head of cauli next time and serve it with balsamic glaze...then I won't have leftovers.

I had some issues with presentation on this one (couldn't get the head of cauliflower to stay together once I removed the core, so it was really just florets), and I didn't get the carmelized look that other reviewers discussed. But it was DELICIOUS, and in my family, that's all anyone cares about.

Easy and delicious. My oven tends to be hot so I only cooked it for an hour. It came out quite blackened on the surface of the florets but was yummy with the dressing. I didn't feel like measuring the olive oil and lemon juice precisely so it was a bit approximate. I didn't even use all the dressing that I made. I am not a big cauliflower fan but this almost tasted like something else (not sure what). I had to restrain myself from eating the whole head at one sitting!

Wonderfully easy and suprisingly showy at the table. Just pop it in the oven and cook the rest of your meal. This is one of my all time favorites!

I made this several times with a little variation My favorite modification was with grated parmesan cheese mixed in with the oil rub, and a I skipped the capers. I made it with an Italian Pot Roast and polenta.. bitter greens salad/. The crowd went wild!

Forget the capers and the parsley. It is just great with the vinegarette.

I used green-horned cauliflower, so some parts got much browner and crispier than others, but all were delicious. Definitely a repeat!

I love this recipe- it is perfect and simple. It is also a beautiful presentation!

This was excellent. I broke the cauliflower into florets before roasting, but otherwise followed the recipe. Easy, quick, good.

What a wonderful recipe! We loved this, and it was so simple. Our 3 year old loved helping rub in the olive oil.

Absolutely fantastic and extremely simple recipe. I love cauliflower but chopping it to cook can sometimes create an awful mess. This recipe eliminates that step and the cauliflower is so tender after baking that it just falls apart.

I made this with a whole golden cauliflower that came in my CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) box. Wow! It was spectacular! The next time I made it, I backed off on the cooking time for a couple smaller heads. When the hot ceramic pan came out of the oven, I dropped in the dressed greens, which sizzled and wilted deliciously as I presented it in the baking pan. This is a showcase dish that dazzles guests and disappears in a heartbeat.

I used purple cauliflower which I found in my local farmers' market. The whole cauliflower head roasted very well, but didn't carmelize as attractively as it does for me when I break the cauliflower apart into florets. My family didn't care for this dish. If I made this recipe again, I would break the head into florets and use a much smaller amount of dressing.

This is an incredibly appealing way to serve cauliflower--it looks great and tastes absolutely declicious. I am making it now for the second time.

Super easy and a novel way to dress up cauliflower. I added at teaspoon of garlic powder to the dressing to add a little more flavor
