perfect late summer recipe. I added a zucchini and used Walla walla onions. Delicious -- tastes better the next day.

This is a good recipe which I made as directed, but I thought it came out a bit too vinegarey and next time would try it with 2 T of vinegar instead of 3.

This is relatively easy, and quite tasty. I chose to peel the eggplant, and found it too lumpy for a dip after all the cooling wss done, so I pureed it briefly in the food processor. Maybe I didn't chop things finely enough.

I am not a huge fan of eggplant, BUT this was delicious! I made it as directed, but added some golden raisins. We served over toasted french bread and then put some on pasta. The whole family loved it, including my 5 & 3 year olds. Will make again.

Great recipe. Made as written, with one exception: because I wanted it to be a sort of spread for guests, I cut the eggplant into much smaller squares, and I salted/drained the diced eggplant before cooking. Really great, guests loved it, nice & savory & earthy & complex flavors.

Great! Husband hates eggplant and loves this dish. I didn't have italian seasoned diced tomatoes, so I added some dried sage and thyme and a large bay leaf.

This is a nice recipe, but I still am having trouble finding a recipe for the rich tomatoey kind I buy at the deli. I made this recipe but added 1 red pepper and some green olives. To the person who reduced the olive oil -- please don't. Olive oil is the healthy kind of fat that we need in our diet. Not to mention that when you portion out how much food this recipe makes, it's really not that much fat per serving.

I modified the recipe slightly - only used 1 tbsp olive oil (reduces calories drastically), I added 1/4 cup raisins, and another onion. Delicious!

This was my first time making anything with an eggplant, and I was so so happy! Even with my quickly wilting purple globe, this turned out fairly tasty. Was so nervous to taste, but finally did with some rosemary wheat crackers and it was GOOD. So pleased! And WAY easier than expected.

I have made as written (adding one red bell pepper) and also using leftover grilled vegetables. Both are extremely tasty. Usually serve as a side over couscous.

I didn't have any red wine vinegar so I used balsamic vinegar and it was still delicious. I have made this recipe twice already. The first time without the capers or basil. It was good, but is really fantastic with the capers and basil. I also used the smaller japanese eggplants for this recipe. I love easy delicious recipes like this.

Good recipe! I might be tempted to add currants/raisins for a touch of sweetness [NOT sugar]....I also like to add a tsp of cocoa powder [please, NOT SWEETENED] for a rich rustic flavor...you won't taste any chocolate I assure you! Best eatened 2+ days after preparing at room temperature!

We receive a bi-weekly delivery from Capay Farms, we had a beautiful eggplant and we were having company. I found this recipe and we made it as an appetizer. It was wonderful! I didn't change a thing and will make it again. Yummy! We plan on using the leftovers on some pasta.

definetly would add the golden raisins

My recipe is very similar to this one--it also has golden raisins, toasted pine nuts, and sliced green olives. I like this because it can keep in the refrig for two weeks--mine has never made it that long!

Several years ago, I had a caponata recipe that was to die for and I lost it. This seems to be the closest, the only difference is that I add some chopped red, yellow or orange (NOT green) bell pepper as well as a stalk or two of chopped celery. I add these at the same time as the other vegetables. Tasty recipe. Even people who don't think they like eggplant enjoy this.

Well, to be honest I despise eggplant and capers, but I wanted to amke this dish to try to get over my hatred for these items. WOW! I was shocked to discover this had been the best eggplant dish ever. I diced the eggplant a little smaller and used sherry instead of vinegar. Hubby liked it and so did my friends.

easy, great dish. as an appetizer, or leftover on pasta. i used a lot more olive oil, much more vinegar, and tossed in some golden raisins - a must for caponata.

A tangy tasty side dish and a great way to use all those fresh vegetables from the garden. I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned and added sweet italian frying peppers with the onions and eggplant.
