Very nice. I, like another reviewer, didn't have brandy or Cognac - thought I did, so I used Gran Mariner. I also used pancetta instead of bacon. I also doubled the tomato paste. I only had 3/4lb of onion, so I used leeks for the rest. After the time was up, I continued cooking in oven uncovered, to reduce sauce. Will skim in the morning, but the flavor is very nice already.

Few changes that I made: roasted tiny baby bella mushrooms and pearl onions in a balsamic vingear/olive oil/thyme glaze and added them halfway through; used pancetta instead of bacon; added some shiitake mushrooms for extra {love}; removed lid and roasted another hour instead of reducing sauce (lazy trick:) Very rich and delicious- definitely need good bread for mopping sauce!

As to the sauce: First, I would not add all the broth to start; I would start with maybe a cup or so, and then add the rest only as necessary to keep the liquid level just high enough. We want the meat braised, not boiled, and this will make for a richer sauce. Secondly, use a "right-sized" pot; too large and you have to add too much broth to cover the beef sufficiently. Last, has anyone tried removing the lid from the pot during the last half-hour or so to let ithe liquid reduce, rather than doing to the trouble of reducing it seperately afterwards??

Absolutely delicious. I don't think it is the best thing in the world, which is why I'm not giving it 4 forks. First off, you definitely need more fat than what is rendered out of 8 oz of bacon. I used 12 oz and still needed to use some evoo. I didn't find the meet to be dry. However, I did bake it for 1hr40min, 20 min more - maybe that made a difference. I made my life a bit easier and threw in a bag of baby carrots. I also used baby bellas (small portabellas).

Made this as written except for the cooking temp/time. Followed another review and cooked it lower and longer at 300 for 3 1/2 hours. I just used beef from the grocery store, and it came out very tender. My husband loved it and thought it was delicious!

Fantastic dish. I made changes but believe I followed the principle spirit of the recipe. I rendered smoked beef sausage in duck fat rather than use bacon. I was cooking for two so used less chuck roast (mine was angus). I didn't have brandy and since there aren't typically liquor stores open in my town on Sunday's I used what I had - which was Grand Marnier. It may sound weird but I omitted the brown sugar and at the end of the day, I am really impressed by the results. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. However, in order to cut down on dishes, I cooked in a large oven-safe stainless steel skillet rather than a dutch oven. Once I removed it from the oven I placed the meat and veggies in the stainless steel bowl I used earlier and reduced the sauce in the same skillet, then added everything back to the skillet. OMG... The richness of the sauce was completely unexpected. I have no regrets except for I wish I would have found this recipe sooner. Soooo good. Also, I didn't have an issue with dryness as some reviewers noted. I am a complete novice with this style of cooking but it turned out so well, I feel like I should compete on a cooking show or something! Hats off for a great recipe. I believe I will make again for New Year's Eve.

I didn't read any of the reviews before trying this until halfway through. Don't have a dutch oven so did it stove top and simmered it for the same amount of time. I started with pretty good local range fed beef so I didn't have tough dry meet like others. Also, didn't add the cognac and instead just used a bit of the wine I used for the rest of the recipe. I didn't do the full recipe so I only had to use 1 1/2 bottles of wine. I used Egri Bivaker which is my favorite dry red. Got it on sale for 6.49 a bottle so this was to bad of an expense for such a nice dish. I didn't add the bacon, not sure if I would if I made this again. The broth was nice and hearty, beef tender and moist. Overall great dish. One addition is that while I was reducing the broth I put the meat and vegetables in the oven at 300 degrees so they oven roasted for about 40 minutes. Don't know if this made a difference in tenderness but was very pleased with the outcome considering the substitutions and alternations made to the recipe.

First I want to say that this is just beef stew. A good stew but still only a stew. If you are expecting anything different you will be disapointment. The flavor was very good but it was expensive to make. The local wine store pointed me to pino noir which was still $11 per bottle. Trying to ensure the best possible outcome i also bought the chuck roast from the local amish market at $5 per lb and bacon at $4.To get fork tender meat I needed to cook the stew closer to 4 hours. All in all I guess I expected something fantastic but it was still only beef stew.

This recipe stressed me out. Cooking the beef only 1 hr 20 minutes resulted in dry, tough meat. I couldnt believe it, after all that work, browning everything, that it wasnt going to be good. I decided to try to salvage it: I fished out all the vegetables and put the beef back in the oven to cook at a low temp for a long time (I should have followed the other reviewers advice from the get-go). After 3 more hours at 100°C (212°F), the beef was fork tender. I wonder though if it would have been better if I had cooked it low and slow from the beginning. Anyway, all my dinner guests, unaware of the angst behind the scenes, pronounced the meal delicious. Alls well that ends well.

This recipe stressed me out. Cooking the meat only 1.5 hrs resulted in tough, dry meat. After ALL that work, cutting up everything, browning everything, I couldn't believe it wasn't good. So then I cooked it again, at 200°F, for 3 more hours. At which point, it was tender and everything was fine. Thank god I had the time for the rescue mission, and that it worked. Although I imagine if I had followed one reviewer's advice and cooked low and slow from the beginning, it would have been even better. I ran out of steam and I did not reduce the sauce, which was already pretty thick. It would have been better if I had done that. The party guests had no inkling of the angst behind the scenes, and they said it was absolutely delish. All's well that ends well!

I made this dish the other night for my husband and 3 kids aged 12, 10 and 8 for the first time and what a hit it was! I felt like Julia Child for a moment! I used a 5lb beef round roast and took another reviewers advice and cooked the meat for 4 hours in the oven at 300 degrees. The meat just shredded when forked. I was skeptical about needing the 2 bottles of wine but you definately need them both. I didn't feel that this recipe was too time consuming at all since most of the work, which is temporary at most, is being done while it is cooking in the oven. I served it with creamy mashed potatoes. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe, would follow the directions and in the end you will have a lovely, tasteful and impressive meal.

I've made this recipe now at least 6 times, and each time it's turned out very well. Here are some tips to make yours work out well. 1. Make sure your cooking pot is big enough. Use something in cast iron, good quality, Le Creuset or similar. Think BIG. If you're using 3 1/2 or 4 lbs of beef, you'll need a BIG pot. 2. Meat: in the US, chuck roast seems to be the rule. Here in France, I use "collier de boeuf" (from further up the neck) or "paléron" (upper shoulder). The key is that the beef should be decently marbled because otherwise you'll get a dry, tough dish. Cut the chunks of beef on the larger side (1 inch is too small) to prevent them from drying out. Trim out the nasty bits first. 3. Use of bacon fat is indispensable. In this recipe there is not near enough fat to do the entire batch of beef. For those of you in the South of the US who have a drippings tin, you're in good shape. Otherwise, sparingly use sunflower oil to complete the browning of the beef. (OF COURSE, return the bacon to the pot before you put it in the oven.) You *will* have lots of dark bits in the pot for deglazing. Don't worry. 4. Wine. Don't scrimp here. It's not necessary to go crazy, but buy a decent Burgundy or at least a good quality domestic Pinot Noir. And yes, two bottles is what you need. Add the first bottle when you put it in the oven, then top it up during its cooking time (see below) with the second bottle. Remember: if it's not good enough to drink, it's not good enough to cook with. 5. Time. Honestly, this is really a "do a day (or two) before" dish. Two reasons: if you cook it in a VERY slow oven (150C / 300F) for 4-6 hours, you'll be able to get by using a cheaper cut of meat, which will end up very tender: cut-with-fork. Also, you can forget about it in the oven for the majority of the time it's cooking. Second, this gives the flavours in the dish ample time to "marry". The idea of a "quick" beef bourguignon is just not workable.

Superb! My partner is French and he gave this an A+ rating as did I. Two bottles of wine seems a bit much so I reduced to one bottle which produced a rich tasty sauce that had lots of body. Added the meat portion of the bacon as well. Served with baby boiled potatoes and French beans (and mustard of course) and it was a wonderful French meal. Will make for my in-laws in France at Christmas!

Love, love, love it - - tried a crock pot version this time. Delicious over and over again. I have made this family favorite for several years now, but made it in the crock pot for the first time yesterday. I read a review from someone else asking if it was possible so I tried it. I must say that using the crock pot did not save any time or make the process any easier, however it did seem to meld the flavors together better. When I oven braised the stew, it always tasted better the next day after flavors had a chance to meld together. Making it in the crock pot resulted in that same next-day flavor the same day. Crock pot cooking also resulted in the beef cooking up so tender that the chunks literally fell apart making the stew not quite as "pretty" as when it's made in the oven. No complaints about this, but just an observation. I did not brown the beef or veggies in the crock pot, but just transferred the beef and veggies to the crock pot after browning them in a dutch oven as the original recipe calls for. The crock pot simply took the place of oven time in the original recipe. I would definitely make this again using this new crock pot method primarily because of the richer flavor and more tender beef.

We really liked this recipe - sooo much more flavorful than a regular beef stew, worth the extra work and effort. My husband (not a stew fan) went back for seconds! Like others, I used already cubed stew meat (happened to be chuck), dutch oven was dry by the time I went to saute the garlic, carrots, and onion so I threw a couple more slices of bacon in to get more bacon fat. I also threw the cooked bacon in with the seared meat; was afraid 2 bottles of wine would be too much so used 1 bottle of Cabernet during the cooking, added another 1/4 fairly quickly (will try Pinot next time), used "Better than Boullion" instead of canned broth. Put in the oven for 1 hr 20 min and took it out (amount of liquid seemed pretty good). I let it cool and separated the meat and veggies from the liquid and put both in the frige overnight, separated the fat the next day. Tasted the sauce before boiling to reduce and was completely unimpressed so I put the rest of the 3/4 bottle of wine in, added garlic powder, more thyme, more boullion and boiled away. Result: FABULOUS SAUCE!! Put it all together, back in the oven at 275 degrees for about an hour and it was wonderful! Will definitely make again, and may consider purchasing peeled garlic (I hate peeling garlic!!!). Again, time consuming, but definitely worth the effort!

I thought this was wonderful. Made it with 2 pounds of chuck and 1 bottle of Pinot but otherwise, all other ingredients were the same as the recipe. It seemed to take longer to reduce the liquid (and I only used 1 bottle of wine) but it was well worth the time because the flavor was wonderful. I especially liked the whole cloves of garlic after they had cooked for so long. To the question of the bacon, I threw it in the mix. Yummy!

Really good, and although takes time, it's not hard. I started after church and did all my Sunday chores around the baking and boiling down the sauce. I used the bacon grease I have in the freezer since the recipe doesn't call for the bacon to be added, so that removed a step. All my boys enjoyed. The youngest asked for extra gravy. Definitely a keeper. Next trip to Costco I'm picking up more stew meat!

I made this for New Year's Eve annual gathering of friends. This recipe was nothing less than amazing! As others wrote, it is labor intensive but definitely worth the effort. It's is a MUST DO AHEAD recipe to let the favors marry. I think this is key. The reduction of sauce did take more than 40 minutes..more like an hour. I served this with BA's mashed potatoes with carmelized shallots,( YUM!) roasted asparagus and apple walnut salad with cranberry vinigrette. This recipe is as good as Julia's!

Truly exceptional. I couldn't fit all the wine in my dutch oven, so I added the remainder to the saucepan when reducing the sauce. Tasted like it had been cooked with the beef. My husband and guests RAVED about this -- even my brother-in-law the French food snob. Well worth the effort.

A wonderful recipe but LABOR INTENSIVE. I've made this more than once and my kitchen always looks like a bomb went off by the time I finish. I follow the recipe to a "T"(for instance boneless beef chuck is a must) and I would strongly recommend making this the day before you serve it to let the flavors mellow and the cook recuperate. This time I also found a great bouillon ("Better Than Bouillon" is the name) at Costco for the beef broth. All the guests raved, including the French ones.

"What do you do with the bacon?" The bacon should be cooked very crisp because you are just using the fat to brown the beef. I snacked on it while I was finishing the rest of the dish. Someone wrote that they threw the bacon in the stew but I think that would be overbearing. This is a fabulous stew that cooks up so thick that you can serve it on a plate. I cooked it in a 5 qt dutch oven with half the wine (that's all that would fit). Then I added the rest of the wine when I was reducing the broth. It took 45 minutes to cook the tartness out of the wine but it reduced perfectly and tasted like it had roasted with the beef.

Just made this (half recipe for two with leftovers) and really, really loved it. I didn't want it to be too thin and I REALLY didn't want to reduce the sauce again at the end, so I left out the second round of broth and added a bit more wine as it cooked. I used about 3 tbsp fresh thyme and 1/2 tbsp dried, a bay leaf, Baby Bella mushrooms, and about 1/2 cup of OJ like my Mom's hubby told me. Adds a subtle sweet tang. OF COURSE I threw the bacon in there! Not to do so would be such a waste of bacon! I forgot to pick up cognac today, which I think would have added a nice layer, and I'll make certain to keep some on hand for next time, but I don't think the recipe suffered without it. I didn't use good wine for this, just totally mediocre wine. Extra cooking time made the sauce thick and the meat tender.Served with butter wide egg noodles. This is a new Winter staple!

Imagine my surprise when my 7 qt Dutch oven was a wee bit too small to accomodate all the liquid... No matter! I just omitted the last 2 cups of beef stock (what would you rather drink, wine or stock?) and it was still fantastic!!

What a disappointment. I followed the recipe exactly, with no substitutions. It was bland, with a bitterness I attribute to the brandy. The meat was tender but dry.

This dish is amazing; my husband and I ate at an amazing little bistro in Paris this past fall and we had the beef burgundy. The meat was so buttery and the wine sauce so rich and salty! It was eating heaven. I have been trying to recreate that recipe for months. This is the closet I have come! Simply delicious!

I absolutely love this recipe. My grandmother is from France, and she made this dish when I was a child. This is the closest recipe I've found that comes anywhere near what Grandma used to make. It can be labor intensive, but it is worth every minute of work. For extra flavor I'll change up the mushrooms I use (portabella, cremini, etc.), and I add the bacon back to the dish just as my grandmother did. I do recall my grandmother using a bay leaf, but I'm not skilled enough to know how to incorporate that. Oh well, it's still amazing.

To EM,LI,NY My dear, you have made beef stew but not beef bourguignon. You can't possibly get the depth of flavor by using 1/3 of the wine and then skipping the reduction of the liquid. I'm sure your dish was tasty and I mean you no disrespect but let's talk apples to apples.

Did make a couple of substitutions: used brandy for cognac (but really not sure that it added much to the overall taste of the dish; also used much less burgundy - only about 1/3 of what the recipe calls for - which then since the dish had less liquid, it eliminated the need to reduce the sauce at the end. It still had plenty of burgundy flavor. I also substituted sliced Vidalia onions for the boiling onions. Made it the day before so I could skim off the fat and then just reheated before serving. will use my crockpot to serve next time around.

This dish is in the oven as I type and it smells soooo good. Very expensive though - $30 for the wine ($15 per bottle), $28 for the beef (bought from a local butcher), $12 for the pearl onions, $5 for the fresh thyme. I am leaving out the mushrooms and carrots as I plan to serve this dish with wild mushroom risotto and roasted carrots & parsnips (both from this site as well.) If it tastes as good as it smells, it might be worth it. But it has to be pretty fabulous to justify $75. p.s. it doesn't take that long to make. From start to putting it in the oven was 45 minutes or so for me.

Though I am making this recipe for the first time tomorrow, I know it's going to be wonderful (I've made similar ones in the past.) What concerns me is that several cooks mentioned that the meat was dry. I've found this to be true with other stews, too. How can we avoid this? I was thinking that removing the meat from the liquid as soon as it was tender might help, then adding it back when the veggies are done. Does anyone have any suggestions? I even removed meat from one stew because it was so dry, browned a nice steak and used it for the stew instead... At least I got the flavor from the other meat, but what a waste. Looking forward to hearing some suggestions.

This is very good, and best served the day after it is made. However, I think there is too much liquid on balance with the stew ingredients. The sauce should be thicker so I would reduce the canned broth and or increase the flour in the braising of the beef.

I make this dish often and everyone loves it. To cut down on the work, I buy already cut up beef and mushrooms, already peeled garlic cloves,frozen pearl onions and peeled baby carrots. I justify these shortcuts by calling them my sous chef and I don't notice any difference from the more labor intensive technique. This makes it a really easy recipe to make, although it does require time. Good excuse to put in a great movie and stay home while the magic takes place and your house fills up with a great aroma. It is a joy to cook and eat.

Work intensive, but my son in law's favorite dish is Beef Bourguignon and he thought this was the best he has ever tasted. I thought the meat was a trifle dry, but the sauce is lovely. I thickened the reduction with a slurry of 2 Tbsp. cornstarch & 1/4 c. water, which made it cling nicely. Next time I will cook for 3 hours at 250F for more tenderness.

This is an excellent dish. Preparing the ingredients takes a while, but it was well worth the prep time. In fact, I made a friend snip 1/3c. worth of thyme leaves (we have a stem aversion) and she thought it was worth it, too. I used Pinot Noir... I don't remember the brand. Friend, husband and I decided that anyone who thinks the flavor of this dish isn't terrific uses cheap wine or cheap brandy. I go by the rule that if I won't drink it, I won't cook with it. The leftovers, heated on the stove, were even better than the just-prepared dish.

Since there is only two of us, I halfed the recipe. It is quite a process to prepare, but it was well worth it. I did find the flavor to be a bit on the dull side, but I used dried thyme. I think fresh thyme would have made a big difference in the flavor.

When I was younger and my mom made this I really didn't like it. But, this time, WOW! The sauce is amazing. The only thing I did different was to cut up 2 yellow onions because I didn't have pearl onions. It didn't have the alcohol taste that some of the other reviews said it had. And the sauce reduced quite well. I can't wait until tomorrow to have the leftovers for lunch since many said it is much better the second day.

As other reviewers have indicated, this is a wonderful recipe that can be a little time consuming. Peeling all of those onions can be challenging but well worth the effort. I used Pinot Noir wine as suggested and this was fabulous. I served this as my night before Thanksgiving dinner for my houseful of guests. I will definitely make this again.

I have made this recipe several times over the years and it is delicious. I have modified the recipe and cook it on the stovetop. Otherwise it is quite time consuming.

As most of you, I love this recipe too. The last time I made it though, the meat was slightly dry--it could have been that the cut of beef was too lean. I'll choose something more marbled next time. I served this once with roasted garlic mashed potatoes--very good!! I may marinade the beef overnight next time in some of the wine, as per "The Joy of Cooking" recipe version. I had to thicken the gravy--I think I lost patience. Anyway, if you haven't tried this recipe, try it-it's well worth the effort!

I made this for friends and recorded the following notes: 1. Six Qt. Dutch oven too small 2. Easier to flour the meat if divided into two large bowls 3. Reduction of liquid at end of recipe takes longer than 40 mins. 4. I found it a little boozy-tasting. 5. Friends loved it!

Rating: 4
I'd give this 5 forks if I could. It really tastes fantastic, and I haven't even served it yet. It is currently warming on low heat, waiting for my dinner guests. My husband and I sneaked a taste, and we can't wait to sit down to a plateful. The meat isn't the slightest bit dry...it melts in your mouth. I'm planning on serving it over wide noodles with crusty bread and a spring green salad with viniagrette. Chocolate espresso fudge cake for dessert. I used a pinot noir based on recommemdations from other reviewers, since my knowledge of wine is practically non existent. I didn't find the onions terribly irritating to peel. You have to try this. Even a vegetarian would have to admit it smells heavenly while cooking.

The recipe had a very complex and wonderful flavor. I tested it (making only a half recipe) to see if I wanted to make it for a dinner party. I agree that the worst part was peeling the onions. I blanched them but it was still very time consuming. Next time I'll try the frozen onions that someone mentioned. The meat was slightly dry but very tender. I may brown it slightly less next time I make it. The excess liquid reduced beautifully and made a nice "sauce" that wasn't at all runny. I served it with noodles, but may use garlic mashed potatoes for the dinner party. Definitely an impressive recipe.

Thank you.... I'm a firefighter in Hawaii and I needed to expand my recepies and found this dish. When I cook for the guys, I just hope not to get complaints, but I actually had guys ask for my secrets. I think I'll be looking at this site more.

This has become one of my family's favorites! We have tried it with almost every possible side dish (potatoes, pasta, rice and bread) The kids prefer the pasta, the adults prefer the crusty bread. Running out of time one day, we experimented by put the meat in the pressure cooker and cooked the vegetables separately. We divided the liquid evenly between the two. The flavor was as good as ever! And the meat was even more tender in 40 minutes in the pressure cooker than in 90 minutes in the oven. We'll do it this way again!

This is an excellent dish I have made it many times. I use deer and moose cubes and it was great.

This is the best beef stew ever, in my humble opinion. Time-consuming, yes, but rich-tasting and worth it just for the aroma in the house while cooking! To the cook from the DC suburbs: I think it's critical to reduce the sauce separately from the meat (and longer than 40 minutes) to mellow the alcohol flavor.

Rating: 2
Found several problems with this recipe. One hr.20 min. was not long enough cooking time - neither beef nor carrots(!) tender. Cooked an extra hour the next night (without a lid)& they were OK. Therefore, did not reduce the liquid separately, as it was already reduced. Flavor was harsh, almost acidic, and it wasn't the Pinot Noir's fault, as we drank it with the meal and it was fine. Will have the leftovers tomorrow night, but can't believe it will be that much better. Any suggestions?

Rating: 4
I've made this dish six times now and it is a fabulous dinner party recipe. If you reduce the liquid even more, it's not too "runny" and serves beautifully as an entree. I serve it with herbed roasted potatoes and fresh asparagus. It's always been a huge hit. (Make sure you have really crusty french bread and a great Cabernet Sauvignon to top it off!)

Rating: 2
Excellent flavor and I got rave reviews from my guests and also no leftovers. Unfortunately, the meat was dry, even with a very expensive cut I used. I have experienced this before with cooking meat for so long in wine. Much too much work for the end result. I cook a great deal and there are other recipes that are not so time consuming and yet flavorful. I will not be making this again.

Rating: 4
Excellent and well-received, but a little time consuming. I would defintely do it again and strongly recommend making it in advance and reheating it on serving day. I served it with homemade egg noodles and there was universal acclaim! The only thing I would do differently would be to either reduce the sauce quite a bit longer or add a thickener (such as a roux or cornstarch). It could have been a little thicker, but the taste was terrific! I was really surprised that the two full bottles of wine were not at all excessive...it wasn't boozy tasting at all...just nice and rich and fragrant. A winner and a new addition to my recipe favorites.

I've used this recipe several times and it's gotten rave reviews each time, and has become our family's Christmas or New Year's dinner of choice. No other recipe I've seen uses as much wine, and I think this makes the difference. Venison is perfect for this dish--its more robust flavor doesn't get lost in the wine. As to the bacon, I usually sprinkle it on just before serving.

Rating: 2
Can this be made with VENISON? please advise. Also, I read very few recipes that call for marinating the meat overnight before browning. Would it be worth it to do so, especially with venison??? Thanks

Still in the menu-planning stage and I note that none of the reviewers served this delicious sounding ragout on garlic whipped potatoes. Has anyone tried this? I can't see why it wouldn't work . . . . just wondering

Used an inexpensive Pinot Noir (thanks Gracie and Toronto). Used the leftover bacon for the salad course and a better cut of beef. Only suggestion is to make well ahead of time. This was absolutely fantabulous and I'll make it again and again.

I made this for my adult children,etc. last night for dinner and it was a hit. I used 4# of chuck and frozen pearl onion (so I didn't have to peel them) otherwise I followed the recipe. I also didn't know what to do with the bacon so I used it in a mixed green salad. In general, I think the recipe needs more spice/flavor, it needsed more 'depth' of flavor. There is another recipe (Boeuf Bourguignon) Gourmet 3/2001 that is rated equally as high and has more spices that I will try next time.

Excellent! I doubled it for a large party and everyone loved it and many had seconds. I did not skimp on any ingredient (used 4 bottles of Inniskillin Pinot Noir, 24 cloves of garlic etc ).I cooked it in the oven in a huge (12 litre/quart) turkey roaster for two hours on a Wednesday, then it sat in the fridge until Friday when I reduced the sauce, transfered to my smaller 9 litre(quart) roaster and then reheated on Saturday night to serve. Note: To cook it in my huge turkey roaster I still had to reduce the remaining wine/broth/thyme/sugar/tomatopaste combination first before it fit. A lot of work but very worth it. I would absolutely make this again. It can just sit in the oven or on top of the stove until you are ready to serve. Delicious!

This recipe is wonderful. I used two bottles of inexpensive Pinot Noir and it worked well. I served it with mushroom risotto, which was good. I would also consider serving it with wide egg noodles or plain rice, since the sauce is very flavorful. It made my house smell like a French kitchen. Yum.

Made for large group and it was very well liked. Used two bottles of Pinot Noir and added 1/4 bottle of burgandy when I reheated the second day. Completely skipped on the beef broth. Great make ahead meal...

This recipe was awesome! I had to only give it 3 forks, however, because of the time involved to make it. Very time-consuming, but worth it! I did only used one bottle of wine, and then used it's equivalent of water and left out the Cognac altogether. I also used baby carrots to save some prep time, and they were excellent.

Definitely make day ahead. Right after cooking I thought the sauce was too sharp. Mellowed over time.

Not only does this taste bad, it is dangerous to fix. The pan actually caught fire at one point! I made this recipe for company, and it was so bad that we ordered pizza. The tomato paste and the alcohol are just a BAD idea...live and learn...NEVER AGAIN!

Okay...I must finally admit it. I cook for a living. I am a caterer and private chef, and I have been using this Beef Bourginone recipe for years..making little adjustments here and there but nothing major (lots of black pepper; applewood smoked bacon; more tomato paste, fewer mushrooms...). I ALWAYS pass it off as my own and my clients rave over it! It is easy, easy, easy and too fabulous! Served over egg noodles with a salad of bitter greens, you can't do better!!

I have served this recipe maybe 30 times since it was published in 1994. It is a favorite of my husband's and a great crowd pleaser. Served with a salad, lots of sour dough bread, a cabernet or zinfandel and you can't go wrong. And as with many "pot style" recipes, the second, third or fourth days are even better, if it lasts that long. I usually make extra.

This is one of the very few recipes I have given a full four forks on epicurious. This recipe produces a rich and slightly sweet beef/wine glazed stew of carrots, onions, and beef. I served simple mashed potatoes with it and would recommend doing the same to balance out the richness of the sauce. While it is not a quick recipe, most of the work is completed an hour before dinner is served, or it could certainly be done a day ahead of time. I halved the recipe and followed the directions exactly with absolutely wonderful reuslts. I used an inexpensive Burgundy but I think next time I will follow the other reviewers' suggestions and use a respectable Pinot Noir. This recipe is good for guests and GREAT for a big dinner party.

I made this over the weekend, and it was wonderful. My boyfriend absolutely loved it. Because he is a little picky, I omitted the carrots, but that is all. I also did not have a dutch oven, so I adjusted the temp accordingly on the stove. It turned out perfect, with plenty of left-overs, making the recipe to serve 4, instead of 8. It was great reheated. I give this high marks!

Elegant dinner party dish over mashed potatos, with salad. Absolutely deliciou, and the smell alone was worth the effort (it's actually a deceptively simple recipe -- the hardest part was peeling the little pearl onions!). I throw a fair number of dinner parties, but never before has every single guest gone back for generous seconds. My only question: Does everyone really use 2 bottles of wine? I used just one and that seemed like enough. I would definitely make this again!

I made this in a large crock pot and thought I had died and went to heaven. I did not use the bacon. I did not have any beef boullion so I used chicken boullion. Since I cooked it in the crock pot instead of the oven, I only used one bottle of burgundy wine. Other than these changes, I followed the recipe to the "T". It was sooooooo good & it made me look great.

At the suggestion of Bill from Scotts Valley, CA, I added Minor's beef base(1 800 243 8822) to the beef broth and it created a wonderful and rich beef flavor. Also, I used good Pinot Noir, actually David Bruce and it really enhanced the flavor. The first time I used an less expensive wine and you can really taste the difference

This was wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. A lot of preparation, but the best I've tasted. Made it for a New Year's party and it was a tremendous hit. Agree with others on using a good Pinot Noir and Brandy for best taste. Combined with herb roasted potatoes and roasted asparagus, this meal is the best!

I served this with egg noodles and a loaf of good italian bread. Delicious. Good wine and cognac really add to the flavor. The leftovers have been wonderful too. The only problem is that there was more liquid than I had room for in my Dutch Oven. Use a very big pot if you are going to make this recipe.

I cooked this recipe for a dinner party of 28. I cooked in three batches the day before and reheated for serving. The sauce had a wonderful flavor - I think the cognac was the big key. I followed another reader's advice and used a good Pinot Noir for the red wine. My only shortcut was to use canned onions rinsed multiple times. You could not tell in the finished product. I served it with savory mashed potatoes to make plating easy, and steamed broccoli for the deep green color.

Outstanding!!! The wine & cognac make a really exceptional sauce. Flavor improves dramatically if it is made the day before. I served over homemade fettucine. Perfect! Recipe says 8 servings but guests will definitely want seconds so plan accordingly.

Made this dish for a dinner party - and, it was a big hit! Served with new potatoes w/parsley. This is a great recipe to use if you're not sure exactly what time you are going to sit down for dinner. The longer the sauce boiled the thicker it got. So, you can keep the beef in the oven warmer and just keep the broth boiling on low - until you're ready to serve. Magnifico!

I tried this recipe just because there was such a split opinion on it. Wow. It's terrific, and comes the closest I've experienced to tasting like the real French thing. It's the best I've had outside France. I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.

I thought this dish was time-consuming to make and not very good tasting. There is way too much wine in it for my taste. I would rather try a similar recipe with 1/2 the amount of alcohol in it. I don't recommend this recipe. Disappointing.

I must have been doing something wrong, but I just didn't get this recipe. What do you do with the bacon after you fry it up? (I returned it to the dish at the end). Also, it took me MUCH longer than the suggested time in the recipe to saute everything to get it to the stage it was supposed to get. Finally, are you REALLY supposed to use 2 bottles of wine??? I have the largest dutch oven LeCreuset makes, and after I put everything in only 1 bottle of wine fit. It came out tasting great, but I modified the recipe so much, I'm not sure WHAT I was following by the end! A final note: burgundy wine in the US is sold as Pinot Noir (from the French burgundy grape grown here). More expensive than the cheeper "burgundies" sold in larger flasks, but pinot noir is the "real deal" and worth the expense.

This take on a French classic is as good as Julia's. We followed it exactly and never lamented the quantity of wine or anything else. I blanched the bacon first, since I use a cob-smoked brand.

Excellent recipe, my guests enjoyed it. It is a really good dish to make ahead of time. I don't suggest cutting back on the wine or the broth. Unless you are pressed for time, I favor removing and reducing the liquid, this step helps make the dish stand out. I doubled the recipe, which in retrospect I should have not done (it really serves ten, with a side dish) and used the money I saved and invested it a better quality wine.

I thought the flavors were excellent and it melded well together. We have made this meal twice; once with an inexpensive brandy, once with a good brandy and it was significantly better with the better liqueur. Also, we garnished with a mild goat cheese and it was phenomenal!

Nobody hated it, but since I have been making hundreds of recipes from this site over the past several years, they did not find it comparable to other dishes that are contained herein.

Awesome!!! Extremely rich, but heavenly. Unlike most other reviewers, I did not find this recipe that labor-intensive. I made it in stages, and, by the time I was done, I found it did not need to be reduced. I also omitted the mushrooms, since I'm not a big mushie fan. To cook in stages -- follow recipe through the stage of adding the wine, thyme, sugar, etc. Bring to a boil. Now, I refrigerated it a few days. When I was ready to cook it, I defatted it (very easy), brought it to a boil again, transferred it to a Dutch oven (if it isn't in one already), then baked it as directed. The sauce was already pretty well-reduced. YUMMY!!!

There was just enough sauce this way and it saved me some time. A bonus: our house smelled great the whole day!
