It was fine for quick and easy, but I found it to be quite plain despite having marinated the meat for hours. I would consider making this again but altering the recipe a bit.

I followed the directions precisely and it was an absolute disaster.

Definitely a good easy recipe but I'd double the marinade when making again. I had only five cutlets and the amount of marinade called for was barely enough. Also, I only marinated for an hour and that was plenty. I had to add some cornstarch to thicken the sauce, but it was tasty and flavorful in the end.

I used thyme and sage as that is what I hsd in the garden. Loved it just the way it was. My 6 & 7 year olds gobbled it up. Hooray!

Hmmm, the title of the recipe says "cutlets" but the ingredients list says "chops." Which should it be?

Really easy and fast. Good week-night recipe; pork marinates while salad and side dishes are prepared. Fresh thyme mixed with fresh lemon thyme adds slightly to the lemony flavor. Does not make a lot of sauce -- just enough to coat the pork on the plate.

The flavor of this sauce is AMAZING! It is a nice alternative to the usual lemon garlic white wine sauce. Using regular milk in this recipe just didn't sound right to me so I replaced it with premium organic coconut milk and it adds a hint of pizzaz to it. I followed the recipes directions on how to sear the chops 1 minute each side then boil in milk 1 minute. So not enough time! then I ended up slightly over cooking the chops, will work on getting the right cooking time and temp. Overall love it, and look forward to using it again. Oh! and i ate it over jasmin wild rice. YUM!

I agree with others, the recipe is great if you add some white wine and more milk. I only used 4 pork chops but did not alter the rest of the recipe and it turned out great. FYI when you first add the wine and milk in the sauce thickens, add in the pork again and put a lid on the pan. The moister from the steam will turn the thickened sauce into a nice thinner sauce.

I dredged the chops in the flour, deglazed the pan after with white wine and added a small dab of butter to the sauce per the suggestions here. This was not a hit with the family at all and everything about this recipe seemed like it was right up our alley. Halfway through I gave up on the sauce, put the chops in the oven and made a light capers and butter sauce to finish the meal out. The new sauce was the best part. We probably won't make this again.

Great flavors. Thought the flour made it a little "pasty/gooey" though. Will try again and see if I can tighten it up.

Yummy! I'd put a little less lemon next time, add the white wine as suggested and capers and spinach would be perfect. It's light, tasty, fresh and extremely easy to make yet looks sophisticated! I'd make it again soon!

Thank you fellow reviewers for your tips on adding white wine and capers. As suggested, I served it with sauteed spinach and rice pilaf. This was very easy and a hit with the fam! Only problem, I made enough for a lot of leftovers... there was not a single bite of anything left.

I just wish I had some capers to go aong with this!

I added a little Puerto Rican/chuleta flair by increasing the garlic and adding a bit of Sazon. I only had time to marinate for 30 minutes and it still came out fine. And yes, we do like to suck on lemons and garlic at the same time! LOL

I added a bunch of fresh spinach at the end as the milk boiled to make a complete meal out of this dish. The wilted yet vibrant green spinach looked (and tasted) great with the pork.

Loved this dish! I definately used suggestions from others. When I took the pork out from the pan, I added the butter and flour (tablespoon of each) and made a roux. After the roux was ready, I added 1/2 cup white wine and 1/4 cup milk (I am not a fan of milk). After I had the sauce going, I added pork and covered. I cooked it about 10 min on med. high heat. It was perfect over white rice. The sauce was delish.

I thought this was so simple and delicious. My husband & I love to cook, but try to find low fat recipes - this one was excellent! I also added more thyme and a little white wine to the milk as suggested by another - and it was perfect!

I added white wine and more thyme to the milk before placing the pork back in the saute pan. My cutlets were a bit thick, so I left the pork in the covered pan to cook for 20 minutes, as opposed to a couple minutes. Delicious!

This was so easy to make - I prepraed the marinade before I went to work and came home and cooked it up quickly. It was a great meal with no effort. It had great flavor. This will be a staple!

Within a few minutes this deteriorated into a mush of wallpaper paste, lemon, and garlic. The texture of the meat both externally and internally was unappealling to say the least. Regarding flavor - fine if you like to chew garlic and suck on lemons at the same time. Luckily, we had left-over pizza from the night before. There is absolutely no way I will make this meal again.

This recipes surprised me. I was a bitt nervous that the cutlets would need more cooking but marinating in the lemon juice did some of the job. So everything was just right, tender meat, light delicious sauce and served with rice and tomato and cucumber salad, this is definitively a repeater.

I didn't like the gummy texture of the pork and it seemed like it didn't cook with a nice white center like I'm used to. Maybe I need to practice this recipe again but I'm not so sure it's that good.

Really good. I thought the lemon might be an overwhelming flavor, but it enhanced the pork very nicely. The milk cooked down to a light, delicous sauce. Will definitely make again.

Very easy to make. For the sauce, I mixed 1 part chicken stock to 1 part milk, and whisked in a tablespoon of butter at the end with the lemon and the result was a richer, thicker sauce.

I have made this recipe several times, and usually just as directed. However, sometimes I make it without taking the time to marinate at all, and we still love it. It's definitely for lemon lovers only! I agree with the other cook who said to give them a good searing; that'll give you a nice brown rich-looking sauce.

I made this with the juice of one lemon (approx. 5 tbsps.), dried thyme, and since I don't have a garlic press, I minced the cloves and the crushed them in a bowl with the back of a teaspoon. I used all the lemon juice except for 1 tbsp that I reserved for the sauce. It was not too lemony, and the flavors had a great balance. I had to use about 1.5 the amount of marinade to cover the 4 chops. It was very flavorful and I got no complaints from my family who ate it. I will deffinately make this again.

This was a big hit with teen son and husband. I substituted flat champagne for the milk and then added an additional 1/2 cup red wine (Italian-Umbria) to thin the sauce. Also, I combined fresh rosemary with the thyme, so it was a heartier dish than it would have been with milk. Very delicious!

I made this for the first time and it was absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe except after I seared the pork chops I deglazed the pan with white wine. I also added a small amount of flour to the sauce to help thicken it abit. Very good and easy, definitely a keeper for a week night meal.

The dish was easy to make and came out yummy. I always laugh at people who don't particularly like an ingredient, make a dish with that ingredient in it, and then complain about it. Don't like lemon very much? Here's an idea, don't make things with lemon in it topped with a lemon sauce!

I tried lime juice instead of lemon and it worked out well. I also added some real maple syrup which cut down on the acidity. I thought that the sauce was a bit thin, but next time I will try it with more flour.

I'd give this 2.5 if I could. We found the pork to be tasty and tender, with about the right amount of flavour. The sauce however... too much lemon! I won't add the extra at the end next time. There will be a next time, as it is quick, easy, reasonably healthful and my bf likes 'lumps of meat' type meals.

As my husband put it: "I like my pork to taste like pork". I agree. Based on other comments, I increased the lemon - big mistake. The lemon totally overpowered the flavour of the meat. If I make this again, I will cut way back on the lemon and see if that helps it. For first timers, my advice is to use caution with the lemon and remember, more is not always better.

This dish had a nice lemony flavor and was easy to make, but the sauce did not look appealing. I will try it again though; maybe some chopped parsley would help make it look more appetizing!

I, too, used extra flour when making the sauce, which thickened it nicely. I thought the flavor was delicious and the recipe is surprisingly healthy for such a rich taste!

Simple and good. I used the same amount of ingredients on 4 chops and included some lemon pulp in the marinade, and refrigerated them for 2hrs. I dredged the chops in flour and seared them, then I removed them and using a little more flour made a roux, then added the milk for the sauce, and then added the chops and brought to a boil. This worked well, I found that with the extra marinade really upped the flavor.

I made this last night, and was not impressed. The meat didn't have much flavor, and I marinated it all day. The meal was saved by Rice Pilaf with Peas and Pine Nuts (Bon Appetit, Dec. 1991). I won't make this one again.

This was a healthy, time saving recipe for me. I didn't have any thyme and substituted summer savory and it still turned out pretty well. Next, I will experiment with other herbs maybe add some white wine...The sauce was great.

I followed the directions and let it marinate for approximately four hours. Perhaps I should have had it marinating for the whole day. My family did not like to very much and I will not do it again.

Simple, and as a result, surprisingly good. We'll do it with chicken, too. At the end, with the sauce in the pan, we stirred in some steamed vegetables before servings. This'll be a regular one -- if I remember the recipe!

Delightful ! The grated lemon peel is an ingeneous way to bring out the full flavor of the fresh thyme and pork. This was the star of our dinner party.

My husband loved this dish, it was just alright to me, but I will make it again only cause it is so easy and requires ingredients that are usually on hand at any given moment.

Great way to serve pork! I made it twice in one week. The sauce is very flavorful, though a bit too lemony - I added more thyme toward the end, rather than adding lemon juice with the milk, and cooked a little longer to reduce to a thicker consistency. The browner the meat when you first sear it, the deeper color the sauce.
