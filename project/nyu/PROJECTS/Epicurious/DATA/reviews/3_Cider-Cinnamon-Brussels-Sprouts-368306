Really loved this dish. It was so simple and healthy, and it had a lot of flavor. It was an awesome addition to my Thanksgiving dinner, which was full of carbs and very unhealthy dishes. I used only pears because that's what I had and it was delicious. Keep an eye on the cooking time to make sure you get the right textures  the fruit gets soft so you want to make sure the Brussels sprouts maintain a nice texture for the right balance. Great dish! Perfect for Thanksgiving.

I love brussel sprouts but my dinner partner hates them. I got him to eat a couple using this receipe. The apples, pears and cider 'soften' the bitterness of the sprouts. I prefer my sprouts plain but this was a good compromise receipe. I do recommend less cider and only cook until tender -- not mushy!

Amazing dish! Great way to introduce Brussels sprouts to newbies. Yes, maybe less cider; other than that. It was a hit!!!

I gave this an okay rating because of how it ended up looking. It tasted pretty good but it just killed me when I put those vibrant green brussels into the pot and by the time the liquid was absorbed what I had left was an ugly grey mess. If I did it again I would use less cider and probably not simmer as long.

I can't yet rate, but this sounds interesting, I had a recent amazing dish that added a tiny bit of cinnamon to roasted brussel sprouts... so I will try!
