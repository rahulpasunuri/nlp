I've been making this recipe as written for several years. The hoisin sauce gives it a nice depth of flavor. I serve it over mashed potatoes..delicious! I wouldn't change a thing, no tweeking needed.

Yummy...the hoisin sauce is a nice touch. It's a little sweet, but nothing crazy. I ended up with the onions mixed in with the beef and can't imagine that it made much of a difference. Served over mashed potatoes and it was delicious.

I wish I had read more reviews beforehand, I thought it was a little too sweet like many others so if I make it again I'll cut down the hoisin. I made horseradish mashed potatoes with it and I think it helped balance that out a bit. We simmered 30 minutes longer before adding the carrots and the meat was very tender.

Before adding the 2nd cup of red wine I did not care for the taste of this stew - but the additional red wine and simmering time mellowed the flavors and it came together nicely. I'd make this again. I made it as written with two exceptions - I cooked the onions separately, and I added some potatoes. Otherwise, the times worked out and the ingredients pulled together and I ended up with good comfort food.

Good recipe. The beef was tender and the carrots were a nice touch.

Hoisin sauce has 1000mg sodium per 1 or 2 tablespoons so I only used 2 tablespoons.Also added 1 chopped large diakon. At the end I added 1 cup thawed peas and 1 pound sliced/cooked mushrooms. Other additions were 2 chopped cloves garlic at the end of the onion cooking and 1 tablespoon tomato paste. Will make this again.

This stew is really tasty, but takes a long time to get the beef tender enough. I think daikon or turnip would be good with the carrots too. We served it over fresh pappardelle pasta, and everyone loved it!

As suggested by a previous reviewer, I did a slow cooker version. I used all the hoisin sauce, drained the tomatoes before putting them in the slow cooked, and cut the red wine by one third. I also dredged the beef in flour before browning it. Eight hours on low overnight. What an amazing aroma to wake up to! Results were wonderful. Plenty of liquid, and dredging the beef in flour made the gravy thicker, which I prefer. Hoisin really makes the recipe special and different, without being overwhelming or too sweet. My guests LOVED it.

This is my favorite "go-to", crowd pleasing recipe that has never let me down. I have used it since it first appeared in Bon Appetite so many times I have lost count. It has gotten to the point that I actually have extra copies of the recipe available to hand out, my guests love it so much. My family always asks for it when we are together for Christmas Eve. The magazine also included a wonderful recipe for garlic mashed potatoes with horseradish that goes perfectly. Track that recipe down. I have doubled and even tripled the recipe and have never had any problems with consistency. The beef is always tender and there is such a richness in the gravy/broth from the Hoisin sauce I wish I had some for dinner tonight as we in the middle of a snow storm and it would be just the right comfort food. I make it the day before so to enhance the flavors plus to free me up in the kitchen the night of the event.

This is a delicious recipe. I never would have thought of hoisin and red wine in a stew like this. Used the recommendations of drenching the beef in flour, and added carrots, parsnips, potatoes and garlic. I would like smaller, more tender portions of beef next time but it was still nice. Fresh thyme added to plain tomatoes added a lot of flavor.

I've made this stew numerous times over the last few years and while each time it's different, it's always fantastic! I've always doubled the diced tomato and I dredge the beef in seasoned flour before searing. Other great additions are mushrooms, celery, and parsnips and potatoes.

I took the suggestion of sauteing the onions beforehand - great suggestion! I saw other reviews warning that this recipe is sweet, and they were right. But it's sweet in the best possible way. If you are worried about sweetness pick a less sweet wine - a dry malbec perhaps. The flavors I found to be very rich and complex. One bowl will definitely fill you up. I served with biscuits, delicious.

Rating: 3
Yum! I made this for a friend who just had a baby. Followed the advice to saute the onions before the beef. Glad I did. The stew turned out rich and hearty, and not to sweet. I just used Lee Kum Kee hoisin, nothing fancy. I couldn't find tomatoes with Italian herbs, so I added 1/4 teaspoon each of dried basil, oregano and thyme. Like many did, I threw in some sliced mushrooms with the carrots, which turned out to be a great addition.

Rating: 0
Really really important to saute the onions FIRST! If you brown the meat, too much liquid seeps out and doesn't allow the onions to caramelize to a rich golden brown where all the flavor is found. This accomplished, the rest of the dish is very tasty and a real family pleaser.

If there were a five fork rating, I would give it five forks. I have been making this for several years and it is always a hit. I make it for my husband and me, for dinner parties, whatever. The hoisin sauce and wine are just so delicious. The only question I have is who has a pan big enough to cook 3.5 lbs of beef, then push it all to the side and cook several cups of onion in the center? I always have to use two pans to cook the beef.

Rating: 3
Made this again for the first time in a few years - still delicious! I made a couple of changes using frozen pearl onions, browning them after the meat. I also threw in about 4 parsnips cut on the diagonal like the carrots. I mixed 3 T. quick tapioca into the stew, covered it and roasted in the oven for 2 hrs. Right before the 2 hrs was up I sauteed fresh quartered mushrooms and chopped up about 2/3 cup Italian parsley and mixed these in before serving. On top of couscous it went and was great! The Hoisin really adds a unique taste.

Since making this stew for the first time 4 years ago we have not made a different recipe - it is just that good. We cut the hoisen sauce at least in half. We use a pound of carrots as well as a pound of parsnips and a pound of potatoes. We do not add the corn starch as the potatoes provide starch to thicken the broth. We love this recipe. It is the perfect meal on a cold night!

WOW!!! This was amazing!! Even w/ the unfortunate substitution of celery for the onions (my boyfriend won't eat onions but he doesn't mind onion powder so I added that & the celery. WHO doesn't love onions? They are a critical ingredient & I'm even embarassed to write the words "onion powder"). I also added an 8oz package of sliced baby bellas. I never would have thought to marry the flavors of hoisin w/ italian seasoned tomatoes. Just incredible!!!

I love this recipe. It's in permanent winter rotation. Despite the small number of ingredients, the flavor is rich and complex. I find the portions are large for 4, so the leftovers come in handy. I shred the beef, chop the carrots and add all this and leftover sauce to tomato sauce I have on hand for a quick beef ragu. So good.

This was a wonderful recipe. Easy to do and fool-proof. My husband adored it. I'm not sure what some reviewers were talking about in terms of cooking time. I made it exactly as the recipe said, and the meat came out perfectly tender. Perhaps they didn't read it carefully; there are a lot of steps. If I were going to add something, I might put in some green beans along with the carrots, to enhance the vegetable meal-in-a-pot quality of the dish.

Terrific stew - and I'm not usually a fan of beef stew. I made a number of alterations to the basic recipe. First, I'm not a big fan of onions, so I cut the onion volume in half. I added about a pound of chopped mushrooms and a lot of garlic (we love garlic): about 4 tablespoons of chopped garlic in oil (milder than fresh cloves - would have used 3 medium gloves). I sauteed the beef first, added it to the slow cooker, and then sauteed the mushrooms, onions and garlic together and added them to the slow cooker. I reduced the liquid a little (because I was making it in a slow cooker) by pouring off some of the liquid in the canned tomatoes and cutting the wine to about 1 cup. The second time I made the recipe, I also added about half a teaspoon of chili flakes. About an hour before it was finished cooking in the slow cooker (8.5 hours at Low), I added a roughly chopped medium bulb of fennel as well as the carrots, because we prefer vegetables to be crisp-tender.

Delicious, hearty stew. Cooked onions in separate saute pan and more than doubled the slow cooking time. Mushrooms a great addition. Also added one cup of beef stock for even richer flavor. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys rich, hearty, fork-tender beef stews.

I thought this was a very good recipe. My husband and I liked it. Easy to make. I'd try this in a slow cooker too. I added 2 cloves of garlic, used 3 med. onions and used about 1 1/2 cups of wine. You definitely don't need the corn starch. Next time I would add the carrots earlier since they always take a long time to cook. I added 3 Yukon gold potatoes cut into small pieces. I would make this again.

A real keeper. I like to add things all the time . So this time, I had roasted peppers in the frrezer from last summer that i roasted on the grill . I cut up a half a cup and let the sweet flavor mix or marry as they say in the stew juices. At almost the end, I added some beef broth and a few small cans of mushrooms and a few cans of potatoes to make it enough for some unexpected guests. I bought a rustic loaf of round italian bread and man they loved it.

Great recipe, a few simple ingredients, no fancy equipment or handling required. Great as left overs too. I reduced the amount of Hoisin in the second batch a little to make it less sweet.

my local greengrocer has onions already prepared, so I can throw this together very quickly. It tastes as if it takes days to put together. Even the most discriminating guests love it, so it's become a staple at my house. If I don't have a Cab already opened, it seems to work well with Malbec, too. Better the next day.

This is always a huge hit. I've made this many times with various modifications. Crock pot is best; slow cooking is key. You'll still need to sear the meat & spices-- the stew will have better depth. The secret is the hoisin! And course it tastes even better the next day.

One of the more delicious beef stews I've made in a while. After reading some of the previous reviews, I was a little worried about sweetness, but I didn't find it too sweet at all - the hoisin was very subtle. I added a pound of button mushrooms and a little chicken broth to increase the liquid accordingly. I agree with recommendations to let it cook 30-45 min. longer than the recipe calls for. I would not omit the cornstarch. Served over egg noodles...perfect.

This recipe is one of my all time favorites from Epicurious. I have passed it on to more than twenty people at their request. Depending on the thickness of the stew at the end, I have often skipped the cornstarch altogether. Serving this over mashed potatoes, (it's fabulous over roasted garlic or horseradish variations) with a side salad is perfect casual winter dinner fare!

I added mushrooms (baby bella and shitake) and yukon gold potatoes. I would definitely add the mushrooms again but not the potatoes necessarily. I loved the flavor, but I thought the meat was a little tough or maybe dry, but then, I've never cooked a stew before, so it could be either me or my expectations. I used 2.5 lbs of meat since I was adding mushrooms and potatoes and it made 8 servings for me. I thought the liquid got almost too thick, in the sense that there was nothing left, so next time I wouldn't use the corn starch. I didn't think it was too sweet, but then, I love things sweet. I added the carrots at the beginning because I don't like crunchy vegetables in cooked dishes. I used baby carrots and left them whole. I used less onion add added garlic. It reheats very well, which is important to me, since I live alone. Unfortunately, when you reheat it, the sauce is even less. Luckily, I didn't try to serve it over pasta, just ate it as a one dish meal.

This beef stew was fabulous. Even my husband liked it and he normally hates beef stew. We didnt think it was overly sweet as others had commented. I did add about 3 medium sized russet potatoes peeled and diced when the carrots were added. I cooked everything in one pot, the onions never did get golden but the stew was still delicious. Cant wait to make this when we have company.

This was an awesome stew. I took the suggestions of others and added potatoes. Also, I browned the beef in batches to ensure it was browned, not boiled in it's own liquid and got that nice fond in the pan to boot. I did the onions in another pan while browning the beef, so that shortened up the time till everything came together to simmer. The depth of flavors was the resounding comment. I used the hoisin per the recipe and did not find it too sweet.

Rating: 4
This is my regular stew recipe, it's terrific. It's one of the few beef dishes i make. I sautee the onions in a separate pan because the beef produces too much liquid and it's impossible to add oil and sautee the onion in it. I also add potatoes - with just the carrots it's too plain. Other veggies would be good too. I don't find it too sweet at all as some of the reviewers have said, and I just use standard grocery store hoison. I also let it simmer about 45 minute to an hour longer than it says in order to get the beef really tender. I serve plain, over egg noodles, and have been meaning to try it over mashed potatoes, too.

This is an extremely easy and flavorful stew. I have made this several times, once for a large group of 60 and more than a few commented that it was the best stew they had ever had.

I really liked the recipe. I did a slow-cooker recipe version. I would make some tweaks to it. I'd add less liquid. Cut the wine to 1/2 cup red wine, add a drop of worchestire sauce. Add garlic and more spices. Leftovers were definitely more flavorful.

Made this for the carnivores in my household following shscharles' suggestions. Came out good; nice variation on beef stew.

Next time I'll add the mushrooms toward the end of cooking.

After reading the reviews I made the following changes: Added 2 cloves garlic when cooking the onions, Used 1 cup Cab, 1/2 cup hearty beef broth (tinned), a pinch of 5 Spice Powder and 1/4 tsp chopped chile flakes.

This was outstanding. Very good looking as well as very tasty. I did substitute beef broth for half of the wine. I didn't want to add the cornflour, but even after gently simmering it for quite some time, it ended up needing the thickener.

Nice variation on burgundy beef. I made with exactly ingredients called for using plain ol' Dynasty Hoisin Sauce. It wasn't too sweet. I'd look to the onions. The more they caramelize, the sweeter they are. You can cook them down till they're marmalade but I don't think you want that here. I only mildly browned them, so I think that must help. After browning beef and onions, I cooked it in a Dutch oven at 350' for about 2 hours total, and the beef was nicely tender.

I am relatively new to the world of cooking. As both a college student and an Information Technology employee, most of the time it's easier to pick up something to go. So, this was a first for me. I've already manage to make one other recipe from Epicurious (Ricotta Cheescake -- Gourmet, 1999) and so this was a welcome experiment. || Some key changes that I made were the substitution of a Chianti (2002, Gabbiano) for Cabernet Sauvingnon, the usage of a huge (1.6 lb?!) red onion, and the additional use of 2 tbs First Cold Press Extra Virgin Olive Oil during the brazing step -- the meat kept sticking to the pan. || The stew is sweeter than I was expecting, perhaps due to the bay leaves or perhaps the Chianti. || Overall, an excellent recipe!

I have made this receipe a number of times and have been very true to the receipe. However I have just departed from the text!!

i made very minor changes too, according to the reviews below. changed 2 cups wine to 1 cup wine + 1 cup beef stock (i was worried about the too-winey complaints) and omitted the cornflour. i didn't need to salt the stew or thicken it with cornflour at all, by the end-cooking time the sauce was a glossy deep brown color, thick and very delicious! i stirred about 3 tablespoons parsley into the stew for additional texture. the meat was not as tender as i liked, though - i think an additoinal 1/2 hour simmer would benefit the stew before adding the carrots in. i actually can't wait to eat some of it again tonight!

This was wonderful without any major changes. After all the holiday meals, it was great to come home and make comfort food. Unlike others, I did not flour the meat before browning, and the stew was still thick enough. I couldn't find hoisin with a lower sugar content, so just cut back on the amount called for, and it was not too sweet. Served over garlic smashed potatoes and licked our plates. Happy New Year and happy cooking in 2007!

this is more of a stew in that it is thick enough to serve over mashed potatoes and it is best this way! use extra hoisin sauce and don't cut down on the wine. I don't usually need to use the cornstarch but it depends on the amount of water in the meat and other things as I have made this recipe at least 15 times. the flavor is complex and the presentation is rich and beautiful. if it's too sweet you may consider trying a different brand of hoisin sauce.

This 3rd time that I made it was too sweet (my bad for not reducing the hoisin) - so I added water and Droste unsweetened chocolate. Wow!

Check your Hoisin sauce! Lee Kum Kee brand has sugar as the first ingredient (10g sugar per TBS!); it's a black syrupy, tasteless sludge. Whole Foods brand has soy sauce as the first ingredient, 3g sugar per TBS, and has tons of complex flavors. I suspect that explains some of the radically different results....

This was very good, thanks to all the great feedback from everyone. I was concerned it would be overly sweet, so I reduced the hoisin to about 1/4 cup. I used a 28 ounce can of good tomatoes, I substituted some beef broth for about half of the last installment of red wine, I added a bit of flour when browning the meat, and when the carrots went in, I also added some white creamer potatoes and mushrooms. It was just great. There was a depth of flavor from the hoisin without the whole thing being too sweet. Great over noodles.

I got the "this was so worth waiting for" when I served this meal to my husband! And wait you do, it takes a while to prepare, but the more times I make it, the more streamlined the process is becoming. The dish works great with a strong merlot instead of the cab sav.

Yummy! A few modifications: - Sautee the onions in a seperate pan from the beef as the beef will already release juices, making it impossible to brown the onions. - Any red wine works.

Bravo, brilliant, best beef stew I've ever tried! Followed advice of others, and used 1 cup good beef stock and 1 cup red wine, added mushrooms, and 2 heaping Tbsp. of hoisin (used Lee Kum Kee.) The hoisin adds remarkable depth, just take it slow if you aren't sure, you can always taste & add more. Also used sirloin steak as the meat, and shook a little Wondra flour on as I browned it. Not sure I'd tinker with it any further, although my son missed having potatoes in it. Served the leftovers over fresh biscuits... serious comfort food.

A really good stew. Here's what I changed - I dredged meat in flour and browned, (to thicken,instead of cornstarch), added garlic and mushrooms, omitted carrots, and added a little extra tomatoes to cut the sweetness of the hoisin. Super yummy with roasted garlic mashed potatoes.

Waaaay too sweet. Tried (in different test bowls) to decrease sweetness with extra salt, W/shire sauce, vinegar, soy sauce - to no avail.

Rating: 4
Unbelievable flavor! I did add minced garlic with the onions and substituted chopped red peppers for the carrots. Make sure to use a decent Cabernet because the wine flavor really comes through. Hoisen sauce is an absolute must; I added extra sauce to the stew. One of our absolute favorite recipies.

We're making this stew for the second time. It was so great the first time! My boyfriend is doing most of the cooking and prep work this time since he loved it so much! We're going to add mushrooms this time and garlic. The renters upstairs are very jealous... we'll invite them down, reluctantly ,and share.

I thought that this recipe was delicous! I did tweek it a little however. I added red skin potatoes and I put only half the cabernet, so it wouldn't be so rich. The portions were a little off. Even after adding the potatoes it only came out to just barely 5 portions in 3 cup bowls. However it was still a big hit and I will definetly make this again.

Wonderful! Browned the meat with a little flour, but followed the recipe entirely. Only difference I made was to top it with a delicious flaky crust!! What a treat - my family raved.

Great everytime! Ditch the cornstarch and add potatos with the carrots--thickens right up! Also, I added 3 cloves minced garlic to the onions at the very end of sauting. Delicious also with a cup of homemade beef stock. Oiy.

This is such a rich and hearty stew. I added extra broth and more wine and cooked the meat for a longer amt. of time as it was a bit tough. Leftovers were better yet!

I've made this before and everyone has enjoyed it. But..... I promised myself that the next time I would use 1 cup red wine/1 cup beef broth and cut back on the hoisin. I'd rather have the molten mousse thing from this site for dessert than all that hoisin sauce.

This was delicious. Used london broil since it was on sale at the market. Might just throw chopped potatoes in the stew next time instead of making mashed. Leftovers fed me for dinner for 4 days which is awesome for a poor grad student. Also think it would be great with some sugar snap peas thrown in.

Rating: 4
This recipe is delicious! I have made it twice, serving it over mashed potatoes both times. The only change I would make to the recipe is to delete the cornstarch step at the end. Mine came out a little too thick both times and I would have like to have had more "gravy." Otherwise followed recipe exact to wonderful reviews from family and friends!

Rating: 4
Wish I could give it 5 forks. I made it just as the recipe was written. I used a very good cabernet - which I think married well with the hoisin. I wanted to let it rest until tomorrow, but my husband sampled it and insists on having it for dinner tonight!

The red wine and hoisin sauce give this winter stew an intriguing flavor. No ho-hum flavors here. Nice consistency. Simply an outstanding culinary delight! We actually lost this recipe through multiple moves, and I remembered it so fondly that I searched for the recipe for years. Finally, I found it at epicurious!

This stew has a wonderful, rich gravy. I think it is worth using a good cab as that is a major contributor to the rich taste. This will definitely be part of my entertaining repertoire since it can be made a day ahead!

I have made this recipe twice and absolutely love it! In the beef stew category, it reigns for me to date. The only modification that I made the second time around was to skip the cornstarch addition at the end. It thickened the stew considerably and given that I was serving it over mashed potatoes, I preferred the extra stew "gravy" that resulted before this step. Delicious!!

I give this recipe four forks in the world of beef stews! I omitted the cornstarch step. The sauce thickened nicely after the last simmer on its own. Delicious, burgundy, rich...excellent. And easy!

Rating: 4
Fabulous flavor! I cut the hoisin to 1/3 cup; next time will try 1/4 cup, as the stew was still pretty sweet. Also, I cut out some of the steps by cooking the stew as I would a pot roast, dredging the chuck pieces in flour and browning in oil. I added the onions, cooking til translucent, then added all ingredients except carrots. Baked for 2 hours at 350. Added the carrots and baked another hour. No need to add any cornstarch as the flour thickened the sauce nicely. YUM! Served with horseradish mashed potatoes. A hearty meal for family, yet unusual enough to serve guests.

This is a great dish and not too hard to make. I cut the amount of Hoisin sauce as the other reviewers suggested and it's definitely better that way (I've had it with full amount and 1/2 and prefer the 1/2).

My picky 15 year old teen just got huge seconds! What can I say, this recipe is a keeper. I might have cooked this longer than required but under no circumstance leave off that 15 minute of boiling toward the end. Was surprised at how much this thickened the stew and separated the meat. Will make this again and will not be surprised if it becomes a requested recipe.

Rating: 4
I was amazed at how tender the chuck roast was after only 2 hours of cooking. The flavor was outstanding and my family said I could make this one again. I followed the directions pretty close, only I put the beef into a bowl while the onions cooked. I then added the first cup of wine to the onions and reduced it a bit before returning the beef to the pot. This is now saved in my recipe box.

Added pearl onions and portobello mushrooms to make the stew a little heartier. Did follow others' advice o cut down on the hoisin sauce. Big taste for such a simple recipe!

This is fabulous! The first time I made it, we were camping in Central Coast wine country. I actually cooked it over the campfire instead of my campstove, since I didn't want to run out of propane. It took far less time to cook (since you can't exactly vary the temperature of a campfire grate!) and was unbelievable. I did the recipe as is, except that I couldn't find the cornstarch when it came time to add - but then I didn't even need it. So thick, complex and good! I served it with roasted garlic mashed potatoes, spinach and walnut salad and an amazing Cabernet from a local vineyard. Four picky adults, NO leftovers. It was perfect for a chilly night by the camp fire....I made it again at home - it wasn't as thick, and the cooking time was as per the recipe. Still stunning. Both times I used whatever hoisin sauce was there in the grocery store (Ralphs) - but I confess I picked up the higher priced one, whatever it was. My toughest critic actually made a point of telling me how much he liked it, and how much he'd like it again....Definitely a keeper - don't dink around too much with the recipe - it's stands beautifully on its own.

Rating: 3
Made this twice now and everything is great save for a few things. I usually add my own fresh herbs (oregano, thyme, garlic) to plain canned tomatoes... why pay extra when you have a garden of herbs, right? And I have found about 2.5 pounds of meat to be just fine for this stew. Lastly it really needs to be simmered about an hour longer than the recipe calls for in order to break down the tough stew meat. Otherwise it's a great recipe. Delicious and unique and not overly sweet at all, IMO. Great with mashed potatoes or crusty bread and a big Cab.

There's not enough room here to describe how great this dish is! In a word - orgasmic! We've made it three times so far (even though we don't have a food processor so everything had to be done by hand), following the recipe exactly as is. We've had it with plain mashed potatoes (I hat garlic!) and tonight we had it with "caramelized onions and parmesan scones" from this website - delicious every time! It makes a huge amount of food and we always save some to have leftovers the next day AND freeze some for later. Next time we may try adding mushrooms and/or garlic, if hubby agrees - it's perfect as is!

Rating: 4
Modifications: dredged the beef in flour first, halved the hoisin sauce, added slightly more wine and tomato sauce, and cut out the cornstarch. I was a little dubious about this recipe, particularly given others' comments, but it ended up being one of the best stews I've made. The hoisin sauce added more depth to the sauce than is normally found, and though it may have been slightly sweet, I thought the onions cut that nicely. I'm not sure I would add potatoes, because they seem a bit too heavy for the (surprisingly delicate) sauce. I would vote for either pearl onions or mushrooms.

We love having soup for dinner every sunday night. I've been looking for something new to add to the rotation, and this is perfect. I tried this recipe with some concern after reading the previous reviews. However, I decided to take a risk and give it a try. I'm glad I did. I used the crockpot as suggested by other reviewers. I put all the ingredients (except oil) plus 1 1/2 cup sliced baby portabellas in the crockpot and cooked on high for 6 hours. I paired it with horseradish mashed potatoes made with extra horseradish for a little more zip. I found it sweet, but not too sweet when paired with horseradish mashed potatoes. The two flavors were delightful together. I gave the stew by itself 3 forks. Combining the stew with the "zippy" horseradish mashed potatoes earned a 4 fork rating in this household.

This was one of the best beef stew recipes I've tried. I skipped all the steps and just put all of the ingredients (except for the oil) in my crockpot on high for about four and a half hours. Even better the next day.

A rich, delicious stew without a lot of work. We didn't have carrots on hand but the dish was fine without them. As other Epicureans have stated, the sauce thickened beautifully without the corn starch.

Full-bodied flavor made this a winner. I did cut the chuck roast in 1 inch pieces which allowed this to be made in the time specified with the result being melt-in-your mouth beef. Leave out the carrots and substitute 2 large red peppers cut in 1/2-3/4 inch pieces. Divine.

I made the recipe as specified except for the cornstarch, which I found unnecessary.

I have made this recipe probably a dozen times now. Everyone loves it! I have my tweeked version all figured out and thought I'd share. I use 2 pounds natual stew beef, 2 pounds potatoes, and a package of mushrooms or 2-3 portobellos, and only 1/3 cup hoisin. Add the potatoes with the carrots. Add the mushrooms about 1/2 hour before finish. I use the amount of wine in the recipe and sometimes add a little more if needed. The wine and hoisin make the flavor of this stew. Rather that the recipe simmering instructions, I just let it simmer for about 2 hours. More, if I have the time. I usually don't need any cornstarch, but have used occasionally when I don't have time for more simmer. Enjoy!

Very "user-friendly" recipe, i.e., quite simple. I made the recipe as written and didn't have the sweetness issue with the hoisin that some have mentioned--the hoisin sauce is what gave the stew a unique taste. Good base recipe for adding whatever other vegetables you might have on hand. I thought the corn starch thickener could be optional given the reduction called for--it would simply depend on how thick you like your stew. Will definitely make it again.

I made this with generic stew meat and ended up cooking it for about 3.5 hours to get it tender. I added some more veggies (mushrooms,snap peas)and the full amount of hoisin sauce. Everone ate it up eagerly, including two teenagers. I think it's a nice stew but so much meat was just really heavy; the meal needed lots more vegetables to balance it.

I really wanted to love this one. I went to the Asian market and got the best Hoisin I could find. I followed the recipe exactly except to half the hoisin as suggested by other cooks and it was still too sweet. Hoisin is like barbque sauce. It's tasty but I think not in stew.

This was really very good. I followed the advice of other reviewers and didn't use all the hoisin - I used just over 1/3 c.

This has become my fussy daughter's favorite dish- and I made it for some other fussy adolescents who also raved.

I thought this was a good stew and very easy. Used the full amount of hoisin, but tasted as I went along. The orange of the carrots complemented the good brown color of the stew.

Absolutely fabulous! The flavors meld together wonderfully! This is a rich dish which is relatively inexpensive to prepare and cooks mostly on its own without a lot of oversight. I took note of the many previous reviewers who suggested cutting the hoisin in half. I'm not sure it was necessary though. May try it next time with the full 1/2 cup. The one change I did make that I would definetely make again was to add 2-3 T of tomato paste. Served this to guests Saturday night with the mashed potatoes with mushroom (also from this site). It was a huge success. Will definetely make this again!

I made this as written. Even though other reviewers had complained about the sweetness, I used the full amount of hoisin sauce -- which to my taste was a mistake.

To Orange County :I used Lee Kum Kee brand of hoisin sauce which I purchased at Cost Plus and it was great. This is the 3rd time I've made the recipe and it always gets rave reviews. The crock pot makes the chuck roast very tender and leaves you free to prepare the rest of your meal!

We took reviewers' suggestions of using 1/4 cup of hoisin sauce and browning the meat in batches. We also added some small whole mushrooms.

It's extremely heavy.

This was pretty good, but I expected more after reading the reviews. The hoisin sauce does add a nice complexity, but the amount called for would be too sweet for my taste.

I second the previous suggestion of adding only 1/4 cup of the hoisin sauce (compared to the 1/2 cup the recipe called for). Also, I encourage others to serve with "mashed potatoes with sage and white cheddar cheese" (also found on this site). An excellent combination--great for a winter weekend meal!

I thought was an excellent and different stew; I used about 2/3 of the hoisin called for and did not find it too sweet. In fact, after it simmered the flavors reminded me of eastern european stews. I added extra carrots for color and some potato wedges for body. Did not use the cornstarch since the sauce was plenty thick and syrup-y for my tastes.

Rating: 3
i didnt think it was too sweet at all; it may depend on what kind of cabernet you use. anyway, it was a super fun Sunday-afternoon cooking project, and tasted fantastic! You have to have a gigantic pot to roast the meat and then make way for the onions, plus a lot of meat juices accumulate. Next time i'll brown the onions seperately and then throw them into the beef.

My husband LOVED this recipe. He begs me to make it all the time. I had a little trouble browning the meat and cooking the onions in the same pot, so I used a separate pan for the onions and added a little of the beef juices to add flavor to the onions. It worked great. A loaf of sourdough to sop up the sauce is a must!

In the past I have not particularly liked beef stew but this was the best I have ever had. I followed the recipe exactly and used plain old supermarket hoisin and I thought it was great. I have a feeling that others that have complained about sweetness may be using a wine other than CS. I suspect that the CS is key to balancing flavors. I did not like the horse radish potatoes at all! Will make it with noodles next time.

This is my favorite stew. The addition of hoisin & a not too oakey red wine are delicious. I don't care for sweet main dishes & this is not sweet.

I am convinced that the quality of hoisin sauce either makes or breaks this recipe. The first time I made it, it was with that slop that is sold in my local Ralph's Supermarket. The second time I made it, I went to an Asian Market and bought Koon Chun and Lee Kun Chi, and used both of those (mixed). Fabulous! Despite the large Asian population here, I have to drive 30 miles to go to 99 Ranch Market for good Asian ingredients. I can only imagine what it must be like to live in a more remote region...

This is a fabulous main course. The hoisin sauce adds wonderful complexity to the flavors. I added parsnip, which worked well, but otherwise followed the recipe and found it rich, satisfying and not at all too sweet. Browning takes a bit longer than they say since I had to do this in stages. Who can push all that beef to the side and still have room to brown onions? A perfect comfort dish for a cold day.

I left the onions in bigger chunks and sauteed them until they carmelized; added 2 cloves of finely chopped garlic; used 1 heaping T hoison sauce; added rutabagas; cooked in the crockpot all day. Delicious! Husband has a new favorite stew recipe! 12/23/03 UPGRADING to 4 stars - leftovers are amazing!

Probably the best beef stew that I have ever had. I left the chuck roast in one piece (it falls apart anyway so don't bother cutting it into chunks) trimmed the excess fat, browned it really well on all sides and then put it in the slow cooker. Sauteed the onions and sliced carrots in the same pan along with some chopped garlic and then deglazed the pan with some of the wine; put that and the rest of the ingredients on top of the meat in the slow cooker on low for 8 hours. I did use one cup of wine and one cup of beef broth as some people suggested. The hoisin adds a depth of flavor that is just fantastic. One of the absolute best recipes ever!! :)

I love beef stew but didn't care for this recipe...too sweet. I ended up adding about 1 cup more wine to cut the sweetness. I also added garlic, parsnips & peas, and served it with mashed potatoes. My husband & brother-in-law liked it, but I prefer the recipe for Hearty Beef Stew with Green Peas and Carrots from this website.

I am not a huge fan of beef stews, but I really liked this one. The meat was very tender and the flavor was rich and hearty. I added peas this time, but would gladly add potatoes and mushrooms as well as I like lots of veggies.

Very good but does need the addition of mushrooms and potatoes. I used a little less hoisin than called for in the recipe and glad I did. Great flavor, not too sweet.

We don't eat beef so I made this with pork shoulder roast and it was WONDERFUL! I made it a second time for guests and they raved about it as well. SOOO easy and simple and really even better when made ahead. I don't like to use cornstarch, so for thickener we used just a little slurry of flour and water. This is definitely a "keeper" recipe.

LOVED IT!! I am not usually a beef stew fan. This one has a bit of asian flare so I thought I'd give it another try. I altered the recipe a bit using advice from here. I only used 1/3c hoisin, added parsnips and portabello mushrooms. Also, I just kept simmering rather than boiling again. I cooked it for a total of about 3 hours. It was great and everyone loved it. I want to try it in the crock pot next!

This was tasty, but a lot of work for what is just a beef stew. I made it with the horseradish mashed potatoes--too rich. Next time I will reduce the hoison and onions, add potatoes and peas, dump it in the crock pot, and serve with crusty bread.

Nice flavor, but just "okay". It put the leftover Hoisin sauce from our "Moo Shi" takeout to good use. I definitely would not purchase a jar of Hoisin sauce just for the sake of making this recipe again.

Bought already cut stew meat, browned it and the onions and then threw it into a crock pot with the other ingredients except for the carrots. Added carrots and some cut up potatoes an hour before serving. Was so easy, and was great tasting! The family loved this.

I made this dish as soon as I saw it in Bon Appetit- this is now a fall mainstay in our home-I have also made it with venison and it was out of this world. This is one of my absolute favorite recipes.

I made this exactly per the recipe, served it with mashed potatoes, and it turned out really well. A little too sweet for my tastes, not enough to make a bad dish, but will use a little less hoisin sauce next time. Usually I add extra sugar to recipes, so this sort of surprised me. I would definately recommend trying as written however, for each person's tastes are different and I seem to be the lone dissenter on the sweetness issue.

Rating: 3
I was pleased with this over all, despite accidentally dumping in extra hoisin. I would like more veggies in it though. Next time I will add some strong mushrooms and some parsnips. They should stand up well to the simmering, add a little color contrast. This froze well too, a definite plus.

Rating: 4
I followed others' suggestions - simmered longer instead of second boil (didn't need cornstarch) and added sliced baby bella mushrooms toward the end. Delicious and great for casual company since you can have it and the potatoes mostly done and then wrap it up when you're ready to eat - much better than "serve immediately" type foods.

Rating: 3
Excellent! I agree, this needed to simmmer longer (not boiled) and didn't need the cornstarch. I added about a pound of small peeled yukon gold potatoes for the last half hour or so, used about a half bag of baby carrots, and served it all together. It was fantastic!

This is a great stew. I think the amount of wine makes it just a tad acidic tasting, so I'm going to replace 1 cup of wine with some beef stock, but other than that, it was really great. I didn't change a thing. I wasn't fond of the horseradish potatoes, but I think this would be great with some regular ol' buttery mashed potatoes. YUM! Also, I added a bit more hoisin at the end, I just loved the blend of sweet and spicy.

This was GREAT! I used a 2.5 lbs of meat, and next time I'll cut the Hoisin down to 1/3 c (it's a little sweet), cooked it (without the 2nd boil) about 45 mins longer prior to adding the carrots to reduce without adding the cornstarch, and added a couple garlic cloves and some mushrooms as well. Great comfort good!!

This was excellent! I bought a good piece of beef chuck roast and did the trimming myself. My only change to this recipe was not adding the cornstarch mixture--the recipe doesn't need it. The sauce thickened on it's own and was wonderful. My kids loved this. I served it with the horseradish mashed potatoes from this site under Gormet magazine.

This was delicious and very easy! I took the advice of the other readers and did not boil a second time, just simmered longer. I'm not a big onion fan, so I just chopped up about 1/2 of what the receipe called for. I also used a shiraz. I also served the horseradish whipped potatoes.

I have made this dish soooo many times to rave reviews - which is saying a lot because my husband considers himself a stew/soup aficiando & he LOVES it!

I marinated the beef in Merlot for half a day. This imparted a nice flavor, but didn't make the beef particularly tender. Also, much of the moisture was then released during the beef saut phase; tending to boil rather than saut the beef. I added garlic to the onion mix, and portabella mushrooms (at the end). I would have preferred to reduce the stew rather than add cornstarch, but the veggies were getting soft so I gave in. But despite all this, my toughest critic (my wife) really loved it.

Rating: 3
Second time having made it and it was as good as always. Threw in some garlic and used a Cab this time (used Merlot last time). Make sure to trim the meat VERY well. I was a bit lax this time around and it came out rather greasy. Exquiste with horseradish mashed potatos. Keeps very well. Used Sun Luck hoisin, not too sweet at all!

Rating: 3
Very nice, satisfying winter stew. The hoisin does make it complex. I cut the meat amount in half and added cubed potatoes and more veggies in lieu of the rest of the meat. Would make it again. It freezes very well too. The cooks that got too much of a dominant wine flavor may have not cooked the stew long enough uncovered, so that the alcohol could cook off.

Rating: 3
I agree on smaller pieces of meat, longer cooking time, marinate in wine first, add mushrooms and reduce the sweet hoisin. A nice dish but not spectacular, although all my guests liked it.

This was really delicious, and astoundingly easy. I served it at a casual dinner party over horseradish mashed potates (from the same menu published by Bon Appetit), and everyone loved it. I too, used Lee Kum Kee hoisin sauce, and didn't find it too sweet at all. I followed the recipe exactly, with two exceptions born of necessity: I couldn't find a chuck roast, so I used a sirloin roast; and I used a cabernet/merlot blend.

This dish was awesome! I received so many compliments. Excellent flavor! I did add garlic, mushrooms and bell peppers to the mix to the stew which added more flavor. Not that it needed it. Best stew I ever made. Thanks for the recipe!

I prepared this recipe as it was written except I used Pinot Noir (already opened), and I ommited the corn starch thickener. Sauce thickened through reduction. I really enjoyed the unique flavor that the hoisin sauce imparted. Savoury and slightly sweet. I wouldn't reduce the hoisin, just experiment with brands that could be less sweet. I used Lee Kum Kee brand with good results. Minced garlic would be a nice addition. Carmelizing the onions sufficiently is key to this recipe.

An interesting recipe. Will search for a less sweet hoisin if making again as it was a tad too sweet for me even though the hosin gave it a very nice flavor. But the family enjoyed it and the leftovers were good lunch material. Will likely make it again, but not when craving beef stew comfort food

I thought this was a great tasting dish. I added 1/2 a bag of frozen peas, soem sliced mushrroms and about 2 diced potatoes. As a result, there was not as much sauce. Next time, I will have to compensate. This is a great winter dinner that is very easy and travels well.

I found this to be extremely sweet. One out of 4 of us at the dinner table liked it. Next time I would definately use less hoisen-- I think that is what made it so overly sweet. I do have to say that the meat was extremely tender! I added potatoes which made it a bit more hearty.

This dish can be fantastic or ordinary. What's the difference? Three easy elements: 1) Meat -- Use a better, lower-fat cut of meat than the suggested chuck, and cut the pieces smaller than the recipe suggests (you want chunks half the size of what the recipe calls for); 2) Marinade -- Before cooking the meat, marinate it for 20 minutes in the cabernet, and it'll taste worlds better; 3) Sauce -- If you use a little less meat than what this recipe calls for, the meat/sauce ratio is divine. I've made this dish multiple times, and when I've made it according to the recipe, I've found it average; when I've tweaked it as described here, I've found it exquisite.

I love anything with hoisin sauce, and this recipe did not disappoint me one bit. I substitued canned tomatoes for fresh, with a dollop of homemade spaghetti sauce for moisture.

I used this recipe as a base to put a new twist on a traditional chuck roast with gravy, not a stew. It was wonderfully delicious. First I floured and browned the chuck roast then added a little water, the wine, onion, juelined carrots, hoisen and some whole staw mushrooms. Seasoned it with basil and let it simmer for hours. Thickened the sauce a little bit with corned starch and water. Salt & peppered to taste. Served it with garlic mashed potatoes, noodles and sauteed asparagus. Boy, it was "good eatin"!

If you don't like hoison sauce don't make this. But my husband made this for my birthday party and everyone wanted the recipe and loved it with the horseradish mashed potatoes. I love this recipe, my daughter loves it, and it will be a part of our family recipes from now on. n

This recipe had definite possibilities. I thought it had an overwhelming wine taste, but my guests loved it (or were they just being polite?).

This is a very interesting version of traditional beef stew, thanks to the hoisin sauce. As one of the reviewers recommended, I used half of the hoisin called for in the recipe. I used tenderloin of beef and peral onions. I also added a clove of galic, minced, and a russet potato, diced. Also, I added some green beans and some brown mushrooms.

I made this recipe twice- once as stated, and another time with my own modifications. If I make it again, it would be with the changes. For example, I added celery, carrots, and potatoes to make this a one-pot meal. I also reduced the amount of red wine to lessen the overwhelming wine flavor. And I added chipotle chili powder to give it a little spice and depth. But it's definintely the hoisin sauce that makes the recipe different that your usual stew recipe.

I didn't find the hoison at all overwhelming in the called for amount. In fact, I used one pound less beef and one cup less onions, and kept the rest of the ingredients and cooking times as called for, and it came out very nicely. Of note, I added about four cloves of fresh garlic to the onions (minced) and a package of sliced shitake mushrooms went in with the carrots, and I loved the result. A definite keeper.

My 21 and 23 year old sons made this dish for my birthday a week ago. Am I a lucky woman or what? It smelled wonderful and we enjoyed it very much. They added red potatoes and shitake mushrooms which I think rounds out the dish. We agreed that the recipe is a keeper

I've made this twice now and learned that you should avoid the sweeter variety of hoisin sauce. The Kame brand is best, which has a pungent, non-sweet plummy taste. Also, the onions carmelize better if they are chopped very coarse. If you do these 2 things right, you can't go wrong with this recipe.

YUM!!! This was really great. I used only 2 pounds of beef and 1/3 cup of hoisin but left everything else the same, and I thought the meat-to-sauce ratio was good. Great subtle sweet flavor, most people wouldn't be able to place it. Also I only had regular canned tomatoes so I threw in rosemary, marjoram, basil, etc. It came out fragrant and delicious. I did have to cook it slightly longer to get the meat and carrots tender (but I'm at high altitude). Will definitely make again.

This is a great 'different' beef stew. I halfed the recipe because there were only two of us, but still used the whole can of tomatoes and added some dried mushrooms that were in the cabinet.

This was my first bash at beef stew and it was great! Very simple, although I would not recommend chopping 7 onions by hand to anyone: food processors are great inventions. Yesterday the flavors were a little strong, but after sitting a night the seem to have mellowed. I'd definitely make this one again. Very tasty.

Far, far too sweet tasting. I felt like some major flavor was missing also, but I can't figure it out. Less hoisin? More garlic? More veggie flavor? I'm not sold on this one yet....

Very flavorful. Definitely a family pleaser. I followed recipe only doubling the cornstarch as we like our stew thick. I made mashed potatoes with sour cream and cream cheese - filled a soup bowl half with the potatoes and poured the stew over the top. It was terrific - will make again soon.

Doubled this recipe to serve 12 adults for a wonderful fall-themed dinner party - and people were licking their plates. The horseradish mashed potatoes absolutely make the dish - although we served left-overs with noodles and it was just as good. Like some other reviewers, I added extra veggies - mushrooms, turnips, parsnips, whatever I had. Excellent!

Delicious! While I am a huge fan of hoisin, my husband tends to look upon hoisin dishes with suspicion. The first night it received an 'okay' but the second night, after the flavours had mingled, he really liked it. I added mushrooms to the onions and served it over egg noodles. Keeper.

I know I'm in the minority but I made this stew last night and both my husband and I agreed, it was not our favorite. I guess it's possible that it was the quality of the hoisin sauce but we like some of the others thought it was too sweet. I cut back back to a 1/3 of a cup of hoisin and added some garlic but those were my only changes. I won't make again, there are to many delightful recipes on this site to waste my time.

Great recipe. Had 4 hour notice that I was hosting a dinner party so I made this while I cleaned my house! I thru in a handful of button mushrooms, and a small bag of baby carrots.

Made this for a casual dinner party last Saturday night. On Friday night, I made the stew exactly as directed with the exception that I tripled it so it was necessary to brown the beef and caramelize the onions separately. Then I slowly reheated and let simmer for 3 hours on Saturday. The smell, flavor, color and texture were fabulous! I served it over sourcream mashed potato's. Everyone said it was one of the best beef stews they have ever had. No one could quite figure out the "under taste" of sweetness and all were surprised when I said it had hoisin sauce in it. This is definitely a keeper! One note: as mentioned earlier it is important to make sure the onions really caramelize. Since I tripled the recipe it took much longer than what was stated in the recipe.

Very good! I used lean stewing meat from Whole Foods, Shiraz wine and added some shiitake mushrooms...all over steaming Basmati rice. I also used a tablespoon of Wondra flour as the thickener instead of cornstarch. The salad with maple dressing, apples, craisins and nuts (on this site) went great with this dinner.

My non-cooking husband finished this recipe for us for dinner tonight. His review? "This is a keeper" and believe me, he says that neither often nor lightly. Easy, delicious, wonderfully different stew. I left out the carrots and skipped the cornstarch as the stew was thick enough. Great served over rice. Next time I'll try it over egg noodles, maybe add some mushrooms and diced potatoes as others suggested. Yum with a capital Yum!

I loved it!!! Changed a couple of things though, added mushrooms, left out the carrots and added more pepper. When it was done, i could barely see the peices of beef that I put in, there was too much sauce. I think next time I'll add potatoes to make it more filling. I served it with rice, and a little bit of that sauce goes a long way. After we finish the meat, I think I'll save the sauce for more rice dishes.

We loved it! My husband said it was "restaurant quality"! We enjoyed the sweet flavor. I reheated it, and found the look of the sauce wasn't as appealing, it was lumpier looking, than when it finished cooking the first time. Next time I will add mushrooms. YUM

I have to fight myself not to make this dish more than once per week, else beef will take over our otherwise well-balanced predominantly fish and chicken diet. I use every drop of hoisin called for in the recipe, and most of the time only use half of the beef so we have loads of leftover sauce to pour over rice, potatoes, sop up with bread, etc. My 2yo daughter eats bowl after bowl of the sauce over rice. Simply mouthwatering and delectable. So far (over two years), my favorite and most cooked recipe from this site.

I made this (and the Horseradish Mashed Potatoes which are an outstanding compliment to the dish) on a chilly Sunday after my boyfriend and his roomate spent all day installing a hot tub. They loved it and so did I. The flavors are really wonderful and such a pleasant change from your average stew. I also started out with 1/4 cup of Hoisin, as per recommendations, but increased it to the full amount after it had simmered a while and I tasted it. I didn't find it too sweet at all but I used high quality Hoisin so perhaps that's the difference. I also put in mushrooms which were an excellent addition. A nice spinach salad would also be a good side. I would definitely make this again and again.

I can't believe how good this was! I was pretty nervous about it because the smell of the hoisin while simmering was really intense and kind of overwhelming, but when it came time to serve, it tasted amazing. Made it with the horseradish mashed potatoes. Very easy to prepare on a week night, and a big hit on a cold fall evening!

I have tried many stew recipes always looking for the one with that something special. Well, this one is just that. I added one red pepper in with the chopped onions. One other alteration I made was to saute the onions and pepper separately from the beef. I could not find a pot large enough to put the beef to the side and cook the onions. Also the beef must be browned in batches rather than altogether to prevent steaming the beef.

Very good, but like several others, did it with a twist - and did it all in less than an hour start to finish. Browned the beef - in batches -in a pressure cooker, then dumped in everything but the carrots (based on the group's comments, thought it might be too sweet). Brought to high pressure for 18 minutes, let the pressure drop naturally (about 10 minutes), and then thickened with flour-water mixture on the stove. This way, the meat was very tender (think tenderloin) but definately NOT stringy, and the sauce was silky smooth and delicious. Will make again the same way, but this time will add your suggestions of adding garlic and sauteed mushrooms. Will also serve with mashed potatoes. A great cold weather dish!

I have made this stew a few times now, and it has been good in each incarnation!! I've used good wine, I've used awful wine; I've used nice meat, I've used icky meat. I've tweaked it by adding mushrooms, or ketchup or salt pork when I was out of the other ingredients. I am a little surprised at some of the "hated it" comments - I have just not been able to make a bad batch yet. I think the secret is to use good Hoisin sauce. This recipe has definitely replaced my mom's old "stick-in-pot-with-whole-chile-brick-&-cook- til-edible" standby for gamey, dry, freezer burned, tough, stringy, or just plain tasteless beef.

I am a vegetarian who loves to entertain -- and tries to serve meat dishes every once in a while for my carnivorous husband. I made this in the crock pot for a dinner party and it was a big hit. I browned the beef and onions, then dumped the whole mixture into the slow cooker for 6 hours. I finished the last couple of steps (corn starch slurry) on the stove. Easy, easy, easy . . . and made the house smell divine.

I thought my husband had died and gone to heaven. He LOVED this stew and the horseradish mashed potatos were wonderful with it. He told me this morning not to lose this recipie.

I can't believe how good this recipe is. The first time I made it everyone raved. The horseradish mashed potatoes and the hoisin sauce in the stew create a very complex flavor.

I was so curious to try this recipe due the the varying reviews. I'm not a beef stew person but my hubby and kids are and they thought this recipe was delicious. They did comment that it was a little sweet, but not overwhelming, however, next time, I'll, like others, cut the hoisin sauce down to a quarter cup. To speed things up, I bought beef stew cubes and browned them in a separate pan while the onions were cooking in another. Because some people complained that their stew burned I decided to cook the stew in my slow cooker which worked out great. I found that it needed more liquid during the cooking process so I added more wine and some chicken broth. I placed the horseradish mashed potatos in the center of a soup plate and ladled the stew over it. Very nice meal.

I recently had this recipe at a friend's house and was so impressed that I had to see for myself if it was just as good the second time.

I thought this was EXCELLENT and I am not a big fan of any type of stew. My husband is a big meat and potatoes fan so in keeping with other reviewers suggestion I served this over a bed of rosemary mashed potatoes. I also made with 1/2 of the recommended hoisin sauce and it was delicious. I ended up also omitting the cornstarch at the end because I wanted the gravy to have a thinner consistency so that the mashed potatoes could soak it up. It was truly wonderful! My husband is already asking when I am going to make this again.

I thought this stew was very good. I made it exactly like the recipe was written except for the addition of mushrooms and garlic, and it came out great. It's definitely a different kind of stew, but a very tasty one I thought. You need to make sure to use a good Cabernet. If you use a cheap wine you will really taste the difference in the stew. The hoisin sauce I thought was interesting, but if you don't care for hoisin sauce you probably won't like the stew. I made the horseradish mashed potatoes as others suggested to go with it and they were very good too. I think garlic mashed potatoes would be nice with it as well.

I was somewhat disappointed with this after reading all of the rave reviews. I only used 1/2 cup of the hoisin since alot of cooks said a whole cup made the stew too sweet. It was definitely tasty, but not a favorite. I think I probably just expected too much.

Fantastic! We're big stew lovers in our house, and this is one of the best we've tried. I used baby carrots to cut down on the chopping, so had to cook a bit longer for the carrots to be tender. Perhaps that helped the flavors to really blend. Great over wide egg noodles with a spinach salad. Don't cut back on the hoisin sauce -- it's distinctive flavor is a big plus. No point in doing the beef and onions at the same time -- just brown separately and save yourself the trouble of cramming the pan too full. Mushrooms are a great addition!

You have to like hoisin sause to like this stew. And you have to get the right kind - the one sold an the Asian stores, not in chain supermarkets. I served it for a party of 12 - nobody complained. My husband, who LOVES hoisin was thrilled, I'd say it was ok.

This was a terrific recipe! I liked the unusual flavor that the Hoisin sauce added. I didn't think it was too sweet, but I like Hoisin sauce, so maybe I was expecting the flavor. I had some problems with sticking and burning, but my pans are thin. I guess I'd add more liquid next time to prevent this. I'm definitely making it again.

I made this the other night (with added mushrooms) and served it with Asian rice, and found it to be a good, easy to make stew. As I do not like 'sweet' food, I halved the amount of hoisin sauce but in the end could barely taste it. In fact the stew was not much different from other red wine, tomato, onion based stews I have made. Next time I will try the full amount of hoisin.

I cut the hoisin sauce to 1/4 cup as suggested by some, but the stew still turned out to be very sweet. I'm not sure if the sweetness came from the Cabernet Sauvignon that I used or somewhere else.

Wonderful flavor! I did read all the reviews before I made this. What a great service, am not sure I would have tried it without them so thank you all. I made the recipe as written, but I did take out the meat to do the onions and simmered a little longer than 45 minutes; also added button mushrooms along with the carrots, as suggested. Used my 4 qt. Scan Pan saucepot which was the perfect size. The comments about sweetness concerned me, as we don't even care for sugary sweet potato dishes, but that was definitely not a problem. It is a different kind of sweetness, and I can't think of a better way to say it. Not at all objectionableto us. Taste varies, so if you finish the stew and it tastes sweet to you, judiciously add salt. If it is not salty enough, it will taste sweet, and salt is hard to judge in it. Also, use the wine recommended. A less dry wine can really make a difference. Served with the horseradish potatoes. Yummy! This is an easy dish to make and IMO much better than the short ribs!

Loved it. Added lots of mushrooms near the end of cooking. Cooked the dish in a covered electric fry pan and had NO problem with sticking and burning. Sauteed the onions with the beef out of the pan and sauteed them in butter instead of olive oil and added salt and pepper to the onions. Cut the hoisin sauce in half. I used a round tip roast. I think fat noodles works great with this for family and mashed potatoes for company.

Be careful during the first thickening stage (boiling over high heat). If you don't stir it often enough, it'll stick to the bottom of the pot and burn. Luckily enough, I caught it in time, so I just deglazed with more wine and it ended up adding even more depth to the stew.

We really liked this. Served it over garlic mashed potatoes. Simmered on very low heat for several hours, which made it even better (poured in extra wine to ensure enough liquid)

I enjoyed this dish at a friend's home. She served it as part of a buffet for 25. She mixed cooked orzo into the stew just before serving and it was delicious prepared that way.

This was fantastic. Leftovers were great too!

This is orgasmic! It is such a delightful diversion from the usual mundane beef stew. We love hoisin sauce anyway (especially on grilled chicken...Hello!) We served it with/on mashed potatoes with garlic and horseradish.

Delicious! This was the yummiest stew I've ever eaten . . . and I'm not a fan of stews.

We loved this stew! The wine and hoisin sauce is a nice combination and it's very easy to make. We ate leftovers over rice instead of potatoes and that was great too. Be sure to salt the beef well.

Great recipe, I would definitely make this for friends and family again. I added thinly sliced shallots and leeks in with the onion and turnips in with the carrots. This dish had a fabulous and unique flavor!!!

Great recipe and very easy to prepare. Not as savory as one would think of a "beef stew". The hoisin really adds a sweetness. Next time I will half hoisin amount (it does make this a wonderful color)and serve with plain mashed potatoes instead of the horshradish mashed potatoes.

Made the stew this weekend for a casual dinner party, and it was a big hit. It's so easy to prepare - really a no-stress dish. It is sweet though, so best to do side dishes that are a bit more tart. (We did blue cheese mashed potatoes instead of the horseradish.)

Great Recipe! I made it on a weekend with friends and three other people who had it have already made it again for their guests. We did the whole fireplace dinner theme and had a blast. It is perfect with the horseradish mashed potatoes.

This smelled heavenly in my kitchen, but the taste didn't live up to the aroma. Too sweet for my taste and my husband's. I might consider trying again without the hoisin.

Well, this is wonderful...I have already recommended the recipe to friends and served it at an intimate dinner party - yummers all around. Be careful with the hoisin sauce - can overly sweeten the dish. Can't hurt to add a little garlic. I served this with the Orzo with Green Onions and Parmesan (also from this site); think it might be better accompanied by Au Gratin Potatoes or simply buttered noodles (with some herbs and garlic, of course).

EXCELLENT! (Add mushrooms.)

My family really loved this stew. The flavors didn't smell or taste good when it first started cooking, but after awhile it became really tasty. This is really a unique recipe.

Yummy! I used a tri-tip roast and it came out fork tender. Also added some fresh mushrooms towards the end. My husband thought it was a little sweet, though, so next time I will probably reduce the hoisin sauce to 1/4 cup.

This was wonderful!! The most time consuming part was trimming the fat off the meat -- it's quite a fatty cut. I used Shiraz for the wine because I had it around -- it was wonderful. I could imagine that mushrooms would be great in here as well. The consistency was perfect, the taste absolutely amazing...can't recommend it enough!

Best beef stew I've ever had. I skipped the carrots, since I don't like them, and added dried white mushrooms and dried shiitake mushrooms midway through cooking. I cooked about 3 hours on very low heat, and midway through, when I added the extra wine, I also added another 1/2 c of hoisin. I didn't need the cornstach as a thickener, and I thought the flavor was lovely--you can't tell it's hoisin, but it sure is good. I garnished with finely chopped scallions.

Even the kids liked this for dinner. I served it with white rice. Perfect on a cold winter day.

Excellent! I also added mushrooms. My stock pot is a standard size pot, still did not have enough room to do per direction. I just added onions in with beef and cooked. Also I cooked way longer than directions called for.

Have made many a beef stew in my day. This was the best. I did not have a problem with burning. I did brown the meat in batches and remove it before adding the onions. Just didn't have a pot big enough to brown both the beef and onions. Then mixed them both together. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly as written. Delicious!

Enjoyable...but almost ruined our stockpot. Anyone else have a problem with severe burning on the bottom of their pan? Assuming it was the hoisin sauce. Made the horseradish potatoes too. A good winter meal.

I thought this stew was a great twist on a classic. Next time I would add potatoes and mushrooms.

This stew was fantastic! We're not really "stew eaters", so we were pleasantly surprised with this dish. We added crimini mushrooms and used an inexpensive Zinfandel in place of the Cabernet. It was great with the horseradish mashed potatoes. We will definitely make this again.

This was the most delicious stew I have ever made. Wonderful for a cold winter's evening and the smells are great!! Also made it with the horseradish mashed potatoes-a big hit!!

Excellent - I used New York steak cut into 1/2 inch strips and added mushrooms about halfway through. A restaurant quality keeper.

This may be the most delicious stew I've ever made. Pefect for a winter dinner party with salad & simple vinagrette dressing + apple crisp for dessert. Next time will add mushrooms about 1/2 way through cooking. Sauce was deliciously thick and tasty; horseradish mashed potatoes were excellent with this dish. Meal took a little while to prepare but it was very simple to make.

An outstanding recipe -- and a big hit with my whole family. I used the very tiniest baby carrots (from "snack bags") and added LOTS of quartered mushrooms which I sauteed before combining with stew about halfway through. Made it two days in advance, simmered an extra half hour to reheat, added cornstarch at end. A keeper!

Absolutely delicious---a real winner. I have made it twice and it was a hit. The hoisin made the flavor very interesting.

Well, I confess to having been a bit skeptical about this one but it looked fast and easy so... I shouldn't have fretted. This dish is absolutely fantastic, and much easier than some of the other recent recipes (the Jan. cover recipe, for example). So rich and flavorful, you can't lose!!

This dish is way too good to be called a stew. It is more like a slow cooked beef in a fabulous sauce. Got rave reviews when I made it with horseradish mashed potatoes and would not change a thing!

This was a very easy and yummy dish. I served it over egg noodles and they worked well with the stew. Next time I will add some sliced mushrooms.

We loved this stew. It was great with the horseradish mashed potatoes that accompanied this recipe. A different and interesting flavor for stew. Will definitely make again.

This recipe gets kudos in my house for its unique combination of flavors in a beef stew. I thought that it was good, albeit not out of this world, but my picky husband, who doesn't like beef stew, really went wild over it.

I agree that the effort to result ratio is very good, but we all found the dish too sweet. Perhaps the natural sweetness of the tomatoes and the carrots are just too much with the hoisin.

Rating: 3
We thought this was a huge payoff for a minimal effort--must be the hoisin. We have a majority who hate to eat cooked carrots, so we just threw in a couple whole ones for the sweetness, making them easy to navigate around when serving. Then added button mushroom caps instead, which worked really well. Make sure you use a sufficiently large pot or you'll have a hard time browning the beef and onions. We had to switch pots after we realized our first choice was too small. It was wonderful with mashed potatoes the first night and great over egg noodles as leftovers.
