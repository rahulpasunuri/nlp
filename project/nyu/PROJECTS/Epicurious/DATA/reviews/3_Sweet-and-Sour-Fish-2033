This was a very simple preparation! I've made it with baked fish, sauteed chicken and fried tofu. But I'm a big fan of Traditional Americanized Sweet & Sour dishes like you used to get at those Chinese/Polynesian restaurant with the giant red-pleather bound menus. In other words: a sweet & sour dish without pineapple is not worth eating. SO: lose the peas (peas in this dish is just odd), add some pineapple, use some juice from the same can to add sweetness if it's too sour for you, and OF COURSE add chunks of chopped onion and red peppers. Also, this sauce turns out a little muddy colored because of the soy. You can avoid this by using a little white miso paste mixed with water instead. Then the tomato paste makes the main color!

I didn't use any white wine and the sauce turned out well. I substituted tomato chunks for tomato sauce and snow peas for bamboo shoots. Very colorful presentation.

This fish was excellent however I changed the recipe so that it was not as sour as the first review had mentioned. Added one more tablespoon of sugar and instead of tomato sauce, I used three tablespoons of ketchup. I also did not make the flour and white wine mixture but instead just floured the fish with cornstarch. Great!

As we live in Hong Kong I wanted to try something Chinese at home. This recipe sounded authentic but turned out too sour -- maybe vinegar and rice wine is too much together. I'd make it again, and cut the quantities, throw in a few pineapple chunks and green peppers too.
