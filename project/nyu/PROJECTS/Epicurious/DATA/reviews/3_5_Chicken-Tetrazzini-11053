Delicate flavor with a nice balance. I used chicken thighs instead of a whole chicken cut up. I think that the sauce needs to be a bit thicker, so more roux. Also, as another reviewer says, the more thoroughly cooked your pasta, the more sauce will remain in the casserole. Some nuts or panko would be a nice addition for a little texture and crunch.

Very good! Not exactly healthy, but a great family dinner. To cut down the fat a little, I used evaporated 2% milk instead of the cream and it was still yummy!

Made this over 2 days so wasn't such a big chore. Allowed the stock plenty of time to completely cool, and preparing the mushrooms the 1st day also made for easier compilation the next night. Definitely not low cal, but SO HEARTY. Easy to freeze and have later.

forgot to add, I also sauteed the mushrooms with shallots & garlic.

This got the highest compliment from my husband: "The leftovers don't taste like leftovers!" It reheats exceptionally well. It was very easy to make. I used more mushrooms (3/4 lb), more cheese (1c parm + 1/4 c cheddar), and more sauce (1 1/4c cream, 1/2 c sherry). I also added a little cayenne pepper, which warmed it up without being ostentatious. Next time I will make a little more roux as I found the sauce a little runny with all the extra liquid. Also I used boneless chicken breasts, sliced thin and sauteed in olive oil with herbs de provence, and made chicken broth from powder instead of from scratch. Definitely a standby!

This is pretty much the recipe from Joy of Cooking, except Joy adds almonds, which I add also. Chicken tetrazzini seems to have fallen out of favor in recent years, but I don't care -- this is really a fabulous casserole.

Very good. Made the following alterations: added peas, substituted 1/2&1/2 for cream and olive oil for some of the butter, sauteed shallot and garlic with mushrooms. I think I may try regular milk next time as it was still a litle rich for my palate. Delicious though and reheats very well.

Sauce is the best part of this recipe. I sauteed the mushrooms with shallots in the butter to add a little flavor and also added peas (per my fave recipe when I was young). Loved this recipe and it's great comfort food!

This one is a keeper. After reading other reviewer's comments I made the following modifications with excellent results: used leftover turkey and 2 c canned chicken broth rather than make my own broth, cooked the pasta thoroughly (not just al dente),and used a sprinkle of nutmeg rather than freshly grated. I decided not to make extra sauce as some suggested, and was fine with the result. Will try shittake mushrooms next time. All in all, a rich dish with nice flavors.

Fantastic recipe! Tons of flavour for so few ingredients. Make sure you use plenty of water (about 8 cups) when simmering the chicken in order to create a rich stock once it's reduced.

I've been making this version for many years as a "use up the turkey after Thanksgiving" recipe and it's always been popular. Despite a previous comment, I've found that the cream sauce works just fine with milk instead of cream, but I do find that I usually need to increase the sauce by about 1/2. My husband loves his sauce! My mother used to use tetrazzini as a standard buffet dinner dish but she included tuna and black olives. I haven't been able to get her recipe though and now she's beyond telling me.

I made this recipe with leftover turkey from Thanksgiving. Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly (I find it frustrating when people review a recipe that they have substantially modified). I think the heavy cream is a must.

I used onions and garlic, as other cooks had suggested, and this was delicous. You could probably use a combination of milk or half and half if you were worried about the fat.

Had some leftover chicken from a takeaway roasted bird to use, and found this recipe. Used chicken broth instead of making stock, increased sherry to 1/4 cup, added a chopped onion and roasted red pepper plus one clove chopped garlic to the mushroom saute mixture. Also used whole wheat pasta since I'm trying to follow South Beach phase III. Dish came out YUMMY. Will definetly try this one again sometime.

Looking for a recipe of Chicken Parmesan I happened to come across Tetrazzini instead. It was the first time I had ever made this dish and was a marvelous idea for an instant "hurry up and create plate for a first time date" situation. Not a single complaint. I would recommend this simple and low maintenance dish to anyone with great taste and am sure to be making it again!

The trouble with those who find this recipe dry is that they probably undercooked the noodles. The instruction to cook them al dente is wrong, all noodle casseroles will dry up if the noodles are not completely cooked as they will absorb the sauce. The more the noodles are cooked, the less sauce you will lose.

I first cooked this dish 5 years ago, it was recommended to me by my American aunt because I was having a 'murder mystery' dinner party and needed a tasty but low maintenance main course. I lost the recipe and so was happy to find it again. I use only the chicken white meat (we call it breast meat), thinly sliced across the grain and sauted in a little butter. I also add sliced shallots, pureed garlic, and thinly sliced sweet pepper, gently sweated in butter. A family favourite.

After my husband asked if I could prepare this childhood favourite dish, I surprised him with it one evening. I skipped using the cream (too fattening and didn't have any on hand) and used extra wine; it was still extremely delicious and easy. I would make again for a dinner party.

Way too dry. Not much flavor.

My husband said that the Tetrazzini served at the cafeteria of his junior high was better than this! Not sure if it was the recipe's fault or mine....

This was my first time ever making tetrazzini, and it was very easy to cook. It tasted very good. The only thing I would add is a little salt and/or pepper to taste. I also added shredded cheddar cheese to the top of it when it was done. This topped it off!

As other have stated, this dish benefitted from the addition of garlic and onions - I also used leftover turkey and had to substitute wine for the sherry. My family really enjoyed it, and using leftovers & chicken broth (I used Knorr's and just added about an extra 1/2 tsp to make the broth more intense) made it super easy.

I ended up grilling my chicken separately and it turned out quite nice. I made the chicken spicy, so the pasta was a nice offset. I DID follow the recommendations to saute an onion and some garlic with the mushrooms, since it seems strange to me that they wouldn't be there - Anyhow, very good and simple (PS: I used half and half for the cream and it still tasted creamy enough)

I wanted to use leftover turkey from Thanksgiving but didn't have all the listed ingredients so I improvised (and it looked like it would be a bit bland otherwise) by adding peas, sauteed garlic and shallots, white wine (the Sherry had mysteriously vanished) and macaroni. I didn't even bother making special stock - instead used canned chicken broth. Much faster and easier, and it still was yummy! Definitely a keeper.

Try adding a jar of chopped pimentos or roasted red pepper slices (chopped) to add flavor and color. I also used 1/2 cup Sherry rather than 3 T. and it really added to the flavor. Great buffet dish!

Delicious! Great for formal dinners or just a family meal.

Adding thinly, thinly sliced hard salami to this dish even makes it better. Sort of helps the blandness and gives a surprise taste.

Delicious! Delicious! My husband doesn't like chicken, but when I served this he asked "is there more?" I knew it was a winner for my recipe file.
