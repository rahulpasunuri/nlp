Tasted great on the Lime Mojo Pork I made, but instead of grinding the spices in a spice grinder or blender, I used my mini-food processor, which was a mistake. The hard coriander seeds and cumin seeds basically worked like a sand blaster on the plastic, so now the inside is all scratched up and looks cloudy. Won't make that mistake again.

This rub is the best thing that ever happended to pork loin. I have made the entire menu (shrimp cakes, ppork loin, roasted squash at least a dozen times and have had superlative reviews from every dinner party guest. If you don't love this, it's a genetic issue.

This is a great rub! The cumin seeds are aromatic. Everyone was commenting on the aroma before I even started working! We used it as directed to marinate the pork loin with lime mojo. No subs or additions. It was so good!

I made this for Slow Roasted Pork with Lime Mojo and for Spiced Butternut Squash, both turned out to be delicious. I'll be trying this out on other meats and veggies as well!

I used pre-ground cumin and coriander. The flavor is terrific and aromatic. I use it for grilled beef kabobs. A squirt of fresh lime finishes them.

I not only use this Latin Spice Mix for the recipes that call for it (January 2000 BonAppetit a "Nuevo Latino" dinner), but I make extra and use it in many of my Latin dishes. The roasting of the spices brings out the many nuances of each spice used and when all blended together--BUENO!
