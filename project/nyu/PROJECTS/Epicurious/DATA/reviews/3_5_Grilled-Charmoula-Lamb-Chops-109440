i used the chermola marinade and then roasted the trader joe rach of lamb per the package directions. very tasty. i served with spinach pear cranberry salad from this site and oven roasted potatoes. it was a special dinner which i would make for company.

One major substitution was a big shallot for the onion and garlic. My wife and I liked this so much on our lamb loin chops we used it a couple days later on rib-eye steaks with equal success. I would give this 3.5 stars - it was more than delicious but maybe not exceptional.

The recipe worked great. I used the leftover charmoula on shirmps ( dipped in the saurce for 15 minutes ) and grilled them on a a stovetop grill. It was very good!

This was wonderful! So easy and tasty. I froze the leftover charmoula, it's still brightly colored and ready for the next time I make this recipe.

Recipe worked out well - tasted great and easy to put together. Not necessary to finely chop the garlic, since everything's blended until smooth anyhow. Used a little more salt than the recipe called for also.

Delicious, substituted more parsley for cilantro.

Fabulous, easy & delicious. I used lamb rib chops & marinated them for a few hours, then followed the instructions for stovetop cooking - a heavy, seasoned, cast-iron skillet worked just fine with a bit of oil. I seared the chops, then lowered the heat & cooked them covered, 3 mins per side. I also added xtra garlic to the sauce. Thank you to "A cook from Charlottsville, VA" for suggesting use of the leftover sauce for salmon. Brilliant idea! BTW, I can't imagine where "A Cook from NYC" went wrong, since I had PLENTY of leftover sauce. A little xtra cayenne might have spiced it up a bit.

Very tasty & easy. Had thick lamb chops and used toasted ground cardamom instead of cilantro and left out the parsley, but was very flavorful without being overwhelming. Marinated for an hour. Great with couscous & feta.

Yummy and unusual. Everyone really liked it. Not hard to do, either.

A dish so easy and succulent -- can't wait for another occassion to cook it. The charmoula was a wonderful accompaniment to salmon the next night and assumed a very different flavor with a lighter meat. Nobody could tell I cut corners!

Not that impressed. We followed the recipe exactly, although did not BBQ them but, placed them under a very hot broiler. Although the BBQ would likely help the recipe, I can't imagine it would be that different. The Charmoula is missing something. We cook Moroccan food relatively often and have made other Charmoula sauces, often for fish and chicken. This one simply wasn't that great. Recipe says to blend till smooth but, maybe it'd of been better if more chunky. Likewise, I had thought to throw some almonds into the sauce, as in other Charmoulas, but did not. In retrospect they probably would've helped. In short, good lamb chops are expensive and this recipe didn't measure up. Would not make again. PS: the recipe does make extra sauce; what to do with it I can't imagine.

We didn't change the sauce at all, but used tofu under the oven broiler -- soaked up every last drop with bread.
