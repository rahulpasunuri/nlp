Normal fare here. Standard. That is a good thing. The addition of clams did add a bit more interest to the meal. However, you'd need a really, really shallow bowl to display the clams the way the photo shows. I do indeed have Japanese side dish and soup bowls, they are petite but it still did not fly. Making Japanese or Asian tonight and need a soup? I highly recommend it but don't make it because you want some thing special or outstanding. It is good food.

I'm asian so I know a good asian recipe when I come across one. This is definitely a FABULOUS recipe for miso soup. The addition of the clam flavor makes this soup authentically Japanese. Try it...you'll love it! I got a lot of compliments from people who know good Japanese food. I made this as a soup to accompany Chicken Katsu & everyone loved it!
