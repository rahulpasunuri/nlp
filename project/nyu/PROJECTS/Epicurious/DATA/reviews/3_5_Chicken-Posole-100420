This was really good, whether is was authentic posole or not. I used Mexican flavor stewed tomatoes as suggested. I also added some chopped chipotles at the end because it could use an additional layer of flavor. Was super pretty for Xmas eve with purple shredded cabbage, green onions, and cilantro as toppings. Would def make this again.

I made a double batch of this last night, brought it to a small party, and none of it came home with me. People were borrowing the host's tupperware to take it home with them! Here are my suggested changes: Use Mexican style stewed tomatoes, chicken broth instead of water, cabbage instead of lettuce, double the amount of fresh oregano, and jalapeño jack to kick up the spice. To shed the chicken faster, gentle flatten the meat on a cutting board by pressing with large measuring cup before pulling it apart. Cuts the time in half.

This didn't taste much like Posole. We don't usually put tomatoes in posole here in New Mexico. Now I know why. it overpowers the flavor of the hominy. This tastes more like a spicy tomato and chicken soup. I think my regular pork Posole recipe, but made with chicken, would taste better.

Add more liquid - probably twice as much, add cumin, and serve over cabbage as some have said. Excellent, tasty, easy, and one to make again and again.

Inexpensive and easy, but for a richer taste, simmer it for 4 hours and add canned green chilis and chicken stock

This is quite good, but more traditional if you used shredded cabbage instead of lettuce and added chopped avocados and cilantro and eliminated the cheese.

Rating: 4
this is a fantastic weeknight recipe. fast and easy and lots of flavor. we make the following substitutions: use a store bought rotisserie chicken and substitute chicken broth for the water. the chicken and hominy makes a great filling for enchiladas the next day. it is also great just over rice.

Nice healthy dinner for a cold fall night... I used fire roasted tomatoes rather than stewed & used an extra jalapeno. This is one of those dishes that tastes great the first time and even better the next day.

This is delicious! I made turkey stock from t-day and then boiled 1 lb of bone/skinless thighs. I also added 1t of cumin and a bunch of fresh cilantro. My condiments were avocado, red onion, cilantro and cabbage. Did not use lettuce or cheese.

Born and raised in New Mexico this is as close to authentic without the New Mexican Green Chilis, poblano and jalapenos- you won't need the hot sauce!! Be Sure to make a double batch. The Guys love it!!

Love this recipe! It may not be authentic, but in the interest of always adding veggies where I can, I add sliced yellow summer squash, zucchini, and carrots. I also use shredded cabbage instead of lettuce.

Love this recipe! This has become a staple in our household, especially on cold days. I use the Mexican stewed tomatoes instead of plain stewed tomatoes and also add some chicken broth. I just buy a roast chicken from the grocery store and shred that up. It's a lot easier than having to boil the chicken breasts and shred them. Great recipe!

Very easy and very tasty. I made this for my beloved when he had a cold and he really liked it. Following the suggestions of others, I used up to 7 cups of 99% fat free chicken broth and water, only 3 skinless and boneless chicken breast halves (because they were SO big), and two 10 oz. cans of Ro-Tel and one 14.5 oz can of Fiesta brand Mexican stewed tomatoes in place of regular stewed tomatoes. I didn't use lettuce, cabbage or radishes (didn't have any) but topped each bowl with green onions, cheese and lots of cilantro. I thought the suggestions from others to use canned broth and bouillon cubes was a good idea because using boneless chicken does not make a very chicken-y broth.

For what it is: an easy mostly out of a can casual recipe--this cannot be beaten. I have been making this for several years and never get tired of it especially on cold stormy winter days. I do make some alterations--I use chicken broth (usually homemade from my freezer);I reduce the hominy and use an equal part canned corn; fresh oregano unless the plant is picked clean; a serrano pepper in place of the jalapeno; cabbage in place of lettuce--don't skip the radish, it's a good kick. For garnish I usually use avocado slices and sour cream. And it's even better the next day--and makes a great burrito if the broth goes faster than the chicken etc. It also freezes really well!!

This soup has become a big favorite in our house. It freezes beautifully and is helpful for using up the last bit of Thankgiving turkey.

I used Muir Glen fire-roasted tomatoes, added a dash of cayenne pepper and a packet of Goya Sazon seasoning. Topped with jack cheese and avocado slices. This was really good, even better the next day.

very yummy and so easy. I too used a rotisserie cooked chicken and the mixture of white and dark meat really worked well...and it was so quick to put together!

i'm giving this four forks because it is so easy and really tasty. i can't attest to authenticity, as i've only eaten pozole elsewhere once or twice, but i can say that this is delicious. i skip the lettuce and radishes and it's still great.

A strong three stars! My boyfriend loves posole, and he said it was the best he'd ever tasted! I followed suggestions to add cumin, which balanced the oregano (we found it to be a tad much). I also substituted chicken broth for 1/2 of the water in this recipe. Served up with lemon slices, the meal was hearty, filling, flavorful and fast. Another change we made was using crumbled cotija anejo cheese instead of the Monterey Jack. If using this cheese, I'd cut back a pinch on salt added to the recipe -- this cheese has a fairly salty taste of its own. Next time, I also might try a cup more cooking liquid.

Definitely add in cumin and if you can find it- Fiesta brand Menudo spices to taste. Just wonderful and great served with tamales at Christmas-time or Three Kings dinner along with your three King Cake!

Used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store in place of the chicken breasts--think use of dark and light meats really improved the flavor. Also used the menudo seasoning other reviewers have suggestedand dried blue corn posole instead of canned hominy--much better if you can get posole in your area.

3 and a half forks. Much better than you would think you can get by opening a couple of cans. Great weeknight meal. Added cumin and used Rotel mexican style tomatoes.

This recipe definitely passed all expectations. It was flavorful, filling and a recipe I would make over and over again. I did follow some of the suggestions of the other reviewers such as using "el sabor". I also used boiled pork along with the chicken. I highly recommend this recipe.

I came down with a cold the evening I was going to make this recipe. It was wonderfully filling and soothing and spicy enough for me to taste despite my stuffy nose. Was too tired to chop up the cabbage, radishes and green onion. Next time I make this I would probably use up to 4 more cups water...I like it more soupy. Probably use a combination of white/dark meat next time. Also, I used the mexican recipe stewed tomatoes and omitted the jalapeno. Stirred in a spoonful of my mom's homemade chile piquin sauce. Highly recommend this recipe...sick or not!

This recipe is very easy. I did alter the recipe a little. I added a little more water and instead of 2 cans of stewed tomatoes I used one and added one can of Las Palmas chili sauce. I also added a about 1/2 tbsp of menudo seasoning that you get in any grocery store. Adding the chicken after about 30 minutes and allowing the whole soup to simmer together for at least an additional 90 minutes brings all the flavors together nicely. I omitted the lettuce and radishes and just used the shredded Monterey Jack and a little lemon juice to taste. My husband and in-laws devoured it and have requested this meal several times in the 2 weeks since I first offered it to them.

This is a GREAT recipe -- very easy and delicious. Plus, it's the perfect casual party food! Can anybody reccomend another one dish meal similar to this one? My brother-in-law is coming into town, and I made posole for his last visit --so I need something new. Help!

So incredibly easy and delicious! I didn't think it would be that great honestly, but it was definitely something I'll be making again.

This one goes in the "I don't have time to cook but want something phenomenal" file. When my spouse says "This is MARVELOUS", he isn't kidding, as he doesn't say it often. I left out the cabbage/lettuce, radishes, jalapenos and green onion garnish, and just stuck with recipe and garnished with Monterey Jack cheese. The only substitution was in place of one teaspoon of oregano, I put in 1/2 teaspoon cumin and 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt. Also used Mexican recipe stewed tomatoes, which had cumin, garlic and jalapeno already added. What a great company dish this would make. Serve with the Cheddar Cornmeal Scones on this site, a green salad and some Corona Extra, Modelo Negro or margaritas and you have a meal fit for anyone! I'll also try it over rice but suspect it will be better with cornbread of some sort to mop up all those wonderful juices. Contrary to other reviews, I didn't find it too soupy at all. Perfect!

Rating: 3
What an easy and tasty dish! I made this for a party and received rave reviews, including from 2 fellow Mexicans. This was more soupy than other posole I've had, but I'm not complaining because it wasn't a very hard dish to make. I added a few teaspoons of chopped cilantro which added some flavor. In the future, I would add lime wedges as well as heated corn tortillas. I ommitted the lettuce, radishes, and cheese but it was fine without it.

Delicious & easy. I used the menudo spice mix and took the SLOW cooking suggestion, and loved this recipe. I got so anxious to try it, I forgot to use the cabbage and radishes I'd bought! I did slice a nice ripe avocado into the bowl, however... heavenly.

I made this for a dinner party the other night. I made more than enough to feed 8 people, but by the end of the night there wasn't a bite left. The key to this recipe (in my opinion), is SLOW cooking. I made the dish the night before the party, when I woke up the next morning I put the pot on the stove and cooked the posole ALL day long over very low heat. By the time dinner rolled around, it was perfect!

Oh, man, was this ever good!!! Have made posole before with pork; this was best I've ever had. Mine was a bit "soup-y," so I added a can of corn. Served with a jalapeno cornbread. Question: anyone else have any go-with ideas? Rice? What would be traditional?

My family is a traditional Mexican family and has been making Pozole for the Holidays since I was a little girl (not that we make the most authentic recipes ... they just taste really good), so as a taster, I feel I am well qualified to comment on this recipe. I rated this recipe "like it, don't love it" because I needed to doctor it up a little for my taste. Once done, it was absolutely delicious. I used chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken because they are easier to shred and already have the bone/skin removed (plus, less fat). To compensate for flavor, I added a couple cubes of Knorr brand "el sabor" chicken flavoring (you can find it in the Mexican food section of any grocery store). Next, season as you go because in the end the dish needs a lot of salt. Lastly, I left lime wedges for the guests to use, in addition to the other condiments.... and make sure to use cabbage instead of lettuce. It holds up better. The tang of the lime wedges adds an extra punch that the dish seemed to be lacking. One last thing ... my sister-in-law makes posole using Menudo spices (it is already packaged in single use packets in the Mexican food section of the grocery isle) in place of the dried oregano. Hers is the best in the family by far, which is hard to admit since all of us women tend to compete to out-do eachother from year to year at Thanksgiving or Christmas with this dish.

This posole was so good we made it one weekend and couldn't wait to make it again the next. I'd never had anything like it but Dave always told me how good his aunt's was. He said it was just like back home when we tasted it. We used cabbage instead of lettuce, regular white onions instead of green and left off the cheese.

This was my first time to eat posole. I liked the recipe very much because it is very simple and very good. Adding the lettuce, onions, cheese, etc., is a must. Although this does require some time to cook, it is not something you have to stay with. This is easy to make and good to eat. I will make this one again.

I enriched the flavor with a couple of sliced garlic cloves and used the Mexican style stewed tomatoes. I think that using thighs would give it even more rich and hearty flavor.

We first tried this soup in Mexico; Your recipe was very close. We absolutely love it. There are never leftovers! We serve it with bowls of radishes, onions, cheese etc. and everyone adds as they eat.
