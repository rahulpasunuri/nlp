This recipe gets a three as written but it can become the jumping off point to a four. I make more of a clammy bloody mary sauce by adding horseradish and an extra dash or 10 of tabasco. I have successfully added at different times: chopped celery, scallops, and even squid. Once I even added a aplash of vodka and my husband loved it. I never make it the same way twice!

I usually don't disagree with my epicurious.com colleagues when they rate a dish this highly, but this time I beg to differ. It just was nothing special. I do think that the clamato (which includes corn syrup) was too sweet and that ruined it for me. I might try next time to do the alternative method with clam juice and tomato juice, which would cut the sweetness. All in all, just ok, not great.

Excellent, refreshing seafood cocktail. Mexican cocktails are supposed to be thinner than the American version. I skipped the Tabasco and added finely chopped fresh jalapenos. Serve with saltines and a SPOON.

What a great recipe! The taste reminds us of ceviche and gazpacho. It's so simple to make. I added red bell peppers and it makes it naturally sweet and gives it the extra crunchiness.

It is not only delicious it's also eye pleasing! I made this last night for a group of 7 girlfriends, and everyone asked for the recipe. I recommend preparing the sauce earlier in the day, refrigerate as other readers indicated and then add the fresh crab, shrimp and avocado just before serving. The only change I made was that I used 2 teaspoons of Tabasco sauce and equal amounts of crab and shrimp.

This is delicious! I have served it on several occasions both for my family and for company. It works well as a first course or as a main dish. I prepare it exactly as written and love the combination of fresh flavors. If you make it ahead, I recommend waiting to add the seafood and avocado until just before serving, otherwise the shrimp and crab turn very pink from steeping in the tomato juice. A perfect summer dish!

This dish is one of my all time favorite things in life! So, so, so, so GOOD! FYI, I usually double the recipe and use 1 tsp of green Tabasco and 1 tsp of red hot sauce (Cholula, Tapatio, etc.).

Rating: 4
This is one of my all time favorite recipes. I serve it as a first course for a Mexican meal and it always receives rave reviews. I make the sauce the day before and add the seafood and avos just before serving. If you add the shrimp too early they get rubbery. I also add small ripe olives which makes it even more tasty.

I made this for a party with ~50 people. I followed a few previous posts and decreased the amount of Clamato juice (instead of using 12 cups, I used ten). Otherwise I followed the recipe as it reads, making adjustments to accommodate a large group. I used 4 lbs. of frozen shrimp (thawed on paper towels) and 2 lbs. crab. Overall, this was the hit of the party. Everyone loved it and wanted seconds; sadly there were none to offer. Just FYI, I made the Clamato base one day and added the seafood and avocado the next day. Easy crowd pleaser and a no-brainer.

This is great. I DOUBLED recipe and used 1 3/4 cup Clamato and only 1/4 cup ketchup and changed Tabasco to 3 teaspoons. Otherwise just doubled the other ingredients. You can always add more Clamato if you want it soupy. From Costco I get their crab that comes in a container in the fridge section, 16 oz. Excellent crab. Make early to blend flavors. Kathy

Great recipe. I always make ahead so the shrimp can marinate and take in the flavors. I have added fresh minced horseradish in place of the hotsauce and it is clean and fresh.

Made this for a Mexican Feista Dinner Party and it was a HUGE hit. I followed other reviews and cut WAY back on the Clamato juice. Reduced to 1/4 cup total, substituted Chili Sauce instead of Ketchup and increased the Tabasco and added horseradish sauce. Served with Triscuts and Tortilla chips; was the hit of the party. This is a refreshing alternative to Shrimp cocktail.

I should add that I used a little extra ketchup and some left over store bought cocktail sauce to thicken it. I also added extra crab.

This was a yucky, watery seafood gazpacho that I could not finish. I poured the leftovers down the drain and would not make again.

As other readers found, this recipe was a great success when I brought it to a Mexican buffet. It is very soupy; can cut down on Clamato juice and use full amount of ketchup. I also just used medium sized shrimp; steamed them; and cut them in half. Added chopped celery with the chopped avocado at the last minute. No crab.

Rating: 3
I followed the advice of the other reviewers and limited the amount of ketchup. I also kicked it up by adding a bit of horseradish. The only reason it isn't four forks is because the it is a bit on the runny side. I was hoping it would be a bit thicker. I also added celery and cucumbers and the crunch was good.

Very good and easy to make. Tastes better the next day when the flavors have had a chance to integrate. I would make it and keep the avocado out until ready to eat.

Incredibly delicious! I use more ketchup because I like it just a little bit thicker and add lots of cilantro! I also use large cooked & chopped fresh shrimp & lots of them. There are NEVER any leftovers when I serve this!

Second attempt, second review. I believe I got it right this time, at least for my taste. Prepare as written (although I use only shrimp) except: use only 1T of Heinz Organic ketchup for the barest hint of sugar and add 1T of Sriracha chili/garlic sauce, as well as the Tabasco. Perfecto. My husband and I can't get enough of this stuff.

Rating: 3
This was very tasty. I feel tomato completely obliterates the flavor of crab, so used only shrimp. My thought is that it needs a splash of olive oil and a bit of minced jalapeno. I initially planned to omit the ketchup as a previous reviewer suggested, but I decided to try it with Heinz Organic. Tasted fine, but the ketchup added a bit too much sweetness for my taste. I would omit it next time. I topped mine with a tablespoon of Crema Mexicana--yum.

Rating: 3
The ketchup should be omitted, or used far more sparingly than indicated (if you absolutely insist on using it). If you really need something to thicken up the mixture, maybe add a small amount of cocktail sauce but the ketchup addition is disgusting. It really does better if you consider it more of a gazpacho with seafood in it. After figuring that out, I've had a lot of compliments on this dish! I use Spicy V-8 instead of plain tomato juice or clamato to kick it up a bit more.

Oh, I should mention that I used medium shrimp (not salad shrimp), and omitted the crab completely. (See below comment)...

Absolutely delicious! I made this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit. I added diced cucumber, celery, and a jalepeno pepper for heat. Also, I tossed the raw shrimp with cumin, corriander, chile de arbol, and a squeeze of lime juice and sauteed them in olive oil before chopping. So good!

What a tragic waste of beautiful lump crab meat and large shrimp! One of the worst recipes I've ever tried here. My entire family was sad that we didn't enjoy the seafood in a better way. :(

We loved it... loved it! so refreshing too. I made it as written but due to the lack of Clamato Juice here in England, used canned crab and the brine that it came with. Also, if you add some diced cucumber and some celery it is a lovely lunch time salad.

This recipe is absolutely fabulous! I have made it several times (and am making it again tonight!). When I made it for a party, it was a huge success and several people took the recipe and made it themselves. I use larger shrimp and chop them up but otherwise the recipe is just perfect!

This is a great summer app. I have served this twice, and the second time I made some changes. Instead of the clamato and clam juice, I used bloody mary mix w/horseradish. I also omitted the crab because for the expense, it gets lost and isn't missed. I served this in large wine glasses w/a couple tortilla chips stuck on top.

This is absolutely FABULOUS. I loved it and so did everyone else at the party. I made a double batch and put it in a bowl and let everyone serve themselves. It was gone in no time. Has a great flavor. I am making it again today. YUMMY!

simple, easy and delicious - the only changes i made was using medium size shrimp that i briefly marinated in a little cumin, garlic and lime and then grilled - since i had the grill on i also tossed on the onion plus a couple of tomatoes before chopping - to continue the smoky theme i used the chipotle tabasco - turned out wonderful - great summer dish - :)

I used approximately 1/2 - 3/4 a pound of medium sized shrimp that I cooked in garlic. After it cooled, I roughly chopped it. That along with the crabmeat thickened the cocktail just enough so that the texture was almost exactly like what I had daily in Veracruz. So delicious.

Just adding my enthusiasm to the collection here - the recipe was A+ - easy, impressive, delicious -i added a full pound of fresh shrimp that i cooked myself but otherwise made the recipe as written - it is so fresh light and filling, no one really wanted the main course after this appetizer - I liked it so much i took a picture of it - check it out! http://hollys-food.buzznet.com/user/?id=1356796

Now when I make this, I double the recipe. A single batch is never enough! Mexican seafood cocktails are always "soupy", but I serve with sides of extra cilantro, chopped onion, etc. to people can add more to taste.

At our house we do a more informal and fun version of basically this same recipe. I put a serving of seafood and clam juice in each cocktail glass, then arrange the ketchup, onions, cilantro, hot sauces (my husband is Mexican, he likes extra zing), chilis, avocado, and limes in little bowls in the center of the table, so we can all dig in and make our own to taste.

This is light and easy to make. I used large shrimp, no crab (allergies). It made a satisfying hot weather supper for us. I think I'd like a bit more spice in it, however. My husband and I love spicy food.

I made the sauce exactly as written and thought it was wonderful. I used 1/2 lb of medium shrimp that I cooked myself. I had a one pound can of crabmeat from Trader Joes (that canned crab that comes from the refrigerator is very good - one of my fish loving friends thought it was fresh when I served it to her) and I just kept adding crab until the thickness looked right to me, but probably used just a little over 1/2 pound. Leftovers were very tastey on tortilla chips.

I also used larger shrimp - poached it myself (it makes a big difference if you cook it fresh rather than buying precooked shrimp). I added a bit more lime juice - just personal preference. It was a huge hit with my hubby. I will definitely make this again for guests.

This is wonderful--easy, simple to serve either as a light supper or first course. I added a LOT more seafood to the sauce--1 lb. lump crabmeat, 1 lb. large shrimp. It might have needed a teeny bit more sauce (maybe another 1/2 of recipe), but it was not soupy. I think it's pretty easy to play around with the consistency in this recipe depending on your desired outcome by simply adjusting the amount of seafood.

Delicious, refreshing, quick/easy and a nice change from regular shrimp cocktail. I found it to be too runny/liquidy (as the recipe intended) and would prefer it to be a little thicker, so next time will reduce the clamato juice to one cup and/or increase the amount of seafood. Very pretty served in large martini glasses.

This is a great recipe and, as others have mentioned, really only takes a few minutes. I used large shrimp (almost a pound for four adults) and lump blue fin crab meat. Truly excellent and the hit of the party! I followed this up with the chile relleno tart and the chicken with spicy tomato sauce - all were happy!
