These sound delicious. I've baked turnovers before and look forward to trying this recipe out. I did want to mention that I plan on peeling and chopping my appples into small pieces, adding some cinnamon, butter and sugar to them and excluding the water. I'll cook the apple mixture in a microwavable bowl w/ lid on it for about 3-4 min. (stirring half way through) This will makes it faster and easier for me to make. I'm wanting my apple mixture to still be a bit firm when they're done. As for the pastry part, that's a no-brainer for me (I'll just do my best :-). I also will plan on cooking the turnovers in a 375* oven, for 8-10 min. while watching them closely. And as another writer suggested, will try mine with some vanilla ice cream!!!Yum. Thanks to all other reviewers for your recipe insights. With them you can't go wrong.

This recipe was a bit involved for the outcome, yet it was delicious. I used the regular Pepperidge Farm puff pastry instead of all-butter. Based on other reviews, I added cinnamon, nutmeg, and some ground cloves. I cut back on the sugar. Golden Delicious apples weren't available at my local Whole Foods Market this time of year, so I used a combination of Granny Smith and Gala apples. I left the filling very chunky and cooled it quickly on an ice bath. The pastry dough wasn't easy to roll out even using some additional flour, and next time I'd add some water to the beaten egg so it would brush on in a lighter manner. Used a coarser turbinado sugar sprinkle instead of the superfine. My turnovers didn't rise much, and also started to brown at 15 minutes. I took them out at about 20 minutes total. Next time, I'd lower the starting temp from 400F to 375F. The turnovers looked pretty rustic which was ok with me. They tasted great. The filling was just a little too tart for me. Since I had cut back on the suggested sugar to about half, I would probably add a bit more sugar to the filling next time. My husband liked them and said he'd be happy if I made them again.

Really good and really easy. I'd just do 2 things differentlly next time: add more sugar to the filling and add some cinnamon so they're more apple pie-like (just a personal preference). In addition, it didn't take as long to bake as mentioned in the recipe -- mine browned and were done about 10 min earlier.

Did a few things differently.Other cooks mentioned they ended up with mush, so, instead of cooking them on top of the stove, I baked the apples. Only partly crushed them with a masher. Perfection. I rolled the pastry (which was very easy to work with) super thin and baked the turnovers for about half the time. 8 mins at 400 and then 6 mins at 350. They turned out wonderfully and were gobbled up right away. Will definitely make these again.

As with any turnover or pie, one should really spend some time getting the filling perfectly to their liking in terms of sweetness and spice...it's time well spent. I used all gravensteins, which were a bit on the tart side, so i added more sugar than called for. I also added cinnamon and a pinch of Maldon sea salt for good measure. On the recommendation of other reviewers, I sought out all-butter puff pastry from a local specialty store, which was terribly difficult to work with. Between the pastry that adhered itself and the filling that spilled out when i pinched the edges, my cutting board looked like a two year old had been there. I was distraught at the barely recognizable triangles I managed to get into the oven. Through the miracle of heat applied to pastry brushed with an egg wash, though, the finished product was just beautiful, if not perfect...rustic, flakey and wonderfully flavored. i made a second batch using grocery store puff pastry, and although it was easier to work with, I also preferred the flavor of the good stuff.. I'm going to make more of these so that I will have some in the freezer, ready for a quick pop in the oven to enjoy throughout the fall and winter... YUM.

I was REALLY disappointed with this recipe. I had fresh apples from the apple orchard, got the puff pastry, etc. I found the interior of the turnover was like applesauce mush - and no real flavor. The pastry was fine - good, even, and cooked well. But the inside of this turnover was like eating bland babyfood - and I LOVE apple turnovers.

I forgot to mention I baked mine in the middle of the oven and they were cooked after only 15mins at 400F - I did roll my pastry a little thinner so that it would be crispier.

These were super easy to make - I added a dash of cinnamon but kept everything else the same (I used a quality puff pastry - Careme). I served these with some vanilla ice cream and hubby loved them - simple but satisfying.

I did not like this recipe at all. However, my picky husband did so I gave it 2 forks. I would definitely not make this again. The recipe calls for baking in the bottom third of the oven. My turnovers were burning on the bottom within the first 15 minutes of baking. I did not move to the top rack as they would have burned completely. The pastry was so thick that you couldn't even taste the filling.

Delicious, easy. . . a standby for holidays.

I didn't feel that there was anything special about this recipe. It makes a decent turnover, but I've had much better.

These were delightful! I added a dash of cinnamon to the apples. There isn't any all butter puff pastry where I am, but the shortening ones still tasted great. I can only imagine how much better it would be if I had the good stuff handy. It is a bit of fuss for just 8 turnovers, but they really are good - I might have eaten half of them fresh out of the oven...

Very easy to make. I halved the filling recipe and it was the perfect amount. I also added a bit of cinnamon to the filling.

I made this twice, once with all butter puff pastry and once with the cheaper version. The good stuff made a world of difference. Mine kept fine in the fridge for a couple of days.

I used the Artisan puff pastry from Trader Joes. Next time I won't go through the trouble of trying to roll out the pastry, didn't think it needed it. I can compare these to the turnovers I just bought at the french bakery in town. They truly were identical. I couldn't help myself and addes just a sprinkling of cinammon.

Based on reviews about having too much filling, I bought double the puff pastry and ended up using all the filling and pastry, making about 20! Thankfully, I had neighbors over and they helped us eat most of it. I like that the filling isn't sweet and next time, I'll probably add even LESS sugar. As other reviews have said, don't overfill because it's harder to make the triangles nice and even. They have the best flavor and texture the day you make them. I had 3 leftover the next day and by then, they were a bit soggy.

Loved it, particularly because it wasn't overly sweet. Next time, I'll only make half as much filling, because I had a lot left over. Don't give into the temptation to overfill these; they are best with just a thin pocket of apple at the center.

I made this recipe at the weekend. It was 'ok' but nothing special and certainly not worth using a $10 block of pastry for (I used Defours). On the bright side, Defours pastry was amazing and I will absolutely buy this again if I need good quality puff pastry. Felt a bit wasted on this dish... I made the mistake of using the apple sauce when it was still warm (don't do it!) but recipe still came out ok. I didn't egg wash and I don't think it mattered - the turnovers still looked fine without being shiny. Make sure you have people around if you make these as they do not keep well - about a day max. Best eaten on same day as made. Also - there was lots of apple left over and I made the full 9 plus had apple left over (about 1 cup).

This turnovers look spectacular. They were really easy to make although assembly takes a little time if u want perfect triagles but its totally worth it. I served them warm with vanilla bean ice cream, and everyone rated it 5!!

Amazing, my family loved it. The only problem I had was putting them together, probably because I filled them up too much, but other than that, everything worked out well. They looked and tasted delicious. Perfect portions too. I garnished them with cinnamon, that was a nice touch.

I can't believe how easy and delicious this recipe was. I bought the puff pastry from trader joe's. I had a hard time folding the turnovers because I overstuffed them with filling, so they looked pretty mangled when I put them on the sheet to bake. But once the puff pastry rose in the baking, you couldn't even tell. They looked just like the picture, and they tasted as good as they looked!
