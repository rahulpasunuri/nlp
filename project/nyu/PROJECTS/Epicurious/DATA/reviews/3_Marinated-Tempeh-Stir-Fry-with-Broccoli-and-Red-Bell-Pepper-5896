After reading other reviews, I used low sodium soy, halved the soy and replaced with water for the marinade. Also tripled the water added for the sauce and threw in some fresh orange juice to cut the salt. I am a lover of things salty and this dish was still too salty! I wonder if Bon Appetit tested this recipe prior to printing it or if there is a major mistake in the reprint onto Epicurious. Horrible.

I had already added regular soy sauce to the marinade before I read the reviews, so I regrouped by also adding an equal part orange juice and a little water to cut the salt. To add extra vegetables and stretch the recipe, I added some french style green beans, a little yellow onion, sliced, and also some yellow bell pepper. With these modifications, the recipe was really good and made a nice dinner served over jasmine rice.

Doubled the honey in hopes of diminishing the salt factor. Still too salty. Next time might cut the soy with hoisen sauce, or just try a different recipe.

I had no ginger and green onion but it turned out fine. It's good served with brown rice medley. I used orange bell pepper and that was tasty.

This was great. We had no tempeh, so I substituted New York steak thinly sliced and stir fried just until browned. My boyfriend loved it, and I would definitely make it again!

Recipe was okay. I think it would have better if I used light soy sauce as the recipe calls for (rather than regular soy sauce which I already had on my shelf). I prefer tempeh over tofu so I might make this again.

On second though, this is too salty. I thought my husband, who salts everything, would like it, but even he won't eat it. Decided not to make it again.

Made this recipe as given. Pretty tasty. I never salt anything, so it was a tad salty for me, even with the low sodium soy sauce. I would make this again, maybe tweak the amount of soy sauce.

Chinese soy sauce comes in light and dark versions, and has to do with intensity of flavor rather than the sodium amount. It has to do with the type of dish you are cooking. *See The Ten Thousand Chinese Recipe Cookbook for more information.

Very good recipe for Tempeh! All of my marinade was absorbed into the Tempeh before cooking, so I mixed up just about a tablespoon worth to add. I was using the low-salt soy sauce as recommended and didn't think it was too salty. I didn't have rice vinegar, so I used cider vinegar. Still good.

It was awful. I could not eat it. Too salty. I used Braggs Aminos as recommended by another & it didn't help. Will never make again.

I also didn't use lite soy sauce, and it was toxic! Now I know. Other than that, it was good.

Best tempeh stir fry I've had!

This was tasty but I used regular soy and it was too salty - now I know to use low salt. Something about the curious texture of tempeh makes me crave this dish, wonder if tofu would work as well?

MMM! I agree with the other cook, the amount of sauce was perfect. The flavours were excellent, and for anyone on a low-carb kick, the dish was surprisingly filling without any rice or pasta sidekick. Agreed, we need more tempeh recipes on epicurious!

I found this recipe surprisingly excellent! I thought it had the perfect amount of liquid- It was not smothered in sauce but well coated. Did not find it salty w/ the lite soy sauce. I did find it a little sweet from the amount of honey, but this is probably a personal taste issue. Overall, great recipe! Can't believe this is the only tempeh recipe on epicurious!!!!

Everyone who complains about the high salt in soy sauce,try "Braggs Aminos" availble in health food stores. So much better for you, much lower is salt.

I haven't made this in a while, but have 2-3 times before and always thought it excellent! I would make definitely make it again. I didn't find it to salty, but in general always use low sodium soy sauce so that may be why.

This dish was alright. If I were to make this again, I don't think that I would marinate the tempeh at all. The tempeh began to dissolve a little upon cooking. I did cut the amount of soy sauce (because of others' comments that it becomes too salty). It is very pretty with the broccoli and bell pepper. Tempeh is such a worthy protein that I'll definitely try to rework this recipe to make it better...maybe next time a little bit of hoisin sauce would pull it all together...

Doubled the amount of tempeh and sauce as we were having it as a main dish, and added snow peas, asparagus (cut diagonally into short pieces)and a little zucchini. We all liked it and the 6-year old absolutely inhaled it, to my shock! It was a little salty (must get that low-sodium soy sauce) but that could be because I added a little veg broth as there isn't quite enough liquid. Overall, not truly great but definitely a keeper.

This was really excellent! I doubled it to use up all the tempeh in my 8 oz package. That makes a LOT of food, but I always think stir-fry is good leftover. I used regular tamari soy sauce and doubled all the sauce ingredients but the cornstarch. It tasted pretty salty, so I added a few tablespoons of vegetable stock. Turned out great!

Delicious w/5-grain tempeh from SoyBoy!

Overall, we enjoyed this recipe. I did not find it too salty, nor did the tempeh soak up all the sauce. It did seem to need a little more sauce, however. It also improved greatly with the addition of serrano peppers and sliced onions.

I've made this a couple of times now and I really like how quick and easy it is. Tempeh definitely has a strong flavor and texture so I would be careful about making it for someone. Also, be sure to use light (or low sodium) soy sauce. I'm a salt lover and with reg. soy sauce it was too salty even for me.

I wasn't crazy about this dish either. The tempeh was a bit too salty because it soaked up the marinade. Overall, this isn't a bad recipe; it's just that there are so many other things you could make that would turn out better.

I was very dissapointed in this recipe. The tempeh soaked up all the marinade so there was no sauce and the dish was much too salty. Maybe it would be better with tofu. Regardless, in it's present form I would not make this dish again.

I make this dish with extra firm tofu. It is one favorite meals . I add a little of fresh minced hot red pepper to the oil when heating it. It gives it extra pizzaz. I use the sauce when making a stir fry as well with all kinds of veggies & tofu served over rice. This makes for a great healthy meal. Yummy!!!

instead of adding broccoli, I added squash and red and yellow peppers-which makes the dish visually pleasing. I also added cashews on top before serving it on rice. great dish-it actually tastes better the next day once all the flavors have melded together.

While the marinade gave the tempeh a very nice flavor, when I prepared this dish, it ended up with virtually no sauce, it was as if the tempeh soaked it all up, so the entree ended up quite dry. If I make it again, I would double the sauce, although I would worry this might make it too salty.

Used tofu, and added purple onion & diagonally-sliced carrot to the saute... all over brown rice. If only the movie had been as good...

This was super! I am now a fan of tempeh. The marinade was very flavorful and worked well with the honey and cornstarch as a sauce. Can't wait to make it again!

I served this with chicken instead of tempeh, and that worked very well. I'm a huge fan of ginger when it comes to stirfry and in retrospect, I wish I'd added even more. It's a great second course to the Hot and Sour Soup with Ginger (which I highly recommend).

This dish was quick and easy to prepare, and quite tasty! Spicy, satisfying and delicious! I will make it again, perhaps adding additional vegetables to the stir-fry.

The marinade is one of the best I've ever made - it compliments the tempeh, which absorbs the flavors like a sponge. Perfect for vegans (and non-vegans)!

This was a delicious recipe. The tempeh absorbed the flavor of the spices very well. What a great substitute for meat. I served it over brown rice. I will substitute tempeh for meat more often after trying this!!
