This is a quick and easy recipe with an unusual and delicious result. It would be great for entertaining, as all parts can be completed ahead of time and the dessert just assembled at the last minute. I want to try this again with pineapple instead of mandarins, but I think you could do this with almost any canned fruit you have around - peaches, apricots, etc. Yum!

These were so easy and delicious. The only change I made was to use marscapone instead of regular cream cheese. Next time I'm going to try it using different fruits, maybe raspberries with chocolate or bananas with caramel.

This is delicious, quick, and easy, and definitely worthwhile. I watch the phyllo closely in the oven and I actually cut it first. I ended up having to make my Chinese 5-spice mix but it worked out fantastic. This is actually the second time I have made this and it gets rave reviews.

This was the perfect dessert to serve for a Christmas dinner. I gave it 4 forks because it was still an amazing treat even though I burned the phyllo. I will definitely make it again and pay closer attention to cooking progress.

Very good! Had a little trouble baking the philo. I baked the second batch less than the recommended time on the box and it turned out good. Filling was delicious.

We totally enjoyed this recipe. I am not a lover of fennel but it transformed this dessert into a foreign delight. I followed the recipe as written and thought the filling and phyllo was perfect. The colors were beautiful and the dish was extremely attractive.

The orange cream was a bit too thin, but otherwise delicious!

I made this for New Year's Eve dinner and it was a big hit. I used a chinese ten spice instead of the recommended five spice. The spice combined with the sugar and butter created a very complex yet tasty combination of flavors in the phylo. Be forwarned; while this dessert appears light and creamy, it is definitely rich. I would recommend using a low fat cream cheese instead to cut down on the heaviness of the filling.
