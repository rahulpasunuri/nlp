Uh, this first-time rice pudding cook could have used some explanation that this recipe is specifically for kids and the consistency will be undesirable for adults.

to missbrattified...ya,ok, i get that the rice absorbs the milk before it is fully cooked, but this recipe calls for cooked rice. i liked it (with a couple of personal tweaks) as a great, quick and easy way to use up overcooked or left over rice.

I really didn't even want to give this one fork, as the recipe isn't even workable. First of all, the milk disappears well before the rice is cooked, so you have to keep adding milk or the rice would scorch--not cook. Secondly, what does eventually turn out is a gluey, glutinous, tasteless MESS--almost as thick as a soft DOUGH--and I ended up throwing it all in the trash. Epicurious should remove this recipe from their site--it's THAT bad. It's not a matter of taste--it just doesn't work. I will not make this again.

This rice pudding is pretty tasty but the consistency is like glue. During the food processing is where the texture took a turn for the worst. If the baby is older than a year old, chances are, she or he will be able to handle the pudding without the blending in the food processor anyway. Also, I added a little vanilla for a little flavor.
