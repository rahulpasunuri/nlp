As far as I am concerned, this dish has no redeeming value. The tast was all off, it was too spicy as written. A waste of good shrimp, sausage and eggs.

Like the other reviewers, I thought this was a very nice dish. It was easy to throw together and you could easily substitute ingredients. I served over rice. Also, really try and make the Oeufs au Plat. They are delicious over this.

Really terrific. I followed earlier directions from other users and upped the green onion to compensate for using regular (good quality) tube sausage. Also omitted bell pepper... don't like them.

I disagree with Oya... everyone loves shrimp and it certainly makes the dish! This was fantastic over stone grits. I highly recommend.

I thought this was excellent. I used a little more tomatos and a little more chicken broth. Also a tsp of cayenne and served it over corn bread. AWESOME!!

I would omit the shrimp. Not everyone likes seafood, some are allergic and the combo of shrimp & eggs did not appeal to me. I love green onion sausage but it can be hard to find. A substitution is pork 'salt and pepper' sausage (not in skins). Just add green onions and a small sauteed garlic clove.
