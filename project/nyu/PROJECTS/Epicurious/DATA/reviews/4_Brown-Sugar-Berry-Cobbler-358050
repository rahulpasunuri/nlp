I made this cobbler for Easter. It was easy and delicious. I will make it again soon. I made one change to the recipe- I used 3 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch because I didn't want an overflow to occur in my oven and don't like watery desserts. It worked out very well.

Easy to prepare. Tastes delicious. I used an 11"x17" dish which worked fine. I think anything smaller would leave a mess. I used whipped cream with a stabilizer because ice cream wasn't practical for my event. Will make again. I would like to try nectarines or peaches with blackberries, possibly.

Yum yum! Quick, easy and delish! Just make sure to use the right size pan, or your oven will have berry goo all over the bottom like mine does now.

Great Recipe! Instead of using fresh berries I ended up using frozen berries and served it with vanilla ice cream, turned out great. Very fast and easy to make. Will definitely make it again.

Very good and not all that difficult, either. I think the topping was almost *too* much and overshadowed the fruit. Delicious warmed up with ice cream!
