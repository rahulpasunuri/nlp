Simple but good. Particularly tasty with Broiled Chicken and Artichokes, also on Epicurious.

Quick, easy and very tasty. Will definitely make it again.

I made this last night with some short grain brown rice (non-converted) and it was excellent. I have made rice in this manner many times before (sauté the onions and spices and cook with chicken broth) but this rice came out especially good. I think it was the portions of spices? I was a little worried about the white pepper& it made the sauté mixture smell a bit peculiar, but it tasted great. So now I have a great rice recipe AND a new appreciation for the white pepper thats been sitting in my spice rack since who knows when! :-)

Used basmati rice and either butter or olive oil. Both were good Agreed that it was odd to hear complements for a simple rice, but the reviews were good. It's now part of the rotation.

Pleasant surprise to hear, "wow Mom this is great rice" I don't think it was because I am usually a lousy cook! I, too, used basmati and 1/2'd the recipe. Used herbs de provence for seasoning (instead of salt/thyme/pepper).

Don't see the fuss. Just rice.

Although it seems weird to get so excited about rice, this was REALLY good. I used jasmine rice since that was the closest thing I had around. I think any longish grain rice would do. Incidentally, i liked this considerably better than the gumbo it was supposed to pair with.

As the name says, this was 'perfect rice'!! I prepared this along with the smothered chicken with mushroom gravy recipe from this site. I'm not much of a rice eater, but this rice was excellent!! The broth gives it just enough flavor.

Very good, simple side dish. Rice did not stick together. Yummy!

I usually use a rice cooker and was pleasantly surprised at the outcome of this recipe. I used basmati rice instead of converted. Good recipe.

We made this twice and it was really good. Also good reheated, a la fried rice. And actually, it was fine using regular rice, e.g. long grain, since we didn't have converted handy.

Wonderful. Easy. Delicious. And I didn't have converted rice so used basmati instead. Same cooking time.
