Made this for a large party since we have some vegan friends. Realized as I was dumping the pesto in that pesto has cheese. Duh! The recipe is tagged as vegan. Just beware. I thought the taste was so-so for the dish.

I substituted 8 oz.frozen chopped collard greens (yes!) for the rabe and orzo for the ditalini, and, as other reviewers suggested, cut back the broth to about 8 oz. Delicious! This will be a favorite for a "what to cook?" night.

Thought this was great. Felt like a bit of a cop-out just throwing in a jar of pre-made pesto, but it is a really quick way to throw something together with beans & greens. Good use for rapini, as well. I did add extra red pepper to make it spicy. Top with freshly-grated Parmesan and serve with a crusty bread.

This rececipe is awesome and quick! My DH hates Broccoli Rabe so I substituted fresh spinach and kicked up the crushed red pepper. I will definitely serve this one over and over.

My family LOVED this! I added a tsp of minced garlic to the vegetable broth while it was simmering and I did not need to use any of the reserved pasta water. We will make this over and over again.

I made a couple of modifications: by necessity I used broccolini instead of rabe; also used a whole box of ditalini, but reserved the extra half so the fiance could make his more hearty; lastly, I upped the pepper and finished with some fresh lemon juice. So easy, quick and comforting. This is a new favorite.

My very Italian boyfriend said, "This is a lot like what my grandmother used to make for us when I was growing up... if she had put pesto on it like this, I'd have asked for it more often!" In other words, this is quick, tasty, weeknight comfort food. Used homemade pesto, and next time will double the crushed red pepper. Yum!

This recipe was fast, easy, and tasted great! There was no broccoli rabe at the grocery store, so I used 1 lb of kale in its place. I also substituted pinot grigio for vinegar, and I omitted the red pepper, and it still tasted flavorful. I'd definitely recommend this recipe!

This was easy, fast, tasted great and seems pretty healthy. My only comment is that mine was a bit soupy, even without adding any pasta water. Next time I might cut back on the broth. But definitely a keeper.

good. nothing special, but easy and nutritious for a weekday meal. cook the rabe maybe 2 minutes. i made my own pesto. season CAREFULLY.

This was a flavorful, very easy dish, and made great leftovers. However, like another reviewer, I had my rabe turn to mush. I think the 5 minutes of cooking time the recipe suggests may be too much, especially if the rabe are tender. I browsed through some other recipes, and I saw some that said to cook the rabe for only 3 minutes.

I love this recipe. I've made it several times, pretty much as it's written. Substitutions I've made include: chicken instead of vegetable broth, since it's what I had on hand, chopping up some leftover Italian sausage and adding it with the pesto, and using about half of the red pepper called for. I also drizzle a little olive oil on each serving and pass grated parmesan. This is a quick, easy, nutritious week night meal. Leftovers are great, too.

I made this dish last night & my husband loved it! I used a homemade pesto that I had frozen & we thought it was very flavorful.

I added a few sundried tomatoes in with the pesto (in blender) and added pancetta at the beginning. Very Good.

This was a tasty and quick after work dinner. I used penne instead of ditalini and broccoli instead of broccoli rabe. I also added some cooked chicken when I combined the pasta with pesto and beans. Will make again.

I gave this recipe 3 forks because it is a creative way to use healthy broccoli rabe. However, I took reviewer suggestions to reduce the amount of pesto, and the result was quite bland. I salvaged it with the addition of high quality grated Pecorino Romano. One question to other readers...is there a way to keep the broccoli rabe from turning to mush? Or is this the way that vegetable is supposed to be enjoyed? Personally, I prefer my vegetables intact.

Really easy and delicious, although not exactly super-healthy/low calorie with all the pesto. Either way, it's a versatile dish that would be just as at home on a casual weeknight or at a dressier affair. Any small pasta will do and I replaced the veggie broth with chicken broth which was just fine. I also used about 6 oz of pesto from Trader Joes, and increased the chicken broth/pasta liquid just a bit. Very nice with a caprese salad, bread for dipping plus a great red wine. A beautiful meal.

Simple and excellent. I mistakenly bought a bunch (.22 lb) instead of a pound of broccoli rabe and added some frozen leaf spinach to increase the volume of greens. Also reduced the pesto to taste.

This was awesome, a great way to use broccoli rabe. I made it with macaroni instead of ditalini, which made it quite hearty. As good after several days in the fridge as when I made it. Healthy, easy, tasty, perfect.

This is the kind of dish that takes me back to my childhood. I've modified this one--I use my own pesto, and substitute good chicken broth to give it more flavor. Also at the end, I swirl in a little good quality extra virgin olive oil and grate some parmigiana reggiano on top. Delicious and simple.

We have made this recipe many times and will continue to do so. It is true that it is inexpensive, but somehow it WORKS really well. The vinegar is a must. Yum!!

Not the most exciting dish, but it is fast, cheap and easy. I added a little grated pecorino, and I used vegetable broth, but I suspect chicken would probably have more flavor.

This was a quick dish, but something about the flavor of it was off. I used a good quality gourmet pesto too, so I don't think that was the problem. Probably won't make again.

Fab-u-lous. I use gemelli instead of dialini and love the results. I also don't use the entire container of pesto and it's still very rich with flavor. It's a keeper.

I was happy to finally use the can of cannellini that's been in my cupboard for months, although some chicken would have been better. And I'm one that usually prefers non-meat dishes. This just wasn't anything too exciting.

Found this to be a tasty, satisfying, yet very easy meal. Will definitely do again, especially since my husband and 3 year old both liked it. Had to use broccolini, and added sprinkled shredded asiago. No problem with bitterness. I used the most gourmet looking/costing store bought pesto I could find, and champagne vinegar - not sure if that helped, but we loved it.

This dish ended up very bitter and un-edible. Perhaps it was the pesto (purchased), or the broccli rabe? I'm guessing it was probably the pesto, as I rarely have good experiences with purchased pesto. Other cooks seemed to have no problems with this dish being bitter, so perhaps it was just me.

Disappointing. Broccoli rabe was dismal, so I used fresh, small locally grown organic broccoli. Also could not find pasta called for, so I used some medium-small shells to hang on to the sauce. Perhaps my purchased pesto was the culprit, but I found it really bland and tasteless, and the vinegar addition seemed unnecessary. May try with homemade pesto and extra garlic & parmesan .

A delicious and inexpensive meal (less than $10). I didn't have any vegetable broth, so I used low sodium chicken broth and only used about 5 ounces of the pesto. Next I'll add a little more broccoli and use the vegetable broth.

Simple but delicious. I was making a roast pork tenderloin at the same time, so I added some stock and juices from the pork. It gave it a rich, wonderful taste. Don't skimp on the red pepper flakes, if you like it spicy,

Delicious, comfort food in a bowl. I topped with freshly grated asiago, and definitely use the pasta water and let the dish sit on a low burner for 15 or 20 minutes to let the flavors meld YUM!

Very easy and very tasty for a simple, hearty meal. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable, and I'd recommend going light on the pesto.

This dish is absolutely delicious. Warm, hearty, and comforting, it is a perfect winter meal. I added extra garlic and sprinkled grated pecorino romano on top of each serving, and found no lack of flavor. Definitely use the full half-cup of extra liquid and serve with warm bread to dip. As much as my gourmand boyfriend couldn't believe how delectable it was, I couldn't believe how easy it was to prepare!

Was disappointed as expected a much more flavorful result. Even added 2 extra cloves of garlic and it still seemed blah. A much much better recipe along these lines on this site is orecchiette with broccoli rabe and fried chick peas, which is outstanding.

After making whole slew of complicated things for a party this weekend, I needed something simple and healthy. This hit the spot. So easy, and not too heavy. I'm definatley going to do this one again.

This was quick, easy, and the sauce was a total yum. Broccoli rabe just doesn't happen to be one of my favorite veggies. If I do make it again, I will try it with another winter vegetable - for some reason kale sounds good. I also used whole wheat penne as the pasta, which went nicely with the beans and pesto.

My friend made this at her house for dinner and i loved it so much i looked the recipe up to make it at my house for my boyfriend. It's very good, simple and wonderful to come home to after a days work. My friend served it with a simple salad with goat cheese, walnuts and sliced appled over lettuce. This is getting added to my weekly rotation

I made a few changes ... used fresh prick kee noo (Asian Chile) and fresh, not canned beans. Also used dehydrated, salt free all natural vegie broth in liew of the canned stuff. It is a great recipe ... most I just read and discard as too 'artificial'

A great weeknight recipe! I agree about the pesto and used my homemade.

Delicious and easy to make. Cooked about 4 oz. of pancetta separately and added to the pot towards the end. Also, gradually add pesto taste regularly since pre-made pestos often have too much garlic.
