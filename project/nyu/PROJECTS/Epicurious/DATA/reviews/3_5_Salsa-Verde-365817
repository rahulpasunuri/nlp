Very fresh and herby. We had this alongside seared scallops, red potatoes, and steamed kale. 3 forks because it is a little oily and heavy, but that said, I plan to make it again this summer!

Whatever you do, don't leave out the anchovies. Great spread on just about anything. Adds a blast of freshness.
