This dish instantly became a favorite dish for that hurried meal after work. The sauce's flavor doesn't become complete until after it cooks with the fish so don't be dismayed at your first taste. We didn't have any anise so we used our Chinese 5-spice which seemed to work very well.

I'm actually reviewing the RECIPE, here; I have to confess I haven't yet made this interesting-sounding dish, but I expect it will have a playful complexity. So much of the turnout depends upon the quality of ingredients and deft hand and mind of the cook. Butto the point: I found the writing of this recipe among the best I've cruised through, so far. A glance will get you the gist of the thing. It's clear and direct, yet not dry. Four forks for the author!
