Pretty good....roasted the potatoes instead of boiling for ore flavor....not my favorite, but good and would make again.

I loved this recipe but made a few changes to it. I substituted a package of smoked salmon for the tuna I used nugget potatoes and grape (or cherry) tomatoes halved. I layer all ingredients on a platter in rows - tomatoes, potatoes, beans, eggs, olives and then salmon. I spooned in the chives and the capers into the salad dressing and then drizzled onto all the ingredients (aside from the green beans until it was served) I was able to make this 4 hours prior to a barbeque and it was devoured

Excellent, and everyone I serve this to agrees. I did increase the sugar to 1t of light brown sugar, used red new potatoes, substituted halved grape tomatoes and sliced the olives. The tuna needs to be packed in olive oil and don't bother to drain it. I've made this may times.

I made this dish when the veggies were in season at the farmer's market. It was the first dinner I ever cooked for my fiance, and we both loved it.

I made this without the tuna as a side dish. It was loved by all...I even got a round of applause from my guests when I placed it on the table...that was even before they had tried it!

This was a great salad. I bet it will be even better when all the vegies are in season this summer. The dressing is simple and very good. very filling too. My husband sometimes doesn't consider a salad a real full meal, but he really liked this one.

my sister-in-law made this for a family party and it was the hit of the night. She omitted eggs and added red onions it was delicious.

Wasn't sure that I'd like this recipe. The ingredients were a weird combo for me. I ended up loving it. Quick, Easy, and Delicious!

this recipe is amazing- it's simple, healthy and so easy to prepare. I made it for my roommates and they all loved it. Sometimes I substitute skinny asparagus for the haricots verts; there are tons of variations you can do and it will still be delicious.

This salad was perfect during our summer heat wave. Used Italian tuna and followed recipe exactly. Simple and delicious.

I like this a lot. I love salade Nicoise, and this is very similar. I find, though, that somehow this takes me less time. I like to start the potatoes (I use red ones cut in small pieces) cooking in one pot at the same time I start the eggs in another. Then, while those cook, I get the beans ready, cut the tomatoes, and make the viniagrette. By the time I'm done with that, I've got the hot water going and reuse it for the beans. Saves a ton of time. I find the viniagrette a little flat. I made it once as written and wanted a different taste. I made it again and threw in some fresh thyme, which added another flavor. I really like this salad!

This was just great! I halved the recipe for DH and I and there is still a little bit left. I didn't have and couldn't find champagne vineger so I used rice wine vinegar. Next time I will use late harvest reisling vinegar. I think that the potatoes, tomatoes, and green beans would be just delicious with the vinagerette. Very light.This salad reminds me of the salads we had In Marbella, Spain. Will make again.

This salad is excellent. I didn't have any tomatoes so omitted them. I also recommend splurging on the Ortiz tuna if it's in the budget. It's expensive, but oh so worth it. Luxurious. Really good for a summer night dinner.

Keeper. New potatoes work well if Yukons are too big.

Delicious! Took a bit of time to put together. Added grilled halibut too (only had one can of tuna). A hearrty summer meal!
