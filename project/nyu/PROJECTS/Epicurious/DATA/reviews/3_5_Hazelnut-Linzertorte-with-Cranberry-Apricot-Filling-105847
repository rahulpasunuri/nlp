Beautiful and great-tasting. Flour must be cut in half. You can also reduce sugar. I didn't do the criss cross strips on top but left it more like a classic tart and made some caramelized orange peels for decoration. Thought it was much prettier. Proved a hit for Thanksgiving.

After reading all the comments I did the following : used dried cranberries instead of fresh (sweeter) used dried apricots, cooked and pureed; cut back 1/2 cup on the flour, added about 3 tablespoons of icewater. The dough was beautiful and easy to work, the crust was delicious, the filling was terrific, it cut beautifully. Tried it out on the family first, and now it is going into my party repertoire.

After reading the ratings and the mention of dealing with the dough, I am convinced this recipe skipped the test kitchen. Tweak the dough with a slight amount of water to make the dough pliable and workable then you will have an excellent dessert. My family enjoyed the dessert but didn't see the effort this recipe as printed required.

We LOVED this recipe. Instead of struggling with the lattice top, we used a cookie cutter with a cut out center and scattered flower shaped crust cut outs across the top. It looked as beautiful as it tasted.

I rated the end result 3 forks because I ended up having to tweak it. I used peaches because I could not find apricots. The filling was absolutely delicious. I just don't know who thinks that 2 eggs yolks and a teaspoon of vanilla is enough liquid for 3 3/4 cups of dry ingredients! I added a bit less flour than written, and ended up adding water to the dough in order to make it workable. I ended up with too much dough, which was extremely sticky, but I could still work with it. I had a lot of trouble with the lattice, having to freeze the dough, roll it out, freeze it again, then cut it, but the end result was fantastic. The crust was sublime and the torte looked like one you'd buy at a bakery. I will definitely do this recipe again, but I will play around with it to get the right consistency of dough (cutting down to 1 cup of flour and adding water or milk). This is a great holiday dessert and I got many compliments from my guests!

Delicious! I had a hard time with the crust; and ended up just cutting out heart-shapes with a cookie cutter then placing them on top. The recipe still worked fine. I would definately make this again.

Amazing! My filling didn't turn out too sour, maybe because the orange juice I used was really sweet, and I actually had the opposite problem with the top crust - I let it sit in the fridge for a whole day and it was so hard it wouldn't roll out at all! I'm sure there's some happy medium out there to make it manageable! Anyway, I loved the combination of flavors and will definitely make it again!

I thought this recipe was awful. It is one of the few Bon Appetit recipes I have disliked. The crust was VERY difficult to handle and many of my guests thought the filling too sour.

Fabulous and easy! Great presentation dessert. The flavors are a masterful combination although my young children thought it was too sour.

I made this for Thanksgiving and a few times since then. My daughter nicknamed this Heavenly Pie, and one adolescent guest at Thanksgiving said it was the best dessert he had ever eaten, and had 5 pieces! I made it non-dairy (no butter-used non-dairy margarine for the crust).To get around the problem with handling the top crust: I rolled it out on wax paper, then cut the crust and the underlying wax paper, then picked up the strips of wax paper, and flipped them unto the filling. It worked very well, and looked just like the picture.

I made this dessert for co-workers and it was a huge hit. Some very accomplished eaters thought it was the best linzer they had ever eaten. The dough was a real challenge to handle - especially the top. I had to roll it out, freeze it for a bit, cut it, freeze for it a bit more before I could handle it.
