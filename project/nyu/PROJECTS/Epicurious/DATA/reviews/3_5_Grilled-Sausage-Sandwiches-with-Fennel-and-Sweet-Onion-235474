This was excellent! We used sweet italian sausage, fresh spring sweet onions and a fennel from the farmers market with a little stone ground mustard and the combo was definitely a "make it again soon!"

This was an easy and delicious way to cook luganega sausage. The second time, instead of in sandwiches, served it over polenta. Used the indoor electric grill.

I liked the grilled onions & fennel--easy, good flavor. I cooked it on the (propane) grill with standard Italian sausage links. I'll probably make it again, although my kids were not crazy about it, which surprised me.
