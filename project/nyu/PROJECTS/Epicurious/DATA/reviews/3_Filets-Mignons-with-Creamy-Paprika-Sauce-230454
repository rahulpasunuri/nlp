Didn't serve it with noodles, just filet mignon plus the sauce. The flavor is great, but the sauce is far too heavy for me when combined with the filet mignon. Would use light sour cream if I make this again. Also, be very careful with the amount of dijon used.

wonderful dish, everyone loves it. ive made it twice, once following the recipe exactly and once making the sauce first and then the meat later to save time and worked just as well.

This went over very well... infact my husband wants me to prepare our filet mignons like this everytime I make them!!!

A great alternative when one of you (husband) loves stroganoff and one of you (me) doesn't :-) Filets are great no matter what, and serving the sauce on the side means you can take as much (or as little) as you like.

Mixed bag at our house, I thought it was better than my husband did. To each his own I guess. We grilled the steaks so that the noodles, sauce and veggie would be ready when the steaks were done. Used "Country Dijon Mustard"; just a matter of personal taste.

I made this for dinner for my husband and I and we both loved it. I used the full sauce recipe which was a little too much but halving it sounded skimpy. I used half hot paprika and it kicked it up a little too much. Next time I would only use 1 teaspoon hot. I used fat free sour cream. The result was a good, creamy,(lite) and flavorful sauce. I grilled the filets after the sauce was done.

This was an excellent recipe. A bit heavy on the paprika taste, so if you don't like paprika, I wouldn't recommend this recipe. A nice change of pace for filet sauces. Will definitely make again.

Fantastic! My husband couldn't stop raving and thanking me for this, and I will definitely make it again for guests. I made this dish for Valentine's Day with rosemary potatoes and asparagus; for dessert we had vanilla ice cream with a cherry Balsamic sauce. I used portobello mushrooms, and that seems to have been a very good choice.

Just so-so is about right. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't GOOD. Bland. I used Hungarian Sweet Paprika since it specifically said (not hot) next to the paprika. Go for the hot. This recipe lacks a lot of flavor and doesn't have the depth of Goulash. It doesn't do justice to the lovely Filets.

I made this as written and found it fairly easy and very delicious. Great deal for a weeknite meal.

This was a great use of my leftover fondue meat, vegetables, and sour cream sauce. Since I was using leftovers, horseradish was inherently added...nice! I halved the mustard and am happy with that.

I found the mustard overpowered the sauce a bit. Cutting back on the mustard would be a good idea next time. The recipe went dry when I added the packaged/sliced portabella mushrooms. I had to add a dash of water to rescue it, and it worked fine from there. Another reviewer recommended keeping the meat warm. I agree. My filets were only slightly warm when the plates hit the table. Mustard sauce on cold filet mignon was not what I had in mind, although my wife loved it.

Very good! I was making this for myself and my 2 small kids, so I sliced the tenderloins and sauteed them in olive oil and butter mixed. My kids really like it! I served it more like a stroganoff over rotini pasta. Served this way it really is almost like a paprika beef stroganoff...but mmmm so good!

This recipe is fast and delicious. I had no mushrooms and it still was delicious. I sustituted Low Fat Plain Yogurt for the sour cream and it was delicious from start to finish and devouring it down, maybe 30 mins. Enjoy!!

This is a delicious dish! I cut the Dijon mustard down to 1 tsp. based on another reviewer's comments and the sauce turned out well. Served it with herbed oven fries and roasted green beans.

if you're searching for an interesting sauce recipe, keep looking. this one fizzled for me.

I can honestly say that this was the best steak dish I've ever prepared. Even my usually picky boyfriend gobbled up the mushrooms and licked the plate. My sauce came out to be a dark tan color since the moisture from the mushrooms ended up deglazing the pan and it tasted exactly like Stroganoff sauce that I've been attempting to copy from my grandmother's Beef Stroganoff but have been unsuccessful until now. Also, since my local Shoprite had a sale on Filets and I showed up late, I ended up getting top sirloin. To those who didn't like the sauce on the steak, we put it over the egg noodles, which we left unbuttered. The only issue is that I was able to taste the dijon mustard much more than the paprika. Since I was using paprika, I'm assuming that wasn't the problem. Delicious in any case!

Loved it! Not being a filet fan and deathly fearful of overcooked steak, I made this dish with pork loin chops...it was wonderful! I am NOT a cook and this was easy and impressive. I was quite generous with the garlic, black pepper and paprika so it had a nice bite ... we like spice! This would definitely work well with beef ... would have to figure out what cut though. I'll definitely make this again ... in some form!

This was a major disconnect for me. The sauce was good but it was screaming for some tender stewed beef or chicken. Does not do justice to a filet - it covered up the nice browned notes and the rare meat juices mixing with the light creamy sauce was unappealing. My husband tried to scrape the sauce off as best he could. I wish I made my expensive filets with a simple herb/red wine sauce instead with frites or garlic mashed potatos.

I followed the recipe pretty closely, but had a hotter paprika that I brought back from Morocco last year so I only used about 3/4 T. The result was very tasty. It felt like a gourmet dinner, but took under an hour to prepare My husband like this very much.

Wonderful and easy. I'm a beginner to multi-course meals (23, newlywed) but the simplicity of this as a main course freed me up to steam asparagus, roast red potatoes with thyme and rosemary for sides and peach crisp for dessert. I think next time we might do it with a lesser cut of beef, though -- my husband couldn't stop talking about the splurge.

Since I was grilling the filets outside, I started the sauce in a pan on the stove earlier. It took longer than 3 - 5 minutes to cook the mushrooms and reduce the liquid. Overall taste was very good--my nephew complimented the taste of the sauce several times!

The sauce is too spiced to be supported by a delicate filet. It would be better over a stronger steak such as top sirloin. I served the sauce separately from the noodles and steak, having tasted it in the kitchen. Over noodles is it fine, reminscent of some Indian sauces. But if I were to prepare it again, I would use far less paprika. (Mine was fresh and though mild was very strongly flavored.) Sort of ho-hum matched against a good Stroganoff sauces.

This was really quick & easy to make. While my boyfriend found the sauce delicious, I think it needed a bit of pepping up--maybe hotter paprika or some cayenne, or more garlic -worchestershire/dijon and some herbs like thyme. Serve with a tomato salad to cut the richness.

I would change the recipe. (Undercook the steaks by one degree of doneness, and keep warm while preparing the sauce.). twelve to fifteen minutes wait for sauce preparation allowed the steaks to cool-off. ugardner

Phenomenal! I couldn't get tenderloin so I used plain old steak - but it was delicious. Spicy, but the sour cream made it taste like heaven. I reccommend everyone try it out!

Great recipe for those goulash-lovers out there. My man is one - I whipped this up quickly after work and he raved about the flavour. Certainly a lot less fuss than a traditional goulash. I up'd the amount of garlic slightly, prepared a side of steamed green peppers and carrots with parsley, and served as directed over egg noddles. Yum.
