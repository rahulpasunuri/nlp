this recipe came out well. i used raw walnuts instead which, i toasted in the oven first. i increased the rosewater to 2 teaspoons after reading one of the reviews. still subtle but I think just right. i added only the 1/4 tsp. of salt called for in the body of the recipe.

The rose flavor is a delicate twist on the normal "honey-roasted." I've tried this with a variety of nuts, and peanuts are my least favorite. Almonds and pistachios are good...walnuts and cashews aren't bad either.

These nuts are tasty, a good homemade honey-roasted peanut, but don't have much rose-water flavor. Next time I'll try adding a bit more rose-water. The online recipe left salt off the ingredient list and didn't specify whether the nuts needed to be salted or unsalted peanuts to start with. In fact I just used regular lightly salted peanuts and they came out fine too. It took me and my stove a few minutes longer for each step than what the recipe mentions.
