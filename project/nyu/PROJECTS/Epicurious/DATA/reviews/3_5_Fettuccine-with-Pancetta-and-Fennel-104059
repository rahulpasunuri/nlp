I made this recipe with smoked salmon instead of pancetta and it was excellent! I was a little nervous about how strong the fennel was when I started chopping, but it really mellowed out after cooking. I thought the cooking times were a little long. I agree with another reviewer, the parmesan was essential!

I changed it a bit added shrimp instead on pancetta at the last five minutes. This was a simple and tasty lunch.

Good recipe -- I used half the cream, more fennel and less pasta than was called for. Pine nuts would have been an interesting addition.

This was certainly very easy to make, and although it tasted fine it looked very sad. Will definately save fronds to spice up the appearance, and lots more pepper flakes next time

This was a simple pasta dish that was so flavorful. I was out of 1/2 & 1/2, so ended up substituting with a light sour cream and broth mixture I stirred up, it worked out great!

This turned out quite well. Next time I would cut the fennel into slightly smaller pieces and maybe not reduce the cream down so much. Our was a little dry. Very flavorful and good introduction of fennel to skeptical fiancé :)

This is a very tasty dish, and super easy to make!The local market was out of pancetta, but applewood-smoked bacon worked fine. Chardonnay is the perfect match for this pasta dish.

This was flavorful and easy. I added sliced mushrooms and a dollop of creme fraiche to enrich it. I'd certainly make it again.

I agree. This is a cozy carbonara-style pasta dish with a huge fennel taste. It is very easy to make. I would add some toasted pine nuts for a crunch. Grated fresh parmesan is a must.
