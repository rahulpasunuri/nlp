This is one of our all-time decadent favorites- we are making it again for Valentine's Day. We are big cooks but this is amazingly good with little effort. We make both the infused oil and spread the roasted cloves on artisanal crusty bread. Fabulous!!

Fine dish, a little bitter on the plate as recipe calls for,but certainly worth preparing for dinner.

So simple and very tasty - a great snacker to throw together quickly for guests that tastes much more complicated than it actually is. I didn't have time to roast the garlic and let it infuse with the oil, so I just sauteed it in the oil until softened and spreadable - worked out great.

This was fabulous!!! I served it with grilled artisinal olive bread that I then drizzled lightly with the oil. The olive bread and the cheese dip worked really well together. This will definitely be a staple in our house.

By far the best recipe I've made from Epicurious, both my husband and I loved it. I took the recipes advice and smeared the roasted garlic on the bread as well. The sauce is scrumptious but beware as it's very potent (we love gorgonzola/bleu cheese so we thought it was fantastic!) This will be a new appetizer staple on future party menus.

So easy and dangerously delicious! The cheese sauce is decadent and your guests will dip anything they can find into it. The recipe makes a ton, but you will find that it disappears. This is great for parties, it is very filling and compliment inducing!!

The bread was just good - the sauce makes it great. Easy, easy, easy.

This was very good, if not a bit sloppy. I will cut the recipe in half for next time as this made a huge amount. The roasted garlic was a definate bonus. I put the sauce in a fondue dish, thinking to keep it warm, but it ended up burning on the bottom...so that won't happen again. This sauce was a hit for people who didn't like "stinky" cheese

I made it exactly as stated and served it at a wine and cheese gathering. Despite the available garlic bread, everything in the room was dipped into this sauce. I'll do my standby garlic bread recipe with it next time, but this sauce will stay in my repertoire forever.

Came home late, hungry, and had some leftover blue cheese and whipping cream from a party so did a quick version of this recipe. Poured olive oil into a 8" cast iron skillet and started heating it. Peeled and sliced some garlic cloves into the oil. Put scant half cup whipping cream in a glass measuring cup and blasted it in the microwave. Started mashing the garlic cloves as they began to soften, letting them mellow without getting brown or crispy. Added cubes of blue cheese to the cream and blasted it again til it was reduced. Mopped up the garlicky oil from the skillet with three slices ordinary bread, then put them in the toaster oven. Cut the garlic toasts into quarters and arranged them in the skillet with the sauce. Ate with a fabulous mellow merlot. Great 20 minute meal, a bit rich though. Salad, apples or pears would have improved the experience.

I used cambozola cheese instead to create the dipping sauce and it turned out amazing. Next time I won't leave the bread in the proofing oven so long as it dried out quite quickly - even though the wet tea towels on top were change frequently. None the less it was enjoyed all around.

This is so easy and wonderful. I could just eat the sauce with a spoon!

This one is over-rated, in my opinion. My guests certainly didn't do back for thirds, or even seconds. Maybe if this had been all I served it would have been a bigger hit.

Wow! What a great starter. I was behind so wasn't able to infuse oil - but no matter. I roasted up three heads of garlic - smeared the roasted garlic on the toasted baguette and dribbled on some excellent olive oil. The sauce and bread tasted terrific. I really didn't want to share it!

truly outstanding!! the only addition i made was offering sliced fuji apples along with the garlic bread to give a little acidic balance to all that creamy fat.

Rating: 4
This is fantastic. I wanted to make it & didn't have the garlic oil already prepared so I minced some garlic & set it in oil for about an hour - then i put that over the bread before I broiled it. This worked fine & let's be serious...I'm all about the gorgonzola sauce...amazing!

Have made this numerous times--everyone LOVES it.

This was a FANTASTIC recipe. Although, to save time I bought pre-made garlic bread and then after making the cheese dip, I spread it on the bread and baked it on warm for 5+/- minutes. My husband finished the ENTIRE loaf of bread + his dinner. I've given the recipe out to all my friends and tell them to make it this weekend.

Very over-rated. Most of my guests didnt touch it. I think they would have preferred old fashioned garlic bread to this. It wasn't cheap to make, and was a waste of a lot of fat.

Don't fuss over dinner, if you serve this first, it will be the only thing your guests remember! The first thing my friends ask when invited is, "Can you make more of that gorgonzola dip?"

Rating: 4
OK you know what.....this dish was terrible. FOR MY WAISTLINE!!! Geez, I think I must have eaten the whole pot of cheese by myself! It seemed too easy to be true, too. This is a must for people who like cheeses like Gorgonzola.

We make this with the Shrimp with Spicy Creole Sauce...divine!!

i have made this many times, all with rave reviews(even from guests who say they don't like blue cheese). The first time I made it, it was intended for an appetizer, my husband and I ate the entire loaf of bread and dip and wrapped up dinner for the next day. Try this recipe, so easy.

This was wonderful. The flavour of the gorgonzonla married perfectly with the mild roasted garlic. Will make again soon.

This makes a delicious hors d'oeuvre for any occasion (even my 2-year old liked them!) The garlicky bread by itself works well for those who don't want to dip into the sauce - but the sauce itself is absolutely wonderful - Very easy to make, and reminiscent of fondue - Will be making this for many gatherings in the future.

This was just terrific. With a glass (or two!) of wine, this was a perfect casual appetizer served family style. We will make it again and again...whether for "just us" or company.

This recipe received rave reviews from my guests, even from my husband who normally doesn't like "blue cheese" type dishes. It was so simple to prepare. I think is would also be great served with slices of crisp autumn apples and pears. This is certainly not for the faint of heart, the fat content is off the charts but certainly worth a once in a while treat! I'm looking forward to serving it during the holidays.

I don't know if I did something wrong here. It tasted really blue cheesey too much!!! But I will try again

Incredibly simple. Simply incredible. I could have just eaten this and skipped the rest of the meal. I will make this often. Like the others, I also spread the mashed roast garlic on the bread before broiling.

We made this recipe for a casual BBQ and it was devoured-even by one of our guests who was just 2 years-old! I followed the other comments, spreading the garlic oil on the bread before broiling, and it was great. We also poured the leftover cheese sauce over asparagus with our meal-delicious.

This was good. Very easy to make - it was like a thin fondue. I agree with the cook from Saugus...the sauce is too thin to pour onto a plate. I served it in individual ramekins so that each person had their own serving of bread and sauce. I think it's easier to eat this way - you don't all have to share the same bowl of sauce and then you can double-dunk all you want! I also spread the roasted garlic onto the bread. Why waste the best part!

Rating: 3
This was delicious ... the sauce wasn't as thick as I thought it was going to be, so instead of pouring on the platter, I served it in a bowl, and dipped the bread into it. I also spread all of the roasted garlic on the bread before broiling it ... it was yummy!

This is by far one of the best appetizers I have ever made. My whole party would not move away from the dish until it was all gone. Everyone must try this dish!

I made this recipe over New Years but was in the mountains and couldn't find Gruyere cheese. I used Bleu instead and it was way way to strong. I should have used 1/2 the amount of cheese. Next time I will use the Gruyere.

I made this dish for my family, including visiting daughter from LA - everyone thought it was just superb, and had to hold back some from over indulging - it was that good. Next time I will attempt to make the sauce thicker by reducing it even further.

This was an excellent recipe! If you make it as an appetizer, BEWARE! You will end up eating so much that there will not be any room for dinner. I made this for my boyfriend, who hates "stinky" cheese, and he absolutely devoured it! I spread the oil and garlic on the bread before broiling. It gave the bread a beautiful color.

This has become one of my all-time favorite appetizers! My guests cannot get enough - Absolutely, rub the roasted garlic over the warm bread before serving. What marvelous flavors!!

Absolutly Fabulous!! I made this for my family as an appetizer and they practically licked the bowl clean. I also spread the garlic on the bread and mixed it in with the cheese mixture, the warm chunks of garlic were heavenly. A definate hit! Try it for a dinner party and will be the talk of the party.

Absolutely wonderful! It was heavenly... A friend made this one night, and we ate every bit. This recipe stayed on my mind, I immediately came home and printed it for my own file. Make sure it is kept warm so it stays dippable!

I will definately try this one again... All of my dinner guests loved it. It was titilating (but you have to like blue "smelly" cheese) :-)

An absolute must for all cheese lovers, this one makes your face tingle!! I too used the roasted garlic by smearing it on some of the bread and the pieces of bread with the garlic were the most coveted! (I'll use 2 heads next time.) Also, I sliced my bread into 1/2 inch slices, brushed with the oil and then toasted on both sides under the broiler. I did this after finding the suggested method didn't result in bread that was crispy enough for our liking. Fabulous recipe and really easy!

This was almost better than sex. We dipped the bread in the cheese instead of pourinng it over. When it starts to cool down, it thickens nicely, almost like fondue.
