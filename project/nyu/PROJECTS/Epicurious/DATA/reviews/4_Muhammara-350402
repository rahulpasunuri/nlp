Excellent! I added some Turkish red pepper paste, too.

Made this as written. This dip has great flavor and was received with rave reviews at a recent potluck. Everyone wanted the recipe.

Outstanding! Super delicious, low fat, uncommon, and done in under 5 minutes with only the Cuisinart needing clean-up. What could be better than that?! I also couldn't find red peppers in olive oil, but Wegman's sells 12 oz. bags of frozen "fire roasted red peppers" which worked perfectly.

Very good! I served it as part of a Mediterranean-themed dinner. I made the recipe as stated using red peppers packed in oil and garlic. I thought the flavors improved overnight so I recommend making it the day before.

Like many others, my roasted peppers were not packed with garlic, so I added some to the recipe. I made my own pomegranate molasses (very easy) and I ended up adding some lemon juice, too, to bring out a tang in the final product. I also took the suggestions of the avid muhammara fan down there (great suggestions, thank you!) and amped up the spices and added a bit more walnuts and panko. Finally, I added a LOT more pomegranate molasses than called for. Have some pita bits nearby and taste frequently as you make these adjustments and you'll get it just right. It's delicious.

Great recipe! It got rave reviews at the dinner party I took it to. Really easy to make. Definitely go for the pomegranate molasses (buy 100% pomegranate juice and reduce by less than half; I reduced 1/2 c. juice to 1 T. of ''molasses"). I too purchased roasted red peppers in water, so I added a large clove of garlic (coarsely chopped) and extra EVOO. Doubled the panko as many suggested, but I thought it was a bit too dry; would not double next time. Only used 1/8 t. cayenne, and it was plenty of heat for us. Consider lightly tossing fresh pita wedges with EVOO and sea salt, toast lightly, and use for dipping. YUM!

So easy and SO great! At first, I thought the (rough) texture was a bit strange, but the whole thing was strangely ADDICTIVE!!! No one could stop eating it! So tasty and heat comes on nicely. My peppers were in water with no garlic so did a splash of EVOO and clove of fresh garlic. Used molasses, so don't know what it would be like without.

Just made my first batch, and it is PHENOMENAL. I toasted the walnuts, and took engagingdiscussions' advice in doubling the panko and walnuts. I also used fresh minced garlic and olive oil since my peppers were in water vs. oil. The pomegranate molasses is an absolute must-do. Highly recommend this.

I've made this twice. The first time, I didn't bother with the pomegranate molasses, and it was really delicious anyway. Next time through, I decided to make my own pomegranate molasses. I just reduced pomegranate juice with sugar and lemon. The flavor that it added was the magic touch! Version #1 was great, but Version #2 was amazing! This will become a party favorite! The molasses I made will last in the fridge for a few more batches, and I'm already being asked to bring this to the next party. BTW, I also had a version of this at a restaurant recently, and this recipe is better.

Made this recipe as written. Everyone enjoyed it. As noted by others, lemon juice is not a substitute for pomegranate molasses; the lemon juice lacks the slight sweetness that the molasses adds.

Rating: 0
Delicious! But all the other reviewers are right: lemon juice is no substitute for pomegranate molasses! I would start with 1 tsp of the pomegranate molasses and add if more if necessary. I also added 1 tsp of tahini, 1 tsp of tomato paste, and 2 cloves of garlic. It was fantastic.

OK, but not great. The red pepper was too pronounced - the flavors didn't meld together. But, it was easy and fast, so I'll probably make it for parties. Next time, I'll follow the "avid muhammara fan" suggestions to increase the panko, walnuts and spices.

I usually get annoyed when recipes are overly-modified by reviewers, and then the reviewer rates the recipe based on their interpretation of what the dish should have been. So, I'm going to annoy myself. But stay with me... Being of middle eastern descent and an avid muhammara fan, this recipe was left wanting... Here's how I fixed it: I could not get peppers in oil with garlic, so I added about three teaspoons of fresh minced garlic to the recipe. I did not increase the oil, fyi. Doubled the breadcrumbs and walnuts. Doubled the cayenne pepper. Added about four tablespoons of pomegranate molasses. This gives the dish that muhammara "tang" that is so good. If you like a smooth, pureed dip, blend away in a food processor. My favorite versions, however, are a bit more coarse. In fact, I prepared the recipe as directed, then prepared my modified ingredients (additional walnuts, bread crumbs, pom molasses, cayenne, garlic) and processed to a VERY coarse consistency - almost just chopped. Then, I folded it all together. Consistency and taste improved considerably. Originally written, I find that the recipe is a bit bland. If you like bold flavors, don't hesitate to pump up the spices. And the pom molasses is a MUST. You can find it in any middle eastern or Indian grocery store. You won't get the true essence of what muhammara should be with lemon juice... Modifications or not, you'll have fun watching/listening to people trying to figure out what the ingredients are! It's a very unique concoction.

I found this recipe needed salt and pepper to give it more flavor. I also added more garlic and subbed hot paprika for the cayenne.

So easy. So good. So not messy. Used lemon juice and added garlic. YUM.

This was delicious. I didn't have any molasses or lemons on hand, but I did have a tangerine, so used that instead. I also ran out of panko so used a couple crushed water crackers to make up the difference. I made homemade pita chips to go with it. I brought this to a gathering and it disappeared in minutes.

I eat this like pb out of the jar. Do NOT substitute lemon juice for pomegranate. Too acidic.

Really good! Here's what I did: The only jarred roasted peppers I found were in water, not oil, and had no garlic. I made the recipe (w/lemon juice, not pomegranate molasses) and added a teensy bit more olive oil to make up for the oil that would have been clinging to the drained peppers. I'd meant to add garlic but forgot. I thought it tasted so-so. Since I'd made it a day in advance of my party, I decided the next day to try to tweak it to improve it. I put 2 garlic cloves in the Cuisinart and chopped those, then added the muhammara. As it blended, I added about a tablespoon or so more olive oil. Wow. That made all the difference! If your spread seems crumbly or dry-ish, add extra olive oil. And, in my book, the garlic is essential!

This was delicious. My peppers were in water, not olive oil, but this still had plenty of flavor. I added only 1 Tbs. of oil and it was still a good texture. Great with pita chips or grilled bread. It only makes about one and a half cups and it goes quickly, so I might make a double batch next time.

A refreshing alternative to more typical bean dips and tapenades. I made it for a party recently and it was the first thing on the table to be devoured completely. I've posted a photo of the finished product here: http://sweetamandine.blogspot.com

Made it without the breadcrumbs. Still had a good consistency. I added fresh parsley and garlic. My roasted peppers were without garlic added. Our friends loved it. Would definitely make it again. Will try it without the walnuts and breadcrumbs next time. I used the pomegranate glaze from Trader Joe's which gave it great flavor.

Excellent flavor - easy to make. I left out the Panko as I didn't have any and it was fine. My red peppers didn't have garlic and I added 2 large cloves. Nice kick!

My mother makes this recipe however it's slightly different, she adds some very finely diced shallot, not too much or it will be too strong. Instead of cumin use coriander. Instead of cayenne pepper, use crushed pepper flakes - again go small on all of the above at first and adjust to taste. Corn flake crumbs or bread crumbs are a good substitution and I have also made this dish with pecans for those who do not like walnuts.

I have made this dip/spread from a very similar recipe many times - and it is a huge hit every time. Put both lemon juice and the pomegranate molasses in. Use wheat crackers (like Wheat Thins) if you don't have the breadcrumbs. It's great on veggie sticks (like jicama, fennel, celery, carrots, etc. or crackers of any kind.) A litte crushed red pepper is also good instead of or in addition to the cayenne.

Very delicious. I only used a quarter of the cayenne called for - and I like spicy things - it was plenty. I also omitted bread crumbs altogether because I didn't have any. the consistency was good.

This recipe could not be easier. I've done it with almonds instead of walnuts with good result. I do think a little extra olive oil helps. I've also done it with a few green olives thrown in. Yum! I make this and hummus and serve with a platter of pita. It's pretty and delicious.

I agree that the recipe from 1993 is better, although this one has a better oil ratio. http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Muhammara-10982 Pomegranate molasses is available @ Middle Eastern or gourmet stores, or you can make it yourself. Several recipes come up using Google, but I used one that was posted by a thoughtful cook in the comments section of the other recipe (I halved the recipe and used POM, which worked fine): Bring to boil 1 quart Trader Joe's Pomegranate Juice, 2/3 cup sugar, 2/3 cup lemon juice; simmer on low until reduced to 1-1/3 cups. Pita chips makes a good accompaniment, as do crudite.

I have not seen pomegranate molasses. would i find it at an ethnic market? what section in the grocery store?? what kind of chip do you recommend serving? thanks! it sounds yummy.

the receipe from this site, 1993, is a much better version of this very tasty dip. We serve it every year at Christmas Eve, when we do a bunch of appetisers and let everyone graze all night.

I served this at a small dinner party and everyone LOVED it! I had no problem with it being "pasty," and wonder if maybe using regular breadcrumbs rather than Panko would have done that ... I think the Panko is essential. I cut the cayenne in half for my guests, but next time, I'll add it all. Fantastic!! I'll make this one often.

This was pretty darn tasty and a hit at my party. I would agree that it didn't stick together nicely. I will certainly add some oil next time, but I will definitely make it again.

This was very tasty. I took it to a party and everyone loved it! It turned out a bit on the pasty side, it was kind of hard to get it to stick to the crackers. I've never had this before, so I wasn't sure what the texture should be like. Next time I'll add a little of the liquid from the roasted peppers and probably add some of the olive oil at the end to emulsify it a bit. But the taste was phenomenal. I made my own breadcrumbs too. Super good and really pretty!

This is a must try. I use to purchase Muhammara at Oakville Grocery. Then decided I could make this. I looked on Epicurious and there it was. Delicious!
