My family loved this recipe when I made it for Thanksgiving several years ago. For the first time, leftovers were scarce. I highly recommend this recipe to anyone who needs a change from the marshmallow version.

Simple and good. As suggested by a previous reviewer I put the yams through a ricer and then added the butter.

I'll make the yams again if my guests don't mind raising their cholesterol by a ton. The flavor is SO amazing, with no sugar or tacky marshmallows, but simply with lots of butter and in a fluffy puree.

This was really good. Instead of using a food processor, I put the yams through a ricer. The yams were fluffy beyond belief and I was able to discard quite a bit of fiber.

This is so easy and delicious! The fact that it can be made ahead and reheated in the microwave is an added bonus. This recipe will always be a part of our Thanksgiving feast and I will make excuses the rest of the year to make it.

This is so easy and delicious. And it is a bonus that it can be made ahead of time and reheated in the microwave before serving - what a timesaver! This is going into my recipe box and will be a permanent fixture at Thanksgiving.
