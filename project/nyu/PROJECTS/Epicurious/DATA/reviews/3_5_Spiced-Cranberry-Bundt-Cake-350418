I had fresh cranberries from a local bog and this recipe seemed perfect to have with coffee or tea on a cold autumn day. It was a big success...although I wish it turned out a little moister. The spice blend was great!

Made this for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it. I skipped the glaze and served with whipped cream. I felt that it came out just a little dry and would decrease the baking time by a few minutes.

The spices definitely added an interesting dimension to the cake. I made a few adjustments to the recipe to avoid using butter: Substituted the cup of butter with half applesauce and half canola oil, also cut the sugar to 1/2 cup white sugar + 2/3 cup brown sugar. The cake came out incredibly moist and not too sweet, without the icing. I made the icing but will serve it on the side - sugar control ;)

Fantastic recipe. Made it with honey Greek yogurt and used fresh cranberries since they are in season. The icing was a little runny, but I used it as a base and then dusted powdered sugar on top. Made one to keep and eat and gave one away nicely wrapped as a present. Will definitely make this again!

This is not a bad cake, but it isn't fabulous either. "Very good" is what my guests thought. For me, it was too dense and dry, and the flavor of the orange juice in the icing conflicts with the other flavors. Essentially, I think there are too many flavors going on (with the orange in the icing). Changes I made during my first prep: I used 3/4 c of both sugars (rather than 1 c), I added almond extract, used 1- 1/2 c of frozen cranberries and 3/4 c dried cranberries, and I made my icing of light cream cheese (3/4 block), orange juice, regular (super fine) sugar (I was out of powdered) and vanilla extract. I personally think the icing I used is better than the one proposed in the recipe, but if I make this again, I will switch out amaretto for the orange juice in it to keep the almond flavor theme going and not introduce another flavor (orange). I will also double the icing quantity because this was at least as good as the cake and it "made" the cake.

This was a great spice cake for my holiday brunch. I baked it in a castle shaped bundt pan and the drizzled glaze looked like snow on the castles towers and ramparts. I'll definitly be making this recipe again.

We love this cake. Instead of the glaze, however, we serve it with fresh whipped cream with just a hint of DiSaronno. Delicious.

Really nice cake. I didn't have plain yoghurt so I used 1/2 cup full fat sour cream and 1/2 cup Almond Milk (sweetened). It was so moist that it totally broke when I took it out of the pan!! So bummed that it doesn't look great... but it'll be eaten up I'm sure!

This was wonderful! The flavors combined so well together and it stayed nice and moist for about 4 days (maybe it would have for more, but it was all gone by then). The only thing I did differently was using allspice instead of the five spice powder because I couldn't find any here. My cousin especially loved it, she said she dreamed of it and is begging me to make it again!

This one surprised me. I had lots of fresh cranberries left over from (Canadian) Thanksgiving so I thought I'd give this a go. Very few changes but here they are: I adjusted sugars to 1 1/4 c of white, 1/4 c of light brown and 1/2 c of dark brown because I was low on light brown. I upped the fresh cranberries to 2 c and didn't add any dried/sweetened ones. I swapped pecans for almonds but then added 1/2 t of almond extract and decreased the vanilla to 1 t. Really delicious. A tiny bit dry but I think I overcooked even though only kept it in for about 50 minutes. Didn't do the glaze because it was a late night snack and we were impatient. Just whipped up some fresh whipped cream. Made the house smell amazing. Think this will be on my holiday dessert list for Christmas.

Wow! This is a seriously good cake. It definitely exceeded my expectations. I came across the recipe while searching for something to make with some "almond meal" I bought on impulse. By chance I had large quantities on hand of almonds (from Apricot King in CA) and both fresh and dried cranberries (from Cranberry Hill in Plymouth MA). To substitute for five spice powder I put star anise, cloves, and allspice in a spice grinder and sieved the result. I skipped the frosting entirely. I would be tempted to make this recipe in muffin tins or cupcake tins or shallow ramekins, and serve unmolded in a shallow pool of custard sauce. One of the best cranberry recipes I have come across!

This cake tasted even better than I expected. I didn't have Chinese five-spice powder, so I subbed clove and additional ginger and cinnamon. It took the full 70 minutes to bake. I think the chopped toasted almonds push it past merely "good" into "fantastic" territory.

When this recipe came out last year, I made a mental note to try it, but never got around to it. I finally made it last night, and it was just what I expected. I made the following adjustments for altitude: added 1 extra egg, reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup. I also used non-fat Greek yogurt instead of 2%, and added a browned butter glaze. Like other reviewers, I found that 45-50 minutes at 325 convection was perfect. The cake is moist and wonderfully tasty, and did not fall at all (a problem at 6000 feet). While the cranberries and almonds are a very good combo with the spices, I think next time I will use pecans and 1 cup of dried cherries.

Fabulous! Cooked 50 minutes -- would have done 5 more. Couldn't find cranberries in this season but used more of the sweetened/dried, and used walnuts instead of almonds. But a perfect spice cake. I can imaging heating a slice and topping with some vanilla yogurt. Orange glaze is just right. Yummy!

P.S. i just wanted to add this thought to my previous review...I baked the cake for the 70 minutes recommended and It came out perfectly moist, perfectly baked, and slid right out of the bundt pan after I gave it two good smacks on the bottom! yum.

This is tasty and a keeper for me. I made the recipe almost as written but I made a couple minor changes due to personal preference and necessity. First off, I used chopped frozen rhubarb in place of the fresh cranberry because I couldn't find fresh or frozen cranberries in the market in August on the US east coast. Rhubarb has a similar taste to cranberry in my opinion so I thought it would make a perfect substitution. Next, I used walnuts instead of almonds. I added 1/2 tsp. almond extract in addition to the vanilla extract to make up for the flavor missing from not using almonds. I just prefer walnuts better in baking. I find almonds sometimes come out too chewy and hard. {I DID however use the ground almond flour called for in the recipe.} And I used full fat Greek yogurt {'Fage' brand total.}{don't skip the Greek yogurt, the Greek is so much thicker and richer than regular American yogurt!}I thought the additional fat in this yogurt would make the cake even more rich and moist and it did. I am very happy with the way this cake came out and I will definitely make this regularly in the future. As soon as cranberries come into the stores I will try this recipe using only cranberries. The rhubarb did work out very well this time and I would use it again in the future. I think either one would be appropriate for this recipe.I was intrigued by the use of the 5 spice powder in this recipe! Very clever. The house smelled wonderful while this was baking!

What a cake!! My friends and I found this moist, tasty cake a special treat and aren't we something using almond flour and Chinese Five-spice powder to create what we call a masterpiece?! I would not make a single change to this recipe.

Decent, but not a stand-out. I did like the five spice flavor for something a little different, and it's a good way to use up something I don't cook with very often. I did have problems with the cake sticking in the pan, but I seem to have that problem with every bundt cake I do. I also replaced a half teaspoon of the vanilla with almond extract as I love the almond flavor.

This was very disappointing. I made sure not to overcook it (as other people warned) but it was still dry. No one disliked the cake, but no one wanted to eat a second piece . . . ever. I threw most of it out.

I made this for the family holiday weekend get-together and everyone enjoyed it. It lasted all weekend long, because it makes such a nice big cake and it keeps for quite awhile, only improving with age. It is great for tea time; good for breakfast. I used 2 cups of fresh cranberries, (and did not exclude the 1/2 cup dried) which the cake can easily take on, and I baked for 45-50 minutes. I did not make the glaze...it doesn't need it. I just sprinkled the cake with a little bit of powdered sugar to make it look pretty. It is a recipe I will keep in the files and look forward to making when cranberry season rolls around again.

Too bad I didn't check the reviews beforehand. Fortunately, I did check the cake early and also found that it needed far less time than the directions. I really appreciated the details about the eggs, butter and yogurt being room temperature, and to only gently stir in the cranberries and nuts. I too dislike 5-spice and replaced it with a great Indian curry spice mix - very yummy!

I didn't get to make this at Christmas, but it will become a favorite here after. Wonderful flavor and so colorful for the season, but wonderful anytime. I agree that the baking time is too long. I cut it down also, about 30 mins for my area (higher elevation). I didn't find Greek yogurt, but used just regular plain yogurt. It was so moist. What a keeper.

This was a nice addition to a holiday buffet, and leftovers were enjoyed at breakfast. I was out of five spice, so added extra cinnamon, plus cloves and cardamom

I was glad to read the other reviews. I baked about 20 of these as my Christmas baked-goods giveaways in mini-bundt pans. I baked the first one fullsized and followed the recipe exactly. I wasn't crazy about the 5 spice taste and my husband who will eat anything just left it on the counter after the first bite, so that told me what I needed to know. I left the 5 spice out for my gift ones and just used more cinnamon. Everyone has loved it.

Made this cake a second time for breakfast and used the buttermilk instead of yogurt. I thought it was even better! And I'm much more likely to have buttermilk in my fridge than yogurt. I doubled the glaze. This cake is better the 2nd day.

Truly awesome! Moist, flavorful. Think it would be lovely year round. Notes: (1) Baking time is way too long. Did 50 minutes in 325 convection oven. Anything longer will definitely overbake and make dry. (2) found that multiple glazings was the answer to getting nice color/coverage. Glazed and let dry 3 times. (3) overnight cooling/flavor blending is key. It's OK same night, but awesome after 1 day. Plan to try whole wheat pastry flour. Have suggested to my ND sister that this could be made gluten free.

This cake was fantastic! I do not particularly like Chinese fivespice, but in this recipe it works. I used the almond meal and full-fat greek yogurt, rather than the two percent, which may have helped moistness. As other reviewers have noted, the baking time is way too long. I baked for about 40 minutes and the cake was moist and delicious. I am making several of these as gifts for friends.

I LOVED this cake. I made it exactly as written, but did take it out of the oven a few minutes early. It was moist and crumbly, delicious! Loved the subtle anise background and tangy cranberries. I used sliced toasted almonds (they just seemed to blend in really well while still adding great crunch).

Me again. I forgot to add that the baking time, like many other reviewers said, is much too long. I took about 50-55 minutes for the cake to bake. Also, if you insist on making this cake, PLEASE skill the ground almond flour, which by the way is also very expensive and makes this cake dry. And replace the sour cream with buttermilk. Or waste your time and make it according to Greenspan's exact instructions. I made it for the Thanksgiving holidays and no one liked it.

Rating: 1
A BIG LOSER! Very dry and crumbly. Greenspan should retest this cake. And I am usually a great baker. I think that the cake would be much better if the recipe skipped the ground almond flour, and replaced the yogurt with buttermilk. A big disappointment!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TRUST ME!

I made this on Sunday and froze it until Thanksgiving day, then took it out and glazed it after it defrosted. Like so many others, I cooked it far less than the suggested time, and I found it to be incredibly moist. I think it is the yogurt. I loved the wintry holiday flavor and would make it again, although I agree that it is more like a coffee cake and may serve it at my next brunch.

Good flavor, and I didn't find it too dry (baked for 50-55 min.). But it works better as a coffee cake, not as an after dinner dessert.

This cake has a good flavor, but I agree with the reviewer who wrote that the almond flour gives the cake a crumbly and coarse texture. The cake is very much like a coffee cake recipe that I have often made, and I think the next go-round I will try to use all cake flour for a smoother texture. Also agree that the baking time is far, far too long. My cake was very well-baked at 50 minutes.

Cake it excellent! I have made this cake twice, the fist time I used sour cream in place of yogurt, batter was very thick and I thought that was the reason it stuck to pan. Next time I used yogurt, batter was more like cake batter before folding in nuts and berries. and I got less sticking, glad to hear I am not alone. Next time I will bake less. Couldn't find almond flour so I just processed a heaping 3/4 cup of almonds and added. Great flavor. Also added cranberry juice to icing, gave it a slight pink color.

I baked this cake twice and I think the almond flour is causing the texture to be crumbly. So on my second try I used 1/4 cup less almond flour and added 1/4 cup all purpose and that seemed to fix the issue. I used trader joes dried cranberries with orange juice which adds a great layer of flavor. It can easily be a morning coffee cake! It smells wonderful in the oven.

Tastes like the holidays! I am so excited to make this cake for my holiday gifts. I took it out early, as suggested, and it was moist and flavorful.

This cake turned out delicious. I agree with everyone who says be careful not to overbake. I checked mine after 50 minutes and it was ready. The toasted almonds are a must but I think you could use all fresh or all dried cranberries to simplify the recipe. Give this cake another try and take it out of the oven early.

Great cake. Great Flavors. DANGER - be careful not to overcook! Cake was done in 40 to 45 minutes - whoever came up with 1 hr 10 min?? If your cake was dry - you overcooked it. Watch carefully. Can't wait to make it again and tweak the ingedients.

This is a wonderful recipe. My cake was moist and flavorful. I did double the glaze, but I think all other ingredients are nicely proportioned. My husband loved this cake, as did everyone with whom I shared. I will definitely be making this again throughout the Holiday season. This would be a great gift.

I thought this was fantastic. The Chinese 5 spice lends a deep and complex flavor to the cake. I did not have dried cranberries on hand so I used approx 1.5 cups fresh and thought it could use even more. I am a bit neurotic about overbaking things so I made sure to pull the cake out when it had *just* transitioned from being wet in the center to leaving a few scant crumbs on the tester and it came out perfectly, nice and moist. I didn't use the glaze at all as I found the cake to be sweet enough as is and I plan to toast up slices later in the week when it's no longer as fresh.

I've already made this cake twice in the last week. It is perfect for the season. The almond meal and almond add a lot of flavor - I found the almond meal easily at Trader Joe's but it wasn't at the local super market. My only recommendations would be to add extra cranberries and make about twice as much glaze with about 3 teaspoons of liquid.
