I have made this so many times, and I have never cooked the bacon ahead of time. It always comes out crispy and something about the fat from the bacon melting into the onions helps with flavor. It is sublime :)

Made this as an appetizer for an Oktoberfest party we were going to. Had to make my own creme freche, (easy), this was awesome. My SO doesn't care for onions so I did one with sauteed mushrooms and bacon. Both were totally gone. Even the kids loved it!

Absolutely LUSCIOUS! I have made this several times with rave reviews. You can make your own creme fraiche by adding 2 tbls buttermilk to heavy cream and let it sit out til thick.

The flavor is very close to the fabulous tart flambee we had in Alsace. Make sure the crust is crackly thin. I wouldn't bother w/ sour cream. The French has just crème fraîche.

this is the first time i've ever rated a recipe so low. the tart just didn't do it for me. i test-cooked it 3 times prior to having guests and ultimately abandoned the idea of serving it. sorry.

De-lish! I read the other reviews and made a few adjustments accordingly: my cheese mix was constituted of ricotta, yogurt, and chevre; I carmelized the onions; and I omitted the bacon for the vegetarians in the bunch. It turned out great--everyone loved it!

I plan to make this for the third time tonight. The cheese and onion combination with crunchy bits of bacon has wonderful flavor. I carmelized the onions and cooked the bacon before adding to the cheese topping as others mentioned. The second time I prepared the recipe, my husband suggested waiting until closer to the finished baking time before adding the bacon. The dough was lovely with proscuitto, fontina and Parm-Reg cheeses, too.

I made the tart, following the recipe exactly as written, and it was delicious as well as a big hit with the family. I'm having friends over this weekend and plan on making it again.

Made this dish for the third time yesterday and found I didn't have any cottage cheese so substituted yogurt for the cottage cheese and sour cream and will continue to do so in the future. I'm mildly lactose intolerent and had no problem as I did with the cottage cheese. My milk loving husband said it was every bit as good.

This recipe was a sucess for me. I served it as a starter before a dinner party. Like the other reviewers, I cooked the bacon half-way first, which was a good idea. It's impossible to find creme fraiche in my small town, so I used 1 cup of sour cream blended with the cottage cheese instead. It turned out great.

Like the previous two reviewers, I sauteed and drained both the onions and bacon. You can make this recipe into EZ by eliminating the dough and using 7-inch Greek Pita rounds, setting the oven at 400 for 10 minutes. Mixed greens, chopped apples and toasted nuts make a good go-with salad.

It was great and easy to make. Like the previous reviewer I cooked the bacon first to get rid of some of the fat. I also lowered the temperature to around 470. It was perfect. My husband likes it so much. We had it 2 days in a row.

could not think of using raw bacon without dredging fat fromit,so fried it fairly crisp,drained it on paper towels.then poured most of fat from pan and sauted the onions till they released most of their water,then went on with recipe.
