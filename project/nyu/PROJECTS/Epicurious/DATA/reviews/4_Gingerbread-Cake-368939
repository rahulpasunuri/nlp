Thanks for all your help, reviewers! I used 1/4 cup molasses and 1/4 cup light corn syrup; added 1/2 teaspoon espresso powder. Wonderful flavor! Hard to get out of pan, though; grease parchment WELL and let it cool quite a bit before attempting to remove it from inverted cake. I skipped the icing; it didn't need it.

Delicious, and appreciated by numerous accomplished bakers in my family. I doubled recipe and used a 10" bundt pan, but did not need double the frosting. Very moist!

This is really easy to make, looks like it took more effort than it did, easy to serve, and a great compliment to holiday meals. Lots of compliments on how the lemon curd gives it something extra, and looks extra fancy,too.

This was so good, we made another as soon as the first was gone. I use dark mollasses too--serve it with just regular vanilla-flavored, fresh whipped cream. It's moist and light with lovely flavor. The fresh ginger, and the absence of anything like cloves or nutmeg, makes it a really delicious cake--spicy and flavorful with out the "bite" of spice.

Made the cake recipe per the instructions at Christmas times and everyone loved it! In fact, I had to make two cakes! The one thing I did omit from the topping was the lemon curd, which I thought did nothing for the cake overall.

I made this for dessert on Christmas Day. It was easy and everyone loved it. I plan to make it again for another group on New Year's Day. The lemon cream topping is wonderful.

I doubled the recipe and placed it in a 9 x 13 pan. I too only had dark molasses so I did about 2/3 dark molasses and 1/3 light corn syrup. It worked out perfectly! It is so light and not too sweet. I will definitely be putting this recipe into my repertoire!

I also used dark molasses because that is the only one available at my grocery store. The gingerbread cake had a great flavor, and was really moist. The icing is really light and compliments the cake well. It's really simple to put together and would be perfect for a small holiday dinner party!

This was a nice gingerbread recipe. I used dark molasses as that was all that I had on hand and it had a stronger flavor that I liked. The whipped cream and lemon curd topping is fantastic. I started putting lemon curd on store bought gingerbread cake.
