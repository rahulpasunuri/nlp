This is an old family recipe. However, we always added sliced potatoes to the pan and fried them along with the pork chops. Absolutely delicious.

I've been making this for years, it works well with thick boneless pork chops.. what I do is, first brown the chops lightly in extra virgin oil and then add garlic. Add about 1/2 cup of liquid from roasted red peppers jar, and throw in a few hot banana ring peppers for a little heat. I simmer these in the liquid, on low-medium, covered, for about 30 minutes, then turn up the heat to medium-high, and use what's left of the liquid to carmelize the pork chops to a nice dark reddish-brown. I use a cast iron skillet to cook these in, but any skillet that can stand high heat cooking will work. It tends to ruin teflon-coating skillets over time, I've found.

My mom used to make pork chops with vinegar peppers, but after the pork chops were done she would set aside with peppers, and fry potatoes in same pan, and then add chop and peppers all together.

Used a pork loin cut and a combination of pickled peppers and jalepenos for the tartness. Threw out the garlic after I was done with the lid. Wife wants me to make this again in 3 days. Wow! It was almost fork tender.

I make this dish all the time. I also add a little beef stock to enhance the flavor of the juices. We like served over roasted potatos.

HAD NEVER MADE THIS B4 AND WANTED TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT. I ADDED SOME STRIPS OF SWEET ROASTED RED PEPPER FOR COLOR. NEXT TIME I THINK I WILL ADD A BIT OF CORNSTARTCH TO LIQUID TO THICKEN A BIT. SERVED OVER RICE.... NICE PRESENTATION :)

I love pork chops with just about anything but for some reason this recipe as is did not do it for us. So - with some revamping this is the version we really enjoy - I include about 8 cherry peppers seeded and washed to the pickled peppers, I substitute 1 cup beef stock for the 2T of pepper liquid and add 1/2 stick of butter. Remember that the chops continue to cook after removed from the pan so be careful not to overcook - we love it this way - derived from a great little bar / rest we enjoy in Rye.

I made this twice and both times got rave reviews. It makes a difference which pepperoncinis you use. The first time I used milder tarter ones, the second time hotter. I liked the first better

Very good - gave a very different perspective taste to pork chops. I honly hat had peperoncini - balance of mild and hot as recipe recommends would be better. Nice tang! Be careful not to overcook chops.
