I followed the directions to a tee and found this recipe to taste like sougy bread. I love most all desserts with berries, but this was definitely not one I am sorry to say. Easy to make, but not so tasty.

I've made this recipe several times and really enjoy it. My mom has been making a full fat version of blueberry pudding for years, and this is just as good without the guilt.

This was disgusting. Really and truly gross. We couldn't even finish our first taste. Yes, it's easy, but the preparation time is reflected in the flavor. Save yourselves ... use another blueberry recipe from this website (Bill's Blueberry Cobbler was pretty good)

This was yummy and fairly simple to make. A great low-fat alternative. Since we never eat applesauce, I made my own using just one apple so there wouldn't be any left over. Warning -- this dish doesn't keep very long -- I think 2 days is max.

This was tremendously simple to make. In my opinion, it's not an *elegant* dessert that you may want to feed to a formal dinner party, but it is certainly a *down-home* dessert that you would want to feed to your family or close friends. I would imagine it can be done with any type of berry-- frozen or fresh. In any case, WE LOVED IT. I will definitely make it again.

I lugged this recipe around with me for years before I finally made it this summer. It is SHOCKINGLY GOOD for such a simple dessert! i would definitely make it again, but next time I'd make it a mixed-berry affair with raspberries and blackberries. This sure was worth the wait!

Try using a good sour dough bread. So much more flavor. It's wonderful.

The blueberry pudding was excellent! So sweet and wonderful - and really easy to make! Absolutely perfect for summer when there are abundant and cheap blueberries...I used Italian bread this time and it was still really good... can't recommend this recipe enough!
