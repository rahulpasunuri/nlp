Delicious. Used doughboy's rollout pie crust. Would have had stronger maple flavor with Grade B syrup, but it didn't call for it (and I didn't have any).

Our family traditionally has pecan pie for our Thanksgiving dessert but this year following an accidental pecan pie catastrophy,(after which I was out of pecans but had plenty of walnuts)I turned to this recipe and to my surprise it received rave reviews. Everyone said I should definitely add it to the menu again next year. I used a different recipe for the shell due to time constraints but the only other change I made was to toast the walnuts before adding them to the filling. The grated orange zest is a must. Delicious!

You don't need that fake maple flavoring if you use grade b or c syrup. I got a great price on mine at www.saintpierrefarms.com

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and everybody loved it. The pie was easy to make- I used a store bought crust which made the recipe even easier. Definitely good with the whipped cream
