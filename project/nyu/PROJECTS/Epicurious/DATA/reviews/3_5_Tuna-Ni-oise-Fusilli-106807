This recipe was strangely satisfying. I am not a huge fennel fan and I wasn't expecting much but in the end this recipe felt good in my body and was pretty tasty. I used whole wheat rotini instead of fusilli and I used about 3 times the amount of green beans simply because I had them. I also used the roasted red peppers in a jar. I would add more olives than recommended and perhaps a squeeze of lemon juice the next time I make this... a nice, quick and easy meal.

I've been making this recipe since it appeared in Parade magazine in 2001 - so simple and delicious! I use kalamata olives, flat-leaf parsley, and sometimes Italian oil-packed tuna.
