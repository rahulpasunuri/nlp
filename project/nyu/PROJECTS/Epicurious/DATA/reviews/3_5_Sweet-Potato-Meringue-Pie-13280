I've made this for years...it's so simple and so wonderful. I use my own crust recipe but the filling is wonderful and the meringue can be adjusted to your "sweetness" level.

I will not use this recipe again. I felt that the use of half and half dulled the flavor of the sweet potato and created a bland flavor, even with the use of spices. Perhaps my tastes lean toward a more traditional sweet potato pie.

I've made this recipe since I got it from my first Gourmet magazine in 1995! It is an excellent traditional pie with a twist. Looks VERY impressive if you add the meringue with a pastry bag to create peaks. Have always gotten rave reviews when bringing this to dinner.

Excellent side dish at our Thanksgiving dinner. I also saved time by doing the potatos in the microwave. I think you need something sweet like whipped cream to go with it. It gots raves from everyone.

A simple, easy sweet potato pie!! To save time, I microwaved the sweet potato. I also left out the meringue, since I don't like it. This pie comes in handy for potlucks, or for people who "hate pumpkin pie" I have added this recipe to my permanent collection

This is a great pie. But it is very sweet. If you use the meringue as a decoration and not just a topping, it makes this pie LOOK impressive too!

this recipe was very good. it was light, fluffy and very flavorful. i made it without the meringue and used whipped cream instead.
