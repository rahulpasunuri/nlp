I had Vermouth but don't care for the taste of it, so I used Madeira instead. I would also recommend Sherry as it is always tasty in cream sauces. I did not have tarragon so I used dill instead. Dill is a great seasoning with Salmon so it was a nice match. I tend to make mashed potatoes, topped with the salmon, and then cover with the sauce. I serve roasted Brussel sprouts along side. Big hit with a foodie family.

This is a beautiful dish -- If you like tarragon as much as I do, I would add half the amount of parsley and make up for it with fresh tarragon.

Have made this 2-3 times for dinner parties. Use half and half instead of cream. Use a lemon herb fish rub along with salt and pepper to season the fish and oven roast it rather than pan fry for ease with company. Always a big hit with my guests. Usually serve it with a wild rice pilaf to soak up the sauce.

Ive made this a few times. I use olive oil instead of butter and infuse it with garlic and red peppers. If you dont have leeks, use scallions

I've made this several times. It's delicious as written, but I find it easier and just as tasty to oven roast the salmon rather than pan fry.

I've made this quite a few times; I use Ouzo (or Pernod or anything anise-flavored) instead of the vermouth.

I love this combination and used it many times. I also use white wine.

In response to Cambridge, I made this by broiling the salmon and using fat-free half and half. It was fine, no curdles, but I cooked the sauce at a lower temp (medium). I think this would be better with white wine, I didn't care for the tarragon/vermouth combination.

Yep!!

Good salmon recipe. I used white wine instead of vermouth for the sauce. I'm not a vermouth lover...is vermouth typically bitter? The stuff I tasted was. Also, I baked the salmon drizzled with a little olive oil, salt & pepper. It all turned out great.

Terrific recipe!!! I grilled the salmon instead and it was wonderful.

Has anyone tried preparing a lower fat version of this recipe? I tried using cream diluted with milk in the sauce. However, when I added this to the leeks and vermouth it produced cheesy curdles. I had to throw these out and the sauce didn't thicken. Still tasted OK but didn't look very nice.

Easy and tastes great. Didn't use the flour - didn't miss it either.

Delicious! I cut the recipe in half when making it for the family.
