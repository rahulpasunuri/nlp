Very tasty. I used butternut squash and put it in at the same time as the potatoes. They squash still ended up a bit tougher than the potatoes but not badly so. The cranberries were a nice, tart, addition to a very sweet dish.

how do you peel an acorn squash?

The cooking instructions make little to no sense at all. First of all I wouldn't have a child trying to peel a butternut squash, let alone an acorn squash. Then after you bake the softer of the two, sweet potato or yam, you add the harder of the two, acorn or butternut squash. I can see the potential in this dish, but not as written.

Easy to prepare for any holiday (even Thanksgiving). I combined yams and sweet potatoes which benefited from about 10 minutes more time in the oven before adding the squash and craisins. Reheats well. It was a big hit at our meal.

It needed an extra 30 mins to cook (I wish I had read that review first!) And was still a little dry - I added more sugar than called for. I think I will stick with just candied sweet potatoes next time, for the amount of sugar I wound up adding. However the squash did add a nice taste, my table just preferred the more traditional dish.

Delicious, but needed an extra 1/2 hour of bake time. Would make this recipe again.

Wonderful way of serving sweet potato and squash. This will become part of all my turkey dinners!

12/28/01: The orange, yellow, dark red, and brown are so colorful! Delicious and aromatic as well. This easy dish is the perfect thing to bring to a Thanksgiving potluck. I also recommend putting the squash in at the same time as the sweet potatoes, increasing the cranberries to 1/3 cup, pushing the cranberries down to the bottom of the pan so they don't darken, and combining the brown sugar and cinnamon thoroughly before sprinkling. 11/28/02: Now I think the squash should be put in at the time the recipe suggests. It was too soft compared to the sweet potatoes and yams. I stand by my other suggestions, though!

I also cooked the butternut squash and sweet potatoes together, like Ann. I could not find dried cranberries at my store during September so I used 1/2 can of whole cranberries and mixed with 1 diced apple and 1 pear to the cranberries and brown sugar, and then added to the sweet potatoes and squash after it had cooked for 20 minutes. After the dish was completely cooked I added small marshmellows on top and placed back into the oven for 10 minutes or until marshmellows were slightly browned. This added an extra special SWEETNESS, and everyone said it was their favorite Rosh Hashanah dish. We added this recipe link to our Just 4 Kids Magazine. www.geocities.com/just4kidsmagazine

This was a big hit, and not too much work. If you choose to use butternut squash (as I did), I would put it in at the same time as the sweet potatoes, rather than 20 minutes later. The textures were too discordant otherwise. I substituted olive oil.

This was excellent. I added a little more sugar and oil (olive) than the recipe. The cranberries were great.

I served this to my family as part of Easter dinner (does that make me a bad person?) alongside ham, asparagus, spoonbread and baked apples. I used acorn squash, dried cranberries (because I couldn't locate cherries) and a sauteed sweet onion. I threw this quick and easy dish together the night before and reheated it in the oven (it held up fine). The sweet-n-sour flavors in this dish really work well together. Those with discriminating tastes, and even the kids, raved about this dish and went back for seconds.
