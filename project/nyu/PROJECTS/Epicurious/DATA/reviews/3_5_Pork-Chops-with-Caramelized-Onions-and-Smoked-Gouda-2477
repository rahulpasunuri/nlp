I have to agree with the other reviewers that said this recipe is definitely missing something. It was nothing special, but was not bad either. I wouldn't make it again and would not recommend trying this out if you are trying to "wow" anyone. The pork does come out really tender though.

I halved the recipie for four pork chops (family of 4)and eyeballed the broth, then baked it in a stone ovenproof dish with a cover. My husband and I liked it using up some remnants of gourmet cheese from a party(not the recommended Gouda)on top and the teenagers opted to go without any cheese at the last minute. They heartily approved of the pork and everyone loved the caramelized onions.

This was a good alternative to our usual pork chops. Very rich and fillings on a cold winter's night. The onions and gouda definetly peped up an otherwise bland pork chop. I used equal parts low sodium chicken and low sodium beef broth. I dont think this will be a keeper.

Two and half forks from me as well. The gouda on the pork chops made the chops extremely rich. And, as other readers said below, the porkchops seemed to lack something. Perhaps some tomato or thyme would have rounded out the flavors. Decent dish but nothing spectacular.

We made this back in 1995 when it was on the cover of Bon Appetit. It was fantastic and our friends still talk about it. A couple of suggestions, don't wipe out the pan and make and bake in same pan, we suggest Le Crueset Braiser. No need for extra dirty dishes.

This was a hit with all of us (including a lucky neighbor who happened to shovel my walk in exchange for a hot meal)! Even my 14-year-old & his best friend (13) loved it & asked for seconds. I used herb broth squares (HerbOx) dissolved in boiling water for the broth instead of beef broth. I made the dish up until the step that says you can cover it & refrigerate it till the next day. I'm glad I did because it snowed that night! I undercooked the pork a bit so that it wouldn't be dry when I reheated it the next day (instead of baking it for 45 minutes, I baked it for 30). The onions were the perfect sweet foil to the smoky gouda. This recipe is a winner! Thanks for sharing.

Two and a half forks from my view, but my husband loved it. While it had some unique flavors from the onions & gouda I thought it was missing something....thyme? more garlic? Just seemed to lack depth. That said, I might make it again, but it won't be in regular rotation - too time consuming for the result. I took other reviewers' suggestions and used a combination of chicken and beef broth, otherwise followed the recipe pretty faithfully. Found the gravy a bit too thick, but easy to fix with additional broth.

Rating: 4
So much better than what I had expected! My husband was on cloud nine... :) My only change was that I doubled the garlic (we love garlic), and while I was making the gravy, I added a little more beef stock. The flavor of the onions in the gravy was amazing! Served with steamed veggies and mashed potatoes, will DEFINITELY make this again!

This dish is fantastic. I made it exactly as it was written and wouldn't change a thing! My husband moaned during the whole meal!

The pork chops and onions and gouda were all very tasty together, but the gravy was quite bland. A more experienced chef may have been able to make it a little more interesting, but I was unable to improve it without more guidance from the recipe. We wound up eating it without any gravy at all, and that was okay, but not better than any other pork chops I've had.

First off, the dish turned out so good that my boyfriend said he thought it was the best home-cooked meal he'd ever had. That said, I changed it a bit. I never baked them. I carmelized onions, etc while browning the pork chops, and them simmered them together in the broth and they were so tender and flaborful they were to die for! Also used no gouda, because they were rich enough on their own. Served with Greek salad and spanakopita--made a great meal :)

Rating: 4
It was a lot of work or I wasn't organized but it was well worth it. These chops turned out so tender! The carmelized onions were a nice mellow flavor with the the stronger smoked gouda and the combination was fantastic. I made for my sister & her husband and my brother-in-law kept saying "this is excellent" throughout the meal. ALSO...great suggestion for the sauted carrots as the accompaniment - it was a perfect fresh taste to uplift the heavier flavors of the pork/gouda.

Rating: 4
Loved this dish!!!! I get requests to make it ALL the time! It's much better when adding 1 can low sodium chicken broth and 1 can low sodium beef broth, instead of full sodium beef broth. The full sodium broth leaves the pork tasting only like the beef broth and way too salty. With the low sodium chicken/beef mix, you can actually taste the pork chop and other flavors. It's YUMMY!

Rating: 2
This was OK, but I don't think it was worth the work involved. It tasted like pork chops with caramelized onions and gouda, which is fine, but there weren't really other flavors to blend everything together. I cooked it 10 minutes less than recommended and it was still overcooked--I'm sure it would've been better if I had taken it out after 25 minutes.

Rating: 3
The gravy was very tasty in this dish. I skipped the cheese and served mashed potatoes and red cabbage as side dishes. The onions are the secret ingredient here.

Rating: 4
Rich! Definitely rich! And the gouda makes it even richer. This is something to serve with light vegetables. I think someone mentioned that sauteed carrots were recommended. I will do that next time. I made this with simple mashed potatoes, and spinach.

Rating: 3
This was delicious. I used one can of beef broth, one can of chicken broth and a can of water. Pork is very tender. Sauce did not thicken but was excellent. Mashed potatoes would be a good side dish. My picky 7yr.old loved it. The whole family did. Was great. Will add a touch of cream next time just to see how that tastes.

The onions made this dish. Next time I will brine the chops before I cook them. Mixing chicken broth and beef broth makes a difference.

Rating: 3
I made this as a dish for 2 and it was exceedingly easy to do and turned out really well. I used chicken stock in place of beef stock as I took heed of the warnings of saltiness by the other reviewers, and it was perfect. Pork is moist and the sweetness of the onions combined with the smokiness of the cheese really made for a great combination.

Rating: 4
I really enjoyed this recipe. It was certainly something different if you are looking for a change. I agree that it was a little salty and next time, I too will use low-sodium beef broth. The carmelized onions, in my opinion, make the dish. I chose to serve dinner with stuffed potatos and had an appetizer of mediterranean relish bruschetta. Made for a great Valentine's Day meal.

after I browned the chops, I deglazed the pan with balsamic vinegar (sherry would be good too) and then I added the onions. I didn't add the sugar to the onions, because of the vinegar and the flavor of the onions were incredible!! This is great recipe and a welcome change from shake n bake!

Rating: 3
3.5 forks actually. My husbamd really liked this dish. The only things I would change would be to use lower sodium beef broth as it was a little salty for my taste and I would cook the chops about 10 minutes less. Although they were tender I prefer them to be softer when I cut through them.

Rating: 3
This was very good, the pork was melt in your mouth tender. I made it using just one pork chop, but to cover the pork with broth when I baked, needed to make half of the sauce recipe. Added more flour to the sauce to thicken and more sugar when carmalizing my onions. It made a fair amount of gravy so next time will also serve with mashed potatoes. Good cool weather comfort food.

Rating: 3
I'm somwhere around 2.5 forks. This recipe is good and with efficient preparation is not that time consuming but I just didn't think there was a WOW flavor like all the other reviewers have been saying. I used regular Gouda, not smoked, but I can't imagine that makes the difference. I don't like smoked gouda. The meat was very tender and all in all it was a good dinner just not one that I would serve to guests. I served this with the Caraway Noodles and Sauteed Carrots.

Well, the kids cleaned their plates, so did my husband, so did I. I guess it's a keeper. I only gave it 3 forks though because, while it was good, it lacked something. I'm thinking I'll add some apple brandy or apple vinegar or something to the broth next time. This really needed something to cut and balance the sweetness of the Paprika and carmelized onions.

This was ok.. but not great! I also had problems with getting the cheese to melt. Im not sure I like smoked gouda. I would have rather had pan fried pork chops with garlic.

I made this recipe for a dinner party I had and al of my guest loved it! I did change the suace a little though. I reduced the cooking fluid by half added some cream, reduced some more and then slowly incorporated some of the gouda. It went great with roasted red potatoes.

I substituted chicken instead of pork- and more smoked Gouda and my husband thought it ws great. I will definitely make this again-with CHICKEN.

Has quickly become one of our favorites, especially accompanied by rotkraut and sauteed Australian sweet potatoes. The 5 Tbsp of flour, however, produced a gummy gelatinous goo. Half that amount did the trick.

I've already reviewed this recipe and we thought it was wonderful. I'd like to make this for a dinner party I'm having and I'd like an opinion from anyone out there as to whether or not you think this would make a good dish using chicken cutlets in lieu of pork. My sis-in-law won't eat pork. Thanks!

I will add this recipe to my personal cooking file. I found it easy to make and very impressive to serve. The description of "Melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add 5 tablespoons flour. Cook, until mixture just begins to color, whisking often (mixture will be dry and crumbly)," is not accurate though. It actually is a viscous substance that when combined with the broth from the pan juices it becomes a mouth watering gravy. I had enough gravy to use for a fresh turkey that I made 2 days later. I would change nothing about this recipe and I was able to find all the ingredients at my local grocer.

Aren't pork chops the ultimate comfort food? These chops are especially good and the carmelized onions are a nice twist. Leave the recipe as is and try it - you're gonna like it and so will your dinner companions.

Yes, I would definatly recommend this recipe. The first time you make it it seems hard but it is so good it's worth it. Great to serve on a cold winter night with smash potatoes and green salad with warm bread.

I've made this several times since it came out in Bon Appetit magazine. It's one of my favorites! I've done many modifications, but I think the original is still the best. in the magazine, the accompanying side dish is buttered egg noodles; which is great with the sauce. However, at christmas time I splurged and made spaetzle! That was perfect!

Each year around the holidays, my family comes over for dinner and I do my best to impress them, and show up every other cook in the family. This dish did the trick. I followed the directions exactly and obtained perfect results. Highly recommended.

I cook for friends frequently, and they all agree that this is the best meal I have EVER made! I substituted leeks for the onions (because I just love leeks) and threw in some assorted mushrooms as well. Very rich and absolutely delicious, however time-consuming it may be.

Being a cheese and garlic lover, I added more to my taste. I also added a little Marsala to the gravy, I felt it needed a little more flavor. Will definitely make again and will try preparing ahead of time for a mid-week dinner.

I've made this twice now, and I found the original recipe too rich, although delicious. The second time I made it, I simplified it, and it tasted much better. I omitted the cheese entirely, and made the sauce thinner by cutting down the flour to 1 Tbsp for each four chops. The result was superb--the flavour was all there, and the chops were tender and delicious.

While this dish was very good, it was extremely time consuming. We took the advice of others, and did the onions at the same time as browning the pork-thank goodness or we may have never eaten! We're not sure if we'd make this again-my husband says no, whiel I say mabey. The pork was VERY tender!

I added wild mushrooms to the dish and it went well. I thought the sauce and the gouda cheese on the chops were wonderful! The chops came out very tender and flavorful! I served this will roasted garlic potatoes, next time I will take the previous reviewers recommendation and serve it with roasted garlic mashed potatoes. Will definately make this again!

This recipe was FABULOUS...I substituted applewood smoked mozzarella and it turned out just fine. The gravy is wonderful (especially served over mashed potatoes.) I have made it 3 times and everyone raves about it. If you cook the onion in a separate skillet it only takes about one hour to prepare the whole meal!

Great dish; however I disagreed with the preparation methods of the recipe. It took too long to prepare everything (I started at 6 PM and we didn't eat until 9 PM). I think I would rather start my onions in a different skillet before I browned my chops. Other than the time it took to prepare--this was a great meal!

This recipe makes one of the greatest gravies in the world. The pork chops are very tender after being cooked in the beef broth, and the carmelized onions give the dish wonderful flavor.
