This soup is delicious! My husband even loves it and while he IS a veggie eater, I was worried about a broccoli soup. We do not use the egg or olives, just because hubbie isn't a fan. But the soup is great on it's own with some yummy warm bread. I was surprised to find that my 2 1/2 lbs of broccoli was a TON of broccoli, but I used it all anyway. The only thing that I did differently was that I chose to add the florets to the same pot as the stalks near the end of the cooking, which then required that I add more chicken stock to properly steam it all. Because of that, I added more nutmeg and black pepper (probably double or triple the amount), and also used 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1. I've also been adding some cayenne pepper to the soup each time I reheat it. I just like a little heat in my food :-) I also pureed everything, I prefer the texture that way. A delicious soup, very healthy in spite of the cheese, which, if you keep your serving size average, is not that much cheese per serving given how much soup I got! We've been eating it all week.

We made this soup last year for friends prior to Trick or Treating. Presentation is great but also very yummy! Ten year old loved the leftovers in her lunch box the next day...

I didn't stop at Halloween with this recipe. Because of how amazing it is, I make it year round. I always add the egg just for added protein but it doesn't always have the olive. I prefer to puree the whole batch so that it isn't too chunky because it helps with easy digestion. I plan on making my baby's food so when she gets to the chunky/puree stage this definitely will be something she'll try. Best part, pureeing the whole batch makes it ideal for adult and baby alike.

this was great fun for Halloween lunch! The kids were a little wary at first, but finally dove in and found the cheese made "spider webs" in their soup. A second eyeball looked even better in each bowl.
