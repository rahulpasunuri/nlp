Glad I read reviews first...it doesn't take a lot of milk /half & half before they get to the right consistency. I made double the recipe, but think I could have added more horseradish. Made the a day ahead and put them in a slow cooker. Cooker was rubbed with a bit of butter first so potatoes don't crust and then a towel placed directly over cooker with the lid on top of the towel to absorb extra condensation. Cooked on low for 3 hours before dinner. Excellent way to serve piping hot mashed potatoes! Loved the flavor; a perfect accompaniment for ham.

Very tasty but start with one cup of the milk; I used 1 1/3 and it made the potatoes too thin.

Well I liked it, but the majority of my family didn't!! Hrm... I think they just don't like horseradish...

made this for Thanksgiving and it was amazing. The flavor of the horseradish comes out when it is hot! I made the day in advance and reheated covered in the oven and it was amazing.

Yum! These are great! I followed the recipe, combining the horseradish, garlic and milk in a pan and heating through...this totally helped the horseradish permeate the potatoes to help eliminate "hot pockets" as another reviewer mentioned. Added more butter, but less milk. And extra horseradish. :) Great with our grilled pork!

I made this for Thanksgiving three years ago and everyone asks if I am making it again. My answer is always yes! This is a delicious twist on regular old mashed potatoes.

Slight variation to make it kosher -chicken broth and margarine instead of milk and butter. Still delicious. Great with bistro style brisket, a family recipe using carmelized onions, lots of red wine and mushrooms.

Yummy! Perfect with roast beef. Watch the quantity of milk - came out a little runny. I recently invested in a potatoe ricer and have had the most marvellous results (and comments) ever since.

A couple of minor things. #1. You do not need to bring the milk and garlic to a boil in a saucepan. Instead. Cook the potatos, drain, and return to pot as recipe calls for. Then, put the milk, butter,garlic and horseradish in a microwaveable dish and nuke them for 3 minutes until hot. Then, add slowly to potatos and whip potatoes using an electric mixer. Season with salt and pepper to taste, whip again to blend seasonings. You can hold these covered on "warm" on top of your stove for about 1 hour at the most. At which time, you'll need to add more milk, and adjust salt and pepper to taste. **Our company loved them! I served these with the Blue-Cheese-Crusted Steaks with a red wine sauce (on this site), Sauteed Spinach, and bread. I did put a sprig of fresh parsley in the mashed potatoes for garnish. I noticed that gentleman at the party, added quite a bit of my gravy to these, however, he also, had two portions AND took a tupperware container of more potatos home! So, I guess they were a hit! :-)

This is an excellent potatoe dish and went perfect with the Mahogany Beef Stew. However, after boiling the potatoes, I simply drained them, then added the butter, horseradish, garlic and just a little milk (as needed), then whipped them up with an electric mixer. It was a big hit with my company!

We have grown to love these mashed potatoes with everything! I first tried them with the Mahogany Beef Stew- Perfect! I did however and have since halved the milk. We like lumpier potaoes- other than that they are fantastic with everything especially beef and lamb.

My family was not crazy about this recipe. We love horseradish normally, but somehow it didn't tast right in the mashed potatoes. Won't be trying this one again.

Rating: 3
I was worried this would be too strong and clash with Pork Tenderloin with Mojo sauce (also from this website), but I think 1/4 of a cup of horseradish is good. I was a little conservative, didn't use quite a 1/4 cup, and the taste was very subtle, not overpowering at all. Don't be afraid of the horseradish, it's the right amount. It also went well with the pork.

Teriffic. I used half-and-half instead of whole milk. This is an easy recipe for perfect creamy mashed potatoes. In the future, however, I might use slightly more prepared horseradish.

I have made these potatoes several times and each time everyone raves about them. Try making them with wasabi instead to make them green. (wasabi is a japanese paste made with horseradish)

What a terrific side dish! I served it at a family dinner with hickory smoked pork ribs, my great-grandma's cole slaw (dissolve cider vinegar in sugar to taste, add 1T celery seed and non-fat sour cream and toss with shredded cabbage and carrots) and garlic bread. I think the real key is mixing the potatoes so well that there are no "hot-pockets" of horseradish...just a permeating flavor throughout the potatoes. Leftovers were excellent when reheated.

Great! We're normally a garlic mashed potatoes or roasted potatoe kind of family. It's a definite departure. This recipe is excellent with Mahogany Beef Stew and Beer Bread!

I'm not normally a fan of mashed potatoes, but these are soooo good! I made them with the "herb-coated lamb with port-red wine sauce" on this site for Christmas day dinner and they were perfect. I found myself heating up the leftovers the next day for lunch.

Excellent recipe! I'd add some extra salt, but other than that, these are better than just about any other mashed potatoes I can remember making!

Everyone loved these potatoes....but no one at the table could identify the "mystery" ingredient. Next time I will add less milk...they were a little runny for my taste, but worked well with the Mahogany Beef Stew with Red Wine and Hoisin Sauce.

This recipe is a classic cold weather accompaniment to soups, stews and roasts. I slice the potatoes and leave the skin on and to the recipe I add buttermilk (about 2 cups more or less to taste) and chopped parsley. From time to time I'll add parma ham or chunks of good market style bacon. Add sea salt and fresh ground pepper at the end and voila! This is perfect for big holiday get togethers, kids and adults love it!

I've been making a variation on this dish for several years -- same ingredients, slightly different proportions and method. The horseradish gives a lovely zip to the potatoes, which go over great in my family.

Another great twist on mashed pots. Very good with the mahogany beef stew. The only thing I did differently was to saute the garlic in a little of the butter before adding the milk. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. We really enjoyed these.

I've made this recipe a handful of times. It's great, easy and tasty. The household gives it a nice kcik This is a very quick side dish you can make ahead. Goes great with beef dishes as well as roasted turkey, ham and chicken.

I didn't follow the directions at all, but I never do when it comes to mashed potatoes. You don't need to. Just eyeball it, add a little milk, butter, garlic, horseradish... taste... add a little, taste... add a little, taste. Lather, rinse, repeat. The horseradish is a terrific addition and this is a perfect accompaniment to the Mahogany Beef Stew with Hoisin Sauce. Great flavors. Even my boyfriend who doesn't usually like horseradish liked the flavor of these potatoes. I'll be making this often.

These potatoes were fantastic! I skipped the milk/garlic process (seemed like too much milk anyway) and just mashed the potatoes with the horseradish, butter and about 1/2 cup of milk. Was a perfect match for the mahogany beef stew. I think this recipe will become my staple for mashers.

This recipe was okay. I would not use all of the milk mixture or all of the butter. It is way too much. I almost ended up with potato soup.

these potatoes are great. however i added about 1/2 cup of horseradish and i used roasted garlic(about 4 cloves)i prefer the russet potatoes rather than the yukon golds.

I was making this dish for my family, so I was expecting something great. Well, lets just say when the steaks were ready (and cooling off) I was preparing the above dish and it was like a bowl of grits. I ended up throwing the whole dish in the trash (not even to the dogs)! A total disappointment. I would use like a 1/2 cup milk then see from there.

This is an excellent dish. My guests have loved it. I used non-fat half & half to cut down on the calories and didn't use as much as the recipe calls for.

While I loved the flavour of these potatoes, I, too, ended up with potato soup! I followed the directions carefully (I'm a chemist and love to measure) and only added about 1/3 of the milk mixture! Will try again, with a few adjustments.

The horseradish provided a great kick to simple mashed potatoes. My guests raved about it and begged me for the recipe. I originally made it with the Mohogany Stew, and it was a perfect compliment. Since then I have made it along side of roast chicken and a baked ham. I did use extra pototoes because I found the mash was a bit runny. But all in all, I loved it.

Served these with the Mahogany Beef Stew and they were delicious. I used russet potatoes and they needed quite a lot of milk. I think the amount will vary with the kind and age of the potatoes, just start with less and add more as you go along. You can heat it in the microwave quickly and easily. I think adding all the liquid before the butter makes better mashed potatoes.

Fabulous flavor. I used extra garlic and very litle milk so that the potatoes weren't runny. Simple recipe.

Good recipe. Horseradish amount just right for our family. Will cut back on milk next time, as we like our mashed potatoes a little thicker. Served with Mahogany Beef Stew (another good recipe).

Not being a horseradish lover, I did enjoy this. A nice change from garlic mashed, or other flavored potatoes.

We loved this dish! I had it once in a restaurant and this was an exact replica. Perfect with beef dishes. I cut down a little on the horseradish and still had a lot of the flavor coming through. Served it with the stew as suggested and even with stew on top, you couldn't miss the horseradish. A keeper!

These potatoes are incredible and have quite a surprising kick! They are great with the Mahogany Beef Stew from the same issue. The kick of the potatoes is the perfect complement to the smoothness of the stew.

I LOVED these potatoes. Unique but not weird. Not only that but I floored all my relatives by making these with beef stew on a camping trip. The only change I made was using fat free half and half instead of the milk. They were creamy and wonderful with great flavor.

These were great potatoes. I didn't use quite so much milk, and the texture was very soft, which was fine with us. If you like them stiffer, just use less milk. I also used about half as much horseradish (I have a three year old, so I figured I'd better go easy) and we thought the flavor was great.

Usually I make mashed potatoes without a measuring cup or a scale, simply adding milk or cream to a bowl of potatoes until the consistency is right. In this case, given the "horseradish factor", I weighed the potatoes and measured the liquid like a NASA scientist. And I got potato soup!
