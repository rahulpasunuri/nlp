Labor intensive, but fabulous!!!!! I am so glad I found this recipe on the website. I serve it every year. I thought another tart recipe I found on the site was the one I usually made, but this is it!

I used the squeezable chocolate from the store to finish off. There was none left and all enjoyed to the point I was asked for this recipe afterwords. Kid friendly.

I love this tart! I make it whenever I do Thanksgiving or Christmas at my house! Especially good with Scharffenberger chocolate!

The All Butter Crust is really good - definitely make that. However, my tart ended up tasting very similar to a Pecan Pie (which is fine); I just hoped for more caramel in the flavor. This recipe makes a very large tart but, it is tasty.

I've made this tart countless times and it's always the recipe people ask for. It's easy and oh so yummy!

I forgot to add the honey and this tart still turned out great! A great addition to my dessert repertoire.

I agree with the reviewer who said the honey taste was a bit strong. I cut it down to 1/4 cup, and substituted an additional 2 TBS of butter + 2 TBS of dark brown sugar. I also threw in a tsp of vanilla. Guests who are expecting a traditional pecan pie are wowed by the taste. The crust is time-consuming, but definitely worth it.

I've made this recipe many times as well the recipe in Bon Appetit. They're nearly identical. I had a friend offer to pay me to make this for a dinner party for her after I gave her the recipe which is somewhat intimdating. I even made a mistake once and doubled the cream and it still came out great.

This tastes great and looks even better with the chocolate on top. I also agree that the honey taste was a little strong, next time I might combine some corn syrup to cut that flavor. I had a difficult time with the crust, and think I might try to substitute a premade dough next time to save some prep time, as well.

More notes on this great tart -- I've made it several times. Munchers ask for the recipe often. The runover effect described below: I have yet to experience this, but I do make sure to build up a small lip (higher than the pan's lip) on the edge, just in case. So far, it's bubbled while baking, but no mess. Chocolate: I thought, why not combine it rather than drizzle it? Excellent notion! Just melt the chocolate in with the butter, etc., and fill and bake as usual. Chocolate and gooey nuts in each bite! Nuts: I've tried all-walnut (tastes a bit like baklava), and walnut/unsalted cashew (splurge), next time walnut/hazlenut -- they're all delicious.

Has anyone made the Caramalized Nut Tart from Bon Appetit, December 1998? They sound very similar. Which is better?

This dessert turned out picture perfect. I found that good quality bittersweet chocolate works better than semisweet, and I put quite a bit of chocolate on top which made a big difference in the taste. This is a fabulous dessert

All the reviews are accurate. Used a 12 inch tart pan. No spillage (although had to make some additional dough). Substituted corn syrup for half the honey. Honey no longer a discernable flavor.

I made this for an end of summer picnic and it was a hit. The recipe was very easy. I will DEFINITELY make this again!

The absolute best dessert ever! I have made this on several occasions and everyone loves it. I finally learned that you can only use about 3/4 of the nut mixture. I make individual tartlets with the remaining pastry and nut mixture. Delicious! Much better served room temperature not even a little chilled.

I served this dessert at a small dinner over Thanksgiving weekend. While my guests raved about it, I was a little surprised the honey flavor was as strong as it was. It was a great alternative to the traditional Thanksgiving holiday desserts.

I had a similiar experience as Janna; my filling also overflowed the crust. It happened after the 30 minutes in the oven ( I felt it wasn't quite done). I did serve it and it was very well received. I was personally disappointed only because it had a stronger honey flavor than I expected and I'm not a fan.

I made this for Thanksgiving 1998, and I've gotten two requests for it again. I think I'll wait til next year- it's absolutely delicious but not easy or quick. The caramel is a bit tricky but worth it.

This was fabulous at Thanksgiving last year. I knew that it was a hit when the whole table got quiet and consumed it until there was none left. It will definately be a repeat this year. The tuiles were tricky (if you have the time), but tasty. As for the ice cream, it was great as well, but in a pinch I would substitute a good vanilla ice cream, melted and mixed with the crystallized ginger, and re-frozen.

I made this tart for Thanksgiving in 1998 and everyone raved about it. This is the only dessert that was all eaten even tho it is very rich. I always make the Gourmet Thanksgiving Dinner each year but My daughter wants the nut tart included this year also.

This recipe produced mixed results for me. Everything seemed fine until the caramel nut mixture was baked inside the crust. For some reason, the mixture expanded volcanically, overflowed the crust and landed on the heating element of my oven. This produced a lot of smoke. I panicked, pulled the tart out and shut off the oven. The tart hardened up just fine, perhaps almost too much so. The final dessert was both chewy and crunchy. I'm a nut lover and enjoyed it, but it simply wasn't a shure fire winner...perhaps due to my technical difficulties. The core elements still remain so appealing to me (caramel and nuts) that I think I'll try again, making sure that I give the mixture some room to grow. I served it with vanilla ice cream and it was enhanced. An easy way to drizzle on the chocolate finish is to place some bittersweet chips in a ziploc baggie and then microwave them. Then snip off a tiny tip of the bag and drizzle away. Enjoy!

Rave reviews from the entire family clan at Thanksgiving! It's great because people only need a tiny piece to feel decadent and satisfied.

I took this to my sister's for Thanksgiving. She said it was "like eating fifteen See's all at once". (There's no higher praise in her book.) I considered not putting the chocolate on top, but am glad I decided to. The tart really is not similar to pecan pie, as I had first expected, and the chocolate is an integral part of the whole. I didn't serve the ginger ice cream or the tuiles with it, because I didn't have the time or the energy. Nobody missed them, that I could tell! Wonderful recipe: relatively quick, and quite simple to do. The tart pan with removable bottom is almost a must.
