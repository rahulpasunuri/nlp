As an effort to use every part of the chicken, I've started making this a whole lot. I make only 1/3 of the recipe, and I use the heart and the gizzard that come inside the chickens I get. I made this for a game night at my house, and my 20-something friends demolished it in minutes. They couldn't wait for more!

Ihave yet to make this recipe but I have been making chicken liver pate for many years; this time I wanted to make a mousse so i needed to see ingredients and proportions. I read a few reviews and thought I'd comment: The quality of the chicken livers is very important to flavor; mass processed chickens produce lesser quality and potentially poorly flavored liver. Just as with the meat itself well fed, minimally processed chickens taste better. I make pate by sauteing the livers and shallots in butter (olive oil imparts its own flavor, goose or chicken or duck fat is even better) I cook the livers until mostly done, flame some liquor; brandy, sherry, calvados, whisky, armagnac, etc; it all works if you are in a pich or want to direct a flavor that way. I will finish in cream, add bay leaves and nutmeg and then process when cooled somewhat. I add cream and butter to taste with salt and pepper. You can add more of the liquor at this point if you want the liquor to bite. Sometimes I make it with 40% butter...I don't measure or time anything and it never turns out exactly the same but it is always well recieved!

I've made many terrines and pates - and this one is excellent. I loved the taste (used a good cognac, bad alcohol can mess things up!) so will certainly make it again. It's obvious that it can be tweaked with many different additions to alter the taste so I'll experiment with that. Truffles etc. Yum!

I liked the consistency of this - I used 8 oz. of chicken livers to just 4 egg yolks and it still came out very smooth. However, the flavor needed something more -- next time I would double the amount of shallots. For the cooks concerned about the discoloration of the top: float enough melted duck fat on top of the puree to cover the entire top of the terrine before baking. This will seal the terrine and keep the top nice and pink.

I just tried this recipe and loved it. Did not have any brandy or cognac--used red wine instead. Wish I had found this recipe years ago--I love chicken liver pate--but could never get it quite right. This will be a regular.

The mousse was, as billed, very smooth, but the taste was a bit bland. Also, the butter top was not attractive at all. There was no point in adding the bay leaves which were hidden under the butter. An aspic would have made a more decorative top.The recipe was easy, though, and the mousse did keep well, so I suppose it was worth making.

Incredibly easy to make. After reading the review about it being too brown on top I covered it with tinfoil and it turned out beautiful. Had no fresh bay leaves so used some fresh thyme sprigs instead and the flavour matched perfectly, plus they're edible. Didn't miss the port at all, it was all I expected just as written (the brandy was not extremely dry, maybe this is the reason)

First time I followed the recipe and it was good. The next time I added a small can of foie gras and a dash of port and it was quite exceptional. The foie gras and port definitely make it much more refined

I'm not usually the odd one out, but I thought this was awful. I made the recipe exactly (except used aspic to seal instead of butter) and it worked out perfectly without any problems. It just wasn't the taste I was looking for, so I guess it's a matter of opinion. I do think it's certainly a healthy version without all the fat, but I guess I was looking for a gutsier chicken liver mousse with a strong alcohol kick. If anyone can recommend a better recipe, I sure would appreciate it.

Well, this was my first attempt to use the water bath technique, and I pulled it off. The result was outstanding, and even my kids, who are not into chicken livers, liked this as a spread. However, the crowd at the party voted by leaving three dishes empty!

Prepared this recipe for a group of "foodies". The theme was simplified French. The trimming of the livers was the time consuming part of this this recipe, but after that it was a breeze. The wonderfully smooth texture was ode to using the the gentle water bath baking method. Served with a slightly sweet calimyrna fig confit to counter the savory richnesss of the mousse. Next time will experiment with the addition of truffle oil. Luxury in a bite.

AMAZING adn super easy!!!! Made it 3X already for the picky pallets at dinner parties, even self-professed liver haters gobbled it up. Gone in a flash!

YUM! my first attempt at making anything like this, and while it wasn't perfect it was still good (and the imperfections were entirely my fault and pretty much expected since i was extremely lazy and using a ghetto oven). used three small dishes instead of one, not sure if that contributed to mistakes. any ideas why they came out of the oven with browned/puffed tops? maybe because i didn't skim the foam off? wasn't really a problem though, i just sliced the puffed parts off and ate them immediately. but the recipe is so easy even without cutting corners, and the flavor was awesome. will definitely try again and be more faithful.

This was a wonderful addition to my french dinner party. The preparation was easy and it was great to be able to make it ahead of time, so I could concentrate on other things the night of the dinner! The guests all seemed to love it. I served it with olives, salted almonds and kir royals as my "little bites" course before dinner began!

Excellent recipe! Highly recommended. Super easy preparation, yet taste is not compromised in any aspect...delicate, not overwhelming, but still well rounded...would experiment by adding port to puree next time.
