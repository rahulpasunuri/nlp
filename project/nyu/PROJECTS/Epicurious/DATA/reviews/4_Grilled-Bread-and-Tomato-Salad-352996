WOW! this is fabo!!!! I broiled the bread instead of grilling, used heirloom tomatoes, more basil and no tarragon.

This was especially delicious with the addition of slices of fresh mozzerella.

Loved this for a great different summer salad to accompany steak. Added mozarella and used lemon vinaigrette.

I made this for our couples golf group and it was a big hit! I used olive oil with crushed garlic instead of butter; it's healthier and tastier. I used my homemade lemon vinegarette, fresh chopped chives, basil and parsley instead of onion, balsamic vinegar and tarragon. I reserved the juices from the chopped tomatoes and added them to the salad and then added the dressing. I'll definitely serve this again!

I will admit upfront that I made a lot of adjustments, but this was the recipe that inspired them so I'm reviewing here. Wonderful flavors! I brushed the bread with olive oil, grilled it then rubbed it with a garlic clove. Did not roast the tomatoes, did not add tarragon, added an English cucumber and some fresh mozzerella. But the flavors melded beautifully and I will definitely be making this again.

Mmmmmm. All the classic summer flavors rolled into one. We've made it three weekends in a row using ciabatta.

Fantastic. I used half store bought and half homegrown tomatoes. I eliminated the butter and used olive oil instead, then tossed in the cooked garlic into the salad. I didn't have any fresh tarragon but it didn't effect the flavors at all. Served over a best of lettuce for a really healthy veggie meal. Will soooo be making this again.

Even with grocery-store tomatoes, this was a hit. I grilled the tomatoes as suggested and was worried that they may have been too soft, but the flavors melded so well that it didn't matter. My husband and his brother raved, and polished off the bowl between them. I added some small cubes of leftover fresh mozzarella, and I think that it went well with the overall feel of the salad. My husband has already requested an encore!

I love a good tomato... I will love this even more after the heirlooms come out next month. I didn't need all the butter for the bread so I brushed it on the ribeye I grilled to go with it. This was delicious. I think adding some toasted pine nuts would be good too.

YUM! But...what are the yellow things in the picture? Yellow tomatoes? They aren't mentioned in the recipe.

I put the recipe in a software program and assuming that it weighs approx. 3 1/2 pounds when complete and 8 servings, it has 292 calories per serving. The olive oil is part of the dressing, 1/3 cup isn't much for the whole salad. I think I might try less butter for the bread, it does seem like a lot for 8 oz bread. But I would have it as a meal not a side dish anyway.

Great easy-to-make salad. Perfect for Summer with grilled chicken. Would not change a thing with this recipe.

Holy moley - all that butter (!) and oil seems really unnecessary. I would like to try this, but intend to use just a few tablespoons of olive oilto sautee the garlic for spreading on the bread, and then use about 4 tablespons of oil for the salad. This could be a really healthy and vegan recipe without all that the excess fat. What do people think? It just seems a little heavy for summer...
