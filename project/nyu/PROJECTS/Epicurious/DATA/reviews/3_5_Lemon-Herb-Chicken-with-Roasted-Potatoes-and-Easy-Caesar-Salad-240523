This meal didn't turn out AT ALL, which is frustrating because I'm 50-something and NOT a novice cook. The chicken got tough waiting on the potatoes. IF I do this again, I'll: (1) start the potatoes BEFORE the chicken, (2) use a smaller skillet (it was more 'pan-friend' than 'sauteed,' and (3) just use store-bought "lite" dressing and CRUNCHY croutons.

I followed the recipe for the chicken but it came out too lemony. It was so tart that it completely overpowered the dish and we could not even taste the herbs. Maybe the lemons I used were too strong and I should have diluted the juice with water.

My family loved this! I used a smidge under 1/3 cup of lemon juice and did add a dollop of butter at the end of cooking. Based on other comments, I cooked the potatoes for 20 minutes covered, uncovered and cooked for 10, then turned off the stove and let it sit. Perfect. Super easy if you have bottled lemon juice and the herbs in your garden, everything is a staple and quick to make on the fly.

The chicken part of this meal is very tasty. Doubled the garlic and used fresh herbs from the garden. Had bone in breasts thawed and wasn't interested in deboning them so cut them in half and cooked a bit longer. The lemon flavor is refreshing without being tart. Added carrots to the potatoes which was very good too. Skipped the caesar.

I didn't have chicken breasts so I used drumsticks. I found that there wasn't much flavor with the chicken and possibly like to try baking the chicken instead.

I found a few oddities with this recipe. If you cook the chicken breasts for this long, they will be overcooked, if you cook them until it's done, the potatoes will be undercooked, UNLESS... they are new potatoes OR you parboil them for 15 min. 40 min in the oven is too much, 20 min uncovered would have been plenty. For the "too lemony" flavor, use only half the lemon juice and add 2-3 tbsp of butter or olive oil. Most as healthy, but much better flavor. I also add a side of steamed broccoli/green beans to up the nutrition.

thought the chicken was very tastey. in addition to potatoes, i "roasted" butternut squash and carrots - which upped this from 3.5 forks to a solid 4.

Tried this recipe as I was looking for a quick and healthy weeknight dinner. The potatoes were the best part, the salad was fairly good, but I was not a fan of the chicken. It was way too "lemony" and not enough other spices - I would increase the amount of garlic if you're going to try the recipe, but better yet, I would find a different chicken recipe.

Wanted a meal with simple flavors and not requiring too much effort. Made just the chicken and potatoes (had to use small white potatoes no red potatoes available) with dry herbs. Turned out well - fresh herbs would be better.

The chicken cooks wonderfully and its texture is great even if you pound them flat, but the lemon "sauce" is far too strong. In fact, you can barely taste the garlic (i even doubled the listed amount on a whim) and forget it if the chicken juice runs into the potatoes on your plate -your spuds turn into lemon flavored mush. Pass on this one, there's far better lemon chicken dishes out there.

This recipe was delicious! My husband and I loved how super moist and flavorful the chicken came out.

I've only made the chicken, so I can't rate the rest of the meal. It turned out fabulous! The lemon and rosemary were a perfect combination. By pan frying it also didn't make the chicken too dry.

I made the chicken only and highly recommend it. Very flavorful, easy dish. The basic lemon-herb mixture is just a versatile, delicious dressing. I made no alterations but was generous with the herbs and would definitely only use fresh herbs.

I am doing a Spring Cleanse/Detox and this recipe was fabulous. I could only have the chicken with the detox.

The lomon was slightly over powering. That asside it was liked very much by the whole family. Next time I'll lighten up on the lemon juice to mybe 2 small lemons (1/4 cup).

Just made the chicken portion for a quick lunch. The lemon juice really brightens the flavors of the herbs.Nice and light tasting.

The potatoes should be cooked a bit longer than suggested but other than that, the recipe was fairly tasty. It's not really anything special.

Do not leave out the anchovies- if the filets seem gross to you, get a tube of anchovy paste and use that. The flavor and saltiness adds something special to the dressing. I added white wine to the sauce for the chicken and thought it was a good easy meal to throw together- nothing outstanding but quick and tasty. I think next time I will bake breasts with the bone in.

I only made the chicken and I was very pleased with the result. I made more of the sauce and I think that it made my chicken very soft. The lemon flavor in the chicken was really good, everyone loved it!

It was good, but the chicken was not spectacular. I've tasted better. It was easy to cook though so it was aight.

I only did the chicken and potatoes as well but I substituted yams and thyme and it turned out really well

I only made the chicken and potatoes. I added a little crushed fresh garlic to the potatoes. This was a delicious, easy recipe that I will definitely make again.

The Caesar salad was my favorite part-so easy and good, though I skipped the croutons. My husband and I both agreed that the chicken would have been better complimented with rice than potatoes, however.

For the salad, I made the following changes and it turned out great: Anchovies = Ewww, so I left them out. I also decided to roast the garlic instead of using raw, and added an extra clove or two, and instead cubed the bread, tossed with olive oil and herbs, and toasted them in the oven and made croutons. I also added 1/4 cup fresh grated parm to the ceasar. It was great! I only had boned chicken breasts, so I marinated them in the ingredients for the sauce, then stuffed fresh basil under the skin before I baked them for 1/2 hr on 350. Easy and my picky husband loved it. The potatos are great just as described.

I cooked the potatoes and the chicken; both turned out really well. I did drizzle a little raspberry vinaigrette on the plate with the chicken, and the slight sweetness really added to it! I also put a little more rosemary in the potatoes than the recipe suggests.

The chicken was very easy and flavorful. I paired with fresh green beans and the roasted potatoes. Perfect for a week night meal and enough sauce for leftovers.

I was very happy with this recipe and would do it again. I changed it up slightly but not much. I baked the chicken instead and it turned out perfect. Best chicken I've ever made, actually. I also cut the fripotatoes like fries and it turned out very tasty. The dressing, I added dijon and a dash of worcesthshire.... AWESOME
