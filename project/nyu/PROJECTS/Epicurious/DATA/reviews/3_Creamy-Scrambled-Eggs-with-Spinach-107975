i grew up eating scrambled eggs and spinach and it tickles me when weekend guests think i've just outdone myself with this for brunch b/c they've never eaten it...as is, this is good, yes, but it needs some onion, salt, pepper, a few grates of nutmeg and a sprinkling of cheese (we like parm) for the ultimate yum ;0)

Super easy. It needs 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper

When I made this the 2nd time last night, I only made 1/2 of the recipe, and this time I solved the blandness issue by adding 1/4 of a red bell pepper (chopped) and a few oz. of quite salty deli rotisserie chicken breast (chopped) to 3-1/2 oz. of spinach. Also sprinkled it with a bit of green canned Parmesan. This time it was delicious!!

I divided this recipe in half to make 2 servings, except that I only used 3-1/2 oz. (by weight) of spinach, and subbed the cream cheese with 2 oz. of 2% cottage cheese. The texture of the eggs, spinach, and cottage cheese turned out nice, but it was awfully bland, and all I could taste was the spinach!!! I am not sure what to do next time-perhaps add some Parmesan? Also, I served this with an English muffin, fresh mango slices, and 2 slices of 65% less fat turkey bacon per person. So maybe this is why the eggs got lost? I would make this again with some additional spices, or something.

really tasty. i keep asking myself why this combination never occurred to me before, duh. then again, i've never, in 30+ years of reading recipes, ever seen a scrambled eggs w/ spinach recipe. double duh. it's got me very intrigued...i could see trying a shortcut version w/ frozen creamed spinach one of these days. sigh. i just adore spinach. and our g'mothers were right, it IS good for us.:-) i did swap out the cheese, as did others.

Very quick and tasty egg recipe. I substituted feta cheese since we had some in the refrigerator and it tasted great.

I used olive oil to sautee the spinach. I added some freshly ground white pepper and substituted goat cheese for the cream cheese. This is a nice, simple evening meal.

I just made a scaled-down version of this for my dinner and I don't see how it could go wrong. Eggs, spinach, cheese...yum! Very simple to make.

I beg to differ with the previous reviewer - I served this dish to three friends for Saturday brunch and they were most complimentary - I have served cream cheese and eggs for years, but the spinach made it extra special.
