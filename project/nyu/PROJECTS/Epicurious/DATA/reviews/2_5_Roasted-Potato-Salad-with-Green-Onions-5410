I have made this salad for several parties, and everyone loved it. I sometimes add the rest of the bib lettuce depending on the size of the head. This is really more of a green salad with potatoes rather than a standard picnic potato salad.

The flavor of this dish wasn't bad, just unremarkable. I made it for friends for a barbeque and it had an out-of-the ordinary look to it. The half head of boston lettuce is what spoiled this for me. I will stick to classic style potato salads in the future. If it made this again, I'd leave out the lettuce for sure.
