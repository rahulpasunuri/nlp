GREAT TASTE FOR NO WORK. This is one of those "whole greater than the sum of its parts" dishes. I have even used sliced chicken andouille saussage ....this dish lends itself to whatever you have to make a quick skillet meal. Great for a quick supper as well. .

My M-I-L taught me to make this 35 years ago with leftover corn tortillas. We fry the torn up corn tortillas, usually a dozen for 4 persons, in about 1/4 cup oil until crisp. Remove to a plate. Add chopped onion and fry until translucent. Add salsa of your choice- red or green (we prefer red and hot). Fry for only a few moments to get rid of the acid. Beat 8 eggs with a small amount of water, and add to the onion/salsa mix. Quickly add the tortillas/chips and stir until cooked. (If you are using tortilla chips, be careful of the salt. They are already, usually, very salty.) We make this several Saturdays a month!!! Enjoy!

Really easy and pretty tasty. Next time, I'd add some cheese and tomatoes. Good avocado would help too.

Anything with chorizo usually attracts my attention. This was very good. Next time, I'll probably add some other veggies though.

Very tasty and simple to prepare. We sprinkled with Monterey Jack pepper cheese just before the eggs were done. Next time may add minced jalapeno or green chilis.

This is a perfect quick & easy meal -- we had it for dinner, but it would be equally good for breakfast, brunch, or whenever!

This make a great breakfast! We served it with avocado and tomato from the garden.
