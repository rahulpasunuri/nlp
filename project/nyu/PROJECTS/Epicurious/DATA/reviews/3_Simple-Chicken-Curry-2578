Great recipe. I made it eve simpler by using a package of Sun Maid Fruit Bits. I make this often. It's a recipe both my husband and I enjoy very much.

Good quick recipe. Made a few additions: 1. added one diced carrot with apples and raisins 2. added some chopped mangoes as the sauce thickened, along with some chopped red peppers 3. served with chopped toasted almonds and mango chutney

Very good and pretty quick. I cut the chicken into large chunks and added some frozen peas as the sauce thickened. Served with basmati rice. Since this is such a simple recipe, I think the success would lie in a good-quality curry powder. I used Sharwood's - an import from Englnad.

when the recipe calls for a can of chicken broth, is that concentrated broth, or regular strenth?

True to it's name, it is a good and simple curry recipe. It is not my favorite, but it is tasty for a weeknight dinner.

Simple! I do it a little differently, using a method I learned from a British friend. Cut bone-in breasts into chunks, brown in oil and butter, add garlic, two chopped onions and two tbsps curry powder, simmer in 2 cups chicken broth for 30mins. Add apples, golden raisins, 1/2c yogurt and whatever else you want to add, such as broccoli, simmer 5 minutes then serve over basmati rice.

Great for a simple quick-fix meal! I love curry so I doubled it. Came out great!

For something that is so quick and has so few ingredients this really has an amazing amount of flavor. I highly recommend.

my 6-year old daughter said this was the best thing she had ever eaten. it was very tasty for such a quick recipe. definitely use chicken broth to maintain a rich flavor, and i strongly recommend doubling the amount of apple (putting half through a food-processor and half chopped), as this makes the dish sweeter. also, basmati rice rather than brown to accompany.

Really simple and tasty recipe. It is great served over brown rice.

A versatile recipe: I replace the apricots with red, orange, and green pepper slices for color and beta carotene, and replace the chicken broth with orange juice (or OJ concentrate). Slivered almonds make a nice garnish, also.

Simple and savory--this chicken has lots of pluck! I'm certainly making it again.

I tried something extra. About 1/2 tsp lemon zest and juice of 1/2 a lemon was added to the rice. Made it very nice. I used the rest of the lemon juice in the curry.

This was a good simple curry, nothing that special, but it is so easy and tasty. As usual, I cut up the chicken breasts, and coated the pieces lightly with flour before browning.

Neither my wife nor I were too impressed with this dish. I tried the modifications suggested but it was really a lousy dish. There are much better curry dishes.

This was pretty good. My family ate it without complaint. It wasn't fantastic or anything, but good. I bet it would be better with brown rice, and I think it could use a little more apple. I used the full amount of curry powder, but used mild curry, and it was just right.

I cut down on the curry powder and the dish was still pretty spicy - good though. Next time I may try the suggestion of adding paprika. I didn't have any apples so I substituted carrots instead. It tasted great. Even my daughter who is a picky eater liked the chicken.

We only used about half of the curry and added about a tablespoon of paprika as well as some honey. It was wonderful and incredibly easy to make. The timing also made cleanup a snap. Definitely adding it to the regular diet. Also one tablespoon less oil made it healthier.

A wonderful dish for a university student with a tight schedule and budget. For those who share my taste for spice, don't shy on the curry and even add a little cayenne and paprika. I highly recommend serving it over coconut rice (the recipe for which can be found on this site).

I added some honey, as suggested but found it to be a tad too sweet with the fruit. I did cut back on the curry amount, cut the chicken into chunks,and added almonds. Excellent recipe overall and can be nicely complemented with couscous.

This was excellent--I will definitely make it again--and I made it as written. Next time, however, I believe I will cut the chicken into smaller pieces and put it into the sauce as it simmers and thickens. I believe another good garnish would be toasted coconut.

excellent and simple - i added sherry and honey as suggested - also used mixed dried fruit rather than just apples and appricots - couldn't be easier

Thanks to the advice of the other cooks, this recipe turned out great the first time I made it! To enhance the sauce, I soaked the dried fruit and apple in about 2 tbsp. of sherry while I prepared the chicken. I also reduced the curry to 1 tbsp and added honey & lemon juice. Slivered almonds at the end were the perfect touch. Very quick and tasty!

I'm no gormet cook, but I made this last night, and it was terrific. I followed others' suggestions and reduced the curry powder and I added some honey as per another suggestion. I also sped up the sauce thickening by adding a little corstarch mixed with water. I didn't have golden rasins, so I used dark and the color and taste were great. I served it with Coconut Rice also found on this site which complemented it perfectly. My boyfriend raved and I loved it. Can't wait to get to the leftovers tonight.

This was delicious. I reduced the curry powder to 2 T and added some slivered almonds for the final few minutes.

I followed the other reviewers suggestions to decrease the curry powder and it was spiced enough.....THANKS!! Just used apples instead of apricots and raisens. This dish was just average, maybe would've been better with the other ingredients.

I gave this recipe four forks for being a quick, healthy, weeknight family dinner. This is not sophisticated fare, but I have been serving it about once a month for a year and the children now request this dinner. Everybody's happy and the cook gets a easy night in the kitchen--now that's worth four forks!

This recipe contains WAY too much curry powder, which is quite bitter in the finished dish. Additionally, the sauce is too simple, too reliant on the curry powder to create a flavor, when real curry should be blending of flavors and spice elements. I will make it again, however, I plan to reduce the curry powder to 1 tbs and add 2 tbs honey and some lemon juice to the sauce to see if it becomes a bit more complex.

I thought it was great! I was looking for something simple and tasty and that's what it was. However, I wasn't ready to serve when it was, so I left the chicken in and turned it down to low.

Great and simple - I only used half the curry suggested (only had one chicken breast). Next time I plan to use one whole apple (Granny Smith) instead of half. I agree with comment about boiling down the sauce - the more the better!

Delicious!! I've found it's best not to let the sauce cook down too much; the more sauce the better!
