So simple, so fast, so delicious. I used sweet Italian pork sausage but otherwise made as written. Great weeknight dinner.

Just finished this delicious dish. Very good. I made it *almost* as written, but used regular, not turkey, sausage because that's what I had on hand. Loved the escarole and the sun dried tomatoes. The onion seemed to be a bit much - next time I will use half of an onion. All in all, it was a flavorful dish and I'll be making this again.

This is a flavorful, quick pasta dish. I've made it several times, first exactly per the recipe, and the following times skipping the step to blanch the escarole, opting instead to add it to the skillet to let it wilt just before tossing with the pasta. I also add a sprinkle of red pepper flakes.

This was a simple delicious dish. I made it with chard and spicy pork sausage, and I carmelized a white onion instead of using a red one to give a sweet contrast. Definitely a keeper!

How lucky to find this recipe...thanks Epi for iphone. I had a head of escarole and some leftover Italian sausage in the fridge,and was looking for something to do with it all. Turns out I had the sun-dried tomatoes that someone had just given me, and of course, there's always some cheese and pasta on hand, and voila everything that I needed to make this delicious, easy and healthy dish. My family enjoyed it, and it's going on our "go-to" list. I'm going to try other vegetables too - maybe Swiss chard would be good.

excellent! I followed recipe as is except for a little less fennel which I find to be a bit overpowering but that's a matter of taste! I used fresh spicy sausage from the butcher.

Simple, easy and exceptional results! Followed the recipe without any adjustments. Will be definitely making this one again. I used fresh pasta and my head of escarole was huge so the proportions of stuff to shells was perfect. We must have really liked it because it looked like only 3 servings to us :) Don't skip the sun dried tomatoes, they add a nice dimension as well as a pop of color to the dish. I used dry ones (not packed in oil) and reconstituted them in hot water while the sauce and pasta were cooking.

Very tasty. I have now made this a few times, using chicken sausage and also using pork sausage. It is my new go-to pasta when I want something easy with good flavors. I prefer escarole for this, but I did use romaine lettuce once with very good results.

Very delicious. Agree with other reviewers that a little more escarole and mayb eless pasta would improve.

Wonderful blend of flavors! Next time I will double everything but the sausage and the pasta, since we are eating low fat.

This really was simple but delicious, although I made a few changes. I used a chicken sun-dried tomato sausage and also used spinach instead of escarole. Good for almost any occasion and worthy of trying!

Made this, very quick and easy, added artichoke hearts too 'cause they were around. Guess in New York City sun-dried tomatoes don't count as actual tomatoes? (see prev reviewer) "3 tablespoons thinly sliced drained oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes"

OK, so I quickly wrote down the ingredients and rushed to the store on the way home from work. No tomatoes listed. Get home to discover I have to "stir in the tomatoes" with the escarole. WTF?? I guess I'll be going to bed hungry since I'm stuck at home with a sleeping two-year-old and my husband is out of town. Thanks, stupid epicurious editors.

This recipe is terrific as-is. I used all listed ingerdients with only one variance.... I was at the end of my jar of tomatoes so I used that oil to cook with instead of plain olive oil. It added an extra dimension of flavor to the pasta. My friends that were over for dinner loved it! I will definetly make this again.

I surprised my husband with how delicious this recipe is. He is the pasta requires a red sauce kind of guy. We both loved this recipe (and found out we love escarole too!)

I didn't have escarole, so I used baby spinach, added after browing sausage. Also, I didn't have fennel, so I added a pinch of nutmeg. Very good!When I tried it again using original ingredients, we didn't care for it. I'll use my modified version.

Fast, filling, delicious, and healthy. I also substituted spinach for the escarole. This recipe is added to my healthy "one-dish dinners" list.

Great dish - filling while not heavy. I used spinach instead of escarole since it was on hand and it turned out perfect.

While my husband would prefer that i did not make this again (he isn't a big fan of anything green and wilted), it was easy and flavorful as well as healthy. I might use a sausage that is a little spicy next time. The recipe says 4 servings but we got 6 good size ones.

Tried this for the first time for a group of girlfriends and got rave reviews. In addition to being reasonably quick to make, it was easy and delicious! I used hot Italian sausage which gave it some zip, and bow tie pasta as that's what was in the cabinet. Next time I would drain the sausage prior to adding the olive oil. I served this with hot crusty bread and a nice red wine.
