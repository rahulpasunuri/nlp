These are one of the best cookies I've ever made. I agree that they don't take as long to cook as the recipe says, but if you do cook them longer, they will just be crunchier. I added Amaretto rather than Almond extract--so good.

Great cookie. These were very easy to make. The dough is sticky, so I wet my hands slighlty to roll the cookies. I also spoon dropped them and they came out looking like macaroons. I found 350 degrees too hot so I baken them at 325 for 20 minutes. I also increased the almond extract to 1/2 T. I will definately make these again.

Not the easiest cookie to make. The were rather gooey and hard to roll. I added more ground almonds and they were better. I would definitely use 12 oz. of almonds which is more than the 2 1/2 cups. They actually tasted better than I thought they would. Next time I think I will add more almond extract to make the flavor more pronounced.

Very good and extremely easy to eat, but not outstanding. Prefer the almond cookie recipes with almond paste that are really chewy in the middle. However, this would be great for someone who was gluten-intolerant.

I thought these were average cookies, I've tasted better.

we cooked for 20 minutes and they were nice and chewy

These were not bad, but the Martha Stewart Cookie Cookbook almond macaroon is much better, so probably won't make these again.

The bake time on this recipe is just too long as noted by many other reviewers - I think the ingredients combination are a great idea, but I can't give this recipe a good rating because of that problem.

I am not an expert baker, but I tried these at 325, at 350, for shorter bake times and exactly as written - too dry!

I thought these were great. I followed the recipe exactly. They are meant to be a crispy cookie, I think but mine also had a slight chewiness to them which is quite appealing. I decorated with almonds on some and cherries on others. The cherry was much prettier.

If you want biscotti-like cookies, follow the recipe but the lower temp and shorter time made for amazingly wonderful cookies. Thanks to all who recommended that. (I love this site!) I put cherries on some, but am not a fan of them, so used dates (about 1/3 per cookie) and cocoa-roasted almonds for the rest: yum! My dough also need to be spooned, not rolled, but that was simple enough. This is a new holiday favorite.

This is a great addition to my annual Christmas cookie roster. I used almonds with the skins on, which turned out great and gave the cookies a more "raw" texture. As others have said, the dough was not conducive to rolling, so I used a spoon to drop, with no problem. I heeded the warnings to lower the temp to 325, but in my convection oven these were not browning up. I raised the temp to 335 and they baked perfectly at 20 minutes. They'd be great with tea or coffee.

My church hosts a cookie and ornament exchange every year. They also have a contest for the best cookie. I made these along with another recipe and submitted them. The Italian Almond cookies came in 2nd. The other cookies I made came in 1st. I would definately make these again. They are fairly simple to make. I had a difficult time finding blanched almonds so I bought the slivered ones. they work just as well

should have read the reviews before making them as we burnt the first batch while preparing our second cookie dough... these really bake in half the time which makes them a quick, easy and delicious cookie that I will make again and again.

These came out really flavorful. I used "overflowing" measurements for the extracts, and added a n overflowing 1/4 teaspoon of anise extract. I baked these at 325, and they came out great - softer in the center and crunchy outside. Also, I didn't blanch the almonds, as I like the color and texture added by the skins.

They weren't very flavorful, but they were just alright. Definitely adjust the oven to a lower tempurature.

I followed advice and reduced the oven temp to 325. I'd say to only bake until the edges are golden, as my cookies turned out quite dry and without much flavor.

These cookies took less time to cook than the recipe says, about 15 min. acording to my oven.

Great recipe. I get constant requests for these cookies. I also find the dough a little more moist than the recipe seems to suggest and have to spoon the dough instead of rolling. Still turns out fabulous.

This recipe was fabulous! I found that the cookies were browning too quickly so I turned the temperature down to 325F which resulted in a softer cookie. If soft is what you're after, you might try that approach. Amaretti cookies are supposed to be very crunchy but taste fantastic either way. These cookies are a welcomed addition to my holiday cookie repertoire and were a great treat for my gluten-free friends.

I also found that the temperature was too high and the time was off. I would suggest trying 325F for 15-18 min. This may leave them a little softer. Mine came out too crisp when I followed the directions. I agree that I will add a bit more almond extract on the next batch.

My son (2 1/2) really like these cookies though I wouldn't say that they will be first on my list to bake. In their favor they are high in protein so you won't get a sugar rush. They remind me a bit of biscotti and would be good cookies to have with coffee. I tried the recipe because I was looking for gluten free cookies to make for a friend with celiac disease. The recipe was fairly easy to follow except that I found the dough was much moister than I expected. I don't know if this is because of a mistake I made, or because of the recipe. My dough was a little bit thicker than thick pancake batter, so rather than roll the cookies into balls, I had to spoon them on the cookie sheet. I also had to reduce the cooking temperature and time, but that could be a problem with my ancient oven. However, the cookies were still yummy and worth making, especially if you like almonds. If I make them again, I might increase the almond extract a tad to enhance that flavor. Also, I might skip putting the almond on top (I only used almonds) because I don't think it added that much in appearance or taste.

This recipe is so easy--and is a great "fat free" recipe. I used preground almond meal from Whole Foods and skipped the cherries.
