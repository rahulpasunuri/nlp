Modified recipe to use chicken breasts. Placed apple, garlic, cilantro (chopped), mint (chopped) in base of roasting pan. Baked for about 18-20 minutes. Served w/ steaming rice which paired well with the jus. Turned out great.

I really expected to like this recipe, but I didn't. I put the curry paste mixture and herbs under the skin of the chicken like several reveiwers recommended, but I thought it tasted pretty terrible (and I do like red curry paste). I did like the jus, but my husband hated it -- he said the vinegar gave it a weird tang.

After all the raves about the jus, I was expecting it to be more than the sum of the ingredients. It was good, but only really the ingredients, and no more. The chicken, on the other hand, was great. I used chopped herbs (cilantro and basil) with the red curry paste, and stuffed it under the skin.

I would agree with the other cooks about putting the paste mixture under the skin. The curry flavor isn't able to get to the meat when left on top. The au jus was incredible. It made everything you put on taste great - we liked it so much we wish we had made more!

Delicious! I followed the suggestion of others and put the curry paste (pureed with the mint, cilantro and 1/4 of the apple) under the skin. I always put the seasonings under the skin because I don't eat the skin. Made the recipe with one 4 1/2 pound chicken and same amount of jus. Served with brown basmati rice cooked with dried fruit, shallot, cardamon, clove and cinnamon stick and plain steamed winter squash. The jus was good on all of it. My family loved it. The only problem was that it made us over eat because it was so tasty.

This is definitely a weekend recipe as it takes a long time, but is worthwhile. I followed the recipe exactly and was surprised the curry flavor didn't come through more in the chicken. Next time I will try putting curry under the skin as other reviewers suggested. My boyfriend said the jus was the yummiest thing he had ever tasted.

This is one of my favorite roast chicken recipes. It's extremely aromatic, and the jus is just to die for (although it does take longer than 20 min to reduce). Like the previous reviewers, I also place some of the curry & herbs under the skin. I also add some powdered jalapeno to the jus for a little kick. Chutney and spiced rice make this dish a favorite in my house.

I've made this several times - with red curry and yellow curry. Using yellow curry paste is definitely better. Also, I crush the garlic into the curry paste along with the mint and cilantro and rub it all under the skin. So good!

I took other reviewers' advice and put the curry paste and cilantro under the skin, as well as some paste on top. I didn't have mint. I increased the garlic. The chickens turned out great and I would definitely make again. My only tip is that it took much longer than 20 minutes for the liquids to boil down to 1 cup so plan accordingly. But the jus was worth it!

Sorry folks, just didn't get this one. Was a very moist, very boring roast chicken. The apple jus, however, was quite nice. Would make it again (with a bit less butter) -- would be great served with pork roast.

I made this as a baked dish with all the ingredients together. I coated the chicken with the Thai Red Curry Garlic paste and surrounded it with the apples, etc. I didn't have any brown sugar, so I substituted 2-3 Tbs of pomegranate syrup and baked the whole thing covered for 1 1/2 hours. It was great over bulghur wheat.

This one of the best chicken recipes I've in a long time. My husband loved it. The flavors were perfect. This is a keeper and will be making it again.

Really, really liked this one. Put herbs and sliced garlic under the skin of the bird as well as in the cavity - flavored it wonderfully. Best crispy skin ever- will definitely make it again.

I enjoyed this dish but think the flavor would be improved if the coriander and mint were tucked under the skin of the chicken rather than just placed in the cavity. The apple jus elevates the dish from a good roast chicken to a great one.

I've made this recipe a number of times and the result has been consistent- outstanding. Everyone I've made the dish for has raved about how good it is. I usually serve it with mashed potatoes and a steamed vegetable, but have gone with rice and that's equally as good. It is time-consuming and a bit messy to prepare but well worth it. The jus is rich yet refreshing and very flavorful. Mmmm, mmmm, Delicious!
