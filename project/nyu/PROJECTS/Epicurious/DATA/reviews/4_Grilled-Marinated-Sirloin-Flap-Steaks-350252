This was tasty but a little sweet. Next time I'll reduce the amount of maple syrup.

This recipe is perfect, was afraid it would be too salty but ended up using a reduced sodium soy sauce and it's not too sweet and not too salty. Like others have said I end up marinading the steak for 8 or so hours in the fridge, I feel as if it helps brine the meat. Everything else left as is this is delicious, for not that great a cut of meat it comes out super tender and moist with hours of marinading.

It was ok for a quick dinner. I agree with the other cook. the marinade didn't penetrate the steak. Next time I will cut the steak in smaller pieces and put them on skews

I didn't have time to go get maple syrup but had all the other ingredients on hand so I used honey and then marinated the steak for about 8 hours. It was fantastic. My kids, who I have to force to eat to steak, wolfed it down once I pried their mouths open and made them try it.

I bought a huge package of flap steak at CostCo and had no idea what to do with it. This recipe was a great intro to using this cut of meat. It wasn't the best marinade that I've ever made, but it gets high marks for being easy and pretty darned good. I didn't bother to use the blender and added more garlic. I marinated the meat for 8 hours and cooked it on a grill pan. Tasted great!

A simple marinade with great flavor. Like another reviewer I wanted to try out Costco's flap steak. I made this recipe twice. The rarer the better. I was confused by the long, narrow shape of the cut and sliced it with the grain the first time and it was tough (doh!). The second time I cut the steak into 8 inch pieces lengthwise then sliced across the grain. It was delicious!

First off, I purchased very good Flap Steak at the Farmer's Market. I'm particular to Flank and Skirt, and this was a bit cheaper (10 per pound vs. 14 for the others) but I didn't notice much different. I was warned it would be tougher, but it wasn't. The marinade was very good. I gave it three forks because I'm not a big fan of soy marinades, but this was delicious.

I have made this recipe any number of times. I found that using good quality soy sauce(not salty Kikkoman),real maple syrup (not the corn syrup maple flavored type) and and aged balsamic vinegar will substantially improve the flavor. I think well worth the up-grade in ingredients.

Marinated 6 hours. Thought the flavor was good but that the meat was a bit tough. Bought flap steak...but it was not marked sirloin flap steak--maybe that's why.

It is the easiest recipe and had a great flavor. I marinated it for most of the day. Found my flap steak at Costco.

This was my first attempt with this marinade and I made it exactly as directed, with one exception. I marinated for one hour. Flap steak cooked for 5 1/2 minutes for med rare. Sliced across the grain. Results outstanding and oh so easy.

Used this marinade with top sirloin. Marinated in fridge for about 4 hours. Let sit at room temperature about 1 hour before grilling. It was delicsious.

I found the ingredients in this marinade tasty but they didn't seem to flavor the steak any. The outside had a nice flavor but the steak was bland. I marinated the steaks for 3 hours.

This was just ok. I used tenderloin instead of flap steak and marinated for several hours. When I put the steaks on the grill, most of the natural juices had been sucked out of the meat. Perhaps a much shorter marinate time would help retain the juices. There are much better marinates available.

Everyone in the family loved this marinated steak. We used flank steak, and served it with Pancetta Green Beans. My wife who is not much of a beef-eater thoroughly enjoyed it. Everyone agreed that this recipe is a keeper, and we should make this again.

I made this for a large crowd ( 14 people) and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. My husband thought the cut of meat was "a bit chewy" but I thought it was fine.

Cooked as an "after holiday" dinner for relatives so I upgraded from flank to ribeye. As I was grilling, it totally dawned on me... I was grilling Korean kalbi. Next time I use this marinade, I'm going to get short rib and blind taste it against real kalbi. Great recipe!

Fab marinade. Easy, very tasty. Everyone enjoyed it. Would make again.

Delicious. Made on a week night with skirt steak and regular pancake syrup (e.g., fake maple). Family loved it. Definitely will add to rotation, as it took only 2 seconds to put together. Also - I did it in the broiler.

Fantastic Recipe. Loved it. We used skirt steak for the meat but might try something different next time. Truly this marinade would work on any steak. Fabulous! My husband gobbled it up.

tasted great, got rave reviews from the boyfriend, who had a second helping. made three servings with a little left over, may add a little more garlic next time though. I'm a big garlic fan and couldn't really taste it. will be making this again for sure!

This was very good. Used flank steak, and marinated a few hours ahead of time because that's when I was prepping everything; it was delicious. Served w/ braised fingerling potato coins and autumn farmer's market salad from Oct. '08 also on this site. It was a delicious dinner.

Great recipe because fast & all ingredients are basics found in any cooks' home. I served with Braised Fingerling Potato Coins

To dyralston, THANKS ! I love Skirt Steak, but do you know where the "Flap Steak" comes from ??

Rating: 4
To answer schapstick's question, flap steak is like flank or skirt steak. It is used to make fajita's and such. This recipe is great and I will definitely use this marinade again.

What in the heck is a "Flap Steak" ???
