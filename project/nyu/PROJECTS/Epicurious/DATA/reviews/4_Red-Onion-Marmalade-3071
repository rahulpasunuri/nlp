Does anyone know how to make these last longer than the 4 days mentioned in the recipe? I would love to gift these for xmas...

I substituted half of the apple cider vinegar with balsamic vinegar and used golden raisins. It was a new favorite for the Christmas goodie bags.

So good! I made this to go with the Seafood Cakes with Cilantro Butter Sauce (instead of the sauce) and it turned out great, nice and tangy with a little sweetness. I can see putting this on everything, I look forward to making more and having it in my fridge at all times!

What a great addition to a charcuterie platter I made from some home smoked meats and other goodies. Great flavor, with just a touch of the red pepper flakes which really makes it!

Loved it! I doubled the red pepper and it was a big hit.

This marmalade is wonderful just as it is written. I have made it several times with many repeat requests. Easy (however a little pungent) and delicious.

I made this for Christmas to serve with Pork Tenderloin.I added 1tsp of a chutney spice(blend of dry mustard/allspice/cardamon/cloves/cinnamon) Everyone loved it! Really complimented the Pork.
