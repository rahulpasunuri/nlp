A bit too salty as is. Next time I'll leave the salt out of the rub as the bacon had enough on its own. I made this with mustard greens. It could have used a little more time cooking, but it wasn't bad. Also there is not enought moisture to properly wilt the greens at that point in the recipie. I splashed some chicken broth into the mix then and all was good. After browning the pork chops one needs to deglase the pan. I happened to be drinking a beer right then and a splash worked just fine. This plates extremely well. The visual is first rate and I didn't have to work at it at all. With some red or rainbow chard in the greens mix it could be totally awesome.

Finished what was on my plate but I wasn't a huge fan and don't think I'll be making it again.

I love this recipe! I have made it more than any other on epicurious. I make it as directed, but cut the mustard just a bit, like others have. I don't really measure but I am very liberal with the seasoning on the pork.

After reading all the rave reviews, I tried this recipe last night. I only had dried marjoram, maybe that was the problem but I found the rub to be underwhelming. As others have noted, 2 tbs is too much mustard, would cut in half. But the sauce did make the dish more flavorful overall.

This was absolutely delicious! I reduced the mustard to 1 Tbl. as previously stated. My husband has requested this to a regular part of our dinner routine, he has never done that!

Loved this recipe. The dijon amount was good for us but I can understand why some people might not like too much. Found it easy to follow and a great break from the regular pork chop routine that I've fallen into.

As someone whose never made pork chops before, I'm impressed. The combination of al spice and marjoram was a little surprising to me. I normally pair marjoram with more pungent spices, but the combination lends a really savory, almost smokey flavor to the meat. The sauteing followed by the roasting kept the meat moist and very tender. I over vinegared the greens, probably masking some of the more delicate flavors, but we finished them off. I may have just found my pork chop recipe.

Okay, the final result was delicious! I used mustard greens & chard right out of the garden, local, thick-cut bacon, and local pork. All fantastic, including the sauce (and I did halve the mustard as suggested by another reviewer). BUT...I used a cast-iron skillet, and what a MESS! Grease splattered everywhere! And when the chops went in the oven, they smoked like CRAZY! Although this was delish, I may not make it again due to the mess/smoke factors. :(

I made this for the first time and thought it was quite good. Next time I will reduce the mustard to 1 Tbs.; 2 2Tbs was too much for my taste. I also like plenty of bacon, I used 6 strips but I was sure to cut off most of the fat. The greens were outstanding!

DEELISH, and very easy. There are 1,000s of Pork Chop recipes here, and too many have the usual apricots or mango salsa. The allspice/marjoram combo is really unique. I used oregano instead of the marjoram; baby bok choy, and baby spinach and baby bitter greens that I picked out of spring mix because that's what I had on hand. I highly recommend including the bok choy since it added a nice crunch. Just toss it in the pan a minute or so after you add the bacon since it takes longer to cook compared to the other greens. Also, careful with the salt. I would suggest eliminating the second salting, since they suggest 3 of them. This would be especially important of you use canned broth, which I never do. Also used 1/2 the bacon to save calories & it was plenty. I served it w/ white rice. Yummy.

Made this tonight, and next time, I'll forget the sauce. The flavors are great without the mustard. Even the spouse (not a kale fan) liked this version. I'd make this again w/o sauce and vinegar.

Doubled the sauce and used ground marjoram, delicious! Boiled up new red potatoes to soak up the sauce

This recipe was very good. I used all chard, pancetta, and added some fresh rosemary in with the marjoram. Very good.

A strong tasting and hearty dish. It makes for a very southern meal when paired with herbed rice.

Wow, this was good! Used 5 1inch pork chops and romaine lettuce for greens as I searched for a recipe late in the day. Was outstanding!!

Restaurant quality delicious. I used a combination of Swiss Chard and fresh baby spinach and followed the recipe exactly. Very tasty complement of flavors.

One of the best meals I've ever made... rave reviews. I made for a dinner party of 8. Used swiss chard. Other than smashing rather than pressing the garlic, I follwed the recipe exactly. Will make over and over.

Loved it with the pork chops--but outstanding with grilled boneless duck breast!! I followed the recipe just as described but grilled the duck breasts instead of pan searing and roasting the pork chops and it it by far my favorite duck recipe! So easy!

I have served this as a special dinner for guests several times; it continues to impress and turn out fabulously well. I use a 50/50 mix of mustard greens and swiss chard. Tasty, unique, and great.

Made this recipe with thinner (1")" supermarket" chops asthat's what I had on hand. Did not make the greens, but definately will next time. In spite of it, it was quick, easy, and very good - a keeper!

This was exceptionally good. I used 'fancy' pork chops from the butcher and it was still an inexpensive meal. It was a bit too salty, but that was probably my fault, as I brined the pork chops while I prepared the greens and the sauce. But the pork was tender and juicy. I used young collards (and had to cook them a bit longer). The vinegar/bacon mix was perfect. I agree, more sauce would be welcome, so that part could be doubled. I served this with quarters of baked sweet potatoes caramelized in a little butter. What a great dinner!--and easy to put together after work.

This was extraordinarly good, and would be great for entertaining. The results are impressive, and won't break the bank. I didn't make the greens, instead served green beans with carmelized shallots (recipe on this website). I was afraid the sauce would be too vinegary, but it was really fantastic.

we love pork with a side of pork. the bacony pork is even better than the choppy pork. more of the bacony pork in the next round. this dish is especially good for our vegetarian friends. jennifer LOVES greens!

the greens were so good. definitely make sure to add the pan drippings to the sauce. the allspice really comes through. we used thyme instead of marjoram. and tripled the bacon. and we could have added even more.

This meal was excellent! We did not have sherry vinegar so I used Marsala wine and white vinegar. I used a bag of precut mixed greens. It really was wonderful.

Everyone loved it! The pork chops came out very tender. I did change it some though. Since I don't like wilted greens, I peeled and sliced some potatoes and but them in the bottom of the baking dish. I put the browned pork chops on top and then made the sauce and poured that over the top of everything and baked it. The sauce was a delicious and different complement to the potatoes, and the pork chops were melt-in-your mouth tender!

Excellent, easy recipe. Served with bacon and fontina polenta (sans fontina) and the whole meal was on the table in about 45 minutes. Used 2" Niman Ranch rib chops, so they took more like 18 minutes in the oven to get to 145F. Berkely Bowl only had skinny rib chops out on display, but they happily cut me two thick ones. I think the key is to get them good and browned in the pan first on all sides, that locks in the moisture so they don't dry up in the hot oven. Of course they set the smoke alarm off, but they were worth it. Sauteed the greens for about 15-20 minutes. Used a bag of "southern greens" from Trader Joe's. The mustard-vinegar sauce was real tangy and was a good compliment with the browned pepper and marjarom crust on the chops.

So Good!! We brined the pork ahead of time which added to the juicy flavor. Did not have allspice, but cinnamon was great sub!

Loved this recipe! I made it with two sides; curried acorn squash with apples and golden raisens and shredded brussel sprouts with pistachios - just be careful not to over cook pork, the times given with a 425 oven is alittle too much considering the pork continues to cook after it comes out of the oven. The leftovers were even more savory because of the terrific sauce.

Delicious! We didn't brown the pork chops or bake them...in the interests of time and less cleanup, we simply grilled the chops after rubbing the spice rub over them. The sauce we made as written, using home-made chicken stock. Absolutely wonderful dish!!

I made this recipe for a 45 peperson dinner at our church. People couldn't believe how tender the pork was and they raved about the flavor.

Really good dish. Just a few comments. I checked temp of my pork chops before they went into oven and they were already at 130, so I left them in oven for about 3 minutes and they were perfect. Like another reviewer said, be sure to put the juices released by the pork chops back into the sauce. I didn't find dish too salty. I put pork and greens on plate and rather than serve sauce on side (according to recipe), I just dizzled over top of greens and pork. Also, used dried marjoram.

Better than I expected! Very flavorful and satisfying. Used fresh chard and some basic pre-bagged greens, and one tablespoon of whole grain mustard for extra kick.

This recipe was simple to prepare and the results were outstanding. However, I whisked the juices of the roasted pork into the sauce before serving. It tempered the sourness of the vinegar and enhanced the flavor greatly. Fantastic dish!

Good flavors; just a bit too salty. I will definitely cook this again, and maybe experiment using different greens and herbs. Donna

Wow! Just made this tonight. My husband will be thanking me for days. This was definitely a "wait til the kids are in bed" kind of dinner, and totally worth the wait. Not too labor intensive and the recipe needs no modification. Ok, one little thing, I used less salt than called for. There was plenty of flavor with the marjoram, bacon, dijon and vinegar. I also neglected to remove the stems from the chard, and liked the crunchy texture they added. I got porterhouse pork chops from my butcher, which seemed to be the perfect thing. I served them with mashed potatos. Will definitely make this one again (and again).

I made this last night because I just happened to have all the ingedients and it was great. It was easy and quick and my family was very pleased. I would make it again, and maybe play with the seasoning a little bit by using some citrus or ginger.

Great pork chops with the mustard sauce. Paired with mushroom rice pilaf.
