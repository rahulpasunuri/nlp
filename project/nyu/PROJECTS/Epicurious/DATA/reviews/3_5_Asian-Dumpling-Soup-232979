The four forks reflects effort-to-outcome ratio. I followed the advice to sauté (or rather, what I did: sweat) some garlic and ginger before adding the ingredients. I'm dieting, and it's cold, and I wanted a very low-calorie, vegetable-rich soup in a hurry--this was it! I didn't use the dumplings (it wasn't serving as a main course); I did throw in some tofu. I will make this again!

We were pleasantly surprised with this soup. We needed something quick and easy and this fit the bill. However, after returning home and rereading the ingredients, we realized that the soup could possibly fall on the bland side. Following others' reviews, we added fresh ginger and garlic, which I sauteed with the mushrooms. The ginger was subtle but evident in the broth and really brought everything to life. Be cautious as to what dumplings you use. We added vegetable dumplings that were not very tasty. I think the filling was mixed with Chinese five spice, which really overwhelmed the delicate broth. I will absolutely make this again but I will try another dumpling instead. I think the addition of shrimp would lovely, by the way. Many possibilities.

This rocked! I made a few adjustments (sauteed scallions and mushrooms, used broccoli slaw and tamari (rather than salt), added ginger and Sriracha) for a quick, I'm-not-feeling-well, I-need-comfort-food soup.

I made this and was disappointed It was a shame even with home made stock. You need to add ginger etc. I didn't, I did the recipe as written. Will do again but will tinker.

You may wish to try the College Inn Thai Coconut Curry Broth instead of chicken stock for more spice and flavor.

Made this with extra broth, garlic, ginger, and home made turkey dumplings I had in the freezer. Easy and it impressed my guests.

Easy, quick, good. I added ginger and garlic and used Trader Joes dumplings. Great week night meal!

Excellent, easy recipe. I sauteed fresh garlic and ginger in thin layer of broth before adding the remainder of the broth and veggies. This added great flavor to the stock. I also used a bag of mixed Asian vegetables (bok choy, cabbage, carrots, water chestnuts) to make it even easier.

This was good but I wouldn't cook the dumplings with the veggies. The veggies took much longer which resulted in overcooked dumplings.

Easy & tasty! I have added cooked shrimp and sugar snap peas, water chestnuts, bok choy, this is a great recipe to improvise. The sesame oil is very important to the authentic taste. Try sesame chile oil for a little spice. Also try putting a small dash of oil in the bottom of each bowl before filling with soup, instead of adding it to the pot.

This was really easy and very good. I made it vegetarian by using veggie stock and veggie potstickers. I did cook the potstickers per the package instructions, then poured the soup over when ready. I added baby corn, but would also consider tofu and some additional veggies to make it a bit more hardy.

Loved it. Added garlic & the broccoli slaw, snow peas. I did cook the pot stickers as directed on the package--including the browning part. I pour the soup over the dumplings. Restaurant fare for sure! And so easy!

Loved the flavor. Unfortunately, I took my eye off the pot and overcooked the dumplings which made them fall apart, so it wasn't very pretty. I'll definitely repeat it better the next time.

This was a perfect easy dinner for a cold night after a long day at work. In the "use what's in the fridge" department, I substituted baby bella mushrooms for shiitake, three cloves of garlic (pressed) for scallions, heart of romaine for Napa cabbage, and minced pickled ginger for the regular ginger some people added. Before adding the mushrooms to the broth, I sauteed them in garlic oil; then, after adding the mushrooms to the broth, I warmed sesame oil in the same pan and browned the potstickers briefly before adding a couple ladles of broth to cook them. I then added everything to the broth, and proceeded per the recipe. The sesame oil at the end is a must, and the soup is wonderful!

Delicious and a pretty presentation. Based on the other reviews, I added sliced garlic, fresh ginger, soy sauce, a bit of chili paste and some diced chicken for my husband. I didn't have fresh mushrooms, so I steeped dried mushrooms in hot water and even used a bit of the mushroom broth for extra flavor. I think the broccoli slaw idea from a previous reviewer sounds like a nice variation -- that's the beauty of this soup, it can easily be adapted to personal tastes. Will definitely make this again!

OK. I did a "Calgary" to this one. I made my own dumplings (only because I couldn't find frozen and the thai-stle dumplings on this website are really easy - don't add the red pepper). I added two stalks of lemongrass to the Swanson's broth, 2 cloves thinly sliced garlic, 2 T thai garlic chili pepper sauce and 1 T oyster sauce. Wonderful. Made the dumplings according to those directions - really easy - fried them for a minute, steamed them (all according to the directions) - put them in the bowl then ladled the soup on top of the dumplings. Served with those wonderful crispy noodles and all went well. Hopefully, my sick husband will believe that all these properties will make hime feel better. My version took a bit of time but was really worth it.

Great soup for a cold evening. Used Trader Joes gyoza, and cooked in broth as other reviewers suggested, but they fell apart. Still a great soup. Will cook dumplings seperately next time. Added garlic and ginger, served with rice.

i made this for my family and we loved it- also used potstickers from trader joes- we had lettuce wraps to start (also from trader joes!!) so that and the soup were definitely filling- i added soy sauce and asian chili garlic sauce (it comes in the clear bottle with the green lid) to the bowl rather than the pot- delish!! comment to calgary- get over yourself!!

Very satisfying supper-- perfect after a stressful day at work when we just don't feel like serious cooking. Like others below, I cooked the dumplings in the broth along with the veggies. I also added a dollop of bottled ginger & used broccoli slaw instead of carrots. The dumplings came from Trader Joes...

Good variation on wonton soup. Made broth as written, but added some fresh ginger and soy sauce, but it still needed a little something. Also used fresh sugar snap peas cut in half intead of frozen peas and shrimp wontons.

Good weeknight (quick!) meal. I used one pot and Trader Joe chicken dumplings and their range-free broth (which won a taste test in the LA Times). Did need a little more flavor so put soy sauce and rice vinegar on the table so everyone could add their own. Next time will add ginger for extra flavor and health benefits!

My family loved this. I used Ling Ling chicken and vegetable dumplings, and broccoli slaw instead of shredded carrots (since the market I was in didn't offer shredded carrots).

Rating: 3
Mine was also kind of bland, even though I added ginger and lemongrass. The chicken broth I bought was flavorless out of the box, so there wasn't much to fix it. I think a better broth (perhaps Swansons?) would be better. I'll make it again as it's healthy, easy, and has endless possibilities for experimentation. Also cooked potstickers in broth and they were great.

This was delicious, but didn't think it was filling enough to make a meal by itself. Also, be sure and taste your cooked dumplings before adding the sesame oil into the broth. My dumplings already tasted of sesame oil, and adding more to the broth would have been overwhelming.

Gosh this was really good. Added the ginger...I think it definitely need it, healthy dash of soy and a little red pepper flakes. The dumplings I first sauteed in some chili oil and olive oil until they had some brown on both sides and then put them right in the soup to cook. Directions on the package said boil and then sautee but doing the opposite had no bearing on their taste and was so easy. It was embarrassing how much the two of us ate.

I just tossed the frozen dumplings in to thaw and heat up. A very flavorful soup that's quick and easy. Would definitely make again.

A comment to Calgary: gourmet doesn't have to mean endless hours in preparation. It is combining unusual and/or interesting ingredients for a unique dish. That said, I thought this was a very good and different soup. I used a mixture of different mushrooms and frozen chopped spinach, undrained. The soup was filling and great on a cold night. I served it with home-made parmesan biscuits. A keeper recipe for sure.

I added thin slices of julienned fresh ginger, lots of garlic, and I substituted fresh spinach for the peas. In another pan I first cooked the potstickers in 2 T. oil , and then steamed them with 1 cup of the broth until tender. I served them on the side, allowing my family to put as many as they wanted into the soup. It was a perfect meal for an autumn night.

ONLY CHANGES WAS ADDED GARLIC TO BROTH, MADE THIS ON OUR FIRST COLD NIGHT OF THE SEASON, THIS WITH A SIDE BOWL OF HOMEMADE FRIED RICE MADE AN EXCELLENT DINNER

This was wonderful - healthy, comforting, and very quick to make. Even my kids ate it up! Thanks to another reviewer for the tip on the Trader Joe's potstickers - that was very convenient, I was also able to get the pre-shredded carrots & fresh shitake there. Next time I will probably add some fresh ginger; I didn't have any this time. I have the same question as someone else, however: couldn't you just cook the potstickers in the broth, rather than doing it separately? Thanks for a great user-friendly recipe - I'll be making this one again!

Surprisingly good weeknight dinner. My family liked it and I am happy for a simple menu for those wildly busy weeknights. I will try boiling the stickers with it but I wonder if it will make it cloudy. Does anyone know?

Hey folks, Wheres the cooking in this? Frozen potstickers, chicken broth already made?? The rest is chopped vegetables. Good recipe, yes. But hardly gourmet cooking.

I made this dish on a spur of the moment, and we loved it! I put the dumplings in with all of the other ingredients instead of cooking before hand, and it turned out great. This a "keeper" as my boyfriend says.

A very good meal with very little effort. Next time I make it I'll slice the shitake mushrooms paper thin; they can be a little rubbery. Don't omit the sesame oil; it really deepens the flavor.

This recipe can't be beat when it comes to quick and easy. Used pork filled pot stickers from Trader Joe's and added a dash of soy sauce to the bowl. Positively restorative.

This soup came out great. My changes: I added two cloves of garlic, chopped and a small piece of ginger to the broth as it boiled. I also subbed baby bellas for shitake (now purists, don't get upset; I just can't seem to make myself like shitakes) I finished with a squeeze of lime juice over the pot. Added a bit of cayenne to the final mix too. This is a great soup to eat all week; just make a few dumplings separately and pour the soup over. Good stuff.

Question: why couldn't you just cook the dumplings in the chicken broth for 3-5 minutes then continue with the recipe? Sounds great, otherwise!
