This was amazing, however I changed it up a bit. I added some Grand Marnier in addition to the Cognac to bring out a little more sweetness. I thickened the sauce at the end as well because I like it that way. I had my daughter and son-in-law over for supper, and all they could say was OMG

I had high hopes for this, based on all the great reviews. It was good, my husband liked it well enough but nothing special and especially not worth 1/2 cup of good cognac. Maybe it's just me, I learned that I just don't care for a sweet cream sauce on a good steak.

I made this for my Valentine's Day dinner. This sauce is AMAZING! Thankfully, I had read previous reviews as it took almost 2 hours for the sauce to reduce down to the amount indicated in the recipe (NOT 20 minutes!) But well worth the extra time! I made the sauce in advance and kept covered in the refrigerator until I took the steaks out of the pan. For the steaks, I heated 5 tablespoons of very coarsely cracked peppercorns with 5 tablespoons of olive oil and sautéed over low heat until fragrant (about 7 minutes). After the pepper/oil mixture cooled, I rubbed the steaks with the mixture, covered with plastic and let stand at room temperature for an hour. Then I seared the steaks in a skillet with a couple of tablespoons of butter until dark brown, about 3 minutes on each side. Next I transferred to a baking rack positioned over a cookie sheet and baked at 450 until desired donenessabout 7-10 minutes for the thickness of my steaks. I served with Caramelized-Shallot Mashed Potatoes. Simply delicious, and I can't wait to make again!

Very delicious flavour, but you need to make the sauce at least an hour before starting the beef, there is no way the sauce can be done in 20 minutes. I had it on for almost an hour and it was runnier than I would have liked.

Rating: 4
Truly a wonderful, decadent, and easy to follow recipe. My copy came from the Bon Appetit cookbook and it didn't include adding chives (it was delicious without!). Like the many reviewers before me have said - it does take much longer than 20 minutes to reduce. Next time, I'll plan accordingly . I can't wait to make this again! Oh - and the cookbook's version suggests pairing it with Yukon smashed potatoes, in addition to the Cabernet Sauvignon.

My wife and I have made this at least once a year (usually in cold winter months) for the past 10+ years. It's simply wonderful and so easy to make. If you're entertaining, it's sure to impress. If it's a quite meal in front of the fire, it's also a winner. I like the sweetness of the sauce and even go heavy on the sugar, but that's a personal choice. Serve along side oven-roasted red potatoes or garlic mashed potatoes to soak up the sauce!

Oh My God! This recipe is so incredibly good! I have made it many, many times in the past ten years and I not only haven't gotten tired of it, I often find myself craving it! I had a friend over a couple years back and as the sauce was finishing, I held out a spoon for him to try...His eyes almost popped outta his head and he said..."Can I get a pint of that to go for later tonight in the bedroom??!"...lol! It does take longer to reduce than they tell you so plan ahead. Wonderful sauce!

Great recipe but the sauce takes much longer to reduce than 20 minutes. I left it on for over an hour and think it could have gone longer. Definitely worth making!

I've made this cognac sauce for beef tenderloin roasts for about 5 different Christmas dinners since 2001 or so. The called-for 20 minutes to "reduce" a total of 2 cups of liquid is completely ridiculous - it ain't gonna happen in that time frame, people! LOL I was quite surprised to read that from Epicurious. I've found the sauce needs to be started before the tenderloin goes into the oven for roasting - about halfway through the "coming to room temperature" time frame. I usually reduce the sauce for upwards of hour at a light bubbling simmer, and then after the heavy cream gets added and whisked in, the saucepan sits on the back of the stove on the absolute lowest heat possible, whisking it occasionally. The cream and sauce continue to concentrate and reduce a bit more. And THEN it's perfect for drizzling over slices of medium-rare beef tenderloin!

This recipe received rave reviews from my friends on New Years Eve when I made it for 9. Throughout the rest of the meal they kept musing on how they wanted to dip everything, including dessert, in it. I would, however, halve the amount of brown sugar as I thought it was a bit sweet. And it was pretty liquidy so I might reduce the amt of liquid a bit. I added some tapioca powder to thicken it up.

Rating: 3
Nice... but between the sugar and heavy cream was way too sweet for my tastes... may make again...but reduce the sugar!

my butcher sells "beef medallions" that come from what he calls the scotch tender in the shoulder area. could have fooled me. just as tender and looks the same for $11 less a pound.my guests loved the "beef tenderloin." i found the sauce to be a bit bland prior to the addition of the meat drippings. i added some arrowroot plus cognac to thicken it up a bit and then added about 1/2 teaspoon of dijon mustard and then added enough enough cracked black pepper to give it a slight au poive flavor. then i added the meat drippings. the recipe just exploded. truly amazing. one could still sense the cognac on the palate along with the shallots facor. the mustard combined with the black pepper to create an exotic quality to the sauce. i doubled the recipe which made enough sauce for at least 6 medallions.

Fabulous sauce! I have made this recipe time and time again. It is always a pleaser.So easy to make ahead and to serve at any dinner party! I do the recipe to the letter and if you allow it to properly reduce you won't find the sause runny. Also don't skimp the cognac is what brings out the flavor in this sauce.

This was fantastic. However, I agree-- the sauce is a bit runny. I thickened a bit with cornstarch at the end. Also, I didn't have cognac on hand and liquor stores were closed, so I used scotch, and it was still perfect.

Easy and flavorful. Used reduced fat butter and substituted fat free half and half for the whipping cream. Suggested adding the half and half last and cook just until heated through so it does not become stringy or clump.

A delightfully elegant suace. I made it as directed, except I substituted beef consume for broth and used home made (virtually no sodium) chicken broth. I also substituded medallions of venison loin for beef. A wonderful combination. The sauce also went perfectly with the wild rice stuffed morel mushrooms I served on the side.

Love the sauce, but it's a little runny for my taste. I sauteed 3 types of mushrooms (chantrele, portobello, oaster) until lightly browned and added them to the sauce and wow, what a difference. The sauce earned rave reviews at my dinner party!

Absolutely the best sauce I have ever had with beef! The first time I made this, I followed the recipe completly. My family said it tasted like a chef from a 5-star restaurant would make. The second time I made it, I used a different type of beef and had to cook it longer in the sauce. The sauce was too rich after doing so. I would not change or add anything to this recipe. Simple and Incredible!

What a lovely, flavorful sauce! The beauty of it is that it is so versatile it can be used with any number of different cuts of meat. I actually prefer the consistency as is. I ended up using a 1.25 lb. top round London Broil and the sauce was a beautiful crowning touch, enjoyed by all. I seasoned the meat well so did not need the additional S&P mentioned at the end of the recipe. I'll certainly make this again! Enjoy! KIMBER

My husband and I both thought this was delicious. The sauce did take a while to reduce, but doing that ahead was the key. After adding it to the pan drippings, it was a great consistency.

This was wonderful! I made the sauce in advance (adding a little cornstarch to thicken), and threw a tenderloin in the oven when we were ready, reheated the sauce and served it on the side- it was easy and tasted great. Would make again!

My sauce reduction only took about 25 minutes, but even when I added the cream it was just too thin for my taste. I considered using arrowroot or beurre manie, but did not want to bother. I liked the taste very much and will make again with a thickening agent next time. Definitely use no-salt broths or your own homemade. Also try straining the shallots before adding the cream; it refines the sauce a bit.

I made it for my son's homecoming dance dinner for a few of my son's friends... they are still talking about how great it was! As another person said already... the sauce took forever to reduce, but making it the day before made it stress free. This is my favorite company meal!

The sauce took almost an hour to reduce to the desired consistency, but it was excellent. It is of the kind my father calls "boot sauce," meaning that even an old boot would be edible under it. I added some extra sugar, and cut down on the salt, as per other reviews. Not fancy or elaborate, but very tasty.

This was very expensive to make-- homemade broth and cognac. If I were ever to make this again-- IF-- I would add mushrooms as was suggested by previous reviewers. Further, I would omit the sugar (it imparted an unpleasant sweetness) and add a fresh herb such as rosemary, thyme or bay leaves. There are much better recipes on this website.

We love this dish. One of our favorite choices for a romantic dinner for two, or a surprisingly easy (and very impressive) company main course.

The first time I made the sauce it was extremely salty. I wouldn't recommend using canned broth. When reducing the sauce, which takes about 40 minutes (not 20 minutes!)it became so salty, I wasn't able to serve it. The second time, I used fine quality, low sodium broth and it was delicious. I also substituted brandy for the cognac.

I got lots of love after I served this to my boyfriend for a romantic night but I thought this tasted a lot like Lipton onion soup mix. Used Corvassier cognac. Would not salt the steaks next time since even though used low sodium broths was just a pinch salty. Sauce was nice and thick after reducing for probably half an hour or more. Added mushrooms. Served with my best Cabernet and crusty French bread, twice baked potatoes and glazed baby carrots. I have my own version of twice baked which are excellent but I used the tip for baking the shells after scooping out (found on Epicurious) and this really makes 'em, makes the shells sort of like a potato skin. (Potatoes were better than the steak!)

I absolutely love this recipe! I've made it a few times now, and I also prefer to let the sauce simmer in the pan while the meat is cooking (5 minutes per side is good). I also added sliced mushrooms to the simmering sauce and served it with blue cheese augratin potatoes, a vegetable and a nice red wine. One of those meals when you think to yourself "Wow, I can't believe that I actually made this!" Enjoy!

The sauce is to die for. We didn't think the meat was quite cooked enough after 5 minutes per side (these tenderloins were almost 2" thick) so we put the sauce and the meat together to cook a little longer. The result was that the sauce got pretty thick and the meat was a perfect med. rare. I suspect I'll try to do this the same way next time in order to have a thicker version of the sauce.

my husband made this recipe and it was wonderful! he slowly simmered the sauce until it was slightly thickened and then, when added to the pan in which the steak was seared, added the juices from the steaks' warming plate. in our home this is called "restaurant food" -- the highest rating we can give to our successes. this recipe could certainly be be prepared with a lesser grade of meat but the cook should be certain to use one that can be seared, warmed and sliced as well as the recommended cut.

Yum! We grilled our 8oz filets over medium heat on the grill. We both enjoyed but agreed the sauce was a bit runny. Next time we will exclude some of the broth and reduce the sauce longer. After dinner we'll coat ourselves with any leftover and have a licky-lick good time! Beeledat homey!
