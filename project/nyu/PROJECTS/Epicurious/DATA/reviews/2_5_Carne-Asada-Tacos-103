I too followed the advice of the reviewer from Huntington Beach. 1.5 lbs flank steak, juice: one lime, one small lemon, and two oranges, 2 cloves crushed and coursly chopped garlic. Add all to a ziplock and force out all the air. Marinate over night in fridge and cook quickly on a very hot grill. Chop and spoon into a fresh corn tortilla, top with pico de gallo, some cilantro, and maybe a bit of soft mexican cheese. Heaven just heaven. I used to go to a mexican place to get my fix, never again. Many many thanks for the suggestion.

I actually followed the advice of the reviewer from HB and it turned out great. Everyone likes it - a nice citrus taste.

I usually have problems with people altering recipes on this site. That being said, here comes my first alterating recipe. I have a friend, form Mexicalli. First thing she told me was all Carne Asada recipes are different. Everything is to taste. It depends on region and family. Her recipe, which we have enjoyed for years, is fresh lemon juice, fresh lime juice, Fresh orange, garlic powder(I know weird), chopped cilantro, chopped green onion, salt (lots of salt)and pepper. Marinate overnight. Grill over hot coals, or whatever, just grill quickly over high heat. Let stand for 10-15 minutes, chop and serve in tortillas with pico de gallo or a smooth red salsa, fresh cilantro, squeeze of citrus, avacado (if you like it) and Mexican cheese. Very light, awesome taste. The citrus breaks down the muscle in the skirt steak. By the way Skirt Steak and Flank Steak, by my understanding, are virutally the same.

i agree with the reveiwer before me (i've made both) - try the ARRACHERA CON AJO Y LIMON A LA PARRILLA, marinate for 24 hours, quick cook on very hot grill. amazing.

This is NOT carne asada! Firstly I make carne asada with skirt steak which is what is used in most mexican rest. Secondly it should be marinated in either lemon, lime, or beer. If not the citrus should be squeezed over the finished product. Also for those of you that say carne asada should be slow cooked - you are wrong! Carne asada is grilled over very hot coals and very quickly at that. You must be confusing this with carnitas or machaca as those are slow cooked. Weather not permitting you can sear the meat in a very hot pan and then put under a very hot broiler. This recipe may be good for some but if you are looking for a REAL carne asada recipe, this is not it. Oh and Mexicans DO NOT use tabasco! However, there is a genuine recipe on this site that is true to how carne asada should be prepared. Cut and paste this title: ARRACHERA CON AJO Y LIMON A LA PARRILLA --- I ASSURE you - the above recipe is right on the money!!! Try it!

Delicious, easy and light. Was a great addition to a taco/burrito buffet. Served with fresh lime wedges to squeeze on top. As far as whether or not it's "true" carne asada, seriously, I don't care. This isn't a contest for authenticity, it's a recipe. If you don't like it, don't make it AND ESPECIALLY DON'T REVIEW IT.

I was born in Mexico. The truth is, there is no concrete definition of what carne asada is. It is simply roasted meat, and there are many variances in the way it is prepared. That being said, this recipe was very good, simple, and light. The spices and flavors mixed well together. Using corn tortillas, this recipe was very reminiscent of central Mexican cuisine. We make it all the time. It's delicious.

I tried this recipe. It is merely ok, but I would have to agree with the "other" cook from Seattle, it is definately NOT what I would consider carne asada, and is by no means authentic other than the fact that it is "carne" and has some cilantro in it. It is fairly light, and would be ok in a pinch, I suppose (if you have no taste buds whatsoever). The idea of cooking anything "authentic" and then seasoning it with TABASCO sauce would have my mother spinning in her grave. :-P Again, I would have to agree with the person that suggested the Arrachera recipe. For me, the Arrachera is a bit closer to what I'm used to eating (being Hispanic), and it tastes much better as well. The fact that it uses olive oil should appeal to anyone who is looking for something "healthy" to prepare.

I get very frustrated when I read the reviews of many of the recipes on this site. In particular, on this one, what is truly "Mexican"?? I have many recipes for "German" potato salad, and they are not all the same. So, let's all get over this ethnic stuff. Try the recipe and then review it. Also, IT WOULD BE NICE IF THE REVIEWERS COULD USE COMPLETE SENTENCES WITH PROPER PUNCUATION!!!

Authentic or not, this was fast, easy and fairly healthy, not to mention tasting good! Served w/ a fresh pico de gallo and pepper jack cheese.

Good basic recipe. That is all that it is. It is not the definitive recipe for carne asada nor does it claim to be. Jeesh - get a life out there people.

I want to thank aidachick from San Diego. After searching several cookbooks and web-sites, finally there exists a recipe that makes great carne asada! And it is simple, too. Add grilled onions (whatever type),grilled poblano chilis, tortillas,cilantro and fresh squeezed lime juice and it's a great taco!

Carne asada tacos this isn't!! The meat should be marinated in citrus to begin with. Tacos should be served with pico de gallo, shredded cabbage, and squeeze lime juice over all. I prefer flour tortillas over corn also.

I am a 10000% mexican; so I know that actually, in most households that is what carne asada stands for, since there is not much time/space to do a grill or light charcoal; however, it is also true that ACTUAL carne asada is made in a charcoal fire. On the othr hand not every one of us uses citrus to marinate meat, though lemon is also used to add to tacos. One hing we DO NOT DO is tabasco sauce as often as you guys believe we do, we use tabasco to polish our brass and copper appliances. sorry to burst your bubble, we prefer 100000 tmes over to actually eat the chiles, raw and fresh in our own salsas. one thing we almost always use is beer to marinate the meat on.

The people rating this recipe are misinformed...1.Carne asada is never slow cooked...that's machaca of carnitas. Carne asada by its name is charbroiled. 2. citrus is one of the most traditional ways of marinating meats of any kind in mexico ...especially beef or chicken. this recipe is nor americanized at all. The Americans are once again prejudicing themselves against a flavor created by the limited ingredients and tougher meats most citizens south of the border have to deal with every day. This is their steak and their flavor..

I agree. This is not authentic carne asada tacos. First the meat is marinated in citrus juices and mexican spices. It is grilled and served in a hot corn tortilla with finely chopped onions, cilatro, and a traditional red salsa. This is the "americanized" variety that does not come close to the true flavor of authentic tacos. Nice try.

I apologize if I'm being a purist, but that's NOT carne asada. If it is, then avocado is low-fat. Carne asada is slow-roasted, incredibly juicy beef or pork, very flavorful and almost melts in your mouth. I say, do it right or don't do it at all.

I am a Virginia transplant to CA and appreciate the recipe and reviews -- is it appropriate to barbecue/grill the meat after marinating?

I didn't make this dish but am submitting my own authentic marinade I grew up with dad marinating the carne asada with fresh garlic, salt, pepper, lots of lemon or lime and a can of beer...for a big party make layers of beef with this marinate it..much better if done overnight, this has always been a hit,even when I lived in Mexico

I would marinade the meat in a mixture of beer, miracle whip, mustard and lemon juice after I have sprinkled seasoning salt on the meat. Yummy!

Tobasco? No. A little lime juice with the above? Yes. Not far off the mark this time...

does anyone have a carne azada maranade that i can use?

Tobasco or the like is all wrong!! Go ahead and make your own salsa from fresh green chile. Additionally, I would recommend you not use a microwave. Heat the tortillas in a clay dish and wrap in a cloth to keep them from sweating. Plastic bags and microwaves are a No No due to this.
