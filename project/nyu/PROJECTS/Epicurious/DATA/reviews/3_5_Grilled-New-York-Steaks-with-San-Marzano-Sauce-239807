Don't think it pairs well with steak. I think this would be better with some grilled squash and other veggies. I ended up using it to top grilled baguette with fresh pesto that I found on this website. Now that was special.

It was very easy to make and surprisingly good....would make again...next time I will try to saute mushrooms and onions then add to sauce.

What a great way to use up all those tomatoes! My husband and I felt like we were back in Italy - very easy and fast to make while the steaks were on the grill!

A friend and I made this recipe for a dinner party. The sauce was easy and tasty. I am going to make the sauce again for vegetarian friends and put it over a filled pasta.
