I made this with store bought crust and it came out great. Our tomatoes were really meaty and drier. I used basil instead of dill, a couple of cloves of garlic, and onions instead of scallions (all things on hand - not artistic differences). My husband and I ate two thirds of it as a side dish at one meal and the rest the next night. A keeper!

This was delicious. No problems with the biscuit crust. My daughter thought it was interesting and described it as a southern dish. I will change the ingredient amounts to suit my palette, but perfect as written.

I rarely am compelled to review recipes but in this case I simply had to rate it; it is a fantastic recipe! The dough is sticky but extremely light. I added the butter into the flour in the food processor then combined the buttermilk by hand. My husband thought there was a bit too much dill so will cut back next time. Will also substitute basil when I have it in the garden, but other than that this recipe can't be beat. My husband is a vegetarian and he and my daughter gave it a huge thumbs up and a million forks!

The recipe "worked" as directed -- I didn't have problems with soggy crust or watery filling. It just didn't taste very good. It was way too salty, and the flavors of the cheese mixture and the mayo mixture overwhelmed the taste of the tomatoes. If this recipe were called "red cheese pie" I would be less disappointed.

I loved this recipe! My husband liked it but it wasn't enough for him for dinner, just a side dish. Will make again!

This recipe is awesome. Here in the low desert, we are harvesting our tomatoes now (May) before it gets too hot. So I used our garden tomatoes, smoked gouda, and white cheddar (what was in the fridge). I also ditched the dill (DH is not a fan) in favor of thyme and chives (what was in the garden). The crust is what makes this really special - it puffs up, and has the texture of a light biscuit. I think the smokiness of the gouda was a nice contrast to the acidity of the tomatoes. Can't wait to make this for company - it is very pretty!

I've loved this recipe since the day it was published -- I bet I've made it 15 times since, and each time was fantastic. I, too, change up the herbs (dill doesn't always trip my trigger), with thyme being a favorite substitution. This is a fun dish to pair with proteins, as many go with it wonderfully -- my husband's favorite is grilled chicken andouille sausages!

I have made this three times now. Each was incredibly tasty! I use a 9" springform pan, which works great for presentation. I also omit the scallions and herbs and use a palm full of Sun of Italy Italian seasoning. The first two times I misread the recipe and combined the mayonnaise mixture with the cheeses. It was messy to prepare, but worked! The third I kept them separate. It is cooling on the counter as I write this. I can't imagine it wil make much difference, but my mouth is watering! This is a keeper as far as I'm concerned!

This is delicious. I did use less buttermilk in the crust, and subbed dried thyme for the dill, but otherwise made as written. What a perfect use of those late season tomatoes!

My wife made this last night. She's amazing with pie's and breads. This recipe was so delicious I'm hand writing it into a recipe booklet where we keep only the most amazing recipes so our grandchildren will have them. Some Bon Apetit recipes are a little iffy but not this one. I honestely thought Gourmet's recipes were better :(

Like others, I really wanted to love this recipe, but in the end I couldn't. The dill was what did me in. It overpowered everything else. Also, it was too heavy. I was hoping for a knock out dish, but it fell flat.

This pie was delicious! I heeded the advice and used less buttermilk in the crust and made it in the food processor -- you can tell when it's coming together as a dough. It is designed to be a thicker crust, like a biscuit, rather than a traditional pie crust. I used less of the mayonnaise mixture than called for, because I don't love mayo. I let it sit for 2 hours before serving. It was a big hit!

I served this as a side dish to a steak dinner. There wasn't a crumb left. I followed the recipe and had no trouble with anything. It was fabulous. Everyone raved about it and my grandchildren aged 3 and 4 asked for seconds. Who can complain about that?

I wanted a great tomato pie recipe because I had to use up some stunning tomatoes from the market, Unfort this was not the recipe. WAY too mayonnaisy and runny. It just wouldn't come together. Really goopy. I was sorry to ruin my beautiful tomatoes with this recipe.

I was nervous that the crust was too sticky, but it came out well. Even the bottom baked. Did cover edge with foil. Next time I may use a little less buttermilk and leave dough in refrigerator longer. A touch runny in middle, but left just an hour. A bit more work than I anticipated, but worth it. Got raves from guest as well as husband, and they seemed sincere.

The mayo layer was runny, but the overall result was fantastic, highlighting the flavor in my CSA tomatoes. I also let the tomatoes drain for over an hour. And I used a thick buttermilk for the crust. In my oven, this dish was done after 20 minutes, and if I'd cooked it for the recommended time, it could have been disastrous. BA seems to regularly suggest longer-than-necessary cooking times.

I can see the promise in this recipe... But not how it is written here. My dough worked well, I knew it would be sticky and made adjustments, yet after baking, it was almost an inch thick in places under the frightening cheese/mayo/dill mixture. I baked the pie a bit longer than recommended, still the vinegar did not cook into the mix and the flavor was awful. I wasted hours in preparation and a good amount of money. I do like the idea of this and will attempt it again, with my own recipe.

This was a flop and a waste of my garden tomatoes. The crust was too thick and overpowering. Not to mention, it was miserable to work with. This recipe did not let my tomatoes shine through. Never again.

First, I would like to thank all who shared their experience making this pie. The tips certainly contributed to my success when preparing this recipe. My guests loved the results. It really was not difficult to make. Yes, the dough is sticky but flour on hands and plastic wrap covers that. I too used a food processor, scraping the dough directly onto floured plastic wrap. Since I had an ambitious menu to prepare, I ran a little late in timing and had to cut the pie while it was still a bit runny. No problem it was still very good.

Rating: 0
I wanted to love this dish, but it just didn't work. Contrary to other reviewers, I actually thought the crust was the best part -- and downright good, almost like a biscuit. I cut the buttermilk down to 3/4 cup and plan to use this crust for other pies in the future. But the pie filling itself is terrible. What a waste! (even one fork is too high a rating).

Rating: 4
For the life of me I do not know what all the fuss is about. This is a wonderful recipe. I did heed the advise of one reviewer and cut back on the buttermilk to 3/4 cup. Chilled the dough for three hours and rolled it out between two pieces of plastic wrap no problem. I used wonderful heirloom tomatoes and aged cheddar from Whole Foods. We loved it. One question how does one bad review get posted eleven times so it throws off the user ratings????

Rating: 1
Sorry I didn't read the reviews first. It was a total waste of time & $$. I had everything assembled and ready to go, followed the recipe verbatim. The crust was a gooey mess, stuck to the plastic wrap - I had more on my hands than the wrap! Ended up tossing it out and starting over using the tips gleaned from other reviews - flouring the plastic wrap, adding more flour, less buttermilk, etc. Again, the dough was a total disaster. Had to toss that batch as well. Ended up going online, finding a video for Southern Tomato Pie that called for a blind- baked crust. Followed that recipe which was very easy and similar in terms of the filling - Success!!!!

This was fantastic. I had great, fresh heirloom tomatoes and good quality cheddar, both of which are probably necessary. Everyone loved it. Flavor was fabulous and although it is hard to get out of the pan looking great, it is so tasty.

Was excited to make this, and it looked lovely, but think the cheese/mayo/dough combo made it way too heavy and negates the freshness/lightness of the tomatoes...and the point of summer. Would not waste my time making this again.

I thought this recipe was quite good, so I'd like to offer some tips to people who may be off-put by the poor reviews. First, consider using a meatier tomato so the pie doesn't become too wet. I used two pounds of cheap plum tomatoes (ah, the joys of living in New Jersey in the summer), cut off both ends, sliced them and drained them on paper towels for the entire hour that the dough was chilling in the fridge. This reduced the moisture considerably. Also, to make the dough easier to handle, I made it in the food processor rather than by hand. To keep it from sticking to the plastic wrap when rolling it out, try dusting the wrap with flour or using a non-stick spray. (Remember, this isn't a typical flaky pie crust and it's supposed to be sticky.) I'm not sure if this made a difference or not, but for what it's worth, I baked the pie on top of a pizza stone rather than just the oven rack, so the crust came out nicely browned on all sides. Finally, I let it cool on a wire rack for a solid two hours before slicing it. I didn't think it was too heavy at all, but that is (of course) my personal opinion. I will definitely make this again while tomatoes are at their peak.

Do not waste your time with this recipe it is horrrible. The mayo layer does not blend well with the other flavors & the crust is too thick for the amount of ingredients. I agree with Austin Texas...practically inedible!

This recipe was delicious, a real hit. The downside was that it was too much effort. The basic biscuit dough was great for the crust, but the crust took up so much room, I hardly had room for the main ingredients. I will make it again, but only when I have some spare time. But it was delicious. I don't understand Clob from Austin. She/he must not like cheese because the flavor is outstanding.

Too much cheese. I think that 1/2 to 3/4 of the proscribed cheese would be PLENTY and then the dish wouldn't be so rich/heavy, either. The cheese overwhelms the tomatoes.

There was a recipe very similar to this in Bon Appetit back in the early '80s but it had basil instead of dill. I obviously made it often because the page in the magazine was torn and greasy. I've long since lost the magazine but will try this updated recipe. If memory serves me correctly, it was delicious.

I love this recipe....so does my husband. Dough is sticky. Just dust hands with flour (same with the plastic wrap). But great way to use heirloom tomatoes...looked and tasted great. Its clearly a rich recipe, so if light is what you want...I would look elsewhere.

Anyone else finding that farmer's market tomatoes go down in quality every year? I have barely had a vaguely decent one all summer, and I live in an apartment, so growing my own is not an option. I'd recommend against this recipe if you can't get excellent tomatoes, which is all of us without a yard, it seems. As far as the crust, I have made a similar tomato corn pie with a similarly wet crust, and found it really hard to deal with that time, despite being a pretty experienced cook and baker. This time I used 3/4c buttermilk as the other reviewer recommended, dusted the plastic wrap sheets with a little flour and it was a snap! Still tasted nice and biscuity--defly not worth the hassle of the extra wetness in my opinion. I altered the filling recipe dramatically, using mexican cheeses and sour cream, so I can't really review that except to say that you need excellent, not just okay, tomatoes.

I made the crust in the food processor and it came together easily. I should note that I used 3/4 c. of buttermilk per the review who has experience with a similar recipe from Gourmet. Even so, the dough was very moist and came out biscuit-like, which might have been evident to others, but wasn't to me. (Just based on the picture, I was expecting more of a pie crust, which in retrospect, this isn't a pie crust recipe.) I also couldn't bear the thought of mixing soybean-laced store-bought mayo in this pie, so I made homemade mayo, which added time to the recipe. I did not receive dill in my farm box this week so used parsley instead, which I did have on hand. Overall, the recipe is good. I probably won't make it again simply because I feel there are better ways to use farm-fresh tomatoes. My husband, however, thought it was worthy of repeating.

This is incredible! I've made it 5x already and it's only been out 3-4 weeks. Dough is wicked sticky.. don't worry about it.. use good cheddar and it won't be greasy as stated in previous review..it's a great meal with lobster and a salad or bbq chicken and corn on the cob- cold sauv. blanc.. we love this pie and summer!

This is one of our absolute favorite summer recipes. My husband loves it! I was in a rush this weekend and used a frozen deep dish pie crust. It worked fine, not soggy at all. Since the crust is not the highlight of this recipe, go easy on yourself and try the ready-made. I also use basil instead of dill. Just a personal preference. I'm making it again tonight at my husband's request.

This is an odd recipe: summer tomatoes combined with a heavy biscuit dough and greasy cheddar cheese in layers slapped together with a mayo mixture; it weighed as hefty as it looked. Although it tasted okay, it wasn't fresh and light as one would suppose a "summer staple" should be. This recipe definitely needs tweaking to make it lighter and fresher tasting for summer.

This recipe is delicious. When I rolled out the crust between the plastic wrap it stuck terribly. I had to throw it away and start over with the crust. Next time, I rolled it out on a well-floured board. The results were very good.

Awesome recipe! Yes, the dough is supposed to be sticky. Coat your hands in a bit of flour to handle it easier, but don't mess with the recipe. I packed the grated cheese when measuring. I also popped the pie in the fridge for half an hour to help it cool faster. Everyone loved it (including three kids under 5)! Definite keeper!!!

I have been making this for years (Laurie Colwin had a very similar recipe in HOme Cooking and there is also one in Gourmet). Both those recipes have almost identical crusts, except that they call for 3/4cup buttermilk, not 1 cup. I tried this version and the crust tasted fine but was impossible to work with. I'll be going back to using 3/4 cup in the future.

This pie is delicious. As noted by the obviously more experienced cooks, the crust is SUPPOSED to be sticky-however, it would have been nice for that to have been noted in the recipe. The dill is perfect-would not put in less. I used Campari tomatoes, which are very flavorful and sweet-perhaps that balanced the dill better.

I bought all the ingredients to make this early in the week, and then read the bad reviews and was worried. In spite of this, I followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased with the result. Yes, the dough is sticky after you blend it, but based on the reviews I was expecting that. I scraped as much off my hands as possible and wrapped it in plastic wrap for the full hour. Rolling it between the sheets of plastic wrap was easy since you're only looking for an 11" circle. I'm an extreme novice at anything pie related and had no problems with it. The pie was very tasty but I had a couple of minor complaints: 1. It does take an awful long time to make, most of which is waiting. 2. It does need to sit at least an hour, (ideally longer) before serving. We waited an hour before serving and it was still quite runny. The next day it was great. 3. I loved the dill flavor but thought there was too much of it. I wanted to taste more of the cheese. Next time I'll probably cut it down to 1 tbsp. 4. My 8 oz block of cheddar was not quite enough cheese. Next time I'll add a little extra. All in all, it was a lovely pie and definitely looked impressive on the table!

This was one of the tastiest recipes ive ever tried. Absolutely delicious!! The flavors work great together and the crust is outstanding. Its easy to make and takes very little actual work time. Most of it is resting time and cutting and coring the tomatoes was probably the most extensive part of the recipe. I can not believe all the bad reviews especially since most of them clearly did not follow the recipe, like the person that said he used totally different herbs and thinks the recipe needs improvements (well you should have followed the recipe) or the people that threw the crust out because it was too wet and used some stock crust. The crust dough does come out extremely wet but some doughs just do and there is a reason for that. If you add more flour or use less buttermilk you will not have the same great result. What people need to learn is how to handle a sticky dough instead of trying to make it less sticky. I am not a novice cook or baker so it does not pose a problem for me and I do understand how someone my be intimidate by it but let me tell you: This recipe is spot on!! Dont change it!!!

My husband and I liked this a lot BUT.... 1)It really does need to sit for an hour--I didn't have an hour and the filling was runny. The next day I reheated leftovers and it was perfect. 2)Too much dill for me. I might sub basil next time. 3) I also added cheese--my 8 oz block did not give the amount of shredded cheese required! 4) I followed the crust directions exactly and initially thought it was too wet (and it was a little hard to pull off the saran wrap). But it turned out perfectly after it was baked; reminded me a little of the Uno's pizza crust, but not as greasy. I'll definitely make it again. My kids even ate it (they picked out the tomatoes).

This was incredible. I did cut the dill back to 1T instead of 2 only because I ran out. The crust came out perfectly and I followed the directions. It's supposed to be sticky, that's why they have you roll it between plastic. I was worried about the bottom being soggy, but it wasn't. It was like a large biscuit. I'll be making this again...maybe with a little bacon thrown in next time.

I agree, the buttermilk amount is too high but I already had the dough made before reading the reviews. I also took into account what was said about the spices. Here's my changes. After chilling the dough, I kneaded another 1/2 cup of flour into the it before rolling it out. It worked perfectly. I used all the dill and added chopped basil from my herb garden. I used more cheese then the recipe called for, most of it being spicy mexican cheese with the sharp chedder. Another change I made was I mixed the cheese with the mayo mixture and layered it with the tomatoes. I used tri colored tomatoes from my local farmers market. It turned out picture perfect and tasted even better! My family loved it and I will definitely make it again.

Really good. Thank you all for the advice on the crust.We took it (cut back on liquid)and still had a sticky time of it but the end result was beautiful. Delicious with Italian herbs as we are not dill fans. Will be a new summer favorite, I'm sure.

Wow, what a disappointment! Not sure where the test kitchen was on this one but I think they were out to lunch and they were not having tomato cheddar pie, at ;east not the recipe as it is printed. Two cups of flour w 1 cup of liquid was a mess. Like the other reviewers, I had to throw it away and make a new crust. Also, used rosemary, basil and thyme because I had them-flavor was good but recipe needs adjusted.

What a big disappointment! The crust recipe made a sloppy mess. I threw it away and was forced to use a refrigerated crust I had on hand which was a poor substitute. However, the sauce was delicious. I suggest trying 1/2 cup of buttermilk to start and see if that makes a better crust.

I'm giving this 3 forks as something is WAAAY off on the crust recipe! This calls for too much buttermilk! I ended up adding almost 3/4 cup more flour just to get the dough the right consistancy. Once I did that is was fine. Also, I did not use dill, as it knew it wouldn't be right with this dish. Instead, I used a combo of fresh basil, thyme and rosemary. I also used a "mexican cheese blend" in place of all cheddar. With those small changes, I'd rate this 4 stars on flavor! I'll be making this again with those changes.

This was a tasty way to use part of my bumper tomato crop, but I think the recipe may have the wrong amount of buttermilk. 1 cup buttermilk to 2 cups flour made a very sticky crust. This is the second recipe in a row that I've made from Bon Appetit that appears to not have been tested or proofread correctly. (Previous called for cooking time of twice what was needed.)

i gave it 3 forks because i do think it had a lot of good qualities - the crust was great and the tomatoes tasted delicious. but i felt like there was too much dill - it's all i could taste. i might try thyme or rosemary next time. also, the mayo layer needed something as well, it tasted out of place in the recipe.
