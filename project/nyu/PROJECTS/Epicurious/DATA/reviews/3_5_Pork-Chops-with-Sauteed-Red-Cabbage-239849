I would heartily recommend making the pork chops as the recipe recommends and skipping everything else. The cabbage and the sauce are a considerable amount of work and I found both to be mediocre. The cabbage was pretty flavorless, and the sauce was just unnecessary. The brined pork chops, however, I will be making again and again. I only brined them about half a day and I still found them to be wonderfully juicy and flavorful.

I only made the cabbage. Granted, I rarely eat red cabbage, so maybe I'm not used to the taste, but I didn't like this at all. I would not make it again.

I have made this numerous times -it's one of my favorite comfort food recipes. This is coming from someone who usually only eats cabbage in coleslaw. It's beautiful, well worth the (easy) day before planning, and great for a dinner party. Serve with mashed potatoes.

Though I have been using this site for years, this is the first review I have ever posted. This was the most successful, delicious recipe I have ever pulled off. My husband even went late to softball to take his time enjoying the meal. After making sure I had the whole allspice, the recipe was quite easy. The pork was perfectly cooked, and the cabbage was super yummy with some extra pepper flakes. Enjoy!

I can't believe how good this recipe is! I halved the recipe for 2, except the cabbage. I had a small head of white cabbage and white onions from the garden. It was very delicious. I am making this again this week for guests and I hope it turns out as good as the last time.

If you're only making the cabbage (like myself) I thought it might be worth pointing out that the cabbage recipe continues beneath the pork chop recipe and finishes with a little butter and red wine vinegar. FYI. Really good -- served it with a milk braised pork loin from Cooks Illustrated and served it with an off-dry Riesling.

These pork chops were delicious. My guests called them "superior" and "the best I've ever had". I'm giving it 3 forks because it was a little too salty as written, and because I also added some extra stuff to the brine: about a 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar, a generous dash of cinnamon, and some freshly ground cumin. I didn't have allspice. I also tailored the sauce to what we had on hand (only used fresh rosemary), and thickened it a tiny bit with flour. The red cabbage was not so impressive next to the very tender and flavorful chops. I served this with a wheat berry salad with sauteed fresh wild mushrooms and vidalia onions, flat leaf parsley and dried cherries. Definitely making the chops again, but with less salt in the brine.

I was excited to try this recipe based on the other reviews. I made it exactly as the recipe said, because most people who rate recipes on this site, change the whole recipe around and then rate their changes. I thought it was just OK. The brine worked wonders for keeping the pork juicy and tender. I liked the recipe, but probably would not make it again.

Found 1/2 a head of red cabbage in the fridge, tried this recipe on a whim (the cabbage only). Didn't have a bay leaf and used some shallot in place of red onion but was still very good- my kid even loved it!

Great flavors, although I would brown the pork longer on the stovetop and then broil it to get that really crispy brown outside. I tried baking according to the recipe and had to finish on the stovetop because it lacked a good color. Also, make sure not to brine longer than overnight -- otherwise it'll be too salty!!

I have to note that I am only rating the cabbage recipe. I made it with broccoli rabe stuffed pork loin. I was sooo pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it. The rest of my guests liked it as well. It was an interesting and vey tasty side dish. I chose it because it was so different and I wasn't disappointed

the pork was very good. Soft and tasty. The sauce was, however, a little salty for my taste. The next time I make this recipe, I'll probably substitute the butter for olive oil. I'd also add spice up more the Cabbage with some peppercorns and sauted onions added to it.

This is outstanding. I, too, reduced the fat slightly and, since I don't like vinegar, I offered it at the table as a complement, which others enjoyed. I just did not expect soomething that is so relatively simple in terms of ingredients and spices to be so tasty. My compliments to the chef!

This dish was excellent! I even reduce the fat from oil and butter in half and still had a great result. I would absolutely make this again.

The pork chops are incredible the cabbage needs a bit more vinegar and butter.

Outstanding! I wouldn't change a thing. The poor results the first reviewer reported could have been due to using table salt rather than kosher, as the recipe states. There is, of course, a big difference.

Deliciou meal! I followed the recipe closely, except only cooked the cabbage for 6 minutes instead of 10 and did not add any salt to the pork or the sauce. The salt from the brine was enough. Served with homemade applesauce and boiled potatoes. Very, very good.

My husband and I loved this dish. The cabbage was outstanding. I would use a low sodium broth b/c the meat was a little on the salty side.

I made this for my husband and he loved it. The only substitution I made was that I used my own stock instead of store-bought broth.

Exceptional recipe. Very simple and delicious. The meat was tender and juicy and the red cabbage was a nice compliment.

Followed instructions exactly. Worst meal I've ever made in my 40 years of cooking. Meat was too salty and had to be thrown out. Red cabbage was tasteless (had to doctor with apples, bacon and honey).
