Very flakey and delicious. Big hit with my fiamily. As a 16 year old guy who bakes maybe once a month, the simplicity of this receipe was a welcome treat. 1 problem though, i suggest adding more water, as when rolling the dough, it tended to crack

This is a really good recipe for pie crust.The only minor problem I had at first, was that you had to make sure the the butter was cut in really,REALLY well prior to rolling out the dough or the dough would be very sticky and glue like. HOWEVER, once I figured out the remedy to this problem all was fine. This is a very buttery and rich tasting crust. I will be using it again. Any cook or pastry maker worth their salt, will love rich tasting pie crust.

Yikes! Why is this recipe still on your website! There IS way to much fat in this recipe - it has to be a typo.

What a mess! I'm a skilled crust maker, and I wanted to try one from Sheila Lukens. It looked like it called for too much shortening, but I figured that might be part of its "character." No, it's just a typo of some sort. The result was a gluey mess. Stay away from this one. :-(
