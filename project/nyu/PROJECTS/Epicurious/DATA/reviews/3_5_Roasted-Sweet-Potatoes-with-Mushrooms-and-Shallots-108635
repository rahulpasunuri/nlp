What a great recipe! I had sweet potatoes and mushrooms on hand, and googled the two ingredients, thinking they were kind of an odd pair and maybe wouldn't have much luck finding a (good!) recipe with both. Surprise! Here was this one! This was so easy and so delish! The balsamic wasn't overpoweringgave a subtle sweetness to the dish that worked perfectly . . . I didn't have the fresh herbs on hand, so I just left them out, but was still fantastichusband LOVED them! Will definitely make this again and again . . .

This is my go-to sweet potato recipe. It is simple yet delicious. I often use whatever I have on hand, even button top mushrooms and sweet onions are fabulous in it.

Make for Thanksgiving this year, and my brother and I were the only ones that liked them. They were really easy, but the roasting time caused a big problem with the turkey (since I only have one oven). I might make them again for a non-holiday meal, but otherwise will try something different.

Delicious & easy. I loved the taste of the roasted shallots. This would even be yummy without the shitake mushrooms. I made this as a turkey day side dish.

I really liked this recipe. The colors were very autumnal and it tasted great. The balsamic flavor with the sweet potatoes was a new taste and I thought outstanding. Even my 6 year old wolfed down a huge plate. I think this is good enough to serve with just some brown rice but is also a perfect accompaniment to a good sausage. Definitely a dinner party, quality recipe for a hearty, winters evening.

Didn't have shallots so I used onions and garlic. Added extra vinegar and a splash more olive oil. Nice glaze, great aroma and quite tasty

this was good and I would make it again as an easy, healthy, every day side dish, but it lacks the extra special something I'm looking for when it comes to serving this for Thanksgiving or and other special occasion.

These were delicious. The balsamic vinegar makes an almost sweet glaze on the vegetables so make sure you use balsamic. Threw some parsnips in there as well and they were excellent too.

Yum! I made this without mushrooms, shallots, bay leaves, or parsley, and used 1 tablespoon ground marjoram instead of fresh, and it was a keeper.

Great dish.... love any roasted vegetable dish. The marjoram is a wonderful flavor, very strong. I used dry for most of the dish as I have a small plant growing and didn't want to use it all up. Used fresh at the end... will make many more times!

This recipe was a total hit at our last family dinner! Everyone went back for seconds. I will definitely make the dish again. I might add more shallots next time, they kind of got lost in the potatoes and mushrooms.

My friend made this for me just before Christmas and I wound up making it for one of my Christmas dishes and just about every meal since. Everyone always loves it and I can't stop making it! (And I am not even a mushroom lover.)

Very savoury, nutritious and delicious. Couldn't find fresh shitake, so used dried and turned out great. Baked mine in a convection microwave and the sweet potatoes started to shrivel, so check during the last fifteen minutes so it doesn't over cook. Nice change for a veggy.

Great recipe for sweet potatoes. I made is less expensive with just onions and crimini mushrooms, and it was still great. Everyone at the dinner party raved. I did't need to roast it a whole hour, though, only 40 min!

Good balsamic vinegar brings out the earthiness of the mushrooms and the sweet potato's flavour. I made this dish one day ahead and reheated for our winter feast.

Excellent recipe. Mom's new favorite.

We made this potato dish for Christmas Eve dinner last night and it was a hit among all eight of our guests. Thankfully, there are leftovers for the post-Christmas grocery scarcity. We'll definitely be making this recipe again!

I just made this for a small dinner party and EVERYONE gobbled it up! I was shocked because the ingredients seemed so healthy...I thought I wasn't going to fool anyone. I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I'm going to add some more ports'- I love them!

We LOVED this recipe. The roasting nicely carmelizes the potatoes and shallots, and made them sweet and crunchy (the mushrooms kind of disappeared in the roasting process). This will become a family favorite in our household.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was the first thing people wanted when they went back for seconds. I am not personally a fan of sweet potatoes, but I will be making this again (non-holiday!)

I made this dish for a dinner party, everyone loved it. Several people asked for the recipe. I tossed the mushrooms and potatoes in the balsamic mixture an hour before cooking and the flavor was great.
