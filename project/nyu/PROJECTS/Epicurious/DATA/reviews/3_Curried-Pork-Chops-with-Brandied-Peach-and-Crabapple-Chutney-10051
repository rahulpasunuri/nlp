The recipe is written somewhat obscurely -- I didn't realize I was making chutney to serve separately -- but that's a minor complaint. This is simple to make, a wonderful mix of ingredients and flavors -- a fine meal. I didn't have the peaches on hand and used only the spiced crabapples I'd canned last summer (and thankful to find a good use for them!) -- am looking forward to making it with the peaches included. NB: I nearly tripled the amount of spices to rub on the pork chops. The called-for amount was not as abundant as we like.
