This took time to make, but it was easy and well worth it. Very flaky and tasty. I filled it with apple pie filling and sprinkled toasted almonds on top. Great!

This is just delicious! For some reason, I always thought puff pastry would be difficult and time consuming to make... instead purchasing Pepperidge Farm's. It does take a while, but it's absolutely simple and well worth the time! The Pepperidge Farm variety is a bit lighter and airier in texture, but the flavor of this one is far superior with the butter. (I think the secret may be in continuing to roll & fold a few more times - obviously adding layers. Will keep working on it...) Also, using a high quality butter will greatly contribute to the flavor! I am so excited to learn this method of grating the frozen butter. It's just brilliant! I can't wait to try it for other pastries.

Perfect results and so little actual time; less than five minutes rolling. I put the grater in the freezer and it took no time to grate in butter. Cut off uneven edges (mere scraps) but cooked to see if necessary and they also puffed up. Have frozen half pastry cut other into squares w caramelised onions, rocket, crumbled blue and drizzled caramelised balsamic on top. They dissapeared in seconds

This recipe was very simple, and very good. I used the puff pastry for empanadas one evening. The homemade version is much better, in my opinion, because it doesn't have the soy or other unnecessary ingredients you find in the store-bought varieties. My husband is allergic to soy, so this worked out very well, indeed.

This is my first time making puff pastry dough, so I don't have much to compare to, but this came out very flaky and definitely puffed up. I also used the grater attachment on the food processor which makes for less handling of the butter. I made it for the French Apple Turnovers from this site and I plan to make more turnovers soon.

Where are my forks? Meant to rate it in my other post. Sorry!

This is a great recipe that I'd definitely do again. I think it'd freeze well also. I planned on making this to top the Guinness stew it's attached to, but skimmed too quickly over the instructions and didn't realize I'd need more time with rolling, folding, and chilling. No big - chilled it overnight and cooked it up the next day. I jumped on the comment by "lzagreus" below and experimented by making croissants; they were good but definitely NOT croissant material (which I figured b/c the croissants I've made have yeast adn take 3 times longer than this...but I had to do it anyway). This comes out like a REALLY good pot pie crust. Mmmmmm.

I didn't know what to expect. The recipe is much easier than you'd expect for puff pastry. I normally buy the frozen kind but this is much less expensive and tastes great. It's not quite as flaky as the store bought (but they use Crisco). Next time I'll make a large batch and freeze it like the store-bought kind. It doesn't take nearly as long as you'd think it would.

If you love your rolling pin, this recipe is for you. If not, shell out the big bucks for quality store-bought puff pastry - in the future I sure will!

Remarkably easy to make, and far better than store-bought puff pastry. You could probably make croissants with it, though I haven't experimented with that yet. I've used this recipe several times and it's always very impressive.

Very nice pastry for meat pies!

I made this for friends, and everyone loved it. I used the tail ends of tenderloin beef, and made the puff pastry, which was far better than the comercial brand, and far easier than I expected. I used the food processor with the largest grater disc, and had the flour in the bowl to toss immediately.

I never saw the link & went out & spent $10 on frozen puff pastry, because it was made with butter. I'd give this a shot, but it does sound like a bother.
