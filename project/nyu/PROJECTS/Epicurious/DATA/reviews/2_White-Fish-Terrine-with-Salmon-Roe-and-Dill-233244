I'm a culinary student and needed to make a terrine for a in class assignment so I choose this one to make. I showed my instructor who has his red seal certificaion and he didn't see any problems with it. But I did have o make one aleration to it, I had to use scallops since we had no white fish at the time. Next time i'll make sure we have some haddock or halibut.

I followed this recipe to the letter---spent almost an hour getting the fish to go through the tamis, weighed it and mixed with cream, used the salmon roe and dill and baked it in the water bath to 120 degrees. It seemed a little loose, so I cooked it 15 minuteslonger. I had 16 guests waiting, I unmolded it, hoping it was going to be okay. It was a mess, fish goop all over the platter. I salvaged it by putting it in small glasses, topping with sauce and calling it fish mousse. But to go to the expense and trouble of making the thing and having it flop! I would never make it again. One of my guests was a chef and when he read the recipe he thought it lacked adequate binding ingredients, like pureed scallops or more egg white, and that 120 degrees was inadequate-it should have been 140, which is the temperature at which egg whites coagulate. At any rate, I am a disappointed customer.
