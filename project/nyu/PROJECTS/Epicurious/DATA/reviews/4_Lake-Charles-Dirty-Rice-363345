This is a great recipe! I made it for my brother who loves Cajun and it was a huge hit. I had some trouble getting everything to stick to the pan the first time I made it, but after turning up the heat on my next shot it was perfect.

This recipe is EXACTLY like the rice I grew up eating in Orange, TX. Lake Charles was just over the Sabine River but luckily the cajun influenced cookin' crossed the river to our supper tables in TX :) Made this for New Years Day Brunch.

Great flavor, even with ground beef alone! Add a pinch of red pepper flakes if you like it spicy.

The dish is very flavorful and the aroma is incredible!!! Adding a half cup of cooked chopped chicken gizzard just to stay true with the cajun cooking spirit... Served as a side dish to Roasted Chicken with Thyme and Mustard Sauce on this website... love it!
