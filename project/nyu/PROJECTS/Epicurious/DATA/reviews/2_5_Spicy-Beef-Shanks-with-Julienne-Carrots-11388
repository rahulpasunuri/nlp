Carrots were a 3 or 4. Would make again as a side dish. I think the beef would be INCREDIBLY bland if made as described in the recipe. Beef shanks do not have as much flavor as lamb shanks. I added wine, thyme and garlic before braising in oven. Then de-greased and reduced sauce. Turned out very good.

I used a dutch oven and sauteed onions and garlic in it then added the worcestershire and some chicken broth to cook with the meat. I also added some sour cream to the carrot mixture in place of the butter.

Despite its "spicy" name, the recipe was actually quite bland, even when the horseradish was added directly to the beef. I found the recipe quite ordinary and not particularly good.

This dish was easy, tasty, very filling, and made good leftovers. I couldn't find beef shanks so I substituted lamb shanks. I served it with creamy grits. One comment -- it's not the meat that is spicy but the carrots since the horseradish is added to the carrots. My husband thought there was too much horseradish and I thought there was not enough. In the future, I might add the horseradish to the meat instead of the carrots.
