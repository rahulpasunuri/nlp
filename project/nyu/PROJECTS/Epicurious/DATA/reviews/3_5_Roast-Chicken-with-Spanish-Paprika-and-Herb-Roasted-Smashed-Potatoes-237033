This was yummy, but quite a lot of effort. I'm not sure I'd make it again.

Excellent!! Made many times. New twist is to grill the butterflied chicken over charcoal for about 1 hr to 1 hr 10 min. Start with skin side up for 20 min., turn to skin side down for 30 min., turn back to skin side up for final 20 min. Wife proclaims it to be the best chicken ever.

The most amazing flavor! The chicken was tender and full of savory flavor all the way through. I can't wait to make it again for guests and family.

An excellent way to have roasted chicken in an hour. I have made this many times and it is a favorite.

I have made his recipe so many times that I have lost count! Easy AND flavorful. I do one thing different, however. I put the potatoes in the baking pan then layer the chicken on top. OMG! The juices and flavor from the chicken are infused into the potatoes..MMMM...

A good easy recipe. I used cut-up chicken quarters. Used the "dry in the refrig" method. Rubbed with equal parts of Emeril's Orginal Essence & smoked paprika. Hmm Good!!!!

So simple, but the flavor is exceptional. Even if you don't do the suggested salad the next day, you won't throught away the leftovers, its that good

I followed the recipe exactly and enjoyed the results. I roast chickens often because i love their crisp skin, so I was quite looking forward to trying this one. Unfortunately, I didn't find the skin to be perfect, probably because I didn't think that paprika brought out it's flavors as well as a simple olive oil and salt rub. The meat of the chicken had great flavor and was delicious!

I've made this a couple of times now and it is delicious. I usually buy chicken breasts and drum sticks with the bone in because it's easier to serve and you can cover more of the chicken with the salt and paprika. I also add cayenne to it because my family loves spice. I usually drizzle a little more olive oil than it calls for over the chicken since I use separate chicken pieces. And at the end I drizzle some of the juice from the chicken over the potatoes as well. We love it!

I love a whole roast chicken and this one was no exception. I think butterflying it made it cook faster so I will definately try that again. Mine exuded a lot of juice with out much fat in it so I tossed half of the juice with the potatoes when I gave them a light smash and served the rest over the chicken. since it isn't the healthiest I only roast 2 or 3 whole chickens a year but if I'm doing it I am definatly going to eat the skin. I love crispy chicken skin. That is the best part.

Nice and simple. Meaty and moist. Be careful to sprinkle the salt/paprika mixture evenly. I didn't, and wound up with a couple of VERY salty pieces of chicken.

I made this 2 nights ago and had it last night also. I usually don't like when people change recipes and then comment on them; however, we don't like chicken breast so I just made thighs and used fingerling potatoes. Everything else was the same.This dish is outstanding and so easy! Yes, the skin was crispy. Next time I'll remove the skin for health's sake. I can't see what good it will do, but I'll try it anyway. Again, this chicken dish is just awsome.

This is a great new way to roast chicken - very moist and flavorful, just as other cooks have said. Regarding the paprika, I found both the hot and sweet in Whole Foods. And just FYI Willaims-Sonoma also had in tn the store - no need to wait for it to be shipped to you if live near either of these.

An excellent way to roast chicken. It was extremely flavorful and very moist. Note that the online recipe does not give instructions to butterfly the chickens. I used an organic chicken and, since I do not eat the skin, put the paprika mixture under the skin to flavor the meat more. I also spinkled the paprika mixture all over the chicken for color. If you do not like the heat, the sweet smoked paprika is fine.

To A cook from farm in Wisconsin: try Penzeys Spices in Brookfield, Madison or online. They have a great Spanish paprika.

Also put a quartered onion and some additional cracked garlic cloves in the cavity before roasting..Since we like a lot of garlic, also sprinkle some granulated garlic chips with the salt, pepper & parika on top

I plan to make this in a few days but wanted to let others know that I found the Pimenton at World Market in the Chicago area. Wonderful smokey aroma.

This is a terrific new way to serve chicken and I definitely will make it again. Couldn't find the hot smoked paprika, so I put just a little cayenne pepper on the chicken. It worked great. I will try the suggestion on garlic cloves in the potatoes next time even though they were great as is. If you have leftovers, make the chicken hominy soup also in the issue and use any drippings to fortify the stock.

Yum Yum! Easy & delicious! Followed the recipe exactly. Will make again - the skin was wonderfully crispy, and the hot/smoky paprika flavor haunting. One small caveat: the magazine says that hot smoked Spanish paprika is called Hot Pimenton de la Vera. I have two different kinds of Pimenton de la Vera, and they are both sweet - dulce. My hot smoked Spanish paprika is called "Pimenton Picante". Just make sure that if you want "hot" it says "hot" or "picante" on the label.

Very tasty chicken and potatoes, and great leftover salad recipe (from magazine). I would make this again as the chicken was flavorful and moist. I could not find Spanish Paprika, but wish I had because it sounds delicious, so I used Hungarian Hot Paprika which was fine. (BTW, I have since found the kind the recipe calls for at Larry's Markets). I did not refrigerate it for more than an hour and the skin was still crispy and flavorful. I had the grocery store butterfly the chicken for me. One change to the potatoes: I added a few garlic cloves which softened and I smashed them in with the red potatoes.
