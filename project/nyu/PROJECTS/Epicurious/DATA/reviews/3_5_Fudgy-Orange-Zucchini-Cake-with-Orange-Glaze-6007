Excellent cake - I add mini chips which helps with moistness and really adds chocolate flavor without changing the texture. I also completely omit the orange - since it is so little it can't be tasted anyway. I make this one a lot.

Was a hit at my place, but a bit dry. The second time around I omitted the orange (couldn't really taste it anyways), added half a cup more shredded zucchini, and instead of walnuts, a cup and a half of chocolate chips. This made it gooey good! I used the exact same batter for cupcakes too, and they rocked with chocolate buttercream icing.

Have been looking for the difinitive chocolate zucchini cake for years and though that this might be it because of the butter and cocoa instead of oil and melted chocolate. WRONG!!! This cake lacked any depth of flavor and the texture was bad. Made exactly as written and used quality cocoa.Did not even finish my first piece. What a waste of ingredients.

I made this for a large group of friends, with kids. The kids did not notice the zucchini despite the cake having so much of it -- strangely, they did not like the orange flavour in the cake. It is really moist and tasty and I will definitely make it again.

Tasty moist, everyone at work really liked it. I made a more 'orange-y frosting' for it. Wished I tasted the orange in the cake more.

This is a real winner; moist and yummy! Everyone raves about it. No one realizes they are getting veggies! I add a handful of chocolate chips to the batter. Freezes well if you want to eat half now and save the rest for another occasion.

the second time i made this, i used tangerine for both zest and juice, and added extra choc. in the form of a cup of chips. i'll never do it any other way again. magnificent, intense, delish.

As someone whose garden is currently overflowing with zucchini, this recipe is superb and easy. We liked the orange glaze with the orange zest although probably had twice as much zest as it called for; zest of 1 large orange

I always make recipe as is the first time, and it is great flavor and moistness. A big hit. Will experiement with whole wheat flour next time.

I made this cake to directions except I used cake flour to keep it moist and lighter. The glaze was a nice touch for a summer cake. There is not much orangey flavor but added a nice hint. I will try this cake again and perhaps use different glazes as well. I used a spring form pan and it made a nice presentation. We will enjoy the leftovers tonight!

I've made this cake five or six times now and it is both easy and delicious. Extremely moist yet not overwhelming...everyone wonders where the zucchini is hiding. I made the following alterations/additions: triple+ the amount of orange zest add ~2tsp cardamom powder(goes well with chocolate) add miniature chocolate chips (regular are too large and sink to the bottom) triple amount of cinnamon use hazelnuts and 1/2 cup more zucchini The glaze is substandard...after playing around, I developed the following topping: make a few cups of a sugar syrup, cook almost to soft ball stage add a couple tablespoons of orange zest, let cool 1/4-1/2 cup orange Grand Marnier or similar add a cup of sour cream and a whipped pint of whipping cream spoon over cooled cake

Made this cake twice and thought that it was just fair. Cook's Illustrated has a much better recipe.

Cake was extremely moist. Liked the hint of orange provided by the addition of zest. Chose not to use the orange glaze based on past reviews but instead substituted a chocolate glaze which worked great.

Rating: 3
Loved it! Nice orange flavor. Took it to a party and everyone liked it. Couldn't believe it had zucchini in it. The glaze is very liquid. I took other writers advice. I add about 1/4 butter, orange extract, orange peal and about 2/3 cup choc (to taste) to make a thicker orange/choc glaze. Good.

Very good cake, but ditto on the glaze, what glaze? it disappeared... Dusted it with confectionary sugar just before serving.

Rating: 4
Loved the cake - it came out beautifully and that was the first time I've made anything in a bundt before (I'm young and bundts have scared me in the past)! It was delicious and a great, yummy way to use zucchini's I'm getting from my neighbor! I did NOT like the glaze and tried to experiment with it to get it thicker but to no avail. I put it on anyway and it just soaked into the cake. Next time I'll try experimenting with a chocolate glaze or find another recipe for the orange glaze (this one was too runny!)

I really liked this cake and it easy to make. I only wished the glaze had a bit more integrity. If I make it again I might experiment with more confectioner' sugar.

I love this cake -- it is so good, and VERY easy! The one person's suggestion for mini-chips is a great one!

Quite yummy and keeps well, assuming it isn't all eaten immediately. I decreased the amount of liquid in the glaze. Next time I might try adding grated orange peel to the glaze to get it "orangier."

Rating: 4
Excellent!!! I've made this cake several times. You would never know there was zucchini in it. The only thing I don't like is the glaze in that it was too runny and I ended up with a pool of glaze on the plate, I now decrease the orange juice and vanilla and make it more of a thicker glaze.

This is a moist, delicious cake. No one believed that this cake had zucchini in it. I will definitely make it again, and it will be a favorite during the summer squash season. I made it for the first time, and have already sent the recipe to two friends.

Rating: 3
It was very good, quite chocolatey. I also had trouble with it sticking, but maybe I didn't let it cool enough. I managed to paste it back together and the glaze helped keep it together. There was the right amount of batter for my bundt pan.

After making several different recipes for zucchini cake this summer including the other "Chocolate Zucchini Cake" from this site I have decided I like this recipe the best, although I usually omit the orange zest and glaze and add mini chocolate chips. It's truly a moist, dense, and fudgey cake. The last time I made this I used grated yellow summer squash instead of zucchini and actually liked the results better.

Rating: 3
This cake was very good and moist (as is always the case when squash is added). I used summer squash instead of zucchini and it truly disappeared. I always use corn syrup in these glazes. When glazes are made with powdered sugar, all one tastes is the powdered sugar. Can easily be turned into muffins: just cook for 30 minutes.

I was able to unload a good portion of our overabundant zucchini crop on this recipe (liked that it used 3 cups). It was pretty good and made a moist, heavy cake. The nuts are essential and I noticed that the orange flavor kind of lessened after a day or so (so I'll add more zest next time). Good with or without glaze

Rating: 4
I thought the recipe sounded a little unusual, but I liked the amount of zucchini it took. It seems like lots of zucchini bread or cake recipes take a mere gesture of zucchini, while this one took three whole cups! It was a breeze to make and I was very pleased with the end result. Took it to work to share with my fellow epicurean and she gave it a thumbs up too. Zucchini, chocolate, and orange are not such a strange combination after all!

Rating: 3
Great use for extra zucchini. Wonderfully fudgy and flavorful. Did NOT like the orange glaze (and the cake would have been good enough without it)--perhaps a chocolate glaze would be better the next time around?

Rating: 3
This was my kind of cake - dense, moist, delicious, and easy to boot. I maybe have a bigger than average bundt pan, but had no overflow problem. I greased and floured the pan carefully and also slid a knife into the grooves after it had cooked and it plopped out fine. Good cake.

Rating: 3
I made this exactly as written, with the exception of the nuts, as I had none in the house. I took it to work, and everyone loved it. My family treated it as a "counter cake", where it sits on the kitchen counter and everyone helps themselves-sort of a cross between cake and zucchini bread, in my opinion. Very easy and good. Only thing, the recipe doesn't specify a size for the bundt pan, and I not only had extra batter, but it overflowed both the pans I used (I filled a small loaf pan as well!). I'll just plan accordingly next time.

Rating: 4
Wonderful moist cake. I did not use the nuts, but added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. I did not like the glaze so I added 1/4 cup softened butter and two more cups of powdered sugar to make it into a frosting. I took it for an office birthday, and everyone liked it.

Rating: 1
This cake tasted like the Alice B Toklas brownies we used to make in college. The orange gave it a garbage-y undertone that was yukky. Besides that the cake overflowed my bundt pan and made a smoky mess in my oven. Leave out the orange, add coconut and choc chips and it might be edible.

Rating: 4
Wonderful fudgy flavor, omitted orange and nuts, since we don't care for a chocolate and orange mix, and some of the children don't care for nuts. Did have a problem after turning it out after 15 minutes, some of the cake stuck to the inside of the bundt pan. I bake with bundt pans often and have never had this problem before. Needless to say the stuff that got stuck inside was gobbled up too. Yummy, great use those large zucchini from your garden.

Outstanding cake, definitely a keeper. Adding a cup of chocolate chips would be fine but I thought it was quite fudge like. Loved the orange taste too

Excellent recipe as is, but I preferred to reduce sugar to 1 1/2 cups.

I made the recipe as is and thought it had a great moist texture, but it wasn't fudgy enough for me. Perhaps adding chocolate chips as others suggested would help. I would only make it again if I was trying to use up zucchini. If you are looking for a chocolate fix there are better recipes.

I tried this recipe tonight. Thought it was very good. Would encourage others to try it. I followed the recipe to a "t". You can tell a recipe will be good by its ingredients it doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure out this is a keeper. I used orange peel instead of zest though.

This is fantastic!!! You can't taste the zucchini at all. I made the used a 1/2 cup butter and a 1/4 cup applesauce and it was fine. I grated the zucchini in my food processor and drained it really well. I think it would be very soggy if the zucchini was not well drained.

This was an excellent cake - I made it for my husband's birthday and it was loved by all. It's very fudgy and moist. As a matter of fact, I'm making it again tonight for an office party.

This cake was so good - so moist and "fudgy" - I wouldn't change a thing!

This is the best zucchini cake ever!!! I did make a lot of changes because my family is anti-orange in baking. I ommited the orange zest and nuts but added 1 cup of chocolate chips. I also used slightly less flour as I was using cake flour. For the glaze : 4 oz bittersweet chocolate+ 1 tbsp butter melted together; then add 6 Tbsp homo milk + 1 Tbsp icing sugar; drizzle while cake is still warm. Yummy!

Truly the best zucchini cake I ever made, instead of using a bunt pan , I used a long bread pan&a small foil pan, just perfect sizes,I will be making it for gift giving.

Delicious! I omitted the nuts (I find they get in the way of the wonderful texture of this cake) and thickened the glaze into an icing (by decreasing orange juice and vanilla) and it was wonderful. Really moist with a nice flavour combination of orange and chocolate.

I omited the chocolate in this recipe, added 1/2 a cup of flour, 1 tsp. nutmeg, 1/2 tsp ginger and 1/4 tsp alspice to the mix. I was expecting a more heavy cake but the orange kept it light. Very good recipe.

fabulous...got raves at the office when I brought it in. Noone could believe it was zucchini. I substituted 1/2 t of orange extract for the same amount of vanilla, just to boost the orange a teeny bit, and I also added some mini chocolate chips.

I was not impressed with this cake. The chocolate flavor was not intense enough for my tastes. I took it on a family vacation for 15 people and after the fifth day with it barely being touched, I had to throw it out because it was moldy. Again, a huge disappointment.

Scrummy cake! I didn't have a bundt-cake pan, so I baked it in two loaf pans (one small, the other large) and it turned out beautifully. Really moist, fluffy (I used ultra-creamy butter: the best!) and chocolatey, without being too rich or heavy. A nice spring snack/dessert. If anyone's wondering, 3 cups of grated zucchini were the result of ca. 3-4 medium zucchini. I can't wait to make this again.

I've made this cake now 4-5 times, just since July when I discovered it...it's always a hit and no one ever guesses the "secret ingredient". it saved me this year with the bumper crop of zuccchini I had (even BIG ones can get shredded here)

This is a great cake, very moist and not too rich. I took Carolyn's advice and added 1/2 cup chocolate chips. A great way of getting vegetables into children. This one will be a regular at our house.

I used a 13X9X2 pan instead of the bundt pan and reduced the heat to 325 for 50 minutes. I also added 1/4 cup chocolate chips that I had left. This is a very dense, moist cake, one that I plan to make again. Delicious!

This cake is a winner, better than any other zucchini cake I've ever made and I've made plenty. It is truly fudgy and my husband loved it. My granddaughter couldn't believe that there was zucchini in it. She wouldn't have eaten it if she would have known in advance. She didn't like the nuts though. But, my husband did. You can't please everybody all of the time. Oh well!

For those with just a few too many zucchini or perhaps some pretty big ones, this is great. This is my second year of gardening and my second year of using this recipe. Tasty and surprising.
