Substitue butter for the olive oil and double the amount. Accordingly you'll need a little more flour for thickening. I also used heavy cream and this recipe turned out heavenly!

I love this recipe! I too used some dry sherry along w/ enoki, portabella, and shitake mushrooms. I also used my Christmas present of an immersion blender! Great recipe!

I agree with the cook who suggested adding sherry. This was a delicious (& expensive!) soup to make, but lacked a layer of flavor. Got it by adding a few splashes of sherry, which didn't compromise the recipe's low-fatness.

I found this soup to be very creamy, even with a substitution of skim milk for 1%. I used a mushroom mix that included crimi, baby bella, and shitake. The dried porcini and its broth adds a great flavor. It was a bit bland, but I may have erred on the side of too little salt and pepper. I will try this again.

Just ordinary as written. But give an immersion blender a brief spin at the end, and the soup becomes magically rich and "creamy". (This also reduces the amount of chopping required upfront.)

I originally found this recipe back in 2002 when it was part of Bon Appetit's best recipes of the year issue. I loved it then and it is still wonderful! I made it exactly as written but next time will change a few things: add the garlic right after the onion so it can cook more and not be so sharp; salt the mushrooms halfway through cooking so you don't have to add as much salt at the end; and make a light roux of flour and butter to thicken the soup (it wasn't nearly thick enough). A healthy and tasty recipe!

Excellent soup! I only had the button mushrooms, but it was fabulous just the same. The thyme adds a real deep flavor to the soup. I've made this soup many times and it's always a hit!

Just made this as a test for xt-mas dinner. I could not find dried porcini mushrooms, I used crimini. Follwed recipe exactly except for this substitution. Found the soup too chunky for my tate so pureed all the soup after trying a bowl. Taste was very good. For xt-mas I will sautee a couple of mushrooms & reseve for garnish with thyme sprig.

This is a versatile and basic recipe. I made it with 50% more mushrooms than described and it becomes more of a delectable mushroom stew in consistency. I made it with Crimini, Shiitake and Enkoki, a total of 23 ounces. I did increase fluid by a cup by inspection as the lot was thickening. I also have switched some of the onions for scallions; leeks would do as would different and milder onions. An excellent soup for base or the main event!

Wow! I bought too many mushrooms for a different recipe, and I decided to use this soup as a base so I could use them up. A few modifications I made: I only used portabella, crimini, and white mushrooms (didn't have any porcini). Instead of the porcini liquid, I just used vegetable broth. I reduced the flour to 3 tbsp., and didn't puree anything, but I did add 1 cup of cooked wild rice. It was a little bland at first so I added salt and fresh black pepper to taste. It was so good!

This is one of my favorite fall soups. Surprisingly rick and creamy given that it uses 1% milk.

I thought this soup was wonderful, although I changed the following things: I added a TBS of butter while sauteeing the mushrooms along with a pinch of salt. I also poured a bit of sherry in the pan once the mushrooms had cooked for a few minutes. I also added a bit more fresh thyme and I used heavy cream instead of low-fat milk. I loved this soup---thought it was tasty with the changes I added. A bit of French bread and a nice watercress salad made for a nice Saturday night meal at home...

I would make this again just because I love mushrooms and it's pretty low in fat and calories but I thought there was too much flour. I cooked the roux to a golden brown but still it tasted like flour to me.

This was O.K. I thought it was a little bland. I used Trader Joes wild mushroom medly additional button mushrooms and dried porcini mushrooms. Maybe it was the Trader Joes shroooms.

Fantastic soup ! A huge hit at Christmas Eve dinner. I let the soup lightly boil for about 45 minutes to further reduce it. I also added 3-4 drops of truffle oil and it really added flavor! Will definitely make it again.

Excellent recipe. My husband loves it. He had seconds!! Goes great with crunchy bread. A dollop of creme fraiche on top gives it that extra umph.

Great soup. Comparible to Panera's forest mushroom soup, if you've had it.

The soup was very good. I added some pepper flakes for extra taste, a bit more thyme and used homemade chicken stock. It was great and I would definitely make this again!

Good soup. Tasty. I used "Wild Bunch" (shiitake, oyster, baby bella) from the grocery for the mushrooms. Next time will be choosier on the mushrooms to give it more flavor. Perhaps crimini instead of button. I would also suggest more garlic as I like a lot of it!

this recipe is a good basis for the soup, but too bland. it benefits hugely from a white wine reduction to begin with, and by adding fresh thyme and creme fraiche at the end.

This is a very flavorful mushroom soup. I substituted frozen "mushroom medley" from Trader Joes -- for the wild mushrooms. This made it very easy, with less chopping. An easy, great soup to make for company-- next time I will double the recipe -- it went too quick this time!!

Be careful not to use too much garlic as you can overwhelm the taste of the mushrooms.

If I could have given this recipe negative forks, I would have. There are many other mushroom soup recipes that are far better. This one is definitely NOT making into the recipe box!!

Best soup I've had. My wife and I loved it!

This was nice. I puree'd the whole thing and then fried some sliced button mushrooms until crispy to float on top.

My husband and I really enjoyed this soup. It has a great flavor and I look forward to making this again.
