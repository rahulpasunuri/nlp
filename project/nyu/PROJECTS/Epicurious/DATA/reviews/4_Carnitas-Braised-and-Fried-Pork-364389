Wonderful! So easy to make. My hubby said it reminded him of delicious meat you'd buy from a street vendor. I only had 2 lbs of pork, so I halved the amount of salt but used the full amount of all the other ingredients. Also, I didn't have any condensed milk, so I just added a dash of sugar. After taking the pork out of the pan, to make cleanup easier I deglazed the pan with a splash of wine and all the dried on stuff came off easily.

Ridiculously delicious and simple!!! Made the recipe exactly as directed, and it turned out perfectly. We've gone through a handful of Carnitas recipes, but this is the only one we'll need moving forward. The only "con" I offer is that your dutch oven will likely never look the same. LOTS of crusty goodness stuck to the bottom. Make sure you have some Bar Keeper's on hand before you cook this! ;)

A winner for taste and ease of preparation! My husband, who used to live in Spain, said these were the best carnitas he has ever eaten. My teenaged daughter loved them, too. I followed the recipe exactly. The liquid evaporated during two hours of cooking, leaving the meat with just a little fat. Although the meat tasted delicious at this point, it was twice as yummy after the time in the oven. Don't skip this step! Next time I think I'll use an entire orange cut into four pieces, but that is the only change I'd make.

Holy cow!!! This was the best carnitas recipe I've ever made The combination of the garlic, onion and orange really was a winner. I didn't have any sweetened, condensed milk on-hand and I can't say it was missed. I started in the crock pot and finished in the oven -- definitely wound up with more liquid than I needed, but I did get nice "crust" on top.

This is incredibly tasty and the best part is how easy it is to make. Just throw everything in the pot and crisp at the end. Yum!

This is a great recipe but for me the oven browning doesn't work well. Instead, I boil the meat slowly until the most liquid is gone but the meat is still wet. Then I heat up a large saute pan and crisp the meat up on high/medium heat. No need for oil if you used a fatty piece of pork to begin with. I do the crisping in batches, otherwise doesn't work as well. Also, I use an entire orange and a tiny bit more sweetened condensed milk.

Great recipe. The flavors in this pork recipe were divine--the WHOLE orange is where the best flavor came from. I slow cooked in a crock pot and served as a burrito filler with lemon/cilantro rice, pinto beans, fresh garden tomato pico and monterey cheese. I used a loin as this is what I had on hand. A 2 lb loin served 6 people burrito style--everyone loved the carnitas--this recipe is going into the vault!

Great recipe!!! Absolutely delicious and the best carnitas I've eaten! I followed it pretty closely and found it easy. Only substitution was used oil instead of lard. One caution-I had removed meat to a bowl before putting it into oven and left daughter to stir while taking dog out-final bit of evaporating liquid/fat burned (despite "constant stirring"). Walked into the house to smell burning and after losing my mind for a moment decided remaining stuff in bottom of pot was unsalvagable/burned smelling. Threw that out, drizzled canola oil in a 9x13, added meat & baked in oven. Still turned out fabulous! Served with Mexican rice with cilantro dressing, black beans, pickled red onions & guacamole taquero...all from this site. Everyone loved everything!

Simply THE best carnitas recipe I've ever tried. It's amazingly easy and very tasty. Great for a quick week night or weekend dish!

Good base, but I had a few issues. I made half the amount as directed, and the orange flavor was way too prevalent. Also, my water was gone after an hour so some of the pork burnt a bit (I'd left the pot uncovered, since it doesn't say, next time, I'd do it covered for most of the time.) Next time, I'd also shred before baking it, and maybe broil or fry it. If baking, need to turn it.

I made this for Cinco de Mayo yesterday and everyone liked it. I gave it only 3 forks because I have made a different carnitas recipe that we all like better than this one. I followed the recipe exactly, until it came to the oven browning. At that point, due to being disappointed with the flavor, I added some cinnamon and cumin to the concentrated fat before pouring it over the shredded pork and putting it into the oven to crisp up. I can't say this recipe was bad, but I think I'll stick to my preous carnitas recipe from now on.

I made this last night for Cinco de Mayo and it was a huge hit. Everyone loved it. Due to what was on hand I used vegetable oil, Mediterranean oregano and fine sea salt. Cilantro, lime and Mexican creme for garnish. Delicious!

Just made it for dinner this evening. It was delicious but I was disappointed that the liquid did not boil away. I think my dutch oven has a very tight seal. I had to move the meat to a roasting pan to go in the oven. Otherwise, it was delicious. I think I will cook it uncovered for the last bit on the stove-top before putting it in the over.

I can't believe how easy and delicious this is! I used boneless pork shoulder from Costco. Luckily, I have enough for a second batch because this didn't survive to leftovers. I used milk and a bit of honey instead of the sweetened condensed milk and a tangelo instead of an orange because that is what I had. It was delicious. We ate with rice and roasted green beans. I'm not a fan of frying, so I thought the oven roasting achieved a good level of crispy, brownness without the big mess. I don't have other cooking experience to compare to, but I thought it tasted better than a lot of bland restaurant carnitas I've had in the past.

This is absolutely delicious and so easy. I followed recipe exactly - even roasting at the end using a large roasting pan so the meat was in a single layer). I wouldn't skip this step - it made the pork even tastier!! I served with sauteed onions just like our favorite Mexican restaurant!!

Rating: 4
Unbelievably tasty, and very easy to make. I had no problems with the directions - the liquid had evaporated by the team the meat was tender. I made a whole batch for 4 people, expecting leftovers, but we had very little left! It was so good, it was hard to stop eating. Will be making again soon for company.

I skipped the oven portion of the recipe and quickly fried the pulled pork in a couple tablespoons of Manteca. Seasoned with s&p, onion, garlic and a bit of Mexican oregano. We used this for taquitos and it was AMAzing. Served with guac. Delicious!

Amazing flavor and so simple to make and better than carnitas in the many Mexican restaurants in my area. I too was confused by the part of the directions that said to remove the meat if all the liquid had not evaporated and let the liquid continue to bubble. I think the end of the sentence should say "until the water or excess liquid has evaporated and only the fat remains." As another person noted, there will be fat remaining in the pot, and you want the meat to be coated with the fat for the oven browning. I served this with a Mexican rice recipe I found on epicurious and black beans. Delicious - can't wait to make it for company.

To die for! We doubled the recipe using an 8 lb pork shoulder. Removed the pork and spices from the liquid after about 5 hours of simmering. Simmered the liquid another hour then removed most of the fat, leaving about 3 cups of the flavorful broth. The end result was unbelievable. Crispy and delicious! Everyone raved and raved. Already planning to make it again. Soon!

Just made this for day after Christmas dinner. Amazingly delicious! After browning, I shredded it into nice size chunks-perfect for taco building.

Very easy and yummy. Quick tip: I found the evaporated milk in a squeeze jar - new thing! And it made the 1T not wasteful feeling.

This recipe was a great guideline. I bought a bone in shoulder with skin, removed the skin, but kept the piece of meat intact. Didn't have condensed milk so improvised with a spoonful of vanilla gelato-- it was great! Since the meat was whole, I turned it every 20 minutes for 2 hours on the stove, and left the lid on for the first hour. Put it in the oven for 45 minutes, uncovered. It truly was delicious!! Next time, I think I would add a bit more liquid before putting the meat in the oven, as after 45 minutes it was pretty thick and not really juice anymore.

OMG this is so RIDICULOUSLY amazing...better than 90% of the carnitas I've eaten in restaurants. Secret ingredient: the orange. Follow directions exactly and be prepared to be blown away. It is super rich and easy to overindulge; I will invite friends over next time to share!

So good. So, so good. I can't justify opening a can of sweetened condensed for just a bit of it, so I use a little milk and honey. I also skip the additional oil because I use a very fatty hunk of pork. Crisping in the oven is key; I end up overdoing that step a bit at the request of my husband. I always make the pineapple salsa. The green salsa that accompanies this is good, but I will shortcut and blend an avocado and bottled salsa verde with some extra cilantro and lime. Extra red onion, cilantro, jalapeno and whatever else I have on hand go out as well. I could eat this once a week if I didn't care about fitting my clothes.

Delicious. Followed the recipe exactly, except I chopped up the meat after browning to make taco-stuffing easier. Served with raw onion salsa, pineapple salsa, guacamole, and sliced radishes.

To mrsbdboden: the reason why you want to evaporate the liquid without the pork is 1) to not overcook the pork. You remove it if it's fork-tender. 2) if you do need to remove the pork, the liquid begins caramelizing, so it's not like it dries out the liquid completely. It turns really bubbly and when you put the pork back in and brown it in the oven, the pork kind of crisps up around the edges. It might not make perfect sense until you try it. I hope you do!

The directions on this recipe make no sense at all. Why would you remove the pork and boil away any remaining liquid in the pan? I can see removing the lid and slow boiling the ingredients until the liquid is absorbed.

Amazing! I've been looking for the perfect carnitas recipe for several years. I've tried them all, using all different types of techniques, but this one is it! I did use buttermilk instead of the condensed milk, but left everything else pretty much the same. It's tempting to skip the browning step since they taste really good after the simmering, but don't skip it! I'm originally from Mexico, and think that this is a very good rendition of carnitas. I'm not sure why one of the posters thought it tasted like mole, becasue mole has completely different spices and chocolate in it, and I didn't taste a resemblance at all. All in all, I will make this over and over again. Serve with pickled onions, avocado, cotija, tortillas and lime, and you've got a great taco party.

I first made this recipe for Cinco de Mayo. It was not only easy to make, but my study group & family RAVED about how delicious they were! 'Addicting' was a frequently coined term! I doubled it & followed it, but didn't measure everything exactly. Still....amazing results. Do not pass this one up!

Good gravy, this was excellent. It didn't taste like traditional carnitas but whatever it was, it was amazing. I followed the recipe exactly but made one change: I didn't add the lard/oil. The meat is fatty enough. When finished braising it has plenty of fat left to crisp up in the oven. DON'T SKIP THAT STEP! The crispy bits are the best part. This recipe is a keeper.

This was delicious. Everyone loved it. I braised mine for 2hrs longer because I felt like it, though it wasn't necessary. Neither was the extra lard/oil. The pork has enough fat to be delicious and then some. I cannot stress how delicious this was enough.

I used a 10 lb pork shoulder and recalculated the recipe for the additional servings. Everyone at our party loved it and asked for the recipe!

This recipe is really good but it is in no way your traditional carnitas. It is actually unbelievably similar to a mole.

Perfect!! Pork came out so soft, that I almost didn't want to put it in the oven (I used back ribs). I left out the oregano since it's not my favorite, but added some cumin. Ate on corn tortillas with lime, roasted pineapple and white onion. Everyone was spooning the remaining liquid into their tortillas. My kids are begging for more.

Don't skip the broiling part - it's what makes the carnitas crispy and delicious. This recipe was easy and low-maintenance. I used a little milk and some honey (1-2 Tbsp) in lieu of condensed. Served with optional sliced radishes, the Guacamole Taquero, fresh chopped white onion and tomatoes, and jack cheese. Roasted pineapple would have been delicious, too.

RAVE reviews for this: made for a party of 8, with some alterations since I took them for a hungry bunch. Bought an 8 pound pork shoulder and stripped it, used an entire peeled orange split into quarters (deliciously disintegrated), smashed the garlic cloves to release their oils, used a quick swish of canola oil, and a small bit of butter milk instead of condensed (if you have neither, normal milk or nothing would work too). The oregano is key, as is the onion. More is better than less. Remember, you're cooking, measurements aren't everything! I used around 4 cups of water, and boiled it until the pork still has some liquid around it. Turn it off, let it sit a bit, and shred the pork with 2 forks into the juices (skipped the whole messy broiling part). Serve on warm corn tortillas with lime wedges, diced onions and cilantro. Tacos carnitas, a la taco truck. Wrapped in foil and served with some grilled corn, this one be one picnic fantastico! Bon appetit! :D :D :D

I followed the recipe exactly, well almost, and it turned out really well. No matter how tempted you are, don't add any more than the 1 tablespoon condensed milk. I covered for the first 30 minutes but should have cooked uncovered for the entire 90 minutes.

very good. Didn't have lard so I threw in some bacon. Didn't have orange, so I used lemon. It needs a little acid to make the meat "fork tender" and so use a splash of vinaigre, too.
