I was not impressed with this cake. It was very crumbly in texture, probably because it needs more egg. It also had a very strong molasses flavor, when I would have preferred more ginger flavor. The only redeeming part of it was serving it with a lemon zest glaze that cut the molasses flavor a bit. Definitely won't make it again.

Really enjoyed this gingerbread. Made mini bundt cakes and they turned out quite well. I also used unsalted butter in place of the shortning and was generous with the spices. No signs of being dry. If using this recipe as cupcakes or muffins, watch the time!! They bake quickly.

Not too bad, I did change 1/2 cup of a- p flour to cake flour, used real ginger and used butter rather than shortening and it came out great. My son loves it, especially with a little whipped cream, though my wife says it could be a little sweeter. A nice recipie to start with though!

I liked this recipe, and after I made it per the recipe the first time, I made a few modifications: 1. Instead of 1/2 cup vegetable shortening, I used 1/4 cup vegetable shortening and 1/4 cup unsalted butter. 2. I added the juice and zest of one clementine. 3. I added 1/4 teaspoon of ground nutmeg. I absolutely love this recipe!

This is really delicious. It did not turn out too wet or sticky on the outside as some gingerbread does and had a perfect texture. I doubled the recipe and used a bundt pan although had to make 6 cupcakes with the rest of the batter that did not fit in the pan. I added some minced crystallized ginger and it was outstanding! Kids loved it too!

Very delicious and moist. I used butter instead of shortening and it came out great. I also doubled the ground ginger. Sprinkle the top with some confectioner's sugar and add a dollop of maple whipped cream...yum!

I have made this exact same recipe for over 45 years, however, over time I have tweaked it a little bit. Delete the allspice, double the powdered ginger, include a generous amount of chopped crystalized ginger, and reduce the hot water by 2 tablespoons, replacing it with fresh ginger juice. I accompany the cake with softly whipped cream and ice cold homemade applesauce. Yes, you now know I'm addicted to gingerbread.

Baked in a 350 degree convection oven in a bundt pan for 48 min. - turned out great. Next time will grease and flour pan and check after 40 min., though.

followed folks' suggestions here and used butter instead of shortening, used more ground ginger and added the 1/3 cup crystallized ginger and OUTSTANDING! I love molasses and ginger both, so this recipe suits me just fine!

I used dark molasses, and decreased the liquids and added some fresh pumpkin puree. Served it with homemade pumpkin ice cream. Omigod.

Delicious. Frosted with cream cheese frosting (the Bon Appetit June '98 version on this site). Kept well in the fridge for 5 days. Had to use butter instead of shortening and had a good result. Makes the house smell wonderful too.

This cake is just like one my Grandmother made when I was a child. She never wrote the recipe out before she past away and my sisters ane I have hunted through the years for a recipe to match that great cake. This is it. My Grandmother used a cup of strong tea instead of water, which darkens the batter and deepens the flavor. A slice warmed with a pat of butter...heaven!

I was looking for a moist gingerbread and I found it. I added half a cup of mashed bananas instead of the shortening to make it low fat, and it turned out beautifully. I will definitely use this again, and it's a great dessert for people with food allergies.

Reminds me of my mother's recipe. Let it cool a few minutes in the pan out of the oven, cut you a piece, slice the piece in half and put a good slice of butter between them. Only thing you need with this is a glass of milk.

Fabulous! I made these in a muffin tin for individual sized cakes & turned them upside down to serve. I heated briefly in the microwave before serving and then topped with sweetened whipped cream, drizzled with a caramel sauce, and sprinkled white chocolate pieces over that. They were wonderful. I also used full flavor molasses but ran out needing about 1/4 cup so I substitued honey for the remainder. I too used heaping measuring spoons of the spices. They had a strong gingerbread flavor which everyone loved. Make this cake! For caramel sauce - 1 stick butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 T milk, 1 t vanilla bring to a boil and cook for 1 minute. Adding cold espresso to the whipped cream for a mocha cream would also be great with this.

I am a novice wedding cake maker that recently used this recipe to rave reviews. A good friend wanted her wedding cake to be all gingerbread so I came to Epicurious because I have never been disapointed...and I wasn't! I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out delicious every time (the only minor adjustments being heaping spoonfulls of each spice listed as opposed to a level measure). Moist, delicious and you really got the gingerbread flavor without it being overpowering like, say, a gingerbread man cookie :) The cake was solid enough for building and stacking - I made a three-tier, double-layer cake to serve approx. 150 people. I didn't hear one complaint and even had a few people pull me aside to tell me it was excellent and tasty! One wedding-goer even said, "I've been to tons of weddings and this is by far the best wedding cake I have ever tasted!" So, if you need a good gingerbread cake recipe look no further - - this is it!

this is a lovely recipe...not too sweet, just a nice strong molasses taste. very moist as well! i took a tip from a previous review and made the recipe as cupcakes (cut the baking time down by ten minutes). it made 12 nice big cakes. it's great for dinner parties done this way....just pop a cupcake out per guest, split in half and add a dollop of whipped cream. this is a keeper...my boyfriend's favorite!

This is, with the exception of a tad more salt, the exact recipe from a Brer Rabbit Molasses recipe book, circa 1948, that I have. The cake IS great--moist and dark, not too sweet. I also added a bit of chopped crystalized ginger and increased spices a bit. Not sure what the substitution for butter is all about (see below), since none is called for. Going to make again today, with poached pears and whipped cream.

Please note 4 forks denotes "A dish beyond compare." This recipe makes a moist cake, almost sticky even, so careful not to over water the mix. It tastes a little too flour-y and I think that is the water talking (like crazy or whacky cake - never fond of the water). Any food scientists out there? Should I try it with half milk, half water instead? I rounded my measures of spices and it could use a little more still. One reviewer said she added fresh ginger root; i will too next time! I added a little cracked pepper. I used DARK organic molasses; much better than the usual jar stuff. A classic with whipped cream.

Unfortunately,I had to make this with margarine as one of my guests is lactose intolerant and can't have butter. Regardless, it was a super moist and delicious cake with a dense, yet somehow still light, texture. I served it with non-dairy whipped cream but now that I've tried it, I'm sure it would go even better with whipped apple butter or apple sauce. It keeps covered very nicely and I look forward to making this again with butter. This recipe is a keeper.

Good...gets better as it sits. I was out of molasses and used 1 cup honey and 1 cup boiling hot coffee to replace the water and it turned out perfectly. Not as sweet as some would like, but very good. I doubled/tripled the spices and added 1/4tsp of black pepper. Very good and super easy!

This was wonderful! Remember that it's a cake- I baked it in an 8x8 and the center was about 3 inches high... I too used butter instead of shortening, and added more spices.

I have made this many times. I use butter instead of shortening and add crystalized ginger as well. I have also made this as mini muffins for lunches. I serve the cake slightly warm with hot caramel sauce and ice cream. The caramel sauce is easy and the recipe is with the "pumpkin bread pudding" from this site. It is a hit with everyone, it's impressive, and the best thing is that it is EASY!

Ive made this recipe again and again. For Christmas, I bought no stick pans and gave a pan and gingerbread to friends as gifts. The only changes I make are 2 tspns of ground ginger and I add about 1/3 cup of crystallized ginger, chopped - we love ginger! For a dinner party I've served it with, variously, Apple Cider Sauce, or Lemon Sauce, or Rum Cream Sauce. I'm invariably asked for the recipe.

I love this cake. I started searching for a gingerbread cake recipe after I had a piece of gingerbread cake in England. It's moist and interesting with great flavors that complement each other. I'm going to make it again this weekend with lemon cream cheese icing. Can't wait!

This cake was a hit with an orange sauce drizzled over it. I lifted the orange sauce from one of the other dessert receipes. One guest said that the orange sauce was what made it so good.

A quick, delicious recipe that's easy for the "culinarily challenged" (me). The cake is moist and quite dense, like something my german grandmother would have made. I used unsalted butter instead of shortening, and topped it off with a lemon cream cheese frosting dusted with crystallized ginger.

I love this recipe. It is always moist and always a winner. Sometimes I top it with whipped cream, and at other times I use a light cream cheese frosting.

This turned out deliciously. It is very much like Honigkuchen in Germany and Holland. I too exchanged the vegetable shortening for butter. Also I find self raising flour makes life a lot easier. I als used freshlt grated ginger root. It cooked much faster in my fan driven oven and that is possibly why it turned out a little dry. Just slice it an spread som cold butter on and Bob's your uncle.

I substituted dark molasses for the mild stuff called for in this recipe, and I used unsalted butter instead of vegetable shortening (hydrogenated oil is toxic -- do yourself a favor and use real butter.) With those 2 little changes, this recipe makes a very nice gingerbread cake, a lot like the one my grandmother used to make for me when I was little.

I brought the cake to a party at work, and just about everyone loved it. I added raisins, and thought it was great. I am making it again today for a party tomorrow.

This is terrific! I added some grated orange rind and grated fresh ginger on the second making and it was even better.

This is a very good cake but it is rich in ginger and molasses flavor and needed the whipped cream! I undercooked it a bit and it was very moist. I added grated candied ginger to the top of the whipped cream and it was both pleasing to the eye and palate. If you like ginger and molasses, you will like this cake. (The kids who ate it weren't too excited about it.)
