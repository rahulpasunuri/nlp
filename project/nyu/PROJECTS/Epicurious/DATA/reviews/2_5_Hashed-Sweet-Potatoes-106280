These were messy but delicious. I'm not sure that complaining about their unwillingness to hold together is fair, since that's kind of the nature of hash browns generally. I like that the simple method allows the great flavor of the sweet potatoes to show through. I'd definitely make this one again!

these were a disaster. the "cook's note" should should not be an excuse for a poorly written recipe. i should have known that sweet potatoes do not have the starch and moisture proportion for this technique. i ended up deep frying the remaining shredded potatoes until they were crispy, which were a nice change and decorative on the plate.

I made this with orange sweet potatoes and it turned out great. Serve with something very lively it is pretty plain (but quite tasty).
