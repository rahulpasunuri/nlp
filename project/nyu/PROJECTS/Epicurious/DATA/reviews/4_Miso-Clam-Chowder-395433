This chowder was delicious. The white miso (called Shiro on the package I bought) does give the soup a very nice taste, without being overwhelming. Did not find littleneck clams here on the West Coast, but put in some small clams that were very delicious. The only change was to put twice the amount of clams (12 clams for four people? That's three clams per bowl of soup). Also, I shelled the clams before serving, but it is not necessary. Will certainly make it again.
