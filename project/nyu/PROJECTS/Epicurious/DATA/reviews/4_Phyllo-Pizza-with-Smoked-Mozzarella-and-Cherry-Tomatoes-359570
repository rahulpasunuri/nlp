Taste was great but my phyllo layers fell apart. Any advice on this?

Made this as an appetizer for a family function today and I really liked it, as did the guests. Pretty easy to put together, and the aromas from the kitchen are really nice -- great if you are looking for something to make 90% of ahead of time, then just pop in the oven 10 minutes before your guests arrive. The phyllo is nice and crunchy, and the roasted tomatoes had a beautiful flavor. I half followed someone's advice below and pierced any tomatoes that hadn't wilted through during the initial roasting so that they wouldn't be "lava bombs." Also went with the smoked mozzarella which I think really added quite a bit to this dish. This was much better out of the oven warm -- after it had sat for a half hour and cooled somewhat, it was still good, but it wasn't 4 fork good. I am definitely putting this in the appetizer rotation since it is so flavorful and so easy to do.

I made this for Shabbat dinner the other night. Wow! It was quite easy and the smoked mozzarella gave it just the earthiness it needed. I would add more herbs and some lemon rind to brighten it even more.

I added some sliced smoked linguiça sausage and didn't have fresh oregano so added shreds of fresh basil when it came out of the oven. Turned out great. Was a nice change from normal pizza crust - but the phyllo crust is on the high maintenance side so can't say I'll be making this one a lot.

This is a keeper! I did half of the pizza with the smoked mozzarella and was curious to see what it was like with feta cheese (ingredients seemed to scream "marry me with feta!!"). Both were fantastic . Doing the two different cheeses gave guests two different options.

A-MAZ-ING!! Our cheese chop was out of smoked mozzarella so we used fresh buffalo mozzarella. We also left it in a couple minutes too long but it was still to die for. Can't wait to make it again this weekend!

Great! Everyone loved it. Was worried that the crust wouldn't hold up to the toppings, but it was fine. I also pulled out of oven earlier than directions said, 20 minutes was enough, would have been burnt otherwise. Only change would be to quarter up the roasted tomotoes prior to adding to top, they were little balls of lava.

I made this for a July 4 potluck and everyone absolutely loved it. They were fighting over the leftovers to take home. So, I am making it for a tapas party I am having this weekend. I agree with the other post that it is a very wise thing to thaw out the phyllo before using! And make sure that the butter is at room temperature so it spreads easily.

Wow! We made it for a poolside lunch. I will add portabella (minis) next time but this was absolutely delicious!

My family and I loved this. A note to impatient cooks out there (like me): don't attempt to use phyllo unless it is completely thawed!

This was perfect! I just wish it made more! The crust is very versatile and a nice departure from the ordinary pizza dough.

I made this last night and it was excellent. My dinner company raved and asked to take home the leftovers. I will add this recipe to my regulars.

This recipe was a delicious appetizer. We made 2 for a neighbor's bbq. Everyone loved it. I agree with another review, do not skip the parmesian cheese between layers. I assembled everything 3 hours before baking. One note, my husband pulled the pizza out 20 minutes into cooking. It was done. The cooking time in the recipe would have been too much. Be careful, after dealing with all the phyllo, don't ruin it at the last minute.

I am Greek and make many a "pita" (otherwise known as pie) using phyllo to enclose filling but this was a wonderful change. It is great as is but also very versatile. I also topped the layers of phyllo with roasted cherry tomatoes, fresh thyme, roasted garlic and slices of onions and that version turned out fantastic as well.
