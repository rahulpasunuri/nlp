This recipe had a lovely tasting sauce. Broiled the chicken and it turned out just fine. I would add more to the skewers.

It works better (and tastier) if you reduce/thicken the sauce prior to basting. I also prefer using some mirin (Japanese sweet rice wine) mixed in the sauce. If you are using white meat, add some oriental sesame oil to the teriyaki sauce to keep the meat from becoming too dry.
