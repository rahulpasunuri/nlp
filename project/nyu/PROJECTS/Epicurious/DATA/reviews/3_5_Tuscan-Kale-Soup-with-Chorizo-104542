This soup is very tasty, however I find that it has better flavor if you substitute at least half of the water with chicken stock. Also, I add chopped fresh tomatoes and garlic, as well as dried rosemary, which really deepens the flavor, too, and gives it more depth and richness. Even better the day after!

Like others, I made this with some alterations. Used 1/2 broth and 1/2 water and added some garlic to the onions. Didn't use chorizo due to fat content, and instead got a chicken/mango/habanero sausage. One thing I might do in the future is to add a parmesan rind to the soup as it simmers. I think that'll add some nice flavors. Overall, though, an easy and yummy dish!

I loved this soup. I had leeks on hand so I used them. I also used 1 lb. of chorizo instead of 1/2 lb. I wanted a little more flavor so I used 4 cups water and 4 cups veggie stock. Yummy.

With a few changes, my husband and I LOVE this soup. I sauteed onions in coconut oil (olive oil at high temps not healthy). Sub'd chic broth for water, and hit the pot with the Bamix so all pureed before the addition of the chorizo and the kale. I will double the kale next time - it's fabulous. We found the dish too bland so added a considerable amount of Cholula hot sauce. Fabulous - "ripens with age" and will be made again and again!

I'm a vegetarian, so i use veggie sausage or soy chorizo - it's just as delish! I also add chopped garlic when I cook up the "meat"

I did as many suggested by adding stock instead of water and bumped up taste with chili powder, sun dried tomatoes and strips of soppresto (the only spicy meat i had on hand) which I had sauted and drained beforehand. Good soup.

This is an easy and very tasty recipe that I would do again for a winter dinner. To cut back on fat and calories, I substitute organic Brat Haus chicken sausage, preferably the Spicy Italian. If I don't have them, I have used their organic chicken bratwurst that are flavored with fennel seeds. Fennel is a terrific flavor with the kale and potatoes. We like things a little spicy, so we add dashes of Tobasco's Chipotle hot sauce to taste to our individual servings. I also make two cooking method changes: I steam the kale because it can have a strong flavor if you cook it with the potatoes (but this is a matter of personal taste). Also, the potatoe masher doesn't work. Instead, I use a stick blender right in the pot. Blend the soup before adding the steamed kale and the browned sausage. Make it a day ahead and it tastes even better.

I made this recipe tonight for the first time. It was obvious it had insufficent spices, so my additions were; 3 minced cloves of garlic cooked with the onions, chicken bullion (Better Than Bullion Chicken Base is my favorite) to taste added to the water, New Mexico chili powder to taste added into the water (living in Colorado I had 3 different types to add,) and at the end I added some Masa corn flour to taste. One can shake the flour with COLD water in a small glass jar to allow a smooth texture into the soup. This balances the chili flavors well. We cooked it about 20-30 min. longer on low which allowed the kale cook longer.That all said, this was FABULOUS! My husband and I believed it was the best kale soup we've ever had!

Mmm, delicious. I used half water, half chicken broth, and only half an onion. Substituted Soyrizo, because, sadly, I am dieting. This is great soup. Perfect for a chilly day. Incidentally, this is the first time using Soyrizo. It tastes better than expected. Would use again.

As others have noted, I use half chicken broth and half water. Also,I use my food processor to slice both the sausage and the potatoes - really saves time! I previously made this soup with regular kale and a spicy Italian hard sausage, and it was good. Then I found a source for Spanish Chorizo and Tuscan Kale (Peapod). OMG it improved this soup beyond belief! I still do, however, add Garlic, and 5c chicken broth and 3c water and some crushed cayenne. Drizzle each bowl w/ olive oil before serving. 2008 - This year I grew Tuscan Kale in my garden (harvest after nights turn cold) just to make this soup - wow!

Great tastiong! As recommended, I sauteed onions and garlic in the remaining chorizo oil, adding olive oil. My suggestion is to drain the chorizo on paper towels, then slice into quarters before adding to soup.

Great soup, I did use chicken broth in place of water and lean hot Italian turkey sausage instead of the chorizo. Great fall dish!

At least Three forks as cooked. Quick and easy, this one is going into the rotation. I followed everyone's advice and used stock instead of water to make a very nice soup. Next time, I think I will fry the Chorizo first, then reserve it and add a little oil as needed to the Chorizo oil and fry the onions and potatoes in that. I'd probably still use stock though.

I added some boullion, as recommended by other reviewers. I also was feeling a bit indulgent and kept a bit of the Chorizo oil...it came out very flavorful.

I just made this with Spanish-style chorizo, and I think that's the key. Spanish chorizo is incredibly flavorful and nothing like sausage you get in the refrigerated case at the grocery store. I used a LOT more kale and only 3.5 ounces of chorizo, so it was really healthy as well as tasty and filling.

This soup is classic Portuguese, not Tuscan! Anyway, I make it all the time, with the addition of a few cloves of garlic. easy and so satisfying. You MUST use Portuguese linguiça sausage, nothing else is quite right!

There is a similar recipe for Caldo Verde on Williams-Sonoma.com that calls for two onions instead of one, and 3-4 cloves of garlic. I use a hot chicken chorizo from Whole Foods and would never describe it as bland. It's one of my winter favorites.

I made the soup almost as written (except with the addition of garlic and half chicken brother instead of water) and found it to be really bland. I ended up throwing in a boullion cube at the end, some paprika and I think a packet of Sazon and it turned out great!

a satisfying soup. i made a batch on monday night and brought it to work for lunch all week. the flavor improved each day... i cooked the onions at a low temperature for quite a while, letting them become sweet. and as a previous reviewer suggests, be generous with salt and pepper.

I found this dish to be rather bland. I added chicken broth and garlic. I substituted a italian style chicken sausage instead of chorizo. This recipe has potential, but ultimately lacks flavor. I'm not sure if it was my sausage subsitution or something else, but I'm not quite sure why the other reviewers raved (and I used all organic ingrediants!)

This soup is an excellent quick way to cook kale. I did it after work and was done in less than an hour. I found the broth lacking depth, but I did following the recipe exactly. Maybe if I had copied a few of the suggestions by reviewers, it would have been a bit more lively. Will try a few other kale soup recipes, but may come back to this one.

Rating: 4
Marvelous. The only thing I changed in this recipe is how I cooked the chorizo; instead of slicing it, I removed the casing and crumbled it with my spoon while browning it. Don't make any substitutions and follow the directions and quantities exactly for a soup with a clean, classic flavor. And if you can't find good-quality chorizo or linguiça, leave it out all together. I agree with the previous reviewer, who said that good-quality ingredients are a must for this dish.

Rating: 4
This is classic comfort food. I love it in all its simple yet flavorful glory. Don't be tempted to sub chicken stock or add a lot of other stuff (I will admit to adding a bit of garlic with the onions though) -- just cook the onions slowly and well and be liberal with salt and pepper. And use good quality ingredients, especially the olive oil. The final dish is warm, rich, and hearty, even without sausage (in fact I prefer it without). Serve sausage on the side for everyone to stir in if they want it. I just finished a bowl of this and my tummy is very happy now!

This was wonderful with a few adjustments. I added garlic to the onions, some rinsed canned cannelloni beans with the kale, and a touch of freshly grated nutmeg at the end. Served with dried chili flakes and freshly grated parmesan cheese.

I added garlic and paprika as another reviewer suggested, just before the potatoes, and also a light veggie stock in place of water. I'd tried a Portughese Kale soup prior that I thought was kind of bland, but this recipe with my alterations was terrific. I used hot Italian sausage in place of chorizo. Maybe not entirely authentic, but very tasty.

As a Portuguese American, I chuckled at the thought of this Portuguese classic being referred to as "Tuscan". But hey, whatever encourages people to eat their dark green veggies is fine by me. Now, please make this soup with a good Portuguese Linguica, NOT chourico. Silvas in San Jose, CA makes a really good one. Then check out Ana Ortin's Portuguese Homestyle Cooking cookbook. She gives a dozen or so real Portuguese soups, most involving kale. If you like soup, you will enjoy the book.

I tweaked this one slightly and got an excellent result. In place of the sausage, I used a hamburger pattie that I fried in advance in the olive oil and substituted crisp Romaine lettuce in place of the kale. I sprinkled the salt directly on the pattie and added the onion sliced into fine paper-thin slices. Rather than boil the potatos, I cut them into rough wedges and double-cooked them "Belgian style" in a deep fryer, turning them into delicious pommes frites. Drink the water (cold) in a glass and serve the pattie on a bun with the Romaine (raw)and a bit of mayo. Delicious.

I used linquisa instead of chorizo and added a clove of garlic in with the onions. It was fantastic. My kids even asked for seconds!!!

The quality of the chorizo is what makes or breaks this dish. Also,I think using plain water makes for a cleaner taste than using chicken stock.

This recipe provides a great start, but it's a little bit bland. I followed the advice already given and substituted chicken stock for half the water, and I pureed a few cups of the soup in a blender before adding it back to the pot and serving. I think adding red pepper flakes would have helped (or maybe using a more spicy type of sausage). We ate the soup with grated parmesan cheese sprinkled on top.

I already had a recipe for kale soup but this was slightly different. It was a big hit. I did use the Goya Sazon (1/2 pkg for single serving), a couple cloves of garlic and a little crushed red pepper. I only used about 1 lb of the potatoes and pureed them with the broth in a blender before adding back to the soup. I also used 6 cups chicken broth and added water as needed.

We had this soup at a restaurant and I came to this web site to duplicate it. I also took advice of others,using all chicken broth and adding Goya seasoning(1 pkg for dbl.recipe). I added a tsp or so of crushed red pepper. All guests have asked for more and most wanted the recipe and have made it.I've used unpeeled new potaoes and peeled bakers and it doesn't matter.Our chorizo is milled so you cannot cut it into pieces-it's just crumbled and browned and it's still wonderful!!

Perhaps this is blasphemous to the soup's tuscan heritage, but I threw in a lot of other things because the reviews made me fear it would be bland. I basically used what I had on hand: regular kale, redskin potatoes, shallots, no sausage, added some veggie bouillon, a lot of salt and one dried chipotle pepper while simmering. Mashed those potatoes completely and found this soup to be truly tasty!!!!!

I thought this receipe was excellent. I usually do not praise my own cooking, but I told all my guests I thought it was wonderful. I did use chicken broth. I also used chourzio which is the portugese sausage. No doubts about this receipe at all.

wE HAD THIS FOR DINNER LAST NIGHT AND THOUGH I QUESTIONED THIS RECIPE, MY HUSBAND AND I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT. I DID ADD SOME EXTRA SPICE, 2 GARLIC CLOVES WITH THE ONIONS AND USED HALF CHICKEN BROTH FOR THE WATER. WE ARE MAKING IT AGAIN SOON TO TAKE TO SOMEONE WHO IS COMING HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL FROM SURGERY. MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE REALLY EATING SOMETHING HEALTHY. TRY THIS ONE.

I made this soup with regular kale (only one I could find), 5 cups chicken broth and 3 cups water, added 1 tbsp minced garlic with the onion, and added a packet of Goya seasoning as suggested. Still found it a little bland. I added 1/2 tsp of Emeril's Essence and this definitely made a difference. We also found the flavour much fuller and richer the second day. Would definitely make again using all chicken broth.

Delicious! I recommend, though, mashing the potatoes thoroughly to give the soup a creamy, savoury texture. My husband loved it, even though he was doubtful at first.

I love this soup, but my version [taken, I think, from Emeril Lagasse on tv a couple of years back] uses cannellini beans [Goya's alubias] and andouille salame; and when serving the soup, he added fresh mint and parmesan cheese. I remember thinking "ugh, mint & parmesan, yuk" but I tried it and it's great.

Note to those readers who thought the recipe bland and used chicken stock, take these tips: if you use really good quality potatoes (i recommend yellow finns or the fingerling potatoes and not cheap potatoes in a bag), saute the onions well, season appropriately with salt, and finish each bowl of soup by adding a teaspoon of really good extra virgin olive oil, the flavors should shine through the use of water, which is used instead of stock specifically to let the potato taste through. Just make sure to mash the potatoes more than the recipe suggests -- almost completely -- and salt the soup sufficiently. Using filtered water is key if your tap water tastes off. This method is much closer to the portuguese soup caldo verde, which if made with top quality (not necessarily top cost) ingredients is extremely tasty.

Epicurious is such a great place for open education. For my stove top this is one of the best soup pots to have simmered here in my Canadian kitchen. I used chorizo, alto I can imagine turkey or lamb sausage just as nice in this broth, and I did use black kale. The Cadallic of kale. I did not use potatoes tho . . . instead parsnips. Wow. If you feel adventurous tonight, try the snips.

I used to live in Portugal many year's ago. I also use to make soap like they do in Portugal. But I haven't made this for many year's. I would love to start to make it again like they do. I was reading the other ratings. If anybody has the real recipe like they make in Portugal, could they please email me. I would thrilled if I could start to make this soup again. I always love it. Also if anybody has any other Portuguese recipe's I would appreciate very very much!!!!!!!!!!! ( Debbir0622@hotmail.com)

(auntiemo@mediaone.net) Being of Portuguese descent, I have been making 'kale soup' for many years. I begin with a beef shank, which I brown in the olive oil, then add the onion, chorico and stew beef. I also use a packet of Goya seasoning, (my secret ingredient)which gives any dish an uplift.

This soup IS essentially the same as the Portuguese green soup my family loves. The only difference is that my recipe starts by boiling the potatoes, then adding the mashed potatoes back to their boiling water, then a chopped onion, the kale, s&p, and some garlic sausage if desired. The olive oil goes in last to emulsify. It's not supposed to be a garlicky or strong flavored soup. It's just delicious!

This is very similar to a recipe my mother got from a Portuguese woman who used to take care of me. When Mom submitted it for a family cookbook, I remembered the flavor immediately and couldn't wait to make it! She boils kale and onion together (no oil), adds kidney beans & quartered potatoes; when potatoes are done, adds chorizo and beef boullion cubes. I think I sauteed onion and kale briefly in olive oil. Next time, I will brown sausage first, as it is greasy. Very satisfying.

Rating: 3
I have been making a similar soup ( a Portugese soup with Kale and Chourizo, which is garlicky) for years, and love it. This is a simpler and less rich receipe, yet works well. I would agree that more olive oil and some minced garlic would enhance the experience.

This recipe is a bit boring. I, too, used chicken stock instead of water. I added a spent parmesian cheese rind to the broth, which helped enormously. We also sprinkled fresh reggiano parm on top of the soup. I think the basic recipe is good, it just needs some help.

Rating: 2
I thought the soup sounded rather tasteless as it was written, so I made some changes: used tinned chicken broth instead of water, used more olive oil, about 1/4 cup, and used sweet Italian sausage and spinach, as I couldn't get chorizo or kale. It was very Italian and very satisfying.
