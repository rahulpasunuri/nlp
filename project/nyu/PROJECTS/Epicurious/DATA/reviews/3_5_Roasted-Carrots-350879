These are absolutely the best carrots we ever ate given that I cooked them much less than the recipe states. I followed the advice of the other reviewers and started at 425 for 20 minutes then cut to 300 degrees. I too left them in only about 10 minutes at the lower temperature. It should be noted that I am using small organic carrots, and if you are using the large ones, you would need to adjust accordingly. I rarely salt anything, but a sprinkle of red Himalaya salt really sets them off. I also agree that a sprinkle of any good herb is also a good idea.

Just bought some colorful carrots at our farmer's market and found this recipe. I agree with all the reviewers who warned against overcooking. Who ever heard of setting the stove at 500 for ANYTHING? I did my first 20 min roasting at 425 and then cut to 300. Watched them carefully and and I doubt I kept the carrots in at 300 for more than 10 mins. They were great. I sprinkled some lemon basil on the carrots along with the salt and pepper. Any mild herb would have added a nice touch.

Cooked much faster than listed

We really enjoyed the roasted carrots that accompanied our tomatoes, shallots and roast beef the day after Christmas. The next time I prepare them, I would roast them at a slightly lower temp or for less time. Adding herbs or a sprinkling of balsamic would be good as well.

Very simple but satisfying. I love the use of different color carrots!

The time and temp worked beautifully for me, with 5-inch, medium thickness carrots. Easy and more reliable than any other roasting method I've used for carrots. I suspect it would be lovely for parsnips as well. If your carrots are smaller or more slender, I suspect a shorter cooking time is in order, but the 500 degrees lends to nice caramelization and the 325, to tenderness.

500 degrees is too high a temp. My carrots burned to a crisp in less than 20 mins. I will probably try again at a lower temp, maybe 425.

These lovely, tiny carrots burned black and crisp at 500 degrees, we were able to get a bite of each near the tops. The stuffed pork was great! pbonbrest@cox.net

Roasted carrots are delicious. I added orange zest and rosemary for some extra flavor.

Hardly feels like a recipe, it's so simple. I added quartered brussels sprouts to the roasting which was particularly colorful.

I didn't use farmers market carrots but it still turned out pretty wekk. They really need a long time to cook.

I followed the reviewer's advice to reduce the cooking times and this was beautiful and delicious. Definitely will incorporate into the standards - served alongside fried chicken, mashed potatoes and onion gravy. Yum

My family has decided that this is the only way to cook carrots. I make this recipe about once a week.

This recipe is so easy and honestly, the finished product results in the best cooked carrots that I have ever eaten. I was able to find 6-8 inch carrots at our Nugget market. They were so fresh that I decided to forego the peeling process. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I did reduce the cooking time, as the carrots were very tender after the 20 minutes at 500 and then 15 minutes at 325. This recipe definitely means that carrots will be a frequent offering at my dinner table.

This was quite easy and very good. I made a smaller batch with multi-colored organic carrots and everyone enjoyed them. It's not fancy so it accompanies rich dishes very well. I made it with "Pork Roast with Winter Fruits and Port Sauce." I'll defininately make the carrots again.

Served with Christmas dinner. However, leaving some of the carrot top on per the pics made for a smoky roast. The flavor was very carroty But roasted beets are more striking on the plate and taste better
