Love these -- I add 1/4 tsp cayenne for a little extra oomph.

a simple and delicious snack.full of flavor. I used Bragg's Liquid Aminos instead (didn't have Tamari on hand)... better than when I made these with the Tamari.

I am totally paranoid about burning nuts, since I have burned nuts so many many times. I did 10 min and 20 min and the almonds came out great. Never again will I pay my health foods store $6 for a tiny little thing of tamari almonds, mwa hahahahhaaha!! oh and I didn't have tamari sauce on hand, used low sodium soy sauce with a sprinkle of sea salt at the end, still good.

Burnt, I wish I had read the reviews first. The recipe is flawed, less cook time than listed.

I used shorter cooking times, but what a lovely, simple delicious treat. Probably too plain for those that like "everything" chips!

I'm not sure I understand the negative reviews. The recipe is exactly what it says it is. These taste just like tamari almonds that you can buy at Whole Foods but at a much lower cost.

These are a favorite snack at our house! I found that cooking them for 22 minutes was better at 25 minutes they were a little burned.

My almonds burned with the times given. Nothing special with the sugar/ tamari mixture.

Salty almonds, big deal. I reduced the recipe to test, and I am glad I didn't waste a full 6 lbs. of nuts on this ho-hum recipe. Nuts!
