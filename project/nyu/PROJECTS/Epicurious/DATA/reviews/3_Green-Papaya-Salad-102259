I thought it was quite good. Added some extra vegetables I had around and some peanuts as suggested in another review. Skipped the jerky. Nice and light!

The flavors are great! It's really important to get the papaya julienned; my thicker slices did not work. Also skipped the jerky.

I also skipped the jerky and added fresh green beans and raw peanuts like I've had it in restaurants which adds color and texture. The flavors in this recipe are exceptional and just as I hoped (I would have never gotten the dressing right without it).

I blended this recipe with the other one on this website (it calls for shrimp). I used halved grape tomatoes instead of one large and that helped with the texture. I also added fresh grean beans for crunch and about 1/3 cup chopped cilantro. I omitted the ginger and beef jerky and added just a tad more fish sauce. It was great for summer!

I'm thrilled I found this recipe. I was in Laos a year ago and saw just what is described above. A lady pounded the green papaya with her machete and crushed chilis with a mortar and pestle to make this dish right before me. I loved it, but didn't pay enough attention to what went into it. This recipe tastes exactly like what I had in Laos. I couldn't be happier.

The flavors are interesting but the textures really don't work. The jerky is tough, the papaya is the consistency of a raw potato, and then the soft tomato. "Confusing" as my husband said. Skip this one. So glad I tested it before bringing it to our Thai themed supper club.
