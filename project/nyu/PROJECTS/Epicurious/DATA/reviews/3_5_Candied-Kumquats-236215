I made some grilled chicken breast that were just awful but I had read this recipe last week and thought I would see if this sauce could help. I did a few substitutions. Red onion for Shallots and dried figs for kumquats and I have the most amazing blackberry- ginger balsamic vinegar. Well, in mere minutes, I turned my former disaster into a triumph! It is just outstanding and I will make it again. Quick, easy and awesome. I also added a little butter.

I'm not sure if something went wrong but I wasn't really impressed. The fruit tasted waxy while they were hot and only a little better once they'd cooled. This I will say, the syrup from the fruit was absolutely delicious.

This recipe is so easy! I added a dash of salt after cooking. I plan to serve it tomorrow with my Thanksgiving dinner.
