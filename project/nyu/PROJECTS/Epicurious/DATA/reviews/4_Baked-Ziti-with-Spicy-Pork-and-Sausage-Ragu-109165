What a greasy, unappetizing waste of pork products. There is no tomato sauce, it's all grease and water. Skip this.

I never like anything I cook but this was phenomenal! I made some substitutions because the pork shoulder was intimidating. I subbed one pound of ground pork for the shoulder and upped the hot italian sausage by an extra 1/3 of a pound. I kept the pancetta. I only had a pound of ziti which was fine. I used a cheap merlot. I used slightly more thyme and garlic since some reviewers said theirs ended up bland. Also, I used canned tomatoes that were already seasoned with garlic and oregano. I got away with cooking the sauce for 1 1/2 hours instead of 2. It was ever so *slightly* watery so maybe next time I would up the meat content a little bit or cook it longer. The flavor was SO GOOD. Everyone had seconds and I've been craving leftovers all day. I almost didn't make this because of the time commitment and pork butt thing, but it was so worth it!

What a fantastic recipe. I used mild Italian sausage (worried about too much heat for the toddlers) and all I had was a lighter Pinot Noir, but this still turned out just beautifully. I made the ragu two days before putting it together for a very happy mid-week meal. Did I mention how good this is? Definite going in the permanent winter comfort food file.

An absolutely perfect dish. I made it as printed and found it very flavorful and sufficiently spicy and I do like spicy. It was meaty and cheesy! A great combo. Making a meat sauce like this does take time, so if you can do it the day before you'll not only allow the flavors to improve, but it won't seem so arduous. BTW, the recipe calls for you to taste and adjust seasonings while cooking, which means you determine the level of salt/papper. You are expected to add more than the sprinkling on the pork before browning. Great recipe.

Made this last night for a dinner party with friends and did not modify the recipe. It definitely needed salt so I adjusted to taste before baking as the recipe suggests. This was incredible. Everyone asked for seconds and leftovers to take home. I would kick up the spice a bit more next time because we like it spicy but this is a keeper. Highly recommend it, totally worth the time.

Made this last night with a couple modifications since it's what I had on hand: used bacon instead of pancetta, no pork shoulder, used sweet italian turkey sausage & no bay leaves. I was a bit skeptical about using 2 whole cups of wine, but the sauce had amazing flavor. My kids (3 & 5) ate it up and my wife and I both had seconds.

Very good. Made 2 batches. First batch I cooked in the pot for 2 hours. The second batch after browing, cooked in the slow cooker on low for 8 hours. Winner ... slow cooker, though both were great!

This was VERY time consuming but the end result was very flavorful! The pork came out really tender and It was a little heavy with meat for my tastes but my boyfriend could not get enough of it. For that reason alone, I'm sure I will be making it again

I had such high hopes for this! The recipe took a long time to make and I was underwhelmed. I found the recipe bland--even after the addition of more red pepper and garlic. On the bright side my kids liked it.

This is the dish most frequently requested by my family. I make the meat version using chicken sausage instead of pork sausage. Since we have some vegetarians in the family, I make an extra pan of a non-meat version using mushrooms (I use cremini but shitakes would also be great). I brown the mushrooms to bring out the flavor, deglaze the pan with a little red wine and add some mushroom demiglace if I have it. Last time I also included Field Roast Italian "Sausage" (Field Roast is a vegan product that is very good--liked even by my strongest carnivores). Adding the vegan sausage brought in a lot of flavor and texture. I'm getting to like the veggie version more and it's much easier to prepare.

This was fantastic. My culinary professional husband loved it. I did make a few substitutions: used Linguicia sausage instead of Hot Italian, and used packaged diced pork instead of the pork butt (made things much easier). Also omitted the wine (dry household) ... used chicken stock. I braised in a 350 degree oven for the same amount of time.

I just have to tell ya--have made this many times & always to silence & then "OMG!" The last time I made this, one of the guests had 3 helpings of it--and asked for some to take home. And she is just a little lady! I do make the sauce at least a day ahead. Able to get all the fat/grease out of the sauce that way. And it really is best for the sauce. Truely comfort food at it's best.

For the purists, my version deviates from the recipe in the following way: I used 1 pound of ground sirloin in place of the pork shoulder, sweet Italian turkey sausage in place of the hot sausage, increased the red pepper to 1 tsp to compensate for not using hot sausage, and penne noodles instead of ziti (I used what I had on hand). That said, this was excellent; the sauce had a meaty, savory flavor, quite distinct from tomato-based sauces that might be used for lasagne. I was a bit worried that it was too watery, but once mixed with the pasta and baked, all the extra liquid was absorbed. This was a perfect recipe to bring to someone else's house, with no last minute steps required, and was gobbled up by 8 hungry basketball fans. I would like to try this with the pork sometime, but in a pinch, I think a variety of meats could substitute. I would try to undercook the pasta just a bit to avoid soggy pasta

OMG! Soooooo yummy. I read a review that gave this 1 star and almost didn't make it. I think it's key to make sure to cut as much fat off the butt as possible. I also added mushrooms but mostly made this as is. a big hit!!

Rating: 3
Delicious. I used a pound of pasta and agree that it was plenty. I might even use a little less next time. Having said that, I agree with the people who said that a ragu should not be very saucy. My sauce ended up being much more watery than I had expected, so I might simmer with the lid off for a while next time. The more simmering the better. I might also cut the meat into smaller chunks, like another reviewer suggested. Great for casual company.

Rating: 4
This is outstanding! Very easy to make, it just takes time. Only few minor changes: cooked the meat under pressure for 15 minutes, use one pound of ziti, added an extra can of tomatoes (all italian seasoned), more garlic and pepper. I made this for three and I thought it was going to be leftovers for the week...it was all gone by next day. Highly recommend!

Outstanding! The mellow layering of this dish was perfect. I think the only thing I'd change is to chop the carrots a bit larger, maybe 1" chunks,for a better balance between meat and vegi's. The pork was so tender and broke apart easily with a fork. Serve with a frisee salad with a lemon mustard vinegrette with a poached egg and crispy fried pancetta, yum!

This was very, very good; I do not give 4 forks lightly. I would definitely suggest making this ahead of time, cooling it, spooning off the fat, and reheating it. I got at least a cup of fat out of this dish, for which I was thankful. I'm sure that the dish remained incredibly fatty, and my waistline just does not need that kind of meal. Plus, I would imagine that it might taste greasy without getting rid of a good amount of the fat (more than you could get out while it's hot). I thought that the mozzarella was beside the point. It just added more fat to the dish, which was obviously not necessary, and it didn't add much to the taste. Next time I might just add the parmesan and bake it that way. I would definitely suggest making this dish on a cold night.

I've made this several times and it definitely is a keeper!! I've used bacon, culatello and prosciutto instead of the pancetta, always still a hit!! Prepare up to the braising stage the night before and hit the crock-pot while you're at work the next day. Use multi-grain pasta and turkey italian sausage to "healthy it up" a bit... Crusty Bread and a spicy red wine - AMAZING!!

Great recipe, but for some reason mine came out extremely spicy. I made it with no pork, just the sausage. I think that the sausage I used must have been extra hot. I recommend testing the spiciness before adding any red pepper.

Rating: 3
GREAT recipe! The only change that I made was to reduce the amount of ziti (I used penne). The result was perfect and the flavor oh so good. Next time I will make the sauce ahead and chill to get rid of the excess fat. Served with a simple salad and garlic toast.

I've made this dish twice. For me, it calls for too much pork, so I cut out some the second time around. I found it easiest to make the sauce a day in advance and refridgerate over-night. That was I could easily remove all the fat that collected at the top. Would still add a little more tomatoes to make it a little saucier. It's a very good, hearty meal.

This is the first time my husband said "it's the worst dinner ever". We love to cook and love great food and love this website so I am mystified by the reviews.I followed the recipe to a tee, thank goodness it snowed tonight in Vancouver and my guests did not come as I would have been mortified to serve this. The ragu itself was flavorful, but I don't understand the mix of cheese and pasta with it. I won't ever make it again. Ragu with a baguette, maybe...well...no! Just not to our desire.period, had to write.

Perfect for cold winter or fall days. Get a couple bottles of wine, perhaps some movies, and cook this all day. I used more pancetta than the recipe called for, and it turned out amazing. I didnt add any more cheese, as I Didnt want to reduce the flavours allready present. Also, it is a traditional Ragu, so its not saucy at all. I guess the Canned Spagetti Sauce "Ragu" throws a lot of people off. This is traditional Italian cooking.

I made this twice (once as a test run, again for a party). My advice would be to make the cubes smaller ½ to three-quarter inch cubes. When I made it as instructed the meat didn't break apart like it was supposed to. But the second time was the BOMB! Meaty, meaty, awesome ZITI!

This is excellent. I too do not like saucy pasta dishes, even pasta with meat sauces I usually put half as much sauce as my husband likes, I thought this was perfect. I did add a layer of ricotta mixed with an egg in the middle and loved, loved, loved this dish. Great for a party because you can make the day before and reheat as the flavors get to meld overnight. Anyone knows a pasta dish like this is better the next day!

This is so yummy! I made this and added one more step. I put half of the ziti mixture in the baking pan, topped that with spoonfuls of whole milk ricotta cheese then topped with the remaining ziti mixture and cheese.Make the sauce at least 1 day in advance to let the flavors marry. Yum!

This was a fantastic recipe! I used bacon instead of pancetta with good results. I froze the remainder and it heated up beautifully.

This is just so good. So good that I really wish I were home today to have it for lunch, though I just had it last night for dinner.

Like many others, I made this dish for a small dinner party on a cold (California) winter night. It was fantastic. I have to weigh in on this "saucy or dry" issue. First of all, I grew up in an immigrant Italian family and I am well on the record among my friends for not liking saucy dishes and I know that these baked pasta dishes especially are not intended to be saucy - which is part of why I love them. Having said that, after I had added all the ingredients, I came across a small jar of gourmet crushed tomatoes from Italy in my pantry and I could not resist adding it. I'm glad I did -- it was perfect. I must say, I used a little more pasta though. One of my guests was a professional athlete (who is notorious for eating large quantities) and he had 4 helpings (big ones.) My friend's husband (a lanky fellow) had 3 and the rest of us had 2 each plus, my friend reported gobbling up the leftovers with her 5 year old for lunch the next day. I served it with a simple spinach braised with olive oil and garlic, a warm "take and bake" Pain Rustic from LaBrea Bakery, a hearty Tuscan Red and a chocolate/hazelnut gelato with cooled espresso over the top. I too had leftovers today with the last glass of the wine and it was divine. I actually warmed it in the microwave because it had become a little too dry in the fridge and the moisture was the perfect touch although my mother used to actually reheat these dishes in a fry pan over medium heat with just a touch of olive oil in the pan -- that's how prone to the slightly drier, slightly crunchy the Italians are. I would also make sure you get it out of the oven right at 20 minutes and I recommend searing the pork aggressively to lock in the moisture and flavor. It is a great "putter around the house project." I made the sauce the night before and simmered gently for another hour during reheat.

This was marvelous! My husband doesn't care for baked ziti, but he absolutely loved this. I think he is so used to getting the watered-down version (ground beef, tomato sauce and pasta)that this dish came as a total surprise. It has a depth of flavor that is delightful to behold. Although it was time consuming, that doesn't bother me in the least. Nothing pleases me more than to spend a few hours in the kitchen preparing a great meal. I loved the work and the results!

Delicious! I was raised with only home made Italian food - no jarred sauce ever, so I am a strick Italian critic. I mixed half smoked with half regular mozarella, and had to cut out the red pepper as my husband does not like spicy. He still said it was spicy, whereas it was perfectly tangy to me. This will be my only baked ziti recipe that I will make from now on!

Absolutely yummy!! I added an extra can of tomatoes because it seemed a bit dry, also used mild Italian sausage and controlled the heat with the crushed pepper flakes. It was overly hot (for my taste) until it was mixed with the pasta and cheeses, then it was perfect. This recipe is certainly a keeper.

This ragu is FANTASTIC! I followed the recipe very closely but did follow others advice about layering, ala Lasagne style, however I layer with a simple bechamel + mozz + parm and it turned out amazing. Also, I trimmed a lot of the fat off the pork when cubing it so didn't have the "too much fat" issue, just enough to add all the flavor. My husband had thirds! It makes a ton so great for cooking ahead for reheat dinners. Absolutely recommend this.

This recipe is a winner. Easy to make crowd pleaser. Make sure you use a quality wine (preferably old world style Barbera or Chianti) that you would serve to guests, and add additonal crushed tomatoes as desired to make a bit more sauce. Recipe was a bit dry the first time I made this. For those with guests sensitive to spicey foods, cut the crushed red pepper in half and use 1/2 lb mild and 1/2 lb spicey Italian sausage. I love this dish!!

This dish was delicious and enjoyed by all. I was afraid the wine taste would be too dominant when it first started simmering, but it mellowed nicely with the tomatoes. I added a little tomato paste which was nice. I also used fresh smoked mozzarella in addition to non-smoked and it went really well.

This is sooo good! Especially since the sauce can be made the day---or even 2 before. Better for the ingredients to marry. It combines my favorite--bolonenese (or however it is spelled!) & baked pasta. Serves a crowd. And they all think it's "out of this world!" All ya need is a great antipasto (mixed antipasto on this site is perfect!) green salad, really crusty bread & it's a winner.

This is probably one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had! This made a huge amount, so two of us were eating leftovers for a week (and gladly so!).

Highly recommended!

This is delicious! I changed one thing because I was taking it to a family with children, I used sweet sausage instead of spicy as I knew it might be a bit too hot for them. It was still delicious and I didn't change anything else in the recipe. Fixed enough for our family and they rarely make this much of a to-do over anything. I made the ragu a day ahead just so it could sit in the fridge and marinate for a better flavor. Using the better cheeses is a good recommendation. (whole milk mozz. and good parmasean)

This recipe is so good. Have made it several times and adjusted a few things and used other's suggestions. Increased the sausage to 1 1/2#, added an additional can of diced Roma tomatoes, a can of tomato paste, and a few tablespoons of various Italian seasonings. Also layered the ingredients to disperse the cheeses. The ragu is truely best made several days in advance. This is a winner and great for a crowd.

This recipe ROCKS. I've made it 4 or 5 times and everyone always loves it. I do like mine a little spicier and I only use a lb of penne, but otherwise, I do it exactly as called for. Anyone who doesn't like this recipe did something wrong or tried to shortcut. Use the right, high quality ingredients and you just can't miss.

THis was a huge hit the first time I made it. The flavors blended wonderfully. Im not sure what happened to the cook who thought the pork wasn't very flavorful. The flavor was well developed in mine. Maybe whe wasn't aggressive enough in the browning. My husband must have said at least 4 times during dinner, "Wow, this is really good." I did make it with a little less ziti than called for. It came in 1 lb packages and I didn't see the need to buy a whole other package for a little bit. THis could easily be a company dish for a crowd when you really want to impress. I also used just a little extra cheese. Added some asiago and romano that I had laying around and needed to use up. Gave the cheese layer a bit more complexity. Use high quality cheese!

Rating: 3
Thought flavors worked really well. The ragu was so rich, I ommitted the mozzarella & baking -- just tossed the ragu with pasta and served with parmesan at the table. While everyone else found the dish "delicious", I thought the pork shoulder should have had more flavor with the slow cooking. I would make it again, but either with more sausage/less pork shoulder or try to find more flavorful pork shoulder. The consistency was exactly right for a ragu. Complex flavors make this a guest worthy dish.

This dish is definitely time consuming in prep and cooking time, but well worth the effort. Everyone that tried it loved it!

Also used double the cheese since I baked it in three casserole dishes instead of one. Absolutely fabulous!

This ragu sauce is extremely good, and I would definitely make it again. I divided the recipe half to make 4 servings. The changes I made for my 1/2 recipe were: subbed 2 oz. Louis Rich low-fat chopped and formed turkey bacon, subbed 6 oz. (by weight) pre-cooked pork sirloin roast, subbed 2 links (4.5 oz. total) of Hillshire Farm beef hot links, subbed 1/2 tsp. dried thyme, added 1/2 tsp. of Italian seasoning, subbed dry white wine, subbed a 14.5 oz. can of Italian diced tomatoes, subbed penne pasta and reduced it to 8 oz., and mixed a bit of ricotta cheese with the mozzarella and parmesan cheeses. I divided the mixture between two 8-1/2 by 4-1/2 inch glass bread loaf pans, baked one and froze the other (without any cheese). Even though I had pre-cooked pork and sausage, it still took me 1-3/4 hours to get this in the oven, but I did start from scratch with chopping the veggies, pork, and sausage, shredding the cheeses, etc. Next time I would use lean boneless country ribs (as suggested), and simmer it for 2 hours with extra diced tomatoes, as my pre-cooked sirloin was too lean, therefore it remained very dry.

I will mirror other raters comments. It was good, but I prefer more spice. Next time I will either make with all Italian sausage or really up the red pepper and add some fennel seed. As for the pork, definately use boneless short ribes instead of the boston butt (pork shoulder). This was my first experience with this cut. By the time I defatted the large slabs of fat I ended up with about 1 pound of meat for the ragu.

this recipe has been reviewed many times and the reviews vary substantially. I think the biggest problem is sauces tend to vary and there is no precise recipe for a sauce in a recipe like this. We have made this twice. We loved it the first time but thought it a little dry also. The second time we made only 1 lb. of ziti and I made a few adjustments in the sauce: the biggest most important is a high quality can of tomatoes. We used imported plum tomatoes that were already chopped and in their own sauce; saved time and much better. Definitely the imported ones are far superior; we spend the extra money and buy them at a local Italian market. This produced a much bigger quantity of sauce. At first I thought it was too thin, but I simply took the cover off the pot for the second hour. No need for tomatoe paste. We also used a deeper dish for baking; the first time we used the suggested 10 X 15 X 2 but this time we used a 12 X 9 X 3; MUCH better in a deeper dish; covering the dish for part of the baking would also help. We have baked and indulged in many ziti recipes; its a staple in the northeast. We think this one beats them all! I believe we added a little extra pork too. In my mind this is a recipe well worth perfecting; it does freeze well making the sauce ahead of time as discussed in the recipe does make the dish simple.

Unbelievably good. It took me approximatly 3.5 hours to make this but it was well worth it. I used the spicy italian pork sausages and spicy pancetta. 1) Follow all the directions up to the two hour simmering. Before you simmer, add 6 ounces of tomato paste to the ragu stew and stir to dilute. 2)For the pasta, I used one pound of rigatoni instead. Make sure you salt the boiling water and add olive oil before throwing in the pasta. 2) In the buttered casserole dish, add the cooked pasta and HALF of the ragu stew and meat. Add 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese and 1/4 cup of parmesan. Mix everything together. That way, after the baking is done, the mozarella and parmesan is between all the ingredients (big difference!). Add more mozzarella cheese (as much as you want) and then add parmesan cheese as well. Cover with foil and then bake according to the recipe directions. 3)After you're done eating the baked ziti, you'll have the last half of the ragu stew to mix in with another batch of 1 pound of rigatoni for baking. Repeat step #2 after you finish cooking the pasta to be added to the casserole dish.

Well, we were really looking forward to this meal, made it for an early Sunday dinner today. It's ok, but we would not make it again. It is not hard to make, but it is a bit time consuming, and I think we could open a jar of quality sauce, add cooked meat, some cheese, pasta, etc. and it would be at least this good. We also had the spinach salad with oranges and almonds...that was great, and teen sons had seconds (but not so for the pasta).

I have gotten nothing but rave review. I did add provolone and went heavy on the spices. Worth the effor, which was not all that much.

I substituted boneless country-style ribs. They're a lot easier to work with and you can skip the fat removal chore. The second time I made it, a added half of a small can of tomato paste which made the sauce even richer. Also, a pound of ziti is plenty.

This is absolutely wonderful. I have made this twice now, and it was my son's request for his birthday dinner last week. The Rosemary Semolina bread is great with it and worth the work.

I made this dish the very evening I got my monthly issue of Bon Appetit because it looked so appealing. What a disappointment. It was a lot of work for a very average result, and as other reviewers have noted, the ziti completely overpowered the dish. My husband and his brother liked it, but they weren't in the kitchen for two hours (and cleaning up afterwards), and they agreed with my assessment. Although the ragu could be spiced up a bit, there are other recipes out there with similar or better results for less effort. I won't make this again.

In my opinion, this was easy to make. I thought it was good, husband thought it was great. I made a few substitutions. Used "italian" turkey sausage, and boneless pork ribs, because this is what I had on hand. I sauteed the sausage and the pork together to save time. Also, I cheated and used a can of petite diced tomatoes instead of chopping the can of plum tomatoes, again to save time. Worked well and I will make again. This is nice alternative to spaghetti sauce. Very flavorful.

I've made this twice and add tomato sauce while it's simmering. Like others, we prefer it less chunky, more saucy. Also, adding a wedge of parmesan rind while simmering adds flavor and smoothness to the sauce.

It was great! I just cut the pasta down to 1 lb. and used mild sausage. Awesome flavors! It took a while to make-so it makes a great weekend meal. Next time I might cut down on the pork and add more sausage-just personal preference. Highly recommended!

I can't figure out you guys complaining about it being too dry! Is it just the American obsession with drowning things in clingy sauce, or did you do something different than I did? I followed the recipe exactly except that I used only 1 lb. of pasta, and it was FRESH, maybe this makes the difference. It's very meaty and not 'saucey', but I would hardly describe it as dry; it was almost too liquidy until it sat out of the oven and set up a bit. It was a huge hit at my house; hearty and delicious!

This dish was flavorful even without the pork. I used spicy italian sausage and omitted the red pepper flakes, and served it with a salad of spinach, almonds, shaved parmesan and red wine vinaigrett. An easy, flavorful and filling meal.

I have to agree with the Cook From New England. I have not made this recipe, but my brother used it in the tavern/restaurant where he works and he brought a bunch of the leftovers to a party that sunday and it was woefully lacking in sauce. The cover recipe on Bon Appetit looked awesome, but the finished product was not as saucey. So whats everyone's opinion, do you just increase the toms ratio?

I recently made this for a small casual dinner with friends on a cold winter night. The flavors were wonderful, and it was easy to assemble and most of the cooking time is relatively unattended. Once it was combined with the pasta and baked, I was a little disappointed in the lack of sauce. The pasta was rather dry. The flavors were great and the meat was wonderfully tender, but if I make this again I may add more tomatoes and see if I can't work up more of a sauce to coat the pasta.

Panchetta is bacon, as stated. Don't use prosciutto, which is a cured ham. Plain old bacon would be the best sub!!

Rating: 3
Was excited to make this on a Sunday afternoon - but ran around town looking for pancetta and wasted hours - so subsituted prosciutto (and probably lost a layer of flavor). Anyway, after browning all, threw it in the crockpot for 4 hours and came home to a wonderful ragu. Easy to cook the pasta up and slip in the oven for 1/2 hour. Keeper recipe!

This recipe is wonderful!

I used sweet sausage instead of spicy to cater to other people's taste. However, I did use the crushed red pepper flakes. The only thing different I would suggest is to remove the sausage before adding the wine. The wine made the sausage a very unappetizing purple. I will add some good ricotta next time. Lots of fresh grated parmesan is a great addition.

This was pretty good, but lacked something. Decent as a weekend pasta casserole dish, but definitely not worth the effort on a week night if you work.

Rating: 3
There's nothing subtle about this, just a very rich, meeting ragu to bake with your pasta. I thought the recipe worked fine without a single change. The spicyness was moderate to low, a could be increased for those who want a truly hot dish. This was a great dish for my three teenage boys.

This recipe was emailed to me by Epicurious Recipe Flash and I've added it to my recipe file for future use based on the rave reviews. However, to the cook in Pittsburgh, Pa. - who in the heck is Melvin and what does all that gibberish have to do with the Spicy Pork and Sausage Ragu? Was anyone else as confused as I was? Will come back with my rewview after I prepare this dish.

Yo Yo Yo. Not Yo Yo Ma, Paul is back rappin' at ya! This recipe put the agu back in ragu. I loved it so much I made it twice, for me and my girl Gina, it was twice as nice. The pancetta be key so don't substitute, or you'll be down in the chute with a barrel to boot. Ricotta is a mad addition to the baking process and I reccommend it. I'm done with this review so now I'm gonna send it. Peace in the Paullenium! I'm back!!!

Everyone loved this dish. I followed the recipe exactly and found no faults with it at all. The spicyness was perfect and it was a great hit. Will definitely make it again for guests.

I've made this dish twice already and have gotten rave reviews. I didn't have pancetta so I used applewood bacon, and I used an additional 14 oz can of tomatoes. I served the pasta in ramekins and topped each with parmesan and mozzarella. It heats up quicker and everyone loved their own personal-sized dish.

This was wonderful and so easy. I cut back on the tomato juice and had no problems with it being runny. Would highly recommend for a cold winter night supper.

This dish is wonderful.It is worth the preperation. My husband and I love it! I followed the recipe complete except I only used 1lb of Ziti and I added 1 6oz can of tomato paste to thicken the sauce. Nice and spicy!

Rating: 4
For all who commented on the prep time, I have the perfect solution. Follow the recipe as written, and instead of simmering 2 hours, pressure cook for 10 minutes, then reduce sauce slightly 5-10 minutes before mixing with the pasta. Total cook to serve time was about 1 hour 30 minutes. I was skeptical, but it was absolutely delicious. I can't image it tasting better the conventional way. Try it!

Used porc tenderloin and omitted the pancetta so the dish would not be so salty. Very good as a make ahead dish.

I've made this twice already, and served it to rave reviews! Time-consuming, yes, but plan it for a day of puttering around the house. Delicious!!!!

Just take the sauce and pour it over pasta and save a bunch of calories. This is one of those great sauces to make ahead, refrigerate, skim grease and have ready for the whole weekend.

Very delicious, however, I would like to make some changes -- instead of the regular pasta, use low carb pasta to make it more healthy.

This was good but a little salty. A good casserole.

Ditto on the time consuming but worth it - a hit with the 12 people I served it to...I'll have to try making the ragu ahead as reader suggests - not as much pressure day of!

I just started playing with italian dishes, so this was fun. I couldn't find pancetta, so I used precooked ham, chopped very small. It was wonderful. I also altered the recipe some to make this into a lasagne. That was even better, I think...

This was my first time making Ziti and it was fantastic! The combination of the three meats makes it very interesting to eat, especially the pork,which softens and soaks in the flavor of the ragu very well. I couldn't find pancetta at the supermarket, so I used regular bacon instead which didn't have as much flavor and added a lot of fat. There was a lot of grease I had to spoon off in the process of cooking, so don't expect the healthiest of dishes, especially with all that meat.

Rating: 4
Wonderful flavors. I recommend cooking the ziti al dente so it stays firm once it's baked with the ragu. give yourself about 3 hours start to finish. I started at 6pm and had to really hustle to get it on the table by 9pm (i hadn't realized it cooked for 2 hours on the stove)

This is well worth the time and effort to make. Making the ragu several days in advance was a time saver. It is a great dish for a crowd and freezes well

This was awesome.Made it for Sunday dinner and even my kids ate it. I substituted bacon for the pancetta which would have been ok, but the bacon was Hickory smoked and overpowered the other flavors in the dish. Next time I will use the pancetta. I also cut down on the pasta, using only 12 ounces. A KEEPER!

I love to try new receipes and all my friends know it. This proved to be a thumbs up for all! Definitely will prepare again.

I found this to be a wonderful recipe, and have used the ragu over other pastas in addition to making the baked ziti. I use one pound of pasta with half the sauce and add ricotta with the other cheeses for a great creamy texture, which also keeps the pasta from getting dry in the oven. It's perfect to make ahead then bake after a great day of skiing!

Fabulous! I used sweet turkey sausage since my husband hates spicey food, and it was delicious! Have made it twice so far.

This was the best baked ziti we've ever had, hands down. The flavors are robust (be sure you use the freshest, highest quality ingredients for the best results), and it refrigerates and reheats well. It takes a while to make, but well worth it.

Rating: 3
I loved this dish but thought as others did that 1 pound of pasta was more than enough. I thought that adding 2 tablespoons of tomato paste would thicken it a bit. I enjoyed it and will definitely make it again! By the way, I didn't add the pancetta because I thought it would get lost in this recipe. Next time I might add it.

Too much work for such an average tasting dish. Too much pasta for the amount of sauce. There are much better and richer flavored sauces out there. I wouldn't make this again; in fact, I threw most of it out.

Delicious. Didn't have any wine on hand, so used beef broth in its place - came out great. I would use less pasta next time - didn't really need that extra 1/4 pound. Keeps well and reheats fantastically.

I thought this was great. You can definitely taste the red wine in the sauce. We followed the recipe exactly except used sweet sausage so we wouldn't start up my dad's heartburn. My mom is not a big fan of pork but loved this recipe. We'll definitely make this again.

I thought this dish came out very well. I doubled the red peppers and garlic and only used 1 lb of ziti. Much better if you let the sauce sit for a day to develop flavors.

Made this for a cooking group gathering. It was a huge hit. The ragu is very tasty and can be served over spaghetti squash for low-carb diets. I'm going to make a huge batch of the ragu and freeze it for future use.

My husband and I loved this dish. I didn't change anything. I did freeze half of it and that worked very well too. I will definitely make this again. I didn't have a problem with the amount of time it takes to prepare, in fact I thought it went together easily and according to the directions.

Great comfort dish! Used penne instead of ziti. Followed the sauce receipe. Did take a long time to make, but well worth it. Froze half the reciepe (pasta and cheese included before baking) and provided an easy weeknight meal. Family loved it.

This was excellent. I made it exactly as the recipe called for. A wonderful winter-time meal. Make it on a weekend afternoon so you'll have plenty of time to let the pork braise until it is tender. I suspect that those who felt that this was a lot of work were hurried. Relax and enjoy a glass of red wine (or two) as you savor the aroma of the ragu as it cooks!

I thought the sauce was fine -- although a lot of work, as an earlier reviewer pointed out. But the amount of ziti called for was WAY too much in my opinion. It really overwhelmed the dish.
