This is magnificent!!! Do not skip the sesame seeds; they add a complex and delightful flavor. I have particularly enjoyed this with Manchego cheese, goat cheese and Serrano ham. It is also wonderful just with some toast or crackers. Yes, it is just darn good. I found that it took about 30-45 minutes longer to cook down that the recipe said. I also found that the figs i used stayed a bit too chunky for jam. Next time I will cut the figs into eight instead of four pieces.

Delicious. Made a ridiculously enormous batch using a huge stock pot at work. I made it a few times with fresh figs picked off a tree down the street. Once, I did it exactly like the recipe called for with added water and quartering the figs. Then I decided I was too busy to chop figs and wait 2+ hours for the water to boil down, so the next time I didn't bother cutting the figs or adding water and it came out just as good! The figs break down and release all their liquid as they cook. I greatly lessened the sugar both times, used a little honey instead, and threw in some ground ginger at the end. I also pureed it in the blender when it was done. Absolutely amazing on a cheese plate. I recommend with goat cheese, stilton, or manchego!

I made this with muscato vinegar instead of lemon juice and lemon zest. It is delicious. I also used a masher to mash the figs up as they cooked.

This is my second season with the jam, and this year, a triple batch. Figs are brown turkey and Louisiana purple, a beautiful rosy color. Freezes fine. Sesame seeds a must. This makes an incredible addition to a grilled cheese sandwich.

I omitted the water to cut down on cooking time and it came out fine. Just took 30 - 45 minutes rather than two hours. Also, a hint for cutting cost - sesame seeds were $2.52 for a one-ounce box at the discount store. At the natural foods store in bulk they were 50 cents and ounce!

Great preserves, but VERY sweet. It seemed like a lot of sugar, but it's the end of the season, so I ended up picking some semi-ripe figs and thought they might need the sweetness. Wrong. Next time I'll half the sugar and cut the figs up a little more. I love the candied quality, but the chunks were too big, going by the directions.

We made this both with and without the sesame seeds as my husband was skeptical about sesame in his jam. He liked it without and I liked it with (and I'm not a fig fan!) Great for when your fig tree is producing several pounds of fruit a day and your neighbors are avoiding you.

I used 1 cup of sugar and 1/4 cup honey. I didn't have quite the amount of figs called for, so I added 1/2 cup chopped pineapple. I added a cinnamon stick while it simmered. It smelled wonderful and tasted even better! I didn't think the amount of sesame seeds was too much. I appreciated all the suggestions from other reviewers. Next time, I'll add some ginger. This stuff is addictive!

I LOVE this recipe! I have made it 4x's so far. Everyone I know loves it. I have started making it without the sesame seeds and it tastes just as good. A friend eats it straight from the jar!!!

I used Calimyrna figs. They are beautiful, but they seem to have a lot of "pith" - white flesh under the skin. I know that even the skin is edible, and it's not bitter or tough, but I didn't think it belonged in my jam. I got off all the skin and most of the white and it cooked down fine. I added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp ground ginger. I used about 3 tbsp of lemon juice because I didn't have any fresh lemons for zesting, but if I did, I would finely grate the zest and just leave it in after cooking as part of the jam. I wasn't concerned about the number of sesame seeds, but when I went to pour them in, you'd think it was sesame pudding! So I only used 2 tbsp and even that looks like more than show in the photo here. (I had 2 lbs of figs before peeling, so it might have made less jam than the recipe claims - making the sesame out of proportion for me.) Anyway, they are a delicious and required addition. I don't think I'd like this at breakfast because it is like a compote, but it is fabulous on crackers with goat or cream cheese.

I took the advice of the reviewers and added one teaspoon of cinnamon and 2 teaspoons of chopped fresh ginger. I also substituted one tablespoon of orange zest instead of the lemon strips. I doubled the recipe and put half of the cooked jam in the processor for a more spreadable mixture. The other half of the chunky jam was used to spoon into hot crepes which I folded into quarters and then I put a heaping teaspoon of jam on the top of each one. I topped them off with "Orange Honey Syrup" (see recipe file). It was the BEST desert I have ever eaten!

Good, especially with goat cheese. My first time making jam. I am having a hard time trying to find and fish out the strip of lemon zest, though! :O I think the suggestions to add other flavorings would help make this even better.

I had never made jam before so i was anxious about how this would turn out, but it was so easy to make and it came out fabulous. i did add some cinnamon and some ginger and i think it really added alot of flavor to it. The sesame seeds give this jam a nice nutty flavor too.

I love making fig jam as we have a fig tree in our backyard. This particular recipe is awesome! The fresh ginger and lemon zest do make a world of difference and the toasted sesame seeds add a special touch as well.

Great recipe for when your fig tree is overflowing. I added some chinese five spice and it improved the flavor. I thought the sesame seeds were an important ingredient and added to the flavor.

I'd like to try this recipe, but what is the best type of figs to use?

Just made this yesterday and it is delicious! I added a little fresh ginger and cinnamon while it cooked and it's a real winner. Serve with goat cheese and crackers for a great appetizer

I also tried this without sesame seeds and it came out quite well and it's simple to make. I happen to have a fig tree in my back yard so I'm looking for something to use them in and this recipe was perfect. I'll try it with the sesame seeds next time and see how it is.

This recipe made the most delicious jam. I've made probably 20 different varieties of jams over the years and this is in the top 3. I didn't add the sesame seeds, though. There is plenty of crunch with the fig seeds. This jam has the most beautiful pink/magenta color as it cooks. I will make it again! I preserved it in a hot-water bath for 10 minutes for storage on the shelf.

delicious and very simple to make - Add the sesame seeds to taste, a 1/4 Cup may be too many for some people.
