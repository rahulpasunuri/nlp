It's is quite very good but not knock up your socks off. I will say that it did make the house smell fantastic

Too watery and too bland. Won't make again.

I've made better ragu recipes. It was eaten by the whole family without complaint, but unlike with other pasta dishes, my children didn't go back for seconds.

Substituted dried oregano wothout problem.

For the amount of time required to prepare this dish I was expecting MUCH more. Not a bad dish but the end result fell flat. Would not make this again.

We loved this dish! I even substituted Chicken Italian Sausage for the normal Italian Sausage and it was fantastic. Would make it over and over again.

Made this for a dinner party last weekend and it was delicious. The Italian sausage I used gave off a lot of oil but I skimmed it off about halfway through cooking. Added fennel seed to the sauce at the beginning (thanks, 1000 Oaks cook) and sliced mushrooms and sliced black olives at the same time I started boiling water for the pasta. Fantastic. I will definitely make again.

This was amazing! It is very rare that I cook a meal that my picky husband and two children all love. This was it! I didn't cook it for 4 hours, probably closer to 3, but it was still delicious.

This recipe is a winner. Incredibly good with so much flavor and minimal effort required. I followed the directions exactly (except I substituted in turkey sausage because it's what I had on hand) and it came out wonderfully.

This was amazing. I substituted half the pork sausage for spicy Italian chicken sausage and used 3/4 of a lb of ground pork. While cooking the pork and chicken, I used a potato masher to break up the meat which works well. I increased the red pepper flakes to a tsp too, since we like a little more spice. Instead of water, I used a combination of red wine and chicken broth. I continued to alternate chicken broth and red wine when additional liquid was required during the cooking process. As the sauce was cooking down, I added about 1 tbsp of 18 year aged balsamic vinegar too. Plan on tasting the sauce at least once an hour while it is cooking. You will really see how the flavors develop over the four hours and how the meat tenderizes during the cooking process. Just delicious!

This was really so good...making it for the second time today. I agree that the 4 hour simmer is important. Also I used a 1/2 cup water with 1/2 cup dry red wine instead of just water. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. You won't be sorry!

made this yesterday for Valentine's Day and it was awesome! Letting it simmer for hours was key, and the little kick from the red pepper flakes was perfect. This one is a keeper!

I made this the other day and followed directions exactly. I used a pork sausage that wasn't in casing, and it had some fennel in it which I thought added a nice flavor to the dish. I'm sure that it's intended to be a very meaty sauce, so I wasn't surprised by that, but I think next time I make it I'll eliminate some of the ground pork and I will probably as a matter of personal taste, increase the red pepper flakes a bit. Also, I love Italian "gravies" that have the meat minced really small, so I appreciate the reviewer who had lived in Italy's idea of using an immersion blender or mincing the meats after they're cooked. I was personally acquainted with Rose "Pistola" and I watched her cook (obviously not closely enough however) and her gravy was so fantastic, but I could never figure out how she got the meat minced so finely while cooking ground beef. I'm still not sure that she didn't have her butcher grind it for her specially, but the suggestion sounds reasonable! I would say that this also makes way more than for 6 people unless they're BIG eaters...will probably cut the recipe in half the next time; I've got a ton of pasta left over!

Amazing flavor for the whole family. We used chicken sausage by Isernios (great and low in fat) and had our butcher grind some pork butt. We only cooked it for an hour or so and it was delicious!

Made for friends and my husband tonight. Everyone loved it, it did seem as though the meat was going to be too much for the 1 lb of pasta but I felt when it all came together that it was just right. I made it exactly as the recipe stated but for a touch more crushed red pepper, salting to taste. I had started out with really fantastic butcher made hot Italian sausage plus the ground pork, after draining it on paper towels when sautéing the veggies, I thought the resulting sauce was not too oily at all. Rather just perfect. I will be making this again, The 4h simmer was worth the time spent.

We really liked this. Followed the recipe exactly including cooking time. Turned out great. Will make again. Thx

This was great. Agree with the other reviewer that it's a bit too much meat. I cut it down and ended up using about 1.25 total pounds of meat, and it was still well-proportioned. Instead of adding water to the sauce, I added red wine, which I think helped boost the flavor. I also added a little fennel seed. Woudl definitely make again.

Really good & flavorful. First time making a Ragu & didn't know what to expect. Substituted ground turkey and hot turkey saugage for pork, added a splash of cooking sherry. Didn't need to simmer for the full 4 hours. Will make again.

Rating: 3
Really good, but don't skimp on the time, because it needed lots of cooking to really develop its flavor. I added about a cup of red wine, and if I did it again I might skip the water that goes in after the meat and tomato -- which seemed odd -- in favor of either chicken broth or just wine.

Why I feel I can write a review: I lived in Italy for half a year. Over the last 35 years we go there almost annually. I took a 7 day cooking course in Bologna. Riagu' is a meat sauce with tomato, not a tomato sauce with meat. Regarding proportions, I agree that sauced lightly this is enough for ten servings. I made it as written except I took my immersion blender to it as I couldn't get the bloody sausage to break up finely. Traditionally the meat is cooked, then minced, but I doubt that's often done nowadays. As to the oil, it's full of flavor, so sauce it lightly but don't remove the fat, in my opinion. The sauce should be cooked until it's just meat and oil, without water, using pasta water as needed to loosen it slightly. With that lengthy intro, we loved it!

An instant classic! It was a huge hit at pre-Super Bowl dinner, after making the house smell heavenly all day. I used 1/2 pound ground pork and 1.5 pounds sausage (part hot, part sweet) and whole wheat penne, otherwise exactly as written. It was absolutely delicious!! Definitely use the best Italian sausage available for this one. I'll be making this again and again!

Good but not worth four hours of cooking. Nothing special

Rating: 2
This smells outrageous while it's cooking. However, it is disappointingly mediocre. A lot like an upgrade of the macaroni and beef casserole we all ate as kids. It also makes a TON. Which in this case is not so good. I hoped people would ask for the leftovers, but sorry no takers. Made precisely as written.:(

This was a great recipe but it actually had too much meat in it. Next time I will make it with the one pound of sweet sausage for flavor but cut back the ground pork to 1/2 pound. I think that will make it perfect.

I thought this was terrific. I don't know if the sausage puts out enough grease to fry without the olive oil but we did skim off about a 1/2 cup of grease after it cooked.My concern was not the olive oil but the fat from the pork. The cooking time allows the sausage to soften and eliminates the big clumps of sausage. I tasted it often while cooking and it gotbetter with time. I did add mushrooms the last 20 minutes of cooking. I will defintely make again.

Skimmed fat off after letting sauce cool a bit...pork sausage puts out quite a bit of fat so I didn't need to use as much olive oil as the recipe stated. Be careful not to overdilute the sauce with pasta water at the end. And taste the sauce as you simmer it...add more herbs/chili as needed. Great sauce....pretty heavy if you eat too much of it, but very tasty :-)

Delicious. As I often do, I failed to thoroughly read the recipe and didn't realize it needed to simmer for 4 hours until I got to that step -at 7pm - but staying up to finish it was well worth it. Would be a great dish for a dinner party. I cooked uncovered and didn't have a negative result with the olive oil and fat from the pork.

Really Delicious! I agree that making it the day before is a great idea! Perfect comfort food.

Plan to make tonight....looks good, but 4 hrs to tenderize ground pork & sausage? How's that?

Great sauce. I used fennel sausage and added a little chopped fennel bulb which I had on hand. Lovely this way too.

I'm cooking the ragu right now and it smells great. Only issue with the recipe is the ingredients call for 1/4 cup of olive oil, but there is no mention of using this olive oil in the recipe instructions. Given the fat from the sausage and ground pork, I don't think it to be necessary. Thoughts?

Did you cook for 4 hours covered or uncovered?

Great recipe! Although time consuming (suggest making the ragu the day before), very easy to make. I added several cups of water during the 4 hour simmering process. Rigatoni is a good pasta choice (better than penne) for this dish. Enjoy . . .

Initially this was a little bland, so I doubled the oregano and added a tsp of red pepper flakes. Came out quite tasty - my picky husband and kids ate every bite!

Although I have not eaten this yet as I just got done cooking the sauce, it was quite good as I taste-tested as I went along. I don't not eat pasta as I'm not a fan of red or meat sauce, but I may have to have this for a meal. I will definitely cut down the amount of pork that the veggies are cooked in to no more than a tbsp as the sauce is quite oily.

Yummy! Served to some friends for dinner then fed the leftovers to the children the next day. Everyone loved this...

Just had this for Sunday dinner. Worth the long cooking time, rich and hearty flavor. Will be making this again. Perfect ratio of sauce to pasta. Used sweet sausage may try mixture of hot and sweet next time.

This is a wonderful and hearty dish for a January evening. With a couple of exceptions, I followed the recipe to a T. I did not have ground pork on hand, so I did without it. I used three links of hot Italian sausage and 2 links mild, so I think it was a pound total of sausage. I had a small leftover chicken breast, and chopped it up and added it in. I did not miss the extra pork. This is a very lovely, rich dish--the addition of the parmesan and pasta water at the end brings it to a lovely finish. This is a keeper.

I'm making this right now and it smells fantastic. I tried a bit and the flavor blew me away. It was pretty easy to prepare and I'm looking forward to eating it.
