After reading the reviews I decided to punch it up a bit. I used a variety of dried wild mushrooms, lemon grass, lots of ginger in big chunks and szechuan peppercorns. After steeping the mushrooms; drained, rinsed and chopped (strained the broth) added the extra ingredients into the broth and simmered so the flavors meld & deepen. Extracted the lemon grass, ginger and peppercorms; added tofu & thickening sauce. Great soup. Reminds me of my fav chinese restaurant. Only gave 2 forks because it appears to be a starting base.

Oops. Meant to say I substituted fresh shiitake b/c I couldn't find dried.

I love this recipe, but I also add a couple ingredients. I skip the bean thread noodles. I add some red bell pepper and shiitake mushrooms. I think I've put scallions on top too..

BF and I liked this recipe. I made a few minor changes. Used sauteed button mushrooms as we didn't have dried shiitake mushrooms. Added a small amount of lemon grass to the fresh ginger then minced together in a processor. Added one thinly sliced green onion. Used Trader Joe's organic free range chicken broth which has a bit of body and richer flavor than canned. Also sprinkled in a bit of Furikake blend as we had it on hand. Next time might add a few sliced water chestnuts for crunch.

Don't be fooled by the 3 1/2 forks rating. Many good ratings were given by cooks who doctored this into something else. This is bland and imbalanced with far too many shitakes.

I give this recipe 4 forks because it is too easy to be this good. Instead of measuring out the ingredients, I recommend slowly adding ingredients to your personal taste. I used chicken better than bouillon to have control of the salt content. I like to skip the noodles, add extra ginger (grated not chopped), and a couple frozen shumai (chicken or shrimp) per bowl. Sometimes I add uncooked celery to each bowl for crunch.

I tried salvaging this one by following a few of the suggestions below. Both I and my girlfriend like hot and sour soups, but we found this recipe to be simply unappetizing. A real waste, but at least the recipe wasn't a huge investment in terms of time.

I really liked this soup. The flavor was perfect. It needed a little bit more broth, and the mushrooms need to soak longer than 20 mins. but other than that it's perfect!

I added bamboo shoots and it was better!

With a few minor adjustments this was delicious. I used 6 cups of veg. stock (and could have done 7) 2 tbls. hot chili oil instead of the pepper flakes and added the juice from two limes. Turned out both yummy and hearty. Would definitely make it again.

great dish. the easy trick to getting a good flavor is to use the standard Knorr chicken cubes, rather than blandish canned. chicken broth

I was looking for a sinus clearing soup because both my husband and I have colds. This recipe needs a LOT of work, it was very disapointing. The recipe as is, is bland and too sour.

Rating: 3
My partner is a big hot and sour soup, and I found this recipe rather than order in again. The only substitution I made on purpose was to use chili paper saauce (the hot, Asian kind) instead of the dried red pepper flakes. A substitution I made out of necessity, given what was available in my local shop, was to use a tofu in a Szechuan saauce, rather than plain tofu. I'd probably add more chili sauce next time to compensate. In general, I didn't think the recipe needed any changes.

Rating: 2
I would make this again, but would ABSOLUTELY increase the amount of ginger and crushed red pepper. I also would recommend adding bamboo shoots and water chestnuts. And leave out the corn starch... corn starch always gives this soup kind of a gelatinous quality... I think it's much better with a thin broth. Other good additions would include straw mushrooms and lemongrass.

Rating: 3
Something is missing, but you can fix that by adding 1/2 to 1 Tablespoon of lemon juice (for a more Chinese flavor) or lime juice (for a more Thai flavor). And always leave out the pasta/bean thread noodles since they distract from the flavor and make the soup too thick. To simplify this down to a 10-minute recipe with little loss of flavor, substitute 4 c. water and boullion cubes for the broth, fresh mushrooms instead of dried (there's only a slight flavor change if you use white mushrooms instead of cremini), and don't worry about saute-ing the ginger (although this lessens its impact slightly). Then just heat the water to a boil, throw everything into the pot, and let it simmer for 5 minutes before adding the vinegar/corn startch and lemon or lime juice. In a pinch, you can also substitute powdered ginger instead of fresh. I first discovered this recipe 4 years ago and have been making variations on it regularly ever since. It's well worth trying.

Sort of interesting but too much work for what it turns out to be. Not bad, just strange.

I love this soup beyond compare. I make it close to the recipe, but usually up the garlic and ginger, and add a splash of hot fire oil. I've served this at my restaurant with good reviews. For the noodles, just break open a pack of ramen and use that and toss the spice packet. And I make about 8 cups of soup, so I do add a bit more broth, but it's always excellent and can cure any cold and drain your sinuses. It's my favorite soup.

One of my favorite soups in the WORLD is hot & sour, and since this seemed the favorite recipe on the site, I thought I'd give it a try. Maybe I started out with my expectations too high - kinda like when you see a movie AFTER everyone tells you how good it is, but I found this soup disappointing. It had a very strong sour/lemony taste, even though I didn't add any lemon (maybe an overdose of ginger and vinegar?). Anyway, I'm glad I didn't add more broth cause I was happy to have vegetables & tofu to kill the sour taste a little. My roommates said they liked it, but you can never tell when someone's being honest, or is just excited you cooked for them!

It was great. I made it with Vegetable stock instead of chicken stock because I am a vegetarian. It was very good and I loved it.

WoooooHooooo! I took the advise of one cook and used cabbage instead of noodles! I don't know if it was the cabbage or the tofu, but talk about fart city! I was a good soup, but the aftermath was enough to set off a satelite! Take some advise from me, use beano! Other than that, it's a great tasting soup.

Rating: 3
I was hesitant to follow the recipe exactly because of other people's reviews... but this ended up being really good! I agree with most people that 4 cups broth isn't enough. You need more like 6+ cans if you want it to be soupy. And I only used 1 tsp cornstarch with 3 Tbsp vinegar. 2 Tbsp cornstarch would definitely be too much. My boyfriend hates mushrooms and tofu so I threw in matchstick carrots, Thai rice noodles (which I thought were a great addition)and slivers of boiled chicken. I used all 3 Tbsp ginger and loved the flavor. I used the recommendation of others and went with chili garlic paste not pepper flakes. This really turned out just the way I wanted it. Highly recommended & fun to play with.

Rating: 2
I thought this soup had a good flavor but definitely needed some changes. The only thing i added was a whipped egg at the end which made it look more like restraunt style and doubled the broth. I wish i had added chopped green onions for flavor and to give it some color. I added the noodles and was glad i did because they added bulk. I still don't know how i feel about the mushrooms..maybe too many? Maybe i didn't chop them fine enough. I'll reply later if i can pinpoint that problem. Otherwise, good soup but listen to the advice of others on this one!!

i made the base as written and had to take license with the soup ingredients. i slivered wood ears, carrots, baby corn bok choy and scallions. left out the noodles, and added a large clove of garlic with the ginger. i thought this was very tasty, good texture, and decent balance. next time, the beaten egg suggestion sounds good. and i may do the broth the day before and strain out the ginger pieces before adding the veg, just to see how that is. all in all good recipe with potential for tweaking.

Rating: 3
This recipe was delicious and easy - and a perfect antidote after a night of New Year's Eve carousing! I wish I had heeded the advice of others and omitted the noodles - they were the worst part. Next time, I'll added shredded cabbage, scallions, a lot of chili paste, and take out the tofu and noodles, making it more of a vegetable soup. And definitely use fresh mushrooms.

Rating: 4
Definately read some of the other tips for adjusting the recipe. Woodear mushrooms work great, forget the noodles, up the soy and cornstarch, and if you can find it, Nakano makes a great seasoned red pepper rice vinager. Use 6 cups veggie broth instead of 4. It's a great dish, by far the best veggie hot and sour soup I've ever had. I liked the ginger, and the guests I served it to that don't like ginger didn't mind.

Rating: 1
I knew what I was getting into with this recipe but just did not find the ginger a satisfying element in this dish (however, my husband found the soup satisfying and hearty). As I ate it I imagined how much better a healthy dose of garlic would have tasted. No repeats in this house!

After 3 times I finally got this recipe just perfect. My changes: increase broth to 6 c. and use vegetable, substitute Woodear mushrooms for more traditional soup, decrease vinegar to 4TBS, increase cornstarch to 3 TBS, increase sesame oil to 3 TBS, skip the noodles, increase soy sauce to 3 TBS, substitute sambal oelek (ground fresh chili paste) for the red peppers (I usually add more at the table). The first time I followed the recipe exactly and found it bland, but good enough to work with. Now it's restaurant quality, I think.

A little too vinagary (and I love vinegar). I would definitly make it again but I'd either decrease the vinegar or increase the sugar

This was surprisingly good for such an easy recipe. Although its not exactly like the restaurant version around here, I was delighted with how it turned out. I added a bit of beef broth and a bit more soy sauce to deepen the flavor and color. I skipped the noodles. I would like to add a bit of seaweed next time since that is a standard addition in most restaurant versions in Montreal.

Overall good taste, but next time I will add 1 tlbsp less Ginger, more soy sauce and add cornstarch to taste. Also made it with leftover pork dumpling meat filling that I sautéed in a wok and added to soup. That gave it a good flavor...

Excellent soup! I have used this recipe several times with vegetable broth, and find it the tastiest. I tend to add more broth.

Rating: 4
great easy soup! my only problem was that i wound up adding nearly 3x as much soy sauce as the recipe called for -- next time i think i'll use regular veg broth instead of low-sodium and see if that helps. as other people suggested, i added a beaten egg at the end, as well as dried lily buds and bean curd stick. next time i might throw in some sliced scallions as well. oh, and i too added extra broth to balance all the millions of ingredients i added! (this might also be partly why i needed the extra soy sauce, i suppose.)

Very tasty and easy. Substituted fresh Shitakes that were sauteed in Grape Seed Oil and added to the broth instead of dried mushrooms. Also used Cayenne pepper instead of dried. Served it with chilled Sake.

ok. because i eat hot and sour from takeout at least once a week, i know that hot and sour is SUPPOSED to be very thick. what's the point of hot and sour if it's the consistency of campbells vegetable soup? BORING. so, do not decrease the cornstarch or add broth. the ratio here is actually quite nice. i used half shitake and half woodear mushrooms, and added two beaten eggs near the end to make nice "egg flowers". i did omit the noodles. this is as good as any restaraunt and maybe even better because of the ginger.

I thought this soup turned out fantastic, and I am glad I followed the previous reviewers suggestions: more broth, less cornstarch, sub chile/garlic paste, add greens for color. I added the lemon, but my husband thought it tasted more thai then, but it definitely needed that for some kick. Would make this over and over...thanks!

Rating: 4
With a few modifications this is the best, and easiest, hot & sour soup around. The amount of broth is ridiculously low. You could easily double the broth and use the same amount of tofu and mushrooms. The noodles are a bad idea, skip them. Cut back on the cornstarch, one Tbsp. works. Too avoid a purely brown concoction, throw in some frozen peas for color, they really add to the presentation. I also added sliced bamboo shoots which was a nice touch.

This soup has become a standard in our household for its healing properties. The ginger, shiitake, tofu, chicken stock and chilies are all tonics for an ailing body, particularly helpful for colds and flu. Also, it is extremely delicious if adjustments are made. I increase the broth to 6 cups, which thins the consistency. I substitute 4 oz. sauteed fresh shiitakes, use 5 tbsp ginger, add the juice of 1 lemon, and use chili paste instead of dried flakes. You may want to try cooked, minced chicken if you're not a tofu fan. Garnish with plenty of chopped cilantro and a thin slice of lemon.

Nice flavor, awful consistency and appearance. The reviewer who said add more stock was right: but how much more? I poured in an additional cup-and-a-half, and still there was too much tofu and too many mushrooms. It didn't come out like a soup at all; more like the porridge the other reviewer described. Again, though: good flavor.

I've used several recipes from this site but I have never shared my opinion until now. This soup was so horrible to the nth degree. I'm assuming I did something wrong, but I really didn't think so. The flavour was awful, the broth worse. I'm used to the hot and sour soup from Manchu Wok in Toronto and this was nothing even remotely like it.

Made these changes and it was excellent. Used woodear mushrooms (more authentic), 2 pkgs of chicken ramen with the flovor packs, just added ginger to broth and subed the red pepper for 1 tsp of black pepper (also more authentic). Sesame oil s/b added just b4 serving, if at all, as it looses flavor if heated.

I gave this recipe almost 3 forks and my companion gave it "one fork plus two fork tines" I guess that averages out to two forks. I haven't yet looked but there are probably better recipes for hot and sour soup out there. The cornstarch in this made it a little thick and not as "clean" tasting as I would like.

I would make this recipe again b/c I love Hot & Sour soup and it is really so easy, BUT I found that eating it "the next day" is not ideal. It seemed very oily. Also, I might try adding a bit more soy sauce next time for added flavor. The shiitake mushrooms are a MUST in this soup.

We made this soup for a dinner club who was celebrating the Chinese New Year. It was delicious...not your ordinary Hot & Sour Soup. If you like lots of broth, decrease the amount of mushrooms and tofu OR increase the amount of chicken stock. Cliantro or julienne scallions add a nice touch of color as a garnish.

This is great because it takes two seconds to make. This is one of the only soups that I will make just for myself (I don't like to cook for myself, alone). I leave out the noodles and add garlic/chili paste instead of crushed red pep. Also, I use a bit less vinegar, and I add a squeeze of lemon at the end. Quite good.

A wonderful soup for recovering from a cold. I couldn't smell or taste much of anything, but I did get the heat of the ginger. I made this with my mom, and she suggests using less of the ginger, and maybe grating instead of mincing so there's less crunch.

This is a great recipe--flavorful, fast, and easy. I left out the tofu because I'm not such a big fan of it, but I found that the mushrooms and noodles added plenty of hardiness. I served it as a first course to the Marinated Tempeh Stirfry with Broccoli and Red Bell Pepper, and it was the soup that got the rave reviews!

Rating: 4
Wonderful soup!! This is honestly great! Since other raters suggested that the soup might be too thick I used only a little over 1 Tbsp of cornstarch instead of 2 and it came out perfect!! I chopped my ginger very fine and left the wonderful crunchy little bits in for great ginger bursts of flavor when bitten into. I only had 1/2 ounce of the dried mushrooms, but this seemed to be plenty. This was a very easy, very healthy soup to make and is sure to be a regular in our house from now on. Everyone in my family loved it including both my daughters ages 9 and 21...... We all love tofu so we used that as called for, but might try a few small shrimp along with it next time for a change!

I like the soup, but I think there's TOO much vinegar. Next time I'll use only half the amount, and the rest water to mix with the corn starch. And maybe add more red pepper! Also, I think I'll chop the ginger into bigger pieces so I can strain it out easily once the boil begins. I LOVE chunks of ginger, but the rest of my family thinks its WAY too strong to bite into, in the soup. Otherwise, this recipe looks, smells and tastes GREAT!! Very healthy! I add a little miso dissolved in water once the heat is off, for an extra health benefit and for a little different taste. I've added a FEW chopped collards to the boil on occasion. Good to eat when you feel a cold coming on!
