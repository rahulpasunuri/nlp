Awesome recipe. I have used other types of white fish and they work well. This presents very well and the flavors merge perfectly. A presentation tip; serve both sauces on top of the fish angled at each end with some swirled on plate.

P.S. Try using wasabi paste from a tube instead of the powder with water. Experiment between how much wasabi and yogurt (or sour cream)....it's a fabulous sauce.

Loved this. Used greek yogurt instead of sour cream. Definitely making again. However, next time I'll just bake the fish without searing first. Mine stuck to the pan.:( [Try the wasabi cream to replace the cream cheese in an updated version of bagels, lox and cream cheese. Another winner.]

I have made this recipe a few times, and it has always been a company pleaser. It's great visually if you prepare it with care. The wasabi cream is good texture and flavor with the halibut and compliments the Sambal Vinaigrette. I would highly reccomend this dish to any sea food lover.

I rarely take the time to review recipes, but this one is so EASY, and so DELICIOUS, that i had to add my two cents. I make it per the recipe, although you can substitute other white fish such as Maui Maui and it is equally good. Jasmine rice and salad and you have an easy weeknight meal!!

great, easy recipe. I made the simple substitution of sriracha for the sambal oelek. To lighten the dish up, I used greek yogurt in place of the sour cream.

Excellent dish....both sauces are great. Added ground ginger to the Sambal and used less sour cream and a splash of rice wine vinegar in the Wasabi. Served with steamed bok choy and snow peas.

Excellent combination of flavors. Easy to prepare. Quick from start to finish. A great time-saving meal for which you can pick up the ingredients on the way home. And the real payoff  tastes incredible. To the cook who tossed the wasabi/cream sauce away after tasting it, you did yourself a disservice by not trying it with the finished dish. I too, tried it beforehand and thought, This doesnt do much for me. However, upon tasting it with the fish and sambal vinaigrette, I was pleasantly surprised how well they worked together. Like another reviewer, I added a little sweetness to the vinaigrette with a touch of brown sugar and honey and agree that this makes the sauce even more intriguing. As far as another reviewer saying that they know Asian flavors, and this is just not it, perhaps they were expecting something else because nowhere does the recipe describe this as an Asian dish. So while this may not be what you are looking for your next Asian dinner party, it is very much worth a go, because it is truly incredible. I will be keeping this in my file to be used again.

Rating: 4
Great tasting and easy to make. I made slight modifications like adding sesame oil, a little kimchee brine to brighten it and honey It was great before but even better with a little sweetness and acidity. Other than that everything was made exactly the same and when the flavors were combined it turned out amazing. Oh, I did use the asian avocado and corn salsa like one of the readers suggested and it was also great. Enjoy.

The Sambal sauce was very good (I used less oil though, like 2/3. The wasabi sauce was not good at all. I tasted it before serving it on the table and did not like it. It went down the drain. The Halibut with the Sambal is very good

This recipe has become a mainstay in our house over the past 9 years since I first saw it in Gourmet. To cut calories a touch, we use plain yogurt in place of the sour cream - then we can use more wasabi "cream"! It always impresses company!

What a fantastic recipe. My husband caught halibut on a fishing trip to Alaska last July and we've been trying all sorts of recipes and this is now our favorite. I did not have sour cream so I used Greek Yogurt from Trader Joe's and it was perfect. We are going to try the wasabi cream on prime rib next. The Sambal vinaigrette was awesome. I used the sambal that has shrimp paste in it, very good. I served it with sticky rice...very, very good.

YUCK!! Pls do NOT make this. If I can give 0 forks, I would. I am very familiar w/ asian flavors and this was just not it. The vinigarette and the wasabi sour cream had absolutely no depth of flavor and did not go well together. The only saving grace was the parsely encrusted fish which made a decent presentation.

I made this for a small dinner party. I used very fresh, thick halibut. This is a wonderful recipe. I even noticed my usually refined friend lick her plate when she thought no one was looking. Too funny! I used cilantro instead of parsley. But since cilantro can get bitter when over cooked -I put it on top of the halibut when it came out of the oven then quickly turned the cilantro side over to sear for about 15 secs. Worked great! For a side dish I served Summer fruit salad with fresh minted sugar!! The halibut is expensive but nice for the very occasional meal.

This was nice and and surprising. With the ingredients on hand, it came together quickly. (Just happened to pick up new jar of sambal last weekend.) We halved for two, and subbed Basa Bocourti for the halibut. Basa does not handle as nicely but is 1/5 the price and very good. Next time I would not halve the sauces, as they were also good with the rice alongside.

This is awesome. Sauces were to die for. I didn't have sambal olek on hand, but used sirracha sauce and it was fine. I usually have to cook fish longer than most recipes call for, as was the case here.

The recipe is a good one and easy to make. Due to my diet, I usually do not cook with a lot of oil, so I baked the halibut for 5 minutes. For the sambal vinagrette sauce I added all ingredients except the vegetable oil. For the oil I drizzled in a bit of canola oil and it was fine.

this was fabulous and easy. I added scallions on top and didn't have pickled ginger so I added some fresh ginger juice to the vinegar sauce. I also had to sub red pepper sauce + cayenne for the special chile sauce I didn't have, but everyone loved it. Can't wait to get the exact ingredients and make it again, if it was so good with all these substitutions.

This recipe is fantastic! I make it on a weekly basis. My family loves the taste of the seared halibut combined with the parsely. The sauces are great and I whisk them up for uses in other dishes. To save time, I also use my indoor grill to cook the fish. I have made it both ways, and each taste just as good. The sauces have quite a kick. Definitely a staple in our home.

Fantastic recipe. I would recommend serving this dish in a bowl with mashed potatoes and some baby bok choy cooked in a chicken or vegetable broth added to the additional sauce. This makes a fantastic presentation and well rounded meal. Do not over cook the halibut and this is quite good with Chilean sea bass as well.

Needed a quick dinner for company using the fresh halibut my husband brought back from Alaska. This was really quick and easy, and the two sauces were delicious and looked impressive swirled together on the plate. I bought pickled ginger but forgot it in the 'fridge. Ooops.

This dish was super quick and easy to make, and delicious. For the sauce, I used only 1/4 c oil and I used the Asian chile sauce I had on hand--the red pepper sauce used in Pho. I also just used a prepared wasabi cream instead of making the recipe, which was still very yummy. The only other change that I made was that I used cilantro instead of parsley.

I make these sauces all the time with a sesame seeded ahi tuna steak that is seared rare and sliced with the sauces over. I do cut back on the amount of oil used in the Sabal. When I made it to use on the Halibut, I used Cilantro rather then parsly on the fish, but then I like Cilantro and some may not.

Excellent and easy! I oiled the fish rather than the iron skillet on a gas grill. The fish was 1.5" thick and took 6 min. per side to cook at our altitude on med. heat (after the initial high heat to prep the skillet). The fish had a nice seared crust! I added the cilantro at the table with the sauces. Did not have sour cream, so stick blended cottage cheese with lime juice, a little buttermilk powder and extra wasabi....it made a nice substitute (higher protein, lower fat). Also followed previous suggestion of decreasing mustard and oil and increased sambal oleck. DELICIOUS!

My boyfriend made this for me for Valentine's Day, and it was fantastic. The wasabi cream sauce is nice and light, and goes really well with the fish.

He didn't change the recipe at all - great as is (except he couldn't find the asian chile sauce, so he used a thai chile sauce).

I second the use of cilantro instead of parsley. That definitely adds to the asian influence. I didn't have powdered wasabi, so I substituted sake-wasabi mustard (odd that I DID have that) and made both sauces into one. I also didn't have sambal oelek, which I would use next time instead of the Louisiana hot sauce (!!) I did spike the sauce with. Despite these changes, it was yummy! Next time I'll have it with the recommended Gewurtztraminer or Chablis.

Oh My what a fabulous recipe/dinner. Taking others advice for the vinaigrette I reduced the amount of mustard to 1 tsp. and the vegetable oil to 1/4 cup - wonderful. For the wasabi cream I omitted the water and for the halibut I used cilantro instead of parsley. Simple corrections with fantastic results. I served this with Jasmine rice and Braised Bok Choy - a company worthy dinner that is quick and simple to prepare.

Rating: 1
This recipe caught my eye because I love both wasabi and any kind of chili sauce. Halibut turned out fine--tender, flaky--but the sauces were extremely disappointing. Horribly bland. Wasabi didn't balance with the sour cream at all and chili flavor was nearly non-existant. Maybe next time I'll add the sambal oil to the fish in the skillet instead of putting it in a separate sauce. As for the wasabi, it would have been much better in a orange ginger wasabi glaze. Try something else!

Rating: 3
Very tasty, very easy and beautiful presentation! I agree that the water is not needed in the wasabi cream, the mix of sour cream and wasabi powder was just fine. The cream did soften a bit when set on top of the hot fish. But I added some young ginger slices that I picked up at the sushi counter and it looked great ! I have also tried this with salmon, that worked well.

My husband and I both enjoyed this - the halibut was cooked just perfectly (don't know where you get 1.5" thick filets, mine were an inch thick and 4 minutes in the oven was just right!). At first, I was a bit disappointed - expected stronger flavors from the sauces - but hubby pointed it out that they were perfect for the fish, did not overpower the delicate flavor. I used wasabi in a tube instead of powder and it wasn't as colorful as the picture. Will definitely make this again!

This was absolutely fabulous. Easy, tasty, yum! I was still talking about this meal two days later and have printed it for friends. I made it exactly how it is written. However, reading the other reviews, I can agree that it is probably best to not use the powdered wasabi OR omit the water as there is enough liquid properties in the sour cream to make the paste.

Absolutely delicious AND easy...I rubbed some of the sambal vinaigrette on the fish pieces also before cooking...sort of a marinade for about 1/2 hour...both sauces are excellent! Beautiful colors too...the sambal sauce was sort of orangey and the wasabi sauce was pale green...thanks EPI!!!

I love these sauces in tandem (though I prefer to leave out the mustard). I've made it as stated, but I've also made it as an hors d'oeuvres by marinating halibut cubes in the sambal vin, pan searing then piping the wasabi cream over, and I've served them as dipping sauces for halibut tempura at football tailgates. It's always a hit and it couldn't be easier. I don't bother with the blender, whisking the vinaigrette works fine.

I changed a few small things. I made a pan seared halibut on top of fried wonton strips topped with blue crab dress with the sambol vin. Squeezed the wasabi cream wich i just used sour cream, lemon juice, salt, and half & half till I recieved the consitancy desired. I really enjoyed it.

I had to use half and half and lemon instead of sour cream; the sauce needed to stand to develop. Loved this recipe for the sauces which could be good with any white fish. The parsley sauté and finishing the fish in the oven was also a really good idea.

I was a bit sceptical when reading this recipe, but it was sooooo good! The flavors of the sauces were so complementary to each other and the fish.

FABULOUS!!!! This dish was a breeze and the result was something that looked like about $18.95 in nice restaurant. The beauty of this recipe is that you can make most of it ahead of time. By the time our dinner guest had arrived, I'd already prepared the vinaigrette and wasabi cream and both were sitting in the fridge. To accompany the fish, I chose new potatoes and asparagus which I steamed ahead of time as well. After 2 minutes in the microwave, they were warm and ready to hit the plate. I just poured a bit of butter lemon sauce over the vegetables and sprinkled with pepper. The vinaigrette travels around the plate and mixed wonderfully with the vegetables. Wonderful dish. We all enjoyed it immensely and looking at the plate, it looked as though I'd put a ton of work into it. Leave the fish in the full five minutes or even six. I also spread a little bit of olive oil around the rim of the plate and dusted it with Paprika for presentation. Thanks for the great recipe! I'll be making it again for sure.

Is this a "dish beyond compare?" It is when you consider the ease of preparation. I added more of the sambal oelek [chili paste] but otherwise followed the directions. At another rater's suggestion, on top of the sauces, I placed "baby bok choy" cooked according to its recipe but did not carry any extra sauce over to this dish [see "baby bok choy" recipe - simmered in chicken stock and butter with sesame oil], placing halibut on top....very delicious and an added layer of texture and flavor.

Delicious and impressive, given how easy it is to make! The flavors are awesome. First off, try hard to find sambal oelek; I found mine in world food market. I can't imagine what the vinagrette would be like with a substitute, it adds so much flavor and zest. I grilled my halibut steak, which I think added some flavor dimension to the sauces, too. I had enough sauce left over that I served it with a seared tuna steak last night. AWESOME! I will try it with salmon as well. A keeper for sure!

Wonderful! The halibut, normally dry when cooked, retained its moisture and was succulent. The second time I made this I added 1/8 teaspoon coconut flavoring to the wasabi cream and used cilantro in place of the parsley. Truly a dish to die for. I'll make this again and again.

My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this dish. While making the sauces for the halibut, I decided that they both needed a little help. Although the ingredients yeilded a pleasant flavor, we felt that the flavor was lacking slightly. Rather than adding salt to each as called for, I added some soy sauce. I also added a lot more wasabe and sambal than called for, as we "like it hot!" This complimented both sauces and made them taste great!! We would definitely make this dish again. It was excellent. By the way, for the person who asked "where to find sambal," you can find it at the nearest Oriental food market. It took me all day to track it down.

In a couple of weeks I will be entertaining a good friend and her very talanted chef-husband, and I am considering this dish as the main course. When I made this for my husband and myself, I did a quick braise of baby bok choy and made a salad with a sesame-soy vinaigrette. It's pretty unusual to find something so impressive that requires so little effort.

I have lived in the Northwest all of my life and have eaten a lot of different fish recipes and this is by FAR the best recipe I have ever tasted.

We made this with halibut filets. I used less then 1/4 C of oil in the vinaigrette and I added a dash of asian hot oil and sesame oil and a couple shakes of toasted sesame seeds. For the wasabi cream instead of water I used 2TBL vermouth 1TBL capers and 1TBL fresh lemon juice. I also added fresh dill with the fresh parsley. This turned out wonderful. I think the 1/3c oil would have been way to much. The added flavor of the hot oil and sesame was really good. I think the wasabi cream was very good and not so boring with the subsitute for water.

What's great about this dish is that it's: Easy, makes a wonderful presentation-visual impression and it tastes great.

After preparing one of your recipes the previous day that took me 2 1/2 hours, this recipe was a real treat! Notwithstanding the supreme taste, this dish is easy to prepare. I was pleased with all aspects: artfully elegant on a plate, simple and quick to prepare, great tasting, and healthy. I loved the idea of searing the Halibut in the iron skillet on the stove top and then moving the skillet and all right into the oven. The Sambal Vinaigrette is truly wonderful. However, I must confess what caught my eye and made me prepare this dish was the Wasabi Cream. But I must say we enjoyed the Sambal Vinaigrette more. The Wasabi Cream needs some tweeking. Surprisingly the Wasabi Cream was weaker in taste than the Sambal Vinaigrette. I'm not giving up on the Wasabi Cream sauce - I'm going to experiment. That's the fun of cooking - creating. Also, just to let you know I used fresh Halibut fillets- not steaks. By the way, it was nice to use my iron skillets - but where can I learn how to take care of them?

What a fabulous dish -- and easy, too! We're having it again tonight.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. It is a very attractive dish. I made it as per the recipe the first time. The second time I omitted the wasabi cream and just made the vinaigrette.

Very Tasty and Interesting my husband said, I thought it was pretty good myself, although not as good as I thought it would be from reading the recipe. Upon first tasting the vinaigrette, I thought the dijon mustard flavor was WAY too heavy, so I added a bit more of everything else and it was the best part of the meal. The wasabi cream was just ok, and I'm a huge wasabi fan. The fish turned out with an excellent texture; an excellent base with which to enjoy the vinaigrette.
