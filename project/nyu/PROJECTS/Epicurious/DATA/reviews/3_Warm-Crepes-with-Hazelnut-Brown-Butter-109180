the crepes and hazelnut cream were very tasty! not very sure about the butter... too much butter, i think. also, 3 crepes per serving is also a little bit much. nice desert, though. goes well with chocolate hazlenut martinis =)

i enjoyed this. i could have used a bit more of the hazelnut cream inside and on top but otherwise it was great. the butter sauce itself was nothing special. but it was a nice treat.

After folding the crepe in half, I added slices of bananas before folding it again before baking. I also topped the hazelnut cream with banana on top of the crepe. I must've done something wrong when making the sauce -- it looked so oily (is a stick of butter really necessary?) I ended up omitting it all together. Pretty tasty overall.

This was good but not totally great. I made the whole recipe and served it several times over a week. (Lots more than 6 servings) The crepes, butter, and sauce kept very well in the refrigerator. i think the amount of hazelnuts called for is excessive, especially for a product which is difficult to find and is pricey in my area. The Frangelico was not a concern as I had it in hand. (I suppose you could buy those 2-oz sample sized bottles if you just wanted it for this recipe.) I do agree that the sauce makes the dish. Don't neglect the salt - it adds just the right note.

I loved the crepes and I loved the sauce -- not crazy for the hazelnut cream. So I sprinkled the crepes with chopped hazelnuts, put on a little sauce and baked per recipe (I think you could also put in some sauted fruit). Then I served with additional sauce...and some ice cream.

I agree with Fresno - the cooking time for the raw flour in the sauce does not seem long enough to cook away the starchiness of flour. Did anyone find this a problem?

Hey Fresno, I think you have had too many martinis!!

I question the use of the flour in the hazelnut cream that is not cooked other than the six minutes in the oven. I am wrong to think this is strange? Insight, please.

I usually am very pleased with the recipes I find in Bon Appetit but this one really missed the mark. Not only is it costly to make if youd have to buy the hazelnut liquor but the end result was not nearly as good as I had hoped.

Very simple!! fantastic dessert when you have a lack of time try substituing the hazelnuts for almonds as well the frangelico for amaretto
