Great recipe. I can't imagine that this would be very good without the tarragon. It really finishes the flavor of the dish.

I HAD SOME FRESH TARRAGON I WANTED TO USE UP SO I TRIED THIS RECIPE. WOW!! REALLY DELISH. I USED FAT FREE HALF ANF HALF AND WHEN IT DIDN'T REALLY THICKEN THE WAY I WANTED, I SPRINKLED SOME WONDRA IN IT WHICH WORKED WELL. BUT NEXT TIME, AND THERE WILL BE A NEXT TIME, I'LL ADD SOME CORNSTARCH TO IT BEFORE I COOK IT.

Just tried this again following recipe, with small changes. I used six halved mini-roma tomatoes and added a little gorgonzola. Spectacular!

Very simple dish, have also tried with mustard powder, or mustard seeds, in place of tarragon with guests who don't like it. Standard way of doing leeks in our household now. I am not fond of tomatoes in warm food, however these are a must in this.

I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS DISH AND I HAVE ADDED SPINACH TO IT. NICE COLOR COMBINATION. HAVE USED PANCETTA ALSO. WILL DO THIS FOR THANKSGIVING THIS YEAR.

Great dish--I used Roma tomatoes because they don't release as much moisture as regular tomatoes do when you are cooking with them. Everyone liked it and would like to have it again. We're trying to eat more vegetables with more variety--this was definitely a hit and something we'll have again.

Hard to believe I'm the first to rate this fabulous dish! It was easy to make, a delicious side dish to the Roast Pork Loin with Garlic and Rosemary (recipe on this site), had great flavors, and was equally great warmed up the second day. It doesn't get much better!
