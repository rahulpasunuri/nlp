At mochaalmond. I had to mention that your low rating is unfair as you gave low rating mostly because of the daunting task of deboning the fish. You do realize that whole fish usually have bone in and once you cook, you can eat around it or remove it after eating one side like in 3 seconds. The descaling etc can be asked to be done at the ine of buying the fish if you are not a veteran. In fact you can ask then to debone in situ also. Anyway, just want to let you know for next whole fish experience as I doubt any recipe would detail out how to do this as of course it is understood.

This was my first experience preparing a whole fish. While the fennel-potato-fish combo was tasty, the difficulty of preparing and serving this dish were exceptionally daunting, even for an Epicurious veteran. Steps, such as de-boning a whole fish, were assumed and missing from the recipe, which made dinner a bit of a disaster.

Like monirun, we couldn't find black bass either and used tilapia. We ended up using four small tilapia. The recipe was fantastic - time-consuming (of course), but as usual with such things, absolutely worth it. I think my favorite was the roasted fennel flavor combined with the fennel seeds and potatoes. My husband & I thought this dish was remarkable.

I could not find black bass, so I used 2 tilapia, about 1# each, which worked fine. I've been wanting to make whole fish, and this was my first time making it. Made it for my husband (I don't eat fish) and he loved the fish!! He didn't eat the yogurt. I roasted my potatoes with the fennel (didn't mash them). Will make it again!

This was an amazing meal! Someone mentioned it has several steps. It is perfect for a cooking club because you can assign different tasks to people, or you could do much of ahead of time. Served with moroccan carrots (a Gourmet recipe) and a salad with roasted cherry tomatoes, arugula, goat cheese, and mint.

I used trout (bass not available when I made this) and it was delicious. My boyfriend is still talking about it. You have to like cilantro, which we do. Yummy!

Really Tasty. The Charmoula and lime yogurt add a lot to the fish. The whole menu was good, although it has a lot of parts.
