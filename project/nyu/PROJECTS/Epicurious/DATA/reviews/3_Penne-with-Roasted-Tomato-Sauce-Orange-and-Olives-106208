I didn't have olives, but otherwise I made this as written. It was only okay. The OJ added a nice flavor that was very different, but ultimately it was bland. Some of the garlic burned, and the whole deglaze with OJ thing didn't really add up to mch. Lots of salt and pepper saved it, but I wouldn't make it again.

I am a big fan of simple, no meat, tomato laden pasta dishes, and this has become one of my favorites after only one preparation. The flavor is wonderful, and the one thing i did different was to omit the orange peel. this recipe absolutely does not need any alterations. wonderful!!!

The roasting of the tomatoes with the orange juice was terrific. As many others have indicated this is a flexible recipe -- I forgot to get basil (though I think the green would've been pretty, besides being tasy) -- and I ended up making a smaller batch than the recipe called for, because I didn't buy enough tomatoes. I used a sweet onion and roasted it together with the plum tomatoes. Using the orange juice to get all the roasted bits off the pan was great. I also did not bother with the orange peel. This is going into my staples list!

This dish was delicious and very easy to prepare. Added cooked chicken and lightly sauteed oyster mushrooms. Skipped the orange peel and added only enough OJ to loosen roasted veggies. The roasting of the veggies really brought out the flavor, making the tomatoes especially sweet and yummy. The whole family enjoyed it.

A little too much work involved. I made it according to the recipe, but it really was not worth the taste...although, it was good...just too time-consuming to prepare.

A wonderful, rich dish (and low fat)! A good way to use all the end of season plum tomatos from the garden.

I love this dish! Instead of orange juice, I deglaze my roasted tomato and onion pans with white wine, add low-salt chicken broth and add grilled chicken. It's a winner everytime!

This was a very light and flavorful pasta. Seeing that others wrote that the orange flavor was almost too strong, I didn't add the orange zest. I also used canned tomatoes, but didn't cook them as long as in the recipe. I loved the result, and can't wait to try this one again!!

I also followed the recipe exactly as printed, and though it was FANTASTIC. No problems with burned onions or blue garlic. Will definitely be making this one again!

My family and I loved this dish! The only variation was I used about 4 T of olive oil, rather than the 2 called for in the recipe. It was light, but satisfying. Really delicious!

Made this recipe for a family birthday dinner and everyone loved it. Not a single change was suggested - and this comes from a family who is forever making changes to recipes. We did not find the orange taste overpowering and did not have any problem with blue garlic. I followed the recipe exactly.

I really enjoyed the flavor, and thought this was very easy to prepare. I am quite surprised that others had a bad experience - we liked this.

I enjoy flavorfull food so this recipe was right up my alley. Instead of of placing the tomatoes and onions on baking sheet first, I placed them in separate bowls and poured over them a mixture made of the olive oil, orange juice, garlic, and orange peel - then placed them on sheet and roasted. Also, I was in a little time constrained when making this recipe so I used jarred chopped garlic which did not turn blue. No blue surprises in my penne!

I was so surprised by the other reviews for this recipe. I followed it almost exactly except substituted McCormick's grated orange peel for zesting my own orange. It was delicious!! The smell of the tomatoes and onions roasting was wonderful. Overall taste was very refreshing. I rate it has one of the best, easiest and most interesting recipes to come out in Bon Appetit in the last two years!!! If you like pasta and are looking for non-meat entrees...this is a great one!!

This recipe seems interesting, but it does indeed beg for alterations to one's taste. Thanks to the comments I've read, I'll start by reducing the amount of peel, add it at the end of the roasting, and no orange juice. It would be overwhelming. I'll let you know how it turns out.

I havn't tried this recipe as stated but a variation in which I used canned Italian plum tomatoes,cooked about 30 minutes,along with orange zest,fresh mint and basil and I rated that almost 4 forks

About the blue garlic: I just read somewhere that the blue color comes from a reaction between pigments in the garlic and an acid solution, probably the orange juice in this case. Supposedly it doesn't affect the flavor, but I don't know if I'd appreciate finding blue garlic on my plate...

This was an odd recipe. I liked the list of ingredients, but 15 minutes into roasting the tomatoes, et al. I noticed that the garlic turned a blue/green color. The aroma of tomatoes and garlic was wonderful, but after seeing the garlic, I wasn't interested in continuing with the recipe. Does anyone know what caused this color change?

It seemed interesting, but we did not like this one at all!!

Too much orange for me. I liked the idea of orange flavor with pasta but once the orange peel is cooked it takes on a very strong over powering taste.I will use a lot less orange next time

I'm not fond of the orange juice ingredient in this recipe, although I do like meat and fruit combinations.

Just a comment- please don't rate a recipe negatively if you didn't follow it! Pesto for fresh basil is nowhere CLOSE to an even substitution!

Alright, maybe it's because I used leftover pesto sauce for the basil and rice-penne for the penne, but this dish tasted strange, tho not terrible. The onions turned into charcoal strings after less than 30 min, so keep an eye on the oven.

Made this for my vegetarian friend and we all loved it. Very easy & delicious.
