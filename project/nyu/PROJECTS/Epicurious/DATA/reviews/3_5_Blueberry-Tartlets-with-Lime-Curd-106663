I too thought the curd was too runny. The lime flavor was overpowering and a bit too tart for my taste. Next time I will reduce the amount of lime juice.

This is a light, and satisfying dessert. It was a huge hit! The lime and blueberries go beautifully together. However, I like to cover the entire tart in blueberries as opposed to sprinkling just a few. Also, the crust was exceptional! I always refer back to this recipe every time I make a tart, its the only pastry crust recipe I use now! I defineltey reccomend this dessert. Who doesn't love a light, fruity tart?

I love this recipe, it is a great combination. I've made it for many fuctions and gotten rave reviews. I also think it makes a beautiful presentation.

Absolutely delicious.....the tart in the photo was done by a food stylist tho. That much lime curd would have been way too tart. With just a thin layer of curd and more blueberry sauce, it was wonderful. Crust was like a short bread cookie. Rave reviews from all who tried the tarts.

Great recipe, I just added my own spin to things. I added chopped candied ginger to the crust (when adding the whipping cream) and to carry the flavor over I added candied ginger to the blueberry topping as well, 2/3 way through cook time!!! I also garnished the plates with edible flowers, very pretty. The only glich I found was that the crust only made 6 tartlets and there was only enough curd to fill four. Luckily that was just enough for my guest and there wasn't a teaspoon left on their plates!

I used all of the curd and all of the blueberry and I had just enough (mine had more berries and less curd than the pic). The curd was not too tart or too sweet. I did two batches of 4 and estimated the bake time. Boyfriend and family loved it!!! yummmmy!!!

I doubled the curd recipe and make an 8" tart. Although I followed the directions and refrigerated the tart until serving, the curd didn't hold up well when cut. I thought the taste was a bit too tart. If the curd held up, it would make a very nice presentation. Didn't think there was anything extraordinary about this recipe. Next time I'll try another curd recipe and keep the blueberry topping.

These were delicious. I used puff pastry shells instead of the crust, it was very easy and the combination of lime curd and blueberries was great. I also put a little whipped cream on top. Next time I'm going to try it with the little phyllo shells.

I've made this repeatedly for company, and it's always a hit. I've started to cheat a little bit-- these days, I use raspberries on top, and rather than make the cooked topping, I melt some seedless raspberry jam. All the taste without all the work!

contrary to most people, I actually think there was too much crust here. I used a larger tart pan and found the crust to be just so-so. For all that butter, it was pretty dry and tough. I would rather use a regular pie crust in the future. The lime curd was very, very good - maybe a tad too sweet, but really a perfect pair for the blueberries. If I could give 2 1/2 stars and a maybe, that would really be my vote

The blueberries & lime curd make an awesome combination. The crust was eh, but that could have to do with my skill--or lack thereof. In any case, this is a nice flavor change. I used all of the curd (didn't think it was going to be enough but flavor is pungent). Enjoy!

I made 16 1.5 X 2" tartlettes - wow! Fairly easy and bursting with flavor. Not too sweet, not too tart, very pretty presentation. Everyone raved. As a few of the others here, I did not use all of the curd. I think you could get away with halving the curd recipe given - the curd itself is VERY tart, you only need a little bit.

The incredible color of a half-dozen little fluted tarts was just gorgeous!. Lime is an exciting change from lemon. A bit time consuming but makes for a very impressive desert. I found I had at least a cup of curd leftover. Raspberries would be tasty as well.

I made 6-4 1/2 inch tartlets. They had a small amount of curd in each and plenty of blueberries. I thought that the combination was perfect. Too much curd may overwhelm the delicate blueberry flavor. I made them over the course of 2 days and froze the unbaked shells before baking. This made the whole process very easy. I'm sure that other fruit could be easily substituted.

Made the curd and used it to fill homemade donuts. A little sprinkling of cinnamon and sugar on the donuts and yum! Best of all, this recipe was a cinch.

I made this as a larger tart and garnished it with fresh mint. It was seemed almost a shame to cut into it - it was that picture perfect.

I have a specialty dessert business out of my home and this is one of my best sellers. I usually double the curd and make a 10" tart crust. It can be made ahead and holds very well in the refrigerator. I also substitute lemon and raspberries sometimes.

the lime tart was so good. i did not think i would ever prefer lime over lemon until this desert.
