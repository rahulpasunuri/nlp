Forgot to add that I made it with a mixture of gala and granny smith apples, unpeeled. The flecks of green and red peel were quite attractive.

I'm thinking that the "8" apples is a typo. Should be 4. That's what I used -- kept the other ingredients the same -- and it packed 2 pint jars (2 cups each).

This is a perfect, basic, traditional charoset. One major issue - the amount of nuts called for is nowhere near enough. Triple the nuts, if not more. Only one other modification, I used honey instead of sugar. It doesn't need much sweetener.

I wipped this up for this Passover. It was a hit. We had friends over who were unfamiliar with jewish foods and they thought it was fabulous! I added pears and bananas to the recipe. It had a great flavor. I've had some requests to make this througout the year- not just at Passover!

8 apples and only 2/3 cups almonds.? This can't be right. Makes way more than 3 cups, more like 2 quarts. To get the right consistency I doubled all the other ingredients including the almonds, except the sugar as the wine is sweet enough.

I made this with honey and a dry red wine(all I had and I couldn't find any good kosher wine) and It was very good.

FYI there are a number of excellent kosher balsamic vinegars produced in Modena, Italy. No need for subsitutes!

Just read the reviews about this recipe -- there is a kosher balsamic vinegar made by Kedem ( it may even be kosher for passover ). Not a bad product !!!

It really should say "Kosher sweet red wine" Also, for anyone who doesn't want to use wine, a good quality wine vinegar is fine. I like it with balsamic vinegar (obviously not Kosher) just as much as with wine.
