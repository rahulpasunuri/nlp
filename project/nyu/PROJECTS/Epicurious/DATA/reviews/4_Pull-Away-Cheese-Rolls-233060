This was absolutely delicious. I agree that you do have to add about 3/4 cup more of flour. Also I added zaatar, and red pepper flakes to the dough to give it more of a kick. I also added mint to the filling and used cilantro instead of parsley. It was pretty easy to make and totally yummy. Also the baking time is pretty quick so do check on the rolls after 10-15 minutes!

VERY EXCELLENT Taste and Texture. Added 3/4 cup extra flour and let the bread machine do all of the mixing and rising work. I could not get these delicious things out of my mind until they were all eaten. This dough is so addictive that I'm thinking of trying it shaped in other ways such as a stuffed loaf as opposed to little rolls, or perhaps as a foccacia. Because of this recipe, I was introduced to Halloumi cheese, and have already used it in another recipe. Thank you!! Cooking with cheese that can be fried and grilled without melting, opens up lots of exciting culinary possibilities.

this recipe was great. i agree that the dough was too wet. i had to add at least another 3/4 cups of flour in order to handle the dough. i also used 1 cup of whole milk, instead of 1 cup of water and 1/2 cup of powdered whole milk. turned out really yummy. my roommates ate an entire pan in one sitting. i also added zaatar in the filling for extra punch of flavor.

We enjoyed this recipe but it was a bit tricky at first. As another reviewer noted, the dough was really wet and needed a ton more flour. I also noticed they baked up much faster than indicated. I substituted feta halloumi since I couldn't find any, and added red chili flakes to the filling for a kick. Enjoyable with soup and I would try this one again.

This was great with the plucky halloumi cheese. I'd add more seasoning to the dough next time; without it, all the flavor is concentrated in the middle of each roll. Still, that didn't stop us from eating ~9 rolls apiece in one sitting.

Good recipe, but it needs tweaking. It doesn't call for enough flour, the cheeses are too mild, and it is lacking in spices. Next time I'll use extra Nigella seeds because they are so tasty. This recipe is definitely worth some more tries.

This dish was wonderful! My friend and I ate half the pan.

Very delicious. The halloumi cheese generally keeps it shape when heated so the halloumi and mozzarella are a nice combination texture wise as well as flavor wise. This recipe is staying in my files long term.

Amazing !!! I'm impressed. I made this for friends, wow. Everyone had the recipe before they left. The only thing I had to change was the kind of cheese. I live in a small town and don't get many unique items. I used a smoked white cheddar. And was only able to get the sesame seeds. This is going to become a regular at tea time. Thanks, Debra
