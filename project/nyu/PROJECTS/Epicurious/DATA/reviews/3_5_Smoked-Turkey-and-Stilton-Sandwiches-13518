These tasted good, but we served them along side the "Roast Beef Sandwiches with Roquefort and Caramelized Shallots" and they just didn't compare.

I loved these sandwiches, but my boyfriend was not overwhelmed. Needed just a little more chutney and probably could use less of the stilton mayo mixture per sandwich. I'll try them again as I thought it was well worth it.

Made last month and these are just wonderfully delicious and easy to prepare. Beautiful combination of flavors! KIMBER

I work in a wine store and do some of the cooking for the tastings. This was a huge hit served alongside lamb, smoked mushroom frittata, and goat cheese and spinach rolls. The sweetness from the chutney was a contrast to the sourness of the cheese and made it perfect. Only difference-I roasted the turkey with an herb crust rather than smoking it and served it on small rolls instead of the 5 in rolls. Yum!

These are really easy and the spread makes a difference between "just another turkey sandwhich" and one that's memorable.
