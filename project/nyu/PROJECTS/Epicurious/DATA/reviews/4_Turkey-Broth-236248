Just popped my turkey parts into the oven. I've been using this recipe for years, but I add some thyme and tarragon (I'm not a fan of rosemary for Thanksgiving). No need for separate pans. I use my turkey roaster, and put it on two burners on the stove when I add the water. Makes outstanding gravy!

The Thanksgiving Secret Weapon! Rich amazing flavor adder for any type of stuffig - regular, foccacia, sourdough or cornbread - let's you cut the fats a little because it adds so much flavor. So good you can make the gravy ahead of time using this stock. Note to Epicurious - I'm pretty sure this ran under the name 'roasted turkey stock' but you can only find it on the site if you search turkey broth (?!). Make it easier to find!

I have used this recipe every year for Thanksgiving and/or Christmas since it was printed in 2006.

Out-Freakin-Standing! I have made this recipe a couple of times now as directed and it makes a wonderful base for either a turkey gravy or any kind of turkey soup/chowder.
