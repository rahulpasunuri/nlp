This was a great recipe. Made a few tweaks, like others. I cut the sugar, used about 2/3 whole wheat flour and 1/3 regular. I cut the oil and added a bit more yogurt (plain greek). I added a little more zucchini than called for too and a bit more vanilla. I skipped the lemon and orange zest and the nuts. Instead of cocoa, I used choc chips. The result was delicious! I also cooked the muffins for less time, about 24 minutes in all. Lastly, I skipped the frosting.

Made large muffins, 20-25 minutes was enough. Skipped the lemon and orange zest and skipped the icing. Delicious! More like cupcakes than muffins.

I give this recipe 4 forks just for sheer adaptability. Like most people, I made changes to my mix...big ones. I used 3/4c honey instead of sugar, a heaping dollop of sour cream instead of yogurt, only 2 eggs, half whole wheat flour half unbleached white, 1/4c oil, no orange at all, chocolate chips and pistachios. I pretty much changed everything...and they still came out amazing! Oh, draining the zucchini was a good idea. I also made really huge muffins and 20 minutes was more than adequate, as per other suggestions.

Nice alternative to the usual zucchini bread loaf and incredibly easy to boot. I thought the lemon + chocolate + zucchini + cinnamon combo would be weird but somehow it oddly works. Very moist & puffs up nicely.

Amazing! I did a little tweeking. Instead of 3/4 C oil, I used 1/2 instead. Then I added 1/4 C unsweetened applesauce to cover the 1/4 oil. I added about 1/4 cup choco chips (60% cocoa). I also substitued whole wheat pastry flour for most the flour and added 1/4 C white flour. I did this to reduce the fat a little, and add more fiber, (but probably added the fat right back with the choco chips). Muffins came out moist and more like a cupcake consistency.

These were delicious without cream cheese!

We loved these! I used white whole wheat flour with two tablespoons of flaxseed meal, substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil, and only used half of the lemon zest based on previous comments (no orange on hand either). Also added chocolate chips and skipped the frosting per previous recommendations - good move! Made 3 dozen regular-sized (2 1/2" diameter) muffins. A healthy and guilt-free way to satisfying any chocolate and/or baked goods cravings!

Made 2 dozen regular sized muffins. The texture was great, but I felt like the lemon zest made the muffins a bit bitter - so recommend only using half or recommend adding 1 cup of chocolate chips - that helps to counter the lemon.

I made these muffins after reading all of the glowing reviews and I couldn't be happier with them. I made them full-sized and skipped the icing. I found they only needed about 22-25 minutes in the oven. I also decreased the sugar to about 1.3 cups. The batter is thick and glossy and very fragrant. They took a little longer to make but it's worth the extra effort (mostly in zesting). My 20 month old daughter approves and they're great for a fast breakfast.

These were amazing! My husband, 3 year old son, and 1 year old twins LOVED them. Instead of the cocoa I added 1 jar of sweet potatoes baby food, and actually forgot the salt, and they were splendid. Like most of the other readers I skipped the frosting and will actually try to use the whole wheat flour and less sugar next time...

Thanks to a streak of exceptionally nice weather, my zucchini is still going strong in October in Iowa. This recipe was a nice change of pace from my usual zucchini applications. I made these as full- sized muffins but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I would recommend squeezing the water out of the zucchini after grating it. Also, the baking time given for the the mini-muffins seemed questionable. I took my full-size muffins out of the oven after 20 minutes and they were perfectly baked. I cheated and used a can of cream cheese frosting from my pantry instead of making it from scratch. Next time I would sprinkle a little orange zest on top of the frosted muffins to dress them up a bit. They were delicious and I will definitely make them again.

I made this without frosting in full size muffin cups and LOVED it... check out my review and pics of this at: http://erinlpeterson.com/2010/10/chocolate-muffin/

Excellent and versatile. I used 1c whole wheat and 1.5 cups white flour. Also, I added chocolate chips and dried cranberries in lieu of nuts. The recipe made 6 dozen mini muffins.

Also reduced the sugar a bit (1/2 C granulated sugar and 1 C brown sugar); skipped the frosting. These were delicious, even for dessert! Great (grate!!) way to use up all that summer squash from our CSA!

Like the cook from Norton, MI, I subbed in some whole wheat flour (1 1/2c.)and used yellow squash. I also didn't have orange or lemon on hand and so used fresh mint from the garden and we all loved them. Didn't use any frosting, we ate as breakfast muffin. Also cut white sugar to 1/2c. + 1c. brown sugar, it was plenty for us.

Delish.. even with making them this first time with rice milk due to a milk allergy (I added baking powder and lemon juice to get some more rise). I can imagine with buttermilk they would be even more divine! Will make many, many times again.

I cut the recipe down to 2/3 because I only have 2 dozen worth of mini-muffin pans. It filled them to overflowing plus made 4 full-sized muffins. My guess is that the full recipe would easily make 2 dozen full-sized muffins. A fair amount of work but they're worth it. Chewy, moist, really flavorful. I served them to a group of people who fought over them and couldn't stop eating. Would be nice if an actual amount for orange juice were included in the frosting recipe as oranges vary greatly in size and juice capacity. I went very light on juice and drank the rest. ;-) Also, I found the frosting to be way too thin even while skimping on juice, so I added about 1/4 C of Marshmallow Fluff (the real stuff) to it and WOW!!!! Fabulous texture.

I probably would have given this recipe four forks, except that I had to make it without the orange and lemon zest (broken grater). I used dark cocoa powder and added mini chocolate chips. Very tasty and easy!

Delicious! Made some of the suggested changes. Used 1/2 WW flour and 1/2c of oil with 1/4c yogurt. Also used 1/2c brn sugar and 1/2c white sugar. My kids LOVED them. Recipe makes nice round crispy muffin tops!

Awesome way to use up all that squash from my CSA. It's great as written (although I haven't made it with the frosting),but I've also made it with the following changes: yellow crookneck squash instead of zucchini, subbed one cup of white flour for whole wheat, one Tbsp of Meyer lemon juice for the orange when I didn't have an orange, I've also ommited the yogurt or used vanilla yogurt instead of plain. Like I said, great as is, but forgiving enough to make do with what is in your pantry. Very moist. Makes a bunch.

Really tasty. I added chocolate chips, as another reviewer suggested and skipped the nuts. The recipe makes 3 dozen muffins of regular size, not mini.

The squash makes the muffins moist and the texture is great. I'd imagine that the recipe makes more than 3 doz. mini muffins, 'cause I used standard size muffins and it made 2 dozen. The muffin itself is a little bland and easily overshadowed by the frosting. Next time I will probably add chocolate chips or raisins to the batter (did not use nuts).

I used the batter in a bundt pan instead and it worked out great - a yummy and moist cake.
