Great simple recipe. Great flavors. DO NOT need to pressure cook! We adjusted it to the oven, browned the ribs first of course, then slowed cooked, covered, in a cast iron enamel pan in a 375 oven, for about 2 hrs (basted/turned occasionally) Did not use the prunes, but instead put on top of the ribs some baby Bok Choy about 15 minutes before serving, covered the dish and let them steam in the oven.

This recipe, alone justifies, a pressure cooker. Fan favorite, crowd-pleaser. I separate the meat from the bones and shred it. Not everybody wants to deal with bones, especially at a party. Lay a bed of rice in big, walled platter. drizzle liberally with the leftover sauce. Top with the meat, sprinkle with the scallions. Awesome.

I followed this recipe to the "t". However, it ended up with a burned set of ribs. The recipe calls for too little liquid for the pressure cooker. If you want to try it double or triple the amount of beef stock.

folks mentioned, in the reviews, that this dish tended toward sweet. I doubled the vinegar and, since I'm not a big prune fan, diced up some dried papaya.I did the ribs in the oven 350 degrees for three hours but had to use more liquid. About another cup or cup and a half of beef stock. This was delicious!

Yum! This was super easy to make. The meat was extremely tender and the flavor was great. I added mushrooms, which were a nice addition.

Easily adaptable to slow cooker - 9 hours on low. The prunes are give or take, so don't worry if you don't have them available.

Great Dish!! I made a few changes: 1)browned short ribs 2) sauteed onion, garlic, celery, carrot, and baby portabella mushrooms. Will make this dish again and again.

Have been making the recipe for years. A special holiday treat. Since I do not own a pressure cooker I just make it on top of the stove.

I got my pressure cooker about a year ago, and have been impressed with a number of recipes. This one is no exception. I brought it to a potluck with a group of San Francisco foodies in San Francisco. There were raves all around, and astonished looks that it only took an hour to make. I've never attempted short ribs before. This recipe made it easy. The only thing I changed was to add about 3 tablespoons of fresh ginger.

We made this recipe for the first time as we had been looking for a recipe that didn't involve wine (yet again) something a little different. It was fantastic! we modified it somewhat however. We used a slowcooker instead of pressure cooker...and we used 6 short ribs instead of ther 12 it calls for. We did NOT alter the other ingredients to compensate, but followed the recipe exactly which may have made that flavor the meat perfectly. It was definitely not too sweet, nor too bland. I would not thicken the gravy the next time however. We find A thinner gravy drizzled over the mashed potatoes and veggies is preferrable.

Disappointing. Tastes like plain ol pot roast. I love prunes, I love fruit and meat combos, but the prunes in here tasted blah.

I was so skeptical about making short ribs in the pressure cooker; but these were SO tender, we could not believe it. Sauce was a bit greasy, though, therefore my skepticism, but the flavors and tenderness won out. It is important to really pick over those ribs before cooking to cut off any extra fat. Try to find the leanest short ribs at the store. Also, browning them first does help to render off fat.

To burned pressure cooker: I agree with the comment that you might wish to get a "flame tamer" for your pressure cooker. My guess is that you have an older or inexpensive cooker with a thin bottom, which would explain the scorching. I use a Kuhn Rikon 4 quart model, my first and only pressure cooker, and love it. All of their models have a thick aluminum-clad bottom that heats evenly and does not stick or scorch at all. Why not buy yourself a present and ditch the old jobber?

I made this recipe last night and my husband and I thought it was delicious. I used the country-style pork ribs but kept the rest of the recipe as printed. I almost didn't try it because I was worried that the recipe would be very sweet as many commented. I didn't find this to be the case. It was slightly sweet but I didn't find it too sweet at all. Don't let the "too sweet" comments keep you from trying this!

This recipe is a winter staple. My husband asks for it every other week. I can get home at 8pm and have dinner ready before 9! Tip - Brown the ribs first. If you experience sticking, buy a heavy cast iron heat diffuser. It will slow down and even-out your burner.

My family isn't real fond of sweet-flavored meats so I omitted the prunes and added some garlic and ginger. Absolutely delicious. I'm usually afriad to cook ribs because mine always come out so tough; using the pressure cooker resulted in the most tender ribs I've ever eaten. I will happily make this one again. BTW, I always only used my pressure cooker for steaming and canning. Everything else seems to burn to the bottom since we can't stir it. Any suggestions?

I do not have a pressure cooker, so I used my crock pot and cooked this all day. Loved the flavors even on the leftovers. My 13 month old son liked the beef because it was shredded and loved the sweet prune flavor.

really yummy. i substituted a couple of tablespoons of plum butter for the prunes (because i don't like things too sweet). i also just reduced the sauce instead of adding flour. it was just delicious. and i love finding new pressure cooker...what an amazing thing a pressure cooekr is. i'm surprised that more serious cooks don't use them.

I just loved this recipe. It was sweet but served with plain basmaiti or jasmine rice tones it down a bit. I'm going to add some carrots and parsnips to the recipe next time to see if I can't make a whole meal in the one pot!

We thought this recipe was delicious! Used a crock pot on low as suggested previously and added sliced ginger. My husband is not usually a fan of beef ribs, but thought these were the best he's had.

I used country style pork ribs in a slow cooker. The sauce was pretty bland. My kids love ribs, but asked if I could make the old one's next time!

To Escondido: I made this recipe sans prunes, and it was not "overly" sweet. Maybe just a spoonfull of plum preserves in place of the prunes would be good. You could also cut the (sweet) balsamic and replace it with red wine vinegar. Hoisin sauce can be a little sweet, too, but I think it is essential for the dish. Just a few thoughts from a French-trained chef . . . .

We liked this but hesitate to make it for company because it turned out so sweet that we could hardly tell we were eating beef. Can anyone tell me how to make it less sweet?

I used country style pork ribs as well, and they were excellent. I parboiled them for 20 minutes then added them to all the other ingredients in the crock pot. I cooked them on low for 7 hours and then served them over white rice. I made this as a 1/2 portion, and it worked just as well!

I wasn't able to buy beef short ribs at the grocery store, so I substituted country style pork ribs. They were super meaty. I followed everything else close to the letter. They were so tender, they were breaking apart with a spoon. Company enjoyed them as well. The sauce was great over steamed rice. Everyone was very impressed. It was also my first time with a pressure cooker, and I am so pleased.

I browned the ribs first and then put them in the crock pot on high. Used a few cloves of garlic instead of onions--I couldn't believe I didn't have any on hand! Anyway, my husband and I thought these were delicious. Served with steamed rice sprinkled with rice vinegar and spinach.

I put everything in a crockpot, along with a minced garlic clove,and cooked on high for about 6 hours. The meat was falling off the bone - very tender and the flavor was wonderful! I didn't make the roux at the end, because I wanted the natural juices (minus fat) instead of a thickened sauce. I served it with brown rice and put the juices on the rice. The flavors were perfect together. This was a huge hit, and I will definitely make it again.

Very tasty! I added the ginger and also a good dose of red pepper flakes. Also browned the meat first and was able to get some of the fat out before braising.

Everybody liked this recipe, used the crockpot and the ribs turned out very tender I also seared the ribs in a large pan before tossing in the sauce, also added sliced fresh ginger, VERY GOOD

The dish turned out OK but the Asian flavors were lost. I even added ginger because I like ginger in my Asian dishes, but couldn't even taste that. If I make this again I will increase the seasonings.

I plan on trying this recipe soon, but using a cooking bag! Although not mentioned much by 'epicurious' cooks, I have found this method to be great - and easy. I use low heat and long cooking - and I don't even brown the meat first! Just throw in the ingredients together with a tablespoon of flour (for a nice, long braise, use enough liquid to come up about half way up whatever cut of meat you are using)and use low heat (325) for 2-3 hours. I know purists may shudder - but just try it once with your favorite brisket or pot roast recipe and you'll be hooked. No need to drag out your heavy Le Creuset - it seals in the juices and melds the flavor just as well (seriously!) This recipe sounds good, but I plan to omit the sesame oil. I'm Asian, and while I enjoy authentic flavors, I think most Western based recipes are too heavy on the sesame oil, which is really supposed to just accent (not overpower) a dish. Maybe a little port wine for the sweetness would be good.

I used my pressure cooker, as specified, and the meat turned out very tender, flavorful, delicious, just as I knew it would. Forget the braising unless you don't have a pressure cooker. My pot roasts also turn out extremely tender - I have been sold on this method of cooking for over 50 years. Try it - you'll love it!

A cooking method by which food (usually meat or vegetables) is first browned in fat, then cooked, tightly covered, in a small amount of liquid at low heat for a lengthy period of time. The long, slow cooking develops flavor and tenderizes foods by gently breaking down their fibers. Braising can be done on top of the range or in the oven. A tight-fitting lid is very important to prevent the liquid from evaporating. From your Dictionary!

People, please forget about the pressure cooker. Stews, like this one need to STEW. that is cooking slowly, to absorb flavors, and to soften the meat. The recepie is nice, but get those ribs in a braiser. I use some ginger, anisseed as well, by the way.
