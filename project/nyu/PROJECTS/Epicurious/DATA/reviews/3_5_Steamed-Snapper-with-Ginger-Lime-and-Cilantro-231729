Very tasty and delicious. I didn't have clam juice, so used chicken broth instead and it worked fine. Also added 1/2 teaspoon of sugar to give it more depth. This is definitely a keeper!

We prepared halibut in individual foil packets in a 400 degree oven for 20 minutes and the results were fabulous!

Excellent! I didn't use the clam juice but followed the recipe other than that. It was very flavorful, light and satisfying! I served it with basmati rice and it was a wonderful dinner!

Really nice flavour. Baked the snapper because I didn't have the steaming apparatus - 350 for 15 minutes, turned out perfect. Also, left out clam juice and the flavour was still great. Used a bit too much pepper, will definitely cut down on that next time.

great recipe, don't skimp on the cilantro. I also cooked it in the oven instead of steaming.

Fantastic dish! Fast, easy and tasty. My husband gave it four forks as well - i think that's a first! I used New Zealand Red Snapper and left out the clam juice (didn't have any) and served it with coconut rice as suggested by another reviewer. Definitely a keeper!

I made this last night for friends. Definitely one of the best fish recipes I've ever tasted. And very simple. I don't have access to clam juice in Kabul and found that it isn't needed. Also, I made extra sauce but then found that the fish doesn't steam if it's too submerged. I ended up taking it out of the pie plate and simply placing it directly on the steamer rack, then pouring the sauce over after it had finished cooking. All my guests loved it.

easy, tasty, healthy! The trifecta!

I also made this accompanied by the coconut rice as another reader suggested. It was a good pairing. Very easy recipes. I had to improvize the steamer. My husband wanted a stronger tasting fish.

WAY too much cilantro. (And I love cilantro.) I will cut the required amount in half next time, maybe even less. Otherwise, a really nice blend of flavors.

A wonderfly tasty and healthy dish. Used fresh California halibut and steamed using an asian steamer. Pie plate was too big so used a small ceramic dish. Seemed like it took a little longer than 8 minutes. Fish was meaty and sauce was strong but very flavorful. I didn't use as much cilantro as the recipe called for. Works really well with the coconut rice on epicurious since it has cilantro in it too.

Cilantro overkill! I followed the recipe to the letter with red snapper. The lime, cilantro, and ginger definitely got rid of the fishy taste, but I just didn't like the final result.

Yum Yum Yum, this was amazing. The flavor combination was perfect. It will be made in this house again and again.

I used fresh snapper and followed the recipe. It was SO good! I do need buy the right equipment to steam fish though. Like many others, I improvised the equipment because I didn't have a glass pie plate that would fit in a pot. My husband loved the dish!

Wow, this was excellent...a nice Thai flair. The steaming instructions were a little too cumbersome for me, so I put it in the oven - at 350 for 20 minutes, and it was just perfect. My Philippino boyfriend raved over it and actually asked that I make this when his parents come to town!!

Delightful. I, too, made it with tilapia (4 minutes steaming). Recipe is great as is, but I will add some Thai chiles next time as another cook did since I do like the heat.......but did love it the way it was. Paired it with a coconut ginger jasmine rice and steamed asparagus. Thumbs up!

The only thing I changed on this was to cut the lime juice down to 1 Tbs., as lime can overpower a dish. PERFECT! Nice, bright and fresh flavors! I used tilapia instead of halibut, and since my steamer basket has a stem in the center, I could not fit the plate in. No problem, just poured the sauce over and baked it in a 350 oven for about 15 minutes. Paired this with the Warms Spinachm Mushroom and Goat Cheese Salad, also from this website. YUMMERS!Will be making often.

Mmmmm, what a super and healthy way to prepare halibut! Bright, fresh, clean and delicate in flavour. The only change I made was to add a tablespoon of very finely minced lemon grass which softened well during steaming, and a sprinkling of cracked pink peppercorns. Simply delicious!

This was great-- flavorful and delicate. I was a little hesitant w/ using the clam juice, but I did and it was great. The sauce kind of stinks when you are making it, but it is really good. I added 3-4 minced Thai Chilis for heat and it gave this dish a nice heat. Paired w/ Ginger Rice, and also stir-fried snow-peas and carrots. I will make this often (I'd add just a little more lime)

This was easy and delicious... with the right equipment. Perhaps my pots are not big enough, but I could not fit a glass pie dish into any of my large pots and close the lids. Thankfully, I was able to borrow a steamer. I thought the mixture a bit too lemony, so added a bit more soy sauce with good results.

This was a huge hit at our First Day of Spring dinner. I did some substitutions as well given lack of clam juice (white wine) and roasted sesame oil (ground nut oil). to no ill effect. After a Bibb & Tarragon salad starter, I also served roast asparagus w/feta, along with rice w/ lemon grass & spring onion. In keeping with the spring theme, dessert was Blueberry Rhubarb Crisp with Pistachio Crust (blueberries frozen from last summer). The fish won rave reviews from our guests & I doubt we will be able to wait until next spring to try it again.

the cilantro, lime, and ginger combined wonderfully in this dish. i was a little hesitant about the steaming, mainly because my partner prefers richer preparations like sauteeing and frying, but it came out very flavorful. i followed the recipe exactly and am delighted to have such an easy, healthy weekday meal in my repetoire.

This recipie was delicious. I used Mahi Mahi, and steamed for about 20 minutes. I couldn't find fish oil, so I just left it out. It was still amazing. I paired it with roasted asparagus and it tasted healthy and delicious. Pretty easy too!

This was very good, and easy to do. It was also very forgiving of slight overcookng. I didn't have any clam juice, so I used mango citrus sauce and white wine.
