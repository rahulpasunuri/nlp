This is a great simple recipe I've made many times. I've used soy sauce instead of salt when I don't use filet with great success with the sesame seeds. I wanted to review because if anyone is concerned about how strong the green onions are for the bite/breath factor, this also works very well with asparagus tips and/or slivers of red/yellow bell peppers for color.

I used top sirloin instead of filet mignon with EXCELLENT results. We just threw it on the grill for a few minutes. I had to resist the urge to marinate or add olive oil but, am so glad I kept it simple. It turned out really well and got rave reviews.
