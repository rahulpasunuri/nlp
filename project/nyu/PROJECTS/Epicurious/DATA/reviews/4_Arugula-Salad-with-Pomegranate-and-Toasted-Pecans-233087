Made this salad as an accompaniment to my impromptu Easter brunch. It is a quick fix, and a refreshing compliment to the egg white omelette with asparagus as well the bagels & lox which I served. The dressing has a tremendous body, so the addition of any kind of cheese is overkill. If you don't love arugula, and I love it, you may want to consider making another salad.

Made this for Rosh Hashana, won't make this again. The eater must take extra effort to pick some pomegranate on every bite or it gets too bitter.

What a delicious and simple to make fresh salad. I used candied pecans and added a few pieces of goat cheese. This was a perfect complement to our beef tenderloin we served with creamed spinach. Light and fresh, yet very flavorful. Nice color combinations for the holiday season.

Really good recipe. Used good quality aged basalmic. I used candied pecan recipe also on Epicurious. It is a good foil for the tartness of the pomegranated. Will try orange slices next time too.

I was trying to replicate a fabulous salad I recently had at a nice restaurant in Sonoma. In addition to the arugula, pomegranates, and nuts, the salad I had also had shaved fennel, frisee and baked goat cheese. Try some of those ingredients if you want to add some complexity and texture to your salad. This recipe is very good but not quite as good as the one I had in the restaurant. I must admit that is a pretty high standard to meet/beat. The people who ate my salad loved it, since they probably did not have any of the preconceptions of it that I had. The restaurant used a red wine vinaigrette so I will play around with this dressing until I get it closer to what I had. I think a little acid and sweetness might help. Next time I will probably add a little more red wine vinegar, try lemon juice and a little honey.

I fell in love with this salad when it was served at a friend's house on Thanksgiving day. Not only was the combination of ingredients delicious, it made for a beautiful festive presentation. When I made it tonight at home, however, I tossed it with a dressing made out of olive oil, red wine vinegar, and a couple tablespoons of orange juice, which was outstanding, especially with the pomegranate juice that trickled from the seeds.

I have to say that while I WAS looking for healthy dishes for my Thanksgiving dinner, I was slightly skeptical about this salad. With such few ingredients, it seemed to me that it would be bland and unexciting. I decided to give it a whirl anyway. Wow, was I surprised! The flavors in this salad combine so nicely that they come together in complete harmony. Even the non-salad eaters at the table were excitedly eating it. I thought the dressing recipe was perfect but I just added as much dressing as I saw fit as opposed to adding the entire batch. The arugula leaves were barely coated, but just perfectly flavored, in my opinion. I also added some Feta crumbles to each bowl but I would take them or leave them in the future. I didn't think they were needed although some people really liked having them in there (and by the way, I usually love cheese in my salads). The colors were really beautiful too. Will definitely make again!

Great recipe. I made simple salad for the kids and they preferred this. I added goat cheese just before serving

Delicious. There is an easy way to removing the seeds from a pomegranate. Cut the pomegranate into 4 pieces and fill a large bowl with enough water to cover the pieces when they are submerged. Then peel the flesh off underwater. The juices won't splatter onto your clothes and stain them. Then you can just use a strainer to get the seeds. Hope that helps!

This a a beautiful and simple salad with the exception of seeding the pomegranate. The dressing is delicious. The only change I made was to increase the portions of pomegranate seeds and pecans. I will definitely make it again at holiday time. Yummy!

I made this for Thanksgiving tomorrow, but took the time to taste test it tonight. The dish has great visual appeal and I think will cut all the fat in the rest of the dishes destined for the table nicely. Although taking the seeds from the pomegranate is a bit time-consuming, it's well worth the effort! I'm not sure how Persephone managed to eat only six. They're so pretty! Alterations: -Used toasted almond slices instead of pecans (I'm allergic!) -Added mustard to the dressing and omitted the red wine vinegar -Baby arugula I'll definitely make this dish again.

This recipe has made an arugula fan out of me! I used Trader Joe's pomegranate seeds, so it couldn't have been any easier. I toasted the pecans in my toaster oven for 7 minutes, maybe a tad too long as a couple got scorched but not too badly. I made a half recipe and used half a 7 oz. bag pre-washed arugula. I thought the amount of salad dressing was perfect and I really liked the flavor of it. Yum!!

This salad was the hit of my dinner party last night! I used fresh pom. seeds from Trader Joe's. I did not need all of the olive oil called for and I added a little more red wine vinegar. I added goat cheese, which I feel that it really needs. I ended up making a second batch as people begged for more! Think it would be perfect for spinach as well!

This is a great salad to serve with richer dishes. The peppery arugula and slightly tart pomegranate are nice counterpoint.

This is a perfect holiday salad. I did use 1/2 spinach and arugula plus just a tad more vinegar. The other time I added some avocado which was pretty good as well.

Really good and easy, except for getting the fruit from the pom, but i will try the submerged method that one reviewer mentioned next time. i liked the idea of goat cheese that another mentioned, but didnt have any so i used some crumbled manchego and it was excellent!

I added crumbled goat cheese, and it was much better this way! A bit bland without but good as a palate cleanser. However, adding the goat's cheese makes it more of a dish (starter perhaps) or for lunch with soup.

I liked the pomegranate seeds and toasted pecans, but wasn't impressed by the vinaigrette. We also substituted baby spinach for the arugula, since my family does not like arugula. Might use the seeds and/or the pecans in a salad, but will not repeat the recipe.

Excellent salad! Count me in on the "too much dressing" tally though.

Delicious! I added some thinly shredded red cabbage for additional color. Could easily become a main-dish salad by adding chicken breast too. I agree with an earlier reviewer who noted that this makes too much dressing.

Excellent and simple to make. Pomegranates were just out of season so had to use dried cranberries. Delicious nevertheless. We used half baby spinach and half arugula and loved it that way.

To all of you raising spoons to your pomegranates, try the underwater method. Put a deep bowl in the sink and fill it mostly with water (tepid--so it is comfortable for your hands). Quarter the fruit with a big sharp knife (sharper = fewer spatters) then take each quarter and hold it under the water as you bend it inside out and separate the pith from the seeds. The seeds will sink and the pith will float to the top. Periodically, skim off the pith and put it in the garbage. You may still have some of the little white things on the tips of the seeds, which you will want to pull off, but your clothes will be better! I put three forks, just because we like this better with spinach. (Arugula is a little peppery for my husband.)

I would make this dish again, but if you're like me and don't like drippy salad, then I advise being judicious about how much of the dressing to automatically dump on it while preparing as per the recipe's instructions. I found the amount of dressing made for the recipe was too much for the amount of salad. Next time I will serve it on the side. Nice recipe, though. Would be good with orange sections too.

By the way, that "preview" (of your comment) doesn't work. Now I feel like an idiot! Oh, well. I don't think I'll be rating this one any more. But do try it- no matter how you get the seeds out.

Sorry I scared you off from using this method, Houston. It's really not that messy! I find that putting a deep bowl in the sink gives me a good angle for smacking with the spoon and contains any spatters. It's really quite effective, especially if your therapist is on vacation...

Hello, Houston. It's really not that messy; I put a deep bowl in the sink because that gives me a good angle for smacking with the spoon and contains any spatters. But it's perfectly safe to do in the house, and works like a charm. I had lifted that advice from another site. Sorry if I scared anybody off!

Cutting the pomegranate in half on the equator is a fine way to start, I agree, but when I read the reviewer's advice "preferably in a sink or outdoors. [This can be a messy operation.]" I realized I could not bring myself to whack a $3 precious intensely-staining fruit with a spoon. As with many short-cuts, there's a trade-off of waste... Just taking one half and breaking it into little sections as they naturally separate in your hand saves more seeds. The concept of inverting the outside peel from concave to convex (by hand) does help. I'll be trying this recipe again as written. I tried lemon olive oil because I love lemon with arugula, and had only white wine vinegar and honey-toasted pecans. I would like to try a less-sweet version as written. But it's hard to go wrong with these sorts of ingredients. I'm a big fan of the simple arugula lemon olive oil salad on this site.

From "inpraiseofsardines": First, cut off the little tiara that sits on top of the pomegranate and cut the fruit in half across its equator. In each half, cut 4 or 5 one-inch nicks in the skins along the side where you cut, forming the beginning of a star. Place one half in the palm of your non-dominant hand, cut-side face down over the bowl, preferably in a sink or outdoors. [This can be a messy operation.] In the other hand, hold your spoon, with the back facing down. Whack the pomegranate firmly with the back of the spoon. Voila! Most of your fruit's juicy jewels will be laying in the bowl, still intact and surprisingly unharmed. When you're done, manually dislodge any seeds that cling to the membranes of the fruit. Also pick out any stray bits of the bitter membrane that have fallen into the bowl.

Based upon the glowing reviews, I made this for Christmas dinner. Though the pomegranate seeds added a festive touch, the salad itself was just OK. Given the work it takes to extract seeds from a pomegranate, I won't be making this salad again...
