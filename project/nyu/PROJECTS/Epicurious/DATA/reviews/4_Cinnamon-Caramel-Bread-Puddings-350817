Excellent bread pudding! Made exactly as written. I used my immersion blender to blend the eggs mixture with the orange peel. Really mixed it well. Made in one large baking dish. I made my own carmel using the salted carmel on this site.

Delicious, "professional" said my dad a dessert connoisseur but i thought too citrusy. Would only add a fraction of the orange zest next time.

Delicous - my dad (a dessert conniesseur) said "profssional" but next time I will add only a 1/4 of the orange zest bc it was way too citrusy tasting.

OMG what a delicious dessert! Instant hit with the boys in the house... and me :) Husband - "Quite possibly the greatest dessert I've had in a very very long time" I accidentally added the full amount of cream to the mixture but it tasted great nevertheless. Also added a sprinkle of cinnamon on the top before it went into the oven. I'd definitely make this again, maybe with a dash of brandy for Christmas! 4 forks * 5 stars * Excellent!

I made this one pan with the water bath (2x now) and it is outstanding. No trouble getting rid of the full recipe. Worth making your own caramel sauce if you have time - I like to add a bit of cointreau to mine

I've made this in one pan (2x now) and it is outstanding. Do make sure to use the hot water bath. Worth making your own caramel sauce (I like to a bit of Cointreau to mine)

Any thoughts about making this in one pan (I'll probably cut the recipe in half) as opposed to ramekins? As long as I make sure it's in the hot water bath, do you think it would be okay?

Very good and very easy. Would definitely make again. Tasted like "Christmas". I put bourbon and some honey in the whipping cream before beating it. The caramel sauce and bourbon whipped cream were wonderful together. Like being able to prepare beforehand and then bake before dinner.

I've made this twice already - once as a test run and then again for Thanksgiving. Both times the bread pudding turned out great. I like that I can prep it the day before and just bake it the next day. Flavors blend nicely altho I think I'll add extra cinnamon next time. Both times the puddings took 40 mins so watch them carefully. This is so easy to make.
