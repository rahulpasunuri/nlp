I made this for a large gathering and it was well received. If you have a good mixer it really doesn't take all that long- maybe 2-3 hours. Is impressive. It's the whiskey that brings out the flavors.

This looked very nice, but I found the cake rather tasteless. The filling is what makes it. This is the first cake in a long time that I had longlived leftovers that I threw out, since I was tired of eating it. It was OK, but I think there are far more interesting choices out there.

This was certainly labor-intensive, but entirely worth it! What a delicious combination of flavors. The cake was light and sweet, almost like a sponge cake (thanks to the whipped egg whites). Used a touch extra bourbon for the filling. The filling makes this a truly memorable cake. Only change I'd make is to add a little more bourbon to the frosting. Scrumptious!

This recipe is almost identical to my family recipe, which has been used for generations. The only difference is we use raisins instead of cherries and apricots, and--most importantly--we ice the cake with the filling (no cream cheese frosting). I just used this recipe for the first time and the cake turned out beautifully. Just one point--do NOT chill the filling. Maybe I'm reading the recipe wrongly, but it appears to call for chilling the filling for 4 hours. If you do this you will not be able to spread it. Overall, YUM!!!!!!!!

an amazing presentation but VERY labor intensive. I call it the "2 day cake"

What a grand cake! This recipe is labor intensive, but the results were great. I suggest making the filling first as it has to soak for several hours (I let my fruit soak in the bourbon over night and made the cake on day 2). Also I made the cake in 3 layers, not 4. Four seemed like overkill and three still got ohh's and ahh's when I unvieled it at Christmas dinner. I cut dried apricots in half and stood them on end on the top and added pecan halves around the outside. I also shaved some white chocolate curls for the top and dusted with nutmeg for color. I was a hit and I would make again, but only for a special occasion since it takes so much time.

Made this and loved it, however I made some changes to it and I don't think I would have liked it as much otherwise. I cooked the apricots first to soften them and as for the chocolate I melted white chocolate and poured over the fruit instead of using the pieces the recipe called for. The cake was a total success during Christmas dinner.

Just finally reviewing this - made this for the finale to Christmas dinner. It was a huge hit! Our family and friends are all big foodies - two are professional bakers - they all thought it was excellent. It is very rich, so keep the serving size modest. This is a new tradition for the holidays in our home.

Made this for a work holiday party. It was delicious and looked beautiful (just decorated the top w/pecan halves and a sprinkle of nutmeg). It IS time intensive, though. Paying close attention that the cakes don't get too done & dry is important. I missed adding the butter to the egg yolk mixture at first and had to strain the burnt pieces out before adding the butter, but it still turned out good. It's enough work to only make this for special occasions, to me.

I've made this cake serveral times. I've used serveral kinds of dried fruit for the filling, and it's always turned out fabulous. My father-in-law usually doesn't like cake, but he managed to eat 3 pieces of this one.

Have to admit I used boxed white cake mix as the filling and frosting was plenty of work for me. Made this for my book club meeting (Lane Cake is mentioned more than once in "To Kill a Mockingbird" - Scout mentions that she gets "tight" from the liquor!) and it was a big hit. I used the full amount of liquor, but used whiskey instead of bourbon. The particular mixture of soaked fruit, coconut and chocolate seems strange at first but works really well with the cake and frosting. I decorated mine with pecan halves around the top rim of the cake and filled the center with chopped dried apricots. Great old-fashioned special cake that makes a beautiful showing.

I think this is a fantastic cake, both in flavor and presentation. My husband didn't care for the bourbon flavor, so I threw away the recipe after I made it the first time. I have spent hours on the internet looking for it, because I must make this cake again!

This is a stunning cake. It presents beautifully and is delicious. I was surprised that the bourbon worked so well. One caution, do not overbake the cakes, they can dry out quickly. Other than that I would change nothing.

I've searched 32 years for this cake. It tastes just as wonderful as our wedding cake. I doubled everything and make a fabulous birthday cake for my husband's birthday party.

I'm giving this recipe 4 forks because it produces a truly extraordinary cake. There is nothing like it. For some reason, the icing didn't thicken, so I ended up with a drippy "glaze." Hopefully I'll get better results when I make it again. At first I thought that the bourbon would be too overpowering, but it wasn't - it added just the right "kick" and put this cake in a class by itself.

I found the amount of bourbon in this cake to be tongue-numbing. I really couldn't taste any other flavors.

Incredible! I made this cake (following exact recipe) for Christmas dinner, am just now getting around to writing a review, and can still remember how fabulous it was. Might not be able to wait until next Christmas to make it again! Next time, however, I may cut back a bit on the bouron because I felt it was a little overpowering. Definitely worth the effort.

If you have a ton of free time, this is the recipe for you. The ooh and ahhs from your guests is worth the aggrevation. I thought it was great a great cake. Icing was the best part. Sort of on the rich side but in a good way.

Made this for our annual Christmas party. Guests were a bit intimidated/impressed by the size and presentation (and unaware of what a Lane cake was). But once they tasted it, they all loved it. Truely impressive. Did not/would not change anything.

I made this for my family's Christmas get-together and everyone was thoroughly impressed. I thought the bourbon in the fruit was a little strong, but no one else minded! It took a long time to make, but it was definitely worth it. The frosting is delicious (we used one tbsp. instead of three).

This is now a Christmas tradition at my house. It replaced my beloved Southern Living Lane Cake recipe, and that's saying something. A pain in the ***, but eminently worth it.

It is perfect just as it is. The frosting is the best ever -- I will use it on other cakes. It is not too rich, and the cream cheese gives stability to the whipped cream. Craisins were a perfect replacement for the dried cherries which I couldn't find.

This cake is huge! it would probably serve about 20. Very good, just as is, it looks beautiful when cut.

My, what a cake! I made this for my mother-in-law's birthday and astounded all our guests. Best, the leftovers went into work with my husband and received many more compliments. I did make a slight change in that the frosting was 'only' whipped cream flavored with bourbon as I thought the cream cheese version would be too rich. I also used cranberries in the place of cherries which added a nice snap to the filling. Decadent!

This was an outstanding dessert--not too difficult and a great way to impress your guests!
