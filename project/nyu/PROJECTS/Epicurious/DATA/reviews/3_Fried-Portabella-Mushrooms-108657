This was a complete waste of good mushrooms. I followed the recipe exactly and found them tasteless, quickly too cold, and just an overly oil-tasting blah. I love port mushrooms - I use them in many recipes - and I love good fried foods, so I thought this would be a great combo, but these were unpleasant: the mushroom absorbed too much of the oil, and as ports are thick mushrooms they just were soggy on the inside while perfectly crunchy on the outside, making for a disappointing bite.

The recipe as is looked too bland for my taste. I used an off the shelf Italtian bread crumbs and added a hefty amount of Parmesan Reggiano. The results were a big hit. I think we have a new family favorite. They taste as good as stuffed mushrooms with a lot less work.

These were a bigger hit then I thought they would be! I keep getting requests for them so I keep making them. I serve them with a nice dip, but most people love them without the dip. The rye bread is the secret!

I make these ALL the time! They are simple and good. Don't forget to squeeze the lemon on top. It makes all the difference and you'd never know it!

This was just okay. The kids at the party I made this for seemed to really like them though. Maybe the recipe just needs a few tweaks - it could definitely do with more flavour for one. And maybe a nice blue cheese dip would be nice too. Overall, worth a shot - you might very well like it as is or with some alterations.

This dish was great. It was a hit at home with my partner. The portabella is a nice firm mushroom that holds up to frying. Great holiday food.

dude, heinous? these were great, why NOT fry mushrooms? everyone loved these, and surprisingly, everyone picked up on the rye as the special ingredient.

Nothing special about these! I had to serve with some sour cream, boursin etc dip just to have some flavor.

These 'shrooms were an instant family hit, from Grandpa to young ones. VERY quick and easy to prepare. Would add salt and pepper to breading, but otherwise were flavorful and unusual!
