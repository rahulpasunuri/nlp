After reading the reviews, I knew there might well be a problem with the peaches being too juicy. This is how I solved it: I followed the recipe up to the 20 minutes of cooking the caramel and peaches on the stove, and at this point realised that there was no way the peach juicey caramel was going to thicken. I removed the peaches and poured the liquid into another saucepan, and reduced this liquid down until fairly gloopy, about 1/4 of its original volume. Then I poured this back into the tarte tatin dish, added back the peaches and baked the tart as per the recipe. It worked absolutely fine. The finished tarte was delicious, if a bit sweet for my tastes. I would probably cut the caramel mixture in half next time. I did add a little polenta to the pastry instead of some of the flour (replacing about 1/4 flour), to help soak up the juices, which worked well.

The tarte tatin tasted great. I had no problem with the flip. I do think I did something wrong because it was very soggy. Almost immediately the crust was mushy. Is that how it is suppose to be? The crust did not hold up like a typical tart.

I was looking for a simple dessert to make with left over peaches and this was perfect. I made a little less than half a recipe and made it in my smallest cast iron skillet - perfect for three of us. I still had extra crust and a few peaches, enough for a sparse layer, so made a second. I did overcook the caramel on the second and then let it cool too long and had to reheat a bit before I could flip it, but it still turned out yummy.

This dish was easy to make. The pastry dough is great and I use it for other things like crostata. Flipping the dish was easy and certainly not something to have anxiety about. Fab, would make it again.

I prefer Apple Tarte Tatin, but this was yummy, too. I changed the recipe the first go through, thinking the peaches would be too soft and brown, and ended up with firm peaches in brown sweet water. Next I followed it to the letter, and it was a success! My guests asked for seconds.

My husband's favorite dessert is a Peach Tarte Tatin. I use puff pastry for the pastry and arrange the peaches in a beautiful fan. The flip is never a problem. If a couple fall out of place, you can see right where they belong and your creation stays wonderful! I haven't tried this particular recipe yet, but if all else fails - try some variations.

Made this last weekend with some excellent local peaches and it was a success! The flipping was scary, but I didn't drop it and the juices had firmed up to make a great filling. The pastry was very easy (I've always been intimidated by pastry making) and I will use the pastry with other fillings.

I was able to follow the recipe exactly and had high hopes but was disappointed. I don't think peaches are the correct fruit for this tarte. Mine were WAY too juicy after all and there was NO way I could flip the pan over for serving. There was at least 1.5 cups of fruit juice that would have flowed all over the table. Apples would supply enough pectin to keep the project contained in the pastry. The flavor was great though. The fresh citrus peel in the crust was a nice surprise. This makes me want to find Julia Child's original tarte tatin.

I won't rate this recipe since I haven't made it, but I have made tarte Tatin (Julia Child's recipe in "How to Cook") and I have a few comments. Tarte tatin is not an easy thing to bake. It isn't rocket science, but you do have to get the consistency of the caramel just right. If you cook it down too much, it will stick and refuse to unmold; too little and it is too juicy and goopy. Cast iron is nice, but an ovenproof no-stick pan will ease the unmolding process. Good luck to all.

To the cooks from Europe, I had the opposite problem with measuring while in England. I had to convert to my American measurements! Just a thought on this recipe...if it's too messy for some when it comes to the flipping, perhaps it could be made like a rustic tarte. Roll out the dough, scoop the fruit into the middle and fold up the sides over it (it will not cover the fruit completely, just the sides) and then bake it. Has anyone tried this?

Tarte Tatin is a tarte that comes from a small town south of Paris, near Orleans. I happen to have visited some friends in this town, and when I was there I had some tarte Tatin. While I was enjoying the tarte my friends told me a cute story of how this recipe came about. In this same small town, there is a hotel and restaurant run by the two Tatin sisters. (The hotel is still there today, near the train station.) One of the sisters greets the guests and the other sister is the chef. One evening the sister working as the chef decides she is going to greet some of the guests. She is having such a great time with the guests that she isn't paying attention to her baking. When she takes her apple tart out of the oven, she realizes that she has made it upside down. Unfortunately she doesn't have time to make another tarte, so she flips the tarte over and serves it. Of course, the guests love the tarte and the Tatin sisters have been serving it that way ever since. Whether this story is true or not, I don't know. But it's cute, just like the town, the name of which I can't remember. Maybe somebody knows and could remind me.

I have all the cast iron skillets and the butter marked into 1 tablespoon portions and a ton of wonderful Colorado peaches! But this recipe is just too hard to make and not as good as my husband's wonderful sour cream peach pie!

To the cook from Switzerland, Being a European living in the US it took me years to figure out the crazy american measurements myself. But here are answers to your questions: a cup = 250 ml; one stick of butter is 1/4 of a pound (454 g); the are 8 table spoons to a stick (here they are marked so you dont have to actually measure them!). Furthermore, you can look up metric conversion on the internet at http://www.convert-me.com/en/

There is no difficulty at all in turning the tart over...I used a round board with a rim, so any spare juices didn't escape. I think reviewer Nr. 2 is probably not someone who enjoys cooking - it didn't take a lot of time to do and we all thought it was delicious. The arrangement of the fruit looks attractive. Just one layer of peaches is enough. I had to guess quantities as I have no idea what a cup or a stick is supposed to mean and HOW you measure a tablespoon of hard butter is beyond me....however, my guesses were fine. Instead of cider vinegar which I didn't have, I used cider and a few drops of wine vinegar and orange essence.

Sounds like the thing would be really hard to flip over and keep intact. I notice they don't post a picture of the whole thing -- just a single serving. Could it be their flips weren't successful?

This thing is a mess. Flavor is ok, but juice from the fruit makes the crust a sticky,sodden, paste. This recipe needs a major overhaul. I may take the time this winter to re-do the filling with the addition of cornstarch or tapioca flour or something. Good luck if you want to try it. Eat all of it immediately.
