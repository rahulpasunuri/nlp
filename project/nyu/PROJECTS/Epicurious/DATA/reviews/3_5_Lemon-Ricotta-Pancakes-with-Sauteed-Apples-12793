This was delicious, I didn't sautéed the apples, peeled them and cut them in slices and added a little water to the pot , once they were soft added a little butter and the rest of the ingredients. Pancakes are amazingly light and fluffy.

I love these. I griddle them at about 375-400 F and a little longer than the recipe states. A simple strawberry sauce is the best with these - thawed frozen strawberries pureed and simmered with a little maple syrup and lemon juice.

I really enjoyed these pancakes! I skipped the sauteed apples. If I made these again I think I would increase the amount of lemon zest to two full tablespoons. Texture and flavour was delicous.

I made them as the recipe stated with the apples and served them with pork sausage patties, real maple syrup and butter. It was fantastic!

These were great, the texture is like souffle and the lemon zest is just enough without overwhelming the flavor. I did make the apples although I wouldn't bother again...nothing special. If you have good applesauce in the house I think that would be just as good. I think they would be really nice with raspberry syrup...

I made only the pancakes. These were ok, but not amazing. The lemon flavor was great, but not sure that the ricotta cheese added that much.

Just finished eating a batch of these. They were great. Didn't do the apples. I think they would be great with any kind of fruit compote. I will include a little lemon juice next time. I did not find them runny at all.

I served these with a quick mixed berry compote, and they were truly light and delicious. A welcome change from our normal Sunday pancakes. I agree with the other reviews that the lemon quotient can be upped - I added the juice of half a lemon, and wouldn't mind a bit more.

We thought these were very good. I beat the sugar into the yolks first until very pale, and added 1/4 tsp lemon extract along with the other ingredients. Light and delicious! Served them with fresh cherries and a drizzle of brandied caramel sauce.

I underestimated how much time it would take me to get the apples cooked and mix all the pancake ingredients together. Breakfast started late but it was well worth it. Would definitely make again. Light and airy. Good amount of protein too.

agree with the other reviewers regarding texture -it's incredible, silky and moist. As a lemon lover though the flavor fell short. After I tested the first two pancakes, I went back and doubled the zest, added the juice from two small lemons (fresh off the tree out front) - and made a quick lemon glaze to dribble over before serving - these additions made them rival the lemon ricotta pancakes at Shutters in Santa Monica.

Made this again with regular lemons and blueberries. Still turned out perfect and light. These are my go to pancakes.

I had higher hopes for these pancakes, but they were just OK. The lemon zest isn't cooked enough like it is in baked goods, so I didn't like chewing on it. And I had used the microplane! Some bites had a nice flavor like an Italian ricotta pie, while others were bland. Inside has an interesting creamy texture. Think I'll stick with ordinary pancakes.

Just Fantastic! I am in love with these pancakes. I used Meyer lemons. I can't wait to make them again and add blueberries.

Light, fluffy and wonderful flavor. These are a big hit, I now keep ricotta cheese on hand just for this recipe...they are so good.

These are lemon-scented clouds! In haste, just used sliced, fresh peaches and a bit of amber maple syrup. Thanks to the cook who suggested trying them with buckwheat (I'll try half buckwheat half white flour to start)- I wouldn't have thought of it, but I can hardly wait to try the variation next time,

these are so yummy! we made them twice this week - both times with fancy, artisanal ricotta which is a little bit milkier and yet denser than your average ricotta - they are so light and delicious. they have replaced buttermilk pancakes in our house, i think, as the favorite weekend breakfast. we ate them with blueberries and gooseberries and grade b maple syrup.

Batter was a little thick, so I added some milk. Also, left out the apples and ate it with a blueberry maple syrup. YUM! These are very light, spongy and delicious. Not filling like normal pancakes.

Yummy! The recipe came out a little thick, so I added some water. The pancakes with water were perfect!

Delicious and light pancakes. I agree with the earlier reviewer who recommended adding lemon peel to the apples. My preference is to use an assortment of berries instead of apples.

Brilliant but I hesitate to call them "pancakes"; almost like mini souffles which happen to be cooked in a saute pan. Lovely delicate texture and subtle lemon topnote. The sauteed apples were a wonderful topping. My family has requested that I double the recipe next time!

Rating: 3
I would make this again without the apple topping. The pancakes alone were very light and moist. The lemon zest adds a nice touch to it but you miss it with the apples. I'm also not a big fan of apples so take my bias into consideratioin ;}.

I made this recipe as written, except I made it into waffles. They were light and tasty. It would have been worth 4 forks if they had been crispy, too, but I guess you can't have everything. Separating the eggs was worth the extra bowl.

We loved these. I made the recipe exactly as written.

Delicious--very light and lemony. I skipped the butter and used a nonstick skillet, and made a glaze with fresh lemon juice and confectioners sugar in lieu of the fruit. I would definitely make these again, and have already shared the recipe with others.

I don't usually like pancakes because you take three bites and you're full, but these I scarfed down completely! The flavors are lovely in both the topping and pancakes. The only thing I will say is that you might want to use a pancake mold if you are concerned about presentation. The batter is a bit trickier to handle than normal pancake batter because it is less dense.

My brunch buddy and I loved this recipe. We made only the pancakes, exactly as written, topped with fresh blueberries and just a drizzle of real maple syrup, fantastic and perfect for a summer Sunday! I'll try it with the apples in the fall. Beaten egg whites make the batter very fluffy, so I did have to spread it in the pan to get circular cakes. Don't miss the pinch of salt which appears only in the instructions. This recipe is not like regular pancakes at all - bright, creamy and completely un-stodgy.

Best pancake I've ever eaten. Made exactly as written, but substituted fresh strawberry sauce for sauteed apples. Yummmmmmm!

I really loved these pancakes. I only had three eggs but it didnt seem to affect the result. I also added 1tsp of baking powder to the flour before adding it to the batter, which gave a really nice 'fluffy' pancake. They go really well with the apples but I think they'd be even more delicious with a blueberry sauce. Will definately make again - yummmm!!

These were really good, although I modified them a little. I added some milk to the ricotta/egg yolk mixture to thin it out a little before folding in the whites, and added a couple of drops of lemon oil (e.g. that made by Boyajian) to enhance the flavor. The pancakes came out really thick and fluffy. Also, in place of the sauteed apples, I served them with sugared cranberries (made by tossing frozen cranberries with sugar and baking at 350 degrees for 10 mins, or until sugar melts and cranberries are thawed) which was excellent and made a very pretty presentation for a Christmas eve "breakfast for dinner" tradition my husband and I are starting.

This is great! I tried it the first time without the apples, and the second with. It is much better with the apples, it complements the pancakes really well. Yum!

My new favorite pancake recipe. I substituted buckwheat flour for the all-purpose and vanilla for the lemon zest. Thanks for the tip on using cottage cheese. I push it through a strainer before adding it to the batter.

Rating: 4
Heavenly! These are no ordinary pancakes! Made with cottage cheese, the texture was almost creamy. Do make the apples, as syrup is not necessary or desired, in my opinion, as syrup overwhelmes the delicate flavor of the pancakes. (Perhaps that is what turned the pancakes into "ordinary" ones for some cooks.)Also, the pancakes seem to taste best warm, not piping hot. So, this becomes a good recipe to make for guests or a crowd.

Rating: 3
Very good! Based upon reviewer commnents I decided to double the amount of zest added, and they came out very nice and lemony. The key to this being really good is also putting enough lemon in the apples so that the two sources of lemon balance each other. The apples were a bit of a chore to prepare, but I am not sure what other reviewers are talking about when they say these are a pain--so you have to beat the egg whites and zest a lemon? This only adds about three minutes onto a normal pancake recipe, so it hardly seems to be a big deal. I will make again.

so tasty, most definitely comfort food.

Considering the amount of effort involved, this recipe doesn't give much of a payoff. The pancake was rather thick and had some lemon flavor, but otherwise it was just a pancake. The sauteed apples were nice. I can imagine using them as a topping for ice cream or conventional pancakes.

I've been searching for a recipe for Lemon Ricotta pancakes since having them at Four Seasons, Seattle. The taste and texture have haunted me--and this recipe delivers! Worth every minute of zesting ALL that lemon (took two whole lemons for me) and whipping the whites. I substituted cottage cheese for ricotta, and used fresh berries instead of sauteed apples. This will be a standard company dish for us.

Rating: 0
this recipe produces a very ordinary pancake for the amount of work involved, ie, having to beat the egg whites separately and grate the lemon zest. the only positive thing i can say is that they are fluffy, and that i used up the ricotta in the fridge, but that's about all. very disappointing, unfortunately.

A delicious change to the original recipe. The pancakes would also be well accompanied by a mixed berry compote.
