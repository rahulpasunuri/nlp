Several people commented that this is too sweet. I think that's due to a misprint: the 2 tablespoons of brown sugar should be used to sprinkle over the beef,(I massaged it in,) and then no sugar should be added to the marinade. It's not too sweet, at all. I love Bulgogi and this is the BEST!!! Made it last night-still thinking about it today! To serve: take red leaf lettuce leaves, add the beef, that incredibly delicious dipping sauce, a little rice and some julienned carrots, (as someone else suggested-adds a nice crunch), and roll it up and eat. I can't wait to make this, again! We grilled it, but would be good pan fried, as well. Also grilled baby bok choy and peaches, to go along side. YUMMMMM

I've been making kalbi/bulgogi marinades for a while now. The ingredients are basically the same in all, but this recipe really stuck out to all of my diners. It was head and shoulders above the rest! I can't believe that teriyaki is more popular than this sauce. It will be a staple in my recipe box!

This is a fabulous Korean Barbecue recipe, especially for those that are inexperienced with Asian cooking. This recipe is easy and has the flavor you expect. The biggest challenge is going to be experimenting with different cuts  we tried flank steak and it wasnt nearly as good as the thin-sliced Ribeye. This is a quick marinade, so thinly sliced beef is a must. http://therecipetest.com/2010/04/28/korean-barbecue-beef/

I made this last night for 6 people - exactly as the recipe calls for. All of us agreed that the flavour was seriously lacking. It was just flat. Even the dipping sauce didn't brighten up the flavour. I wouldn't make it again.

Made this for dinner tonight and it was delish. Used an inexpensive cut of meat (ranch steaks) and sliced very thin--let it marinate a bit longer because the meat wasn't that tender to begin with. A quick sear on the grill, and we tossed it into lettuce wraps with some rice, julienned veggies (carrots and daikon), some cilantro and the dipping sauce. I also added some freshly grated ginger to both the marinade and dipping sauce--nice addition. This will go in our summer grilling rotation.

I just loved this recipe. I did leave out the kiwi and substituted brown sugar splenda for the regular, but it still produced a great tasting result. My boyfriend couldn't get enough of it..which is a complement since he is an amazing cook!

the recipe very much lives to the quote "Once you try Korean barbecue, it will become something you crave" Excellent recipe, we make it very often in the summer on the grill.

Easy and flavorful. I used a London Broil cut and let it marinate a bit longer. Will definately make again for a different spin on cookout flavors.

I almost never follow a recipe exactly and I eyeball rather than measure. Since I have a large family I usually double the recipe for most things it is hard to say how I changed it. I served this at work and at home and it got rave reviews. The meat was delightfully tender yet flavorful and the dipping sauce I modified a bit based on the ingredients I had on hand, and it came out delicious. (I used soy sauce, garlic paste I made, Sriracha, brown sugar and some water.) I am making it again tonight! We are addicted!

Cant quite get this to come out to my liking. Very important not to over-marinate the meat, especially if you use the kiwi. I reduced the sugar and it still tends to come out a little sweet, lacking zing, and a bit generic for my taste. Definitely works best in a lettuce wrap with lots of other ingredients.

I made this for both chicken and beef, and it was delicious on both. I did add the sugar in the recipe, rather than on the meat itself. Don't know what I missed by doing this though. I actually preferred it on the chicken, but both were very good. I do have one tip though----don't overmarinate the beef as it can make the beef have that weird stringy consistency from over tenderized beef. Next time I will marinate for less than the 5 hours I did (it was a dinner party and I was trying to get prepped ahead). I'd probably go for about an hour tops for beef. The chicken didn't suffer at all from the long marinating process.

a little too sweet. Would only put 1 tbsp sugar next time.

This was delicious! my new go to marinade. I put one tablespoon of brown sugar in the marinade and then only half a tablespoon directly on the steak. It was delicious but then, I don't think anything could go wrong with this.

This recipe completely lived up to the rave reviews - it was delicious. I have made it with and without the kiwi and didn't really notice any difference. Although I hate when people substitute ingredients, I used flank steak because I had it on hand and rice wine vinegar instead of Sake since I didn't have that handy. Because I used flank steak, I made sure to marinade it for a few hours instead of a few minutes. It was fabulous and the smell is to die for!

I have tried this recipe every which way - without kiwi, mixing all ingredients at once, bbqing the whole steak then slicing it - and no matter what I did it tasted fabulous. I like serving it with a cold noodle salad and kiwi for garnish. Enjoy.

I made the bulgogi without the dipping sauce, and it was wonderful. Like other reviewers, I omitted the kiwi, which worked fine. Depending on individual preferences, you may want to reduce the brown sugar: it was delicious, but I found it a touch sweet.

I make this recipe all the time. I don't even bother with the kiwi anymore and it's still great. I also just cook it in a regular skillet and then eat it with rice, kimchi and red or green leaf lettuce in packets like the author described. I am Korean and this tastes exactly like it should.

instead of garlic,use fresh grated ginger, adds more kick! but I used pickled ginger I had on hand, just as good..

delicious...easy and so tasty. You should try this dish. To the cook from Buffalo, on this website is Korean Barbecue Beef, Marinade 2. Same recipe without the misprint. Sprinkle sugar on the meat and then mix the other ingredients, without adding more sugar. Enjoy.

I thought this was alright but not what I'd hoped for. I did use plain white sugar instead of brown and perhapse this is a reason for my disappointment

Rather than a review, I have a question: Recipe states to distribute the SUGAR evenly on the beef. In the next step, you are to mix soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, SUGAR, sake, and black pepper. Sugar is listed only once in the recipe, yet called for twice. I'm wondering if the first step calling for the cook to sprinkle sugar on the meat is a misprint? Should it be salt? I'm interested in what others have done. Thanks

So delicious and easy. I used a cast iron pan to cook the meat and it worked well to give it that charred, bbq taste. I found that there was hardly enough dip for two people - maybe I reduced it too much or maybe you are supposed to eat less. But it's very delicious - I'll just have to quadruple it next time!

Like it says in the introduction, this dish has a flavor that you won't soon forget, and will crave for days to come. The key is thinly sliced meat and no fat. I marinaded it longer but im not sure if that matters. The one major change I did was cooking the strips on our indoor infrared Wolf grill. The heat that thing produces is really incredible and made the beef juicy yet brown. Mmmm good!!

This was just outstanding! You must use the Kiwi, it adds a great flavor.

Outstanding! Bought pre-sliced beef (for shabu-shabu) in the grocery and marinated for 30 mins. Didn't have kiwi so used pineapple instead. Perfect balance of flavor. A keeper!

AMAZING!! I used the marinade on a ribeye steak and grilled over wood. I have a new favorite marinade!! It really does a nice job tenderizing. i have been reminiscing about this one for days...mmmmmm....

Loved it. Used miso instead of soybean paste. Cut the recipe in half and didn't have quite as much marinade as I would like - next time I will make the full recipe.

FABULOUS!!! For those who want a lighter healthier spin just replace brown sugar with cane or maple syrup. Delicious, not to mention the aroma that fills the neighborhood.

I've enjoyed this in restauants for years. It's truly is the best beef recipe I have ever made. The kiwi tenderizing works like magic. I've substituted it for other marinades and shortened the prep time dramatically. (As in Carne Asada.) I added green onions to the marinade and garnished also with the same. Easy to make with any beef cut. I pan sauteed and it browned up beautifully. Sooooo tender. Served with short grain asian rice which had a wonderful round sensation.
