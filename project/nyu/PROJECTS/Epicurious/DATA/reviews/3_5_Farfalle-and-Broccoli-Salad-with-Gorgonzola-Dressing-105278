I used Mexican style sour cream since our family really enjoys it's consistency and flavor (maybe it's just more salty). The creamed in Gorgonzola made it quite lush and rich. I must smile at the "A Cook from Seattle" since I too have made what she did along side a fish dish. Hope this helps, All the best to you all.

I made this recipe but changed it a bit. I can't stand blue cheeses so I used feta. I also added dill that gave it a nice zing. I also microwaved the broccoli and dried it with paper towel. Fabulous! I'll make it again.

Easy to make and delicious! I made it one day ahead to mix flavors better and it was so good that our guests ate it more than once.

I cannot imagine how anyone could characterize this salad as dull. I made it for the first time many years ago and it is a favorite with my family. I make it once or twice every summer. It is a wonderful salad and absolutely delicious. It is easy to make and never fails.

This is an exceptionally dull recipe. After making it as instructed, it was too boring to serve. Added some lime juice and paprika to give it some flavor. Will not make again.

Great stuff... ignore those reviewers who whine about cheese. I added dried cranberries ("craisins", as the young'uns say), and a bit less mayo & sour cream than called for (for arterial reasons) - it was excellent, and kept just fine for 3 days .

I have made this dish twice, once with the cheese and once without. I must say I prefer it without the cheese...I found that the whole salad took on a grey-ish tint from the cheese- it looked really unappetizing. Besides that, I added some diced apple and some toasted walnuts. I also used frozen broccoli florets and skipped the stems. It was really a nice salad, minus the cheese.

Very good and easy to make. I used just broccoli florets and drained everything well. Tastes better the next day after the flavors have time to mix. I will definitely make it again.

Very good and easy to make. I added gorgonzola pieces in addition to the dressing to make it a complete meal.

I made this for an afternoon barbecue, and it was good at the start but very dry after it sat out for a while. Maybe it's not good for that kind of event, but it tastes great and is pretty simple to make.

This was not a hit. Other reviewers mentioned the texture, and that's what my group complained about. I used less gorgonzola than called for and still found both the taste and the feel unpleasant. I had high hopes that I had found a pasta salad with a different twist, but it went into the garbage.

I made this recipe pretty much as it was written, except i used just the brocolli florets, not the stems and then I added toasted walnuts. What I would do next time I make is to make sure I squeeze out the water from the cooked brocolli. I may add some diced apples too, since blue cheese and apples go hand in hand :) Or maybe some rasins to add some sweetness and color...Regardless of any additions, the original recipe is def a keeper.

It's definitely rich for a salad (next time I'll probably increase the vinegar a little to cut the richness), but I loved it. The celery and the green onion really add depth to the flavor of the broccoli and the blue cheese! I used Miracle Whip for the mayo, and it added a touch of sweetness. I drained everything well, so the resulting salad wasn't very watery. In fact, it was very thickly creamy, and the leftovers are wonderful!

Made this for a St.Pat's potluck (broccoli is green, OK?) and everyone liked it. I did make it one day in advance & thought that helped quite a bit. I only used about 1/2 the gorgonzola and it was still good.

I've made this salad several times, for several different kinds of gatherings. Its "mouth feel" (to be slightly foodie and geeky) is what sets it apart, I think -- the celery sets off the broccoli and pasta. Perfect for cookouts and for spicy food fests.

I've made it twice. Everyone always raves about it as long as they are blue cheese lovers as I am. Its easy to make. I followed the recipe as it exactly.

I own a food shop and this is a huge hit! We make it at catered picnic parties as well as in our shop. I love broccoli & bleu cheese-- so naturally, its one of my favorites! The broccoli will yellow, as is its natural tendancy-- so don't plan on serving it any later than 2-3 days after making it.

This pasta salad was wonderful. I made it for a group of six people, along with lots of other food, and it was almost gone. I thought that the gorgonzola dressing was going to be to over powering but it turned out to have just the right flavor.

Not great, sorry to say. I added a little fresh lemon juice to the dressing, but otherwise followed the recipe. The overall flavor was interesting, but it lacked color and the texture was was awful. I won't make it again.

Very good. Added the red pepper, as suggested by a previous cook. Next time I will probably add more of all the veggies and maybe some black olives too.

I made this last summer and have had 10 guests request it for this summer's party! They loved it and rememered it for a year! My biggest hit ever!

Absolutely fabulous salad. Loved the flavor of the gorgonzola. I steamed the broccoli instead of cooking it though, I also added red peppers and baby spinach. Everybody raved how great this tasted.

The blue cheese makes this salad unique! All the ingredients compliment each other.

Loved this recipe. Make sure you are a blue cheese lover, however, because the flavor is strong. Suggest tossing the pasta with the dressing only a couple hours before serving otherwise it gets too mushy.

Considering the yummy ingredients I had high hopes for this dish. I made this the morning of a casual BBQ and it was creamy and delicious. By dinner time the dressing had soaked into the pasta leaving a bland and pasty concoction. I would recommend making the dressing and the salad separately and tossing together right before eating.
