I really like these little cookies! I do them at easter and crown each with a dot of jam and a raspberry. A little dusting of powdered sugar and they make for a beautifully presented dessert.

Spectacular. Made these for Valentine's day, and they are perfect. Used Plugra for the butter cookie base, which was noticeably better than store-brand butter in my first run. Also reduced the sugar to 1 cup in the brownie part of the recipe after a too-sweet trial run, and used Ghiradelli chocolate bits and pecans. Great special occasion confection.

I make these every Christmas. I have become known for these brownies. My friends and family look forward to them all year. Splurge on the Plugra butter for the cookie bottom, you won't regret it.

This is a yummy brownie recipe. I took them to a BBQ today and had an eight year old tell me that they were the best brownies there. High praise indeed. I did find that it took longer than 1 1/2 hours to set up. While the taste was good, I really like the visual impact of the brownie the best.

The butter cookie base on this was fantastic after reading the other reviews comments i did shorten the cooking time to 25 mins instead of 30 As far as the brownie itself goes im not entirely sure about it. I used brown suger splenda instead of regular brown sugar as that is what i had on hand and that could have attributed to the taste. Also i think that the chocolate i used may have been to dark [i used about a 70% cacao] or it could have stemed from the fact that we only had almond extract in the house. So i will probably try the brownie part again next time i make these but i will make sure you use vanilla and a different chocolate to see if that makes the difference. on a side note i took half of it to work and those were gone with in 2 hours and they asked for the recipe to use for chritmas cookies so something must have been right

I made these as gifts for my friends this Christmas. Everyoen absolutely loved them. My mom liked them because they were delicious yet not to sweet. My friends loved the combination of cookie crust and brownie. They weren't my favorite ever but I agree they were good. I will definitely remember this recipe. Cookign it was a blast!

Alas, I "found" this recipe as part of the Editor's Pick for the cookie and bar recipes for the 10th anniversary contest, not through the standard recipe search. As such, none of the reviewer comments were posted. Such a shame, as after much effort and expense of ingredients, I overcooked the cookie layer and undercooked the brownie layer and just couldn't quite recover gracefully. Tossed the lot, as it was destined for holiday gifts, but certainly could not be used as such.

These were very good. The texture and contrast between the two layers really made these a standout. I squeezed by with using only 10 oz. chocolate (all I had in the cupboard) to no ill effect. I agree that the shortbread layer should be baked for 20-25 minutes only.

Intensely chocolately. I was worried that the cookie bottom would diminish the cookie, but it only enhanced it. These are among my favorite cookies ever.

This was very good. I found that, as other reviewers mentioned, cooking times did need adjusting. I baked the cookie base for a shorter time (~25 min), and then baked the brownie/cookie a bit longer (~23 min).

These are delicious! I topped each one with one or two holiday peppermint chips while cooling, prior to cutting into sqaures. I froze them to use in a couple weeks and have nibbled on them -even frozen they are a delight! The brownie recipe is very rich.

I love this recipe, it reminds me of my favorite cookies my grandmother makes me. The one thing missing from this one is raspberry jam. You put it on over the butter cookie, before adding the brownie batter. The tartness of the jam compliments the sweetness of the cookie. It really makes it!

This recipe is amazing! It cemented my reputation as a domestic goddess, a la Nigella, as well. I may have cut down the sugar content a bit in the brownie part, as I tend to do that to most recipes. Otherwise, try it!

The basic butter cookie dough is delicious. Use the Epicurious Triple Chocolate Fudge Brownie recipe instead of the brownie recipe indicated here and use the best chocolate you can find, such as Scharfenberger. Bake the butter cookie bottom about 5 minutes less. After adding the brownie topping, bake for about 25 minutes, then fold the flaps of aluminum foil over the edges of the pan to prevent the outer edges from getting too brown and continue to bake another 20 - 30 minutes. Be VERY careful removing from the pan, or you'll get a crack down the middle. These simple looking bars won out over much more elaborate cookies with family and friends.

Second time was a charm with this recipe. First time came hard and flakey. I cooked the butter cookie base for 23 min and the brownie for 28 and it came soooo good. My advice is don't wait until the brownie stops sticking to the toothpick or its ruined. I can't wait to share this one.

It is WAY too sweet. This is one of those recipes that call for twice as much sugar as needed.

Where to start? First, next time I will use heavy duty foil, because regular foil tore when I tried to lift out the uncut squares. Second, when I cut into the squares, the brownie part seemed really underdone, even though I had made and baked according to instructions. I ended up putting the whole thing back in the oven for at least another 25 minutes, and believe it or not, then they came out pretty well! I thought the brownie part masked the flavor of the bottom part, but my husband said they were a "do-over." I'd suggest putting toasted almonds instead of walnuts into the brownie part, and adding almond extract to the bottom part.

I used parchment paper over a greased cookie sheet instead of foil.The entire recipe made 2 dozen cookies. You have to keep the chocolate mixture warm because it hardens up quickly and won't spread easily.I also shortened the cooking times of both recipes. I think the kids at my son's school will think these cookies are pretty yummy. A nice change from the usual chocolate chip cookie.

I made this but the cookie part came out hard, like it was overcooked. I followed the dirctions on this so I don't understand why. I'm going to try it again but I don't think I'm going to cook the cookie part as long.

While I didn't think this recipe was anything special, my family loooooved it to pieces. the brownie part was great, I may have underbaked it, but it came out like a thick layer of fudge, and the cookie part is a delicious recipe. 'Twas pretty good over all.
