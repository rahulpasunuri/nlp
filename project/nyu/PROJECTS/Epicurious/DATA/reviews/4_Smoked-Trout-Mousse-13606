I have made this recipe many times already and it is always a success. I also coated the souffle dish with the black sesame seeds instead of coating the mousse later. I served it whole with toasts or crackers on the side. Fantastic recipe.

Stupendous! Only issue was getting the mousse to unmold properly. 1) dill needs to be finely chopped so that it doesn't prevent the mousse from sticking to it. 2) best to line the mold with plastic wrap, oil it, and unmolding will be a breeze. Careful about adding salt to what can be an already salty fish. I added a soupçon of lemon zest because it belonged there. If you have extra, 5-8 pearls of additional salmon roe on the plate as garnish will enhance each slice of mousse. Excellent New Year's Eve (celebration) appetizer.

Delicious, but don't add the called-for salt without tasting it first. Between the smoked trout and the salmon roe, this was plenty salty already. I'll double the recipe next time and freeze three ramekins. This is the perfect kind of looks-like-you-worked item to have in the freezer for when you need to take an appetizer to a party.

This is delicious by itesel or as part of the complete smoked fish trio. I like it with peppered smoked trout. Half the recipe works very well or the second ramekin can be very successfully frozen. I make it in plastic wrapped ramekins. So far I have passed on the sesame seeds.

This makes an excellent first course for a festive dinner, sliced into small wedges served on a salad plate lined with fancy greens. I used a large charlotte mold and doubled the recipe with no problems. I didn't have any black sesame seeds around, but it was fine without them. Guests asked for the recipe.

This is a very elegant, delicious appetizer. I coated the ramekin with the sesame seeds instead of coating the mousse with seeds afterwards, and it worked well. I served the mousse whole (to spread on crackers) and it looked really impressive. The color contrast between the red roe, green dill, and black sesame seeds is striking.
