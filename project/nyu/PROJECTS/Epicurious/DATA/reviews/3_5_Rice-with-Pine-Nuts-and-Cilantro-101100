A lot of subtle flavors going on here. I doubled the pine nuts and toasted them first. Used goat butter rather than olive oil....goes great with the flavors. Next time, I think I'll try jasmine or basmati for even more flavor. A keeper!

I have made this several times and its very good. I'm going to do it with quinoa tonight and see how that works. I just love fresh herbs.

This was fantastic. My husband just brought home halibut from Alaska and I made chimichurri sauce for it and had cilantro left over. This was a great go with.

So simple and tasty - will use over and over! Tonight I served it with the Shrimp and Mango skewers with Guava-Lime Glaze - what an incredible combo!

An amazing recipe with subtle flavor! I used a bit more garlic than called for, otherwise followed the recipe and used Basmati rice. Incredible! I wouldn't bother making it without the pine nuts though as one reviewer suggested below. They are the thrill of this recipe. It has been added to the short list of family favorites!

This recipe is wonderful! I've made it a few times now, and it's great every time. It helps if you really like cilantro, obviously, although I suspect you could use any favourite herb. Will definitely make again and again and again...

this dish was really good, and very easy. I love anything with Cilantro, and this was a very simple taste, which was nice. I didn't think the pine nuts added much, so would probably leave them off next time.

We thought this was really delicious--more so than I expected. The toasted pine nuts really added a lot to the dish. And, the combination of cilantro and rice was just great.

Not as great as it sounds.

My husband is "anti-rice", so I broke up some angel hair spaghetti and used that instead. This was delicious!!!!! I was out of pine nuts so I just sprinkled some (shelled) sunflower seeds on top along with some parmesan cheese when served. Wonderful - will definitely make again.

This turned out better than I expected. The cilantro and garlic gave the rice a nice aromatic flavor. I served it with skewers of bbq shrimp and beef kabobs. I would make this recipe again.

If you love cilantro you will love this recipe as a side dish for all type of dishes. I serve it often with the recipe for Spicy Grilled Salmon with Black Butter.

I love this site, I over estimated how much cilantro I need for another dish and had alot left over. I typed in cilantro and there it was an easy, few ingredient sidedish that was delicious.

I made the rice without the pine nuts. A great side dish, especially for cilantro lovers.

This is really boring, and a waste of both pine nuts and rice.
