Because I cut bigger chunks than recommended, I had to cook it longer. And while it tasted very good (and I used even less maple syrup than most) it was so dry you could hardly swallow. But with the addition of some chicken broth and a rough puree, what a delicious squash soup it made! Try it.

Used acorn squash and omitted the almonds. Excellent flavors, th8s will be a go-to dish for me.

This dish is excellent! I love the sweet and savory flavor with the squash! I might use replace the kabocha squash with more butternut next time because it was hard to cut.

Delicious. Served this with Cupcake Tin Pork Pies and a green salad with grapefruit, avocado, and beets. Couldn't find kabocha, so used the parsnips and doubled the butternut. As others suggested, I reduced the maple syrup to 3/8c. Had slivered almonds on hand, so used those in place of the Marconas.

This is exceptionally good! A favorite with teenage boys, if you can believe it. I use only half the maple syrup. Another change is that I put sprigs of rosemary rather than chopped. One thing to note -- 1 1/2 pounds of squash does not equal 2 cups. I use the amount of squash by weight and have about 5 cups of each. If I were to make only 2 cups of squash, the dish would be very small indeed and not worth all the work.

Great Christmas dinner side dish and this will now enter my regular rotation. Several guests remarked that they loved this dish even though they don't usually like one of the main ingredients. I followed the recipe but forgot to take the foil off until later in the cooking process. Came out wonderful anyway, although there was a bit of liquid in the bottom of the dish. I solved this with a slotted spoon to serve, and when all the squash was gone, one of the guests poured the juices on his plate.

Amazing! Very easy to make (well minus all the peeling) but so flavorful. Actually, it's the most flavorful yet still simple vegetable side I've ever made or had. Definitely one of the best parts of our Thanksgiving meal.

I've made this a few times before, and this year, my (very, very picky) mother-in-law actually requested it :). It's always a crowd-pleaser. I subscribe to the "reduce the maple syrup" crowd - I use a 1/4 cup measure and use a full measure plus a half measure (so approx 3/8 cups). The Kabocha squash can be hard to find - as others have said, buttercup is basically identical. It's also tough to peel - 3 mins in the microwave or in boiling water will make life much easier. Finally, I've stressed about the marcona almonds and gone across the city to find them in the past. Honestly, good, fresh, blanched almonds are all you really need (I toast them in a little oil and they're even better). The marcona's are lovely but they do not ultimately change the nature of the dish.

We loved this! I didn't have parsnips and chopped my almonds in smaller bits than the photo and really enjoyed this recipe. Will make it again.

Delicious! The kabocha squash is sometimes called Buttercup- it's the best! I do reduce the butter by a TBS or two, and I reduce the maple syrup to 1/4 cup because it is plenty. The parsnips can be too much on their own for some, but fit in beautifully here. I usually don't add the almonds and it's still terrific. To handle the cutting of the raw squash, I just cut them into crescent moon shapes (like a melon) and then use a vegetable peeler to get rid of the rind. It's a safe and easy method.

This was such a wonderful dish! I only used 1/2 of the rosemary which was plenty. I did not have kobocha squash available so I used sweet potatoes and it was perfect!

This dish was absolutely delicious. Couldn't find kabocha squash at the market so used acorn squash instead. My husband, who doesn't love squash or turnips, looked very skeptical when I was preparing the dish but when I served it he loved it and had seconds.

Was very much looking forward to this recipe, but was very disappointed. Not a huge payout for all the work involved. If you do chose to make this recipe, I recommend halving the amount of butter, syrup and rosemary. The flavors overpowered the subtlety of the delicious squash I worked so hard to peel.

Rating: 4
I loved this recipe and have made several variations on it, as well. The buttery but sweet flavor really enticed my husband, who has been very hesitant to try new vegetables in our CSA box. He didn't quite know what do make of parsnips and squash! We've used carrots, beets, potatoes, yams, delicata, parsnips, and butternut squash in this dish, and all of them were terrific!

We used only butternut squash and reduced the amount of maple syrup a bit and roasted on sheet pans for more caramelization to serve as a side at our Christmas dinner. So delicious. We did have some leftover that we puréed with chicken broth the next day for soup to serve with sandwiches.

Outstanding root vegetable dish! I made this last year and couldn't find the recipe to make for Thanksgiving. After searching this way and that I finally found it. I used butternut squash only along with onion wedges, parsnips, turnip, sweet potatoes and red skin potatoes. You can probably use most any winter squash as well as most any root veggies with the exception of beets unless you want everything a beautiful red. I made the maple syrup mixture exactly as directed. Be sure to figure in the necessary cooking time after removing the foil to evaporate the moisture and brown the veggies a bit. I cooked this in a half sheet cake pan. Be sure to use a pan large enough to spread the mixture out. This makes a lot of veggies but my family is very happy to be able to have them a second time. A huge hit and will be a regular dish especially at holidays.

Wonderful dish. Squash is hard to peel and does take a long time, but great. So, some variations - I made the squash as is but cut into very small dice, at end sort of rough mashed it, added 5 oz goat cheese and put into puff pastry for turnovers - amazing little creations, perfect for holiday party. As is, perfect for anytime but its hearty and rich so plan accordingly.

This was great. I made it for Thanksgiving this year instead of sweet potatoes. everyone loved it & even the most traditional did not miss the sweet potatoes. I followed the recipe exactly, no tweaking at all.

The butter-based sauce was absolutely delicious, but a little too sweet when combined with the already very sweet kabocha squash. Next time I'd use a little less maple syrup, but overall a fantastic dish.

This was fantastic!! A big hit with my whole family. My dad doesn't even like squash, but he loved this dish. The parsnips have a strong flavor, which I think are absolutely delicious, but if you have picky eaters in your family, carrots would be delicious as well. I couldn't find kabocha squash so I used acorn. I read the reviews and didn't quite cut the maple syrup in half, but didn't use a full 1/2 cup. I didn't cut the butter in half and that's the only thing I would change next time I make this. It was too buttery, but I'm also a health nut, so the butter was too much for me! The marcona almonds were a big hit. The crunch with the cooked squash was surprising and delicious!! This took a long long time to make, so I would suggest it only for special occassions, but it was well well worth it. There was not much left over, but the leftovers even heated up well!! Yum!!

Amazingly delicious. Seriously. The flavors blended in the most perfect way. Even my husband, who hates mixing sweet and savory, loved this one. Peeling the squash was a bit tedious, but other than that it was very easy, as well.

I discovered this recipe in the fall of 2008. It quickly became a must-have for Thanksgiving recipes, but I changed it this year for a "sugar-free" friend. I used agave nectar instead of the maple syrup because of its low glycemic index. I skip the pepper because its too hard on the digestive process. Wow! I'll probably never use maple syrup again. The flavor of the rosemary popped and the flavors of the squashes and parsnips were heightened as well. Fabulous!

Rating: 4
This dish was simple but very yummy. I used butternut squash, kabocha squash and carrots. On the recommendation of other reviewers, I used half the amount of butter and maple syrup and the dish came out perfectly flavored and not too heavy. Very glad I took the time to track down the Marcona almonds, they really made the dish - regular almonds wouldn't be the same.

Rating: 4
This was my first time having parsnips. They're really good! Nice and starchy, like potatoes, but with a slightly sweet aftertaste. I used some chopped leeks because I had some extra from a previous recipe, but it did not go well together. Also, I used olive oil instead of butter, dark agave nectar for maple syrup, and regular almonds. I made it on a BBQ grill because I don't have an oven at home, and after high heat for just 20 mins, it was ready. Well, I added the almonds and waited a few minutes before removing it from the grill.

This is good, but much too sweet with the suggested amount of maple syrup (as other reviewers noted). I will use half the maple syrup next time. Also, just a note for cooks in Canada - Kabocha squash is called Buttercup squash here.

Delicious - everyone loved it. Following other reviewers advice, I halved the maple syrup. It was sweet enough, but not all that maple-y. Perhaps maybe a little more would be better, if still not the full amount. Also, I used acorn squash instead of the kabocha because that was what was available. Overall, it was a great dish that I will definitely make again.

Tasty, unique flavor. Looks pretty and feels lite & healthy. I couldn't get a kabocha squash so I substituted with a chayote squash. Also, I used more salt, pepper, rosemary, garlic and almonds than what the recipe called for because I like all those ingredients. Lastly, after reading all the other reviews, I only used 1/4 cup of maple syrup. I over did it on the salt and pepper so next time I'd stick with the recommended amounts. Also, the other reviews seem to suggest that the kabocha adds a lot of sweet flavor. I think the key is to cut the syrup in half if you use a kabocha otherwise stick with the recommended amount. Mine was not sweet. Also, this is a labor intensive recipe! Especially if you have to chop the nuts by hand. Lots of chopping required!

Rating: 3
I made this, and it turned out pretty delicious. I made some of the changes others suggested, such as the reducing the syrup to 1/4C. I think next time I would substitute something for the parsnips; it was my first experience with them, and i don't think i like them. also, my roasting pan was a bit full and so the veggies didn't cook as evenly as i would have liked; next time i'll use a larger pan. the marconas were fantastic, and i agree that it would be difficult for me to substitute.

Rating: 3
Good recipe, great if you reduce the maple syrup by half or so. I've made it a couple of times with variations - substituting other ingredients: turnips for parsnips, hazelnuts for almonds, acorn squash for the butternut, sage for rosemary. But ya gotta keep the Kabocha - its the best.

Great recipe - big hit at Thanksgiving. Per other comments, I cut the maple syrup in half. Used all butternut squash and 'regular' almonds and it was wonderful. Prepared squash by parboiling for about a minute, then used a potato peeler to remove skin. Big hit again when I made it for a dinner party two weeks later!

Wow! I didn't realize such a sinple dish could be soooo good! I made it for a Christmas party this weekend, and I had to print out the recipe for some of our friends. Everyone raved about it. I didn't use the kabocha, just butternut squash and parsnips. Also, I used grade B maple syrup, it has a more robust flavor, and I cut down the butter and added olive oil. The biggest comment was the Marcona almonds; I almost used toasted sliced almonds (I had them on hand) but I'm glad I bought the Marconas.

I substituted baby turnips for the parsnips (based on the contents of my CSA Thanksgiving share box), and used Kabocha and Delicata squash and 2T maple syrup. The dish was very good. Since then, I've made it with other combinations of squashes, and with olive oil rather than butter. Despite the prep time, a keeper.

The dish is great for Thanksgiving and easily prepared ahead..allow LOTS of time and extra muscles to hack through the kabocha squash. I just found that the colors faded with cooking, so I garnished with some fresh rosemary on top.

Excellent dish. It was great to make everything the night before and refrigerate it overnight. I put in the car and took it to the in-laws for Thanksgiving and baked it there. I also cut the maple syrup and it was plenty sweet. I found all of my ingredients at Whole Foods. Their marcona almonds are over by the cheeses.

This was a great Thanksgiving dish that everyone really enjoyed. Also a nice winter veggie dish in general. Both times I've made it, I haven't been able to find kabocha squash, but acorn has worked well as a substitute.

Adding to my review: I did cut the maple syrup by half and it was not too sweet. The kabucha squash is almost impossible to peel so I roasted it just a tiny bit to soften the skin. The balance of the two squashes and the parsnips made for great flavor. The marcona almonds have a much better flavor and texture than regular almonds for this particular dish. They are not cheap but well worth it. They have them at Bristol Farms.

I made this for a luncheon today, and it was very well received. I did make a lot of modifications after the first batch needed a little help, IMHO. I cut back slightly on the maple syrup (about 1/8 cup), used twice as much salt, added the same amount of chopped sage as the rosemary, and a diced red onion. For the almonds, I tossed it with a teaspoon of salt, chopped rosemary and sage and about a tablespoon of melted butter. Peeling the kabocha squash was a nightmare, but it was delicious.

The melted butter sauce had an outstanding flavor, but coupled with the already sweet kabocha squash it was a little TOO sweet. I'd cut down the amount of maple syrup. Otherwise, AMAZING!

Downright delectable. The grocery store I went to did not have parsnips, so I substituted them with 1 cup sweet potatoes and 1 cup carrots. Butter and maple syrup aside, this recipe is loaded with vitamin A, vitamin C, fiber, and has a decent amount of calcium and iron as well. As a college student, I think this recipe is easy to make and friends will definitely enjoy it.

Kabocha squash is dark green and has a flattened round shape. It is not deeply ridged like acorn squash. Your produce person at the supermarket will know if you can get it or not. They're commonly available here, but may not be everywhere. I'm quite fond of kabocha (my favorite tempura vegetable), but butternut squash would probably work well as a substitute. Marcona almonds are Spanish and are larger and a bit rounder and flatter than California almonds. They cost more, are hard to find, and are usually more flavorful. You could substitute regular almonds; just make sure to buy them blanched (without the dark brown skin) since that's how they are pictured and how Marconas are usually sold. I may try toasting blanched regular almonds in a little olive oil before using them to try to capture some of the fatty flavor of the Marconas--but really, how could almonds be bad in this? Trader Joes was carrying Marconas over the summer, but I don't know if that is still the case.

My sister brought this dish to Thanksgiving dinner this weekend and we all loved it. It was absolutely delicious. Kabocha squash is a Japanese squash available in the autumn. Not exactly sure what is different about Marcona almonds but I wouldn't hesitate to use any two types of squash and plain old garden variety almonds. I will probably use 1/4 cup of maple syrup when I make it myself, and I will definitely make it again.

what is kabocha squash? and What are Marcona almonds? How are they diff. from normal, regular almonds? This sounds like a delicious recipe (although not very healthy with half a cup of maple syrup!)...but I'm stumped on 2 of the 10 ingredients. Help!
