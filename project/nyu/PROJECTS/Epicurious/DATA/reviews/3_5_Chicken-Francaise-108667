Was looking for a flounder francaise, and decided to try this instead, swapping out the chicken with my fresh catch of the day. Worked great, and tasted awesome. Just a few minutes per side for fish!

Until now this is a dish I really only enjpyed in restaurants but this recipe has changed that. Such a wonderful and fragrant sauce! I did add a spoonful of creme fraiche and a pinch of flour to thicken it but the rich flavours came right thru.

my husband loved this! he said one of the best meals ever! easy to make, just need to stay at the stove. would have used less egg and a little herb of some sort, but otherwise, with the right chicken (thin) it was really good. would definitely make again because he loved so much and is so fussy!

What I like best about this recipe, which I've used many times is that I cook and chicken several hours before and finish when dinner is being served, or guests arrive. Works well.

A great way to make the egg dip is too just break the egg yolks but do not make scrambled egg, add parmesan cheese to the egg mixture with parsley. This will give your battered chicken our flounder a great flavor!!! Mike

Great basic recipe. Wonderful as is (although I agree with a previous reviewer that the butter can be reduced with no ill effects) and very versatile. With the abundance of fresh herbs in my garden, I love substituting fresh basil or dill or tarragon in place of the parsley. I also like to add thinly sliced mushrooms to the sauce. Great with mashed redskin potatoes and a watercress salad!

I found it difficult to get the balance between tart and sweet right (I ended up adding about 1 tablespoon of salt), but when I served it over the chicken, it tasted just right.

I love this recipe, as does the rest of my family. We use the basic Francaise style for the chicken and have topped with a variety of things. I like it with an orange cranberry relish that I purchased from Williams-Sonoma. Yum!

This is a great recipe to have on hand for week nights or if you are having a few friends over for dinner. I have read to some of the reviews and the one thing i would say DO NOT do is cut back on the oil for cooking the chicken in. I have tried myself to cut back and have found that when you dont have enough room from the bottom of the pan to the top of the oil the chicken can not float and the egg mixture cooks on the to the pan. I have how ever cut back on the butter by a tablespoon (thats 100 calories) and have added a splash of light cream and flour at the end to thicken the sauce. I have also tried this with tilapia and flounder and LOVE it! I think it is even better with fish.

I have made this recipe too many times to count. It is a favorite in my household. I also wanted to add that it doesn't take one hour to make. It definitely is quicker than that. I add flour to my sauce to thicken it up. This way it clings well to the chicken. I serve either with rice, mashed potatoes or parsley potatoes. My family loves this recipe.

This is a great recipe. I've made it a couple of times and really like it. I took others' suggestions and double dipped with flour and egg and don't recommend it -- it was way too thick. I also made the sauce without the butter and it turned out just fine -- I just added more chix broth. I've used a dill and parsley combo, which was yummy!

This was a very easy recipe! I'm not sure why they said it takes an hour to start to finish, it took about half that time. I would add a little more butter in the sauce, but other than that it was delicious!

Great recipe and easy to make. I made a few changes to suit our tastes. I sautéd crushed garlic in the oil and butter and it really added a great taste. I also double dipped for a crispier batter and eased up on the lemon. Lastly, I would also recommend doubling the sauce.

I was rather surprised by the simplicity yet excellent taste of this chicken! I already foresee many remakes!

Rating: 3
Very good! I ended up adding various spices to the flour mixture, including white pepper and a pinch of paprika. Overall it turned out very well. Don't be put off if your sauce initially turns out too sour from the lemon and white wine, if you add some sugar it tastes just fine on top of the chicken and really helps to tone down the richness of the batter. Not the healthiest recipe but very good. My family really enjoyed it, especially my dad, who's not big on chicken.

This recipe was VERY easy and so delicious. As soon as I tasted it, it took me back to Northern NJ and Philly Italian restaurants. We can't get the same Italian food out here in CA like in Philly. I only gave it 3 forks instead of 4 because I'm not crazy that you have to fry the chicken. There's already 1/2 stick butter in it...speaking of butter...the details do not skip over the butter, like one reviewer thought, it's the first sentence in the 2nd paragraph. Because I'm not crazy about frying for health reasons, I actually baked it. Next time I may pan fry it (w/o lots of oil) until it's done. It wasn't crispy enough for me. I served it with polenta with pesto and green salad. YUM!!!

made this for my family, who did enjoy it, though the recipe overall ended up a bit lemony for my husband's taste. next time i'll reduce the lemon juice a bit, or possibly add a bit of sugar to take down the tartness. overall, though, i loved it and would make it again!

Rating: 3
Over all, I liked this recipe. I ended up doubling the portions for a larger family. The only issue that I ran into was that it took a long time to reduce the sauce to a consistancy that I liked. I did end up adding extra lemon as well. But my family loved this.

Rating: 4
I just finished making this for the first time. I got excellent reviews from husband! I used 1/2 flour and 1/2 drake's fry mix and double dipped coating for a slight crunch. Also added more chick broth as I was cooking to cut the tartness. Definitely will amke this again...easy, all ingredients usually on hand too.

Rating: 3
Terrific. I dredged in flour again after the egg to make the coating a bit more substantial. Doubled the sauce as others suggested but needed to add a additional whole stick of unsalted butter to balance the flavors. With these adjustments, it was delicious lemony goodness.

Rating: 3
I made this for my inlaws last night, who love chicken francaise. They thoroughly enjoyed this. I took some suggestions and doubled the sauce and made that in a separate pan. I think I would like it a little thicker, and may contemplate doing a corn starch slurry. My hubby really loved this also. Chicken francaise is not my all time favorites, but I do enjoy it. I thought this was good.

This dish has been a favorite of mine for a long time whenever eating out, and I was happy to find this recipe that most closely replicates what is served in restaurants in the North East. I read mostly all of the reviews here, just to be sure. No, it's not French, may be Italian, definitely Italian- American! If you are not from NY, NJ, Philly, you really must visit and sample this dish at a good (not necessarily expensive) Diner or Italian Restaurant. It can be prepared with chicken breast or veal cutlets, thinly sliced. I was lucky to find thin sliced chicken breast in my store.The flour and egg is key. The egg smoothes out the lemon. A couple drops of hot sauce in the egg adds a little something. Some chicken pieces, I double dipped (flour, egg, flour, egg), which was appealing to those with hearty appetites in my family. I made the sauce first, which was a good earlier suggestion. Don't make it with the pan juices, it's not supposed to be a brown sauce! That's why they say wipe the pan! Good wine is essential to a great sauce. Doesn't have to be expensive, but absolutely no "cooking wine"! A buttery Chardonnay is a great choice.(It will cut the lemon's citric acidity with its lactic acid.) So no need to add sugar, pu-lease. A teaspoon or so of drained capers may also help if your lemon was really sour. Add a little cornstarch if you want a thicker sauce. Deeeelicious!

Very good and fairly straightforward to prepare. I used "large" breasts and the pan was snug, and cooking was uneven. I'd use medium breasts next time, and a pan that will distribute heat more evenly. It's a pretty rich recipe, but paired with a light side this is a nice main course...and it gives you a reason to open a bottle of wine - as if you needed one.

simple, easy: will be a staple in our household from now on. to the cook from the previous post, the butter is used for the sauce after you fry the chicken. try it again, it will come out great!

What is missing in this recipe- it says 1/2 stick of butter in the ingredient list- but the directions tell nothing about what to do with it-is one is supposed to saute something because the sauce tastes incomplete. I really want to try it again but want a more complex sauce, like with herbs or garlic or whatever was left out of the recipe!

Rating: 3
This is one of my favorite types of recipes, a basic template-type recipe. There are a lot of variations on this dish (adding lemon at different stages, using cheese in the dredging mixture, capers, etc), but it's easy to make those changes to this recipe, and it tastes fantastic as-is. Personally, I like it with a touch less butter and more lemon in the sauce. It's easy to overcook the sauce, and then, WOW, is it rich. And I just love lemon. Capers are pretty good, too. I agree with one of the previous comments -- do NOT wipe the pan clean, as the wine and lemon will deglaze the pan beautifully.

A simple recipe and tasty. I've made it for years using either chicken or veal. Works well for both. My family likes it as written. Goes well with mashed potatoes and a simple green salad. Not difficult to make. Even the great chefs have their favorite easy recipes. Not everything a cook makes has to be labor intensive. A great dish for a cold night.

My husband & I loved this recipe. I've never had chicken francaise before so I don't know what to compare it with, but I think it had a terrific flavor! I actually added the chicken back into the sauce and cooked it for the last 6 or 7 minutes, which added even more flavor. Superb!

Rating: 4
No matter how you pronounce it, this is an excellent example of this recipe, tastes just like my mother-in-law used to make. Following her lead, after frying the chicken I placed it in the oven, made the sauce, then poured that over the chicken while still in the oven and let that steep for about 10minutes before serving.

Rating: 3
Francaise is pronounced "fran-says" because of the "e" on the end. And it is not plural. "Francaises" is plural. And if we were going to be really picky, the recipe should be called Chicken francais (fran-say), because chicken is masculine in french.

Rating: 4
This dish is every bit as good as my mother used to make. Yum! And I do smoke and (trust me) my tastebuds haven't gone bad. This dish is full of flavor and I would make this again and again. As far as the Maryland woman's question regarding pronunciation of the dish - that all depends on it's spelling. Different restaurants seem to spell it differently - usually a French spelling and an Italian spelling: 'Francaise' is the plural of the word 'French' (as in French people) in the French language and is pronounced 'Fron-SAYCE' (I find a lot of people mispronounce it 'Fron-SAY'. You almost never pronounce the last letter of a word in French. Compare it with the singular 'Francais' (a French person or the French language), where the 's' is silent (no 'e'), and that IS pronounced 'Fron-SAY'.) 'Francese', on the other hand, is an Italian word which also means 'French' (singular. 'Francesi' being plural.) My mother pronounced it 'Fron-KAY-za' or 'Fron-KAZE' (she corrected me often). The 'ch' sound is usually isolated to a 'ci' letter combination, as in 'ciao' and 'cioppino' (another awesome dish, by the way and is pronounced 'Cha-PEE-no'). I guess that depends on the dialect. I suppose you could throw a 'ch' sound in there and pronounce it 'Fron-Chaze'. But, I go with my mother's pronunciation (because she wouldn't have it any other way ;-).

Last night, after a lengthy debate over whether it's pronounced "fran-sez" or "fran-chez," my friends and I made this dish and it was fantastic! They've made this recipe before but they add their own twist to it. They make their own sauce for the pasta which is basically the francaise sauce but with some corn starch added to make it a little thicker (they also add mushrooms to the recipe). This is one of the most delicious restaurant-quality dishes I've ever had at home. Tastes great, it's easy to make, and it will impress the heck out of your company! Oh also, my contribution to tweaking the recipe is that I bought the Perdue thin-sliced chicken breast. There's virtually no cleaning involved and the cutlets are sized perfectly! Mangia!

I used this recipe for a Filet of Flounder Francaise. Other than the substitution of fish for chicken, I didn't change anything in the recipe except to throw in a tablespoon of capers at the end. The sauce was subtle and delicious- a hint of the egg came through, which is what you want. Those reviewers who felt that this had little flavor must have ruined their palates with heavy spices or smoking or something. Definitely a keeper- I'll make this again and again.

I made this for 6 and didn't change anything - it was plenty. I made the sauce according to the recipe, and it was great. I don't know why anyone would add sugar - it's not supposed to be a sweet sauce. The key is to use really good butter, and good, dry white wine. I added fresh parmigiano cheese to the flour mixture, using a previous reviewer's suggestion, and thought it was a waste of expensive cheese. Don't bother - just follow the recipe and it will be great.

Great, although I'll double the liquids in the sauce next time. My dish had to stay warm awhile, and sauce was reduced. One breast per person is ample because the dish is so rich.

This dish is AMAZING. My tweaks: I squeeze two lemons into a one-cup Pyrex, and top it off to just over one cup with white wine, and skip the chicken broth. Use a baster to get the majority of the oil out of the pan, but DO NOT wipe it out. Then, use the contents of the Pyrex to deglaze the pan and cook all the yummy brown bits into the sauce. Boil it down to 1/2 a cup and spoon it over the chicken, which is topped with lemon slices. It's just beyond compare.

I agree with Peggy from Long Island - this recipe is in dire need of Romano Cheese. We used to buy Chicken Francaise at a local eatery, but I wanted to learn how to make it on my own. The first time, I used only one lemon and found the sauce to be too thin and lemony. The second time, I used the juice of half a lemon and whisked in a roux and a smidgen of cream. Then, with the leftovers, I added in some freshly grated Romano and voila! - I had duplicated the Chicken Francaise that we loved! In fact, all 3 of our extremely picky children loved it and asked for second and third helpings. ...As far as the fat content goes, I don't worry about it. This is 'good' fat and low carb.

This recipe is fabulous. I find that it is easier to cook the sauce in a sauce pan before frying chicken, especially when doubling the recipe. It stays hot and can be poured over chicken when the chicken is done. That way the chicken and sauce stays warm and can be served hot. It also cuts the cooking time down. Also, I add a little chicken buliion to give make it a little more flavorful, and less lemony!

I've been making a variation of this dish for years and have had excellent reviews, when used for chicken or shrimp. Key variation: batter is 1 egg, 1 tbsp oil, 1 tbsp Parmsean, 1 tbsp water. The Parm is key. Also I filet the chicken - much faster and less messier than pounding.

Imagine my excitment to find it here after I lost it awhile ago. However as I made it I realized it was missing some things. First and probably most important you need to add shredded romano (or parmesan) cheese, chopped fresh parsley and I think some lemon juice to the egg mixture which you dip it in. We LOVE to make this with shrimp and when done that way it is fabulous.

This recipe was delicious! I doubled the amount of sauce for 2 pounds of chicken because my husband loves extra juice. I usually make this dish in the morning and let the chicken sit in the sauce for hours. Once I reheat it around dinnertime, it is so delicious and very tender. I just made it this past weekend for about 20 people and it was a huge hit! Everybody was asking for the recipe.

This was very tasty but a bit to lemony for my tast. I will use less lemon next time. I made a dbl. recipe of sauce and it took a bit to render down.

I made this using chardonay, which went well with the chicken in the meal itself, though we drank the rest of the wine with the meal and it was a bit sour. I guess that is the reason why the dressing for the chicken was also on the sour side- that, and the fact that I probably added a bit too much lemon juice. I think next time I will only add one tbsp (to the dressing) and let anyone who wants a bit more of a sour flavor to squeeze more juice off of the slices of lemon used to garnish. Otherwise, it was not a bad dish- I thought the chicken would be a bit more tender, though, but that could have been my fault too, as it was hard to tell when to take them off the skillet. I waited until they were golden brown. Actually, I might try taking them off a bit early, and then putting them in the dressing to boil with it a bit while it evaporates off.

Not spectacular. My husband disliked it, my son liked it. I did reduce the wine, broth and lemon juice and then whisked in 2 Tbs cold butter, one Tbs at a time. The family prefers chicken piccata which is tastier and less labor intensive. I served this dish with linguine with a little garlic and oil, green salad, and baby carrots sauteed with butter and a little basil. This dish seems to be a variation on Meuniere. Perhaps that is how it has come to be called Francaise. I personally think the eggy crust and frying in all that oil is over kill. I may not work 48+ hour weeks, but I am on oxygen and still cook every night and not microwave and box dinners either. This dish was not worth the effort.

This dish is actually very simple to prepare, and very good. It can easily be made on a busy weeknight. I also make a lemon chicken variation that is almost identical with the addition of sliced green onion and garlic before deglazing and adding broth, and using 1/2 butter 1/2 oil in frying. Delicous! As a shortcut and moneysaver I use vermouth instead of white wine. It keeps in the cupboard and I don't have to crack a bottle. Great served with asparagus and pasta.

Just thought that I'd add something to my previous comment.[that this is just a version of chix piccata] I totally agree w/ 'Manhattan',as this really IS just a simple chicken dish, involving the usual dredging, etc. BUT,....let's play nice.(Hey, Manhattan, want to be pals?)

Rating: 2
I was not impressed with this dish at all. However, those who think this is labor-intensive clearly don't enjoy the ACT of cooking. Besides, this is just pounding, dredging and frying some chicken, and then making a simple pan sauce. For some of us, cooking is not merely a means to an end (eating), but an end in itself. And before you jump all over me, I also work at least 48 hour weeks - so my time is valuable as well. For some of these people, I suppose anything more than punching the "popcorn" setting on their microwave is sheer drudgery.

The dish is not bad - it just didn't excite my taste buds much. It has very simple flavors... Perhaps excellent quality wine (suggested by one reviewer) and free range chicken might improve the results. Not a keeper for my family, but certainly not a disaster either.

This is going to be a standard at our house. It was delish and easy to make. I served t with mashed garlic, gold potatoes and turnips. Husband raved. Will have this for guests.

I ate this at the Crystle Palace in Disney World. It looked good so I thought I would try it. After i only tasted a small amount, i became ill. For the rest of my vacation, I had barely an appetite. I would not recommend this recipe to anyone. However, Epicurious has other wonderful recipes to try.

Imight make this again if someone is in the moo for it because it was ok and pretty easy to make, but it's really nothing to write home about.

Nothing impressive with this recipe, It's mostly an Italian version than a French. This recipe is not bad but you can always use your judgement to make it taste diffrent.

I guess its different strokes for different folks but for me this dish was absolutely boring. No flavour. Tastes blah.

As a caterer, I have made this dish for many clients. I add parmesan cheese and lemon juice to the egg batter, brown in clarified butter with olive oil, then wipe out pan and continue with recipe. Thicken with flour/butter "mash" add capers simmer then add chicken back to heat.

I HAVE A SIMILAR RECIPE THAT I HAVE USED FOR YEARS USING EITHER VEAL OR CHICKEN (I PREFER VEAL). THE ONLY DIFFERENCES ARE I ADD 1/2 TSP THYME ALONG WITH FRESH PARSLEY & I JULIENNE ABOUT 4 CARROTS AND 2 ZUCHINNI (AND DURING MUSHROOM SEASON MY FAVORITE FRESH MUSHROOMS) AND ADD AT THE END AND COOK WITH VEAL UNTIL TENDER. I SERVE WITH FETTUCINI ALFREDO OR JUST A FRESH LINGUINE WITH ALOIL, AND A VERY SIMPLE SALAD WITH AN EXTREMELY LIGHT DRESSING. EACH TIME I HAVE SERVED IT FOR GUESTS I HAVE RECEIVED RAVE REVIEWS

I agree this dish is not French, but Italian-American. I got good results by simmering the sauce until very thick and then placing the cooked chicken breasts in the pan briefly with the hot sauce, coating them until glazed.

I mostly agree with expat but the dish is nonetheless quite good. Wherever I go I always try to buy a comprehensive cookbook written in the native language. When in Colmar I picked one up and they do have a recipe that is virtually identical called capon moutarde. I am quite certain that it is commonly serve in the alsace region and has only small differences to this recipe. One is the addition of ground mustarde to the flour mixture and the chicken is not dredged in egg but just coated with farine.

I've never seen Chicken Francaise, but this is a classic Italian way to prepare fish, especially snapper. Try it - you'll love it!

This is actually a Northern Italian dish- known as Chicken Francese- near the French border. It is particular good when served over spinach or bitter greens sauteed and with mashed potatoes.

Never seen this recipe made in France in the 25 years I've lived here. Maybe it could more accurately be called italian or austrian chicken. Or better yet, freedom chicken.

Very Good

A nice variation is to use a bit of tarragon instead of parsley and grapes(red or green, cut in half or whole) instead of lemon & lemon juice. Toss them in with the juices and simmer a few minutes before pouring over chicken.

Recipie was simple and delicious. Definitely use a good white wine to make the sauce and go easy on the lemon and add some zest then finish off with a couple of pats of butter to make the sauce rich in the "french style."

Good, but not great. Will work for veal cutlets also. Do NOT use cooking wine (added salt).

Dude. You can't use chicken thighs... The whole concept is to use very thin, flattened meat. Thicken the wine-sauce towards the end, even add a touch of butter in the last 30 seconds so it barely melts... then season and pour over the chicken... its supurb.

Thicken the sauce at the end and use good wine - then it works really well.

Not great. I used chicken thighs instead of breasts bc like dark meat better. Not very flavorful - won't make again

When I make chicken franchaise, I add a bit of lemon zest to perk it up. I also perfer to use either broth or wine with the lemon juice, not both. This will give it a more lemony flavor. Otherwise the concept of the recipe works.

The thing you have to remember about this recipe is the simple ingredients and the big flavor. Make sure that you reduce you sauce down to almost a syrup consistency to really trap and consentrate those flavors. While I love garlic and other strong flavors, in order to make a truely authentic and great tasting Francaise... this is the way to go.

This dish wasn't terrible, but for the amount of fat contained in it, it just isn't worth it. The sauce would be better suited to salmon than chicken. I think it would probably be better if you sauteed some shallots and/or garlic before you made the sauce, and if the sauce were seasoned with a more delicate herb than parsley - maybe some herbes de provence or something.
