This recipe is easy to halve, which I did. The one thing missing, for me, were carrots so I added a few of those (chunky cut) and sauted with the onions. I served this with a creamy parmesan polenta which really made the dish. I also recommend making one night in advance if possible- it makes it a lot easier to skim the fat.

Tastes just like our favorite at the neighborhood bistro! We took some liberties with veggie amounts and also added celery and carrots, all at the same time. Didn't have any marjoram. Used 2 thighs, 2 drumsticks, 2 split breasts and cooked the chicken for an hr as written. Served over egg noodles. My fiance had a breast and said it was a little overdone; will stick w thighs and drumsticks next time as mine were cooked perfectly - fell off the bone. Will def cook again!

this was o.k. I thought it was quite a bunch of work for not the best meal. I had to add some seasoning afterwards (Tony Cachere's). I won't make it again.

I made this again last night and it was a success. Picky hubby really liked it. Made it pretty close to the recipe. Double the garlic, used thyme instead of marjoram, buttom mushrooms, and pearl onions. Added a little red pepper for zing, and carrots too. Used a good bottle of zin and served with buttered noodles. I skipped the two pan process by cooking all in a cast iron. Time consuming but I will make it again.

This was an amazing meal. I followed the instructions as written, however, unable to find fresh marjoram, I added rosemary and time. I also threw in some carrots so I wouldn't have to dirty another dish. The flavors were wornderfully balanced and deep. The family loved it, and I enjoyed using just one large cast iron pot for minimal cleanup. I recommend buying two bottles of zinfandel, one for the recipe and another for the meal. Enjoy!

Wonderful dish! I made it with a whole cut up chicken, but next time I will use just thighs and breasts. I used the fresh herbs we had in our garden - thyme and rosemary - in place of the marjoram and I'm glad I did. The thyme really made the dish. It took me longer than 8 mins to reduce the sauce - at least 15. Well worth the effort!

This was delicious! It was flavorful with depth. And, contrary to what other people wrote, I did not find it difficult to make - you can do it all in one cast iron pot! I used some substitutions; I used thighs and drumsticks, Merlot instead of Zinfandel, I added carrots, I added a little thyme and rosemary and I only took out the chicken when thickening the sauce. Goes well with couscous. This will be a regular at our house!

Made this last night for a small dinner party, everyone loved it, most even went back for seconds! Real important to really sear and saute everything before reassembling and baking in the oven to get all the good flavors out. I omitted the mushrooms and used small white onions whole and chopped rosemary and thyme. Kept it in the oven for 1.5-2 hours and didn't finish the thickening of the sauce, was perfect as is. Garnished with chopped fresh parsley. The chicken was super tender. Served with Mashed Potato and Turnip Gratin. Def recommend this one!

My family and I thought this was an average dish. Not worth all the time and effort.

Only change I made was to use a mixture of fresh oregano and thyme in place of the marjoram. This does take some time to prepare but it did produce a good dinner with a side of mashed potatoes. Try it.

A+ dish. Wonderful and very easy to prepare. I added a pound of baby carrots before baking.

Scrummy. We made a few substitutions out of necessity: couldn't find fresh marjoram so we used thyme; small white onions (quartered) instead of boiling onions; and Rioja instead of Zinfandel, as that was what we had on hand. It was a winner. We served it with two other recipes also on this site: the Creamy Mashed Potatoes and the Romaine Salad with Parmesan Dressing.

This recipe was really delicious. I added a pinch of sugar and a bit more wine for the sauce. I also took the skin off the chicken to reduce the fat which allowed the flavors to soak into the chicken better. I served with garlic and chive mashed potatoes. don't let the multiple steps scare you off for this recipe, its worth the work.

Made it as written except used a Cab. instead of a zin. Outstanding! Takes a while to make but so worth the time. Great flavor! I served it with mashed potatoes. Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow night!!!

This dinner was wonderful and highly suggest making it. I actually put lime juice (2 tbsp) in while cooking the gravy and it really gave it some citrus zing which worked nicely with the wine we were drinking.

I'm not a gourmet cook, but this recipe made me look like one to my friends. I used Shitake mushrooms and they were wonderful.

This recipe was great. It took a little more time to prepare than I expected, but my guest and I LOVED it. I couldn't believe the recipe called for an entire bottle of wine - I purchased a moderate one and used the entire bottle as instructed. Then, served a great bottle with the meal. It was perfect; the chicken was amazingly tender and I was glad I used the thighs even though they're usually not my favorites. Next time I'll prepare with extra mushrooms and won't forget the crusty French bread.

A wonderful recipe! I suggest yukon gold mashed potatoes w/ some smoky onion mustard mixed in!

Made it this weekend and everyone including the children aged 11 to 5 ate it up. Important to use good wine and reduce it well. I increased the garlic, added carrots. Next time I will omit the butter added at the end. The orange peel was good but I think that I will add it earlier next time to give itmore time to infuse in the dish. I also had my poultry shop skin the chicken thighs and I used a couple of boneless skinless breasts of chicken for the kids who do not like to deal with bones. Had plenty of left over sauce which I have served over rice and mashed potatoes for dinner a couple of times this week.

Wonderful. I cooked 1/3 of the recipe and cannot wait to eat the leftovers. Perfect mixture of flavors and not overwhelmed by the wine. Chicken was perfectly cooked. Would use more marjoram next time. Served with mashed carrots and yukon gold potatoes, butter leuttce salad with walnuts, cranberries, feta, cucumber, yellow pepper. A lot of prep, but it was well worth the effort.

This was good, and I had a great time trying to emulate a classic, but I don't think it was good enough to warrant the work a second time (unless I can figure out where the thighs went wrong). I had glimmeringly high expectations based on the previous reviews, but even though I followed the recipe to the letter, somehow the chicken itself wasn't quite... quite. Not very tender, and a lot blander than I thought it would be. Does anyone know where I went wrong here? Any suggestions -- it's hard to believe this is what came out of such a highly-rated recipe. The sauce, on the other hand, was spectacular (and even though nobody wanted the chicken leftovers I did end up using it for gravy on potatoes later) -- and it felt quite luxurious to pour an entire bottle of zin into the pot. (My husband and I had a friend over for dinner and his eyes popped when he saw the amount of alcohol going in!)

Lovely recipe and so easy.. I have never lked thighs until about 3 months ago and now all of a sudden I do appreciate them! Didn't change a thing but as I didn't have Zin , I used my standby for red wine recipes..Gallo hearty burgundy.. I really do not believe that "don't cook with what you wouldn't drink balarney!" HB is my red cooking wine as gallo vermouth is my white wine choice.!

This was a taasty dish, yet I thought the overall appearance was yuck! The mushrooms acquired a red wine color making blending with the sauce, which turned out to be this muddy brown color. Unappetizing, but the thighs were so succulent and juicy. Perhaps I would put the mushrooms on the side next time so they provide contrast to the sauce. Any suggestions?

Excellent. Made a day ahead and warmed-up before serving - definitely helped with flavors. Added carrots to more closely resemble a true Coq au Vin. In retrospect, I trimmed so much of the skin that it couldn't have added much to the flavor - would try it with healthier skinless chicken thighs next time. Very popular with my guests.

This is a wonderful dish, easy to prepare with intense flavor. I served it with Wild & Brown Rice with Cranberries, a perfect complement.

Outrageous flavor. I added 4 oz rehydrated mixed mushrooms and a bit of the soaking water for extra earthiness. Only used 1/2 bottle of a hearty Zin, and it was delicious. The restaurant is superb as well if you get to Wine Country much.

Thought this recipe was delicious...and not as complicated as it would seem. The only downer was having to use a whole bottle of wine in the recipe and not being able to drink any! All in all a great meal!

One of the best Coq Au Vin recipes ever! Made it last night and my husband (who's from Breton) loved it. Said it was pretty authentic. This is a definite keeper!

Outstanding. I made this for a dinner party and it received wonderful reviews. I didn't make any alterations to the recipe.
