This was a solid side dish to at a summer BBQ. It was good but not great. And it was not memorable. It was no good as leftovers the next day.

Easy and tasty. Added some lemon juice for bite as well as salt and pepper, and slivered red onion. Used halved grape tomatoes and it was a huge hit -- my husband and I loved it and even our toddler devoured it. Fast and healthy fo a summer side dish!

Badbadbad! The marjoram overpowers everything and I only used half the amount.

I make a variation of this often to serve alongside grilled meats. I usually prefer to substitute basil for the marjoram and occasionally use balsamic instead of red wine vinegar. Goat cheese and cotija also work well. I like to use grilled corn and serve it on a bed of baby arugula, as the marinade releases a lot of juices.

It's February and -5 degrees. This was summer in the middle of winter even having to use frozen corn. I had to use grape tomatoes, too. I added some diced orange bell pepper and a little diced radish. I found a goat's milk feta that really pumped up the flavor. It went great with the ribs and potato salad.

I enjoyed, but didn't love the salad. The flavors develop while sitting or chilled, so the suggestion to add more marjoram is not one I'd recommend. If I make again, I'll use basil instead

This was delicious and the presentation eyecatching and beautiful. I love marjoram, but any herb such as basil or thyme is fine. Fresh flavorful tomatoes are a must - and heirlooms the best!

I substituted fresh thyme for the marjoram and a bag of baby spinach instead of the lettuce leaves. It was a big hit.

Really good-- we served this alongside some marinated grilled chicken breasts, and it was the perfect summer dinner.

This recipe makes the best of fresh ingredients - good corn and tomatoes are key. I would possibly substitute a different herb for the marjoram next time - I agree that it is a slightly soapy flavor. But all in all, a great and healthy salad.

I expected more after reading the other reviews. Maybe our corn was too sweet (fresh off the farm that day), but the flavours didn't mesh as well as I expected, and the marjoram added a soapy taste. It was better the next day, once the sweetness of the corn subsided. I'd make it again, but cut down on the marjoram or substitute another herb.

Wow! The marjoram is an unexpected flavor and gives the salad something special. Basil or dill would work but wouldn't be as good. I double the amount of dressing, but otherwise don't change a thing.

I made this recipe for a casual dinner party last weekend. Used corn and tomatoes from the farmer's market - everyone thought it was great. I added a little more feta, just because I love cheese so much. The best part about it was that it was soooo easy. Plan to make again!

A definate 3 forks. It would need a little tweaking to be a 4 but still a great summer salad and I will make it again. Had basil, so used that instead of marjoram and may grill the corn first next time for a change in texture. Leftovers will be a corn & tomato relish tomorrow night.

Actually I think it deserves 2 1/2 forks. I love corn and the additions of fresh marjoram with feta make a refreshing salad. This was great for a hot day piled up on a plate and surrounded with some sauteed scallops.
