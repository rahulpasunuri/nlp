Perfect! Even my kids love it - ages 2, 4, 6

This is a great recipe for a nice quick sandwich to eat alone or serve at parties. However, unless you want your fresh, delicious crab drowned in mayo, I would definitely half the amount. I added an extra 1/4 lb crab to try and balance out the mayo, but it was even still way too much for my taste.

Wonderful. I added shrimp to this dish, doubled everything. My dinner guests loved it and kept going back for more. I used vegan mayo.

Really nice and quick; very tasty, too. We added some chopped cooked shrimp to the mix and used just canned, lump crabmeat and it was still really tasty. Definitely something to make again.

Just to clarify my earlier review, I used the refrigerated, high-quality lump crab meat from Costco, not the cheap stuff next to the tuna fish cans.

Really great recipe. I've always been a huge fan of lobster rolls but, thanks to this recipe, crab rolls may be my new favorite. The only adjustment I made was to go a little lighter on the mayo. Used canned lump crab meat from Costco and it was very fresh-tasting (at half the cost).

A perfect recipe for a summer lunch or any time you want something that's simple, quick to fix, and sure to please any seafood lover. I added a teaspoon of prepared wasabi paste to the mayonnaise mixture for a little extra kick.

WOW! Something so simple was so wonderful! I fought the temtation to "tinker" and add other things. I made the recipe as is and what a joy! We served the chips, veggies and blueberry gallett as well. What a great fast and delicious weekday entertaining meal.

The cayenne/mayo/lemon dressing is a very tasty base. We make this with chilled, chopped shrimp and minced celery, adjusting the amounts of lemon and cayenne to taste. Delicious!

Yummy, but you have to use fresh crabmeat.
