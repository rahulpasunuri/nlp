I just threw this together and was about to rave about it, but as soon as I saw "pear" in the other reviews I added that (as I had also skipped the jicama: I am not familiar with them and after googling it I don't think I have ever seen one either). The wonderfully ripe bartlett that I added only made it better! I added more rice vinegar instead of the mirin, and instead of watercress used some mixed greens that I had (spinach and aragula) and am eating this as a salad. I just wanted to use my avocados and as I had already saved this recipe and had made an asian dinner, I decided to go for it. You can definitely taste the wasabi :). Oh yeah, I used almost all my sesame seeds on "sesame salt" for quail eggs (on epicurious) that I had made earlier in the week, and I used some of that instead of toasting more sesame seeds, as I want to use it up. As I had used mixed black and white seeds, it looks like black pepper in the salsa.

This recipe is a staple in my house each summer. My husband and I eat it in less time than it takes to throw together. I typically sub a pear, peach or nectarine for the jicama, but I like the watercress when I can find it.

This is just fabulous. I cater and it has been a hit every time I served it. I chop everything smaller than instructed so it will stay on a rice crisp or sweet potato chip. Sprinkle a little lime juice over the top to stop browning of the avocado and use both black and white sesame seeds if you have them for the prettiest presentation.

This recipe is so delicious. I have made it several times and tonight I made it since I was entertaining and am on weight watchers. I made it with the Salmon with Soy-honey and wasabi sauces. I usually have a hard time finding ingredients like jicama or watercress. I have in a pinch substituted cucumber and cilantro.

Couldn't find jicama, substituted a pear. Didn't have any mirin either, so i used a little extra rice vinegar, a little extra soy sauce. Threw in an extra avocado. End product: Delicious and enjoyed by all. Will make again!

Very good, though I edited. Skipped the mirin (didn't have), used chopped cilantro for the watercress (was what I had), and omitted the jicama (store was out). It still turned out great. I think it is an adaptable recipe, as guacamole is in general. Would love to make again, the main caveat being how to fit in "chips and guac" alongside an asian dinner. I liked someone's sushi idea, and I made this alongside the Seard Asian Steak/Mixed Greens recipe from this site.

Sounded enticing, but ended up wasting most of it. In a group of 6, no one was eager to dig in. Followed recipe as is, so....not sure what happened. Some recipes I'll try again if I think I errored in preparation, this one however didn't even seem to have potential.

Loved this. It got total raves at a recent dinner party. Left out salt, watercress and used Asian pear diced small, as suggested by other reviewers, and threw in an extra avacado. None left. Total keeper.

Wow, this salsa was a taste treat! Omitted the salt as suggested and HAD to substitute cilantro for the water cress ~ apparently water cress does not exist right now in Fairbanks Alaska! Served this at our neighborhood wine group, those 12 ladies fell upon this salsa with shock and awe. Served it with Mary's Gone Crackers (a rice and sesame gluten free cracker) Those crackers were the perfect vehicle for this dip!!!!

This is an excellent salsa - very interesting mix of flavors. I prepared it as stated except for the salt, which I omitted. There is enough salt in the Soy Sauce (if you don't use low sodium) to enhance the flavors. If you're a salt freak, I'd add it last and taste as you go to get the right balance. The whole bowl was gone in a half hour among the four diners. A big hit, for sure. I'll be making this often!

This was a fun twist on guacamole. Forgot to add the salt, and didn't miss it.Also used Asian pear in place of jicama Mine looked more like tradidtional guac and not like what they have in the picture. WIll make again.

I have made this 4 times this week. Love this salsa! Love that it DOESN'T call for cilantro. Have served this with chips and sushi. Tonight this was an appetizer guests munched on while I prepared the veggie country pie and the salmon cakes from this months Gourmet. It was completely gone before dinner.

I and everyone else loved this salsa. I omitted the mirin and substituted an asian pear for the jicama. I want to eat this all the time.

I've made this twice for family gatherings, and both times it got rave reviews. I omitted the mirin simply because I couldn't find it. I served it with blue pita chips and it was a hit!

This is such a great mix of contrasts- crunchy and creamy, sweet and salty and spicy and pungent... we have made it several times to rave reviews. I do use low-sodium soy sauce as a habit and under-dose salt in recipes, so didn't it too salty. We serve it with assorted wide rice crackers. Just can't get enough!

Good recipe and quite easy to make. A little less sesame oil and salt next time. Add the wasabe paste gradually and taste for desired heat level. It would be good with cilantro for the watercress and water chestnuts for the jicama. I served this with tortilla chips but it would also be good over salmon or other strong fish.

That is odd...I'm not a salt freak and have never found this salty. Have made it many times; it's great with plain pita chips.However I do typically use low-sodium soy sauce, and as the recipe says, use "unseasoned" (meaning unsalted) rice vinegar (or if you only have seasoned than adjust the kosher salt). Dry sherry instead of mirin works just fine.

I was taken aback with my first bite... the flavours seemed really strong. But after another bite I was hooked, as was everyone else at our Mother's Day get-together. I skipped most of the salt thanks to reviewers' advice, and added an extra avocado. Pretty darn great.

Rating: 1
I'm not a purist, and in theory this is a great idea, but even without the soy this was too salty, and the mirin just gives it a strange aftertaste... might try again with sesame and less heavy seasoning.

i was so excited to make this delicious-sounding salsa and followed the directions exactly. 1 1/2 t. of kosher salt is WAY TOO MUCH!! i put in extra avocado and jicama and watercress and nothing helped!! this was far too salty for my smoker boyfriend and my salt-addicted sister. please adjust your version accordingly!!

This was a hit. If you are having a larger party I would double the recipe. Four of us killed it! :)

I followed receipe exactly and served with wasabi potato crisps as an appetizer for a new years eve get together. The crisps were gone quickly. The salsa, not so much. I wound up throwing most of it away.

I made this recipe twice and everyone loves it. At each party I served it, multiple people wanted the recipe. I mixed all the ingredients minus the avocado and watercress a couple hours ahead of time. When guests started to arrive I added the last two ingredients. It looked fresh the whole time.

I haven't made this recipe (yet) but a little tip for keeping the salsa (or anything made from avocado)from turning brown- leave a pit in the mix somewhere. It's not the prettiest, but you can bury it at the bottom. And it's a lot better looking than brown avocado!

Great flavors, but would use low-sodium soy sauce next time.

I have made this a couple of times for an appy. never any left in the dish! used water chestnuts once when Jicama wasn't available. a great recipe.

So yummy - creamy avocado with an asian flare. We ate the salsa wrapped in butter lettuce leaves and on toasted baguettes for dinner. Great flavours - will make again!

Outstanding. I've served it at two "Asian Grill" dinner parties. Served with both plain pita chips and bagel chips. For entree I made Vietnamese 5-spice grilled chicken, another excellent recipe at this site.

Fantastic. Used it with marinated chicken breast wrapped in butter lettuce leaves (as suggested in the magazine article) and the family loved it - even my dad who hates chicken.

Instead of hunting down jicama, I substituted fresh pear with great results.

You are right, amygerman, the pit- thingy doesn't work. America's Test Kitchen had an episode on guacamole and they said they tried it on the advice of a viewer and it didn't work any better than placing a layer of plastic wrap directly on top of the guacamole to keep it from being exposed to air.

Okay, I swear I am NOT a comment Nazi, but I've gotta tell you, that whole avocado pit thing is a long-debunked myth. It doesn't work - never has. You'd get exactly the same results from putting a lightbulb or a golf ball in your avocado dish. But the recipe is delish, either way!

Rating: 0
I got on here to drop a tip even though I haven't tried it yet, but will try to appease the comment Nazis. ;) Save the avocado seed and put it back into the prepared dish whole. It will keep the avocados fresher, longer. Works for guacamole, see if does for this, too. Just by looking at it, a cilantro garnish might be nice as well.

I have a new favorite salad! I tried this one mostly because I love avocado and wanted a new summer salad option. As I prepared the salad (no modifications) I wasn't sure my husband would like the bite of the watercress/wasabi combo. My concern was cancelled on first taste-- something about the combo of flavors that blends for a cool, satisfying salad. I did not think there was much of a punch which is good because I'd hate to overpower the avocado. This is perfect alone and would be wonderful with sushi!!!

I don't think there is a Nazi here. I have to agree with the comment that the reviews are probably for actual reviews not about those of us who have not tested the recipe or just want to chat. See, I shouldn't have sent this either by my own standard...

This was delicious! I followed the recipe for the most part but I added a bit more jicama and had to put in about 4 more sliced green onions to reach a cup's worth. Next I made some pan seared Halibut and served this salsa on top of the fish. Everyone loved it!

Mmm. I made this salsa and followed their asian coleslaw suggestion (add coleslaw mix, extra vinegar, sesame oil to taste). I took it to a potluck and it was a hit. I didn't really notice the wasabi kick so maybe more would be good. The combination of textures is very satisfying. I've made this twice now since last week. I might try making it with Newman's asian dressing next time if I'm feeling lazy. I have a feeling that would taste very good as well. Tip: Be careful with adding salt if you only have seasoned rice vinegar on hand.
