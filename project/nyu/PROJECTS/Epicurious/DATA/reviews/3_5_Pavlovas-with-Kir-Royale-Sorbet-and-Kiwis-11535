Made the sorbet for a christmas luncheon to RAVE reviews - simple and easy and served topped with fresh raspberries and a french cookie...sweet enough on its own so no need for the pavlova. Will make just as is again and again.

Made it for Valentine's Day: added a few drops of red food dye to turn the meringue pink and topped with whipped cream and strawberries. A new, delicious take on strawberry shortcake!

This is a wonderful recipe! The sorbet is a delight, and not difficult to make at all. I had borrowed an ice cream freezer to make it, now I have my own so I can serve it frequently. Don't change a thing, just make and enjoy!

I used this recipe just for the Pavlova. Served with mixed (frozen) berries and whipped cream. Extraordinary!!!

I used the wings of the baby kiwis. I have never made a pavlova with meat before. I was quite surprised at the pleasant results!

The fruits are called kiwi fruit NOT KIWIS! A kiwi is a flightless bird from New Zealand!
