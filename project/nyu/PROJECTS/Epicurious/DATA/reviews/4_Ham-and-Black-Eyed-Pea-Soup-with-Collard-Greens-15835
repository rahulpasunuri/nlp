Delicious! Loved this soup. I used 1/2 stock, 1/2 water and spinach instead of collard greens (it's what I had in the fridge). Turned out fine. I also added some ground mustard powder and the juice of half a lemon--added a nice tang. Also topped with grated parmesan cheese-yum!

Easy and delicious. I cooked dried blackeyed peas first and added the liquor from those in place of some of the water. Added celery and carrots, and used Mustard Greens.

I substituted cabbage for the collard greens and added some bell pepper. It was delicious!!! I will definitely make this again, and it will be my New Year's Day traditional meal. Very quick and easy, and very good!

I thought this was great just as the recipe says! I like the simplicity (quick to make and not too many ingredients) but still hearty and great flavor - i was looking for a low cal, hight fiber and this is excellent for both -this is my first time eating collard greens and WON'T be my last ;)

Delicious and easy! Also added carrots and celery, did a little less ham and added some bacon too. Used the cooking water from the peas for part of the broth... probably about 1/3 pea broth, 1/3 chicken stock, and 1/3 water. It was very simple and so satisfying! Everybody loved it!

Very good, easy recipe. As others suggested, I added carrots and celery, and extra garlic. I also used three cups of broth and two cups of water. With this recipe, cheers to health and wealth in the new year!

We made this New Year's Day 2012. It was great and will definitely make it again. Did not have chic broth so used beef broth instead. First time I had cooked with collard greens; I liked them in this soup. Served with French bread and a small salad.

Delicious! I used Country Ham which gave a salty flavor, but I used low sodium s chicken broth to save the salt from being overpowering. I also used 5 cloves of garlic, very tasty!

My husband even loved it! I used fresh peas and 3/1 chicken broth/water ratio. This was so easy and very delish!

We loved this recipe, and I felt like it was a great use of collard greens - the flavor and texture was just right with this combo. It was my first time cooking with black eyed peas, and I love that they don't have to be presoaked. I tweaked this recipe much less than I usually do. I used dried beans and added the cooking water. I also used 3 cups of chicken stock and one cup of water, and probably almost a pound of collard greens. Oh...and I did use two slices of apple smoked bacon instead of ham and cooked the onions in the grease instead of olive oil (then added the chopped bacon later). The bacon gave the whole soup a delicious smoky flavor (and made my pork lovin' fiance very happy). I think the only thing I would add would be the celery and carrot as suggested and a bouquet garni while the greens simmer. This will become a staple every time collard greens show up in our farm share box.

This was a good recipe - perfect for a cold winter night. We doubled the garlic and added a carrot with the onions - next time will remember celery as well. We added the ham (more than called for) with the broth (used water + broth base) & greens (used chard), as well as herbs de provence and a bay leaf. We pureed some up for our 1yr old and even he liked it!

Thanks to previous reviewers for your great suggestions... I added lots more garlic and onion than the recipe called for, plus added carrots and celery. I added 4 cups of water, 1-inch ribbons of collard greens (stems and stalk removed) and simmered with the remaining Christmas ham and bone. In a second pot I boiled 28 oz dried peas until tender (about an hour), then added the peas with their cooking water to the main pot. I used "Better than Bouillon" chicken stock to my taste. I was cooking for a crowd including lots of kids so I didn't add any spice -- but I served the soup with a variety of spice-it-up yourself accompaniments: Cholula, Sriracha, jarred jalapenos, red pepper flakes, black pepper, and Parmesan cheese. I transferred the soup to a crockpot set to low and waited for folk to arrive to watch the Rose Bowl. I made a second, smaller pot for my non-pork eating diners. Followed the same "recipe" as before, but substituted Reynoldo's Vegeterian Chorizo for the ham. That was a hit too! Both varieties were enjoyed with corn bread muffins. I appreciated everyone's suggestions as I shared my family's traditions of black-eyed peas and collard greens for New Years! Here's to a great 2011!

Felt that is recipe need quite a few tweaks - which are easy enough to make. Added carrots and celery with the onion and garlic as I sautéed (with butter not oil). I then deglazed with a bit of white wine. Added bay leaf, red pepper, thyme and black pepper. Used more chicken stock than water. Upped the amount of ham... used leftover smoked ham (with bone) from Christmas. Finished off with a splash of balsamic vinegar and a bit of Dijon mustard for depth. Let simmer for hours on very, very low heat. This is a fun recipe to experiment with - really can't make any mistakes - get inspired by some of the other reviewers suggestions, as I did. Have fun and, as tradition states, youll have GOOD LUCK in the New Year if you serve on New Years Day.

This was still somewhat bland even after adding onion, extra garlic, red pepper, chourico, carrots,and ham hock pieces instead of ham. I also add some of the broth the hocks were cooked in. I much prefer the cabbage soup with canellini beans from this site.

Rating: 3
Agree with the not cooking ham w/ onions, adding more garlic, using broth, etc. I added sliced hot links in lieu of hot pepper flakes and still included the ham. I think this recipe would be HARD to mess up. This is the only time I've made black eyed peas and now this California girl knows what she has been missing!!

This was excellent soup! As others suggested, I added carrots (I'm not convinced they added significantly, but they didn't detract), herbs de provence (very helpful, I think), and I switched the ratio of chicken stock and water (definitely a good idea). I'm looking forward to my leftovers!

Changed nothing and it was excellent. I made this last year and plan on making it every New Years and inbetween.

Okay, folks. Here's the skinny on this recipe: 1) Why would anyone tell you to add the ham with the onion and the garlic? Ham dries out quickly. Obviously, the recipe author wanted the ham fat to add to the taste of the soup, but use a piece of bacon instead, if you dare. If you put the ham in too early, it gets dried up and tastes hard in the recipe. 2) If you don't use the ham to sautee with the onion and garlic, you'll need to replace the fat. Olive oil, of course, is PC, but a little tab of butter is better. Onions and garlic just sautee better in butter....but do a bit of both if you're squirmish about the fat. 3) Um, this recipe calls for NO spices. Do spice it up a bit for gosh sakes. I used some red pepper flakes and more garlic, but there are a lot of great suggestions in the reviews. 4)Broth is the name of the game. Why use so much water instead of broth? What gives a soup its flavor? The broth!!! Reverse the directions for the soup/water. 5) Veggies! I put carrot and celery in mine, but I'm just saying... Be creative with this one, folks. 5)

Real comfort food! I used a can of Glory foods seasoned collards instead of fresh, and added a dried hot pepper for spice. Crumbled up a corn muffin in it. Yum.

Delicious, healthy, easy, and comforting. The changes I made were pretty minor... I used dried black-eyed peas and added chopped celery and carrots. This is a wonderful, rib-sticking soup that I'll be making again and again.

Simple and delicious. I used mustard greens instead of collard and added bayleaf, 5 cloves of garlic, 1 lg carrot, bayleaf, and a big tablespoon of red pepper flakes. I left out the ham hock and used vegetable broth to make this vegetarian. I also doubled the peas. Yummy!

i had a similar soup in cranbrook, bc this summer and never forgot the interesting combination, henceforth, i wanted a good basic recipe to use a model for a black eyed pea/ham/kale soup. this one is pretty good, i added a few additions (made my own ck. stock, diced carrots, diced red pepper, tsp of thyme, ground chipotle pepper to taste and s + p. a real winner, try it.

I added more garlic and a lot more pepper, as well as some other veggies (celery and carrot) but was really happy with the way this turned out. Perfect for New Year's Day if you want to embrace southern traditions.

I made this soup for a New Year's Eve party and everyone raved about it. I had several requests for the recipe. I had to triple the recipe and I added a few things: stewed tomatoes, bay leaves, LOTS more garlic, white pepper, chili powder, and Chipotle seasoning.

Fabulous soup. The deep south in a bowl! I've made this with chicken andouille instead of ham, fresh black eyped peas (add with the collards), a bit more broth than water, and some hot sauce (Crystal is my favorite for flavor without the searing heat of others). Serve with some buttermilk cornbread (no sugar in the cornbread, please) and enjoy! This is a dish that I could eat and eat and eat until my tummy hurt....

Loved it. Used more tons garlic. Added carrots, pepper flakes & bay leaf. Heard that one should use a pinch of sugar when cooking collards, so added that too. Used 3 cups of water & chicken stock. Next time will add the ham with the beans towards the end b/c the ham got a little tough. Also may add another can of beans. Ended with the cider vingar, lots of black pepper & a splash of LA hot sauce. Yum!

I made this exactly as written, except I used frozen BE peas, which I cooked while I made the broth with the greens. It turned out perfect. Both my young children loved it and my husband & I couldn't get enough. I have been looking for ways of using traditionally southern ingredients in a more contemporary & healthy way, and this recipe really fits the bill.

Great soup, with or without ham. I use cabbage greens, as collard greens are not available in UK, and it is staple, easy dinner in our home. A good dash of tabasco and a sprinkle of herbs de provence adds some depth.

This was a delicious way to use up leftover honey baked ham. I put the ham in the soup as the recipe called for and thought it lost too much of its flavor, so added more ham at the end. We all so used all stock instead of stock and water.

Southern soul food in soup form! Which is even better because the flavors blend together wonderfully. Chili oil instead of olive oil is a nice twist. This recipe fits perfectly in a big ole cast iron skillet. If you have two skillets you can make a batch of cornbread at the same time - heaven!

Absolutely delicious! With leftover ham from Christmas, I was looking for a good New Year's Day dish. The rave reviews of this recipe made the decision easy. I utilized all of the suggestions and added: chopped carrot, bay leaf & pepper flakes. Since I had more ham leftover, I also added it. My guests absolutely loved it and were pleased with the added benefit of (guaranteed) good luck for the New Year! I look forward to making it again. Thank you!

Delicious. I used dried peas, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly, and served it with pepper vinegar on the side. Even my husband, who generally won't eat a bean that isn't refried, called it "entirely edible."

This is an awesome recipe. And virtually foolproof. I used 1 c. of dried peas that I cooked separately, and a 16 oz bag of prewashed, precut mustard greens. My husband and I loved them! Definitely a keeper!

What a great recipe! I didn't have any black eyed peas on hand, so I used canned white beans instead. I added a second can to give it a little more heft. Also, I took the suggestions and sauteed diced carrots (3 small). I added a bay leaf and a sprig of fresh thyme and garnished with grated romano cheese. YUM!

My husband loved this soup. I put the sauteed items (added carrots as well), along with chicken broth (used in place of water) and dried black-eyed peas in a crockpot for several hours until the peas were softened. Then I transferred to a pot on the stove, added the collard greens and simmered until tender. It was yummy. Next time I think I may add a little bacon.

I have made this soup several times and have given the recipe to my friends. My family (includes 2 preteen boys) enjoyed it. I serve it with cornbread and it is yummy! I normally increase the amount of collards greens since I try to get veggies in at every chance. Chopped carrots would be a nice addition as well. I also add some red pepper flakes to give it a little kick.

JUST SUBLIME.. Bought both smoked ham hocks and collard greens at the Broadway Market, downtown Buffalo NY.. Only change, a dash of sugar...Oh forgot.. bought dried beans, added same amount (didn't presoak just added with rest of ingredients), simmered for 2 hours, perfect, delicious...

I am not a typical collards consumer, but I try to eat them every New Year's Day, as part of our good luck ritual. I had leftovers of black-eyed peas, ham and collards, and found this soup. What a revelation! Everyone who's tried it has loved it, and I'm making another pot of it tomorrow. Does anyone know whether turkey ham would work in place of the ham? Thanks in advance for your answer.

Instead of collard greens I used alot of kale. I did not pre-cook the greens for fear of overcooking and it worked. I just threw in the kale at the end, before all the ingredients were to simmer. I also doubled up on the black eyed peas........yummmm.

Great flavor. Couple of tips, being born & raised in deep south we always ad a bit of sugar to greens it decreases bitterness, try it, just a pinch. Second we never simmer greens for less than 1 1/2 hrs. so increase simmer time to at least 40 mnts. Third some said it was salty , I added a bit of salt to taste & thought it could use a bit more. But overall GREAT!

I'd never had collard greens before and was a little skeptical because they look like elephant ears... but they are really healthy! So I tried this soup. It is easy and yummy. I used the entire can of broth instead of one cup. It's better the next day because the ham has more time to flavor the broth. I don't each much salt, and for me it was a little salty. Next time I'll make sure the beans have no salt added, and I may use a little less ham.

This was a great soup. For all of the vegetarians out there, I substituted vegetable stock for chicken stock and veggie ham which gave a nice hickory flavor to the soup. Next time I have collards in my frig, I won't hesitate to make this again.

I'm originally from the South and when I went home to visit my family, I made this soup for them and it got rave reviews from all of us. Be sure to chop the greens really well for easier eating and don't be afraid to add a little more vinegar if you like zing!
