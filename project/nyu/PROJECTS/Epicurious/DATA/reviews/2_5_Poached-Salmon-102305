Sorry Epi, but this is advice and not a recipe.

When I poach the salmon I tie a string through the fish behind the gills and through the tail so that both ends are touching. After cooking, when I remove the string, the fish naturally curls. I then use VERY thinly sliced cucumbers soaked in salt water and cut in half and make scales along the outside of the fish. I use a lemon dill and roasted red pepper cream cheese piped along the top of the fish as a garnish. It is one of my most popular and impressive dishes!
