Used ground galangal as I had on hand and chicken breast to cut calories. Broth was fantastic. Not sure if I messed up, but had WAYYY too many noodles. Ate half of the recipe all by myself!!

This was so delicious even my 7-year-old loved it. I used filet instead of sirloin. I might tone down the chili pepper a bit next time but the broth was fantasic and the whole dish felt very healthy.

Had to make some substitutions, but it was really good and I look forward to doing it again, following the recipe more precisely

A great soup that lends itself to changes based on what you have on hand - in my case I had white mushrooms and bean sprouts. Added the mushrooms to the broth, put the sprouts into bowls with the noodles. Delicious!!

Aromatic AND flavorful! My bowls didn't have enough room to pile the spinach on top of the noodles so I just stirred a bunch into the soup at the same point that the tomatoes were added...perfection! Much, much, much more hearty than I expected!

I've been making this repice for years now, & it consistently turns out well. I omit the chilies & tomatoes, and double the amount of lemongrass called for. This soup base is wonderfully aromatic: all the spices called for are key! You can then be creative with whatever type of noodle, vegetable and meat combination you want. Definitely recommended!

Since we eat out at Vietnamese noodle places a lot, I found myself trying to imitate "pho" through this recipe. I thought the star anise and cinnamon were too "hard-core", so I took them out after a few minutes of simmering. Too much heat from the chilis, and too sour from the lime juice, so next time I will cut back, and serve them at the end, on the side, so each individual can adjust to their taste. Also, I would love to add bean sprouts to this. Can't wait to experiment with this again!

We made this with tofu (pan-fried for a few minutes) instead of beef. We couldn't find fresh lemongrass, so used a few pinches of dried; in place of the Thai chilies we used one jalapeno with half the seeds removed, which yielded just the right heat. We were going to add the sesame oil at the end so as not to burn it, but the soup turned out not to need any. You don't need to bother straining the broth as long as you eat around the star anise and cinnamon stick; dried lemongrass is a little stiff to chew, but fresh would probably be delicious. It seems like the suggested amount of spinach is rather a lot; we used about 5 ounces of torn-up spinach plus some fresh Chinese coriander (yummy!). We wilted the greens in the soup for a minute or two at the end. Although it took us about 1 1/2 hours to make, it wasn't very difficult. The soup was delicious and we will definitely make it again.

The portobellos worked very well. I made a few other changes, mostly to accommodate personal taste. I added three cloves of minced garlic to the shallots and chiles. I substituted black pepper for white pepper, took the cinnamon stick out after two minutes, and dispensed with the tomatoes altogether. My nine-year-old daughter declared, "I'm in love with this soup!" We agree!

This made a pretty nice soup. I used grilled portabella mushrooms instead of the sirloin. Filling and just the right amount of spice iwth one chili.

This is an excellent dish. Be sure to use fresh lemongrass and lime. I also added garlic to the meat before grilling. Since I hadn't cooked this before, I followed the recipe closely.

Although the steak, spinach and (I used fresh) rice noodles are lovely together, my family found the broth to be either bitter or sour. We couldn't identify which of the ingredients accounted for this unpleasing taste.
