This was a super star served with perfectly fried chicken, buttermilk gravy and corn on the cob. It's great for a dinner like that in the summer, when it's too hot for mashed potatoes and greens. I used white rose potatoes, and dijon instead of grainy. Also added a little chicken broth and a spoonful of creamed horseradish. It was perfect and is sitting in my fridge getting even better for left overs.

Just ok. Kind of bland, the watercress wilts and loses it's crispy texture.

made this for my family, a change from cold mayo potato salad and they loved it, they never had warm potato salad and the watercress added a nice crunch, i cut the watercress into 1" pieces so you got some with every bite

This is easy to make and has a FABULOUS flavor! I make it once a week. It is also good cold the next day.

I love watercress and I thought this would be an interesting twist on potato salad, but the watercress just wilted and I don't think the flavors really worked together well. I will not be making this again.
