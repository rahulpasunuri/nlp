I have had this recipe for several years, and my entire family really enjoys it. It's a great Sunday night meal. It's loved by my middle son so much he requests it for his birthday.

I really enjoy making this recipe. My children enjoy it also. It's one of our favorite Sunday morning breakfast meals. I found that it taste exceptionally better with cheddar cheese. The cheese can be mixed into the egg mixture or just melted on top. Serve with fresh sliced fruits.

I have always fed my son fresh fruits and vegies since he first started to eat. But for some reason I have found myself trying to invent knew ways to get him to eat potatoes. This recipe kind of disguises the potatoes and gives them new flavor Thank you !!
