Very yummy and easy. Only changes were to soak the bread in almond milk and add the leftover milk to the recipe instead of water and substituted plain greek-style yogurt for the mayonnaise. Gave it a nice flavor, and what a beautiful light green color. Perfect for the heat wave we're having!

I agree with the cook from NoCal. If you've ever been to Spain, you'll find that bread and mayo are staples there but if you are not fond of mayo, I have made this recipe with Greek yogurt which adds a delish creamyness and bright acidity. Give it a try, it's brilliant!

Don't let some ill-informed comments deter you from making this excellent recipe. As my mother used to say, "Some people don't understand all they know." The bread and mayonnaise are thickeners. A little research will show that originally, in Spain, gazpacho was a bread soup. A little good mayonnaise with a little added lemon juice give the soup the acidity it needs; you could just use lemon juice and leave it out. Of course, you need good bread. Obviously, we're not talking about Wonder Bread and Miracle Whip; if that's all you have, better pass this by. Gazpacho is a pretty elastic term; chefs use it for a variety of cold soups. I served this soup most recently to friends who were returning to Paris from their home in Spain. Like all the others I've made it for, they loved it. So go ahead and try the recipe; it won't mark you as a naive American.

hahaha! white bread and mayo - in a "spanish" recipe yet! i had to try it and...no dice. if you leave out the mayo, you get a fairly decent soup - but then you can get great ones on other pages.

White BRead and Mayo in Gazpacho? Eeww. sounds vile.

This is a great recipe for a cold soup. It did not really come out white, more green, but delicous. I added some avocado to add more bulk when I had no more other ingredients and everyone asks for the recipe when I serve it.

Great deviation from the normal tomato based gazpacho. I added a tablespoon of sour cream and a touch of lemon juice to bring out the full flavors. Also kicked-up the croutons by using a pepper-infused olive oil and sprinkling on some parmesan cheese before baking. Quick, easy, and refreshingly delicious. My husband, not a fan of cold soups, devoured this!

Great recipe, very different from one I have with buttermilk...added a splash of white wine to give it a "kick."
