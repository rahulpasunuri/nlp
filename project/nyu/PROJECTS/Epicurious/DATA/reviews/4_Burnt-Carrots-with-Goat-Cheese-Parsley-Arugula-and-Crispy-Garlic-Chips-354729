Total yum - but then goat cheese makes everything better. Not that this wasn't already fabulous. worth a repeating again and again.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! I would make it again in a heartbeat. As one reviewed recommended, I tried baking the carrots and garlic to cut down on time. I don't have a broiler (perhaps that would be the best option), but I put the oven @ 500. The garlic worked very well (took about 10 minutes), but the carrots cooked without burning. I was a bit disappointed in this, so I took them out and popped them in pan which didn't take long and worked very well. The flavors are perfectly combined to give a light but luxurious-tasting meal. Will be making it again and again!

Did not make the garlic chips, but did everything else and really liked this dish. It was simple, but full of flavor. But, I love carrots, liker really love them, so I couldn't go wrong with this side dish.

Easy and tasty. Skipped the garlic chips, but followed the rest of the recipe to the letter. Love the arugula/carrot contrast. Don't skip the parsley with the arugula either. Will make again and again!

Have made this several times and enjoy it with several changes: Omitted the garlic chips after the first time. The recipe calls for way too much oil and not enough acidity - I reduce the oil amount. I also blend the arugula with some lamb's lettuce, which makes the taste phenomenal.

Wonderful! A fantastic salad that stole the show from the main course.

This was a really great way to make carrots...beautiful presentation with the bright orange and green colors and taste great. Husband loved it. The parsley mixed with the arugula adds a lot of depth and flavor. The warm goat cheese on top that just melts in your mouth with the browned crispy edges was soo good and a great complement to the dish and the garlic chips are awesome. Husband loved them. Great combination of flavors. (oh and you can bake the carrots and the garlic chips in the oven and still get that browned/burnt affect and crispy garlic chips at the same time...makes it really easy combining the steps and you just have to pop it in)

Actually, it only creates cancer-causing agents in meat products. There is no harm in burning vegetables.

I don't really think it is healthy to nearly 'burn' food. I know it can taste great but it does create cancer causing by-products.

We had a bunch of carrots from our CSA and were looking for an interesting recipe that would use a fair amount of them. This recipe did the trick. We didn't end up making the garlic chips or frying the goat cheese because it was a hot day and I couldn't handle being over the hot stove any longer. The carrots are really sweet and even though they looked burnt, they didn't taste it. Definitely an interesting recipe I'll try again sometime.

I really liked this recipe. It's nice to have something a little different for a veggie that seems to be an unsung hero in the kitchen. I did make a couple changes for facility. I grilled the garlic with the skins on along with the carrots to soften them. Chopped them up and threw them into the vinaigrette. I also had very soft goat cheese so decided not to fry it for fear it would just melt everywhere. So I just scattered little chunks on the hot carrots. It probably made the recipe a little lighter without all the fried additions. They were packed with flavor and would be great on a BBQ too. I will definitely make them again!

This recipe is just "okay". I have prepared this dish. dac45 from colorado, please don't rate a recipe with a fork rating if you haven't even tried it. Because a recipe "sounds" good, doesn't qualify a fork rating. Thank you, NYC, for not giving this recipe a fork rating. You expressed your honest opinion - good for you - without altering later ratings.
