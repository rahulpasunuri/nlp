Made this at the last minute, when I thought I had no food in the house and leaving town the next day. Super easy! I browned the thin potato slices in a skillet for some crispiness. Used 5 eggs. Added creme fraiche. Omitted cream as suggested by other reviewers. The eggs were extremely creamy and held a beautiful shape. Yum! I was just trying to use up my leftovers. Filled the quiche with a portabello mushroom, red pepper and some onion. Added shredded parmesan cheese to the top. Can't wait to make this again and again.

A good base recipe. Next time I'll make the potato just a touch thinner. I like the "chew" you get from using whole sliced potato as compared to the shredded hash browns. I also added mushrooms and some chopped fresh spinach. I like the idea of subsituting some cream for some of the eggs, will have to try that. I used a combination of smoked cheddar and Jarlsberg, which worked well and I finished it under the broiler with a blend of grated smoked cheddar, grated parmesean and some chopped bacon. I liked this, it was a good departure from our normal brunch meals.

I adapted like the dickens: followed previous post recos to use hash browns with garlic, fewer eggs (5 instead of the recommended 8) and add a splash of half-and-half to the egg mixture. I also used provencal seasoning instead of thyme, and here was my mistake: I only had blue cheese in the house. While we all liked it a lot, I found it way too rich. Next time I'll skip the seasoning altogether and use gruyere instead of bleu for added bite. Unlike others, I really liked the red pepper in this dish to counterbalance the bacon. It looked gorgeous coming out of the oven.

I noticed that other reviewers used home fries instead of steamed potatoes, so I decided to boil potatoes and then sauté them in a little oil, salt, pepper, and Herbes de Provence until a little browned. I thought the Herbes de Provence and thyme went well together. I also used old Gouda cheese instead of cheddar and small bacon pieces instead of Canadian bacon. As another reviewer suggested, I also only used 5 eggs and added a cup of half and half for a more quiche like dish. With these slight changes, I thought the dish was quite delicious!

As written, this one definitely needs some props. steamed potatoes are blah- need a crunchy bottom, like the hash brown options offered--hello? crusted?????. Also-thyme is not right flavor for this dish. flavors otherwise are good but overall recipe is very lacking

Not bad... took out the pepper and added scallions and broccoli instead. Pretty tasty overall. The potato crust makes a nice contrast to the eggs. I would definitely make this again!

I decided to take other reviewers advice and use frozen home fries. Definately need to brown them. I really love quiche so I only used 5 eggs and added a cup of fat free half and half for a more quiche like dish. I used sharp cheddar and turkey bacon. Very easy and nice.

This quiche was a hit with my family when I made it for Sunday brunch. I used pre-packaged hash browns (mixed with a little egg and oil)like other reviewers suggested and baked in the oven until set. I also, made mini-crusts in muffin tins. Once cooked, we found that the consistency of the big quiche in the pie pan was different from the ones in the muffin tin. Still good though. Also, it tasted ever better the next day for lunch.

Awesome! I added mushrooms to the onion/pepper/bacon mix...but that is the only change/addition. I will make again soon (and have for breakfast tomorrow morning). ;)

I made this for a friend who was grieving the death of her fiance. She wasn't eating much so I wanted something that was easy to serve and somewhat substantial without being too heavy. I used the simply hash browns w/garlic for the crust as suggested by others and applewood smoked bacon. I used a smoked soft french cheese. My friend's response was "amazing". Made it for my family next and they agreed it was really good. Definitely a keeper.

I have made this recipe & variaions thereof for many years!! First rec'd from a friend. I serve it to friends for a brunch/bkfst on the boat. Everyone wants the recipe. I started using frozen hashbrowns with melted butter browned under broiler for crust.

Absolutely delicious! I like a recipe with a high number of reviews to the recipe. I took advantage of the the "easy step" by using the packaged hash brown & added egg & garlic. I did the prep work (onions, peppers & bacon) the night before). My husband absolutely loved it. Will make it again & again!

I followed other suggestions and did hash browns with an egg. It came out dry and with not much taste. I definitely won't make it again.

I used shredded hashbrowns and it came out delicious. I would increase the seasonings as it was a bit bland. I used leftover ham steak instead of canandian bacon and it worked fine. I agree, you can change and mix the ingredients to your liking.

Rating: 3
Very nice! I also cheated and used pre-shredded hashbrowns as a crust, with garlic. I do not like pastry crust, so this was a wonderful alternative. Melted yellow cheese always looks unaesthetically "messy" to me, so I used aged white cheddar, and instead of Canadian bacon I used Niman Ranch applewood smoked uncured bacon. Next time I might use smoked gouda and pancetta. Lots of fiddle-with-it room on this one. One caveat: be careful not to get this too salty. The cheese and meat are enough, to my taste, without adding any.

Rating: 4
Subbed smoked Gouda because could not find smoked cheddar, tastes great! Also, subbed basil for the thyme because I had some fresh that needed to be used. For a creamier texture I added 1/2 cup buttermilk to the egg mixture; very good! As suggested by another reader, I saute'd Simply Potatoes Hash Browns in skillet with 1 clover garlic before pressing into quiche pan (no need to spray oil into pan). Would definitely make again with these changes. Good breakfast quiche as well as late Sunday supper.

Everyone loved this dish. I substituted regular bacon and sharp cheddar.

I'm so jealous of everyone who read the directions here. :D I tried to make mine using a tart pan with a removable bottom, and everything went great until the egg leaked through the potatoes somehow. Sauteed my crust with garlic and added the garlic chips (which had also crisped nicely.) The end result was a half filled quiche and a very dirty oven, but the taste was exceptional. Subbed turkey bacon, carmelized onion and green pepper for all the fillings, and used a little skim milk with the eggs. Lovely.

I guess I sliced my potatoes to thinly as the fell apart. I managed to sort of make a crust. Next time I may saute them as suggested. Aside from that this has terrific flavor. The smoked cheese and bacon were ver prevalent. I made if for dinner with a salad but it would be terrific for breakfast or brunch too. It is unusual for a quiche to have no cream or milk. I think that would make this one less caloric than most as well.

I made this as part of a valentines dinner and it was delicious! It was however somewhat time-consuming (but totally worth it.) It took about twice as long for the potatoes to soften in the steamer and the smoked cheddar was fantastic. Try it!

The cheese was a little overpowering for me. Next time I would reduce it. For the crust, I used another reviewer's suggestion and made it with potato shaving. It turned out wonderfully.

I was short on time so I too substituted Simply Potatoes Hash Browns for the slicedpotatoes. I used about 3/4 of a bag, mixed them with one egg and baked for 10 mins @ 350 to get crispy. Then followed the rest of the recipe...delicious quiche. Everyone raved! Easy recipe...try it!

Rating: 4
Such an easy and tasty quiche recipe. The potato crust was a nice touch (I sliced them very thin to make sure they were cooked all the way through) and much easier to make than the typical pastry crust. I used bacon, make sure that you crumble it if using because being in the wet mixture will make the slices uncrisp so to speak and they're harder to serve properly.

My family loved this recipe seved with Green Onion Biscuits. It was perfect for Easter Brunch. I was out of Thyme and used Basil instead. I also used an egg substitute. I will definately make this again.

OK, you'll probably want to shoot me but I used frozen hash browns mixed with a little egg (to hold a shape)instead of peeling and cooking potatoes. I pressed them into the pie dish and baked until they were crispy. Then I proceeded with the rest of the quiche. Everyone raved! This one is a keeper especially can it can be made a head of time.

This is a great recipe. Having said that I should probably say, I've never actually made this recipe, but I've used it as a takeoff point. The potato crust idea is great. I steamed the tater slices, but then I sauteed them in olive oil to get that lovely crispy thing going. Mmm. That also got rid of the need to use nonstick spray for the pans. I used some leftover ham from the holidays instead of canadian bacon (see also, Orichette pasta with peas for another fine leftover ham recipe)--but then I made it later with lunchmeat ham and it was still tasty. I generally use about 6 eggs per pie, not 8 (I double the recipe and bake in two pans). Also, I toss in whatever I have on hand, green bells, red bells, mushrooms, many cheeses, you name it. I also use whatever potatoes I have on hand (white, yukon, russet, they've all worked well). A lovely meal with a salad for lunch/dinner; or for breakfast. A keeper!

I didn't personally cook this dish. I gave the recipe to a friend who has very little experience cooking and wants to learn. She made it and I tried it today one day old. It was very good. She said she had no problems with the recipe, she said it was easy to follow and no problems with the potatoes sticking or anything. I don't like smoked cheese so I did change the recipe to extra old white cheddar. I will definitely make it.

I was a bit skeptical of this recipe but decided to go ahead with it after reading the reviews. Wow, am I glad I did! Have made it a few times, once as the base recipe (yum) and also with the following variations that all worked well: substituted unpeeled red potato slices for the russet, substituted a layer of thinly sliced tomatoes (on top of the meat layer) for the not-so-much-loved red peppers, substituted smoked deli ham for the Canadian bacon, substituted extra sharp cheddar for the smoked cheddar. Great for breakfast, or for lunch/dinner with a salad and corn muffins.

Would try this one again. Take advice and toss steamed potatoes in olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic before lining the pie plate. Use large pie plate and full 8 eggs, don't cut back. This is a good brunch recipe. Do not be afraid to substitute for mix in ingredients. This can suppport some creative combinations. Still prefer crust variation of quiches but this is interesting for a change.

This was quite a hit at our brunch. It's good to have something without a rich pastry crust, and the potatoes were a nice change. We substituted roasted mushrooms for the Canadian bacon (from White Cheddar Polenta with Sauteed Greens and Garlic-Roasted Portobellos) because we wanted a vegetarian dish. Also just sprinkled on cheese instead of mixing it with the eggs, which sounded messy. Very pretty presentation!

My husband loves quiche and I hate making quiche, so this innovative crust seemed like a perfect solution. I filled with his favourite quiche recipe (bacon and broccoli with cheddar) but the crust was quite nice. Still not as good as a whole-wheat pastry, but infinitely easier. I will make this again, especially on days when I'm short on time. The food processor makes quick work of the potato-crust. for those who thought the potatoes were too sticky-starchy, work with them while still hot

I loved the potato crust, as did my husband who says that pastry crust is his least favorite part of quiche. It's a MUST to season the steamed potatoes with salt, pepper and garlic before prebaking them at 350 degrees for 20 mins. I just used regular cheddar, 6 eggs and cayenne pepper (s&p too) for seasoning and it came out great. I also used green pepper along with the onions. This is an easy, tasty and great anytime dish!

Beautiful, delicious quiche. Used deep dish pie plate; coated unpeeled red potatoes in olive oil and prebaked 13 mins. Baked day before and reheated breakfast morning. Perfect presentation! Looking for occasion to make it again.

I too made a variation of this delicious dish. I used sauteed leeks and crumbled chevre instead of the bacon and cheddar. I really like the crust idea, but mine seemed more like layers of potato at the bottom. Next time I will try prebaking a bit longer. However, everyone loved it and I will continue to make this and try out different fillings. I added a compote of diced red pepper and diced apples sauteed with apple brandy and black pepper to the side of the quiche slices. This added a bit more flavor and color.

I didn't really follow the recipe closly, but I love the potatoe crust idea. I used a vegetable peeler to make thin shavings of the potato, tossed them with some olive oil then pressed them into a pie tin, pre-baked for 15 minutes, then filled it. The result is a beautiful brown edge potato crust. What a great idea!

Rating: 3
Well, I'm not sure I can accurately rate this recipe as I doctored it quite a bit to suit my tastes and time constraints. I used frozen hash brown potatoes as another user suggested, and also baked it for a few minutes before adding the rest of the mixture. I used fontina, proscuitto and fresh savory in lieu of the cheese, ham and dried herbs. It looked lovely, was easy to prepare tasted good and is pretty much foolproof.

By the time I read the last review, I was already commited and I'm glad! This was fantastic. I made several substitutions in order to make it vegetarian. First, I used new red potatoes instead of russet. I also substituted goat cheese for the cheddar. In place of the other fillings, I used crimini and shittake mushrooms, scallions, spinach and roasted garlic. After the first 15 min of baking, I topped the whole thing off with chopped fresh tomato (seeds removed) fresh parsley and cilantro. It baked a total of 50 minutes. It was really great. Try it for your vegetarian friends,it was easy and impressive. I plan to make this for the next brunch I attend.

STAY CLEAR OF THIS NIGHTMARE! This recipe has sprung from a twisted mind and, after having wrestled through it, it becomes painfully clear that neither the author nor the other reviewers could have possibly made this with a positive outcome. What the originator fails to omit is that after steaming your potatoes and letting them cool off, they develop a starchy glue, making it impossible to line the pie dish. Except if you cut the potatoes up in clumps and attempt to press them into submission. The 3 cups of ingredients is way too much for a 10-inch dish (try at least a 12-incher) which results in not enough room for the egg mixture - a mixture which happily separates and leaves the gooyee cheese on top to brown/burn much faster than the rest.

I've made this recipe 3 times and chaged it slightly each time. The potato crust is great, but I've used regular pastry crust as well. I've also used deli-style ham in place of the Canadian bacon. It has become a family favorite.

I love the idea of using potatoes as a crust. I have always made my quiche without a crust before this recipe, as I don't like normal crust. I used Yukon Gold's and pan-grilled them first, very tasty.

This is a great brunch recipe. I agree with the other suggestions to add flavor to the potatoes. I steamed them then tossed them with olive oil and garlic and roasted slightly in the oven. Make sure you do not layer the potatoes to thick, this will only take away from the great flavor of the smoked cheddar. I added a bit more cheese and ended up adding one more egg. Great flavor, and very simple to put together. I will surely make this again.

This is one of my absolute favorite recipies. It's easy enough to cook for a quite meal at home, yet "fancy" enough for a brunch or dinner party. When I'm pressed for time, I use deli-style ham cut into small pieces instead of the Canadian bacon--tastes just as good! A sharp cheddar will also do for a quick substitute. Enjoy!

I think this quiche is to die for! I used 6 1/2 oz of smoked cheddar since I like cheese and it turned out fabulous. I love the idea of having potatoes as a crust. Loved it and so did my roommate:) I'm in college and it's quick enough for me to make and have left-overs too!

Heeding others warnings about bland potatoes, I roasted mine with some garlic, salt, pepper & olive oil first. The egg mixture didn't quite soak into the potatoes as I had hoped. Consequently, they were quite dry. May add a little milk next time. Without it, the dish felt more like a frittata than a quiche. I used a domestic smoked swiss which was nice. Because I was making it for co-workers, I substituted ham and told them it was Canadian bacon. I saved some money and no one knew the difference. No one cared. People are pretty easy to please when you set meat, eggs, cheese & potatoes in front of them. A real crowd-pleaser. Next time, I would julienne the ham vs. dice. The chunks of ham floating on the surface made it look like someone had wretched it up. Luckily, I had bought some extra red bell pepper, sliced into very thin rings and randomly arranged it on the tops of the quiche before baking. Very pretty contrast with the egg mixture which becomes tinted with a light saffron hue due to the sauteed red pepper juice.

Taking advice from the previous reviewers, I substituted cooked bacon for the Canadian bacon and smoked gouda for the cheddar. I also added a large clove of crushed garlic to the potato layer. It still seemed a wee bit bland to me. It might be better with another vegetable or a spicy sausage.

Easy and colorful breakfast/brunch dish, but everyone who ate it agreed it was a little bland. I followed the recipe exactly, and added a little garlic to the bacon. Next time I'll use blackened bacon/ham, a more intense cheese, and season the potatoes. These changes should make the dish a "four forker". Overall, a good basic recipe.

This dish was a hit at my brunch this weekend. I thought that the steamed potatoes were a little bland as the base for the quiche.

Otherwise a great dish.

I microwaved the potatoes for 3-5 minutes and then sliced into rounds and I used regular thick slab bacon (fried, drained and crumbled) which I sauteed the red pepper, onions and thyme in about 2 tablespoons of drippings (I know it is not healthy, but it was good). Also, I used packaged finely shredded sharp cheddar. I brought this to my office for a farwell breakfast for the paralegal and it got raves even from the health fanatics. I am thinking about trying country ham or proscuitti next time.
