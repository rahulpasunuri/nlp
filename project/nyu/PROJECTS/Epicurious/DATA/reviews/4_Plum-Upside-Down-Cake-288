I have made this twice now and it was exceptional! After reading the other reviews, I substituted 1/2 cup ground almonds for 1/2 cup of the flour, substituted 1/4 teaspoon each ground ginger and ground cardamom for the cinnamon, and increased the almond extract to 1/2 teaspoon. Delicious!!

It's nearly thanksgiving and I'm testing recipes. I made this with a few routine substitutions of mine. I used a low GI fruit sugar in the cake, which brings out the flavour of the fruit. And I replaced wheat with kamut flour, which has a naturally nutty flavour, as well as substituting coconut oil in place of butter. I also omitted the extracts and added the zest and juice of one lime to the cake batter and sprinkled a few pecans on top of the plums for crunch. If you use kamut flour, I suggest augmenting the liquids (as I did) or reducing the amount of flour slightly. Altogether a healthier recipe which could be further tweaked according to your tastes.

The cake was delicious, but I found that there was too much topping and maybe my plums were large. I didn't need as many plums to cover the entire pan. I added the excess plums over the arranged ones, perhaps that made my pan fuller. The recipe called for a 9" pan with 2" sides, I think my pan would have overflowed if I didn't use a pan with 3" sides. Either way, the cake was delicious, the only problem was the excess syrup from the topping soaked into the cake making some of the cake mushy and wet. It was not difficult or time consuming to make. I also found that I needed to bake mine a little longer to cook the center through.

Delicious! I've made this with plums and today I made it with the cherries in season. As other reviewers have noted, it's basically an alternative to pineapple upside down cake. Following other reviewers advice, I cut down on the cake sugar. Next time, I'll cut down even more. Especially with the sweet cherries - probably down to 1/4 cup sugar. I added just a dash of cinnamon, bumped up the almond extract, substituted 1/2 cup Trader Joe's almond meal for the white flour, and added a dash of nutmeg. Served it with Greek yogurt to help balance the sweetness and a sprinkling of Trader Joe's toasted sliced almonds. Yum!

Have been making this recipe since 1995 ! It never disappoints ! Easy and luscious. Sometimes I add a bit more brown sugar and butter to the recipe to give it more to devour on the top !! It's a top 10 favorite in my house.

Really really good, very pretty and not that difficult or time-consuming to make. I think this recipe would be good with other fruit too (pears particularly come to mind). Definitely a keeper!

This recipe is fantastic! Beautiful, delicious and easy to make, our family will be eating this for years to come. I love the vanilla and almond extract flavors in the batter. Also, I added lemon peel, and substituted ginger and a touch of cardamom for the cinnamon.

Fantastic recipe! I just made it tonight for the first time ever, and it was easy & quick to make, and it is absolutely delicious. I highly recommend it!

This is the best recipe I've ever gotten from Bon Appetit! I have made it a million times. Plums are defeinitely the best, but any other fruit works beautifully as well.. peaches, apricots, a mixture, whatever. Don't believe anyone who says it's too sweet. It's perfect just as it is, and the hundreds of people to whom I've fed it agree with me! It's beautiful and it's perfect every time. I love a dessert that can be in the oven in 15 minutes and looks and tastes as if you've gone to pastry school.

I was horrified to have lost this recipe. Then so relieved to find it again on epicurious. I have been making it since it was first published. I use apricots and peaches too. I also cut the flour back by 1/4 cp and replace with finely ground almonds. I love the texture. This is a summer staple at our house.

Wow! Count me as part of the chorus on this one! Loved it! I don't like too sweet things, so I cut down the sugar in the cake to about 2/3 cup - perfect for my sweetie & me. Next time I'll cut down the brown sugar in the caramel to 3/4 cup. I had three pieces! A really homey dessert.

Rating: 4
Wonderful flavor. Perfect desert for a lazy Sunday afternoon on the verge of autumn. Although the recipe is great as written, next time I will try to boost up the "healthiness factor", as per suggestions of other reviewers (reduce butter, substitute a part of the all- purpose flour with whole-wheat).

Delicious! Converted all of the non-plum eater in my house. However, I didn't put a pan beneath the cake pan to catch the drips and I now have a very large mess to clean at the bottom of my oven... Beware!

Follow the directions! Use a cake pan at least 2 inches deep. I thought 1.5" would be close enough. The caramel layer boiled over and caught fire on the floor of my oven. Luckily all of the smoke hasn't ruined the cake (just made a mess) the cake still tastes wonderful.

This is one of the best cakes I've ever made. The plums and the almond extract are a great combination and it's also a very attractive cake. One word of caution: when you're pouring your cake batter into your pan, make sure you cover the plums/brown sugar/butter mixture as best you can, or you could have a oozing bubbly mess. (It'll still taste great though.) Make this cake today!!

Wow! this was a hit! I had lots of italian plums and they were starting to get too ripe. I made this cake and it was delicious! I did modify the cake flour by using only 1c. flour 1/2c. oatmeal flour (which I grind myself). In addition, I only used 3/4 c. sugar in the cake mix but it was still too sweet for me so, next time I plan to use less. The brown sugar/ honey sauce that is poured in the pan before laying the plums is like candy toffee, so yummy! I served with vanilla ice cream and it was probably just as good as whip cream, maybe even better since it was a warm evening.

I've made this several times over the years, ever since my sister found it in a copy of Bon Appetit, and it's always a crowd pleaser. It's great for taking advantage of the plums or pluots that come out in the hot summer months. It reminds me of summer BBQ's and--just because the color is the same as what the cake makes--enjoying some refreshing red sangria.

Follow the recipe without tweaks and it's a sure-fire hit. I hav emade this many times. You can use apples instead of plums, but then do add lemon zest to the batter. Fantastic recipe!

Love this cake - I add cardamom and cinnamon (or any other warm spice) to the brown sugar/honey mixture for extra flavor. Just got back from the farmer's mkt with plums and plan to make this cake right now - again!

This is spectacular! Got rave reviews from co-workers. Will definitely make it again. I made it as the recipe said, except with half plums and half pluots. I alternated the red and yellow colors for a beautiful effect.

So delicious! I seem to end up making this after I've gone to a Farmer's Market when plums are in season and so I've made it with all different types of plums--even pluots--and no matter what this recipe has never failed. Definitely one to keep in the Recipe Box.

I made the first time as-is (but reducing brown sugar & butter, as per recommendations) and it was great. The 2nd time, i was out of honey, so used blueberry preserves (no added sugar) in place of the honey, and substituted whole wheat pastry flour for the all purpose flour (1-1). I thought it was even better! A little healthier, and definitely better texture in the cake. Everyone loved it.

I made this recipe as written using wild plums. Everyone raved about the cake. No one complained about it being too sweet.

Rating: 4
I've followed the suggestion made by other reviewers. Cut down the butter for sauce to 4 tablespoon, and brown sugar to 2/3 cup. It came out great, the cake was so moist and light, but a little boring in texture; my plum gave the cake a impressive red glaze. The only thing I think I'll do next time I make it is that I'll add 1/3 cup of sliced almond into my cake batter to make the texture of the cake more exciting. Overall, it's an excellent recipe.

I gave it 3 stars b/c it wasn't a "wow" dessert for me, but it was a Very Good and easy dessert...and a great way to use up all the Italian plums growing in our backyard. After reading other reviews, I was worried it would be too sweet, so I went with the reduced sugar and butter suggestion (6 TB butter, 2/3 C brown sugar, 1 Tb honey) and it turned out perfect! We had it with vanilla ice cream and everyone loved it. It also looked great!

This is so simple and so absolutely delicious. Use the golden brown sugar, I used dark brown and the color was too dark. It looks much prettier with the golden. It unmolds well, too. Great warm with fresh whipped cream.

We loved this cake - it was just the right sweetness and really light and moist. I followed previous reviewers and reduced the amount of topping a little: I used 4 tbsp butter, 2/3 c brown sugar, and 1 tbsp honey and this made plenty, even when I added extra plums. I also halved the recipe since I was cooking for just three people (used 2 tbsp butter, 1/3 c brown sugar, and 1 tbsp honey for the topping). I baked it in a 6" dia. stainless-steel pan (3" deep) for about 45 mins. Followed the cooling instructions exactly and it dropped out of the pan picture-perfect. Served it in a puddle of honey-sweetened sour cream - the sourness of the cream was a nice contrast to the sweet, rich cake.

A really great recipe and a good way to use up some of the profusion of plums from our trees. I used a bundt pan, which came out very nicely. I think that next time I would put holes in the cake to allow the juices to come through, and possibly more plums.

I love this and always make it when my Santa Rosa plums are ripe. The only change I make is to bake it in the cast iron pan like a pineapple upside down cake. Why bother getting another pan dirty?

I took this cake to a potluck dinner that had about 8 different cakes for dessert. This one was the first chosen by most people and the only one finished at the end of the night. I accidentally bought two different kinds of plums, but the color contrast was really beautiful. The cake was easy to make and absolutely delicious!

I also cut butter and brown sugar in half for topping. Did not have almond extract so used 3/4 teaspoon vanilla and omitted whipped cream. Delicious cake; it was not too sweet with change I made. Just poured it out of baking pan five minutes ago and I already made quarter of it disappear.

I made this cake for the first time when it came out in 1995. I loved it then, but forgot about it. I found it again last weekend, and have made it twice since. It's a simple and delicious cake that goes with just about anything. I made it for a Canadian Thanksgiving dinner and we ate it paired with a delicious Ice Wine. Yummy!

Really good. I forgot the baking powder the first time and had to whip it out of the oven and mix it in (was nervous cooking first dinner for in-laws). Even so it turned out really well.

Back in 1995, this was the first "fancy" dessert I made that was not found in the grocer's freezer (I was in my mid-20's, so give me break). The messiest part was cutting up all of the plums. I lost the recipe years ago, and thankfully just found it online. I can't wait to make another one!

For my very first review of a recipe, I would like to say that my mouth is watering just reading the title again. The hardest part about making it is waiting to turn the cake upside down. If you do it early, the juices will run all over the place, but then you have an excuse to clean them up and eat them. The most delicious plums are nice and ripe, maybe overripe. They soak up the sweet caramel sauce and add their own sweetness to the juice. The cake is light and tasty. I will have to conclude, this dish is delectable.

This cake recipe is great! But no one has mentioned that all kinds of fruit can be used - I've made it a number of times with good-quality canned pears, with fabulous results. I have reduced the sugar by 1/4, and leave out the almond extract.

I've made this cake several times, and love it for it's simplicity and yumminess. It's very quick to put together, and is a refreshing change from the tried and true ways to cook summer fruits for dessert. I've tried to with other fruits, nectarines, blueberries, cherries. It's always a crowd-pleaser, with very little effort in the kitchen.

This cake was fantastic - warm, moist, fragrant with cinnamon and almond. Could be served for morning coffee, afternoon tea, or for dessert. Mindful of the people who found it too sweet, I left out the honey, but I am not sure that was necessary. Some honey notes could have been lovely too. I served it for tea the first time, but will make it for dessert tonight, to follow grilled duck breast and raddichio. Yum.

I made this terrific cake for my family who just raved over it. I did not follow the recipe exactly alternating dry ingredients with the milk in the last part and yet it still worked well. The almond essence was almost overpowering Next time I make this I would reduce the almond essence to only a few drops. But it was a hit! So if you are looking for a cake that looks impressive and tastes great,without being too much trouble to make, this is the one.

This recipe is incredible! It is indeed sweet, but has a beautiful presentation with not a great deal of work. I made two cakes, because the first time I didn't understand the directions were intended to make the plums into "rings" so I cut them into wedges. It tasted the same, but the one I made with circular plums was more attractive. Rave reviews from everyone!!!!! I will make this again and again.

Truly scrumptious ! Moist, tender sponge & delicious juicy sweet topping. Wouldn't change a thing. Amazingly easy to make & it behaves exactly as the recipe indicates. Slid right out of the pan - in one piece - 5 minutes after inverting on plate. Looks impressive, too. Make this one soon.
