Why does Epicurious keep recipes with mistakes in them? Don't try this, it's a mess!

I don't recommend this recipe. Among other things, the water to cornstarch ratio is definitely wrong but the water amounts are right (see Terry's review below), there is too much gelatin and way too much mint (peppermint oil whould probably have been a better choice). Beware of chopping the mint too coarsely. It doesn't disappear after boiling so unless you actually like to chew leaves in your candies, I recommend you chop them finely or strain them out altogether if you can. You should also add food coloring; I didn't and the candies came out this mucousy kelpy seaweed color. The consistency was also too gluey. Those brave persons who did try them spat them out, complaining that they were too gelatinous, too minty and too full of mint leaves.

Beware-you can't mix that much cornstarch with that little water. The total amounts in the ingredients list for water are correct. Readjust the instructions amounts up to match. Try this one with some orange flower water. It's good that way.
