We have always had a mincemeat pie at Christmas in my family, made from a jar of Black & Crosswell (?) filling. This was the first year that we made it from scratch and it was a hit! We used this recipe as a guide but used apples instead of pears, figs instead of currants, and Cointreau instead of brandy. Like the previous review, we didn't macerate three days ahead but rather combined the fruit with the liquor in a saucepan, which worked fine. Next time I will use all of the zest and juice from the lemon and the orange to make it a bit saucier. Can't wait for next Christmas!

mincemeat was delicious. I neglected to read the instructions about how I should have started the maceration days before, so I put the dried fruit into a saucepan with some orange juice and the brandy to plump the fruit up. worked very well. Made a home made crust though, that makes all the difference.

Easy and very good. I made small tartlets rather than a pie. Mincemeat can be made well ahead, useful for holidays.
