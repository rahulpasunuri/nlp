This would be really good at a quarter the strength in the recipe. Another option would be to use it as a marinade, then wipe most of it off. It is just too strong as written. I think I'd also add a bit of ancho or pasilla chili powder to deepen the red pepper complexity.

gack... yurpp... yuk... Like the Cook from Boca below we love spicy, flavorful fooda and are adventurous eaters but didn't like this one. At first it was a kind of interesting mix of spices, but after the third bite I was choking it down. I'd give it a negative 4 forks, don't waste your time! blauuk..

I guess I get to break the tie on this one and while this recipe is not the best I've ever had, it's not bad -- essentially it's a cilantro pesto ("peppercorn spice paste" is a serious misnomer), but it's pretty simple if you have the ingredients in hand and very flavorful if you baste it a few times. I served it with rice. Pretty good overall.

Horrid. Truly horrid. The chicken tasted like large, soft peppercorns. I had to rinse the pepper off and make a separate glaze just to get the chicken to the point of edible. Which was a significant gain- pedestrian inedible to pedestrian (barely) edible. As an FYI, we like spicy food- but this was not just hot, it was boring and nauseating to boot.

This is an interesting and quite tasty alternative to ordinary baked chicken. Homemade Asian slaw is a wonderful compliment to this dish.
