Skip the cream, butter alone is enough. The tangerine adds a nice change. Otherwise, it's a standard squash recipe.

This was a very easy recipe, and I had such high hopes for it, but when I tasted it, I wasn't impressed. It was good enough for home, but I opted out on taking it to an office party. It seemed too oily or something, which surprised me because I reduced both the cream and butter (subbing milk for some to lower the fat). The heaviness of it seemed to overwhelm the tangerine. Next time, I would try to reduce the fat even more, and would up the tangerine juice and peel.

My review, in contrast with those perviously submitted, is not one of endearment and enjoyment. Quite the contrary, we found this dish to be far too creamy and sweet. The citrus flavor did not go with the squash flavor did not go with the cream flavor did not go with the sage flvaor. While it was incredibly eye- catching, it was a major let down in taste. I will not be making this again.

Huge hit at Thanksgiving

My wife and I made this several times this past fall and winter. Several comments: 1.) We prefer using more tangerine juice and less cream, as we found the original dish too creamy for our liking. 2.) We didn't enjoy the look of the cooked sage, but we are fond of the flavor. Thus we prefer steeping sage in warmed tangerine juice prior to cooking. Once the dish is finished, we garnish with blue and red sage flowers (from blue anise sage and pineapple sage, respectively) to add a nice touch of color. 3.) In response to the previous reviewer, the tops are used for a uniform presentation. Enjoy.

Any idea why you only use the tops of the squash and not the bottoms?

A great dish that I will make again and again. The orange and sage compliment the squash and add a unique touch.

Made this to bring to my sister's for Thanksgiving. It was beautiful and tasted delicious. The tangerine juice was a great compliment to the squash. Made it ahead and just baked it there.

I'm surprised at the lackluster reviews of this dish - it was spectacular at a dinner party and disappeared from the buffet. I rarely don't "tweak" a recipe, but this was wonderful. I've made it several times and given out the recipe whenever I've made it for guests. It was beautiful served with duck with blackberry sauce and asparagus.

I've made this twice, once as a trial run before Thanksgiving and then for the big day itself. It wasn't especially remarkable the first time, probably because I couldn't bring myself to make the full fat version on a run-of-the-mill Tuesday night, but it was outstanding the second time around in all of its creamy, buttery glory. Everyone at my family's dinner commented on the texture, color, and citrusy taste of this lovely dish. The sage and tangerine work really well together. It's not only delicious, it also adds a nice splash of color to a rather beige Thanksgiving meal.

Roasted squash is one of my favorites and the tangerine glaze was a nice touch!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was all eaten, but it didn't stand out as an excellent butternut squash recipe. I was a little disappointed that it didn't have that beautiful glaze like the picture. I would probably make it again, but tweak the recipe by mixing the butter, cream, & tangerine & brushing on top. I think brushing the mixture on top throughout the cooking process will help make the beautiful glaze.

This dish was a real let down. I agree with another poster that the flavor really lacked something. Ours was too orangy in taste and not very sweet. I ended up not having enough time to make this on Thanksgiving and I am glad that I saved it for the day after because my guests probably would have not liked it either. I wanted something orange on the plate...Next time I will make mashed sweet potatoes.

WOW!!!! We had this for Thanksgiving and it was a TOTAL hit with the entire family. My sister used fresh squash from her organic garden, along with fresh sage. It was wonderful. One of the guys went right into epicurious and pulled off the recipe to make at his dinner party this week.

This was a great way to use squash (I used buttercup) and had beautiful presentation, but I felt it was missing something. The sage was a little overpowering, and it didn't have the depth of flavour I was hoping for. I will try to make it again, perhaps with the addition of some nutmeg.
