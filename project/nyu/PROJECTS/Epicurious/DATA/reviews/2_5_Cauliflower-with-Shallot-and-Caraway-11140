simple, good recipe for a family dinner -- perfect for when you want a simple veggie side dish of more than just steamed cauliflower -- seems like there's a dearth of useful recipes like this

I used this recipe because I was short of time and had to use up some cauliflower that I had in the fridge. This was not a bad recipe, easy to prepare, but not the kind of recipe I usually source this site for. I standardly shy away from recipes that use the microwave oven, although it was very convenient to use it for this recipe today.
