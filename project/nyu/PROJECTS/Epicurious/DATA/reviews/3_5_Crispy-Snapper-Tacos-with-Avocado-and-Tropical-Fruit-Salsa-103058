Fresh and excellent. Made as stated and was very happy with the results.

Cook from Arlington: So sorry about the disaster at your competition, which sounds like a fun event. But there is a vast difference btn 2 chipotles from a can (which is what the recipe calls for) and two cans of chipotles (which is what you did). I haven't made this recipe yet, but it sounds good as written, so I plan to. But I read your comment and felt that your review might have dragged the recipe ratings down a bit, rather unfairly.

I do not know what everyone is raving about. I made this for a family iron chef competition and our guest judges could not even eat the dish due to the heat of the chipotle peppers. I even decreased the amount from two cans to one based on the previous reviews. Perhaps there are smaller cans than the only size that I found at the store. In my opinion, the chipotle totally overpowered the fish. The one positive thing I can say about this recipe is the tropical salsa.

Yum! This was great- although VERY spicy from the chipolte chiles. The fruit salsa was excellent as well. I only had kiwi and mango available at the store, but look forward to adding papaya and pineapple next time.

If you like spicy food this is the recipe for you! I've made this several times; once with tilapia and once with shrimp. I served this with roasted red pepper wraps instead of tacos. Excellent!

i couldnt find the peppers called for so instead i mixed in some salsa verde and left out the onions. all in all it came out really well would prefer it to be a bit more spicy but other than that i was really happy with it. served with the avocado tropical fruit salsa [amazing used mango, pineapple, papaya and kiwi] and a side of black beans. the only thing i may do diffrently next time is to make it more like a salad

We've tried this twice and agree that the salsa makes it happen. Be sure to use the 2 chipotles unless you can't stand the heat. We used chipotles, avacado, mangoes and red onion for the salsa..and it smoked! Our tongues are still burning a half an hour later, but it's worth it.

I didn't add oil to the watercress (actually used mixed field greens) and didn't fry the tortillas (just warmed them in the oven a bit) and I LOVED this dish! So so easy and delicious. The salsa is outstanding. Served it with spicy rice and cold beer. My friends raved.

The tropical salsa totally makes this dish! The chipotle peppers are a little overwhelming. Next time I will taste test the fish while adding the peppers - a few less would have been better.

The salsa makes this dish! I used the fruit recommended - great to eat just with chips. I didn't fry the shells, and I used mahi instead of snapper. Very good.

This recipe was delicious! Thank you to the recommendations from the cook from San Francisco. I did not fry the tortillas, but warmed soft corn tortillas in a fry pan sprayed lightly with Pam. I also squeezed fresh lime juice into fish while cooking. I used arugula and did not add oil to it. The salsa was awesome and a great compliment to the chili/adobo-spiced fish and arugula.

I thought this recipe was okay but have made some additions and now I love it. I did not fry the tortillas and just made soft tacos instead. I also squeeze fresh lime juice into the fish while cooking. The salsa is great and really makes the dish. I also found it unneccessary to ad oil to the watercress.

The chipotle chiles gave this recipe just the right amount of heat and smoke. I decided to use arugula, which I thought gave it a subtle nutty taste. If you decide to make this recipe (you should!) definitely make the Tropical-Fruit Salsa. It is excellent!

This was a great recipe. I have made it twice now (with Tilapia). The first time I couldn't find the chipolte chiles in adobo so I omitted, the second time I used them and I have to admit the first time was better. The chiles seemed to take the flavor that the fish had away. If you are looking for heat there are so many other alternatives. They made it bland, maybe I needed to add more salt to it but it can be done without. Had yellow rice, black beans, used soft taco shells and drank margaritas with it! YUMMY! And you HAVE to make the salsa! That was by far the best part! Got rave reviews both times!

Wow - my family was certainly impressed with both the taste and colorful presentation of this dish. I used 1 papaya, 1 mango, 1 tangerine and 1 small nectarine for the salsa and it was delicious. I didn't fry the tortillas (you really don't need to for this to be good) and served the tacos with beans, sweet corn cake and ice cold Coronas. Yum!

I made this sans salsa and it still turned out amazing. The peppers and adobo go great with the fish.

Fantastic. Was tasty with tilapia. The accompanying salsa was great. Served with soft corn tortillas. Will definitely make again and put in frequent rotation.

Fabulous recipe. Really did have a restaurant like taste. I substituted nectarines for the mangos since they are currently cheap and plentiful and it tasted wonderful. The arugula worked well (would use it despite the trendiness!). I am going to make it again substituting halibut like many people suggested.

YUM!!! I used fresh, right-off-the-boat halibut. I also modified the salsa a bit, using tomatoes and strawberries picked this afternoon from the garden, and omitting the avocados. I instead topped the tortillas with avocado and chopped onions. I also used soft, fresh corn tortillas instead of frying. Simple, yet fantastic!

Fantastic! Every part of it! I didn't fry the corn tortillas -- steaming them in the microwave is so much healthier. Take the trouble to make the salsa (I used mango and it was *fantastic*) -- it totally makes the dish. We were all so impressed with this restaurant-quality dish. It might have been the $19 a pound I spent on the snapper (granted, it's New York) but the fish was perfect, light and moist. Don't skimp on the fresh cilantro and jalepenos!

I have loved fish tacos for years and never had a good recipe - this one is AWESOME. Very easy and fast - I made it with halibut and it was terrific. I was amazed at the simplicity and by how delicious it was, and the mango-avocado salsa is a perfect condiment. I used soft flour tortillas, shredded cabbage instead of arugula (I think I object to arugula on principle - it's just TOO trendy), and used a little bit of sour cream as well. Fantastic.

We don't live near a good fish market so we used frozen cod filets. Also we didn't want the grease so we did not deep fry the taco's. The recipe was great anyway. Would be as good or better w/ soft tacos. The link to the salsa did not work, found it in the magazine.
