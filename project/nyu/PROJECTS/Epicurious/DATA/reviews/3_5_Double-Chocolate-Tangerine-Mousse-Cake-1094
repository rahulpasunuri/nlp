This cake was my desert choice for the very fist Christmas dinner I hosted in the United States (2001). The heavy richness of chocolate mousse is offset nicely by a tangerine layer that creates a unique taste to the entire desert. It pairs nicely with after-dinner coffee and brandy. This year it is again, my choice of Christmas dinned desert.

I've made this cake many times. Don't know what went wrong for those CA pastry chefs -- it is a fantastic cake and always raved over. The use of the 10 inch spring mold instead of cutting off a 1/2 inch of the cake is a great idea. The biggest difficulty with it is the chocolate curls... it seems to be a temperture thing. Disregard the negative reviews this is a great cake. For Christmas try decorating with the berries as suggested and add a few silk pointsetta flowers... really pretty

I am a pastry chef at a small restaurant and I made this recipe for one of my weekly specials. What a disappointment. It was the first dessert I've made that the wait staff didn't like. The manager said it tasted like orange vitamins. I had tasted the cake and mousse separately while I was making it, and I thought it was good, but once I had the finished product I had to agree, it was just not. It left a bad taste in my mouth and really didn't go together. I don't know why this recipe got so many great reviews. Usually I trust epicurious, but now I'm going to have to rethink this one.

EEww...I'm trying to be mature about this recipe, but to no avail. The cake is gummy and the mousse is slimy, and neither component has much flavor at all. I'll give the recipe this, though: the presentation is rather nice. Keep looking, there are better mousse cake recipes out there!

This cake was very rich and, sadly, didn't seem to have much flavour. I was hoping for a more pronounced orange flavour-- it was barely even detectable. In addition, I found that the flourless chocolate cake base hardened too much when it was chilled and didn't pair well with the texture of the mousse which, in itself, wasn't very appealing. After trying it once and being rather disappointed, I don't think that I would try it again. It would require a lot of tinkering to be a great dessert.

I photocopied this recipe from a Bon Appetit holiday cookbook and wanted to make if for a Christmas dinner. For three years, I pulled the recipe out and never made it, but did so this last Christmas. It was terrific and a real hit. Very rich. I even froze the left overs and pulled it out a few months later, and it was still wonderful.

I've got a question: For those who subsituted dark chocolate for the white in the mousse, did you have to add suger? White chocolate tends to be much sweeter than dark, so would the subsitution take away much of the sweetness?

I couldn't resist licking the bowl on this one! It is fabulous,beautiful,and extremely rich in taste. Serve in very small serving sizes. I substitued dark chocolate in the mousse and garnished it as directed but with dark chocolate. I then topped it with strawberries dipped in chocolate.

I made this for a dinner party that we were invited to. With all the great review's this dessert was getting I thought I'd give it a try. WOW!! It was a great hit. It's one of those desserts that you eat very slowly and savor each bite. Rich and outstanding. I will definitely make it again!

The base for this recipe is incredible - the hazelnuts are perfect. Although I didn't use the raspberries or mint sprigs, the presentation was still beautiful. However, I think next time I won't bother with trimming the half inch from the base; I think it'll still look great without this step. I agree with another reviewer who suggested using dark chocolate instead of white chocolate in the mousse, but that's just personal taste preference. I used Tropicana Orange/Tangerine juice from a carton without any flavor problems.

I cheated. Used this mousse with only about 2/3 the whipped cream in place of caramel mousse in the caramel mousse napoleon recipe...everyone loved it.

I made this delicious dessert for a New Year's Day party. The crowd loved it! I used orange juice instead of tangerine so I think next time I would add a little more sugar. It was a great effort to make but worthwhile. Very impressive! I thought next time I would use raspberry juice and milk chocolate for the mousse for a variation.

This was a wonderful cake. I made a big mess and trashed many dishes preparing it, but it was worth it. I used white chocolate chips instead of white chocolate for the mousse to save $ and it still turned out well.

I have made this dessert several times and it is always, always a hit!!! Gorgeous presentation. I have at times had a hard time finding tangerine juice (never fresh) so I have substituted fresh orange juice with very good results. It is rich!!

This dessert was very nice - although very very rich. I think if I make it again I may use dark chocolate instead of white for the mousse. I used bakers white chocolate and the mousse was almost too rich. SOme guests went back for seconds, some didnt finish the sliver they had. The presentation is beautiful

This recipe is gloriously rich. The mousse was very delicate, with only a hint of orange running through it. This dessert not only looks spectacular, but tastes better than it looks. A definite must for the chocoholic.

I made this cake for my teachers birthday. Everyone raved about it being so rich and delicious. I am a culinary student from Tx. studying to be a pastry chef. This cake will be one of my final projects. I will be entering it in a baking contest between students.

I made this dessert for my "Millennium Eve" party and my guests seemed to consider it sufficiently epic! On a scale of 1 to 10, they rated it an 11. Goes great with champagne, too. (Note to cooks/guests: this is very rich -- small portions are plenty.)

This dessert was unbelievable! Beautiful, delicious, a real winner. Word of warning: it took most of an evening to make this, but at least it was out of the way the day before the dinner party.

Stunning. No, staggering, actually. This is almost too rich to eat. Seriously, a little sliver per person is all you will need. The presentation is remarkable, and you WILL be remembered long after the dinner! I'm only giving it 3 forks because it's such a high-octane dessert that a few people actually didn't care for it. But with a little coffee to wash it down, it will send the chocaholics into a deep trance.

Fantastic cake!! Rave reviews by all. Pretty time consuming but not difficult; have made many times.
