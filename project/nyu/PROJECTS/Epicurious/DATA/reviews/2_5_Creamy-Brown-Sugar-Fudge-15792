I hate to do this, but go to www.marthastewart.com, search on fudge in their recipes section. The first fudge recipe (without nuts) is EXCELLENT. Worked the 1st time. And I beat the fudge by hand in the pan before pouring into the baking pan to set. You can use Baker's choc and it comes out fine.

Perfect! Creamy & delicious!! Modifications: I let fudge cool for 45 min vs. 30 min recommendation. I also used more brown sugar vs. white. Worked great for me!! Recommend with 5*****'s!!

I followed the directions and ended up with sugar crystals the size of Van Nuys. I think the fudge needs to cool to 110-115 degrees before beating to avoid crystalization.

An incredibly tasty fudge! I've never had a problem with consistency as long as it's chilled.

This simply did not work out - even served chilled. I can not think of any substitutions since it just didn't turn out.

This recipe was a disaster. After several attempts and about $30 worth of ingredients I gave up. There appears to be a problem here.
