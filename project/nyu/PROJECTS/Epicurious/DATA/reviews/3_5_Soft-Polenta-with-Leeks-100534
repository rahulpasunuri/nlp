My first attempt at making polenta and it came out well. I think it might have been better with a little less leeks, or the leeks softened even more, but it was very good.

The leeks and polenta make a great balance. Make the whole recipe and fry some with your eggs for breakfast.

I usually have an incredible amount of issues with new polenta recipes, so I end up tweaking them several times before I'm finally happy. Too bland, too rich, etc. However! This recipe is absolutely perfect as is, and better than any of my 'tweaked' ones! I've cooked it twice now and plan to serve it a lot more in the future!

I make this dish all the time. Easy and delicious accompanied with the Tomato-Porcini Sauce.

Just served this with wine braised short ribs and the polenta was perfect for them! The leeks are very mild, and it was an easy recipe. You do have to make it right before serving, but it actually only took me about 7 minutes. People raved!

This was awesome. I didn't haave leeks so I used shallots and it was fine.

Very nice simple side dish. One of my leeks had something weird going on in the center, so I ended up using two leeks and a large shallot. I also used emmenthaler instead of parmesan because it's what I had on hand, and threw in some thinly sliced green onions at the end.

Loved this polenta recipe! Make sure you cook the leeks well, added extra cheese. To Die For!!

I serve this over and over - I recently served it was short ribs and a sauce - everyone liked it. I alos use it withthe game hens.

Perfect for winter with Italian ribs in tomato sauce. I am not sure the chicken broth made much of a difference, but the leeks were an inspired addition.

I thought I followed the recipe strictly, but the dish took almost double the time to cook that the recipe calls for, and when it was finally ready it was extremely bland and little bitter. Not good.

Rarely do I ever follow a recipe exactly twice. There is just nothing to tweak with this one. It has become a staple!

This was SO GOOD! I followed the directions through whisking in the polenta, then dumped the whole thing into a crock pot and cooked it on low for 2 1/2 hours. Great texture - no lumps, just a little softer on top then bottom, but gentle stirring took care of that. Substituted half of the water with milk. Used 2 huge leeks and 3 small ones, so probably more than what was recommended. Left out the last Tbsp of butter. It was perfectly delicious, flavorful, and made for an interesting side dish. A great change from potatoes or rice!!! We couldn't stop eating it...

The polenta definitely comes out creamy when made with milk, but I found the overall dish to be bland. Not that great considering the time it took me to monitor the polenta (I didn't use the quick-cooking type).

I used the 5-minute variety of polenta, and it was very good. I keep a large container of dehydrated leeks on hand. That's because leeks are so expensive considering one uses only the white and pale green parts of the leek. I have to wonder why leeks are so inexpensive in other parts of the world, and so costly here in the U.S. This polenta was perfect with the game hens for which it was intended. I think that only a small amount of sauce should be drizzled on the polenta so as not to obscure the very pleasant taste of the grain. Guests can always add more if they wish. I'll make this again for sure as it's such a nice change from the usual starch side dishes. P.S. I added a thinly sliced shallot to saute along with my leeks.

THis was a little disappointing. Taste was ok/good, but the coarse polenta was still a bit grainy after 50 min. I prefer water or milk instead of broth, and the fine grain. I used this with lamb shanks

Very good. I used instant polenta, and it still came out very nicely.

This polenta is excellent! I have made it with leeks and with onions and my family and guests enjoyed both. Fast and easy to make. The first time I had stone ground polenta, the second time all I had was a box of plain cornmeal, and it was still wonderful!

Great recipe, especially with the hens. instead of using water, use milk -- the polenta is creamy and oh delicious....

Wonderful recipe. Have made it four times and still like it. Leeks add a great falvor to the polenta. Can be made ahead. Reheats nicely.

This is a great polenta. We have found it is easier to cook the polenta and the leek mixture separately and then combine them.
