I've been making this recipe since I first saw it in Gourmet. Never with the Shiitakes because I never remember to buy them, but the crisped zest, citrus juices and herbs are a fantastic counterpart to the rich salmon. It's easy, guests love it, especially the caramelized bits around the edges called out by another reviewer, and wild salmon is especially good this year. Don't be afraid of a 500 degree oven -- it's perfect for a thick filet.

I used this recipe only as a reference point for the oven temperature and cooking time. I had a 1-1/3 lb filet, and 500 degrees was way too hot. I had to turn the temp down to about 250 when I flipped the fish over, but it came out overcooked. I'm not sure what the correct temp is (at least, for my oven, which is pretty old), but I don't think 500 degrees is it.

Salmon with miso marinade is great. However, the mushrooms and zest live a little to be desired. I wanted some more intense flavor. I was thinking to make a reduction of the orange and lemon juices to make it more like a thin glaze over the salmon. Maybe add a little bit of pineapple juice as well for a smidge more of flavor, and then serve it over some brown rice. Just needed a little sauce and will be perfect!

i decided i don't like orange with my salmon. the miso was a little over powering as well, make sure to take as much off as you can! LOVED the mushrooms:)

We liked this a lot. Not a big salmon fan, I'm always looking for ways to make it that will taste really good since it is so good for you, and this is definitely one! We used 1 3-lb fillet, and 2 lb mushrooms, but everything else remained as written. Since I was serving 4, we have leftovers, though only one serving of mushrooms is left. Good recipe to keep on hand for using up the leftover miso paste (on hand from Miso-Glazed Chicken Breast with Vegetable Sushi Rice, also from this site, and also a delicious use of miso paste).

I prepared this recipe with all fresh ingrediants from the the Farmers Market, served with roasted asparagus and papaya with buttermilk citris sobet for dessert. My boyfriend and I LOVED it. We will definately make it again. I was simple to make and would be great for company.

This was such an easy dish to prepare - minimum effort with maximum results. I scaled the recipe down for 4 people and it still worked.

Excellent recipe. I've made it twice, one just for 2 people, and another time for about six. It's a good party dish -- easy to do in bulk. Only suggestion I'd have is increasing the quantity of the toppings slightly. I used brown miso paste since I couldn't find white and that seemed fine.. Oh, and it took me a lot longer to get my citrus zests to curl than the recipe indicates.

Loved it. Leftovers were great on a salad with ginger dressing. Marinated for 48 hours, probably too long. Needed a glass of Pinot Noir to make the dinner perfect.

I make a different salmon recipe every year for our big family Chanukah party. My large and picky family were raving about this one! They demanded that I hand out copies of the recipe to everyone as they left the party! Fabulous!!

Very tasty, especially the edges of the salmon where the miso caramelized. It took 14 minutes to roast a 1 pound fillet. Highly recommend using Alaskan troll caught king salmon.

the orange and lemon juice gave the salmon a really good flavour. the dish was wonderful and it looked very appealing. i did make some changes such as cutting back on miso and baking the salmon in the oven at 220 degree celcius. but the salmon was tender and really juicy. my family loved it too

I've made this several times; it's so easy to put together the marinade before leaving for work in the morning, and it's always delicious. I have made the marinade with mirin when there's no sake in the house and it's great that way too. I avoided buying salmon for a long while because the farm-raised stuff is so awful and the wild isn't always available or affordable, but lately have had great success with organic farm-raised salmon imported from Ireland.

i wasn't wild about this one - many better salmon recipes out there,

I've given four forks because I trust you guys...I'm writing to ask if anyone has attempted to substitute dried shitakes (also available at Asian groceries) in this recipe. If it's good, it can be one of those dishes you can whip up with exotic ingredients already on hand. Sorry if you consider this question blasphemous. I have every intention of trying it the 'right ' way, too. Thanks.

rich, red wild salmon with fresh, bright green topping...gorgeous!! i made the full amount of topping and half the fish to serve 8. probably would make a tweaked & simplified version of this rather than this exact recipe again because it's labor-intensive (45 minutes??? ha!) and ingred are $$ and not on-hand. i've never roasted fish before, but mine was almost dried out (are 1-inch fillets too thin?). also, pan is no fun to wash...will try disposable foil pan next time!

fantastic -- the center piece of a 6 course meal we had. we made some with salmon and some with steelhead, and both were great (steelhead perhaps a bit better). we also made extra mushrooms, fried zest, and juice topping. served with a watercress salad with toasted seasame seeds. yum!

I served this and everyone thought I was some great chef. I've made it once and it is simple enough that I could (and will) make it again from memory.

It was an absolute delight!!!! My guest could not stop complementing me on the fish! I used a little bit more sake then the recipe calls for. Other then that I just followed the recipe. Will be making this dish again!!!

If you are looking for a no hassle dish for a dinner party that is delicious, this is it! Most of the preperation is done the day before. One extra step I did was once the salmon is out of the oven I poured the juices over the salmon and let it sit covered for a couple of minutes.

A very classy and beautiful dish that can be prepared in just about 30-40 mins. (post marination). I brought this to a Christmas party potluck and about 15 people came up to me and complimented it. It is wonderful served with garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach. Just be aware that the miso adds a salty taste to the fish, even after scraping it off, so cut back on the salt in any side dishes you serve it with. Also, if you can find an affordable source of shitakes (try Asian supermarkets or Safeway), I would double the amount - they are simply superb.

This recipe has received nothing but raves when served. It is easy to prepare, beautiful to look at and delicious to eat. I make a lot of salmon and this is the best so far.

Incredible!! If you're really looking to impress your friends, this is an unbeatable winner! The hardest thing for me (and I'm really not an experienced cook) was finding the soy bean paste. Don't even bother with your local supermarket, go straight to Japan-Town or Korea-Town, and save yourself a big headache! My only diversion from this perfect recipe was that my salmon fillet was skinless, but it worked out fine. I served it up with calrose rice and a roasted walnut, roasted beet, mixed green and cherry tomato salad with a light citrus dressing. Perfect!
