WOW this is a winner ! I used more of the spices and substituted a no-cook lasagne for the matzo and just poured the sauce over the dish for the final cooking....this is saved in my recipe box and will be made again soon.

Despite taking a very long time (almost 3 hours with prep work), this recipe was great and I would definitely make it again. I did not soak the matzohs and I'm glad I didn't because I think they would have turned to mush. I also added a bit more sugar to the tomato sauce. I'm a whimp when it comes to spicy food, so I used a bit less cayenne in the sauce, and still thought it was spicy on its own, but with everything else it was great! A great meal for leftovers too!

Our friends don't eat lamb so I used ground turkey and ground beef. It was very good, but next time I will use the ground lamb. I will try this using homemade pasta sheets after Passover. When using Kosher meat, check the amount of salt used as the meat is soaked in salt water for kashering purposes.

Very flavorful. Took a little longer than anticipated, but it was worth the time and effort.

The flavors of this dish were amazing. I especially loved the spicy tomato sauce (although I used a bit less salt) I was thinking the sauce would go well as a meal itself if you added some shrimp and served it with rice. The only reason I didn't rate this pie 4 forks is because of the matzos. The texture became a bit too mushy in spots and it added a bland cracker like taste. I think I'll try it next time with the mashed potato crust as another reviewer mentioned.

Served this as a lasagna for a small dinner party to rave reviews. (Always good to check beforehand if people like lamb though!) It would be usedful for someone to write an alternative recipe for lasagna to eliminate guesswork. Used Epicurious Gourmet recipe of 4/98 for the Ras- el-Hanout. I wonder why recipe specified whole tomatoes when canned diced/chopped are readily available. The instructions should have had a step for removing the fat from the ground lamb saute - which I did easy enough with a grease separator. I sprinkled a little feta on the top of the lasagna before baking and had more to add on the side after serving. I agree that I could have eliminated the cayenne from the sauce recipe. I like strong seasoning but the cayenne tried to overwhelm the other great flavors and spices in the recipe. Would not use it next time.

We really liked this recipe even though we are vegetarian- I used Morning Star Farms Griller Crumbles instead of lamb and seasoned according to the recipe. I also made a mashed potato crust instead of the matzo with eggs, butter, mashed potatoes (powdered was very quick) cracker crumbs and parm cheese. My husband loved it and ate half the pan!

This one's a keeper! Very exotic and flavorful. Can't wait to try it with regular lasagna noodles.

Have made this for Passover and loved it but am wondering if anyone has ever tried using phyllo or puff pastry for the crust (of course not during Passover).

Excellent, worth the effort. Don't skimp on the oil. In Morocco they use much more than we are used to. Just drain the lamb very well.

Rating: 2
as the forks say, i liked it i didn't love it. I cut back on the oil usage, draining off almost all after browning the lamb. 3 Tbs. is way too much for anything like this. Followed exactly otherwise, just ok. not amazing like some of the other reviewers. Would like more of a intense moroccan feel.

This review is just about the lamb filling part of the recipe. I layered it over oven-baked sliced, oiled potatoes and broiled, oiled egglant slices, then baked the whole thing for 1.5 hours. It is absolutely fantastic, even better after an overnight in the refrigerator. Yum.

I make this every year for Passover. My husband goes nuts over this dish. It's a keeper!

I made this in college for friends during passover and it was really good. Now I make it with lasagne noodles and I think it is even better. And Morocco is the most north west country in Africa, located in the region referred to as West Africa.

Sorry to get into commenting on other rater's comments, but to the reviewer, who said Morocco isn't in the Middle East, it's in West Africa, shouldn't you get your facts straight before correcting others? Last I heard, Morocco was in North Africa...

After making this recipe for Passover, I've made it several times as a lasagna with fresh pasta sheets. It comes out delicious and is a good all-year recipe.

This is really a 3.5 fork recipe. I made a half a pan of this for a Passover mid week dinner and my husband loved it! It is hard to find recipes that incorporate matzo and are so flavorful. This will become a standard mid week Passover dish at our house (and it will replace my matzo lasagnas!)

Rating: 4
This was outstanding. I drained the excess grease after browning the lamb. The spice mixture was the key, and it was fun to use matzo in a recipe, rather than just eating it plain. When Passover is over, my husband wants me to try it with some shredded mozzarella, like a lasagna. Oy vey!

Rating: 3
This was a flavorful Passover dish. I was amazed that the lamb did not even taste like lamb, I loved it. Because lamb can sometimes be greasy, I would brown it first and get rid of the fat before mixing it to tomatoes, like another reader suggested.

Rating: 4
A wonderfully exotic (yet at the sane time familiar) blend of spices (the ras-el-hanout was from a local Moroccan chef who brings it from home every year). Yes, serve the sauce on the side. Dishes like this are what make Passover so special.

Rating: 4
This is the best darn Passover dish I've ever had, and I don't even like lamb! My husband has been begging me to make it again since last Passover-it will definitely be a second night tradition in our house for many years to come. I am a food columnist for our newspaper, and usually fiddle with most recipes, this one was perfect as is. The Moroccan spice blend is the exotic factor that raises this dish from ordinary to extaordinary!

looking forward to making this soon...a question for those who have already made this- did you pour the tomato sauce over the top of the dish, or serve it in a separate bowl for people to add themsevles. Thanks!

I make this dish all the time - usually without the matzoh but with rice on the side. I like the spice mixture so i double that. I probably add a little extra eggplant as well. It is delicious.

Someone mentioned making a vegetarian version. We'd love to know, using what? We have a lot of vegetarians in the family. As is, terrific recipe, wonderful spice combo, and great company food. We screwed up about the sauce and those ingredients ended up in the pie, mostly, but that worked too.

I made two matzo pies for Passover,and received rave reviews..One was the exact recipe,and the second a vegetarian one(for my son). Both were amazing..Love to see these types of recipes for the Jewish Holidays.....

Fanstastic. A wonderful, rich, complex flavor combined together in crunchy and smooth textures. A dish you could serve any time and impress with. Easy to make if you are handy in the kitchen.

I loved this recipe! That it used some of my leftover matzoh was a bonus. There was a lot of prep, but the flavors come together perfectly. I will make this again for certain.

Looking for a recipe one recent Sunday evening, I came across this one and, now I know I keep a pretty complete pantry, but I had ALL the ingredients on hand. It didn't disappoint. We all enjoyed this dish and I would definitely make it again. I didn't alter the recipe at all and it was something a little bit different.

Rating: 3
This was terrific! I substituted ground turkey as I don't eat lamb, and I increased the amount of cinnamon and allspice to compensate for the milder flavour of the meat. I also omitted the cayenne in deference to my two young children, who, incidentally, loved it. My 6 year old even asked if she could have it for lunch the next day! Definitely a keeper!

Rating: 4
Oh, wow! What a wonderful dish! I'd have given it six forks except for the prep time - a bit longer than I'd anticipated. But oh, so worth it. The spice blend is fantastic, and not overwhelming as I thought it would be. After reading the reviews, I took the advice of others and cut down on the amount of both the black and cayenne pepper, and the recipe was perfect for my husband and me. The only other thing I'd change is the sauce - I'd double it. And the house smelled incredible while it was cooking. This is a must-try dish!

In spite of not having all the called-for spices, several of my dinner guests said the pie was delicious. That's overstating things a bit, because I don't think that ANYTHING with matzo can be delicious. It was good, and certainly different than the usual fare, and I will definitely make it again. Perhaps next time I will try making a potato crust, rather than using the matzo. I used tomato sauce from a jar, and no one complained. To the person asking about ras-el-hanout, what is it and where to get it. Just click on the words in the recipe, and the recipe for the spice blend comes up.

My family loved it. I would have sliced the eggplant a little thicker. Didn't even use the sauce, it was good without it.

Really nice. I made the dish according to the recipe, and ended up with an excessive amount of fat in the filling. Next time, I'll brown the lamb first, pour off some of the fat and then start with the onions.

This was absolutely fabulous. Followed the recipe pretty closely except I only pureed half the canned tomatoes and left the other half roughly chopped in the sauce. Perfect spice balance, nice blend of flavors. Everyone raved.

Delectable dish - the matzoh "crust" was a novelty. I served it with a lentil salad and roasted asparagus, and won the applause of seasoned travellers.

to the frustrated cook in Scarsdale, NY, I bet Hayday at 4 corners in Scardsdale has your ground lamb.

You could get the leg ground, but it's a bit of a waste of a good cut of meat. Usually the shoulder is ground as it is a tougher (and cheaper!) cut. Also, up here lamb can often be found in the freezer section, imported from NZ. You have probably checked there too, but just in case you haven't, I thought I'd mention it...

My supermarket doesn't have ground lamb, so I would have to buy lamb and ask them to grind it for me. What part of the lamb should I buy for this? The leg?

This is so delicious it defies description. The spices (made my own ras-el-hanout) blended perfectly. It was worth every dish I had to wash afterwards! A few tips: soak the matzoh for the top crust a bit longer to keep it from burning, and don't be stingy with the oil. Also, I didn't bother to puree the tomatoes for the sauce; used a potato masher instead and the texture was fine. It was hard to serve, but I did not care once I'd tasted it!
