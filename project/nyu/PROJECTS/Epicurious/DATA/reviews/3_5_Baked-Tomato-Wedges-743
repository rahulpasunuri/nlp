Delightfully simple recipe that is both fresh and elegant. I punched up the flavor with a bit of minced garlic and tossed the tomatoes in balsmaic vinegar before baking.

Hard to call this a recipe. It's no better or no worse than the ingredients you use.

a very simple side dish.i added crumbled feta cheese. you can add the feta during baking or after.

Very simple, but sets off a richer entree (like the scrambled eggs with lox and cream cheese from the same issue) very nicely.

It's great with home grown tomatoes during the summer, esspecially if you grow your own basil
