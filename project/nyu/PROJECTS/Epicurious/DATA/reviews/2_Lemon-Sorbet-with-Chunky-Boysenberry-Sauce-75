Are you joking me?

First it was lemon sorbet with blackberry sauce that had no recipe for lemon sorbet, and now you've fooled me again with a recipe for lemon sorbet with boysenberry sauce that has no recipe for lemon sorbet, nor did the recipe that had mango sorbet in the title have a recipe for mango sorbet. I'm getting tired for clicking on recipes that don't have directions for making the main ingredients. Even if MOST people are going to use store-bought sorbet, this is a cooking site.

Why can't a recipe for LEMON SORBET include anything besides store-bought pints of Lemon Sorbet on this site!?!? I guess it's too much to ask?

Hey folks, let's not slam the recipe. It is what it is - if you are familiar with the magazine (Bon Appetit) this was first printed in their "Too Busy to Cook" column. Hence the shortcut of using commercially-prepared sorbet. There are many other websites that have full instructions for food items such as sorbet. Maybe you should check those first before complaining about the ingredients here. Great sauce by the way. Happy Cooking!

For goodness' sake, it seems obvious that this is just a good recipe for a sauce to serve over store-bought lemon sorbet. (A good brand is Haagen Dazs, by the way.) It's quick, light, and good. Simple as can be, and adds a personal touch to something that's already prepared.

Heh, exactly the same problem here: search on lemon sorbet expecting to find (*shock*) a recipe for making ... lemon sorbet? Is there an option to search using negatives? (Do NOT show me any lemon sorbet recipe where "pints of lemon sorbet" are part of the recipe) How hard is it to link to a single sorbet recipe and leave the users to use prebought sorbet if they are trying to save time, if the goal is to let people know about the wonderful berry sauces one can make.

My god, not again. Here I am, searching Epicurious for a lemon sorbet recipe. Sure enough, two out of two recipes have called for pre-made sorbet. Perhaps the next one will call for pre-made sorbet topped with Campbell's Cream of Mushroom Soup, for that pre-packaged retro glam kick.

This is a "recipe"? Perhaps you could suggest a brand of corporately prepared sorbet. (and imclude a money-saving coupon?!)

A delicious, light, and healthy way to end a dinner party. I substituted a mixture of frozen berries, and it was great. Our guests loved it.
