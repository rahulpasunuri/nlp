Tried this as something new for Thanksgiving. Easy to prepare, you can even find already prepped fennel to save time. I think it came out exactly as it should, and I liked the carrot and shallot. Had never eaten fennel before and didn't much like the anise flavor of it-wasn't very popular with my guests. On the good side, the dish reheats like a champ in the micro and tastes no worse. I probably won't make it again because my guests weren't keen on it, but if you like fennel this is a fresh, easy way to prepare it, and it's a nice contrast to other winter vegetables.

very good, but be care full, I used the time and temp in the directions, and the vegs were little over done. The next time I will cut the time in 1/2.
