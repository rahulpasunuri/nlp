Added some olive oil to the tiny bit of butter, used shallots instead of onion, doubled the clams (half whole, half chopped) doubled the wine and clam liquid, and added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, a spritz of lemon (don't use too much!) and a grating of Pecorino Romano with lots of black pepper. Tasty but not great. Might try with cream or creme fraiche (or nothing!) instead of the sour cream next time.

I took a few ideas from other Linguine with Clam Sauce recipes along with review feedback and made cream sauce Linguine with Clams that both my mother in-law and my Wife loved. I don't cook enough but this was fabulous and easy for anyone to make. Here are the changes I made: - added thyme to the oil/marg/shallots/garlic saute. My wife is lactose intolerant. - if possible use fresh pasta clams and just cook them in the wine. - mix sour cream (lactose free), belsoy cream (soy), cayenne pepper, fresh ground pepper, salt, and some lemon rind (adds a nice element to the dish). - Once the clams are cooked, take the pan off the heat, add the sour cream mix while whisking to avoid separation. - Grate parmesan over the pot - Place back on head and add cornstarch if required to thicken if required. I needed it so that it would stick to linguine. Make sure that you use a wine that you will then drink with the food, it makes the food pop even more.

This was quick and delicious. I added some red pepper flakes which I think was better. As written it was a little bland.

I've done this 7 or 8 times - I love it. While this recipe is simple and perfect as is, I've also tinkered with it over time, using 2 cans instead, as well as adding Parmesan cheese, pinch of nutmeg, and adding a bit of chicken broth to the butter at the beginning to balance out the fishy taste.

I have to say that I have never made sauce with sour cream but it was very good. I used a large shallot instead of an onion. I will double the sauce the next time.

This dish is excellent! Adding a little extra sour cream definately adds to the creaminess and since youre using low fat it doesnt take much away from health. If you are not a huge white wine fan, use a little bit less of the wine, as it is one of the main flavors in this dish if you use the recommended amount (which isnt even alot). Also, if you are serving 3-4 adults I would recommend making a double batch. I did, and it was just enough for 4 of us.

This was a delicious, easy, inexpensive weeknight meal. The addition of sour cream gives the sauce the perfect consistency so that it clings to the pasta. This is a keeper!

This recipe is easy and quite yummy. Definitely double the wine, garlic and onion and be generous with the sour cream. It's a keeper!

I doubled the things that taste to me - wine, garlic, and onion. Definitely do the fresh parsley. I substituted a splash of half and half for the sour cream, and it was still wonderful. I've made about twenty recipies off of this site and this was the one my husband most raved about. Thank you again, Epicurious!

sorry to be the contrarian on this recipe but i did not like at all. the sour cream overpowered the rest of the ingredients and did not allow the garlic and the butter to complement the clams. I would not make again.

Tripled the sauce in this recipe. I also used one pound of fresh clams in place of one can of the chopped canned clams.....Oh so good. In the family cookbook this one lands!

My favorite pasta to order in restaurants is linguini with white clam sauce. Some restaurants do this very well and others produce marginal facimile of how this dish should taste. I was completely blown away with this recipe. I did add red pepper and used some cream because I had no sour cream. I also used 4 ounces of linguini instead of 6 and I used all of the sauce that the recipe for 6 ounces called for. This was the absolute best linguini with clam sauce that I have ever tasted let alone made. Thank you Epicurious for another great and simple recipe.

This was fabulous!! Very easy and tastes like a much more complicated version. I did add a bit more sourcream and butter as suggested in the other reveiws, and was very pleased with the results!

This was so yummy and easy. I added more wine and sour cream. I also took another cook's suggestion and finished it off with freshly squeezed lemon juice and a sprinkling of romano cheese. To die for! But wish I had red pepper flakes; I'll definitely use them next time!

This was by far the easiest clam sauce recipe that I found that had the creamy flavor that I was looking for. The flavors of wine, garlic, cream, clams, and shallots (my addition) really came through. My additions: 1 shallot, juice from 1/2 lemon

very good recipe for a dish i've made many times i like the addition of wine & sour cream, the only change i made was adding olive oil along with butter & 1/4 c. water to make more sauce it was great my husband & i enjoyed it very much..

Really easy and very tasty. We don't get light sour cream here in England so I use half fat creme fraiche - yummy!

I make this all the time with a few alterations. I add basil and oregano and have subsituted bay scallops or shrimp for the clams on occasion and I think with the scallops it is best. I also serve over spaghetti squash to keep it even lower in cals and carbs. No, it is not a rich garlic oil broth, but as far as low fat goes it is really nice

I'll keep on looking. Not the restaurant quality I was looking for. :(

My family enjoyed this recipe. I did double the recipe, since I was feeding three people, and I used regular sour cream, not light. The sauce did seem a bit thin, but when I added the pasta (I used a 1 lb box), the sauce seemed to thicken up. It was very tasty... I would definitely make this again.

I agree with some of the others, this recipe is awsome, but i did add more garlic and wine and fresh clams, but i would definitly make this again. It taste just like the restaurant kind.

This was a wonderful, quick, and easy recipe. I followed the advice of others and added the clams at the end. I also added more white wine and some chicken broth to increase the amount of sauce. It tasted great!

This was certainly easy to make. We doubled the sauce as others suggested. I'm not sure how I felt about the sour cream, even though we used lite I could detect the flavor in the sauce. Personally, I would have preferred more "wine" and less "sour cream". We'll keep looking

This was delicious and SO easy! I had fresh clams and didn't have any clam juice on hand so I substituted chicken broth and it was still wonderful. I agree, it could use slightly more sauce. Great flavor though!

This was a very simple and delicious dish. I agree with some of the other reviewers about not having enough broth. I would take their suggestions about adding more wine or bottle clam juice to increase the amount of broth. This is a great dish to make when you don't have a lot of time to cook. I would definitely make it again.

Thanks to the former reviewers I tried this and just loved it. I added cornstarch to thicken the sauce otherwise I followed the recipe as written.This is easy, light and very tasty. My husband and I are both looking forward to having it again.

My husband and I both love this dish. We make it at least once a week. It is super easy to throw together and is delicious. I disagree with the cooks who complained about the sauce being too thin. I have had linguine with red and/or white clam sauce at numerous Italian restaurants and the sauce has always been thin.

this was the absolutely best white clam sauce i have ever made....

Who decided that clam sauce should be thick and creamy? This recipe has the basic idea down. Clam sauce should be more like a rich broth. Forget cream, sour cream, or (?)cornstarch. Use both butter and extra virgin olive oil, lots of wine and garlic, add some bottled clam juice, reduce liquid down to a broth with body. Add clams at the last minute. Fresh parsley only, preferably flat Italian. And adding fresh clams is awesome! Garnish with some fresh parmesan, more fresh parsley, and lemon wedges on the side.

Excellent...my husband said it was the best he has ever had!!! My 14-month old even ate it.

I found this to be bland, as other reviews mentioned. I took a review tip and added a tablespoon of corn starch to thicken the sauce - this helped. If I make it again I will add more sour cream and perhaps try sherry as a substitution for white wine.

This recipe was pretty good. To prevent the clams from getting tough, I added them to the sauce at the very end (I read this somewhere and it's true). I also mixed in the sour cream at the end. I also agree with the other reviewer that the sauce is a bit thin, so I added 1 tablespoon of cornstarch which made a nice, smooth thick sauce (if this is too thick for your taste, you can always thin it out with some milk or wine). Then, to make it less bland, I added white pepper and about 2 teaspoons of lemon juice to taste. Finally, the addition of fat-free parmesan cheese was the finishing touch!! Overall, a very easy and tasty dish.

Although I used regular sour cream and doubled the recipe for my husband and me (6 ozs of pasta is a joke), I would make this recipe again. As said previously, it is lighter without all the oil.

I would have liked the sauce to be a bit thicker, and I needed to add salt and pepper, and probably less onions, but it was still delicious.

Delicious! I added more wine than the recipe called for in order to have more sauce and included steamed little neck clams as a garnish. I though the addition of the sour cream made the dish more interesting than the oiler versions I am used to getting in restaurants.
