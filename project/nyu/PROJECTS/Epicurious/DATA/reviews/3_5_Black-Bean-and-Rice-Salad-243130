Glad to see from the reviews: I'm not the only one who hates brown rice. Tastes like chewing on a wet washcloth. But my daughter is pushing it so I keep trying.....this recipe was good. I did not find the olive oil taste objectionable. And I cooked the rice about 6-7 minutes longer than stated. I normally do not tinker with recipes, but next time, I will tweak this to be a little spicy.

I made this for a holiday potluck last night as I wanted something other than the rich food we eat this time of year. I substituted the lime juice for the vinegar, and added cumin, feta cheese, cilantro, and avocado, and used less oil -- all suggested in earlier reviews. It was yummy, healthy and well-received. I will be making this to go with my family's holiday meal....so easy and so good.

If you're into really flavorful food, you might find this recipe a bit unexciting. However, with a couple additions, I really loved this dish. I added an entire bunch of chopped fresh cilantro, ground cumin, cumin seeds, crushed red pepper and cayenne, as well as fresh lime and lemon juice. I also sliced up an avocado and grilled some chicken breasts. It was great.

This was great -- easy, delish and inexpensive -- perfect for a picnic potluck. Lime juice and cilantro are a must plus next time I will add more chili pepper.

This is easy, delicious, healthy, vegetarian, inexpensive, and very flexible as a side or a main (my meat-eating husband mixed in some chicken) or a filler for a burrito or wrap. I took the advice of others and substituted lime juice for vinegar and added cilantro. Also, I don't have great access to chili peppers here so used chipotle in adobo. Think this one is going into regular rotation.

Very tasty dish, not too much work and a good vegetarian option.

This one is going in the regular rotation! Exceeded my expectations by a long shot. Only change I made was subbing lime juice for the vinegar. We ate this with pan roasted pork tenderloin sliced on top - yum! I've finally found a way to eat brown rice that doesn't make me feel slightly virtuous and more than slightly discontented. Even my husband raved - and he is more brown rice averse than I. Hoping my two year old will get on board tomorrow... what a great, easy salad to have in the fridge.

A flop as far as my son was concerned, but I and the family we treated to a picnic lunch loved it! Definitely substitute lime juice for the vinegar. Brought a nice southwest flavor. I'm making it again this week for my own lunchbox.

Used white rice instead of brown. Also served with chopped fresh cilantro, and lemon wedges. Added extra vinegar. Fresh corn was key to this dish. This is easy and inexpensive.

I forgot to add that we ate it with a dollop of guacamole on top. Yum!

Easy, tasty, healthy and inexpensive. What's not to like? I did have to cook the rice 10 extra minutes as some other reviewers suggested. I also substituted lime juice for the vinegar and a minced chipotle chili in adobo for the pepper. My 3 and 5 year old loved it!

This was fast, easy, healthy and delicious which is the perfect type of recipe for me since I'm new to the world of cooking and since I also have so little free time. Enjoy!

I give this 4 forks because it is simple, easy and delicious, and because it makes a great base recipe for all sorts of salads, wraps and main courses, hot or cold. We made it for dinner last night, using an Anaheim pepper, balsamic vinegar, sweet corn from our garden, and basmati rice...it was fantastic. Today, I'm having it for lunch - heated up with a bit of sour cream and a squeeze of lime juice, wrapped in a corn tortilla. I love things like this that are so easy, tasty, nutritious, cheap and adaptable. That is until I marry someone rich and can stay at home and cook 24x7...then it's beouf bournguinon all the way, baby! ;)

Quick, easy and inexpensive. Followed the recipe exactly. Next time I will subsitute the white vinegar with a more flavorful one.

Very easy to make. I added some baby scallops to make it a meal. I also added cilantro, lime juice, cayenne pepper and pasilla chile powder. I also used a fresh pasilla chile since I couldn't find the one in the recipe. Will make again.

Excellent - easy to prepare, nutritious, and yummy!I added the juice from half a lime as well.

I really like this recipe. My husband is actually a fan and that's saying a lot since he's anti-brown rice. I love the simplicity of the dish.

It's a good recipe but the olive oil is excessive. The olive oil flavor was overpowering. Do yourself a favor and: 1. use half the recommended amount to cook the onion/garlic mixture..or maybe even use vegetable oil? 2. drizzle in the dressing little by little so you don't put all 3 tablespoons in...you wont need it all.

Really really good! A great summer side dish because it needs no refrigeration. I added chopped mango and it was a nice balance of sweet with the vinegar tang and the heat of the cubanelle.

Salad went great with Peruvian chicken from this site. Had to cook the rice about 15 min extra. Followed recipe exactly aside from substituting an Anaheim chili pepper. Turned out great- had an interesting flavor.

Awesome recipe to use as a base and add what you've got. I had half a pkg of pre-cooked wild rice from Trader Joe's in the fridge - used that instead of brown rice, and added feta. YUM! It would be really good with avocado in it too - but what isn't?

Ingredients are cheap. Doubled the ingredients aside from the onion, easily provides 5+ meals for a single person. Substituted jalapenos for cubanelle. Great staple food for those on a budget looking for something healthy. Tastes great with shredded cheddar on top or some chipotle ranch dressing.

Delicious! It has a great creamy taste (without the cream). You can easily cut the oil in half.

This is a great recipe, quick and easy. I didn't have any peppers on hand, but I did drizzle a little tabasco sauce on it. I also subbed out the white vinegar for balsamic. Overall, this is a great recipe, and I would definitely make it again.

This is a simple recipe, both in its ease of preparation and in its beauty. I think I've made it three times in the past six weeks. Delicious and nutritious!

While this looks delicious, I certainly couldn't see a kid eating this at the school lunch table. I was an adventurous eater, but was embarrassed to have something that wasn't in sandwich form (at least until high school).

Outstanding and delicious. Didn't need all the oil called for if using a nonstick pan for the saute.

This was really good - it went together quickly (after the rice cooked). I didn't have a Cubanelle chile, so I subbed a couple chipotles I had in the fridge. And what is the "speed limit" on the recipe. Didn't get that.
