I left out the Coconut Milk, since I had none in the house. Served this during a snack break with friends and they couldn't keep themselves out of the bowl. I never had time to break out the Arugula. They dove in with tortilla chips. It was a hit! Will make again!

absolutely fantastic dressing! Doubled it and used the same amount of canned chipotle pepper in adobo instead of the jalepeno. served with grilled steak leftovers, a whole mango, 1/2 a cucumber, some thinly sliced red onion and romaine lettuce. will definitely make again.

Good dressing, even with the substitutions I had to make (soy sauce for fish sauce, garlic for shallot, no mango because it still wasn't ripe enough). Served it over butter lettuce with mint and just the avocado and it was great. Nice and light with lots of flavor.

I do have to add that I wasn't crazy about the arugula. I substituted romaine lettuce for half the arugula and liked the result. Bibb lettuce would probably be even better.

Yum! I added two chicken breasts. I cut each in half, marinated them in fresh lime juice for about 15 minutes, and then sauteed them in peanut oil.

Absolutely delicious! I made it with bib lettuce because I had it on hand. Can't wait to make it again with added chicken for a main. Really really wonderful recipe.

This is a keeper. I served this as a first course for a Vietnamese dinner party. I added boiled shrimp that marinated for a few hours in the dressing. I made the dressing the day before and when I do it again I will add more jalapenos, It seemed to mellow overnight.

Awesome dressing, I used it in a avocado and shrimp salad. The dressing is pack full of subtle flavor, I had to add a little more lime juice to mellow out my fish sauce which was quite potent. Delicious!
