This recipe is so easy and the cheese adds a great taste to the eggs. I used the light version of the cheese which is soft and melt nicely into the eggs, cooked the eggs on medium low setting which worked perfect. I would definitely fix this for Easter or Mothers Day for guests!

My whole family thought the cheese was too strong with the eggs.

I'm sure I would have liked this better were circumstances different. I couldn't find Boursin, only laughing cow low fat herbed garlic cheese. Boy, that was Not Right for this recipe. I was also serving quite a few side dishes to 12 people, so the asparagus was quite cold by the time it got to the table, and the eggs were cooling fast. It most certainly did not turn out as hoped. If I make it again, I'll make it as one or two dishes for fewer people, so it can be eaten while it's warm. Good cheese is a must.

Yummy and quick! We had this last night with a side of fried potatoes and onions and a glass of wine. This will make a nice warm-weather eat-on-the-deck dinner. Would be great for brunch, too.

Having cooked for many years, I feel I can easily give this 3 forks without trying. It may be more after trying it on Mothers Day. After reading the reviews I am confused about scrambling eggs for 25 minutes which is no where in the recipe. I can't imagine cooking any eggs for 25 minutes.

Scrambled eggs do not have to be cooked on a low heat for 25 minutes. Who has the time. The trick to creamy scrambled eggs is to gently cook them until just before they're set, remove from heat and let the heat in the pan finish cooking them. I guarantee that they will be creamy even without cheese, butter or cream.

I made this for a Mother's Day brunch, and it was a huge hit! Very elegant and delicious.

I agree with the cook from Ottawa. The longer you take to scramble the eggs, on the lowest possible heat, the creamier and yummier they are. I use free range eggs called 'Country Golden Yolks' which have a lot more flavor than the pale-yolk eggs we usually buy today. The Boursin cheese is delicious!

Cutting the recipe in half, I enjoyed this as a quick, very satisfying dinner. Couldn't resist tasting boursin on toasted wheat pita chips while I cooked!! Steamed the asparagus. Will experiment with adding sauteed shallots to the eggs next time.

To: Cook from Estes Park, CO on 06/17/02 Sorry noone has answered you...you can simply add water and wisk, a tablespoon or so. Milk even works. Good Luck!

I made this for a Sunday brunch with guests. It won RAVE reviews. The eggs were very creamy.

So simple and delicious as is, while leaving you plenty of room to add whatever you want and still make it yummy. Ham, paprika, tomato, scallions - anything and everything else! I heard "Mmm, it was so good," all night.

Fantastic dish!! I did not find the eggs to be rubbery at all. Anyone who would spend half an hour scramling eggs is out of his mind (and will end up eating eggs with the texture of a dish cloth).

Has anyone heard of adding a little white vinegar to scrambled eggs prior to cooking to keep them fluffy? I've wanted to give it a try but didn't want to ruin a half dozen eggs.

This is a simple, tasty breakfast dish and makes a wonderful presentation. He thought it was missing a little something but I thought it was great!

This recipe was awesome! I made it for Mother's Day brunch and everyone raved! I used a cheaper version of Boursin that was just a plain cheese spread and added my own herbs- worked great! Also, I did not make the butter sauce for the asparagus- I think it would have ruined the dish. The textures matched perfectly- I undercooked the asparagus a bit for a sturdier texture to stand up to the creamy eggs. Delicious!

You can't go wrong with asparagus, yum! But scrambled eggs really should be made over low heat and for much longer than is recommended. It should take 25-30 minutes to scramble the eggs. They can be rubbery if you cook too fast.
