I have made this 4 times in 2 months and my cooking novice daughter did too- always gets raves from the crowd. Great addition to my recipe box!

This potato salad is so awesome! We absolutely loved it exactly as the recipe is written. We will definitely make this again.

Great recipe to brighten up potato salad. Didn't use tarragon since the store didn't have any, so technically it wasn't "green goddess", but it was still fantastic.

I'm in love with this recipe! I used baby red and fingerling potatoes. Added seeded diced cuke, sliced grape tomatoes, and capers. Also used extra anchovies and tarragon. Yummie!!

For me, this recipe is a big winner. Rave reviews. People licked the bowl clean! We love tarragon and anchovies so I doubled the amounts for both. We used anchovies wrapped around capers, which was great. The second time I made this, I added cherry tomatoes (halved) and shrimp. Same outstanding results. I plan to make the dressing part of my standard repertoire.

This was SPECTACULAR!!!!!! I made one mistake in that I added a T. of rice wine vinegar (thinking it was white wine vinegar) and upon noticing, added the remaining 2T. correctly. I also used veganaise instead of mayo! I LOVED THIS!! I will never make another potato salad recipe again (and I don't LOVE potato salad to begin with).

My guests raved about this recipe! I made a little extra dressing and added capers as one reviewer suggested. (Great idea!) Beyond that, I wouldn't change a thing and will make it many times again this summer.

I made this for Father's Day and it was good but my husband didn't like it and the leftovers will go in the trash.

Made this for a bbq and it got rave reviews. Used a mix of new potatoes including purple which added some nice colour. I simply steamed them with their skins on. I had my greek mother in law avoiding the greek salad and filling up on this. Will definitely make again.

Very nice recipe. I would add diced cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, and egg just to expand it a bit. The sauce is delicious. My guests all loved it.

I had this at a dinner party and I begged for the recipe. It was the best potato salad I'd ever had. I've made it as-written since then, and I wouldn't change a thing.

This is a great recipe. The potatoes I had on hand were medium- sized red-skinned potatoes, so after cooking and cooling them I just cut them into bite-sized portions. An earlier writer suggested adding capers. This sounded good, so I put them in a side dish just to try. The salad is great with or without them, and I would do the same thing next time. Otherwise I didn't change a thing, and wouldn't in the future.

Love it. Have made it as is, and with asparagus, without the veggies, and am going to try capers and hard boiled eggs next! Great find and have had wonderful feedback! I am making it to take to a party on Nantucket by special request tomorrow :)

Delicious recipe. All the flavors really add to the dish, so try not to make any substitutions.

Exceptional potato salad as is!! This is my new potato salad recipe! You would never know there are anchovies in it, but it adds a wonderful taste to the blend!

This was absolutely amazing. I will never make potato salad another way ever again.

Nice flavor. I subbed nonfat yogurt for half the mayo, and all was well. Also I added capers, just because it seemed sporting. Be careful with the tarragon; the stuff can be very potent, especially when put through a processor. But overall, this was a nice twist on ordinary potato salad.
