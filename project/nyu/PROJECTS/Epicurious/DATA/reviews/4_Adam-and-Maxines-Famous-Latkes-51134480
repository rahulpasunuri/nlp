Okay, I had a big problem with these. They tasted delicious, but they looked gross! I grated the potatoes an hour before I cooked them, i kept them wrapped in the cloth towel, but the potato turned first yellow then ultimately black. I was afraid to hold them in cold water, as i thought they would absorb too much water, but I guess that is what I should have done. I was not sure about making them an hour ahead of serving as i thought they would get soggy.

So easy (especially grating the potatoes and onions in a food processor) and so good! I used panko and fried them in a combo of peanut oil and duck fat, and used less salt and no pepper. They did not need any topping.

I loved them, followed the recipe exactly, but they were a bit too salty. Otherwise, texture and taste were great. Will definitely make again with less salt.

Excellent! Nice and crunchy. Made the recipe exactly as written. Would cut the salt to 2 teaspoons next time--and there definitely will be a next time.

I made this recipe pretty much exactly as instructed (except I used whole-wheat panko crumbs because I didn't have regular breadcrumbs). I have to say they were the BEST latkes I've ever made or even tasted: crisp and greaseless, with a very traditional flavor. My favorite thing about this recipe is that I was able to make all the latkes and keep them hot in the oven so that we could all sit down together and i wasn't stuck in the kitchen flipping latkes while everyone else ate. I never thought of holding the finished latkes at a higher (rather than warm) temperature. This recipe is a keeper for many Hanukkahs to come!
