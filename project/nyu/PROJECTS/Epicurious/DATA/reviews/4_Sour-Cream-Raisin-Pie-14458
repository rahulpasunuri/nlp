This was quite good for the minimal amount of work involved. I used three whites for the meringue for a higher topping.

I grew up on the sour cream raisin pie in the NYT cookbook. My aunt made it every thanksgiving, so now it's a tradition I continue. Last year I didn't have the cookbook handy so grabbed this recipe. It wasn't until I had all the ingredients out that I realized this one had a meringue. I thought it was odd but decided to go with it. OMG this pie rocked! I loved the old one, but it was almost more of a sentimental thing. Last thanksgiving was the first time the sour cream raisin pie was the first to go, and I plan on making this one from now on.

Flavour is good. The addition of meringue seems odd to me, and doesn't add much contrast in presentation or flavour. But perhaps it's traditional. An interesting experiment but not something I'll do again.

This was excellent!!! easy to make and everyone loved it. I did change it a bit by soaking the raisns in Brandy. My uncle loved it (it is his favorite) and everyone else at the dinner did too.

This pie was very easy to put together, and my father was pleased I found a recipe that tasted like what his family used to make.

Delicious. Even guests who scrunched their noses at the idea of a sour cream raisin pie, loved it. Seriously. But I will make a few changes next time. Double the custard but not the raisins (heavy on raisins). This will also help with the volume of merigue. (I added egg whites from another recipe).

This was my Mother's favorite pie made my her Mother. After my Grandmother died, her recipe went with her. This is the first one that I came across that is just like hers. I did change it up a little, instead of soaking the raisins in water, I replaced half of the water with spiced rum. Great recipe!

I am stingy with fork ratings but am tempted to give four here. I made this pie as desert for a casual dinner with friends. There were only four of us, but there was no pie left at the close of the evening. I have been searching for the perfect raisin pie; in comparison to the other raisin pie recipe on this site (see "raisin pie"), this one, I think, comes out ahead. Follow the recipe to the letter for excellent results. Or, for a grander pie, build a deeper crust and increase the amounts of all ingredients by half.

Delicious! This recipie was quite easy, although a little time consuming. I also couldn't wait for the raisins to soak and instead let them simmer for an hour or so while I made another pie.

Very nice, easy-to-make holiday pie. I soaked the raisins in brandy which I thought made it more interesting.

This pie is delicious and very unique. My father's Grandma used to make him raisin pie as a child so I decided to try it for Thansgiving. He truly loved it. I used 1/2 raisins and 1/2 currants. Also, to cut soaking time I lightly boiled the fruit with 2 slices of lemon and drained. A very unique pie with lots of flavor.

I made this for a friend's birthday who said it was his favorite pie growing up. He said it was better than the one he remembered. Everyone at the party really enjoyed it. I used low fat sour cream and it still worked great.

Good easy to make pie - a store bought crust works fine though. You may want to add a couple extra egg whites to make the merangue higher.

Very good! Works fine with refrigerated pie crust which has been baked for 9 minutes at 425 degrees. For fans of Marie Callender's sour cream raisin pie, this is a good approximation, though doesn't stand as tall as the restaurant's version.
