I didn't have coriander seeds so I used fennel seeds. I let the pork chops sit with the rub for about 20 minutes. For me the rub was enough to coat 5 chops. The finished product was delicious.

Great pork chop recipe and so quick and easy! I put the rub on about two hours before cooking and the chops were extremely flavourful and very tender and juicy.

Surprisingly good: juicy and flavorful. Worth the extra effort to toast and coarsely grind the spices. Served with the tomato chipotle salsa from the last page of the Sept. 2007 Gourmet. Leftover meat made a fabulous sandwich with lettuce, Jersey tomato slices, and a little mayo mixed with a little of the leftover salsa.

These chops were absolutely phenomenal. I'd recommend letting the chops sit after rubbing them with the spice mixture so they marinate a little bit (the garlic juice will seep in). Served to a picky eater with rave reviews!

Quick and easy. Followed the recipe exactly except I also made a gravy while the chops were resting on a warmed plate. Added a bit of finely ground pepper to the gravy and it went very well with the baked potatoes.

I liked the new combination of spices for pork but it was lacking something, possibly sweet. Without the lime juice it would have been boring. I agree with others that the amount of ingredients could be increased.

This was nothing special. I wouldn't go through the trouble to toast and grind the corinader/cumin; rather I'd use already gound spices. The chops were juicy which was totally unexpected.

Great flavour but next time I would double the dry rub recipe..it wasn't enough. I added the cranberry sauce from another pork chop recipe and will definetly make it again.

These were moist and very tasty. My boyfriend even commented on how delicious they are, and that means a lot since he doesn't usually express an opinion on whether or not something is good - unless it is very good. It was quick, too, which is a bonus in my book.

Weird texture. Didn't like at all.

Very good dish, but I suggest adding more spices than just a tablespoon.

I used ground coriander and cumin instead of whole toasted seeds, but the chops came out perfectly moist & delicious. Plus, they're incredibly quick & easy to prepare.

Didn't think I had cumin, so I used rosemary w/the coriander, then found cumin and added it to the rub. Delicious! Very tender & juicy. Served it with sauerkraut from another epicurious.com recipe.The whole meal was out of this world!

Probably the best compliment of this recipe came from our 10-year old daughter. She said, "Daddy, this reminds me of the food we had when we went on vacation." Vacation was the South of France. The pork chops were tender, cooked the European way: long and slow over a low flame.

Very good! I usually don't fry my pork chops because they normally get too tough. These were very moist. As a side dish I made couscous flavored with cumin and scallions. Delicious!

Pork turned out as tender as you could ask for. Do use the roasted whole seeds, coarsely ground --adds a nice crunch.

Not so good. There are a lot better ways to prepare pork chops. My husband didn't even finish these, and he always eats everything.

A very good dish I make often. I also use already ground cumin and coriander for ease.

Very fast and easy. I was really impressed with how juicy the chops were after frying. I used olive oil cooking spray; next time I'll use the tablespoon of oil to prevent burning. I used already ground cumin and coriander instead of the seeds. I also feel next time I will use garlic powder just to make for an easier rub.

I made this for friends after getting off work. It was super easy and delicious. Deglazed the pan for tasty gravy over garlic mashed potatoes. I'll definitely do this one again.
