This is the perfect spring dessert if you're making a complicated menu and want something simple but elegant for dessert - that's light and not too sweet. The elegant part, though, comes with presentation. If you have stemmed glasses with wide rims and little cappuccino spoons ... that's the trick.

Very easy to make and delicious. Used yogurt

If you like rhubarb, this is a simple, delicious desert that looks pretty enough to serve to company. I agree with the other review - the redder the rhubarb the better the presentation. I've also substituted creme frais or yogurt for the sour cream - whatever I have on hand. They all work well.

I have made this recipe several times -- it is easy, not too sweet, and has alway gotten rave reviews from my guests.

This was very easy to make -- and who would have thought - rhubarb and ginersnaps. I would suggest using as red of rhubarb as you can find for the sake of appearance. My rhubarb was greener and the final color didn't look so good - but it tasted great!
