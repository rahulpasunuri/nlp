Delicious. Like others, I found the bake step unnecessary. (I had some leftover gazpacho that I added; a plus

It was delish! Don't know that it needed to be baked once mixed together as I had made pasta al dente.

Excellent dish, followed exact recipe. I might add a pinch more of the crushed red pepper but I like a little more kick. Otherwise it was fabulous!Goes great with grilled rack of lamb. Definitely a keeper!

I've made this dish a couple times with wonderful results. It can even be adapted to vegan and gluten-free diets by omitting the feta (still has amazing flavor) and using gluten- free pasta. Following other recommendations, I used fire-roasted tomatoes and balsalmic vinegar. Not following many recommendations, I find the last step of baking the pasta necessary and worth the effort. It helps the slightly undercooked pasta to absorb the flavors of the sauce.

This was a tasty dinner that left us with lots of leftovers for later in the week. Really nice mix of flavors. I used balsamic vinegar and about a third less feta cheese than the recipe called for.

I omitted the olives and added turkey sausage for my family who doesn't consider vegetarian food a true meal. Also, with the addition of the turkey sausage subbed goat cheese for feta as some had suggested. Absolutely delicious.

Good, flavorful recipe. I always skip the feta, and have substituted parsely for basil. Sundried tomatoes work well here too.

Served for a dinner party last night, and received positive reviews from all. Didn't have but 7 ounces feta, which wasn't enough. The crushed red pepper made the most difference. Also used fire roasted tomatoes. yum.

Definitely an easy, satisfying dish. If not making ahead, the baking step can be skipped.

Great recipe to serve to vegetarians. Makes a great potluck dish too. Very easy to make.

This was excellent and pretty easy for a week night dinner. The eggplant added a meaty texture to the dish which made my husband happy. I used goat feta and added some grated parmesan on top for extra cheesiness. I also saw no reason to bake this dish and just added the hot cooked pasta directly into the pan of the sauce.

This is a good make ahead dish. Just beware that the heating time if made ahead is 40 minutes (not 20) if it is at room temp.

The olives and feta keep this from being really bland. It's not remarkable italian food but it's decent and a good option when you need a make ahead solution to serve a crowd that includes vegetarians. It's also reasonably healthy. I might try to up the red pepper next time and think of some other flavor additions...

We cut down the olive oil to 1 tablespoon and used half ricotta cheese and half feta cheese--it added a subtle creaminess and was delicious. The leftovers were great to take to work the next day too :)

Also used mozzarella and parmesan as another reviewer suggested; we halved the recipe and it turned out fine. "egglpant" was delicious.

This was really good and so easy to make! And it was great to be able to make it a day ahead of time and then just pop it in the oven when my guests arrived. I left off the cheese for my vegan father and it was still good. Otherwise, I made it exactly as written.

A great pasta recipe! if you want a low carb meal, this is a good one for you because there is so much sauce/veggies in proportion to the noodles. Thanks to previous reviewers i did not take the time to bake the pasta after cooking it. But i did need to cook the sauce for about 20 minutes longer than specified because i don't like my eggplant not fully cooked. I used a goat feta to top the pasta and it was a good choice because it's milder and sweeter than regular feta. I did not use as much oil...only about 1-2 tablespoons and that was enough. Definitely do not omit the olives. they give a nice, subtle flavor.

This is a fabulous dish! You can use less olive oil if you want to. It is actually a pretty light and healthy dish. I make it for dinner parties the day before, then pop it in the oven before guests arrive. I serve it with garlic rolls and roasted chicken. YUM!

Good flavor, easy prep. It's even good at room temperature! The eggplant is earthy and filling.

Excellent dish, used mozzarella and parmesan instead of feta cheese and added it before baking, also 8oz of cheese was more than enough. The spices were less as per the directions, definitely needed more hot flakes and seasoning also salt was not mentioned. Overall excellent the black olives really add to it.

Rating: 3
Thought this was quite tasty. Was outvoted, and had to make without black olives. Nonetheless, it turned out well.. a bit of a slight sweet edge from the roasted red pepper and eggplant. You could definitely up the pepper flakes to add some more heat. Tip: undercook the pasta initially, as it will finish cooking in the oven.

This is a great dish to feed a crowd. You can also make the sauce ahead and freeze it. We like it better with goat cheese substituted for the feta.

A very good recipe for a party if you don't mind heating it beforehand. I received lots of compliments and it serves a big group. The flavors go well together.

This is a great dish! I roasted the red pepper (400 oven for approx. 25 minutes, peeled and cut into strips). Served with a salad w/balsamic vinagrette and freshly baked bread. Yum!

I have made this recipe for dinner guests three times (different guests)everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. It's easy and very tasty, I served it with Chicken Piccata, a green salad and some crusty French Bread.

This meets my easy-nice to look at-tastes great- criteria! Not too unhealthy for you either! I used 1/2 -2/3 amount of feta. I don't think the baking, and thus another dirty pan and hot kitchen, are necessary. Kids enjoyed it too!

My husband made this dish last night and it was really fantastic! He prepared it the night before and so it was perfect for a middle of the week party. We also used less feta cheese than is called for. We will definitely make it again.

I did bake it and liked how it came out, but would try not baking it too. I thought the tastes were great and I would definitely make it again. As written, it makes a TON of food. I brought it to a brunch with 10 people, everyone took some, and there was still a lot left. Since it only calls for 1 lb of pasta I didn't anticipate the quantity.

This is an excellent dish if you don't know what people like to eat. Most people like pasta and you don't have to worry about if they eat meat or not. I cook it in a big oval dish (not the pan as they suggest - perhpas that helps keep it moist and flavourful). Great flavour, presents well, and you can prepare it in advance. It's perfect!

An excellent recipe and quick to make - 1 hour from start to finish. I didn't bother baking it - I assumed those directions were for if you made it ahead of time. I also only made 3/4 of the recipe and it worked out fine.

What really makes this recipe is its versatility: I've used the tomatoes and olives as a base sauce for other vegetables, including zucchini, mushrooms, or even on its own. It's also excellent as a pizza sauce, topped with provolone. A definite keeper.

This is a terrific dish, just bursting with wonderful flavors! I would definitely make it again but felt that the baking actually detracted from the quality, drying it out disappointingly. The "samples" from the stovetop, made the night before, were perfect! Finally, the quantity of feta cheese called for must be a mistake...4 ounces or so would have done.

I've made this twice now, it's a healthy & satisfying 'comfort food' type of dish. I added diced extra-firm tofu for protein & am having leftovers for lunch this week. I don't see the point of baking it, either - won't bother next time. Used different varieties of eggplant, japanese, white, and Italian - tasted great.

I also only used about half the feta cheese, and that was plenty. Although the eggplant and cheese added a bit of richness to this dish, I found the overall results bland and unsatisfying. My husband and I didn't even finish the leftovers.

Why do we bake it? A bit fussy for just a pasta recipe. I loved the olives though! But I found it to be a bit average.

I made it this weekend for my very Italian family and they all loved it. The combination of flavors worked very well. I used only 12 oz. of feta initially and that was plenty. I used the additional as we warmed up leftovers. Very easy and quick to prepare

A fantastic dish! The kalamata olives gave it a nice zing and provided contrasting texture to the eggplant. We used garlic wine vinegar and not as much feta as the recipe called for. The flavor of the fresh basil was really evident. A great main course for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike.
