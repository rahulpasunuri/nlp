This is amazing. Perhaps the best terrine I've ever tasted and the presentation is spectacular with the whole shallots running down the middle of the terrine. Perfect with a slice of toast and cornichon. I thought I had enough duck breasts in my freezer but didn't so I made up the rest with skinless chicken thighs. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. Wonderful flavor and texture. The shallot glaze on top added even more depth of flavor. I weighted it down overnight with three fire bricks (about 15 pounds) and I ended up with a dense terrine that sliced perfectly. Pity more people haven't tried to make this. It really wasn't difficiult.

Fantastic! I wanted this to go with bread so instead of putting whole shallots in the middle, I chopped and caramelised them with the red wine and then spread the mixture on top. I also did not wrap with fat. It was excellent.

REVIEW FOR SHALLOTS ONLY: I made these shallots as part of an antipasto, and they were great. Everyone loved them.

Tasty, but not a 4-forker. This may have been my fault however as I used pekin as opposed to moulard duck breast. Although i was extremely scrupulous about chilling during the grinding step, there was still a lot of fat separation / pooling duringh cooking, which i suspect this was due to the higher relative fat content of the pekin breasts. Also, i went a little lazy on this and did not include the shallots - still very good.
