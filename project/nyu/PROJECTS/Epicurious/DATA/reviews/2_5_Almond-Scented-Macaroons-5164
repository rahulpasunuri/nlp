these are not macaroons.... macaroons are made with beaten egg whites, full stop. don't even bother with these!

It's a typo: it should read "Cool on sheet for five minutes" not "Cook on sheet for five minutes".

I think the baking instructions for these cookies may be faulty- the way the recipe us written, it sounds as though they are meant to be baked twice. I'm thinking one eight minute bake time would be sufficient as macaroons are meant to be chewy (and not flattened, usually.) If some reviewers have flattend theirs, then baked them twice,- well, no wonder they were hard. I'll try them my way and let you know what happens.

I was very hopeful for this recipe, but it was a total flop. Cookies are super tough/chewy and don't even have a good flavor. Very disappointing!

My father loves coconut macaroons, so when he came for a visit, I made these cookies. They were very easy to make, and he loved them! I haven't made them in quite a while, but want to make them for Dad again, so I searched until I found this exact recipe again. Definitely a keeper (in my files this time!)

I made a double batch of these for a weekend when I was hosting two parties - they flopped at both! They were more than chewy... hard is more like it.

These were very easy to make, smelled nice, and were moist. I won't, however, make them again. There were very bland, I definitely was not impressed by them.

I made these (tripled recipe) for my son Joshua when he visited me. On his way back to his home, he stopped to visit another relative and made the mistake of telling the relative about the cookies. Needless to say, the cookies were eaten and never made it home. I just now mailed him another batch. By the way, they are great with drizzled melted chocolate chips on top, a great idea from Grace Bright.

Great easy and fun cookie to make. It was a big hit at Christmas Eve dinner. I doubled the recipe to make more and I am glad that I did. They went quickly

Made these for my 80+ year old father...he rates them as the VERY best, they (cookies) are well traveled as I live in Phila, PA and he in Los Angeles...cookies baked East, shipped West. Thanks.
