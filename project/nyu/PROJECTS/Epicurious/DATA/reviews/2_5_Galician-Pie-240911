I agree with the previous review saying this dish is bland. It is however, a great starting point. The first time I made it exactly as directed. It was time consuming and a bit disappointing in the end. The second time around I made the dough with a dough hook in my stand mixer and it came out perfectly. The filling needs to be bumped up. I subbed cilantro for the parsley and doubled it, used twice the chorizo and twice the chicken, and added 8 oz sliced chihuahua cheese. I also sprinkled the top of the egg wash with sea salt. The filling to crust ratio seemed much better. I cooked it in my 12 inch cast iron skillet, and the time/temp directions were pretty much spot on. I did cover the top with foil for the last 10 minutes to keep the crust from over-browning. The crust on this is really really thick, making this a great dish to serve along side soup or salad.

I tried this tonight. A lot of work for not much flavor. I used cajun smoked sausage instead of chorizo and some chicken. The filling needs some kind of sauce to make it more like a pot pie. It's too dry. The crust is ok but it cooked to much on top and I didn't cook it the full 45. I may try it again but will change the dryness factor and add more seasoning.

We have been making Empanada in my family fr many generations since we are from Galicia. You can make it without the peppers ( I actually prefer it that way), also add a pinch of cumin and saffron for flavor. You can fill it with whatever you like, mussels, octopus, tuna fish, chorizo....anything that your heart desires is a good filling for this pie. However I wouldn't recommend putting live crabs in there as a great aunt supposedly did years ago, thestory says that the Empanada ran out of the oven....lol

I'd like to try this, but hate bell peppers. Anyone have suggestions for substitution? I've never made this kind of meat pie before.
