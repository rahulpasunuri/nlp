AMAZING!!!! Our favorite. Sauce and all. I eat the sauce by itself....

Also tweaked as we eat low sodium diet most times. cut way back on soy (lite) and veg oil. doubled lime as recommended, sriracha (no chile in house)and marinated a flat iron steak for several hours. not concerned about saltiness w/reduced soy in recipe. outstanding!!!

Rating: 3
Loved this for the strong flavours though it wasn't quite Korean, perhaps fusion of Korean and Thai. I was tempted to marinate it longer but the saltiness would have been too high. The sauce was fantastic, though perhaps next time I'd use a bit less oil and a bit more chilli. It wasn't nearly fiery enough. Next time I'll try it with a cheaper cut of meat.

This is very good. A few necessary fixes to the sauce: add much more lime, some rice vinegar to taste- needs acidity. Didn't need as much veggie oil. Made with strip steaks, very good. Sides were roasted cauliflower with garlic and sesame oil, and wild rice.

absolutely delicious!

This sauce is unbelievably good! I double the lime juice and cilantro and puree all of the sauce ingredients in the blender. It makes a beautiful vibrant green sauce. I pair the steak with the jasmine rice with green onions, peas and lemon from this site (the sauce is good on the rice too)! YUM!

I have been making this recipe since 2001. I use wild game, either venison or moose, and it is my all time favorite way to grill steak. If you get the chance the wild game character really adds another dimension to this recipe.

Rating: 3
Unfortunately, we don't have a grill so we have to cook the steaks in a pan, but they are still always very tasty. I bet they'd be even better on the grill. The sauce is a bit oily, so I use less oil, and sometimes they turn out too salty so be careful with the soy. Regardless, this is a great steak dish for a warm-weather party or something. Looking forward to cooking it once I finally buy myself a grill.

I made this tonight in -2 degree weather. My neighbors must think that I am insane. I was really craving BBQ, and had flank steak on hand...so why not? It turned out wonderfully. It was on the salty side, and I only marianated for 45 min. I would think that it would be way too salty if left in much longer.

This was amazing!! I made so much sauce that my husband and I made this two nights in a row! Like other reviewers said, one hour is MORE than enough time to marinate as any more than that will make your meat quite salty.

I had high hopes for this recipe based on past reviews, but it turned out to be a big disappointment. I found it to be way too salty, and I even used low sodium soy sauce. I think that if you love very strong flavors and salt, this could be wonderful. I prefer sauces like chimmichuri- flavorful, but not overpowering. I won't make this again.

Messed the first time we made and found our modification to be even better: Dump the cilantro sauce but throw the habanero or serrano into the marinade! Use Red wine for the sherry. Boil down the marinade afterwards to server over rice or extra on the steak. Don't marinade for more than 90 minutes or the soy sauce will make it too salty. Our friends and family have loved this and usually ask for the recipe.

Great marinade, my husband will usually only eat filet, but this makes lower cuts of steak tender and delicious.

This recipe kicks!! I marinaded a pair of 1 lb. rib eyes twice as long as recommend. When grilled to perfection I slit the rib eyes cross wise and poured the cold cilantro sauce over the sizzling steaks. Very nice* Call me mad cap but tonight I am going to use this same recipe on grilled chicken. No guts no glory!

I was looking forward to making this b/c of all the great reviews but i have to agree with a reviewer from 2001- too salty! My husband liked it more than I did. So I would make it again but I would reduce the soy sauce and probably would leave it out of the cilantro sauce. Maybe then I can rate it higher. Right now I'm not a fan!

this is very similar to the skirt steak with cilantro garlic sauce recipe which i like a bit more. the sauce is very simple but so good i could eat vats of it. this marinade is great but next time i might use the other sauce which doesn't include soy or seasame oil which i thought overpowered the cilantro a bit.

This is really good. The first time I made it, I did not have Sesame oil. Made without oil, I did it by the book. It was great. Next time I sprang for the oil, but couldn't find habanaro peppers...subsituted serrano peppers with the oil...not as good. My take on the recipe - use habanaro, reduce the amount of sesame oil, and use butter instead of the final 1/3 cup of oil for the sauce. This comes from a man who has lost 35 lbs. on the low carb diet. This recipe works on the plan.

I LOVE this recipe. I tried this 2 years back and it's still a house favorite. One word of advice, choose your soy sauce wisely! I use a mushroom soy sauce called "healthy boy" and can be found in most Asian markets. It's wonderful on just about anythin you can think of, it's also incredibly lite and low fat! Enjoy.

Made this last night for my husband and I, and it was really good. We paired it with the honeydew/cucumber salad (also in Epicurious) and steamed rice. The only problem was that I only added 1 seeded serrano pepper, the dish could have used the red hot pepper or more serrano, next time.

Rating: 3
I was so excited to try this whole menu (with the soba salad, etc.) but was kind of disappointed. It didn't pull together with the cilantro sauce (and we LOVE cilantro salsas and chutneys.) I ended up pouring the leftovers over the salad (which needed something)and that was good. I didn't think the sauce really helped the steak. The marinade by itself is DEFINITELY a keeper, hence the three forks.

This is good and quite simple. The marinade reminded me of flavors I have enjoyed in Korean cooking, but the sauce seemed more Asian-fusion. That being said, it is DELICIOUS (if you like cilantro) and pretty--I would serve it with any grilled food for a nice kick. I had no sherry, so I used a mix of mirin & sake (on hand from a Japanese meal). I used flank steak, but I will use a better cut in the future, as the flank was a bit tough.

This steak was the whip! I served it this weekend to a bunch of my friends. It smelled so good while it was cooking that we had people coming up on to the porch, asking what we were preparing. I used top loin steaks and marinated them for 4 hours, other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as written. Used reviewers' suggestions: wasabi-mayo asparagus, mint and scallion noodles (good, but for a bunch of recovering college students, frighteningly close to Ramen), and I also blended the cilantro sauce in the blender. Make this recipe now!

I made this recipe with a very thick-cut NY Strip steak and served with a salad. It was delicious and offers a refreshing alternative to "meat and potatoes" preparations. The asparagus with wasabi-mayonnaise dip (also served with steamed shrimp) as an appetizer was perfect with it.

We loved it. The cilantro sauce was intriguing and received many favorable comments from everyone. I used 2 jalapeno peppers instead of the hot red chile, AND I also used one small habenero and 1 serrano chile. Turned out spicy - but not too spicy. A great side dish to accompany this meal is a Thai Cucumber Salad (sliced cucumbers, red onion and jalapeno peppers in a Sweet and Sour Sauce).

My boyfriend's a bit of a novice, but the first time he made these steks I was blown away!! Now it's becoming a housrehold recipe. Being apartment dwellers, we use a "Foreman" grill and it works fabulously. You can successfully compensate for cheaper cuts of meat with a longer marinade time and be sure to use a good soy sauce (We like Lee Kum Kee.) I think the sauce recipe can be halved. Try serving with black or jasmine rice and some steamed green beans.

Being somewhat jaded and feeling burned from a first time recipe made for guests last weekend (they enjoyed -- I did not), I was a little leery to attempt something untried again for this Saturday's dinner guests. But being the ever ready risk taker, I tried the Korean beef, and it was really excellent. I marinated for three hours and would recommend no longer than 1 1/2, otherwise the flavoring is a little overpowering and lacking the balance that I prefer. The sauce is great too for those who might be a little reluctant when reading the recipe. I just spooned it in a stream over the middle of the sliced beef in serving. The guests remarked on the presentation, raved about the sauce and asked for more! A great "do-ahead" dish for guests of any number...and of course just for that special someone as well!

I have to admit that I am not much of a beef person however the reviews intrigued so much that I had to give it a try. This recipe is outstanding in flavor and the meat is extremely tender. We did not grill quickly though. We believe in slow and low grilling to bring out the best in your food. We grilled on low-indirect heat for 20 minutes on each side. This was for medium-rare. I pureed the sauce and poured it over the sliced beef. This made a beautiful presentation. The sauce was also excellent and could be used on many other dishes as well. All I can say is this non beef lover will definitely be making this dish again and that should say it all!

this is the best steak marinade i've made. i thought my chipotle/cilantro/lime flank steak was the best, but this surpassess it. the sauce is almost not necessary if you have a good, organic cut of beef. but a frugal sprinkling atop the slices and served alongside the beef at the table, the sauce adds a wonderful kick -- i added some scallions to the mix. serve atop mashed potatoes and a simple salad ... of course a nice cote du rhone ... a sublime dinner.

I made this for a dinner party last night, marinating the strip steaks for 1-1/2 hours. The steak and sauce were absolutely delicious! My husband and guests raved about it, all giving it a hearty 4 fork rating. They were somewhat leery of the chopped chile pepper in the sauce, none being that partial to hot food, but all agreed that it was just "warm" enough, so be sure to add it to the sauce. Served it with mashed red potatoes with roasted garlic and sauteed baby carrots. If making for more than 4, I would double the sauce. Will definitely make again and again as a great alternative to the same old steak and potato routine.

I made this dish for guests on Saturday night. Having read all the previous reviews, I took the hints: I used low-sodium soy sauce and doubled the recipe for the cilantro sauce.

I got rave reviews as well as requests for the recipe...which to me is the highest compliment!

Giving this three forks, although I believe that the marinading time is wrong. I followed the recipe exactly, and marinaded a flank steak for 90 minutes. I could barely taste the marinade. I think 3 hours would have been right. For a top sirloin (London Broil), I would think you'd need to marinade it overnight. As it has no lime juice, you it would be pretty hard to over-marinate.

I used low sodium soy sauce and my family did not think this dish was too salty. Also, must confess I was not paying attention and combined all of the ingredients (including cilantro sauce ingredients) for the marinade. Thus, we ate it with out the cilantro sauce.

I made this dish tonight along with Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatos, cucumber salad, and French bread. I also used Top sirloin as suggusted by others, The sauce part was Great, I doubled it and I have some left over that I will used on fish, a better fit perhaps. The marinade for the meat in this recipe is by far to salty. I didn't add any salt but I think it was the soy sauce that just over powers everything. There is too much soy sauce in this recipe. All my guests said that it was good, though one who was a little more honest admitted it was a bit too salty. I will however try this again with less soy sauce. All in all, it is good.

I also used a boneless chuck roast,about 2 1/2 lbs., marinated it overnight, and grilled it for about 40 minutes instead of steaks...mmmmmm! Thanks, AGAIN, Epicurious!

This recipe was great. I would suggest making 1 and a half times the sauce - it was really great

This was so good! I was a little afraid of the cilantro sauce from a bad cilantro experience in the past but it was great. I highly recommend this recipe!

I made this last night and my daughter, who hates steak, asked for a second helping. It is definitely going into my regular rotation of recipes! Next time, i think I'll cut down on the amount of oil in the sauce and increase the chiles.

This dish is fabulous! I've made it twice in the past two months and both times my guests loved it. I recommend marinating the steaks longer than 1 hour (six hours is probably much better). For those who find sesame oil overwhelming, try using extra virgin sesame oil--it's much lighter but still provides a lot of flavor. Try serving the steaks with some Asian garlic noodles--wonderful!

This dish was fantastic!! I used top round london broil (2 of them) and marinated for about 5-6 hours. The meat was delicious right off the grill without the sauce; with the sauce it was phenomenal! Unlike some other cooks, mine looked just like the picture. I used 1/2 cilantro and 1/2 parsley (ran out of cilantro in my garden). Served it with lemon-mint orzo salad. My dinner guests raved! I will definitely make it again. Looking forward to steak sandwiches with the leftovers!

I substituted lamb leg steaks for the beef steak and it was absolutely delicious. Passed on lamb recipe to others and they concur.

This is an awesome recipe! I substituted london broil and marinated for a couple of hours and used less oil in the sauce. The remaining sauce is wonderful on salmon or chicken, either roasted or grilled.

I made this for my parents and my dad just kept say, "I've never eaten anything this good in my life!" I didn't like the look or texture of the sauce with the chopped cilantor, so I pureed it into a smooth sauce. It was fabulous!!!

This is a fabulous dish. My husband is always talking about kebabs, so I cut up steak into pieces and grilled them on bamboo skewers (soaked in water for 30 minutes) after marinating. Alongside I grilled skewer of mushrooms, chunks of zucchini, vidalia onion, and red bell pepper. I served the steak and vegetable skewers on a bed of Boston lettuce with the dressing drizzled over all. I can't wait to try this incredible recipe on friends soon. By the way, I used to dislike cilantro, but now I love it. It adds a wonderful fresh taste to this dish.

Great for a hot summer day. The marinade tenderized the steaks perfectly, and the cilantro added a great taste.(I used the Forman grill, not bad!) Will use more peppers next time. Served with rice noodles.

I made this for Fourth of July on last minute notice. Pretty simple & everyone, kids included, practically inhaled this without bothering to chew they loved it so much. It was very quiet for about half an hour. Absolutely delicious!!!

Stunning! did a little substituting on marinade ingredients to fit what I had on hand, but essentially the same recipe; made it with pork loin steaks, served w/garlic potatoes and a salad of greens, goat cheese, slivered red onion and cherries. An absolutely wonderful meal!!

This recipe was both simple and quick to prepare.I substituted flank steaks for strip steaks and served it as the main course for a midweek meal. Everyone thought it was delicious. It will find a place on my list of recipes worthy to serve to company. Unfortunately, the radish salad that was suggested to accompany this meal was boring.

This dish is absolutely delicious. The flavour is unreal! I've made it three times in the past 2 weeks. My husband hates cilantro, but he loves this dish and dosen't want me to make steak any other way. I basically followed the recipe, using half the cilantro. This dish is great for company as everything can be prepared in advance. I serve it with an Asian salad with lots of bok choy, bean sprouts, and snow peas.

I thought this dish was fantastic and I'll definitely make again. I sauteed some onions in the sauce that the steaks marinated in (which came out great), heated the second sauce that goes on top, and used a much better cut of meat--served with grilled sliced potatoes (tossed with garlic, pepper, bit of oil, sea salt) and asparagus. Great dish.

It was very good, but with the peppers indicated, was nowhere near what I would call "spicy". Needs more peppers. The sauce is very good, but needs more "kick". I also made this with the steamed snowpeas and roasted garlic potatoes and was a hit at my dad's birthday.

I wasn't impressed with the strip steaks. The marinade and cilantro sauce are wonderful. Marinaded boneless chicken thighs and they were outstanding. Sopped up the cilantro sauce with crusty bread. Definitely give the marinade and cilantro sauce 4 forks!

This was just OK, in my opinion. I liked the flavor, but it didn't overwhelm me like it did some of the other reviewers. I used new york strip stakes and they were not very good. I might have liked it better with a better cut of beef.

We followed the recipe as written. The steaks were super, savory with the right amount of spice. We cooked an extra steak and thin sliced it the next day for sandwiches.

Delicious!! We used venison steaks. I was a bit skeptical about the sauce, but I am glad we tried it.

To the cook from Ottawa, On., your side dishes rock! Can i come to dinner too?! Can't wait to try this dish.

I would say to marinate the meat for more than an hour. I felt that the meat itself didn't absorb much of the flavor of the marinade at all. The cilantro sauce was wonderful overtop though. Like another reviewer said, I would try it on other dishes as well, perhaps a piece of fish. Great dish for entertaining!

Super!! We especially liked the cilantro sauce. My husband used it on the grilled veggies I served with the steak. I can visualize using the cilantro sauce in many other ways.

This dish is wonderful--definitely had a Korean flavor. I goofed and put the cilantro sauce right in with the marinade, and it still turned out delicious. I just boiled the marinade before serving it on top of the steaks. My husband raved!

We really enjoyed this dish. We had no cilantro so we substituted fresh Vietnamese coriander which tastes similar. We roasted the garlic for the sauce and also cut back a bit on the vegetable oil.

This dish was just delicious! I served it with steamed snow peas and roasted garlic potatoes (on the BBQ in foil) and a salad with red onion, romaine, strawberries, goatcheese drizzled with balsamic vinegar. The guests just raved!

Absolutely delicious. I made this exactly like the recipe and everyone loved it. My 12-year-old daughter and a friend ate almost a pound of meat between them--they couldn't stop. Delicious flavor, and not too spicy, despite the considerable chiles.

this dish impressed my guests from start to finish and so easy to make...infact, after i marinated the steaks, i went to take my niece out of the bath who proclaimed: "you smell delicious" so it was a hit right from the get-go!

Not a big meat eater but loved this marinade. The clianto, lime juice and combination of oils made for a great flavor. This is a keeper for sure!

I just made this last week. The steaks were tender and flavorful. The sauce was delcious! Easy to make. My husband and my 6 yr old raved about it.

I actually made a guacamole-type sauce with cilantro and lime juice rather than the recipe's cilantro sauce (had no fresh hot peppers on hand), and it was very very good. Excellent steak marinade.
