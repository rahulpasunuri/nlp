I was super-lazy and used bottled teriyaki sauce (Soy Vay Island Teriyaki). Followed the recipe otherwise--well, the chicken wound up marinating for more like an hour--and everyone loved it. Maybe I shouldn't even be reviewing the recipe, but it's nice to know that this technique works well with any good teriyaki sauce.

This was the best teriyaki sauce I've had and so easy to make. Next time I'll make double the sauce to be able to use for rice and veggies.

Made this twice...used mirin and doubled the sauce. Also, used skinless boneless chicken breasts which tasted very good but a bit dry...delicious with broccoli, toasted cashews and steamed carrots.

I thought this recipe was excellent. Used chicken tenderloins rather than whole breasts. Nice and moist. Cooled them and put them on the Asian spinach salad with orange and avocado from this site.

I used skinless boneless thighs. Used ginger powder instead of fresh ginger, and minced garlic instead of mashing it into a paste. Cooked it under the broiler, reduced the sauce as directed. My husband liked it, I liked it, my 2 year old LOVED it!! And she doesn't usually like chicken. For that reason, this recipe is a keeper!

replace sherry with mirin wine and use rice vinegar instead - add sugar to taste

Excellent teriyaki and quick and easy. Took the advice of others and actually tripled the recipe. Marinated whole chicken legs and thighs for about 3 hrs. Baked in the oven, covered, with a little marinade for just about an hour and finished under the broiler to crisp the skin. Reduced the remining marinade and served with rice. Moist and delicious!!! Can't wait to try with flank steak or salmon and use as a marinade on the grill.

This is the best ever!!!! Very important to reduce the sauce. Served on top of mashed potaotes. YUMMYYY. My husband wouldnt stop saying how good it was, and that's a lot to say.

This recipie is one of my standards! I double the recipie and use it with pork tenderloin. Reduce the marinade and it makes a wonderful sauce.

This is a great recipe. The second time I made it my broiler decided not to work so I cooked it in a cast iron pan on the stove. I did not baste the chicken with the marinate or reduce it. Instead I brought the marinade to a boil and then tossed in a pound of baby carrots I had boiled for a few minutes. I let this cook until the the marinade was all gone. YUM!!!

Everyone loved this recipe. I substituted 1/4 ground ginger & 1/8 garlic powder b/c all that was on hand. Still was better than any sauce I could buy. Also baked in oven but would like to try on grill next time. Can't wait to make it again.

Love this dish. Quick and easy. I use boneless/skinless and do them on the grill. Serve with rice and a stir fried asparagus and you have a winner.

This was pretty good, but the chicken came out a bit dry and when we peeled off the skin, off came the glaze. If I make this again I will remove the skin before cooking, and probably cook it on the grill instead of making a mess in the oven.

This was simply outstanding. I doubled the recipe for 1 pound of boneless skinless breasts. No pounding; just marinated them, grilled them for about 5 minutes each side and voila, flavorful and light perfect weeknight dinner. Served with steamed jasmine rice and steamed broccoli. The whole family loved it.

The best teriyaki I've ever had. I had some boneless, skinless chicken breasts on hand, and decided to grill them rather than broil them to help keep them moist. I made thick slices of them, cutting on a bias, after cooking, and then drizzled the reduced marinade over them. Very good, very easy. This one goes in the recipe box.

I loved this dish when i baked the chicken in the marinade for 40 mins @350, I then grilled it on my BBq, great when times is short and you want max flavor

I was wondering if anyone knows if I could use this recipe with salmon instead of chicken?

Rating: 4
Really yummy. Maybe I put in too much ginger because the sauce reminded me a lot of the sauce from "SWORDFISH WITH LIME-GINGER GLAZE". That's a good thing, though, since the Swordfish recipe is my wife and my favorite dish.

Made this last weekend and it was the tastiest chicken!! I bought the breasts with the bone in, and took the bone off, but left the skin on as recommended. I pounded them to make thinner. I cooked it on medium heat on my grill pan, and turned and basted with the sauce frequently. I used it on top of a very easy "oriental salad" recipe my friend gave me: 2 packages of oriental ramen noodle soup, 1/2 c. sliverred almonds; one package each of coleslaw mix and broccoli slaw, 2 tablespoons each of white vinegar and sugar, 1/2 cup peanut oil. Take ramen noodles, crush with a hammer and saute in dry pan with almonds till golden. Then take the 2 season packets fromt he noodle mix and add remaining ingredients (mix oil, vinegar and sugar with season packets that were in soup package) and toss together with the sauteed noodles and almonds and slaws. I put the chicken strips on top before serving. WOW!!!GOTTA TRY IT.It is so freshing for the summer. Just add some white sangria (I bottle good white wine, 1 can Dole peach and white grape juice, 1/4 c triple sec, 1/4 c brandy, apple chunks,orange slices, lemon slices and alot of ice!(soak the fruit in the winde in the frig for a few hours before adding the rest of the ingredients)

It was so good! Great recipe! better than ones in japanese cook book. the second time I made I put 1/2 table spoon sake, 1/2 table spoon sherry, 1/2 table spoon mirin(japanese cooking wine), 1tablespoon water. and thicken with mixture of 1 teaspoon cornstarch+2tea spoon water. I love it!

better than restaurant teriyaki! yummmmy!

Faboo baby! This recipe is a tasty and quick. I made a few additions to make it even more enjoyable: Add some crushed red pepper flakes to the marinade to kick it up a little. Also double the quantity of marinade as the recipe calls for 11 tablespoons of liquid, which isn't nearly enough after reducing it, especially if you want to save a little to pour over some rice. I sprinkled sesame seeds on the chicken before the last 2 minutes of broiling for texture and appearance. Watch the chicken as it may tend to cook a little sooner then it says. I made this a second time within days of the first!

What a great weeknight meal! I doubled the marinade(except the honey - didn't want it to be too sweet). I baked the chicken instead of broiling, boiled the excess marinade so I could use it as a sauce over rice and steamed veggies, and topped the plates with toasted sesame seeds and sliced scallions. Yummy!

I made this recipe for a 25-person polynesian beach party - an a hit! Had better luck baking it than grilling. Served with coconut rice, grilled sweet potatoes w/lime/cilantro dressing, grilled shrimp & pineapple , tropical fruit, King's Hawaiian bread and spinach salad.

Delicious! Easy to make! I've made this several times already. I usually serve it with rice. Yum!

Excellent! I grilled the chicken, basting often w/sauce and used a combo of direct/indirect heat. Too much direct and the sauce will burn before chicken is done. I 4x the amount of sauce, and once boiled for a few mins, reduced heat to medium and slowly reduced it, as I was afraid it was going to burn. It did take more time this way, but it came out beautifully. Served w/ jasmine rice and stir-fry veggies. My husband said it is the best teriyaki chicken he has ever had..thanks!

Yum! This was fast and easy and got totally gobbled. I added toasted sesame seeds after pouring on more marinade (I doubled it as well). Awesome! I would definitely make this again and again.

My husband raved and I loved it. The best part is that we always have the ingredients on hand. It is a nice change from stir frys, but it still satisfies an asian food craving.

This recipe was very good. I used it on turkey breasts instead of chicken. It was a hit with my husband which is good since he doesn't eat poultry very often.

this recipe is a winner. i marinated the chicken and cooked it on the bbq. would definitely make it again - it was sweet and delicious.

This was yummy! I made it for guests who raved and begged for more. I put the chicken over coconut basmati rice (basmati made w/ coconut milk instead of water). Be sure to make extra sauce. It was delicious drizzled over the chicken and rice. I garnished the entire perimeter of the plate with toasted coconut.

Really nice blend of flavors. Using fresh ginger and mashing the garlic into a paste really is the way to go. I took the advice of other reviewers and increased the quantities - I x4 the recipe and got just enough for 4 half breasts with leftover for rice and dipping. My only complaint was that the marinade, even when reduced, did not thicken. That would be a nice touch cause it would cling to the meat better.

Very easy meal! I used ground ginger but will use fresh next time! A nice flavor.

This recipe was a huge hit. With our three children it is very rare to find a dish they all like. They absolutely loved it! For guests I tripled the chicken and used six times the ingredients for the sauce(a little less ginger) and still wished we had more. Start reducing the sauce before you put the chicken on. I didn't want to use the skin but I'm gald I did after reading the reviews. It definitely keeps it moist.

Really yummy! I even tried stir-frying in a wok and it worked well!

I made this a couple times. The skin is absolutely crucial for keeping the chicken moist. Use fresh garlic and ginger, of course, and feel free to cut back on the salt. Double the sauce and start the process of reducing it before you start broiling the chicken.

This is great! I would go so far as to triple or quadruple the sauce, particularly if you want to drizzle some over the rice.

This was delicious served as a rice bowl. I used a variety of veggies--green beans, sugar peas, broccoli, mushrooms, carrots--cut into small pieces and first filled the bowl with white rice, then put the pieces of chicken and vegetables on top, and poured on some of the teriyaki sauce. Ymmmy!

This recipe was really tasty and easy to make. I doubled the sauce as suggested, but I didn't quite double the ginger. I was glad that I didn't because there was enough of a ginger taste without doubling it. I would definately make it again.

Delicious and tender...i think the skin does help keep it tender while it cooks even if I wouldn't dare eat it! Make extra sauce and stirfry some veggies to serve with the chicken and some japanese rice.

This chicken teriyaki is indeed delicious. The only problem is that I found the chicken not to be so tender. Maybe I cooked it too long, or maybe it's because I took chicken without the skin? I still wood do this recipe again!

this dish was fabulous. We made it twice;once we used white wine instead of sherry, and we always add extra garlic. Quick to make, just make sure you reduce the sauce. It is definitely worthwhile.
