I am a huge fan of tiramisu. It is probably one of my favorite desserts. I made this & it came out excellent. A few people complained about having a hard time finding the lady fingers but I found them in the international isle at Stop & Shop. I got a huge bag of 4 individually sealed sleeves. We only used about 1 ½ sleeves to make this recipe and I definitely stuck a few extra in there. Haagen Dazs ice cream was on sale so I got 2 pints, one of vanilla and coffee and I think it made a huge difference in the taste of the dessert. I also just bought a small black coffee from Starbucks and had them add a shot of espresso. Everyone raved about it. And I cheated on the whipped cream & used Reddi Whip.

An easy, elegant delicious dessert. I used crushed almond cookies since I could not find the ladyfingers and loved the extra crunch the almonds gave the dessert. I will definitely make again!

My boyfriend is still raving about this a week later!! Its perfect for those of us who love the flavor of tiramisu but are too lazy to make the real thing! I actually think the presentation looks prettier too. It's also fun to assemble it in front of your diners because they see all the good stuff that goes in. I couldn't find the ladyfingers so i used the "chocolate chip dunkers" from trader joes and their chocolate/vanilla caramel swirl ice cream as well. I figured there'd be enough coffee flavor with the espresso so why compete with it by adding coffee ice cream? I think a cinnamon sprinkle on the whipped cream adds really good flavor too. mmmmm

Loved it as did everyone else. And it was very easy. I had to make substitutions: couldn't find ladyfingers anywhere, so I used a pound cake, sliced and baked until crisp; also it was 100 degrees with 95% humidity therefore no peaks for my heavy cream. If you live in the south I suggest buying your whipped cream! :-)

delicious! people loved it. however i would recommend shaving the chocolate over the sink cause the shavings went everywhere but in the cups

This is a go-to dessert for me. Easy to pick up few ingredients and have it ready quickly after dinner. I have always just used coffee but now that I have an espresso machine will try it with espresso. I prefer just the vanilla ice cream but have both on hand for guests. Delicious!

instead of espresso, i brew regular coffee in a french press and just let it steep for a little longer. have made this a few times now - love it!

So delicious!! I made this for my friends and they absolutely loved it. What's more, it's so simple to make and a great variation on the original dessert.

SO good. Had too much of this. I used some nice gelato that was on sale and decaf coffee so as not to be up all night. Yum!

We are fortunate enough to have a local gelato shop that makes these, they're out of this world good! It's cheaper to customize them @ home though, they're $6 a pop at the gelato place

this is sublime, you can not like it. This is a quick desert. I try also to put some orange liquor (curacao) on the top.
