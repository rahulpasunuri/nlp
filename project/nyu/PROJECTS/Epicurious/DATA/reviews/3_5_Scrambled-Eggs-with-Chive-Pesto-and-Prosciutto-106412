The "Green Eggs and Ham" reviews gave me a heads-up. Green eggs conjure up airline breakfasts, but the ingredients for this recipe sounded so good, I wanted to try it. I just put it all together a little differently. Made the pesto, sliced half an avocado onto one side of the plate, and spooned the pesto over the avocado and around the edges of the plate. I softly scrambled the eggs with the proscuitto and set them down amidst all that green. It was food magazine beautiful and delicious. The pesto made every bite perfection.

That "Green Eggs and Ham" review is the funniest thing I've seen in about 6 months. Thanks Virginia. The rating is for you!

Oh, Sam I Am, oh, Sam I Am, last night I served green eggs and ham. We did not like them, Sam I Am, we did not like green eggs and ham.

We had this for Sunday breakfast. I always like to make something a little special on Sundays. It really turned out beautiful, with the green flecks in the golden eggs and the contrast of the prosciutto. We've given it a new name, though, "Green Eggs and Ham". We'll certainly have it again. PS, I used only 2 whole eggs for the 2 of us and 4 egg whites, to cut down on the cholesterol a little.
