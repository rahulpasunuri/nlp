This was an easy quick meal on a Fall evening. I used fresh broccoli which I had on hand. Extra Sharp cheddar is a must!

I've made this many times and it's a great easy dinner for the family, although nothing special. This time I used fontina as well as cheddar and added some sliced shallots to the eggs and it was really great. The fonitna was really creamy and the shallots added the extra flavor it previously lacked.

I make this often for a quick dinner. Perfect for kids. It's a little bland for me, but I eat it with Tapatio and it's wonderful. It's become a staple in our house.

Agree with other reviews that it was bland. My oldest son is vegetarian so it was perfect for him and my youger son enjoyed as well. I ate it with hot sauce and that did the trick. Will make it again, just add something to spice it up.

Good quickie for the weekend. WAY too much cheese. Recommend a vintage white cheddar, but only 1/2 pound. Good balance of carbs (potato) and protein (the eggs). Not a tired-maker. Definitely will make again.

Deliscious. Made recipe as written but would be fabulous with bacon, ham, sausage or prusciutto added, or more veggies.

This to me is comfort food! I like the ideas to spice up with some hot sauce and maybe add bacon. I cook this longer than directed as I feel like it's too runny otherwise. I like my eggs well-cooked!

Delicious and easy. Demanded again and again by the significant other, which is always a good sign.

I think Paula Deen's version of this recipe is better. Baking the hash browns before adding the filling is a good idea. 3 cups, shredded frozen hash browns, thawed and drained 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) butter, melted 3 large eggs, beaten 1 cup half-and-half 3/4 cup diced cooked ham 1/2 cup diced green onions 1 cup shredded Cheddar Salt and freshly ground black pepper Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Gently press the drained hash browns between paper towels to dry them as best as possible. In a 9-inch pie plate, toss the hash browns with the melted butter into the plate. Press them into the bottom and up the sides to form a crust. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes until golden brown and starting to crisp. Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, combine the remaining ingredients. When the hash brown crust is ready pour the egg mixture over it and return to the oven. Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and bake for about 30 minutes until the quiche is light golden brown on top and puffed.

Delicious and easy to make. Great for breakfast, brunch or dinner. Also very flexible by adding other veggies, bacon or tabasco sauce, etc. Can be made ahead of time and reheated! My husband loved it so it's a keeper for us!

I add 1/2 lb of bacon to start this is a great Quick recipe. I have also used other veggies that also works.

I didn't have frozen hash browns so I thinly sliced small white potatoes with a mandolin (took about the same amount of time as thawing in microwave would) and used these instead. My husband loved it and suggested pairing it with a spicy Bloody Mary at our next brunch.

I was exhausted tonight, but this dish seemed easy enough to try. Yum! I'm glad I went for it. I really enjoyed this meal.

Pretty good, and easy to modify (add bacon, mushrooms, garlic, whatever). I heeded previous reviews and used only a 1/2 pound of potatoes. Quick and easy for a simple dinner. Might need more salt.

Simple and satisfying. I especially liked the flavor contributed from the shallots.

DELICIOUS!!! I've made this several times and everyone always raves about it! Even my kids love it! I prefer egg whites so I always substitute 12 egg whites plus 2 yolks for the 6 regular eggs. I also use a full teaspoon of salt when cooking the potatoes and a 1/2 tsp. in the egg mixture. Without the added salt, it's too bland.

somehow this was salty and bland at the same time.

I too cut down on the amount of potatoes, mainly because most 10" cast iron skillets are 10" across top and bottom and I was using a flared pan, 10" across top and maybe 7" across bottom. I think the quality of the cheese you are using makes a great difference. We found it a bit bland using a grocery store extra sharp, but if I'd used a good fromagerie cheddar , the results would have been a lot better. I even think the next time I do this, and I will, I might use a gruyere for more flavor.I might even go for all parmesan. I did use blanched fresh broccoli and maybe a bit more nutmeg and freeze dried shallots. But I really think the end result will depend on the cheese you ise. This one is going to be a keeper!

This was good, and pretty easy, but not fabulous. I think next time I'd brown the potatoes about 15 min. I agree with the reviewer about the hot sauce!

I know no two tastebuds are alike, but I'm not sure why other reviewers found this to be bland. It was terrific! Light, fluffy, and so easy to make. I did follow some advice and cut the potatoes down a considerable amount, just enough to cover the bottom of the pan and make a thin crust. I also added two each frozen cubes of basi and garlic (you can get these at Trader Joes - they are indespensible in the kitchen and truly add flavor to almost any dish). I also left out the nutmeg as I was in the mood for a complete savory experience. I did not have the Parmesan, so I substituted Pecorino-Romano. The result was a fantastic, hearty, and really fresh breakfast/brunch dish. Remember - when in doubt, season well!

I shredded two Yukon gold potatoes & also used fresh broccoli. I never use plain salt, but a seasoned salt called Hy's, which is Canadian, but resembles Lawry's. I made it for brunch for a young couple with two little kids and its was a big hit. I'll definitely make it again.

Bland with a capital B. The potatoes really drag it into the doldrums. And we thought a whole pound was way too much. If I were to make this again, I'd cut the potatoes to a 1/3 pound for a thinner, crispier crust. Either that or drop the potatoes all together and make a frittata.

Quick and easy. The whole family enjoyed it. I would cut back on the salt next time as the cheeses and hash browns were already quite salty.

I thought this was decent, but my husband really liked it. I made it according to recipe, but next time would throw in mushrooms. Bacon would be good (as previously said), but we don't eat it.

I made this for dinner but it would be great for brunch too. I only had about 10 oz of hash browns but I really thought that was enough. I added some crumbled bacon because I had it leftover from another dish. You could make a lot of variations to this - the hashbrown "crust" is a great idea!
