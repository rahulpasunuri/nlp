I also added anchovy paste and olives, plus 1/3 cup capers, a teaspoon of crushed red pepper, one chopped yellow onion and a package of sliced mushrooms. This made it a fuller meal and made the pasta optional. It tasted great and looked beautiful on the platter.

I loved the combination of fennel and oregano, and the red wine and balsamic vinegar were very nice. I added black olives and, more importantly, about 1 teaspoon of anchovy paste when I sauteed the spices. It was really tasty! Easy "go to" recipe. Tastes very authentic.

I added mushrooms, onions, and basil--thought it needed a bit more substance. Had half a jalepeno, so used that for a little heat. When the chicken was just done, I pulled it out, removed skin and bones, and cut into bite size pieces. Made it a fork only meal. Did half the recipe and six ounces of pasta--and got three generous servings. Topped with some grated parmsesan, and it was very tasty--not spectacular, but good comfort food.

Even tho I modified this recipe, I think it had some very nice features to use as a base. First, I substituted a green pepper (my own personal taste), I added a large chopped onion (I use any opportunity I can find to increase vegetables) and sliced olives (per others' suggestion). I used skinless chicken breast, tenders, and thighs (any combination, because I just don't eat chicken skin - cholesterol is a problem). I thought the fennel seeds, dried crushed red pepper, and balsamic vinegar were very tasty and I would definitely include these in any chicken cacciatore recipe now.

Really tasty. My lips are still burning. I substituted one large red diced jalapeño for the crushed red pepper. I also found that the dish required about 1/2 tsp. of salt to bring out flavors. Otherwise, I used chicken leg & thigh quarters instead of breasts and noticed that it took about 5 minutes longer to cook the chicken through. The fennel seed and balsamic vinegar really make this a memorable dish.

This recipe was used as a base for me, I used anise seed instead of the fennel seeds (I didn't have fennel), I used 4 scant teaspoons of garlic powder instead of the fresh garlic, and a whole chicken cut up instead of the breast halves. Everything else was the same and I got great reviews from some picky people. We also ate ours with pasta noodles (shaped like egg noodles) instead of spaghetti, but I'm sure it tasted the same.

This is a very good recipe when you follow it as written. I have to agree with earlier comments. When you start radically changing ingredients, you are creating a radically different dish. I too used fresh oregano and added olives and I let it simmer for an hour. I'll make it again.

This is pretty good. It's spicy with three dried chilis. I added mushrooms and olives which I think gave it some depth. Also fresh tomatos instead of canned. I simmered it for probably an hour - chicken thighs were nice and tender. Fits the bill when you want chicken cacciatore.

The only changes I made were using fresh oregano and adding two bay leaves. The meat was delicious and the sauce was flavorful. Next time I am going to serve it with creamy polenta instead of noodles.

Everyone at my house enjoyed this. I added olives as suggested by another reviewer and it added a nice flavor. It was easy and quick to make at the end of the day.

Me again... Does anyone out there - who chose to make such outrageous changes to this recipe - actually know what "cacciatore" translates to? In Italian (duh...) - it means "hunter style". Out in the field with local ingredients, etc.? Not a supermarket for miles...

This recipe is great AS IS! I've made it at least once a month since 1999. Red wine vinegar? Easier to eat? (Don't you have knives and forks?) Breaded skinless, boneless breasts? White wine? Tomato sauce instead of paste? If you favor any of these "enhancements" - EAT AT OLIVE GARDEN!

I thought it was OK - my boyfriend loved it. The only real change I made was to add a touch of sugar and tomato sauce instead of tomato paste. Next time I'll make it with the tomato paste to get a richer, thicker sauce. I had to cook the sauce down for quite a while to get it thick enough to serve. (I threw in sprigs of thyme and some chopped fresh rosemary just because some on hand - but I don't think it changed the flavour significantly). I used thighs and breasts and the thighs were incredibly moist and flavourful in comparison to the boring breasts. Also, next time I will crush the fennel before adding to see if that will help give it more flavour.

Rating: 3
The answer to why leave the chicken on the bones is that the meat remains more moist and tender with more flavor, if cooked slowly over time the meat will fall off the bones anyway. I personally like some dark meat for flavor along with the breasts and with children involved I always use legs for ease of eating :)

This was the first cacciatore I've ever made. It was delicious! The only change I made was to add olives and simmer for about an hour. Instead of spaghetti, I served the cacciatore on top of creamy polenta. (Recipe also on this website) Excellent!

Rating: 3
Quite good, basic, and accessible. Agree with someone else who questioned why bother to leave the breasts on the bone--makes more of a pain to eat that way. If you've simmered enough, the meat should just fall off the bone before serving on top of the pasta (if you're doing it that way) anyways.

Very good, quite easy. I took the recommendations below and simmered for 1.5hrs. Used breasts, still very tender and flavorful. The only thing I changed was to use fresh oregano from the garden. Yum!

Quick, easy and delicious. I have made this one twice in less than a week. I used thighs for the moisture and ground fennel to inhance the flavor. This is a keeper for sure.

My roommate really enjoyed this, but to me it was just okay, nothing special. I added onions to the recipe and used red cooking wine.

I've made this several times now and it's a family favorite. I used a bit more olive oil than called for and first sauted 3/4 cup chopped onion, then added the chicken breasts. I also added some green pepper and reduced the crushed red pepper to 1/4 tsp. and it was quite spicy. I added tomoto sauce instead of paste and served it over white rice instead of spaghetti. Easy to do ahead of time so you're not fussing in the kitchen.

Recipes to me are just a guideline. This recipe is a very good one. I didn't use the fennel, too licorice-anise-like for us. We used skinless, boneless breasts. I like to brown the chicken in one pan, start sauteing the vegies in another pan and add the chicken to the vegies and add everthing else. (A nicer presentation)

Rating: 3
With some changes, this is a recipe we enjoy. I used white wine instead of red, nixed the paste, and added celery for color and flavor. Also, I slow simmered the dish for a total of 90 minutes. Adds a nice depth to the dish, and the meat really falls off the bone, making it easy to eat!

I used both red and yellow bell peppers to add a little more sweet flavor as well as color, it was great!

turned out well tonight, though I used rosemary instead of fennel, didn't measure a dang thing, and ended up sauteeing and cooking the chicken a bit longer than recommended. But the key is: add black olives while it's simmering. Real cacciatore must have the olives -- and as I'm living in Italy and just checked with everyone around me, they agree. Black olives. Killer addition. And no spaghetti underneath.

Rating: 3
I added a bit of rosemary to the sauce. If I make it again, I'm going to use breaded chicken cutlets rather than bone-in chicken, because that would make it easier to eat. Other than that, this recipe was a big hit with my family.

I found that is recipe was over proportion, but it gave me some good ideas on where it needs to be changed. It should be Red Wine Vinegar instead of balsamic (the sauce ended up getting to sweet). Still it gave me some ideas.

My kids love this recipe; however, I use tomatoes with balsamic vinegar and spices (Hunt's) because the 1 T. of vinegar is just not enough flavor. I also use a tomato paste that has Italian seasonings in it. With a little added "umph" this can be a tasty recipe always.

Definitely not the flavor of what I expect in Cacciatore, but a keeper for a good,simple and hearty chicken dish. We liked the fennel but thought the intensity was a bit high so will reduce in the future and added a little salt after tasting and simmering for a while. Didn't have a red bell pepper and in the future I would add some onion along with mushrooms and maybe olives as a better fit for a veggie addition. Chicken breasts cooked in tomato,wine and vinegar can get a bit dry so substitued a whole chicken cut into 8 or so pieces and a package of legs (all with skin removed)- meat cooked on the bone has so much more flavor.(Doubled the rest of the ingredients because I could tell it would make great leftovers) Served it with lightly buttered orzo,the rest of the bottle of red wine and a great cauliflower dish for a great Sunday night winter meal

Wasn't quite what I expected when I think of typical chicken cacciatore flavouring. It was a bit spicy though.

A tasty and quick dinner. I used regular chicken thighs and skinned them myself. Followed the recipe pretty much as is, but decided to deglaze the pan (after browning the chicken and sauteeing the veggies) with the wine. Served with pepper fettucine for an extra bit of *kick*!!

This was pretty easy to make, but I would probably use boneless chicken breasts and cut them into cubes next time. Also I didn't add enough salt. Maybe a little sugar would help too. I will definetly make it again though.

Far too boring. Skip the vinegar and tomato paste and use real stewed tomatoes, oregano, crushed peppers, red and green peppers, some mushrooms and alot more wine. The recipe "as is" is relatively tasteless - somewhat "McItalian?".

Rating: 3
Well, I decided to use this recipe as a base. I substituted skinless chicken thighs (the meat is naturally sweet and balances out the acid of the tomatoes), and spicy Italian sausage for the meat portion of the dish. I also increased the red wine and used it to deglaze the pan after the veggies; then, I added the tomatoes and the paste. Finally added sliced mushrooms. I also added ground red pepper along with the pepper flakes. I do not know if this is a traditional cacciatore, but it is pretty darn good. I hope there are some leftovers.

Rating: 4
Absolutely loved this. I let the chicken simmer uncovered for a bit to reduce the sauce, and used boneless skinless breast halves instead. Also, I used cayan pepper (the powdered variety) instead of red pepper to give it a bit more kick. Next time I might add sliced black olives to the sauce, I have a feeling they'd go well with the oregano and red wine.

Very Good! I skinned chicken breasts and coated them lightly in flour and S&P before browning them. Added an onion and some chicken stock I had laying around and used a little less tomato paste as that's all I had. Cooked longer - 'til the chicken was real tender. Served with rice.

This dish was wonderful! Perfect to have on a cold day. I substituted ground red pepper for the ground red pepper flakes because I don't like finding flakes of pepper in the sauce. I also let the chicken stew in the sauce for about 20 minutes. The meat practically fell off the bone. The only thing this dish really needs is something to thicken up the sauce a bit, maybe a little more tomato paste.

I have tried this recipe twice, my husband and I loved it both times. I will change it a little next time by putting smaller pieces of chicken without the skin and add more spices. Very easy and quick to make.

I bought a lot of chicken and thought I'd try this recipe to add a little bit of variety to my menu and it was great. I was able to get a whole meal together in 45 minutes and the chicken was tender and a little spicey too! Give it a try

I took the suggestion of using capers instead of Fennel, and highly reccommend it. I also added a medium sweet onion and a tsp of basil. Doubled the recipe, and made it for 3 hungry men and myself. One was quoted as saying,"This is awesome, I can't stop" while on the way to the kitchen for thirds! There was enough for left overs that were equally as good. I am giving this recipe to all my friends.

I plan to make this dish soon, but to comment on the tomato paste issue: I recently experimented with a substitution, and the results were better than if I had used tomato paste. I tossed out a 3-year-old bit of paste in my freezer (ugh!) and pureed some rehydrated sundried tomatoes as a substitute. It was for a cream sauce, and the bits of tomato, plus the mellow flavor, were a perfect combination.

I loved this receipe, but I used skinless chicken breasts, capers instead of fennel seeds, left out the tomato paste, added chopped garlic, onions, and garnished with fresh chopped Italian parsley. I also had the time to let it cook until the chicken became very tender. My husband loved it!

The fennel was a really interesting addition -- I was skeptical but it made the dish much more interesting. Cooking time wasn't quite long enough -- one of the larger breasts was still pink inside (ugh). This one's a keeper.

It's a good introductory recipe that was fun to add ingrediants to. I added mushrooms, red and green peppers,capers,cayenne pepper and onions. I cut out the fennel and tomato paste. I also used penne instead of spaghetti. My husband told me that my version would make his Italian grandmother proud.

Good enough flavour. I diced some chicken breast and just tossed that in. A bit sour, the reviewer who left the tomato paste out had the right idea. The fennel seed was interesting but a bit strange for me. Next time I will leave it out. Certainly quick, you can't beat that.

This is an absolutely marvelous dish. We cook a lot and were both really excited about how it tasted, and even looked. I seared bite sized pieces of chicken, and also added prawns that marinated in garlic. Did not use the tomato paste, but it was phenomenal.
