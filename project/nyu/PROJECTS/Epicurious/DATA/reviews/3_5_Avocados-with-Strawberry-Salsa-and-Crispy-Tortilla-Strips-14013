Great combination of flavor and textures. Used a combination of dried Cilantro and dried Corriander rather than fresh. Used about 1/4 tsp of the Corriander and 1/2 tsp of the Cilantro. Received a lot of complements and requests for this recipe. Served as a combined dish and included the avocado cut into bite sixed pieces with the strawberry salsa. Used tortilla chips for dipping and scooping. Excellent appetizer and plan on serving again to a different group in the next week.

A wonderful spring twist to a traditional dish. Very fast and easy to make. The tortillas are a wonderful pairing, though normal tortilla chips work, as well.

Yum! I made a sweeter version with 1 t salt and omitted the onions. Will make again both ways.

I received many compliments on this. I only made the salsa though. I chopped up one of the avocados and added it to the salsa. By adding the sugar the strawberries become very juicy, I had a bit of trouble with the juice overflowing, I had not placed the salsa in a big enough bowl so when I woke up the next morning there was a puddle of juice around the bowl. Overall very yummy.

I doubled the recipe but didn't use any sugar. The strawberry salsa was drier than the tomato version so I decided to dice the avocado and mix it into the strawberry mixture for a guacamole effect. Served with blue corn chips. It was very good, everyone complimented it.

I usually double this recipe for parties (and use three chilis, instead of two). I also let it sit in the fridge overnight to better combine the flavors (minus the avocados). Store- bought blue corn chips look great next to the salsa. And, like other reviewers, I cube the avocado right before serving and place in the center of the salsa dish. It's always a huge hit!

Not really a review, just a note...coriander and cilantro are one in the same.

This recipe is great but I think the ingredients on epicurious.com aren't quite right - you call for coriander. Did you mean cilantro? The Gourmet cookbook also has this exact recipe but calls for cilantro instead. We made it with cilantro and served it over a salmon filet marinated in an orange/soy sauce. Got rave reviews from even the pickiest guests. And, we used farmers' market strawberries even though Gourmet cookbook says not to. It was totally divine.

did this dish for valentines, put a new spin on it by ommitting the tortilla's. serving 2 quarters of avocado on a bed of lettuce with the salsa drizzled all over with baked mango and vanilla pod. used as a starter, it did the job :O)

I first had this recipe at a picnic. The person bringing it had omitted the sugar and cubed the avocados. I made this recipe and preferred the salsa sans sugar, added more red onion, lime and cilantro- my friends like spicy so I add jalapeno or serrano to suit my crowd. Overall- delicious and an unusal bring along to parties- always a hit!

Really unique and refreshing, I started making it 3 summers ago, and it is now a summer standard. If you like this try the Strawberry with Balsamic and black peppercorns from the same issue

Like the other reviewers, I bought store chips, however, I bought blue corn chips and combine them with white corn chips for a (somewhat) 'patriotic' theme. I also made the avocado strips quite thin and halved them. Then, my friends could use a chip to scoop up some avocado and salsa on each chip. There were other appetizers at the party I attended and brought this dish--I was the only one bringing home an empty plate!

I have made this recipe twice, combining all the ingredients and this salsa is a crowd pleaser. It is not only beautiful, but delicious and unique. Make this recipe as much as you can when strawberries are in season - it is a hit!

Yum! I did include the 1/2t sugar and thought it was just fine. Next time, I would increase the lime juice for more bite. I also tried mixing in avocado cubes, but the red and green all mixed together does look a little off-putting. Next time, I will sprinkled all the avocado cubes in the middle or around the edge of the bowl of strawberry salsa. (And of course, I used store-bought tortilla chips!)

What a great recipe! My friends and I loved the contrast between the sweet salsa and the salty chips. To make preparation easier/quicker, I've used purchased chips. To eliminate the need for plates, I've cut the avocados into small cubes mixed it right in with the salsa. Its a great twist on the old "chips and salsa" stand-by. Terrific for summer.

Although this got gobbled up at a party, I thought the salsa seemed a little too sweet. Next time I'll follow the previous reviewer, and skip the sugar.

EXCELLENT.... light, just right amount of spice and superb flavor (I made it without the optional sugar). Served it without chips as a side dish with glazed grilled salmon and rice - it was the perfect summer meal.
