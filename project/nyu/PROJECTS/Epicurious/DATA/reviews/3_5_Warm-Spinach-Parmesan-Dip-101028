Made this for Thanksgiving and was a HUGE hit. Per others suggestions also added artichokes. Should have made more as it was gone in a flash.

With some minor tweaking this is totally fantastic. I was never a big fan of these dips but am looking foward to making it again. I reduced the onion to 1 cup, reduced the garlic slightly and increased the parmesan cheese by 1/4 cup. I used chopped frozen spinach, 1 bag in place of the fresh spinach but be sure to squeeze it to remove the water before adding it. Then I add 2 jars or marinated artichoke hearts drained and chopped. That made all the difference.

Very, very tasty. The cayenne pepper gave it a surprising kick. It was definitely a hit at our party.

I really like this recipe. I read the reviews and made minor changes as well. Used dried minced onion and cut the garlic in half. I also cut the spinach down to a 6 oz bag and added more cheese. We thought it was better the next day. So getting ready to make it again but will put in the fridge a day before serving. Used with tortilla chips. I recommend!

Tasty dip and relatively easy to make (you just need a bit of time to do the sauting). I used whole milk in stead of the whipping cream (since I didn't have any) and it worked out fine and dandy.

I wouldn't say this is the best cheesy spinach dip recipe I've ever had. The proportions are really off, too much spinach and garlic for the cheese. It had an intense flavor and almost bitterness, that you wouldn't expect from a parm-spinach dip. This recipe seems to be a good start but needs major tweeking to become really delicious!

I just made this for a party- incredible. I followed the recipe exactly and doubled it. Next time I may add some bacon- as what's not to love about adding bacon.

Rating: 3
Very good as is, but I modified it as follows: - A little more Parmesan. - 1/3 t cayenne instead of 1/2 t. - Add 1 T lemon juice and 1 t Dijon mustard. - The onions need time to completely meld into the dip. I suggest preparing the day before, refrigerating overnite, then reheating. I liked it much more on the second day.

this has become my go-to-dish for appetizers. its super easy to make in about 20min or less- halved the amount of garlic, use fresh spinach and opted not to add the cayenne pepper. i bake it with a little more parm cheese ontop till its bubbling. and i serve it with homemade wheat pita chips. its always a hit!

Year after year, this is a much requested recipe from my kids. I use two pkgs of frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry. We love the garlicy oniony taste, so I never change the amounts. I will alter the cayenne amount depending on my guests. It travels well and reheats excellently in the microwave.

Great dip - easy to make but I suggest chopping the spinach into smaller peices. I followed the other reviewers suggestions and decreased the amount of onion and it came out GREAT. I got lot of compliments from a tough crowd!

Rating: 3
This dip is wonderful and has become a family favorite. I've rated it with only 3 forks thought because it has taken some alteration for it to be excellent. First I've cut the amount of onion in 1/2. It was just too much. Second I found that giving the spinach a good chop allows the dip to be creamier and easier to eat. Other than that it's fantastic!

Rating: 4
This is a great staple appetizer, all of my guests enjoyed it, as did I. As other reviewers did, I used frozen spinach, although I did not quite use 2 full packages, more like 1.5 since it seemed like a lot of spinach. I might use a smidge less cayenne next time, it definitely gave it some kick but not overpowering. Otherwise the recipe is great as is. I might try some diced tomatoes sprinkled on top next time as well. I put the dip on a platter with tortilla chips, pita chips, celery and carrots.

You simply can't fail with this one. Tastes just like the kind you get at a restaurant...but fresher. I minced some water chestnuts into mine to add a little crunch to it...awesome for sure!

Spinach and Parmesan Dip Adding Parmesan Cheese or any other cheese to spinach, rhubarb, lambs quarters or similar vegetables is good healthy choice. The reason is that the calcium in the cheese combines with Oxalic acid in these vegetables passes through the bowel rather than absorbing this in the blood, thus reducing the chance of kidney stones.

I've been making this for years and only the very first time did I use FRESH spinach. I always sub TWO packages of CHOPPED frozen spinach, thawed and water drained. Also, using jarred, pre-chopped garlic makes this bitter and strong. Garlic is much milder when minced fresh for the recipe. I've served it with crackers, melba toast and for this past Thanksgiving - sliced Jicama for a friend on the Atkins diet! She loved it! I get raves whenever I make it and/or take it to a party.

although this is more involved than others that are rated higher (can't figure that out), this is by far the best i have ever tasted. i have also modified this recipe by adding less liquids, and have used it as a side dish of creamed spinach. easier is not always better.

Family ate so much of this that they weren't hungry for dinner. No leftovers, everyone loved it. I cut the garlic back to 3 cloves and sauted the onions and garlic longer to make them very soft and mild.

My husband really liked this - he was impressed that I had made an appetizer to start dinner on a weekday, and said it was better than at a restaurant. I cut the onion down to 1 cup and happy with that quantity. I cooked the onion and garlic for about 10 minutes over a slower heat which gave it a nice sweetness. All the rest was directly according to the recipe, except that I added about a 1/2 cup of grated mozzarella just to put it over the top. We liked the kick from the cayenne, but it could be cut down if you prefer a little less kick. Great recipe.

Rating: 2
Not so good. I forgot to add the olive oil but i don't think that that would have made it any better. It was too oniony. Also i added about 2 table spoons of chili sauce to give it some kick and that helped a bit. The drive over to the party helped the flavors mesh a little better but i think i was expecting this to be as good as the costco (artichoke/spinach dip) i think i'll stick to the knorrs

I made this dip for a dinner party at my sisters. She was not too thrilled when I said I was making spinach dip, she saw a packet of Knors in her future. When I brought it in and everyone tasted it they went wild. It is so creamy and rich. I did add a little more cheese and broiled the top. I have since learned to chop the fresh spinach pretty well because it can be too stringy for dipping. Great recipe

Awesone dip, made for fathers day. Cooked the onions and garlic over low flame for 10-15 minutes, chopped the spinach and added chopped artichokes. Made in the morning and stored in fridge. Put dip in a big shallow dish and heated up at dinner time for about 20 minutes. Came out great. Definately a make ahead app.

Being a chef in the top gourmet city in the US, and possibly the world, Miami, this recipe shows promise, but lacks any real sense of proportion or definitive culinary logic. Insted of run of the mill 'spinach', I used only hand washed baby spinache from the local fresh market. I added twice the amount of salt, and a dash of very rare, VERY gourmet tomato paste (Trader Jack's house brand). This did not work well but was a substantial improvement to the recipe which would have only warranted 1 fork otherwise. I will not make again. Harry

My friend made this for a cocktail party I hosted and it was delicious. Really easy to make and very flavorful. She used about 3/4 spinach of what the recipe called for because it started to get to thick. If I made it again, I think I'd add a little more cayenne and perhaps use baby spinach.

I made this for a holiday party I attended. The only thing I changed was to chop the spinach. I cut the top off a loaf of sourdough bread and poured the finished dip in the center. The dish was put on a table with other appetizers at the party but was in such demand that we moved it to the coffee table in the room where people were sitting. By the end people were tearing off pieces of the bread to get the last few bites of the dip! I think I'll make this again...

I thought this was good, and I will make it again, but I disagree with the person who liked the big leaves of spinach. I will certainly chop the spinach next time - it's not aesthetic... it's just that you can't bite a cracker or toast with cooked spinach - you end up pulling the whole leaf into your mouth, and that wasn't desireable as a dip - maybe if it was eaten with a fork. Chopped fresh spinach, and otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.

This was very good, I used green onion and I added crab claw meat and sauteed it with the garlic and onion ... Many calories, but well worth it... after all, it is not a dish one makes everyday..

This is a wonderful dish, easy to make and I'm sure holds up well to individual variations. We added about 12oz of fresh crab meat; used 1 1/2 cups of shallots instead of the 1 3/4 cups of onions recommended; a bit more butter, olive oil, chicken stock, cream and parmesan cheese since we added all that crab meat. We also like things spicy so we put in a bit more cayenne pepper. Outstanding !! This is definitely something we'll make again and again.

I gave this two forks b/c I had to modify it alot, but it was GREAT once I changed it around.

I also added a little more cayenne, since I like spicy stuff.

I made this dip for the first time when it first appeared in the magazine. It's been my stand by appetizer ever since, and ALWAYS is a HIT!!!

I liked this, however my husband said it tasted sweet and I agreed. I followed the recipe exactly, except used frozen (thawed before using) spinach and squeezed all the water out. Perhaps the sweetness is from the cream. I can't figure out whatt else would make it sweet,(maybe the onions) so next time I will omit it and use only broth, and add chopped artichoke hearts as this is the way I get it in the restaurants

This spinach dip was delicious and fairly easy to make. It is very garlicky, but in my opinion that's not a bad thing. I did put it back over a light heat while adding the spinach to encourage wilting and keep the mixture from getting solid. I would recommend letting it sit at least 15 minutes and stir again before serving. The spinach lets out moisture as it wilts and (positively) changes the consistency of the dip.

I didn't make this dip but if anyone is looking for another simple spinach dip recipe, I have one that is fool proof and delicious. Combine 1 cup mayo, 1/2 cup parmesan or romano, 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella, 1/2 cup choppped roasted red peppers, and 1 box thawed frozen spinach that has been squeezed until it is dry. Bake in a 350 degree oven until hot. Serve with tortilla chips, baguette slices or crackers.

I've made this twice...the first time it came out great and I won a prize at a party for best appetizer! Made it again last night and forgot to add the flour at the appropriate step - tried to make a slurry to remedy but it came out like soup. I was having an 'off' night in the kitchen. Thankfully my guests were sweet (or more likely hungry) and ate it all anyway. Anyway, I will try again - make sure you chop the spinach if using whole leaves as that was another mistake I made in my second attempt.

This dip was great!! Made a mistake making it though, I forgot the flour step so I used cornstarch for thickener, Worked out fine. I chopped the fresh spinach (used the whole bag) and added a can of artichokes that I chopped. This was so good I could have eaten the whole thing! Can't wait to make this for friends!!

This is very good. Houston's resturaunt serves a spinach/artichoke dip that tastes very similar. So, I too have added some hearts to this recipe. I also agree that the mixture should spend some time in the oven. If you're not a big bread fan (like me), you can serve this with tortilla chips.

This is very good, but for cooks, please make sure you def chop the fresh spinach. Also, it did not take the entire bag. Around 3/4 if that. Otherwise your dip would be all spinach. Also, I too added chopped artichokes about 1/2 jar. I increased the cayenne pepper, added more sour cream and reduced the whipping cream. For the special touch, once warmed, I folded in fresh crab and then baked into 2 pans in the oven and toasted the tops, one with cheese and one with breadcrumbs. It was fantastic! I served it warm with toasted baguette slices brushed with olive oil and parmesan cheese sprinkle on them. It was a total hit!

I was very impressed (especially since I LOVE garlic). I chopped the spinach as others had recommended. I didn't really measure the spinach, just added it slowly until it "looked right". Then I added a tad bit more veggie stock (instead of chicken) and quite a bit more sour cream. My husband refuses to put it down!

We made this on Saturday night and it was so great we made it again last night for another event. Keep the garlic and the cayene. The cayene gives is a great kick. We used 1/2 can artichoke hearts and chopped the spinach. We warmed it before serving, but didn't really bake it. Not runny at all. Key is to add the stock (we used veg) and cream very slowly over a medium heat.

My boyfirend and I followed some advice above. Definitely add the artichokes/cut back the spinach, cut the garlic down to 5 instead of six, and last but not least cut back on the cayenne slightly. The cayenne gives it great flavor at the finish, but if you use the amount required your mouth starts to burn just a little.

I agree with the first reviewer, you definitely need to bake the dip before serving. I have made this at least 5 times for guests and it is always a hit. I add a can of finely chopped artichoke hearts, and less spinach (also finely chopped) which seems to work well. Then I serve it with Melba rounds.

Excellent every time. I relied on the input from previous "reviewers" on this page and it worked out very well: reduced the amount of spinach (to approx. 6 oz.) and chopped it; added (chopped) artichoke hearts; slightly reduced the amt. of heavy cream/slightly increased the sour cream so consistency was not too liquid; put it in the oven after completion so it was hot/bubbly (topping with cheese doesn't hurt either!). Substituted chicken broth with vegetarian. Served with warm pita triangles(brushed w/oil, garlic, salt). The recipe is certainly flexible enough for individual interpretation. Don't be afraid of the garlic either! Spinach- and artichoke-phobes have enjoyed this dip as well.

Rating: 2
I scaled back a little on the garlic, but that was still what this dip mainly tasted of. The parmesan flavor was completely lost, (I used just grated reggiano) though I hoped using best-quality cheese would emphasize its presence. There is also no way to serve this dip as written-- you MUST either chop the spinach very finely, or give it a whirl in the processor, as the spinach does not wilt into the liquids nearly enough to be "dip like". I brought this to a party, and got two requests for the recipe, but, for the most part, this dip was left pretty much alone. Served with tortilla chips.

This dip was a big hit this New Year's eve, but I would change the recipe a little to make it easier. I would definitely chop the spinach before adding it to the pot. The whole leaves did not wilth easily and I needed to cover the pot I cooked it in and use low heat. Otherwise, it was delicious

I really enjoyed this one, especially since it didn't use Campbell's Cream of whatever. I recommend chopping the spinach coarsely though and reducing the amount of cayenne pepper. Also, it's good piping hot so don't be afraid to stick it in the oven for 20 mins to bake.

I made this one day before serving, and spooned it into purchased phyllo tartlet shells, then baked it in the shells for 8-10 minutes at 350 as as an alternative to phyllo triangles. Everyone enjoyed it and the full recipe fills approximately 50 small shells. It was faster than making the triangles but a little more costly since the shells are 15 to a package and a package here is about $1.80; but it was much quicker (it takes me just short of an hour to make 60 triangles). I'd suggest a few drops of Frank's hot sauce if you don't have cayenne handy, but you definitely need the "oomph" the cayenne or hot sauce provides. I'll definitely make this again.

This was a delicious appetizer! My friends raved about the dip and they said it was better than our favorite spinach and artichoke dip at a local restaurant (I added a can of artichokes cut into fourths). They would have been happy just eating the dip for a meal! I made it ahead, let it cool and then heated it up on the stove when my guests came. Pretty garlicky, it was altogether delicious!

I have been making this dip for over a year to rave reviews and frequent requests. I do a few things differently as well - I use one box of frozen spinach (drain well) and usually add a can of artichoke hearts (chopped) and occasionally a few chopped sun-dried tomatoes or roasted red peppers (for color, especially at the holidays). I frequently make a double recipe and freeze half. Although it's not quite as good when you reheat it (slowly on the stove adding a bit more stock), it is still pretty darn good and saves time in a party cooking whirl-wind! Serve with baguette, pita, triscuits, or even carrots!

an excellent and easy recipe. after making this several times, here are a few suggestions... for ease of preparation, frozen chopped spinach can be substituted. just make sure to squeeze out the excess water before adding it to the pot. also, quality of cheese can make a huge difference! stick with the good cheese - you might pay more for it, but it will be worth the cost.

Oh so easy and truly delicious! Very decadent. Received raves from all!

This is an excellent dip for entertaining. It keeps the natives busy while the main course is being prepared. The only danger is people eat so much of the dip they may no longer be hungry for dinner!

I received rave reviews for this recipe. I am going to try artichokes next time as the spinach was a tad strong!

This was really great and very much like restaurant dips I have had before. Very simple to make, but I did change a few things. Used margarine instead of butter, skim milk instead of whipping cream and doubled the chicken stock. Also added jack cheese on top and browned in the oven. Very tasty!

The dip was great, although I thought it was a little bland at first. I just added more cayenne pepper until it was to my liking. This really brought out all the flavors in the dip. P.S. ignore the 6 "large" garlic cloves. I thought mine were small, so I used 8 small cloves. I love garlic, but I think it was a bit too much. Just use 6 cloves (unless you have elepahnt garlic - then I'd use 4)

I forgot to rate this recipe! I made some time ago... maybe last winter - delicious!! My guests loved it, too! Will definitely make again.

I made this for my housewarming party - at first I thought it was a bit bland but refrigerating it brought out a lot of flavours. I stuck to the recipe (although I did blanch and chop the spinach). Although it made a lot, I didn't have enough! I served it in two batches and it was all gone before half the guests arrived! Much better cold I think. Served it in a bread bowl which the English think is quite novel.

Yuck. I was actually felt foolish when serving this to some eager guests. Will not make again .. BUT I am looking for a dip like the "Milestones" spinich&artichoke dip. Maybe it's just a Candian restaurant? Let me know!!

Used half & half instead of whipping cream and used light sour cream. Thinned the dip with extra chicken stock, as mine turned out quite thick. Would go a little lighter on the flour next time. Would definately recommend chopping the spinach leaves-I left mine whole & it was not conducive to dipping! Everyone did enjoy the dip though!

This was a great appetizer! I cut the recipe in half for the six of us and it was plenty. I did chop the spinach leaves before adding them to the mixture. Perfect!

Yummm! I love Spinache dip and this one turned out great. I took other reader's advice and added marinated artichoke hearts, twice as much garlic and sprinkled a nice layer of parmesan cheese over the top of it in its serving bowl then plopped it into the oven to toast the top of it. My guests ate it up and my brother even asked for more which means alot! I am going to make it for a BBQ that is coming up!

Awesome! I used 6oz (rather than 10oz) spinach and added a can of artichoke hearts. I put both in my processor to chop. Served it in a bread bowl - a great way to bring it to a party. A keeper!!

Very tasty recipe. Agree with other reviewers that whole leaf spinach (even after wilting) does not lend itself well to dipping, so gave the final product a few turns through a food processor. Everyone loved it.

This dip was as good as you would find in the restaurants famous for it. I added a can of cut up artichoke hearts and used frozen spinach...both worked very well. I didn't think it was too thick..it made it easier to dip. I used tortilla chips. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.

This was a great dip, although I did make a few changes. I used frozen, chopped spinach and only added about 5 oz. of it. I also added about 1/2 a can of artichoke hearts, chopped. I found that the dip was very thick, so I continued to add broth, cream (actually fat free 1/2 & 1/2), and sour cream until I got the desired consistency. I also allowed the dip to cook on very low heat for awhile to soften/cook the spinach. I can't imagine what this would be like with whole wilted spinach leaves, but with the chopped spinach it was great. I used a vegetarian "no-chicken" broth and light sour cream and it was still very rich and creamy. Since I brought it to a party, I put it in a casserole dish and threw it in the oven when we arrived - it gave the top a nice golden, bubbly appearance.

I made this for a small dinner party. When I ran out of toasted baquette slices, my guests proceeded to eat the balance of the dip with spoons! Definately, a big hit. Also, I made the sauce portion of the recipe hours in advance and then rewarmed it and added the balance of the ingredients just before serving it.

Have made this recipe a few times and a huge success every time. If you double or triple the recipe adjust cayenne as it can get quite spicy if you just double or triple the cayenne quantity. Also, I didn't use the 10oz packaged spinach, I used regular bunches of spinach and picked off the leaves then cut into one inch wide strips. Also, if you want it dip consistency you have to add more chicken broth or it's waaaay too thick but if I plan to put into a crock pot I try not barely heat the spinach because it will continue to cook in the crock pot. Also use tortilla chips to dip with instead of bread. Everyone loves the very garlicky taste and have one had one person ever comment that it was too garlicky but that was because they were concerned about smelling like garlic all day. A really big hit and people always ask for the recipe.

I followed many of the suggestions from other reviewers yet the recipe still turned out too pungent. It think it is the combination of the garlic and the cayenne. I too had to puree half of the mixture and then mix it up with the other half because it would have been too chunky (this was after chopping the spinach quite fine). However, guests still finished it all and quickly too. (Froze extra for a future dinner party.)

We are very big garlic fans and yet we found this dish to be too garlicy (and we never thought we could find a dish to be too garlicy!). Also, the dip is too chunky. We needed to puree the dip a bit as well as add extra cheese, broth and cream.

I've made this several times and each was a success. I've noticed a few things- for the health -concious, this recipe works fine with low-fat milk for cream and reduced amounts of butter and oil. Also, my guests have generally preferred it with artichokes added.

Everytime I make this I get rave reviews! I chopped the fresh spinach, and didn't use all 10 oz. which I would recommend. Also great on homemade seasoned pita crisps. For the others that think this is too bland, add more cayenne!

This was a big hit- served it before Easter Dinner. Since there wer so many high fat ingredients, I did modify it by using fat-free chicken broth, and low-fat sour cream. Didn't seem to matter, it was delicious, thanks!

I have to agree with those who said it was bland. Had a friend try it and he agreed.

I subbed half-n-half for cream and light sour cream instead of real stuff. I added more of both of the former and of chicken broth for a more diplike consistency. I also added a 6oz. jar of marinated artichoke hearts, chopped, and about a third cup feta, crumbled. I also added a bit more Cayenne, which gave it some heat. Served it with big tortilla chips. Everyone raved and asked for the recipe!

This is one of the best spinach dips I've ever had! I served it in a scooped-out loaf of sourdough bread, with chunks of the bread on the side for dipping. I also omitted the garlic because my mother-in-law is allergic, and didn't miss it at all. Great recipe and I will definitely be making it again.

We really enjoyed this dip. I made it with one 10 oz. package of frozen spinach and a can of artichoke hearts (which I chopped). Served it with tortilla chips, it was really delicious and easy to make.

This dip was a hit when I made it back in March. I made it again for a friend's birthday and it disapeared in no time. Needless to say I'm making it for a Halloween party, only this time I'll do a double batch!

With all the great reviews I made and brought this to a party. My husband and I did not like it and others at the party weren't crazy about it either. We LOVE garlic but I think it had too much garlic and the other flavors didn't seem to combine well. I also use fresh parmesan - didn't matter. Beside the garlic it was otherwise bland.

This is a great appetizer made with lots of yummy and fatty ingredients. What the heck, splurge every once in a while. Speaking from experience,(I have frequented the place) Cafe Delux serves this with tortilla chips, which are really good too. Try adding some fresh chopped tomatoes.

WONDERFUL! I used crackers to serve with this and it was a BIG hit for my party.

I agree with the cook from New Orleans - too many fat-laden ingredients. It was just OK served with a spicy BBQ-style potato chip, but rather bland served with toasted bread rounds.

This was great! Have made it several times since finding the recipe. It's also just as good heated up the next day. I would definately recommend chopping the spinach and cutting off the thick stems.

I scored making this for my in-laws this weekend. It was a big hit! However next time I would not use all the 10 oz. bag of spinach, or increase the cream and/or broth. It turned out to be more of a spread than a dip, but excellent just the same.

very good dip. I followed the advice of chopping the spinach. Also best with a very good quality parmesan.

Everyone enjoyed this dish. It is unique and interesting. I used chopped frozen spinach, however, next time I would chop the spinach even more. It was a little too stringy.

I used baby spinach (packaged). This dish was so easy to prepare and so tasty. It was a hit with my dinner guests for Easter.

I would use baby spinach the next time, or at least remove the tough stems from the older spinach. I found I did not need to use the whole 10 oz pkg. of spinach.

This was a great appetizer for my St. Patty's Day dinner! My guests devoured it in about 30 minutes! Have made it several times since, always a success! We also found that it makes a great gravy over potatoes, or can be thinned to make a rich soup on those cold, windy days.

Delicious, we all enjoyed it very much. I substituted half & half for the heavy cream, and used a package of frozen chopped spinach as I already had them on hand. I don't think it effected the flavor adversley. I wonder how roasted garlic would be, and add less; or add a jar of artichoke hearts instead of spinach, or a little roasted red pepper for color. Looks like I will be making this again soon.

This recipe was easy to prepare and delicious. My guests gave rave reviews. I had to add more broth as well, and next time I would chop my spinach..

This was delicious. I needed to add more broth, cream and sour cream. I also chopped the spinach and simmered it for a few minutes over low heat to wilt the spinach a bit more. My guests were able to overlook the cream thinking that if it has spinach--it must be healthy!
