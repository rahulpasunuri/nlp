Made this recipe for Xmas eve 2011. Really delicious. Be careful not to use too much chipotle as they can be too hot. I added some more molasses because I liked its sweetness. A very good sandwich. My guests ate every bite of their sandwiches -- the best test for a good recipe.

This recipe was beyond delicious. We have made it at least three or four times since first trying it two months ago. The only change I made was to saute the red onion before adding because I was afraid the raw onion taste would be too harsh. But maybe I was wrong to adjust because the rich, salty, and creamy cheese is so good with the spicy sauce and the brightness of the cilantro -- probably Amy knows what she's doing with the onion, too. This is a new household favorite.

The chipotle spread sounded a little strange, but it worked out quite well. I will definitely be making this again.

Very good and distinctive! Great flavors ! Nice enough for company. Will make again. PS I was mistaken that I had molasses in the cupboard so I substituted mesquite-flavored honey instead. I believe that it turned out similar to the actual recipe.

Great twist on the grilled cheese sandwich. I love spicy foods and this sure fits the bill. The addition of the molasses provides a nice counterpoint to the spice. Left out the cilantro because I don't like the taste at all. No one missed that unpleasant flavor.

Great sandwich! Served it with a creamy orange tomato soup for a dinner party. Everyone loved it and the slightly sweet soup balanced the spice.

I made these when the recipe was first published in 2003 for my MIL's 60th birthday. I never forgot how much I liked them, and had to incorporate them in 2007 for my wedding, as an appetizer. They are absolutely delicious and easy, easy to prepare. Watch the amount of chipotle spread used,though, as some people will find them too spicy.

The chipotle sauce with this recipe is great. The molasses (or light cooking syrup, which is what I had to work with) balanced the spiciness of the chilis perfectly. I changed it a bit, though, because I was making the Tortilla Soup with Crisp Tortillas and Avocado Relish from this website (which is fabulous), so I made it into a quesadilla by subbing tortilla shells for the bread and adding some black beans. Made for a very warm, perfectly (not too) spicy winter meal.

What a treat! Grilled cheese and soup is one of my all time favorite dinners. This was a hit with dinner guests on a cold fall night with homemade carrot soup! The combination of flavors is fantastic. The leftover chipolte does keep well, try the mashed sweet potatoes with chipolte, yum.

The chipotle sauce keeps forever, and you can use it in all sorts of other dishes.

Fabulous, fabulous! The blend of ingredients in the chipotle spread (not as spicy as one expects) complements the vegetable and cheese mixture wonderfully. The sandwich, a good one for vegetarians, is easy to prepare and very filling. This sandwich far surpasses the bread items I've eaten at Amy's. A definite do-again.

I made this recipe when I first received my Feb. 2003 issue of Bon Appetite and have made it several times since. Really delicious. For fear of losing the recipe (as I often do!), I'm saving it to my "recipe box" AND my hard drive! It's truly a keeper. Bon Appetit.

I love this recipe! And crave the little sandwiches often. I also left out the cilantro and still thought it was fabulous!! However, I made it for my boyfriend once and he hated it. So to each his own!

Wonderful!

This was an OK recipe - One would only enjoy it if they like spicy, smoky and zesty flavors all at once. It was overrated.

For a delicious, spicy and tasty grilled cheese sandwich, this cannot be beat. But absolutely do not omit the cilantro!

Love this recipe. I always make this when I have extra pugliese bread from Costco. I usually leave out the cilantro because I'm too lazy to go out and buy it. Great anyways.

This sandwich is really good! The only change I made was to use honey instead of molasses(since that's what was in the cupboard). Try it!

These sandwiches are awesome. I served for a luncheon, and everyone was wild about them. I made them again for dinner that night, and my family loved them too. They are quick, and the chipotle sauce gives them the right amount of kick.
