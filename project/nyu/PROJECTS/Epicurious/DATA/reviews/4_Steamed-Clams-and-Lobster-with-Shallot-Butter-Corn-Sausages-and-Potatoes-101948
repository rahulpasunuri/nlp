I made the clams part of this recipes as an appetizer for our gourmet group. Worked great and the broth was wonderful.

Loved this and so did our guests. Made a few changes that worked well for us...cut red pepper amount in half per pot, used Herbs de Provence instead of oregano, petite red potatoes, and cooked corn separately to insure doneness. We re-added the corn at the end, pouring the sauce over everything. Our potatoes were a little underdone so I'll precook them a little next time. Over all...a wonderful meal.

We have made this dish several times with great success prepared the shallot butter ahead for a more balanced flavor. Purists may protest, but we have substituted garlic for the shallots (for a less sweet flavor), fresh thyme or dried herbs de provence for the oregano, and shrimp for the clams based on seasonal availability where we live.

We loved this recipe!!! Rave reviews from all my guests. I have made it about 10 times since. We get lobster a lot and I'm always looking for new recipes, this was a favorite crowd pleaser!!! It's so easy, it looks like I fussed!!!

My fiance proposed over this meal. It was perfect! and easy enough to combine into 1 pot if you plan it right. Yumm!

I loved it! I made this for my girlfriend's birthday, and she couldn't believe it. I too, couldn't believe how easy it was to make. My only suggestions would be to cut back the crushed pepper by half (the sausage got a little spicy), and to boil the corn for about 5 minutes before adding to the sausage and potatoes. This will save time, and also gaurantee the corn is tender while not risking overcooking the sausage.

I love this recipe. It's easy to make, yet comes out absolutely delicious. I've made this recipe at least 10 times since it initially came out and it has consistently been a crowd pleaser each time even with the picky eaters. One of my all time Bon Apetit favorites.

This is not finer fare, but very tasty - creole in feeling and warms the tummy. My husband particularly liked the flavorful blend. We used extra large prawns that we grilled to save on mess and time. Against my better judgement I used canned new potatoes since I did not have fresh and I would NOT recommend it.

I made this last summer and am making it again next weekend. It is simply delicious and not as hard as it seems. Very impressive!
