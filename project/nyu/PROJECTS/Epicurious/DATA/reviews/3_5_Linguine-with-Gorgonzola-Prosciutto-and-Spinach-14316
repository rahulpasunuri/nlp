About as good as something from Olive Garden. Edible, not exciting.

Delicious! I used dried herbs since I didn't have fresh, and I ended up subbing marjoram for oregano since I was out. Didn't seem to make a difference. I also didn't have enough spinach to make the bed, but again--didn't seem to make a difference. The dish had great flavor, and it was incredibly easy and quick. I would absolutely make this again.

Yum! I used bacon instead of prosciutto (and delicious bacon grease instead of some olive oil) and the results were spectacular! Its a great way to use up spinach languishing in the fridge, and to take advantage of summer's container herb garden. The bucatini I used instead of linguine, especially paired with the bacon, tasted marvelous. Would make again.

I made the sauce from this recipe to go with some gorgonzola and port ravioli that I bought at the farmers market, my dining companion could not stop complimenting the dish, oh's and ah's with every bite. I did cut down the amount of cheese to about 1/4 lb since the ravioli already had gorgonzola, also only used 1/4 C Olive oil to start and then wilted the spinach in 2T olive oil in the still hot pasta cooking pot. Very satisfying meal, served with a capri salad using fresh tomatoes from my garden.

Pretty good - a little too much gorgonzola for my taste. I think the idea of adding some tomatoes is a good idea and will try that next time. Wonder smell when the prosciutto was cooking!!!

Very niiiice. I was happy to use the herbs from my garden and accidentally pulled up a garlic early last week but it was ok. ANYWAY, it was very good. Even better the next day for leftovers. Will definately make again. May try chard.

I love coming here for inspiration. I replaced the prosciutto with portuguese chouorico sausage (somewhat spicy), added chunks of boneless chicken and used swiss chard instead of spinach and also tossed in some grape tomatoes. Fresh out of gorgonzola and pine nuts, so just did without. Yum!

Great recipe, easy and delicious! I made a few subsitutions -- used whole wheat rotini, pancetta, 1/3 cup of olive oil total, and 1 cup of freshly parmesan instead of Gorgonzola. I also added one cup of halved cherry tomatos at the end.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I used whole wheat linguine and arugula instead of spinach. Also used Dulce Gorgonzola which gave the dish a nice sweetness balanced by the arugula's peppery taste. Followed cook from Downington's advice and added olives and tomatoes. Next time will increase the fresh basil and oregano and possibly a little Italian sausage in place of some of the prosciutto. Used only 1/3 cup olive oil and .4 lb cheese.

Love this recipe its super easy to make. I left out the pine nuts and used goat cheese instead which melted into the pasta - super yummy!! I also added some fresh tomatoes chopped up. Making it again tonight at a friends house.

Excellent recipe. All the incredients play beautifully together and it tastes great when microwaved too! :-)

I can't believe I haven't reviewed this recipe before! This has become a staple in my family. There is something to be said for a recipe when your mother steals it and claims it as her own :) This dish is beautiful and delicious enough for company, yet easy enough to make everyday. I always half the oil and reduce the cheese, and as is, it's lovely, but I find I love to play with it: I love adding tomatoes, olives, artichoke hearts. So good!

This was great! But definately DO NOT substitute canadian bacon for the prosciutto! I only used about 2T. of olive oil (You won't need any for drizzling on the pasta.) Also, you will most likely only need half of the cheese.

Rating: 4
Delish! My pancetta version tasted better than the prosciutto version. Didn't use as much olive oil, used 3 garlic cloves. Also, can't skimp on good quality gorgonzola (and you should add little by little the cheese until you get the right balance - you might not need the entire .5 lb.) Everyone I made this for LOVED IT! Lastly, you should put the chopped spinach in the empty pot you used to boil the pasta in and then pour the drained pasta over the spinach (heat from the pot helps wilt the spinach)

Fast, easy and very tasty. We all enjoyed it.

I find the best blue cheese out there is 'Danish'. Give that a try.

This was wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly. I will make it often. It sounds like a lot of oil but not really considering you are using a whole pound of pasta. I was going to cut it when I first read the recipe but chose not too. I only had half a portion and still kept daily calores to a low 1400 for the day. And fat under 30%.

EXCELLENT!! This is one of my favorites. dont use half the amount of olive oil or gorgonzola they suggest or it will be way too rich. I also like a lot of spinach. its fairly easy to make too. of course, fresh pasta - always!!

i love prosciutto and gorgonzola, but paired in this recipe-i hated it! i found the flavors to be overwhelming and overly smokey. perhaps the gorgonzola i chose was too rich? perhaps my tastebuds are too immature for such a dish? i was surprised with the results after all the other great reviews.

Rating: 3
Yes, I agree with many previous reviewers that used less oil ( I used 1/4 cup). I had some organic whole wheat penne that I substituted for the linguine. This was very tasty.

Rating: 3
I LOVE Gorgonzola!! My husband does not. Even so, with a few modifications I made this dish and we really enjoyed it! First of all, we do not eat warm blooded animal flesh, so I substituted shrimp for the meat. Simple to make and FABULOUS! This is now on the list of regular meals!

Love this one--I agree with everyone else, definitely cut down on the oil. Don't use cheap gorgonzola if you can help it, it just mars the taste. Same with prosciutto. !

My friends and I found this pasta dish delicious. I added all the spinach and cut back on the olive oil a little. I agree you could use less gorgonzola. Some bread and good tomatoes on the side and you have a great meal.

Delicious! I cut the oil back to 1/2 cup total, and cut back the gorgonzola a bit. The prosciutto renders as it cooks, and the cheese is creamy, so there is plenty of fat for the sauce. I used plenty of garlic, added a whole shallot, and added 4 pieces of preserved lemon -- chopped those together in the mini-prep before adding them to the prosciutto in the pan. I used one pound of fresh lemon linguine (I'm lucky enough to live near a fresh pasta store). I did not serve on the bed of spinach, but served a salad alongside the pasta. Great dish for company! Easily serves 4 main dishes -- possibly 5.

This dish gets rave reviews everytime I make it, and I've made it about 10 times now. I've evolved the recipe to suit my own tastes: 1. Use farfalle instead of linguine as the shape lends itself better to mixing with the prosciutto and spinach. 2. I use about 2/3 bunch of spinach, probably about a half pound or so. 3. I use about 1/4 cup of olive oil for cooking, and none for tossing as I find that the fat from the melted cheese is enough. 4. I use only about 1/4 lb of gorgonzola. I found that more than this and the gorgonzola overwhelms the dish. 5. I also garnish with dried cranberries to add a little sweetness and acidity.

Very good! I added sauteed chicken breast, and cut down on some of the olive oil by adding a little pasta water when tossing it all together. I will definitely make again.

This recipe has been great for me! I have made it on numerous occasions when we have had company. The spinach is great for presentation, but I really like to just add it all in the pasta. I don't put as much of the gorgonzola in because it gets a little strong, even though I love the stuff.

beautiful and delicious. as others, also reduced the amount of olive oil substantially. i used penne instead of linguine, and added halved cherry tomatoes which was great for extra color and flavor. the fresh spinach is great for presentation (and texture). super simple and perfect for company.

Very good. I also used less oil and doubled the basil and fresh oregano. I will definitely make again. I like the shrimp idea too.

Yummy! Made a couple of minor changes, only used about two tablespoons of olive oil, the recipe calls for WAY too much. Also added some cherry tomatoes along with the proscuitto. Marvelous!

An excellent dish! My husband calls it one of our house specials and requests it frequently. I would go lighter on the olive oil as others have said but wouldn't change anything else. Easy and delicous!

Like another reviewer, used pancetta. Definitely preferred.

Like the others before me, I only used a 1/2 cup of olive oil and it was more that enough. I sauteed some shrimp and served them on the side--it turned out wonderful! Also, I did not use fresh herbs but think I might next time. I will definitely be making it again! It is a great spring-time pasta dish.

Delicious! Definately less oil. I also would separate the prosciutto up a little. It has a tendency to glom (new word) with the cheese. Must use fresh herbs.

Definitely follow the others advice. I also substituted pancetta for proscuitto and it was delicious. I cut the pancetta into chunks, fried it like bacon and then added it to the when the recipe called for the proscuitto. Yummy and slightly more smoky flavored.

Absolutely delicious! Followed prior advice from reviewers...... prompted us to drive to Wilmington! Restaurant is as great as this dish! Chef certainly has a 'thing' with pungent cheeses! Tried their chicken w/gorgonzola w/sage and linguine. Husband had chicken w/goat cheese w/apple smoked bacon w/linguine.-

Taking the advice of others before us, we used the penne (delicious!) and the 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/2 the cheese - these alternative worked very well. I used dried herbs and next time I will most definitely use fresh. This recipe is almost better the next day - we have to give the recipe to several coworkers who demanded to know what it was after the reheat at the office microwave.

Rating: 3
Very good. Love the flavors. However, 3/4 cup of olive oil is ridiculous. I used 1/4 cup and it was just fine - any more would have made it very oily. I also used about 1/3 lb of cheese and thought it was plenty.

Very yummy combination of flavours. I also cut back on the oil...the recipe call for way too much.

This is a wonderful dish! I added fresh cilantro to the saute and it resulted in a great flavor. I would saute the spinach next time--I did for a short time this time, but it needed to be cooked a bit more. Fast & easy & good enough to serve guests!

Easy to make and delicious. Use fresh herbs if at all possible. You could used toasted walnuts in this recipe also. Be sure to chop them finely after toasting.

dish was very good and very easy to prepare. i did cut down on the oil and did not strain all of the water from the pasta, used it to mix in with the rest of the recipe, found this cut down on the oil and still kept the dish moist. would definitely make again.
