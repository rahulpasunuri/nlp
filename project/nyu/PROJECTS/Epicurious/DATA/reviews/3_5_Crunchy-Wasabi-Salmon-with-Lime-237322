I had high hopes for this one, but it was so-so. Interesting way to use wasabi peas and it is quick and easy. See my version here: http://eatingininstead.com/2012/07/20/salmon-with-wasabi-peas-food-list-challenge-no-99/

I made this recipe this evening. It is definitely staying in our recipe rotation. After reading the reviews, I was afraid it wouldn't have enough flavor so I punched up the flavor/heat a bit by making a "paste" of 2 Tablespoons mayo and 1 Tablespoon lime juice with 3/4 teaspoon of both wasabi powder and ground ginger. I spread this on the salmon before applying the crushed wasabi peas. Next time I think I will up it to 1 teaspoon each of the wasabi and ground ginger since it was not quite spicy enough for me.

First, I am not a huge salmon fan, but this is a recipe that we have done often. Love the suggestion of the wasabi paste to boost the flavor as well as the panko. We will try that next time. One reviewer said to marinate overnight with the lime juice. The acid in the lime will cook the fish, so if you marinate it, leave the lime out. We thought the salad just OK, so do not serve it with that. The quality of the wasabi peas makes a difference as others mentioned.

I made this into appetizers, cutting each filet in to 8 piece. Used a little mayo and wasabi paste on recommendation of prior reviewers to hold the peas in place and boost the flavor. Served in a chafing dish, added a little soy in bottom of dish to keep fish moist.

great idea to use the wasabi peas on salmon! used a ton of extra lime juice and soysauce and chili peppers and bell pepper instead of cabbage. agree with previous comments to use wasabi paste and lime on the fillets.

Loved it. I used wasabi soy beans instead of peas. I put the wasabi paste on the fillet as others suggested. And I added panko to the ground up wasabi beans. I was so surprised at how delicious the vegetables were!

excellent, the wasabi mellowed and the lime brightened.

great recipe for frozen salmon -- makes a rich crunchy crust and adds flavor to previously frozen fish. It is now a regular feature in my easy family healthy meals cycle.

Thanks to all the reviews I decided to marinate the salmon over night with lime juice, lime zest, wasabi powder, sea salt and olive oil. Then I just added the crushed wasabi peas mixed with ponko. It was yummy!!

Great! I used hot wasabi peas and drizzled a blend of wasabi in a tube and soy sauce over the finished dish. Did a different veggie stir- fry to go along side.

This was pretty good, but as most people note, the intensity of the wasabi peas did not come through. Next time, I'm going to drizzle some melted butter over and increase the lime. I'd definitely make it again, the recipe just needs tweaking. Also , the cabbage and peas were excellent and pretty to look at.

This is the recipe I turn to when I aim to impress but don't have a lot of time to prepare. I usually double the amount of lime zest atop the salmon, because they are delicious when toasted in the oven. For anyone looking to pair wine with this, don't expect a lot of wasabi taste from the peas. I enjoyed this with a dry and fruity red such as lemberger.

I have made this recipe and love it! A great way to "spice" up a typical dinner!

Love salmon, love wasabi. Read the reviews and made it for dinner this evening. It was horrible, one diner out of 4 liked it. The wasabi pea topping did not marry well with the fish. The cabbage and snow peas were lame but for their beautiful colors. After reading the reviews of the weak wasabi taste I actually smeared a thin layer of wasabi (freshly grated from Inglehoffer) over the salmon before pressing the peas over the fish. A fish as savory as salmon does not need the likes of wasabi peas.

This was incredibly simple & super yummy! I noticed that the number one complaint that people had was that they're wasabi peas weren't spicy enough. I bought mine at Trader Joe's and felt that they had the perfect amount of spice. We discovered that drizzling a little lime over the cabbage & snow peas helped give them a bit more flavor. I paired this meal with the Babock Sav Blanc (Cali Central Coast). Perfect match!

This is one of the most beautiful meals I've ever made. I wanted to take a picture, however as someone who only wants things spicy spicy spicy, I was disappointed with the flavor. I agree that while the wasabi peas make for a nice presentation, you cannot really taste them once they've been crushed. Next time I will try adding a thin layer of actual wasabi between the salmon and the peas.

I just made the salmon and it was soooo good! The lime was a great touch and the wasabi peas (i used mild) added a delicious crunch and touch of flavor. Also, very easy!

Well, after speculating earlier about the type of wasabi peas used, I, too, found that the wasabi had no punch at all after cooking. Next time I will add some wasabi paste or wasabi powder. Unlike another cook, mine was melt in your mouth moist, made exactly as directed. Vegetable side dish was good and certainly pleasing to the eye. With a different entree I might make the cabbage and sugar snap peas with some balsamic.

We loved this dish! I followed another reviewer's suggestion, and added ginger. I also marinaded the salmon in soy sauce and rice wine for a short time before cooking. I used wasabi peas from Whole Foods, which were not bright green. Makes me wonder if the brightly colored ones have artificial coloring...Anyway, we're always looking for interesting new ways to prepare salmon, and this is a good one!

Interesting texture and flavorful. The peas lose a little punch during the process, but still very tatsy.

I made this with tofu instead of salmon. The peas lost their flavor and did not taste good. They also left a bright green stain everywhere they touched the tofu, leading me to believe they were coated in food dye. A suggestion for a brand of wasabi pea that works better would be much appreciated. The lime zest did add a good flavor, but I wanted it to be a lot more spicy.

Plan to make this but have read comments about peas losing their flavor. There are 3 kinds of wasabi peas I've come across. Regular wasabi peas, hot wasabi peas (my favorite) and they are both crunchy. I've also run across another kind where the peas are green and white and hard/gritty. The kind of peas you use might make a difference.

Made this two nights ok and it was so dry, I was embarrassed to serve it. It was just bland, I finally brought out a vinaigrette to add some zest. Wouldn't make it again, but would definitely make the cabbage and sugar peas that accompanied the recipe (in the magazine).

Great! The heat of the wasabi is tamed by the salmon. The texture of the crunchy peas on the salmon is great. I got lazy and mixed the peas, lime zest and olive oil together and pressed the mixture on the salmon, it came out fine.

Prepared only the salmon. The peas lost their zing and didn't really make a crust. Maybe it matters which brand of wasabi peas you use. I don't plan to make this again.

What an easy good recipe. I did do the cabbage differently, though. I sauteed some cabbage in a wok and seasoned it with Vietnamese sweet chili sauce.

I just made the fish, not the veggies. Also, I used mahi mahi instead of salmon. It was fabulous. I'll have to make it again following the recipe exactly.

This was sooo easy to make and delicious too...both my husband & 6 year old loved it....don't change a thing -- follow the recipe exactly and you'll have a fabulous meal....easy clean up too! One thing I did find -- it took about 10 minutes more to cook the salmon than suggested. Would definately make it again and again and again.

I think this a delicious recipe! I like a little more kick from my wasabi, so I mixed Brianna's ginger/mandarin dressing with Wasabi paste to taste and drizzled that over salmon-- Perfect!

Oudstanding. I didn't make any changes. It was sooo easy and sooo good! My husband and I like food with a lot of flavor and the wasabi salmon and vegetable side dish did just that!

This is such a simple and clever way to make salmon. I tinkered a little: drizzled with some soy and grated fresh ginger before putting on the peas. Served it at a buffet for 12 last night and everyone enjoyed it.

Glad I didn't read the one fork review before considering whether to make this dish -- we loved it! Thought it was unbelievably easy for something so tasty -- really liked the combo of the wasabi peas and lime -- as well as colorful. Would definitely make it again and for company!

We followed this recipe to the letter, and it was a major, MAJOR, disappointment. The wasabi peas tasted great out of the box, but once they were crushed, they lost their zing and tasted like stale bits of flavorless dried peas. And the lime peel added a distinct bitterness. The cabbage was also disappointing. I won't make this again.

Wow! I still can't believe a recipe so easy could taste so good!!! If you have some wasabi peas around, I highly recommend that you make this recipe. I made it with both salmon and sea bass and actually feel that it's more balanced with the salmon. If you use good wasabi peas, the stronger flavor of the salmon is necessary. We drizzled just a bit of lime over the fish and added a touch of salt. Nothing else was necessary; unbelievably easy and tasty for a weekday dinner. Although we're not big fans of cabbage, the sliced red cabbage was very good with the dish. I'm in danger of making this again tomorrow...

Excellent. Though I was surprised that the intensity of the peas didn't come through. The flavor mellowed. We squeezed quite a bit of lime juice on ours and also a sprinkling of soy sauce.
