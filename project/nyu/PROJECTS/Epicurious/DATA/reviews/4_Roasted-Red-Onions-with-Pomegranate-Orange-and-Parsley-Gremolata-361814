I was hoping this would be festive with the Pomegranate but it stuck to the foil in the first 20 minutes. Had to start over and was not impressed with the outcome. I much prefer a halved onion with butter, balsamic and honey glaze.

Delicious! I might cut down on the oil a little bit but otherwise it is delicious. The gremolata is just the right touch of freshness to the roasted flavors. I made this for Thanksgiving, where it was requested at a Christmas party, where the recipe was requested from 2 people. A definite favorite.

Excellent recipe. Prepared exactly as written. I almost skipped the gremolata; that would have been a significant mistske. The gremolata is a great addition to the recipe. The flavors are excellent. Guests were impressed, as was I.

This was a really good way to spice up your typical roasted vegis. I would add eggplants borrowing from this recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Cumin-Scented-Eggplant-with-Pomegranate-and-Cilantro-350409 I made these two together along with Bulgur pilav1 and merguez

Made it as is and all enjoyed the roasted onions, a beautiful side dish and certainly a keeper.

The red onions were absolutely delicious! The pomegranate molasses added such a wonderful sweet flavor to the onions. I would definitely make the roasted onions again. However, I did not really care for the gremolata--next time I'll just sprinkle pomegranate seeds by themselves on the onions. There is no need for the parsley or the orange zest.
