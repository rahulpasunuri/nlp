I was pleasantly surprised by the flavors in the dressing. Perhaps those who weren't impressed used unseasoned rice vinegar by mistake, which I certainly have done on occasion in the past with other recipes. To cut down on the prep, I made a rather large julienne, cutting the snow peas in half lengthwise and cutting the carrot in eighths. I roasted the bell pepper over an open flame to give it a bit more flavor and to remove the skin. I served this with couscous with pistachios and currents, from this site, and grilled skinless boneless chicken breasts I had marinated in seasoned orange juice. The combination was excellent.

I made this as a warm side dish and it was amazing. Took everything and sauteed it briefly in a little butter, rather than the dressing and it was perfect.

I make this all the time, when I'm looking for a colorful side dish to just about anything - pork tenderloin, chicken, fish, filet mignon. It goes with all.

I made this for a family gathering of fussy eaters. I figured it was safe b/c the flavors were rather mild, but it was not a big hit. I prefer dishes w/ more intense flavor. I would probably not make it again.

This was a huge hit with my guests. Instead of blanching the vegetables, I steamed them, which was just as easy.

The pluses of this dish: very healthy and easy, and the veggies stay crisp for a few days. My only problem was that I didn't like the vinaigrette much. So, I tried an experiment...took a small portion, rinsed the vinaigrette off, drained it, and tossed with some seasoned rice vinegar, a splash of soy sauce, and a few drops of sesame oil. That was just as easy, and I liked it better. A sprinkling of toasted sesame seeds on top would probably be good, too.

This was good, easy, healthy and colorful. The dressing needs something more, though...whether heavier on the dijon or maybe add a tad of pepper sauce for some kick. I'm not sure what, but it will be fun to play with.

It wasn't bad, but not something I would rush to make again..
