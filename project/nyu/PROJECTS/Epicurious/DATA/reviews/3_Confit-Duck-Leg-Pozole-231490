Good basic approach. This was what I picked to use up some confit turkey thigh. I made it with fresh light brown chicken stock. The traditional accompaniments are cabbage, lime wedges, radish and fried tortilla strips ande cilantro. We also added fresh tomato chunks, Queso Cojita and avocado. The lime juice is citical -- it takes the flavor to a whole different level!

I made this for 4 instead of 1. Even though I increased the simmer times to account for the additional water, this was still rather bland. I used tortilla chips (as suggested by the other user) instead of the rendered skin to cut down on fat. I think I'd save the special trip to get duck legs and skip this one.

I made this just because it sounded so unusual. I'd never worked with duck confit before. I doubled the recipe to serve two. The meal was quite good. We both enjoyed it. However, I think it would be just as tasty made with chicken - and a lot less expensive, too. The rendered fat, which adds crunch to the stew, could easily be replaced by some coarsely crumbled tortilla chips.

mmmm, this was delicious. I went to the butcher and got a duck leg, some venison, and some nice, fresh bunny. Then, I went home and treated myself to a cute animal feast! What a great way to feel good on Valentine's Day. I highly recommend this receipe.
