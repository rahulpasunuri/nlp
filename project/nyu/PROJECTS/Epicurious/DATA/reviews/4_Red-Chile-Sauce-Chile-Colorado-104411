This is my go to sauce for Tamale's, Enchilada's,Pazole and even Chili. I double and triple the recipe and then I can it (hot water method). I have it on hand when ever I need it...

Wonderful sauce! I will never buy enchilada sauce again. Next time I make this I'll definitely double the recipe so that I can freeze some for later use.

I think I made the fatal mistake of over-toasting my chiles. I'd do even less than 30 seconds on one side. The sauce was a tad bitter so, naturally, I added some butter:) About three tablespoons. A little uncouth, not necessarily very Mexican, but I served it with the chile/cilantro capon dish and my guests raved. One of them said he wanted to douse himself in the sauce every night. So if you're up for a little iconoclasty, whisk in some butter!

I make this in double and triple batches - I then can the chili to use in various recipies like chili, pazole or even enchiladas. mmm mmm good! I give as gifts for christmas or friends that stop by and "have to have it".. Thanks for the recipe. its not as good as my old friend (92+) Josephine Romero's but she wont share.

This is actually a pretty flexible sauce - I had seen Mexican friends of mine peel and add tomato to theirs, so I added one, and I think this helps add liquid and natural sugar. I thought the choice of sherry vinegar was a little odd, but tried it anyway - and sure enough, I didn't think it was ideal. I would just use plain white vinegar. I have also seen several recipes where the sauce is cooked afterward if using as an enchilada sauce etc., and I did this. Mine came out thick and rich, no need for flour and again - that seems like an odd addition. Overall, very yummy, much better than canned!

I love this recipe. I can't find sherry vinegar & use red wine vinegar instead. (Would cooking Sherry work? I've never tried it.) Cornstarch also works well, if you prefer to avoid wheat. I also like to use organic chicken better than bullion instead of salt for an even fuller flavor. It's not essential, but so good.

Initial thoughts - sauce is great, but not much heat. To bump heat, we added two small ghost chiles. Recommend cooking all of the ingredients together, pureeing all ingredients together, and sieving together instead of separately as in recipe. Would definitely make again.

After moving to Southern New Mexico a year ago from Chicago, I experienced the deliciousness of their chiles, and of course, chile colorado. I finally mustered the courage to try to cook with dry chiles for the first time EVER, and nearly wound up eating all of this sauce with a spoon before my fiance (who also raved) got home for dinner. I personally will add a few spicier chiles in the mix next time. I did only make it with the NM chiles because the store didn't even know what guajillos were. Def a keeper, and not at all too difficult!

Excellent. Had tried other chile colorado recipes and they came out bitter. This was perfectly balanced. Cooked with 1.5 lbs cubed beef and a couple diced potatoes. Made 3 hearty portions. I would double the recipe for 4 or more people.

I've made this sauce numerous times over the past few years to accolades every time. I stopped trying to toast the chiles in the pan and found the flavor to be almost the same. I usually quadruple the recipe or even more, freezing small portions to be used later. I've mixed up the chiles too to discover even more unique flavors. My friends who grew up in the southwest are amazed to find such authentic flavor here in my kitchen in the NW.

Wow! This is the best Chile Colorado sauce I've ever had. I served it with chunks of pork that I'd browned and simmered until tender in a bit of chicken broth and then reheated with the red chili sauce. Add a sprinkle of Mexican cheese blend and some tortillas and it just doesn't get any better. I can't wait to make it again.

Really good. Like many others, I altered this a bit, putting the lightly sauteed onion and garlic in the blender with the chiles. I also used brown sugar instead of white, giving this a different type of sweetness. Better, I think. As is our preference, used hot chiles. Key is straining the mixture when it comes out of the blender.

I make a variation of this sauce without the vinegar and using masa flour to thicken. I grow my own chilies and dry them. They are a mixture of different NM chiles and are wonderful to cook with. I cook cubed beef or pork with this sauce and serve it with fried polenta and many condiments, it rocks!

I made chicken enchiladas tonight with this sauce. It was really, really good. I pretty much made it exactly as it was written. I may have added about twice as much onion though. I couldn't keep my fingers out of the sauce as I was putting the enchiladas togeather. They were fabulous. The sauce was the richest color of red I could have imagined. I've never seen it that vibrant at a restaurant. I ate up the enchiladas and froze some more for later. I doubled the recipe.

I have been making chile colorado for 30 years since I lived in southern New Mexico. This recipe is as close to mine as I have seen. I just made it today with these modifications: triple the amount of chiles and no guajillos. I sauteed the garlic before adding it to the chiles in the blender. I used no onion and no cumin. I put the blended sauce through a food mill (my favorite part) and then cooked the sauce with salt and pepper and oregano for 15 minutes. No flour, no vinegar and no sugar. I baked four chicken legs at 350 for 1/2 hour and then added the chile colorado and cooked them another 1/2 hour. I served it on jasmine rice with a side salad. Absolutely fabulous. My son and daughter in law were in heaven. Oh and so was I. I used to make it with cubed pork dredged in flour and fried but this dish had to be porkless. The chicken, just like the pork, evened out the chile and made it rich and flavorful.

I used this recipe as a starting point but of course modified it somewhat. I used an entire bag (8 oz) of dried California chilis- steeped as per recipe- but I added onion, more garlic and the spices to blender. Then I simmered for about 30 minutes. The sauce was nice and thick due to the increased amount of chilis so no flour was needed. I also used a sprinkle of red wine vinegar that really helps cut the bitterness. Enchiladas rojo were delicious!

I really love this sauce. It is great over roast pork, and mixed in with shredded pork for tacos. Double up the recipe as one cook suggested and use it for enchiladas as follows: Fry 12 corn tortillas still slightly crisp and set aside. Mix together a carton of Fage 2% Greek yogurt, one bunch of chopped green onions, and a cup or so of shredded cheddar cheese. Add about tablespoon and a half of ground cumin. Roll up into the tortillas. Put the sauce on top and add a bit more cheddar and a few of the chopped green onion tops. Heat in a 350 oven for about 20 minutes.

Incredible. I made a double batch of this sauce and mixed it with 10 lbs, of chuck roast that I cut into 1" cubes and cooked it in a crock pot until tender. I also threw in one ounce of chile ancho because I like their flavor. I had so much that I could get creative in serving it. I warmed some corn tortillas, put them on a plate, spread refried beans (I prefer Ducal brand) on them, topped that with 2 fried eggs and some of my sauce and meat and viola!...breakfast. I also topped pizza dough with it and some shredded cheddar cheese for an unusual dinner.

This is the real North Mexico "chile colorado" and it is good with pork roast or beef. But it is great with enchiladas, the only thing is that there is not such a thing as enchilada casseroles or stuffed enchiladas in Mexico. Some times we use chicken (just chicken) and always grated cheese (not the american yellow one, but Chihuahua cheese or a Chester or white cheddar).

This is a classic Red Chile recipe, although in New Mexico we don't use the guajillos. I would recommend cubing pork roast, browining it and then simmering with the Red Chile sauce for about an hour. It is awesome.

This is absolutely superb and a good way to show folks who don't understand that chili peppers have a flavor beyond hot what they're missing. I'm about to make it for the second time tonight and I know I'll keep this dish in my regular repertoire. My plan is to make it and freeze it in single serving containers. I've put it on the capon dish, and also burritos and quesadillas. An excellent sauce that will make you think up new things to put it on. And it's fun to make, the peppers are absolutely beautiful and the sauce comes out a gorgeous color.

OUTSTANDING! My only advice is to double or triple the recipe. I used California Chilies (could not find the New Mexico) and the Guajillos.Also took the advise from the person in Mexico and added 5 cloves Garlic and(on my own)5 T. of onion. After cooking as instructed added garlic onion mixture to blender with the chilies.Made a second batch and cut salt in half and only used a teas. of the cumin.Had two beautiful rib eye steaks and decided to splurge.Cut of fat and rendered in sautee pan then cubed and browned.Poured over the red chile sauce and served with warm tortillas and whole pinto beans fixed upwith fresh jalapeno,garlic and minced onion that had been briefly sauteed.Also made shredded chicken soft tacos and no one touched them. Raves for the beef with red chilie sauce.Can hardly wait for dinner this eve. left overs! By the way spent 30 years in Tucson and understand and love REAL Mexican food!!! Thank you for this recipe.

Tried the technique given by the reviewer from Mexico and it was better than the vast majority of the Mexican restaurants in town.

I deviated. I discovered some ripe Anaheim chiles in my garden (in January!) and after roasting them needed some ideas. This recipe sounded good and I followed it exactly except for using 6 ounces of the fresh red chiles and substituting masa harina for the flour, and it's damn good. I have since made this according to the recipe and it's as good as anything my favorite Mexican restaurant serves.

Traditionally, this sauce would be made with chile ancho instead of the New Mexico chiles and the onion, garlic and spices would all be added to the blender and liquified with the chiles, then the entire sauce is "fried" in fat. Save yourself some hassle of chopping the onion and garlic and do it that way. Definitely strain, though, or you'll have bits of chile skin in the sauce. I would also add at least 2 more cloves of garlic for this much sauce.

An excellent red chile sauce that is good for enchiadas, tostadas, as a side sauce for chicken or pork.

Yumilicious!! I made this last year and am craving it again. Will make it tonight while Iron Chef is on and have huevos rancheros tomorrow. Tastes very "authentic"-- as far as I know--I live near San Jose, CA. Takes time but worth it.

Made this to go with chicken enchiladas (filling made with chicken, green onion, monterey jack, roasted green chiles and sour cream). It is a wonderful sauce and as someone else said, fun to make even if it takes a while. I did roast the chiles in the oven...325 degrees...until they were aromatic instead of using the skillet as it seemed easier and is a method used in several of the other recipes I have. The sauce needs to mellow a little, it tasted harsh right after I added the salt, sherry vinegar and sugar, but oh the finished product! A wonderful way to get my "tex-mex" fix.

This is the best sauce on the planet. It takes some time but it's fun to make. I've made about 4 batches this year.

This sauce is to die for! I made it with the Chili-rub Capon recipe. However, this sauce is so good you can serve it with anything. We are using the leftovers for enchiladas. We will also use it for chips and dip. Very, very good.
