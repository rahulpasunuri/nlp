This recipe was disappointing--the flavors were just too subtle. I'll have the leftovers for lunch today and maybe it will be better like other reviewers said. But it's not worth making just for leftovers!

I enjoyed this; it was a great side dish as well as a snack.

Really delicious, considering how little time, money, and effort it takes to make it. And yes, it's even better the next day.

Easy to make, and great mix of flavors. Even better the next day.

This is a tasty side dish but it lacks oomph. I substituted fresh thyme for fresh tarragon and the results were pretty good. I'd make this again because I usually have all of the ingredients on hand and it's quick.

Good stuff! Simple, yet tasty side dish. Admired by adults and small children alike. Next time I make this I will a) start the fennel cooking a bit earlier than the tomatoes and onions, b) cut it smaller, and c) use parsely (I don't like tarragon so omitted it).
