We were very dissapointed with the outcome of this dish. It tased like pot roast and a very expensive one at that. Maybe i did something wrong? Next time i will stick to veal picatta or parm. No more shanks.

This was my first time making osso buco. I substituted lamb for veal. And, i substituted equal parts water & vinegar for the wine. I served it over mashed potatoes (how decadent!) and it was yummy! got the thumbs up from my boyfriend. would definitely make again.

My husband loved this dish, but neither one of us had tasted osso buco before, so we can't say how authentic it was. I confess though: I did need to make some changes to reflect our personal tastes. Because of ambiguity regarding herbs (dried or fresh?) I used both kinds of parsley. I also added a bit of lemon pepper (the gravy was a bit bland beforehand) and used veal demi glace instead of water. I also topped with gremolata from another recipe--my husband loved all the garlic but had to get up and brush his teeth again in the middle of the night! Served with polenta, which was nice.

Very easy to make, and so delicious... Don't fudge on the lemon zest; it adds a wonderful flavor to the dish that would quickly reduce it to merely good.

Very tasty dish - we've tried it without the lemon zest, and it totally changed the dish for the worse, so don't try it without it!

high quality veal shanks are a must. this is classic recipe. used mushroom stock instead of water. any stock (beef, etc) would add depth of flavor. you can fudge on lemon zest, pepper, garlic, etc as your taste demands.

I jazzed it up a little with Monteray steak seasoning, but over all it was excellent. Extremely easy to prepare, and it got rave reviews from my MOTHER-IN-LAW!!!!!!! Will make again, and again. I served it over the frozen thick egg noodles, yummy!

I have made better. Try adding anchovie paste for that great "zing" and it also needed much more lemon. I sauteed the onions after browning the meat and deglazing the pan - makes for a richer sauce. Had to go my own way because this recipe was bland-o!

Absolutely scrumptious! I make it every 3 months, enough to eat one and freeze 2 more/2 person portions. Unbelievaly good, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd time. Drink it with red wine, white wine, and simply with plain pasta or rice (sauce is awesome). A forever & ever recipe. Thanks.

Followed your recipe only changed the oil and butter to 3 Tbsp. each and no flour, instead of water used Beef Broth and at the end used cornstarch to thicken the Gravy. Served with Garlis mashed Yukon Gold potatoes. Vegetable was fresh white Asparagus. Strawberry cheesecake and Vietnam French Kaffee for desert.

I have made this recipe as written and with my own variations from memory for years. It is so SO good and practically impossible to screw up. I usually serve it with mashed potatoes. YUMMMM!

I cooked this in my crockpot for 6 hours (probably didn't need to be in that long) and used top grade veal shanks from a gourmet store--this was a delicious meal.I served it over parmesan polenta. With the right presentation, this is on par with any 5 star restaurant.
