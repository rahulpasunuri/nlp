I thought this recipe was fabulous. I added a little garlic powder into the dry cheese before cooking the cauliflower in an iron skille. My daughter who isn't a veggie eater loved it!

This was okay, but not great I used fresh cauliflower, half the amount of parsley, and added balsamic vinegar, which really helped. It was a good way for me to use cauliflower, as I like cauliflower, but don't like it plain steamed. I like recipes like this that give me a new way to use a vegetable I don't use on a regular basis. Also a good summer salad.

Flavorful spring/summer side salad. I have made this with a number of times and it is universally enjoyed. my guests love the unique way to serve cauliflower and even the kids like it!

We love this recipe as a nice, different, summer salad. It's a hit every time we serve it. I think the trick is to let the egg drip off the flowerettes before coating with the cheese it is not so "soupy" as some people complain. You also need to know how to fry so you get that golden brown delicious crispy coating. I HATE vinegar and so the use of lemon with he mushrooms works perfectly for me. It's a nice and flavorful way to marinate the mushrooms. The lemon gives the entire dish a nice zing in my opinion.

We doubled the lemon zest and added a little red chili flake to the mushrooms. My boyfriend thought it was delicious and wants to serve it the next time we have guests.

Interesting but not amazing. I had trouble coating the cauliflower in the parmesan. I added some vinegar and that helped zest it up a little. Not impressed.

This was unique and delicious. Used a little less parsley than called for, but otherwise followed recipe as written and it was great. Have also just made the parmesan cauliflower and served warm as a side dish on its own.

I used fresh cauliflower from a farmer's market. Really quite a sensational dish, and more tasty than using frozen.

The taste and texture of this dish are pretty good but it needs depth. I added balsamic vinegar as recommended by another reviewer. That helped but it still needed something--perhaps just a touch of sauteed bacon or proscuitto. I served it with my favorite asparagus soup (Judy Rogers' Zuni Cafe cookbook) which contains pancetta and rice. The two dishes together were a good combo. We don't usually eat fried foods and I felt that the calorie content of this dish wasn't worth it. Save the calories for dessert.

I followed the recipe with the following exceptions: 1)I used a fresh cauliflower, which I blanched whole for a few minutes and then separated into florets, and 2)I added a splash of balsamic vinegar at the end to give it a little more tang. Excellent dish!

This is a great recipe! My cauliflower turned out nice and crispy, not soggy. I used a microplane to get 1 cup of cheese (I halved the recipe), I wondered if the other poster used a normal grater, which packs more cheese into a cup (microplane makes it fluffier). I did use less parsley than called for - about a cup or a cup and a half (it should have been 2.5 cups for a half recipe). I also used fresh cauliflower. Half a recipe makes about 3 servings, the recipe makes a very generous 4 servings, you could easily serve 6 with it.

This dish was a real shame. You take delicious parmesan coated fried cauliflower and mix it (read: ruin it) with the marinated mushrooms and a ton of parsley. I used half the amount of parsley that was called for and it was still overwhelming (as was the taste of the marinade). Pretty bad, to put it mildly.

Excellent dish, that will appeal to salad-shunners due to the hearty cauliflower and interesting parmesan crust. I was a little put off by the frozen cauliflower and was going to use fresh, but convenience won out. It would be better next time with fresh (blanched) cauliflower florets, in bigger chunks that you get with frozen.
