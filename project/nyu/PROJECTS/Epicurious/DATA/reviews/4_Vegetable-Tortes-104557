This is really a delicious recipe. I substitute zucchini for eggplant and have used phyllo dough instead of puff pastry dough.

I've had this recipe clipped out since it first appeared in Gourmet and have finally tackled it. It was just as most reviewers said - just delicious and a crowd pleaser. I omitted the peas, used roasted garlic in the potatoes(you can use several cloves since it is so mild). I sauteed chopped spinach and shallots and used this as a layer in one torte and zucchini in the other in place of eggplant. The spinach looked good as the green layer. Next time I will only make one, that would have been enough for 11, although I am enjoying the leftovers! Just heat in a hot oven to crisp up the puff pastry again. Prep is tedious but most can be done ahead and the result is well worth the effort. This is a recipe to save for sure!

Following the other reviewers suggestions, I roasted 2 garlics to add to the potatoes and prepared the grilled vegetables and mushrooms the day before. The hardest bit was creating a lattice pastry look on the top. The only other change was I used a mixture of parmesan, chedder and mozzarella cheese. I halved the recipe to make just one, for a party of 5. We ate the entire torte. It looked fabulous and all loved it. Would definitely make it for another dinner party.

Have made many times, excellent recipe. I find there's no need to go thru all that fuss for the potatoes; I just make regular mashed potatoes and add some roasted garlic (like others, omit the peas). I've occasionally used bottled roasted peppers...there's a small taste difference but it does save some time.

Yum! Mine didn't turn out so pretty- the puff pastry rose up in a kind of bulky way. But man was it good. Put aside plenty of time for making it.

Undeniably the best vegetarian main dish I've ever made at home. It truly is worthy of the highest grade restaurants. The steps may look daunting, but each step is quite easy. It's best to split the work over two days. Make the fillings one day and assemble the next day. I was a little unsure of how the roasted red peppers would taste...they worked very well in this dish. If you taste any individual filling, you will think they are just okay...but, something magical happens when it all comes together. Also, the puff pastry is delicious and is a huge time saver compared to making your own dough/pasty. Warning - this recipe serves a huge crowd. One torte fed 10 people as the main dish. It's truly one of the best recipes, if not THE best, on this site. Enjoy!

I made this for a group of meat-eaters as part of a vegetarian dinner and they loved it! I substituted carrots for the red peppers and a mixture of spinach and swiss chard for the peas. Defintely worth the effort on a special occassion.

I substituted yam for potatoe as mashed potatoes were already on the menu, otherwise I made it as written. Overall this dish is excellent but not worth the effort outside of a special meal such as Christmas. I agree the dish is best served warm to hot.

Oh, I also roasted the garlic for the potatoes per other reviewers' recommendations.

This was phenomenal. I followed the recipe exactly (halved to make just one), omitting only the peas. Forgot to salt the layers between assembly but nothing was missing. My guests LOVED this. Agree it should be served on the hot/warm side.

I made this and it truly does take 5 hours, but it was worth the work. I made the recipe as is, but the next time I will use zuchini instead of mushrooms, since I really do not like mushrooms.

This recipe was a huge success when I had some vegetarian friends over. I did roast the garlic for the potatoes, increased the shallots for the mushrooms, added a little parmesan cheese between the layers, and used quite a bit of salt and pepper to season each layer.

Spectacular results worthy of the best restaurants. Amazing entree for vegetarians, but loved by the carnivores as well. One of the best recipes on this website.

Worth every hour it takes to make, this was a savory dish that was appreciated by all my guests. I knew the vegetarians would love it, but the meat-eaters raved equally. I spread out the preparation over two days...can't imagine doing it in one. Next time I will pre-cook the pastry shell for a few minutes before filling as the bottom was a little softer than I would like. Otherwise, it was a great presentation and terrific flavor combination. The smoke gouda really enhances.

This torte is awesome. Made it for some vegetarian friends and they loved it. I halved the recipe and now I am kicking myself that I didn't make two. Left out the peas and put in a layer of fresh spinach as well as some goat cheese. Excellent.

Love this torte - I've made it a few times and I also 1/2 the ingredients and make just one torte, no problem.

This was fabulous--I used regular button mushrooms. It was time-consuming, but very much worth it! I rarely have the opportunity to eat 2 tortes, however. Has anyone frozen this? Pre- or post-baking?

YUM! This was a lovely dish that earned its place at the table with its prsentation alone. I did a bit more to spice it up, adding roasted garlic to the potatoe mixture and a parmesan cheese layer after the eggplant. We loved it, and I would encourage bakers to serve it on the warm side.

Stunner - the tort looks fantastic - definetly impressed my guests. Although it is labour intensive, each of the individual steps is conducive to anyone reasonable adept in the kitchen. Flavours are good, but standard - limited my rating to three forks.

I made this as a vegetarian entree for Thanksgiving. The fact that it cooks on the bottom rack is actually a big help with fitting other things in the oven. Also, I made all the individual ingredients a little at a time over the week before. Assembly and baking were very easy, and the end result was spectacular! I think the smoked cheese flavor was crucial to this dish, so I'd recommend against substituting regular gouda. Smoked mozzarella would work, however. I'm just kicking myself that I halved the recipe and only made one torte. I should have made two and kept one in the freezer!

A great make ahead dish. I served for a baby shower and everyone loved it. I halved the recipe, put it together one day in advance and like other reviewers omitted the peas. I couldn't find smoked gouda so I used regular gouda, and added extra garlic to the potatoes.

Very savory recipe and a fine choice to have with marinated flank speak or lamb. Depending on your supplier of puff pastry, (La Farine in Berkeley is the best!), I suggest pre-cooking the bottom and sides of the pastry for 15 min and let cool before layering the other ingredients. If pared with meat, this would easily serve 12.

Made this for a dinner party and it came out great (and it looked almost as good as the picture too!) I would definitely make it again, but would try to do some of the work the night before.

I made this dish for a casual New Year's Eve supper, served with a fresh, port and red onion marmalade. I baked the garlic (and lots of it) before blending it with the potatos. Rave reviews and great to make ahead.

I made this for a bridal shower. One torte was enough for 10 women. It was a wonderful dish...impressive taste and presentation and a huge hit. Everyone asked for the recipe! I plan to make again for a couples baby shower luncheon. I served it with a mixed green salad with breaded goat cheese rounds.

Very pretty to look at but I wasn't wowed by the taste..maybe too many layers..sometimes simplicity is best.. and the raw garlic in the potatoes was awful, even though they got further cooking in the oven.

This is the best recipe I've made so far from epicurious! Just fantastic. I made it for both vegetarians and carnivores and all loved it. I like it served hot out of the oven, instead of letting it cool as the recipe suggests. A winner.

Labor intesive but extremely easy to execute. Next time I will make the vegetable fillings the day before and assemble and bake the day of.

Despite what the reviews already said, I didnt belive the tortes would come out looking exactly as it does in the picture...but they did!!! It was totally worth it after the long hours of chopping, roasting, and sauteing. I would definitely make the tortes again--its a great, filling dish for vegetarians

This is a really nice dish to serve to vegetarians who always complain about having no real main dish options. The presentation is beautiful, and it's really filling!!! I recommend preparing the layers in advance, because they are all time consuming. As far as the food mill question, I made the potatoes without one (I just boiled them and mashed them up, so they were like lumpy mashed potatoes), and they tasted just fine. Next time I make it, however, I will use a sharper cheese than gouda.

Can I make this without a food mill? Will the potato texture be okay?

I made this for a brunch buffet and it was very successful. I cut the recipe in half to make one torte, and it served 10 in a buffet with other items. My only disappointment was that I opted to serve it at room temperature, and I think the pastry crust would have been better if it had been served sooner (therefore, warmer); the top crust was nice and flaky-crisp, but the bottom had a chance to get a little soggy. Also, I prepared the individual vegetable items a day ahead, which really helps, because this recipe is quite time-consuming.

I made this as a vegetable accompaniment to a Rack of Lamb recipe thinking it would look & taste great which it did. We made 1 torte cutting it into 8 servings and each serving was way too big as an accompaniment. We don't typically eat vegetarian meals and I wanted to try the recipe. Next time I will make it for a buffet and cut smaller wedges &/or, if I do the accompanyiment again I will cut the torte into small squares. It was a great presentation with wonderful flavor. It was definitely time consuming. My husband didn't like it being served room temperature.

Finally, a stunning vegetarian main course!!! I cut the recipe in half and only made one torte, and it fed 5 people plentifully with more than a third left over. It was a bit time consuming, but the preparations were all very simple. And it turned out exactly like the picture! Will definitely make it again for parties.
