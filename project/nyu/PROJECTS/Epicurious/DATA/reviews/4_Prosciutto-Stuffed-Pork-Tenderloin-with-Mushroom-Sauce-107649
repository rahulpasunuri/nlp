Similar thoughts as others - thicken the sauce with cream or cornstarch. I used shiitakes too. Bu t- the stuffing is just too darn boring. Maybe add some of the shrooms in the stuffing. Too dry, too crumbly, simply does not add anything. On the upside - the meat was done well, the prosciutto was fun, and the sauce was pretty good. Needs tweaking - but worth the effort to modify.

I made this last night for dinner and was disappointed with the stuffing. Followed the suggestions of others and reduced the salt content in light of the large amount of prosciutto but the bread crumbs, thought nicely seasoned, were very dry and crumbly. I thickened the sauce with a bit (2 Tbsp) of cornstarch with good results. Would make again with a much more robust stuffing.

absolutely delicious...followed recipe for tenderloin exactly, but added minced garlic to the rub...not too salty, a little too peppery, if anything. Cooking time perfect. Re sauce, after reading other reviews and not having low sodium broth, used wine and 1/2 broth, 1/2 water. Boiled all down for allotted time and then added about 2 T heavy cream instead of cornstarch or flour as suggested by others. Worked great! Would use even more mushrooms. Will definitely make again. Have tried other tenderloin recipes and this was by far the best...tender, juicy, tasty. Stuffing and prosciutto added a very subtle touch.

Made this for New Year's dinner. Followed the ingredients as listed. However, in the preparation I laid out the proscuitto on a board, slightly overlapping, with the bottom edges even, to match the length of the tenderloin. Placed the stuffing at the bottom edge, rolled up and tucked the edges in. Then wrapped the tenderloin pieces around it. Much easier to manage than the method described. When I cooked the mushrooms, held back some of the wine/chicken broth and mixed in some cornstarch,utes. and added for the last few minutes. Was a hit! Easy dish, but elegant - and best of all can be prepared in advance.

This is good, but I agree the rolling pork in the prociutto is cumbersome. For the mixed mushroom sauce, I did a few things differently: (1) used a mix of dried porcini (re-constituted) and cremini mushrooms; (2) added procini broth instead of chicken broth for a richer flavor;(3) added cornstarch/water to thicken; and(4) added butter + a dash of black truffle oil at the end of the cooking to heighten the sauce. Sauce was good, stuffing was interesting. Not sure if I'll go through the trouble again.

I have made this dish numerous times for both company and family dinners. It is relatively easy to prepare and looks very elegant. I agree the sauce could use some thickening however I find the small amount of stuffing is just right... I always add extra prosciutto and include fresh garlic in the rub and it adds the a nice balance of flavour. Not only does everyone love it but the recipe has now been passed onto to many more people at their request for future dinner parties to come.

One of the better recipes on here. Rubbed with dijon mustard, as recommended by some reviewers. Also, the sauce does need to be thickened. Corn starch would help. We'll try the cheese stuffing next.

I was not expecting much from this, though the recipe intrigued me as it sounded simple but elegant. As I was preparing it, I was also preparing for disappointment--it just seemed that it would probably be bland. How wonderful to be SO wrong--it was delicious, simple, healthy and somewhat sophisticated. Can't wait to try it out on dinner company!

I tried this recipe out on my boyfriend before making it for a larger dinner party. We really liked the pork, but the mushrooms weren't to our taste, so the next time I made it, I used red wine and beef broth instead of white wine and chicken broth. Everyone raved about the pork AND the mushrooms (bf and I included). This dish is so easy, and comes off as both impressive and extremely tasty. I will definitely be adding it into my cooking repertoire.

Served this for a dinner party and got good reviews. As others have noted mine turned out a little salty and I added no salt at all. Used a loin that had not been plumped up and still was way to salty. Next time I will add some type of cheese to the center and replace the priscutto with bacon. Also the sauce was not worht the effort. Was able to get it to thicken up but didnt much care for the flavor.

Always a hit. I substitute apples for the mushrooms and add Calvados (any apple brandy would work) and apple cider to the sauce - reducing the amount of chicken broth accordingly - never the wine :)

That was a huge success! I followed the recipe to the "T" until the end. I was looking at the mushroom sauce in the pan and I remembered I had a bit of Whipping Cream in the fridge (about 2/3rds Cup) so I tossed that into the sauce and let it thicken. Crazy stuff!

A great recipe -our table of 6 guests loved it and correct size - just a bite leftover. Didn't understand exactly how or why to lay the prociutto over the one tenderloin piece - of course when you fold it back over the crumb stuffing mixture it keeps it all in place as you put the other tenderloin piece overtop. A great idea for other stuffing type recipes too.

Rating: 4
This was incredible. WAY easier than it first appears in the recipe. You basically put one tenderloin on top of the other, with the stuffing inbetween, tie it up with string and bake for 45 mins (at 375). We used bacon instead of prosciutto. Then, wrapped the whole thing in a few slices of bacon too. Also used garlic in the stuffing and the rub. For the sauce you must add cornstarch or flour to thicken. We didn't use as much chicken stock as the recipe calls for, but topped it up with water which makes it less salty - just right. It's really tasty. SO GOOD!!!!

I made this dish for the first time lastnight, it seemed to be a good recepie and had an abundance of rave reviews, but I really didn't care for it. I didn't find it too salty, but I strongly dislike the taste of the cooked prosciutto which I found to be a turn-off. The pork itself with the rosemary and thyme was delicious, as was the mushroom sauce (although, that didn't thicken as I was cooking it.. I suspect there is an ingredient missing because it just evaporated). I probably won't make it again, I'd stick to plain tenderloin with a mushroom-wine sauce.

Very good. I have made this recipe a few times now and loved it everytime. Even though this recipe is good as is, the last time I made it I added a pinch of flour to the sauce to thicken it slightly which made it even better. I also added garlic to the rub and the stuffing which I will do from now on. Excellent.

Sorry, this just didn't do it for me. The family was very nice and said it was good, but when I asked if they would eat it again, the long pause kind of said it all...

Excellent! Made for Christmas Eve dinner with oven roasted green and white asparagus, oven roasted rosemary potatoes and butter baby carrots. It was great.

Did the mushroom sauce - it didn't really thicken but still liked it

I did as another reveiwer suggested and added goat cheese to the stuffing. The porkloin was tender and the stuffing very flavorful. Next time I'll skip the mushroom sauce. It doesn't really need it. My guests llooooved this dish, and it's definitely good for a dinner party.

I was being taken out by friends for my birthday and forgot, until after the tenderloin was defrosted. So I made it any way for my husband and children, ages 18, 12, and 10. They raved over it. I of course have not tried it, as there was so little left. I made 2 med. size tenderloins. My husband said that I should cancel my party and eat at home. So I will make it again. You can count on it. Although I did cook it longer then the sudjested temp. of the meat. As I still can not eat my pork until the pink is gone.

I've been experimenting with this dish for a few years now and here are some observations. 1) If you semi-cut open the tenderloin and line the prosciutto strips on the inside before tieing it back up, you create a lovely star pattern that makes for an unparalleled presentation. 2) I use a larger tenderloin (at least 1 kilo) and much more olive oil. 3) Mix Gorgonzola in w/ the prosciutto stuffing. The results are unparalleled.

This recipe won rave reviews with a large group of friends. Tenderloins are always great to prepare for larger meals. I made one addition after looking through some cookbooks.

I made this for the first time yesterday, and it was just wonderful. It took a bit longer to prepare than I realized, but it was well worth the result.

This makes an amazing and impressive dinner. I have made this many times, for intimate dinners and large dinner parties. I was once told that it looks and tastes like something straight off the cover of Bon Appetit. (I found that quite funny.) I make a little more stuffing than the recipe calls for, and add parm and garlic to it. I also add minced garlic to the rub for the meat. I usually serve it with Au Gratin Potatoes and the Oven Roasted Vegetables recipe from this site. I've never received a complaint about too much salt, but I don't put any in the rub for the meat. And I always thicken the sauce with cornstarch. Enjoy!

A great recipe and so easy. Normally I like to make the recipe as written, but for the stuffing I used pancetta as I had it on hand and processed bread crumbs, not fresh. It was still delicious! The pancetta may have cut down on the saltiness that some complained about. Also prepped this in the morning and browned the pork, refrigerated it, and then finished it in the evening. It was still expectional. A great recipe for entertaining.

I loved this! Did a bit more stuffing, also drizzled olive oil on it and salted and peppered before rolling up. Had to use sesame hamburger buns for bread crumbs, it added a richer flavor. The fresh herbs and plenty of browning in the skillet before baking seemed to be a key factor. Very French. I thought it was fabulous, great for a casual dinner with friends and kids!

I made this dish last night for myself and husband from the new BA 2004 cookbook. Was looking to make pork tenderloin and this was the only receipe in the book so I tried it. Was disappointed. Way too salty and I used very good meats and cut the salt topping dramatically.

Rating: 4
Fantastic dish. Everyone thinks it is restaurant quality!!! I have made this about 4 times. For the stuffing - I prepare it all in a food processor and I added a bit of garlic, shallots and parmesan. I actually liked some of the stuffing just rubbed all around the pork so that if the stuffing falls out a bit, it still looks great! For tying the pork, it is easiest to lay down the pieces of string, then lay the tenderloin on top of the string and then do prosciutto and stuffing. Much quicker than trying to maneuver the string under the pork after you have stuffed it. I refrigerate the stuffed pork for at least 30 mintues, since I find the stuffing stays in better. For the sauce, I just make it at the same time the pork is cooking. I am afraid the pork will get cold, and I don't like to worry about thickening time, etc. I also reduce the wine and chicken stock, and add cooked pancetta to the sauce. It adds a nice meaty, crispy flavor. Enjoy! Pretty easy in comparison with what people think of it once it is done!!

Rating: 3
This was good. The meat cooked (in my oven, anyhow) to 140 in the specified time, and was tender and juicy. I changed the stuffing around a little by finely chopping and sauteeing the mushroom stems with some garlic in rosemary butter. Added this to more chopped rosemary and some parmesean. I used red wine in the sauce and some of my homemade chicken cubes (a demi-glace sort of thing made by reducing a whole batch of stock down to about two cups, then cooling until congealed cutting into cubes and freezing-it's a godsend here where I can't buy chicken broth and don't have much freezer space). I tied this like a classic roast and roasted with the seam side down, and it stayed together well. A keeper, though I'm not a big fan of pork, usually. Nice change.

I've made this twice to rave reviews. The sauce definitely needs a thickening agent, and I successfully use cornstarch the second time.

This is a GREAT recipe for pork tenderloin! Brining the pork for a few hours is the way to go and I found that it does need an extra 10-20 minutes in the oven to reach the specified temperature before letting the meat rest. The sauce does not thicken when prepared as specified, but I enjoyed it that way. There were no leftovers with this recipe and it served 4 adults and 2 preteens amply.

I made this last Saturday for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I added parmasan cheese to the stuffing as others did. I used red wine and a beef bouillon for the sauce and thickened it with a 2 T of flour stirred into 2 T of butter. I served this with mashed potatoes, green beans, and salad. What was nice is it could be prepared in advance so you can enjoy your company which I did.

I made this for a dinner party last Saturday evening and everyone LOVED it! Excellent recipe and FULL of flavor! I brined the pork tenderloin first for a few hours. This creates just the right amount of tenderness, a fork alone can cut the meat! Also, the mushroom sauce didn't thicken, so I added a mixture of flour and water. The sauce adds a nice rich flavor to the pork! We used leftovers for sandwiches the following day! It's delicious, even when cold! Served with Roasted Potatoes with Garlic and Fresh Herbs and Broiled Asparagus (seasoned with olive oil, salt and pepper).

This was a very good recipe however I was a bit disappointed in the stuffing. I felt it needed something more. Only change I made was to add some goat cheese and it still seemed as though the dressing was bland. The SAUCE though was outstanding, even though I agree it needed thickening.

MAKE THIS RECIPE! It's a winner. Double the sauce (you can never have too much of a good thing). My boyfriend loved it when I added cheese to the stuffing once. Previous reviewers are right. The sauce does take too long to thicken. The meat will be cold by the time the sauce is ready. You can either a) mix together 1 tbs flour with 1 tbs butter into a little ball and add it to the sauce (make 2 balls if you prefer) or b) mix together 2 tsp cornstarch with 1 tbs water and add it to the sauce. The butter is creamier and better tasting, but if you're health conscious use the cornstarch.

I've made this recipe for 3 dinners so far, each time a little differently. I used fine breadcrumbs the first time. Day-old hand-torn bread is better. Be careful when you slice the pork so it doesn't fall apart. The sauce may take longer to reduce than the recipe claims. Try serving this pork with roasted beets!

Rating: 4
The instructions for stuffing and rolling was the only thing that threw me for a loop too! Basically the two tenderloins are piggy-backed on top of each other with the stuffing in between, but it doesn't stay together when slicing so you wind up with the stuffing coming away from the tenderloin. Anyone else have this problem? I wonder if making a slit lengthwise in each tenderloin and then stuffing and tying would work better? Other than that, the pork was tender, moist and delicious. The herbs add lots of great flavor, but next time I'll add some minced garlic and shallots to the stuffing mixture too. Marsala wine instead of white wine and a bit of cream would turn this sauce into a Marsala sauce which would also be nice with this dish. I found that I had to add a little cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce at the end too.

Made this for a Sunday dinner and was delighted that it turned out so well. I was only making it for two people, so I used one tenderloin, pounded it flat, and then stuffed it, rolled it, and strung it together. Additionally, I didn't have any fresh mushrooms, so I used dried (reconstituted) portabella mushrooms for the sauce, and loved the earthy flavour that they imparted. It was perfect served with a great cauliflower dish and buttermilk mashed potatoes.

Very elegant and sophisticated! The proscuitto and stuffing really makes the dish, without it it would have been a little bland. I didn't have a problem with saltiness. The pork by itself needed more salt, with the proscuitto it was just right. The combination of herbs was just fantastic! It took some time to prepare, but was well worth it. It came out looking exactly like the picture. It was a bit tricky to cut, but no major problems, it didn't fall apart. The only change I would make is to thicken the sauce, as it was rather watery. Other than that, this great for entertaining and will definetely make it into my repetiore. Next time I will try it with different kinds of mushrooms.

This is a totally fabulous recipe, and easy too. Perfect for a small dinner get together. I only wish I had a pan big enough to make two batches for a large crowd. It was defnitely one of the best dishes I've ever made, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. A little corn starch/water at the end pulls the sauce together nicely.

I modified the recipe by ploacing the bread mixture between the two tenderloins. MAke sure you cook the prosciutto side down for a crisp, strong flavor.

This was a delicious change from my usual grilled pork tenderloin. I served it with the "Sweet Potato and Parmesan Cake", Gourmet,2002 and a Romaine Lettuce salad with Gorgonzola and toasted Pine Nuts. Everyone wanted the recipe!

this was so good and so simple. took the other cooks' advice and added a little flour to the shrooms before adding the liquid.

I tried this dish for company and they swooned. I'd recommend adding sauteed onions (1 is fine) to the stuffing mixture and then giving it a few whirls in the food processor before you stuff the tenderloin. Make sure you tie the tenderloin snugly and roast it with tenderloins standing side by side instead of on top of each other and you shouldn't have any problems getting the roast to stay together when you carve it. I also recommend adding a little thickening to the sauce. I used shitake mushrooms and baby bellas and loved the flavor they imparted.

this was a so easy to prepare and the flavor was fantastic. The only different thing I did was to add about a cup of water to my pan when I put it into the oven. Easily dinner party worthy.

This was a real treat. The pork was juicy and the stuffing was tasty. It was a bit of a challenge to carve, but I just reassemled everything on the serving platter and it looked great. I added about a cup of parmesan to the stuffing and a few tablespoons of butter to the sauce to thicken it a bit. All in all a very tasty meal!

Tasty, yes, but If you are making it for company, I wasn't impressed with the presentation. If you had used one tenderloin and split it and stuffed it, maybe it would have looked nicer. This way, when you cut it, the 2 separate. Also, the sauce NEVER thickened.

Made this recipe on Christmas Eve. It was delicious, everyone gobbled it up. The sauce was a little too thin for my taste, so I added some cornstarch and a little butter to make it thicker and a bit richer. I also used crushed homemade croutons for the stuffing and it tasted yummy.

Excellent and flavorful. I added parm cheese and shallots to stuffing as another reviewer suggested. Be careful of saltiness. Mine bordered being too salty.

Didn't have twine so simply rested the pork loins on top of each other. The bottom ones were a bit rare on the inside (i.e. the top of the loin near the ham) so I separated them and roasted those at high heat briefly before reassembling. Worked fine although it did make cutting the slices a bit of a challenge. Used extra mushrooms and served the "sauce" on the side as a separate dish. Both got rave reviews.

Was delish -- I've made it twice now. I added a little grated parm and minced shallots into the stuffing and I was generous with the herb rub. The first time I made it I used a red wine in the sauce, and the last time I ommited the sauce altogether.

Yummy! The sauce was outstanding. Will make again.

THIS WAS GREAT AND EASY. I WAS A LITTLE DISSAPOINTED IN THE SAUCE--IT WASN'T SAUCEY. MY GUESTS WERE VERY IMPRESSED.

This is a great recipe and makes a wonderfull impression on guests as it emerges from the oven. I made 3, one half inch lengthwise slits on the what becomes the interior surfaces of the tenderloin in order to accomodate more stuffing. It makes it look much better than it does in the picture. And as for the suggestion about not using solution infused tenderloins,...well they don't sell those around here, and it still came out great all 3 times I have made this recipe.

Made this for Christmas Eve dinner and it was devine ! Although the directions seemed a little confusing as to how to put the two terderloins together just picture a hero sandwich and you'll be fine. Everyone loved this dish the flavors were really nice, will definately make again for a large croud.
