A Sunday morning favorite at our house! I often substitute the fresh tomato and jalapeno for a can of Rotel. It's always in the pantry and much faster than chopping up veggies in the AM. Never leave out the green onions or cilantro-you'll miss the flavor!

Since moving to Austin, I've become a bit obsessed with Migas (and Mexican Martinis, but that's another story). I would suggest substituting sweet, or even yellow onions for the green onions. I also tend to throw some garlic and a bit of oregano in. I haven't tried coriander, although it sounds like a good call... The only thing to watch out for with Migas is making sure the tomatoes are well seeded and dry, otherwise they can wreak havoc on your eggs...

I am from mexico, what i would do is fry soft corn tortillas and use those to make them crunchy, with eggs its called migas, with chicken, beans, salsa and cheese its called chilaquiles. I reommend using pico de gayo, which is chopped jalapaño, tomato and onion. from what i see the recepie does not include onion. first i put the onion then add jalapanio and then the tomato and then add the eggs and tortillas and cheese if you want. serve with refried beans and bacon on the side and green or red salsa. or you can also put some chorizo at the same time with the onion and it will taste grat or you can also put some chorizo in a pan with a little olive oil then add some refried beans and mix them instead. sorry for bad english folks

I halved this recipe for 3 servings. Omitted the salt and added extra black pepper. Made strips out of about one and one-third 8-1/2 to 9 inch flour tortillas, thus omitting the softening step for the corn tortillas. The family doesn't like jalapenos, so (for my 1/2 recipe) I substituted 1 Tbs. of chopped green chili pepper. Also used less cheese than called for, since I had sharp cheddar on hand. IT WAS WONDERBAR!!! The only changes I would make next time is to add a little bottled hot sauce (we found this dish a bit bland), and to make the tortilla strips a bit longer and wider (so they don't disintegrate quite so much). But, overall, we were very pleased with this recipe.

I recognize this recipe as a variation of "migas," which you find served in Tex-Mex restaurants in Central Texas. Instead of tortilla strips, we use crumbled tortilla chips (they soften when added to the eggs) and white onion instead of green. Much easier, and just as tasty!

I agree that this needs more jalapeno, but that is the only change to make. This is wonderful!

I pleasantly surprised my husband on Sunday morning with these wonderful eggs. I did, however, make some substitutions, only because I didn't have some specific ingredients on hand, i.e. had regular flour tortillas, so I used those - cut into strips. Used Vidalia onion rather than green onion, canned green chilies rather than jalapeno pepper and Tex Mex cheese instead of Monterey Jack. And I didn't have any coriander, so I did without. The result was excellent! Served the eggs with leftover BBQ'd steak, home fried potatoes, and thick whole wheat toast! Delightful, indeed!

This was really delicious, the flavours pleasantly fragrant rather than chilli hot which made a nice change. I made the mistake, however, of serving it as a main dish - adding just 1 extra egg - which meant it looked a little lost, and had us defrosting bread and boiling peas to make it more substantial!

This turned out great! Out here in northern Germany we can't get Monterey Jack, so I substituted Gouda cheese from Holland. Being a Texas gal and experienced jalapeno eater, I doubled the jalapenos and topped the whole thing with warmed Hot Pace salsa. Yum!

It was the perfect compliment to Bratwurst and Hash Browns! I will spice it up a bit more next time though - probably by adding some Crystal Hot Sauce.
