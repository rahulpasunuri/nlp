Wonderful! I am planning on using this technique and glaze on other vegetables. Make sure not to stir too much, or the vegetables get mashed.

I have made this a couple of times now. It is great. I follow the recipe to the letter. It's easy to make and always pleases.

Simple and delicious. I cooked the parsnips and carrots separately, as 2 pounds is a lot to fit in even the largest skillet to brown.

Candy for dinner.... This recipe is SO good and super simple. A great way to use up that last sprig of rosemary hiding in the bottom of the veggie drawer.

This was really good. I prepared it in advance and glazed it just before serving. Next time I might add more Rosemary

Tried to double this recipe for a Thanksgiving crowd - I probably should have made it in batches, as even my largest skillet didn't allow for proper caramelizing. Tasted good, though - and today I sauteed the leftovers with some garlic and shallots before combining with leftover chicken stock and half-n-half in the blender to make a lovely soup. I will make this again, but next time I'll probably finish it in the oven.

I made a few changes to the recipe which is why I'm not rating it, but I really do like this recipe and will reuse it. I cut the parsnips into coins and sliced the carrots on a diagonal so they'd cook at the same rate. This seemed easier than making sticks. I omitted the honey because the starches in parsnips and carrots turn to sugars when they cook. The veggies dried out while they cooked so I added the butter as needed during cooking, not afterward. I'm thinking they'd taste better roasted in a hot oven. They weren't as sweet as I thought they'd be, but I'm not complaining -- I'll continue making them sans honey.

When I got carrots and parsnips in a CSA this winter, I was at a bit of a loss, but the honey and rosemary were just incredible additions. This dish was simple and delicious. I wouldn't change a thing.

Solid recipe! I used butter from Cowgirl Creamery (low salt) and I added a bit of sweet potato

I love parsnips and I've had them many ways, I love the taste, texture, and smell of them when they are cooking. This was a worthwhile recipe, and I'd make it again. I think I used too much rosemary (dried), and I completely skipped the butter-it wasn't missed at all. I didn't time the cooking, just tested the pieces from time to time. Great for Easter dinner. And...I made the leftovers into a delicious simple soup with some sauteed onion (food processed w/ carrots and parsnips) and chicken broth.

OMG, so delicious! I used a greater proportion of parsnips, and used very small baby carrots. Fresh rosemary from the garden and orange blossom honey; maybe maple syrup next time instead of the honey. I may have used a little bit too much butter so I'll cut down on that next time. Next time I'll try adding shallots or onions for a little more taste. This would be great with a combination of other root veggies as well. Definitely a keeper.

no parsnips, so i used turnips. doubled everything. this was simple and awesome!

Super easy, super delicious. I made it as is, and did put the carrots in 2 minutes before the parsnips. The glaze/butter/olive oil does male this dish rich. It would be great with meat and a green salad.

This was excellent. Super easy to prepare. I used baby carrots and subsequently had to fish out the parsnips as the carrots needed a bit more time. Delicious.

Throw the parsnips in with the carrots at the same time. My poor parsnips were under cooked while the carrots starting to crumble. I only gave this 3 forks because I didn't think the effort to cut all the carrots and parsnips into long stick were worth the trouble. May try pre-prepared carrot sticks next time and just cut the parsnips myself.

Yum. The honey made it too sweet for us so I will make it without next time.

Absolutely terrific, and great to prepare beforehand and heat up at the last minutes. Skip the pancetta - you don't need it.

I don't often submit reviews, but this one inspired me to make the effort...made this last night as a test to see if it was worthy of Thanksgiving, and is it ever! Even my usually carrot-repulsed husband loved it. And honestly, I made it with plain old grocery store honey and dried rosemary and it was outstanding. The parsnips were a little bit of extra work, especially if making for a crowd, but this would probably be great with just carrots, also. Try this recipe!

Delicious without the pancetta! Though, I think I will add the pancetta for the holiday dish. Thank you Molly Stevens.

Absolutely lovely. Pan roasting makes the carrots and parsnips golden and sweet without the hasle of oven-roasting. Rosemary is the perfect fall herb to offset the sweet honey. Definite keeper.

This was fantastic! I would definitely suggest adding pancetta or bacon to this recipe, though it is still good without it. I will be making this again soon!

Although I seem to be the only person with this problem, I had a really hard time getting the parsnips cooked through- I'm sure I cut them too thick, but even with alot of extra cooking time they too crunchy. Also, as per some other reviews, I cut down on the butter and it was great.

I GOOFED! ! ! ! Instead of purchasing parsnips I accidentally bought "daikon" (well they were small and looked like parsnips.) Ta'heck...I cooked everything as per recipe and it was FANTABULOUS. The slight bitter zing of the 'daikon' complimented the smooth singing slathered in honey and rosemary carrots. I will do this recipe again and again...we ate these veggies with pasta....there went my waistline.

Very tasty and, considering how easy and quick this dish is, definitely deserves four forks!

I've never had parsnips before [and I'm going to be 50]. Made this recipe [but didn't have rosemary] and thought it was easy and delicious. Made it again later that week without the carrots and didn't even remember to add the honey. So sweet and healthy.

This cooked way faster than I expected (I almost burned it because I turned my back) and I left off the butter since they seemed pretty oily already. But it tastes good, even with a huge, old parsnip I ended up with in my CSF box this week!

This dish is amazing. We made it tonight for V-day and we will definitely make this again soon. The flavors are well balanced. So delish!!!

I used a mandoline to cut the parsnips and carrots in 1/4 inch slices. I was surprised how long it took to cook while being careful not to burn it on moderate heat and, yet get it brown. I adden the rosemary, honey and butter just before serving. It was a winner and I'll be cooking this for a long time.

This is an excellent recipe & a big hit with my husband & myself. I am not a fan of cooked carrots & had not eaten parsnips before but was very pleased with the flavor of this dish. The honey & rosemary really add to it. Next time I think I will cut back on the butter & oil to make it a little healthier.

This was an excellent recipe. Did not use the pancetta, but followed the rest of the recipe. Used orange blossom honey, of course.

I don't like cooked carrots and had never eaten a parsnip but was desparate last minute to find another veggie side for this years Christmas dinner for 26 family members. I made it without the pancetta, and followed the recipe exactly otherwise. It was delicious and the rosemary was fragrant and festive. It's the first time I've ever enjoyed cooked carrots. This recipe was declared a keeper and will be used again and again.

As previously promised, this dish made another appearance on my table. However, this time I omitted the parsnips, since I didn't have them on hand. And, same as Thanksgiving, it was a hit!

Rating: 4
I love this - you can shortcut cooking time by slicing the carrots slightly thinner than the parsnips.I didn't have pancetta on hand, and used bacon instead (sorry foodies) with great results! Instead of butter, I cooked it in the natural fats -- I will try this again the future with pancetta or with another type of smoked meat.

This was a hit at Thanksgiving. I used whole baby carrots to save on carrot prep time. However, the time saved on the carrots was spent on the parsnips. The parsnips were a pain to prepare. And they were worth the effort. The parsnips added an earthy sweet depth that contributed to making this dish extraordinary. This dish will make a regular appearance on my table! Delicious!

This is very good, but I like cooking in batches for the week, and I learned the hard way that this does not keep well for more than a couple days.

Exceptional!!! This will be a new Thanksgiving staple at our house!!! I didn't add the Rosemary since my husband isn't a big fan of it, and used Agave nectar in place of honey so that our one year old daughter could enjoy it too, and it was a huge hit! Can't rave about it enough.

This was great. It is true that the carrots take longer. Funny how I love carrots but not parsnips; next time I make this I will omit the carrots because I found myself eating only the parsnips.

Make this just as the basic instructions said...forgot the pancetta/proscuitto, but it was delicious anyway. Yum!

This is a really nice dish, and the addition of the salty ham makes it. I used some proscuitto I had, and the contrast of salty meat to sweet parsnips was just great. I wouldn't make this dish without the proscuitto/pancetta.

I have always had trouble finding recipes with parsnips - this one fits the bill. I substituted olive oil for butter and threw 1/2 of an onion in.

Outstanding! Simple honest dish that lets flavors shine through! Just be sure to cook the vegetables perfectly .. not over- or undercooked. Cook them like they were the only thing you're serving, and as if the whole meal depended on them. So good.

I really enjoyed this, although I needed to cook it a lot longer than the recipe suggested, almost twice as long. The honey glaze was just fantastic.

This was a very good updated version of the pureed dish my mother in law serves at every family meal. I didnt have the pancetta, but it was great nonetheless and I am NOT a fan of parsnips. I will make it again and may just omit the parsnips altogether. The honey and rosemary glaze is fabulous on the veggies.

An easy and delicious vegetable dish. The first time, I added the pancetta crumbles on top . . . it didn't add much. The vegetables w/ honey glaze are enough by themselves.
