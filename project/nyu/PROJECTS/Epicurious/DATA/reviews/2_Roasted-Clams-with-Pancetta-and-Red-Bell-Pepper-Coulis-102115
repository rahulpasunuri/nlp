On the recommendation of another user, I came to this recipe just for the roasted red pepper coulis, to top the 'Wild Mushroom Strudel', also from Epicurious.com. It was a great idea, and tasty, although the strudel was SO good on it's own we almost didn't need it - might be great with pasta or other dish. Very easy to make, however. Oh, and we usually cut a large pepper into 4 or 5 pieces and roast - just makes for easier peeling once cooled.
