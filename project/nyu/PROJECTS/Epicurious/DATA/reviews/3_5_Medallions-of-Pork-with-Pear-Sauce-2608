Made this tonight for my family. It was very good. My husband said it is good enough for company. The sage added a nice flavor. I didn't have any white wine so used sherry. Also left the sugar our since my giner had a lot of sugar on it.

Really good. Left out sugar (thanks to many reviewers). Plated with pork on top of sauce to keep the nice crust on the pork crusty. Went comfort food & served with mac & 4 cheeses.

I only had one pear, but it was huge, and a small bottle of pear cider. Figured the cider would be sweeter than wine, so I didn't add any sugar. I did add a pinch of rubbed sage, and some pepper. Awesomegoodsauce!

Wonderful! First things first, though. Don't change the recipe beyond recognition and then post a complaint about it. You are not going to achieve the same results substituting wine for beef broth. This was VERY good and easy. Make sure to cook the pears for the full two minutes,(or more)before adding the wine and ginger. This is a definite make again. Thank you, Carmela!

Loved it! I used a pork loin that I had in the freezer and sliced it into pieces. I always keep candied ginger in my pantry - buy mine at Trader Joe's. Served this along brown rice and snow peas. Was very easy and simple - and very tasty!! Will make again for sure. And yes - I also wish people would refrain from rating a recipe poorly after they have made changes to it!! What is the point?

I made this as recommended except with pork tenderloin sliced into medallions as suggested by another reviewer. It was, as advertised, simple, quick, and delicious! I was suprised that it wasn't "saucier" but perhaps that had to do with my pears. The ginger was a great addition but cut it into small pieces or it can be overwhelming. Yum!

It is indeed fast, and very tasty. Used finely chopped fresh sage & ginger puree from a tube. Recommend pears that aren't too ripe so they'll keep their shape a bit, but even the mushy ones I used were very good

Awesome just the way it is. I have made this for company many times and it is always a big hit. Bob

Very nice -- quick yet elegant. And how fun to use the crystallized ginger! I omitted the additional sugar entirely and was very happy with the results. The dry rub and flour on the chops made them brown up beautifully crisp. Hate to say it, but think I'll try canned pears next time; they may hold up better with cooking and may keep better for leftovers.

Some friends of mine came over and made this for me on my birthday. It was such a wonderful meal that I went out the next night and bought more pork medallions to go with the left over pear sauce!

I was given a jar of my mother-in-law's home jarred pears and they were fabulous in this recipe! I use those, or canned when I run out of hers. Dropping the fresh pears gets rid of the little work there was in the first place. Really yummy and super fast!

I have been making this every fall since it was first published in Bon Appetit in the fall of 1994. I often add a little cream to the sauce.

A short prep time and a short result. I found the taste bland and boring...on to the next recipe!

Hmmm...think I'll make a variation on this for Christmas eve...a Partridge in a Pear Sauce.

We used asian pears for this. It was an extremely good meal. I'm so glad it was here for me to copy and cook!

Rating: 3
This was lovely and simple. I caramelized the pears in a little butter first, then used stem ginger and star anise in the sauce. A big hit.

It never fails to amuse me when cooks change the recipe and then give it a low rating! Stop that! This is an elegant recipe...you don't need heaps of cinnamon or marsala or parsley to umph it up...that's the beauty of it. Simple elegance. Leave it alone. Oh, having said that...I use pork tenderloin sliced on the diagonal and would give it a 5 fork rating. HA! Time to stop with the home cooking and get sophisticated. Jeesh!

While we enjoyed this recipe very much, will not only make it again for ourselves, but also for company, I must agree with the "tweakers" out there. First, if you're using crystallized ginger that has alot of sugar on it, AVOID the addition of any extra sugar. I used ginger from the Bakers Catalog which was plenty sweet. Second, I must agree with the review by A Cook 08/22/00. It certainly benefits from the addition of chopped parsley. I felt that the dish was lacking something. Next time, in addition to the sage which I rubbed into the meat, I'm going to add a bit of thyme to the pear/ginger sauce. I'm also wondering if the addition of a bit of pear schnapps at the very end might be a help. Since I don't keep that on hand, I'll probably throw in a splash of brandy instead. I, too, used flattened disks of pork tenderloin. The meat was very tender and tasty.

Do not proceed with the recipe until you have crystallized ginger. It can often be found in the bulk or baking section of the grocery store. The flavour depends on it! I added a wee bit of cinnamon to the sauce. Mine thickened in well under five minutes so keep a close eye on it. When you season with a little salt and pepper at the end.. all the flavours blend beautifully. I used flattened, sliced pork tenderloins for my recipe. mmmm mmmmm

We found the recipe to be bland and uninteresting. It smelled better than it tasted. Overall, very disapointing.

With lots of pears from my garden, this was a great recipe to try. Would rate this as Wonderful, my husband rates it the best ever recipe for pork chops. Served with oven sauted potates (delicious), peas corn and baby carrots (also delicious), and buttered cabbage. Did not think cabbage so great with this recipe. Added a soupcon of cream to the sauce to mellow it a little. Also served a home made chutney of cranberries and pears, which worked very well.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe, however my four children were not as pleased with it. The pear sauce was not as pleasing to their pallate.

This looked beautiful, and it was easy, but it was not all that flavorful. I used cinnamon instead of ginger.

Rating: 3
This was very good and I was suprised at how well it was received by the children. But, I thought it was too sweet. Maybe my pears were particularly sweet. I'll make it again, without so much sugar.

A great recipe...I am really a novice cook, and this was simple and quick to prepare. The flavor was delicious, and the pork chops were some of the most tender we've ever had. I couldn't seem to get very much syrup created in the pear sauce--perhaps I used pears that weren't quite ripe enough?

Very quick and easy meal to make. The flavors were pleasant and went well with roasted sweet potatoes and sauteed spinach.

so easy and tasty. i always keep the ingredients on hand so i can make it any time. i've served it for friends before and they thought it was a lot of work!

Rating: 3
This was GREAT, and easy! I made it with oven roasted potatoes, butternut squash and green beans and it got rave reviews from my husband, my precocious 3-yr old ("everything is so delicious") and the 1-year old who just crammed pork and pears in her mouth. Next time we'll try it w/o browning the porkchops in oil, but we'll definitely make it again.

I was pressed to prepare a last minute dinner for my fiance's manager and boneless pork loin was on special at the market, so I gave this recipe a try. Being that I am trained in the culinary arts and a personal chef and caterer by trade, the pressure was on. It was nice that I could saute the pork ahead of time and hold in the oven. I excused myself as my fiance was giving him a tour of the house and went to finish the sauce. Meanwhile I had garlic, rosemary potatoes roasting in the oven, and sauteed red cabbage braising in red wine. I plated the dinner and garnished with a sprinkling of freshly minced parsley. A beautiful, simple presentation. I received numerous compliments over a dinner that was basically "no fuss-no muss"! I would recommend to use fresh sage and I also substituted marsala in place of the white wine for that extra flavor boost. The crystallized ginger was the star in this recipe.

This was a fantastic way to cook boneless center cut pork chops without drying them out. And as we always have a few "too soft" pears on hand, it's a great way to use them up rather than feed them to the deer in the backyard (sorry, deers). It was delicious, and much mellower than pork and applesauce recipes.

Rating: 3
Excellent recipe--tasty, fast, and easy. Two caveats, however: 1) it's a little too similar to my mother's pork chops shake 'n' bake w/Mott's apple sauce to be really elegant, and 2) you _must_ garnish this dish with chopped parsley or scallions, as otherwise the presentation is just too blah in color. That said, I liked it a lot--I mixed the sage in with the flour (I used wheat) and added some powdered ginger with the flour as well, then more sage into the pear mixture. Chops stayed very juicy and good.

Rating: 3
Wonderful dish and easy to do. Everyone in the family liked it--and that's a miracle! I found I needed to cook the pork longer than the recipe called for in order to cook it through.

This is the best recipe in the world. It takes no time to make and I feel like I'm at a 5 star restaurant everytime I eat it. It's very impressive.
