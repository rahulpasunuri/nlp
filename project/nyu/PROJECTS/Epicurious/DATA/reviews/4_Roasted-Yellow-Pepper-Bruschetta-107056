I spread fresh goat cheese on the ciabatta as I had no asiago, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and they were delicious - a big hit!

I used fresh mozzarella instead of the asiago because that's what I had, and forgot the Parmesan. Delicious! My family loves bruschetta and this was a great variation. Incidentally, we grilled the bread outside, but did the peppers on the stove, but I think you could do the whole thing inside and it would still be terrific.

I have made this for all occasions. It is a excellent recipe. Do not change a thing. There are so many flavors.

Delicious! I made a few changes...added one clove of fresh, minced garlic. I left out both cheeses which eliminated the step of having to heat the bruschetta. Since I was bringing this to a picnic, I toasted the bread ahead of time and simply assembled the dish and served it a room temp at the picnic. Everyone loved it! I will definitely make this again and add it to my list of go-to recipes.

I thought these were just OK, especially for all the work they entailed. Made Epicurious's Onion Puffs at the same time and they were a much bigger hit -- and a LOT easier.

I served this for a light Saturday evening dinner. To spare myself the smell of burning peppers, I roasted the peppers outside on the barbecue; and I broiled (on low) the bread and cheese/pepper mixture. Other than using grated Asaigo cheese, I followed the recipe's ingredients list exactly. The results were excellent. My husband loved the little toasts and asked to have them again the following weekend.

Let me first say that I rarely give anything 4 forks, but I think that this deserves it. This is a fantastic bruschetta for when you're tired of the plain old tomato kind. My family loved this, and when I brought out a few more (I used a baguette so there were more, smaller portions),my family went, "What! There's more!?!?" and then almost fought over them. I used the stove to blacken the peppers because I had a tart in the oven, and I have to say that I think that using the broiler is far safer and way less messy. My family has demanded that I bring this to our 'appetizer Christmas' next year. Overall, I think that this dish is delicious, and it's so pretty that it looks impressive, too.

I like this a lot, served it with cocktails. Do the vegetables in a fine dice if you're using it on small bread slices as a canape. And use a slotted spoon to add the tomato mixture so it doesn't get soggy.

Tripled recipe for a party. Chopped peppers and added them to grated asiago and parm. Spooned on toasts and heated. Then added tomato mixture and served. I am not a roasted pepper fan so and I thought they were alright. SOme people at the party said they were great.

Thought I couldn't go wrong with these ingredients. But, unfortunately, this recipe didn't do a whole lot for me. Maybe adding some garlic would give it some zing?

Love this recipe. Guests enjoyed it - including the kids. Tastes best right out of the oven.

my boyfriend and i made this for a tapas party for our 4 parents. it was quite simple to prepare and his difficult to impress parents and mine loved this (his mother even asked me for the recipe). it was the one thing we made that was eaten entirely. we made the peppers in advance and assembled it during the party, which was no problem. we also used a really good asiago fresco (soft) which added quite a bit of flavor.

An excellent appetizer--can also be served as a light dinner, which is how we enjoyed it!

thanks for the tip on blackening the peppers amherst! this was great, the roasted yellow pepper and asiago are wonderful together. hearty pieces of country bread are definitely a must, i used 1/2" slices of french bread and while the flavors were delicious they were a bit difficult to handle.

We absolutely loved this bruschetta. Everyone devoured them. Forgot to sprinkle the parmesan cheese on afterwards, and they still tasted great.

This was the best bruschetta ever. My guests raved about it. The flavours were wonderful. I did make one small change. I fried up some shiitake mushrooms in butter and added to the roasted peppers. It added a bit more complexity to the yellow pepper layer. It also does pay to buy the best asiago you can. It makes all the difference in the world. Yummy!

This is a great appetizer dish. It's very easy to prepare ahead of time. I buy a baguette, and slice it into pieces. The easiest way to roast red peppers is as follows: 1. Preheat your broiler to 530 degrees F. 2. Line a cookie sheet with silver foil. 3. Cover the silver foil with a sheet of parchment paper. 4. Cut up your pepper (any color works) into 4ths. Remove all pith. Place on cookie sheet. Press down on curved pieces to better flatten them. Flattened pieces turn black more easily. 5. Place under broiler for 18 minutes. If you miss your timer, they can broil up to 21 minutes. 6. After the peppers have broiled, slide the peppers and parchment paper into a paper in plastic bag. Set the bag on a rack to cool. 7. Allow the peppers to cool, then remove the blackend skin.

I used red peppers instead of yellow, and didn't have the parmesan. It still was delicious, got gobbled up, and I got a couple requests for the recipe.

don't substitue the asiago cheese - it's a key ingrediant

This was one of three bruschetta we served as the antipasto course for our Italian Christmas feast. This was the favorite of all but one guest. It's a bit fussy to make, but worth the effort.

This is a great recipe. I followed the directions as is. I made it on a hazy, hot and humid New England summer night and it was perfect.I served it as the entree. I will make again as an appetizer in the winter months. It is terrific.

yum! my friends deemed this the best bruschetta they'd ever had. i used pepper asiago and added plenty more fresh pepper before baking, and it was great. everything can be prepared ahead of time, then assembled and baked just before serving.

This is amazing!!! Use as great side dish for a wonderful filet of Beef or Tuna or Swordfish. Mouthwatering!!! ( For those of us who don't need a 7 course meal to be wonderfully satisfied.) Can't have a meal without a touch of garlic.

Absolutely wonderful! Discovered this recipe when I was looking for something to make for a dinner party. This dish was a huge success. We enjoyed it so much, I made it again the next day for us to enjoy (and not have to share with guests). It is definitely worth the effort of all the steps - don't skip one!

This is such a yummy recipe, unbelievable how good yellow peppers taste roasted with Asiago cheese. YUM. I preferred it without the tomato topping!

Made this for a recent family gathering. It got rave reviews and was gobbled up incredibly fast. I added a couple of anaheim chilis in with the yellow peppers - gave it a little extra kick. Would definitely make this again, and again.
