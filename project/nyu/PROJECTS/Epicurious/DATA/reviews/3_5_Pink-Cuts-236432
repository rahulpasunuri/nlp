You have to be kidding! Where is the rest of this recipe???? How do you get from a slab of cake to 20 small tea cakes?

This recipe sounded really good but didn't deliver. The pastry cream was delicious and would have doubled it for the cake. It can definatley be used w/something else. The tasty icing was pretty gloppy and remained too wet.
