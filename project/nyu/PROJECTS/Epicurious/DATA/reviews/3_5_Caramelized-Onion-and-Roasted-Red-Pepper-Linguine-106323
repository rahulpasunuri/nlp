Simple and delicious - I used what I had at home, so ended up swapping the chicken broth for some red wine and water and omitting the fennel seeds - that made it a bit tangy, so I sprinkled some ground red pepper to balance the flavor out.

This was a wonderful dish. I roasted 3 peppers one red and 2 yellow. I caramelized the onion, then I sauteed almost 2 cups of mushrooms, quickly until they were caramelized and added about a tbsp of balsamic vinegar over, then quickly sauteed about 1/2 a bag of spinach. I also added about another 1/2 c of chicken broth and another tbsp of balsamic. This was a sure hit, flavor was wonderful with all the veggies and the balsamic, a nice change for pasta.

Agree: roast your own pepper, and make sure to caramelize those onions- yes, takes awhile. Fennel seeds are great. I'm not sure why this is classified as a "side"- it's a meal, easily, and a satisfying one with a glass of wine!

Substituted white wine for Chicken stock. No sense in killing Polly to make this dish. Also don't used jarred peppers. Roast your own over mesquite. mmmm. Also, add a little hot pepper, to balance the sweet flavors of the peppers and onions.

I used chopped sundried tomatoes, added sesame and used much less chicken broth. It was wonderful but not quite perfect. Really quick and looks harder than it is too!

I made this for a small dinner party. It was great. I grilled one red pepper rather than using jarred. It would have been better with two or possibly three. Other than that, it was great. We definitely will be having it again.

I didn't find this bland at all--it was a perfect complement to the pesto crusted chicken breast recipe. Yummy!

This is an acceptable alternative to tomato-based pasta recipes but nothing exemplary. My onion-loving husband actually requested that I cut back on the onions next time. The fennel adds an interesting flavor. Overall, this dish is easy and uses basic ingredients, so I'm sure we'll make it again.

good base recipe, great when improvised on.I doubled the recipe. used vidalia onions and carmelized until very brown{key}.roasted yellow, green and red peppers. I sauted cremini mushrooms,green onions, and five cloves of garlic in a seperate pan with the fennel seeds then added to onions I tossed in a bag of flat leaf spinach at the end with more vinegar and some of the parmesan. used real parmesan reggiano.I left overnight to blend , and tossed with al dente penne pasta.

Wonderful recipe as a side dish or, with grilled chicken breasts, a nice main course. Not sure how Tampa found this bland -- maybe missed something? The combination of the roasted peppers, onions and balsamic flavors were amazing. A definite keeper.

I own a small catering company. A while back I was looking for a side dish that had great flavor and was not the usual rice pilaf or potatoes. THIS IS IT! I have made it several times and always recieve rave reviews. I even made is substituting the peppers for sun dried tomatoes (client didn't like peppers) and it worked out very well. I usually add a bit of butter just before serving that really enhances the flavor!

If you know how to cook honest food well with quality ingredients, this is sublime. I cut the recipe in half. Always roast my own red peppers: This time put two in the oven at 475, turning a few times, for half an hour. Into a brown paper bag to steam, then peeled, seeded, and cut them into strips. Yes, carmelize your onions for significantly longer than 20 minutes over medium heat. I didn't even have fennel seed; didn't miss it! The sweet succulence of the onions and peppers with sufficient seasoning and enough parmesan made this to die for. I served with some pounded boneless chicken breasts stuffed with leftover homemade pesto (didn't use the recipe on this site), which I baked in chicken broth and white wine.

This recipe was a big disappointment. The name makes it sound much better than what it really is. It is actually quite bland.

I love this recipe. Like others, I cook the onions MUCH longer than the recipe calls for (since I don't think it's possible to truly carmelize 1.5 pounds of onions in 20 minutes). Will try adding the balsamic vinegar during the last five minutes as Nina suggested. I've made this dish at least five times, and it's always delicious. Am making it tonight as well. Simple to make, good flavors. Highly recommend.

My wife and I loved this. Sauce has a very deep flavor, the fennel seeds are an excellent touch. Almost makes it taste like there's crumbled sausage in there. A big hit, will make again.

My husband and I loved it and I will make it and the pesto chicken again. I used a jar of fire-roasted red and yellow peppers from Trader Joe's. The color and the taste was amazing. I wonder if the reader who didn't like the jarred peppers used marinated ones by mistake. My carmelized onions (slightly over-cooked) had a nice smokey flavor that went with the fire-roasted peppers. A little Merlot added depth to the sauce.

Rating: 3
Very tasty dish. I had an extra red pepper in the fridge that I added to the onions up front. It seems you could go entirely that direction instead of using the peppers in the jar. You could cut back the recipe some if using as a side for four. Very good, will make again!

I just made this dish and I am extremely pleased with the results. I used a jar of Piquillo Roasted Peppers from Spain, available at Spanish markets. I added salt to the onions at the outset and cooked the onions longer than 20 min., until they were darkly carmelized. I also added the balsamic vinegar to the onions during the last 5 min. of cooking so the flavor would blend into the onions, adding the chicken broth and fennel last. Will have this tomorrow with the Chicken Pesto recipe on this site. Recommend.

I wouln't bother making this dish unless you can use fresh roasted red peppers; forget the jarred stuff. If you don't like fennel flavor, you might want to look for another recipe; the fennel seeds really are necessary to give this any distinction. I used the sauce with fresh linguine and thought it was declicious.

This pasta was excellent. I didn't deviate from the recipe except for adding mushrooms shortly after adding the red peppers. Use this as a side for the pesto-crusted chicken breasts. Oh, and fennel rocks!

This pasta was okay- a thing to remember is not to skimp on the onions or roasted red peppers since they are the main bulk of this recipe. I added a bit of parmesan cheese on top of it before serving and it was good- it seemed though a bit bland and thats why I wont waste my time making it again.

I thought this turned out great--despite my hesitation with the fennel seeds. I make pasta dishes a good bit and sometimes get bored with the same variations....this was a nice change. I did add some mushrooms (for my husband) and it absorbed the flavors nicely. I also used angel hair, which was fine.

I made this for dinner last night. Very nice taste, different from the kind of pasta sauces we usually make. We used a combination of freshly grated italian chesses and coarse-ground pepper on top of each serving. This dish is full of flavor. It's worth preparing even if it'as just to try it.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I used Vidalia sweet onions and it really made a difference. I also added a little Port Wine to the sauce. For cheese I grated Fresh Asiago and Parmesean. I will definitely make this again!

The fennel in this dish was somewhat overpowering so next time I would start with 1/4 tbsp. The dish tasted much better the next day, less fennely and not-enough-stuffy.

You know, it's kind of annoying to see someone complain about the recipe when they didn't follow the directions. Fennel is one of the most important ingredients of this dish, so if you forgot to buy it, don't blame the recipe, blame yourself. Or just don't rate it. I really liked this pasta - easy, tasy, and even my kids liked it.

Rating: 2
I was really disappointed in the results considering all the great reviews. I forgot to buy fennel seeds but otherwise followed the recipe closely. I found it very very bland, with too much pasta and not enough "stuff." To try to jazz it up I added cayenne pepper, extra vinegar, and finally a bag of small shrimp and some Old Bay. Nothing really helped, and it was hardly touched at a family reunion. It went in the trash after the reunion was over.

I love finding recipes like this that lend themselves to whatever is on hand. My experience is that if it's in my house, I probably like it. If not, then I probably don't. In this case, we are not bell pepper fans, roasted or otherwise, so I left them out. I also added about 1/2 cup crumbled gorgonzola with the parmesan at the end. It created a really different pasta dish that was still quick and easy to prepare. I'll make this again.

Rating: 3
This dish is so good! I altered it slightly by roasting my own peppers and topping it with grilled chicken sausage and chicken breast to make it a main course. The fennel is a must! I was worried it would be too overpowering, but it really adds just the right complexity to the wonderful sauce! I will definitely make this one again!

This was a nice change of pace from "normal" pasta dishes -- but -- maybe I am just not that crazy about bottled red peppers -- the flavor of them seemed to overwhelm the overall taste of the dish. it was good but wouldn't need to make it again.

My family loved this recipe. I roasted 2 red peppers, and really carmelized the onions. I also fried some mild italian sausage that had fennel in it. In the sauce I added 1/4 C of white wine. We will be making this again.

Very delicious. I roasted red bell peppers instead of purchasing the jar variety. I was able to finish roasting, sweating, peeling and slicing the peppers while the onions carmelized. Afterwards, I added the juices from the bell peppers to the sauce which I thought added a lot. I thought the fennel was an odd addition at first but used it anyway and I found it really added a subtle flavor that I felt it really made the recipe special. I added about 1/4 c. of wine to the broth which added a richer quality to the sauce. I think the 4 serving is inaccurate and it could easlily make six entrees. Next time I make this I will add yellow and orange peppers and serve with grilled sausages.

My husband loved this recipe, I thought it was okay. I eliminated the fennel seeds because neither of us care for them, so maybe that is why this recipe just seemed so-so to me. I am going to try it again but add sliced black olives instead of the fennel seeds to give it a little flavor boost (any other suggestions?). I caramelized the onions longer than the recipe calls for so they were "good and caramelized", I didn't really care about the color. I served it on spinach linguine so the brownish color that other reviewers were concerned about looked delicious on this pasta.

Made this dish EXACTLY as the recipe says. It was delicious, even better for lunch the next day. The onions did not turn the dish "brown"...but I was careful not to let them burn while carmalizing them. I will definitely make this again.

I made this without the fennel seeds and thought it was fantastic. Lots of rich flavor so it was very satisfying. Everyone liked it and asked for me to make it again soon. I like the idea of using wine instead of the broth. I think I'll try it that way next time.

I really like the idea of a no cream, non-tomato based pasta dish. However, this one is a miss. The caramelized onions did lend an overall brownish colour to the dish and the fennel seeds were overpowering at times. There are far prettier and tastier pastas out there.

So simple yet classy.

A very nice alternative to meat and/or tomato sauces for pasta. It was easy to make the carmelized onions give it a pleasant sweet flavor. I wonder if the cook who complained about the brown color might have over browned the onions. I believe it is best if they have a golden color not dark brown.

THIS WAS A WINNER WITH MY KIDS. WE TOSSED THE PARMESEAN, AND THEN ADDED MORE AS NEEDED INDIVIDUALLY. BE SURE TO USE FRESHLY GRATED PARMESEAN AND NOT THE CHEAP KIND.... IT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE. THIS IS A GREAT REHEATABLE... HEAT IN HOT OIL IN SKILLET...MAKES IT CRISPY!

It was so easy to make - even my mother-in-law liked it (she is finicky about food). My husband kept saying this is a keeper. Next time, I will not use a non-stick frying pan to caramelise the onions. The onions just don't caramelise as well as say in a cast iron or regular pan.
