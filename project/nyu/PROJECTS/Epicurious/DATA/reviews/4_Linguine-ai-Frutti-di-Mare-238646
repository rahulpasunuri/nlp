Gotta love 8/9/2011 `knaptyme' review: "...don't like seafood, so didn't use it..." Frutti di mare = "fruit of the sea". Perhaps mac-n-cheese could be make with kudzu and armadillo...

Loved it!!! Our local fine Italian restaurant has this dish on the menu and I had hoped to make a knockoff for dinner the other night. I was a little put off by the simplicity of the recipe at first (there had to be more to it for it to taste like Carmine's) but gave it a shot. I added 1/2 onion and sauteed it for a minute or two before adding the garlic (which I doubled and highly recommend), and followed the rest of the recipe as printed. Be aware that the shellfish will release a lot of liquid into the sauce so the 3/4 cup tomato sauce will make enough! The sauce is sweet and can be made more savory with some aromatics and perhaps a bay leaf or two and some extra pepper.

An easy recipe to adapt. Doubled the garlic. Sauteed green pepper & onion. I used a can of crushed tomatoes. Added fresh chopped tarragon and some grated parmesan to the sauce. I had a can of baby clams that I drained and added with a lb of shelled shrimp and 1/2 lb small bay scallops. Served over fresh linguine with warm crusty bread and white wine. I garnished with some more chopped tarragon instead of the parsley.

I followed the recipe as directed, however I added fresh Mahi Mahi. It was excellent. My wife said it was the best meal that I ever made.

This was. Very good made exactly except for omitting seafood we didn't like so doesn't impact my rating we will make again and again

I made this for mother's day for my family (8 adults) and everyone really liked it. I added thinly sliced red pepper and onion, as suggested by another reviewer, and served over fresh pasta and with toasted baguette on the side. Due to the number of guests, I doubled the original recipe and found that it took quite a bit longer for everything to cook (almost 30 minutes in the pot). Delicious, healthy meal for seafood lovers.

The sauce is refreshingly light, but does sweeten considerably due to the seafood. I did not double the sauce, as I think the idea is to let the pasta and seafood stand out - not drown. Great for people who love sweet sauces - too bad for me that I'm not one of them.

Easy & delicious! The seafood creates a wonderful sauce with the garlic, red pepper flakes, tomatoes (I used fresh) & wine. A recipe to "make your own" depending on what your fishmonger has fresh. I'll definitely make this again.

Wow! This is one of the best meals I have ever made!! I followed the recipe exactly, though I did use whole wheat pasta. All the flavors, textures, and colors married perfectly. I will be making this again!

Easy and flavorful light Italian recipe. The sweetness of the smallest freshest clams and extremely fresh mussels will enhance this dish. If not available, I would urge you to substitute more shrimp and calamari, both of which can be frozen. For a change, I skipped the wine and just used water, although next time I'll try some bottled clam juice. I used a frozen marinara sauce and added 3 peeled and cored plum tomatoes, in order to improve consistency and freshness. Also suggest doubling the garlic.Used 1/2 package of pasta - 8 oz. Result was restaurant quality, light Italian meal which will feed 6 and took under an hour.

This recipe is so simple, yet so delicious!! I added more shrimp and scallops (same amount of clams) since I left out the mussels and calamari. I wish I'd added even more shrimp - I would rather have had less linguine and more seafood - but that's for next time. I did not, as some reviewers suggest, double the sauce (although I did use a little more wine). At least for me, doubling the sauce would have made it too heavy - this way, every noodle was coated, but not dripping. Very light and yummy!

I left out the calamari and clams. I used a large can of tomato sauce so that I had plenty. It was greeted with rave reviews. I am definitely going to make this again and again. Simple ingredients. Really fast to make. I served with bread that I spread with butter and mozarella and toasted to crisp in the oven. It made it really yummy with the sauce to dip in.

This recipe is delicious, easy and inexpensive ... but you come off as deceivingly fancy! Great for a date night. My fiancé was impressed when he came home and saw me slicing calamari - but really it was nothing. Add extra red pepper flakes for some kick.

Excellent recipe and very easy to make. Fortunately I doubled the recipe for our four, because we could easily have finished the whole thing. I added a thinly sliced red pepper and and small onion at the end of the garlic stage, and added about a 12 ounce piece of cod, cut into 1" pieces. I also used fresh pasta, bought at our local market (Adams Fairacre Farms).

This turned out so yummy! I did however leave the mussels and calamari out and added more clams and scallops and shrimp to make up for it. My husband raved over this dish and insisted I serve it to friends for dinner and they loved it too!

recipe is average to below average. the sauce is way too plain. i added additional garlic and fresh thyme but it was still watery and boring. it was, however, quick, easy, and relatively healthy.

Very good as is. I will substitute fresh tomato chopped for the tomato sauce next time.

This was delicious. I added red & yellow bell peppers and turned out very good. Doesn't taste like a lowfat recipe

Forgot the most important part - I doubled the sauce part of the recipe (tomato sauce & wine) - that's a must especially if you have leftovers!

This recipe is AWESOME and so easy. Did it with just shrimp (no clams, mussels or calamari) and added fresh tomato. Can't wait to make it again.

This was so easy to make and it didn't mind the minor adjustments I made. I used some chicken stock and white wine vinegar (out of white wine) and used shrimp, clams, and scallops and added some chopped up spinach. Finished it off by using spinach fettucine. So light and flavorfull!

This is an easy, yet delicious recipe. The proportions are just right. It turned out light, yet flavorful.
