Good but, needed more bacon. I also recommend serving with sweet and spicy Jalapeno syrup!

Liked it, didn't love it. I'll keep trying recipes.

Good everyday recipe. Served as a Breakfast for Dinner Meal. A little dry--would be careful how long you cook. Otherwise, very tasty--kids enjoyed.

This is a great recipe. I made it for my two year old son, who likes Eggo waffles in the morning. I figured with the corn, this would be a good way to sneak in his vegetables!!! I made a whole batch, and froze most of it. Then I just pop the pieces in the toaster in the morning. Just like the purchased kind, only healthier and better tasting!!!

These were quite good, yet unusual. I'd like to try them as a side dish at dinner, perhaps with chicken.
