i used sunflower oil and added a tbsp of good sherry. Very tasty.

Ok, on the second batch, I think I figured it out: - Do not use olive oil. Too bitter. I used grapeseed and it made all the difference. The oil is mild and doesn't get in the way at all - great choice. - To my palate, it's not enough lemon juice or vinegar. I followed the recipe, but then at the very end when seasoning, I added a bit more of both and it gave it more tang. - The secret missing ingredient is sugar. Added maybe 3/4 tsp at the very end, blended well, and voila - yum.

Came out great on the first try. Really nice emulsion, and after eating store-bought for so many years, it reminds you how good making your own can be. Couple things I did that I will correct on the next batch: 1) I used 100% olive oil. Should have known, but it came out a touch too bitter. Next time I'll use maybe 2/3rds canola or sunflower. I added a bit of sugar to cut down the bitter, which is probably a good addition regardless (in small quantity). 2) In my intial taste test, I thought it needed more lemon, so I added more. And probably made it too lemony. I should have added a bit more cider vinegar instead. Finally, I also added some garlic powder to taste, which made it really yum. Great recipe, and easy to tinker with, as long as you see that you're getting the basic emulsion right.

I doubled the recipe to have mayo for the week. It turned out super liquidy, but upon reading the review that said to whisk your liquid mayo into a little more dijon (I added another yolk also) tablespoon by tablespoonful, it set up perfectly and I ended up with a lot of really great mayo. I'm sure that I just added my oil too quickly initially.

Fantastic!!! I have an electric whisk so it made the job really easy. I used 50% olive oil & 50% canola, cider vinegar. It was outstanding!! Just a hint of olive oil flavor. For those of you concerned with inflammation, because of the oils used, it is anti- inflammatory as opposed to soybean oil based dressings which cause inflammation. It's a keeper!!

I loved this recipe. Changes: I put my egg in lukewarm water for 10-15 minutes, to raise the temp. I didn't have any plain dijon, so I added 1 tsp regular and 1/4tsp Dijon with grains. I used the white-wine vinegar (though I think I'd have preffered cider... didn't have any though) and only added 1tsp lemon juice. I skipped out on the pepper, dusted with paprika, and added maybe 1tsp less oil than called for. I found the olive oil flavour too strong, even with 1/2 olive, 1/2 safflower & sunflower seed oil. The key to keeping mayo together is the freshness of the egg. Mine was laid thismorning, and I didn't have anissue. The older the egg, the more difficult it'll be to keep it together.

Good basic recipe. If, like me, your mayonnaise often fails to thicken, try this: Warm a mixing bowl with hot water and dry. Add a teaspoon of dijon mustard, and whisk in one tablespoon of failed-mayo at a time, until incorporated.

Meant to add that I made it with Sunflower oil, not olive oil.

Tastes very good. I tried to make it with the Cuisinart and then with a hand blender and it remained a liquid. Only way this worked was to make it by hand. Worth the effort, though. I've tried several mayonnaise recipes and this is the best I've tried.

First of all, I'm a BIG truffle fan. I just used this recipe, and threw in about 1-2 tbsp. black truffle olive oil (with vegetable oil)and black truffle salt. It's the best mayonnaise, and the best turkey, ham, and cheese sandwich I've ever had! Great recipe!

I was making my special recipe for tuna fish sandwiches this evening when I realized I had no mayonnaise. I decided to try this recipe on the fly. Well, it turned out pretty good. I did not let the eggs cool to room temp.completely. I doubled the recipe, and I used safflower oil. I also added paprika, extra salt, and a teaspoon of white wine. I used cider vinegar too. I used a turkey baster to add the oil drop by drop, then in a stream- as called for. It turned out perfect! All in all, my kids at the thought of no Hellmans were miffed, but on trying the mayo, I got rave reviews, and will certainly make it again. Who knows, maybe I will add a hot pepper next time!

I've never made mayonnaise before, so this seemed like food magic! I'm not a huge mayonnaise fan, and the homemade version didn't entirely win me over, but I'm glad I tried it.

I made the aioli (sp?) version of this recipe that was in the magazine. It was very good the first day, but by the next, it had started to separate a little. When I tried to re-wisk it, that just made matters worse. It turned into liquid. Any thoughts on why that may have happened?

This recipe was bad and way too liquid. I have tried other mayonnaise recipes before and the consistency for this one seems wrongs. Maybe there is something with the proportions.

tried it with extra virgin olive oil. BAD. IDEA. next batch i used grapeseed oil on account of the fact that i didn't have any vegetable oil. it was alright. next time i'll try veg. oil.

I can't stand the prepared mayo you get at the grocery store, so I always make my own for recipes that require it. It's super easy if you have an emersion blender and a tall jar. Just add in all ingredients and blend away. Voila! Mayo in minutes. And it's fabulous spread on the outside of a grilled cheese sandwich right before grilling. The oil eliminates the need for butter in the pan, and the emulsion of egg yolk creates a wonderful golden crispy crust.

A good standard easy mayonnaise - I added a tsp of Dijon mustard for a little tang, can also be stretched with yogurt for a lower-cal version.
