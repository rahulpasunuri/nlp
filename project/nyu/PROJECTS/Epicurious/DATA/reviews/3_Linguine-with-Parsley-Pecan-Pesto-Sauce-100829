I had a bunch of parsley to use and this recipe was simple and easy. I substituted half of the pecans with pumpkin seeds to round out the flavor. I topped the dish with grilled shrimp topped with diced roasted red pepper. It was good, but I have to say that basil pesto is still my favorite!

This was just OK. We had a lot of parsley in the garden, and this was a good recipe for it. Unfortunately, the pasta/pesto mix was really dry. We should have read the previous reviewer's comment about saving some pasta water.

Simple, tasty, elegant. But missing the extra something for the 4 fork award. Added seared scallops for a complete meal, was delicious with the relatively light sauce. Keep that pasta water! You'll need atleast a cup to soften the pesto.

Really delicious. The first time my partner made it, I didn't even realize there was no garlic in it. A wonderful marriage of flavors--we make it often on busy nights, and it always satisfies.

I served this dish to two vegetarian friends for an easy casual dinner. I liked that most of the dish could be made before hand so I had more time to visit with my guests. The pesto tasted great in the bowl but once it was on the pasta the subtle flavors of pecan and cheese were somewhat lost. If I were to make it again I might remove some of the cheese from the pesto and serve it on top.
