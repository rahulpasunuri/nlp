it's a good thing that this recipe use microwave instead of other. it ease me. but, i change the butter to salted butter and reduce the broth to half of it so i don't need to use salt and pepper in this dish. i made this dish twice today and somehow i feel healthier because of little salt

Can't rate this recipe, as I haven't made it from this particular recipe. However, I have made one by Daniel Bouloud, and it is fantastic. Sauteed thinly sliced onions until carmalized, mix in 1/8 inch sliced potatoes, add seasoning and then add chicken broth and braise for about 35 mins with a parchment cover, then remove the parchment and continue until browned about another 10 mins.

emeril's version is infinitely better because it uses caramelized onions. this one difference in ingredient preparation results in a fantastic, non-dairy alternative to the standard potatoes au gratin

I can't believe they even suggested using a microwave for this recipe.

Made this as an accompaniment to rib roast. I only have one oven, and I didn't have the oven space, the time, or a compatible oven temperature to bake a potato dish along with the roast, so I decided to risk microwaving my potatoes. Because I like a milder onion flavor, I chopped a medium, sweet-yellow onion and sautéed it in two tablespoons of salted butter. Sliced two large russet potatoes into 1/8" slices, using my food processor. Followed remainder of the recipe to the letter. It took exactly 10 minutes to microwave this simple, but tasty potato casserole (five to six servings). If you want your potatoes browned, I'd suggest putting the potato dish under the broiler for a few minutes before serving. This dish is so fast and easy to make, I'll likely use it for weekday as well as holiday meals.

Fabulous: so easy and very delicious. Nice to have a microwave recipe that tastes soo good. I used individual ramekins and when served topped with a dollop of sour cream and chives. Well done! I will save this recipe and use often.

This is a quick preparation of one of my favorite potato recipes. Great with roasted and grilled meats.
