This was great,but I brined the game hens in 1 cup kosher salt, 1/2 cup of sugar, mixed into 2.5 quarts of water for up to 3 hours.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and served it with a carrot and bell pepper salad. It was delicious - rich and satisfying but still quite delicate. I didn't use the cilantro and didn't miss it although I did use whole cumin seeds instead of ground which gave a stronger flavour. Next time I cook it I will use more lemon zest - at least twice as much. Very good.

Excellent and easy. Use whatever herbs you want with the butter. Just watch your roasting time--you want this chicken moist. Check the leg joint just as you would a regular chicken to check for doneness.

This recipe produced a very flavorful dish. The only fresh herb I had was Italian parsley so I used it in place of the cilantro. I seasoned the cavity with salt and pepper and filled it with a slice of lemon, a scallion and parsley. It looked, smelled and tasted very good.

A very tasty dish. I mixed crushed garlic clove in with butter and lemon instead of cumin, we all enjoyed this with roast pots. and veg. for Sunday lunch.
