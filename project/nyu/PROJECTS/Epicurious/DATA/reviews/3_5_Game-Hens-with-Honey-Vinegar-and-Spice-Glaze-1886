I wanted a recipe to go with my nice bottle of Pinot Noir. This sounded great but not quite what I wanted. So, I added ground cloves, tsp. of chopped shallot, 1/8 tsp. fresh ginger and a pinch of grated orange peel. I boiled it for about 8 minutes. I then stuffed the cavity with two sprigs of thyme, half of a cinnamon stick, a sliver of onion and a small orange peel. Served with wild rice and pan seared zucchini. Excellent!!

Yum! I tried this tonight and downsized to a dinner for 2 and divided the glaze in half. Needless to say we had an excess of glaze, but I just served it as a dipping sauce for our hens and snap peas (I reboiled it since I had basted raw meat with it). I might up the vinegar or just add a splash at the end for brightness next time. Also, I added a few whole cloves and used a whole star annise since I didn't have ground. It worked out really well. Nice crisp skin!

I have been making this recipe since it came out in 1992 as well. I have also used the glaze when roasting a whole chicken. It is always a crowd pleaser and makes a wonderfull presentation when ringed by the Catalan Spinach

I have been making this recipe since it was printed in 1992 and it is always a crowd pleaser. Over the years I have changed a few things though. Since we each eat half a hen, I generally cut the game hens in half and bake them as pieces. Also, I often don't have Sherry wine vinegar in the house, so I substitute 1/4c. red wine vinegar and 1/4c. Sherry, and it is still wonderful.

Very tasty! This dish is easy to make and always turns out well. Great for dinner parties and holidays. I found 55 minutes is not enough cooking time and usually cook it an extra 15 minutes on 450. I have made it twice and plan on making it again!

I make this dish often. Have served it for holiday dinners and for smaller dinner parties. Always gets rave reviews. Needs to cook a little longer than recipe states to get crispy skin.

This dish had something missing. The cinnamon was a little overpowering, and the hens would have been better if they had been a bit crispier on the outside. All in all, my husband and dinner guests felt it was marginal at best, and not worth doing again.

Easy, different, delicious. I'd make it again any time over chicken, and for company I'd do the game hens again. The flavors mingle together in a really unexpected and pleasant way.

Very tasty. We put some of the pan drippings into the leftover glaze and reheated the glaze until it bubbled and thickened again. We served the hens on top of couscous and drizzled the glaze over the hens.

I loved the flavor of the glaze and used the leftover mixture (I only used 2 birds) on some grilled chicken later. Nice mix of ssweet,sour and spice.

The game hens turned out very crispy yet moist.
