Very pretty and colorful to see, but bland to taste. Needed a better dressing. Took the advice of other reviewers and waited to add the bacon, but it still quickly got soggy. Just so-so.

I used 1 yellow and 1 orange pepper and the dish was as beautiful and it is delicious - even veggie haters will eat this one.

Delicious & easy to make. My kids loved it as well as everyone else on our picnic.

A simple but very nice side dish. The contrast of colors were beautiful. I used both red, and yellow peppers. A common occurence when making a marinated salad is that the dressing tastes diluted before serving. To avoid this you can either choose to halve the amount of oil, or double the other ingredients. I also added some crushed garlic, a pinch of salt, and freshly ground black pepper. When possible, allow the salad to marinate overnight. I added the bacon and let it's flavor permeate throughout while marinating. Didn't mind it not being crispy. A little sliced red onion would be a nice addition.

This is a great recipe. I put the bacon in a separate dish so those who wanted could add their own. This also kept the bacon crisp. It's a great picnic salad.

I prepared this dish alomg with the cucumber pineapple salad for the 4th. I added a splash of balsamic vinegar along with the red wine vinegar and found it more to my liking, and used fresh oregano. I would serve the bacon on the side. it got a little soggy by the time we ate .
