Eh... I have to agree that this is less than memorable. It's a bit annoying considering the amount of chopping, time, and nice veggies used. (I could have made any number of other standby quickies instead.) I'm not sure what to do to liven this up - maybe another fresh herb? The beans just get lost and the onion/garlic/pepper/chili mixture is a bit lifeless, even with more seasoning than is indicated in the recipe and the flavorful Reggiano cheese. Seemed like such a nice idea - maybe some over roasted cherry tomatoes would add what's missing.

Blah, boring, no character.

Pretty boring. I would add extra veggies as some other reviewers suggested or double the onions and peppers - and maybe caramelize the onions in balsamic.

Awesome. Made a couple changes that I feel made it even better. Replaced water with veggie broth. Halved the pepper strips to make them easier to eat. Added four handfulls baby spinach to skillet along with the beans to the pepper mixture about two minutes before peppers were tender. I substituted red pepper flakes for the chile. Doubled the garlic. Forgot to reserve cooking water, and it was still fine. I was a little bit more generous with the cheese when serving. Added all of parsely while tossing at the end. Great meal. Can't wait to eat the rest for lunch tomorrow, I added more beans to the leftovers. Even new hubby, who usually thinks he hasn't eaten a thing if he doesn't eat meat, loved this. I am vegetarian, so I hope he gets used to this more often. He said he didn't even miss it.

I substituted roasted peppers for fresh. Next time I would bake a garlic bulb and use the baked carmelized garlic in this dish.

This is one of my all-time favorite pasta dishes. I love to make this and enjoy the left-overs, when the flavors have had a chance to meld. But it's amazing fresh, too!

This is a wonderful dish. Serve with a leafy salad, garlic bread, and a chilled white wine. I made it last summer when I invited two friends over for dinner...a few months ago they moved in together! So besides being yummy, it must be lucky in love as well! :)

I replaced all of the water with stock and substituted red pepper flakes for the jalapeno. Delicious and great for lunch the next day too.

The only change I made was to use chicken broth instead of the 1st 3/4 cup of water. Used half red and half yellow peppers, just for the color. Good peppers are essential, and this is the month for that. Everyone loved this, even the friend who doesn't care much for pasta.

I too used fresh basil as my supply of parsley was very low. I think this dish would have turned out as well--or even better--if I'd used half the amount of pasta. With full amount of pasta, some other additions are needed IMO---perhaps chicken or shrimp.

This is a "fine" although not "great" dish as is. Using the whole amount of jalepeno is a must (as is extra garlic and fresh flat leaf parsley). It's probably true that any stock (veggie/chicken) will liven it up. Carmelizing onions always makes the house smell great! I don't think there's a need to peel/roast the red peppers; if so, use bottled for sure. This was very easy to make and satisfying.

This is one of the best pasta dishes I have ever made. Couple changes though: use chicken broth instead of water for more flavor. The fresh parsley is a must. I used crushed red pepper instead of jalapeno. Roast the red pepper beforehand and remove the skin. Also, after you have combined the peppers, onion, garlic, and broth, add the beans too - it gives them a nice flavor instead of right out of the can into the pasta. Oh, and add more garlic and some fresh thyme!

Just came from table, having made and served this dish to a pasta non-fan. We both liked it a lot. Didn't have the parsley, so I used fresh basil, which was fine. I was scared of 2 tsp of jalapeno, so I used only 1+. Next time I'll go the whole route. More garlic is a good idea. I used one large Vidalia and one medium regular yellow onion. It takes at least 25 minutes to get the onions right. Partner had seconds and thirds, and asked me to make it again, soon. This is a keeper, although I agree that you can customize it without danger.

I would definitely spice it up the next time I make it. Just as a variation I added some basil in it. Overall it was a good pasta dish.

The dish was pretty bland. We added Andouille suasage....which was really the saving grace of the dish.

Really, really good. We will remove seeds from the jalapeno next time to keep the heat down ( I think we just had a really hot pepper this time) Freshly grated cheese is a must, although we used jarred roasted red peppers very successfully. Whole wheat pasta is a great addition if you can find it. A great dish for vegetarian entertaining!!
