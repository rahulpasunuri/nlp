At first taste, a bit horseradish-y for me, but when you put these on burgers, hot dogs, in chicken salad, etc., they are spectacular. They have a great bite; I just wish they kept longer!

An easier, alternative recipe, authentically Danish: Mix in a bowl: white vinegar, half as much vinegar as water and about 2/3 as much sugar as vinegar (or a little more - it should be more sour than sweet though). Cut cucumber in thin slices, and when the sugar is mostly dissolved, dump it into the vinegar solution. Let stand for a few hours. The cucumber will drain a lot of water, so drain most of the liquid before serving, but keep it for storing in, in the refrigerator.

Quite good! Reminds me of something my grandma used to make.
