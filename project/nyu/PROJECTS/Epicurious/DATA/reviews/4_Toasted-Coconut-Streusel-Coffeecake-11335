In good conscience, I can't give this any forks. make exactly as directed. Looked beautiful, but...a lot of work for an awful cake. Too sweet, dry, did not like the texture. A waste of ingredients and my time!

I made this for a work breakfast and everyone raved and there was none left after the meeting was over. Highly recomend. I did not make it in the angle food cake pan, I used a 9X13 dish and my cook time was 55 minutes.

This is a easy to make and yummy coffeecake, the toasted coconut gives it a very nice crunch. Be careful to watch the coconut as it is toasting - it will burn easily.

easy, quick, simple, & delicious describes this cake for me! I always bake it in bundt pan & it makes a beautiful presentation! It is very forgiving of recipe "tweaking" as some of the other reviewers have indicated. I use the light sour cream & only ONE stick REAL BUTTER in the batter (saves calories) the cake is a wee bit drier but still holds together well. My hubby gets a slice in his lunch each day for dessert!

It was OK, but I've had better coffee cake. I made extra streusel, which is always good, but even so, I wouldn't make it again. That said, the cake was moist and the coconut flavour was excellent and an interesting twist.

This would have been really good if I had cooked it about 15 more minutes. It looked beautiful but was still gooey in the middle after an hour and 15 minutes. The part that WAS cooked wasn't sweet enough -- I'd use a little more brown sugar (1/3 cup more). The coconut was really nice and I'll definitely try it again.

This was one of the best coffeecake's that I have had in a while. I didn't have a tube pan, so I used a 9x13 pan and it turned out great (and in less time) I made this for a brunch I had and it was gone in no time. I had several requests for the recipe as well.

I made a few changes and the result was fantastic!I used one stick plus two tablespoons butter, lowfat yogurt instead of sour cream, two cups white and one cup whole wheat pastry flour, used nutmeg instead of cinnamon in the streusel, and placed sliced fresh apricots above the batter and below the streusel. A fantastic weekend brunch item!

I was looking for a coffeecake to make quickly for surprise guests - I was out of a few ingredients and it still came out great! Subbed in white sugar for brown (dk brn for streusal)- had no coconut, used a 13 X 9 pan (only 35-45 min!)...(Also just added sour cream and flour all at once and was fine!)...was moist and delicious! Can't wait to try it with coconut! Toasted almonds and almond extract would be nice additions next time too

This cake is great. I will probably use dark brown sugar for the streusel next time. Very interesting taste of coconut in a coffee cake. You don't see it too much. I baked mine in a bundt pan and I only cooked it for an hour, so watch your time. You may want to put a confectioner's sugar glaze on about 1 hour after taking it out of the oven, if you have to have frosting on it. It would probably be okay for a dessert with the frosting on it.
