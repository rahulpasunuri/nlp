Made this recipe without the filling. Doughnut hole sized, then bite sized, served first, rolled in cinammon sugar, then with caramel, cream cheese frosting, and apricot dipping sauces. Killer! Making for Thanksgiving dinner!

I tried twice to make this recipe and was not happy with the out comes. First attempt, I didn't get the proofing of the dough correct. Second attempt, I proofed the dough in the oven (turned off) with the pan of boiling water. The dough puffed up but I am not sure it was as high as it should have been. They just didn't seem as light as the picture looks. Baking is something I am trying to get better at so if there are any tips, send 'em my way! The Vanilla Cream Filling is DELICIOUS though!

TOTALLY AMAZING. Tried 4 other recipes for doughnuts which were tasteless.This was not a lot of work (I thought), came together beautifully and tasted awesome. I used jelly filling instead of pastry cream.I used a plastic cake decorator with a long tube to insert the jam.
