Great recipe. Much yummier than canned dough. I doubled it with no issues. I also used nitrate free mini-dogs so you could almost say that it was healthy!

'lil smokies, crescent rolls cut to fit, top with 1 stick butter and 1 package crumbled bleu cheese or gorgonzola melted together on the stove first. Unbelievable.

Well, doggone it, I didn't have the time to go buy Pillsbury's crescent rolls or processed cheese, so this healthy-ish recipe (and my aged New York cheddar) had to do. This was really yummy! I added flax seed because I didn't have wheat germ, and used 1/2 cup of wheat flour instead of all white. They turned out very yummy. Best - and healthiest - pigs-in-a-blanket our family has ever had!

This was a simple recipe and a hit with everyone. I added season salt instead of regular table salt. I also used sour cream instead of the yogurt. Once they were baked I added a glaze made out of spicy mustard and honey (equal parts) and baked for another 5 min to set. Next time I will make with kiebalsa sausage for an even tastier version!!!

This recipe is not a lot of work--It's fun! Every time I make them they get eaten right up. All the chi-chi hors d'ourvres are loved but these are pounced on.

Why would you review this recipe if, in fact, you made a completely different one with instant ingredients? That's a totally different item you're then talking about.

I'm with Tampa..I made Pigs in the Blanket for Thanksgiving using Crescent rolls...very easy and everyone loved them..no need to make your own dough for this finger food.

much to my surprise my daughter adored making, serving, and eating these and requests we do it again and again. definitely the kosher dogs helped -- using yogurt and wheat flour made them marginally healthier too...

It DOES seem like a lot of work! To go with Tampa's recipe below, it's also really tasty if you add a sliver of sharp Cheddar cheese right behind the weiner.

I haven't made this recipe, but it seems like a lot of work. I have a much easier recipe that has great results. Take a can of crescent roll dough and a package of fully cooked cocktail weiners or little smokies, pat dry the weiners in a paper towel. With a pizza cutter, cut each crescent roll lengthwise into 3 thinner triangles. Place the weiner at the base of the triangle and roll. Cook according to the crescent roll directions. Serve with barbecue sauce, ketchup, or honey mustard.

This recipe is good for most folks. My family would only eat beef hot dogs so I would buy all-beef or kosher franks and call the dish "Cows in a Comforter." It gave it a different twist and everyone, including their friends, was well satisfied.

OK, the truth is everybody LOVES pigs in blankets---kids and adults grab them by the handful. This recipe is a cut above what you can get pre-packaged and frozen... just be sure to make a ton of them!

Julienne Mild Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses and wrap them with the frankfurters, and serve them with coarse ground spicy mustard. Your guests will love it.
