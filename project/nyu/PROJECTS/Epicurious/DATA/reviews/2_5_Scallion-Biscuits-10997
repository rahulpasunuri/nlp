These were just ok. I would have liked a little more scallion flavour.

Actually somewhere between 2-3 forks. Lovely tender biscuits and with a nice consistancy, however, we found them to be a bit too sweet. Look forward to using this recipe for strawberry shortcakes (without the scallions of course!). Will also experiment with reducing the sugar for the scallion version. A nice biscuit recipe worth hanging onto.

These biscuits are delicious. I tripled the recipe and made smaller biscuits but didn't triple the baking powder. Perhaps the next time I will but the scallions in the biscuits instead of on top.
