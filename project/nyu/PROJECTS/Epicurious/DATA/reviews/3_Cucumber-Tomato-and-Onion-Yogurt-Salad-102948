To me the difficult part of the recipe is cooking the mustard seeds without burning the oil. Perhaps my skillet is of poor quality. Anyway the burned oil made it taste dirty. I would like to taste this dish in a good Indian restaurant; if it tastes the same then I just don't like it.

First of all this is not the south indian pachadi. Pachadi is completely different. This a nice yogurt salad to go with rice and your spicy Indian dishes. I would never serve this alone.

Very bland recipe. Disappointing. It tasted like sweet yogurt, without any zest or real taste. I'm glad I wasn't cooking for guests! Would not make again. :-(

Delicious. I used only half an onion, diced the cucumber and tomato (1/4 inch), and chilled it for about 6 hours. It was a great, cool "raita"- type side dish to the spicy Indian romantic meal I cooked last week. It was also great the next day with a bowl of white rice.

Really nice salad. I just wished I'd soaked the onions after chopping them--I thought the onion flavor was just a tad too strong. Also, be sure not to skimp on the cilantro if you use it.
