I finally got around to making this and was sorry I had put it off. It was a total treat. The sweetness, richness, and bitterness didn't so much blend as mingle so every sip was a delightful surprise.

Excellent! I never thought beer & ice cream could go together - so, much better than expected.

This was very bitter and no one enjoyed it in my family. We like all the ingrediants but together they were not a hit.

The chocolate syrup alone is 4 forks. Just used Guiness and I liked the bitter roast flavor mirrored in the chocolate and coffee. My husband also rates this with 4 forks and his statement was "How can you go wrong...it's a new way to drink". This will be made on a regular basis. Much better than a rootbeer float or a chocolate milkshake.

Fantastic!!! Used Garrison Martello Stout. Made recipe exactly as stated. Results outstanding! We did a taste testing tonight and can't wait to serve this to friends.
