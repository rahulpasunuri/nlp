Very good. I made two batches and it seemed a little time consuming but worth it. The first batch was perfect but the second was soggy in the center, and there was no fixing it. Make sure you have a long enough implement to check the center!

I have been researching early American dishes to wow my family on Thanksgiving, so I thought I would give this one a try. It was near close to impossible to find a rack to fit in any of my stock pots, so I ended up buying a trivet and this strange 'can colander', thinking either one would do the trick. I should have used the trivet because 30 minutes into steaming the bread, the whole can fell to one side in the pot. I then tried to put the can back, but ended up losing my grip on the tongs, and the whole thing fell into the boiling water! Undeterred, I scooped out the floating bread and put the trivet in the bottom instead. The rest cooked up fine, but, after all that work, I was left unimpressed. This dish is a very authentic representation of how the early settlers used Native American foods, but it was rather bland. Very healthy, but bland.

I made this for Thanksgiving, however it was much too heavy and dense for the meal. Turkey, dressing, mashed potatoes, gravy, etc. are already quite heavy; a light, fluffy bread would better offset the richness of those foods. Out of 12 guests, nobody ate it and I wound up throwing it away. I'm tellin' ya, it weighed a ton!!!What a disappointment.

Delicious! Very moist, even when made one day ahead and reheated (follow their directions). It's not as sweet as you might think, but the honey gives it a great flavor. Definitely fill the can 2/3-3/4 full, or opt for a larger can (I used the 29 oz pumpkin can the second time I made it.

This bread is moist and delicious. I plan on making it again for next Thanksgiving. I used 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour, instead of 1/2 c. white and 1/2 c whole wheat. I baked the bread in 24 ounce empty bean cans. When filling cans with batter, only fill 2/3 full!!! Otherwise bread will pop the cover. I found that 2/3 full allows bread to expand exactly to top of can, leaving a nice level top.
