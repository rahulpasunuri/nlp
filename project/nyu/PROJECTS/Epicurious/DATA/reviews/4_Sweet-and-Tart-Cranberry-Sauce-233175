This was the hit of both our Thanksgiving and Christmas parties. I followed the previous advice and added one portion sweet to 1/2 tart. It is the perfect relish! This is now in my permanent collection.

The recipe was incredibly easy to make and at the end of our Thanksgiving party, there was very little left. However, I ended up modifying the recipe as follows: I made the cooked portion of the sauce 2 days ahead; on the day of I made the fresh portion and found it to be incredibly tart so I ended up mixing only HALF the fresh portion with all the cooked portion. I had tried using equal parts of both cranberries and found it to be too tart. The modified recipe was a huge hit and I plan on making it for many Thanksgivings to come.

Easy to make and has a wonderful texture that appeals to both those that prefer relish as well as those who prefer sauce.
