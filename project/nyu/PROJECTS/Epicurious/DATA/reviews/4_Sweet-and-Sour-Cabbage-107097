Scrumptious! I agree that it should be made exactly as instructed, glad I resisted my usual urge to tinker with the recipe! Great hot, or cold as leftovers. Confession: I did use green cabbage. I will be making this again for sure.

I remember this dish fondly from visits to Gustav's, and after many searches was so glad to be able to make this at home! I made it exactly as the recipe said with perfect results. What gets me is when people substitute and mess with the given recipe and then give it a 2 fork rating. Make it as the recipe dictates and then give an honest opinion. Sorry, but I am not interested in your subpar substitutions and their equally unimpressive results.

Very good and easy recipe. I used a granny smith apple because that is what my husband bought. I thought it worked well in this preparation.

I'd make it again if my husband likes it. But, I did use green instead of red cabbage, and ommitted the applesauce and applejuice due to lack of said ingredients. Must add: I was just trying to use what I had on hand, so ad-libbed. To sweeten it ia bit more, I may try some juice from a can of mandarin oranges and the orange slices. But, at this point it tastes fairly decent and if one's looking for a different use for cabbage, this might be a good one to try. It is easy and fast.

I added apple cider, a granny smith apple and a little more vinegar. It was excellent. It would go well with pork chops.
