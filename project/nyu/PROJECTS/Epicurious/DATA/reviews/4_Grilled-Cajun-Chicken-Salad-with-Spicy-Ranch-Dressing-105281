Since I have been eating a more whole foods diet, I have been missing ranch quite a bit. I made this with all organic ingredients--i didn't have fresh parsley on hand so I used a 2tsp dried and 1 tbsp fresh cilantro. I also used 1/4 up mayo and 1/4 cup white mountain's bulgarian yogurt--delish! I ended up deciding to thinly slice the chicken, toss in whole wheat flour and fry up some lil' tenders in coconut oil- -served them upon a bed of lettuce with cucumbers, avocado, and a splash of sunflower seeds (next time i'll try sliced almonds)! Sooo yummmmyyy! This will become a staple fast!

Been making this for 5 years, and finally remembered to review it! This has become quite a family favorite, and we make it exactly according to recipe. I recommend no changes. Yes, the dressing is runny, but we like it. If anyone has any suggestions on how to thicken it a bit, we might welcome that. (someone I know once recommended xanthan gum?)

I was very pleasantly surprised at the amount of flavor in this rub. I used a whole bone-in chicken and only put the cayenne pepper on a few pieces b/c the rest of my family doesn't like spice. It was delicious! My kids approved too!! (Didn't make the salad)

Rating: 4
I really enjoyed this recipe. The chicken rub was delicious and definitely spicy. We doubled the seasoning and just made 6 chicken breasts. That combined with the salad dressing was perfect. Those who found it a bit too spicy used more salad dressing. In the salad dressing we ended up adding almost a tbsp more of vinegar just because we like the vinegar flavor. We served with grilled corn.

I don't know why everyone raved about this dressing; it was thin and bland. Nothing I added could bring it back to life. Never again!

Like other reviewers, I added additional cayenne pepper to the salad dressing to spice it up a bit more. Otherwise, this was a fantastic light summer meal that will become a regular for us. Loved it! Be sure not to skip the raisins...that little bit of sweetness paired with the spicyness of the chicken and dressing added some nice complexity of flavor.

For my daughter's teacher's appreciation day lunch at her elementary school, this is by far their favorite dish. It is very easy and I always have parents and teachers asking for the recipte. A must-share recipe!

This was excellent! I'll add more cayenne pepper next time (as several reviewers have stated, the buttermilk and mayo deaden the heat from the cayenne pepper so much that you can't taste it at all). I left out the pecans and raisins, since I'm allergic to the former and don't like the latter. Next time, I may add some croutons for crunch, and a non-raisin dried fruit -- blueberries or cranberries, maybe.

Rating: 3
Made this but with a few minor changes... I substituted buttermilk for plain yoghurt mixed with a bit of skimmed milk. Also didn't use the apple vinegar, but used extra lemon zest in the chicken seasoning. Also added more spice to the chicken. It was delicious! The combination of all the spicy flavours in the chicken, cooled down by the salad dressing, was great. I will definitely make this again.

Rating: 4
Four forks for the dressing, three for the chicken. My roommate kept going back for more dressing! Used non-fat buttermilk and light mayo and it was great, added some hot sauce to the dressing because it wasn't spicy enough for us. At first taste, the lemon seemed a bit overpowering, but after letting it sit for about 45 minutes, it seemed to mellow out. Def making this again!

Rating: 4
This was awesome! Followed the recipe except for the apple in the dressing - didn't have one, but will add one next time. Also did not add the raisins to the salad - don't care for them. The dressing was fantastic and the pecans really made the salad. I was leery about the grill time for the chicken, but followed it nonetheless - perfect! Can't wait to make it again.

I used this recipe strictly for the dressing. I substituted lime juice for the vinegar and served over a salad that featured salmon. Lovely for a summer night out on Lake Michigan.

Great quick and easy meal. My fiance and I loved it :) Would recommend to anyone. It was funny b/c I don't like raisens, so I didn't include them, then without having even glanced at the recipe, my fiance got up and suggested raisens for the salad! Apparently they really made the dish :)

A nice refreshing salad. I substituted dried blueberries for the raisins and added cherry tomatoes

I enjoyed this dish. As other reviewers said, the dressing is very good. The seasoning is needed for both chicken and dressing, but I thought the chicken could be more interesting prepared some other way. I liked the seasoning in the dressing and, like others mentioned, I also added additional cayenne pepper to it. The raisins were a unique little twist on the traditional spicy-chicken-ranch salad. Chow mein noodles might be fun, too.

i agree that the dressing was too thin. i added sourcream -1/4c. mixed with 1/2 tsp dry mustard. also a dash of hot sauce

I don't normally love ranch dressing, but we thought this was great. I'm not sure where the "spicy" part comes in... there is no heat whatsoever to the seasonings (despite the cayenne; then again, it's drowned in buttermilk and mayo). I added more garlic, and used Craisins for some tartness.

This salad was wonderful. The flavors were perfect for a refreshing summer meal. I did substitute the raisins for dried cranberries which added that sweet/tart taste. I served this salad for company so the cranberries gave it that splash of color. Also since I'm a cheese lover I spinkled the top of the chicken once the salad was assembled with crumbled goat cheese. This added a bold smooth flavor which went great with the seasoning, chicken and cranberries. Will definitely make again.

Oh, my God in heaven, is this ever GOOD! I'll never buy ranch dressing again, I can tell you that. I omitted the lemon peel, slightly increased the garlic and used a tablespoon of dried parsley, but otherwise followed the dressing and rest of the recipe exactly. Easy, easy to prepare the chicken (five minutes on my George Foreman grill) with incredible flavor and juiciness after only marinating in the buttermilk for 30 minutes. Spouse and I ate every bit of it between us. This will be a staple in our house from now on.

Rating: 3
Very nice combination of flavors. I didn't find this time consuming at all. I agree that the lemon is a bit excessive...might try 1/4 tsp. next time, but was still enjoyable as is. Chicken had just a touch of "spicey" taste...not overly hot. Added grape tomatoes and cucumbers and left out raisins. I think you could vary this a lot, with the basic chicken/dressing/pecan combo. (I made these ingredients one evening and have been heating chicken and having for lunch all week with no decrease in quality.) Will definitely make again.

Rating: 3
Lots of ingredients but so worth it!! The raisins were unnecessary and the lemon peel was a little overpowering. Used lowfat buttermilk and light mayo. A definite keeper.

This is a delicious salad, and it is very easy to make. The chicken is wonderful and juicy, and any leftover chicken and dressing are great sandwiches the next day! I especially liked how the sweetness of the raisins complemented the slight kick of the dressing

My family loves this recipe!! My recommendations are to substitute toasted or glazed walnuts for the pecans, and double the dressing recipe. Excellent dinner for company!

This was good. The only thing was that the dressing was soupy. Too runny. I think I will add Franks Hot Sauce to the marinating chicken. Didn't feel that it had enough kick to it. But for my first time making ranch dressing, I thought this recipe was a good one.

This was delicious. I didn't have raisins or pecans but I added halved grape tomatoes. I loved the dressing and was glad I had leftovers for lunch the next day. I broiled the chicken for 7 minutes each side. YUM!

I made this salad for a Cajun Dinner Club Theme for 10 people. I prepared the salad dressing the night before as well as prepared the chicken/seasoning the next morning. By the time we grilled the chicken, it had soaked 6 hours. This was a delicious salad and everyone enjoyed it.

This is quick, easy, and delicious. After I oven grill the chicken, I slice it and top the salad with the chicken. I did not have green onions and substituted chinese vinegar for the apple vinegar. I normally only give four stars to gourmet type dishes but this is wonderful for a weeknight dinner.

Rating: 3
Chicken was really good. Didn't have enough buttermilk for both marinating & dressing, so used the milk/vinegar suggestion for the marinade. It's winter here, so didn't grill the chicken. Cut it up in strips & sauted them. Filled green onion wraps w/the chicken, shredded lettuce & carrots (for some crunch, instead of pecans), dressing Louisiana hot sauce & some blue cheese pieces. Very tasty!

I used this recipe as a base for fried chicken strips and it was great. Just dipped the marinated chicken in bread crumbs and fried in a little bit of oil. Served with greens tossed in the dressing.

We really enjoyed this salad. The chicken was cooked perfectly. It was very juicy and it wasn't too spicy for the little ones in the house. We all loved the dressing and I thought the pecans were a nice touch. I did omit the raisins, although I think I will try them next time (we can always pick them out if we don't care for them). I served this with tomatoes and corn from the farm stand. It would also be nice with a crusty loaf of bread. An easy and delicious meal for a late summer evening.

So darned good. I made twice the spice mixture. I gave my chicken extra sit time with the spices on and then 4 hours in buttemilk. Sprinkled a bit more spice on when grilling. Had some wonderful garden tomatoes so added a "few" to the salad. I agree will be making both the dressing and chicken together and apart. yum.

This is excellent. A bit high-maintenance, but worth it. I never trust grilling chicken breasts whole, fearful they won't get done inside and we'll all get botulism. So I pare the breasts into smaller pieces. Anyone else who prefers to grill this way may wish to double the spicy rub mixture; I had to make an extra batch after rapidly using up the first. I also wondered whether the chicken would lose its spice-infused flavor when the pieces were soaking in buttermilk -- you see many a spice start floating in the mix -- but the chicken maintained its spicy flavor magnificently. This recipe makes an awful lot of chicken. I had plenty of leftovers left in the the fridge over a whole week, and as I made more and more batches of this lovely salad, the chicken's flavor only seemed to grow! I substituted currants because you get more of them for the amount (half-cup) and they just seem more interesting than raisins. Also, after the first batch, I didn't bother adding pecans; they don't add much, but contribute plenty of calories. The ranch dressing is absolutely superb. It just makes you wanna eat bowls and bowls of this stuff. Like an earlier poster, I'd consider making the dressing on its own...though (as I guess you can tell from reading this) I'll most definitely be making this complicated yet satisfying dish again soon.

My husband blurted out after his first bite - "this is GOOD". And it is. I surprised myself how much I enjoyed this. the chicken is really really good and spicy, but the dressing is very flavorful and compliments it nicely. I will make both again togehter and separate. Good for hot days.

My husband has a knack for picking out fantastic recipes on-the-fly- from Epicurious; and here is yet another WINNER! We did not have butter milk on hand but substituted 1T white vinegar for every 1C (minus 1T) of whole milk. Only got to marinate the chx for about 10 min (he was hungry!) and then grilled it. DON'T CHANGE A THING- except if you like things a little more spicy- I would add more cayenne- but you can do that once the dressing is made, to taste. This is a complex salad, I envision it at a great country-style bed and breakfast or a specialty bistro- chix was moist and tender and dressing was sooooo yummy- do not omit the nuts and raisins- the crunch and sweet are very complimentary. I could see using the dried fruit, as one reviewer suggested, or adding a garnish of fresh fruit on the plate next to the salad- very refreshing, different, and also very special- try some buttermilk biscuits or homemade bread with this one to serve to guests or your loved one!!

I knew my family wouldn't like the fruits and nuts. They said it was good though. I liked it a lot. It started to pour rain when I was making this so I browned the chicken in a pan and then finished it in the oven. Next time I will cut back on the fresh garlic in the dressing.

Excellent salad!! It is such a nice change from the ususal chicken breast salad. I usually make this in the summer but I used my grill pan indoors since it is February.(it is so cold outside) To ensure the chicken didn't dry out, I added some chicken broth towards the end of the cooking time and covered the pan. Chicken was very moist and flavorful! Dressing is great also!

The different flavors worked very well together and the pecans and raisins really added to the great variety of textures and tastes. I used lo-fat mayo and buttermilk and didn't miss a thing.

I didn't think raisins and nuts would go in this kind of salad, but WOW! Amazing salad. I used the low fat herbed ranch dressing recipe from this site (don't go overboard on the mustard powder), and sauteed the chicken instead of grilling. Really enjoyed it. I like the southwestern style salad idea suggested by another reviewer and I will probably try that next time.

Made this twice, first time as written. We enjoyed the chicken & dressing more than the salad. The second time I prepared a southwestern salad with corn, black beans, olives, tomatoes, avacado, jicima and so on. Used the chicken & dressing with it. It was a big hit. I am going to try the chicken with pasta with a tequila/red pepper sauce.

We absolutely loved this salad. As the cook, I especially loved the simplicity of its preparation. I though the dressing was unique--it had a "kick" and the lemon was refreshing. The chicken was extremely moist. We used dried blueberries, cranberries and cherries in place of the raisins.

Rating: 3
Not carefully following the recipe I made the mistake of rubbing all of the spices into three chicken breasts, and we thought the chicken was a little too intensely salty. Also, I use a different, but similar, ranch dressing recipe (also on this site); I don't think it's necessary to spice the dressing, but use plenty of parsley and scallions. I ignore the bagged salad and make the type that Paul Prudhomme recommends -- including shredded carrot and zucchini. Like to throw in some arugula, too!

This was easy, quick and yummy. I added extra cayenne to the rub and the dressing for my spice-loving husband. I added hot sauce to the buttermilk poured over the chicken (marinade). We agreed this was a winner and would definitely make it again.

Rating: 3
I thinned the dressing with a little half and half as we don't care for such a thick dressing. My husband isn't a big spicy food fan, and he liked the recipe as is, so if you like things spicier, I'd increase the spice mix as others have done. I added cherry tomatoes. Different, easy, and a good midweek meal. An extra bonus is that leftovers make a good lunch to take to work (I put the dressing and chicken in baggies to keep my lettuce crispy).

4 star chicken, 2 star salad The chicken was awesome. As suggested I doubled the amount of spices. Marinated the chicken in the buttermilk and then dipped it into the spices and rubbed to create a paste. Caused the seasonings to form a crispy coating and kept the interior moist. Plan on using this chicken for plenty of other dishes. The dressing was average but did like the addition of the raisins to the salad. A subtle twist on the common use of dried cranberries.

I have made this several times and it has become one of those favorite recipes of ours. The only thing I do differently is to double the spice recipe so as to make the chicken spicier. The cook who added potatoes, mozzarella and peppers -- I'm sorry, but YUCK!!

This was an incredible salad. With a few additions, I ended up with an incredible version of the "Pittsburgh chicken Salad". I added potato wedges, chopped roma tomatoes and topped it off with freshly shredded mozzarella and banana pepper rings. My husband and I were immediately taken back to a small italian bistro in PA where we are from originally. Delicioso!(fyi, I left out the lemon zest... just didn't feel that it was complimentary).

Rating: 4
A nice mellow Cajun, without the usual loss of flavor. Low-fat and -salt substitutions were made with no noticable quality loss. But the zest was doubled on the second try, to increase the "sweet/sour" quality. Awesome way to improve chicken, without loss of texture or juiciness. (We're definitely NOT people who like chicken!)

The rub was excellent and the buttermilk bath made the chicken very moist. I think letting it set for 5 minutes also helped seal in the juices. The dressing was also very good but a little goes a long way. I may have put a little to much on for our taste. The raisins really gave it a sweet wake up in your mouth. I'd try this again.

I have made this salad several times, mostly to rave reviews. Dressing is fantastic. I usually add sourdough cheese twists to the salad as a kind of crouton. Once, however, the dressing did not turn out that well -- I believe it was because I used very low-fat buttermilk (the only kind my supermarket had at the time). Be sure to use regular buttermilk, or at least buttermilk with a high enough fat content to give flavor and body to the dressing.

I made this for dinner last night, and it was a hit! The dressing is to die for -- it could be used on any salad. I didn't have raisins or pecans, so I substituted walnuts (toasted) and mandarin oranges. Everything else I kept the same. All of us used our bread to soak up every last bite!
