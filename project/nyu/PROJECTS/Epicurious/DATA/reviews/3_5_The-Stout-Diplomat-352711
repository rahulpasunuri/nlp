Sounds tasty but how are you supposed to squeeze 6 oz of stout into "a small, 5-ounce Delmonico glass"?

Enjoyable: brings out the dark, rich sweetness of the stout. The sherry lifts it a bit so it's not too dense. We drank this with a dark chocolate dessert (with red pepper and cinnamon notes) and it was a good, cold pairing for a warm summer evening.
