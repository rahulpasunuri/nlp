I tripled the recipe for Thanksgiving and ended up using maybe half the amount of sour cream called for--it was a ton! I also used Klausen pickle juice, and the carrots ended up really salty. Everything tasted pretty good, but not my most favorite recipe ever.

I am happy to report that this is a lovely dish! Its simple and went really well with a light lunch.
