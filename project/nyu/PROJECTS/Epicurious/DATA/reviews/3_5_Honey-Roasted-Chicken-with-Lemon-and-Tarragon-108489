I made this recipe on a weeknight for 2 people and so used 5 large chicken drumsticks instead of a whole chicken. I halved the ingredients and roasted the chicken at 475. I put it in for 20 minutes before turning and basting, then 15 before turning and basting again, and then 10 more. I also used fresh thyme instead of tarragon and a regular, light honey instead of dark. The skin was perfectly crisped, the chicken was tender and the flavors were wonderful. I served the drumsticks over pureed garlic potatoes and made extra of the herb butter (that goes under the chicken's skin) for a side of green beans - definitely a meal I will make again!

Delish! I made it with thyme instead of tarragon, but it was still incredible!

Delicious. Didn't think these flavors would work together. Skin dark and crispy, moist chicken. Loved!

I did not enjoy the taste of this recipe. The glaze had a tangy flavour which I found to be over-powering.

Great recipe-I would add chicken broth to the bottom of the pan next time to create more juice for basting and to avoid the honey from sticking to the pan.

My wife and I each thought this was a wonderful dish with real richness. I used a 4 pound chicken which provided us with leftovers for another dinner and a few scraps for lunch. The "sauce' is really good the second day.

This is a fantastic recipe. I've made it several times for my husband and for visiting parents. It is so easy and so flavorful.

personally, I can't give any kind of chicken a 4-fork rating. But if I did, I would give this 4. Great - and good for leftovers.

Unlike the Texan, we used only one lemon for both the zest and the body. We didn't miss the second lemon, though we wound up with less roasting juices than other reviewers. The butter/tarragon mixture was fun! The roasting time was spot on. Though the skin got fairly dark, it didn't burn, and kept the meat moist and tender.

Made as trial run because I'd considered giving the Christmas turkey this treatment. It was good, but not stellar. A little too sweet for my taste. Needed more zing. Found myself searching for bites with lemon zest, which were best part of the chicken.

Rating: 4
This really is a good recipe. I used more lemon zest than called for and dried taragon, but other than that... I put the chicken on a bed of veggies in my roasting pan and to prevent the skin from turning too dark, I put the lid on the roaster for the first 30 minutes at 400. After that, I took the lid off, lowered the temp to 375 and basted as directed. The skin turned a bit dark, but not burnt, and the chicken was wonderful. The veggies are to die for, soaking up the sauce and so didn't burn at all. After dinner, I took all of the skin and bones and boiled them into a stock for chicken noodle soup the next day... I know it will be equally good. My fiance loved this so much, I now am applying the same technique to the Christmas turkey.

Rating: 3
Very easy and worth messing around with the butter mix under the skin stuff and it was delicious! I found that my chicken ended up "swimming" in the basting liquid, so I drained a bit off before the second basting. I was still left over with quite a bit of liquid ... I am going to freeze it and use it as part of chicken stock in the future.

Delicious. The lemon, tarragon and honey make a great flavor combination. I made it with a large (3 lb.) chicken breast and it came out very moist!

This recipe is delicious. I HAVE made it more than once. I use White Truffle Honey instead of regular honey. It really adds to the dish and makes a FABULOUS gravy. I use a capon and it makes a wonderful friday night dinner.

The butter mixture was great and I expected a really flavorful chicken but instead the flavor was very subtle. Not enough flavor to distinguish it from a typical roasted chicken.

A big hit with my kids who don't like roasted chicken. I covered it with foil during the last 1/2 hour (yes, 1 1/2 hours total). Color and texture were perfect. I plan to try it with different herbs.

Great flavor, roasted potatoes and onions in same pot. Made a wonderful sauce for dipping bread.

Best roasted chicken I've ever had. I kept my roaster lid on for 30 min or so to prevent premature browining, then flipped whole bird over for about 15 min, then breast-side up for the rest of the cooking time. Didn't get too dark- just nice & brown. The sauce is to friggin' die for. Spoon it over the meat & whatever else is on your plate & you'll be so happy. Made once with the "Soft Polenta with Leeks" and once with white rice & veggies. Added garlic to the butter and peeled sliced garlic in cavity instead of whole head. My husband had leftover cold chicken in a tortilla wrap with fresh spinach and cream cheese the next day. Whew...yummy.

This is my new favorite roasted chicken. I use pineapple sage instead of tarragon, because I think tarragon would overpower the meal. Also, only one lemon was necessary, I just cut it up and put it in the cavity. The garlic is pointless as it doesn't cook. The chicken takes 1 1/2 hours not 1, and I baste itevery 15 minutes. Some great additions under the chicken are cut yukons, yams, carrots, parsnips for one hour, broccli, cauliflower, brussel sprouts and apples for 40-30 minutes. Make sure to add some extra oil to coat the bottom. Don't worry if the sugar darkens the vegetables, it's delishious!

I really enjoyed this dish. The chicken did darken a little bit more than I thought it would. I did used peeled garlic in the cavity. I also minced up one clove and added it to the butter mixture. (Hey, what can I say - I like garlic). The finished dish was great. Inspired by the cook who added the leftovers to her salad - I added mayo, more salt, and fresh ground pepper. It made a great chicken salad!

This was an ok roast chicken recipe. I didn't have the same problems as others mentioned regarding excess smoke from roasting at a high temperature, but my chicken did brown more than I would have liked. Also, it was not as flavorful as I was expecting it to be. If I do use this recipe again, I will peel the garlic rather than follow the directions to put unpeeled garlic into the breast cavity. Peeled garlic might better enhance the flavor.

Rating: 3
I thought this was good, but I agree that it's the bane of clean ovens. I think perhaps 425 degrees it too high. I think 375-400 is ok - you can still get some nice color on the bird at that temp. It may throw the cooking time off, but with roasting, one should throw all the rules of thumb about time per pound, etc. away, anyway. A digital insta-read thermometer is the way to go!

Good recipe for a smoky kitchen! The roasting pan was giving off clouds of smoke, even before the honey baste. After the baste, the clouds of smoke forced me to open all the windows (and it was a cool evening), turn on the fans, and see my oven coated with black, hard, caramelized honey splatters. The chicken was indeed tasy, but it carries a price! Beware.

The lemony, honey, licoracy flavors of the chicken dance on one's tastebuds. My two gluttons gobbled it up, even the one who dislikes bones in his food. I made chicken salad with the scant leftovers and it was delicious. I used pear, celery, green onions and toasted almonds. i served this chicken with parslied new potatoes and fresh green beans, and used some of the pan juices to glaze baby carrots. happy dinner.

Great recipe! The whole family loved it. Plus the aroma from the herbs and honey made the house smell wonderful. I plan to place some carrots in the pan with the chicken to soak up the pan juices and honey flavor.

Overall -- a very nice way to bake chicken. I was quite pleased with the results. I'm not sure I would make this often, however, as the intense flavors from the tarragon and lemon become almost overpowering.

Quick and easy and very good. I also served cranberry, walnut, pineapple and raspberry sauce on the side, also serve raspbeery honey mustard on the side

This is a lovely recipe. Chicken comes out nice and moist with a delicious flavor. I didn't understand the halved garlic head in the cavity, though. It was still pretty raw when the chicken was done.

This turned out so moist and tasty! I substituted thyme for the tarragon because i had none on hand. The honey was just perfect, i was afraid it would be too sweet, but not so! Very easy to make too!

I made this chicken for a dinner with some friends and it came out amazing, i had used a 7 1/2 lb chicken so i had to add some more of everything to the recipe and the cooking time was on the long side however the wait was well worth it, it smelled great, looked good and tasted amazing. This is definatly a keeper

My boyfriend enjoyed this much more than I did. Its not that I didn't like it, I felt that the tarragon and the honey was a little intense. I like both, but I think I need to make this again. I did have to use the foil tent. That helped a lot with the skin darkening; I caught it just in time! I do have a convection oven, so I wonder if I should have made some adjustments. All the juice burned at the bottom of the pan. (Good thing it was Teflon!) Should I have turned it down the entire time or just the last 20 minutes?

I used a bit less tarragon, and the bird was great. Now, for all you folks that are going a bit bonkers on the spelling issue, here is something for you to sink your teeth into. Go to the recipe for Aji-Amarillo Pineapple Salsa and read the "reviews." Rude, offensive and downright gross responses to a simple recipe left me a bit rattled. I have written Epicurious twice, but have not heard back from anyone. This is not the place for sexual or political comments. After reading these "reviews," spelling correctness doesn't seem too important.

This is a great and fairly easy recipe. I substituted lemon thyme for the tarragon, as that's what was growing in my garden and it worked great. I used the leftovers in chicken salad mixed with green apples, red onions and mayo with a dash of curry and brown sugar and put the salad in a halved papaya with some lime juice-- delicious!

Rating: 2
The only reason why I didn't like this recipe is that I found out I'm not really a big Tarragon fan. I prefer to have other herbs in the recipe. This is by far the best way I've found to cook whole chickens though (using an herb & butter rub under the skin).

Absolutely the best roast chicken that I have made. Easy to prepare. Family and friends loved it. Next time I'll make two---the leftovers are great in chicken salad with a little of the drippings stirred in along with mayonaise.

Good recipe - check out what I did - I omitted the butter and put the grated lemon, tarrogon,not as greasylowed the rest of the recipe - not as greasy and the skin wasn't burnt. For those reviewers that found it dry - try this I stood the chicken up and put a can of beer that was filled 1/2 with beer(drank the other half) and some fresh squeezed lemon juice. Chicken comes out nice and juicey (oh I did put the garlic in the cavity before placing the can in.

I thought it was great and my kids loved it. A bonus--it smelled heavenly as it roasted! It did get very brown; I recommend a foil tent over it during the last 1/2 hour or so. I was a bit concerned when the pop up timer didn't pop even though my thermometer said it was "done." The honey glaze glued the timer down; so please don't rely on the pop up thingy! May I suggest that perhaps those who had trouble with burnt tops and raw insides may not have had a fully defrosted bird?

Used split chicken breasts. Made extra and took on picnic the next day. Went well with Riesling. Perhaps the cook from Berkley AND the cook from Redwood City should split that bran muffin.

This dish is very subtle. My daughter used cornish hens instead of chicken. It was so delightful. We are thinking of trying it with a turkey.

I was so disappointed with this recipe. I cooked it an additional 20 minutes and it was still raw in the middle. I put it back in at 400 for 20 more minutes and it was ok. The breast meat was a bit dry as a result of having to cook longer. I wouldn't waste my time with this recipe. The pan burned from the honey so I couldn't serve gravy/juice with the chicken.

I loved the interesting blend of these flavors. I look forward to serving it again. Amen to the spelling changes...this site drives me crazy sometimes. Might I also add: there is a difference between "complimentary" and "complementary." When you think an ingredient works well with another, for example, you say, "The honey complements the chicken."

Rating: 4
The recipe, just as described, was great...crispy skin, juicy meat. I made it for my fiance and me, and he loved it! The additional info from other cooks was helpful, and well worth the read...but...when did this become a spelling forum? For goodness sakes, folks...who cares if some comments have spelling mistakes? This is a RECIPE REVIEW...nobody wants to hear about your pet peeves...yeesh!

This dish was a success for my dinner crowd. Amen to the "definitely" thing. That particular word and "excellent" do not have an "A" in them. Ever. My other main two pet peeves are the incorrect usage of "you're" vs. "your", and "it's" vs. "its". Thanks for listening.

I have a convection oven and used "convection roast" for this recipe, 375 degrees throughout. I roasted 20 minutes then added the honey mixture and started basting every 20 minutes. Turned out great - maybe a bit darker skin than usual, but very attractive and a lot of good pan juices that I simply defatted and reduced a bit. I didn't do any vegetables on the side but think they would have turned out fine.

The sweetness of the honey was unique, but next time I'll pass on it, since it does make the skin look burnt and unappetizing.

I doubled the recipe to make two chickens. They were a TOTAL hit at my party. Relatively easy preparation, hard to screw up. I didn't have any problems with burning, I took them out as soon as time was up. I didn't think the garlic was too strong at all. Very very moist and flavorful. I plan on doing this one again.

Rating: 1
This was the worst roasted chicken I have ever made. The honey turned the chicken black with very little flavor; mostly lemon. I roasted some vegetables - garlic, potatoes and carrots along side the chicken and they turned out carmelized and black. Very unappealing! If you insist on making this, I would suggest lining your roasting pan with foil to avoid the mess.

Rating: 3
The chicken was moist and slightly sweet and the skin crispy and deep brown. We enjoyed the lemon and tarragon flavors but the garlic was too much for us even just in the cavity. I will subsitute onion halves next time or just leave it out. The sauce was very dark but a little drizzled on the cut meat added a lot of flavor.

I made this using leg quarters instead of a whole chicken, as there are just two of us. The flavor combinations really hit the mark! I too, questioned the higher roasting temp, but based on other reviews, followed the recipe. The result is a crisp skinned, moist and flavorful chicken. Will be making this on a regular basis. Easy and delicious!

I've had excellent results roasting chicken at 425 for the first 30 minutes and then reducing the temperature to 350 for the remaining roasting time (30-45 minutes, depending upon thermometer temp.) High temperature roasting this way makes a great, crispy skin and doesn't dry out the meat.

Rating: 0
A higher temp for less time is a method many chefs use to roast small chickens, including Julia, I think.

Rating: 0
The recipe I use to roast is to preheat to 450 and then reduce heat immediately after chicken goes in to 350 for 20-25 min. per pound.

Yup! Gets the skin nice & crispy!

Is the temp (425) to roast correct ?
