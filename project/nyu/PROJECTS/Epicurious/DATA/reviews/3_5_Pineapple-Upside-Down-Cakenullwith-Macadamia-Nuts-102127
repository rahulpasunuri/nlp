I thought this was pretty good. The cake is moist and spongy, and the topping is good. I followed the recipe exactly, and I liked the ginger and orange flavors. My husband took a bite and said it tasted nothing like pineapple upside down cake. I wouldn't know, because I have never really had pineapple upside down cake before. I thought it was good, but I might not make it again because I think I will be eating the leftovers. :|

i am no baker. a good cook, but no baker. pretty easy to make, and interesting flavor. however i may omit the ginger simply because i am not a huge fan of ginger in desserts, and the ginger flavor is powerful. also baked it in a cast iron skillet and it took just shy of 45 min. slight runover but literally just a few drops. serving it as a birthday treat, hope they like!

I have made this cake many, many times, as it's my husband's favorite. I made two this year for his birthday- one to share at the office (a big hit!), and one just for him. Even big boys have trouble sharing something this good! The cake is moist and light, and the topping delicious.

This was a really nice cake...I had some fresh pineapple on hand and made it according to instructions minus the nuts (which I didn't miss at all). The cake is moist and light and the ginger and orange flavors work well.

I baked this cake for an Easter Brunch and it was excellent. Next time I make it I will try it with less ginger to bring out the flavor of the cherries and nuts. It was a big hit!

This is an excellent cake, I would not cheat on the cake mixture as original cake makes an absolutely delicous treat. Substituted real ginger and used 1/2 teas. gr. ginger and 1 tab. rum, rave reviews from family/friends and it is a beautiful addition to the table.

I cheated and used yellow cake to save time. It's still really delicious. I suppose you could still add the zest and lemon juice to give it more zing. Dried cranberries instead of cherries was acceptable.

I made both this cake and the pineapple upside down cake from Feb 2000. Both were great, couldn't recommend one over the other. Although I did have one mishap-my pan wasn't large enough, but luckily had the cake sitting on a baking sheet.

I loved the taste of this, but I didn't bake it long enough. My fault! I'm not much of a baker and didn't use a tester after an hour.

Only time consuming work was mincing the fresh ginger, took about 15 minutes to peel, chop, and squeeze 2T but since it is one of my favorite ingredients it was worth it! Otherwise, this is a great recipe with lots of new flavors combined together. From the lovely orange zest in the cake to the dried cherries and yummy macadamia nuts (and of course the distinct ginger) it is a nice variation from your standard dessert cakes. I used canned pineapple which saved time (and money) and I also found this cake to improve by day. It seems to get more dense and even more flavorful over time. Enjoy!

Thought this recipe was perfect as is. I loved the amount of ginger. Brought it for Hawaiian night at work and everybody loved it!

This recipe was absolutely splendiferous! While the amount of ingredients needed makes the task seem a bit daunting, it is actually quite simple. My friend and I had a marvelous time with this recipe. We didn't have any macadamia nuts at the time and we substituted cranberries for the dried cherries. The blend of pineapples, cranberries and that hint of orange made a heavenly combination that even my grandmother approved of. Highly recommended. This time we're going to try the recipe with the macadamia nuts.

I absolutely loved this cake, but my husband who has a really sweet tooth said it was too sweet. You can't win. I didn't separate the eggs and I mixed everything in the one bowl. Turned out great.

I made this cake for a luau at my son's school. Everyone loved it. I have already been asked to make it again. I will definitely add this to my recipe box.

I received rave reviews for this cake! I substituted pecans for the macadamias, and only used 1 tbl of ginger.

Excellent! Didn't realize until half-way through the cooking that I should have put the brown sugar in the cake pans. Turned out good anyway, but next time I'll know. Everyone raved!

I really liked the cake. As Macadamia nuts are unavailable here, I used walnuts, and because I thought it was a lot of ginger, I halved the amount.(I hadn't read the reader's review at theat time.) Plus, as buttermilk is also not available, I substituted yoghurt. Portuguese friends thought the cake was superb as well.

The cake part of this recipe turned out very nice, however the topping has way to much ginger! I might be tempted to use the cake recipe again but substitute another topping or leave out the ginger all together.

I substitued pecans in the recipe and used a jiffy cake mix (2 of them for this recipe. I also place the pineapple in the bottom of the pan and inserted marascino cherries inside each pineapple ring.I then added the pecan mix on top and around the rings, and then poured the jiffy mix on top and baked. It was a real hit!
