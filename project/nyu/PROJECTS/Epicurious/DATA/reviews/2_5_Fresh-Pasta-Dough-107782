Came out very, very soupy. I had to add too much flour and it never came out right.

the dough turned out runny like cake mix. I do not recommend using this for pasta.

I made linguine with this recipe and it was delicious. I substituted all-purpose flour for the cake flour (as per appropriate substitution rules). The only reason I gave it 3 forks instead of 4 is because the dough does have a slightly eggy taste to it (ala egg noodles) before I doused it with pesto or marinara. I'm not sure I'd want to use this recipe for an original-style fettuccine alfredo (butter and parm) because the egginess might come through too much, but it's fine with strong sauces and would be great as a kugel. I also make sweet pea-yogurt cheese ravioli with some of the dough. I froze both kinds of the pasta I made and they had a wonderful chewy-springiness upon boiling.

This was an awful soupy mess when followed as directed. After adding over 2+ cups of flour to bring it to a smooth and elastic state, it was usable. I make fresh pasta a lot and was just looking for a new recipe. This is NOT it, despite it turning out decent with all my adjustments.

This easy recipe made better fettuccini than spaghetti for this first time pasta maker. The fettuccini was soft and wonderful without being gummy

Perfect pasta, fresh is best! The pasta was indeed a little sticky at first, but I just kept working it and only adding a bit of flour to keep it from sticking. After about 8 minutes it was nice and elasticy. After resting an hour it was exactly the consistency needed to go through the machine. Usually fresh pasta cooks in about 90 seconds to 2 minutes. I had to cook this recipe about 3.5 minutes, but I was making a thicker ribbon pasta so that might be why.

Easy to make, would do it again.

I dont mean to brag or anything(since I made it) but these are the best noodles I have ever had... To the previous review, my dough was somewhat messy as well in the beginning, so I added another tsp of oil- worked it, then added a little more flour. Remember the half cup of regular flour is set aside for rolling.

I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with a sticky mess!

Perfect. Don't change anything. Super simple in the processor.
