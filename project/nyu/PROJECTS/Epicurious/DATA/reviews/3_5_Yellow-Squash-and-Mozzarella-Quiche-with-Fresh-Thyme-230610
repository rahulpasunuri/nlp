I made it exactly as written making sure to use the tart pan suggested. It was perfectly done after 35 minutes and tasted great. The only problem I had was some of the filling leaked from the bottom of the pan. Good thing I have something in my oven to catch messes.

Absolutely delicious! I was a bit concerned by some of the reviews, but it turned out beautifully. It did require about 55 minutes before setting. Also, I bumped up the salt to a full teaspoon for the filling & used about 3/4 teaspoon hot sauce. Used fresh mozzarella (as if there's another type).

Good recipe. Mine was not cooked in the middle for 35 minutes. Should cook for an hour.

Bumped up the mozzarella to about a whole cup, and split it evenly between grated smoked mozzarella and the kind from the deli that grates like cottage cheese. Result was reviewed by my crew as the best quiche--certainly vegetarian--that they'd ever had. I even copped out and used prepared roll-out crust, didn't matter, it was awesome.

I did not make this exact quiche but I did use the pie crust recipe. I initially thought: how can this really be any good? I used 2/3 shortening and 1/3 butter and it was tasty and flaky. I did fridge it for an hour but did not freeze it after molding to the pan. Didn't seem to matter. I did prebake it by only for about 15 minutes with pie weights. I did not wait for it to cool completely - it was quite warm when I put the other ingreds in and baked. We loved the crust!

Love this recipe. It is very easy and tasty. One Quiche will feed my family of 6 with leftovers.

Very very good! Threw some ham on top just before putting it into the oven. Very nice.

I used small sunburst and patty pan squash because that is what my husband is growing in the garden, I will add more squash next time. I used 4 eggs and buttermilk and basil along with the thyme. I made the crust which takes some time but it is delicious. We loved the quiche and will make it again.

Delicious! I added chopped ham & sauteed Vidalia onion and only used 3 eggs. It was great. Will definitely make this again.

I encourage you to serve this warm (heated up later is fine). At room temperature, it tastes like nothing much. Warm, it is delicious and flavorful. Highly recommend

Not my favorite quiche recipe. Unlike some of the other cooks, I found the egg to cream ratio to be alright, but I would definitely double the cheese. I subbed swiss and gruyere for mozzarella and bumped the total to 1c, but it still wasn't nearly enough. I also added leeks and mushrooms, but I think adding water chestnuts would have vastly improved it.

This dish is excellent - I made the following changes -- I used zuchinni, summer squash and mushrooms -- cooked in butter and olive oil with a few cloves of garlic, some marjaram and thyme....I only used 4 eggs and substituted plain soy milk for the cream...it turned out beatifully.

i would make this dish again (i.e. squash quiche) but with a LOT of changes. 1) the recipe is totally wrong about times required for the various stages of cooking. i had to cook the squash initially for about 3 times as long as it called for. also, it took much longer to bake. 2) the mozzarella is a bit bland -- i'd add some parmesan or perhaps replace the whole with aged gouda and more of it. 3) the-egg-to-other-stuff ratio is off. i'd try reducing the eggs to three or four. 4) more thyme. 5) more salt. 6) more pepper. on the other hand, the crust recipe is off the hook. delicious and super easy and no icky vegetable shortening. this one is a keeper.

Wow! This was my 1st time making quiche and this recipe was great. My husband liked it so much he brought leftovers to work. I did make a few substitutions but in general I think it is a good base recipe to start with. I didn't have enough fresh thyme so I added some fresh basil too, used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream and used spinich and mushrooms instead of squash. I also used a store bought whole wheat pie crust to save time. We ate it with a tossed green salad and rosemary french bread. Will definitely make again.

Thanks, NY, for the spinach suggestion -- I tried it, and it's really great. Used store-bought crust & regular pie pan (as opposed to tart pan - I always make a mess when I try that). Yum. Making it again tonight w/ squash from my neighbor's garden.

Actually more than 3 forks, this was the creamiest quiche I ever tasted. Yellow squash seemed like it would be bland so I used zucchini instead. Followed the recipe except added parmesan cheese with the mozzerella. Didn't use the dough, maybe when I have more time. Got raves from family and had no leftovers. Going to try adding spinach and mushrooms next. Most definately will make again and again.

Yum, yum... and I don't even like eggs! I used a store-bought pie crust, yellow squash and broccoli (from a friend's garden), fresh eggs (only 3), and my own fresh thyme. I didn't have the mozzarella, so I substituted parm. & feta. I also used ground cayenne pepper instead of hot sauce, and 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream (almost sounding like a different recipe, huh?!?) Anyway, it was DELICIOUS -- much better than I expected (and I couldn't really taste the eggs)!!!

Loved this... Didn't find it bland or lacking in flavor at all. Did use a little more cheese and salt then called for in the recipe. Used a store bought pie crust to save time. Wonderful...

I cut the filling down by 25% to compensate for using a frozen 9-inch deep dish Pillsbury Pet-Ritz pie crust. I did use 5 eggs, instead of 4-1/2, and only about 1/2 of the required salt. Sprinkled a light layer of canned Parmesan cheese on the bottom of the crust before adding the squash. For my smaller recipe I did use a cheese mixture of 3 oz. (by weight) of freshly grated Mozzarella and 2 Tbs. of crumbled Feta (that I had on hand). Put the quiche on a foil-lined pizza pan. I was shocked that it did not boil over!! After 35 minutes in the oven it was nice and brown, but the center was not set. So I covered it with foil, except the very center, and baked it another 10 minutes. A real YUM YUM with a green salad. Since this frozen crust is quite sweet, one could easily substitute zucchini or Mexican squash for the crookneck. I cannot imagine using butternut squash, as it would be SO sweet.

This was very rich and I thought it was pretty good, but kind of bland. My friends at brunch however, thought it was great. Next time I make it, I think I'll add a little more hot sauce and maybe a zestier cheese.

very delicious, easy to prepare. I used a prepared crust and yellow summer squash that I had on hand, very good.

Loved this quiche! Made as the recipe suggests, except for I used a store bought crust. May have also been a little generous with the mozzarella. Make sure you season the squash well with salt and pepper as you saute it, and you should get fabulous results.

We made this with a store bought crust and substituted zuchini for yellow, squash, egg beaters for eggs and 1/2 n 1/2 for heavy cream. It was a hit with my kids.

It would have been pretty good without the squash

I made this with store-bought crusts and it was delicious. My husband loved it, too. I cut up one butternut squash and it was too much for one pie crust, so I split up the squash, added two more eggs to the egg/cream mixture, nearly doubled the cheese, and made two pies.

My husband and I made this dish for dinner tonight. It was great! It was creamy and flavorful. We will definitely make this again! We can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow!

This was excellent. The crust was very crisp and buttery. One of the best quiches that I've made!

Followed recipe out of magazine, and had no problem (twice). Made without crust in glass and porcelain pie plates twice, and it came out great. A big hit with the rest of the low-carbing family.

I made this with a store bought crust, used yellow squash and zucchini, used egg beaters and it was easy. My kids liked it too. You could easily add other veges or cheeses or even ham or bacon for a different twist.

I made this recipe for some vegetarian friends. I added zucchini, onions and mushrooms. The flavor was good but the crust was soggy. In the future I'd add the cheese to the crust before the filling. This allows the fat from the cheese to "seal" the crust and prevents sogginess.

I haven't made this recipe...I am looking for a side dish for a steak dinner and thought this might be good if I made it "crustless" with zuchini/cheddar/mozzarella. Any opinions on whether you think I will get good results baking in a porcelain quiche dish without a crust?

I don't know what the previous people were reading....but, where did they get "vermicelli"??? It's nowhere in the ingredients. It does look like something I would make. One can also substitute any number of veggies for squash...like mushrooms, spinach, onions, Get creative....quiche is a great lunch, with a salad. YUM!

Sorry about the previous review. My computer did something weird and deleted a whole bunch of the filling's ingredients, and now there is no reference to vermicelli. Sorry.

This recipe as written for the web is incomplete. Where are the amounts of eggs, cream, and hot sauce for the filling? Also, what are you supposed to do with the vermicelli? Can some one help?

I didn't make my own crust, used zucchini instead of yellow squash (that was all I could find) and added sharp cheddar and Parmesan to the mozzarella cheese, and it was STILL delicious! Very creamy and rich-tasting. Great for lunch with salad and French bread. Enjoy!
