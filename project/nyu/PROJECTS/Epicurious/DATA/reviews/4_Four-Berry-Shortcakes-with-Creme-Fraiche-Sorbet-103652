the creme freche sorbet was exceptional! delicious and light. I made homemade creme freche and I used lemon extract instead of lemon juice, the flavor was like a vanilla lemon starburst candy. Very creamy and smooth.

I have really enjoyed this recipe. But I sometimes like to make it at the last minute and it rally takes 2 days becuas eofhtehcrem fraiche. But it was wonderful alternative to the tradional shortcake.

I was hunting for shortcake recipes as summer is not summer for Mr. Beatty unless he has strawberry shortcake. This was an exquisite shortcake - light and gently sweet. Parchment paper is a must though and maybe 375- 350 heat as the bottoms burned a tad and had to be cut off.
