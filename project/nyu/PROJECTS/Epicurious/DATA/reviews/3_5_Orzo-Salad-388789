I served this at a birthday party and everyone loved it. The next time I make it I will include fresh herbs. I think it was missing something; parsley/cilantro or another herb to give it the freshness it deserves. Overall great recipe.

This review is intended as "substitution" input on the recipe which looked fine enough but I wanted to vary ingredients with what i had. Used spinach leaves (less than called for in recipe so probably salad 1/3 greens 2/3 orzo), yellow/red roasted peppers (in oven), fresh tomatoes, and chopped feta along with the pine nuts and chopped red onion. I used more garlic in dressing as well. Was yumm and everyone loved! think kalamata olive would have been great but didn't have any. just an alternative... for those seeking a more mediterranean take on the original.

I rated this recipe 2 forks, I almost never give out a 4. It is good enough to cook again, but lacks punch. I used sundries tomatoes instead of peppers (my daughter doesn't like roasted papers), and it still needs something else. Black olives, maybe? Grilling the radicchio? My family ate it and we all liked it, but agreed that it needed another flavor. I used good ingredients, by the way. It would be a good potluck recipe or side dish. I'm not trying to scare anyone away from this dish, just don't be afraid to add your own touch to spice it up.

Made this for a party and got emails that night asking for the recipe. Delicious as is but I added extra lemon. Will be making this again, soon.

Easy to make and full of flavor. Great for accompanyment to any football fare, but also great for the vegetarians out there. I used feta stuffed marinated peppers and removed most of the feta, but kept a little in for extra flavor.
