This recipe came out exactly as described. It's deeply chocolatey and not too sweet with a fine light crumb that is incredibly tender and flavorful.

I am surprised by the other reviewers' comments. I thought this cake was wonderful; it's not very sweet and it's light and nice and moist. The key is using high quality chocolate for the unsweetened and cocoa powder (I used Valrhona) and I also added just a little bit of instant espresso powder to the melted chocolate mixture to bring out the flavors. I would highly recommend making this as a light dessert or to go with afternoon coffee! Made it for the office and it was gone very quickly :)

I was surprised and disappointed by this cake. When I read the first review I thought it was just another example of internet rudeness. But to my surprise, the cake really is boring. The chocolate flavor just isn't very pronounced and it doesn't satisfy the craving for a velvety, deep chocolate pound cake.

Boring. Don't bother. Nothing special about it and doesn't even taste chocolatey with all that cocoa in it.
