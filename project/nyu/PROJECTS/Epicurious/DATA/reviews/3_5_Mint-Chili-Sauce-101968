I make this mint sauce time & again to accompany grilled, butterflied leg of lamb. It's a nice alternative to the canned mint jelly and it give the lamb a kick with the hot peppers. Just stir it up an pour it over sliced grilled lamb. It's a winning crowd pleaser every time.

it's a dipping or marinade sauce, so yeah it's thin and the mint tends to float to the top, but it sticks fine. and it's quite tasty. so I fail to see the problem.

This sauce tastes delicious, but it is very thin and the mint separated. Anyone else have this problem?
