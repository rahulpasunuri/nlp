OK. But way too much cheese. I will make again, but will use less cheese and more tomato.

The combined flavors are great! I made this on a lark - I can't say why I wanted to make a dish with ingredients I don't exactly love (radicchio??), but it was delish. Savory and rich, just right for an early fall supper.

This was not bad. We ate it but I will not make it again.

Absolutely wonderful! Definitely used some smoked Gouda and you won't be disappointed.

With such a variety of ingredients, I also thought to myself...."Hmmmm how good could this be?". But we really enjoyed it. Very easy to make. It's not for the faint hearted, "Tuna casserole is my favorite dish." type of guest. But well worth trying and deciding for yourself... I'll make it again...

This pizza is awesome! Looks great as well. Sounded a bit odd to me at first, but turned out perfect! I will make this again and again. THANKS!

I agree that this is a "Radicchiously Good Pizza"! We forgot to buy tomatoes this time but it turned out just as well without them.

If the Boboli pizza crust is replaced by a homemade one, this recipe deserves four forks. The result is VERY nice--it's simple, uses fresh healthy ingredients (except for white flour), isn't boring, and has a great palette of flavors. Great to make this time of year!

This pizza is perfect. I used smoked gouda and I think that intensified the flavor even more. I didn't have time to leave the dressing on for 45 minutes but it still turned out well (I bet it will be better if I did have time!) Like the others, I didn't use Boboli, but prepared pizza dough, which did the job for a quick weekday dinner.

We call this "Radicchiously Good Pizza" ... it really is the best. We tried it once with a bit of smoked gouda mixed in as well. The smoked gouda doesn't melt as well, but it was tasty just the same.

I can't say I made my own pizza dough, but it was delicious all the same! I used green jalapeno rather than red, but I doubt it made much difference. Fresh and healthy taste, highly recommended for a quick weekday meal.

I must ditto everyone else's comments -- this was truly delicious. It did sound a little odd at first, and I thought it might not be very pleasing to the eye, but it was actually quite lovely, and the flavors were wonderful. I used a 3-year aged Gouda, and much, much less of it, so as to not drown out the flavors of the "red salad." Also, I definitely agree with using your own dough -- Ialways use my own whole wheat crust; I think it really makes a difference in any pizza.

It IS strange sounding and it is AMAZING! There might be a better pizza out there, but if so I don't know what it is. We used our own homemade dough - if you do this make sure you bake it just slightly before putting on the toppings as they are much wetter than what is usually put on a pizza.

Really Good!. This recipe sounded a litle strange on first reading but thanks to a previous reviewer I decided to give it a try. Very glad I did. Fortunately, a local farmer's market has started carrying a huge selectiion of artisan cheeses and I was able to use a full flavored Gouda instead of a bland one - if you have that chance, try it.

This pizza is delicious. I agree with the previous poster's comment about making your own dough. Also, be sure to include the jalapenos -- they really add a nice flavor.

When I first saw this recipe I thought it sounded too strange but after having it at a friend's house I was completely won over. By far the best tasting pizza I have ever had. Now we've been serving it to friends for years to rave reviews. Go the extra mile and make your own pizza dough, you won't regret the effort.
