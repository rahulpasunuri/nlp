I followed the recipe exactly, except I used orang juice concentrate. Very good.

I made this for dinner tonight and I thought it was good, but bland. I was expecting the sauce to have more flavor. The only change I made was I didn't put in the last 2T of butter in the sauce. I just didn't think it was good enough to be worth eating that much butter.

I had to broil everything because we don't have a grill, but otherwise did everything the same. I also think I ended up making 'browned butter" balsamic sauce-- cooked the butter too long before adding the vinegar, but it turned out really nice--toasty flavored. Overall, the recipe turned out really really well.

We thought this was great, but we did make some changes. We cooked some onions and leeks in butter in a skillet, then cooked the steaks in the same pan. When they were done, we popped them in the oven to keep warm and made the sauce in the steak pan to get all the yummy fond. We also added a bit of cream to the sauce to mellow it out, with lots of S&P and a dash of sugar and then added the juices from the dish in the oven to the sauce just before serving. Delish!

My husband and I loved the sauce. Exceptional.

This was a waste of a good shallot. The sauce became just like liquid oil, many of the rosemary stems came off the sprigs and had to be picked out of the sauce. I thought the orange juice added too much sweetness.

So-so, the sauce needed lots of salt, and wasn't nearly as flavorful as I thought it would be. I made it exactly as written. I didn't make all the onions, just grilled up some red onions with the steak, and the sauce tasted very good on the onions.

This is now my favorite steak sauce. I guess everything is good with a whole stick of butter.

This was rather bland. Not impressive. So many better ways to have a delicious steak.

My husband loves sauces and he thought this one was excellent. I can take or leave sauces but I agreed with him, a definite addition to the steak. Make sure that you reduce the sauce like the recipe says. Will definitely keep this in my collection.

My husband loves sauces. He thought this sauce was excellent. I don't care whether I have a sauce or not. I agree with him, this was a wonderful addition to the steak. Make sure that you reduce the sauce as the recipe says. The vegetables were a wonderful side dish. I will most definitely make this again.
