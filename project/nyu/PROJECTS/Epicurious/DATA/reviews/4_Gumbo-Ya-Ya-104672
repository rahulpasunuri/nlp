I printed this recipe in 1999 and have been using it a couple times per year ever since. Great family favorite, I work a rotating shift and I make this, quart it up and freeze, its ready for the family in a pinch...

This was my first gumbo attempt and I'm really happy with the way it came out! I'd give more stars but like other reviewers, didn't follow the recipe as written. I did a lot of roux research and after reading reviews I had planned to follow the 1:1 ratio of flour and butter but accidentally only did two sticks of butter instead of four and didn't realize it until the end. [Whoops!] I cooked the roux over low heat for an hour stirring very frequently until it was a dark copper color. Even with that mistake, my gumbo still came out great! I didn't have much fat to skim off either. Adjustments I made: sauteed the vegetables ahead of time, reduced broth to four cartons, used 1 tbsp less of cajun seasoning and salt, added raw Louisiana shrimp, used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery, and grilled my sausage before adding. Will make again!!

Great potential, but mine came out very thin. Will try a different recipe next time.

I cut the recipe in half. Roux does take an hour. Got mine the color of chocolate. DID NOT ADD ANY SALT AT ALL. Read the reviews that said add salt last. Used Chicken Stock w/salt. Croele Seasoning is mostly salt, so didn't have to use any salt. Didn't have andouille, used chorizo - didn't add any garlic either. Used 3-leg/thigh chicken qtrs and 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts. Did add shrimp and instead of traditional okra, a zucchini diced. I also ran out of flour (how does that happen???) so 4th c of flour was Wondra. Texture was satiny and thick. Wonderful! I'm not a spice person per se, but my husband is and he loved it! Froze about 1/2 - without shrimp for girls weekend - big hit with balsamic rice and green salad. Used chicken stock to reheat and added shrimp then. Again, big hit. Would do again any time I had an hour for the roux!

This is a basic recipe for authentic gumbo. Mr. B's Bistro published "Gumbo Ya-Ya" when the restaurant opened in NO in 1979. BASIC: Most every cook outside of La. NEEDS TO KNOW HOW TO MAKE A GOOD QUALITY ROUX. You may use either butter or good quality vegetable oil, however, this is the basis of every great gumbo. Best to stir the roux up in a black iron skillet, however, La. cooks know how to make it correctly many different ways. Also, south Louisiana gumbo does not have a big (awful) can of tomatoes in it! Again, the secret is in the quality of the dark, mahogany colored roux that you create as the basis for the recipe. Mr. B's Bistro is a prominent New Orleans family owned restaurant, and Gumbo YA YA was a great way to indocrinate tourists to our most famous soup recipe. Also of note, this recipe calls for sausage and chicken. La. chefs do not always make "seafood gumbo" and rely upon duck, chicken, hen, and other ingredients for authentic gumbo. Happy mardi gras.

I am not sure if I just don't like this type of cooking but I wasn't impressed. I added shrimp and cooked the veggies seperately as well as cutting down the flour. It had a soup-like consistancy and I added rice at the end. Was still very thin so I think that the original amount of flour is probably good. I burned the first roux I made so started over being very careful. Other than this step, the rest is easy as could be. My husband loved it as did my son's friend. So I think this is a really good recipe just not my cup of tea :)

have made this recipe several times , and it is always a hit . Putting Okra into this recipe is a real good thing , and also thickens the roux . Be careful salting . I also use chicken thighs , which i roast in the oven , remove the skin and debone , or i have left the meat on the bone. I also put shrimp in this recipe . Sooooooo Goooood!

We loved this. I used a 1:1 ratio of flour/butter for the roulx. I waited until the end to add salt and found that it did need quite a bit, probably because I used homemade stock that was unsalted. My only other variation was to throw in some shrimp and frozen sliced okra when the chicken and sausage were added. YUMBO GUMBO!!!

Followed it to the t. Loved it. Definitely add rice.

forgot to mentinon, I skipped the salt altogether. There is enough aslt in broth, sausage, and creole seasoning.

This is my second time making this gumbo. I changed the roux proportions and used less liquid as per previous reviewers. My roux took about 45 min to get the color. I went easy on the creole seaosoning because of the salt, and added more at the end. This made a lot, and even more after adding a 28oz can of tomato, and a package of frozen cut okra. I will be eating this for a while! Yum!

Do NOT salt until the end. Mine was too salty and I love salt. Cut recipe in 1/2 and was plenty for 4 people. Roux ratio of 1:1 used by others was a bit thin, but added a bit of cornstarch. Will make again but leave salt out until the end. Used Trader Joe's andouille sausage, maybe that was the salt culprit?

Rating: 4
My guys loved this recipe! I followed the directions exactly, and was quite satisfied with the outcome. For those who halved the roux, why not just double up on the meat instead? That way you have some to serve, and some to freeze. And to those who wanted a little more heat - use hot andouille sausage. You'll definitely feel the kick!

I can not believe how delicious this gumbo turned out! The only reason I'm not giving this one four stars is that I tweaked the recipe quite a bit. I wanted to make it healthier so I poked around online to find out if there was a way to make a healthier roux...I ended up going half butter, half olive oil and it worked out fine, though I did have to watch it a bit more carefully because of the lower smoke point of the oil. Also, I was a bit over-cautious with the roux so it ended up taking almost two hours of constant stirring to get to the right color! Of course all that TLC yielded some deep, hearty roux, but it was something of an ordeal. Aside from that, I only used four quarts of stock, and halved the flour and sauteed the veggies beforehand per other reviewers' suggestions. The result was restaurant-quality -- seriously -- and we had enough food for a week. Yum!

Rating: 4
Fantastic recipe. I did use the 1:1 ratio, cut the recipe to 4 cups stock and halved the spices since I am in the Midwest. It turned out great though I did add a bit more of Tony's Creole seasoning and fresh shrimp at the end. Curious if folks skim all the of the fat off their gumbo's? I kept stirring it back in and it was a bit rich.

I read many of the reviews before deciding to make this dish for an informal Mardi Gras meal last night. I made this exactly as per the recipe, except I cut all measurements in half (which resulted in enough for two hungry men, a hungry gal - me - and leftovers for another meal for two.) I started to follow the other reviewer's advice as to roux proportions, but thought better of it. On my gas range, the roux process took about a half hour, but I can imagine that it would be MUCH longer on an electric stove. I cooked the roux to a chocolate color and didn't find it "floury" tasting at all. I used homemade turkey stock from this year's Thanksgiving turkey. I LOVE THIS RECIPE! Yes it is spicy, but not uncomfortably so. I served it over a timbale of white rice and made for a beautiful presentation. This one's going into the "grab this if the house is on fire" recipe box!

Rating: 4
this was a crowd pleaser. essential to cook the roux until browned as adds desired thickness/flavor to the base. topped with okra after serving to avoid any sliminess in the pot.

I would also cut about four cups of the stock...too soupy if you use it all.

Rating: 4
I don't know if I'll try another gumbo recipe! This was so great I don't think it could get better. I think I will add okra though just a personal preference but it tasted so good. Making the roux had me nervous. It seemed like it took forever then the color started coming darker and darker until finally it was a little darker then milk chocolate! Delish!!! Worth the time.

Rating: 3
Okay, toss up between 3 and 4 forks, mostly because of the recipes actual roux ratio they were calling for...I too changed the roux to a 1:1 ratio and cut the recipe in half (we love gumbo, but, not this much). I also cut the amount of stock and replaced part of the chicken stock with seafood stock and only used at 2/3 of what the recipe called for (per my recipe reduction). Also, I added 16oz diced seeded tomatoes and 1 lb of chopped Okra, because it isn't Gumbo without Okra. I sauteed the Okra with the Onions, bell peppers etc. Definately take the time to do the Roux properly, the flavor is second to none. And I don't know what half hour this recipe was talking about to get a dark roux, it takes about an hour plus in a good cast iron pot. But...GREAT with the adjustments. We love to add seafood in this!

i've been making this recipie for 2 yrs now.....fantastic!!... worth all the effort...however, i did 'tweek' it... used 1/2 amount of roux...... more chicken stock...... freshly roasted chicken is best.....dont skimp on that.. love it, crave it......friends keep asking me to make it ( esp on cold snowy weekends)

Four forks with changes from other users. My 11 year old who refuses to eat anything that isn't pizza or chicken fingers was requesting this recipe the following weekend. Big hit.

Rating: 4
I'm giving this 4 stars only because the bones of the recipe are good, it just needs some serious tweaking! I omitted 1 cup of flour, added another couple of cups of stock, added 2 19 oz. cans of diced tomatoes, 2 cups of rice and carrots. An inexperienced cook would have trouble with this recipe, especially if they were following it to a T.

Rating: 3
I should have read previous reviews before making the roux. The recipe calls for WAY too much flour. Also way too much stock. Honestly I messed around with all the measurements with this recipe to make it turn out right, but the ingredients themselves make a terrific dish.

Rating: 2
I gave this recipe two forks because if I had made it according to the directions it would not have tasted nearly as wonderful as what I made. I followed the recommendations of several reviewers and cut the roux to a 1:1 ratio and cut back on one quart of chicken stock and replaced it with a can of 28 oz fire roasted diced tomatoes. I also added some okra because I just felt like I couldn't call it gumbo wihtout it. It was fantastic. The final product was definitely 4 forks.

Rating: 4
This same recipe appears in Feb. 2009 Gourmet. From the same chef and restaurant. The newer version changes the roux proportions slightly: 4 sticks unsalted butter to 3 c. flour. I still found it too "flour-y" tasting and will make again seeing if less roux will work. I also made a seafood version using this as a base recipe. Instead of the meats, I used (for 1/2 recipe) 3/4 lb. shrimp, 3/4 lbs bay scallops and a jar of fresh oysters. Also, used a combination of fish and chicken stock. Came out very well, except for a bit of overwhelming flour taste.

Rating: 4
I've made this twice. Both times it has taken an hour plus just to make the roux (1:1) but that is the "bones" of this dsih and the rest is easy. I added shrimp and next time, I'll reduce the salt by half.

Rating: 3
I would have given it four forks, but I made a number of changes to it, so I am not sure if it would have been honest. However, I went through the previous reviews, and I made several of the recommended changes: (1) Change the ratio for the roux to 1:1. Two cups of butter to 2 cups of flour. (2) Saute the vegetables before adding to the stock. (3) Use 4 quarts of stock instead of 5. (4) Add a 28oz can of diced tomatoes. (5) Only use 1 tbsp of salt instead of 2. With those changes, it was excellent. And, BTW, you must skin the fat and scum.

Rating: 3
With my changes 4 stars. First, I sautéed the peppers and celery separately with the thyme -- I used skinless chicken thighs and coated them with store bought Creole seasoning and seared them, cut the sausage into rounds and sautéed them, doubled the amount of onions and cooked them down to a paste. I also used the 1:1 for the Roux which took almost an hour. My big complaint was the amount of chicken stock -- I should have reduced it by half so even after an hour of cooking it did not thicken. I added a large can of diced tomatoes and just before serving added a bag of frozen shrimp. Don't like okra so I didn't add it. Guests raved -- I think it was the Roux.

Rating: 2
followed this recipe exactly and it really didn't turn out like i had wished. i think the roux could be cut down to about 3/4 of what is stated. adding okra really gave it a "slimy" texture also. don't think i'll make this again.

Well, this recipe is close but I had to monkey with it on suggestions from others. 1:1 on the rue using canola oil, I used whole weat flour. Only used 3 quarts of stock, 1 tablespoon of Creole seasoning (for the kids), 1/2 tsp of chili powder and I used 1lb of chicken, shrimp and sausage. I also added 2 cups of brown rice but wished I used 3 cups

Rating: 4
I made this using the leftover turkey from T- Day. First, I made homemade stock with the carcass and giblets to replace the store-bought chicken stock. I used equal parts butter and flour and made a peanut butter colored roux, which worked beautifully. I also added 4 jalepenos (diced) and 4 chiles de adobo to increase the spiciness and increased the garlic to 2 heads (we love heat and garlic!). WOW, this was amazing. I also used hot chili powder and added some hot New Mexico chile power. I used another reviewer's advice and sauteed the veggies separately while making the roux and heating the turkey stock. Be very careful adding the stock, it really steams and if unprepared, as I was, can be quite a surprise to the hand! I also added a can of fire-roasted tomatoes to the pot, as I like tomatoes in my gumbo. I highly recommend making this gumbo, especially if you have leftover turkey. I will definitely use this as a base for all my gumbos from now on - I'm going to do a seafood gumbo instead of poultry and use oysters, crab, crawfish, etc. The husband and I will be happily eating this all weekend!

Oh so good! Used canola oil instead of butter, doubled the seasoning and used chicken, shrimp and cajun jalapeno sausage. I also added some frozen okra from my garden. Delicious!

Rating: 4
I'm on the fence as to whether to give this 3 or 4 forks, because I did make a few changes, but I think that it's the solid foundation of this recipe that made it SO good. I didn't need six quarts of soup, so I cut back on everything, starting with the rue.1:1 like the others suggested. I also am a believer that gumbo requires tomatoes and okra, so I added both, plus cooked brown rice. absolutely perfect. Best gumbo I've ever had.

Mind you, I am a California girl who knows little of Southern cooking, but I thought this Gumbo was excellent and received raves from my fiance as well. It was still fabulous even though I cut down the butter by half, used boneless skinless chicken breasts, added come cherry tomatoes and reduced the cooking time for the roux and chicken stock mixture down to 5 minutes for each step. (I only had 40 minutes to cook!). While I'm sure it would be better wih the longer cooking time, the flavor and consistency was still very good. (loved the spiciness!) Served over Trader Joe's Spanish Rice (comes in a box and cooks in 20 minutes). An easy weeknight meal!

Rating: 3
Follow the roux advice 1:1, and remember it takes about the same amount of time to drink a glass of wine as it does to get a "brick" colored roux. I make Gumbo every year to celebrate Mardi Gras and this is probably one of the better recipes, mostly because I can cheat and buy an already roasted chicken! For those who are not spicy food lovers mix all of the spices seperately and add them a little at a time and taste to see what the spice level is. The tomatoes are a really nice addition, thanks for that advice!

I took this to a soup party and was told that it was in the top three. I still have people asking for the reciepe. I agree, the roux should be equal amounts of butter and flour. I also agree with cooking the veggies first and adding them in after you add the broth, the roux is very hot! Now, I did omit the peppers, cut back on the amount of onion, added shrimp and extra celery. So you can play around with it, I just made it to suit my personal preference.

Rating: 3
Totally agree with adjusting the roux to a 1:1 ratio. Be sure to saute the celery, onion and peppers seperate and add after adding the broth to the roux. Be sure to skim the scum and don't rush things! I ama firm believer in okra in my gumbo so added this. Also, I love the diced tomato in my gumbo so added a 28oz can of diced tomato with juice in lieu of 1qt of broth. Having gone to college close to New Orleans I am particular about my gumbo! I am happy with this recipe-with a few adjustments:).

I am a first time roux-maker also, so after reading all the other reviews, I started early and took my time, always cooking at low to medium-low heat. I did 2 sticks of butter to 1.5 cups flour, and I think that was the secret. I also watched my roux like a hawk, stirring extremely often. It did NOT take me an hour! More like 35 mins. I was thankful that I had done most of my ingredient prepping in advance. I did not experience the "scum" during making the roux, but I did skim-off oil and other stuff while the gumbo simmered later on (the oils tend to gather on the sides.) Overall, I added an extra 1/2 green bell pepper, I used chicken breasts that I cooked in a skillet beforehand, and an extra dash of cayenne pepper...pretty spicey. In the end, I was so proud of myself! It was pretty yummy. Thanks to all other reveiwers, I could not have done it without your sound advice!

I always read the review first but this time no. I made it for many people that travel to New Orleans and they said the best they ever had. BUT, there is way too much flour and butter.I will work on this and get back to you all.

I am not partial to chicken gumbo. I lived in Southern Louisiana as a pre teen and teen ager. Where ever the oil drilling rigs were, thats where I was. I spent one summer living with a Cajun family on Bayou du Portage between New Iberia and Breaux Bridge. The mother taught me how to cook. In her opinion, if it wasn't seafood gumbo, it wasn't gumbo. Most of the people in Southern Louisiana seemed to feel the same way. Things have gotten easier now -- It is a lot easier to use Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning than mixing up a batch - comes out better too. Make a good dark roux and use a lot of shrimp, craw fish, oysters, cat fish, crabs (messy but good) and any other seafood available. Kitchen Bouquet also helps with the taste and color, too. Use good fresh Gumbo File for flavor and thickening. It needs to be served over some good rice.

I was not terribly impressed with this gumbo. I found that the chile powder added an unpleasant aftertaste; I have tried many gumbo recipes before, all of which use straight cayenne pepper for seasoning, which I prefer. No one can top Paul Prudhomme in my opinion for gumbo-making. Secondly, I didn't see the need for making up a large batch of Creole seasoning mix only to use 2 tablespoons of it. I just don't make gumbo often enough to warrant mixing up enough for 10 batches - why not just add the extra pepper/garlic and add the oregano/basil directly to the recipe ingredients? Finally, although the roux was a beautiful dark mahogany color, I wonder if the hour of cooking added some burnt flavor as well. What I did like was using a roasted chicken, much easier than frying up a chicken as in Paul Prudhomme's cookbook, and I think that I will try substituting a roasted chicken for the cajun fried chicken next time I make his gumbo, perhaps adding a little extra cayenne to spice it up.

'Roux Stew' should be the true name of this recipe. If you like the taste if flour toasted in oil then this one is for you. I made a half batch to the letter and was wondering what the reviews were all about. I just got back from the French Quarter and had a gumbo that was God-like. It was thinner but richer and had a seafood base. I will continue my search for something closer to it...

Roux is the key. Cook it slow on moderate heat until the flour starts to smell like hazelnut. Fantastic.

Wow! This is an delicious recipe for gumbo. Thanks to all the previous cooks who worked out the kinks. Yes, the ratio for the roux is 1:1. I halved the recipe so used 2 sticks of butter and 1 cup of flour. It took me just over an hour to cook the roux to the mahagony color on very low heat. I made the creole seasoning according to the recipe and it was delicious and we have lots leftover for another meal or to use as a rub. One final important addition: We add about a 1/2 Tsp of Gumbo File` to each bowl of gumbo. It thickens the gumbo beautifully and adds the signature flavor and color of the awesome gumbo we had in New Orleans at 'Acme Oyster bar'.

I have to dissent from the other cooks. This meal was terrible, a total, unmitigated disaster. I've tried over 4 dozen recipes here, successfully for the most part, and this was just awful. First of all, the roux. The recipe calls for 2 cups (2 cups!) of butter of 4 cups (4 cups!) of flour. Other reviewers have noted the proportions seem to be a little "off." No kidding. How is one supposed to create a sauce or liquid with such proportions? I wound up with something resembling bread dough, and no, it didn't get dark mahogany in color. Still, I soldiered on...using the Creole seasoning, and the link for that recipe. But, wait, after emptying my spice jars, following the recipe for the seasoning, it turned out that I only needed 1/3 of it. Moreover, I was asked to add spices on top of this seasoning that were already part of the seasoning (thyme, garlic, pepper). How irrational is that? Anyway, to cut to the chase, I wasted 2 1/2 hours making this dreadful dish that was barely edible. A waste of good ingredients and a colossal waste of time, and I'm still hungry. And people are giving this recipe 4 forks! Bah, humbug!

Rating: 4
This was a great meal! I chose it while searching under 'one dish meals' because I wanted something I could make a little ahead of time so I could relax with my company instead of cooking after they arrived. It ended up being a huge amount of food (I made the full recipe)--it was far more than enough for the 8 of us. The next time I make it I will be sure to cook the flour longer--since it was so much flour it took far longer to brown than I anticipated. In all, a great meal to make in advance for a crowd.

Rating: 4
at first I thought that would be too much flour so I started with 1 to 1. I kept adding flour until it was worked in with the butter and after a few minutes it started to look like roux marterial. I turned the heat up and stirred continuously until the color matched an old penny. This is an important and neccesary step to get the true flavor. Skimming tye scum after adding the broth is another vital and neccesary step, otherwise your gumbo will taste like raw flour. I increased the amount of chopped veggies to account for what I might lose during the skimming. Next time I will saute the veggies in a different skillit while I skim the broth, then add the veggies.

Rating: 0
EXCELLENT gumbo. But like a former cook mentioned, I used a 1:1 ratio on the roux (2 cups butter, 2 cups flour) And even this amount seemed a little high. I also added the broth to the roux before adding the veggies. As a previous cook mentioned, it is essential for easy skimming of the "skum". After skimming, I added the veggies and all the spices. Definitely skim the oil that comes to the surface every 15 minutes. I also felt that 2 tbsp of salt is too much. I love salt, but this is a little too salty. I'll try 1 tbsp next time. Throwing in a few shrimp at the end is a good idea. Long preparation, but well worth the trouble.

Rating: 4
This gumbo recipe is excellent, but be sure to modify the flour/butter ratio to make it closer to 1:1, be diligent about skimming off the foam, and be sure to allocate plenty of time. From start to finish I took me around three hours, but it is worth it.

Wow! What a marvelous gumbo recipe! My husband & I recently returned from New Orleans and ate at Mr. B's Bistro several times and ordered the gumbo dishes. However, we thought the restaurant gumbo was too salty, for our taste, so we eliminated the salt from this recipe (the creole seasoning has a sufficient amount). We only made a 1/4 of the recipe (enough for 2) and the roux only took 20 minutes. Plus we added fresh skinless, boneless chicken thighs and a few shrimp at the end. The flavors are superb!

Rating: 4
I used 3 cups of flour rather than 4. I have never made a roux before. After waiting and mixing an hour, I turned the heat up to medium. Another hour I turned it up a bit higher stirring constantly. I finally gave up before I should have. Next time I am going to start with a higher flame. Recipe was great, I could have fed about 15 people. (I made rice too). Hopefully it freezes well.

Rating: 4
By the time the roux was ready for the veggies it was getting a bit dry and it would have been nearly impossible to stir adequately, SO I carmelized them in a bit of butter in a separate pan, then added them to the roux with the extra butter. Worked great! I also added the sausage at that point -- figured that the gumbo might as well get the full effect of the andouille seasoning. Fantastic!!

Rating: 4
My first time not only making, but eating Gumbo. Brought it into the office for our Mardi Gras party and everyone is loving it. Subbed store bought "Cajun Seasonings" for the homemade blend, and subbed Kielbasa for the Andouille Sausage. Also used plain old Chicken Broth instead of Stock. Next time, will add the veggies after the broth has simmered for a bit and the flour is skimmed out- the veggies rose to the top and made skimming difficult. Is a winner and worth the effort- was about 3 hours start to finish.

I follow the recommendations to half the roux and it works perfectly everytime -- and I have made it many times. May I recommend Amy's brand of chicken andouille sausage as well. Far less fatty and very tasty in the gumbo. This gumbo freezes very well too!

I made this recipe for dinner guests last week to raves! I followed the advice of another reviewer and skimmed the flour off the top while simmering, and had NO flour taste at all. Also, reduced the flour to appx. 2 1/2 cups. The roux took 2 hours! But other than that this is very easy to make. I added shrimp and 2 pinches of file powder at the end. The only recipe to try, as far as I am concerned!!

What scum?? I also halved the recipe, but my god, it was an awful lot of roux. My family liked this tolerably, but I thought it was just about inedible.

Rating: 4
As a chef from western Pa. I couldn't help but notice an important step left out of this otherwise great recipe. Then, upon reading the reviews for it and seeing that almost everyone experienced the problem, I felt that I must clue future users of this recipe into the step. Most reviews complained of a overly floury taste, this is due to the fact that the flour products are not skimmed off. You see, when using a roux as a thickening agent, one must "skim the scum" off as it simmers. After adding the liquid and bringing it up to temperture, reduce heat to a slow simmer, allow it to sit without stirring, a scum will form, this is comprised of mostly flour, skim this off and repeat process several times, this will remove the floury taste to the recipe. It is important to not stir this "scum" back into the dish.

Tastes extremely rich, thick, and creamy, but I would never make it again because of the effort required. This was my first time making roux/gumbo. I halved the recipe and used the proportions specified at http://www.mrbsbistro.com/reci.htm: 1 lb. Unsalted butter 1 lb. all-purpose flour The texture seemed just perfect. I used medium-low heat, but after over four hours, the roux had reached only a caramel color, not dark mahogany. Because it was after midnight, I gave up on darkening it further and went ahead and finished the recipe. When I tasted it, I kept perceiving an excess of butter and flour, but that may have been psychological, given that I had been stirring those two ingredients for so long. I would recommend adding more "stuff," especially vegetables. As for the chicken broth, I used 60% canned chicken broth and 40% homemade broth from the chicken bones and the veggie remains.

I made this recipe for a family reunion and got RAVE reviews. I adjusted the roux to a 2:3 ratio (3 cups flour) and I still thought it was a bit too "floury" tasting. My mother said she has always followed 1:1 ratio when making roux, which I will follow next time. This is a great gumbo recipe because you can follow the basics then add shellfish, okra or whatever you desire. This is a keeper!

Rating: 4
Overall this is a fantastic recipe for Gumbo. It is REALLY important to fix the roux ratios however. You should start with a 1:1 ratio, 2c flour to 2c (4sticks) butter. And definitely let the roux get really dark, it does wonders for the flavor. I added Okra and made my own chicken stock by boiling the leftover chicken with all of the leftover vegetable remains. I think that made a big difference. Also - I found these INCREDIBLE "oven-smoker" bags at a grocery store in Manhattan. It is a tin-foil bag that you put your chicken in, then bake in the oven. Adds an fabulous & authentic smoked chicken flavor to the gumbo. Also, next time I make this Gumbo I will use more chicken.

I made this for a large group dinner. It was fabulous. I added extra hot pepper and Okra. Gumbo is about Okra so it seemed strange that it wasn't part of the recipe. I also used a chicken andouille sausage because a few guests didn't eat red meat. I also added two pounds of medium shrimp and left the tail on. Over a bowl of rice, with a big salad it got rave reviews. I plan on making it again and again. PS Don't try to hurry the roux, you'll burn it and have to start over again. It is a long , slow process but worth the time.

Contrary to the first reviewer, the original recipe from Mr. G's Bistro website calls for 1 pound of butter to 1 pound of flour. A pound of flour is roughly 3 cups, so I made the roux with 2c butter to 3c flour. Many other roux recipes I've seen support this 2 to 3 ratio. It was perfect! I think 2 to 2 would have been too thin.

I am planning on making this but I just wanted to put in a note about the roux. As many reviewers have figured out, the proportions of butter to flour for the roux are wrong. I went to the web-site for Mr. B's and it contains this same recipe. The roux ingredients, according to Mr. B's, should be 2 cups butter and 2 cups flour.

Great recipe, although not as spicy as other gumbos. Easy to prepare. The sauce is velvety, rich and delicious.

WOW! Half the recipe is just enough for six enthusiastic adults as a soup course. Add a 1 or 2 ounce ice cream scoop of white rice to each serving to make it authentic. By the way, the mahogany color you are looking for matches the Mr.B's sign!

This was my first attempt at a roux. After burning the first one, I was ready to completely discard this recipe out of sheer frustration. (i'd already worked about 45 minutes!) Thank god I didn't! Who knew heaven came in a bowl?!? So yummy...tastes just like some I had a jazz fest this year in new orleans.

I should have printed all reviews before starting! The Roux was indeed thick as everyone else mentioned, and took more than the suggested hour. It was tasty and appealing the first day, but didn't reheat that well. It congealed easily, but did not affect the taste. I'll definitely decrease the flour if I make it again.

This was excellent!I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the flour by 2C (a mahogany roux can also be made with oil and flour over med-high heat constantly stirred in about 5 minutes, for those of you in a hurry). I added 8 diced roma tomatoes, 1.5 lbs. sliced fresh okra, and 1.5 lbs. rock shrimp. This is my new recipe for gumbo. YUMMOLIA!!!!

Time-consuming to make, but well worth the effort! Received raves from all who were lucky enough to try a sample. Took the advice of other reviewers and cut the roux to 2c butter and 2c flour. Excellent!

Wow! This recipe is a keeper! I changed only one thing - I made the roux by using equal proportions of butter and flour (1 cup butter to 1 cup flour). The roux was perfect and the gumbo sensational. I will make this again and again.

THIS IS SUCH A GREAT RECIPE. I USE JUST ABOUT THE SAME INGREDIENTS, BUT ALSO ADD A LITTLE FRESH THAI PEPPER (JUST BECAUSE I LOVE IT!). I ALSO MAKE THE ROUX WITH THE SAME PROPORTIONS. THANK YOU FOR LETTING EVERYONE SEE THIS GREAT RECIPE!

Incredible! The whole family loved it, though I did set aside a not-so-spicy batch for the kids. The roux takes FOREVER!

I started out with the same problem as nan, but luckily was able to salvage by adding another stick of butter (to half batch). I think the butter to flour ratio is incorrect: should be 2c flour to 4 sticks of butter. The given proportions makes a dough, not a roux. Turned out very delicious!

Did anyone else have problems with the roux? I made half a recipe and ended up with concrete for the roux. Added up to 1 qt of chicken stock to try and salvage the situation, but to no avail. So I started over with a basic roux of 1/3 C olive oil and 1/4 cup plus 2 TBS of flour. Great roux, but the gumbo didn't thicken--probably because there wasn't any okra. Any suggestions? The final dish was tasty, but needed a lot of rice and file to thicken.

I've used this recipe for years. It's great.
