I used thin sliced pork chops. The recipe was very easy. Nice texture. Next time I'll use a 2 to 1 proportion of mustard to mayonaise.

This is a good recipe. I pounded the pork thin and only cooked just over 2 minutes per side and then let rest on a platter with loose foil for a minute. I felt that the recipe needed more mustard. So that is why I only gave it 3 stars. More mustard, more lemon. Then it would be excellent. Great week night dinner. Quick and easy.

This recipe produces very good results for the time spent. I used 1/2 inch boneless pork chops and then trimmed the edge fat and pounded them. I also used dried sage instead of fresh. I did use the Panko crumbs, lemon zest and both the mustard/mayo and egg washes as I feel the egg helps everything to bind without the need to refrigerate before cooking. I added a tablespoon of butter to the olive oil for flavor. I ate it with some homemade chicken gravy that I had leftover which tasted great, but was a bit more than it and my waistline needed. I think a light lemon sauce of some sort would be better and I will do that next time..

I like this recipe. The only thing is I used center cut pork chops and they came out a bit dry (I may have cooked them a wee bit too long) but the flavor was good. I would try this again with the cutlets because I think pork cutlets might be a little fattier.

I used 1/2 inch boneless pork chops and did not pound them, yet they still were tender. I didn't have lemon or sage so I used dried thyme, garlic powder, paprika and salt/pepper. I used both the mayo/mustard dredge as well as the egg dip. I pan fried in canola oil. This recipe is a real winner. I will definitely be making this again!

Easy, flavorful dish. I did the quick and dirty version - lemon juice, not rind, and dried sage, and it was enjoyed by all

This is a nice variation of breaded and fried cutlets, which were a staple in my home growing up. I'm not sure, though, what they mean by 10-12 oz "cutlets." That seems way too thick to truly be a cutlet (maybe they mean thick boneless chops??). Regardless, I used 5 thin boneless pork cutlets which were only 2.5 oz each. I followed the recipe exactly with one small exception; I used regular olive oil, not garlic- flavored. My thoughts: it needed salt; the lemon zest was unnecessary; the fresh sage was nice, but not necessary; the mustard taste was subtle but good; would work equally well with chicken.

I had purchased panko for no particular use and got sick of looking at it in the pantry so I found this recipe. I did not have the lemon peel so it was omitted. We enjoyed the pork a great deal and thought the mayo/mustard combo made for a nice moist cutlet. I tried this preparation with chicken breast at a later date and it was equally good. Very easy to make.

Used regular unseasoned breadcrumbs & plain olive oil and omitted the egg. Very satisfied with the results. My husband liked it even more.

I used dried sage in this recipe instead of fresh but it still seemed to work out okay. It was very tasty; the only problem I really had was that the crust kept falling of the meat once we sat down to eat them. Next time I would probably let the coated pieces dry a little longer on a rack before frying them, hopefully that would solve the problem.

Found this to be an excellent recipe. You can buy pork cutlets at Trader Joe's that don't need pounding. I happened to have sage in the refrigerator, really made it work. Served with farmers' market asparagus and some noodles with butter and cheese, and there was nothing left at the end, always a good sign.

I liked it more than my husband. He thought it was too lemony. I followed the recipe exactly. Loved the panko bread crumbs, my first time using them. And they fried up nice and crispy in the olive oil. It was the lemon he didn't like. I thought it was okay.

Very good and easy week night meal. Served with buttered noodles and broccoli.

Pork will be more tender if you butterfly and pound the pork tenderloin medallions until thin before proceeding. We did not use egg wash either but refrigerated first. We used a mixture of olive oil and butter for the saute for added flavor. Served with roasted butternut squash and braised red cabbage for an autumn/winter dinner.

I ommitted egg/water and just used mustard and mayo as base for butterflied pork chops. Used dried french bread crumbs crushed fine, thyme, parsley and some parmesan as coating. Really delicious, but the chops were quite tough after I finished them in the oven and the breading got somewhat soft (but still tasty). I would try this with another cut or will tenderize first or use cutlets next time to get a more tender piece of meat.

Good, easy way to make cutlets with what is already in the pantry. Used fresh parsely instead of sage.

An excellent recipe! I skipped the sage in favor of 1/2 clove of minced garlic. Instead of lemon zest I used 1/8 tsp. of my handier & potent Boyajian Lemon Oil. I used 250ml peanut oil in my versatile Cybernox heavy skillet to simulate deep-frying rather than sauteing. I skipped the egg wash too, but that was a mistake! The mayo-mustard was much weaker; the wash will seal the mixture on the meat! Also suggest putting the coated choplets in the fridge for an hour before cooking in order firm up the coating. Also, pounding the meat beforehand was a good idea.

This is an Americanized version of the Japanese classic Tonkatsu. Pan fried rather than deep fried and it works well. I did use Kikkoman Tonkatsu Sauce with a side of shredded white cabbage soaked in ice water to be close to the original.

DELISH! I SKIPPED THE EGG WASH - DIDN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME AND SEEMED LIKE IT WOULD WASH OFF THE MUSTARD SPREAD. CRUMBS STUCK PERFECTLY TO THE MUSTARD SAUCE. WE THOUGHT THEY NEEDED SALT SO NEXT TIME I'LL SALT THE CHOPS FIRST. ALSO I THINK A LITTLE MORE SAGE WOULD BE BETTER. MY CUTLETS WERE SUPER THICK SO I FINISHED THEM IN THE OVEN IN THE PAN. DON'T SKIP THE LEMON WEDGES IF YOU CAN HELP IT. THE JUICE REALLY PUTS THE TOPPER ON THIS. I THOUGHT THIS WAS MUCH BETTER THAN A WEEK-NIGHT MEAL. SERVED IT WITH FRESH BASIL MASHED POTATOES AND GREEN BEANS. DEFINITELY GOOD ENOUGH FOR COMPANY. PAIRED IT WITH A SHIRAZ - GOOD WITH MUSTARD AND SAGE.

I agree with the previous reviewer. I used lamb instead. It was a perfect week day dinner

Easy to prepare. Flavorful and moist. An excellent week-day entree. I sliced a boneless pork loin roast in 1/2 in. slices. Yummy!
