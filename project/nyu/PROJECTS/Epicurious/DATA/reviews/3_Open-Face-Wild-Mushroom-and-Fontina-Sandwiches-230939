I love mushrooms so I was very exited about this recipe. The only change I made was before I put on the fontina I drizzled the mushrooms with a little aged balsamic vinegar. This was a scrumptious lunch.

This recipe was delicious. Even my boyfriend liked it and he usually says "if there's no meat then it's not a meal"

Fantastic. Just hearty enough for autumn.

For someone who no longer eats red meat, this satisfied the urge for something 'hearty'. In addition it's really fast!
