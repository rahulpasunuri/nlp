This is winter comfort food at its finest, absolutely delicious. The only thing that seemed off to me was pairing it with pasta noodles. Instead, both times I made it I served it on a bed of creamy polenta.

Skip the bacon and it won't be salty and you won't have too much meat. Yum!

Awful! I followed directions exactly, and simply did not like any aspect of this dish. For the record, I love mustard greens, kale etc.Considering the amount of time put into this dish, it is very disappointing.

Pretty good, but quite salty.

I was skeptical that I was going to like this and fairly confident my kids wouldn't eat it, but tried it because of the reviews. We used ham because we couldn't find smoked turkey, only 1 Tb. of sugar, egg pappardelle, and a bunch of broccoli raab (that we thought was mustard greens when we chose this recipe) plus about 4 oz of a braising greens mix from our CSA box. It was delicious and everyone gobbled it up - my picky 11-year-old ate around the greens but my 8-year-old asked for seconds. We ended up with a lot of ham (out of a total of 10oz) left over so if I were doing it again I would use 16oz of pasta to balance all that meat, and add some extra greens. (And I'll definitely try harder to find turkey next time.) Definitely a good use for those mystery greens in our farm share!

I love this meal! Have made it three times already and am wondering when I can again serve it to my family. I use a smoked turkey leg (lots of extra meat), home made chicken stock and home made pasta. I've used mustard greens, beet greens, turnip greens and kale. They all work wonderfully -- and my kids happily eat their greens!

I loved the smokey, salty, sour and spicy aspects of the broth. Could not eat enough of it.

We liked this dish but did not love it. I followed the recipe exactly using ham hock and kale. There was a sweet aspect to the dish that I was not super fond of. If I were to make this again, I would definitely skip the 2 Tb. sugar.

I made this with the smoked turkey wings and it was very good. I also used collard greens instead of kale and it was not as bittertasting. I also used about two pounds of the turkey wings and the same amount of liquid as the recipe (used the chicke broth vs water) The broth was very good. I think using the wings will not be as salty as smoked ham hocks as i also used the amount of bacon in the recipe. WITH THE WINGS, THERE IS ALOT MORE MEAT TO ADD TO THE DISH.

ugh! What did I do wrong?! I was eager to try it when I found it in the magazine in February and pleased to see it turn up on the buzz box. Alas, it was awful. My family wouldn't eat it and I had to throw it away. No specific complaints, just yuk.

I want to marry this dish. I made it with a carb smart penne and otherwise 100% according to recipe. Don't skimp on the greens...at first I thought it was WAY too many, but it wilts down to the perfect amount. It is REALLY salty, which I love, but do not be tempted to add salt!

This is really delicious and satisfying, but it is rich. I did not add any salt as there was enough from the ham and bacon. I might reduce the amount of bacon next time, but it is really really good comfort food. Loved the meat from the ham hock. I made devilled eggs to go with this.

This was great! Loved the flavors! I left out the bacon and cheese, which seemed superfluous with the ham hock. It should take 1-2 hrs to reduce the liquid, on low setting, as you want to get the full flavor and tenderness from the ham hock. Homeade chicken stock really makes to good too.

this is a simple, yet excellent dish. yes, the broth is addictive. Luckly, I made more broth, using smoked turkey legs. I used the pappardelle from TJ and hubby really enjoyed it. With leftover broth, I made a delicious soup today by adding onions, peppers, carrots, celery, garlic, red beans, and tomoatoes. Just be careful with salt, since most smoked meats, including the bacon, are full of it.

Soooo tasty; addictive, even. Made it exactly as is EXCEPT the liquid only took 30 minutes to cook down to 2 cups (not 1-2 hours, as the recipe says).

This was fantastic! I ate way too much, but it is certainly a recipe worth the time - if you like greens, you'll like this!
