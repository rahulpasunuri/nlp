This is really pretty good, I used fresh corn off the cobb the last time I made it, still pretty easy-just 2 ears, and it was much better than with the canned hominy. The canned hominy was pretty starchy. Also I would go with the larger size can of enchilada sauce if available and some extra cheese on top.

Easy and kid friendly.

The hominy really does make this dish stand out. But if you aren't paying attention like I me and grab a can of corn off the shelf, it's still good. I have made it with canned yellow corn and with white hominy and both are very good. And yes the enchilada sauce makes a difference but don't sweat it if all the corner store has is Old ElPaso, that works too.

Thousand Oaks here again, only now in Pasadena. In any case, I just made this dish again (for the fourth or fifth time) and this time I tasted it and didn't add *any* seasonings! The enchilada sauce I bought was perfect on its own. I live in a more Mexican neighborhood, now, and the can I bought, Las Palmas, has very little English on it. Also, has anyone ever seen a 15 oz can of hominy? I always see 29, but I dump the whole thing in, anyway.

The hominy really makes this dish. I add plenty of extra garlic as well, but beans reduce the recipe to a typical boring meal. The toasty corn flavor of hominy and well-browned pork give this its classic taste.

to ppezella from oak park--Pozole is hominy which is only engorged corn kernels.You can buy them plain in a can and then create dishes out of it. Traditionally, the dish is made w/ pork.

I am a little confused about the pozole. Does the recipe mean hominy (that is what it reads like) or does it mean the canned hominy/pork stew?

After reading some reviews that said it was a little bland, I made sure to be heavy-handed with the salt and I used cumin (plenty) and we loved it! Super easy, super yummy!

Although this dish was a snap to prepare, it was lacking. We thought it was on the dry side and rather blah. The taste wasn't bad, just bland. I have made many better burritos without a recipe.

This recipe is excellent. Like another poster, I substituted ground coriander in the flour for the fresh. These are some of the best burritos I've had. The filling filled FIVE nice sized burritos, and we could only eat one each. Huge serving. Can't wait to make again!

Made this recipe exactly as written and it was REALLY good. Very easy recipe for weekday dinners!

I thought this was quite good, even more so because it was so quick and easy to make. I didn't have fresh corriander, so I tossed the pork in about 2 teaspoons full OF GROUND CORRIANDER (oops!) with the flour before browning it, which seemed to work just fine.

Last week I made a similar recipe, but with pork tenderloin, green enchilada sauce, green pepper, a mild (Anaheim) pepper, and no beans. Not as good as Chile Verde from a traditional restaurant, but my husband and I loved it. As someone else said, the pork and enchilada sauce are definitely keepers. It's a cheat, but a very tasty cheat - and fast.

A good blend of tastes in a burrito, yes. But there are better combinations of ingredients out there. This is far from bad, though. The pork and enchilada sauce are winners. You should put in extra cheese - but not too much extra. I think that Pepper Jack would have also sufficed, but I didn't try that. Pozole wasn't at the store, so I used pinto beans. They were a bit too stiff for me in the final product. This recipe serves two HUGE hungers, nothing less.

This is another one of those great recipes that can be made with whatever is in the fridge. I had left over pork roast to use up. Love the pozole, but the black beans & chipotle sour cream sound like great alternatives.

Every time I see pozole in the grocery store, I buy a couple of extra cans just in case I get the chance to make this recipe. My kids LOVE it and finding something to please children who range in age from 4 to 14 is not a simple task!

This recipe was okay-Nothing special to us. I followed the recipe, using pinto beans. Maybe if we used hominey it would have made a difference. We were sad because of all the positive reviews we were excited. Maybe we just were not in the mood. :(

Delish! A crowd-pleaser. With 6 in our family I had to triple the recipe and it made more than enough. I once read that country-style ribs were excellent for stews and any recipe where you wanted to avoid the pork being dry - I have tried them for many recipes and found this to be true. I used them here also and they work perfectly. More economical than loin which is always nice with a big family. Cook and enjoy!

What a tasty recipe!!! I made this for my family last night and everyone agreed that it was a keeper. The biggist compliment was from my fussy eating daughter that she wanted it for breakfast in the morning. I served with a rice salad called "Wild rice salad Vicki Lee Boyajian Cafe" this was new too. They all agreed that it was a nice side dish to this very wonderful recipe. The only this different that I did was put a dollop of sour cream on top.

i used both pozole & homemade black beans in this recipe & i also eliminated the enchilada sauce, and added a bit of salsa & a chipotle sour cream sauce instead. this was a scrumptuous meal and the beauty of it was you could actually substitute any # of ingredients that you have on hand to make it something different & individual every time that you make it!

My mother said this was better than food she's had in Mexican restaurants. I loved it too!

I've made this recipe several times in the past; it's dinenr again tonight... It's tasty, and it's spicy without being hot (so my wife can eat it).
