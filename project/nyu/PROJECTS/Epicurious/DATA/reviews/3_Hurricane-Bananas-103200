I'd make this recipe but my banana's got blown away!

adapted this a lot- left out the vinegar totally. i fried the bananas in vutter with all the spices, then poured maple syrup over them, warmed it all, poured it out into bowls, and deglazed the pan with a little bit of red wine. turned out great.

This dish is wonderful!! The tast is tropical, so one who isn't used to tropical food won't like it, but my parents would always cook like this!! i would make this again!

This was absolutley foul - tasted far too strange to be classed as a meal that 6 people could eat. I grant you, I shall NOT be making this one again - EVER!!!

Hmm - not impressed at all! Very unusual flavour. Probably caused by the balsamic vinegar. Would NOT make this again.

I THINK THAT WILL BE BETTER IF IT'S SERVED WITH A WHITE PEPPER OR VANILLA ICE CREAM
