Having made this soup many times over the years, I have only one suggestion. Make the soup (sans scallops), halve them, and saute them in butter, then add to the soup in the bowls. I use 3 pieces per serving.....they float on top, and have that nice buttery sauteed look! Everyone loves this soup!

This is a winning recipe! It's ridiculously simple, declicious, and has been a crowd pleaser every time. I love that you can make it all in one pot and it takes very little time to prepare and cook. The red pepper adds a lovely touch of spice. I wouldn't change anything in this recipe, it's perfectly balanced.

Fantastic soup, and one of the most interesting/unique I've found on this site. The only slight modification I made was to the cooking time once I'd added the scallops. Given they are halved, I found they were opaque/ready to go within only a minute. Received rave reviews from my guests, will definitely make again!!

I really enjoyed this, which surprised me as I only had a handful of ingredients and so made a soup that vaguely resembled the original. I sauteed one cup of onion in 2 tbs of coconut oil until soft (I didn't have red pepper or chicken broth) then added water, crushed red pepper and almond milk. I then had frozen scallops, so added them before the spinach until they thawed, then added the spinach, some ginger and scallions (following another reviewers suggestion as I didn't have basil either). So, I must admit, if you are a follow-the-recipe purist, I am your worst nightmare, but I add this into the review mix, because if you are an adlibber like me this recipe has great potential!

I loved this soup! I made it for Christmas eve dinner and got rave reviews from my husband and our guests. Along with the scallops, I added shrimp. While I loved it as well, next time i will add more spinach, red pepper and onion. I prefer a soup to be SUPER chunky!

This soup is perfect for a summer evening. Took me no time to make as I prepped everything ahead of time. Served it with a big salad and everyone loved it.

Delicious. I substituted crab meat for the scallops, ginger and green onion for the basil and red pepper, and milk for the cream.

This dish is very yummy considering its simplicity. If scallops are expensive for your budget, this recipe is not the most deluxe way to present them. My husband and I eat this regularly on a weekday night when we are busy and want an easy treat.

WOW! What a GREAT soup. Sublimely tasty, and easy to make. I doubled the recipe and it worked just fine. Not having bay scallops available, as other reviewers suggested, I used sea scallops; as I doubled the recipe, I used medium tiger shrimp for the other ten ounces of fish. The pink of the shrimp compliments the red pepper beautifully. This dish is a pleasure to look at and to eat. !!!! A keeper!

A great starter to our Christmas dinner. Colorful and delicious. I agree with another reviewer to use bay scallops. I am a New Englander living in Ohio where they don't understand that bigger is not better when it comes to scallops. The bays are much cheaper here but so much sweeter and have a much nicer texture so for me it was an obvious choice to use the bays.

I made this soup with fat free half n half and added some white wine at the end. Very tasty and attractive to the eye. Would make it again.

Quadrupled this recipe for a large group; it worked very well. I used half the crushed red pepper flakes called for; it came out perfectly zingy, but NOT hot. I also machine-processed my ingredients, which worked fine. I added sweet tiger prawns to the scallops, and it was great. The recipe does not call for enough scallops. Will definitely add this recipe to my repertoire!

Perfect way to start Christmas dinner. The colors are perfect - green spinach & red bell peppers. Very easy to make. Just prep all ingredients ahead of time, then it can be easily made right before serving.

This is a truly easy yet impressive soup. The flavors are complementary and in perfect ratio. I used bay scallops instead of sea scallops to much success. It is light but satisfying enough for a meal. Probably one of the best soups i have tried off this site.
