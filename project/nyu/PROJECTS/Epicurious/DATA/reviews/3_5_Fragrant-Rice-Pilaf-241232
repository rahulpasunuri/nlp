I used basmati rice, cut the carrots down to one, added a couple chopped mushrooms, and used about 4 dates instead of the cherries. It could use some crunch though. Next time I might add some slivered almonds. Served with salmon, and my boyfriend who doesn't usually like fruit in his food enjoyed it.

I omitted the cherries and used basmati for the long-grain rice and shallot instead of onion because it was what I had available. Very good with fish en papillote. Will make again.

The cherries were mushy and added very little to the overall taste of the dish...I would omit them next time. And, the carrots get mushy as well after steaming in rice for 20 minutes. Not sure I would do that again. Loved the cumin and saffrom flavors and it made the kitchen smell great while cooking, as well as our plates look colorful. But, needs some help?

I took some liberties with this recipe but it still came out great. I didn't have saffron threads and substituted a combination of marjoram and allspice. Strange, I know, but it worked. Also used currants instead of dried cherries.

I served this with Moroccan Spiced Chicken and everyone thought it was delicious. It was easy to prep ahead of time, and it cooked while we ate salad, and cooked the chicken.

Quite good despite the relative simplicity! I used NO butter or oil, just EVOO spray and a bit of chicken broth to saute the onions and garlic. I used brown rice instead of white and cranberries instead of dried cherries (don't have dried cherries on hand!).

MUST MAKE A DAY AHEAD. I tried this recipe on the day of a party, and I was sadly disappointed with it. But the next day, WOW!!! Fortunately or unfortunately, I had a lot left over from the party, so the family has truly enjoyed it since then. I had all the ingredients, except cumin, and I did include some wild rice along with basmati rice.
