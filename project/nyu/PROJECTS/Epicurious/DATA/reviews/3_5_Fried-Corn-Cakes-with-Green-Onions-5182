Good! And something different as a side dish. Make sure you stick with a scant 1/4 cup of batter, otherwise they are too thick and heavy. I topped each one with a dollop of sour cream mixed with taco sauce to taste.

I make this with a chipotle lime sour cream dip. Just some ancho chile powder, lime juice, (salt, pepper, and garlic if you like) stirred into sour cream. Yum.

Yummy- served with crumbled soy chorizo, sour cream, guac and salsa for easy and healthy dinner. Made with garden chives rather than green onions.

A new taste for me. I presented these this morning for brunch, and they went over fairly well. However, I tried them fresh off the pan, and they were very good. They lost some of their wonderful texture while they were being kept warm in the oven (while guest came). I would not use these again for a brunch, but certainly would make them for a meal and serve them immediately.

Yum. A big hit with guests. Although a couple suggested it would be even better with a "sauce". I think this would work well with a marinated meat that had some gravy. I may have made them too early, and kept them warming too long, so that they were on the dry side. Next time I make them, I'll adapt the recipe by adding some chopped jalepeno. I think it needs that extra spice. The 1/8 tsp. of cayenne was hard to detect. I am also thinking about using 1/2 of the flour, and 1/2 of the milk. They were a bit too cakey for my liking. I think the corn, egg, and a bit of flour will make them hold together well.. Also, we may put some crab meat in these. They could very easily adapt to a crab cake. Just a few ideas, but will definitely make these again. They were yummy, even as is.

I have made this recipe so many times and for so many reasons - breakfast/lunch/dinner, side dish, tv snack - it is one of my favorites. It is not supposed to be real crispy - latkes are the ones that should be crispy. The flavors combination is positively addictive - bet you can't eat just one!

It was my first time eating, much less making corn cakes and my fiance and I both liked them. However, I was just wondering....are they supposed to turn out like pancakes? Mine were very much pancake like, and I guess I was expecting something a little more crispy (?)like crab cakes. Maybe I need to cut down on the baking power as I live in a high altitude....not sure, but overall they were tasty. I served them with tilapia with tomato cilantro salsa (on this site) ans it was a very good meal....I would add a but more cayenne next time...served with sour cream on top since they were sort of like potato pancakes and I had sour cream I needed to use up...

These had a great flavor, but they didn't come out as crisp as I had expected. I don't think I had the pan hot enough to get a crust on the outside. Will definitely try again--worth an additional effort.

These are very good and easy! They were even tasty heated over the next day. They have a little southwestern flair to them, and would be great with a grilled meat marinated in southwestern flavors. Will do again soon!

I made this for a small dinner party and everyone raved and asked for the recipe. It was perfect. No changes were necessary. I will make this again very soon!!!!

Simplistic recipe, yet excellent results. Add extra cayenne and double up on the scallions. Would make again, great change from usual starches.

It was a fast, good compliment to potatoes for an unusual meal. This recipe calls for some easy to find ingredients, and everyone liked it a lot. The only thing is that I thought it came out too greasy, but the other family members didn't think so.

Serve with slices of fresh carotts, cucumber, and Anaheim pepper 'pickeled' in rice vinegar/sugar.

Superb!!! Full of flavor, easy to make, a recipe that you could use over and over again for many different meals. I served these with crab cakes for a special Sunday brunch, and wouldn't hesitate to cook them as a side for dinner. I'll definitely make these again.

Takes a while to cook! Should eat them right away off the grill, as they lose their crispiness quickly.
