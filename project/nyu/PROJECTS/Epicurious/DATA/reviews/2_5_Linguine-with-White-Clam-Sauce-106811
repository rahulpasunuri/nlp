White clam sauce with TOMATOES??? The tarragon also seems out of place. I'll probably try just to see the results, but I doubt it's going to be any good...

Delicious, with some modification. I used 4lbs of clams, and skipped the tarragon. I also added another 1/2 cup of wine. Served it over angel hair instead of linguine. Would make it again

This recipe was simple and easy to make. I used oregano instead of tarragon and added salt. Delicious. I really enjoyed to tomato in it. It gave it an unusual flavor. I brought the wine to a boil before I put the clams in the sauce also. I would definately make it again. It makes a wonderful dish for two or for your guests.

The tarragon really threw this recipe off in my view. It overpowered the other flavors and, combined with the parsley, created a kind of dissonance that we did not care for. I'm glad we tried it, but I wouldn't make it again. I prefer a more traditional recipe for this dish.
