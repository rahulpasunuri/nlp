This was tasty and a fun change with the fennel! We served this with scrambled eggs which was a lovely match. If I make this again I will make a few changes (hence the 3 forks): boil potatoes before frying and then add a small onion finely chopped to fry with the potato, steam fennel rather than boiling it.

Great recipe! I made this for my partner and I for brunch today and we both loved it. We ate it with poached eggs served over top. I anticipate making this again and again on lazy weekend mornings.

Hated it, but the guests all loved it, and several demanded copies of the recipe (the ultimate compliment, hence the three forks). So, try it anyway. I was trying to beef up for a large party and used a larger proportion of potatoes than the recipe called for. Really, I think equal amounts would have been an overpowering flavor.

I made this for breakfast this morning and followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. My husband loved it and I will definitely be making it again! We had it with applewood smoked bacon and fried eggs and it was fantastic.
