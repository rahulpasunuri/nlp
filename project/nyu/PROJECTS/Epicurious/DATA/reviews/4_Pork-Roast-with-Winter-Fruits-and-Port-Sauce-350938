Made with 18 oz. Pork Tenderloin. After stuffing and wrapping with 2 slices bacon, tied with kitchen string. I prefer bacon crisp so to cook just pan seared all sides on medium heat and then simmered, covered - about 20 minutes total. The fat from the bacon was a great base for the sauce. It turned out excellent.

I asked my butcher to "chime" the roast for me. Delicious I'm going to make it for New Years Eve

I made this last night for a party. I substituted cranberries for prunes and used tenderloins. We cut them and pounded them and then rolled 2 together to make 1 larger roast. The spiral of filling was pretty. It was a big hit.

Spectacular. Tastes amazing, plates beautifully. A perfect autumn main course  if Id not just made it, this would definitely be headlining our Thanksgiving meal.

I made this for a New Year's Eve party, served with the Mashed Potatoes with Celery Root and Mascarpone recipe on this site. A perfect combination. The pork roast with fruit and port sauce was a beautifully intense mix of flavours. Really delicious.

I served this with roasted carrot and an arugla salad. Looked beautiful on the plate and delicious the next day! I thought the dish was a tad to "jammy" from all the of the dried fruit though because I skipped the bacon to save on fat and calories. I think this was a crucial element that would have balance the sweet.

I have to give this a five out of four fork rating...I read reviews from others and was not sure it could be that great. The only change I made was adding cherries in addition to the other fruit. For anyone unsure about stuffing, I would use a boneless tenderloin, cut it part way through, stuff in between the top and bottom then sew it together or tie it with string. The sauce with fruit added is to die for!

This recipe was a last minute substitute for another recipe calling for a different cut of pork for our holiday meal. WOW! Am I glad we made the substitution. Luckily, we had just about everything we needed to make this dish. We substituted Turkish dried apricots for the California dried apricots and added cranberries along with the dried prunes. Since we were serving mashed potatoes, we used the stuffing leftovers to form the base of the gravy since we couldn't stuff it all in the boneless pork loin. With a little more port added to the dried fruit, we reduced it a bit more, and added some fat from the roast pork, a little chicken broth mixed with flour, and voila, we had ourselves a delicious tasking gravy. Everyone raved about the pork and how moist it was, and the gravy tasted amazing over the mashed potatoes. I just hope the next time I make it, it comes out just as fabulous!

Exceptionally good! This year's Christmas dinner was even better than last year's crown roast. I substituted figs for the prunes and it was delicious. Tasted even better as leftovers which is usually not the case for leftover pork. This one's defintitely a keeper!

This was very good -- I used the filling to stuff a pork tenderloin and served with some steamed broccoli and Wild Mushroom Bread Puddings (also from Epicurious). I reduced the amount of stuffing since I was stuffung a smaller piece of meat but another time I'd make the full amount because it would be excellent served alongside a chicken breast.

Rating: 4
So delicious. I'd suggest making and using 50 percent more stuffing. Also, t might be good to run the reserved stuffing through a food processor for 3 or 4 seconds before throwing it in with the port to make the sauce. Can anybody tell or show me exactly how I was supposed to wrap the bacon around the roast? I'm not sure the bacon added much, particularly since my roast already head a relatively thick layer of fat on the top.

I'm not a chef nor do I play one on tv. I'm basically a guy whose wife is an incredible home chef. I personally tried this recipe and it was an amazing success. More amazing, I couldn't find apricots so I replaced the required apricots with: dates, cranberries, dried cherries, and (of all things) lignonberries. The combination proved wonderful. I used only a 1.1 lbs pork tenderloin so I reduced the recipe by about 50 % (to have a little leftover). Liad 3 strips of bacon lengthwise along the top of the loin. 20 minutes at 500 and it was almost done. Four star restaurant quality.

This is company perfect! So-o delicious. I made it with a 1 1/2# boneless pork loin since I was serving only 2 persons. Since the roast was small, I partially browned the bacon before wrapping the pork and roasted at 325 degrees (skipped the 500 degree). Also did not need arrowroot to thicken port sauce because I reduced it. Served with sauteed spicy dandelion greens and roasted beets with cumin and mint (both recipes on this web site).

Great recipe, great dinner, and great left overs for a whole other dinner. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I had a 3 lb boneless loin, and thus used less bacon. I served it with carrot souffle and sauteed spinach. Absolutely delicious.

This was a delicious recipe. It was my first attempt at roasting pork and it was a huge success. I do have to warn that users should be careful when making the fruit and port stuffing. It doesn't sound like anyone else has had this problem, but I made the mistake of removing the lid from the stuffing pan while it was heating to stir. I was clearly distracted because anyone who has taken Chemistry 101 should know this is a bad idea- the whole pan went up in flames when the oxygen rushed in (due to the alcohol) and I end up searing my arm slightly. Keep the lid on during heating and do not remove until you have turned the flame off and the liquid has cooled.

just made this for my in-laws and it was a huge hit. I too butterflied,stuffed and tied. Wish I had made cross cut (even with the butterfly) to get more stuffing in the center. The two boneless tenderloins cooked pretty quickly. Next time I may broil for a shorter time to crisp the bacon and then move to center to cook at the lower temp. I wanted more sauce so instead of the arrow root I made a roux with the drippings and flour to thicken and also added beef broth and reduced. Then I mixed in the leftover fruit from the stuffing (I made extra). Delicious. I served it with a 7 whole grain blend cooked in chicken broth and little soy sauce then tossed with toasted olives. Also with green beans and garlic.

I made this for a dinner party, total of 6 people. It was a big hit and it looked very pretty wrapped with the bacon. My guests were actually getting up to get seconds:) The sauce was awesome and the stuffing was great too but the meat was not as flavorful as I was hoping... But I am always the biggest critic of my own cooking. Maybe it needs to prepped one day ahead. I served quinoa as a side.

A delicious dish with an impressive presentation for a dinner party. Based upon another reviewer's suggestion, I, too, added dried sour cherries to the stuffing...yummy!

For a more weeknight-friendly version, I skipped the gravy and bacon, and used a 2.25 lb boneless roast. It only needed half the stuffing. Delicious! (Because of what I had in the pantry, I replaced apricots and prunes with dates, golden raisens, and dried cranberries.)

Delicous, easy and beautiful on the plate. We used pork tenderloins (2) and omitted the bacon to cut down on fat. Our guests asked for the recipe and "cleaned their plates".

This was great, easier than I expected. I used a 4 1/2 lb boneless pork loin and had the butcher butterfly it for me. I used a medley of dried apricots, figs, tart cherries and prunes (nixed the bacon) and tied it with kitchen string as another reviewer suggested. Only took about an hour to cook. Served it with grilled veges and wild rice. Tasted great & nice presentation!!

If ten forks were an option that would be my rating. This recipe scored on every level. Easy, scrumptious and able to be made ahead. The only change I made to the recipe was that I brined the pork the day before in water mixed with herbs and equal parts of sugar and salt for 24 hours. All the sides are terrific too!

I was blown away by how delicious this was. It's the first time I've stuffed a roast, but it wasn't difficult at all. Though it is a wonderful holiday meal, it would delight dinner guests all winter long. I'll definitely make this again.

This recipe requires a good butcher. He cut the roast for us with a saw in order to make serving it a breeze. Very easy and impressive dish to serve to guests.

This is a terrific recipe, lovely flavors, great presentation and pretty easy to make. However, it does take longer to cook, about 25 minutes. We made two six pound roasts and they were cooked in two separate ovens; both roasts required the extra 25 minutes. Follow the directions, just plan on a bit more cooking time.

This was delicious. I used a boneless tenderloin to cut down on cooking time and used corn starch (couldn't find arrowroot at the store) with some beef broth.

Fantastic dish. I made with a 6 lb boneless pork loin, which I split down the side to stuff and then used kitchen string to tie together. Otherwise followed the recipe (1 1/2 x to serve 12, less cooking time for boneless loin) and it was a huge hit, not a bite left.

in answer to A cook - you can stuff it the day before but then you cook it for your dinner. At least that is what I would do - warming up a full pork loin would likely dry it out.

I'm fairly new at this and have a couple of quick questions--how best to make this dish the day before? Cook it all the way then heat up? And do you make the sauce ahead as well? Thanks!

Everyone loved this dish, especially the stuffing and sauce. I made this the night before which made it perfect for a dinner party so I could spend time with the guests and not in the kitchen. I used a boneless pork loin, and lowered the cooking time appropriately. Arrowroot made this a great dish for those on gluten-free diets. We will definitely be making this again. The result looks like a lot more work than you actually do.

This was delicious! I used two pork tenderloins, because it seemed simpler, and cut down on the cooking time. I wrapped bacon around the tenderloins, but they only needed to be cooked for about 45 minutes, so the bacon didn't get super done. It added flavor, but the dish probably didn't need the bacon, since there's a lot of butter in there, and lots of flavor already. The stuffing was enough for two tenderloins. It looked beautiful at the dinner table, and got rave reviews! I served it with a Brusssels sprout and carrot recipe I found on this site. It was a huge success!

Very nice entree, definitely worthy of serving for a nice dinner. I served this with whipped potatoes, baby carrots with a light dusting of b.sugar, asparagus with a squueze of lemon juice and fresh parmesan reggiano shavings over the top. Everyone loved it. Be sure you have a very good quality pork loin roast for this recipe. It would be a shame to have less than great meat with such a flavorful sauce and stuffing.

we just made this for our Sunday meal, it was delicious! I prepared it with a 3.5 lb 4-rib roast and cut ingredients by half. I was pleasantly surprised how well that turned out. I am also excited to hear that the leftovers taste just as good, because we have lots.

I am normally not a big pork fan. This dish definitely caught my attention. It is pretty labor intensive, but well worth the effort. I used a high quality applewood smoked bacon that really made this roast moist and flavorful. The fruity stuffing is a great compliment to the pork. I served with mashed potatoes, oven roasted baby carrots, asparagus, and the parmesan pull-apart rolls. Husband and guests loved the entire meal. This is a definite keeper!

I made this for dinner last night-- it was surprisingly easy. I used a ribless roast, so the cook time was very fast. I also used cranberries because i did not have apricots on hand. Even with the substitution this recipe is delicious! I will certainly make it again and hopefully often!

Solid recipe that received great reviews, even from my kids age 5, 11 and 13. I did this as a crown roast, simply tying it into the crown configuration. I would try to make the pocket as large as feasible to maximize the amount of stuffing. The prunes blend well with the other fruits and weren't identified specifically by the kids. Bacon was a nice touch, but I didn't think it was too important for flavor - more for presentation. The sauce might be better if finished with butter, and not simply thickened with starch....which is a an unnecessary short cut for a recipe that allows plenty of time to make a great sauce.

Made this for Christmas dinner and received enthusiastic raves from all my guests, including my four, hard-to-please teens. It's really quite easy to make, and looks quite elegant. I peppered the meat and lightly salted with Kosher salt before draping with the bacon (the bacon is a must to keep the meat moist and flavorful). I also used corn starch instead of arrowroot to thicken the gravy. Thinking the portions wouldn't be generous enough for my three teen boys and the 14 other guests, I mistakenly bought three, 7-rib pork roasts (from Costco. Excellent!). Each "chop" was a very generous 3/4"-1" thick, so we had lots of yummy left-overs. I would definitely make this dish again!

Making this the day ahead was a great idea. I used double smoked bacon so the meat picked up that lovely flavor. I recommend making the stuffing with prunes - wouldn't change a thing about this and will make it again.

Made Christmas Eve. Just ate the rest of the leftovers. Sooooo yummy and definitely holiday-worthy. Don't change anything - including the prunes! Figs would have added little seeds which IMHO would have been unpleasant.

Made this for Christmas Dinner and it was a big hit - several people asked for the recipe. I substituted dried figs for the prunes and added dried cranberries too. Next time I would cut back on the shallots for the sauce as the stuffing already has enough of that flavor which comes through nicely. Would also add more port to the final sauce.

This is an outstanding preparation for a relatively inexpensive cut of meat. I went a little heavier on the port in the sauce. Served over wild rice. Kids loved it too -- bacon was a big draw for them.

We brined the pork roast for 18 hours prior to stuffing. When we were preparing the stuffing we substituted the prunes with dried figs (make sure you remove the hard stems). We have one of those temperature probes which has a unit outside the oven so we didn't have to open the oven to read the temp. We turned the heat up the last half hour as we were worried that the roast wouldn't be done in time. This was the entree for our Gourmet group so we wanted it to be perfect. It was perfect. Several guests couldn't stop remarking on how moist and flavorful the meat was. We definitely will make it again.

I am going to cook the roast alone, and serve a stuffing on the side, but the port sauce helps tie it together..

Try another recipe,"Fig and Rosemary Pot Roast" for a similar but . . . better? pork roast. And read my review on that from 2006! Can't imagine cooking with prunes . . . or the after effects!

Excellent everyday recipe. Elegant, but simple to prepare and cook. Cheap too. Personally, I would leave out the prunes and substitute dried figs, but that's just a matter of preference.
