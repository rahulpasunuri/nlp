I thought this tasted heavenly. It was really delicious and the consistency was also really wonderful. Yum yum yum!

Well, I thought this was just good but son, daughter-in-law and mate thought it very good so this will go in the repertoire. Didn't make the swirl (added Skor bits instead) so I thought this was easy enough for a crowd pleaser. Sandra McNally Calgary/Panama/Edmonton

Loved this recipe. The ice cream was the best I have ever tasted. My carmel was also hard but it did soften over time.

Well, I'm the voice of dissent here. Flavor-wise, this tasted great. It was very rich, as others described. But, the big disappointment for me was that the caramel froze into big lumps. I didn't see that described elsewhere among the reviewers, but it happened to me. I didn't let it sit in the freezer for eight hours, so I'm not sure if that would have made a difference. I was eager to try this because it took a lot of effort--more than the standard ice cream recipe because it requires making two caramels. I really can't recommend this and won't make it again.

Finally a decent coffee ice cream recipe--the caramel base keeps the flavor from falling flat. I substituted the espresso powder with two espressos. I added organic walnuts and omitted the caramel sauce.

When I was in the middle of making this, I declared I would not be making it again. The sugar took far too long to melt. However, upon tasting the ice-cream, it immediately became a recipe to repeat. Not only is this the best homemade ice-cream I've ever tasted, it's the best coffee ice-cream I've ever tasted. Definitely worth the effort. I did skip the caramel swirl, and instead added brownie pieces. My husband and best friend couldn't get enough!

Gives Hagen-Daz a run for their money. VERY rich (used 4C cream because I forgot to use 1 C milk!). As suggested didn't bother with the swirl and used less coffee powder. Added crushed Skor bar and a few chocolate covered coffee beans. careful not to add too many bits as it will 'interfere' with the incredibly rich texture. One of the more labour intensive ice cream recipes - but oh, so decadent.

Delicious! Perfect consistency, easy to make. Caramel swirls are unneccessary. They sink to the bottom, become hard, and then when you eat them, they melt in your mouth and stick to your teeth (delicious, but not necessary). It's great as just plain coffee ice cream. Takes a while for it to harden, so leave time for it to chill.

We absolutely loved this ice cream recipe. For the reader who was wondering how she could rectify the problem of the caramel sinking to the bottom of her ice cream container: I added 1-2 tablespoon of whole milk to the caramel mixture after it had cooled to thin it out a little bit and it held it's own. I got a perfect caramel swirl in a perfect coffee ice cream. I too used instant coffe when I couldn't find espresso powder.

This is very good ice cream. The caramel swirl balances the coffee, which is quite intense. I add a little bit of water to the sugar when melting, it prevents scorching and just takes a little longer to caramelize. I didn't have instant espresso so I used regular instant--still very good.

We love this ice cream!! But it took us 3 tries to get it right. The recipe is deceiving and is harder than it looks. The melting sugar has to be watched VERY carefully or it will burn in a heartbeat. (Hence our three tries) As for the swirl - it tastes great but has two problems - 1. cream seems to curdle everytime leaving little lumps you can't get rid of and 2. it sinks to the bottom of the finished ice cream. Anyone have a solution? We definitely like this and will make it again and again in an attempt to achieve perfection!

I did not make the caramel swirl, but the icecream alone is out of this world!
