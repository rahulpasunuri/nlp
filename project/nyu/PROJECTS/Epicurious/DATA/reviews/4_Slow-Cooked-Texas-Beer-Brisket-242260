It sounds delicious but is definitely not kosher for Passover as suggested since the use of beer is prohibited

This was so EASY. i did the rub which was good but the best part was the fact that there is very little prep work for this recipe. I read the other reviewer who did the 8 hour cook. I put in the foil which i then placed in my dutch oven. I left it about 8 hours at 225 and when i came home it was done and so tender. i used some previously made barbeque sauce and it was really good with supereasy cleanup. next time i might try different spices and would a little more sugar to make it just a touch sweet.

If you get it off the original website, this is a delicious recipe. The best part is the "Hill Country Rub," which is omitted here. I've also cooked this in a crockpot on low for 5+ hours with a cup of beer, with wonderful results.
