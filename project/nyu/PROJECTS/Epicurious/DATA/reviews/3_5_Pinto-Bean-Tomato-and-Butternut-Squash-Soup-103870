This soup is drop dead delish. My husband loves it and so do I. It is a little thick today so I might have to loosen it up with some stock. It's also great to smear on garlic toast. Yes, I will make it again and again for the winter chills.

I had a big butternut, so I added extra garlic, more crushed red pepper and some cumin per a review. Don't skip putting fresh herbs on top (I had basil, but I'll bet cilantro would be nice too). This doesn't have a lot of "zing" but it's a nice, hearty soup for a cold day.

Did not like the butternut squash at all (and I love butternut squash)...in fact, I fished it out before I served the soup and skipped the blending part. Added one yellow squash and one small zucchini squash in smallish chunks during the onion/celery cooking part. Instead of oregano, used herbes de Provence and stirred in a spoonful of pesto to each bowlful. Also wilted a couple of cups of chopped spinach during the post-boiling, simmer stage. Super yummy with these additions.

I love this hearty soup, and just gets better as a couple of days go by. So healthy and fulfilling.

I've been vegetarian for 16 years and have tried several Moosewood recipes. None of which I have ever made more than once, because they have all been lame. This recipe was no exception. I made the recipe exactly as directed. It wasn't terrible but nothing to write home about.

SanFran Cook, this will all sound a bit complicated, but most of the time you'll be doing something else while the beans soak or cook. Persevere. The general rule is that any dried bean will give you 2x-3x the volume cooked. 2 15oz cans are approx 2c ea, or 4c total. So you start with 1 1/2 - 2c dried beans. Everything, except maybe split peas and lentils, needs to soak first. There are two methods: overnight and quick. Measure out your beans, find a white plate and scatter a layer on the plate, look over them for stones, misshapen, cracked or partially eaten ones. Dump sorted beans into a bowl or large sauce pan. Do another layer, until you've inspected all the beans. Rinse and drain twice to remove any dirt, dust or critters. Toss any beans that float. OVERNIGHT METHOD: dump the beans in a large bowl and cover with at least 2" of water. Cover with plastic wrap, or a plate. Let sit 8hrs. QUICK METHOD: dump the beans in a large sauce pan, cover with at least 1 - 1 1/2" water. Though not required, I also add flavorings here (getting a head start): 1tsp Kosher salt per cup beans, few grinds black pepper, one small bay leaf. Read many years ago that ginger helps reduce the gas, so I often add a quarter-sized slice of fresh ginger. Bring to a boil and let boil for 1-2 mins (longer is better for the bigger or heavier beans like chick peas). Cover saucepan, remove from heat and let stand 1 hr. Drain. Rinse, drain. You're now ready to cook the beans. Drain soaking liquid, and rinse. Try biting into one bean to see how hard it still it (most useful with quick method). Cover with water again, season if desired, bring to a boil, reduce to simmer, cover and cook until tender. Test the beans, skins will split on cooked beans if you blow on them when testing. They should be very tender and almost creamy (depending on the variety of bean). You do NOT want al dente here. Depending on the size and how hydrated they are, cooking can take 10-45 min.

Pretty darn good soup. Wife and 3 y/o loved it! Next time, I'll roast the squash, puree it with chicken stock and add it to the soup at the end, and not cook any with the soup. Peeling and dicing a butternut squash was not too fun (and I like that kind of thing). Added black beans, will probably add more next time. This recipe made a TON of soup; enough for two dinners. Will definitely make again.

QUESTION: Can anyone tell me how to make this recipe if I only have dried pinto beans, not canned ones? How would the measurement translate, and how would I cook them? I have never cooked beans of any kind before, so I don't know the basics of them. Sincere thanks to anyone patient enough to explain!

Delicious, full of flavor and very satisfying. Best of all, everyone including my 8 year old, loved it. He gave it a 10! I used rapunzel bouillon cubes and water, added 1 tsp cumin (as suggested...don't you LOVE these reviews?. I let it simmer on low for about 40 minutes to develope the flavors. I garnished with chopped cilantro and sour cream. Yum. I will make this again soon.

I made this soup last week as a filling,quick and low fat Friday night meal.We were not disappointed. It was called Spa Soup. I was so impressed I wanted to make it again but could not find the recipe. I thought it was in the December issue of Bon Appetite. I failed to find it in that issue and went on line...Thank goodness it was there. It is one I will make again and again. Nicer than chile but just as filling...

Bland, bland, bland. Ended up adding a few tablespoons of crushed red pepper and Italian seasoning to try and squeeze some flavor out of this soup. The fresh basil was fantastic, but not enough of an inspiration to make this again.

I don't know what the problem is. I was so excited to make this and followed the recipe exactly (I pureed all of it though, used chicken v. veggie broth, and added cumin as suggested). It is very bland and does not look appetizing. To help I added some tomato paste (I could not taste the tomato before) and some dry wine and this helped. Maybe it will taste better after it sits for a day. I will report back...

QUESTIONS: Would like to make this for in-laws at Thanksgiving, but the proportions seem off...only 4 cups broth? How many onions equal 2 cups, more or less (seems like a LOT). TWO cups of celery, really? I know that I'll just have to give it a trial run myself, but any advice BEFORE the holiday would be appreciated! THANKS (_giving, that is...)

Great soup! Hit the spot on a cold February night. I substituted chicken stock, cranberry beans and cilantro. That is all I had on hand. Next ime I may try a dash of cumin, as suggested by previous reviewers. All around delicious.

This was better than I thought it would be. I substituted the basil with cilantro and blended the whole thing with a handheld blender right in the pot. Next time I will add only 3 cups of broth to make it thicker-- was a little too watery as is.

Great soup! I did process the whole thing and it was great as a cream. I added some cumin and cilantro which went perfect with the beans and butternut. Loved it.

This is a wonderful soup! Very flavorful, colorful, delicious and healthy! I didn't have any basil, but next time I think I'd add cilantro rather than basil -- I think it would better compliment the spicy flavors of the soup.

I made this soup using almost all freshly prepared fruits/veggies from the garden. It was excellent! I did add some fried pepperoni because I didn't have bacon for a garnish. It was easier because I baked the squash in advance rather than peeling and boiling as the recipe recommends. Everyone was satisfied and that's the bottom line! Excellent with grilled sandwiches

Rating: 3
I didn't have any fresh basil so I added a dollop of pesto to each bowl before serving. I substituted cannellini beans for the pinto beans. It turned out a little thick so I added some white wine to thin it a bit. All in all, it was a hit - I'll definitely make it again - quick, easy and nutritious.

I thought this was good, but not as good as some of the best recipes I have gotten from this website. I followed the recipe pretty much to the letter, except that I used chicken broth instead of vegetable. I did not remember the picture of the soup from the web site, and it seemed to me the squash should be pureed, so I made sure I got most of it in my 3 cups for the blender. Next time I would probably leave more of it whole. And I might try cilantro instead of basil, and the touch of cumin recommended by one of the other reviewers.

This sounded great, so I tried it, but I think I would use some other kind of broth, rather than the canned vegetable broth that I bought. It gave the entire soup a tinny, canned flavor. I just wasn't impressed.

My husband loved this dish, and it was so easy and cheap to make. I omitted the celery, and used garlic roasted chicken broth. Also, I used a can of garlic roasted tomatoes and then cut down on the chopped garlic. And I used dried navy beans that I cooked before hand and had in the fridge, instead of pinto. Great winter soup.

This turned out very well. I bought a can of diced tomatoes that already had garlic, basil and oregano in it, so that simplified things greatly. I wasn't shy about adding salt and pepper, and my 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes was a generous one. High marks as comfort food on a cold winter evening, especially with a simple lettuce/avocado salad and a tangy vinaigrette. Oh yes, cornbread too!

This is a great recipe. I did change it a bit. I used chicken stock and because I hate to peel squash I roasted it. I pureed most of the pot, and then because I really like them, added a can of butter beans. Oh, I did not have a can of diced tomatoes, so I used a can of stewed. It turned out wonderful.

My very picky kids loved this soup--and so did my husband and I. It's great on a cold day! We didn't have any fresh basil on hand, and didn't miss it. I served it with split french bread rolls brushed with garlic and olive oil. YUM! A keeper.

Very tasty and healthy soup. I was amazed at all the flavor. Could skip the basil - it was an OK addition, but I wouldn't buy it special for this dish - would only add it if I had some in the herb garden. Will make this again and probably puree more than the recipe says.

My husband and I both loved this soup - he actually said it was the best bowl of soup he ever had! It was so good and nutritious and easy to make - I like the idea of pureeing just some of the soup so that the texture was thick but there was still lots of nice chunky veggies too. It was even better the next day and I think the basil was a nice addition. This is a great winter soup!

From the reviews I thought this would be fabulous but I have to say I was very disappointed :( The flavor of the soup was good but the texture and consistency were horrible. I ended up eating one bowl and tossed the rest. I think the blending of the soup really ruined it but I don't think I would have like it much even if I left out this step. Sorry but I would never make this again!

The cooking time that the recipe specifies does not allow the celery to get as soft as I prefer it for a soup. Next time I make it I will very thinly slice the celery and perhaps cook it longer. Otherwise, a wonderful weekday meal.

I made this for four other people, and they all swooned! I thought it was a bit thick, even though I pureed more than they said to because we like a smooth texture. I also used chicken stock instead of veggie and will use more next time (it barely served 5 of us as a first course). A fortunate mistake: I forgot to get celery, so I subbed three large carrots that I had on hand and they worked great and added flavor and color! Next time I may try using acorn squash instead of butternut.

This is an excellent soup recipe. I would skip the fresh basil next time. For some reason, it didn't seem to go with the soup in our opinion.
