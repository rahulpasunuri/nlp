OK, but nothing special. Not enough spices, so try using more cinnamon and cloves. Somewhat too sweet, especially with all the heavy dried fruit, so be sure to reduce the sugar. Perhaps using all fresh fruit would be better. Then again, I didn't like the incongruous mix of fresh and dried fruit; it didn't seem to work. I didn't pair this with ice cream (substituted something else), but expect that the large and disparate chunks of fruit would be clumsy to pour and eat over ice cream with a spoon. A berries compote seems like it would be more appropriate.

This is a delicious dried fruit compote. We found that half the recipe with 375 ml bottle of Essencia was more than enough to serve with the ice cream recipe.
