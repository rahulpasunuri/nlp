NO quality control on recipe before printing? No BAKING TIME LISTED FAILED TO GIVE INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT WHAT TO DO & WHEN TO ADD EGG WHITES WHEN BAKING CAKE!! If I were a novice cook, my cake would have been a disaster. Fortunately for me, I am a better cook than Epicurious is a proof-reader!!

Truncated instructions, so I beat the egg whites to stiff peak and folded them in. A dense, but not dry, cake. My old fashioned plain tin pan had the layer cooked in 20 minutes; the two non-stick pans OVERBAKED! Not sure I would leave a whipped cream-filled cake out for 3 days! FUN icing to make! Beautiful to behold.
