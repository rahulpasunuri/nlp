Easy recipe to individualize if serving a group with mixed preferences (meatless, no onion, etc.). Adding 1-2 T. white vinegar to the water helps eggs keep their shape. If you assemble the night before, give pan enough time to get to room temp; otherwise the cheese will be hot and bubbly, but the inside lukewarm.

Tasty and pretty. I cut everything up the day before, so all I had to do was assemble while I poached the eggs. Word of warning: It's easy to burn the edges of the brioche if you leave them in too long... FYI, I was able to find brioche at Trader Joes, but not at my Ralphs store.

I made this for a large brunch. Everyone loved it. I substituted smoked salmon for the ham on half the batch for my non-meat eating friends. My only problem was that it was much more time intensive than I realized and I spent most of my own brunch in the kitchen.

Easy and yummy when hosting a brunch for many people. I left out the red onions, added onion chives and used gruyere.

My first time poaching eggs. Pretty simple. I made this as part of our Easter brunch (also made the overnight french toast recipe from this site which is also delicious) They turned out wonderful and this recipe is delicious. I used white cheddar and swiss. Very tasty -- would serve to company.

Made this for Easter brunch for 6. Excellent! I've never made poached eggs before, but after watching the video instructions available on epicurious.com it was actually pretty easy. Although some of the eggs turned out "ugly", you don't see them once they are covered in cheese. I made everything in advance and just broiled it at the end. The only problem is now I want this every weekend.
