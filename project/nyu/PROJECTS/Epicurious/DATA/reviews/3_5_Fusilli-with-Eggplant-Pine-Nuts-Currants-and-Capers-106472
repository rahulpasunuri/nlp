I really enjoyed this recipe. I substituted raisins for the dried currants because that's what I had on hand. I also added some Balsamic Vinegar. The toasted pine nuts really make this dish. I will definitely make this again.

I would not have willingly chosen this recipe for our quarterly cooking club because of the weird mixes, including capers. But I made it and it was amazing. Two hints I got from the chef who chose the menu: 1) use Chinese/Mexican/Japanese eggplant (long skinny kind, goes by many names) and you won't have to peel it. 2) do NOT add cheese to the overall dish - that's the cause of the dryness. Just add to individual servings. I also made a variation which was great too: spinach fettucini (sub fusilli), 1 pt cherry tomatoes (sub diced tomatoes/eggplant), toasted pepitas (sub pinenuts), balsamic vinaigrette, pesto.

Amazing! One of the best things I've made all year (and I cook every night)! I used only one eggplant and adjusted the other ingredients accordingly, and it was enough for 3 large servings. Don't leave anything out of this recipe---I know the ingredient combination sounds weird, but everything works together. And it was even better the next day.

I was almost scared off by the few bad reviews, but I'm glad I made this. It was interesting and flavorful and not at all weird. I did add the red wine and some extra tomatoes and it was still a little dry, so maybe more tomatoes next time.

Very good, and if you skip the cheese, it's vegan. I served the eggplant mixture over bulgur wheat instead of pasta, just for a change. It was v. tasty.

I really enjoyed this recipe despite being a little wary when I first read it. I halved the recipe and added a little red wine near the end when it was simmering. Other than that, I followed the directions exactly. The combination of capers and currants was interesting and pleasing mixed with the other, more common combination of flavors. I'll definitely make this again - especially because it was quite easy to prepare.

I served this to friends last night and it was well received. The currants really set off the salty capers. As others have noted, it is a dry sauce, so I added 1/2 cup of red wine after the onions and garlic were sauteed, and 1 cup of vegetable broth while simmering. I finished it with a few tablespoons of heavy cream before serving, which added a nice mouth feel. Will serve again!

Good, but not a dish for a picky eater. For me there are too many capers in this: I'd half them next time. I don't feel that the currants added much flavor (I'm munching the leftovers as I write this and I can barely taste them against the tomatoes.) Use the biggest pan you possibly can to cook the eggplant as there is a HUGE amount of it and it is difficult to get it to cook evenly. I made this because I was having vegetarians over and they all really enjoyed it. The pine nuts are a nice touch. Next time will add half a can or a can of diced tomatoes that have been further chopped in the blender.

My boyfriend and I made this last night, and though I knew it would be a little different (based on the comments and just looking at the ingredients) I wasn't sure if I really cared for it. But I had the leftovers today and they were GREAT. My advice is to make it a day ahead--the unusual flavors need time to settle a bit.

This was really delicious. The combinations of flavors and textures is wonderful and takes no time at all to make. Goes into the recipe binder for sure!!!

Okay, this is a weird pasta dish. There's nothing wrong with it but there's nothing particularly right with it, either. I had all of these ingredients on hand, so this was a weeknight dinner solution, but it didn't come together as anything--a somewhat tasteless mishmash of stuff. I probably will make it again when I am desperate on a weeknight but it's not going to become part of my repertoire.

Excellent recipe...makes a LOT of pasta. I only bought one large eggplant (I couldn't find two small enough)and that was more than enough! Very filling and be sure to toast the pine nuts carefully and let them cool totally before adding them...but lovely. Very nutty, mediterranean taste.

This is an incredible dish - I've made it often, mostly for dinner parties, as the rave reviews keep on coming. Used a jar of Vincent's marinade instead of tomatoes. Dried cherries instead of currents, REALLY kicks this up a notch - fabulous

My boyfriend made this last night, and I was wary of the ingredient combination. We halved the recipe, and aside from adding about 3/4 can of tomato juice at the very end, followed the directions exactly. It was delicious! All of the flavors compliment each other really well. I don't think you could leave anything out without the dish really losing something. Would definately make it again with vegetarians coming for dinner.

Ick, this was a really creepy combination of flavors. It was palatable, but I was upset that I'd wasted my time and quality ingredients to make this troubling blend of flavors!

Rating: 3
I agree that these ingredients sound odd, but they really work together. I followed the directions til I was nearly finished cooking. I loved the smell, but ended up adding some spagetti sauce like a previous reviewer to have some sauce with the chunks. My husband and daughter enjoyed this pasta dish. I didn't have any fresh basil, but will certainly include this when I do.

I just made this as the vegetarian option for a meal for 40, and I think it was perfect. The flavors meld together so that you don't taste individual currants or capers, but the whole dish together. I did do a couple of things different. First, I cubed the eggplant, tossed lightly with salt, let sit in the fridge over night and poured off the juice that comes out before sauteeing. I also make a strong effort not to overcook the eggplant. Finally, I cooked the pasta al dente, mixed with the vegetables, covered with foil and put it in the fridge. Then I popped them in a 375 degree oven for 30 minutes with the foil on. Then I took the foil off, sprinkled with the extra cheese and put them back in for another 15 min (or until the cheese gets toasty). With this method you can make the dishes ahead of time and still serve them hot. On final admonition--the recipe gives huge portions. I multiplied by 5 to serve 40 and it was way way too much. But hey, its tasty leftovers!

I'm not giving this any forks b/c I didn't follow the recipe so perhaps that's why it sucked. I think my problem came because I added the currants and the capers after I had sauted the eggplant for only a couple of minutes and thus dulled their flavor. This recipe is based on a Sicilian recipe and I've been told it's wonderful. So no disrespect to the recipe, I just probably screwed it up. It was so bad that my husband labeled it "shrog"--not a compliment. He ate it but we threw out the leftovers.

My friend Marcia who won't eat raisins thought the currants were delicious and had a third helping. A perfectly great vegetarian meal and easy to prepare.

My thanks go to all the reviewers before me. Was looking for something different to do with eggplant and this surely is it. We have to be on a low-sodium diet, so I skipped the salting; others said the dish was dry so I figured it was worth a chance. I held back on the juice from the tomatoes a bit and it worked out fine. Opens up a whole realm of other possibilities...

What a wonderful, unusual vegetarian recipe! My adventurous daughter suggested making it and I thought my husband would not want to eat it. He loved it as much as we did! We used canned stewed tomatoes and whole wheat or kamut spiral pasta and it tastes fantastic!

Wonderful flavor. I ate the leftovers for days. Relatively easy to make. I used yellow raisins in place of the currents which worked fine. Pine nuts add interesting texture. We plan to share this with friends at our next monthly pot luck dinner!

Tastes much better than it sounds - quite delicious, actually. I had to add some plain tomato-basil sauce to make it a little more saucy. It was a little dry as is.

This dish made our palats very happy. Loved the contrast between different textures and flavors. I used sunflower seeds in place of pine nuts, and served it with steamed lobster and broccoli.

This is a good dish but not a great one. It's quite expensive although easy to prepare. For all the ingredients, the varying tastes just don't meld all that well. May make again but would use more olive oil since the sauce is a bit dry and doesn't seem enough for sauting the onion, garlic and eggplant.

Just loved it even though I had to make a few substitutions: golden raisins and toasted, chopped pecans for the currents and pine nuts. I don't think it hurt the flavor at all. Easy and tasty; do try!! KIMBER

I absolutely love this recipe! The flavors blend together beautifully and it tastes just great! I come from a very rooted Italian family, and my Uncle told me that this was one of the best pastas he has ever had! Definitely a recipe to keep close by!

Mmmm. I made this tonight for my carnivorous family, and it was uniformly well received. It tasted good too! I like eggplant, some here don't, but everyone enjoyed this recipe.

Healthy, an electic combination of flavors, and easy to make. I also used a zucchini in place of one of the eggplants. Unfortunately, half the guests I served this to were big-time carnivores, or picky eaters who weren't into eggplant and basil (so they picked them out). Their loss, and more leftovers for me :)

I've made this dish several times now, and each time have gotten rave reviews, even from less-than-adventurous eaters. A couple of times we substituted zucchini and yellow squash for one of the eggplants, and I think it tastes just as good.

Very good. Tasted like the Sicilian appetizer Caponata. I used 28oz.can plum tomatoes and cooked the eggplant longer. Next time I'll go easy on the pignoli.

This is a great combination of flavors and was very easy to make. I did add some more tomato and eggplant so that the sauce would go a little further -- I was making 2 lb of pasta. The capers and currants taste great together. I will definitely make again!

I made a dish for 2 with some modifcations, salting the eggplant heavily and covering the saucepan completely, partly steam-cooking it, a procedure I have oftened relied on in preparing aubergine/pasta dishes. Threw in some julienned red bell pepper needing to be used, did not use pine nuts. I used a whole onion (proportionately more than this recipe calls for) which caramelized while cooking with the aubergine. Instead of basil, I used a hint of fresh spearmint from my garden for a Sicilian feel. Comforting and very, very yummy.

Unique, tasty, lovely, and very well received! This was a really wonderful change - something new for when you tire of the basic summer-tomato-basil pasta dish that everyone seems in a constant effort to perfect during the warmer months. Try this, you will not be disappointed! Served it with the grilled country bread with garden vegetables and the potato salad with olives, tomatoes, and capers also from this issue. An almost exquisitely tasty meal!

This was great. Exactly as written. Looking forward to the leftovers. Will definitely make again.

The only change I made was to use fresh roma tomatoes instead of the canned. It was excellent! and very unusual with the combination of capers and currants. Good warmed up leftovers too! I can't wait for my garden to produce some fresh eggplant and tomatoes.
