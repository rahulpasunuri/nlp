This gorgeous cheesy-herby-winey cloud made a perfect Christmas brunch! I stuck very close to the recipe, with three minor substitutions: shallot for garlic; a raw cow's milk cheese from Fromagerie Blackburn in Quebec in place of Gruyere; and I used grated parmigiano reggiano to coat the buttered souffle dish, including all the herbs in the mixture. The deflated leftovers were yummy for Boxing Day breakfast too! This was my first souffle in 20 years and it turned out perfectly.

I made the recipe as written. After baking for 35 minutes, the top was golden but the insides were runny. The souffle was not filling enough for dinner, even with a generous salad. I would have preferred to eat the yummy cheeses with some nice bread and saved all of the fuss.

This was very good, but next time I'd serve it as a side dish rather than a main course as I chose to do. I coated the dish with grated Parmesan rather than thyme leaves. A goat cheese and herb souffle on this site calls for some red onion. To the present recipe, another time I'd add a small amount of sauteed shallot or green onion. The best cheese souffle I've tried from this site is the one calling for smoked gouda cheese, which is a real standout.

Loved it!! I always thought souffle's were too difficult to make, but not this one. Everyone raved about it. It was even good cold the next day. Give is a try.

Very impressive! In San Francisco there is a lovely restaurant which exclusively serves the most divine and airy souffles. I was certain this souffle wouldn't hold a candle to those at the restaurant, but I was pleasantly surprised! For the most impressive effect, be sure to serve the souffles immediately after removing them from the oven. I'll probably use this recipe as a base for other souffle variations: raspberry, broccoli, etc.

This souffle had so much flavor! It was easy to make, but give yourself time for the mincing and grating. I coated the dishes with thyme leaves, but don't think that it made a big difference. This was great!

Excellent! Very light and fluffy with a well-blended cheese flavor. A big hit as a side dish at Christmas dinner

I made these Easter 2000 and they were a hit. They were also easy to make. I used bread crumbs to coat the dishes instead of the thyme leaves. Will definitely make again.

I've made this a few times, and it's always gotten wonderful reviews. My only suggestion is to save yourself the effort of coating the pan with thyme leaves. The dish has wonderful flavor without them, and they have a tendency to come close to burning.
