So, maybe this isn't for the inexperienced cook, but with a little creativity in the order of doing things, it actually doesn't take more than an hour of active time, and it came out REALLY good. And a lot healthier than most potpies. You certainly could use leftover turkey and canned stock, but this isn't hard, and it's yummy, and I didn't have leftover turkey yet anyway. The point of cooking can in fact BE the cooking. The comfort food that came out at the end is a bonus. :-) Some modifications: Use the leek in the filling and the onion in the broth. Use two bay leaves and some thyme in the broth. Double both the thyme and pepper in the filling. Cut up the turkey pre-cooking (but still put all of it, bones included, in the pot). It will go faster. Basically, if you like warm and gooey comfort food in the winter and enjoy the process of cooking in a cozy kitchen while it's icky outside, this recipe is for you. If you're going to gripe about it taking too long and being too bland b/c you couldn't improvise to your taste, skip it.

Somewhere in the 10th hour of making this recipe, which involved organic turkey legs and the full thrust of a modern foodie's pantry, I just thought-we've lost touch with the original purpose of such pies, namely to use up leftovers/stretch inexpensive ingredients to a homey meal. There must be a way to use ready-made stock, for instance (mine wasn't so flavorful that it seemed justified to take the time). Or use existing ingredients (cooked vegetables) and/or stew that you have on hand. Crust was fine. In the end, we ate this over a couple of days and mostly appreciated its home-cooked meal quality. If I did it again I'd use more seasoning.

I already had homemade turkey stock in the freezer, so the recipe wasn't so time consuming. I would use only one carrot. The filling seemed a little sweet. I would also prepare the flour as a roux, then follow directions. The crust recipe was not particularly good.

Why not make it simpler and prepare the stock in the slow cooker overnight.The stock could then be strained, the meat chopped, and defatted. This also could be a good start to soup!

Sorry, I haven't made this recipe, but it looks like too much work. There's another one on this site that my family loves - turkey potpie with rosemary and herbed dumplings. Uses cooked turkey (or chicken or whatever) and is fairly quick to make.

The recipe as printed in the January issue of Gourmet calls for 2 quarts of water for the stock. I'm not sure why that was omitted on this site, seems kinda important to me.

Followed recipe exactly and thought that it was very bland. Definitely needs a lot more seasoning and spices.

How much water are you supposed to use to make the turkey and stock???
