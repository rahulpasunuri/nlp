These are FABULOUS! There is no other word to describe how delicious they are. And soooooo versatile! Your house smells amazing, and they are suuuuuuper easy to make, as long as you have a few hours to kill. :) I usually start them in the morning and let them slow cook all day. Great spread on crusty bread or tossed in with italian sausage. LOVE!!!

I make this every summer when a neighbor brings me tomatoes. It's outstanding on toasted baguettes and goat cheese. It also elevates home made macaroni and cheese to a new level!

Best ever! We love them on their own, they are a great addition to so many recipes, You are only limited by your imagination! What a treat in the dead of winter!

These were very good. The preparation is very easy, but I felt that the roasting was tedious. I had the smell of tomatoes and garlic in my house for 7 hours--at first it was great but then it got to me. Nevertheless, these were really tasty and yielded a lot, so we'll be able to enjoy all week.

Fabulous. I make this all summer long with any decent tomato that I can find, the Roma hold together like a tomato, but other tomatoes are also great. The other tomatoes have a great deal more moisture and the fall apart, but I use them as an ingredient in anything and everything. I also freeze them to have a taste of summer sunshine in the winter.

Yowzers!! This is great. I made with Grape and Roma tomatoes, then put it over pasta with some Romano Cheese. You could put this on saw dust and it would be the best tasting stuff ever.

This was the first time I had ever tasted this style of tomato. I am making another batch as I type this. These are wonderful. Have eaten with goat cheese, used on pizza and salads. They will become a staple in our home.

My favorite Italian restaurant serves a swordfish dish with "overnight" tomatoes. They explained they roast the tomatoes overnight in a low heat oven, which makes them very sweet. This recipe produced tomatoes exactly like the restaurant kind I love! I had purchased 20 large plum tomatoes at 10 cents each at the local grocery store (they weren't even great summer tomatoes), but slow roasting them made them oh so sweet. I plan on using these with sauteed chicken...in pizza sauce...bruschetta...

Move over sun dries tomatoes! Just kidding, but these are absolutely delicious. Just finished this evening and after they cooled I wanted to taste just one. Couldn't stop eating them. We are haveing a large cocktail party on Dec. 29th and these will be on the table in some way or another. This is absolutely one of the best recipes for tomatoes. Many ways they could be used. Do try this. Cook full 8 hours for max flavor.

Not worth the time they took to make.

If you have lots of tomatoes: use this recipe, run them (with the garlic) through your food mill, then and add cream (or lower fat alternatives) to make the most delicious tomato soup you've ever had. Adding fresh basil to the roasting makes it even better.

I've been making these since the recipe was printed. I now tell all my tomatoe-growing friends that I can use unlimited quantities of tomatoes. I use them all kinds of ways: on toasted baquette slices with a sprinkling of cheese, with pasta, mixed with other vegetables...I gave a friend of mine a jar of cherry tomatoes roasted this way (don't split them, roast them for 4-6 hours) and she told me that she ate the whole jar like candy before she had a chance to try cooking with them!

Fabulous, easy, and makes those plastic winter plum tomatoes delicious; it's like a miracle. Good to chop into a pasta, great on toast or a bagel. Much easier cleanup if you put them on parchment paper to roast.

Delicious. I used all 12 of my end of summer garden grown tomatoes and froze the final results. I bring out a few of the tomatoes the night before to thaw in the fridge and then use them for pasta sauce, stew (irene's beer stew), rice, etc... I will defintely continue to make this recipe.

Great stuff! We added some fresh minced chiles from the garden to some of them, froze them in layers separated by waxed paper, and used them all winter long for pasta, pizza, and crostini.

These are wonderful. I roast the tomatoes, then chop them up to toss with some freshly steamed couscous. Divine!

So easy and so delicious. I used this with the snap pea and cucumber salad with a walnut dressing along with barbecued salmon and it was a huge success. I have also cut up the tomatoes and served them on french bread toasts as an hors d'ouevres - absolutely wonderful.

This is one of the most delicious recipes for tomatoes I have ever tasted. We had a abundant crop of tomatoes this year, and I made this recipe at least twice a week. I served it as a vegetable with dinner. EXCELLENT!!!!

This is a very easy recipe but such a treat...We have made this several times and have altered the cooking time (extending) and have found a different taste each time...Always excellent!!

Truly outstanding for such a simple dish. Many uses-pastas, salads or my favorite-alone with a bottle of wine!

Absolutely wonderful!!! Very intense but extremely mellow. I used 7 different varieties of heirloom tomatoes from my garden. This would be excellent on pasta, polenta, or as a base for a simple minnestroni. I am going to use all surplus tomatoes in garden in the recipe and freeze for winter....then dream of spring while I eat them.

This is delicious on toasted french bread, as an appetizer.
