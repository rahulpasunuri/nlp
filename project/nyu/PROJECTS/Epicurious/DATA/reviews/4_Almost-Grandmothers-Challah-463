it worked really well. it's a tad on the dry side, but I think that's because I had to be somewhere during the 3rd rise, so instead of rising for 1/2 hour it rose for 3 hours. And it was hot when I made it (in the 90s), so it rose a ton (you could barely see the braid). But even with that it's good! Mods to the recipe: -I used a full cup of sugar -I used instant yeast instead of active dry (1.5 T of instant) -I subbed a cup of whole wheat flour because I ran out of all-purpose. -I probably used about 8 cups of flour, and it was still a bit sticky. But I read somewhere that challah dough should be a bit sticky so it doesn't dry out -I baked it at 400 for 10 minutes as it said, but then only 20 at 350. That was a good amount of time. -I had to tent it after the 10mins at 400 so the top wouldn't darken too much. Things I would do differently next time: -Add a touch more sugar, or maybe honey. It's a touch sweet, but I like mine sweeter -Do the third rise for only 30 minutes -Do 2 coats of egg wash. One right after braiding but before the 3rd rise, and one right before I put it in the oven.

I've just pulled two of the most impressive looking challas out of the oven that I've ever baked. I couldn't wait. I had some. It was DELICIOUS! I did find that I had to add quite a bit of extra flour to get it to a proper dough-like consistency but this could be because I was converting to metric. A great recipe. Thank you!

I would not change a thing. This recipe turned out amazing, we made Monte cristo's with it the next day by just putting Ham and Swiss between two slices dipping it into french toast batter and grilling on each side, then dipping in warmed maple syrup, quite decadent.

I followed the recipe exactly, but only did two risings: one for 1.5 hrs then again 30 min after braiding. It came out perfect!

I've made Challah for the first time using this recipe. The Cantor of the local synagogue liked it alot (though he said it was a little "crumbly"). I've decided to use this recipe every week. P.S. This bread rises amazingly well when using a six-braided method that I learned from a video via this blog: ChaiTime at wordpress.

I love this recipe so much! I made it for my boyfriend for our first Chanukkah together. I'm not Jewish, and hadn't made challah before, so I was super nervous, but it was really easy and turned out beautifully. Now he (and the friends we have round for dinner) regularly request it.

I have tried this bread a number of times, and so far it seems to work best with parchment paper and the 350 baking time reduced 10 min. It has been taste-tested by my Jewish friends with only good reviews and requests for the recipe.

I was so frustrated with this - I followed the recipe exactly and the bottom was burned and it was dry and the crust was way too crisp. Nothing light and airy and sweet about it. What a disappointment and waste of ingredients.

This is a great recipe! For a tiny bit more sweetness and moisture, I substitute one of the egg with a banana and blend with a hand blender to make sure there are no banana chunks left. The bread doesn't actually taste like banana at all. It's our favorite bread.

As my partner said, this was "pretty good." It tastes like typical homemade challah. We like ours sweet, so I would add more sugar next time. Better was the "My Challah" recipe on this site, which produces a denser dough and a tighter braid.

I make just one loaf (all that white flour is heavy) and add dried fruit/raisins for texture and addiitional sweetness. I also bake it for the given time at 350 degrees, and extend the first rising period to about 2 hours (due to forgetfulness) and omit the seond rising period. It turns our great whatever i do.

I am a relatively inexperienced cook and this was one of my first attempts at bread& it was so tasty! Here are some tips I have for future makers of this recipe: (A) I highly recommend using parchment paper on top of the baking sheet as opposed to greasing it Other reviewers warned that the bottom of the bread burns too easily and the baking time should be reduced. I followed these suggestions the first time I made the bread and, alas, my bread was not cooked in the middle because I reduced the baking time. Therefore, the next time I made the bread I placed it on a baking sheet covered in parchment paper as opposed to greasing the sheet and&voila! My bread was able to cook for the whole time without burning on the bottom. (B) This recipe calls for 3 rises of the dough. The first time I made it I let it rise 3 times and I found the bread did not rise enough on the third try. The second time I made it I only let it rise 2 times, increasing the rising time of the first rise to 1.5 hrs and allowing it to rise the 2nd time until it had doubled in size (about 1 hour). Because I did 2 rises, I braided the bread after the first rise and let it rise the second time in braided form on the baking sheets&and it rose beautifully. (C) If you are an inexperienced bread maker, like me, and want to learn how to make a 6-braided challah, I highly recommend this video: http://thsprague.blogspot.com/2006/09/video -braiding-six-strand-challah.html. It is an excellent demonstration of how to make it! Good luck in all of your bread making endeavors!

this recipe's great! i followed all the other reviewers' advice and made half the recipe. i left the bread out for 4 hours to rise at room temperature because my car repair took longer than i thought it would. the resulting bread had this great complex flavor, but was not at all sweet. since i love sweeter challah, i think the next time i'll add a 1/2 cup more sugar like one person said. the bread baked at 350 for 25 minutes, and i think the next time i'll bake for just 20-23 mins. i had no problems with the bread rising, since i put the dough in the oven to rise with a pilot light on.

My favorite challah so far. Made full batch in Zoji breadmaker on dough cycle. It almost managed to mix and knead it all before being overwhelmed. I only had to take it out a knead in a little more flour by hand. Would have been fine if I had halfed recipe to make just one loaf. Did the double layer braid because it is pretty and impressive looking. Experimented with the two loaves on cooking time after reading other reviews. Used double form cookie sheets for baking both. One cooked at 400 degrees for five minutes and then turned down to 350 and watched it. Took it out at only 13 minutes when it was golden brown. (VERY moist and great flavor but not crispy on bottom). Second loaf I repeated the 400 degrees for five minutes but left it in about 20 minutes for a deeper brown crust. Slightly dry inside...which my husband thinks is often a problem with challah. Both were great, but I like the taste of the more moist loaf better. Will make again! On rising times...recipe directions were great but I used a warm, open oven to provide a warm setting for rising since it is a chilly day here. Challah is a time-consuming bread, but worth it on a weekend.

I have tried many challah recipes, but I really loved this one. I agree with others about the baking time: I baked the first loaf as directed, but the second one I baked at 350 the entire time and it came out much better. I also substituted Chardonnay for the 2/3 cup of water and instead of 3/4 cup sugar, I used 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 cup honey. It came out delicious!!!

I seem to be the only person that found the dough rose beauifully within the given time. However my loaves browned in 10 minutes! I had to cover them with foil and after 10 more minutes remove them from the oven. The bread has a glorious smell, texture and taste, but was a little dry. I feel like it baked too much, although for only 1/2 time stated in the recipe.

Rating: 3
Just finished making this -- did all of the kneading by hand (took a little over ten minutes). I agree with the other reviewers that most of the rising times should be a bit longer. I cut the recipe in half (using three eggs) and made four tiny loaves in mini loaf pans (half made four perfect sized loaves). Put the pans on a baking stone, and baked at 400 for 10 minutes and 15 minutes at 350, and they baked up perfectly. They are a little sweeter than I'd like, so next time I'll use less sugar, but I'll definitely make this recipe again. Very fun bread to make.

To "A Cook" on 10/6/05: Did you add all the water called for or just the first 1/2 cup? I have made this recipe many times without any problem, even with a variety of flours (all purpose, bread flour, and whole wheat). Please try it again; you won't be sorry!

I think this recipe has potential but as it stands, there is something very wrong. The recipe called for 7 and1/2 cups of flour-way too much, and the final result was thus very dry. The challah had a good taste, which is why i said it has potential, but it definately needs tweaking. I would not make this again!

As a deep lover of challah, I have tried many recipes and this is by far the best. It is flexible, easy, and delicious. I like to replace the sugar with a maple syrup (add extra) to give it an exceptional flavor. Make this; you won't regret it

Rating: 3
To the cook from Seattle, WA. If you're kneading this entirely by hand, it would DEFINITELY need more than 2 minutes kneading in order to get a more bready texture. More like 10-15 minutes! Knead until you're out of breath.

Rating: 3
More things I forgot to add to my previous note. I didn't bake it at all at 400, just 350 for 30 minutes. It didn't need any more. Why 400 for any part of the baking? Second, maybe it was the large amount of whole wheat flour I used, but it needed more rising time, both for the second and third risings. Third, for anyone who has had burnt raisins in a braided challah, an easy way to prevent them is as follows: When you divide the dough into three sections for braiding, pat each section into a long, thin rectangle. Sprinkle with raisins (and cinnamon, if you want) and then roll up tightly starting at a long end. Pinch the seams, and you have your three long cylinders ready for braiding with no exposed raisins to burn when the loaf is baked. Be sure to use lots of raisins! (You can also use this technique to make an apple challah for Rosh Hashanah, using diced apples.)

I have been looking for a challah recipe that can withstand a good amount of whole wheat flour, and this one can! I used 2 cups white bread flour and the rest whole wheat, plus a little extra sugar, since I also like a sweeter dough. I added cinnamon and raisins to one loaf, and my children have been gobbling it up. Most other challahs I've tried become dry and crumbly with a large proportion of whole wheat flour, but this one had a terrific consistency. A keeper.

dough is kneaded when you poke it with two fingers down to the first knuckle and it pops back all the way. If you want less complicated texture, knead untill it pops back most of the way.

Talk about moron-proof . . . I used two teaspoons of yeast (1 package) instead of the two tablespoons called for, and though it took twice as long to rise, the final result was still delicious! (I almost threw it out when I realized my error . . . we are very glad now that I did not!) I cooked it a scant 22 minutes at 350 which was exactly long enough. Quite tasty and clearly a very forgiving recipe.

Suggestions from a from someone who finally got it right on my 5th try: I halve the recipe but use 3 eggs to assure richness. It makes more than enough bread. Use regular (not rapid- rise) yeast, which helps mature the flavor with really slow rises. You've got to be sure the dough has truly doubled during each rise, and this takes about twice the time the recipe says (so you gotta hang out all day). Finally, really watch the baking time, and remove the loaves as soon as they look golden & done. And be generous with the egg wash: I find this moistens it up nicely, and the bread stays moist (if it survives) for the good part of a week. Hope this helps! Now you try!

This recipe was great. My dough took longer than 1 hour to rise - more like 1 1/2 - 2 hours. In fact, I threw out the first batch because I thought I did it wrong but then my husband suggested I give it more time to rise and it worked with my second batch. Definitely should only cook for 25 minutes at 350. Would definitely make again.

I made this for the Jewish New Year. I followed the directions of others and reduced the cooking time in my convection oven (7 minutes at 400 and then 20 for the rest). It made two large round challahs that looked great, but we all found the flavor was too sweet, and lacking depth. Maybe honey in place of sugar would have helped. Will try another recipe next time.

This recipe was great - very time consuming, but the result (especially the smell through the house) was worth it. Did anyone's challah come out slightly dry? I made the recipe the night before and halved it so that could be the cause of dryness. I will try this one again but will serve it the same day as made.

I've been making this challah recipe for the High Holidays for the last five years. It IS sweet, but that's traditional and we love it. One word of advice - if you have a professional oven (Thermador, Viking, or similar), the oven will not cool down from the initial high temperature and the challah will burn if you follow the directions as given. I bake mine at 350 and it comes out perfectly every time.

Rating: 3
Was initially disappointed that it was more dessert-y and less bready, but it does taste good for what it is. Not a big fan of the heavy yeast taste. I made a three-rope braid, and a set of maybe 18 basil-walnut rolls. The basil aroma was masked by the yeast, unfortunately. Next morning, the loaf tasted remarkably similar to my family's favorite egg bread from a bakery recently closed, so I think I'll try adding some rum-soaked raisins and more sugar next time. I made this recipe completely by hand (no appliances) and using extra virgin olive oil (all I had) so it was quite a workout! I also kneaded longer than 2 mins. I don't know if it would have tasted much different using vegetable oil. Also, as others have stated, watch the oven. It burns easily, and cooks in less than the 35 mins stated. My only questions are, how could I make it less yeasty-tasting, and more bready? By the latter, I am thinking of long strands of bread that flake apart, if that makes any sense. More kneading? That would produce more gluten, right? This was my first challah; I baked it to replicate some basil-walnut rolls that my favorite local baker makes since he uses a challah dough, and also to give to my mom, who eats nothing but challah all day.

Tasty but time-consuming. Baked it for 10 minutes less than the recipe called for, on a baking stone. My boyfriend and I each made a loaf and they looked great! It wasn't an easy recipe but then again it was my first challah. Keep an eye on it and make sure it doesn't burn, because the outside baked quickly.

This recipe is great! Don't be intimidated by the yeast or doing it manually (without a breadmaker) if you choose to go that route. My breadmaker is too small for the entire recipe and I didn't think to halve it at the time. It really doesn't take too much work, just a few minutes here and there to punch down, braid, etc. In the winter, I let the dough rise in the oven, turning it on/off occasionally or opening/closing the door as needed. I've made it a few times for dinner parties and people always love it. You know it's good when they continue to pick at the bread after they've gotten stuffed on pot roast (from Jacques and Julia At Home).

I've made this 3 times, and think I've finally got the knack. You have to add as little flour as possible, knead for closer to 10 minutes, then really wait till the loaves have fully doubled while rising (hard for us impatient folks). I also halve the recipe to make 2 smaller loaves--more than enough. These really are beautiful & tasty loaves--the braiding & egg wash make for a lovely presentation.

Wow! This was fantastic. I agree -- it is very similar to bread we had in Greece (or an Armenian bread my grandmother used to bake). You can add orange zest, seeds, or extracts to make delicious versions of this bread. A keeper. A note to the cooks who have had trouble with this recipe -- it is imperative to allow the bread to rise in a warm place. My kitchen counter wasn't, so after an hour of waiting I turned on the oven to 175 F, then turned it off, waited ten minutes and put my dough in the oven with the door cracked open. Voila!

I have made other challah recipes by hand and was wondering if any of you have found success with this recipe and a food processor method. -- Works just fine for pizza doughs, but haven't yet made the leap for something that requires this much rise.

This definitely replaces my old challah recipe, which often turned out a disappointingly flat loaf. With all that yeast, the dough rose beautifully -- I had to go out, so I stuck it in the fridge for about two hours for the second rise, and it worked great. I split the dough in two unevenly -- about a three-fifths loaf and a two-fifths loaf -- and did a four-rope braid for each. The smaller one, which I baked on a pizza stone, came out beautiful and perfect in about 25 minutes. I baked the larger one on a greased cookie sheet, but the oil smoked a bit and the bottom of the loaf ended up very dark even though the inside was still a little dough-y. Since I only have one pizza stone, I wonder how to make both come out well. Can one keep rising while the other bakes? Or has anyone tried freezing the raw dough?

To New Haven, Conn. Thanks for the advice..I tried it again this morning (third attempt at bringing a challah to my mom's house tonight) This time it foamed. but only on top and when I picled up the cup to pour it in..it mostly deflated...I don't have a thermometer...went to store this morning and they didn't have one..so I judge temp myself..how exact does it have to be? Is it o.k. just to have some foam on top of yeast and not on bottom..or does it all have to be foam...anyway it is more than an hour and it hasn't really risen very much..am going to give it another half hour instead of punching it down. Also on my last attempt I tried double acting yeast..is that bad?

To JJ from Woodbury, NY Your yeast was bad. You said your water may have been too hot. If so, you probably killed it, or your yeast may have been beyond expiration date and was dead already. Unfortunately, there is nothing you can do to salvage it. It will never rise. Sorry, but only thing you can do is start over from scratch again. Check your water temp - shouldn't be over 110F (lukewarm) and make sure to check expiration date on your yeast package. Better luck next time!!!

My husband likes soft challah with no real crust - I prefer a yeasty bread with a bit more substance. This challah was the perfect middle ground for us. Easy recipe - my 3 year old had a blast "braiding" her portion. Our best variation so far was to increase the yeast to 2 1/2 tablespoons, bake them on pizza stones and throw half a dozen icecubes into the oven to mist. We also like making 4 loaves instead of 2. (cut back the baking time to approx. 20-25 min @ 350)No leftovers. They freeze well

I was short of time so I baked it in loaf pans and baked it at 400 for 10 minutes, then I covered them with a loose tent of foil (so it wouldn't brown too much) and baked it for 30 more minutes and it was done just right - 180 degrees in the middle of the loaf. As I haen't made this before, I would assume it would freeze well. What do you think?

This bread came out very well. It was soft and sufficiently eggy with a nice sweet yeasty flavor. The bread was done earlier than I expected from the recipe. The loaves are big -- I snacked on challah and honey and had french toast for a couple of days as did the neighbor who I gave the second loaf to. I'm on a search for the perfect challah recipe for our shabbos dinners and if I don't find one better than this one, I'd still be satisfied.

I made sure I actually used a thermometer to make sure the water was at the correct temperature (to ensure the yeast would react correctly). I mixed the dough in my kitchen aid on speed 1 and used a *tiny* bit more flour than the recipe called for. I baked the loaves at 350 for 25 minutes -- they were a gorgeous golden brown and puffed up nicely. My sister in law made a challah that was a bit sweeter than this recipe -- maybe add a bit more sugar??

I've found that doing a four rope braid makes challah look good, but doesn't take the attention that a six rope bread does. Now, back to the kitchen...

The flavor of this bread is not as wonderful as the challah that we buy at a supermarket. The recipe was easy, but too big to fit in my Kitchen Aid Mixer. The dough got past the paddle and onto attachment shaft in which it made a mess there. So I had to watch the mixer constantly to prevent any more messes. As for baking the bread, I recommend skipping the two step baking. Just bake the bread for 35 to 45 minutes at 350 degrees. The bread got too brown during the first 10 minutes at 400 degrees. I baked the bread on insulated cookie sheets and the bottom got too dark too. Other than the flavor being off and difficulty making the bread, the bread is soft with a soft thick crust. I will make challah again, but only with another recipe.

I have long been interested in the foods of the Jewish tradition and I was not disappointed in this one. The bread was wonderful and my family cannot get enough of it. I made the traditional braids and the loaves were beautiful. I too took caution in the baking times as I wanted not to ruin them.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and it became a new staple for the table. This was my first attempt at challah and it still turned out great!

This is great bread. My kids and I made it 3 times the first 2 weeks,and we're doing it again today. I agree on watching it for overbaking. This also makes terrific rolls, if you bake it for less time, and it's fun to let the kids (or your spouse) make different shape breads. Only warning: Do NOT knead the bread at medium speed on your mixer. I had a brand new Kitchen Aid mixer and burnt out the motor. Read your mixer directions and follow them, rather than the recipe. Luckily I was still within warranty, but....The maximum speed is 2 for proper kneading.

This is an excellent recipe for challah. I agree with the other - keep watch of the bread while it's baking. It browned really quickly and the bottom got a bit too dark. The ropes were a good consistency for braiding. A trick to getting a nice looking braid is to slightly taper the ends and try to get the rest of the ropes as even as possible. I learned this from my grandmother and this recipe IS almost as good as hers.

This recipe was delicious! I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! The only recommendation that I have is to not cook it as long as the recipe suggests. I would recommend to keep checking on it until it is lightly browned and make sure the bottom isn't burning. It's an excellent recipe and I can't wait to bake it again!

Excellent recipe, just watch how long you bake the loaves. If you should have any left over, it makes terrific French toast.

This was my first challah, and I am so proud of myself. I tried a 6-braid as well as the 3-braid, and my advice to other novices out there is to stick with the 3-braid as my 6-braid sort of looked like a pile of intestines. Definitely don't bake it for as long as it says. It is delicious, and my husband who is Muslim is considering converting to Judaism if he gets his own challah from this recipe every Friday.

You don't need an electric mixer to make this recipe. I was very successful using a whisk, a wooden spatula and my own two hands! Delicious in loaves for sandwiches and french toast.

1 week later and my husband is still talking about how good this challah was. He even had me send the recipe to some of his friends.

This bread is wonderful. My family devoured it and so did our Sunday School class. Everyone wanted the recipe. As others said, bake a shorter amount of time, especially if using a dark pan.

Firstly, Let it rise as stated in a warm draft free place instead of fridge...Second DO NOT bake it on a black pan. The bottom burns too easily. This was the best challah recipe ever. I have tries at least 20 others.....For Rosh Hashana soak golden raisins in orange juice for 30 min. and add to batter...

Finally I baked decent Challah! It was soft and light and fluffy- I did add a little more sugar and yeast- and a little vanilla as well for flavor! I WAS PRETTY IMPRESSED WITH MYSELF!

I made this challah several times for my jewish preschool - the kids & teachers couldn't get enough! Definately cut baking time - especially if on dark pan! Enjoy!

This makes a great fluffy challah. I only used 5 cups of flour, however.

Excellent Challah.The baking time should be adjusted to a total of 35 minutes as 45 mins. burns the bread(at least in our oven).

I soaked about 1 1/4 cups of golden raisins in Grand Marnier and mixed them into the batter before adding the flour. I agree with the other reviewers that a total baking time of 45 minutes is excessive. My loaves were done in under 30. Delicious challah!

This was so delicious that I could hardly believe that I made it! The only caution I would give is to watch the baking time. When it is beautiful brown and sounds hollow to the thump, it's done! I think I only had to bake it 20 minutes. My whole family loved it. Enjoy!!!

This challah was an absolute hit! I come from a family of excellent cooks, who have appointed me to make challah for every holiday to come. It is a good thing the recipe is for two breads, becase the first one disappeared in 5 minutes. That night, people ate challah even with dessert.

The Challah's were very delicious. However if I were to have baked them the entire time stated, they would have burned.

Excellent! PERFECT challah. Unbelievably beautiful and yummy. Had to bake it a little longer, since middle wasn't perfectly dry, but then I wasn't exactly sure how long I baked it the first round. Enjoy!

I have been baking challah for more than 20 years and this is definitely one of my favorite challah recipes. It has a wonderful texture and tastes delicious!

I had know idea what this bread was going to be like, but it sounded very interesting. I looked up challah in the epicurious dictionary and that is what decided me to make it. I braided the loaves and they turned out really neat looking. I baked them on a baking stone and it gave the loaves a nice crust but not at all dry on the inside. The bread tasted wonderful. My house smelled wonderful also. It is a bread that is a winner in taste and appearance.
