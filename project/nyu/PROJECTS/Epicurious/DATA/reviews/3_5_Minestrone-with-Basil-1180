This recipe has amazing potential. It is easy, and with a little help, delicious. Add oregano, bay leaves, and replace the water with chicken (or veggie) broth. There is no need to go through the whole bean-soaking process. Canned are fine. It was a huge hit at my house and was even better the next day.

This is a very bland soup as is....needs spicing up.

This recipe is great every time. I used a lot more cabbage and pesto instead of just basil and it was terrific as usual. Don't forget to serve with hot sauce

Don't bother to use the dried red beans...like other reviewers, I found a can of red kidney beans to be a great substitute. I've also been adding bay leaf, oregano, parsley, a little bit of cayenne pepper, white pepper, and black pepper to the broth to make it more flavorful rather than substituting chicken broth. It makes the soup very filling and tasty!

So pretty! I made a variant with red quinoa (instead of pasta) and sweet potato (instead of russet). Omit the cheese and this is a hearty vegan dish. Vegans may want to use nutritional yeast for the cheesy flavor at the end but it's fine without it.

This soup is great but it needs a little adjustment: Use chicken broth instead of water and 1 can of kidney beans (rinsed) instead dried red beans. I finished it with a squeeze of lemon juice and salt. I sat down and ate two bowls in a row it's so good! Plus it made my kitchen smell phenomenal!

Always a big favorite whenever I make it. I use cole slaw if I can't get to the farmers market for cabbage and I always like to saute the onions. A little bit of pesto on the soup is a nice finishing touch

Not very flavorful. Next time I would add either a vegetable or chicken broth.

Put everything except the pasta, basil and zucchini in a crockpot for 8 hrs on low. Added the remaining three ingredients on high for 25 min after pureeing the potato. Nice easy dinner and very kid friendly to boot.

This was a really wonderful twist on one of my favorite soups. The potato idea sounded a little iffy, but I am glad I tried it - it was fabulous! I used some stew beef instead of the beans, simply for lack of soaking time (or any canned beans in my cupboard), added about 1/3 cup of red wine, and more carrots than this calls for, but otherwise the recipe was unchanged. It will definitely become a staple in my kitchen repertoire!

What a great way to make a creamy soup without extra fat! Using chicken and/or beef broth (I used a mix of both) instead of water adds flavor. I also used a 14-0z. can of Italian-style chopped tomatoes for the tomatoes and cannelini beans instead of kidney beans. Otherwise, followed the recipe and it was a hit.

YUMMY! I used 4 cups chicken broth, three cups of water, a can a white and garbanzo beans and added sliced mushrooms and portabella mushrooms. I just diced the potato and threw it in. Very good!!

Amazing! I used canned kidney beans and added garbanzo. I also added green beans and I did not peel the potato, to give it texture. Freezes well.

I made this for dinner tonight and thought it was the perfect thing for a cold winter night (we had it with Stromboli, also on this site). Made two changes: I used 1 c. of canned kidney beans, rinsed and drained, and 5 cups of chicken broth instead of the water. Also, I forgot to add the olive oil, so I added it to the blender at the "puree" step. It worked out fine. I love pureeing the potato; it makes the soup seem really creamy without adding any extra fat. I'm having overnight guests next week who like to eat very healthy, so I'll be making this again.

I made quite a few changes. I used veg broth instead of water. I also added green beans, spinach, and tomato sauce and paste to give it more flavor. I made quite a bit, and froze some to save on a rainy day. Would make again, my husband feels that the tomatoe paste, and sauce is what made this not so bland.

A good basic recipe to work off of; I found the actual product to be quite bland. Did anyone else find that significantly more liquid needed to be added than the recipe called for? I added another three cups of chicken broth with the same amount of vegetables and pasta indicated. Had to add some worcestershire sauce, parsley, and oregano to give it some depth of flavor.

Here are the only changes I made to recipe, initially: used homemade onion stock, replaced zucchini with yellow squash (no zucchini available), did not peel potatoes, tripled garlic, used one fresh tomato and one can of diced tomatoes, used can of red beans. Plus: This soup had a great texture and a very fresh vegetable taste. Minus: Too bland, had to add much fresh black pepper and white pepper, dried oregano, some red pepper flakes, worchestershire, thyme, and tabasco. Granted we don't like bland food but we could not even taste the basil. We aren't pepper lovers but it was necessary to make this edible. I will try this again but will add more seasonings about 15 minutes before it's finished.

A very nice soup..hearty..I added a selection of pasta..spiral..broken spaghetti.etc..One can adapt to taste..I find that it freezes well..

Great soup. We added chicken broth, spinach, cabbage and red kidney beans. Did not use puree potato. Great flavor. Served with bread, olive oil dipping sauce. Cooked pasta and added to soup instead of adding uncooked.

Relatively easy to make, but I changed it slightly. Basil alone would have been somewhat monochromatic for my taste, so I added some fresh thyme at the beginning, and added some parsley at the end. Having no dry beans, I ended up using canned garbanzos, which worked out well, adding them just before the puree. Overall, great flavor and a fine recipe.

Very good soup. I used canned beans as well, and put them in with the pasta. I also used veggie broth instead of just plain water. yummy!

My family & I all love this soup and it has become a great favorite, especially for cold winter nights. A big bowl of it suffices as a meal as it is so thick and full of goodness. I too used canned beans as this saves a lot of time. I make a double amount but cook the pasta only in the amount of soup needed for each meal so it doesn't go soggy by the following day.

This soup is delicious and has become my husband's favorite weeknight dinner!I changed it a bit--instead of water, I use low-salt, low-fat chicken broth, and instead of the dried beans I use a can of whatever beans I have in the pantry-very well rinsed. In addition,I added string beans to the veggies--can't have minestrone without string beans!

I used beef broth instead of water. Great flavor.

I loved this soup--it was delicious and so healthy. However, my family really didn't like it, so I set out to improve on it! This time, I dissolved two Knorr's vegetable bouillon cubes in 6 cups of water before adding the beans, veggies, garlic, and oil. Later, I added basil *and* savory and oregano. I'm sure other spices would work, too--it's just that basil by itself was too much of one flavor. I hope you try this soup! It's so good for you!

When you start to puree a soup it spoils the soup. I made the soup again without ouree and it was good.

We added the a can of garbanzo beans, some fresh green beans cut into 1 inch pieces and some left over veal meat from the previous nights dinner. We also added a dash of tabasco. It was delicious!! Very filling and low-fat too!
