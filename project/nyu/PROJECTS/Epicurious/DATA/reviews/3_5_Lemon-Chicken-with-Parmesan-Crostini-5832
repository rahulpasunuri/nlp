Nice quick recipe. Like others, I added more wine and broth to have more sauce. Changed up the crostini - sundried tomatoes and parmesan. Pretty good, but will add basil next time.

This recipe has great potential - a few tweaks and it has so much flavor your family and friends will beg for more - promise! First sprinkle very thin chicken breasts with lemon pepper and sea salt - let them sit for at least a half hour - the lemon pepper breaks apart on the chicken. Follow recipse except make each ingredient at least 4x what they ask for - I use almost 2 cps of scallions and a heaping tablespoon on minced garlic for 5 chicken breasts and 4x all other ingriedents to create enough sauce. Try that and this is a winner for sure!

The chicken was good - nothing unique or extravagant but work making again. The family wasn't a fan of the crostini. Not worth the time and money.

My family enjoyed this yummy dish. Agree that the sauce should be doubled or tripled if you intend to pour it over pasta. Crostina was delicious with aged parmesan cheese.

This was delightful! I followed some previous reviewers... didn't make the crostini... added ground sage to flour... added mushrooms to sauce... omitted lemon peel... doubled (should have quadrupled!) sauce... served over angel hair tossed w/ butter & minced garlic. There was quite a bit of prep work, so it was very helpful that my husband pitched in. If you're by yourself, I'd recommend doing the lemon juice, parsley, green onions, etc while the meat are sitting w/ salt & pepper on, and then start the chicken cooking process. This was a great meal!

This was delicious. I made it as the recipe was written. I let it simmer awhile while I prepared my sides and lost a lot of the liquid. I added another 1/4c wine at that point, along with 2T capers and some fresh parmesan. Yummy. Didn't make the crostini -- instead, I served this with whole wheat couscous and steamed spinach. I haven't gotten such high compliments on a dish in awhile.

Unfortunately this wasn't my favorite recipe. The sauce for the chicken was good, but the crostini missed the mark a bit. All I tasted was tomato paste (just the tomato and parm would have been fine without the paste). Together they weren't as complementary as I would have liked. Overall it was an okay dish that I probably wont make again without some major changes.

Yummy meal. Skip the crostini. I increased wine to 1/2 cup and added sliced zucchini. Served with broccolini pasta and green salad.

I thought this was pretty darn good. it was much like a picata recipe I use but using scallions instead of capers. My mother doesn't like capers so this allowed me to make my favorite dish and she would eat it. I went a little heavy on the lemon peel and would probably back off on that and go with what was called for. Also, I mostly doubled the sauce recipe.

This chicken recipe is a great easy way to cook up some tasty and impressive chicken. I like it best with mashed potates, but I've served it with rice and pasta as well. I've never bothered to make the crostini. It just never looked appealing enough to try. I've made this dish for quite a few people, and it always goes over well.

Rating: 3
The crostini, though very simple, was lovely and without it the rest of the meal could have been a bit boring. I enjoyed the chicken because I really like lemon flavors, but I'm not sure this was the best way to prepare it. It was very healthy though, so next time I try it I might tweak with the actual preparation a bit. I served it with green beans though if they're not in season a light salad would be great too.

I tried this recipe using a seasoned chicken broth, the chicken turned out tender and delicious. It was a very easy recipe and the crostini was a great addition to the meal. My family loved this dish...to quote my husband; "best meal I've had in a long time".

I originally reviewed this recipe on 12/29/00 - almost 6 years ago - it is still a family favorite (I'm making it tonight and wanted to check my memory). I still recommend sprinkling both sides of the chicken with lemon pepper & salt - let it stand for a while (the lemon breaks apart & coats the chicken) then follow the recipe. I still triple all of the ingredients to make more sauce - I usually use 4 or 5 chicken breasts and serve with angel hair or yellow rice - either way it's great. The crostini isn't worth the effort. This is truly a great chicken recipe - I also use minced garlic from a jar and we like alot of garlic so I tend to use a little more. Enjoy!!

We loved the chicken! It was great, nice subtle flavor. The costini was a huge hit, although I changed it - I used peeled tomatoes, tomato paste, grated parmesan & wet mozzarella, then broiled it until slightly browned. I'll use this side again & again.

Wow, I'm not sure at all why this dish got such a high rating. It was fine, a little boring, nothing special that's for sure. I would agree with the "needs more sauce" opinions, but found the lemony-ness just fine, maybe because I used a really nice, fresh lemon. This dinner would have been way to boring if I hadn't also made risotto with peas and prosciutto (on this site) which was amazing! You definately have to serve this chicken with something that has some "wow" factor of its own.

My husband, who is fussy about what he eats, loved this recipe. I found it didn't have enough liquid though. But, I think I let it boil down too much. I added capers and porcini mushrooms. I, too, like other reviewers, added more lemon juice. Absolutely delicious. Having the leftovers tonight.

Delicious! I added cornstarch to thicken the sauce and used fresh rosemary instead of parsley, since that's what I had on hand. Pounding the chicken very thin is important. Would definitely make again.

I saved this recipe 6 years ago and just now made it. This is not "fancy" but is somewhat light and healthy. I didn't bother with the crostini, a baguette was fine. My only complaints are that it was way too much lemon (and I love lemon) and the sauce was runny and there was not enough of it. Next time I'll skip the lemon peel, double the sauce and thicken it with cornstarch or flour. It's simple, elegant, and tasty. I served it with boxed rice pilaf but pasta or rice would be great too. I made what I thought would be enough for 5 people so we would have leftovers, but 3 of us polished it off. That tells you how good it was.

This recipe made a quick, easy and very tasty dinner for us last week. The ingredients are basic (meaning even I had them all on hand!) and made a healthy weeknight dinner which is a feat in itself these days arriving home at 6:30 pm after work and daycare pickup! I didn't make the crostini, but served the chicken with some leftover buttered egg noodles to which I added some parsley and scallions (chopped extra when making the chicken). Will definitely make again some time soon.

Rating: 3
The blends of herbs with the lemon was just great. This isn't a spectacular dish, but tastes great for everyday meals. I would have liked to have a little more and thicker sauce though. There wouldn't have been enough to eat with pasta so I just ate it with the crostini, which I thought needed more cheese. I also added Italian seasoning. It only tastes good straight out of the oven though. Leave it out for a few minutes and it tastes nasty cold. This is nice healthy meal with a salad.

Rating: 4
I skipped the crostini but made the chicken and my family really enjoyed it. I opted to skip the lemon peel as well - sounded like it would be too much lemon. I cooked all 4 chicken pieces till lightly brown, at the same time, in a large skillet using in total maybe 3 tablespoons of butter and enough olive oil to lightly cover the bottom of the pan. I have also switched to a lighter virgin olive oil which is supposed to be better for heating. I did double the broth, wine and lemon juice, but kept the other ingredients pretty much the same. I did use a little lemon pepper and saute'd some white and porcini mushrooms just prior to adding the green onions and garlic. We like our sauce a tad thicker so during the last couple minutes I added about 2 tablespoons of flour which had been shaken in a jar with maybe 1/4 cup of additional (cold) broth. I served this with buttered lemon angel hair pasta and a salad. We thought it was very yummy! Because of the butter and oil, not exactly low cal but you have to enjoy eating SOMEtimes!

Rating: 3
Delicious. The sauce didn't taste so great when I was cooking it, but once I served it, it thickened up more and the lemon flavor really came out. The parsley added a nice freshness. Had a sauvignon blanc with it, just right with the lemon. Would definitely make again. It was also quite easy to make.

Rating: 4
I modified plenty, but loved it still: Added ground sage, lemon pepper, parmesan & breadcrumbs to coating. Used a bit of dried, not fresh parsley. Upped the garlic. Put a little shredded fresh mozzarella on top while simmering at the end. Wonderful and simple enough. Served with a lightly coated pasta with red and green peppers.

This dish is excellent. I make it all the time and it is always quick, delicious and HEALTHY! The recipe is great as-is but I have made some modifications to simplify it. I skip the crostini (nothing special at all) and skip the lemon peel ( just the peel- do not skip the lemon juice) and parsley. I have not missed them. I use dry vermouth instead of white wine as it keeps longer in the refigerator and I ususally drink red so I hate to buy a bottle just for a recipe. This dish just has a wonderful flavor and it is so simple I make it twice a month. Enjoy!

I have made this recipe several times and it is always a winner. It is quick and delicious. I prepare the bread for the crostini by brushing it on both sides with olive oil and running it under the broiler until golden, then I rub the warm slices with a clove of garlic. I finish it off with the tomato paste etc, run under the broiler as directed, and it's great. I use thinly sliced chicken breasts when available. They cook up really quickly, but it is great with whole breasts too, just takes longer. I always serve it over angel hair pasta.

Rating: 3
Here's what I did: I peppered the chicken and sprayed it with olive oil and then broiled it and set it aside. I increased the onions, lemon juice, stock and wine to 1/2 cup each. After sauteeing the garlic, I added the onions and let them brighten. I next added stock and wine, let it reduce a wee bit, then added the lemon juice and all the parsley. Then, I added the chicken, covered the pan, and let it all simmer together, turning the chicken after a few minutes. I left out the lemon peel, since I think it makes the dish taste too much like furniture polish. No slimy results for me, the chicken stayed moist and the flavor was great. I agree that this is warm-weather food, and so usually serve mine with taboule or a green salad and a Chardonnay. This dish is great cold the next day, too.

Pretty good. I was impressed, thought that it would be much better as a "summer dish" (we made it in December). Flavors are fresh and light, works better for a green salad and glass of Chardonnay on the back deck. I added more lemon zest and green onions than called for - would also be really good with fresh cilantro!

I served this at a dinner party using exact measurements and the sauce was awful. I added capers as someone recommended and fidgeted with stock and pepper made the sauce so-so. I definitely will not be serving this to guests again, although it was a good recipe for a cheap dinner. Crostini was great, though.

Read all the reviews and unless you are serving this dish over angel hair pasta, don't triple the sauce! This would give you 2 1/4 cups of liquid!

I added oregano and basil to the crostini and doubled the sauce for the chicken.

I made the chicken and served it over angel hair pasta. It was amazing! Very fresh, a perfect summer meal! For the two of us, I made the sauce with 3/4 cup of chicken broth and 1/3 cup of wine. I could have let it reduce a little more. If you double the sauce it would be perfect for four people with the sauce over pasta! I will be making this for friends next week! (just so you know, by adding the parsley at different times there is a major color difference which didn't look very appetizing.)

Things did not go well when I made this dish. Everyone is right. Not enough sauce and I had to keep adding broth and wine and seasonings to finish the breasts in. The sauce came out clumpy from the chicken flour. The flavor of the chicken was good as was the crositini, but will not make again.

Easy, and very good! I did make more sauce than the recipe called for, and will probably add capers and artichoke hearts next time, as one reviewer suggested. The leftovers were even better the next day, and I almost never enjoy leftovers. A definite keeper. I did have to cook the chicken longer and over lower heat so that it would cook through, though - be sure to check a piece or two before serving!

I made the "cook's revised version," and loved it! I doubled the sauce ingredients (next time I will triple it). I listened to advice and used lemon pepper. Also, I added garlic, artichoke hearts and capers, and served it over angel hair pasta. I did not make the crostini.

At first, I couldn't believe this dish was lowfat, but then I realized they considered the 4 breasts to be 8 servings, but it was still pretty good on the fat intake. I really loved the flavor! I doubled the garlic, broth, wine, lemon juice, and peel. I served it over angel hair pasta like somebody had suggested and my husband and thought it was great! My 17 year old son preferred the crostini (which I thought was very tasty!), but he is not a lemon lover.

We were looking for a low fat chicken recipe so we used fat free cooking spay instead of oil and no salt and this turned out fabulous (in no way bland or boring at all)!!! We also used chicken tenderloin pieces instead of chicken breasts. We didn't even make the bread...it was delicious on its own. This will be a permanent addition to our menu.

This dish was good but I made a few changes. I eliminated the chicken broth and used the juice of a whole lemon, I just didn't think a tablespoon of lemon juice was enough to call this dish "Lemon Chicken"!! I also cut the chicken breasts into thin medallions rather than just pounding the whole breast. I didn't make the crostini so I can't rate that but I agree with one of the other reviewers that brushetta would probably be better. I would definitely make the chicken again with my substitutions.

It was great, succulant but with a spritey taste only discerable by the most qualified of palletes. If you must try this recipe please be sure to burn the onions thus having to quickly replace with Costco spices such as Tarragon and Parsley. Quite a wonderful little meal - ta ta!

This is a GREAT chicken recipe - triple the sauce & instead of sprinkling chicken with pepper - use lemon pepper & let chicken sit for about 10 minutes before proceeding - this adds alot more zing!!

Great dish! Made with sliced boneless/skinless chicken thighs. Per the suggestions of the other reviewers, I too added artichoke hearts and mushrooms (crimini). Gave the dish an extra kick by sauteing the chicken and vegies in chili infused olive oil. To perk up the crostini I lightly toasted the bread before adding other ingredients. To the tomato paste I added fresh basil and crushed garlic. Finished by broiling the bread with the topping. Very tasty.

This dish is a favourite at our home. The chicken is full of flavour. I've also used boneless, skinless thighs with excellent results. So good and for those who find it time consuming when guests are coming, trying cooking the chicken the day before and just keep pan juices for the next day and pick up where you left off. I always add a couple of tablespoons of capers when adding in the lemon zest. I served with pan roasted baby new potatoes with black olives, fresh herbs and kosher salt. Excellent recipe. Enjoy!

A fantastic dish. I served this with fresh brocolli and salad. Wine is a must with this dish- Pinot Grigio.

I made this recipe for a dinner party and everyone loved it. It took a little longer to make than I would have preferred, but it's delicious! It makes a great presentation.

Okay, so they omitted the part about cooking the chicken. What I'm interested in is the calorie/fat/cholesterol content. I found this recipe under the low fat cagetory...can't believe it's really low fat.
