We grill asparagus often and were just looking for something different. This recipe was fantastic! It's simple and offers a delightful new taste. It was a big hit at our July 4th cookout.

Love grilled asparagus-blue cheese butter on top-what could be better! So simple and tasty

This butter is amazing. I have yet to serve it on asparagus, but everyone I have served it to has loved it melting over a pepper crusted steak. A heaping tablespoon on each steak and you're in business.

This is excellent and easy. A great side with steak and a full bodied red wine. Agree this makes a bunch of extra gorgonzola butter; however, the extra makes a delicious and decadent topping for a filet!

Very good, but not exceptional. Broiled the asparagus since hubbys not too proficient with the grill. Still, a very good recipe and I would probably make it again. No leftovers.

Absolutely delicious! If you like bleu cheese and you like asparagus...you must try it. I made it at a friend's BBQ and it was a HIT!

This recipe is lovely. Your vegetarian friends will love you for it. Your meat eating friends will thank you for opening their eyes to a tastey new comfort food! It's a really easy, inexpensive recipe. The left over Gorgonzola butter and ingredients go a long way.

I grilled a combination of carrots, asparugus, red peppers and zucchini. I crumbled the gorganzola mixture over the top (I only made 1/3 of the cheese recipe). It added a ton of flavor. A definite keeper

Very tasty. I agree, all of the gorgonzola butter is not necessary, however, it saves and you can use the unused portion from this recipe for other things (should I admit I smeared it on a crackers?). I used baby asparagus, but I think it would be better with the full-gorown variety. Will definitely make again, becasue it's easy, delicious and different.

This was definitely the best recipe for asparagus that I've found...can't wait to make it again!

Fabulous! I used fresh basil and broiled the asparagus. Topped with about a tablespoon of the butter per serving. I had tasted the butter before and was concerned it would overpower the asparagus but it really mellowed out with the basil and garlic. Perhaps the people who complained it was too strong thought they had to use the entire amount which, in my opinion, would be too much. I made this with the Filet Mignon with Truffled Mushroom Ragout and the flavors went together very well. I would definitely serve this for a fancy dinner party. The butter would be great on other meats and vegetables as others have suggested.

Awesome, this goes with everything, except fish perhaps (only thing i haven't tried). Steak, all veg, on the side with a potato.. sometimes the best things in life are the most simple. Keeps for ever, and better yet .. people that don't eat "mouldy" cheese keep asking whats in it, shhh!

Very easy to make and a wonderful flavor. Make sure of course you like that strong gorgonzola taste and you'll enjoy with veggie. I will absolutely make this again. No adjustments necessary.

This recipe is delicious!! I just made it this past weekend and I've already had 2 requests for copies of the recipe. I plan on making it again for one of my vegetarian friends. If you have 4 or less people, you're probably okay making half of what the recipe calls for. The gargonzola butter is great on just about everything on your plate! Try it & love it!

I first made this dish about 4 years ago for some friends at college. The gorgonazola butter was quite possibly the yummiest thing I have ever had. The boys found that it went with everything I cooked that night (especially the garlic mashed potatoes). To this day, everyone is still asking me to make gorgonzola butter. This recipe is definitely a keeper for anyone who wants to add just a pleasant touch of flavor to a side dish.

Something different to do with asparagus. Absolutely delicious and have made several times again. Even my children eat asparagus now, I think since it's nice and cheezy!

We absolutely love this recipe, but, obviously, you should be a fan of gorgonzola cheese. We have also made it with blue cheese when that is all we have in the house, and we enjoy it, but gorgonzola is definitely better. We use MUCH less butter than it calls for- about 1 or 2 tablespoons - and we also use dried basil, which is fine in this recipe. To make this, we brush the asparagus with the oil & garlic mixture and place in under our broiler for a few minutes. Then we spread the cheese mixture on it and broil it for another minute or so. The asparagus gets that browned, broiled look to it and the cheese/butter is somewhat melted, but we really prefer it that way (as do most of our guests).

i wouldn't make this for my neighbors dog and i do not like dogs. There is plenty of things you can do with asparagus other than this, and they do not taste like formaldehyde.

I love gorgonzola, and I love grilled asparagus, so I thought I would give this a try. As mentioned in other reviews, it made a *LOT* of gorgonzola butter. Way too much. The strong taste of the gorgonzola also seemed to overpower the nice, grassy taste of the grilled asparagus. Perhaps if I put less on... As it was, this dish was good, but not great. The gorgonzola butter on its own, however, was very tasty, and would be wonderful melted on top of meats and fish.

Fantastic recipe! Have made it several times for guests and it is always a hit. The recipe yields more gorgonzola butter than necessary. Instead of wasting it, we used it on steaks to favorable reviews.

Love the gorgonzola butter. I prepared the asparagus by steaming it and served it with the gorgonzola butter. This was easy and tasty.

Sine it is 3 below zero, I could not grill, so I broiled the asparagus. The gorgonzola butter was wonderful, but the recipe made much more than I needed, and the excess overwhelmed the taste of the greens. I will make half as much next time.

Perfect winter veg dish. I was responsible for vegs on a potluck winter dinner party. Was this a hit! Makes a substantial amount of "butter" - you may not need that much....but I used it the next few days on other things, including crackers. The gorgonzola cheese I bought could not be crumbled, it was very soft (like cream cheese almost)...so I just blended them. Crumbled would be better for presentation. But flavour excellent either way.

This has become my staple asparagus recipe. I love it and it is easy. The butter is also good as a dap on a grilled steak or pork chop.

Absolutely fantastic recipe: both delicious and simple. I too have extra gorgonzola butter, but I don't see a problem with that-- more sauce for my other veggies! :) I also needed to add extra olive oil to the marinade. This recipe is going to become a staple in my home.

This is the best asparagus I have ever made! Easy and delicious. I just cut the butter recipe in half.

this was great and very easy to do. really does not take hardly any oil to coat the asparagus. once you cook them on the grill you can keep them warm in the oven until you are ready to serve. i did not use the basil. my guests and husband really enjoyed. i agree with the previous reviewer -- i have a lot of the butter left over.

Loved it, and so did my guests. The recipe makes more gorgonzola butter than necessary for 2 pounds of asparagus.

I have been grilling asparagus for years but it never turned out so well. Blue cheese is a staple in my kitchen so I make this often. A favourite.

This is the best recipe for asparagus I've ever tried. Absolutely wonderful even without the gorgonzola butter. I grilled them just short of blackened and the flavor from the marinade was exceptional. I did use more olive oil than called for so it would spread better. The gorgonzola butter was also great, you don't need much. I have lots of the butter left, will try with other vegetables. I had this with grilled salmon and new potatoes, one of the best meals I've ever had.

At a dinner party with friends, this was a BIG hit. Used a stove top grill and really got everyone salivating before the gorganzola butter. And once that melted over top, everyone gobbled it up.

This recipe is good. I added 2 cloves of freshly pressed garlic and 1/4 teaspoon of lemon pepper to the gorgonzola butter sauce and it zipped it up immeasurably. Go for it!

This is a wonderful side dish. Served with steaks and used the remaining "butter" as an optional topping to the filet! Got great reviews.

Very good topping for asparagus, other vegetables, even salmon (as a glaze before broiling or grilling). I ended up broiling the asparagus, with my salmon. I also had to use feta, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I think I added a bit more lemon juice, because I so love lemon. I didn't bother with the basil and garlic on the asparagus, but just went with a little olive oil and sea salt before grilling. Would definitely make again for company, or if I have time for a weekday meal.

Had to make two last minute changes, heated the gas grill..., and ran out of gas, so baked the asparagus in the oven at 350. Also discovered my gorgonzola was green, so substituted Feta, both worked great and tasted wonderful. I have a family full of picky eaters, out of a wide variety of foods at a family dinner this was the ONLY item everyone ate, and loved.

Because my husband and I are on a diet, I skipped the gorgonzola butter and just grilled the asparagus with the oil, garlic and chopped fresh basil. It was the absolutely fantastic!! I will use this recipe for a barbeque on Sun. and perhaps make the butter sauce on the side.

I loved this dish. It was simple to prepare and the butter keeps well so it can be used on other things. My husband found the gorgonzola a bit overwhelming; but if you like blue cheese, the combination is terrific.
