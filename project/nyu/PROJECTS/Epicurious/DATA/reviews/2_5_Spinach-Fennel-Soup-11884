very nice flavor; I decided not to puree and served it as is; I also used all chicken broth instead of 1/2 broth and 1/2 water and then added the juice of 1/2 of a small lemon. Very easy for such a nice soup--I'll definitely make this again.

Loved it--even though I had too much spinach to fennel. Think it would be improved by using butter not oil, tho.

Well, I added garlic as per reviewer's suggesion and also a bit of salt to bring out the flavor. It was actually pretty good and definitely accomplished its purpose, which was to use up leftover fennel...

Maybe I'm missing something, but I didn't care for this soup at all. The texture was awful--a very thin broth filled with strange fibrous strands of fennel. I'm not wasting fresh fennel on this again!

I did enjoy this soup, but found that it tasted much better cold than it did hot. When cold, the fennel flavors come out much better.

Tastes much better than it sounds. After being simmered, the fennel takes on a delicate, translucent quality and blends perfectly with the stronger-flavored spinach. I would've enjoyed adding little more spice - a couple cloves of garlic, or maybe pine nuts as a garnish?

This soup is really special -- the blend of fennel and spinach was new to me, but an instant winner. It's easy and very elegant.
