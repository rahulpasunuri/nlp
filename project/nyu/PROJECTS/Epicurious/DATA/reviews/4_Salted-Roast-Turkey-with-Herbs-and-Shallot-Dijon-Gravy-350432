I hate it when people write a review that completely changes the recipe...but I'm about to do it. Forgive me. I did this completely by accident the first year and keep doing it because it was so good (and I keep forgetting to follow the recipe and not just do what I remember doing the year before). First off, I use recipes as guidelines when it comes to herbs and spices. I use about twice as much of the herbs as it says to (and when I can I use fresh and just add more to make up for the taste that is added when dried). I follow the salt part, per the recipe just with more herbs. What I change is the baking prep: I add the onion, celery, lemon, and all the herbs to the softened butter and mix. After I clean the bird, I separate the skin from the meat and I spread the herbed butter under the skin and in the two cavities. I crack pepper over the skin on top, add the broth to the pan and roast/baste to the directions. It comes out juicy, tender, and delicious every time. The herbed bits under the skin taste delicious with the meat and are a great addition to the soup I make with the leftover Turkey the next day. I do also add fresh sage to the gravy, but thats because I love all things sage and think it adds a bit more to the gravy. Not that it needs it as it is delicious, but this makes it even better in my book. I have made our turkey this way for 4 Thanksgivings and every year people say it is the best yet.

This recipe was fantastic. It was easy to follow and everyone loved it, even my dad who hates turkey and my in-laws who were visiting from Mexico. I left the sage out because mine was old and I didn't want to return to the store for the 15th time in 2 days. I just compensated with larger amounts of thyme and rosemary.

The gravy is the most labor-intensive part of this whole recipe, but so well worth the effort. Make the Golden Turkey Stock, you won't regret it. And you'll have some leftover to freeze for next time since the recipe doesn't not use all 8 cups. This year, I did a ~17 lb organic free range turkey (from dartagnan.com they're amazing) at 325 for 4 1/2 hours, basted ~30 minutes. Only variation is that I leave the neck, heart, and gizzards out.

Exceptional. I've been using another turkey recipe for 4 years or so and decided to switch it up this year. So glad I did! Followed the recipe exactly except my bird was a bit smaller (12.5 pounds). It was easy and the result was incredibly moist and flavorful turkey. Delicious.

First time I dry brined a turkey and I was very pleased. Everyone loved this turkey. Leftovers froze very well, but gravy didn't since it separated and didn't thin upon reheating. I still used the gravy though. :)

This was my first ever Thanksgiving turkey and it was awesome (credit to the recipe, not necessarily the chef). I left the salt rub on overnight, so about 16 hrs. I took it out of the fridge an hour ahead of cooking and rinsed it completely, coated it with unsalted butter and stuffed loosely with fresh lemon, onion and rosemary. I didn't follow the cooking instructions given - I cooked it on the lowest rack at 500 for 30 mins then about another 2 hrs at 325. No basting, no hassle. I didn't use mustard but the gravy was divine. This turkey was so juicy it was ridiculous! As others have said, even the white meat was flavorful and moist. The skin seemed pretty crispy, but we don't eat it so I wasn't focused on it. It was, hands down, the tastiest and maybe the easiest turkey we've ever made in this family. Will do the same exact thing next year.

Juicy and delicious! I made a few alterations. I put the rub on 3 days prior to cooking. The night before, I removed the turkey from the bag and let it sit in the refrigerator uncovered. This is supposed to let the skin dry out with hopes of a crispy skin. I did not rinse the Turkey. I cooked it in the oven at 500 for 30 minutes to brown the skin and then dropped the temp down to 325 for about 3 hours until the breast reached 160. Next time I will leave until the breast reaches 165 just to make sure the dark meat is fully cooked. The flavor was exceptional and the juiciness was a bit crazy. Like many of the reviews, the guest raved about it. "I don't normally eat white meat but this we so good." "Best Turkey I've had." You get the picture. A must try.

I made this turey recipe for Thanksgiving this year and we loved it!!! I doubled the herbed salt and the turkey ingredients because I had a 22 pound turkey. I used fresh sage when I baked the turkey. I used a store bought low sodium chicken stock since I didn't have time this year to make it from scratch. I poured the turkey juices into a container and refrigerated overnight I made the gravy the next day using probably around 1/4 cup fat. I did not double the gravy amount and it was enough. I used 1 tsp. dried rosemary instead of fresh in the gravy. It took a lot longer for the gravy to thicken than the recipe lists but it did eventually thicken. I will definitely make this turkey again!

This turkey was AMAZING and so much easier than other turkey recipes I usually use. It was tender, moist, and flavorful and won rave reviews from everyone who sampled it! One thing I did notice was that the grazy came out quite salty. I'm thinking that maybe I didn't rinse the cavity out quite well enough, so be aware--rinse thoroughly if you plan to make a pan gravy!

For years I have simply roasted a turkey with fresh herbs but this year I decided to try something different. Since this was a last minute decision I could not try a brine, as most of the recipes required two days, I decided to try the salted roast instead. Wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not only was the turkey moist and juicy but it was seasoned to the bone. Every bit of breast meat was flavorful and juicy. Definitely a keeper. I will be using this recipe for Christmas again and for more thanksgivings to come.

I have been making Alton Brown's brined turkey for year, but have seen salted turkey recipes for a few years. I finally made the switch. This was wonderful and far easier than brining. I am doing it again this weekend for my daughter's boyfriend who was away for the Thanksgiving holiday.

Outstanding. This is THE recipe after several years of trying others from other brines to Martha Stewart. It browned beautifully. It was so juicy - everytime i stuck the thermometer in i got a little sprinkler! The flavour was excellent and the family has deemed the gravy better than grandma's!!!

This was a huge hit--I brined the turkey for about 18 hours rather than 24 hours, but it was still great. And although I accidentally overcooked the turkey a little bit, it was still moist and really flavorful. This is now my official Thanksgiving turkey recipe!

This turkey comes out extremely moist and delicious. As others have said, this will be my "go-to" turkey recipe in the future. The dry salt rub method is so much easier than the messy and cumbersome brining method. Also it surprised me that the dried herbs produced deep flavor that I thought was only possible from fresh herbs. Two changes: 1) I had to add a lot more liquid/stock (about 5-6 more cups) to the pan while the turkey was roasting in order to keep the liquid from evaporating completely. Perhaps that was due to the fact that the oven rack was on the very lowest rung. Due to the amount of additional liquid, I used about half stock and half water. 2) I did not make the gravy from this recipe, and used another instead (Bourbon Gravy, Bon Appetit from a previous November issue), and made it in advance, so I didn't have to fuss with it on Thanksgiving evening.

I don't know if this recipe needs another 4 fork review, but I just had to comment. This was the most perfectly delicious turkey I have ever made. We had to size up the recipe to fit our 20 lb bird so we almost doubled the cavity stuffing and the rub and it was just simply fabulous. The gravy is phenomenal even the kids begged for more. We also made the Hazelnut, Sage, Mushroom stuffing to go with it...perfection.

This is the second year we've used this recipe and will do it again. My daughters misread the recipe last year and put the butter/herb mixture under the skin before roasting the turkey. We did it intentionally this year. The turkey is moist and has such a fresh flavor with the herbs and lemon. It is much easier to use a dry brine than a wet one. The gravy is fabulous, too!

This is a phenomenal turkey recipe that I first made for Thanksgiving 2008. It uses a dry-brine that is so much easier that a traditional brine that uses gallons of water. Breast meat is moist, the turkey is perfectly seasoned from the dry brine, and the gravy is fantastic.

I made this last year for Christmas and it was my first turkey I made. To the cook from Boston, Mass.. the reason you rinse it off is because otherwise it is too salty. The purpose of salting it with all of the seasoning the day before and then putting it in the fridge is because thru osmosis, salt draws the moisture/water out of the bird to mix around with the flavors of the seasoning, then the moisture (all seasoned up!) gets absorbed back into the bird. The salt you rinse off would make it wayyy too salty (because it is too salty for the bird to absorb). The turkey comes out absolutely delicious and flavorful! I am making it again this year! Good Luck!

Considering the reviews and my husband's love for dijon mustard, I've chosen this recipe for my first roast turkey. I have a novice question: WHY do you rinse off the turkey AGAIN--AFTER if has been sitting around in its herbed salt? Doesn't that wash off the herbed salt and its flavors?? Also, in the event that I am unable to locate 4.5 lbs. of turkey wings to use in the stock, can I use a good chicken broth??

I wanted to do a different turkey for Thanksgiving this year as I was having more of a low-key get together. My brother-in-law said that it was the best turkey he'd ever had, and to be honest, it was fantastic. So simple, yet very traditional in flavour. I didn't have the time to let the turkey sit longer than overnight in the salt, but the taste of the herbs still came through. I just made my own gravy instead of the recipe, and it was a great compliment.I will make this again for Christmas dinner, a clear winner for us!

I followed this recipe exactly, except that I cooked a 6 lb. tied boneless turkey. I also cooked it in a bag with the turkey stock and seasonings and it took 2.5 hours at 325*. It was good and the gravy was great (I used only 1/2 the mustard). My non-gravy loving husband really liked the gravy. I'm not sure it matters how you cook the turkey, as the gravy is strong and overrides the delicate flavor of the turkey (deliciously). I will be eager to try this again with a full turkey for a larger group next time.

Excellent turkey. Probably the prettiest turkey I have cooked-- everyone remarked it almost didn't look real it was so evenly browned! As with a few other reviewers, my 17 lb. turkey was done ahead of schedule but not a problem. I used my own gravy recipe and it was very flavorful. Adding the fat pads to the pan was a new "trick" and resulted in a lot of good drippings to use for the gravy. With all this said, however, and as easy as it was, neither my husband nor I thought it was as good as a brined turkey, which we have done for years. My family raved over this turkey--and it was delicious-but my brined turkeys were juicier. I think this is a great technique and I plan to try it with chicken.

This was absolutely the best roasted turkey I have ever had. I used a fresh turkey and followed the directions exactely as written, with one exception - I stuffed the turkey with my own traditional dressing. The turkey was done about an hour earlier than expected, maybe because of the pan or my oven - I don't know. I also made by own gravy, not the one in the recipe. I was amazed that I did not have to add any additional seasonings or the usual gravy-fixer products to the gravy. We did not find the turkey to be too salty like some of the other raters stated. This was very moist and tender. I will use this recipe exclusively from now on!

I had ordered a brined turkey from Whole Foods and got a disappointing phonecall a few days before Thanksgiving that the brined turkeys came in frozen. So I switched to a 'natural' free range bird and followed this recipe. It was terrific - I did the salt rub exactly as the recipe directed, but only roughly chopped the veggies, and used all the typical suspect herbs (rosemary, sage, thyme, italian parsley and curly parsley) I had in the cavity when I roasted it. I left out the mustard in the gravy as I just didn't think it would work with the other flavors. Everything came out perfect, even though I was finishing the citrus carrots, the gravy, and a wonderful green bean, shiitake mushroom and shallot recipe from a couple years back simultaneously while my husband carved the bird and our admiring neighbors watched me like the lucky trio on Molto Mario!

This is the first Thanksgiving that I have done, and it's been a while since I've done a turkey - this was absolutely delicious. Like another cook my 20 pound bird was done too early and I kept it on warm. I also thought it would be too dry, and was very pleasantly suprised that it was very juicy. The gravy was really tasty, as well. I will do this again, probably when I do a roast chicken.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year. With one notable exception, it was spectacular. The exception: SALT. Reading all the other reviews, I think perhaps I didn't rinse it well enough, though I thought I did. Also, due to a crazy schedule, I had it sit w/the salt and herbs for 25 hours -- one hour longer than the outer edge of the recommended time. Even the gravy was quite salty because of the drippings. Still good, and my relatives are all "salties," so it was fine. They all raved at its moistness. Because the flavor, despite the salt, was so good, I will make this again. This time, I'll rinse like crazy, and leave the salt/herb mixture on the turkey for less time (I'm going for the short end of the recommended time: 18 hours.) P.S. Curious if others could taste the lemon and herbs from the dry rub; I didn't find that to be the case with mine. Did I do something wrong?

This was my first solo turkey (usually I help my mother do her version) and it was a breeze with the exception of one detail..I accidentally bought a breast instead of a whole turkey so when it was time to tie the legs, I couldn't find them. Same thing with the wings. So we stuffed the breast cavity and did I little surgery (I watch ER) and pulled it off. The turkey was moist and tasty and so easy. And this is from a dark-meat lover! I will consider doing this again for Sunday dinner now that I'm a veteran. I didn't adore the gravy. I thought the mustard overpowered the flavors. Perhaps next time I will use less mustard.

I made this for Thanksgiving last night. It was amazing! Everyone loved it. I only had 13 hours to let my salted turkey sit before I had to prep it for the oven. It was still great.

SO much easier than brining, and we thought the turkey was just as good. It was not at all too salty as I rinsed it very well. I did a 23 pound bird and it was done in under 4 hours, for some reason. I had to hold it for another hour and a half on warm, and was afraid it would dry out--but not to worry! Turned out great.

Everyone loved this turkey & it was easy. I took some advice I saw on a tv show & didn't baste it at all. The chef's reasoning was that every time you open the oven, it looses so much heat & delays the cooking process. For the first time in about 12 years, my turkey was ready earlier than expected, rather than later. It was still tender & moist despite no basting.

This is a great recipe and we will make it our standard for roast turkey from now on. For the last 20 years my husband and I have brined our bird and smoked it according to recipe from Sunset using a weber grill but when my husband saw this recipe, he thought we should try it. We bought a commercial bird and did the recipe exactly like was called for except we used preserved lemons (my husband thinks preserved lemons should be used whenever lemon is called for except ice tea and lemon bar cookies) and it turned out great. The gravy was transcendent and I would give this recipe 10 forks if I could. Today the entire carcass is in a pot making broth. None of the family thought it was too salty.

Very nice. This recipe is best for fresh turkeys, as frozen & kosher ones have been processed with salt. Also, rinse the hell out of it. Delivers moist, beautifully herbed meat. I rubbed the salt under the skin and portioned it among the breast & legs. Rinse, rinse, and rinse some more.

I was a little sceptical about this method (expecially after reading some of the comments here about saltiness - I saw this recipe here several days before Thanksgiving, by the way), but it turned out to be one of our best-ever turkeys. Due to my location(overseas) all I can get is a standard Butterball pre-injected turkey, and I worried about that too, but it didn't seem to make any difference. The turkey was moist and had great flavor; I didn't notice any strong herb taste and it certainly wasn't too salty. I made a point (after reading the reviews) of rinsing the turkey very thoroughly. Had to tent the turkey partway through as it browned very quickly. The gravy, too, was delicious though I didn't detect much dijon flavor. Again, not particularly salty. I will cook my next turkey with this method as well. BTW my understanding (and the way I did it) is that the turkey sits in the bag while being salted, then it comes out of the bag, gets spread with butter, and goes into the oven bag-less. It worked for me, anyway.

This was a beautiful and simple turkey and gravy recipe if for nothing more than it uses all dried herbs except for the gravy which called for fresh rosemary and I used dry about 1/2 tsp. The other reviews of a salty bird had me a bit worried but as I suspected a good thorough rinse took care of that and it was perfectly seasoned. The golden stock that is recomended with this is just as good and man I have a lot gravy that I'm freezing for other roast poultry and other meats as it's so rich and delicious. The mixture that goes in the turkey is brilliant and I intend to try it on chicken too. We got an expensive organic free range turkey for the first time this year and the salt rub treated it perfectly.

We altered it some, but this is the most moist, tender turkey we'd ever had. My husband hates turkey because it's usually too dry for him, but he went back for more helpings.

I usually brine my turkey, and this is almost as good, but a lot easier and less cumbersome. The white meat came out perfect with a beautiful crisp skin, although the dark meat was slightly overcooked (something that does not happen when I brine). The turkey was not too salty, but was well seasoned. I made sure to rinse off the turkey inside and out under running water just like a brined turkey. I also made a point of pulling some of the basting liquid from the cavity full of aromatics to get more of the flavors into the meat. I will definitely make this one again.
