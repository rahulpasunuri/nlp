A great standard recipe for fresh salsa aka Pico de Gallo. The only adjustment I made was to toss the chopped tomatoes with a bit of kosher salt and put in a colander for half an hour or so before combining with remaining ingredients. It helps keep the salsa from becoming too watery. Not sure why some of the accompanying dishes in this May 2011 are not posted on Epicurious as well!! Menu was Chile-Braised Pork Shoulder Tacos,Bacon-Simmered Pinto Beans,Pickled Onions,this salsa,Tomatillo-Chipotle Salsa and Micheladas.

A really great salsa! I found you really have to salt it up though... To the person who complained about too much onion, did you dice and run under cold water for 10-15 mins? I found that rinsing the onion, like the recipe called for, took out almost all of the bite from the onions!

Delicious! We made the entire menu and everyone raved about the fresh salsa. I also substituted jalepenos and they worked well.

This recipe called for way too much onion. We could even finish two bites and had to get rid of it.

This was an awesome dish, we substituted jalepeno's for the serrano chili's and you would have thought that it had been made at a restaurant. It was oh so YUMMY!
