Wonderful with some revisions! I added: 1) sauteed chicken breast strips, marinated in balsamic, olive oil, basil, pepper, pureed onion and garlic, and salt. (45 minutes) 2) skipped the (bland) mozzarella and used parmesan 3) minced garlic, a touch of cayenne and cucumbers. 4) I sprinkled fresh oregano on the top. There was a lot of flavor, interest and zing!

The only modification that I made to the recipe was to use beefsteak tomatoes and to add a large clove of fresh, minced garlic and a large pinch of chili flakes to the tomato-cheese mixture at the beginning of the marinating process. This is a deliciously light and refreshing salad.

In response to some of the blah reviews this recipe has gotten, I think the key is to use in-season fresh tomatoes, as well as the fresh mozzarella and basil. I added a bit of crushed red pepper for heat. It's simple and delicious for summer, especially since only the pasta needs to be cooked. Strong fresh tomato flavor, and mozzarella gets melty from the warm pasta, yum!

This is an easy, straightforward recipe, and the results are perfectly fine, but I didn't think it was that special. I even added some garlic, red pepper flakes and oregano to boost the flavor, but it was still a little blah. I have a feeling it would be smart to wait for summertime to make it again - relying on the early-March selection of basil and tomatoes was a little bit of a gamble! I think I'd use something other than penne next time - spaghetti, maybe - and I wouldn't let the tomato mixture sit for an hour - it made the tomatoes mealy. I'd also try a previous reviewer's suggestion of using balsamic rather than red wine vinegar.

it was really good, but the next time i made it i added red, yellow, and orange peppers. i also added onions and used balsamic vinaigrette. i thought it was so much better. try it and see what you think

I get the feeling that there is a bit of confusion about "fresh mozzarella". It is usually found in a plastic container, floating salty water or oil. I am not surprised reveiwers are disappointed at their results with cubed, hard, mozz, or with shredded for that matter. I heated my oil and added garlic, dried herbs, and crushed red pepper for the marination step. Other than that I left the recipe alone, and it was quite good.

Really tasty dish. The flavors were fresh and light- perfect for summer.

I took the other reviewers advice and added capers. I also added some marinated artichokes. I think these two additions are a must because the recipe seemed to lack enough acidity. Plus I love artichokes and capers! I also waited until the pasta cooled because I prefer to bite into chunks of mozzarella rather than melted. This was delicious and I will definitely make it again this summer! Also fresh mozzarella is a must!

I use cheese tortelini, and it's great. I prefer the mozzarella unmelted, so I mix a little of the tomato mixture with it and add it to the pasta when it has cooled. This is a great room-temperature dish.

This was way too bland. The Mozzarella got a little gummy. Made it for a party and the entire bowl of it was left.

This was great. I used whole wheat penne and it worked very well. I admit to not measuring - used a good quantity of heirloom tomatoes, a large round of fresh mozzarella and tons of basil. Based on some of the other comments, I added capers, thinly sliced shallots and red pepper flakes. I drained the tomato mixture (saving the liquid) before mixing with the hot pasta - adding a bit of liquid in as needed. It was a crowd pleaser, and good for lunch the next day, too!

I love the appetizer of tomato and mozzarella cheese marinade with basil leaves, and this recipe is like making it into a main dish. Loved it. Tastes better the day after.

This is really good! It's similar to another good Bon Appetit recipe, but this has less oil and more tomatoes. Based on that recipe, I added 1 clove garlic, 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes and substituted 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar. The other recipe also calls for 1/4 cup toasted pine nuts sprinkled on top.

This was very good- I made the mistake of adding the tomato mixture to the pasta after it had cooled awhile, which prevented the mozzarella from melting in the pasta- but very good

I Don't care what anyone else thinks, this is a winner for a summer recipe. You MUST use fresh jersey tomatoes and fresh basil. I use red and yellow grape tomatoes and I also add garlic. About 3 cloves per pound of Pasta. This is Yummy. You can't get an easier and tastier summer dish.

This is a fabulous recipe! It's super-easy to make, in July and August when the garden is bursting with tomatoes and basil. I like it with a mix of different color tomatoes, fresh from the garden. It's good hot, cold, or room temperature. You MUST make it with FRESH mozzarella and FRESH basil as the recipe calls for, or else write a negative review for your own recipe, not this one!

This recipe is very similar to a recipe within the white Silever Palate cookbook which uses a combination of Basil, Garlic, Oil, salt, pepper and slightly under-ripe Brie cheese. The variation within the Silver Palate recipe is much better.... and should be tried as it has become a favourite not only with my family but all the guests it that have tried the pasta.

Did the reviewer from Finland change something? I thought this recipe was absolutely wonderful to eat, and super easy to make. I can not imagine it without fresh basil, however. Fortunately I have lots of fresh basil and fresh tomatoes right now. I used shredded mozzarella, and added a minced clove of garlic because I love garlic, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Yum, yum, PASTA HEAVEN!

I love this recipe: following other cooks' advice, I use shredded mozzarella & add 2-3 cloves of minced garlic and some red pepper flakes. I also omit the vinegar, and use De Cecco linguine. My only problem is that the sauce really tends to cool off the hot pasta. I'd welcome any suggestions!

Ok, I seriously changed this recipe alot....and it was still excellent! Very versatile! Used shredded cheese instead of cubes, dried basil instead of fresh, added a little more olive oil, and even used canned rinsed diced tomatoes, and used a smashed garlic clove (which was conveniently removed before serving) and it still came out wonderfully ! Would probably use the same mix on baguette bread for bruschetta. Thanks

i have made this a few times. i made it once with fresh mozzarella, and found that it wasn't salty enough for my taste. so, last night i used string cheese cut into chunks, and added 2 cloves of garlic. i really like this recipe with the addition of garlic, and it tastes even better the next day warmed up for lunch.

This dish works better with shredded mozza instead of the sliced mozza and I added garlic cloves. I heated the sauce then mixed in the noodles. Also, with added chilis it makes a perfect arrabiata!! Great dish...and EASY!!

With a few modifications, this is one of my favorite recipes, and I make it several times a month. Incorporating other reviewer's comments, I always double the amount of olive oil and red wine vinegar and add 2 cloves of garlic. I also put a bottle of red wine vinegar on the table so that everyone can season the pasta according to his/her own preferences. Delicious!

This is a terrific recipe with sweet "German" tomatoes (the red and yellow striped ones). I add garlic and make two substitions -- balsamic instead of red wine vinegar, and parmigiano reggiano instead of mozzarella. And it tastes great after sitting just 20 minutes or so.

Much better if you first saute four sliced garlic cloves in olive oil. Put garlic and oil in bowl and add the tomatoes (I peel them) etc. Also, great with chopped anchovies added. Who needs the vinegar?

My husband and I love this dish. We've made this at least half dozen times in the last year. I usually make extra dressing and don't bother to seed the tomatoes. Last night I made it with cherry tomatoes (cut into quarters) with bow tie pasta. Terrific. P.S. This is also a big hit with a crowd.

excellent dish - we added two cloves garlic and extra cheese. Next time I would add another garlic clove and double the red wine vinegar and olive oil to allow for extra sauce. Also would slice the cheese in smaller slices, as it tends to clump.
