Instead of pork, made kebabs: chicken, mushrooms, orange bell pepper, red onion. thumbs up! Also, I didn't have real oranges, so just used OJ, and it was still yummy. (obviously would have been even better with the orange peel to jump it up) While chicken was grilling, I put the remaining marinade in a sauce pan and reduced to 1/3 to make a *delish* thick orange glaze to drizzle over everything just before serving - this probably made up for the lack of real peel by intensifying the orange. Also looked quite pretty! Served with a watermelon/feta/mint salad which made a lovely, summer dinner.

ah, neglected to mention.. just put a few bay leaves in the marinade, no need to use and waste all those leaves skewering them.

Thanks to an Alberta Clipper, my pork loin chunks marinated for two days until I finally gave up and decided to broil them in my oven. They turned out incredibly tender and oh so yummy. My variations - I used reconstituted dried orange peel (available at Penzeys Spices), added red pepper flakes, and used roasted garlic I made from another recipe on the Epicurious site. Delicious! Will definitely use this marinade again, perhaps with chicken as well as pork.

This recipe is fantastic. I like to freeze the pork and marinade and let it thaw in the fridge. I usually can't find the fresh bay leaves so I add 1 or 2 dried ones into the marinade. I cook it as a full tenderloin instead of pork ribs. I also cooked this recipe for 70 people and it was a huge hit!

delicious! i used pork tenderloin as suggested, marinated overnight. the orange flavor is fantastic. added some red onion to the kebabs. served with roasted tomatoes.

Delish! Made this as written. Slightly sweet with a good citrus taste. Will definately make this one again. The boneless country ribs were pretty fatty tho, and so much was wasted after trimming them. Next time I think I'll try cutting up a pork roast ( it might be a little leaner) and marinade it a little longer. I only had time to marinade for 2 hours.

Although this wasn't bad per say, it just wasn't good enough to bother making again. The marinade was too runny and watery and therefore didn't have much flavor at all. Too many other good recipes out there to bother making this one again.

I didn't care for this. I didn't like the sweetness of the honey or the taste of orange. I would have preferred it more savoury - such as just with lemon, garlic, and rosemary.

I made this recipe it was easy and delicious! However, I varied the recipe by using pork short ribs (2lbs), skipped the bay leaves all together, added one half of a small onion (sliced) and reduced the olive oil to 2 Tbsp. I baked the short ribs in the oven for one hour (skipping the marinating process). They turned out wonderfully flavorful and tender! I served the short ribs with red potatoes drizzled in olive oil and fresh rosemary and sautéed apples (with onion and apple cider vinegar). The apple recipe was out on this site listed with another pork recipe and it turned out to be a delicious compliment to these short ribs! We'll definitely try this recipe again!

Delicious and easy. I made this when it first appeared in B.A., and have made it several times since. I made the marinade just as written, but used 1-inch chunks of pork tenderloin instead. I skipped the skewers and just put the pork in my grill basket and cooked it indirectly on the Weber.

Rating: 2
I made this with thin cut chops instead of making kebobs and I left out the bay as well. It would have been a three fork recipie except for the fact that it turned out very greasy. I will try reducing the oil next time and add more citrus juice because it was very tasty. I don't like pork as much as the rest of my family, so I'm always happy to find a recipe that makes the pork taste less "porky". I served this with couscous flavored with lemon and orange zest and toasted pine nuts and it was a big hit.

Rating: 3
What a super-easy recipe. I'm a huge rosemary fan and went a little overboard on the stuff. No problem! It was a flavorful and light change from too many ooey-gooey teriyaki or barbecue sauce pork recipes. The citrus is a nice edge next to the honey. I'll be sure to do this one again when the sun goes away for the winter. Thanks to the reviewer for the salmon suggestion, too. The coho are just about to run around here...I'll certainly try it out.

Rating: 2
The marinade was very nice (I skipped the bay leaves). Next time I would try a different cut of meat because the country style pork was tough. Better quality chops, & certainly the salmon suggestion by an earlier reviewer, would be the way to go.

Very tasty dish. I used 1-inch thick pork chops, and the results were great. The combination of orange, lemon, honey, and rosemary is very refreshing.

COMMENTS about the MARINADE: This was SUPERB WITH SALMON fillets (as you might expect)! -A sweet-but-still-tart, citrus marinade. Since salmon is far less dense than pork, I suspect the marinade permeates flaky fish better than it does pork, to yield great results! To enhance the rosemary/orange-rind grind, I microwaved them 14 seconds, and used my pestle (sans mortar). Used lime instead of lemon. Grilled the salmon on our Teflon stovetop grill/griddle which I'd lightly spray-oiled. (I've become a sucker for "those great grill marks"! Plus, it was raining.) Reduced the marinade to use at table. Served with sautéed spinach; leftover boiled potato slices and baby carrots; leftover slices of an artisan, rosemary bread drizzled with olive oil and lightly toasted. Yummmmm.

I made this for a large family gathering this past weekend, where there were 2 other meat entree choices (I used beef instead of pork). People absolutely raved about these kebabs, and they were the first things to disappear from the buffet. And people complained there were enough of them (there were plenty of leftovers of other things)

This was great and so easy. I added sweet onion, pineapple, yellow zuccini and green peppers to the kebabs when I put them together and served with rice. Makes a great all together meal.

The bay leaves are a pain and seemingly not essential to the recipe. Make sure to salt the meat to add flavor.

Well this dish is quite surprising. The flavor is fairly mild and not too sweet. I used clover honey and I would say that it took me longer than 20 minutes on the grill, but a great summer dish nonetheless.

Rating: 3
Simple to prepare and gives a nice subtle flavor to the pork (slightly sweet) even though I marinated them overnight. I added 1/8 tsp red pepper flakes to the marinade but I really couldn't tell the difference. Next time, I'd up it to 1/4 tsp. I completely eliminated the bay leaves.

I reduced the honey by about a tablespoon and used pork tenderloin, sliced about 1" thick. As other cooks have noted, it's delicious served with grilled pineapple rings and bell pepper. I also grilled some red onions with it and everyone loved those as well.

Good recipe, a little sweet so I plan on cutting back on the honey next time and possibly adding a little spice. I did not use the bay leaf. Be sure to adequately salt the pork and do not over cook. I used a cast iron grill on my gas range, and it was just like a bbq!

Rating: 3
I used the suggestions on marinade additions from A Cook from 'Burgh 8/28/092; excellent. Rather than bay leaves (seemed like a lot), I added a pinch of powdered bay leaf to the marinade which I then reduced slightly for a sauce. As it seemed sweeter than wanted, I added a touch of white wine vinegar. Pork tenderloin worked well, and was broiled indoors. The dark brown juices remaining on the broiler pan made a nice addition to the sauce. We'll make this again; it's easy and delicious.

Also used it as a marinade for pork tenderloin. I used the zest of one orange and lemon vs. strips of orange. Although it had a nice, light, fruity taste, I didn't feel it had enough punch so I added cayenne, paprika and mustard. That did the trick without losing the light flavor.

Great tasting, easy recipe. Instead of using the bay leaves, I marinated the pork with pearl onions and mushrooms. After marinating for 3 hours, I placed alternating pieces on the kebabs and put the orange slices next to the pork on the kebabs.

The "sous chef" should know from cooking classes (if they really are a sous chef) that boiling a marinade for 15 minutes will kill any bacteria. The cook from NY obviously did that if it was reduced to a syrup.

Oh yes! This was delicious. I'll make this over and over. Love the marinade, boiled it for sauce, and had it with rice. But more sauce is a good idea, and I thought pineapple and bell peppers would be fantastic with it, or you could grill orange halves.

Pretty good - my boyfriend loved it, I liked it. I used pork tenderloin to cut down fat with no dryness , and marinated overnite. I wish I had taken the advice to grill some pineapple chunks, as one person suggested - they would have been a perfect accompaniment. Also next time will make extra sauce as others did.

Wonderful!! Delicious marinate on pork.Sophisticated flavor, not too sweet. I used fresh rosemary from my neighbors garden. Used about 1 small bay leaf every 4 pieces and marinated 4 hours. Great taste. Only got better as leftovers.

I didn't have any trouble with the cut of meat or dryness and I thought the flavor was decent but we were left wishing for more orange flavor. I used fresh OJ and marinated four hours. Next time I will use another cook's suggestion and prepare two marinades, boiling down one for an end marinade or dipping sauce. I use the elongated grill baskets instead of skewers and pack them firm. I get the outside nice and brown while the middle stays juicy.

I ended up leaving this in the marinade for 3 days due to a change of plans. The pork really took on the marinade flavors. I grilled the pork with cubed orange bell pepper, fresh pineapple cubes, fresh crimini mushrooms, and sweet potatoes - excellent dinner. I also made a separate bowl of marinade but it really didn't need it.

This certainly received mixed reviews in my family. My husband quite enjoyed it, I thought it was just okay, and my son did not like it at all. I used sliced pork tenderloin and I sauted it with a bit of onion. I think maybe I didn't use enough honey (I have a tendancy to guestimate amounts rather than measuring them out properly) as it wasn't as sweet as I thought it would be.

I am a vegetarian but I had a BBQ and made this for guests. They all loved it. Afterwards a few mentioned that they didn't really like pork and hadn't eaten it for years. Then they asked for the recipe. I have made it for my husband again since then. Very easy and the marinate smells great.

I doubled the recipe, marinated the pork over night and did a batch of chicken thighs as well. Everything turned out wonderful on the grill. Very easy to do ahead. I will remember this for when I have larger parties and little time. Next time I will try the pineapple idea.

Rating: 3
Easy, easy, easy. I served this with grilled veggies, orzo pilaf AND GRILLED FRESH PINEAPPLE CHUNKS....both my husband and I agree that the pineapples made the pork taste that much better. Another hint for added flavor is to baste the kebabs again after they are off the grill. And yes, do not over-grill.

This was just OK -- I thought it was rather bland. If I tried it again I might add ginger, or something else to punch up the flavor.

Hear hear Jo Miller. People cook pork to death and that just isn't necessary. The "lean generation" brand in the grocery store is inedible, but my local butchers pork is still REGULAR OLD PORK and delicious. This recipe is also very good with GOOD chunked pork tenderloin as kebabs, just don't overcook.

Rating: 3
What a treat! The kebabs were juicy and delicious. An instant family favorite. The trick with pork (any cut of pork) nowadays, is not overcooking it - getting it just right is quite a feat, since suppliers are trying to produce leaner (and therefore, less tasty and juicy) meat. Find yourself a good butcher in your area, as we fortunately have- they often have better (old-fashioned) pork.

The combination of flavors was fresh and delicious with the pork. Mine turned out a bit on the dry side, but that was my fault. I left it on the grill a little too long. Still everyone liked it.I reduced the marinade to a syrup, strained it and used it to baste the pork. Served it with an orzo pilaf and grilled vegetables. I served it with a crisp Sauvignon Blanc, but a reisling might have worked better. The color of the reduction was not appealing. I wouldn't use it for a dip. But, I would try it to baste chicken on the grill. grilled chicken

This dish was *great* served with jasmine rice, grilled asparagus and a nice gewurztraminer. I marinated for 24 hours and then boiled the extra marinade down, which resulted in a yucky, fatty mess. Next time I'll make a separate batch of the marinade into a dipping sauce, since it seemed a bit dry to me. This dish will become a Summer staple.

I made this tonight for the family. My husband and I LOVED it and my 4 year old and 15 month old ate every bit I gave them. Very light and quite a different taste. You really can taste all the ingredients. This would be great on steak or chicken kebabs as well. The more tender the meat, the more the marinade will soar! I served it with grilled red peppers in lemon pepper and fresh dill from my garden, roasted corn on the cob, and baked pineapple slices topped with coconut flakes (thanks to another poster). The taste was perfectly fresh and light for a summer night (and easy cleanup from grilling almost everything!) Hubby and daughter asked me to make it again and again! Thumbs up!

This was _great_. I used peach jam instead of honey because when I went to marinate the pork I realized I didn't have enough honey left in the jar, and I let the pork marinate overnight. Really moist and flavorful--some of our favorite grilled pork, and we usually BBQ pork once a week. For the reviewer who asked what to serve with this, I served crispy roasted garlicky asparagus spears, a green salad w/ripe tomatoes in a creamy herb dressing, and baked yellow bell peppers stuffed w/rice and fresh mushrooms. Wonderful, fresh summery meal.
