Easy to make and great to prep ahead. It's a beautiful dish, but kind of a weird flavor combination. I love cabbage, but wasn't wild about this dish. It was the most thrown out item on the plates, and it makes a LOT. Plus the house smelled bad while it was cooking. Think I'll skip this one next year.

This was a big disappointment. While the seasonings were tasty, the veg's were mushy and I couldn't taste the fennel at all. If I ever attempt this again I will skip the expensive fennel and drastically cut the cooking time.

Yum!!! We used heirloom red cabbage, fresh fennel, spring onions, soooo gut!

Very easy to make and deceptively delicious. I mean, who would think a cabbage recipe could be something you couldn't stop eating. I thought this was muc better the second and third day. YUM!

This was very good. Took the suggestion of another cook/reviewer and served it with the Crown Roast of Pork and Cider Gravy. Excellent.

I made this recipe to accompany a crown roast of pork, and it was fabulous! Sweet and tart. Red cabbage is not a typical side dish, and I recommend that you suprise your guests with it, too. This one's a keeper.

Good recipe, not overly sweet and easy to make. I would definitely make it again.
