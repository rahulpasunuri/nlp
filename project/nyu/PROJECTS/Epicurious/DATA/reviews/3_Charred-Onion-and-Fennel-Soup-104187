Folks, somehow the bay leaves, shiitake mushrooms and kidney beans crept into this recipe. The original recipe as printed in Bon Appetit stopped at the Pernod.

I made this recipe from what I had on hand. I used 32 oz. of homemade turkey stock, the suggested amounts of fennel and onion, and one teaspoon of dried thyme instead of the fresh. I sauted 2 oz. of fresh shiitakes with the onion and fennel, and added a 15 1/2 oz. can of cannellini beans (rinsed and drained) with the stock. It was quite good.

There are two omissions in the directions list. What to do with the shiitake mushrooms and kidney beans has been left out. We chose to leave out the kidney beans both times we've made this and very much enjoyed the soup as a starter.

I am a bit confused about the can od red undrained kidney beans and the dried mushrooms listed as ingredients. What is to be done with them? Or has a mistake crawled into the ingredients list? I just omitted these two items. Rajam Csordas
