LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! This cheesecake!! I have made it dozens of times and it turns out perfectly and impresses everyone. Like everyone else has said just add the white chocolate at the end after letting it cool from melting. It does make a lot of cheesecake but everyone fights over the leftovers! I normally make a graham cracker crust and use raspberries instead of strawberries. Excellent!

Excellent!! I always get rave reviews whenever I make this. Everyone always says "this is better than the cheesecake factory!". Like others, I added the white chocolate at the end. The last time I made this, I put caramel on top instead of the strawberries. The caramel topping I made from the Salted Caramel Ice Cream recipe on this site. This makes a MASSIVE amount of cheesecake. It filled my 10" pan nearly to the top. Next time I'll probably reduce the amount by 3/4 and bake it in a 9" pan.

I really, really liked this recipe and I am only giving it 3 forks because of the lack of explanation on the part of Bon Apetit in regards to when to add the white chocolate. It is in my opinion just ridiculous that they do not have that in the recipe! However, I made the recipe and all in all it went well. I substituted chocolate graham crackers for the crust and actually halved the recipe to fit an 8-inch springform pan. I added the white chocolate at the end and it worked out well. If I made this recipe again I would make sure to butter the pan all of the way to the top because the filling stuck and there were cracks in the crust, I would also like to try folding in the white chocolate as opposed to mixing it in. Other than that it was a great dessert!

I've not made this yet and it probably is a good recipe judging from the good reviews. I'm just wondering why Epicurious did not correct the instruction error.. there is no instruction when to add the melted white chocolate. This would be most helpful for those new to baking.

I'd give this recipe four forks, despite the lack of specification on when to add the white chocolate. (Alright, I completely forgot until I was putting it into the oven one time...) Also, I've made this both with the chocolate crust in the recipe and a simple graham cracker crust. The graham cracker crust was far better with this, in my opinion. Delicious recipe in the end though! It can pull off either crust. :)

I've made this recipe dozens of times. The only changes I make are to bake in a water bath. Just be sure your foil goes all the way up, and use the large sheets of heavy duty foil. I add the white chocolate at the end of the mixing, being sure to add it slowly so that it does not "cook" the batter.

Rating: 3
Would someone at Epicurious PLEASE finish this recipe! Do you add the white chocolate to the filling or spread it over the top? I also had a problem with the crust sticking to the pan. Why wrap the pan in foil if it's not to be baked in water bath? This cake makes a beautiful presentation and tastes wonderful, but trying to get it from the pan to a plate and still looking great is nearly impossible! I would make it again, but with a few adjustments to the recipe.

The problems I had with this recipe is that it doesn't say when to add the chocolate and it was really hard to get the crust and the cake to come out together. What did I do wrong with the crust? Otherwise looked really nice and had a great taste

I made this cheesecake for my boyfriend on Valentines Day. I made it two days in advance and let it rest in the fridge. Instead of topping it with strawberries, I got little lindt milk chocolate hearts and covered the top with them. I then chopped up fresh strawberries, sprinkled with a little sugar and served them along side the slice. I used oreo cookies to make the crust and it was amazing. I have had cheesecake in New York and this recipe doesn't even compare. This is a wonderful and easy recipe, I highly recommend.

Ha! This is my go-to cheesecake recipe! It's perfect as is, but you can easily substitute "light" cream cheese if you feel the need. (I use digestive crackers + cocoa for the crust.) Whoever chooses this cake for their birthday - or other special occasion - gets to choose the topping. Some of the more memorable ones have been, Mango, passion fruit and exotic fruits; fig and lemon zest; fresh wild blueberry preserves....LOVE THIS!

This cheesecake was absolutely delicious and got rave reviews! I used a regular graham cracker crust and then use white chocolate chips in the filling. I noticed the recipe does not state at which stage to add in the white chocolate, so I added it in the filling at the end, along with the whipping cream and sour cream. Instead of a strawberry topping, I did a raspberry jelly topping and it complimented the white chocolate perfectly! The cake almost completely finished and everyone wanted to take some home! It was not too sweet and the raspberries' tartness was exceptional. I baked mine for 1 hour and 20 minutes, and it puffed up over the pan. Over time, It deflated to about half its peak size, leaving the edges a little uneven. However, the raspberry topping covered that up. I would definitely recommend this cake for special occasions, as it makes a lasting impression!

This cake was excellent. I made it for a dinner party and everyone could not stop talking about it. Despite all the ingredients, it was creamy and light tasting and not heavy like some cheesecakes can be. I didn't have apricot preserves so I used raspberry jam, cherry brandy, and a splash of pomegranate juice. I used half of it for the glaze and then warmed the rest and served it over the cake. Delicious!

I guess all the rave reviews are from better chefs than I, or at least those who are able to fill in the blanks (seriously, steps are missing) and wing it. This CLEARLY is a doubled recipe and should say so, but I made it anyway because of the rating. I'm going to take it to a dinner tomorrow with friends, so right now it's sitting in my refrigerator along with my hope that all the hassle was worth it. Thanks to all the heads-up warnings from other reviewers -- but you Epicurious folks really should ride better herd over the recipes. This is the second recipe in a row where either the amounts or temperatures or times were way off. by petrarca from Lemont, IL, USA on 01/16/10

I have made this cake half a dozen times with overwhelmingly great reviews each time. It is a personal favorite of mine and very reliable. The topping suggested is great but I'm partial to my own: a white chocolate mousse. Just whip some cream and fold with melted white chocolate and incorporate chopped nuts for great texture!

Oh my! First I have to say that I bake a lot of cheesecakes - they are my husband's favorite & after 13 years I've gotten quite adept, and become pretty well-known for my cheesecakes. I also should point out that I don't usually like WHITE chocolate. With that said, this was THE ABSOLUTE BEST CHEESECAKE I HAVE EVER MADE...and that's saying a lot, considering I have made hundreds! The white chocolate added a luxurious creaminess above usual cheesecake. The flavor was very subtle, and adds a stronger vanilla flavor. I suggest trying other flavors of jelly - I used seedless raspberry & added a tsp or 2 of sugar because it was tart. The reddish color really added to the beauty of the berries. One note: To make ahead, don't add strawberries until just before serving. And, if possible, allow cheesecake to sit out & take off the chill - the flavor will improve. Once the fruit is added, this will NOT keep well longer than 24 hours, so plan accordingly. I gave the leftovers to my (very happy, appreciative) neighbors. Once the berries & glaze are added, they will begin to break down quickly. You won't be disappointed, try this amazing recipe!

Best cheesecake recipe EVER! So versatile and delicious! I have used this as a base for so many variations, try substituting creamy peanut butter for the white chocolate and cover in chocolate ganache.. voila! instant peanut butter cup!

We made this cheesecake in our culinary arts class. We made two of these cakes and they were both very good. The thing about this cake is that it rises a lot! So make sure you keep the top of the cheesecake away from the main source of heat or you will burn the top of the it. Also in the directions it never specificaly stated when we were suppose to add in the white chocolate so we decided to put it in the filling. This made the cheesecake jiggly when it was suppose to be done cooking so we let the cake cool and then put it in the refridgerator. The next day when we got the cake out it had fallen a little, but not much. We changed the recipe by making a thinner apricot glaze. We put the apricot preserves in a blender added a little sugar and blended it. then we put the apricot glaze on the side of the cake so that the strawberrys would stick to the side. Then we creatively decorated the top of the cake. We then made a strawberry glaze by putting strawberries and sugar in the blender and drizzling it on top along with the apricot glaze that we had made. The cake turned out beautifully! It was very summery looking and very delicious!

This is quite possibly the best cheesecake I've ever made! The white chocolate flavour is very subtle; everyone noticed something in the flavour, but couldn't quite figure it out until I told them what it was. I Baked it for my husband's birthday last month, and I'm making it today for a BBQ tomorrow. Since peaches are in season now, I'm going to make a spiced peach topping, I think it will work well. My only problem was the cooking temp. After almost the full hour+ it wasn't anywhere near done, so I increased the temp to 350, and I think I ended up giving it another 30 minutes. I did it in a water bath and it came out absolutely perfect; no cracking, as smooth and creamy as you could possibly want! It is a little pricey to make, but it's worth it! I'll make this again and again and again!

I've only ever made a handful of cheesecakes and that was ages ago. Tried this one w/ very good results. Like other reviewers the top did brown ALOT faster... I checked it at the hour and it was already a bit too brown (all over). I covered it with foil to finish then popped in the fridge. I didn't have any brandy for the glaze so I added a bit of marsala to the apricot spreadable fruit (not preserves but same difference). Leftover batter went into silicone mini muffin mold - finished w/ a strawberry slice and extra glaze... Delish... very sweet and filling though... a little goes a very long way!

Ok, now I have a great cheesecake reciepe that my friends mother gave to me. I never thought I would find something to top it. Well, hate to tell her, but this blows it away! What an unbelievable cheesecake! I could only find the white chocolate in chips at my local store. They were a little hard to work with trying to melt them. I think the flavor would be even better with some good stuff. And thanks to the lovely liquer laws in washington, you can only buy brandy at a state owned store... So, being the lazy guy that I am I substituted a little rum abstract for the brandy, I also added a tsp to the cake batter. This cheesecake is an absolute showcase and sooo easy to make.

I made this over the weekend for a dinner party, I should have made two because it was gone in a flash. I used 12 oz of guittard white chocolate and it turned out great and cut down the expense. I also noticed that the recipe doesn't say when to add the chocolate, so for the novice cook, add it after you blend all the other batter ingredients. This truly is fantastic!

The taste of this cheesecake is great. However, there was too much batter for my 10" pan (I measured it). It overflowed and browned much faster than it cooked, so I had to put tinfoil on it to prevent burning. It took quite a bit longer to bake then stated in the recipe. I have a gas convection oven, which by my experience, usually cooks everthing faster than expected. Just notes to help for next time.

Awesome eh - best cheesecake recipe I've come across in awhile. Comes very close to the Mascarpone cheesecake, our unbeatable favourite. I added 1 1/2 tsps of cardomon which was amazing with the white chocolate. Makes more batter than this pan can take so be prepared, I filled 6 mini muffin cups. This cake puffs up quite a bit,make sure it has room. Bakes beautifully no cracks. Used whole strawberries and passion fruit glaze for top. Definately a keeper!

I have made this recipe as written several times, and it is to die for - my favorite cheesecake recipe ever. I just made it for a holiday party and, with fresh strawberries unavailable, had to come up with an alternative -- it turned out good enough to share: after the cheesecake had chilled overnight, I "depanned" it and set the bottom of the springform pan on a cooling rack. I made a ganache out of 1 cup heavy whipping cream, 8 oz. of 60% cacao bittersweet chocolate, and about 1 1/2 Tbs. of sugar. After the ganache cooled a bit, I poured it over the cheesecake, dripping it down the sides and spreading to cover completely (this made a hideous mess, but whatever). After a few hours, the chocolate firmed into a glossy chocolate shell. It really rocked - the dark chocolate was a great foil for the delicate, creamy cheesecake. And it was pretty too. :)

Rating: 4
This is very yummy. I cut the crust recipe roughly in half & only use a bottom crust instead of trying to push it up the sides. I also use only 12 oz of chocolate. I bake it in a water bath for about 50 minutes, let it cool on the counter for about 10 minutes and then put it in the frig to cool. It makes extra batter for me, so I just put the extra in a couple of ramikins & bake those on the side (for the cook!). I skip the topping, it's not needed & makes it watery unless you eat it immediately.

This is my favorite cheesecake ever! I do think the glaze/berry juices break down and make the top a bit watery if not eaten right away. I always at least double the glaze recipe, toss a bit of it with the berries and refrigerate them until ready to eat. Then when I plate it all, drizzle extra glaze on plate, top with cake, berries and more glaze.

This cheesecake is sublime! My niece requested a cheesecake with strawberry topping for her 18th birthday party, so I thought I'd give this recipe a try. Aside from the cheesecake, there were two other desserts at the party as well as the birthday cake, but the cheesecake was devoured before a dent was even made in any of the other sweets! I've been asked by several family members to make this delicious dessert again for the next family get-together :-)

I have made this cheesecake for special occasions over the past few years and get RAVE reviews each time. The best compliment was this past Christmas when my mom, who has made her NY Cheesecake each year for Christmas for at least twenty years, announced that THIS is the new Christmas cheesecake for our family! Yes, it is THAT good. I agree that it needs to cook longer than the recipe calls for...keep an eye on it. Also, this Christmas I used the strawberries but didn't have time to make the glaze. I sprinkled sugar on top and it did not get runny like previously commented.

This was an excellent cheesecake recipe. Not the BEST cheesecake I've ever tasted, but probably the best cheesecake I've ever made. A few things I noticed. I set my conventional oven to about 325-350 degrees, but still had to bake the cake at least 20 minutes longer than the directions stated in order for the cake to fully cook (ie top of the cake was just a very light brown on the edges). The cake tasted the best after it had a day to cool in the refrigerator. But after 2-3 days the strawberry glaze started getting a bit watery. I would say that you should eat this cake within the first day or two. I used chocolate graham crackers (store brand) for the crust. These were good, but i think chocolate cookies of some sort would have had a better chocolate flavor to contrast against the cheesecake. Overall an EXCELLENT cheesecake.

This is a fabulous cheesecake, although I agree with other reviewers that it yields a bit too much batter. I also made it with only 12 oz. of white chocolate, and the flavor and texture were both fantastic. I served it with fresh rasberries instead of using a sauce or glaze, and the slight tartness of the fresh fruit really helped as a contrast to the sweet cheesecake.

I have made many cheesecakes and this ranks among the very best. My husband says it's the best he's tasted anywhere. The texture is outstanding: the cake cuts and plates beautifully. The cake did brown up quickly and I turned off my oven after 1 hour and 10 minutes. I kept the oven door closed for the next 10 minutes and then opened it and left it ajar (using an oven mitt) for the next 30 minutes. I made the cake 2 days in advance and it tasted perfectly fresh when I served it. My only complaint regarding this cheesecake is the price. In my part of the world, the cake priced out over $45.00. The Lindt chocolate alone was $15.00.

This is the second Easter in a row I've made this cheesecake. It's so yummy and so creamy. Everyone loves it. The white chocolate flavor really comes through.

i made this but with a lot of changes... first, i made this a white chocolate raspberry cheesecake but instead of putting the fruit on top i made a coulis by cooking the fruit with sugar, pureeing, and straining... and i swirled this into the cheesecake batter right before baking. i decorated the top with white chocolate curls and whipped cream. next, instead of using the full amount of sour cream, i used 1/2 cup sour cream and added 1/4 cup heavy cream. and lastly, i baked this first at 500ºF for 10 min. and then lowered the temp to 200ºF for 1 1/2 hours. i only did this because i read that this way it becomes more like a NY dense cheesecake and i read the reviews about it being very light and creamy but i like it dense.. anyway, it came out with a lot of cracks so maybe next time i will just try the regular baking directions. despite that, it came out awesome and everyone LOVED it. maybe next time i'll try the recipe as is, but i'm still very happy with how it turned out. :)

I have been making this cheesecake for the past 4 - 5 years. It has become a mandatory addition to my aunt's easter sunday dinner. The only thing I do is I do not completely cover the cake with the sliced strawberries. I prefer to work from the outer edge in, to about 3 to 4 strawberries deep. I like to show part of the beautiful top of the cake and then put a full sliced strawberry fanned out in the center. I have also made smaller versions of this and put them in cupcake holders. It works great but cooks a lot quicker. You definitely cannot go wrong with this cheesecake - I always tend to cook the cake about 5 - 10 min. less then what they say and turn off the oven. If its a little under done don't worry A.) It won't crack and B.) When you refrigerate it over night, it becomes firm and smooth. A definite winner with this one!!!

Wow!!! This is an amazing yet quite rich cake!!. I've made a few small changes. Since I've made it in the winter, I've used fresh blueberries to cover the entire top part of the cake. Then I've used Callebaut white chocolate and I added a pinch of salt to the entire mixture. The quality of the chocolate is very important since you use a large amount of it, so use the very best quality you can find. For the cookies part of the crust, I've used the same amount, but changed the cookie type. I've used Nabisco's chocolate waffers. I also think this cake serves 16 people, since you have to serve small portions because it's very rich.but

I make this cake for my wife every Valentine's day, and it has become legend among all of our friends -- for very little effort on my part. I've found the recipe is an excellent base for any berry or sweet-tart fruit topping -- raspberry, nectarine, blueberry, and mango have all been winners. I find it's nice to make a simple glaze to hold the fruit together on the top of the cake no matter what kind of topping you choose. It looks nicer, I think, and seems to help tie the textures of the cake and the topping together.

This is the best cheesecake I have ever made (or eaten). I host a New Year's Eve party each year and made this last year for the first time. Guests were asking to take extra pieces home. It is now a New Year's Eve tradition by request. I brought it to another party, and the host and guests split the remains and sent me home with an empty pan. As I often make it in the winter, I skip the glazed strawberry topping and just make the plain cheesecake with a simple strawberry sauce on the side. But, it is so rich on it's own, most people skip the sauce anyway.

I've made this cheesecake twice for charity dessert auctions. I was told it is "the best cheesecake I've ever eaten, anywhere." I substituted 9 ounces of Oreo cookies for the chocolate wafers but cut the butter to 1/4 cup in the crust. You can also skimp a little on the white chocolate - 12 ounces works fine and doesn't change the texture. The water bath works well to keep it from cracking on the top. It's a keeper. Not inexpensive to make and you need a fair amount of time while it bakes and cools, but it's well worth the effort.

This is a great basic cheesecake recipe. It was a hit with everyone from 9 year olds to adults. I changed it from white to dark chocolate, with a chocolate graham cracker crust and added fresh blueberries to the strawberry topping after it was glazed, it was gorgeous. I baked it an additional 20 minutes, and left it in the oven an hour before putting it in the fridge. we served slices with more fresh strawberries and blueberries and fresh whipped cream with more glaze. Oh my!

This cheesecake recipe was good - helped me win second place in a baking contest we held at work (did not require an original recipe). Everyone loved the presentation with the strawberries though I placed mine a bit differently than in the picture. The white chocolate is not too strong, as some other types of chocolate can be. I prefer a drier "cakey" type cheesecake, and this is definitely creamier, but has a rich favor.

This cheesecake was expensive but worth it. It has a beautiful presentation that makes you not want to slice it. Everyone loved it and I'll be sure to make it again to impress more guests!!!

This really is a lovely dessert -- very attractive and delicious. Ive made it for twice now for 2 entirely different groups of people and everyone loved it. It's great to make ahead for a party. I used reduced fat cream cheese and peach preserves (I think any preserves that can be strained clear would work). But what's up with the 2 TABLESPOONS of vanilla?? I'm sure that should be 2 TEASPOONS, which is what I used.

After trying this cheesecake, I've become a cheesecake lover. It was very rich with a subtle chocolate flavor (I used Callebaut). I followed the recipe exactly, but baked it with a pan of boiling water in the oven. The cake still developed cracks, was hard to unmold and also hard to slice, but worth every crumb. Will definately make again!

Just brought this cheesecake to an Easter lunch today and everyone loved it. Very rich and creamy. I used Lindt white chocolate and it was just the perfect taste of white chocolate, subtle and not too strong. I cooked for about 10 minutes longer than recommended because it felt loose. Once cooled overnight it was perfectly set. All the "cheesecake snobs" in my family raved.

I got cute and added strawberries to the filling. WRONG! ruined the cake as there is too much water in the fruit

I really liked this recipe, and would definitely make it again with a couple of changes: 1) the white chocolate I used was way too strong (Trader Joe's white chocolate chips). It actually overpowered the cake. I'll either use less or change brands. 2) I think the cooking time is a little off (but I guess this depends on the oven). I'd probably leave it in for another 10-15 minutes, as the cake was a little soft and gooey when it was cut. Everyone raved, though! I brought this and the carrot cake with maple cream cheese icing to a birthday party, and the cheesecake was the first to go. It looked very nice and professional - just like the photo. I especially loved the "height" of the cake. It reminded me of something you'd see in a gourmet bakery. All-in-all, a wonderful recipe that makes for a light and creamy consistency, a beautiful presentation, and very happy guests! One more thing...make sure that the cake is completely cooled before refrigerating it. I started out with no cracks on top, but a couple formed as it cooled in the fridge. I guess it really doesn't matter, though, since the gorgeous strawberry topping covers up any boo-boos.

Rating: 4
A real show stopper! I think mine fell a little more than it should have, so instead of making it like the photo, I just piled the strawberries in the crater. I glazed with strawberry jam and Grand Marnier, only using enough to make the berries shiny. My husband isn't a big cheesecake fan and he ate two pieces and said this one is a keeper. I agree!

Rating: 4
I made this to take to a potluck at the house of a guy that I wanted to impress. Let's just say that he spent the whole night dragging people into the kitchen to show it off - and the taste was even better than the "wow" presentation! If you make nothing else on this site you HAVE to make this cheesecake. It's really really rich though; definitely something to serve after a light dinner. It wasn't the easiest recipe to make but definitely do-able, and the results are undoubtedly worth it.

Rating: 4
Fantastic to die for cheesecake - simple to make - I omitted the glaze but kept the strawberries on top. When serving I made a mixed berry sauce to go on the base of the plate before placing a slice of the cheesecake on top and dripped double cream over the top - magic. All my guests gasped when I brought out dessert.

I Change the crust to graham crackers with pecan, walnuts and dark sugar and it rocks! one solid dessert.

If you never make any other dessert in your life, people will still think that you are a dessert genius. I made this over the weekend for 10 people. There was nothing left but the bottom of the springform pan. The only thing that didn't really work for me was the glaze. It was pretty unremarkable but who cares when the rest of the cake tastes like this. I used the chocolate wafer cookies for the crust which was DELICIOUS. However, someone recommended that I try it with a layer of brownie batter. I might try that the next time. Make this dessert, you won't regret it.

Best comment was simple - "Did you get this at the (Insert your local gourmet bakery name here)" Tried slicing the strawberries a little thinner - made it prettier and easier to scarf down.

This recipe was very easy to make and the technique of leaving the oven door open for 30 minutes so the top doesn't crack is great! Everyone loved this cheesecake, and I've made alot in the past. I have to say, this was the smoothest and richest tasting ever. I now have to make this for every Christmas gathering!

Not being a big fan of cheesecake or white chocolate I decided to make this thinking it would be easy to resist & stick to my diet. WRONG! All my guests loved it and I am now a cheesecake convert.

It was good, but not extraodinary. Such a large amount of white chocolate makes it expensive, but I couldn't taste it in the cake too much. Needs something else in the way of flavor. And I wonder what was all that sticky clear stuff that kept oosing from the cake as it was cooling? Made a complete mess, kept running even 24 hours later.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year, and used candied cranberries (recipe on this site) instead of strawberries. It got rave reviews from everyone, including my brother-in-law, who owns a restaurant. The pan-of-water trick really helps make sure it doesn't crack.

The recipe for white chocolate and raspberry cheesecake on this site is so much better than this one. The crust was not good and there wasn't much to the cake filling. Didn't hate it but would make the other instead (switch strawberries for the raspberries if needed).

This is a yummy cheesecake...my mom can't figure out where I learned to cook like this...! The white chocolate flavor is just right, not too strong or overpowering, and melds with the strawberries...my guests were very impressed. Will make again, but not MY personal favorite cheesecake.

For those who like their cheesecakes light as opposed to dense, I followed a friends advice(who is a baker) to add a pan with about an inch of water and place it on the rack below the cake pan when baking, this is what makes the cake "light" but you may have to adjust the cooking time by as much as an 1/2 hr. I'll use this method from now on, works great!

This is an excellent cheesecake, easy to make and extremely attractive to present. Strawberries were not in season in Ohio when I made this recipe and therefore were very expensive at the time. I spread a later of Spreadable Fruit (Strawberry) over the top then made a thin lattice design of white chocolate over that. Layered halved strawberries around the edges. It was absolutely great.

My culinary friends know me as "Cheesecake King", but I have never received more compliments than on this one. I made it for the first time last Easter to rave reviews. I usually like to adjust recipes to my own taste, but not this one. If you decide to make it, don't change a thing. However, it is a lot of batter for a 9" springform pan. To ensure that it bakes to completion without cracking, I would suggest cutting the baking time by about 15 minutes, turning the oven off, and allowing it to cool in the oven with the door open for about one hour. The strawberries with the brandy-apricot glaze taste heavenly and make a spectacular presentation. This is definitely an elegant and refreshing warm-weather dessert. This is also a pretty easy recipe if you are dabbling in cheesecakes for the first time. Hey, if you crack it, no one will ever know, anyway.

Love at first site! This cheesecake looks great and tastes even better. I cooked it for 1hr 30 min with a pan of hot water on the rack, and it came out perfectly -- no sagging, no cracking (the center was still slightly sunken after 1hr 20 min). The strawberries do weep after a few hours, so keep that in mind if you won't be able to eat it all in one sitting.

I often just dump the package of Oreos in the food processor, filling and all. The Cuisinart mixes it up so fine, you can't tell that the crust was never scraped off. In my opinion, fresh Oreos make a better crust than the pre-ground boxed Oreo cookies crumbs.

Rating: 3
Hey Alexandria, You can buy oreo cookie crumbs from Nabisco, they're usually located in the baking section - next to graham cracker crumbs. However, when I went to the store, they were out out so ended up doing the same thing you did. Ah, the lengths we'll go to for cheesecake. I made this and thought it was one of the creamiest, smoothest cheesecakes I had ever made. Loved the mellow flavor of the white chocolate. I didn't arrange the strawberries over the top, I served them on the side so we could experiment with other toppings. The next day, we tried a gooey caramel sauce drizzled over the top and it was even better!!!

Rating: 4
This is absolutely my very favorite recipe ever. The best cheesecake I have ever had, much less made myself. It makes such a beautiful presentation. I made it once without the pan of water and once with it; without was definitely drier tasting, but still good. The top cracked, but it's covered with strawberries so you can't tell. With the water it was very moist and creamy. One thing: I've never been able to find chocolate wafer cookies or crumbs, so have ended up scraping oreo filling off an entire box of oreos, twice. Anyone else have that problem?

This was my first go at a cheesecake...a special request for my son's birthday. Wow, was it a hit! It completely filled at 10" springpan. I substituted low fat cream cheese and sour cream and the quality was not compromised at all. I used the water bath, and because the top was quite brown at 1 hour, turned the temp. down to 300 for 10 more minutes. It was evenly browned and perfectly formed. I used reduced calorie orange marmalade. I'm now famous!

I love cheesecake, and this was probably the best I've ever had (got the same response from several other people as well). It wasn't all that hard to make, and it was positively divine (and it looked pretty, too). Two words of caution: (1) the recipe makes a very large volume of filling - so use the biggest bowl you can find (I used a standard large mixing bowl and the filling was right to the brim); and (2) the filling was more "jiggly" than I was expecting after the prescribed time in the oven - it was actually done, but I was worried. Anyway, this was fantastic and I plan to make it many more times (maybe with different fruit? or with fruit sauce during the winter months?).

I made this awesome dessert for my son's high school graduation party. It was incredible. There were about 35 people there. I also served a wonderful chocolate cake, jerk chicken, honey- glazed salmon, cilantro-jalepeno potato salad and a rice- black bean salad. All the food was a hit and worked great for a party. I made myself a timeline during the week and everything was perfect. This cheesecake was the "bomb"! People were actually claiming they were getting another slice for their "friends" outside. Make this -you'll love it!

I made this for my husband for Father's Day since he loves strawberries and they are in season. It came out very well - looked just like the picture and wasn't difficult. I used the pan of water in the oven as mentioned in earlier reviews. Two pints of strawberries sufficiently covered the top of my cake. I also left out about 1/3 cup of the batter after reading other reviews that suggested dividing the batter among two pans, and it came out perfectly.

Rating: 4
Outstanding! This is by far the best cheesecake I have ever made, and I am a baker for a natural/gourmet food store. I made this as a special order for a customer who wanted an extra special dessert, and he just raved and has now ordered 6 more for his daughter's wedding rehearsal dinner. We also now sell it as a regular dessert, and it always gets rave reviews! Followed the recipe to the letter, and used the pan of water...fantastique!

Wow!! What an amazing cheesecake. I had never made a cheesecake before but decided to try one to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust and since I was without brandy had to substitute cognac for the glaze. It all worked out beautifully. I had no sagging or cracking (used the pan of water in the oven trick, mentioned by previous reviewers - thank you!), the cheesecake was incredibly moist but held its shape when cut. My party guests routinely told me it was the best cheesecake they had ever had. I have now been recruited to make it for an upcoming baby shower.

I am the Queen of Misshapen Desserts: They taste fine, but the cake layers lean, the pie crusts shrivel, and the brownies singe at the edges. This thing, however, looked as though it was done professionally (I kept sneaking into the kitchen to admire it). Even better, it was easily the best-tasting and best-textured cheesecake I've ever had. I made it for Easter, and the family raved (and two people who insisted they didn't like cheesecake snorked down an entire slice each). This has just become my standard recipe. I used the pan-of-water-in-the-oven trick that other reviewers suggested.

I always read the comments after looking at the list of ingredients to see if this is a doable recipe, and still i was unprepared for how easy it was to make and how perfect - i mean PERFECT: better-than-restaurant quality. I have never made a cheesecake before, but thought i'd give it a try. WOW. I used apricot brandy along with the apricot preserves and the glaze was luscious! Also, i used "Bakers" white chocolate - i had to buy 3 of the bricks, but at $1.89 each this was not too costly - it really was a perfect end to an Easter dinner.

This recipe was a big hit. I had never made a cheesecake before. The crust was a challenge for me, the first time I made it. The recipe says 2" up sides of pan, and mine didn't go quite that far. The second time I used a few more cookies and butter and ground them finer. I've been asked to make it again because it was so fabulous!

A super cheesecake recipe. I followed it exactly the first time. The second time I made it I used fresh strawberries as well as blackberries and raspberries. This made it very colorful and just as delicious. ONly thing is, the imported white chocolate is a bit costly so I save this for special occasions.

This was the first cheesecake that I ever made, and it was absolutely delicious. I am a big cheesecake fan, and I loved this version, with its white chocolate flavor. I followed the recipe exactly as written, and added the pan of boiling water to the oven as suggested by others. It set up perfectly, and looked very professional. The crust was neither cracked nor dry. It was smooth and creamy all the way through. This cheesecake was so good that I had to give half of it away so that my boyfriend and I wouldn't eat it all!

Rating: 4
The most delicious cheesecake I have ever made! It does, however require a slightly larger pan or division between two. It should also be baked a little longer, 10-20 minutes,you don't want as much movement as suggested in the recipe. Add 25 degrees to the oven temperature for high altitudes. The best tip would be to place a pan(a 9" x 13" cake or a larger jelly roll) with at least one inch of water in it on the oven shelf below the one on which you place the cheesecake for baking. This keeps the oven moist enough to help prevent the cake from cracking. The strawberries are just as delicious on the side!

I know my rating does not reflect really what is said in this review, but I WILL make this cheesecake again and it was tasty. Before commiting to this recipe, I read all of the reviews and was encouraged by what was written. However, the cake oozed liquid after it was finished and the texture was both wet and very crumbly. I did notice some separation (like a broken sauce) after adding the chocolate (which did not appear to be too hot, but must have been) to the batter, and I think that I somehow managed to break it. I AM going to try this recipe again later this week.

I made this cheesecake for the second time for a Thanksgiving luncheon this week and everyone raved about it. I overheard a co-worker telling another co-worker that the cheesecake tasted like it came from a five star restaurant! The first time I made it, I had the same problem as the previous reviewer.. the middle of the cheesecake rose and then sank. It didn't look very pretty, although it tasted great. I think this is because I used a deep pan. The second time I divided the mixture among two shallow pie pans and they came out much better. Even though the center sunk a little, I was still able to arrange the topping evenly and cut the pie without everything crumbling to the center.

A delicious cheesecake. I made this for a friend's bridal shower and received rave reviews. My only disappointment was that half of the cheescake didn't seem to cook as well as the other, but I think my friend's oven was to blame for the uneven cooking. The strawberry topping is beautiful -- I was skeptical about being able to make the topping look as pretty as the picture depicts, but it worked nicely! Definitely a keeper!

This was a spectacular cheesecake, it is similiar to a cheesecake we ate in Door County, WI. I omitted the brandy and preserves. Instead, I poured half of the cheese mixture into the pan, poured the melted white chocolate in the middle and swirled it with a knife, sprinkled the raspberries(instead of strawberries) over the top of the white chocolate, then poured the rest of the cheese mix over.

I took this along for a 40th Birthday Party. The hostess had 6 other desserts there, but this Cheesecake disappeared before the other desserts were touched. People were even coming back for seconds. I am not a Cheesecake Lover, but this is the best baked Cheesecake I have ever tried, I will be discarding my other Cheesecake recipes. I decorated the top with strawberries, kiwifruit, pineapple and tin mandarins. I then mixed a glaze of 1 desserspoon gelatine, 1/4 cup water, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 cup fresh orange juice. lLet cool and then pour on top of the fruit, result a glazed effect. I also added chocolate sprinkles around the side, the glaze sticks these so well. A truly spectacular dessert.

This was a good, not great cheesecake. Neither my husband nor myself could taste the white chocolate in it. It somehow doesn't differentiate itself from the rest of the filling. Also did not make a crust since cheesecake is always moister without. Made a straw./rhubarb vanilla glaze on the side, nice complement.

I made this wonderful cheesecake for the first time this weekend and brought it in to work. Everyone RAVED about it. Did make a slight change: made a gingersnap crust with gingersnaps, a little sugar and some melted butter. Then followed the recipe to the letter-it is absolute perfect and perfectly delicious! Also, made a sauce to drizzle over it: Chambourd, Polaner's All-Fruit Raspberry and some blackberry brandy in the blender. Outrageous!!

I was excited to try this recipe after reading all of the other reviews...but was a little disapointed. I followed all the directions, and used the pan of water in the oven trick. The cake turned out beautiful, but I didn't think the flavor was to die for.I would use Oreo crumbs for crust next time for a stronger chocolate flavor. It was good, but not outstanding. Maybe I;m just not that much of a white chocolate lover. Also I did bake the full amount of time and it was still soft. Try the cheesecake w/ gingersnap crust in recipe search--It's awesome

This is a recipe to rave about! This cake is smooth and subtily sweet, and makes a great display. My guests could not wait to try it, and once they did, declared it one of the best tried yet!

I also highly recommend using Lindt white chocolate for a velvety smooth taste and texture.

This was really good cheesecake with a couple of exceptions. I thought it was a little too dense for my taste (reminded me of a New York style cheesecake which I don't care for). I would cut the baking time by 20 minutes and place a pan of boiling water in the bottom of the oven for humidity (keeps both the crust and the interior softer and smoother). With these adjustments for personal tastes, I would rate this top notch.

I've made many cheesecakes in my time, but this one is absolutely at the top of the list - everyone said it's one of the best they've ever had! The white chocolate adds extra richness and creaminess to the cake, and the texture is just right. The only modification I would suggest would be to spread a thin layer of the glaze on top of the cake before putting the strawberries on - it acts as sort of a "glue" to keep the strawberries in place. Otherwise, this recipe is a real "keeper"!

This was really delicious!!!Served it at a dinner party and everyone raved about it! Was not difficult to make. Wouldn't change a thing. Will be at the top of my dessert file.

This was my first attempt at making a cheescake and it was easier than I thought. This recipe is outstanding!!! When finished it looked awesome, just like in the magazine and tasted out of this world. No one could believe that it was not from a bakery.
