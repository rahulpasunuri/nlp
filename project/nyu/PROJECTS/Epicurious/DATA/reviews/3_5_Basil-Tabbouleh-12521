This dish is tasty, however the traditional Middle East tabbouleh is not made with basil. Increasing the parsley and omitting the basil is much more authentic (and, I believe, more flavorful).

I substituted quinoa for the bulgar, and this was delicious! I let it sit overnight to make sure the flavors melded, and it was so good that my guests didn't even notice that I substituted grains. I will definitely make this again.

Hubby and I loved this tabbouleh, however, I would use more basil next time as I couldn't really taste it, and I LOVE fresh basil. Also put in a couple of minced garlic cloves. Served in fresh pita bread.

Preparing all the herbs was more trouble than I expected. I think I prefer tabbouleh without the basil; I'm going to experiment with other recipes. Other than that the ratios of ingredients seemed to work well. The result was enjoyable, but not striking enough to make this a recipe worth repeating given the effort.

This is delicious and I will be making this again. Next time however, I will use less onions, or eliminate the scallions (green onions). Otherwise, it is wonderful!

Great recipe, though I would eliminate the allspice and cucumbers. My husband is from the Middle East, and if he had his way, he would make me do this practically everyday. It is a little time consuming chopping up everything so fine.

This is a fantastic recipe! I served it with falafel and everyone loved it! I used a medium grain bulgur and it worked just perfectly.

My friends can not get enough of this. This is a very refreshing, easy to make, and goes with everything or great by itself.
