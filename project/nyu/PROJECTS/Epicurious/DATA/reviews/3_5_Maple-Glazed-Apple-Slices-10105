For a fancy dinner dessert that is easy to prepare, buy the Pepperidge Farm pastry shells, and spoon the warm apples on them when you pull them out of the oven. YUM.

I hate to be harsh and ruin a 100% rating, but I just don't get what all the fuss was about over this recipe. It was ok, but I was not bowled over with excitement. I'm sure there are better apple desserts out there and when I find one, I'll let you all know.

Yum, Yum!!! This would be great over ice cream, or you could assemble it with shortcakes and whipped cream. It's tasty and easy to make.

I used regular pancake syrup (added more), added some sugar (about 1/2 cup or so) and a package of sausage links. Adding the sugar allowed everything to have a nice caramalized glaze. Also added about 1/8 tsp nutmeg...the result....an outstanding breakfast side dish, good with pancakes. Try it for your next brunch but have patience for the sugar to caramelize!!

This was a very tasty dessert. I too added a bit more syrup and served it over vanilla ice cream. It's a perfect Fall treat and was thoroughly appreciated by all.

I beg to differ with the chef who rated the recipe before me. I find that three tablespoons of maple syrup isn't enough for my family-full of sweet teeth. I made the apples with two and a half tablespoons of undiluted Grade A syrup and two pounds of apples, and then found that each serving needed two tablespoons of syrup just to make is sweet enough. The syrup made a marvelous garnish, though, so I will probably make it the same way next time. Also in future, I recommend for everyone to use either Devonshire cream or vanilla ice cream for a final sweet touch. All in all, a triumph in cullinary endeavors.

This dish was wonderful, it's not as high fat intake as some other desserts I've made. being in Japan for a short time I made it for the japanese people,& they really like it with less syrup. so it's not a real sweet dish just perfect I say! Thank you for the great dish...
