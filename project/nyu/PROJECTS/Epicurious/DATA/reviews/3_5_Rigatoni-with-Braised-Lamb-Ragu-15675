I don't know what all the complainers are talking about. Maybe they just don't understand basic cooking techniques like degreasing and reducing. This recipe benefits from both and just because they aren't spelled out in the instructions it doesn't mean you shouldn't take it upon yourself to take these steps if it looks like they're needed. I used shanks (only three because they were large) and followed the recipe exactly, except as noted above. It was incredible. I agree that the Parmesan is a must. I also added crushed red pepper at the table. In fact, the only change I would make is to use fusilli instead of rigatoni - holds the sauce better.

Tough, greasy lamb swimming in watery sauce and guests due to arrive within the hour. That was my experience with this recipe. I should've read the reviews first. Then I would have known enough to substitute leg of lamb or stew meat for the shank.

This was very good -- really easy to make and lovely on a cold day. I used leg of lamb. The sauce was thin, but I boiled it after taking the lamb out to shred. Wonderful and will definitely make again.

I can't rate this as mine was too dissimilar. What I tried I wasn't impressed with. I used lamb kabob chunks instead of shanks, left out the basil as per other reviewers, used a dry red that goes well with lamb, and leftover chicken stock instead of the beef broth. I also stirred in about 1/4 cup of cream as per other reviewers' advice. I will try this again, but next time I'll follow it to the letter so I can give it a fair test. As I tried it, I felt it was just a very standard stew. I was hoping for something along the lines of the intense flavor of a bolognese sauce and was sorely disappointed. The texture of the shredded lamb was nice. I did enjoy the ragu sans pasta/parm with some 2% fat greek yogurt on the side.

I made this with leftover grilled leg of lamb (chopped). It was fantastic. I made a few other changes: added celery and carrots to the vegetables and used 28 oz crushed tomatoes and a couple of tablespoons of paste. I cooked for 2 hours at 325 and then I removed the lid and cooked for another 2 hours at 250. This thicken the sauce nicely. I am not rating the recipe because I changed it so much but it is a great guideline for using leftover leg of lamb.

Good mild flavor, but nothing too delicious. The lamb takes a while to clean even though it does fall off the bone. The sauce definitely needs to be reduced on its own for about 20 mins. and when serving, do not leave out the parmigiano-reggiano. Its really the only thing that gives the dish some depth of flavor.

I love braising and stewing lamb and I have to say that this is up there as one of the best. I did a few substitutions since I didn't have everything on hand. I used cut up lamb for stew with bone in, chicken stock, and diced tomatoes plus tomato sauce. Great dish...

Recipe worked but ended up using a leg and chopping it up versus shanks which were unavailable. Finished by pulsing in food processor to give it more consistensy of texture.

The lamb took more than double the time to be tender enough to fall off the bone. The shanks also made is very greasy (would another cut of meat work). The sauce had to be cooked way down and was still watery. I used the suggestion to add cream, which helped. It got compliments, but I'm not sure it was worth all the trouble!

Wonderful flavours. I doubled the herbs, added the juice of one fresh lemon and a little flour at the end to thicken. The lamb shanks need double the length of cooking time to fall of the bone.

Delicious. Added a couple of dashes of worsteshire, 1/2 cup of cream, good splash of sherry, and used thyme and marjoram instead of the rosemary. I also made it a day in advance and let it rest. I also cut the recipe by a third and it was perfect for two, with leftovers for the next day.

I about fell off my chair when I saw this because my husband and I have been going to Bugatti's to get this particular dish for 7 years now. However, let me first state, what they serve in the restaurant and how this recipe turn out are two completely different things. The sauce in the restaurant is MUCH thicker, I would venture to say they cook this sauce uncovered during the last hour to thicken it AND they most assuredly add cream. We added cream to it and it was much closer to the real deal. The other big thing, the meat is not cut, it's shredded. I'm guessing they take two forks and shred the meat, not cut it with a knife. We found the sauce worked better the next day after we cooked it down and added cream. I'm going to ask them the next time we're there why the huge disparity. I've often wondered if the recipes from restaurants are not 100% accurate.

DELICIOUS!!! If you love lamb, make this dish. Some suggestions: sub dried rosemary for fresh, bake 2 hours, and if sauce is thin, boil to reduce AFTER removing meat. I will definately make this again.

My husband devoured this - I thought it was fine but since it's pretty easy it will become a regular dish. The fresh basil completely disappeared so not necessary if you don't have it - some parsley at the end would be fine - I used more wine and doctored the sauce at the end - a little soy sauce, worcestershire -

The reviews sounded terrific so I invested in all the ingredients and anticipated a great result to serve to my guests. The outcome was tasteless, watery, and altogether a waste of time and resources. I found myself scrambling to find an alternative entree for the dinner party. I would not serve this to my guests.

I loved it, my wife loved it, and so did our Italian friend. That was more than enough validation for me! My wife and I don't like mushrooms, so I substituted some peppers, which were nice but not obtrusive. I also added the pasta to the sauce and mixed it all together for awhile, which worked well.

"I" thought this was superb. My husband doesn't like mushrooms so he didn't like it as much, but he still thought it was pretty good, and my son only ate the rigatoni, but I loved the simple richness of this meal. I made the recipe exactly as written, but I used meaty lamb chops instead (since I had them in the freezer). Delicious!

Delicious. Big hit with the guests. After it was cooked, I put on the stove top and simmered for about 30 minutes, thickening the sauce a little. This gave it more consistancy, and everyone loved it.

This recipe took a little time for me as I'm not used to cooking with meat, but I made all the adjustments the other reviewers suggested (sherry, white pepper, shredded meat) and it was delicious. I served it to my Italian neighbor and he said it was the best ragu he had ever tasted!

Loved this recipe and so did my husband. I added some sweet sherry and white pepper to jazz it up it bit. It was just what it needed. Closter NJ Chef

we loved this dish--and we are not huge lamb eaters, but this one was a true winner--hard to beat the tenderness and tasitness of braising meats. I gave this recipe to a friend and she loved it as well--I would definitely make it again!!

This was an excellent dinner! We made it based on the other evaluations and it lived up to or surpassed some of the comments. It was easy to make and delicious. I shredded the lamb meat instead of dicing because we like it better that way. I'll definitely make this again and wouldn't hesitate making it for company.

A wonderful dish. Easy to prepare but it sure doesn't taste like it. Great warmed over. This instantly became one of our favorite dishes.

I made one very minor addition: some worcester sauce. I also added the rigatoni to the meat and sauce so it could soak up the delicious gravy. A good dish!

Rating: 3
A terrific dish. I made it in the crock pot with half the amount of broth and used double strength condensed broth. While the pasta water is on the stove, boil the sauce on the stove to reduce.

This dish is die to for! Oh my stars, or should I say forks. I just couldn't seem to put down my fork. It was just too perfect. I made it for my whole family, dinner, when the inlaws came to visit. Let me tell you they are hard to please. Now, this dish surely made me the favorite daughter-in-law. Thanks Epicurious Food's.
