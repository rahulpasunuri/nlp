I thought this was OK. The flavor was subtle. My husband liked it better than the date filling, though.

This filling was too sweet and bland. Even doctored up with some lemon juice and peel it wasn't tasty enough to waste on good hamantaschen dough.

This was a great filling -- the crunchy walnuts were a great contrast to the smooth apple butter and sweet raisins. Could not have been easier to make. (I never found an unsweetened apple butter though and it still turned out well -- not too sweet.)
