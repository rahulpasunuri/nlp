I love this tart! And so does everyone who tries it. Perfect choice for a dessert on the healthy side while still being very elegant and easy to make. If there's any left over, and that's a big if, it tastes great as a breakfast pastry!

This is an elegant little tart. I enjoyed the creaminess of the filling with the apples, and the slightly grainy texture is typical with other frangipane desserts I've had. I thinned the apricot jam with a little applejack brandy, it gave a nice touch. Next time I'll make this with my all-time favorite pastry crust, from Epicurious' Strawberry-Mascarpone Tart. Also, the Braeburn and Galas are the right choice for this tart, nice balance of tart and sweet.

Beautiful yummy and easy to make! my guest licked the plate clean! The phyllo dough makes it very light.

I thought this tart was absolutely delicious! I made one evening this fall and my boyfriends father had eaten so much of it and even took some to work with him that morning! He is a really picky eater too. I am making a second one now and everyone in the house is excited about it. This tart has such a beautiful look and glistens when you put the apricot jelly on it - I use all fruit jelly, personally. I am surprised to see that others didn't like it as much!

There are so many fantastic apple dessert recipes that I would not bother making this one again. I found it blah. Perhaps the almond meal I purchased was the culprit...

beautiful and easy. We used galas. Made a few minor changes: Almond paste was wonderful, can use for any almond paste application. I added 1tsp almond extract and a little more vanilla. I also used cinnamon sugar in between the layers of phillo and sprinkled on top of apples. Added sliced almonds on top of the apples before baking. Used all the glaze. So good, ice cream killed the delicate flavor- eat it without.

A sure fire crowd pleaser. Bottom line: can't miss dessert. I took it to a Harvest Wine Tasting party. By the end of the night, the plate looked like it had been licked. After reading another reviewer's comments, I added 1/2 t. almond extract and 2-3 T. more of whipping cream to the almond cream -- perfect. I served it with whipped cream flavored with Starbucks Hazelnut liquor. Can't wait to make it again. Presentation is dazzling.

Iwas quite disappointed with the results of this tart. I thought it was because I made my own almond meal but now I read that other reviewers did that with satisfying results. I found the tart lacked flavor aside from the apricot preserves, which masked the apple, and I didn't care for the texture of the almond cream. Icannot recommend this dessert.

I made this as a week night treat with gala apples and almond meal. My sister who likes anything apple loved it. It's different...not a show stopper. We ate it warm, with a scoop of good vanilla ice cream.

It worked well with Honeycrisp apples and the glaze was certainly desirable aesthetically. However, there was far too much glaze. Unwisely I used it all, which made the tart tooth-achingly sweet and distracted from the apples and almond.

Beautiful,delicious,easy to make. I got raves for this desert from 10 discriminating cooks. Couldn't find almond flour, so made my own with almonds and my food processor. My almonds had skins on, so I guess it's called almond "meal" instead of flour. I did add 1/2 tsp of almond extract to the cream and a light sprinkle of cloves over the apples, just to put my own touch on it.

This was fantastic! I ended up making it with honeycrisp apples, and a homemade grape jelly rather than the apricot preserves. The jelly based glaze didn't add a lot of flavor, but gave the apples a nice shine and a bit of moisture--though mine did not take nearly all the glaze the recipe calls for. And the almond 'cream' was a really nice surprise, as the texture became almost like a secondary layer of crust. The almond mixture was a bit thick, so I think next time I might use half and half or milk to make it easier to spread. But I really love the recipe, and will keep making it throughout the fall.

Liked this a lot. It was different, simple to make, showy and had wonderful flavor. My hint is to slice the apples cross-wise, not length wise. The recipe text was not clear on this. And forget about adding cinnamon. We tried it, and it adds nothing.

I had high hopes for this tart. I really wanted it to work. Sadly, it didn't. The textures are all wrong and the almond cream does not taste good. If I were forced to make it again, I'd use puff pastry rather than phyllo dough, but I won't be making it again. There are better apple tart recipes.

Wonderful. Did not have almond flour so ended up grinding frozen blanched almonds in a food processor. Worked out fine. Did not find the phyllo crust greasy at all and I had used more butter than the recipe called for. Fast, easy, beautiful, and made a nice impression. Discussed at dinner what other combinations of fruit and nuts could be used with this, so will experiment that next time.

unbelievably good. straight forward recipe & easy to assemble. it was a huge hit at our dinner party (and an even bigger hit for breakfast this morning!). i will make this again and again. the only down-side is that the almond meal/flour was very expensive ($10 for a small bag). i need to find a use for what's left over so i feel less guilty for buying it.

This was a delicious dessert, so elegant looking and perfect for Fall. I made a few changes which worked quite well -- instead of almond meal I used hazelnut meal (available at Trader Joe's). I soaked the apple slices in apple brandy until I was ready to put them on the tart, and then I used a little apple brandy with the apricot preserves. I served this with a dollop of whipped cream flavored with Frangelico (hazelnut liqueur).

Nice taste, but honestly, it was a lot of work for the end result--which seemed not that far removed what you'd get using frozen puff pastry for the base--instead of phyllo--and marzipan thinned with some heavy cream. Next time, I think I'll stick to Tart Tartin--what it lacks in almond flavor is more than made up for when you pull it from the oven and flip the pan over onto a plate.

The almond cream gets cooked, no need to worry about the raw egg! Will be making this soon, looks great.

I hate to be the spoilsport, but I thought this was awful. I love Dorie Greenspan, Braeburn apples, phyllo and almonds--when this issue came, I made the tart at once for friends who were coming for dinner. I wish I hadn;t. The phyllo tasted very greasy beneath the apples. There was far too much almond filling, and while I liked it, it just didn;t seem to work overall with the phyllo and aoples (textures were unbalanced) And while the design of fanning of the apples is nice, I actually thought the final dessert was pretty unattractive. There are many many more delicious apple tarts on this site; don't waste your time with this one (especially on guests!)

Hi, This recipe is great, and does not contain any raw egg as another reviewer thought. Relax, people! Enjoy!

I would definitely make this again. Lovely flavours, fairly simple to assemble (and I dislike phyllo rather intensely!), and an excellent way to capture fall food.

Loved the flavours in this. I thought the phyllo crust was a little greasy but the overall effect was delicious.

Made this for dessert tonight to follow roast pork. Very easy, very pretty. I will confess that I felt compelled to sprinkle a little cinnamon sugar on the tart after baking and before glazing. Baked apples without cinnamon just felt...wrong. We ate it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top and some of us also added a small dollop of dulce de leche. Yum!
