I wish that I had read the reviews before I committed more than half of my cherries to this pie. Even at room temperature it was cherry soup, and both my husband and I found the orange, almond and cinnamon flavors totally overpowering.

I made a few tweaks: skipped the orange juice and zest and instead used cherry juice; used sour "kriek" cherries from a jar as it's not cherry season now, but still only used 1 cup of sugar plus a packet of vanilla sugar instead of almond extract; made a lattice top. I also used a generous 3 tablespoons of cornstarch as per the suggestions of others. The pie was really good (family loved it) and considering how little time it took to make, this recipe is now in my recipe box.

I made this except omitted orange juice and orange zest. Substituted 1/2 tsp. vanilla instead of almond extract. I used about 5 cups of cherries and my own butter pastry dough. The pie set fine after it cooled slightly, I used 2 heaping tbsps of cornstarch.

It might be a good recipe without the orange juice/zest. But with the orange, it's Bada Bad!

The flavor was wonderful, but my pie didn't set either. the second day, out of the fridge, it was okay. I'm really glad I got a pitter before I started, because that was a pain but the way it tasted was worth it. Somehow I came up woefully short on crust! I had to get creative with the top, making a strange appearance, but tasty.

The taste was good, but the pie was way too runny-- I should've used tapioca as my instinct said, not just corn starch! If I make this pie again, I think I'll invest in a pitter, too.

This Pie is delicious. The citrus juices and zest in addition to the almond extract are what exalt it beyond your regular, runof-the-mill pies. I would highly recommend this one!

Being a fan of the HBO show "The Sopranos", I laughed when I saw this recipe and had to make it for my husband and some friends who came for dinner. It's delicious, and a very pretty pie.

I read the reviews for this recipe and even though they were mixed, decided to give it a try. I'm glad. What a great pie! The lemon juice/OJ were NOT overpowering (I skipped the zest) and the pie set well with about 2 T cornstarch. In addition to almond extract, I added some vanilla. Delicious!

A neophyte cook from Covington, LA (near NOLA)Last year I baked this pie exactly to directions and it was great, however this year I am watching my sugar intake and decided to reduce it. I use a 9.5" glass pie pan, following the recipe except for these things: 5 cups bing cherries (sweet), 1 tbl OJ, fresh, 3 tbls fresh lemon juice, 3 generous tbls of cornstarch, 1/2 cup vanilla sugar to no sugar, (I place a vanilla bean in my sugar container to add flavor),no cinnamon, no salt, 1/4-1/2 teaspoon almond extract, no orange zest (too overpowering), no butter (I don't think it needs it). In addition I used Gourmet Cookbook 2004 edition's recipe for Almond Paste lattice on page 762. That was really a nice touch. It wasn't too overpowering and my family loved it. I hope my suggestions are helpful for others! Good Luck!

Way too runny - the cornstarch doesn't act well as a thickener in this pie. What a mess!

I made this pie with 3 1/2 cups cherries, using 1 tablespoon orange juice, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, 1/4 cup cherry brandy (Pucker's brand), and increased the cornstarch to 3 tablespoons. Since the cherries were sweet, I did not add any sugar. I also deleted the orange zest due to one of the reviews I read which was not complimentary. The liquid mixture was added and mixed with the fresh cherries. I then blended all the dry ingredients in a bowl, then mixed all and put into the pie crust, dotted it with butter and followed the baking instructions. My husband, who is my best critic, claimed it was the best cherry pie he ever ate! I liked it, too and I am not normally a maker of cherry pies. I'll definitely make it again, using my altered recipe.

Cherry works nicely with the subtle flavors of almond, lemon and orange. I don't live in Cherry Land so I used two bags of frozen sweet cherries, incorperating the juice. Added a bit of tapioca as well as the corn starch.

I thought the lemon/orange juice would just add a bit of tang to this pie; instead, it overwhelmed the pie very unpleasantly. My family tasted it and thought I'd lost my mind, as a beautiful cherry pie was ruined. Never again.

A cook from Sequim-this was the best cherry pie we've ever eaten. My husband pitted all the cherries, bless him.

I used fresh tart cherries, pitting is easy with just a squeeze between your thumb and forefinger. The seasonings made it the best cherry pie ever. I used 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup Splenda. I also used non-trans fat shortening sticks for the crust. It received raves from all who partook including me.

I was excited to try this and use up the last of the big bag of fresh cherries I brought home from Washington State last week. It was good, but we decided that we are not fans of sweet cherry pies - I much prefer tart cherries in a pie. As for the crust, I am trying to avoid all trans fat so instead of the shortening crust linked to here, I made an all-butter crust that came out fabulously (following the Cooks Illustrated proportions). But next time I have bing cherries on hand, I'll stick to making homeade ice cream (cherry chocolate chip and chocolate cherry - yum!).

It wasn't that this pie wasn't tasty, but more that I guess we are cherry pie purists and prefer the original. If you are looking for something a little different though, this might be the recipe for you. Other than the cherry pitting it was quite easy.

It wasn't the best cherry pie ever. Actually, I didn't really like it at all. But, if I couldn't find a better recipe, I would make it again

I received some "best cherry pie I've ever had" compliments on this one! I used fresh bing cherries, substituted King Arthur Flour's "Pie Enhancer" (great stuff) for the cornstarch and used almost 1 cup of sugar. MMMM mmmm.

Loved this pie! It's the first time I've made cherry pie with fresh cherries and it won't be the last! I used 6 cups of cherries. The pie crust is very similar to what I usually make and I'll note small changes there.

Easy to make. I would use more than 4 cups of Cherries.

Instead of using a pie top for this dessert, I used a crumble topping. I found this dish very easy to make and quite enjoyable. Give it a try!
