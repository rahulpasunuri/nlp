Excellent, a keeper. Lovely subtle flavor, grilled on the charcoal grill. I made the salad with mixed greens and the herbs, also served risotto with a touch of rosemary for a birthday dinner. Everyone loved it.

This ws very nice. I did not make the salad part.

Excellent marinade for a quick tuna dinner. I did not add the sugar or the onion, and broiled the tuna instead of grilling. I will definitely make this again.

While overall decent combination of flavors, the lemon was overpowering (and I love lemon), the sauce didn't work out AT ALL (a pool of oil with bits of other marinade ingredients floating in it!) and I was largely unimpressed. If I were ever to make this again, I would cut down on the lemon, definitely bump up the pepper flakes, ditch the marinade after it's done marinating and make a new lemon-BUTTER-caper sauce possible with rosemary and pepper flakes.

The store didn't have tuna at the time so I used Mahi Mahi and it was still very flavorful. We loved it. I did not make this salad I just made a garden salad.

I didn't do the herb salad, but the tuna recipe was very good. I will make it again, and will probably use a bit more crushed red pepper next time.

I didn't make the salad either, not because it didn't sound good, just didn't have the ingredients on hand...BUT the marinade sounded so good, I went for it. I thought that capers and rosemary sounded like a strange combo at first but they proved to be quite complimentary. We are trying it again with a white fish tonight...

Fabulous! I added much more red pepper to the marinade to give it a little kick. I didn't have a grill available so I just broiled it for 2-3 minutes per side and it turned out perfectly. I'm not a huge fan of parsley so I added one cup of parsley, another cup of tarragon, dill and cilantro and then 2 cups cups of spring mix. It was just enough bite without being overpowering. I highly recommend the lemon juice and olive oil dressing. The simplicity is excellent with the tuna. It was huge hit!

I thought this dish was exceptional. I did not make the salad though. And, instead of either "letting marinate at room temperature 1 hour OR, chilling for 4 hours," I actually performed both those steps which resulted in an even more herb infused tuna. I also did not grill the tunas. Rather, I cooked them in the broiler setting of my toaster oven.

I thought this recipe was delicious! The tuna was incredible topped with that sauce. Unlike some other reviewers, I enjoyed the herb salad, although I reduced the amount of parsley I used in it. Also, I thought there was plenty of sauce as the tuna had great flavor on its own. I served it over a risotto primavera and it was a perfect combination. I would definitely make it again!

The tuna and the marinade/sauce were excellent, but that herb salad? Um. . .no. Didn't work at all. But I will definitely make this again without the salad.

Simple and Delicious. I also doubled the marinade for 2 tuna steaks as my husband is a sauce lover. I added some cubed, cooked potatoes to the herb salad. Will definitely make this again!

I don't know how good it tastes with tuna, but I used cod instead and it turned out great. It's all about the marinade.

Used albacore and marinated for about 2 hours. Didn't make the Herb Salad but had the Golden Beet Salad with Fennel from this same site. Fish was EXCELLENT!! Would definitely make it this way again!

Wonderful flavors. Used ahi tuna and marinated for about 3 hrs in frige and 30-45 minutes at room temp. Didn't use the caper juice but used white basalmic (which is usually what the capers are in). Definite keeper.

Ny wife and I each felt this was both delicious and unusual. The combination of the caper juice and the lemon peel and juice give a real zip to the dish. I also prepared one half of the marinade for two tuna steaks, and found this was more than sufficient as a sauce. I used regular salt, rather than sea salt, and I doubt that it made any difference. I will definitely prepare this again.

It was delicious! Instead of tuna I used salmon, but the caper sauce was really good - and onions did the trick.

Good, but after a few bites I thought the caper flavor in the sauce gave it the slightest bitter aftertaste. Probably wouldn't have been perceptible just as a marinade, but without using the marinade as a sauce, it would have been unremarkable. I made 1/2 the marinade for only 2 tuna steaks, so if making the full recipe, you may want to make extra. It wouldn't have made enough for 3 steaks. Did not make the herb salad.

Made this without the herb salad. Thought it was just good. Nothing spectacular.

I made this last night for dinner without the herb salad and it was delicious! The flavors worked together very well. Don't skip heating the marinade and adding it on top when serving.
