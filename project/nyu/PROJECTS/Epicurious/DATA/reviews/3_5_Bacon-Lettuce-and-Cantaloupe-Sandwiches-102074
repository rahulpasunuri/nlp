When tomatoes aren't doing it, a simple bacon, lettuce, cantaloupe sandwich with mayo is fantastic. I didn't bother to make the sauce, because it would dirty a dish. It's also good without the bread.

Thought this was a very interesting mix of flavors. Perfect for a Summer lunch or light supper.

The sauce was terrific when I tasted it for seasoning before assembling the sandwiches, the melon was sweet and perfectly ripe and the bacon crisp and golden brown. I put it all together, took a bite, expecting a delight, and found it to be too sweet by half. This is just one of those cases where the various flavors don't play off each other, but instead, all pile on. It might be possible to remedy the problem by adding more lemon juice and less or no honey to the sauce, and using a tart green, such as arugula, instead of lettuce. But by then it really wouldn't be the same recipe.

Made these for a Fourth of July picnic and they were yummy. Used iceberg because that's what I had on hand. Might try next time with toasted bread or foccacia, but will definitely make again!

TRY IT ! It sounds bizarre - but it's delicious! This sandwich offers a much better alternative to the not so-great-tomatoes in the stores right now in my area. People who are not wild about uncooked tomatoes will especially love this. Sometimes you just have to try something new, and sometimes it works! Great sandwich!

My wife promised me a divorce if I made this again, but cantaloupe is hard to find this time of year.

Tasty and easy to prepare.I love bacon and this sandwich was good although I still prefer a classic BLT.

This is as good as any sandwich gets ! The sweet melon, crispy bacon and lettuce and this mayo is brilliant. Even bent the whole wheat house rules and used a chewy French bread. Relished every bite.

Yummy! My husband wont eat raw tomatoes, so this is a wonderful alternative for our family. Our eight year old likes it even better than BLT, but there is room in my heart for both! Delicious.

This sandwich is very refreshing and delicious--especially with the yummy spread. My husband dislikes tomatoes, so this recipe fits the bill for an easy, delicious summer sandwich. HE OFTEN REQUESTS IT! I'm a tomato lover, and I have to admit that I like this sandwich even better than a BLT.

There are very few meals that satisfy adults & children alike! This is one, my children loved it and so did my husband & I, It was easy and hearty.
