Not bad, but there are better recipes that not only taste better but are easier and cheaper.

I used slender whole carrots, the kind that are sold with the tops still attached, and left them whole for a pretty presentation. Used only half of the butter and doubled the broth. Reduced the liquid to make a nice thick sauce. I didn't have any cilantro, but it was still fabulous!

bright elegant aromatic carrot dish! highly recommended. i used duck sauce instead of preserves as i thought it'd be less sweet. next time i will add a splash of lemon too.

Yummy combo of flavors. It was nice to apply curry and the cilantro to veggies. I used plum chutney.

Yummy! Cooked carrots are not usually our favourite but these were great. Like others I increased the ginger and garlic, and cooked the carrots till they were totaly glazed with the sauce. Made them ahead and reheated in the micro-then added the cilantro. I like the idea of subbing chutney for the jam and I will try that next time.

Even people that don't like carrots, love these. I added a bit more garlic & ginger. Fantastic.

Great, easy, interesting crowd pleaser. We added 1/4 onion, a little extra curry and ginger, and substituted chutney for the preserves, for greater bite and complexity.

I used pineapple preserves. The dish was sweet, but a hit with my grandsons.

Pulled fresh carrots from the garden for this one. Had to use pear preserves since I didn't have apricot but the result was outstanding.

I made this as a main dish for my vegetarian family members, replacing some of the carrots with cubed yams. I also added caramelized onion and increased the spices. Dried apricots did add interest! Keep adding water so it doesn't become dry. We ate it over Bhutanese red rice with cashew nuts and lemon juice, which has a great texture. Delicious!

I liked the creativity of cilantro and carrot, but I have to say I have never understood the idea of adding sugar to an already sweet food. My husband liked it quite a bit, though. I might try it with the chutney next time, and taste carefully to avoid too sweet an effect.

Made this for Christmas dinner along with several other yummy items...this one won the raves! I also used chutney instead of apricot preserves, but did add a few dried apricots. The carrots took considerably longer then 6 minutes to cook, so I added a booster shot of sauteed curry, ginger and chutney at the end.

Great color! I used the bagged, small carrots left whole, which made the dish a snap. I increased the dish by a half and it was just enough for six. I used the 1/4 cup of broth..but certainly no more or it would be too runny and not enough glaze. Cilantro is the perfect touch.

Tastes good, looks great. Since people recommended precooking the carrots and reducing the amount of broth, I figured the underlying problem must be that the 6-minute cooking time is too short. I doubled it to 12, which definitely did help with cooking the carrots more and thickening the sauce. But then I got impatient and took it out. Next time, I will try an even longer cooking time. I also will increase the apricot preserves slightly.

I, too, precooked my carrots and then finished them in the sauce, omitting the broth, but used a splash of white wine. I had no apricot preserves so used mango chutney, a good choice. If you expect to serve 4 as indicated, I'd make one and a half times the recipe. Carrots shrink in the cooking (at least mine do!). I finished up the dish with a squeeze of lemon as a counterpoint to the sweetness. This carrot recipe deserves its good reviews.

Simple and great. We cook the carrots about 8 minutes and some salt and pepper. Good with pork.

Great! This is a wonderful weeknight dish (maybe even good enough for company too!). So easy and impressive results. I used ground ginger, water instead of broth and just 1/2 TB. dried cilantro (added before the cooking time). Next time I will try fresh spices for sure!!

Wow - this was really different & delicious! I didn't have apricot preserves, so I used a package of "duck sauce" from Chinese take-out. This is an excellent way to prepare carrots.

Wonderful! All my guests commented on the carrots. I precooked the carrots, omitted the broth, added a dash of salt, and made the curry mixture ahead of time for a terrific result.

Our family isn't keen on curry so I used slightly less. I used one "ice-cube" worth of homemade chicken broth. The results were great. Try these with leg of lamb.

This was fantastic. I would however reduce the liquid so it was less brothy and possibly precook the carrots a bit. Otherwise its a keeper and would accompany any meal not only for taste but to add a splash of color too.

The only thing I would different next time is precook the carrots, leave the chicken broth out and follow the rest of the recipe. There was too much liquid for any thing to cling to the carrots. With the changes, this recipe could be outstanding!

I have made versions of this in the past however the combination of the carrots with cilantro, curry and apricot preserves set up a perfect blend for any palate. My guest tell me that they dream about it!! How good does it get? My Friend Sean, request this every time I see him.. i.conover@herringcreekhideaway@yahoo.com

This is a great recipe. I did not have apricot preserves but happended to have a partial bottle of Major Grey's Chutney to substitute. This is a truly wonderful way to prepare carrots. I may have prepared them a little bit past the crisp-tender manner that is mentioned in the recipe, but it won't matter, the recipe will not let you down. This is also a very easy recipe to prepare.
