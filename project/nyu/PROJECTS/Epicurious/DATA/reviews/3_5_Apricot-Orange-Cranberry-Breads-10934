I always read the reviews before I make a recipe so I eliminated the apricots as one-too-many flavors but otherwise made this as written (I've made it now with walnuts and pecans and I prefer the walnuts). It was very good - not too sweet or tart but it was definitely crumbly. The second time I made it with sturdier bread flour and used just water rather than the milk which can contribute to a tender crumb. The flavor was the same and the bread might have been a little firmer. However, the change that made the most difference was using an electric knife to slice it. The slices came out much cleaner and firmer and didn't even have to be particularly thick to keep from falling apart. Sliced this way, this makes a pretty and tasty holiday gift. I will definitely make it again.

Oh, yummy goodness. This is a rich blending of sweet and tart, orange, cranberry, apricot and walnuts. All the flavors came through for me. I did not have the small pans indicated, so baked the breads in 2 9x5 pans. That may explain why the bread is a bit difficult to cut -- I think the bread would cook more evenly in smaller pans. I'll make the effort to get small pans next time (or use muffin pans).

Made this exactly as written but prepared in 2 large loaf pans - delicious and nutritious. Will definitely make again.

My friends love it when I make this bread! I usually wind up with enough for 2 bundt pans, or a bundt pan and a small loaf pan. Either way, it's a winner with everybody after Thanksgiving when cranberries are plentiful and cheap!

I used 2 1/2 cups cranberries, cooked in a larger bread pan which increased cooking time to 55 minutes. Very good! I will cut the apricots next time out as they are overpowered by the orange and cranberries and not worth the money or effort.

Made for Thanksgiving. Definitely would make again. Lots of requests for the recipe. Almost cake-like and very delicious. Kids and adults both loved it. I made it in a bundt pan and increased cooking time to about 50-60 min. It was very pretty sliced to serve. Only substitution was no dried apricots so I used dried, sweetened cranberries instead.

Love, love, love this bread! Was looking for a recipe to use up fresh cranberries leftover from Thanksgiving, and this was just the ticket. I added 1/2 c. dried cranberries (LOVE cranberries, & the fresh were looking a little sad), increased the nuts (pecans--don't care for walnuts) to 1 c., substituted heavy cream for milk (needed to use it up), and zested two large navel oranges. Smells & tastes divine. Will definitely make again, maybe with sugar substitute.

One of my first graders, Tucker, says "Mmmmmmmmmmm!!" WE had a lot of fun making this.

My first/second graders made this and had the following to say: Cranberry outside, cranberry inside! Mm, yum yum!- Micaela. This bread is very crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. You can make it with wonderful fresh picked cranberries. It's amazing. Bon appetit!- Isaac. This is the best bread I have ever had in my life- Nathaniel and Ian. I don't like the bread that much. The cranberries are too sour- Lauren. It's sort of good- Lila. I don't like it- too sour- Willa. It's rich, and sour because of the cranberries- Sophie. It's good, and the apricots are a tiny bit sour- Mika. It's almost the best bread I've ever had- Maddy and Kamile. I preferred the making better, but the bread is good. The recipe worked so much it got fluffy- Anna. The cranberries is what makes it taste good- Braden. It's great but it needs less apricots- Aidan.

Great recipe-my husband and kids loved it just the way it is. We like cranberries so I did not follow tips to reduce amount in recipe and was happy with the results.

Found this recipe a couple of years ago and we love it. I also make it as two 8x4" loaves. So glad it's cranberry time again! But this is Brother Rick Curry's recipe and I'm disappointed that the site doesn't credit it to him. What I really can't fathom is how epicurious has only ONE cranberry bread recipe. I wanted to try a different one and the reviews here are always so helpful.

Fantastic! Reduced flour by 1/2 cup, soaked 1 C of choppped apricots in Grand Marnier, reduced chopped cranberries to 1 C as suggested by previous reviews. Better the next day. Put all of the batter in a well-greased angel food pan and baked for 1 hour.

This is absolutely delicious! It's not too sweet, combination of flavors is wonderful. Have made it several times, although when I tried as one large loaf for some reason the texture was not the same. I will always make 2 loaves, as per recipe. This has become a "cranberry country" favorite in our house.

This bread tasted pretty good, tho I don't think the apricots added anything. But it was way too crumbly, you can't slice it nicely.

This got rave reviews from friends and family. I also decreased the cranberries to one cup and increased the apricots to one cup and it turned out great - even for this novice baker! This will be a Christmas standard for me from now on.

I used plumped dredged currants instead of the apricots, omitted the nuts, and baked it in a single large loaf pan- it came out great!

This bread is delicious! I would suggest cutting the amount of cranberries from 3-1 cup. Make sure to chop the cranberries to a medium-coarse consistency. I increased the apricots to 1 cup. The bread was moist and very flavorful without being too sweet. The kitchen smelled great too!

The combination of dried apricots and cranberries gave it a sweet, tartness. Absolutely delicious and a hit with the family! I would definately make it again.

I think it's great! I have made it every year for 9 years at Christmas.

This bread is not at all sweet, and because it calls for so many fresh cranberries, they rather overwhelm. Fresh cranberries baked into bread, I discovered, are very tart, and since the bread is not very sweet, well, it didn't go over well at all.
