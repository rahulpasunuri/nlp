Subtle change to regular whipped cream; I served it with a chocolate bread pudding and it was tasty

excellent! I added part brandy and part vanilla liquer... it was wonderful, and made an excellent pair with chocolate brownies and chocolate souffle.

I also tried a variation with grand marnier.. and it turned out great. Substitute the brany with any liquior.

Great on top of Molten Chocolate Cakes (Bon Appetit, 9/99). Also delicious in after-dinner coffees.
