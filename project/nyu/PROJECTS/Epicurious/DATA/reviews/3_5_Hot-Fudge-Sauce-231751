Love this! I no longer buy hot fudge sauce from the grocery store. Since I always have chocolate on hand I often make it when I have some cream I need to use up. I make a batch, put in in jars, and pop it in the freezer. Then we have hot fudge sauce for topping vanilla ice cream. Just warm what you need in the microwave.

This is really a ganache served warm, not a genuine hot fudge sauce. When it makes contact with the cold ice cream it seizes up and gets very thick and cold. So it tastes good, but if you are looking for a warm, gooey hot fudge sauce that has that wonderful bit of saltiness (like ice cream parlor hot fudge), try another recipe.

Super easy and super yummy. With all the leftover, I used it as a chocolate fondue with strawberris and bannanas the following day. Rewarms perfectly.

I tried this recipe and the Gourmet 2004 hot fudge sauce. Both were very good but this won the taste test by a hair, reheated better after multiple times, and is simpler to make. I added a teaspoon of vanilla.

Disclosure: I only had unsweetened chocolate on hand and had to make do. Still, I am happy overall with the product. The texture is more like a paste or frosting than a sauce per se, but the ease strongly recommends it.

This was a good chocolate sauce, but it did not seem like hot fudge sauce to me at all. It didn't have the right texture. The taste and quality are fine, but this isn't the recipe I'm looking for.

This is now my go-to fudge sauce. The first time I made it, I also made the October 1999 Fudge Sauce recipe from Epicurious.com, which uses butter instead of corn syrup, so I could do a taste test. Made them early in the day, chilled them, and reheated them - this recipe was the clear winner for reheatability!! The butter in the other recipe separated out, never to be reincorporated. This recipe is easy to adjust for sweetness: replace part of one of the chocolates with milk chocolate for a sweeter version or with unsweetened chocolate for a darker version. I like the recipe as written for dipping fruit, and a bit less sweet than this for ice cream or pound cake. Extremely fast and easy to make, as well!

This was excellent. I was desperate, company was comming and my cream went bad. I happened to have some evaporated whole milk which I used out of desperation-it was great. I even saved a few calories!!!

Excellent, easy and all it's supposed to be. Rich, intense chocolaty flavor that may not be sweet enough for some, but as a contrast to the sweetness of ice cream, we thought it was excellent. Really thickens up in the fridge and will need to be left out or gently reheated before use. A keeper!
