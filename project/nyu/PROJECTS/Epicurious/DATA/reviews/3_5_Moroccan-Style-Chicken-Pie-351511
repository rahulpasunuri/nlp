We LOVE this recipe, and make it as often as we can. I also use the filling to make samosas sometimes, which is equally delicious!

I made this as a stew, skipped the Phyllo dough altogether. I also kept the thighs whole (didn't shread the meat). After cooling, stuck the dutch oven pot straight into the oven for 40 minutes. Served with french bread. Delicious! And SO easy. May 45 min prep time all in? This is a keeper.

This is hubby's favourite dish ever. I only put the phyllo on top and I add an extra sprinkling of cinnamon.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was fantastic! I don't know what other reviewers are talking about with bland because this was anything but - the different spices, fresh herbs and raisins in the chicken mixture were a delicious combination, and the subtle sweetness of the almond mixture in the pastry layers was a perfect compliment. A hit with my husband & two year old as well!

This was very disappointing.we all felt the filling was very bland but at the same time too rich and heavy.i wouldn't make it again.

I made this for a dinner party for 8 and it was served as an appetizer. After baking it was a little on the runny side to cut into nice neat wedges. I don't know if it needed to sit longer or what but the sauce was very thick when I put it into the pie plate. Unique combination of flavors.

I had made a moroccan chicken pie previously and remembered loving it. I made this one last night and I felt like this can not be the same one I made a year or so ago. It was pretty bland. The other recipe on epicurious (which I found after realizing that this is not the same recipe I had made) is called Moroccan Chicken Pot Pie. It has olives in it as well. It is incredibe. This recipe is okay, but the otehr one is exceptional.

I really liked it, and find myself craving it 1 1/2 hours after supper, but nobody else in my house wants it again. But, saffron in a dish tends to have that effect on me! I followed the recipe exactly, and did not find it very time consuming given the result. If I did make it again, I think I would chop the chicken rather than shred it, as I found it didn't slice very easily with the long pieces of shredded chicken.

I followed the recipe exactly, and I would describe the outcome as BLAND. Not at all worth the time it took to make it.

I've eaten B'stilla many times and this is nothing like good b'stilla. Lots of work for a mediocre meal. If I ever want b'stilla again, I'll make the real thing. Don't waste your time on this one.

didn't follow exactly as written and my husband still loved it. he gave it an 9/10, so it was def worth the 2-2.5 hrs. my onion was mushy inside, so i substituted a shallot and carrots because they were all I had on-hand. it turned out ok with this combo. in fact, i might decrease the amt of chicken in the future and add some more vegetables (as there really aren't any in the recipe right now). next time i'll add them at the same time as the raisins. also, for those of you for whom this will be your first time working with phyllo (as it was mine), don't open it up and unroll it to have it warm up to room temperature - the stuff dries out! it also tears quite easily, but don't stress. it still comes out delicious. i also skipped the part where i was supposed to chill the filling before putting it in the phyllo. this alteration also seems not to have affected the recipe. not sure why you're supposed to chill it, sure seems pointless to just reheat it in the oven.

I have made this dish numerous times and it is easy, tasty and looks fabulous. It is not as time consuming as most b'stilla recipes are, yet it gives you all the flavor. You can use the filling in other forms as well, if you don't like using phyllo. Omit the salt in the almonds as others suggested, but stick to everything else. Enjoy.

I loved this recipe and so did my Moroccan husband! It`s an easier americanized version of a popular Moroccan dish. It`s still time consuming but I think it`s worth the effort!

Time-consuming, but worth the effort. It was a great combination of flavors. As several others mentioned, the chicken filling did take more time to thicken.

Has anyone made this recipe with puff pastry instead of phyllo? If so, I'm curious to hear how it turned out. Thanks.

One of the best recipes I've found in BA and my family's new favorite dish. This recipe alone is worth the cost of my year's subscription. Well worth the time to make it.

My family loved this recipe. I used a square pan so i could skip cutting up the phyllo sheets. I also cut down on the calories by spraying the sheets with butter flavored Pam, and using the real thing on the top. Came ou t great. My friend also uses the Pam sray on her homemade spanokopita, and you don't notice the difference. I will definitly make this again and for guests!! Just need a good morocan dessert.

This was delicious! It took quite a long time to prepare, but it was well worth the effort. Next time, I may omit the almond mix, because the crunchiness of the almonds takes away from the smooth taste of the filling. However, overall, this dish is a winner!

This was pretty good - if you are not a fan of cinnamon in savory dishes (like my boyfriend) you will probably not like this dish. He like it ok, but it wasn't his favorite - he probably won't want me to make it again. He liked the crust though (i used 2 TB sugar). I like the filling a lot. I added diced carrots and potatoes to give something extra to the filling.

This was very good, would definitely make it again. I had several friends try it, and upon smelling it (the sweetness) and knowing it had meat in it, they were wary, but when they tried it, it was a hit!

Great recipe - enjoyed over dinner with friends. Accidently grabbed a box of puff pastry from the freezer, by the time I was assembling, it was too late for thawing phyllo. Turned out really well actually (guests suggested keeping the recipe as is)... I sprinkled a bit of the sugar/almond mixture on the bottom and on top of the filling, but significantly cut down on it and the butter. Turned out great. (Agree the sauce needs to be cooked down quite a bit - allow time for this).

Great combination of spices and sweetness. This was a big hit.

Delicious! Just a tad bit too sweet for my tastes, will try using 2Tb powdered sugar next time. My husband enjoyed this as well.

This was superb! Surprisingly easy to put together (if you're at all accustomed to working with phyllo), and a truly delightful combination of flavors. I ended up making the filling one night and putting it all together the next, just because that's what worked with our schedules ... but I do think chilling the filling in the fridge overnight actually helped the sauce thicken; it was perfect. Next time I'll try making individual servings (more like spanakopita triangles).

Delicious. My kids raved. I boiled the sauce longer to thicken it up and added sliced almonds to the filling. I also made it in a 9x11 dish using whole sheets of phyllo. Nice dish and worth the effort.

This was good, but a lot of work. Nice to try once, but I won't be making it again.

This was a very savory recipe that was fairly east to make. The filling turned out to be a bit runny but otherwise the flavor was great and it reheated nicely

My husband loved it! I skipped the cilantro and used sultanas in place of raisins. I also used 8 phyllo sheets evenly and 2tbs raw sugar in place of the icing sugar.

Turned out delicious. The chicken sauce mixture took a bit more time to thicken up but everything came together much more quickly and easily than I expected. The pie looks delicious out of the oven and reheats well too.

This is delicious. I used boneless chicken breast instead of thighs since they are not available here. I thought the sweetness in the phyllo was perfect with the spices in the filling.

I was a little worried when I tasted the sauce on the chicken and, despite the lovely color, found it really bland. But, once it was put together with the phyllo dough/nut mixture, it was yummy. Next time I'll use less butter on the phyllo layers as it got a bit greasy after 40 minutes in the oven. Interesting and tasty.

forgot to note that I added several cloves of chopped garlic just before adding the spices to the onion mixture. Can't imagine a dish like this without some garlic.

I made a more traditional Bstilla many years ago and this one brought back great memories of it. It will be a bit strange if you are not used to sweet savory dishes-but if you are willing to go outside the comfort zone it's a winner. The phyllo I could find a the local market was only 9 inches wide-so had to improvise a bit-but phyllo is so forgiving it was beautiful. I just trimmed the edges and piled the scraps on top for decoration. It is even great reheated in the oven to re-crisp the phyllo.

I made this for my fiance and we both loved it. Really delicious. I will definitely make it again, and will probably even serve it at a dinner party. Very easy too.

I had a chicken b'stilla at a Moroccan restaurant a week before making this recipe and felt that mine was better even though the restaurant's was delicious. The spices in this dish are very mellow, they are not meant to be overpowering or intoxicating like a curry would be. Though, I would advise to leave the salt out of the almond mixture. This is meant to be a sweet and savory dish, and the filling is savory enough. When serving I sprinkled with powdered sugar for appearance and taste... that's how it was served in the restaurant and I thought it was a nice touch!

I would use less sugar next time as it was a bit too sweet but overall we liked it a lot. Will try something else for the saffron next time.

It was too sweet and not enough exciting flavor despite the spice. I won't be making it again, but it was worth a try.

As much as I love these flavors I really found this to be way too rich with nothing to cut the mouth-coating layers of butter. It was a bit of a pain to make as well. My hubby loved it though, so maybe I was just in the mood for something lighter.

Wonderful. The perfumed air of the kitchen as this was baking was intoxicating. I didn't mess with cutting circles the shape of a pie plate, just used squares of phyllo to fit an 8x8 square pyrex dish. This recipe was a great find to use up leftover chicken from a roast the night before. I imagine it will taste even better on the 2nd night. The size of this pie was perfect for 2 meals for 2 people

Wow. This was fabulous. The spices in the chicken combined with the almonds and spices in the phyllo were perfection. This was my first experience with making something Morrocan myself, and so I followed the recipe almost exactly - however, I did not have saffron, and I used allspice in its place. No, these are not similar spices, but it worked. My husband said this was dinner party material.

No need to actually shred the chicken thighs. Just cut them into chunks. Delicious spices. YUM!
