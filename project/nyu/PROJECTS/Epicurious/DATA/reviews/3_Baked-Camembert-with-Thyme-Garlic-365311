do you really think 3 degrees makes a difference?

There are 454 grams to a pound, but paper burns at 451 Fahrenheit.

I haven't made this recipe yet, but with other similar recipes, the intent is to make multiple slits and insert thin slices of garlic. This should impart a subtle garlic flavor throughout the cheese but not be over powering. Consider using roasted garlic. Paper burns at 454 degrees so 400 degrees shouldn't be a problem for a wooden container.

Are you really supposed to put the Camembert with its wooden box in the oven at 400°? Wouldn't you risk having the box catch fire?

From re-reading the recipe, I think the author means to put all the garlic slivers in one piercing which would delicately flavor the camembert. Having the garlic all together would also make it easier to take to take out if you weren't intending to eat it. I know, who wouldn't eat it? If you're not using a ripe camembert, more garlic would definitely help the flavor. Hope that helps. Haven't made it yet but sounds delish.

I need clarification. Do I pierce the camembert with one hole, and push all to garlic through that - or do I make an array of multiple holes with a few garlic slices inserted into in each? Also, I love garlic, so why only ONE measly clove?
