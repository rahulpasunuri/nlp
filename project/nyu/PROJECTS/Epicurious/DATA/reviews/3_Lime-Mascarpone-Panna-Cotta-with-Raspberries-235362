I substituted some better buttermilk for half of the heavy cream. I also cut back the sugar to a 1/3 cup. I added a couple more tablespoons at the end before I poured it into the cups. This was so easy. The raspberries in the melted butter were so good. I used honey instead of sugar. Huge hit at a dinner party.

This delicious desert popped up as "vegetarian", which it is not (Gelatin: protein from bones, cartilage, tendons, and skin of animals). I made it anyway, but beware if you or your guests are stricter than I!

Really easy to make and super tasty! This was perfect as a summer dessert, and I'm a big fan of lime so it was a hit. I made this for my family and everyone gobbled it up. Even though it's made with heavy creamy ingredients, it still tasted light somehow. I think it was the lime and tartness of the fruit sauce that made it that way. I will def make this again!

I wonder if this recipe would be as good using low-fat cream and cream cheese? It sounds like a winner - I'm not a fan of Panna Cotta because it's normally (to my taste) boring but the lime makes it sound like a keepter!

I made this just one day after reading. It is 105 degrees here and I needed to do something cool and fruity. My wife licked the inside of the glass she liked it so much. The one thing I may change is next time instead of whisking by hand until smoothe I may put into the Kitchenaid and whip to a higher fluffier stage. In any case I will be making this again.(warning: do not investigate the ingredients...It is a heart attack in a glass!)
