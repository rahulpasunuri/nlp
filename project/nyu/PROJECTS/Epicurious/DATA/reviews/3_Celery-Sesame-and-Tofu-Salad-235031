This was good, I also added some extra soy sauce and sesame oil and rice vinegar to the dressing. And I cooked the tofu a little with some oil, sesame oil and bragg's.. for a little extra taste! YUM!

I really like this, and I agree with another reviewer that the magic is in the contrast of the crisp celery with the soft and cool tofu. I didn't find the salad bland as others did. I think freshly ground black pepper and seasoned rice vinegar may have played an important role? I love this for a simple, no-cook salad with a good amount of protein! (Nice for vegetarians!)

I've had "sesame snacks" from Capers in Vancouver and thought these might be similar. I used 4 tsp of veg oil and 1 tsp of sesame oil as some said they were oily. I added more sesame seeds too as the celery didn't seem like a good choice to me and I omitted it. I like them as a finger food kind of snack, but not as a salad. A good organic tofu gives best results!

I'm always looking for good tofu recipes, so I tried this. It was supremely boring and required lots of iterative additions (more rice vinegar and soy sauce, added chili-garlic sauce, scallions, ginger, etc.) to make it palatable. It's just too oily to begin with.

Simple and surprisingly delicious. I could have eaten the entire bowl by myself it was so yummy. The savory sesame, the heat of the black pepper, and the zing of the rice vinegar are so tasty with the milder tastes of the tofu and celery. Make sure you use a good quality fresh tofu, not the stuff in foil lined cardboard boxes. The celery is a perfect crunch to contrast with the softness of the tofu. Even my father, who has always found the notion of 'raw' tofu unpleasant, loved this dish. If I could give it five forks, I would.

i thought the basic idea was good, but i added lemon juice and some olive oil instead of the vegetable oil. i also added sriache chili sauce 'cuz i like spicy food.

I should have known this would be too bland by simply reading the ingredients. Tofu and celery have almost no flavor on their own, and this dressing is mostly oil. I added extra sesame, extra soy sauce, and even a minced shallot to salvage this. Nothing worked. Too bad.

Loved it! Creamy and crunchy with a tangy dressing, it did need a bit more soy sauce but it was delicious and I will definitely make it again.

Even the extra soy sauce and vinegar couldn't save this dish from boredom. The combination of celery and tofu was odd to start with.

This was good but I would saute the tofu next time; it had started to get sloppy by the time I opened by lunch box.

i teamed this up with a side of white rice and it was perfect for a light dinner. i also added more sesame oil and soysauce then the recipe called for.

Nice and light, but I did add additional sesame oil and soy sauce.
