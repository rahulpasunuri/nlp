I made this brine (and the accompanying cherry barbecue sauce) for a Labor Day barbecue and it was exceptional. I used small spatchcocked chickens (because they were on sale). For the brine, I used soft ceylon cinnamon sticks and I smoked the chicken with a mix of cherry and apple chips for 4 hours at about 200 degrees. The subtle cinnamon citrus flavor was superb! Not mention, preparation was a breeze. Served with smoked eggplant caponata. This one is going on my list of easy and impressive summer barbecue dishes.

I made this last night for a dinner party and every one loved this chicken! Before I put the chicken on the grill I squeezed a little lemon juice over the pieces and sprinkled them with cinnamon. The chicken had such a nice flavor even without the sauce. I will certainly be making this again soon!

Very, very bland. Not worth the effort

I made this recipe for some friends, and we all loved it! A delicious, low fat alternative to the classic barbecued chicken! The cherry barbecue sauce is also great on pork chops!!

Cherry preserves were a little difficult to find, but the sauce turned out good enough that I made it again. The second time, I doubled the recipe and it didn't thicken. Still good as a marinade.

This was a big disappointment. The curing process did nothing to the chicken and the sauce was just so-so. I wouldn't make it again.
