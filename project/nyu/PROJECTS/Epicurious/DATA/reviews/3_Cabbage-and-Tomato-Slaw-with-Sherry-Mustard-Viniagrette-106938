Southern bf, who hankers at times for his chow of origin, gave it the thumbs-up, much to this Nor-Cal girls relief! *whew* I thought it was aight& definitely better than the wheat-germ and sprout infected cuisine of MY formative years.

I leave out the mustard seeds because it seems like they should be toasted first, which sounds good -- I'm just lazy.

The flavors never really melded to make this tasty. Even after a day, it tasted like cabbage and tomatoes and a so-so sweet/sour vinaigrette. I had to add a lot of salt to make it palatable, and even then it wasn't great.

I just made this last night with chicken kabobs and vegetable rice pilaf. It was delicious. A nice light salad for a weeknight barbecue. I did mess up a smidge and used balsamic vinegar with a bit of white wine vinegar...still a zesty and refreshing salad. Toasted sesame seeds would have been an added bonus with the balsamic vinegar mistake.

Great side dish with BBQ! For an interesting twist, use rice wine vinegar instead of sherry. Try various flavors of honey, I found clover and orange blossom honey to be delicious! [hint] This dish really snaps if stored for 12 hours or so before serving. :-)

I thought this turned out delicious AFTER I made a couple of changes. First of all, I thought using all sherry vinegar was overpowering, so I used about 1/3 sherry vinegar and 2/3 red wine vinegar. Secondly, even though I suppose the honey was supposed to be an integral part of the recipe, I didn't like the vinaigrette with the honey in it at all. I actually remade the vinaigrette without it. After those two changes, I loved it, and would make it again!
