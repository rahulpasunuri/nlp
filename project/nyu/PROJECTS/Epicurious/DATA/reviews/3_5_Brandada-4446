This would be much improved (4 forks?) by reducing the potatoes - 1 pound of potatoes for 1 pound of salt cod weighted before soaking it. Also, you can substitute milk for some (most?) of the olive oil. I put the finished product in a greased, crumbed shallow baking dish and put more crumbs on top and bake at 350 for about 30 minutes.

Brandada is a delicious and somewhat exotic starter for this neck of the woods even though there is a large Portuguese population in the area. I find that the proportion of potato to fish is much too great in this recipe. However, I do like the more delicate flavour imparted by the garlic cooked in the oil and then discarded rather than incorporated into the dish. It is very hard to find good salt fish these days with the collapse of the cod fishery but when you do, it is a treat.

Wonderful flavor, but I want to try it with a bit less potato. Do not do what I did - blend it all in the food processor instead of byhand as directed. Still tastes great, but is a little gooey.

I made this with a few adjustments. I added 2 slices of lemon, fennel seeds and black pepper corns to the cooking liquid. When the cod was ready I just tore it up in small chunks. I also added some milk to the olive oil.

A simple and straight forward method of making brandada. We did not serve it with anything other than sesame crackers and fresh bread--and it was delicious.

great way to enjoy salt cod (not everyone's favorite!) I soak the cod in milk to reduce the salty/fishy flavor. it makes it very tender. Also a little cream added at the end of stirring makes it super-delish.

This has become a Christmas Eve tradition in my family. I am NOT a fan of salt cod (or any kind of cod, for that matter) but the potatoes help me forget there's cod in there! It's a unique dish that is a nice addition to a cold buffet.

Lovely as a feeling for roasted red peppers, and covered in white cream and parmesan.
