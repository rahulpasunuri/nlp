I used 2 heads roasted cauliflower, 12 cloves garlic(!), a sprinkle of red pepper and a whole can of anchovies. Mixed with 1/2 lb of whole wheat pasta. Can you say yumY

If you don't have or like anchovies, or just prefer an alternative---try using 1/4-1/3 cup pitted kalamata olives pureed in the food processor w a tablespoon or so of olive oil and/or a little chicken broth. I've also made this dish without the croutons--less interesting but still good w fewer carbs and calories, too

Tried same recipe with broccoli - even better!

I made this as written and it was OK, a little bland; then I added some sauteed pancetta and it was better. With that addition I'd give it 3.5 stars.

This was superb. I used panko crumbs browned in olive oil instead of croutons and it came out great. Very nice if you don't mind having your oven on at 425, which was the only drawback since it was 90 degrees here in So Cal today. Not recommended for Texas in the summer.

Even with the olive oil reduced a bit, whole wheat penne, and whole wheat bread for the croutons, this was delicious. Made a half recipe but kept the anchovy amount at full size, which I think was a good idea. I could taste the anchovy but it was not too strong. It verged on too salty, though, so be careful with the salt level if you double the anchovies.

Love it !!! Have made it several times

I have now made this receipe 8 times. Everytime it's fantastic. The roasted cauliflour and the anchovy flavor just send me. I do agree with some of the reviewers that you should use an imported orecchiette; it does make a difference in terms of texture. Also, less pasta equals more veggie goodness. ONE MODIFICATION (and this is not a fault of the recipe, just a personal quirk) - the croutons seem a little too much for me. Instead, I toast breadcrumbs and sprinkle those along with the cheeses. My bf and I love this dish.

A simple and good recipe for making light healthy pasta with veggies. You learn the basics then can substitute different veggies and pasta shapes.

This was pretty good. Not bland. I toasted the croutons instead of fried ... don't need the fat.

Delicious! Very tasty. The reviewers' suggestions are worth following. I used only 3T oil (1T for the cauliflower and 2T for the croutons - I found that the oil remaining in the pan from the croutons was enough to coat and cook the zucchini/garlic and that the pasta didn't need any more oil); less pasta (12 ounces); and a generous sprinkling of dried aleppo pepper. I also found that 1/2 C of pasta water was enough. It sounds like I made a lot of changes but actually just reduced the oil and liquids, added a kick of spice, and reduced the amount of pasta to my personal taste. Try using a good imported orecchiette, such as the De Cecco brand. It makes a difference in the texture and bite of the dish. All the flavors came together. I will make this again!

I really enjoyed this! Many previous reviewers suggested it was bland, but with lots of salt and pepper and red pepper flakes added to the cauliflower, that portion turned out delicious. To the croutons, I added some garlic powder, Italian herbs, salt, and pepper. I also used sardines in place of anchovies and 12 oz salad pasta instead of 16 oz orecchiette because that's what I had on hand. Delicious fresh out of the pan!

I thought this dish was very tasty and very filling. I used a little less oil than the recipe called for, but it didn't seem to lack anything for it. I served it with simple grilled asparagus and it was a nice summer meal.

Quick to make and delicious - the warm croutons are the best part. I added a good sprinkling of red pepper flakes for a little heat.

This dish was really good but the anchovie flavor was pretty lacking and I even added an extra one. I would double the anchovies or cut everything else in half next time. The flavor of the veggies was really good. I kept the croutons separate until serving, as per the directions. Mine didn't get soggy but I also made them bigger, about 1".

a nice, simple pasta. nothing that special...i felt dumb for even using a recipe. definitely not worth going out specifically to purchase all the ingredients, but if you have them around, it's not bad.

I thought this was delicious, not bland, and pretty easy. It's not a spicy or really assertive dish, but I found it very flavorful and didn't even use quite as much cheese because I didn't have enough. Indulgent seeming without being all that unhealthy. The anchovies blended in giving it a depth of flavor without tasting too anchovy-ish. You do have to include the full amount of oil recommended so that it will be flavorful enough.

My 8 year old daughter kept raving about how delicious it was -- I guess she likes bland! The pasta-to-vegetable ratio was too much for me; next time I will use half as much pasta. The croutons definitely helped make the dish. Anchovies were barely perceptible.

I actually like this recipe -- it was a good first course. But after reading how others felt it was too bland, I roasted the cauliflower coated in harissa. Definitely recommend adding red pepper of some kind. Also, I think I'd trade croutons for toasted bread crumbs. But the anchovies are key!

Bland and boring

It was okay - I was not particulary impressed, but my husband thought it was very good - just needed some extra flavor, just don't know what!

This was tasty enough, but I deviated from the recipe somewhat. I used half the amount of pasta, but the same amount of other ingredients, making for a more flavorful pasta. I also used a few extra anchovies and some red pepper flakes. Next time, I will use 2 heads of cauliflower (the best part), less parsley and smaller bread cubes flavored a bit more. The roasted cauliflower is delicious and would even be great on its own.

I followed this recipe exactly, and it was delicious! I'm not a fan of cauliflower, but I could have added another head of it in the recipe without noticing. I think a handful or two of fresh baby spinach would add interest to the recipe as well.

Very, very boring and a big waste of my $9 organic cauliflower (ouch!). Maybe this would be better without the croutons or the pasta as a vegetable side dish.

I roasted fresh broccoli with the fresh cauliflower - about half each. Substituted a can of sardine fillets for the anchovies, because that's what I had on hand. Also browned panko crumbs instead of using the croutons -- I think they held up better too. Wonderful combination of flavors.

A great way to use fresh cauliflower and zucchini. I followed the recipe except for using whole grain shell pasta and freshly grated parmesan cheese-- no Pecorino Romano. The croutons do add interest to the dish, but don't keep well for the leftovers.
