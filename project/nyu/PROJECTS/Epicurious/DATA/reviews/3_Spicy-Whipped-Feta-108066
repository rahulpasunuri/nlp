This is a fine recipe - but better with the addition of a few strips of roasted red pepper (prepared at home or available in glass jars). Just throw them into the food processsor along with the other ingredients. Good with baguette slices.

Served this for a baby shower with homemade garlic pita chips. It was greeted with rave reviews. Have had many requests for the recipe and has been requested for our next pot luck evening.
