The name of this recipe implies that ice cream floats in the beer, like ice cream floats in root beer (for root beer floats). That being said, I made this EXACTLY like the recipe stated. HOW ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. We couldn't taste the brandy (afterwards I tried a bit of it and found that it was very flavorful). Not being familiar with stout beer, I used Guinness Extra Stout. Eight oz. of Guinness per float made it so bitter it was almost inedible. If I ever make this again, I will use 1 oz. of brandy and not more that 3 oz. of stout per float. So glad I didn't decide to make this part of my Epicurious' Valentine's Day Dinner for Hubby!!!

Tried this a while back with Guiness... it was OK with guiness, but I would strongly urge you to find something more dessert like of a stout... in Spokane, WA. There is the Steamplant Bar an Grill... if you have them make what they refer to as a Huckle Bourbon (Half Huckleberry stout, Half Vanilla Bourban Stout) I could imagine it would be perfect for this recipe. You wouldn't even need the Brandy... so be creative!

I actually tried this a few months ago...I didn't know that there was an actual recipe! My brother-in-law had a stout while we were having dessert and poured a little over his french vanilla ice cream. Now, I am NOT a beer fan of any sort, but when I tried it I was hooked! Here is the trick to this dessert. 1. You MUST have a good stout. Guiness does NOT count. I suggest (since it's the only one I've tried) Speedway Stout. You can get it at BevMo and other liquor stores. 2. Do NOT fill a glass with stout and then add ice cream to it! The trick is to have a bowl of ice cream and pour just a BIT of stout over it. For example, I have a scoop of ice cream and will pour maybe 3 tablespoons of stout over it (more or less depending upon your taste). The stout has such a rich and complex flavor to it, that you only need a small amount to savor with the ice cream. 3. My brother-in-law swears that Costco's Kirkland brand vanilla is the BEST you could buy. Since that is how I initially tried it, I can't complain...it was good! Again, it's not a float that you want to achieve. It's more of a topping on ice cream - enjoy!

I haven't tried the brandy in this, but I have had similar dessert at a friend's house. The key it seems is to use a thicker, stronger beer (Think American Imperial Stout, something chocolatey and more malty than hoppy), and think of the beer more like fudge on a sundae rather than root beer in a float. Don't immerse the ice cream, just get it coated. Make sure you're using rich, full-fat ice cream, I tried a float with frozen yogurt and it was a watery, lumpy disaster. Ideal beer: Young's Double Chocolate or Founder's Breakfast Stout.

Tried with the Guinness...Blech! is a good way to describe the outcome. Thought it deserved another try. This time we used Young's Double Chocolate stout and it was much better. We're going to try it out on some beer loving friends, but probably won't use this one again.

Not terrible, but not something I'll be rushing to make again. I love Guinness, and had an idea in my head of what I thought this float would taste like. I'm finding, however, that the beer is completely overpowering and bitter. Perhaps this would work better with a lighter beer, something that wouldn't compete so much with the ice cream and brandy.

Oh my. We were so hoping for something wonderful - good ingredients usually mean good outcome. Blech.... but what can I expect with ice cream and beer.
