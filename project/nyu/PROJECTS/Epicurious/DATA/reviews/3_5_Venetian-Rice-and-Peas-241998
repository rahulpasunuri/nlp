I love this recipe as I've been cooking this for at least 4 years now. My husband and every guest that I served this too were just simply wowed. First rule I guess is to use home made chicken stock. I used double the pancetta cubes and add more lemon strips than called for and lots of parmesan and freshly milled black pepper. So easy to make and lovely flavors.

This is a fine rice dish, though not as flavorful as I hoped. The parmesan is essential. I think it would be great served with some crusty french bread.

It's not vegetarian, it's VENETIAN.

In fairness, I didn't love this recipe. I left the lemon zest in after cooking the onions, pancetta, and garlic; that did not work out well for my palate, but it might suit others fine. I've had far better risottos and risotto-like dishes, but it was okay.

If you're going to call a recipe vegetarian, AT LEAST take out the chicken broth and pancetta...come on, guys.

I was dissapointed in this one after reading the reviews. It was tasty enough, but didn't really stand out as great. Peas didn't seem to add anything except a little nutrician. Warmed up like oatmeal that was too thick. OK for week night, but not a company dish in my book.

So so good! Made this for the first time tonight and it became the main course. One thing though, I cannot imagine it with out the pancetta or prociutto, it wouldn't be the same dish. This is a very good risotto that I definately reccommend.

I love this recipe! It is fast and easy and fun to cook. I use prosciutto intsead of pancetta and lots of smaller lemon zests since I enjoy the bright suprise they give a mouthful. Making it for the third time tonight - the leftovers are even better.

My husband and I loved this dish. I skipped the pancetta and still found it to be a nice amalgam of flavors. The lemon makes it refreshing! I cooked the rice for 20 minutes to that is had the full texture of a risotto. It was wonderful and definitely a keeper in my recipe box.

I liked this a lot. If I remember correctly the bottom burned a little, but made a delicious crust that we enjoyed eating after our meal. Reheated well for lunch the next day, too.

We LOVED this dish (just finished eating about 30 minutes ago). The descriptive blurb said "almost" a risotto. We found it to be a "classic" risotto. I let it go for the full 12 minutes at a high boil. I hand chopped the pancetta, onion, and garlic instead of using a processor. Also did the initial saute, WAY in advance. Also, cooked the peas in the micro, and added to the finished dish with the cheese and butter. SO, SO easy. SO, SO flavorful. God bless Gourmet Magazine!
