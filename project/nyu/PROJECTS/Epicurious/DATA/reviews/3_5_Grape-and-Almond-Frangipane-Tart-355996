in re: to "One fork due to very vague instructions with regards to the pastry dough. I thought recipe included ingredients that were to create the dough. Very confusing. by A Cook on 10/22/10" The ingredients and recipe for the pastry dough appear once you click on "pastry dough" on top of the ingredients list and follow onto the appropriate webpage on this site. Many (most) pie, etc recipes here have the pastry/dough recipes separate from the toping part.

I have already reviewed this and given four forks. Just an update on some of the questions. The instructions call for a tart pan where the bottom can be removed. This is "not" a springform pan. I cooled the shell in the tart pan and it stayed there until the filling was baked. It came out once the filling was all done and duly cooled etc. I love this recipe and this tart. A classic.

Absolutely wonderful. Followed filling recipe exactly, but used whole grapes because they were very small. I used puff pastry in a round tart pan, so the filling puffed up over the grapes, but the almonds still showed - very pretty when cut - don't forget to sprinkle with powdered sugar.

This dessert had wonderful flavors. Although rich, it was not a heavy dessert. Worthy for holidays, I'd feel guilty eating such a fat laden dessert otherwise. Pastry was wonderful, filling looks spectacular. 3.5 forks. I omitted almond extract because I was out.

This is a marvelous dessert around the holidays. Truly festive, and would amply substitute for a pecan pie. Most of the recipes I see for this use pears, which is very nice, but the red grapes add elusive sweet red wine. A big hit at dinner parties. I use the same recipe but in a standard round fluted tart pan, where the filling really puffs up.

One fork due to very vague instructions with regards to the pastry dough. I thought recipe included ingredients that were to create the dough. Very confusing.

Does anyone know if this tart is supposed to get removed from the pan and slid off it's base onto a decorative platter? The instructions are very vague about the tart pan. I want to use a springform pan rather than buy a new tart pan. This recipe sent me to the internet searching for clues...it was suggested to use parchment paper on the bottom of the pan and baking spray on the insides.

Another exceptional desert from Gourmet print magazine, sadly from the last edition. I have saved this edition along with all others from 1985 through to 2009 and I like nothing more than to flip through them, looking for inspiration. The virtual edition and blog just don't fill the void.

Fantastic. Used grapes from my boss's backyard vine... Tart grapes work best. surprised by the ease and versatility of frangipane. Will definitely be playing, using cranberries for the holidays and whatever other fruits I can get my hands on all the rest of the time. Also, actually freezes and thaws well if your grapes are small enough to not release their juices upon thawing.

Fantastic recipe. I made it in a round tart pan with removable bottom. Easy. Simple to follow instructions - and rave reviews from audience! I feel like a French baker. Made this for Christmas and making it again as the first desert for the new year!

Wow. This was amazing. I wasn't sure what to expect, since I'd never made frangipane, but decided to give it a try with the pound of grapes left over from the last farmers' market. Unbelievably delicious--tasted like amaretto and wine and autumn in a graham cracker crust. A few notes: I made mine in a 10" round pan, which the recipe offered as an acceptable substitute for the 11x7" rectangle. Fine. But I do not know how anyone could fit two cups of halved grapes on top. I had one scant cup, and that BARELY fit. I had a similar issue with the sliced almond measure--my 1/4 cup was flowing over the sides!
