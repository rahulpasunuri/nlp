this is spectacular!!!! i couldn't find fava beans so i substituted lima beans. i also added 1 Tablespoon of hot crushed red pepper, because we like things a little hot/spicy. i kinda just eye balled the measurements, using up what i had in the kitchen. i have researched scaffata, and there are thousands of variations...and this dish was a wonderful introduction to a delicious spring meal. i served it along side chicken -en papillote- w/ fresh herbs, lemon, garlic & olives and crusty bread. YUM!!!

Just made this yesterday for Easter. Loved it with the lamb, but would also cook it less. I sauteed prosciutto with the onions and it really added depth to the dish.

I had my doubts about this dish, but I was so wrong. It is delicious. I made it with the Roast baby Lamb and the Gnocchis with Tomato Basil and Olives. It was "the" perfect combination. I did not change anything about the recipe.

I could not decide what to make of this recipe. The flavor of the finished dish was phenomenal, sweet and springy and out of the ordinary. However, the texture was, well, one degree from mush. This is clearly not supposed to be some kind of nouvelle, al dente preparation, but I would still cook it a lot less.
