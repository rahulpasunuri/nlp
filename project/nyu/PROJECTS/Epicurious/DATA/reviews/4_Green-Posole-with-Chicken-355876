Really easy and a great soup for a cold winter's night. I added cumin, as suggested, as well as some oregano.

This is an easy and tasty meal that several friends wanted the recipe for after trying. I had leftover chicken thigh meat and wanted to put it to good use so I halved the recipe given the quantity of chicken and it worked out great.

I like to add an extra can of hominy to balance the chicken. I also add about an extra 1/2 cup of salsa, but reduce it down to be about the same amount as the recipe, just to get a little more flavor. DO NOT ADD SALT - between the chicken stock and the rotisserie chicken, there will be plenty.

We tried this out and loved it - quick, easy and tastes good. I found a mexican brand of hominy that is really good - it has some spices in it so I don't rinse - just drain it. I believe it is called Juanitas.

This recipe was so easy (and so tasty) that it was tempting to give it 4 forks. I added 1 tsp. ground cumin per one reviewer's suggestion, sprinkled cilantro on top and it was delicious. We loved this -- it will be part of our regular rotation.

Great recipe and my husband just loved it. The next time I make it, however, I will double the juice.

This is a nice quick-fix soup with great taste. I used an additional 2 cups of broth and added a pinch of ground cumin for a smoky flavor. When I opened the jar of green salsa it was very tart. However,once I carmelized the oninons and added the salsa it balanced nicely. Reminds me alot of pozole (Mexican soup). We garnished with chopped cabbage, onions, radishes, dried oregano. The kids loved it and the hubby was impressed!

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe. I love the fact that you can use rotisserie chicken. It makes things so much faster. We ended up using more green salsa in the broth to add some flavor and heat. Other than that, it was great and super easy!
