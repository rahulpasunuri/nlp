Very good - I used the freshest garlic possible and added a pinch of cayenne and splash of fresh lemon juice near the end of cooking. Tip - I roasted whole heads of garlic instead of individual cloves.

Haven't made this in years but, for inexplicable reasons I bought one of those bags of pre-peeled garlic cloves a week ago thinking that I'd save time and would actually use 75 garlic cloves before they expired. Were it not for this tried and true roadmap, not sure how I'd have redeemed my wasteful self. So, as a complete meal, I added some density to the soup - cubed and crisped andouille sausage and white beans - again both remnants from a few different prior meals. Success!

A fairly thick, creamy-textured soup, exactly the color and flavor of roasted garlic, but with slightly more depth (thanks to the sauteed onion & thyme). The Parmesan was overkill, completely unnecessary. It really took away from the lovely texture. Maybe a garnish of chopped chives would suffice, adding a splash of color, without changing the flavor or texture so much. Very kid-friendly dish, minus the Parmesan (surprisingly). Served with warm crusty bread & a salad.

Terrific, with gentle flavours and a great deal of "more please". My guests loved it but couldn't believe that it was "garlic" soup! Success depends on a really good homemade stock, high quality parmesan, and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. Don't scrimp!

This is so excellent it truly is to die for. I suggest giving just a small serving before a large meal just to make everyone want more. The parmesan is perfect. Just a bit on top. Next time I will add a touch of chili to the initial fry.

Delicious recipe that's reheating very well. Don't forget that you can make the roasted garlic well ahead of time. My only concerns were (a) that the soup was on the thin side - we reduced an extra 15 minutes and also added half a can of white beans - and (b) that the parmesan cheese sticks to your teeth. If I made it again, I'd experiment with different cheese.

Rating: 4
This recipe is to die for. I use my own stock and usually double it. The house smells terrific while it's cooking, guests can't believe what it is ("Garlic? You're kidding."), and it only gets better as it reheats. One word: Yum! I've made it again and again.

Rating: 4
Excellent! This dish was everything I hoped it would be. Garlicky but not overpowering. I think the Parmesan cheese and lemon juice add such a depth, they really make this dish complete. Even my 3 and 4 year old finished their entire bowl! My only recommendation is to double it if you are hoping for 4 servings as it really is more like 2 servings.

I must say this soup did taste VERY good. But the garlic smell is coming out of my pores. I had it for lunch and went to my brothers house that evening and he said he could smell a Strong odor of garlic on me. I also had some stomach problems after i ate this soup. Without getting into details lets just say i had to go to the bathroom a lot after i ate this soup. I had two bowls, so that adds up to aroung 20 garlic cloves that i ate. After doing some research, eating that much garlic in one sitting can lead to the problems i had. I will NOT make this soup again. But like i said it did taste VERY good.

I absolutely agree about making double this recipe. It's a great meal all on it's own for two, and you'll want more to freeze. I use olive oil instead of butter, or you could use half of each. I also saute the onions until they're caramelized, if I have time, though I like the suggestion to roast them in the oven along with the garlic. You can caramelize onions by slicing them about 1/4" thick, then treat them as I do the pre-peeled garlic: toss with olive oil, spread out in a thick layer on a foiled baking sheet(if they're spread too far apart they may brown too much), seal by covering with another layer of foil, and roast at 300F for about 30 min. As for the cream, I throw in a can of cannelini beans. It makes the soup creamy and hearty without the extra fat, and I personally think it goes better with the other flavors than cream. Lemon juice or a little white balsamic is excellent, but I do without the Parmesan (or just use a smattering of cheese to top) and it's excellent

Tasty, toasty soup for a chilly evening. Roasted about 36 cloves and sauteed only 8 for a smooth, sweet garlic taste. Love depth the lemon juice and Parmesan adds. Crunchy croutons would be a nice topping the next time we make this simple, savory soup!

This CAN be a great soup...BUT....the proportions are a bit out of whack ....this recipe is Great for abt 2 servings...and consequentially Parm cheese should just be a light sprinkling on top.... and some chopped parsley on top to make it shine.

I haven't made this in a long time, and wasn't disappointed this go round. I agree with other reviewers, it makes more sense to peel the garlic before you roast it. Otherwise, you end up with very sticky fingers and lots of skin stuck everywhere.. very messy. I only roasted my garlic for 35 minutes, and some of them were still overdone. I cut the butter by half, and then used that and the garlic infused oil for the onions. I also used 2% milk instead of cream, and it was still very creamy. I also used a hand blender. Lovely flavors, surprisingly not overly pungent. Good enough for garlic-loving company. :)

I really wanted to love this, as it smelled soooo good when I was making it, but it was just ok. The kids had some, but I know they would complain if I made it again. It tasted a little bitter, and I'm not sure why...definitely could have been something I messed up, so I will give it another try in a few weeks.

I've been looking for a Cream of Garlic soup to match the one my Mom used to make. This is soooo close. I didn' find it really work intensive. Just some down time in between steps. I did change the ratio of roasted to raw garlic I used more roasted and less raw. I problay only used 7-8 raw cloves. I did use slightly more heavy cream than called for only about 1/4 cup. I found the consistencey perfect but my husband would have liked it thicker. Overall I would highly recommend this soup recipe.

Rating: 3
This is good, a little-work intensive, but nice to have on hand on a chilly, rainy day. This recipe made a pretty small amount, two bowl-sized servings and two cup-sized; had I known, would have doubled this to make the work more worthwhile. Used half-and-half, which was creamy enough for us. It's nice garnished with a sprinkling of fresh thyme leaves and some warm crusty bread to dip. Will probably be even better tomorrow, as most things garlic usually are.

Really delicious flavors. The lemon is vital and the amount of cream could easily be reduced if you want it healthier. Definitely serve with crusty bread.

Like most cooks, I use a of garlic so whenever I sense that a bulb is going south I roast it. In my kitchen, roasted garlic finds its way into pizza sauces, quiches, and creamy sauces for chicken. So this soup is great when more than one bulb is starting to sprout. I love it and find new ways to change it up. To make it more of a meal, I've added sausage (casing removed before cooking with the onions and deglazing with white wine or sherry thereafter) or leftover chicken. To top it I've used leftover chopped tomatoes (heirlooms are so good with it!), chopped avocado. I've also thrown in leftover corn and/or beans. Soup - it's all about what you've got to use before it goes bad. Have fun with it!

One of the best things I have ever made. I will probably use 1/2 and 1/2 or even something lighter next time. The cream was really too rich.

Made this wonderful soup for a Thanksgiving starter, and it was the best part of an overall very good meal. I made the soup exactly as written except that I used the pre-peeled garlic cloves and roasted them for only about 1/2 hour. When I put the parmesan in the bowls, I also added bite-sized chunks of good sourdough bread to make the soup heartier. Poured the soup over both, and had everyone at the table asking for more.

This soup is wonderful. I thought it was a bit rich and will try half and half next time I make it. I only made it for myself and froze the other 3 portions. Today I had one of the portions for lunch and I think it was almost better than the first time when I made it.

I've been making this fabulous recipe for a while. I want to tell everyone of a shortcut that I found. My local Whole Foods has roasted garlic cloves on the salad bar!

Rating: 3
Good, even though I forgot the lemon and parmesan at the end. I also sub'd fat free half and half for the whipping cream. I do think it would be easier to roast 2 whole cloves in the oven rather than the individual cloves. They are hard to squeeze out of their skins when separated (and when hot). I would make this again when I am sick or trying to prevent a cold for the large amounts of garlic.

Rating: 4
Shortly after the oven door closed, the sweet aroma of garlic and olive oil danced throughout my home. I had all my other ingredients prepared and ready to go by the time the garlic was ready. For the non-roasted cloves, I used store-bought peeled whole clove garlic. (I cook a LOT of garlic dishes, so I wasn't concerned about any lack of freshness here). I also added 1 medium diced shallot to the recipe. The soup cooked up very easily and you could almost leave the cream out if you like, since once you puree it the soup does have a nice consistency thanks to the roasted garlic. I elected to use the cream though. For final seasoning, I added just a few grinds of black pepper, any additional saltiness I would leave at the diner's discretion, the parmesan would be plenty. The soup was a wonderful ballet of delicate flavor balanced with a silky texture that finessed every tastebud with its simple elegance. The lemon wedge does serve to brighten the dish perfectly. I reserve a "perfect" rating in any dish for that rare gem that is destined to become a staple in my kitchen. This dish earns that prestige. Not only does it deliver on simplicity of ingredients, ease of preparation, and excellent flavor, but the versatility is nearly endless. It could easily be turned into a fondue, a sauce (alfredo anyone?), even a braising or poaching liquid, and can be served as an accompaniment to nearly any dish I can imagine. This is truly a diamond of the kitchen. I will make this dish again soon, ready for another aromatic ballet of simple cooking elegance.

So good! I ate mine with the added lemon while my boyfriend ate his without. We both loved it! My boyfriend even suggested making it thicker next time and serving over pasta.

Mmm...so comforting and delicious on a chilly, rainy evening. To make things easier, I use a jar of peeled cloves. While they're roasting in a pie pan, I put the sliced onions in a dutch oven with a knob of butter and put it in the oven with the garlic. Give them a stir now and them and they're about ready when the garlic is. Why stand and stir when the oven will do all the work? After simmering with the stock, I just whir my immersion blender around and it's done! I add just a splash of cream but, next time, I don't think I'll add any at all. It really is so creamy on its own. By the way, I made and ate this on a Thursday night because my Friday meeting was cancelled. When I found out it was back on, I was mortified. I'm sure the garlic smell was oozing right out of my pores! It's gotta be a weekend treat for me!

This soup is really, really good. I didn't think it would end up as thick as it did but the cream took care of that. Made it w/ rosemary which was great. The lemon and cheese also really complemented the garlic.

Rating: 4
I followed the recipe almost religiously and it turned out perfect. Rounded out by the cream, the garlic flavour becomes very mellow -- none of the pungency I feared. One quibble is that the soup is rather thin. I would have preferred a thicker consistency - perhaps more onions would help? You can save time by prepping the other ingredients while the garlic is in the oven. No need to cool the roasted garlic or sautee it with the onions. Just remove the skins while warm and pop them in as you boil the stock mixture. I'd rate this 3.5 forks if the site allowed. It's not that mindblowing as to deserve a 4 but definitely more than a 3. I'd certainly make it again for its unusual flavor.

Hate to be a broken record, but this soup really hit the spot. I made it because I have a bad cold, but I'd definitely consider making it for company. As other reviewers stated, the lemon, and parmesan at the end are key.

I roasted all the garlic (about 50 cloves) to mellow out the flavor a bit from the original recipe. To add another layer of flavor, I cut up and browned some pancetta to start, saving the crunchy bits to sprinkle sparingly atop the soup at serving time and using the fat to brown the onions. I deglazed the pan with white Vermouth before adding the roasted garlic. I also made some crispy onions to sprinkle on the soup at the end. I loved all the textures and flavors mingling together in every bite -- tart lemon juice, salty bits of pancetta, crispy onion and the creamy, pleasantly pungent garlic soup. This soup was a big hit that even my friend's teenage boys enjoyed.

My husband has a cold today, so did not add the cheese,cream or butter....used 9 heads of roasted garlic, 4c broth, doubled the onion in olive oil and deglazed with the suggested vermouth....it was DELICIOUS.

I was looking for an adapted sopa de ajo recipe similar to that of Dali, a restaurant near my house, when I came across this recipe. I followed the recipe until it called for the addition of dairy products. I did not add cream or serve over parmesan, but did add fresh lemon juice. The result was very close to Dali's version only better due to the fresh thyme and lemon juice (and it is dairy free/vegan). I will definitely make this soup again.

I made this for dinner for my fiancee after she had a root canal so she wouldn't have to chew anything. I'm personally not a big fan of soup, I find that it rarely makes for a satisfying meal for me, but this was just amazingly good. I made it almost exactly as it is shown here, but I used half & half instead of heavy cream for the final part. It came out perfect, and amazingly good with slices of a sourdough baguette dunked in it. Also, while it is a bit time consuming to make what with the roasting and simmering, it's very easy to make, and great comfort food after a long, hard day. This one is definitely a keeper.

Made this soup with my husband on Valentine's Day and paired it with fresh baked Italian herb bread. We loved it.

This recipe actually tasted really good at the time. I roasted all of the cloves to avoid the raw garlic taste and the resulting taste and texture (even without the cream) was perfect. For some reason our recipe only made 2 bowls-- and perhaps this is why the gastrointestinal effects over the 12 hours after eating the soup were so unpleasant. I will not make this soup again, and in general will avoid eating 20 cloves of garlic in one sitting, whether roasted or not.

I just made this soup as a special at my restaurant (gastro-pub type of place), and it was a huge hit among both staff and customers. The only changes I made was to deglaze the onions with a tiny bit of white wine, and to include the rind of a big chunk of parmesan, chopped up, while simmering (if you've ever wondered what to do with the inedible part of parmesan, now you know). Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I served it with shavings of cheese instead of grated (use a potato peeler). Not one bowl came back without having been cleaned right out. Definately will become a regular fixture on my menu, both at work and at home.

After reading the reviews here, I decided to try out this recipe but modified it slightly. I went and roasted about 50 cloves of garlic instead of using the raw garlic called for in the second half of the recipe. It came out beutifully without a trace of the raw garlic flavour anywhere, just the dense, smoky flavour of the roasted garlic. The fresh lemon juice and Parmasan cheese were great additions, I've also tried it with gruyere and Asiago and that was equally great. Perfect for the winter with a toasty French baguette.

I had tried a cream of roasted garlic soup at the Vermont Culinary School restaurant in Burlington about two years ago and since have been searching high and low to recreate the recipe. After reading all the comments here, I decided to forgo with the raw garlic cloves you add later on and just roasted 50 odd garlic cloves instead. I added the roasted garlic to the onion and chicken broth mix and pureed all that and then added the cream. It turned out wonderful and did not have a trace of the raw garlic flavour anywhere but the smoky, intense and sweet flavour of the roasted garlic. The Parmesan cheese and lemon wedge is a perfect addition and complement. I've tried it with grated aged cheddar or a bit of gruyere and with a French baguette, this is the most excellent winter/comfort food soup.

My husband and I found we just couldn't eat it when we "previewed" it, and we love garlic.... It's simply too much of a good thing, I guess. I then tried to save it, finally had to throw it out. We were very disappointed after the anticipation and all the work involved.

I love it. Especially good for Thanksgiving - then eat leftovers next day with chopped turkey in it.

I love garlic so I put in more than the recipe called for. YUM! Because I wanted a bit more substance to the soup I added chopped frozen spinach (thawed) after pureeing but before I added the cream.

Absolutely fab - I'm 15 and easily made this recipe. The soup is very warming and rich, especially due to the cream (which I replaced with full-fat milk because we didn't have any) so the lemon is surprisingly excellent as it really cuts through the warmth and gives it a bigger ranch of flavours. The parmesean was perfect for it, and I don't think you should replace it with any other cheese if you have the choice.

That was great, although I had a tough time getting my wife to try it, after she did, she definately approved. My chicken stock was a little on the weak side, but other than that, I really liked it.

I did not use the lemon and now I wish I had, because all the comments indicate it is a definite plus. I salted only the garlic I roasted and that was plenty of salt for me, especially with the saltiness of the Parmesan. I agree with the person who said Asiago would be a good substitute. Still delicious on the second day reheated. The delicacy is sure to impress guests but we ate it all between the two of us. I will make it again for sure.

I just made this soup for the first time,and was so pleased! I wish that I had doubled the recipe. My husband and I both have dietary concerns, so I made some minor changes: substituted extra-virgin olive oil for the butter (and reduced to 1 T), and substituted fat-free half-and-half "Land O Lakes) for the cream, yet the resulting soup was decadently rich. This lacks the sharp bitterness that I have experienced with other garlic soups. I will definitely make this again.

A wonderful soup with enough garlic to cure whatever may ail you. It is surprisingly sweet and mild--the sweet, smokey flavor of the roasted garlic reigns. Trying to be a little health conscious, I used a bit less butter & replaced the whipping cream with half and half. I'm sure it's best with cream, but the half & half still gave the soup body and we didn't feel at all deprived.

We made this recipe the first time when it appeared in Bon Apetit, and we love it. We pull it out every winter, and make it again at least once. I have also used the basic broth (before adding cream, cheese, and lemon) as a base for WONDERFUl vegetable soups. We make it vegetarian, but it would probably also be fabulous with chicken in it.

I normally don't care for soups, but this is absolutely magnificent. I had worried that I burned some of the blackened garlic cloves in the oven, but they added a very masculine, smokey flavor to the soup. It's advisable, however, to go easy on the salt when roasting the garlic as it really seeps into the cloves. Still, a delicious, filling meal.

This recipe is absolutely devine! It is very rich and creamy.Definately a garlic lover's dream. My husband accidentally added a full cup of cream instead of a half cup, but it was a delicious "mistake". We also added cubed sauteed chicken. The reccomended Chianti is also a must, it compliments the soup beautifully,I will definately make this again and again!

Someone turned me on to this recipe a year ago and I finally made it tonight. OMG! It's incredible!!! I cut the recipe in half, since I was only cooking for one ... and it's a good thing because I ate every single drop! I baked the garlic bulbs whole after slicing a tiny bit off the top. Doing that also let me see whether a bulb was beginning to sprout. Don't like to use those.

Each December, we host a "Make a Joyful Noise" open house. I make four kinds of soup, many finger foods, and desserts. The Roasted Garlic Soup was the hit of the party! Thank you for an amazing recipe.

I made this soup tonight for my garlic loving husband and myself and it was good. However, next time I'll serve it as a small cup of soup for an appetizer. It may not provide enough substance for a main dish for some people. We loved the flavor, but weren't wild about it as a main dish. The best part was, per another cook's suggestion, we poured the olive oil from roasting the garlic in a dish, added extra olive oil and some parmesan, and dipped toasted French bread into it. That was incomparably delicious.

This soup has a really good flavor. It was a little thin and next time I would probably throw in a peeled potato to thicken the broth. Also I took the advice of another "chef" and used more roasted garlic and less raw. Followed directions exactly; its very easy and good.

I first made (and reviewed) this recipe in June ... since then I have made it at least 7 times, given the recipe to ALL my friends and have played with some changes - I reduce the amount of raw garlic and increase the roasted garlic. Also to cut down time, I roast the onions with the garlic in the oven. I love putting toasted pine nuts on top - but never forget to add the squeeze of lemon. I invite one friend over and we just eat this garlic soup with sourdough bread for dinner - 2 bowls each and it is gone, we fight over the last drip!! I'm going to make it again this weekend - I'm drooling just thinking of it, I'll make double so there MAY be leftovers (doubtful though!). Absolutely fantastic and delicous, make this soup!!

This soup was relatively easy to prepare and quite good. I sauteed some wild mushrooms in truffle butter and served them atop the soup as a main dish. I must add the discouraging fact that you will smell like garlic for 24 hours after eating this. I had this last night and still only taste garlic when I eat anything. BEWARE!!

I love this recipe! Very smooth, mellow flavor. I used non-fat half and half instead of the cream and it was perfect. Also, instead of the trouble of putting it in a blender, used my stick blender. Made blending the soup a snap! As other reviewers mentioned, the lemon is a must. Gives it just enough zip. Will make this often!

I have found this nics little tool to strip the garlic zippy. One rolls this tool with the garlic inside and the skins jump off quicker the Gore distanced Clinton once the monica then broke. Really is a good tool and under 5 bucks (US) Ours is a gross flesh color and has serrated edges.

(I hate people who review a recipe who didn't follow it exactly ... but sorry ... that's what I did!! I took the concept but was missing some ingredients) I didn't have enough garlic so I only did the roasted component rather than the raw ones that go in later ... turned out absolutely divine and I didn't miss the extra garlic!! A must is the squeeze of lemon, I tasted it before and thought "nice but average" after a little lemon juice it became "yum"! Even the cat licked the bowl (odd cat, normally wont eat human food but I had to fight her off this one!). For the thyme I subsituted a bit of dried parsley and dill since I had none fresh and a couple of twigs of fresh thyme cost $4 in the supermarket and for a soup, just for me, I thought that was ridiculous!

MAKE THIS!!! the first time i made it with milk instead of cream to reduce the calorie count. then i HAD to try the cream because it was so good, and fat always makes things better. that was out of this world as well, but i can't say that it was a huge improvement. basically, this soup has so much flavor that you don't really need the extra fat of cream. milk was just as good. the parmesan didn't contribute anything, but the squeeze of lemon is a must!

Hands down, best soup on the planet!! Our friends constantly request this recipe on our dinner menu. (Though we do insist that BOTH partners of a couple partake.)

This recipe is getting laminated pronto, going into my special file box. Wowza, if the Queen of England was coming over for dinner, I would feel proud serving this phenom soup! When I made for the first time last night, my boyfriend and I were arguing over the last lick. Warning, may serve 2 and not 4. I roasted the garlic the night before, but as a full head, not separated. I didn't measure the thyme, and I think the fresh herbs really complements the flavors so I would suggest using more than the recipe says, add'l thyme as garnish is nice. We used black pepper to season, but you could use white to avoid black dots. Went to Sam's and bought jumbo bag of garlic in anticipation of next time I make this dish (I think it will be this weekend). This soup is delicate and balanced and perfect for the winter season. *** Also Atkins friendly if you don't add cream at the end.

We've made this about 4 times. It's fabulous if you're a garlic lover. Quality ingredients make the difference. If you can find a dark purple garlic (not elephant garlic), this soup is even better. Gotta add the squeeze of lemon, also let it cool down a few minutes before eating.

Rating: 3
First, I must tell you that my boyfriend and I are garlic lovers - if a recipe calls for 2 cloves, we add 8-10. That being said, we really enjoyed this soup and thought that the garlic flavor was pretty mild. All the roasting and simmering really mellows it out. Definitely go easy on the lemon, my squeeze was perfect, he went a little crazy with his wedge and thought it was too lemony, add a bit, taste, add a bit more. MMMMMMMM, garlic is good!

Rating: 4
This recipe is awesome! I have made it several times and is always a success. Slicing a bagette, dipping the pieces in the left over olive oil from the roasted garlic, baking, then topping them with fresh grated parmesan cheese was an idea from a previous reviewer. This quick recipe for croutons really added to this already great soup.

Rating: 3
Don't be intimidated by the 44 garlic cloves-- this soup is divine! It is rich and mild, not too garlicky, and the lemon really adds a nice touch that cuts the richness a tad. Best of all, it is very easy to prepare. I tried this recipe out for the first time when having two couples over for dinner. Needless to say, I was a little worried that it would not turn out well. Fortunately, it was a big hit!

For some strange reason, this soup tasted a lot like cream of mushroom. Everyone loved it, anyway. I'll probably add more roasted garlic next time to boost the flavor a little bit more. The use of lemon juice was ingenious! Great combination -- will certainly make this again.

EXCELLENT!! EXCELLENT! This soup has been a huge hit every time! Have used fat free half and half with same results. Absolutely my favorite dish!

I've made this soup several times but modified it to be a non-dairy recipe. While the soup is simmering add 1/4 cup white rice. When the rice is soft, you can puree the soup and the rice becomes a great non-fat thickener (substituting for the cream). A little extra salt substitutes for the Parmesean cheese. Everyone loves it and can't believe it's all garlic and onions!

I really enjoyed this soup. i, also, was trying to re-create a soup i had in a restaurant. This soup was pretty close, and SO easy to do. I would recommend it to any garlic lover. My house doesnt smell like garlic, either, which surprised me! Two thumbs up!

Great soup, although the smell of garlic is everywhere. I was going to cut back on the amount of garlic, but I'm glad I didn't. When I make it for guests, I'll do it the day before as the smell is a bit overwhelming when it's first made.

I was hesitant to add yet another 4-fork review of this soup since it seems like overkill! Like some other reviewers, I was trying to recreate a soup I had at a restaurant, but this one turned out much better... a nice surprise. I know 44 cloves of garlic may scare some people, but it's terrific as a comfort food and yet simply elegant for company. Yummy and surprisingly satisfying! The cheese sprinkled on top is a must.

Yummy, yummy, yummy! Very satisfying meal when served with an appetizer or salad and some good rustic bread. My husband, who is often hesitant at trying new things, couldn't stop raving. The parmesan cheese and fresh lemon juice add just the right depth of flavor. This recipe is a garlic lover's delight!

I first tried garlic soup while on a bike tour of Vermont -- I could smell the soup as I rode towards the B&B -- & it smelled & tasted heavenly! This recipe is even better than the B&B's which has a reputation for the best garlic soup. My house smelled heavenly of garlic even 3 days after making this soup; but, my co-workers, who don't care for garlic, think that my scent is undesirable, while those who love garlic want the recipe. I definitely will make it again, but most likely on a vacation week as the scent tends to linger for 2 days. I will also try milk next time to cut down on the fat(I substituted 1/2 & 1/2 for my first try & it was velvety).

I doubled the amount of roasted garlic, and I peeled it before roasting. The soup was good, if oddly bland, until I sqeezed the lemon in and WOW! The flavors really popped! I served it to my teenage daughter and two adults who were visiting and everyone loved it.

This was a delicious hit for a dinner party I had. I made the recipe x 2 to serve 8 people. They were all saying how delicious it was, and when I told them there were 88 cloves of garlic in the recipe, they couldn't believe it. Be prepared to smell for days but it is well worth it and you shouldn't have any trouble getting a seat on the bus.

This was a luscious soup - the lemon and parmesan added great flavor and texture. I also added chopped chives for color. I doubled it and it came out great. Not to garlicky - mellow, but flavorful and easy. Probably would be ok with milk in lieu of cream - also if you like a thicker soup - add less chicken stock.

Delicious! I made croutons to serve on top of the soup by cutting 4 slices of a baguette, dipping them in the olive oil reserved from the roasted garlic, then baking them until crisp. I sprinkled the parmesan cheese on top of the crouton.

This is divine! I roasted the garlic peeled which takes about 20-25 minutes; I find it's much easier than squeezing out the garlic after it's roasted. If only I could find a simpler way to peel garlic...

I made this soup trying to recreate some that I had in Vienna on a rainy evening a few years ago. I thought that it was quite good, but not great, but it was quite easy to make. I skipped the cheese because it didn't appeal to me, and used half-and-half instead of whipping cream. I wish the soup was a little thicker, and had a little more sharp of a garlic taste. Perhaps next time I'll use more raw garlic and less roasted, and reduce the amount of liquid.

Rating: 4
Well, this is wonderful for a fall or winter evening preceding a small dinner with good friends. People are amazed at the relative mellowness of the soup (especially if you tell them how much garlic is in it!) 45 minutes is too long to roast the garlic, in my experience. The problem with roasting garlic in its skin is that it doesn't LOOK done when it is. I suggest checking it for tenderness at 20 minutes. Also, I let the guests serve the cheese to themselves. The dish will look a little prettier with a few chopped chives around the rim of the bowl or sprinkled around the edges of the soup.

I just returned from my wedding in Europe. We were there in Tirol for 3 weeks and we ate garlic soup nearly everyday. I returned home yearning for some good German and Austrian cuisine. This soup was EXCELLENT and made me feel as if I was back in the ALPS, I made it twice in one week. The lemon really adds to the flavor right at the end, and the cheese is what makes the consistency.

I continue to love this recipe. It had been a while since I had made the soup, so I came back to look at the recipe. I realized that I cook the onions for about a half an hour; it brings out the sweetness in the onions. Still love it - love it - love it! Still four forks in my book.

My favorite restaurant makes an incredible raosted garlic soup. This recipe is the closest I've come to duplicating it. I was not overly fond of the parmesan, and I found the lemon takes away from the great roasted garlic flavor. Next time, I wouldn't add anything to the finished soup.

Excellent!! Took a lot of convincing to get my wife to try this dish, but she was just as pleased. Made this dish exactly as recommended, minus the cream. Will use the cream next time.

It's a great soup, and not too much work. It's not necessary to peel the roasted garlic. Take the heads and slice off the top end, dip it in olive oil and season. When the garlic's done, you can squeeze and/or pull the cloves out. It's no big deal. The garlic is much more mellow than you'd expect, but some at my table still couldn't quite make it through. You really do need to know your guests. We did find tho that it dulled your tastebuds for the rest of the meal if served as a first course...I'd leave it for just a cold winter's day when the soup, bread and wine by the fire would be enough.

The key here is to have roasted garlic and regular garlic loves (already peeled) in the house, which I did when I made this recipie. The cooking time was a snap! Now, you do have to watch how much garlic goes into this soup, and I did add extra cream (FF 1/2 & 1/2 works wonderfully, beleive it or not!) to thin out the taste a bit. However, my husband and I each ate 2 bowls and, well, lets say that one is anough. If you are going to make this, buy the pre peeled and pre roasted garlic- so simple!

Disaster! I love garlic but this was WAY too much. Husband took one spoonful and stopped right there but I kept going. Great flavour but really intense and the taste was still on my tongue next morning along with a good case of heartburn and evil dragon breath! The size of the garlic cloves may have been to blame - they were big fat ones, so effectively double the amount of garlic if the recipe is based on small ones. Pungency of garlic varies too, so there's quite a large margin for error in this recipe. It is such a lot of work to make, you need to be really sure the people you serve it to are going to like it. I wouldn't risk it again. Being referred to as "Garlic Babe" by my husband isn't very dignified either....

Very good--and I am not a soup person. My husband and my toddler gulped it up. All the other reviews said "Don't forget the lemon!!! That's the key!" and they are right. Embarrassingly enough, I was so caught up in not forgetting the lemon that I forgot, of all things, the parmesan. So I collected all the bowls, poured them back in the pot, and added the parmesan, at which point the flavor went from OK to wonderful.

Terrific taste and fragrance, and easy to make. My only error was neglecting to pick up cream at the grocer, so I substituted with a blended mix of milk and sour cream. It turned out fine, but not as thick as I would have liked. Cream next time for sure. The touch of lemon juice is a great and suprising edition to the flavours. I'll definitely add this recipe to my dinner party selections!

This soup is lick-the-bowl delicious! I made it for guests and it was such a hit I made it again the very next night for other guests. The garlic is really very mellow and we did not have bad breath the next morning. I used dried thyme and Vidalia onions and both worked well. The first time I over-roasted the garlic (I thought) to the point of being quite brown. In hindsight that batch of soup had a warmer, toastier flavor that I preferred over the second batch where I roasted the garlic just until soft. The lemon squeeze at the end is not to be omitted as it really highlights the flavors. This recipe is a keeper!

This soup is out of this world. It is a delightful surprise that tickles the tastebuds. Use sweet Maui onions, they make the soup even better. Serve with your favorite salad and crusty bread. Yum!

My mother and sister came to visit me and I prepared this soup. My sister loved it so much, she would not eat anything but the soup! I will make this soup again.

I get a kick out of returning to this recipe and seeing new reactions to it. I truly think it is one of the finest concoctions I've ever had. I have made it twice more since my first review, and have used half and half instead of the heavy cream. I would highly recommend this alteration, if you are serving anything else with this soup. It's sheer heaven with cream, but incredibly (maybe too)rich. And I like rich.

The garlic was perfect and not overpowering. I agree, peeling all the roasted garlic was a pain - but I did it the night before and it made the actual prep. of the soup go a lot faster. I took a reviewer's advise and added bite size pieces of steamed asparagus. I highly recommend this - it was not only colorful - it really gave a unique taste. We ate this soup for 3 days!

This soup was restaurant quality. You must love garlic though! The whole family loved it. It was a little time consuming to make, but as it can be made a day ahead of time it is not too bad. The consistancy of the soup was marvelous!

This soup is very unique and elegant. I served it for a dinner party with rave reviews. It is so delicious that I will be making it again very soon. I substituted 1/2 tsp dried thyme instead of fresh and it works well.

This soup was fantastic! My husband and I both loved it and am looking forward to the day I make it again. Peeling all the garlic was a bit of a pain, but it was well worth it!

An easy and tasty recipe. It really does only serve two--so double it if you want it to last a little longer.

Really good, tasty, creamy soup made with a minimum of cream. The cheese and lemon really finish off the flavors. I took someone's suggestion and added wild mushroom tortellini to this just before serving, and, inspired to make this soup a meal on its own, added a bunch of pencil-thin asparagus, cut on the diagonal into 1.5" lengths and microwaved just till cooked. Actually, the asparagus was the biggest hit! I'd definitely make it again--it's quick, too, if you roast the garlic a day ahead.

yum!! This is a very good soup to serve as a first course even if it's just family. Must use the lemon juice.

I've made this several times and always get rave reviews. This time I had forgotten to purchase some fresh parmesean so I used shredded provolone instead. Tasted great! Don't forget the lemon. It's a must.

This is one of my new favorites. Don't be afraid of the large quantity of garlic. It tastes suprisingly mellow and oh, so yummy.

I've made this soup several times for guest and it always gets two thumbs up. When I want to really make em smile I add some portobella tortellini right before serving. I've never had any leftover so I'm not sure how well this keeps. I do know you'll keep the vampires away!

This soup is great!! The lemon is a must and I have found that dry thyme does as well as fresh. I make this soup all of the time and my does the house smell good - even if my breath doesn't!

This is a delicious soup with a lot of flavor. It really has the flavor of roasted garlic. I would make it again.

I make a double batch, so I'll have leftovers for the next day. I used whole milk the second time I made it, and 2% milk the 3rd time, it's better with the milk than cream. I made it for Christmas dinner with salmon, it was a big hit.

Great recipe, I always make it a day ahead to make it extra rich in flavour. One suggestion that helps make a velvet smooth soup is to pour it through a double fine sieve when finished.

Wonderful, easy and delicious. It is even better reheated the next day. I also used the leftovers with some extra butter and some cream cheese in mashed potatoes...very tasty!

Served this on Christmas Eve and my family loved it. They are typically very fussy and don't eat anything out of the norm so this is a real complement to the recipe. My daughter even wanted the recipe.

Absolutely wonderful, but BEWARE.....this soup is best served with beano, or provide everyone with a take home can of air freshener. I've served this recipe twice and everyone enjoyed it immensely, but they all had the same reaction a couple of hours later.

It was just fabulous and I will make it again and again and again.

I didn't do the cheese part, but the soup came out with rave reviews. A friend of mine who dislikes onions loved it when I made the soup sans onions (and added too much cream, heh). My only complaints are: 1> heavy cream... i'll try it with skim milk & see if it loses anything 2> I couldnt find fresh thyme, and with the dry thyme, it had a slightly off flavor to me. I'd like to experiment with other spices. But overall a VERY good dish.

This soup is delicious! And the restaurant is in Charleston, SC not NC.

I served this with a crusty sourdough bread. Much the same way the wedge of lemon complimented the rich, roasted flavor of the garlic, the sour flavor of the bread added an additional layer of flavor.

This soup sounds delicious. Does anyone have any tips for a vegetarian alternative to the chicken stock. I would love to try this recipe, I just need some suggestions as to what I might use in place of the chicken stock without diminishing the quality of the recipe. Thank you!

Excellent!!! I served it wuth a loaf of rye bread at the bottom of the soup plate covered with the parmesan cheese. If you wnat to do it faster, roast the garlic cloves in an electric oven being careful not to burn them. Finger-licking good!!

Make this recipe now!!!! I've made this soup at least four times and this soup is a must have. It is wonderful with a piece of crusty bread. The recipe doubles well too.

I made this soup as a starter for a dinner party. Every guest commented that the soup could have (and that the wished it was) the main course. Incredible soup. 2nd time making it, ommitted the cream and blended it longer to make it thicker...just great.

Absolutely YUM! I used low-fat milk in place of the whipping cream and it still turned out incredible. I didn't have fresh thyme so I used 2 teaspoons of homemade basil pesto instead, and it was incredible.

Do yourself a favor--make this soup! It's absolutely delicious and easy to make. I sampled it both before and after adding the cream; it's good before the cream, but great after. Definitely a keeper.

This soup was prepared a day ahead as part of a party/dinner I prepared and carted to Toronto as a thank you to a friend. It was a lot of work but worth the effort! I found it really took on the flavour of the chicken stock I used, so next time, I will increase the work load and make my own.

This delicious velvety soup was a breeze to make the day before and then reheat. I doubled the recipe for a dinner party and it still came out terrific. TIP: don't use the garlic you purchase already peeled...peeling your own truly makes a difference. Use toothpaste to get the odor off of your fingers.

This recipe was made for me so I don't have an appreciation of how much work it was, but the result was wonderful. I recommend it for guests.
