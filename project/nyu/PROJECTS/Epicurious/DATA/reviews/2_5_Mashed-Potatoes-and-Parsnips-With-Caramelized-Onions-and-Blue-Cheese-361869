Great! A very different spin on regular mashed potatoes. The onions and blue cheese are terrific additions. Followed the recipe. I think I'm going to make this for Thanksgiving.

I think you need to really like parsnips in order to like this recipe, and apparently I don't.

I think this dish could have done with more blue cheese. It's healthy, but I think some unhealthy changes (maybe a splash of cream, some salt, and definitely more cheese) would have made it tastier. Not bad, but not great.
