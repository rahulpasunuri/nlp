A delicately spiced caramel sauce that went beautifully with the pumpkin bread pudding. I let the spice mixture steep for over an hour and think it could benefit from more time. I also used Calvados; doubt it would make any real difference. Any apple brandy should do.

This sauce can be used on so much more than the pumpkin bread. The star anise gives it the best "OMG! What is that?" taste. You have to try it! I'll be making it a bunch. Would be great over apples, too. Thank you, Bobbie Flay!

I made this sauce to go with the bread pudding recipe. The sauce was good, but not outstanding. I think I would prefer the flavor of a standard caramel sauce to the apple-caramel, and I definitely prefer caramel made with butter. To be fair, I made a couple of small changes that could have affected the result; I used cider instead of juice and Calvados instead of schnapps (only because I had these ingredients on hand). If I try it again I'll probably add some butter and possibly kick up the anise a little.

It's obvious the people making comments do not cook. To not know the difference between 'applesauce' and 'apple sauce'? And to not know caramel is made from sugar and water, and sometimes with heavy cream added as in Bobby's recipe above? Honestly you should hold your negative reviews if you don't know what you're talking about. This is a fantastic recipe. You should actually make it and taste it before you comment.

This should be called 'Spicy Carmel-Apple Sauce.' I loathe when cooks rate recipes they haven't made!!!

To the previous comment: the caramel is made with the sugar, water, etc. That is what caramel is. And this is not a recipe for applesauce. It's a delicious recipe for an apple-flavored dessert sauce.

I have not made this yet either but plan to. Regarding the first reviewers comment, the sauce is not meant to be "applesauce". He is referring it as a "sauce". I admit it is confusing. :)
