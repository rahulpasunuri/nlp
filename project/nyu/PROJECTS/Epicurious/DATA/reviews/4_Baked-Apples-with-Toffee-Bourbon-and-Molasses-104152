disappointed with resutls. the whole thing might be better if you sliced the apples and mixed them with the toffee bits, bourbon, etc. Also, use the Heath toffee chips in baker's aisle (no chocolate on them). Better yet, don't waste your toffee chips on this recipe.

This is an amazingly delicious dessert. I used more of the SKOR candy than called for just because it is so good! My sauce didn't thicken up but it didn't matter...it was delicious anyway. I served to company who all raved about it and almost licked their bowls to get every last drop.

I have to say I'm not usually a huge baked apples fan, but this was fantastic. Extremely easy, but good in that you just put the stuff together and put it in the oven. I did not baste much during cooking, but lathered on extra sauce and let it sit about 10 - 15 min. at the end. This seemed to work fine for bringing goo back into the apples, and you don't have to be running to the oven all of the time.

There is something so wonderfully elegant and decadent about this dessert. It taps into all the best sense-triggers: it smells wonderful as it's baking, looks incredible, tastes amazing- you only ever hoped baked apples could be this good! Grown-up version of a classic.

This was excellent, everyone loved it. I substituted scotch whiskey for bourbon, and corn syrup for molasses. I also served it with a scoop of Haagen Dazs Bailey's ice cream. Boiling the juices at the end of the recipe was somewhat unnecessary, as it was rich enough without the thickened sauce.

Very good, but I would not use chocolate covered toffee like Skor or Heath. The chocolate make the reduction, which took at least 15 minutes, too strong and almost harsh. This one takes a long time. I used 1/2 the butter. Make it again, but probably with less Molasses too.

I made this a few years ago and lost the recipe. I finally found it again! This is one of my favorite recipes. It is really, really good! I serve it with high quality french vanilla ice cream which makes the taste even better. Best of all, it is simple to make! Impress your guests with this recipe

I made this for a dinner party and everyone raved. Take the direction "baste often" seriously, otherwise the apples get dried out. A little time consuming, but well worth it for a special occasion.
