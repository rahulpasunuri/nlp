I used the bones of this recipe to make a pumpkin leek soup with the following modifications: I only had one large leek, so I used that with the addition of 1/2 a large yellow onion. In place of the vermouth, I used Pino Grigio. I added three very small roasted red and yellow peppers when I added the wine. After deglazing, I added approx. a 1/2 C cooked red potatoes with the skins on, about a Tbsp. of agave for sweetness and 8 oz of canned, unseasoned pumpkin. I pureed the soup after it came to a boil and served it with a dollop of sour cream. This was very hearty and flavorful.

Yum! I made this a bit differently from the recipe - omitted the sugar, as other reviewers said it was too sweet. I added some onions with the leeks, and used veggie stock instead of chicken. I am impressed with how complex the flavors are, with so few ingredients! Thought I might have to add some other spices, but just wasn't necessary. Takes some time, but not a lot of work. The vermouth adds something really nice.

Oh my this soup was terrible. I followed it to a T, but it smelled like dish soap and was much too sweet. I am a leek lover and a soup lover, and make homemake soup frequently, so I know it wasn't me. I ended up cutting up a hot chicken sausage and throwing it into my bowl just for some decent flavor. I certainly won't be making this again. And I'm a bit upset that I couldn't rate this recipe 0 forks. Too bad.

A richly flavorful soup--delicious and dead easy. The key is the slow but complete caramelization of the leeks (till they are milk chocolate color) plus the concentration of flavor which happens when you completely deglaze the pan and simmer the vermouth and the first 1/2 cup of stock until they are fully evaporated. Don't shortcut these steps. That's where all the flavor is. Another key--the pan you use. You need a heavy pan like cast iron or enamel coated cast iron (like Le Crueset) which allow good caramelization. Suggest using the butter vs. olive oil suggested by others, as leeks and butter are key pairings from a flavor standpoint. I made recipe exactly as written, using the full time allotted for each step. It was fabulous!!

I followed the recipe exactly from start to finish. I was disappointed by how sweet the soup was, and I wasn't happy with the texture. I followed several other reviewers advice and pureed the mixture, then added mustard. It still wasn't meeting my expectations, so I added milk to increase the creaminess and downplay the heavy flavors of vermouth and mustard, then added pureed celery and zucchini to make the mixture creamier. I also added a ton of salt. In the end, I'm quite happy with my soup, but it's very far away from the original recipe.

I was disappointed in this recipe. Bland flavor despite the use of homemade chicken stock.

Great recipe, but using veg stock/broth left it tasting a wee bit flat. Adding a teaspoon or two of vinegar really livened things up, however.

I made this as directed and I found the taste to be just ok. Next, I tried to blend it to see if that would give it some zip and still just ok. My chicken broth is homemade therefore not nearly as salty as the store bought broth. I felt I needed to add quite a bit of salt to give it a kick. I have made better leek soup!

For the most part, I followed the recipe to a tee. This was extremely tasty and so easy to make. A keeper all the way! The one change was that I used cheese croutons as a substitute for the cheese toasts.

I have made this many, many times, excellent! Make sure the soup kettle you use has a lot of bottom surface area relative to the number of leeks or they steam rather than carmelize. I also add a TB of dijon with the vermouth and a pinch of nutmeg at the end. YUM...

This is my first attempt at leek soup. I followed other suggestions and used vegetable broth and white wine instead of vermouth and chicken broth. The result was tasty, but not outstanding. It was a lot of time for just okay results. I will try a different recipe next time. However, I'm not going answer the 'will you make this again' question since that may unfairly sway the general rating. I might make it, but might not either.

This soup was pretty good, tasted like french onion soup to me. I only did a quick swirl with the immersion blender and felt it could have used a bit more or maybe to be reduced a bit as it was kind of thin. I finished it off with some truffle salt which makes everything better.

This soup was the best! I'm always looking for new ideas for leeks. I have to agree that it definately doesn't make as much as one would guess so I would probably double the recipe next time. I also used white wine instead on vermouth and encountered no problems.

I made parmesan crisps to float in this soup - very tasty. The recipe is awesome and will become one of my winter favs to make in bulk and freeze. The only thing I did differently, is use olive oil instead of butter and vegetable stock instead of chicken. The only additional seasoning that I added was a few pinches of pepper. I can't wait to make this again!

An amazing recipe! So easy and satisfying. I was doing trial runs for Thanksgiving looking for something quick & light that could be prepared in advance. I used a half butter half olive oil combination (though will likely try all olive oil in the future as the end result is so flavorful) and homemade chicken stock (makes all the difference for soups, I find). I also blended with a hand blender at the end purely because I love using the darn thing! Will be using it at Thanksgiving and many more times in the future.

I made this soup substituting a dry white wine for the vermouth and vegetable broth for the chicken broth. I also blended about 1/3 of the coup to create a creamier broth. It was delicious this way!

if you're having trouble with caramelization of the leeks, resist the temptation to stir too much. The leeks need contact with the surface of the pot to caramelize. Stir no more frequently than every 5 minutes, and you should get a nice golden color. For the first 40 minutes, I only stirred every 10 minutes, and they browned beautifully. This also makes it a bit less work - you don't need to stand over it!

This soup is very delicious. The caramelized leek flavor is just wonderful. It took much longer for me to caramelize them, but I think it's because I didn't dry the leeks very well after rinsing so I had to burn off the water first. I had to substitute with some white wine and I also put the soup in a blender before serving. Didn't make as much as I would have liked, so I will double the recipe in the future. Yum!

This soup tastes surprisingly good considering that it is very easy to make. I serve this as a starter to Christmas Dinner as it is not heavy. My guests are always delighted. One note - I have to add an additional cup of broth for four servings.

I liked this soup VERY well even though I made a crazy substitution for the vermouth. I havent ever bought vermouth in my life, and I wasnt about to run out and get some, so I substituted 1/2 finely chopped apple(!). I realize this may have subverted the chef's original intent somewhat, and that substitution also might limit the value of this review, but it was still *very tasty*. I had no problem caramelizing the leeks - in fact there was a time when I feared they had caramelized too much. I also did not use an immersion blender. All in all it was a great way to use leeks and I will make it again. I might even follow the instructions next time. :D

I highly recommend making this soup, it takes some time to make but the reward is great. I suggest after the soup is finish put it into a blender on puree, this changes the consistency to a creamy soup. It's so good you would swear it has cream in it, but it doesn't...

Loved the leeks, loved the carmelization, loved the flavor. But the consistacy was not so great. I think I will take the advice of others and use a hand blender. A few swirls would certainly help. Fully blended might help dress it up and make it less rustic.

I was suprised that I did not like this recipe as much as I expected I would. I followed the directions exactly. Usually when recipes on epicurious get rave reviews, I tend to love them. Not this time. Maybe it would have been better had I used homemade stock. Or maybe I just don't love leeks as much as I thought I did. I would gladly eat this again if someone else made it. But for all the work, I am unlikely to make it again myself.

Superb. Made it with home made stock - big difference. Used white wine instead of vermouth. Did not blend as I was looking for a rustic dish. Next time will try to garnish with parmesan crisps (Gourmet July'01)

An enjoyable but understated soup. Followed a past reviewer's suggestion to blend the solids, and would second it. Serious immersion blending returned a velvety smooth texture. Plated and then doctored with a splash of heavy cream a dash of truffle oil. A nice addition. Could use a little more depth of flavor -- a homemade stock would solve this. Not sure what the previous reviewer was expecting, but this turned out essentially spot on to what I would expect from the ingredients/prep. Loved it!

I followed the recipe exactly and this soup turned out an appealing greenish color. I do not think my leeks ever turned a golden brown. This soup tasted just OK. I threw most of it out. For the time and money spent, I feel it was a waste.

I've made this several times as a first course for family and friends. Followed the recipe to a 'T' -- the only modification was pinch of white pepper at the finish rather than black pepper. A great first course. Worth the time it takes to carmelize the leeks.

"A dish beyond compare" is a tall order but as leek soups go I have yet to enjoy a better one. This is seriously good soup! I found this recipe after realizing I had bags of leeks in my fridge & no plans to use them. I did not, however, have vermouth. I used Calvados instead and the result was (fortunate for me) incredibly delicious. I'm planning to make this again next week. It was so rich and filling I will serve less and use a first course.

I cannot figure this out... I cooked and cooked and cooked those leeks (well over 90 minutes) and they never turned "deep golden". Why? I was using a Le Creuset soup pot (enameled cast iron), so perhaps the enamel somehow prevented caramelization vs. an exposed metal pot? In any case, this was a delicious soup even though my leeks remained light yellow tinged with green all the way to the end. I also used a couple pulses with an immersion blender which gave it a richer mouthfeel.

Well, it's been a couple of hours since I made this for the first time, and the house is still filled with the most wonderful aromas. The combination of flavours is really lovely. I served it as a starter, followed with just a small grilled sirloin steak and mixed greens in a mustard vinaigrette and it all made for an elegant dinner with a bit of a French spa feel to it. Offset of course by the fact that we were watching The Incredibles.

This one was a wowser! I did a couple of smaaaaaaal alterations. I took the advice of another chef to gently hand blend the final product for a dash more thickness. Grating some gruyere over the middle of my bowl added some zing. The true POW was adding a touch of white truffle oil prior to plating. So good!

Patient, slow caramelization of the leeks is what makes this soup. Make sure you take the time to do this. The vermouth adds just the right layer of flavour to the dish. For such a simple soup you must use an excellent broth. This is one of the times when using a homemade chicken broth will make a real difference. I prepped the leeks a couple of days in advance and chilled them. Then minutes before I served the soup, I heated the broth to a bare simmer, added the leeks and let them heat through - for no more than 5 minutes. I served the soup with store bought (President's Choice) gruyere cheese sticks. A flavourful, elegant soup!

Rating: 4
Make sure you serve this with the raclette toast. I know raclette is a pain to find, so use gruyere. Also, any premium mustard, dijon or whole seed, is fine. This dish is basically a take on traditional french onion soup. The mustard and the cheese create the needed counterpoint to the leek and vermouth sweetness. Don't worry if you don't have vermouth. Any sweet fortified wine works well, madiera, marsala, sherry. If you have dry vermouth, use a touch of sugar to get the desired result. Use your own homemade vegetable stock instead of chicken. Veg stock is more dynamic than chicken and why go out of your way to make a wonderful veggie dish with meat? Plus veg stock takes a hour to make versus chicken stock with is a 5 hour deal. This soup, like most soups, gets better with age. I would make it a few days ahead and reheat. Serve with a crisp, citrus white wine, nothing with too much floral or grassy overtones. I like a nice Rhone Valley Grenache blanc-Clairette. Fruity and clean, and less than $8 a bottle.

My guests really enjoyed the soup. It is reminds me of french onion a little. I cooked it it to low and the carmelizing to a long time. Would make again and maybe serve with cheese on top! My sister makes this as a regular for her kids.

While I liked this and think it is a good recipe, I wouldn't make it again. This soup is really meant to be a first course, and I think would work well when followed by other flavors and textures. We ate it alone for dinner, and found it too one-dimensional to be satisfying on its own.

I served this soup with Danish blue cheese and lightly crisped fresh French bread - just fabulous. I put bits of the cheese into the soup and it brought out a very savoury flavour that I loved.
