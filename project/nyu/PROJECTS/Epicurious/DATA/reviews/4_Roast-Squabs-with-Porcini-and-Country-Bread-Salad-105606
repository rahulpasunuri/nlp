Can anyone suggest a place to purchase Squab???This definately looks like a recipe worth trying.

This is a repeat because it looks like my earlier comment hit an error, if it's duplicated, I apologize. I repeated this recipe more quickly than expected because my family loved it so much. The first time I used actual Cepes. They weren't available this time, so I used a variety of wild mushrooms from a farmer's market. They were great and better using 2x the amount called for in the recipe. I also added a diced onion to the fat just after the pigeon was thoroughly browned. After 2-3 minutes, I added some of the mushrooms, keeping the onion to one side of the pan until transulent. It took three groups of mushrooms to finish, and the juice from the mushrooms meant that I didn't need to add duck fat after the first 1.5 TBS. I then mixed the cooked onion and mushrooms and stuffed some of it into the bird cavities with more thyme (still on the stems) than the recipe calls for. It isn't necessary to make the garlic confit puree (the first time I just used crushed garlic), but if you have the time, the full cloves of garlic are nice in the bread salad. It is important to cut the crust off the sourdough, or else the hard crust pieces overpower the salad. The pigeon does have a strong flavor, but I think it's much more interesting than game hen, which is almost as commercial as chicken. When eating, it is easiest to first remove the legs and wings at the joints (important to give permission to use fingers), then cut down from the top of each breast to remove the meat. I provided a warm towel to clean fingers. The kids loved the dish and the "tom jones" effort.

Fabulous recipe. Enormous hit and am already planning to do it again.

Re the question of this recipe working with Cornish Hen. The garlic confit puree would over power the delicate flavor of the hen. Squab is a stronger, gamier bird (can anyone say "pidgeon"?), and can stand up against more intense seasoning. I just had squab at the Gotham Bar and Grill in the NYC last week, it is a delightful bird!

I just have a question: Can this be done in a clay pot, in the oven? By the way, I'm also gonna try it with cornish hen.

Has anyone tried this with rock cornish hen? Seems that would work as well

You can get duck fat from your butcher. Any butcher that sells duck breasts or cut up duck will have plenty of fat left over. I have made several cassoulets over the years and this is how I get duck fat. This recipe only calls for 1/4 cup plus 2 T. One duck has much more fat on it than that. Any butcher will be willing to part with a little duck fat!!

You can't deny it's a bit tricky - but I can't deny that it's no doubt more than worth the effort invested :-) If only one had the time...

Just a crazy question, but where does one find/buy a cup of duck fat? Any help would be greatly appreciated!
