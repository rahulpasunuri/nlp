Fantastic. Recently in Tuscany we purchased dried Fennel flowers that we were told were great on fish. So I used the flowers, reduced the smoked paprika, and forgot the sugar. Taste was exceptional. I plan to make up a mix to use a stocking presents for our family cooks at xmas.

Couldn't be any easier for such an amazing taste from the rub. I will make this again exactly as it is written. I happen to not have any brown sugar and had to subsitute regular sugar using a lesser amount. Since I was losing the depth of the brown sugar I decided to dizzle honey over the salmon which gave it a nice char. Got lucky there! I definitely want to use brown sugar next time. I served this with one of my favorite rice dishes from Epicurioud; Jasmine Rice with Garlic, Ginger, and Cilantro and Green beans and carrots.

I made this recipe in a grill pan on the stovetop. I brushed the pan liberally with olive oil and followed the cooking instructions as per grilling. I did add a splash or two of white wine (vino verde) to keep the fish from sticking or drying out. When it was almost done, I let it rest after removing from the pan, before serving at room temperature. A delicious summer main dish. I foresee this becoming a staple recipe in my kitchen.

Exceptional. I used a salmon steak cut and grilled it on the Foreman grill and it came out great.

I make this rub over and over again. It makes your salmon a show stopper.

I did everything as called for in the recipe. I crushed the fennel seed in my spice grinder. I got perfect grill marks on the perfectly done salmon. I even used the cookie sheet technique and did not break any of the fish. My wife TOTALLY HATED the taste of the rub. Personally, I thought it was pretty good, but we will not be making this again. Ouch! So tomorrow for lunch I am going to have a beautiful Fennel and Dill rubbed grilled salmon sandwich on slightly toasted whole grain bread, with a hint of tartar... Yum, Kevin

I made this rub with fresh dill and a bit less sugar and smoked paprika than the recipe called for. I was concerned, based on some of the previous comments, that the paprika would overwhelm the flavor of the expensive wild salmon. I also didn't feel that I wanted a super sweet rub. My guests loved it. Based on the reduced proportions, I think I got it just about right with the wild salmon. But here's my gripe with the recipe: Calling specifically for wild salmon is just a conceit. This robust rub would work better at full strength on farmed salmon steaks - and cost 1/3 to 1/2 the price of the wild salmon called for in the recipe.

Very good. Had a ton of rub left over, so we can have this again and again.

Pretty good but not spectacular. The blend is fine and the sugar caramelizes nicely. I liked the zip the paprika added but my hubby thought it was too sweet, but he's a traditionalist and prefers dill and lemon on salmon.

I admit that after reading the recipe and a few of the previous cooks' reviews that I was prepared to cut the called for amount of brown sugar in half. But I always try to follow a recipe fully before I go and fool around with it. I'm glad I stuck to that personal guideline. This rub was really delicious as is. The sugar was my last addition to the rub and looking at the quantity of the rest of the combined spices led me to conclude that the 1/4C and 2 teaspoons of golden brown sugar would not be out of line. The sugar caramelized so nicely on the salmon and helped bind the other spices to the side of salmon. Really quite beautiful. I was testing the recipe, so there were only three of us eating it, but it fit our tastes. The only direction I question is cooking the salmon for 8 mintues per side. Even on medium heat that just seems too long, but you can adjust that to your own experiences with your own grill. Enjoy

This was delicious and so quick to prepare and cook! Use sea salt rather than kosher to prevent too much moisture from being drawn out of the fish, and if you are like me and prefer savoury over sweet, cut the amount of brown sugar in half. Other than that, so fresh, so simple!

Basically an excellent salmon recipe. We tend to not like our savories at sweet as this so I will cut the brown sugar in half next time. We have a dinner group with 12 members and this is the only dish every single person at the table has ever taken seconds of.

Just about anyone I serve this salmon to says it's the best salmon they've ever had. Even kids who normally balk at eating fish love this dish!

My wife brought three margarita-laced girlfriends for dinner last night, and they all thought it was delicious. The rub also works well when salmon is baked, if grilling season is over.

I also agree with the "cook from Dayton OH" about crushing the fennel and black pepper. Also, when using smaller filets, you don't need the rimless baking sheets to turn the salmon, just an elongated turner, or spatula.

This was the best salmon I ever had in my entire life. I bought 1 lb. of wild copper river king salmon (for a mint, though it was worth every penny). I think the cooking time varies from how thick your filet is. I was worried that 8 minutes was too long, but my filet was a good 1.5 inches thick in the center and I turned it a litte too soon. It still turned out fine, I just had to cook it a little longer skin side down. It was magically delicious. We paired it with a pinot noir, which really made the spices burst with flavor. No restaraunt I've been in has served better, including Salty's. I served this with the rice pilaf with pistachios and golden raisens and grilled asparagus. It was spectacular.

Now, this is a ridiculous flavour combination! The "pimenton" overwhelms the delicate flavor of salmon and gives it the taste of chorizo. Fennel and dill (even though I sprinkled fresh dill on the done salmon) totally get lost. If you insist on that weird combination of seasonings, cut off (I did) the cooking time to 5 minutes per side, unless you like dry fish. A real dud !

This rub is just right -- all of that fennel keeps the brown sugar from making the rub gummy, and it forms a nice crust on the fish so that it doesn't stick to the grill. I used smaller filets, and cut the grilling time down to 4 minutes on the skinless side, 6 minutes on the skin side, and let them sit a couple of minutes after grilling to finish cooking. Also, if you have the time, use a mortar & pestle to grind the fennel and and peppercorns -- the flavors are more complex that way, and the rub gets a more rustic texture.

A truly tasty rub, and easy to make! I couldn't find smoked paprika so I had to sub sweet paprika with about a 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper. The rub was great on wild-caught salmon, and tasted great on a salad the next day.

Made this for my gourmet book club, used a 3 lb. side of wild king salmon for 6 of us, so I have some rub left over, and there was leftover salmon, great the next day. We had a liver paté appetizer and wine as we sat and watched (and smelled) the salmon grill. Spectacular and easy. MUST use Spanish smoked paprika, which is also wonderful on other things.

Yum, yum, yum, this is some dang delicious rub! I couldn't find the spanish smoked paprika anywhere in town, so I substituted it with paprika and cayenne red pepper and dry roasted it for about 2 minutes to bring up the flavor. It was delicious, and I don't know if it would have been any better with the smoked paprika.

We do salmon frequently and always on the lookout for good, new recipes. This was HUGELY successful for an outdoor dinner party with some very picky guests. I used regular paprika, and a bit less than the recipe called for, but otherwise stuck to the plan exactly. It was extraordinarily good, very easy to prepare and grilled very well.

I did not like the fennel/sugar/ paprika with the salmon. a creamy dill is much better. I used the remaining seasoning on pork and it was better--but still have had more agreeable combinations.

This was wonderful. The rub was just perfect to enhance the flavor of the salmon. I made the entire batch but only cooked two small salmon steaks so jarred up the rest for later. I did not have smoked Spanish paprika, so subbed plain paprika with a 1/4 tsp of chipotle pepper powder. The next day I was able to locate some "Pimento" locally and can definitely see how it would be even better with the correct paprika. I served this with rice noodles with cilantro and a cucumber rice wine vinegar simple chopped salad. It was a great meal.

This is a very easy and delicious recipe. I made several alterations, based on what I had in the house. I used skin-on filets of salmon, not the special cut, and reduced the cooking time a bit. I substituted Hungarian sweet paprika, but reduced the amount by half; used fleur de sel instead of kosher salt; and used fresh chopped dill (2 tbls. fresh, instead of 2 tsp. dried). The results were great. I will try it next time with dried dill, but needed to use up some fresh dill before it turned into brown slime in the produce drawer.

This was very good and, yes, sweet smoked Spanish paprika is essential. But I found that the complicated procedure with two baking sheets was totally unnecessry for a one-lb salmon filet. The grill was well oiled and flipping it with a long spatula was easy. I did find that cooking it eight-minutes/side was just a bit too long. Maybe it's because of our taste for sushi, but we like our fish a bit firmer than this came out. Next time I'll cook it for 5-6 minutes/side and see how it goes.

Could not find Spanish smoked paprika so I used the "generic" kind from the supermarket -- it was fantastic.

We're big fans of Douglas' "Rub with Love" - this is quite different! His commercial product is much sweeter and the fennel is much less prominent!

Full of flouvor and easy, I just didn't grill it that long (ab. 12 min was enough). Definitely will make it again, even for a party dinner.

Wonderful. Hint: the ingredients are virtually the same as Tom's commercial salmon rub. Those of you who can't find smoked Spanish paprika might have an easier time finding Tom's "Rub with Love" Salmon Spice Rub.

This is a great preparation for salmon.

I only had Hungarian paprika, so I substituted that for the Spanish paprika and it completely overpowered the other herbs and spices in the rub. We could not taste the fennel or the dill. Perhaps I'll try reworking the rub so that the fennel and dill stand out.
