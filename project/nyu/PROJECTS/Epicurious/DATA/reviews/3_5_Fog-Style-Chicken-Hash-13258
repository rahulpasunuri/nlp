I poached the chicken, then used the broth, plus water, in the same pan to parboil the potatoes. Drained potatoes, sauteed garlic in the same pot (again), added spices as directed, and potatoes. Cooked till golden, added cubed chicken and 1/2 & 1/2, and cooked till slightly thickened. My family gobbled this up.

I made this last night and it is really good! For the poaching liquid I used 2cps chicken stock 1 cp white wine and 1 cp water and following the advice of another reviewer, I used the same broth to cook the potatoes after the chicken was done. I also browned the potatoes over high heat with a little olive oil before I sauteed the onions. We like our food well seasoned so I did add extra salt and herbs and a pinch of cayenne. I almost left out the half and half but I'm glad I didn't. It really added a wonderful texture to the dish. We will make this again and again!

This is a great recipe for leftover chicken; it has become a mainstay in our house. It's even better the next day! And yes, there's plenty of room for improvisation. I'll admit I do like the half and half, but I also like the idea of browning the potatoes first.

By the time you're done chopping here you may be ready for retirement, but I liked this dish. I didn't add milk; it seemed moist enough for my taste. I thought the amount of spice the recipe calls for is fine. So, you're chopping away and just when you think you're done, you look again at the recipe and you're thinking, "I still have more to chop?" You're tempted to skip something, take a shortcut somehow, but you don't. Like all good cooks you've committed. It's worth the task, but it won't be a short relationship.

I think this recipe might possibly be improved by tossing the potatoes in with the onions etc, so they could get a little crispy before adding the half&half. As it was, the potatoes just soaked up the half and half and the whole thing had a rather sticky consistency. Nice flavors but the texture was all wrong. Only change I made was not using bell peppers, as they are The Devil's Vegetable. Oh and using leftover chicken, which is the whole purpose of hash, AFAIK.

This was a great recipe to use up random vegetables I found in my fridge. It was particularly good late night eating. I diced 4 bacon slices, and cooked those first, then sauteed the bell peppers and onion in the rendered fat. I also boiled my potatoes in the chicken poaching liquid (after removing the chicken), to cut down on the number of pans. Did not find this labor-intensive at all, just some chopping. I also doubled the amount of spices, per previous reviews, since we like our food spicy and well-seasoned.

Oh Lord, what WASN'T in this. It was wonderful, but it took a lot of labor to make. I hope everyong enjoys this because it it work the effort. Bertha Blevens, Chicago, Il.

LOVED THIS WITHOUT CREAM. VERY HEALTHY AND NO NEED FOR TASTE ENHANCEMENT.

This was a great recipe. I think I liked the hash better than the roast chicken from which came the leftovers for it. I used about a tablespoon of Louisiana hot sauce and it was a wonderful addition to an already tasty dish.

Labor intensive? Not really, especially if you use left-over chicken. I suspect I'll always use this for left-over chicken. I added a splash of Mexican chili sauce (like Tabasco). It makes a good filling for corn masa snacks, like sopes, or tamales. But, use Mexican chiles, instead of bell peppers. I can think of lots of ways to mutate this basically excellent recipe.

A great way to use leftover chicken! Actually, a great way to use almost any leftover. Like one other reviewer, I prepped all vegetables night before. This made dinner the next night a snap. I didn't all the cream or egg. I upped the spices. Great with a salad.

I did plenty of improvising, my boyfriend and I loved this. I decided to make this because I knew I had "most" of the ingredients already. I boiled the chicken and shredded it. I sauteed the red bell pepper and onion, threw in some mushrooms, garlic and tomato. I then added the boiled chicken. I was out of red potatoes, so I substituted mashed up tater tots, which I love!! I then whisked a few eggs with the chili powder, salt & pepper & threw it all together! Very good!! I suppose it could be an entirely diffent recipe!!

Excellent flavor! Lots of room for improvising. Both my husband and son loved it. I made it a second time using leftover Thanksgiving turkey!

This was our first attempt at an epicurious.com recipe, and frankly, we were not impressed. We were prepared to increase the spices based on a previous review--we like spicy!--but even doubling them wasn't sufficient for our tastes. Overall, we found it to be a preparation intensive recipe, followed by little satisfaction with the outcome...Sorry.

This was a lot of work for a mediocre return. I was bored eating it and spent the meal wondering what I could do next time to make it better instead of enjoying the fruits of my labor.

THANKS TO ALL PREVIOUS REVIEWERS. THIS HASH WAS EXCELLENT AND I WILL DEFINITELY MAKE IT AGAIN. WE DID DOUBLE THE SPICES, BUT WE LIKE A LOT OF SPICE, AND WERE VERY HAPPY WITH IT.

This is a wonderful dish. I sprinkled parmesan cheese on top, which added a little something...

I made this for a Mother's Day brunch, and it was a huge hit. I did all the work the day before - boiled the potatoes, measured the spices, chopped the onions and peppers - and just threw it together the morning of the brunch. I can tell that this will be a standard brunch dish - my husband requests it every weekend!

My family loved this dish. I used diced cooked leftover en instead of cooking the en from scratch. The atoes reheated wonderfully the next day as well.

I served this dish to my family and it was enjoyed by all. It would make a very good brunch. Very tasty. It does take considerable preparation time so it would be helpful to have the ingredients available the day before.
