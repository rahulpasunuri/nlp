For the simplicity and delight of this recipe, I gave it four forks. Not complicated, but a great summer dinner. I would add more onions next time, as they are wonderful grilled. Also added tomatoes to beans...that's a must!!

Agree with comments about less salt and I like salt. Also I add about 50% more zucchini; adds good texture and flavor. Made this many times and it's an excellent one dish meal.

Excellent...don't bother with the scallions. Simply not necessary. Otherwise, wonderful...add some chopped summer ripened tomatoes to the beans, if on hand. This is a quick impressive meal.

Terrific. I omitted the beans and limited the salt to 1/2 tsp. (even that could be decreased), and I brushed the zucchini and scallions with some chili oil. But the dressing was wonderful; it and the cumin rub on the scallops were wonderful. Shrimp, any firm white fish, maybe chicken would also work with this recipe. A definite keeper, and great way to use zucchini.

Good easy summer recipe. I used butter beans which added a nice consistency and also added garlic to the bean mix. Probably could have even used more garlic, ginger might be nice with the coriander. No need to par boil the scallions, just brush with olive oil and salt/pepper then straight to the grill.

We absolutely loved this dish. Added two roma tomatoes to the beans as mentioned by a Cook from NH. Used a lot of cilantro as well. Couldn't get large scallops but small worked just fine. Used extra cumin to coat and were delicious. Served with basmati rice/peas. Great meal.

light and healthy but very satisfying. the grilled scallions are a special treat. i grilled a nectarine beside the zucchini and served it on the side. couldn't find small white beans so i used cannellini, which were fine. a simple, yummy warm weather supper.

My husband really liked this dish. I did as well. We cut the salt as advised by other reviewers. We included shrimp and added seasoning to the zucchini. I loved the cumin on the scallops with the beans. The scallions did not add much in my opinion.

I sauteed the zucchini and then the scallops on top of the stove and it couldn't have been better. This is a true winner. I cut down a bit on the cumin as I don't like a too hot flavor, but it suited both of us (my husband does like hot!!) It is also a very easy recipe. I used fewer scallops for the two of us, but did not cut down on the rest of the ingredients. I would recommend doubling beans and squash for four unless you are having several other courses.

This recipe makes an impressive presentation. I agree that the dressing for the beans could use something, but the flavors in the rub compensate. I served for a dinner party, and everyone really liked it.

A lot of different flavors at work here, and it was interesting. We used some Chinese Eggplant along with the Zucchini. Cut down the salt. It was interesting how the beans served in place of pasta or rice, and the contrast of flavors between the scallops and beans was wonderful. All in all, the flavors did not make a whole, but it was interesting in its California style.

Based on previous comments I reduced the salt. We don't care for cilantro so I substituted parsley, which was good. I think the bean mixture is a little bland, I added some garlic and this improved it. Enjoyed the cumin mixture and will try it on chicken.

I only used 1/2 tsp. salt and added the tomatoes to the beans as recommended by Anne Henrich. I also added some coriander in with the cumin and salt mixture. To make things more interesting, I brushed the vegies and scallops with hot chili pepper oil and served Hot Mango Chutney as a condiment. Quick and easy prep. Terrific flavor. I'll definitely make this again.

We've made this twice, and both times made more of the zucchini and scallions. They were both terrific. I agree with the previous reviewer -- reduce the amount of salt in the cumin rub. The beans were great -- we added some diced roma tomato to add color and interest and found it even better. Made this twice; will likely make it again.

Although this recipe was easy to prepare we did not find it particulary interesting. The beans with cilantro were good, the scallops were too salty. If I make it again I would reduce the amount of salt to < 1 tsp and I would omit parboiling the scallions.
