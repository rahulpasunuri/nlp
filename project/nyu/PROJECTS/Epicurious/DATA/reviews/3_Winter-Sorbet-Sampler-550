made the cranberry and pear sorbet for a light, dairy free finish and to our Christmas dinner.....wow! what a hit. The only problem I encountered was the consistency of the pear sorbet. It was more like a granita and the cranberry was smooth and just what I wanted. Now, in the process of making the grapefruit for New Years dinner(disappointed there were no fresh cranberries left at the store) and so I will review that later

I've only made the Pear Sorbet. I loved it, but I did make some changes. Per some research on David Lebovitz's site, I omitted the corn syrup and increased the sugar by roughly 25%. Also, as another reviewer noted, the recipe requires more wine than otherwise noted (roughly an entire bottle). Additionally, I cooked the pears down in the wine until they were falling apart. Then, I added the sugar to the hot solution and allowed it dissolve before adding it to the food processor. The flavor is fantastic! However, I did not give it 4 stars because of the changes necessary to make it a successful recipe.

I can understand the frustration of some of the other reviewers with the texture of the sorbets. But, in the recipe's defense, it just takes a little patience. I'm not a big fan of grapefruit, so I excluded that one, but the other two were done with out modification, except substituting strawberries for the cranberries as we had no cranberries on hand...lol... Both were very tasty. In order to have the correct texture, it needs to be frozen in a container for a few hours. Neither were icy, and both the flavors were outstanding. Both are good with substituting splenda for sugar (without cooking the splenda with the fruit) which is what we did the 2nd time... Give it another try...

OK - I'll say I did something wrong - though I don't know what. I made the pear sorbet. The taste was fine - it had the texture of applesauce. I read the other reviewers - I do not want to add or subtract ingredients in order to get the desired results. I will not attempt it again.

Made the pear and grapefruit sorbets for a dinner for 12 over the weekend. For the grapefruit sorbet, skipped the rinds (as I don't like the taste) and instead used half pomelo juice, pieces of pomelo, and have Ruby Red grapefruit juice from the grocery store. The pieces of pomelo in the sorbet was yummy and less bitter than the rind or grapefruit pulp. Both turned out fantastic and were the highlight of the meal.

I made all 3 sorbets, but with a few changes. First I made a batch of the grapefruit sorbet exactly as written (except I used Odwalla 100% pink grapefruit juice). I loved the sweet-tartness of the sorbet, but the texture a little icy and not as "fluffy" as I wanted, so I made another batch using 2 egg whites (a variation I'd read about in "The Ultimate Ice Cream Book"). I tempered the lightly-whisked egg whites with the hot sugar syrup to avoid any uncooked egg worries. This batch had a much "fluffier" texture and didn't have the aftertaste of the first batch. I made the cranberry and pear sorbets with the same method. I think they may have been "overfluffed"; next time I would try those as written (and maybe again with just 1 tempered egg white). The flavor of all three sorbets was so fantastic & refreshing! I used Trader Joe's Port (ruby, I think) in the cranberry sorbet and ripe Bartletts for the pear sorbet. They make a gorgeous trio in a small dish, and a lovely light way to end a meal!

I made only the cranberry sorbet and, with a few minor changes, it was wonderful!!! I used the cabernet sauvignon instead of the port, and added the grated rind of 1 lemon and half of an orange. I doubled the recipe, pureed it in my blender, and put it in my sorbet maker for 30 min., then froze it for 4 hours. Turned out perfectly and my guests at my Christmas dinner raved over it.

Only made the cranberry, but it reminded me too much of relish! I might make it again, but not without a lot of alterations--it was just too blah. Maybe some ginger? Or lemon or orange rind....something is needed to make the flavors come alive!

Made the pear sorbet as a intermezzo for a 500 person Gala. Worked out wonderful. I used a lot more Reisling than called for. It did not effect the freezing process.

I only made the pink-grapefruit sorbet - it was delicious and refreshing, especially after a 90-degree day here in the city! I didn't have grenadine on hand, so I substituted 1 T light corn syrup with a drop of red food coloring - was fine. Make sure not to use more than 1-1/4 wine total, as mine didn't boil down all the way to 1/4 cup, and so the finished sorbet was a tiny bit runny. Still really good.

I only made the cranberry sorbet. I made two batches, one following the recipe, and one with cabernet sauvignon instead of port. The cabernet was much richer in flavor and color.
