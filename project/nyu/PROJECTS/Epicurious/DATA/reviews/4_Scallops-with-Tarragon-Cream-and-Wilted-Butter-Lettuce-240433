This is delicious when made exactly as written, with Pernod and fresh tarragon. I can't imagine adding pasta or rice. It would definitely dilute the intensity of this rich creamy sauce. For those who thought it was ho-hum, that may be the problem. Try it again as written.

Excellent recipe. Got rave reviews at our dinner party. It's the perfect spring time recipe, particularly if you are a fan of anise/tarrgon flavors. My only adaptation was to make the sauce after cooking the scallops in the same pan. After removing the scallops to the side to keep warm I quickly added the shallots, sautéed them for 3-4 minutes and the deglazed with the wine (I always use vermouth, keeps longer, doesn't waste good drinking wine) and pernod, and wilted the lettuce in that. Then I removed the lettuce to the plates, quickly added the cream and cooked it down. I think it gave the sauce a bit more flavor to use the Pam drippings. I also used Bibb lettuce, since that is what I could find, and it was great. Don't overtook the lettuce- a few seconds is all you need. I also lightly dusted the scallops with flour. I disagree about the quantity of shallots, but I'm a fan, so...great recipe. Will make again and again. It's a keeper as my husband says.

I made this recipe with jasmine rice for when my sister's family came to visit. They all loved it! They couldn't get over the smell and the textures--even overheard them praising the meal before I had finished cooking it. However, my own tastes could not share their enthusiasm. I thought the wilted lettuce tasted too much of the butter-scallop drippings, and the Tarragon cream didn't do it for me, either. Frankly, I was a little disappointed considering all the praise this recipe has received. My rating reflects my entire party's feelings for the dish. Unless it is requested, I will not be making this recipe again.

This recipe is incredible, and surprisingly simple. I skipped the Pernod, but followed the rest of the recipe as written and served with a tomato fennel risotto. Scallops cooked perfectly in just a little butter, and the sauce was absolutely divine.

Exquisite. I owned a restaurant and I can tell I would have put this on the menu and charged $$$ for this . KISS is the secret to this recipe. Very simple and easy to multiply for number in your party. Presents well with wonderful flavors. I used spinach instead of butter lettuce.

This is easy, elegant and refined. I agree with one reviewer that 1/4 c shallots is overkill. I wanted a more refined presentation, so I strained the sauce in the French cap and then added the tarragon. I also deglazed the scallop pan with more Pernod before wilting the lettuce to match the flavor of the sauce. I served this with gingered pureed carrots (made with a bit of cream, butter, honey, ginger, cayenne and salt) which served as a nice bed for the scallops and lettuce and a colorful presentation element. The flavors were sublime. We drank the rest of the white wine with the meal. Fantastic!

This was just ok in my opinion. First of all, a 1/4 cup of minced shallots was way too much. Secondly, if you are going to follow the advice (or tip) to serve it with angel hair, you best make at least twice the amount of sauce. Regardless, with or without the pasta I found this dish a bit bland, as did my husband.

Don't use dry tarragon...it tastes oddly bitter (the trader joe's brand). I'm going to have to try this again w/ fresh tarragon since so many other people like it...

I love this recipe! I made the cream sauce a second time and put it over Skate.

This is was positively divine and so quick and easy to make. I didn't use the pernod and it was fine. Will definitely make this again.

I made it without Pernod, but would like to try it next time. Also would like to put on top of angel hair pasta.

This was delicious. I would make it again but likely with more Pernod. I think this would earn exceptional 4-star status if made with sauteed lobster.

Absolutely delicious!! Excellent as a pasta dish as well (I recommend angel hair or any long, thin pasta).

Served this as a starter (cut back on the number of scallops). A very showy way to get a dinner started. The wilted lettuce is a cool idea - it really worked well in this dish.

This was fantastic. Highly recommend for a small dinner party. Did not use the Pernod and was still good. Very easy to make. Rave reviews from my guests!!!

Very easy and tasty. I didn't have any pernod however, which I'm sure would really boost the flavor (you know what it does for traditional escargot) The wilted lettuce was delicious. Next time I would make a large mound of the lettuce. Even my husband, who doesn't get the concept of wilted lettuce, loved it!

Fantastic. I followed the recipe except I left out the lettuce. Instead, I served the dish over rice. Next time, I'll double the sauce and serve with pasta.
