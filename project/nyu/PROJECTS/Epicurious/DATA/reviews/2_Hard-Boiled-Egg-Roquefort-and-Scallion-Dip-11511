Rocquefort is not one of my favourite cheeses but this recipe works well with either Stilton or Danish Blue. A good basic recipe that can be tailored to your preference in cheeses.

I didn't make this appetizer so will not rate it, but wanted to thank those who went before me, because now I will not make this recipe for my Halloween party tomorrow night. I like this system.

Sounds strange but I looked for this recipe because I bought a hard boiled egg cooked for the microwave. It came without instructions and I don't want to spend time cleaning out the microwave. How long do I put it in the microwave, do I poke holes in it? I want this to be a fast procedure that's why I want to do the microwave. Not 20 minutes boing eggs. Thanks Renee McCann ring @knownet.net

We tried it one night and we loved it. Consistency is odd - but if you like Roquefort, I'd try it. You never know.

This is just awful. I didn't know which was worse, the overwhelming aftertaste of eggs or how this concoction sucked all the moisture out of my mouth. The consistency was granular. I don't recommend this recipe at all.
