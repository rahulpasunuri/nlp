This basically starts as really delicious chicken stew. Although I did make it with the excellent empanada dough recipe (recommended by other reviewers), and made 4" individual empanadas, personally I think the filling itself is delicious and doesn't need the extra carbs and fat that the pastry brings (though I LOVE pastry). You can simply follow the instructions for the filling and, instead of taking the chicken off the bone and chopping it, serve the whole legs or thighs (I used thighs) with the chorizo/onion/olive sauce spooned over/around it. The flavors are lovely and nicely balanced. I agree with the other reviewers--use plenty of olives and currants/raisins. Simple canned pitted green olives, not the various fancy stuffed or cocktail olives. I also added pine nuts on a whim--perfect!

Oops, I forgot to say that I cut the dough into 4" rounds to make appetizer size half moons.

so so good! i used the empanada dough from this website, and doubled the amount of olives and currants (which i used instead of raisins). I felt they turned out a little dry...but my filling didn't really have a sauce at all...maybe I cooked it to long? Anyone have ideas for a dipping sauce? This was a test run for a party this weekend, and this recipe definately makes the cut!

I made these with empanada dough. They were very good but alot of work...I tested these with my family for a dinner party but then ended up buying empanadas for the party.

I enjoyed these. I eschewed the pizza dough in favor of the empanada dough recipe on this site, although that may have been a mistake - I got more compliments on the flaky, delicious dough I made than the filling itself! I used an already-cooked roast chicken that I was trying to figure out something to do with, and currants instead of raisins. Worked well on both counts, and the roast chicken saved time. I would suggest adding extra currants/raisins and extra olives. The filling needed quite a bit of salt, I found. The leftover filling was tastier the next day; maybe better to let the filling sit a day before making the empanada.

The filling for these empanadas is absolutely delicious. However, I had a big problem with excess liquid, and I would have had to cook the stuff down to a pulp to get it dry enough, but since I did accidentally put a little more broth than was called for, I would recommend being exact, or erring on the side of less liquid. Also, I'm sure the whole chicken legs added tons of flavor, but it was so time consuming and fiddly that I think you could do it with boneless, skinless thighs and things would be plenty tasty. You want to start this recipe with plenty of time ahead. Another thing: I used pre-packaged refrigerated biscuit dough instead of pizza dough (courtesy of another reviewer) and I think that was probably tastier. Empanada dough is like pastry more than bread, so biscuits seem closer. I just rolled them thin and folded them around the filling--they cooked much faster and I didn't do the olive oil. But this filling is so tasty, it truly deserves some homemade Empanada dough, so when I defrost the leftover filling, I will make my own dough. Delicious, highly recommended--maybe toss in a few more olives and raisins for more piquant flavor.

The filling has really, really good flavor. It honestly knocks the pants off the beef empanadas recipe (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/fo od/views/Beef-Empanadas-239955), no disrespect intended. I used dried currants instead of raisins, which I recommend. They are smaller and therefore blend better with the other flavors. Be generous with the olives and currants! I also used individually-sized Goya brand frozen empanada wrappers and fried rather than baked them. I tried baking them and they came out dry and brittle, though perhaps with a superior [ie: homemade] dough this wouldn't be a problem. I made these for a party so I figured some deep-fried guilt could be safely spread across many individuals.

You can put anything in empanadas and this is more of a Mexican flavor than traditional South American which resemble Picadillo. For the crust: I highly recommend the empanada dough on this site as do many others. It's authentic and has a wonderful taste. My husband and kids loved it. Or for a good counterfeit, get Pillsbury's Grand "Buttermilk" biscuits. My Chilean mother-in-law told me about them probably because she knows I don't like to bake. They are richer than the dough from scratch, easier to work with and so much faster. But not recommended for the purist. It is fun to use 3 inch cut outs for appetizers. These can be frozen easily in zip locks and reheated in the oven at 350 degrees for 15 minutes. Don't reheat in the microwave.

LOVED THIS!..... I used Linguica instead of the chorzo worked great but other than that I followed it to the letter. 1lb of dough just barely covers filling, I might try 1.5lb next time. I will be making this again an again, it's a fair amount of work, but wll worth it.

This was just OK. And it was a ton of work.

My Chilean friend, who loves empanadas, says these are the best he's ever tried, and I agree. Instead of pizza dough, I use the flaky galette dough recipe from the Tartine cookbook. I also add saffron to filling. Make the filling a day in advance and the flavors will have time to get to know each other. Excellente!

I did not make this as written, I had to make some changes for times sake. I bought frozen empanada wrappers (they were fantastic) and I used ground turkey meat. Made this way it was good but I thought it was not nearly saucy enough. I did add 1 chipotle chili in adobo as someone recommended. I'll make these again but make more sauce use more olives and give them a little more heat.

I made this recipe almost completely as-is, and it was delicious and a big hit at a tapas party I threw. I liked the big size. I would have made my own dough but didn't have time, but the pizza dough worked great. For those who said the filling needed more flavor--I wonder if perhaps you did not boil it down enough. I found that I had to boil it down probably 30-40 additional minutes until there was very little liquid left in the pan. This concentrated the flavors so that it was absolutely terrific and flavorful! Also, make sure to use green olives, not black, as green have much more flavor to add. Just chop them up small and you'll never taste them individually.

These were delicious. I added red chile flakes, and doubled the olives. These were delicious and simple to make. I used the "Empanada Dough" recipe and baked them according to the recipe the dough was to accompany.

Not bad. I used phyllo dough and that worked well. I think it could use some kick...curry or crushed red pepper powder. I also preferred black olives rather than green (personal pref).

I followed a reviewer's advice and made these with the http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Empanada-Dough-230786 recipe and not the pre-made pizza dough. This recipe took several hours for me to make, but oh. my. word. it's the best savory dish I have ever made and was quickly devoured and raved about by my friends. So good.

My husband is Spaniard and he liked this dish, a very traditional mixture of flavors. I short cut the chicken process by using boneless, skinless thighs and upping the chorizo content a bit. Used 2 lbs. Trader Joe's pizza dough, made 8 empanadas and froze 5 for a future quick supper.

This recipe was very good. I would recommend that you try adding a little chipotle in adobo sauce in here...just a tsp. It gives it a nice, flavor, and a little more heat. Also you can combine chicken breasts and thighs. I've had great results with that. And you can serve the leftover filling over rice. It makes a nice meal.

This is really an exceptional recipe. I made it for a potluck dinner, despite never having attempted it prior to the day of the event. The one thing I would caution is that there is a lot of sauce in the filling, even when reduced to a heavy cream consistency. I used a slotted spoon to fill the empanadas, but still had sauce bubbling up through the vent hole. If you use the empanada dough recipe on this site (Gourmet magazine, October 2004), double it if you want to use up all of the filling.

I made little crescent shaped empanadas (instead of one big one) as part of a tapas menu, and they were quite a hit. I assembled them a few days ahead and froze them, then baked them just before serving. I used the empanada dough recipe on this site - it was perfect and easy to work with.

I thought this dish was exceptional, but my family liked it (and ate seconds) but seemed not as impressed as I thought they would. Again...I LOVED the mix of flavors...so maybe my family doesn't have as descriminating of a palate as I do! I was a bit disappointed in their response, as I thought this would be one of those we "have to have this again"...definitely try it, but not with those who cannot appreciate a great meal!

Time consuming: mm hmm. Worth it? YES! As we were making it, we were coming up with little ways to change the filling for next time. This recipe seems so flexible. We used the empanada recipe that appears first when you search for empanada dough on this site.

The best recipe on this site. My love of French food does not keep me from loving this one. But then, I am not from Montreal!

My rating is for the filling, which is outstanding. I gave this recipe to guests to bring to our gourmet group dinner. Instead of using the chicken legs, they used meat from a pre-roasted chicken and cooked it again as directed in the recipe. It was fantastic. I suppose you could use frozen pizza dough but I'm not a fan of pre-fab preservative-laden dough, so they used a great recipe I had for a yeast-based empanada dough. They made individual empanadas using 3" circles of dough and baked at 350 for about 20 minutes to serve as hors d'oeuvres. Though labor- intesive they were amazing, and I'm certain you could double the recipe and freeze them for later use.

A labor of love, these empanadas were delicious. The chicken was delicious (next time I might use thighs instead to save some effort), and the mix of flavors was really nice. I used individual empanada discs that I brought from Argentina, which made this even better!

This recipe has captivated our whole family. It is so easy to make once you get the hang of it. Use the empanada dough from the big yellow Gourmet cookbook - PERFECTION!

This sounded so good that I made this into appetizers-size small empanadas. I followed the recipe and then chopped everything in the food processor. Make sure that you do this in small batches and very quickly as you don't want to turn it into a paste. I made 50 of these and my back was killing me. I still had 1/2 the meat mixture left over so I rolled them into a log, put it on the pastry and rolled it up like a jelly roll. After it had cooled, I sliced them into 2 inch sections. While not as pretty as the real thing, it tasted the same and was a fraction of the work.

Made this for Father's Day along with other Spanish inspired dishes. I used chicken breast meat (on hand), regular not smoked paprika and the empanada dough on this site. Also, added a little brown sugar (my dad is from Central America and appreciates the sweet) made it like a pie because I had too much filling for the dough made and everyone loved it the best!

In my opinion, this is one of the best recipes on this site. I made the empanadas for a Cinco de Mayo party and everyone thought that they were superb. One crucial change that I made was to use real empanada dough, which you can find frozen in Latin supermarkets. It really makes them amazing!

This deserves 3.5 forks, I just wanted to raise the dish's average on the search page. It's a good basic recipe for empanadas, although 2 bay leaves was far too much for the recipe. It overpowered the entire pastry. I also chose to use my regular empanada dough over the pizza dough and loved the slightly sweet taste of the dough with the savory chorizo and chicken. Definitely a keeper.

Great filling. DON'T use 2 bay leaves. Just use 1. Also I'd forego the pizza dough in favor of the recipe for empanada dough on this site. It has a better texture. Don't let this scare you. It's not spicy as some have described it. It's more savory and a complex little nosh to tide you over til dinnertime.
