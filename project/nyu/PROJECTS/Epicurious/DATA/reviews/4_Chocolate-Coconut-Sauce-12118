I have made this three times now. It has become my boyfriends staple begging treat. I found myself on Friday at three in the morning being schmoozed into making it. The coconut flavor should be subtle but rich. If you over pour the rum the sauce won't set up nicely. Don't skimp on the chocolate, it makes a big big difference.

This is absolutely delicious. Made it last year as Christmas gifts and making it again this year for Christmas dinner. I could only find artificial coconut extract, so didn't use that and used a little extra coconut rum instead. Highly recommend using Cruzan Rum.

Made this when it first appeared in Gourmet. If you like coconut and chocolate, you'll love this. Superb on vanilla, coconut or chocolate ice cream. Didn't use the coconut extract or rum, and it was still great.
