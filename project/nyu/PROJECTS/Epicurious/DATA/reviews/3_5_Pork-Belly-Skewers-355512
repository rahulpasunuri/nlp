I took the leap and made these for a party. They were great. I think the thing that made them really great was the watermelon balls that the other reviewer suggested. I think without that the pork skewers may have been a bit much but with the watermelon they were amazing and very impressive.

I followed this exactly, save the daun salam, which I couldn't find. The texture was great and the meat well seasoned, but I did not enjoy the chile sauce - to me, it took away from the parts of the dish that were remarkable. I think next time I'll try Thomas Keller's braised pork belly preparation, where the sauce is simply a reduction of the braising liquid.

Oh, sweet pork belly. I ate at the Fatty Crab a couple weeks ago and had their pork belly and pickled watermelon skewer, so I was excited to try this. I made a double batch for a halloween party, and they disappeared as fast as I could grill 'em. For next time, I would shorten the braising time (I braised for 5 hours because I had 6 lbs in the oven) and cut slightly thicker slices. Some of my belly fell off the skewers (rookie mistakes, I'm sure). Also, I'd clip the skewers in half to avoid clutter, and grease the grill so they don't stick. I was happy that the chili sauce seemed to make enough for this recipe twice over. If you're curious, try pairing this with watermellon balls tossed with some basil or mint and soaked in a sweet brine (2C sugar, 1.5C water, 3/4C white wine vinegar, 1T salt, juniper berries, grains of paradise, pinch of pepper flakes boiled for 2 minutes and cooled to room temp) for 10 minutes. A friend described the restaurant's dish as a "life-changing bite." If not life-changing, a pickled watermellon ball on the tip of your pork belly skewer is ridiculously delicious.

This was a fantastic recipe. The several steps stretched over the course of a few days meant that I wasn never busy with cooking, but when you tell your guests you've been preparing the dish for three or four days they tend to be impressed. The flavors were impressive enough on their own, of course. I followed the recipe fairly precisely. I used habanero peppers rather than red chiles, and I brined for 48 hours. The greatest challenge was removing the belly from the braising dish without spilling it (the belly) all over the floor. It was so tender at that point that I thought I might drink the whole thing with a straw. This was fun to make, to serve, and the eating was transcendental.

We just made this for friends this past weekend - it was exceptional! We used regular bay leaves for the brine, as well as using a mix of brown and white sugar for the sauce. We grilled it on our gas grill and it was delicious. Straightforward, easy recipe to make - there is just a lot of waiting time. I highly recommend this recipe.

Loved this recipe, and had a great result on the gas grill. Trying again this week using charcoal, and can hardly wait. I found the recipe a bit confusing at first. Funny, the directive to make a "1/3 of an inch" cut called the whole thing in doubt. Throwing caution to the wind, I went with 1/2" cuts, and on to glory. No luck finding Indonesian bay leaves yet, but palm sugar is an easy get in Asian markets. Brown sugar and ordinary bay leaves substitute nicely. A supermarket belly might do well enough for this recipe, but I'm not anxious to find out. The quality of the fat is the make or break here.
