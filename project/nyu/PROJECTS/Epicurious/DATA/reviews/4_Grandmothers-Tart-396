Incredibly easy but looks like it took hours of hard labor. Delicious. Gets rave reviews and looks just like the ones found in bakeries throughout Italy.

A huge hit again and again with friends, co-workers and my inlaws. I made this for a party and cut the tart on a diagonal into small two bite pieces (1.5 inch square) and put them in cupcake papers. Great for dessert and even better the morning after with a cup of tea.

Very cool. I used zest from whole lemon (using my new favorite toy, a microplane) and found the dough, very, very easy to work with. I did in a lightly greased tart pan (without a removable bottom) and pieces still came out easily. I also only did about five lattice lengths. I did make mistake of using too much jam (blueberry) -- 2 cups is too much, this should be thin versus thick. Everyone LOVED it, one friend took leftovers home for breakfast the next morning!

This was a simple dessert that only took minutes to put to gather for a spur of the moment special dinner for friends . I will make again and again .........

This tart is easy and beautiful to look at. I've made it several times- it's perfect for summertime, when it can be too hot and sticky to roll out dough. Everyone thinks you spent all day on it!

This is one of my favorite recipes. It always turns out perfect, looks beautiful and is so easy to prepare. I have used peach, apricot, strawerry...almost any type of jam will work as a filling....a wonderful classic dessert!!!

I loved this recipe! The dough was simple to make in my food processor, and easy to work with! I did not have any lemons on hand, so i used tangerine peel instead...YUMMY!..the crust was rich...and flavorful..and easy to work with. I also had many jars of preserves left over from Christmas basket gifts..so i used the Sour Cherry Preserves.. *don't skimp on the filling*...instead of one cup of preserves..i used the whole jar..which probably was equivalent to 1 and a half cups..and it filled the tart perfectly..with no spill over..i highly recommend this simple, quick dessert!
