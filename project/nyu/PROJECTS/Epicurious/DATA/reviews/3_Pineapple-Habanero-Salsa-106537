Very good, great over chicken & pork. I left out the thyme and added a pinch more salt. It was delicious.

I'm going to mix the solid ingredients with a small jar of apple jelly and see how close that comes to the commercial variation used as a dip...Love this with roasted chick and in fajitas

I grilled the pineapple, used agave syrup and garlic in addition to ingredients called for. I also put the ingredients in the food processor briefly. I use as a sauce for chicken and pizza. My husband loves the pizza with this sauce on it.

I planned to take this salsa to a cookout, but it stayed home. The flavor was OK, not as bright or spicy (used 1/2 tsp habanero) as expected and the brownish-yellow color from the molasses wasn't too attractive. It does work well as a topping for fish or chicken though, just not as salsa.

Nope as salsa; watery, molasses didn't work. However, next day baked with a ham..not bad.

I didn't have scallions or a habanero pepper--substituted garlic and a little minced green bell pepper and it was still fantastic. I can't wait to try it again with the habanero! We used it on pasta with a little sliced deli ham, olive oil and parmesan cheese. Tasted like a Hawaiin pizza and everyone liked it.

I got rave reviews on a variation of this recipe: I subsituted chopped mint for the thyme, added one minced clove of garlic, and grilled the pineapple lightly. Don't be afraid of the habanero, they're easy to handle; just don't be tempted to add any seeds. I added a few once and ended up with salsa that made you sweat.

This is the second year I have entered this recipe in my company's "Salsa Dip" contest. It just keeps getting rave reviews. I used a jalepeno pepper instead of the habanero chili - just a little chicken! Maybe next year.

Also not a molasses fan so I used honey instead. This got rave reviews from all my dinner guests. I made it to serve over grilled pork chops but my guests were ladling it over everything but the salad.

I served this as a condiment with chicken/chorizo paella. The next night I served it over softened goat cheese and a loaf of Tuscan bread. It was an outstanding hit in both instances with everyone raving for the recipe.

This worked very well for me and my family although not being a fan of molasses I used red raspberry syrup , it also added a bit of sweet that we liked.

This was good. It would be a lot better over chicken. Next time, I'll try serving it that way.
