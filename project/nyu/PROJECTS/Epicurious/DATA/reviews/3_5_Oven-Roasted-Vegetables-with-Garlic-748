I made this and served it with the Garlic-Roasted Pork Shoulder for a dinner party - very good. I followed the recipe exactly, and added red potatoes, which came out perfectly.

I'd never eaten parsnips before. What a great introduction. Used fresh herbs, used only 1/2 the oil (grapeseed oil).

This recipe was mediocre. I think that there are much better ways to cook carrots and parsnips. I used dried herbs, maybe fresh would be better. Sorry!

Served this with ginger marinaded Pork Tenderloin and it was excellent-I added red peppers, green peppers, zucchini and red potatoes. Will absolutely make again!

The fresh herbs on this were wonderful! I added sweet potato to the vegetable mix, and next time I'll throw in some fresh mushrooms as well.

pretty good, somewhat overcooked but I'd make again. Would cut the oil/butter in 1/2 next time, add potatoes and cut the cooking time back.

It's a keeper. Great flavors. I made it a few months ago and plan to make it for Sunday dinner tomorrow. It got rave reviews.

This was simply delicious. The vegetables tasted great. My husband has asked for this dish at least 3 times a month and in the summer once a week. We loved it.

I've made this dish for our annual prime rib Epiphany Dinner at church in the past. I will make it again this year - it always gets rave reviews. It travels well & keeps during our evensong service.

These were wonderful. I also added a leek sliced lengthwise and potatoes. I used 1 tablespoon of olive oil when I mixed them together and lightly sprayed the pan. You don't need all the oil and butter - waste of calories & extra fat. I served these with Lemon-Rubbed Chicken Legs with Garlic & Rosemary on this site. The sauce from the chicken was amazing with the vegies especially the potatoes. This dinner was a big hit especially considering how little time and effort it took!

You can't go wrong here. Roasted carrots and parsnips (and onions!) are transformed by roasting. I also added some cut up potatoes.

This is an excellent dish - even vegetable "haters" will love this!
