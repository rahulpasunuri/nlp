I've made this recipe at least a dozen times, and it always turns out great! I've used hazelnuts and walnuts, but prefer the hazelnuts. The dressing is delicious, and I love the addition of the boiled egg, really tasty!

The perfect vinaigrette paired with hazelnuts and asparagus = fantastic, simple dish. I'll be making this so often I'll end up knowing the exact proportions by heart.

This was a last minute effort to take the place of an asparagus frittata. In addition to the asparagus, I sauteed some leeks and mushrooms (they were supposed to go in the frittata)and tossed them all together. It's way easier to make the dressing in the blender. Due to the leeks being one of the vegetables, I didn't use the shallots in the dressing. If you put the toasted walnuts into the blender after the dressing has been emulsified, and just pulse a few seconds, the dressing is OUT OF THIS WORLD good! Super creamy. I put the dressing onto the veggies while they were still warm and let everything sit out to come to room temp. I made a double batch and the whole thing was eaten by 8 people. It was a huge hit.

Easy, elegant, and fast - this recipe is a keeper! Hazelnuts are now coming into season so should be a great addition for holiday meals.

Simply delicious. I placed a few cooked shrimp next to the asparagus and added about 1 tsp of fresh chopped tarragon. The tarragon added great flavor, the shrimp added color as well as taste. The dish was beautiful and made an elegant first course.

I too used walnuts because I searched high and low but couldn't find hazelnuts anywhere. This was a fantastic dish which I am sure will become a staple. I really think the egg was the perfect finishing touch on this dish, so don't omit it.

This was so good and I will make it over and over again. I think I may decrease the mustard just a tad but other than that...not a change.

I made this for a Christmas potluck to rave reviews. It traveled well and did not require the hostess to use her oven to heat up yet another dish.

I agree with everybody else. Delicous. A great alternative to hollandaise sauce. I make it frequently when asparagus is in season. The vinaigrette can be made ahead to save time, unlike hollandaise. (And I love hazelnuts)

I love this recipe. A great departure from my usual asparagus/hollandaise sauce combo. I like that you can serve it room temperature so that you don't have that last-minute frenzy of serving it hot and keeping it hot. It tastes "formal", but is so easy.

Great and easy recipe. I used yellow onion and walnuts instead of shallots and hazelnuts. Tastes "Fancy".

I am amazed that no one has rated this recipe to date. I make it frequently and always get compliments and requests for the recipe. Delicious and convenient, as it can be prepared somewhat in advance and served at room temp. Try this one.
