I tried this frosting based on the two rave reviews it was given and found that the end result is absolutely sickeningly sweet. I certainly wouldn't make it again as is. Perhaps it might be better if the recipe is adjusted to make it more palatable; however, that would mean wasting even more ingredients trying to get it right.

Mmm....this is really should get a 3 1/2 fork rating. It tasted great...but the frosting should be doubled! Certainly doesn't make enough to make it look like the picture. The toasted pecans on the outside of the cake taste great with the frosting...almost like candied pecans. This is great, but not quite the showstopper I was hoping for.

We didn't make the cake--even though it sounds REALLY good. We made the icing to go on some cupcakes. The BEST frosting. Fluffy. Wonderful caramel flavor. This frosting will go perfectly with yellow cake and chocolate cake as well as the apple cake. I know we are supposed to review the whole recipe but I had to tell you about this divine frosting.
