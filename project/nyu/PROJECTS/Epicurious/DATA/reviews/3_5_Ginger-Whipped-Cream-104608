Excellent. I used whipped cream to accompany the spiced necterine cake, turned ordinary to extra-ordinary. Note, for a slightly richer ginger taste, add 1/2tsp ground ginger along with the sugar.

I served angel food cake topped with blueberries, strawberries, and this delicious whipped cream, and it was a hit. Mincing the crystallized ginger took some time (is there an easier way then simply chopping it with a large knife?), but it was worth it. So little effort for such fantastic results. I will definitely make this again.

This whipped cream added a easy way to glorify a basic peach cobbler. Very Good!
