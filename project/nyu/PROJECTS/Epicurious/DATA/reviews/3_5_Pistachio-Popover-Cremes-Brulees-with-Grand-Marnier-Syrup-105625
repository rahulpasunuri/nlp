Popovers did not pop- they were dense, somewhat chewy cakes. Will try a few tips from other websites next time- heating the popover pan before pouring the batter in, beating wet ingredients together then adding to dry ingredients, not opening the oven at all during the baking process. Custard was absolutely delicious. Broiler method of caramelizing the sugar on top did not work- it somehow brought oil out of the custard so it was just a oily mess on top. Instead of orange syrup, I made Exotic Caramel Sauce recipe found on Epicurious site- delicious.

Would it be a problem to use a metal 9x5x3 loaf pan to cook the custard? Also, has anyone tried using the oven broiler instead of a blowtorch?

So i was really freaking out about the whole not having a popover pan issue. The closest thing I could find to a popover pan in a hurry (It was Easter day) was from Ikea and the holes were pretty deep. It was a 12 cup pan so i put batter in every other hole. When i realized it would take 40 minutes, and i actually needed 8 desserts, I ended up filling 6 well buttered ramekins. To my surprise, everything popped (to the point where they were touching the oven rack above). I ended up using the popovers from the ramekins as they were much bigger. The presentation was beautiful and everything was quite simple. Also, in a moment of absentmindedness I forgot to bake the custard in a water bath and it came out lumpy. I chucked it and started over. What resulted was a very smooth and creamy custard. (the second time around I thought I had messed up again as the top of the custard looked funny. I scraped away a thin layer and discovered the beautiful creme underneath)

My popovers weren't standing up like the picture shows so I rested them on the top so the custard wouldn't pour out. This is one of those recipes that people think is more difficult than it really is. Big kudos from our guests!

mine didn't puff up like they should.. i think this is because i should have used a higher protein flour. bread flour. but it made great pistacio bread!

Beautiful, magnificent, delicious!!! Don't hesitate!!! I wouldn't make it for too many guests since it can't be done completely in advance and it should be brought to the table in individual dishes, but I'd absolutely make it again. Any orange liquor will work!

although i bought popover pan, mine didn't pop so great. But i will definitely do this one again. I made it for the day after xmas (so if it didn't work out there wouldn't be a bid deal) and it's so wonderful. Awesome. Delectable. the sauce made a nice addition to the already super sensation of the creme brulee. Please try it. You won't be sorry.

Would mini muffin tins work better than regular muffin tins? In the picture, these look small. I have both regular & mini tins so suggestions would help me alot! Thanks

For those making popovers in muffin tins: leave one empty space between each popover, and do not open the oven. This approximates the effect of popover tins. otherwise, use custard cups spaced 2 inches apart. Filling each tin is sure to make the popovers "not pop-over"

This is an awesome recipe. There is another version that a coffee company is promoting, but this one is much better. I did cut back the Grand Marnier to 2 teaspoons. The sauce was amazing with the fresh strawberries I used for garnish. My popovers puffed up just fine, but I did use a popover pan. I highly recommend the recipe to anyone who wants to impress.

I didn't have popover cups so I used a muffin pan. They popped, then fell. Gran Marnier overpowered the pistachio flavor a bit. I'm going to buy popover cups and try it again.

my popovers didn't "popover" - and were a bit heavy - ended up breaking them up - spooning the creme brulee and then syrup over them - wasn't real pretty but it sure was good!!!
