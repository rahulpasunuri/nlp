I made these in '91 when first published. My wife and I had our first Christmas cocktail party and they really wowed the guests. I couldn't find the candied violets so I sugared some mint leaves and used cranberries. It colors added to the Christmas theme. I've made it a dozen times since and the only issue is always with the white chocolate. Make sure the excess powdered sugar is tapped off and freeze the centers before dipping. One year I even placed the chocolates on a wire rack and poured the melted white chocolate over in small batches. Much cleaner finish. Just lift and tap off the excess when transferring to a wax paper covered plate or tray.

When I make chcolate truffles, I don't cool-and-scoop the truffle mix as most recipes say. Instead, I ladel the warm chocolate mixture into a freezer Ziploc bag and let it cool down quite a bit on the countertop until it has the "right" consistency (you will learn the right consistency with some experimentation). I then cut one of the bottom corners out of the bag to make a piping bag. I then squeeze out truffle-sized dollops of the mix onto a cookie sheet, which is then placed into the freezer for cooling. When they are cooled down, I then take them out of the freezer and roll them into round balls between my hands. After doing this for Christmas for about 12 years, I still have not perfected a good and enduring coating for the outside of my truffles. Mine are ugly, but loved by everyone.

I cut this out of the magazine when it was first published in 1991 and hung on to it Christmas after Christmas hoping to have time to make these. I finally did a few years ago and they were wonderful. On the first day I didn't think they were so great and was going to toss them, but after 2 days the flavors were so intense and the truffle so moist and set that they were like a slice of heaven. I am making them again this year for the holidays and am going to make a double batch this time.

I have made this a few times. It is time consuming but so worth it. Read other reviews prior to making it and definitely make sure you have enough freezer space.

This is a lovely centerpiece for a dessert party, but be sure you have a lot of available freezer space before you embark on this chocolate odyssey - or that you are on good terms with neighbors who do!

A little complicated, but worth the effort. Absolutely delicious! I used creme fraiche instead of American sour cream. Essential: use the BEST chocolate!! And make sure it is not too bitter.

I would strongly suggest freezing the centers solid and only taking a portion out of the freezer to dip. For a smoother filling, stir gently and don't overwhisk. The more the ganache is beaten, the more crystalized it will become. Also, the person that was having problems with the coating seizing..make sure that there isn't excess powder on your truffles, actually it's not even necessary if you freeze the centers solid and absolutely avoid getting the coating wet! If you work fast, it's not necessary to temper chocolate.

I've made this a dozen times or more, always to rave reviews. I've also used very small cones and made miniature trees (30-ish truffles per tree) to give as hostess gifts. Always appreciated, and always worth the time and expense.

I made this for the first time last week for a Christmas party at our home. Although I will make it again-it was fabulous!-there are a couple of things I would do differently. First, I had to double the recipe for the truffles, as there was no way that it made 78 truffles. It was more like 45 or 50. Second, I would be more careful when it comes to removing the excess chocolate off the truffles. Third, I found it invaluable to poke a whole in the tower first with a toothpick to add the flowers and the leaves. This way, it was very east to just push the flowers and leaves in between the tight spaces between truffles. I also had to make my own candied violets with royal icing since I couldn't find anyone that made them. Any suggestions were to get them? You can't believe the compliments that you will hear from your guests. This was very, very good. Fair warning though-it looks so good that guests are a little reluctant to eat it.

I must say this was a little time consumming and costly, but it was worth it. The only problem I had was my dipping chocolate started to clump after several truffles were dipped. It seems the powder was coming off the truffles. I have revised my approach and will make them again.

This is a very easy recipe. I've been making these for the past 4 years. Most people think I purchased the truffles in a store. When I tell them that I made them they in awe.

I made this tower for Easter and used it for the center peice on the table. I used pink and white mini-carnations which hold up much better and it was spectacular looking. The best part was they tasted just as spectacular and I had requests to make them for weddings. It is not as difficult as one would think but time consumming. Make the truffles a day in advance.

Following the recipe exactly and tripling the quantity, I made my wedding cake. I made a tier mould out of foam and poked truffles all around. Decorated with fresh orchid flowers, sprinkled with cocoa and topped with a wedding couple figurine. All my guests were amazed and I would make it again... only that it will be smaller for my anniversary. Can't send any photos, otherwise I will attach a pix of the wedding cake.

Every year I have a huge Christmas party and the menu is strictly hor d'oerves and desserts. This recipe was the centerpiece of the dessert table the first year and everyone expects it each year. What a worthwhile use of time!

Yum-yum!!! Well worth the calories, and not as difficult to make as you would think...just don't try it in the summer unless your house is air-conditioned!!...truffles don't like heat and humidity.

I've been making this recipe every Christmas since the December 1991 issue. The truffles always recieve rave reviews and friends and family would be disappointed if I chose not to make them. I do substitute Kahula or Frangelico for the orange liqueur. Well worth the time!!!

I have made these truffles for Christmas several times. They are very time-consuming & labor intensive but worth the oohs and ahhs you get from friends who get them as gifts! I don't make the "tree", I just make all the truffles and give them as gifts a few at a time. The first time I made them I tried to use white chocolate chips instead of the expensive Lindt white chocolate, BIG mistake, I ended up throwing away the chips and going back to the store for Lindt.

I've been making this recipe every Christmas for the past six years both to add to our own Christmas treats and to give as gifts. Everyone loves the truffles, and, although they do take about two days to make, they are well worth it. I've used florist's foam wrapped in foil instead of the styrofoam cone, and that workds very nicely as well, especially when decorated with ivy or other holiday plants. I do have one question though, how can I avoid having the truffles melt into the white chocolate coating and still get a smooth exterior?
