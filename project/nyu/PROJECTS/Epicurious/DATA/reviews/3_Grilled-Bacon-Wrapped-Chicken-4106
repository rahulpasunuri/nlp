I really liked this recipe. I baked it and used soy sauce instead teriyaki sauce.

We marinated the chicken using the homemade Teriyaki recipe quoted below and grilled them on the George Foreman. Bacon burned so added it after cooking. Great taste.

We made this recipe using the broiler and it was really good! The chicken was juicy and flavorful. Will definitely make this again.

I've made this several times, both on the grill and oven-broiled. Always add a touch of honey and lemon to the marinade. Comes out beautifully every time. My family loves it with pasta salad on hot nights.

Easy to prepare, tasty. Produces a tender and moist chicken. Delicious.

It was just ok.

I thought this recipe was pretty weak. I must agree with the other reviewers that it's impossible to figure out how to wrap the chicken around the tomato, even after pounding it out. And bacon really doesn't go with the chicken every well. Way too much effort for the result.

I did not care for how smoky the chicken tasted. My husband enjoyed it, my son and I did not finish our portions. Will not make again.

We thought this was a delicious and simple week-day meal. To keep the bacon from burning, I charred it on a lower rack on my grill and then moved it higher up. It was away from the flames, but cooked nicely. You also have to be quick with a water bottle to spray flare ups.

This dish is wonderful. I made my own teriyaki sauce since I cannot ever find a bottled one that I like. This chicken is sooooo moist.The sauce recipe I used is the grilled teriyaki pork chops with pineapple salsa. I love the bacon flavor with the breast. It melted in my mouth! Also for those who have problems with the bacon burning: when you grill place your coals on either side and put your chicken in the middle for indirect heat and the last 2 minutes of cooking move them over the coals to get the charred markings and slight crispies!

The bacon really makes the difference, giving it the smokey flavor and keeping it nice and moist. As suggested by another reviewer, I plan to use the thicker basting teriyaki next time. Quick, simple and tasty. Will do it again!

This wasn't bad, but I agree, it was difficult not to burn the bacon. I used chicken cutlets that were thin, and kind of rolled them and then put the bacon on over them. My family liked them a lot, so I'll make again, good for kids.

This recipe is both scrumptious and EASY! The best thing about it is the kids love it! I used peppered bacon to wrap the chicken, which also added a little zip. YUM!

This dish is simply fantastic. It has been the favorite at each of our summer gatherings this year. I like to use the thicker "baste & glaze" teriyaki which really coats the chicken and gives the dish a smooth and luscious flavor. The crispy bacon flavor of course is an added bonus and a favorite with my kids.

We make a lot of grilled chicken and do a lot of entertaining and this recipe is one of our very favorites. The chicken comes out moist and flavorful every time! My husband keeps close watch on the grill so the bacon doesn't burn.

I don't know what I did wrong with this recipe but the chicken was very mushy. Maybe I marinated it too long. It seems anytime I marinate a meat using teriyaki sauce, the meat ends up being mushy, almost like the meat has broken down in some way. Anybody know why???

Yum,yum,yum! The ultimate summer dish. My kids ate it up and asked for seconds! This one's a keeper!

Way, way too overwhemled by the 'teriyaki' sauce, which is so simplistic, and not particularly great on its own terms. Stick to the classics.

Be sure you marinade for the whole time and watch that the bacon doesn't burn before the chicken is done.
