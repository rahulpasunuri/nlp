A quick simple meal which can be made in a few minutes--what could be better for a weekday night? This was really terrific and tasty--and I lived in Asia for many years --it was good enough to be authentic. However I did throw in some hot sauce at the end.

Relatively easy to make and yet it's quite yummy. The smell of this lured my husband downstairs to the kitchen. Even my picky-eater kids eat it, minus the green onions for them. Since it was cold when I made this, I also heated up some low-sodium chicken broth, added some mushrooms, carrots and ginger to accompany this dish.

Perhaps one of the sillier recipes on the site: no flavor, and nothing there. Asian Food for Dummies. Don't bother.

I've made this twice and both times my husband and I were thrilled with the outcome. The pork stays tender and the Chinese 5 spice imparts an exotic and wholly satisfying flavor. The only change I made is slicing the radishes into half moons instead of rounds.

This turned out great...I'm not much of a cook but I had bought soba noodles on a whim and wanted to use them and some other random asian ingredients I had. I added some Sriracha, minced garlic, and sesame oil like people suggested and substituted some white wine for the rice wine vinegar. I think the radishes and green onions really made it. Pretty easy and really good!

Thanks to reviewer tips, this recipe turned out great! The pork was tender and flavorful and the noodles and veggies were tasty. We added garlic to the stir fry and a little tahini paste to the noodles for added flavor. We cooked our noodles less than the package indicated (about 4 minutes), which was plenty. Soba noodles cook fast and get sticky easily. Does anyone out there have tips for preventing the stickyness?

This was a great weeknight meal. Using other reviewers suggestions, I added Chile garlic sauce and a few drops of hot chili sauce and used less oil. It was perfect. No leftovers.

Super yummy, used less oil. Added some egg scrambled with sake. Even our preschooler loved it. If it was too bland, maybe your 5 spice has been hanging around for too long.

I love five-spice, so this worked for me. Two issues, tho: there was too much oil -- could have used half as much -- and it really needed hot chili sauce or something to add zip. With those modifications, a keeper. My husband filled his plate twice.

The family tolerated this recipe, but no one wants to try it again. It was very easy, but also very bland. It would need a major overhaul to make it interesting.

I thought the flavors were a little bland, but my picky husband loved this recipe and requested it again (which is rare). Quite easy to prepare.

The recipe is boring as written, but with some more spices (as suggested by others) it's a keeper.

Made a few changes. Used pork tenderloin cut up into small pieces. Left out the radishe. Used seasoned rice vinegar and substituted sesame oil for the peanut oil and only used two Tbsp. Doubled soy sause and vinegar. And lastly, I added finely minced garlic and ginger to the sause. Delicious! My husband loved it!

This was ok but pretty boring. It was also way too brown.

This was delicious. I couldn't find the Chinese 5 spice powder, so I rubbed 3 tsp. of Sun Bird Stir-Fry Oriental Seasoning Mix and a lot of black pepper onto the raw pork slices. When stir-frying the pork, I did add about 1/2 tsp. of minced gingerroot. Only used about 1+ Tbs. of peanut oil to cook the pork (and didn't need to add any more oil later). Couldn't find the appropriate noodles, so used Kluski style. YUM. YUM. Hubby says--make it anytime! And it is SO easy!!!

This was allright but the amount of 5 spice was much too overwhelming...it was difficut to taste any other flavors. I would suggest using less than is called for. With some tweaking this could be an excellent dish.

This was super easy and really yummy. I'll definitely make it again. I used Chinese noodles rather than soba.

This is very like something I improvised the other night. I first toasted (then removed) some whole black pepper and some red pepper flakes in the hot oil (like in Indian cooking). After cooking the pork, I added 1" chunks of red, yellow and orange bell pepper to the stiry fry. The seasoning consisted of the 5-spice powder, soy sauce, and vinegar mentioned, together with about a teaspoon of minced garlic and a couple of teaspoons of Splenda (sugar). I thickened it with arrowroot at the last minute. Even the preschoolers loved it!

I too loved this simple asian recipe. My only alteration is to add 2 Tablespoons Sesame Oil (instead of Peanut Oil) and some chopped ginger at the end to further enhance flavors.

Soooo easy - and very satisfying. Served it with stir-fry broccoli and it was yummy! If you are expecting a complicated sophisticated dish, this is not it. Simple good flavors that satisfy with little effort.

I have made this twice now, and even the kids like it. The five spice flavor is pleasingly different, and yes, the radishes work, but I added some broccoli last time for a little color and it complemented it quite well. Quick, interesting, and tasty!

To the cook from Longmont: try the silver-wrapped chicken. It's my favorite asian recipe from this site.

Have made this twice, each time to rave reviews from my husband. Because my local grocery store doesn't carry soba noodles, I served it over basmati rice instead, which was perfectly satisfactory. To people who cannot stand the smell of vinegar cooking (like myself), rest assured that the final dish tastes far, far better than you will expect it to.

I'm sometimes hesitant with the asian inspired recipes in this magazine, they usually seem to be lacking something, but not this one! This was so easy and so tasty. I know what you're thinking, Radishes? But they work! This is a great weeknight dinner, healthy, quick, and delicious.
