I had the same experience. I cooked it and cooked it (for maybe 50 minutes?) and I still couldn't get the curd to thicken up enough. I tried adding some cornstarch, which helped, but not enough. When we put together our mini "test cake" the weight of the cake would press the lemon curd out from between the layers and down the sides of the cake. We're still going to use this recipe as a base, but will probably cut down the lemon juice a bit and add some cornstarch

I cooked this lemon curd for way longer than recipe calls for, and I still couldn't get it to thicken enough. It's not that it doesn't thicken as much as the recipe says; it's that even the amount described here doesn't create a curd strong enough to keep the cake layers from collapsing. Maybe that was just my experience. Maybe I didn't chill the curd long enough.

When I make this recipe I cut the lemon juice down by 1/2 and then it is perfect.

I found this too sour for my taste, and much of my family agreed. Especially pared with the very mild and not-so-sweet cake and frosting, this doesn't balance out well. I will use a different lemon curd recipe, one that uses egg yolks, not whole eggs. Not a problem, though, considering the dozens of egg whites needed for the cakes and frosting.
