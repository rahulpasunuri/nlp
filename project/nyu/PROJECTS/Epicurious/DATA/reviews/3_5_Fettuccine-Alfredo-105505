I used an old but treasured Corning Ware casserole over a very low flame for final prep. I will cut the butter by about a quarter next time. My husband and I both found the dish just a little *too* rich with so much fat. I cut back the salt to just a very small pinch, upped the pepper a few grinds, and also upped the amount of Reggiano a little bit too. With grilled sliced chicken breast on top and a glass of wine it's a casual but elegant meal that's easy to make. It was definitely a hit, we all but licked our plates.

I added some chicken that I made with pesto, dijon mustard, onions, and some chili peppers and it was deliciou. It thickened up beautifully without the use of any flour, great home made Alfredo that just happens to be gluten free!

Really simple, really basic, an excellent start! I added a blend of fontina and parm, garlic powder, spinach and saute'ed (?) broccoli. I made it for a catered event and it was devoured and the crowd favorite. I will make it again with my added twists.

This is my go-to Alfredo recipe. No others are as good or as simple. I sometimes make it as is, and sometimes expand upon it. Tonight I added fresh, local asparagus, peas, and parsley. Lemon zest makes a nice addition without overwhelming the dish. I like to go heavy on the pepper. It's just a great dish that highlights simple ingredients. As for all the fat, who cares? It's totally worth it.

I tried this recipe for lunch. It is very rich and I could only eat a few forkfuls of it because it was too much for my tummy to handle. Unfortunately, I added bacon as someone else had done, but this served only to make a dish already high in fat even more so. For a healthier alternative I would suggest adding small pieces of broiled chicken (skin removed of course)and sauteed mushrooms (drained) to the mix. I plan on making this dish again with half & half rather than heavy cream. Thanks for the recipe! :)

This recipe has become a family favorite and most often requested by my adult children. I usually serve it with chicken and roasted broccoli. Be sure to use parmigiano reggiano. For those novice cooks that are reluctant to try this, it's just about as easy to make as Kraft macaroni and cheese but a million times better.

For those of you who think Parmesan does not have enough flavor, you are obviously not using the real stuff. Using quality ingredients in this recipe truly makes the difference (I am lucky enough to be living in Germany where P-R costs about half of what it does in the US). I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful... and quick and easy!

This is a good recipe. However, I never understand why recipes use 12 oz. of pasta when it is usuall sold in 16 oz. pkgs. Also, the 1/3 c of cream is going to end up down the drain if you don't use it quickly. Having said that, I made this using a lb. of fettucine and 8 oz. heavy cream. I also added nutmeg and garlic, and a little crushed red pepper. Excellent.

Yummy! This is a great, easy, basic recipe with lots of room for variation and spontaneous tinkering. I added nutmeg, lemon zest, garlic, and spinach.

Here's the update - in addition to adding the nutmeg as stated in my previous review, I made it last night with spinach fettuccine and roasted & sliced chicken tenders. I cut the butter down by 2 TBS (I divided it so I still added the 3 thinly sliced TBS at the end). I wouldn't cut the butter down any more than I did, otherwise it might get a little dry. I am really happy I used the spinach fettucine because it gave me a little more time to combine all the ingredients without the noodles getting soggy - the spinach pasta is more robust. I higly recommend.

Rating: 4
This was so fabulous. My husband said it was the best fettucine alfredo he ever had. I also thought it was so flavorful - I don't think they use Reggiano in restaurants much so the flavor really pops. I added nutmeg to mine and served peas on the side. The large amount of butter used was intimidating to me, so next time I will cut it back by 2 tablespoons. I'm going to make it tonight, I'll let you know...

Based on other reviews, I added seared scallops and garlic to this recipe. First, I heated about 2 tablespoons of sweet butter with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sauteed four cloves of minced garlic in that. Increased the heat, seared 1/2 pound scallops, removed them to a plate, and used the garlic and butter remaining in the pan as the base for the sauce. Added the fresh, cooked pasta directly from it's pot without draining--just lifted it out and into the pan the scallops were cooked in, figuring it would hold on to about as much water as the recipe calls for. Also added about 1 tablespoon dried parsley, and omitted the salt. Increased the cheese to 1 cup. Very good, especially with freshly-made pasta (3 1/2c flour to 4 eggs).

I love Alredo Sauce, but never found an easy and not so thick recipe. We loved this recipe. I used butter instead of unsalted and just eliminated the salt in the water for cooking the pasta.

I took the advice from previous reviews and added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the butter, and a pinch of nutmeg and shrimp to the pasta before serving. Definitely not enough sauce to serve four people as a main course. I added enough pasta to serve three and there was enough sauce.

This is a nice and light alfredo sauce. I "flavored" the melted butter with a few garlic slivers (then removed them) and sauteed a minced shallot in the butter. Also, I kept added a pinch of nutmeg. I topped with chopped parlsey and more grated cheese. Very good

This was very good, simple Alfredo sauce. I added just a pinch of nutmeg, which I think made a nice, subtle diffence and is I believe, an ingredient in the original recipe.

Absolutely rocks w/ a few mods. First, add 2-3 minced cloves of garlic, sliced mushrooms, and shrimp to butter. Then, add about 1/5-2 cups of heavy cream (living in germany I can get cheap Danish heavy cream. packaged like evap milk, but in a carton). Finally, I took the advice of another and added some mixed white cheese (about .5 cup). Oh yeah, add basil, some thyme, and parsley. Sprinkle top w/ xtra parsley and serve. Perfetto!

To Maureen in Gilmore, CA - Your sauce was thin because you used half and half and powdered Parmesan. Heavy cream has less water than half and half. I wouldn't have decreased the Parm at all, maybe even increased it. Since I like Parm on everything, I buy it shedded in a bag. Keeps well and quicker than grating fresh. However, I always want this dish when I have no cream or half and half in the house, and I've made it with 2% milk. I add more Parmesan to make up for it and keep butter as is. Yes, kind of thin, but still good. Today, I have only a 1/4 cup Parm, so I'm going to add some goat cheese I have.

I made this after trying another alfredo recipe from this site using jack cheese instead of cream which turned out horribly... This recipe is better but still not the thick, creamy sauce that I'm looking for. I didn't add the sauce ingredients over the pasta, I made the sauce in the same pan that I sauteed chicken in (I also sauteed some red peppers for the dish). I used half and half instead of cream. I only used 1/4 cup parmasean because I only had the powdered kind and I think that might be what ruined the other recipe I tried (are you supposed to use fresh grated parmesean?). I was worried the sauce was too runny, but it tasted rich enough so I left it alone. Maybe the heavy cream would have made it thicker. It tasted just fine, just not what I expected of alfredo...

Superb recipe, I reserved some of the pasta cooking water and some more heavy cream and added it to increase the sauce.

Easy, easy & delicious. From start to finish including the cooking of the pasta - 30 minutes. I had a tri-fusilli pasta and used that instead of fettuccine. Recipe Modification: doubled the pepper, added fresh garlic. As good, if not better, than a higher end restaurant.

Great recipe! I took the advice of the reviewer who suggested adding garlic and lemon zest and I am very happy that I did. I used 2 cloves of garlic, minced, and added them to the melting butter. Then right before adding the pasta to the butter, I added 1 tablespoon of lemon zest, quickly stirred it into the butter, and then added the pasta. Perfect!

Great recipe for alfredo pasta! I made it with salmon and mushrooms this time (adding the sauteed mushrooms and fish to the noodles/butter when I add the cheese)... rave reviews! Worth its weight in calories and then some. I like to spice my alfredo up some in general, and a combo of sage, thyme, marjoram, and white pepper worked well with the fish and mushrooms. Will definitely keep this on hand for future use! Oh, it's also great with white cheese blends ie mozzarella, asiago, etc.

This recipe is fabulously decadent. I did, however, add some minced garlic and lemon zest, I found that the zest made it taste a bit more fresh. It is so good. I'm actually making it for dinner again tonight with lobsters. Well worth the calories, takes almost no time at all. Try this recipe!

This was sooooo good. I even put lobster meat in it. This dish has great flavor without the lobster, but we had 1 lobster left over from dinner last night so I thought "What the heck" and added this to the fettuccine. Totally out standing and easy too. Andrea

Really good. I reduced the butter to about 5 tbs. and added smoked salmon. It doesn't take any longer to make than heating up the gloppy stuff you buy in a jar, but it's much better. Adding more cheese thickens the sauce, for those who found it too thin.

If you like a thick Alfredo sauce, this is not the recipe for you. I loved it though. I used store-bought "fresh" pasta and eyeballed the measurements for the ingredients, which worked out very well. This is an easy recipe to tweak, by decreasing the butter, if it worries you, or adding a dash of nutmeg (or other flavoring) if that's what you prefer. I recommend trying it out.

I made this for my boyfriend and his brother. Got rave reviews except for the fact that it didn't make enough sauce! I also used a cup more cheese and half a cup more cream, and added six cloves of fresh minced garlic. Made the sauce seperately, then combined it with the pasta and put shrimp scampi over it. I'm going to make it again tonight but try for more sauce.

An EXCELLENT easy and tasty sauce to use as a base. I had sauted garlic in the butter prior and used freshly grated parmesan cheese-would not advise the use of canned if you want a great dish. A superb keeper and one I'll be making again-with all different flavors of parmesan cheese I can find.

This is my 14 year old son's favorite meal. He'll allow grilled chicken on top but he really likes it plain. He is forever announcing that I "finally know how to make good fettuccine alfredo." It is also super easy and fast so I'll let him get away with that. I added heavy cream to my standard shopping list and since we always have the other ingredients it appears on our table fairly often. My husband hates cream sauce generally; however, he eats this quite happily.

the recipe is basically the building block for a great Alfredo sauce. However, in the spirit of amateurism, I couldn't resist throwing in some cream cheese and using smoked Parmesan.

This recipe is great because it is simple, authentic, and tastes exactly how alfredo should taste. Make sure you're using a kitchen scale to measure the ounce-weight of the cheese--the right amount is very important. I like to add a couple dashes of ground nutmeg and some minced garlic to the butter before it heats up. As far as the heavy cream, you can use extra pasta water as a substitute. AND USE REAL PARMEGGIANO! That fake stuff by Kraft will turn to rubber when melted.

This recipe was great!!! I would definitely make it again! My whole family loved it, although I made a couple small changes. 1)I added 2 chicken breasts marinated in the juice of half a lemon and olive oil. 2) I added broccoli florets to add some more flavor and color. 3) I only used 6 tbsp. of butter. A stick is way too much! Everything else was great about the recipe and I would definitely make it again!

Wonderful as is, or even better with scallops, for a special dinner. For weeknight for the family I increase the pasta to 1 lb, leave cream, butter and cheese as called for and add enough milk to make desired consistancy (have to watch the fat a little).

I thought this was pretty good although I got mixed reviews from my eaters. It really makes the sauce to add fresh parm and lots of fresh pepper. I also added sauted shrimp and minced garlic, etc. so I suppose I "tweeked" it a bit. I think it all depends if you like a thick sauce or not, because it is a thinner one. Which by the way is how most sauces are in Italy.

We have made this many times to rave reviews. It's one of our favorite dishes--with lots of freshly ground black pepper! I plan on making this for Valentine's Day this year. This is the classic alfredo sauce; if you put in garlic or nutmeg, it ceases to be alfredo sauce. It is essential to use freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese--powdered parmesan will give awful results--and real heavy (also called whipping) cream (at least 35% butterfat). In a simple dish like this, it is the quality of the ingredients that make or break the meal. To "A Cook from Chicago," a white sauce (aka béchamel) is made with a roux of flour and butter with milk whisked in and is in no way the same thing as an alfredo sauce. A white sauce to which cheese has been added is called a mornay sauce.

Served it for a dinner party I hosted for some of the other executives at my husband's company - and had several requests for the recipe. The one drawback is with all the butter, heavy cream and cheese - it's pretty much a heart attack on noodles, so not a dish I can health conscientously make very often. Which is a shame because it was so tasty!

Excellent for time spent preparing, although I did make some alterations as suggested by previous reviewers. I sauteed mushrooms, added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1 1/2 tsp minced garlic.

A very simple version of this classic dish. However, both garlic (minced) and nutmeg (fresh grated) are necessary. Also, I jazzed it up a bit by marinading a couple boneless chicken breasts in some store bought italian dressing for an hour, then grilled them and sliced fairly thinly and placed on the pasta. Shrimp, sauteed in a little white wine and olive oil would also be a nice addition.
