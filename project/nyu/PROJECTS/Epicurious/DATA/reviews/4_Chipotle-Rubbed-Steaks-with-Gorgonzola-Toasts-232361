Have made twice, both times with flat iron steak. Let rub sit on meat 2-3 hours. Excellent flavor. Gorgonzola toast is great. Definitely a keeper.

Folks, you gotta age the beef a couple days prior to day of. It makes all the difference in the world. Age the good stuff & u will see beef in a new light. Even the butcher turned chemist from Midland enjoyed this!

excellent! really tasty on all fronts. my toasts did not come out looking like the photo AT ALL (they weren't as crisp and the cheese was more lumpy), but were delicious anyway!

Seems like a fairly simple recipe but ends up being fantastic. The flavor contrasts are awesome - add a glass (or two) of a nice Malbec to make it even better! Used ground cumin and substituted country Italian loaf but otherwise followed to the letter and was very happy.

This was easy and great! I used a Country Italian loaf instead of ciabatta and it turned out great. I served it with the Corn Mague Choux (also on this site) and the flavors were great!

The rub for the steaks is great. I've also substituted pimenton de la vera and crushed red pepper for the paprika and chipotles.

This was absolutely delicious. I think it is necessary to use the chipotle powder and not substitute that for anything. The combo of spicy steak and tangy, cool gorgonzola was unbeatable. We made this for friends for our first barbeque of the season and served it with a nice green salad. With the ciabatta bread you do not need to have potato or any other starchy side dish. Highly recommended!

I really like this recipe. The rub is simple and unique. And the gorgonzola toasts are fantastic!

Everyone loved the gorgonzola toasts with the steak. The steaks with the rub (without the toasts) are okay, but there are other rubs that are better.

The toasts are great on their own but sublime with the spiced steak. A great summer dinner with grilled asparagus and a basil tomato salad.

My husband has not stopped gushing about this since I made it---he says it's the best steak recipe EVER! I was pretty impressed myself. I followed the recipe exactly and used ribeyes steaks. A definite keeper!

Just delicious! And happily, chipotle powder or seasoning (salt and stuff added) is readily available. I liberally sprinkled on the seasoning instead of rolling the meat in it (some friends don't like it too spicy hot). I did not have the "creamy" gorgonzola but it is not needed. I just crumbled regular gorgonzola and spread it on the bread as it's pretty soft anyway. To save a step, I grilled the bread on both sides first before adding the cheese. It's unnecessary to bring it back to the grill to melt the cheese. Just slap the hot steak on the prepared bread and go nuts. I always use the "steak lover's steak" which is prime sirloin. I sliced it after grilling and laid it over the bread pieces. If chiabata is not available, a good round, rustic "country Italian" loaf, sliced into 1/2 inch slices, will work too. The components of this dish are so made for each other.

This is whith out a doubt the best steak I have ever had. I work in a specialty food store and used this recipe for a cooking demonstration and we still have customers asking about it! I definitely will make this recipe again. Served steak with grilled white asparagus drizzled with truffle infused olive oil and sprinkled with fresh ground salt and pepper and fresh thyme.

Awesome Steak! Used chili powder and a pinch of cayenne. Also used a 1 1/2" club steak. No chibata either or creamy gorgonzola. Used chicago hard rolls and smoked rambol (forest).

This is good. I would make it again - very easy. I didn't have any chipotle pepper in the house so I used crushed red pepper - nice kick all the same. I couldn't find any creamy gorgonzola so I just sprinked the bread with gorgonzola and spread it after it had softened from the grill.

Unbelievably delicious! Used chipotle powder. Grilled over hardwood charcoal.

Great, easy recipe. I could not find chipotle spice, so I used regular chile powder instead and cut up chipotle peppers in adobe sauce and added it to the rub. It helped add the touch of smokiness we were looking for.

Made some subs in the spice rub for the steaks, so it wasn't overly spicy for us. Have made something similar to the Gorgonzola Toasts before, and they are, as always, delicious. Check out a more complete review on my blog: http://sweetnicks.blogspot.com.

This was a great dish for a busy week night. The steak has quite a kick, but loads of flavor. We will use this again.
