I made these for the first night of Hanukah and loved them. My family, which does not typically consist of parsnip eaters, also loved them. I doubled the recipe and used 3 eggs as it seemed from other reviews, that it might help them to hold up better. Mine held up well-- I think it helps to make sure you really squeeze out the liquid in the pears, and that you use enough oil to coat the pan. Unfortunately, though I generally prefer to cook low-fat, it ends up making more of a mess when you're making latkes-- enough oil can make the difference in keeping them together and preventing the house from smelling for the rest of the week.

I skipped the celery leaves & used regular breadcrumbs and these turned out delicious. They didn't stay together very well, though, so I would recommend making them like hash-browns. The sauce (again, sans-celery leaves) was DELICIOUS and incredibly simple: sour cream with horseradish to taste. EDIT: I made these a second time and for whatever reason they just didn't brown. Then they were flavorless and disappointing - thus, browning is CRUCIAL for good taste!

These are delicious! I tripled the recipe for a party and added an extra egg. Otherwise followed the recipe. They might just rival the sweet potato latkes in popularity.

These are an interesting twist on traditional latkes. The combination of parsnips and pears is an interesting mix, given just the right kick by the horseradish. The only problem is that I couldn't stop eating them!

these are delicious, and not that difficult. i made them two nights ahead, froze them, and reheated them on a wire rack on top of a cookie sheet. i served them as an appetizer at thanksgiving, and everyone (twelve adults and three children) LOVED them.
