This is a great recipe with a few modifications. I lightly salted the carrots after removing the tray from the oven and I added 1/8 teaspoon more chili powder to the jicama. If you are sticking with the creamy basil dressing, go for a bit extra garlic for some bite.

I had high hopes for this salad. I felt the roasted carrots would give it dimention. It might be better with a different salad dressing but as it is not very exciting.

We're on a diet and this recipe was delicious and satisfying. The soft-sweetness of the roasted carrots complimented the crisp-spiciness of the jicama. The dressing was great!! Flavorful, fat- free and only 8 calories.

I served this salad at a healthful after-the-holidays dinner and my guests really seemed to enjoy it. Figs are out of season, so I used slices of kiwi and Cava orange. Note: The jicama can be prepared even more hours in advance if kept in ice water and dried before assembling the salad. I really liked the lime and chili but added less chli powder than was called for.
