Just a question. Did either reviewer actually use the Ceour form? the instructions ask for 3 forms but the recipe claims to serve 6?? Half the charm of this type of dish is the heart presentaion.

This recipe is a keeper. I was looking for a recipe to use smoked salmon in an appetizer, and I piped the salmon mixture onto cucumber slices and garnished with fresh dill sprigs. Delicious, easy and very impressive. I used wild sockeye smoked salmon so the color was very deep. I plan to also try this on endive leaves, daikon slices, etc.

Made this as part of a hors d'oeuvres table for my mother's Easter party. So good! I'd recommend using a food processor instead of a blender to make it easier to scrape the curd mixture into a bowl.
