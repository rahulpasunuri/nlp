I actually accidentally went the opposite of what the others have done and my family loved it. I put this together on Christmas eve for Christmas day brunch. Just as a time saver I used ground pork with the chopped bacon but thought I'd followed the recipe to a "T" otherwise. As I put the first 4 patties in the frying pan Christmas morning I looked on the counter and there was my unopened bottle of red pepper sauce. Hmm...too late now. After hoping the rest of the brunch would cover for the mistake I started getting compliments on how the mild flavor was a great contrast to most spicy sausages. Definitely not saying it wouldn't have been great with the extra heat added but give it a try without it. I think you'll find it an interesting variation.

Very tasty. Nice change from traditionally greasy sausage.

Yum. I didn't actually make the pork into sausage patties, but used the spice combination in a stir-fry. Slivered pork chops, onions, fresh snipped sage, cumin, and the key, a dash of nutmeg. I served this with slow baked cinnamon sweet potatoes and brussel sprouts. The spice combination is soooo unique and savory.

Great stuff--this recipe has become a brunch staple for us. I am generous with the hot pepper sauce and no one has complained.

I made them the night before and warmed them in the oven the next morning. I think these would be improved with a little more maple flavor, a little less sage.

Not the most exciting of sausage recipes but quick and easy for breakfast.

I loved this recipe and the only change that I made was the addition of ground cheyanne pepper to kick up the spice. Outstanding!

These were very easy and tasty, but the splattering made quite a mess.

Very easy to make. I made it the night before and fried the sausages right before the egg dish was ready. Received compliments from everyone that ate the sausages.
