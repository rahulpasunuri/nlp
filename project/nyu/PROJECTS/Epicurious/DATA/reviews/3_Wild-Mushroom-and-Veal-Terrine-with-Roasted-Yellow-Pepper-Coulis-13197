I am a student at Scottsdale Culinary Institue in Scottsdale, AZ. I prepared this terrine for our Grand Buffet. After cooking the terrine, I glazed the slices with a flavored aspic. I also sliced the wild mushrooms instead of chopping. When sliced and glazed, the intricate patterns of the mushrooms really stood out. I soaked the dried mushrooms to reconstitue them and saved the water. I then made aspic out of the water and cut it into stars and circles to decorate my terrine. My instructor and fellow students thought it was beautiful! My instructor also said the terrine was what you would see in a gourmet instructional book. Many, many compliments on the visual aspect as well as the flavor! Thank you so much!

I prefer the coulis made with roasted red peppers. Try it as a delicious pasta sauce( with sauteed mushrooms, asparagus and parmesan!)
