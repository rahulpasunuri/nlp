I thought the meal was good. I seasoned the meat before glazing it. I used a little white pepper and ground corinader. I did not have white wine vinegar on h.eand and used red. Still came out fine. The best part was the mustard sauce. Definitely will use this on other entrees.

This recipe was actually pretty bland and unimpressive.

This was surprisingly delicious! I had never bought smoked pork chops before because I never knew what to do with them. This was SO EASY, I'll definately be buying them again soon. The kids loved the mustard sauce and it would work well with many other dishes. Served with garlic mashed potatoes. YUM!
