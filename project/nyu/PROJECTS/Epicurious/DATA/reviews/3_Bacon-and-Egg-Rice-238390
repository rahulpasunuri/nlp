Easy, quick, and a great weekday dinner. Highly recommend adding a bit of rice wine vinegar at the end (not much, just a splash or two) -- adds some depth that seems to be missing otherwise. I also didn't use as much bacon or bacon fat, and it was fine.

this is one of my favorite go-to recipes- especially when we are feeling a mite peckish late in the evening - use microwave bacon, or add any chopped vegetable for variety, or substitute frozen peas for the eggs. its a great foundation recipe. i make extra rice now and freeze for future snacking...

This is a delicious and easy pantry recipe. Filling and flavorful and very versatile. The family raved about it.

Well I've been trying to find a recipe for Kylie Kwong's fried rice forever (I was too cheap to pay 60.00 for the cook book). This recipe is this closest I've found. I will always use leftover rice--that's what a recipe like this is about, only 2-3 cups cooked. And for sure soja sauce is a really good addition; I would say imperative. And you know what? It's not so much fat--I used olive oil and pancetta and it was great and it really makes a lot.

Made this for the first time last week. Tastes great. I would add a little spice to the recipe to liven it up a little. Try some additional sesame oil or add some Goya seasoning to give it a little more depth.

This dish is a great change of pace for the morning. Like any "fried" rice, you can add whatever vegetables you'd like, or hide vegetables, as it the case with my 4-year-old--who would rate the dish 4 forks as he'll eat breakfast at any time of the day. I adapted it to make only one serving for him, using one slice of bacon and one egg. Also, I like to use previously cooked brown rice that I keep in the freezer, which cuts the preparation time. It's amazing what a touch of sesame oil will do to tie a dish together.

Too much fat. it takes very little fat (bacon fat) to flavor and stop the rice from sticking. Try only two tablespoons of bacon fat should be as flavorful.

This is an awsome recipe. I like the flavor I added cilantro at the end and also some soy sauce.
