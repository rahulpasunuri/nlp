It was very good, though I would add extra thyme and onions and chop up the chestnuts next time.

This recipe is fantastic! I make it as a side dish on Christmas. It goes wonderful with the beef wellington I make. The first time I made it, I tried to roast and shell the nuts myself--too difficult. I used the prepared nuts now. You can get them at specialty stores like Williams Sonoma. It really is a special treat!

I thought this was a great recipe and would be a quick side dish with out the nuts. I would also think using another meaty nut would be good too.
