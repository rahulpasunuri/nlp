I made the recipe as written except I didn't have any half and half so used whole milk. I thought the topping was a little dry and bland, so it may have benefitted from the higher fat in the half and half. The filling was delicious and I loved the bourbon! I might make it again with the same filling and a crunchy topping.

This was tasty and I liked the crust very much, but I think the bourbon was wasted on this dish. Based on other reviews, I cut back the bourbon in the crust which was a mistake. I had a large asian pear on hand that I used with some frozen blackberries to make half of this recipe. I would recommend slicing the pears thinner 1/3" as mine were a bit firm after cooking. I would also put a bit more liquid in the crust to make it easier to spread. The blackberries added a wonderfull color and flavor. It was actually better the next day and reheated well in the microwave - gently on a reduced power setting.

This was quite simple and tasty....I switched the Bourbon for Black Strap Rum (gives a molasses flavor w/rum) and doubled the amount of the Rum & Butter, as well as added sweeten dried cranberries... big rave reviews with this...

I didn't do the full cobbler part, but I made the filling to incorporate into another recipe, and I was licking the bowl! OUTSTANDING. The filling alone is indeed pretty bourbon spiked, so I can see where lessoning the bourbon in the topping would be necessary. This one's a YUM!!

Used fresh pears fromour trees and spiced rum. Very nice combo. Served it with vanilla ice cream. A hit.

Excellent recipe. I used my favorite bourbon, Woodford Reserve. I didn't think it was too strong, but then again I do enjoy my bourbon. The topping was very scone-like, as one reviewer mentioned already. It tasted good, but it was a different texture than I'm used to in a cobbler. Lastly, I didn't have half and half, so I used buttermilk, and it tasted really good. We have 5 pear trees and I am always on the hunt for ways to use them up. This will be a favorite as long as my trees are puttin' out.

I absolutely loved everything about this recipe! I used Jim Beam Black Bourbon Whiskey and it came out just fine---as long as I ate it cold I couldn't taste the alcohol, just that nice bourbon sweetness. The strong alcohol taste that people are getting definitely has to do with which bourbon they are using. The Jim Beam Black was very similar in taste to Jack Daniels (just cheaper). Another Bourbon that may be good in it is Blanton's. I think I may try this recipe again using peaches and cognac... Just a thought...

This recipe was a hit! I used Famous Grouse whiskey and it was quite mild on the over all flavor. Per another cook's suggestion, I also added fresh blackberies, adding to the variety of texture and flavor.

WAY too much booze. i used southern comfort cuz we didnt have bourbon, but the booze taste was overwhelming.

Having no Bourbon, I substituted dark rum and detected none of the overwhelming flavor described by the cook from New Orleans. Perhaps it had to be Bourbon. Anyway, it might have helped a rather bland dish.

The basic filling and dough were okay. It was a good way to use up a lot of pears. But I thought the bourbon flavor was overwhelming.

Very Yummy. I threw in a handful of frozen blackberries. Quite good.

Wonderful!! I halved the recipe and cooked in 8x8 dish and it did fine. I will definitely use this one again.

One word: Wow!

Very good. I liked the idea of partially cooking the pears/cobbler prior to the addition of the cobbler dough -- it produces a firmer, drier cobbler bread that I thought was good. Of course, I had to sass it up a bit with spices by adding a touch of cinnamon, clove, etc. to the pear mixture.

Ab-Fab (Absolutely Fabulous).

The topping was too "doughy". I would have liked it sweeter and crunchier. Heavy on the bourbon too.

It is fabulous! I received a box of pears from Harry and David as a gift. We couldn't eat them fast enough, so I used this recipe and WOW!

This is fantastic and was quite a hit at our Thanksgiving celebration last year. A nice change from pumpkin pie, and less work!

Fabulous thick scone-like topping. I made this for a potluck, the ladies mostly loved it, the only complaint was it had too much bourbon. I followed the recipe, but next time I'd ease up on the liquor, if serving to others. I didn't mind the alcohol :)
