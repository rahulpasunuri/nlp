This recipe should have been better than it was. It also seemed under salted and the tomatoes did not add the kick it should have. Should the tomatoes have been doubled? For all the work, the results just weren't there.

I found this recipe in July when I searched for ingredients already in my pantry. I had purchased 2 bone in pork chops that day. This recipe gave me an idea--- I sautéed onion in just a little olive oil, sweated them with the lid on the dutch oven. I thought I didnt have enough pork so I diced some pancetta and threw that in. then added garlic, about 3/4 of a larger can of diced tomatoes, some Penzeys adobo seasoning, some crushed red pepper, and fresh rosemary, and dried oregano, and 2 cans of drained and rinsed garbanzo beans. Then I browned the pork chops, buried them in the bottom of the pot and then baked it in the oven with the lid on. I had it on 375 because I was planning to bake something else..but then turned the temp down. Id prob do a slower oven..like 300-325 for a longer period next time. This was great with rice and if you made it spicy you can cool it down with some plain yogurt. I put extra portions in the deep freeze and it reheated beautifully.

I agree with Marcie from NYC - this recipe is extremely bland as is. I, too, had to keep adding more seasoning. Once I finally had enough flavor, it was good. Beware, this recipe makes a HUGE amount of stew. It's rather time consuming - cutting up the pork took the most time. A pork shoulder has a lot of fat and it needs to be trimmed. If you reheat it, I would thin it out with chicken broth to add more flavor. It becomes very thick once it cools. It's very filling and would be a nice winter meal. Watch your tomatoes - they do cook much more quickly then the recipe indicates. Also, line your sheet pan with foil - the sugar combined with the olive oil will leave a black crust which is difficult to clean if you don't watch your tomatoes closely (like I did).

I made a half recipe, and couldn't get ahold of any cherry tomatoes, so subbed canned fire-roasted crushed tomatoes. The pork shoulder I used was a little fatty, not easy to trim, and I had to pull out each of the pork pieces once they were cooked and remove the fat. That was a bit time-consuming, but the result was worth it. Good comfort food.

I really like the combination of the pork and cannellini, especially the the sweet roasted tomatoes. However, I am afraid that the recipe as is would yield rather bland results. I seasoned the pork with salt, pepper, garlic powder, dried oregano, and red pepper flakes and browned in olive oil in batches to get a nice brown base for the broth. I deglazed the pan with white wine before returning the pork and adding water. From there I followed the recipe, except doubled the rosemary. After adding the beans and cooking, I found it was still a bit bland, so spiked it with a bit of smoked paprika. Even after all this, it was still a bit bland. I will try this again, but will be very liberal with the seasoning - it has a lot of beans to cover! The tomatoes were great, but mine were done after only 20 minutes. Also, I would recommend doubling the tomatoes to about 3 lbs (approx 5 pints).

Surprisingly easy, flavorful stew, perfect for a snowy day. I made a half-batch for two and there was plenty left over. Next time I will use less parsley and more tomatoes.
