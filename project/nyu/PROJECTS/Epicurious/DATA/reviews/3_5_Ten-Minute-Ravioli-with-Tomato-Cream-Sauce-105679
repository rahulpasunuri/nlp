This was not good at all! I followed the recipe exactly and I love taragon but the tarragon does not go well with the cream sauce. Basil would have been much better. I think if you followed the other reviewers' suggestion about using basil and canned tomatoes and it would be an alright quick cream sauce.

With some tweeking this was a lovely dish. After reading other reviews, I decided to add onion, used basil instead of tarragon. I used 1 14oz can diced tomatoes, instead of fresh. And lastly I used 1/2 cup, each, white wine and heavy cream. This was a lovely sauce and went perfectly with the spinach cheese ravioli I purchased to use in this dish. I high recommend this recipe.

we did that recipe with dried tarragon and dried Mint we also used 1/2 cup of vinegar instead of the wine and doubled the cream. It was exceptional, colorful and just perfect.

I was in a hurry to find a sauce for Trader Joe's Portabello Mushroom Ravioli tonight. I was cooking for two and after reading the reviews decided to use just 1 can of drained seasoned diced tomatoes and 2 TB. of fresh basil. I cut the other ingredients in half and I substituted fat-free half & half and red wine, but thought it was still very good especially for a meal that took less than 15 minutes to prepare . It was the perfect amount for two hungry adults.

I made this dish over the weekend with some lobster ravioli that I picked up at the grocery store because I wanted a creamy tomato sauce. I did tweak it a little bit. To start, I sauteed onions before adding the 6 cloves of garlic in pepper olive oil. Following others' suggestions, I used 1/2 cup of both the cream and the white wine. I subbed basil for the tarragon because I dislike tarragon. I also used canned diced tomatoes because the fresh ones at the grocery store didn't look so hot. At the end, I added some bay scallops that I had in the refrigerator (~2 handfuls).

Pretty good, however, a little too saucy.

Even after simmering, this tasted too acidic. I'll try again, with 1/2 cup each of wine and cream -- that sounds better proportioned to me. I love both tarragon and basil, so either would make me happy.

I had tons of tomatoes from the garden and I had some dried ravioli on hand so thought I would give it a try. I followed the recipe except used basil instead. But after all the effort I thought it was rather bland. It needs some help and if I made it again I would alter it. Perhaps it was the wrong type of white wine...

Made this with a friend last night and used basil instead of tarragon. After the sauce was done per the recipe we sat and drank wine for 30 minutes and let it simmer all that time. We also par-cooked the ravioli and then finished it in the tomato sauce, so our sauce was not too thin. You still need bowls, not plates to serve this dish, it is not a thick sauce. We found it to be scrumptious and I immediately downloaded a copy of the recipe to take home. Loved it!

A thousand apologies for my previous -- and erroneous -- advice! A mouli mill will *not* remove tomato seeds. It is best for tomato puree, hence not ideal for this terrific recipe at all. I halved the ingredients and substituted basil for tarragon as, like many of the other cooks wrote, I dislike its intense flavour.

Anyone having trouble de-seeding fresh tomatoes might want to try a Mouli stainless steel food mill. Takes the bitter seeds and curly skins out with ease, leaving the tomato sauce as chunky as you desire (well, not terribly coarse), depending on the size of the straining disc you choose.

I think the overall taste of the dish was very good, however, I think I would prefer the sauce a wee bit thicker. I thought the amount of garlic was fine and I found the fresh tarragon very refreshing. As one other reviewer said, if you don't like tarragon, you just don't like it - can't be helped! I think basil would make a fine substitute. I also agree with many other reviewers that there is WAY more sauce than necessary for a 9 oz. package of ravioli. I made this for just me and the husband, so you can imagine how much sauce was left over. If I had all the kids at home, I'd double, if not triple, the amount of ravioli. All in all, I give it three forks, and would make it again...except thicker. One last note, the recipe implies that it's a ten minute recipe, the cook time is quick, but seeding and chopping two whole pounds of tomatoes took a bit of time! I may try some of the suggestions to use canned stewed tomatoes next time.

I made quite a few changes to this recipe and my family and I greatly enjoyed the results. First, I more than doubled the amount of ravioli. Also I substituted canned Italian style stewed tomatoes for the fresh ones. In place of the dry white wine I used alcohol-free white wine (which is less dry), and I used slightly less than the one-cup called for. Finally, I substituted fresh oregano for the fresh tarragon--since I like it better and that's what I had in the refrigerator. My kids loved it and the leftovers were quickly used up. I will make it again soon!

This is a flavorful, easy recipe. Fresh tarragon is a must. The sauce goes further than the ravioli, so cook extra ravioli.

Although this was not bad, it was rather bland. I should have used all six cloves of garlic--that sounded like garlic overload to me, so I only used four cloves, but the recipe can handle six. All in all, I much prefer the Herbed Walnut Ravioli (another recipe available on this site.)

I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome of this recipe. I took to heart what other reviewers recommended in tweeking the recipe and I attribute the tasty result to that. Thanks! I used 1/2 the wine and 2x the cream and added a little basil. Also, a large can of stewed tomatoes worked just fine in place of fresh ones. Some complained about the tarragon overload but I found it refrershing (i guess it all depends on if you like tarragon or not). And Fresh Spinach/Cheese ravioli worked great, too! Anyway, I'll certainly make this again and am looking forward to leftovers tonight! (it makes an awful lot of sauce).

This has been the best sauce recipe for me because I can make faster than I can boilthe water for pasta. And the flavor is what I really like.

I was quite diappointed with this recipe. I found the flavor overall lacking. I added Italian seasonings and red pepper to the sauce to juice it up a bit, which helped it out. Otherwise, just so so.

The sauce was great. I actually improvised it quite a bit, substituting a can of whole tomatoes for fresh ones because that's what I had on hand, and substituting Land O'Lakes Fat-Free Half and Half for the cream. I think next time I'll use about half the oil, and drain a little of the liquid off the tomatoes. But the tarragon is a wonderful and unusual touch. Yum!

Great dish! I used canned tomatoes and 32 oz of frozen four cheeses ravioli. I also tried to use half & half rather than cream which didn't give it the right texture. You have to use cream. The tarragon gives it a terrific flavor. I found fresh tarragon makes a big difference.

Although the sauce was tasty, I was disappointed by the texture... it was too runny and there was far too much sauce for the 9 oz. package of ravioli.

This dish was so easy and super quick.....I had seeded tomatoes on hand left over from a previous dinner. I would give it 2 and a half forks if I could. Really important to use fresh herbs. Great for a weeknight.

I thought that this was very mediocre for all the effort. The garlic was overpowering. Where in the heck did you get 10 minutes to complete this dish - it took me about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Please do yourselves a favor and don't bother with this one.

this is such a quick, easy dish! i actually doubled the amount of ravioli and i still had enough sauce. it's a good vegetarian recipe as well, so i make it for every occasion.

I just came across this recipe and while I didn't try it yet I made up something similar but even easier one night last week... I cut up a large onion and sauteed it in 1 tsp of butter in a nonstick pan with 1 tsp of sugar to caramelize. Then I added chopped fresh tomatoes (didn't bother to peel or seed) with some vegetable stock, garlic paste and fresh thyme. I served it over fresh artichoke ravioli - it was excellent and much lower fat than this recipe.

This was the first recipe I made when I got October's issue. I loved it, my husband loved it and when I made it again for my staff they loved it to! It is so easy and quick to make. Next time I am going to try adding chicken. If you like a tomato cream sauce this is the one!

I thought this dish was easy and delicious. I substituted chicken broth for the wine because I'm not old enough to buy it. This is a quick alternative to a canned sauce and tastes so much better.

this is an easy and delicious recipe. I've made it now three times and get rave reviews from my family. The tarragon is a good in it. I feel that adding basil is okay, but the tarragon makes it unique and not just another boring pasta dish.

This dish turned out great, and I've made it several times. The last time I made it, I tried something different, I grated the tomatoes instead of chopping, added less wine and more cream which definitely was an improvement to the sauce - it made it creamier and all around better.

Very disappointed with recipe as it reads. The tarragon killed any other flavor, stay away from this of you're not crazy about tarragon (if you're not sure, smell it. it tastes the same.) Second time I substituted basil and it was actually very nice, be careful with the oil or the sauce seperates and be sure to use fresh vine tomato if you can get (makes a big difference.) Great sauce if you play around with the flavors.

I loved this dish, and unlike the others, I used fresh tarrigon. It was even better the next day. I will serve this to company, in small quantity, as an appetizer. Fabulous! A cook in Escondido, CA

I really liked this recipe, it was sooo easy and I thought it was very tasty (the tarragon was great, a nice addition) Also I used canned diced tomatoes (rinsed and drained) Super easy.

We thought this recipe was very good! We did, however, use basil vs. tarragon. If you have the time, fresh ravioli are better, and seeding the tomatoes is very important. It's an awesome leftover dish as well. Our visitors loved it (vegetarians) and can't stop talking about this recipe.

This was just okay. I'll give it one more try using basil instead of the tarragon - which was a bit overpowering. It was, however very easy for weeknight cooking.
