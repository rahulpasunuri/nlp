Just had this for dinner - may be my favorite eggplant recipe ever. Our store doesn't have asian eggplant, so I had to use the regular purple variety, regardless... it was delicious. Can't wait to have again.

Do not fear Nam Plaa or fish sauce. You only use a bit and without it this recipe is no longer Thai. I followed the recipe exactly then gave the finished product to my Thai friends. They all cried out "aroi" (means delicious in Thai). My husband enjoyed the salad also. Full marks.

This is a wonderful starter for a Thai-themed meal. I cut the eggplants on too much of a diagonal, leaving thin edges susceptible to burning under the broiler. Next time, I would watch that. Like others, I started with less than the full amount of lime juice and fish sauce and adjusted to taste. This recipe is a fantastic, unusual sandwich filling with lettuce on whole-grain bread.

The flavors are exceptional. However, 7 japanese eggplants yielded only 2.5 cups of finished salad. We had to run to the market to get two regular eggplants at the last minute. The regular eggplants worked just fine, but the yield on this recipe is off. The eggplants really shrink down while cooking, and there is barely anything left. I would triple the recipe if I made it again. But it was indeed delicious.

I'm still wary of fish sauce, so I substituted soy sauce + ground shrimp paste (belacan), which worked well. It had the benefit of adding fishy-ness as well as some heat to the dish. Also, don't make the mistake of overdoing the sugar: although the sauce might taste a little tart, it mellows when mixed with the herbs and grilled eggplant. I'm looking forward to making this again.

Fantastic! I serve this with a couple of other asian faves: shrimp rolls in rice paper and mee grob. Definitely a keeper, although it may be a bit too piquant for some palates.

I have made this recipe three times now - it's quick and gets great reviews. And, oh did I mention its delicious and fresh tasting.

This is a delicious dish - so flavorful. I have prepared it so many times, that I had to specifically come back to rate it.

Excellent recipe, authentic thai taste and very easy to make. I used ordinary eggplant (aubergine) because I couldn't get the asian kind but it was still delicious. Makes a good light starter without rice.

Very good recipe. I have used fish sauce before so I cut back to 1 tablespoon-you can always add more-but 1 tablespoon seemed perfect. I also added more hot peppers and a touch more sugar. I served this with Chicken and Basil dish and had orange sherbet with almond cookies for dessert. The family loved it.

Though I use Asian eggplant (love them!) and chili peppers all the time, this taste was a bit too much in our neck of the woods. With all do respect, I am just beginning to introduce these flavors not only into my taste, but that of family and friends as well. Jasmine rice was a first and it had such a distinct and perfumey quality...I just think that this entire cuisine has an aquired taste. I pay a lot of attention to this rated section and I hope I haven't deterred anyone else from trying this recipe! I am simply going to introduce these flavors in a more subtle way from now on...a little bit at a time. HAPPY COOKING!

I served this for a Thai-themed dinner party and couldn't get past the smell. The guests who ate it thought it was good, but only half attempted it. It is very strong. I won't be making this again.

Excellent starter for a Thai meal. Watch the fish sauce. Probably would use slightly less next time.

Yum! This was so good! I included the mint and added an extra chile for some more heat. Served it with steamed jasmine rice and Penang curry for a thai dinner for 4.

I stir-fried the eggplant cut in cubes together with some diced onion, in a little oil. I omitted the mint because I did not have any in the house, increased the sugar to 1tsp and used dried chilli pepper flakes instead of fresh. It was still delicious!

This was a very good salad, but the dressing was, in my experience, very unusual for a Vietnamese sauce in that it called for only 1/4 teaspoon of sugar. It was extremely tart so I added 2-3 teaspoons of sugar, and also a little water to mellow it all out. I added an extra Thai (red bird chili, which made it extra hot, but that's personal taste.

Very tasty and easy to do. People who taste this for the first time seem to think the dish contains mushroom. I think the fish sauce does that. Try this on crackers too as appetizers. Excellent

Far outlived my expectations from reading the recipe. I had no cilentro, but did have fresh mint. Added one large jalapeno (no seeds but kept ribs). My husband hates mint, but he actually liked it, too. Definitely mouth-watering in more ways than one.

Perfect!! I kicked it up and used 2 Habaneros (We're chilli heads in this house) I will make this dish again!!!

This dish was great! It had a very classic Thai taste and as the recipe suggests goes well with a nice cold beer. A pumped up the heat a little more than was called for and it was just right for me. Also great with rice wrapped in lettuce.

I saw this recipe on epicurious on the discovery channel and made it without the written recipe, just from remmebering what they did. i used Thai chili sauce instead of a fresh chili, red oniion instead of shallot, a globe eggplant instead of Asian and no cilantro and IT WAS GREAT!! Oh yeah we rolled it in Romaine lettuce. Next time I'll try the real recipe, but it is a great taste and fun to eat.
