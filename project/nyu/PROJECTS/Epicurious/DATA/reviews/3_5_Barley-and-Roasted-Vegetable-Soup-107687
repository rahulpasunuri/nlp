I made this soup today for the first time and I love it. I did add more herbs than the recipe called for (some sage and rosemary),roasted a whole head of garlic,doubled the tomatoes,added 2 TBSP tomato paste,and tossed in 2 cups of chopped spinach and some green beans. Next time I will only use 2/3 cup barley and only puree 1/3 of the veggies. This soup is very satisfying and made more than 4 servings. YUM!!!!

This is a terrific soup! I thought it sounded bland but it is a keeper. I added parsnips - yummy! I found the dried mushrooms to not have much flavor to I tossed those. I never did the food processor because it was a terrific soup. I would've used a hand blender in place of that if I did.

I loved this soup--I've always been a fan of vegetable soups, but often find them un-filling and have to pair with substantial amounts of bread. The barley in this recipe makes the soup incredibly very hearty, and the mushrooms give it a great comfort food feeling. I'll definitely be making this again--perhaps with extra tomatoes and mushrooms next time.

This was really delicious -- I would definitely make it again. I did make some changes -- added swiss chard & spinach, changed the mushrooms to oyster, portobella, & shitake, and added fresh sage, savory, & rosemary in addition to the thyme. I used low sodium vegetable broth and didn't really add any extra salt (just black pepper & cayenne), and it was very flavorful. I didn't find it watery or bland at all.

I thought this was very tasty, with some modifications - more herbs and a whole head of garlic. Also, I only pureed the tomatoes and garlic, cooked the barley with them plus the broth, and then added the roasted veggies. It saved a lot of time, and retained the texture and colors of the veggies.

I make a lot of veggie soup. I usually roast whatever vegetable I'm going to use and because of that, this recipe makes a good soup. But as written, it is far too bland and watery. Doctor it up enough and it is good, but that is true with just about any soup.

I added more garlic and used dried morels in addition to the porcini. It needed additional broth but was very hearty. We all loved it, especially my vegetarian, soup-loving daughter.

In addition to being an incredible pain in the neck, this is a truly bland, forgettable soup.

This soup came out seeming like the usual vegetable soup, really nothing special. The roasted vegetables were so delicious straight out of the oven that I would have prefered to eat them as they were and not in the soup.

Fantastic soup! I quadrupled the recipe for a huge autumn party this weekend, and not a drop remained at the end. I pretty much followed the recipe as written, except for pureeing half the veggies straight out of the oven, and deglazing the roasting pans with red wine. A splash of red wine vinegar on top of each bowl before serving really brings out the best in it. Much easier than I expected after reading the other reviews!

Rating: 4
I can't believe I never reviewed this recipe. I've been making it since it came out. I will be making it again for a client tomorrow, and the red wine deglazing is a great idea which I will do. This is an absolutely fabulous soup, and more garlic is definitely a must. It's great because you can puree whatever vegetables someone doesn't care for and they won't know the difference! The roasting adds a great depth of flavor, and feel free to increase the herbs.

I followed Harvest Moon's advice almost exactly (Thanks!) except I used fresh instead of canned tomatoes, used Chicken Broth instead of veg, added spinach and a touch of cayenne. Easy, healthy and delicious!

I would definitely make this again. It has a rich flavor and a good mix of herbs for flavor. I would recommend cutting the barley to half a cup so that the soup doesn't become too thick.

I love anything smothered in olive oil and roasted, so I knew I would love this soup. I found that after roasting the vegetables they seemed fully cooked so I pureed all of the vegetables in 1/2 the broth and skipped the step of simmering the chopped vegetables for 20 minutes. I also cooked the barley separately in the other 1/2 broth and then added both together for a quick simmer. Also threw the garlic in the roasting pan for the final 25 minutes of roasting otherwise would have been burnt I'm sure, thanks to all the cooks for the great suggestions! Sure, the color is a bit unusual, but it tastes great.

This soup is good but I think it took me about 6 hours. I roasted the vegies 1 day and finished the soup the next. Everyone liked it but no one raved.

Rating: 4
I love this soup. I make it frequently, but I admit that it is time consuming. One thing I have found to make it go a bit faster is to use instant barley. It only takes 10 minutes to cook instead of 40. That way, when you combine the puree with the chopped vegetables and the remaining broth you only have to simmer it for 10 minutes to let the barley cook. It worked for me! I thought it tasted just as good as when I did it the more time consuming way.

Rating: 3
I really liked the thickness of the soup--more like a stew. I don't think it was too time consuming to roast veggies; definitely worth it. It is great the next day. An all around good soup to have.

This soup takes perfectly good veges and turns them into a bowl of mush. And it lacks flavor. If I were ever tempted to make this again, instead of pureeing half the veges, I would only puree the tomatoes and onions.

I really liked this soup.The roasted vegetables gave it a nice aroma and full flavor. It does come out a bit thick but that is easily remedied with a bit more vegetable stock. I cut preparation time by putting half the roasted veggies,canned tomato,olive oil,garlic,and a bit of stock into my blender.In the pot went the second half of veggies, herbs and seasonings. Combining them for a bit I then added the barley and that was it. So easy and not time consuming at all. I would reccomend cutting the veggies in the size you'd like to see in the finished product right from the start.Not difficult at all and very satisfying!

I was not a huge fan of this soup. It was too thick (even after adding water to thin it), and had an unpleasant brown color. The flavor was rich but I got sick of it after a bowl or two. I like my veggies less pureed and mushy.

Each time I make this I marvel at just how good it is. Substituted dried shitakes for the porcini, although used a porcini bouillion that I picked up in Florence, Italy, last year instead of the vegetable broth.

Used red wine instead of broth to degalze the roasting pan, which gave the broth a lot of depth. Pureed the entire soup b/c I like creamier, rather thank chunky soups. Can't wait to make w/ the dried mushrooms, which I dind't have on hand. Served with habanero cheese corn muffins.

I quadrupled the recipe for this soup to make for 25 people, and it was a big hit. However, by the bottom of the pot, the mixture was very thick, more like risotto than soup. I think I would use more broth in the future.

Perfect soup for a rainy, cold day. I used 1/2 cup barley based on other reviewers' comments and it was just the right consistency. 55 minutes was way too long to roast the veggies, as they started to get mushy. However, the flavor and texture of the finished soup was wonderful.

This soup was fantastic! I added butternut squash and parsnips to the list of vegetables which worked very well. Following the suggestions of previous reviewers, I waited to add the garlic to the roasting pan. I used a few extra bay leaves, some rosemary, oregano, and extra garlic. Also, I boiled the barley in only 4 cups of stock for only 25 minutes, added the puree & other veggies and let cool overnight to allow the flavors to absorb. Then added the remaining 2 cups of liquid as I reheated to serve. This worked out great and my family couldn't get enough!

This is a wonderful, flavorful, chewy, hearty soup...more like a stew, really. I made it almost exactly as it was written, but it took a bit more time for the vegetables to roast and the barley to cook than the recipe said. Also, I ran out of cooking liquid half way through cooking the barley and ended up adding almost a can and a half of low-salt chicken broth. And still, the soup is very, very thick. I think it would be great with a dollop of sour cream - I think I'll try that tomorrow! Plan on spending a good portion of your day attending to this soup, it takes a long time to make. But it is worth it!

Rating: 3
Delicious! I made this exactly as written. I roasted the vegetables on 2 pans; 1 with the garlic to make the stock with, 1 without to be chopped for later. This just saved a little time when getting them out of the oven and continuing. This was really rich and filling, perfect for a cozy winter dinner. I did about an extra cup of water to keep it from being too thick. This is even better if made a day ahead!

Rating: 3
I followed the recipe faithfully the first time, and thought it was too thick. The second time I prepared it, I reduced the barley to 3/4 C and added only about half the pureed vegetables to the stock. It worked! Also, I followed previous comments about the garlic and roasted it only about 35 minutes. Definately a keeper.

Rating: 4
I served this soup to a group of 6 women today and they all LOVED it and all wanted the recipe so you know they were not just being polite. It is very delicious, rich and filling, rather time- consuming to prepare but well worth the time. I added 4+ cups of vegetable broth so there was enough for 9 servings.

Rating: 3
Yum! Easily the richest vegetarian soup I've ever tasted. Made as directed but tossed the garlic cloves in the oven about halfway through based on another reviewer's warning. Came out perfect. The vegs did get more than brown around the edges but no harm done. I think the fact that the barley is cooked in the amazingly flavorful stock (mine was a gorgeous dark molasses color) really makes the dish -- don't do it while roasting the vegetables. The barley comes out tasting fabulously beefy. I definitely added a lot of water at the end -- it was VERY thick. I didn't feel the need to use stock because it was almost overpoweringly rich already.

Rating: 4
I have made this soup several times with vegetable broth, and each time I get rave reviews. I roast a whole bulb of garlic in a separate covered dish, though, as the cloves burned the first time I tried it. This way I have some extra for spreading on bread or to use in salad dressing. Well worth the time.

Rating: 4
This is the most amazing recipe on this sight. I have made it several times, without the barley (I wanted something lighter), and pureed all of the vegetables instead of leaving some chunkier pieces. It is worth every second of the time it takes to make it.

To the reviewer who wondered how to do this faster.. You could roast the veggies while the barley is cooking, and then use some of the broth poured off from the barley with the veggies to blend, then adding the blended mixture to the soup to finish it.

I have a friend who is going through chemo and can only get down liquids. So, I made this soup and pureed everything. I came out thick so I added lots more vegetable broth. She loved it and so did everyone else who tasted it.

Yes, the roasting does take time, but let me share a cook's secret. I roasted the vegetables for the soup along with other vegetables I was doing for a Roast Pork Loin side dish...that way I only did the time consuming part only one time. Two days later I made the soup and it was delicious. Roasting really truly adds a depth like nothing else!

This soup was very tasty. I don't own a blender so I just pureed some of it was my braun mixer. I also found soup was a little too thick so next I will cut down on the barley. It freezes well too.

Haven't made this yet - unnerved by the time it will take - but why is the pureeing step necessary? It seems to me you could cook the barley in stock while the veggies are roasting, throw them in for the last 20 mins and then use a hand blender to partially puree the soup. Ok, so you'd blend up a bit of barley too , but hey, I'm lazy (and busy). Interested to know if anyone considers all these steps important.

Rating: 4
Unfortunately, all the steps are necessary, but well worth your while. As an another reviewer said, the roasting really does make the soup. I didn't change a thing and was really pleased with the results! (Even though I ate it at 10 pm it took me so long!)

This soup was a delicious, hearty soup. I needed to add alot more broth the next day but beyond that I didn't touch the recipe. My husband raved about it!

Roasting the veggies sets this soup apart. I substituted canned plum tomatoes and much cheaper white button mushrooms, and tossed a few small, unpeeled red potatoes on the roasting sheet with the vegetables. I also added leftover chicken and used all chicken stock. If this recipe serves 4, they must mean 4 giants. I got 10 1-1/2 cup servings.

This was a good, hearty soup, and the roasting is a nice touch. It does take a long time, but it's easy to do the chopping and pureeing during the different stages of simmering, and even wash the dishes-- so the whole process is low-stress. The main change I would make next time would be to puree only about 1/4-1/3 of the roasted vegetables-- so much puree makes the soup look kind of muddy and the texture less interesting, especially since the pepper and zucchini and carrot are such pretty colors. This might also reduce the amount of extra liquid you need to think the soup out--I'd guess this was more like 8-10 servings. Still a good winter dish, though.

I agree it was time consuming to make but it was aromatic and the flavors were wonderful. It was a perfect meal to serve on one of our most frigid winter days.

Although time-consuming, I thought this was a delicious soup and well worth the effort. The roasted veggies give this a wonderful sweetness and the porcini mushrooms depth. I reduced the barley to 2/3 cup and increased the veggie stock to about 10 cups to make a "soupier" soup. I also thought that this made much more than four servings, at least with my variations, so the fat and calories are much reduced from what is listed here with the recipe.

Rating: 3
I did cut back in the barley. i wouldn't worry about the fat. It is the "good fat" and a moderate fat intake helps w/ weight loss. A nice bowl of this soup and a salad make a good, nutritious, and satisfying lunch or supper. Next time I will add some leftover potroast and use beef broth.

This was yum. I added cubes of rare beef tenderloin at the end, but it would have been great without. Will have again soon!

I thought this recipe was a great winter dish, and very rich even though I omitted the dried mushrooms. I do also agree w/another reviewer that this is more of a stew than a soup, but altogether very good. Next time I make it I will roast 1/2 of the veggies for only 1/2 as long, as I found that the veggies left chopped in the final product were quite mushy for my taste. I also use a few more vegetables, as I thought they were a little spare. With these changes this dish will be a knock-out. Ohh... and it's even tastier the next day when it's reheated.

I loved this soup. Thick and hearty. This recipe made more than 4 servings. I froze 1/2of it and still had 3 servings. After the first serving, I added some chopped ham. I won't make it again because......too many soups, so little time.

We love barley and we love roasted vegetables, but this recipe did almost nothing for us. Healthy and nutrritious, but there are far better soup recipes out there, I think. Also, I would recommend cutting the amount of barley down to one cup, otherwise the soup is way too thick. I had to add 3 cups of broth, and it was still thick.

For Linda from Martinez: 1 cup pearl barley has 700 calories and 2g fat (grains do have fat!) and 2 T. olive oil have 250 calories and 28g fat. So that's 237.5 calories and 7.5g fat per serving before factoring in the remaining ingredients. Vegetables are not noncaloric, especially ones high in sugar and/or starch, like carrots and tomatoes. I assume the remaining 2.5g fat is attributed to veggie broth that is not fat-free. The nutrition profile for this hearty, main-dish soup isn't bad, but it's not diet food.

Rating: 4
Outstanding. I used porcini/oyster/crimini mushrooms and substituted fat free chicken broth for the veg broth. I also used canned plum tomato. The juice from canned tomatos helped "loosen" texture of soup. Very full bodied and robust. I think the calories must come from the barley?

Rating: 4
Delicious soup, even my teenage son went back for seconds. I cooked the barley in 5 cups of the broth, with a bay leaf, while the veggies were roasting, to save time. I then cooked the veggies in only 2 cups of the broth, with the porcini, pureed per recipe and combined everything. Great meal with bread and salad!

Rating: 4
I loved this soup! The first time, I stuck to the recipe, except I had no vegetable broth to hand and so substituted home made chicken stock. One cup of barley made the soup too thick for my taste, so the next time I made it, I used only a half cup, and the result was most pleasing. A great dish to come in from the cold for.

I have not tried this recipe, but am concerned with the calorie content being 399 per serving plus 10 grams of fat. When looking at the ingredients, I am wondering were all of the fat grams are coming from? It looks like the only "fat" is coming from the 2 T of Olive Oil.

Just a quick tip. You'll probably want to rinse the dried porcini before adding it. Any dried wild mushrooms tend to still have grit and nasty stuff in it.

I also thought this soup was a fair amount of work, but delicious. Being a barley lover, I was impressed by the amount of barley called for - many recipes for soup with barley call for a lot less. In order to minimize the effort, the next time I make this soup, (I will divide the vegetables in half, roasting those that will go into the stock initially on one tray and those that wait on another - if nothing else, it will cut down on the effort of splitting up hot vegetable. I froze some of the soup and it freezes well. Upon reheating, I also added some hot sauce to a bowl and agree that the addition of some hot sauce was good.

Incredible soup! I simplified it considerably. After roasting the vegetables I put all of them in the pot together with the broth (I used chicken broth), dried mushrooms, thyme, and bay leaf. I simmered it for about half an hour, let it cool a little, then used a hand blender to puree it all right in the pot. I did not add any barley. Everybody raved about it!

Made this soup during the Blizzard of '03. Fairly time consuming with the roasting of the veggies, the pureeing, and the simmering, but definitely worth it. Followed the recipe almost directly, but added half chicken broth instead of all veggie broth. Might want to cut down on the barley a bit, as I had to add about 1-2 cups extra broth at the end to make it less stewlike. Also put in a bit of worchestire (sp?) and a little white wine. Red wine would be good in this, too. Roast some extra garlic when you make this, just to have on hand. Mmmmm. Good stuff.
