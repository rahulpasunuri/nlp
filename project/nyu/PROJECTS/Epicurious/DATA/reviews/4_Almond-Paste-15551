I think I approached this backwards. I found this recipe, got really excited about almond paste and started searching for recipes calling for it. I've made an Almond Cake from the Silver Spoon and almond cookies - both were fabulous!

Leftovers can be frozen for later use. A Dutch friend adds this to her apple pie - excellent addition!

I used some of the paste in the filling of a coconut almond fudge cheesecake. I got huge compliments from everyone who tried it-the texture was creamy and smooth.

Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. Over here commercial almond paste in not available, so this one came in the right moment.
