You can make these vegan very easy! Use whole plain soy milk (I get best results from Silk) and for every cup, stir in 1 Tsp of lemon juice. Let it curdle for at least 15 minutes. You can substitute white vinegar for lemon juice, but I do not prefer the resulting flavor. And, you do need to let the dough rise for at least an hour.

Angel biscuits are simple and glorious, but this recipe omits the instruction to let them sit for at least an hour so the yeast can do its magic. My recipe that I use every holiday includes an overnight stay in the refrigerator wrapped in a plastic bag. The perfect do-ahead.

These are very tasty! I've tried different recipes for biscuits, and the yeast imparted a good flavor here (although I doubt it helps with the rising much in this recipe). To jfire28 from Fort Worth, TX: Be careful not to twist when you cut the dough into round biscuit shapes. I use a glass cup, but if you twist, it seals the top and bottom of the dough.

Watch them closely. Mine burned very easily on the bottom. I'm sure they taste much better if the are not over cooked.

Okay, I've made this twice now - they taste wonderful, but never rise to the airy glory promised in the description. I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong or if the recipe isn't clear - should there be time allowed for the dough to rise? it doesn't say - but these aren't fluffy or angelic, just normal, very tasty buttermilk biscuits.

I agree, these didn't rise properly for me. Next time I'm going to try mixing the yeast with some warm water + sugar before adding it to the rest of the ingredients. Also, I tried baking all the biscuits at once, and all the ones on the bottom tray burned. Still, they seem worth making again - the taste of the non-burned biscuits was great, even if they didn't rise.

since when is buttermilk vegan?

Frankly, I'd give this recipe a 1/2 fork if I could. The biscuits just didn't rise properly. They tasted okay, but looked like flat dense hockey pucks. I tried to find "fine southern" flour, but couldn't so used AP. Maybe, I should have used AP self-rising flour. It was disappointing to add to our Thxsgiving meal. I should have just gone with the Pillsbury ones instead of making my own.

Made Angel Biscuits in my middle school HomeEc class, just don't remember using the yeast. Everything else is just the way I remember it though and they were incredibly light and delicious. I'll try this recipe the way it is written and without the yeast.

I'm sure the vegan feature does not work. I cook for my vegan friends and half the recipes have egg or dairy.

I have not tried this recipe, so I might be mis-using this section, but how can something that calls for buttermilk be rated as Vegan? Wrong.
