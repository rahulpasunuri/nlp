Super easy and delicious. I added a bit of lemon zest and gouda to the filling. Really easy dish for company.

4 forks. Yes, this was good. I used homegrown frozen chard instead of spinach and finely diced walnuts instead of pine nuts because that's what I had in the house, and it came out great. Made it in a 9 x 9" glass dish and the overhang from the phyllo dough covered about 2/3 of that. Cooked it a little longer, until it looked right. I brushed each phyllo sheet with butter and used more sheets than it called for (about 7 or 8) and less butter (about 3 T) and it was still very buttery.

I think 1/2 cup of pine nuts was too much and given how expensive they are it would have been just as good to use 1/4 cup. I also added leftover cooked chicken and 2 more eggs and made it in a springform pan. It worked great and was definitely tasty- I would make it again.

Disclaimers: I was afraid of working with phyllo so I took another reviewer's advice and used puff pastry and had no problems. I also didn't have a tart pan so just shaped it on a jelly roll pan. That said, I enjoyed this recipe a lot and so did my eating companion! The presentation is beautiful, the flavor and texture are great. I did add perhaps an additional third cup of cheese - goat cheese - and I added several garlic cloves because I love garlic. It took 30 minutes in my pretty well calibrated oven and came out perfect. While it's easy enough for a weeknight meal, I would make this for company for sure!

LOVED this. I did change it a bit because I wanted to use up what we had. Added some chopped, cooked bacon, only one package of spinach, and added some raisins. I also added a little red pepper flakes to offset the sweetness. SOOOO good.

I was looking for a recipe to use up all the spinach we've grown in the backyard. I picked two huge bowlfuls, and wilted the washed stemmed leaves in the microwave, then proceed to squeeze out the water and chop. Tip: remember to defrost the phyllo dough! I realized halfway through sauteeing the onions that the dough was still frozen. So luckily I had some puff pastry, and I used that instead. I used one layer on the bottom of an 8x8 pan, buttered it and sprinkled it with Parmesan, then spread the spinach mixture on top and sprinkled additional Parmesan. I sealed the tart with the second sheet of pastry dough. It baked longer -- like 40-45 minutes -- and it came out great. This recipe is a keeper!

Rich, warm and slightly sweet with the onions (I accidentally carmelized them-not a bad accident!), my Greek family loved it. I used the jelly roll pan, no need for a removable-side tart pan if you don't have it. I used about 10 sheets of Phyllo just to be sure it held its shape and instead of bread crumbs, I used leftover marzipan from dessert. Perfection! Wish I would have made more, it was so tasty.

Ok, once again, I made my own changes and I'm happy to say that it worked out beautifully. I wanted to make a larger serving (to have left-overs), so I used a 13"x9" casserole dish. With that said, I used an extra 10 oz. spinach, 3 eggs, 1 1/4 c. feta, 1/4 c. Parmesan, and 2 tbsp. bread crumbs in the filling. Because pine nuts are ridiculously expensive, I used toasted pecans. I also used puff pastry for the crust instead of phyllo, hence no buttering and cheesing between layers. I greased the dish with butter, put two pastry sheets on the bottom with the extra coming up the sides, added a little Parmesan on top, put in the filling, and put another pastry sheet on the top with the other pastry sheets folded over to make a full top crust. I then brushed the top crust with melted butter, sprinkled it with nutmeg, cut some decorative slits in the top, and then baked it at 375 for about 40 minutes. Absolutely fantastic! Rave reviews from everyone, including my anti-feta father. Based on previous review, served it with tomato/cucumber salad and tzatsiki recipe off this site. I can't wait to have left-overs. :)

Excellent recipe -- I used a ceramic rectangular dish with 2" depth and buttered it lightly. Instead of wrapping the phyllo under the pie and leaving the top open, I used 10 buttered sheets with Parmesan cut to fit the bottom, spread half of the mixture on that, then added 5 sheets, spread the remainder of the spinach, and topped the pie off with 10 sheets cut just larger than the dimensions of the dish (the sheets shrink a little when baking). This produced a nice layered effect and didn't take that much more time. I prefer a browned and crusty top to my spinach pie.

Really yummy! I made it on a weeknight after work, and the real time start to finish was about 45 mins. The highlights for me and my husband were the parmesan in the phyllo and the pine nuts in the pie. I was tempted to skip the pine nuts, based on another review (and on the price of them!), but I'm glad I didn't. Served with some sliced tomatoes and a side of spicy black beans, this one was definitely a keeper!

Lovely Summer recipe. Served it with a small green salad, and a cup of Roasted tomato soup (recipe found here); Bistro style. Subbed Leeks for onions, and swiss chard for spinach. used olive oil to layer phyllo with. The jelly roll pan was perfect. And although I left the hole in the center, my sheets were a little larger than needed, so instead of trimming, I just fluffed them around the edges, like you would with tissue paper in a gift bag, turned out very pretty:)

Truly lovely spinach pie recipe. I covered the top with more phyllo dough because I didn't relish the idea of it being an open pie. Also, my partner said the nuts are unnecessary. I agree, but they were nice enough. It turned out crunchy and sublimely rich with all the butter I painted the phyllo with.

I used beet greens as I'd just harvested a lot of them from the garden and used puff pastry instead of Phyllo. My Greek husband says its the best spinach pie he's ever had. Delicious.

This was very good. I used pistachios in place of the pine nuts. I also added some garlic to the onions. After buttering the turned-over phyllo dough, I sprinkled it with parmesan cheese, which gave it a nice flavor.

Real easy and tasty. Had extra phyllo so the next day i chopped up some broccoli, asparagus, leeks, shitake mushrooms, garlic and some cod (fried separately) and substituted this mixture for the spinach. It was actually much better than just spinach!!

Rather than messing around with phyllo dough, I made the filling and baked it between 2 ready-made frozen (and thawed) pie crusts...delicious!

Fantastic recipe. Pretty easy to make too. I left out the parmesan because I am allergic. I used butter spray in between the layers of phyllo and used 10 sheets. I was worried that it wouldn't be very exciting without the cheese, but it was great! Definitely will make again, especially when having vegetarians to dinner.

Yummmmm! I used a good cheddar in the crust instead of parmesan, because that's what I had, and I added some oregano. Left out the bread crumbs. Very nice and very easy.

I'm always on the lookout for a good spinach pie recipe and this one makes an excellent starting point. The overall proportions are really good. That said, I made a few changes (don't hate me!) and the next time I make this (and I will make it again), will make more. I used one pound of fresh spinach, lightly blanched and the excess moisture squeezed out of it. I only used 2 Tbsp olive oil to fry the chopped onion and that was plenty. I ultimately only used half the quantity of pine nuts and double the amount of feta. I added 2 Tbsp each of fresh dill and parsley and next time will add more. I made 4 individual pies, using 2 sheets of filo each, and cooked them for 30 minutes, which was 5 - 10 minutes too long. Lastly, putting this together reminded me of how much I loath working with filo - next time I will just use pie crust or puff pastry. I served it with a cuke/tomato salad.

So good, and so easy. I will definitely be making this again. Easy, and good to freeze too. When I am in a rush I just take one out of the freezer and warm it up. Great recipe.

I thought this recipe was ok. I've had much better spanikopita (which is basically what this is) so I'm going to beep looking for better recipes. In the interim, though, I'll use this one. Guests raved, hence the three forks.

This recipe turned out very, very nice! I made two at the same time - one to bring to a friend, and the other for me. The tart didn't travel very well, mostly because I wrapped it while still hot, but my friend was happy with it. I ate the second tart at room temperature, and it was delicious!

I used puff pastry sheets and made little pockets instead of a tart. It worked just fine. The only alteration I'd make is to use less olive oil when making the filling - it really didn't need that much. Very tasty!

I used fresh kale and gruyere, no bread crumbs, puff pastry, olive oil instead of butter and no Parmesan because I forgot! It was nice but probably next time I'd make it in a bigger pan so it's thinner.

I made this dish for the first time, and made the filling the night before. I added about 1/2 cup more feta, and a few more layers of phyllo. This dish was FANTASTIC! Even my sister (who hates spinach, and most vegetables really) finished her piece. I have never worked with phyllo before, but it could not have come out better. The tart came out beautiful. I felt like such a professional! The best part was the 20 minute prep time. Highly recommended. Only thing I would change, is that I recommend using a large sized tart pan, I used a smaller one than recommended, and the filling was a bit over powering- but I think I was the only one who thought so.

Rating: 4
I have made this dish for years and recommend that you not change a thing!!! I do use fresh baby spinach instead of frozen, but ... To the Cook from NY, what I have done to prep ahead is to make all the wet ingrediants (spinach, onions, feta, etc.) and put them in a zip bag. They are OK to keep overnight. Then I bake "a la moment."

This is one of the best dishes I've ever made -- even my 15-year-old, who hates spinach, loved it. Using some of the suggestions below, I used twice as much feta as the recipe called for (because that's how much I had) and 11 sheets of phyllo (for the same reason). It was simply superb.

Just wanted to answer "cook from NY"'s question--depends on how far ahead you want to cook them. If you cooked them a couple of hours ahead of time, they would be OK but I think anything beyond that would start to get soggy.

It sounds delicious! I haven't made it yet, but would love to get your opinions...can it be made ahead, then cut into smallish squares, and served as an hors'doeuvre at room temperature? Let me know what you think, friends.

Excellent. My husband and I both really enjoyed this. I don't have a tart pan so I folded the phyllo over the sides of the filling on a baking sheet, and it came out great.

This was delicious and the leftovers are just as good if you heat them in a toaster oven. I don't have a tart pan so I just folded the edges over the filling and baked on a cookie sheet. I used the suggestion to use butter spray instead of butter, so much easier than trying to brush melted butter on the phyllo(I always tear it).

Rating: 3
We all loved this, though next time I'd opt for more feta cheese as we found it was overwhelmed by the spinach. Couldn't get phyllo so used a pizza dough that I folded over into a half-circle after putting the spinach mixture in top. This went beautifully with a sundried tomato sauce pasta dish I made -- even my 5-year-old loved it and asked for seconds! A keeper.

absolutely yummy. only had a 7" round tart pan - it worked just fine, but had leftovers. so just did five layers of phyllo on a buttered cookie sheet and folded ends up to form a crust.

Very impressive and simple. I made this dish for the first time to serve with the turkey for Christmas. It was fabulous and a very beautiful addition to the buffet. My grocer's phyllo was smaller than the dimensions given in the recipe. I overlapped two sheets per layer and am happy to say that no one could tell.

Fantastic flavors! I added diced tomato and kalamata olives, and served it with a rich olive oil and balsamic vinegar on the side to drizzle. I also cut my phyllo into 3 inch squares before adding the topping. This way, each serving has that nice crispy edge. This dish is flawless, and even non-spinach eaters love it.

I love this recipe! My sister-in-law passed it on to me a few years ago & I've been making ever since. When I'm short on time (who isn't?) I substitute puff pastry dough for the phyllo dough. I always make it in a loaf pan because I love the way the round slices look. It's always a big hit!

Wow what a great simple recipe.It's making eating vegetables a joy. I added a little garlic and oregano and used fat free feta instead of full fat. Fat free feta tastes wretched by itself, but works in this dish. Everyone who has tried the recipe wants a copy of it it's so good. I've already made it twice and am going to take it as an appetizer to a party. I also used butter spray instead of butter on my phyllo sheets and that worked for my taste. Really the recipe tasted so great, I think more fat in it would have made it too rich.

I made this for friends and we all absolutely loved it. For a short ingredient list, it was surprisingly flavorful. It is truly one of the best recipes I've made in a long time. I did use some of the previous suggestions, using chopped pecans instead of pine nuts, fresh spinach, and increased the feta a bit.

Everyone loves this - make it often. I use more phyllo layers, less butter and add garlic, fresh herbs and chopped tomatoes. Using fresh baby spinach (chopped AFTER steaming and squeezing) improves texture of the filling.

This was great, and not too hard. I used a jellyroll pan and therefore did not fold the phyllo over the filling at all. Only change i would have made is to increase number of sheet of phyllo, maybe to about 10. Delicious filling!

wow, this was so yummy! i was actually just looking for a recipe to use up some phyllo sheets, but now it's more like i'll have to be buying more. i was kind of feta'd out, so i used a log of goat cheese (which i prefer anyways) and it was delicious! and i have tons of shelled pecans, so i used that in place of the pinenuts, although i love pine nuts. and i think i did more like 10 or 12 sheets of phyllo (because as i stated before, i was trying to use it up) layered on a half sheet pan rather than in a tart pan. this tart is very tasty and simple and rather impressive for the amount of work it (doesn't) take.

I used premade phyllo cups and the spinach and pine-nut recipe worked great as a filling. After filling the cups, I dusted the tops with parmesan cheese and baked at 375 degrees for about 20-30 minutes. The recipe easily made 60 appitizer size phyllo cups. Everyone raved!

Any thoughts on whether this filling would work as an hors d' oeuvre in premade phyllo cups? If so, would you precook, then fill and serve?

This recipe makes a delicious tart. The amount of feta was just right--it didn't overwhelm the tart and provided just enough flavor for some interest. I used a baking sheet, and the tart held its shape fine. Just remember to thaw your phyllo (I forgot and had to wait around).

In our circle of friends, everyone has a favorite appetizer. Whatever the event that we are getting together for, our friends ALWAYS request that I bring this...they love it, and it's always the first appetizer gone. However, it's VERY time-consuming to make...especially having to work with very touchy and fragile phyllo dough. It IS really tasty, and if you have the time to make it, I don't think you'll be sorry!

It was amazingly good for a dish with no garlic or other spices. We thought it had tons of flavor. And I could be wrong, but I think it would also make a great easy weeknight dinner if you put the filling into a premade pie crust, sprinkled it with parmesan and baked it.
