I wouldn't change a thing: everything just right. They're so light and fluffy and the slight tartness goes well with the fruit. I used apples, because that's what I had on hand, but I'm getting some cherries for this Saturday's round 2.

I come back to this recipe over and over, especially when cherries are in season. It's nice to make something a little different in the pancake family and this definitely fits the bill. I love the combination of flavors - lemon, cherry, and ricotta. I follow the recipe exactly for both the pancakes and the sauce and it pleases the family everytime.

Like many reviewers, I didn't make the sauce. The pancakes were delicious, filling but still light. I left out one of the egg yolks (because I ran out of eggs), and they were still great. The only downside was that my kids didn't like them, even when I covered them in jam. I think they're just a bit too different from regular pancakes.

Yum, didn't make the sauce (not cherry season), but the pancakes were fantastic.

Agree that the taste is similar to a blintz. Light and fluffy...but honestly, nothing special. Probably won't make again, as I'll continue to try new recipes.

Light and fluffy! Yum! I had to sub in some yogurt for cottage cheese, as well as a little whole wheat flour for white. Delish! I skipped the sauce though.

these were excellent alternative to regular pancakes - much more filling and full of protein and yummyness. They were easy to make as well and we will definitely be making them again - probably tommorow!

I made waffles instead of pancakes, and they were very good. Light and crispy, but the ricotta made them more substantial than my usual recipe. I didn't make the sauce. Important note: if this makes 16 pancakes, they must be very small ones! I only got 6 waffles (the thin kind, not the big belgian ones).

The pancakes are extremely fluffy with a smooth and mild ricotta cheese flavor. Almost tastes like blintzes. The cherry sauce was very good but not sweet enough so I added more brown sugar. I'm sure the cherries I used weren't the sweetest available but worked out well with added sugar. Everyone in my family, including the kids, commented how delicious and fluffy the pancakes were and the sauce was good enough not to use any maple syrup in addition. I would definitely make these again. Very impressive I must say!!
