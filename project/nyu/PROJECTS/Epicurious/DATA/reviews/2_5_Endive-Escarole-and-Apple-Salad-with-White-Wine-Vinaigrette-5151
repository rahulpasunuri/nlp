I have been making this for years, always to rave reviews but I agree that you must really reduce the wine

I have to agree with the cook from SF, I did not like the vinaigrette. The salad ingredients blended well but the dessing could have been better.

This is one of my (and my friends') favorite salads, and the dressing makes the difference! But you have to make sure that you boil it ALL the way down, as the recipe says. I have made this many times and everyone always loves it.

Don't bother making the vinaigrette unless you REALLY want to say you made the dressing yourself. It's not that good.
