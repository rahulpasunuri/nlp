The grown-ups at the table loved the spread, and the kids were happy to leave it alone and eat steak. (But what do I do with the leftover spread? Probably good just on crackers, as an hors d'oeuvre.)

I would make the spread, but I really think it would be much better on a char-grilled chicken! It was a good flavor, I'm just not convinced it "goes" with steak!

would not make this again. Much to salty and strong.

Interesting and complex flavors, however the spread overpowers the flavor of the beef.

Absolutely delicious! My husband wasn't too sure at first - but one taste and he was hooked!

The caper and olive spread was a delightful change!
