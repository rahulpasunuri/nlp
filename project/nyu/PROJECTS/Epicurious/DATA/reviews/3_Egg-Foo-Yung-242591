I served this to friends for a quick casual lunch, and everyone loved it.

The Egg Foo Yung is fairly standard. However, the sauce is too sweet and has the wrong favor tones. Forget the ketchup and vinegar, reduce the oyster sauce amount, and just use enough cornstarch to thicken the chicken broth. Better yet, make a sauce of 1 cup of chicken broth added to a roux of 1 Tbs flour and 1 Tbs butter, season with a little soy and sesame oil, with a pinch of pepper.

I would not make this again. I agree with the reviewer who said this was more like a frittata, and with the reviewer who said you need double the sauce. The sauce was too sour - leave out the ketchup or vinegar.

For my taste, I will leave out the ketchup next time.

This is not egg foo yung. An omelet or frittata maybe. The ketchup sauce was unpleasant.

I ordered chicken chow mein for my daughter- a conservative eater-with crispy noodles on the side, from our local Chinese take-out restaurant,but ended up with the chicken and veggies with no noodles. This recipe was a great way to repurpose the ingredients without wasting them, and the sauce plus the sesame oil in the eggs made it quite tasty. Even though the stir-fried ingredients in my original dish were slightly less than crispy, I added the chopped green onion bottoms at the last minute and a few handfuls of baby spinach leaves as we were getting ready to plate. The sauce is the final touch, and is quite good. This is a great, quick go to recipe for not too cooked leftover Asian food, dribs and drabs of stir fry veggies to use up, or great fresh veggies and herbs- and takes minutes to make. Better use of resources than driving to buy more carry-out, and able to be infinitely varied. I used only five eggs as there were just a stir fry container of Napa cabbage, chicken, onions and seemingly not much else, but even that was pretty good.

I had a craving for egg foo yung tonight. I made it as directed with the exception of the veggies. I used a red bell pepper for color and sweetness, I used more mushrooms than called for too. I also added some fresh sliced garlic. It made it so good!

Ok, but prolly won't make it again. B-friend liked the sauce, substituted sweet soy for oyster. substituted rice noodles for the bean sprouts and turkey bacon for the shrimp. Added napa cabbage too. we still at it in one sitting though, so i think it's a good base.

Very good. I felt the sauce was to tangy, next time I'll just make a quick gravy with chicken stock, cornstarch, soy suace, garlic, ginger, and scallions. This is a good healthy alternative to the fried stuff you find in the restaurants.

Horrible. Ended up throwing away the whole dinner. Very disappointed.

This has been a standard recipe in our house for years, and our version is remarkably similar to this one. We don't use the sauce in the recipe but rather one made of 2-1 kikoman soysauce and rice vinigar, a teaspon or less of sesame oil and some fresh minced scallions. We sprinkly dried korean hot pepper on top of the sauce and that's it. I never cook the bean sprouts, but just add them to the eggs. I sautee the mushrooms until they just begin to lose their liquid, then add the scallions, cook for 30 seconds, and put them both into the eggs. Cook the pancake until set and sprinkle crab meat on top and turn. Thats it -- hope my suggestions are useful

Sauce receipe is great (but I would double it). I simplified the egg foo young by using a drained can of Chinese stir fry vegetables (bean sprouts, baby corn, water chesnuts, bamboo shoots). The water chesnuts were key - added a little crunch. I just mixed the eggs and the veges all together and poured it into the skillet in small batches like pancakes. Thought it was very tasty! A good, quick weeknight meal.

I foget to mention that i also added the sprouts at the same time as the shrimp to keep them crisp! Enjoy

Quite nice. Followed relativly closely wich is rare for me. Added a little garlic, a pinch of heat Unstead of opening a can i used the shrimp shells to make a quick broth. I also was very happy with sauce, i don't use much in the way of ketchup but this turned out much better than the brown crap you'll get from your chinese restarant

This recipe turned out great! It was easy to make and my whole family enjoyed it. Next time, I'll make extra sauce.

Easy, delicious. Maybe not "authentic", but I dont want to deep fry eggs. I did add xtra sprouts at the end and flipped the omlette on a plate to brown both sides. My family loved it. I served it with brown rice and snow peas. Made a great meal.

Made 1/2 of this recipe last night. DELICIOUS, even though I subbed pre-cooked, seasoned, cut up chicken breast for the shrimp. Added the bean sprouts at the same time as the chicken and eggs (so that they wouldn't disintegrate). Can't wait to use shrimp!!!

Excellent. Made it exactly as recipe called for. Was a little leery of ketchup, but the sauce was great. I think I will enjoy it just as well without shrimp (vegetarian) or with pork or beef or chicken. Made sure I did not over cook the sprouts

Very east, very fast for a weeknight dinner when paired with a Thai-style salad. Thank goodness it's not the Amer- Chinese style Egg Foo Yung swimming in too much brown sauce. I cooked half the bean sprouts, then threw in the other half just before the eggs were nearly set. Next time I'll omit the ketchup & try sweet chile sauce.

We loved this, though what I did will make the Gourmet food editors cringe. I didn't have oyster sauce, so I used mirin, and while skeptical of anything that contains ketchup, I liked the sauce. I was out of shiitakes, so sauteed some rehydrated black fungus in their stead (used the liquid in my sauce rather than chicken broth), and sprinkled lots of slivered cilantro on top. Fast, easy, very tasty. It was part of a spontaneous lunch for 6 with stir-fry of the vegetables I had on hand, brown rice and fresh fruit crisp. This could work for brunch, lunch or dinner. Will make this again and again.

Good, easy. I used canned crab instead of shrimp & threw in extra veggies on hand, snap peas, etc. I also left the sprouts crisp. I left out ketchup in the sauce, and added a small squirt of sriracha.

Seriously, this was just awful! The first bite wasn't that bad, but it kept getting worse and worse. My husband and I both wanted to like it, but it was just like a fritatta gone bad. Either way, YUK!

The flavors of this dish are great, especially the sauce. I agree with the reviewer who said to put the sprouts in at the end for maximum crunch. I would also double the shrimp, but that's my own personal tastes. I made the mistake of chopping the shrimp too small - use the picture for reference on good sizing. Great light, filling meal that was still pretty healthy. I will definitely make it again.

This was delicious! Flavorful, pretty, easy... the sauce was perfect and the meal was delicious yet very light and healthy. I excluded mushrooms and I didn't have beansprouts, so I used julienned sugar snap peas instead - which added great texture. Wonderful as a lunch; I'll make it again!

This is not like Chinese take-out Egg Foo Yung and if you call it "frittata" it's still delicious. My husband and I both agree. The Sauce is perfect - much better than the usual restaurant-type brown goop. I did add a bit more crisp bean sprouts right before I poured on the egg. Do NOT overcook the sprouts, it's better if they're just warmed up with the mushrooms & scallions and not cooked initially with them- that's what I did anyway!

This disappointed. It was more of an Asian frittata than anything like egg foo yung. I thought the sauce tasted too much of ketchup and didn't help matters at all. My husband really liked this, but I found it very bland. I might make it again for him, but only if I have all the ingredients in the house as leftovers.
