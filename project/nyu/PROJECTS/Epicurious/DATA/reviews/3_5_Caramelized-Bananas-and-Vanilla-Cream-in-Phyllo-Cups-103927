Had same problem of cups burning before bananas caramelized therefore only rated 3 forks. Used 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla instead of bean and only 1 tsp of sugar under each layer. For the cups, I will cut the pastry down a lot more closer to the muffin tin to avoid burning again. Served with side van/choc. ice cream. Guests and hubby liked it - not too rich or sweet.

I was so disappointed in this recipe, especially after reading the raves by other reviewers. The main problem was that the edges of the phyllo cups burned before the bananas carmelized -- leaving me with vanilla pudding and sliced bananas, basically. I would not make this recipe again as written, but I will try again with a kitchen torch that I just purchased, especially in view of the other positive reviews.

I was really disappointed with this recipe until I broiled it. What once tasted like packaged vanilla pudding ended up blending really well with the bananas, etc., and a platter full of these pastries got sucked up at my party, to rave reviews. I was too lazy to do the phyllo, so I bought mini phyllo cups (24 to a pack)in the freezer dept. at the store. I baked them (unfilled) for a couple of minutes to ensure crispness, though technically, they're supposed to be ready fresh out of the box. They were so easy to eat in mini version. That's the way I'll do it again. People love finger food, and it worked well for our buffet set-up.

Everyone enjoyed this dessert & it looked really impressive served with some chocolate sauce and extra bananas decorating the plate.

This would be perfect for a dinner party because you can prepare everything in advance. It's impressive, and very tasty. I used my blowtorch to caramelize the bananas because I didn't have much luck with my broiler... just be careful not to be too blowtorch-happy and burn the puff pastry shells! :)

These are fabulous! Such an elegant dessert and one that can be prepared well in advance of serving. I served it with homemade chocolate ice cream - a bit rich but still wonderful. Next time I might try simply deocrating the plate with a little dark chocolate sauce in lieu of sorbet or ice cream. I also used only a teaspoon of sugar between the layers of phyllo - not the tablespoon suggested. It was plenty rich and sweet even with the modification to the sugar.
