I won't rate this because I used an equal weight of 5-inch mini-cukes. I followed the recipe, and the cukes came out very chewy - - I won't repeat that substitution. Just FYI.

We eat this without the lettuce, sometimes throwing in dill, a little dijon mustard, and serving it alongside baked salmon. Makes for a crisp feeling dinner, great in the spring and summer.

used Splenda, and actually left out the mustard, plus used cider vinegar..it was fantastic. Guess that's a whole new recipe!

Really good, but some tricks to make it work. Plan on using this recipe immed. after making. It will drain, and drain and drain...even after washing off the salt well. I too used no mustard and added the sesame seeds & red onions. Use very little salt. I thought delicious for summer. Served with bbq sandwiches.

I made this recipe exactly as given except I halved it. It was wonderflly refreshing on a hot summer night. I advise you to use the best mustard available as this will make the difference. Considered adding herbs but left them out. Result is simple, fresh and delicious.

I used dijon instead of grainy mustard for a little extra kick, added a little dill and did very fine slices of red onion. Fantastic--great salad to serve with baked salmon.

Very easy recipe. My husband loved it. I did not have any grainy mustard, so I substituted Dijon mustard. Like other reviewers, I rinsed the salt off.

I had a huge package of miniature cucumbers and this was a great way to use them up. Sliced them with a mandoline, as suggested, and followed the recipe for the marinade with the exception of the mustard--left that out, threw in some sliced red onion and some toasted sesame seeds and I liked the result. As others have already said, this is an incredibly easy dish to make.

Delicious! Made it twice. First time, I didn't let it marinate that long. 1/2 hour or so. Got rave reviews. Second time, I let it marinate overnight. That was too long. This salad is better fresher. And, the tip about rinsing the salt off is key.

As cucumber salads go, this one is delish. We skipped the lettuce entirely, though that would be good too. Entire family and guests loved it. No hassle and easy.

I made this as a last-minute salad. I actually only mixed up the cucumbers, dressing, and added some sliced onions (but did not serve on lettuce). My college-age sons ate it right up!

I love cucumbers and this was good. I had dijon mustard on hand, so it was pretty tangy, but still good. The leftovers got *really* tangy, so next time I might use non-dijon grainy mustard - or not have leftovers!

I've made this 3 times since I tried it because it's so utterly refreshing and delicious. It's the dressing that provides the zing. I didn't have seedless cucumbers, so I seeded regular cucumbers and used those. First time it was too salty, so I rinsed the cucumber slices before I dried them in a paper towel. Tossed with Boston lettuce, it's quick, simple and oh so tasty.
