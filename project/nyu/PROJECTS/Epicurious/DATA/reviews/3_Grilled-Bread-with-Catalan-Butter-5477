I followed the butter recipe as written, but instead of taking the time to grill the bread, I cut a long loaf of crusty bread in half and spread the butter over the two pieces. I broiled the bread and then sliced it to serve. It was wonderful. I also think it was important to use fresh rosemary instead of dried.

Oh, yes! Even though I hesitated to use anchovies, I made recipe exactly as printed. It is fabulous! The -10 wind chill got in the way of grilling the bread, so just used a good crusty loaf and served it fresh at room temp.

What an awesome spread! You don't even have to bother grilling the bread, I just serve it on fresh slices! It's delicious and unique, albeit a bit time consuming!

This is very delicious, I made this to accompany grilled chistorra this weekend and it was a smashing success!! I got a lot of requests for the recipe.

This has become one of our favorites, easy to make, different and delicious. It has been a hit this past summer with various guests. The key is the smoked toasted bread that really brings all the flavors together. When used on plain breads or crackers it's ok but it really lacks the pizazz that the smoke flavor on the bread brings.

I doubled the number of anchovies,and put all the ingredients down to the crushed red pepper in a blender,and blended until I liked the texture. I took a piece of French Bread,sliced it then put the butter between the slices, sticking the loaf back together. I wrapped the bread in foil and baked it in a hot oven,so that the bread toasted and soaked up the melted butter. A great time saver.

Loved the recipe but the outcome was disappointing. Seems to need something.
