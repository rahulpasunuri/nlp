I generally don't rate a recipe that I changed, but wanted to share this tip for those who don't like the slaw option. I agree it detracts. Try chopped nappa cabbage and shredded carrots. It makes a big difference and yields a more authentic dish.

I use lot of lime juice too - and leave it overnight

The spring rolls were delicious. My mother never had them and she love them. I will definitely make these again.

Overall, I liked the rolls and the dipping sauce. The mint and cilantro was a great addition to the otherwise flavorless slaw. Very easy to make.

Overall, I was a little disappointed in this recipe. The packaged coleslaw mix just didn't bring enough flavor.

I loved this recipe, the flavors were wonderful. I did add the cucumber and red bell pepper and would do that again for sure. I tried to make for a small party and it was a little tedious trying to roll these up at the last minute.

This was so easy and delicious.The rice paper only needs seconds otherwise is difficult to work with. Use warm water. A keeper for sure.

I made this recipe the same night I tried another Epicurious recipe (Thai summer rolls). We loved both of them. In addition to tasting great, they are so colorful they make a great presentation. Based on the reviews I did think I'd like the sauce, but I thought it was good. I only soaked the rice paper rounds for 5 seconds though, considerable less than the suggested 1 minute.

I make variations of this recipe regularly - cooked chicken shredded or sliced makes a good alternative, and any kind of greens works well. Bean sprouts also give nice crunch. I also like to use a peanut dipping sauce, either bought or whipped up by blending peanut butter, soya sauce, chili, garlic, etc. Also, the warmer your soaking liquid, the quicker it is assembling the rolls, providing you've already assembled all your ingredients and have them at the ready.

Horrible. The sauce takes the tasty hoisin taste from the originals and adds enough vinegar to make it thin and sour. The cabbage doesn't blend with the mint and cilantro, so those flavors are much too strong. These look like those delectable spring rolls with noodles and Hoisin inside, so every bite is a disappointment. The originals are just as simple, but taste good. I'd go for those every time. These were a real diappointment

We were having an Asian theme dinner and I wanted a light appetizer. I found the spring rolls in the Aug. issue and decided to try them. I added the cucumber and red pepper . I was happy this recipe called for fresh mint, as my garden is over-run with this great herb. I loved the great flavor mix of the fresh ingredients. I have made spring rolls before with noodles and they were alot more work than these. They took very little time and I made them several hours ahead of time. My guests loved them. I also made the dipping sauce and it went beautifully with the spring rolls. I also put out hoisin sauce as previous reviewers had done and that worked fine as well.

I have to disagree with the reviewer about the lack of flavor. Maybe you didn't use enough cilantro and mint, because that was the predominant flavor. I do agree with the other reviewer, however about the sauce. Did not like it at all. My husband dipped in plain hoisin and my son and I dipped in a combo of soy sauce, ginger, rice vinegar and brown sugar. I must say this was my first time using the spring roll wrappers and they were very easy to use. Found them at Cost Plus World Market. Make them small, they are easier to roll tightly. I am glad to have tried, this is one of those recipes you can tweak to your personal tastebuds.

Absolutely delicious! The rolls are very flavorful b/c of the mint and cilantro. The sauce was too spicy and not very flavorful. I prefer plain hoisin sauce to dip in. Instead of cucumber or bell pepper, I added a few strips of raw zucchini -- yum!

These have Absolutly NO flavor! We practically had to dround them in the hoisin sauce to taste anything. After making a few of the rolls I began to add sliced up red peppers, extra shrimp and a little sauce, but that still didnt help. The sauce is VERY good though!
