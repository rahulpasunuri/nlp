Would be 0 stars if I were allowed. This was one of the more vile desserts I have ever attempted to make. It smelled like household cleanser, may well have *tasted* like household cleanser, and did not set. We threw it out and ate stale cookies instead. You have been warned.

This recipe has great flavour and texture. I was hesitant about it, since I am not a watermelon fan, but it was a big hit with everyone!

this was pure jiggly watermelony goodness. I'm not sure what all the bad reveiws are about. Definitely bring the juice-corntarch mix to a full boil to help it thicken. I also added some lemon zest. This is a great dessert that is completely out of the ordinary and light and summery.

I have made this three times and each time it's been a HUGE hit. I don't understand why so few folks have not had the same fortune as myself! The texture has been spot on, and truthfully I'm SURE it wouldn't have gone over as well without the toppings, particularly the fresh whipped cream. Certainly I receieve many confused, and concerned, faces when bringing it out, but it has brought great compliments from EVERY person every time - as long as they can get past the unusual source! Great way to use too much watermelon after you've gourged yourself and your household just eating it raw.

I tried this out on our rotary club at work last week and they hated it. I don't know if it was the fact that the conistancy was between pudding and jello or what but I had to give them different desserts. I liked the flavor but the consistancy was just not up to what I thought it should be and maybe it was because I used a whisk for my cornstarch and I read from another chef to use a spoon or else it will break it up too much. I don't know but I would go through the reveiws before trying this recipe.

I wish that I had read the reviews before I bothered to make this recipe. It looked so tasty in the magazine! However, like most other reviewers, I thought it was pretty gross tasting and the watery texture was very unappealing.

I have made this several times, and it gets better with each reprisal. This is one of the best things I have ever eaten!

Loved the taste of this, but it was pure liquid. I'm going out now to get popsicle molds to try and salvage this recipe.

I just made...or tried to make...this recipe. However, the "pudding" never turned to pudding. I left it in the refrigerator overnight, and it was still liquid in the morning, even though I had followed the recipe to the letter. I think it may need more cornstarch. I ended up putting it in the freezer to try to make watermelon sorbet, which turned out to be pretty good. I think next time I will use fewer anise seeds, and perhaps will try adding more cornstarch.

To make sure it sets up properly, make sure the cornstarch has thoroughly dissolved in the juice before heating.

I'm sorry but I must correct a little of the "basic knowledge" imparted by reviewer Laurel. Citrus juice does NOT prevent gelatin from gelling. I've been making a lemon mousse recipe for about twenty years (and other similar recipes) in which the gelatin is softened in a couple of tablespoons of water and then dissolved over a low heat in several fluid ounces of lemon juice. It sets up perfectly every time. This recipe worked OK for me but none of us really enjoyed it so I wouldn't make it again.

This was an interesting recipe, but it didn't seem very pudding-like. This was more like watermelon jello. The taste was nice and cleansing, but nothing special. Won't waste my time making this one again.

There is one problem with this recipe: lemon juice (and Gourmet Magazine's test kitchens). The citric acid prevents the pudding from gelling, just like any citrus fruit and gelatin. Use the grated rind of one lemon and one lime in place of the juice, and your gelling problems disappear. As for the anise flavor, try toasting the seeds in a dry saute pan until you can smell them, then cool on a plate and add. Also, when dealing with cornstarch--MAKE SURE IT COMES TO FULL BOIL FOR AT LEAST TWO MINUTES or it will not gel, not just, "Reduce heat and simmer, whisking occasionally, 3 minutes" that just doesn't cut it for 1/4 C of cornstarch. I also added the citrus zest at the start of cooking so it fully released all its oils. And to the cook from Hong Kong--the recipe does not use star anise, that is common in Asian cooking, the recipe refers to Anise seed--a common Italian ingredient. Sorry, but sometimes I think that these cooks should spend some time in the "Learn" section, most of the problems encountered are easily fixed with a little basic knowledge. I doubled the recipe to make for a party and got rave reviews--so I know it gels perfectly and tastes of lovely ripe melon; it probably also helps to use individual serving containers and an appropriately long chilling time (overnight). Any icky taste problems result from undercooked cornstarch (and a soupy result) and unripe watermelon--take care of those two details and everything should be fine. Cheers!

Absolutely awful. I followed directions exactly and it never gelled. Soupy. But the taste was terrible. Don't waste your time.

If you like watermelon, you will love this "pudding". I read the reviews so I knew it would not set-up so that was not a surprise. It was very hot at our home and this was a refreshing way to cool off!

I don't think I rate to many recipes a 1 fork but this was just awful!!!!! As other reviewers have said it does not set up and is runny, not to mention way to sweet. I used the star anise and it added no flavor. Yuk, do not waste your time.

This recipe returned my youth. My parents came from Sicily and this was a delight we often had for a treat.

THIS WAS THE BEST FOOD I HAVE EVER TASTED! I am thrilled with the way it turned out! Splendid! Just Splendid! Well Maybe it wasn't THAT good but it was DECENT! NO It was AMAZING! Wow delicious! wow make it yourself and see!

Take a red watermelon, yellow watermelon, and orange watermelon, and a champane flute and layer the pudding red, then orange, then yellow and garnish with a sprig of mint. Increase the sluury with double the about of corn starch first add half and let it come up to a boil and use a wooden spoon and not a wisk, the wisk breaks up the pudding too much, it should thicken up like pudding if not add the rest of the slurry in increments. cook only until you see it gel together. easy to over cook and burn

Actually, this was quite good. The flavor was very concentrated. Extremely easy and quick to make. The anise in it is fine but not necessary. It does not, however, set like a 'pudding'. It is rather like a thick sauce. It is extremely good as a sauce on ice cream or fresh pineapple. It is terrific layered with strawberry shortcake. Skip the nuts and chololate though.

I was very disappointed. It did not set properly and the flavor was awful. I think that maybe I shouldn't have used the anise, but I don't think it would have made a difference. What a waste of time, effort and refrigerator space!

I was really excited to try this recipe, as I adore watermelon. The pudding, however, was absolutely awful. Like the other reviewers, it didn't set properly and turned into pink, mushy gunk. I can't believe I wasted six cups of watermelon on this!

I made this recipe when my brother-in-law was coming to dinner. He can't eat any fats, so I left out the chocolate and nut garnish. I didn't use the anise, because I thought it would ruin the texture, and I still think it might. I did add rosewater, and people commented on the taste. I also let it simmer for a little longer than it called for because we are at 7000 feet, and I feared it would not set up. As it was, it did, but it was not a hard set. People did like it, and it will be a real dessert for someone who cannot eat fat. I recommend it mostly in that class. It would be good with whipped cream, too.

i wasn't that thrilled with it, but my sweetie said "it's gooder than sh_t!" and this from a guy with a masters degree. guess i'll HAVE to make it again. one thing i did do was add LOTS of chocolate and pistachios.

When I made this it didn't set up at all! I thought it would be creaming, but it was just juice in the end. :(

I don't like watermelon in general - it's too watery, and sticky, though the flavor is nice. This pudding keeps the flavor, but makes the texture much creamier. I also like the anise flavor, it enhances it nicely.

Not worth the effort. It's best to eat watermelon right off the rind. It's easier and better tasting than this recipe.
