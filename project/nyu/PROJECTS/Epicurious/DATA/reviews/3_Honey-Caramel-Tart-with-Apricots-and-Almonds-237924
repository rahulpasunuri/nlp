Oh, and I cooked the crust for less time and then only cooked the tart for @ 50 minutes. It was perfectly cooked and not burnt.

I didn't have semolina flour, so I used a little cornmeal for texture. The crust tasted good, but was really hard to handle when I rolled it out. Next time I will chill it before I roll and maybe chill it again before I try to put it in the tart pan. I forgot to put the whipping cream into the filling and it was fine. I did some fruit substitutions which may have made it too sweet (used dried blueberries instead of cherries since that is what I had). Next time I will add more nuts and cut back on the fruit. Maybe just cranberries and a few apricots. But, it was quite good and very lovely.

Yummy, but a very intense tart. Expect to serve a very small piece to your guests. Also, I don't think it really needed to cook for an hour and 20.

Forgot to rate it...I'd give it 4 forks

This was fantastic and refreshingly different...I made it last night for a dessert party along with 7 other desserts (mostly rich cakes, a trifle, and a cheesecake), and this one got the most compliments. The whipped cream/creme fraiche topping isn't even necessary. One note: while I didn't bake it for 1 hour 20 minutes, I did let it go for about an hour. Though the crust was quite brown, it wasn't burnt, and the apricots were nice and soft while keeping their shape. I also "basted" the apricots with some of the syrup that formed...it looked prettier that way. I might pre bake the shell for a little less time when I make this again (which I definitely will!)

This is really an outstanding dessert, for the sophisticated palate. However, I agree with previous reviewer. The baking time of 1 hour 20 minutes is far too long. I would start checking it after about 20-25 minutes. The crust is baked, and the filling is cooked. Why the long baking time??? I will be using this again, very soon.

I liked this tart. I especially liked that even though it was dessert, it provided nutrients from the fruits and nuts; however, I too did not think it was exceptional.

I really like the idea of this recipe and my guests said they really liked it but to me it is not memorable. It didn't take nearly as long to cook as it said it would and nearly burned the crust. And, it wasn't gooey like I hoped it would be.
