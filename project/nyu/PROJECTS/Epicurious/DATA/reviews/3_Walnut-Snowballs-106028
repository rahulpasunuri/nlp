This is the best Mexican/Russian Wedding/Teacake recipe. Every time I make it, people ask what is different that makes them so much better than others they've had of this type (its the brandy!) Usually I tweak recipes to give them my own spin, but there is nothing to improve here.

these cookies came out way overdone and felt like they were missing something. overall, not satisfactory.

I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies are delicious! The brandy adds just the right bit of sophistication. They will become a standard in my kitchen!

I made these for a cookie exchange and they turned out pretty good, but I am sure there are way better recipes for these same cookies. I didn't have brandy so I used spiced rum instead. turned out fine!

I didn't find these very tasty. I had to use a little bit of cinnamon because we don't house brandy, but it tasted like it was missing something. Then again, I'm used to triple chocolate super-sweet cookies, so that could affect it. They were fun to make, though.

Made these for Christmas this year exactly as written. Be sure to toast the walnuts as this really enhances the flavor. As other reviewers noted, the cookies are not very sweet, which was nice. Caution - the amount of butter in them causes them to brown on the bottom very quickly. I had to cut the bottoms off of my first batch as they got too dark. Turning the oven down to 325 degrees for my other batches worked better.

Just as a side note to the cook from Bethesda, MD... I think it appeals to Chinese people's tastes because it's not *too* sweet. A lot (and especially older Chinese) people don't like to eat really sugary-sweet-sweets (like chocolate, etc). This cookie just has a hint of sweet, which is perfect.

After eating the snowball cookies at a party, I wanted to make my own. These were easy to make. I left out the cloves and brandy (didn't have any) and substituted cinamon. Also substituted sliced almonds (no walnuts at home). I baked for 8 minutes each, because the bottoms were turning black. It was a little hard to get the powdered sugar on the sides of the cookies. But these were really easy and tasty.

This is a great cookie! Very simple to make and melts in your mouth. Just crumbly enough, but stays together nicely. I made w/o the cloves and brandy and they turned out with a nice mix of sweetness and butter flavor.

I had some cookies like this which I loved and so looked for a recipe for them. This is a great recipe. I served them to a New Year's open-house crowd who gobbled them up. I left out the alcohol because I didn't have any. A great cookie overall. Just a sidenote: I've found that these appeal to Chinese tastes. I'm not really sure why. I wouldn't recommend serving them with chinese food, but if you have a mixed group of guests, including some from China...

I love these cookies. They are similar to ones that my MIL makes every Christmas. Mine too, flattened a bit more than my liking during baking. I even tried her trick of freezing the formed cookies prior to baking. I omitted the brandy and substituted water. Next time, I will try less water.

These are just wonderful. Don't change a thing.

Very nice indeed! My cookies flattened a bit during baking rather than staying as a ball. Is this normal? Anybody with any suggestions? I also tried out the recipe using pecans. Excellent!

I've been making snowballs with a different recipe for a many years now. Last December when I discovered this recipe I had to try it. I love it. I used Grand Manier and a variety of nuts. I will be using this recipe for a very long time as people couldn't get enough of it!!

I love them!!! I really don´t think clove its necessary, cinnamon its a lot better, the brandy can be removed too if you don´t like alcohol and everybody can eat them safetly

This recipe was one that brought back many memories for me. I doubled this recipe, and found that everyone still wanted more, and more. The cookies were light and delicious. Be sure to make plenty, and not just at the holidays. Enjoy!

My mother and I used to make snowball cookies when I was little - this brought back memories. I made them with my 4 year old for Christmas this year who had a good time helping me roll them. You can't really go wrong with these.

I plan to make this cookie this weekend butwanted to answer the previous reviewer's question..reversing the sheet means just exchanging the the two cookie sheets on the two oven racks that were placed in the oven. put the top cookie sheet in the bottom and the bottom on top.

By just reading this recipe, I am reminded of Russian Teacakes, aka Mexican Wedding cakes. Would someone please tell me what is meant by the action, "reverse sheets" during the baking process?

It is very difficult to stop yourself from eating these cookies! Mine turned out wonderfully - I used fresh walnuts (don't use old rancid ones!), good fresh UNsalted butter, sea salt, and for the sugar in the dough, I used very finely granulated sugar and for the sugar sprinkled on top, I used confectioner's sugar. I think that the relative success one has with this recipe largely rests on whether one uses good fresh walnuts.

Al;though this cookie was extremely easy to make it didn't do much for me.

These were very tasty and quite easy to make. I stayed true to the recipe.
