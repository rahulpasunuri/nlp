At first glance, the recipe seemed like it would have a bit of a kick to it, but it didn't have nearly the flavor I was hoping for. I think that the citrus thinned it out, so I am looking for an alternate flavor to try this recipe again. Perhaps honey.

I doubled the amount of jalapeño, left some of the seeds and added salt. It added a nice kick to the salad.

A different but interesting vinaigrette with good flavor that I felt went best with a sweeter vegetable, such as jicama, corn or carrots.

My mom loved it, but more for the spice than the flavor. Most guests were uninterested.

Nice and easy recipe. With one Jalapeno, not overly spicy. Nice color. Goes good with salad of paper thin slices of cucumber, canned corn, celery. I should add that I used extra virgin olive oil which gives it a better overall flavor.

This is not very good. Because of the large quantity of oil the other flavors are overly diluted. Good concept, poor execution.

Not enough kick with just one jalapeno, and needs a little bit of cider vinager. A dash of salt and pepper would not hurt.

The flavor of this is really nice on asparagus. Either the jalapeno I used was not very hot or this doesn't have quite enough kick. Next time we will substitute a tablespoon or two of lime juice with white wine vinegar. Perhaps also a dash of pepper sauce, the red one. Overall very interesting and I will make it again soon.
