Oh my goodness! I made this to go with steak tacos a few months ago and since then it has been my number one pregnancy craving! I love these. It's like fancy onion rings covered in cheese. Yum!!

We LOVED these (even people who didn't like onions were begging for more). A bit of work (a lot of frying involved), but we fried the onions earlier in the day and then just heated them in the oven with the cheese (and they turned out just fine). The Manchego cheese is the perfect compliment to the onions. We'll be making this again (and again).
