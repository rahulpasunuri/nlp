This is a fabulous dessert and makes an elegant presentation. A word of caution when pureeing the boysenberry sauce...be sure your blender lid is secure!! :)

Absolutely outstanding. I entertain a lot and people expect good food when they come; this dessert got incomprable enthusiastic raving. And more people asked for this recipe than any other. A sure bet if you want to make an impression or create a special treat. Also simple enough to make and turn a ordinary day into a memorable one.

the texture of the orange mousse was not like a mousse at all. This was o.k., but try the frozen white chocolate raspberry mousse torte recipe on this site......SOOOOO much better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Used triple sec as that's what I had on hand. Thought I would have enjoyed this more based on the reviews but not the case. Fortunately, the company really liked it. The pistachio crust was nice but nothing really special. And the taste of the mousse reminds me of Fruity Pebbles cereal.

Excellent and not difficult. I used dry roasted, shelled pistachios, and the crust was outstanding. If you grate orange peel into longer strips, do not add the orange peel to the whipping cream until AFTER you whip it (unless you want whipping cream to spatter around the kitchen as the orange peel tangles on the bottom of the beaters and flings cream everywhere - that was fun). Also, I tried to shortcut the berry sauce by pressing through a sieve without pureeing - that didn't work. The berries must be pureed first. The sauce is an incredible accompaniment that makes this dessert so wonderful.

This is definetely a wonderful recipe. The flavours are amazing together. Whenever i make it everyone raves about it. I'm always looking for different recipes and alternatives to chocolate desserts. This is an amazing alternative. Loved the pistachios crust. I'll give 5 forks to this one.

I won the prize at our neighborhood Saturday-after-Thanksgiving Pie-o-rama tasting contest with this frozen mousse torte, only one place where it (and I-through-it) was a hit.

I wanted a not-too-fancy dessert, so I lightly buttered individual souffle dished and patted the chopped, toasted pistachios inside before filling. Served with fresh strawberries and raspberries. I will definitely try the crust another time.

This was delicious. I served it to a dinner party of 13 and decorated it as suggested in the photo. It looked beautiful. The Grand Marnier made all the difference ! Thanks for the tip about the pre- shelled pistachios. Also, everyone is correct -- it does start melting right away. Even faster than ice cream (due to the alcholic content).

Delicious! I made it for Christmas dinner and received many compliments. My father-in-law loved it as did my 12 year old. Buy already shelled raw pistachios at Trader Joe's to save time.

A big hit at our Thanksgiving dinner this year. Exquisite presentation and the flavors are fabulous together. My only regret is that the recipe wasn't more specific about thaw time. The torte really needs to go from freezer to table without much delay-otherwise you will experience thawing edges with garnish sliding off the sides (as I did). What can I say-Thanksgiving in So.Cal. was 80 degrees this year. Still-I'll try again and it will be better next time!

This dessert is fantastic - beautiful presentation and delicious flavors! I made this for a neighborhood progressive dinner for which I was assigned the dessert course. People were completely blown away by this one. I offered it along with a dense, chocolatey thing and this dessert went faster. It does begin to melt at a certain point so if it's out on a table, keep an eye on it.

Delicious! I also substituted pure vanilla extract for the bean and used mixed berried for the sauce. Didn't make any difference. All my guests raved about it! It was worth shelling all those pistachios (1 16oz bag) for the crust!

Outstanding dish!! Well worth the time it takes to shell the pistachios--served it at my Christmas party to rave reviews! Quite apart from the fact I loved it.

I have made this receipe twice. The first time for Easter. It was a huge sucsess. In fact it was so good everyone seems to have forgotten the rest of the meal.It is time consuming. Get some help shelling the nuts and be sure to have plenty of freezing time. This desert is incredable

Everyone loved this cake, especially me since I make it the day before. However, shelling the nuts was very tiring.

Very light. A good summer or spring recipe. Used dried roasted pistachio's in the crust. The mild salt was a nice contrast to the orange/sweet flavor. Not overly sweet mousse. Used 1 tsp. vanilla as recommended by one reviewer in lieu of the vanilla bean. It worked well in the sauce. Served at a dinner party for 10 generous servings. Everyone raved.

Absolutely terrific! If you don't want to pay $7 for the vanilla bean, I found that a teaspoon of GOOD QUALITY vanilla worked just fine! I would have to concur with the cook from Saratoga's friend...the best ever!

This is a wonderful dessert. I made it for my very gourmet dinner club. We all throughly enjoyed it, including Phil, a self proclaimed dessert expert, who said it was the best dessert he had ever had. Truly excellent!!

This dessert was a real hit at the Thanksgiving dinner. Lighter tasting than the traditional Thanksgiving desserts.
