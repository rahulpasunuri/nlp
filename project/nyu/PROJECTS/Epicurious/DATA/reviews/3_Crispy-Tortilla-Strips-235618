I doubt that baking could possibly be as tasty. Fry away, in moderation, and enjoy! I put these on top of a bbq chicken salad in response to a challenge from my 15 year old that I could not make the salad as well as California Pizza Kitchen, and in no small part to these homemade tasties, have my Queen of Salads title back.

An easy, more healthy and just as tasty way to make these strips is to lay our on a broiler-proof sheet, sprinkle with olive oil, salt and lime juice and broil, turning until brown-can add chili powder or chipotle sauce for zing.

Delicious! Prepared exactly as per the recipe for Corn and Crab Soup and Crispy Tortilla Strips in the August '06 Bon Appetit. The soup was equally as good. The strips would be good for snacking any time. I think it is key to have freshly made corn torillas to prepare the stips. If I had not "guarded" the strips, they would have been gone before the soup was served.
