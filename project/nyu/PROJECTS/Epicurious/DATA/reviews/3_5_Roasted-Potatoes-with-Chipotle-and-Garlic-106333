These ROCKED! Kids loved! Husband loved! I loved! They were crisp on the outside, tender on the inside, and the dipping sauce went perfectly. I altered it just a bit by using 1/4 c mayo and 2/3 c greek yogurt. Everything else was spot on. Served with the Greek Lamb Burger from BA March 08. Four forks all the way!

This dish is now part of our regular roations. It goes so well with so many things. I have not been able to find chipotle powder so I blend the garlic, oil, canned chipotles, cumin, and sometimes jalapeno together and coat the poatoes with the mixture. Then I broil them for a few extra minutes in the last step to help make them crunchy. Also, I often use palin yogurt instead of sour cream or creme fraiche.

Delicious, quick and easy. Loved the spiciness as well.

Yum! I love these! The dipping sauce is great (using low fat sour cream didn't affect the taste)! I halved the amount of potatoes to serve two people, but I made all of the sauce and added just as much garlic and chipotle powder as the recipe called for, because I like things garlicky and spicy! :)

these potatoes were wonderful and very easy. i added sweet potatoes to the mix which made it extra special. i also added more garlic and chipotle powder...great with extra spice!

Follow the steps to turning the potatoes to get them nice and crispy. You can use any chile powder, really, depending on your personal taste and use more or less lime juice depending on your "zing" quotient. This makes a nice Tex-Mex/Brazilian meal side.

Made this for the first time tonight using red potatoes and they were fabulous. Couldn't stop eating them! Used light sour cream for the sauce and it was fine. To St. Paul: You need to watch Emeril on TV and learn how to kick it up a notch when something is bland...it would have been simple to just add more chipotle powder.

This recipe works well with very small potatoes, too. We have roasted them in a baking pan in the oven.

My husband and I have made these several times and they are delicious. We use a combination of chipotle powder and tabasco powder; the latter adds a touch of sweetness with the hot flavor. These are easy and very flavorful. I highly recommend them!

These potatoes were a big hit at an informal dinner, especially with the dipping sauce. They had a wonderful flavor - I'm glad to find new uses for my chipotle powder! Try this recipe.

I used Chipotle power and didn't find these bland at all. We like things really spicey, so used more than called for and also more garlic. Cut the potatoes up and added everything in the beginning and barbequed them. Was simple and less steps. They were crisp and wonderful. Used sour cream for sauce with chipotle powder (Penzey's).

These were intresting- didn't have chipotle powder so I used Red Hot Chili Mix. Very spicy- the dip seemed a little bland.
