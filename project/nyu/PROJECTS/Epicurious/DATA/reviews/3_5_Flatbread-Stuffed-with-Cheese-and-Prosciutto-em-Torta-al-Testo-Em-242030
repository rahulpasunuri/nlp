delicious! We used fontina - a good melting cheese with a nice salty tang. This was a perfect light dinner (with a salad) after a long warm spring day working in the garden.

I used baby spinach and mozzarella cheese because I had them on hand, along with some good parma prosciutto. If I make this again I will use one of the tangier cheeses suggested in the recipe. Mozzarella was a little too bland. The bread was simple to make, it took some patience to work the two halves of each round apart. This recipe was easy and simple, it just requires some time to allow for the dough to rest and rise. It was a little hard to bite through this sandwich.

We used basil instead of arugula, it was what was on hand. It has become a family favorite....

Just a quick remark re the the dough not coming together with the amount of water suggested - I'm sure you are all well practiced cooks, and therefore probably know that all flour- based pastries, breads, etc. will require more or less water or flour depending upon the humidity in the air the hour you choose to bake.

This was really good and it came together beautifully. We used baby spinach instead of arugula (spinach was $2, arugula was $8) and gruyere instead of fontina. It was overall pretty good, but I felt like it needed something else. I stirred together some grainy mustard and homemade mayonnaise, and that added a delicious extra something. It reminded me of a trip to Switzerland where we subsisted on gruyere and ham sandwiches the whole time because we couldn't afford to go out. One of the other reviewers mentioned adding tomato, which might be good, too. I'd definitely make this again.

When making the dough as suggested, by hand, the dough turns out lovely. I used King Arthur Flour and after the dough rose, it had a lovely, smooth complexion. Although the dough needed more water, it came together easily. I would make more if you are going to serve to large parties and a little thicker if you have trouble cutting with precision through bread. I thought the arugula and prosciutto melded well with the bread and eachother. I used Swiss Gruyere instead of Fontina and thought it brought a very earthy taste to the dish. This dish was excellent and I will use it again.

Only two - reason 1: the dough did not seem to come together with just 2/3 c. water. I used my standmixer, perhaps next time will do by hand as suggested. Reason 2: adding salt to the sandwich may be unnecesary, as the meat adds alot. Would add something like tomato (?) Will make again, perhaps with other filling ingredients.
