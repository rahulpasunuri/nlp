Excellent salsa recipe which I put as accompaniment to poached salmon (along with couple other options). I added garlic to the salsa mix as I love, and it tasted wonderful. Not time-consuming but was rich in flavor. I let it sit for a bit in the fridge before serving to let flavors settle. Definitely would make again.

I really wanted to like this, but wow - what a lot of work to overpower the delicate flavor of fine (and expensive salmon). I still have the taste of raw garlic in my mouth, and absolutely no sensation of the lovely flavor of my favorite fish, salmon. I will continue my quest for a delicate, cold salmon that can be prepared ahead of time - for picnics, buffets, etc.

Like many other reviewers, I substituted fillets for steaks; otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. It was well-seasoned, refreshing, light, and delicious. My husband didn't get to taste it, and I actually felt sorry for him. This will be in my regular summer dinner rotation. It's also an ideal dish for a dinner party, because of the make-ahead aspect. It literally took 5 minutes to put it all together after it had chilled.

I am sorry to say that this didn't impress me that much. Maybe it was just too much cold food. Really liked the parsley and red pepper sauce. I think I would skip the cold potatoes if I prepared it again. The salmon was fine.

Not outstanding but a nice summer meal. The presentation is attractive and the ability to prepare it ahead of time is a plus. I might drop the dill and use cilantro and a jalapeno pepper rather then the parsley next time.

Easy, tasty, pretty presentation. The salsa adds lots of color and the combination of the FRESH lemon juice and herbs was delicious. Would definitely make this again.

The salsa makes this dish. It is delicious: light, vibrant and refreshing. Fortunately, I took the advise of previous reviewers and made a double batch. The fish and potatoes, well, they were ok. They were a nice compliment to the fish. Next time I might use filets instead of steaks. By the time I picked the bones out of the fish, it broke apart. I may has well have saved myself the work and gotten the filets.

This was delicious, very easy to make, and quite an impressive presentation. I would probably double to sauce next time.

Very tasty and easy. I would also use filets instead of steaks. I served it over mixed greens garnished with grape tomatoes with a cous couse salad on the side. Great colors and flavors.

Incredibly simple and incredibly delicious. I'm not usually a fan of dill, lemon, and fish because it's an overdone combination. However, this dish is exceptional. The only thing I might change is to use salmon fillets rather than steaks just to make this wonderful dish less bothersome to eat. I confess that I ate this dish hot having made it for dinner on a weeknight. The next day's cold version for lunch was equally delicious. The salsa is a perfect savory combination to go with fish.

Imade this for a party and it was delicious. I tripled the recipe and made all the parts early in the day and just assembled it for a 5pm party. It looked beautiful, and was referred to as, "the perfect summer dish".

I threw everything together in a bowl and made a salmon-potato salad. It was great and I plan to make it for a shower this spring. I'm going to cut the potatoes and salmon a little smaller, though. Light and tasty!

This is a very easy dish to make. My husband really loved it so i would definitely make it agian only next time I would let the salmon completely cool before cutting it into one inch pieces or I would just serve the salmon steak whole tithout cutting it up. I also felt like two steaks would not serve 4 people. I had to cook my salmon for longer untill it was done.

My daugthers (5 and 7) and I made this dish for Mother's Day. It was a big hit - the girls said it was the best salmon they ever had. We all gave it four forks!

My two daughters, aged 15 and 18, made this recipe for me for Mother's Day and it was wonderful. It is not only delicious but beautiful and I will certainly be making it for my company in the future.

A wonderful hot-weather dish. Easy, delicious, impressive. Served it twice to company thus far and will definitely use it many more times.
