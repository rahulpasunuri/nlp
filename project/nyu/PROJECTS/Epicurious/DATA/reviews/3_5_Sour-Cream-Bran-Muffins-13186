3.5 - I had to find a new recipe since my Joy of Cooking bran muffin recipe calls for too much molasses (and I LOVE molasses!). These contain more sugar and butter than I prefer for a muffin, but they are so light and fluffy, they are really irresistible. I didn't have any sour cream, so just subbed water and skim milk, and they still turned out great. Will definitely make again.

I made this with whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour, and oat bran instead of miller's bran. I also substituted honey for the molasses, and used blackberries instead of raisins. Really good!!

This is a distinguished bran muffin. I substituted oat bran for miller's bran and Tofutti (soy) sour cream for regular dairy sour cream, and they still came out perfectly. The flavour is of deep molasses.

Best ever Bran Muffins. Everyone loves them and they are great for a couple of days. Never make any other now that I have this one

So easy and so good! I used golden raisins and reduced fat sour cream. I was a little concerned with how thick the batter was, so I did throw in a few tablespoons of buttermilk at the end. Either way, just an excellent and nice textured muffin. I had been looking for a go to bran muffin recipe and I have found it.

This is indeed, the Rolls Royce of Bran Muffins. (Note: See cookbook: "Nourishing Traditions" (Sally Fallon) to understand that the animal fats involved are, in fact, necessary to the body for optimum health.)

Subbed Greek yogurt for sour cream, didn't add raisins, and used honey instead of molasses. I also made them in a mini muffin pan (baked at 400 for 7 minutes) and it made 36 minis. I put a few drops of agave syrup on top when they came out of the oven for a touch of sweetness. Overall, they were very light in texture for a bran muffin, and I found them to be pretty oily. I will probably make them again but reduce the butter next time.

Truly the best bran muffin I have ever made or eaten. I added 1 teas. cinnamon, 1/4 teas. nutmeg and 1 teas vanilla that added a nice warm, spicy taste to an already great recipe.

I used honey instead of molasses, and made 9 instead of 12 muffins as other reviewers have suggested. I left out the raisins. Definitely light and fluffy, not too sweet. Next time I will try 1/2 cup in all of brown sugar.

Just okay - I followed the recipe exactly and was expecting it to be fluffier but was quite dense and oily. I think there are better bran muffin recipes out there, and probably with a lot less fat.

Yes it was moist, yes it was fluffy, but IT TASTED HORRIBLE. You MUST love molasses to even like this recipe.

fantastic! i just made these (i opted to make 24 mini-muffins), and downed 4. : ) i used honey instead of molasses, and chose to add cinnamon chips instead of raisins. so good! as many reviewers have said, this recipe seems extremely adaptable. i'll try next time to add raspberries and mini chocolate chips. yum!

Rating: 4
Un-believable, that a bran muffin could be moist and fluffy and light and delicious. Granted, i traded the raisins for raspberries and added some mini chocolate chips, but still. I am planning my next version of these muffins, as they seem eminently adaptable. I'm thinking I may chop up some dried apricots or prunes next time. Yum dee-lish!

A really great bran muffin recipe. I find that they are quite small when made to spec (12 muffins), so I pare down the number to 9 and have had more success. My daughter needs a quick item to grab for breakfast while heading out the door each morning. These muffins pack well, they are fluffy but filling and a cinch to whip up.

Rating: 4
These muffins turned out fabulous! I used ground up bran cereal instead of the natural bran and I added a splash of milk to the batter because I found it to be a bit thick. I liked the texture of them and they were very moist for bran muffins. Even my picky kids LOVED them!!

Rating: 4
What a forgiving and WONDERFUL recipe! My family LOVED it. I made 2 batches: One exactly as directed and one with substitutions to see how adaptable it was. Blueberries vs Raisins Wheat germ vs. Bran Honey vs. Molasses plain Yogurt vs. Sour Cream Both batches turned out BEAUTIFULLY - the altered version had a honeycombed kind of texture, but both were SO good!

Rating: 4
These are fabulous, I like them better than the Buttermilk Bran Muffin recipe that is also on epicurious. I omit the raisins, and as soon as they come out of the oven I drizzle them with honey. It soaks into the hot muffins and leaves a nice shiny glaze. I also sprinkle them with turbinado sugar for extra sweetness. They are so moist and delicious, even 3 days after baking. The only problem I have is once you add the sour cream and molasses, the mixture gets awfully lumpy (even when using an electric mixer), but don't be discouraged, they come out just fine. Best to resist the urge to overmix this recipe.

Very nice texture, keeps well. I used whole-milk yogurt instead of sour cream, honey instead of molasses, and mini chocolate chips instead of raisins.

Here's how I made this recipe, based on ingredients I had and drawing from other recipes. I ground up some rainsin bran flakes, used almond meal and flak seed to substitute for the wheat flour I didn't have. I substituted marscapone for the sour cream, and also added in a quarter cup of chopped fresh pineapple and grapes, and 1/4 cup of raisins. Used one tab or butter and then one tablespoon of ghee. Was a delicious recipe!

Rating: 4
Simple recipe, very forgiving! Like other reviewers have said, you can change around some of the ingredients and still have a light, moist fluffy muffin. I put in 1 cup of frozen blueberries in place of the raisins and it was great. Didn't have enough molasses so made up the rest of it with honey. No miller's bran so toasted up some oat bran in a skillet instead. Also, my sour cream was half frozen but I didn't have time for it to thaw! Mashed down the ice with a potato masher and hoped for the best. Thanks, Gourmet for a great recipe!

I never thought it would be possible to have light fluffy bran muffins. This is the ULTIMATE recipe. Look no further.

We thought these were exceptionally good. They're moist, dense and not overly sweet. The only modification I made was to add 1t vanilla and 1/4t almond extract. This is a great basic recipe which will lend itself well to experimenting w/ different additions, e.g. chopped dates, berries, etc. This will be my 'go to' bran muffin recipe.

This was the lightest, most delicious bran muffin. I even used light sour cream.

This is an outstanding recipe. I make them in a large cup muffin pan and make only 6 so I get a bigger serving! Fantastic. I only could find regular bran and still these rocked.

I'd hoped this recipe would end my search for the perfect moist, dense bran muffin. . . but it hasn't. I didn't like these at all. Too sweet, too light and fluffy. Disappointing.

Rating: 3
Wow, what a surprise. The nice fluffy texture is the best thing about these. I used whole-wheat flour and my husband loved them. The second time I made them I tried modifying the recipe a little, but didn't like it as much. From now on, I'll follow this recipe exactly.

I used half wheat half regular flour and used vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream. These were great! Moist and full of flavor....

This recipe is excellent. I have tried several recipes in the past and I have to say this by far is the best one I've come across. The muffins come out very moist and tasty and the best part is they're healthy. I modified the recipe by taking some advice from the others such as replacing the butter with 1 cup of applesauce, used Oat Bran instead of the miller's bran, added a couple of TBS of Flax Seed Meal and about 1 TBS of Powdered Buttermilk. Next time, I may add more raisins or maybe some more brown sugar just to sweeten them up a bit.

Delicious, moist, and fluffy. Extra fiber never tasted that good ;-) I made them both in regular size and as minis - both turned out great. The mini muffins were popular toddler party food...

Oh MY God GOOD!!!! These are so moist and deliciouse, my kids and husband ate the whole batch before they even had time to cool. I did not have sour cream, so I used kefir, kellogs bran cereal instead of the other kind and 1/4 c. raisins and 1/4 c. chocolate chips. I will make them again and again.

We enjoyed these muffins. Made some large and some mini. The mini's turned out better than large. Seemed to rise better. I like the idea of a little chocolate another reviewer suggested but I think I would keep the raisons.

Very nice, but the batter was a bit dry so I added about 1/4 c buttermilk for a good consistency. I also added a teaspoon cinnamon, 2 tsp. ginger and 1/2 tsp. cardamom. Definitely a make again.

This is the best Bran Muffin recipe I have ever tasted, They were so easy to make, and best of all they werent dry, which many get that way after a day or so, I also did not have the Miller's Bran, like the recipe suggest,so I used the wheat Bran I had bought at the Whole Foods. I also did not have any raisons, so I subsitute the raisons for 1/2 c of girardelli semi sweet cho chips, which made them even more delicious.

Delicious! Made recipe exactly as is. Great flavor. This is a hearty muffin. I sprayed the muffin papers with vegetable spray and the muffins did not stick at all to the paper. A keeper. I will try some of the variations as well.

THE BEST BRAN MUFFINS! I love this recipe, I have made it exactly how its written and I have changed things. I have made it will whole wheat flour instead of white, I added coconut, I usually use plain yogurt instead of sour cream, and I have added nuts. Its just great! I think I will make them tonight!

This recipe was just what I was looking for. I added Craisins as well as soft raisins, and before I put them in the oven I sprinkled both chopped walnuts and raw sugar to the top. They are moist and flavorful. I have made them several times now.

Rating: 3
These had exactly the flavor I was looking for! I used half white/half whole wheat flour. They didn't rise much (perhaps due to my substitution) but were not overly wet or dense. I may try substituting buttermilk for the sour cream to lower the fat a bit.

I really hate raisins.. so I added about 1/2 to about 3/4 cup frozen blueberries to completed batter. (Don't stir too much or you'll have blue muffins) The muffins were nice.. moist interior. Got this recipe from Bon appetit for maple butter 1 stick unsalted butter, 1 tablespoon golden brown sugar and 1/2 cup maple syrup..combine in processor. transfer to bowl and chill. Now that's a nice addition to any muffin!

I've made these muffins several times, and each time I alter the recipe a little. I've added cranberries, grated zucchini, used yogurt in place of the sour cream, and reduced the butter a little. Every time, no matter what the variation, they've turned out great - they look perfect, and are a delicious way to start the morning.

These muffins were okay. A bit heavy and have that "healthy" taste that often scares people away from bran muffins. I made the other bran muffins from this site called "Buttermilk Bran Muffins" and found them to be much more tasty with the same amount of bran! Very good with a cup of walnuts added to the batter.

Rating: 0
Mine didn't work! :0( Followed the recipe using the substitutions mentioned here: 6 ozs. of unsweetened applesauce for the butter and fat-free vanilla yogourt for the sour cream. Also, threw in a finely chopped apple, just for grins. They didn't fully rise and were soggy in the middle. They *tasted* good though, but most of the muffin was left behind on the paper wrapper. I'm thinking that you can't make a straight substitution of applesauce for butter and a tablespoon or two of oil is needed...very disappointing.

I just returned from a trip to Chicago, and stayed at the Drake Hotel. The bran muffins they served for breakfast were delicious, so I immediately looked to Epicurious for a muffin recipe similiar to the hotel's recipe. These taste exactly like the Drake's! I also used 6 oz applesauce and plain yogurt for the sour cream, and they are delicious and moist. They are great with strawberry preserves.

This was a great recipe-- the muffins were just sweet enough and the flavors, along with the texture, made these delicious. I made mini-muffins and my family loved them. I may add grated or chopped apple and some cinnamon next time, but I am pleased with the original recipe.

These muffins are wonderful! I've tried about 8 different bran muffin recipes, and these are the best I've found. The low-fat variation (substitute low fat sour cream for normal, and applesauce for butter) is also excellent.

These muffins really are nothing like the ones from the bakery. When you make 12 as the recipe calls for they are quite small. I'm used to having a bran muffin as my breakfast. With these I eat two. I am going to eat the ones I made, but doubt I will make them again. I've just tried a modified version of the Quick Oat Bran and Banana Muffins and can tell already that they are going to be much better.

I made the same low-fat alterations: applesauce for butter and low-fat sour cream. I also used maple syrup instead of molasses, and it worked. These are great bran muffins; I enjoyed them much more than ordinary muffins.

I used 6 oz. applesauce for butter, non-fat sour cream and oat bran for the miller's bran. I made these with each 1/2 c. dried cranberries, 1 1/2 bananas, and 1/2 c. dates. All were absolutely delicious. I had been looking for a delicious Bran Muffin Recipe and I have truly found one!

I was in need of a low-fat bran muffin, so I modified this recipe using 6 oz. applesauce for the butter, non-fat egg beaters for the egg, low-fat sour cream, and oat bran for the miller's bran. I also added in 1/3 c. flax seed ground fine in a coffee grinder (I'm always looking for ways to lower my cholesterol). They are great - moist and yummy. We're addicted!

I loved this recipe. I substituted low fat plain yogurt for the sour cream and applesauce for the butter and these muffins turned out to die for. Very moist, better second day. I added blue-berries to one batch and raisin to another. Definitely a "do-it-againer".

Just as a remember the best of American muffins - I was not sure of the English equivalent of dark molasses so used half black treacle and half golden syrup which worked very well.
