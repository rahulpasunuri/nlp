This recipe was a hit with my chef boyfriend who has very particular tastes. I did make some substitutions and modifications as I found it to be a bit bitter/salty as is. Juice of half a lime instead of lemon. One clove finely minced garlic instead of scallions. To remedy the saltiness/bitterness I added 1 1/2 tbsp of maple syrup although I'm sure honey would work as well. I also increase the amount of ginger by 1/4 tsp. Another important modification, double the recipe!

We liked it! I used white miso instead of red, omitted the scallion, used a bit less oil (olive oil), a bit more water, a little mirin, a sprinkle of sweetener and enjoyed on a green salad. I'm sure I'll make it again.

So yummy even my chef-boyfriend was impressed. I used sweet white miso, shallots instead of scallions, and didn't use the ginger but I will try that next time.

This is delicious over salmon! I followed the recipe except I added a teaspoon more juice and used shallots instead of scallions since that is what I had on hand.

Maybe I did something wrong, but this was TOO salty for me. Any tips on what to do next time? I ended up adding much more water and some sugar.

I added a bit more oil and a bit of mirin, as the dressing seemed thicker than I wanted for greens. I also used snipped chives instead of a scallion. The taste is great, quite salty, but the ginger is wonderful. In its thicker state, it would be good with raw veggies such as snap peas or cucumber, as a dip or drizzled on top. I also think lime juice would be a good substitution for lemon. And perhaps a little lime zest.

This is a new family staple. My three-year-old asks if we're going to have it, and of course the adults think it's great because it's a break from the usual and has such a nice balance of flavors. It's quick and easy, and the emulsification holds in the fridge.

Well, I'm hooked on this now! It is so delicious and a thankful departure from bottled salad dressings. It is also a breeze to whisk together; best if allowed to sit for a little while so the flavors can blend in my opinion.

Top notch. Served this before my main course of Curry Shrimp on this site. I will use less lemon next time..like it but I think it can be a little overpowering.

My 17 year old daughter said; "This dressing made me like mixed greens". My five year old son said " I ate ginger?". That said... I liked it, though I added more LIME juice (about 2x as much as the recipe asked for).

I'm sorry that I appear to be the only one, to date, unable to give this vinaigrette recipe 3 or 4 forks. I thought the dressing was just "okay". I think it needed more ginger, and felt that the texture could have been thinner. Not bad, but doubt I'd make it again with so many others to try.

I had been looking for such a recipe for a long time. It was absolutely excellent. They usually serve this kind of salad in Japonese restaurants and it had the same taste.

I simply adore miso any-which-way. This vinaigrette was delicious! I just loved the tanginess.

Doesn't look very good, but tastes great.

Almost TOO delicious! Lots of body lets dressing cling to greens, and there's great mouth-feel. I used fresh lime juice, and grated the ginger for speed and texture.
