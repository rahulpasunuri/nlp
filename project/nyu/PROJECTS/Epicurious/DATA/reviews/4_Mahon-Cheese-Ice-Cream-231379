This was awesome! The recipe did not specify using aged Mahon - which has a much more intense flavor. I did use the aged - and I'm so glad I did. It was delicious.

A refreshing alternative to most cheese ice creams. I sometimes make this with fromage blanc instead of the Mahon and substitute mascarpone for the cream cheese. Lovely with the figs but also works well with any stone fruit and Amaretto.

Love the complex flavors of this dessert- worth looking for the mahon cheese and making the figs and accompanying sauce. Have made several times for guests to rave reviews though not from the kids.

Very good. A nice change from vanilla ice cream. I served with the figs poached in wine, sherry vinegar sauce and pumpkin brittle and as an entity very, very good. I would make the ice cream again on its own as well.

What's not to like about this?!!! Totally adult, indulgent decadence! The subtle flavor of cheeses (I substituted Fontina for the Mahon) and the Sherry Vinegar Syrup works beautifully together. The trick to a super smooth and creamy ice cream is to really stir the cheeses until completely melted and incorporated with the custard. Takes a good 5 minutes of continuous stirring, but the results are divine.
