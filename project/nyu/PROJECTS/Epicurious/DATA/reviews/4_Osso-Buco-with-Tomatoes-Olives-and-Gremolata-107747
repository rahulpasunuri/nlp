I previoulsy reviewed this superb recipe as "a cook from Hanover, MA", recommending that it be served with the lemon risotto from this site -a perfect accompaniment. The only twist I add to it is to reduce the sauce after removing the meat, with the addition of a T of honey, which cuts the acidity of the tomatoes and lemon, and adds a rich gloss to the finished product. I just adapted the recipe this evening to use lamb shanks - 4 shanks weighing about 1 lb each. Simply changed out the chicken broth and white wine for beef broth and red wine, and used orange julienne instead of lemon in the stew. I found that 2 hours in the oven were just enough time. We're saving this dish for Oscar night tomorrow, but my oh my, the aromas and the taste of the sauce are driving me mad. I know it will improve overnight in the fridge and will reheat well. Anyone who loves lamb or veal would be thrilled with this dish in their repertoire.

Excellent recipe! I followed another's advice and also made the lemon risotto which blended very well with the lemon/garlic of the gremolata. We were lucky to find veal shanks here, but when they are scarce, this could be made with chicken or pork chops. Definitely a family pleaser and great for entertainment.

This was a great recipe and it comes together very easily. I used veal shanks this time. I am tempted to try it with lamb next time just for a little variety. This is a great meal to serve for company as there is very little last minute work involved. Definitely will repeat this one.

This recipe is really really good, and doesn't need any changes. I did add more veggies, but otherwise made exactly to recipe, only halving the ingredients. My husband said it was in the top three of anything I've ever made, so it must be good!

I have made this recipe 4-5 times. It's fabulous. A couple of times I have made it with lamb shanks, and with beef cross cut shanks, and once with plain old chuck stewing steak. The lamb and beef cross cut shanks were outstanding, the chuck steak ok. The olives and lemon zest really 'lift' this. When made with whole lamb shanks, for some reason the sauce is quite thin and there is heaps left over - no worries though, as I just chuck a lamb rump into the sauce the next night, then shred it and serve over parpadelle. Yum!

This recipe was fantastic! The whole family loved it! I however cooked it in a slow cooker which I prepared in the morning, came back from work and supper was ready. I do recommend it.

delicious! i substituted lamb shank for veal (the butcher was out of veal, and the lamb shank was about half the price)-- other than that, i followed the recipe exactly and it was fantastic. my fiance is not crazy for olives and initially requested i leave them out-- after reading a number of reviews that strongly supported the addition of olives, i elected to follow the recipe and go with the olives. we were not disappointed-- we both loved the dish. it is melt in your mouth good. i paired it with lemon risotto and a spring veggie saute-- it was fabulous and i will definitely make it again.

Rating: 4
This is so delicious. Don't bother flouring the meat - the sauce gets nice and thick on it's own. Be sure to salt and pepper the shanks before browning, though. Love that it can be put together and basically forgotten for about 3 hours. You can also do without the strings if you are careful. It's fabulous next to the Risotto Con Parmigiano- Reggiano on this site.

this recipe was absolutely amazing. i made it for the first time for a dinner party of 12, and it was a real stunner! i ordered the meat from our local butcher, who tied each shank with string for me. i cooked the entire dish the night before, let it cool, and reheated the next day. wow!!! the dish tasted amazing right out of the oven, but even better the next day! my guests were amazed about how complex the flavors were, and i was amazed by how incredibly easy the recipe was! most of the work was done by the oven. i must say, DO NOT leave out the olives, they lend such a rich and interesting note to the finished dish. and the gremolata on top was just icing on the cake! i will definitely be making this dish again!

Exceptionally easy and tasteful. We stumbled upon some gorgeous shanks at Costco, so we decided to give this a shot. We wrapped the shanks in the style of a gift package (string going around all sides) and thank goodness for that, as the meat was fall off the bone tender. All of the flavours melded beautifully. I wasn't sure about the carrots or Kalamatas, but it all worked. Changes I made: 2 additional cloves of garlic, a tsp of red pepper flakes and a tbls of tomato paste (deepened the flavour). When I make this next, I will omit the cup of chicken broth and replace it with an additional cup of wine and some veal demi-glace. Oh, and I will remember to make the gremolata! We were halfway through our meal when we remembered that we had forgotten to make the gremolata. Oh well, it was fantastic without and will undoubtedly be even better with, if I were to guess. Try this!

I served this osso bucco recipe for my boyfriend's dinner last night to rave reviews. My boyfriend is a chef, counts osso bucco as one of his favorite dishes, & he absolutely loved this rendition! I started with beautiful, meaty looking shanks & cooked them the day before the dinner, which not only allowed the flavors to marry & improve overnight, but made it really nice to have them done with only reheating needed before serving them. The meat was falling off the bone & all the acidity of the lemon, tomato & olives was a great accompaniment to the fattiness of the osso bucco. The aromatics of the gremolata at the end were a wonderful addition as well. I would definitely make this again. The only thing one must consider is the price. The veal shanks, alone, for 4 people set me back about $55. Still- for a special occasion, it was totally worth it- especially considering how happy it made the birthday boy! For those who are considering accompaniments, I served my osso bucco with a potato-celery root puree, which was delicious with it as well as a spring greens salad with a nice simple, acidic, shallot, red wine & mustard vinaigrette. That also was a nice contrast to the richness of the meat & potatoes.

Rating: 4
This was really tasty comfort food. I made it the night before for a dinner party and heated it up the night of the party. Despite making the gremolata I forgot to sprinkle it on top when I plated the veal! Too bad because it was so pretty and would have added to the presentation (as well as the flavor no doubt!) The olives added depth and should not be omitted. I used a 28 oz can of San Marzano diced tomatoes in their juice, 3 carrots and several celery ribs (used the mini-prep) however and was very loose with the wine and broth measurements. I served it with mashed potatoes made with red potatoes in their skins. Will make this recipe again for sure!

Rating: 3
This is a lovely recipe and it is not difficult to make. High quality veal shanks are expensive, so I order small ones--some veal shanks are huge. It took longer to cook than expected--about 3 hours, and I had to boil down the sauce a bit at the end. Did not do the gremolata. Do not omit the olives--they are a wonderful addition. Be sure to serve with a celeriac, cauliflower, or potato puree to soak up the delicious sauce!

I cooked this using venison shank from a hunter friend of mine - AMAZING! As the thigh meat was not "bone-in", I used beef, 1" cut thigh bone from a butcher to add the marrow and additional flavor for the shanks. I had two avid hunters at the first serving and both returned for seconds and thirds. It was such an exotic and surprising change from venison burgers for their wives.

To be honest i thought it was lacking a bit in flavor. a bit more salt would have helped slightly, but it really needs something with it. either risotto or polenta, something. also, could help to cook down the sauce afterward and serve it a bit thicker.

I have made this 4 or 5 times now over the past several years, and it never fails to be awesome. It's easy, too- I don't have a lot of patience for things that require a lot of intricate work and patience- but this basically consists of throwing everything in a pot for 2 1/2 hours. Great for having guests over- they will be impressed. It is even better the second day.

Hahhhhhhhh!!!! That is what you will say after your first bite of this wonderful Osso Bucco recipe. My wife has plenty of recipe books at home and I browsed several but none seemed to contain all the magic that this one seemed to promise. And it did not fail, the flavors are complex and have depth. I left it 2 1/2 hours in the oven inside a Dutch pot and the meat was falling apart and the sauce was simply luscious and naturally thick. The gremolata adds a zesty tone that is outstanding. I made a Risotto Milanese (own rrecipe) and it was a match made in even. A nice bottle of Italian (Felsina Chianti) red complemented everything. From now on this will be the only Osso Bucco recipe I do at home.

Rating: 4
I made this as a special treat for my husband, and he was so unprepared for what he was about to experience. The osso buco was amazingly rich and the gremolata, a pefect addition. An incredibly simple dish that is perfect for a dinner party. They will never know what hit them! I served this with soft polenta over three weeks ago and my husband hasn't stopped talking about since.

I would like to preface this review by saying that I made this dish for some French friends, whom I generally find to be very conservative with their compliments towards good food and with their approval of meat dishes...needless to say, they were floored by this dish. I was in heaven hearing their "mmms" and "wows" throughout the night! I made it exactly as written, with the only addition of several thyme sprigs (which I discarded along with the parsley). I served this alongside a light salad and 3 fresh french baguettes - it was absolutely amazing, and I can't wait to make this for more guests. As other reviewers mentioned, I also am really excited to toss the leftover sauce and meat with pasta tomorrow night! If you're looking for a good meat stew, I think you need look no further.

The veggies, etc were not elegant after the cooking, and had lost most of their flavor. So,I strained and pressed all, slightly thickened the resulting sauce and served with gremolata.

i made this with beef shank and that was a BIG mistake! i should have known how tough and gamey it would be. i made a few other mistakes - red wine instead of white (it would have been okay if i halved it). however, a couple of days later we took out all the beef shank, browned some beef stew meat and let it cook in the stew as it reheated. by that time, the over-wineyness had disappeared and flavours had mingled and it was delicious. definitely serve this with potatoes AND bread - it is excellent for sopping!

I made this recipe for my buddies for the Super Bowl after party dinner with a fabulous amarone wine and they were absolutely floored by how fantastic it was.

This is delicious. I have been making it for company for about 5 years--it has wonderful flavor, great presentation, and can be made well ahead so that I can spend time with guests.

I have made this several times and it is outstanding. Doesn't need the grmolata, but the olives are essential. I recently had osso buco made with lamb in Mexico and it was much better and more flavorful than with veal. I have recently made this recipe with lamb and it is to die for!!! I had alot of extra sauce and I used the sauce to make shitake mushroom lasagna - it had one layer of blue cheese and a topping of mozzarella cheese. Incredibly rich and delicious.

Delicious- I made this with Beef shanks as they are widely available here. I made just 2 shanks with the same sauce recipe and served with crusty bread (the sauce is divine) and a crisp salad. Also used red wine instead of white and cooked at 300 about 3 hours. Added chopped fresh Italian herbs to the sauce before putting it in the oven.Thumbs up- I will use this base again and play with the core recipe- it certainly is overall simple yet the depth of flavor makes it a keeper.Great to make it in a Le Creuset type cast iron enameled dutch oven for one pot cooking!

This was outstanding. I made it for a crowd of 20, and did not alter the recipe except that I didn't tie the shank pieces, and when I tested the meat after 2 hours in the oven I found that it was tender. I reluctantly took the meat off the bones because it was for a buffet, and reheated it for about 35 minutes. My guests loved it.

I made this recipe for my father's birthday (Osso Bucco is his favorite). It was a smashing success. He could not stop raving about it being the best Osso Bucco he's ever had.

Another winner!! I just could not bring myself to serve halibut this way, as it is hard to beat broiled halibut with garlic butter and lemon, but CHICKEN osso buco was tangy and deeply satisfying, served over a gourmet rice blend.

Osso buco on a cold winter night, nothing could provide better comfort and culinary delight. This is an outstanding rendition of the dish made exactly as written. I have also prepared it as a stew with boneless veal - 2 lbs. for four servings, with the sauce ingredients only modestly adjusted by reducing the amount of white wine and kalamata olives to 1/2 cup each. And, of course, the cooking time in the oven is only about an hour. When meat is done to tenderness, remove it and reduce the sauce on moderately high until somewhat thickened and glossy. Also, try the lemon risotto on this site as a side dish - a superb accompaniment.

This is an excellent version of the dish. What is especially nice is that you slow cook it in the oven rather than cooking it on the stove top. This technique requires a lot less hovering on the cook's part. I served it with the recipe for Creamy Polenta and it was a total success!!

I made this for my father-in-law's birthday. He loved it! I had to cook it on the stove top but kept the top off of my pot so the sauce could reduce down and it got so much flavor! (I had no lack of sauce!) Loved the addition of the olives. Served it with garlic/parmesan mashed potatoes and a tomato "carpaccio" salad with arugula and herbs and shaved parmesan (from foodnetwork.com) Yummy!

This is a fantastic recipe. I modified by using lamb shanks, beef broth and zinfandel, added extra thyme, olives, etc. You'll want to double the sauce as it is remarkably good. Served with white beans with garlic and fresh rosemary. Despite the notes, this is best served the same day you make it.

I will make it again for Easter, and I am going to put in more wine, vegetables and broth to add to the finished sauce.

AWESOME!! My guests said this was the BEST they've ever had, and I must agree. I only used 4 shanks but kept the same amounts for the sauce...it's so tasty! Also I browned about 1 1/2 ozs of chopped pancetta, using it's fat (in addition to the oil/butter) to brown the shanks in. The Gremolata is a must, adds a nice zing to the finished dish.

I had turkey drumsticks and used those and the "osso buco" was delicious. I omitted the bay leaf and olives. Served it with saffron risotto and herbed green beans, just a wonderful comfort meal. After the osso buco finished in the oven, I took the turkey off the bone.

Dee-licious. I used lamb shanks instead of veal, and it was wonderful. I made it for a dinner party, so made it the day ahead and warmed it up before the party. This allows the flavors to blend, and also allows you to skim the fat from the sauce after refrigeration. Also leaves you more time with your guests. Everyone raved and wondered if they could come over for leftovers the next day! I paired it with the gorgonzola polenta on Epicurious, which was great and also can be made ahead except for the topping and broiling. Very stress-free evening for me! P.S. I echo the comments of others that the leftover sauce is terrific over pasta the next day -- don't forget the crusty bread to sop it up with!

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious. Make sure to make one extra piece of veal to cut up and add to the excess sauce (which I "diluted" with a can of whole tomatoes) to make an equally tasty pasta dish the next day. The lemon zest really makes a difference, don't omit!

After following the recipe exactly, next time I will double the broth since it made such an excellent sauce for the pasta!

(They have been so immeasureably wonderful to me that I love to spoil them when they are in my home!) Aside: I made this osso buco recipe with lamb "steaks", i.e. leg of lamb sliced crosswise, because the health food market gave me the political correctness lecture about the abusive nature of baby bovine production. I'm confused as to why eating baby sheep is more acceptable than baby cow. What do I know?!?

This dish is very well-rounded and hearty. My guests thought it was fantastic. A previous comment mentions that the strong-tasting olives will permeate the dish; however, it looks like the person didn't even prepare it. Anyway, the statement is a off base. The olives definitely added complexity to the dish, but in no way overpowered it. My only complaint is that it is a bit greasy/fatty, but I feel that way about most beef stews, too (hey, it's osso buco... whaddaya expect??!!). Despite this, I would happily make it again.

One simple word...fabulous! I made this dish for friends last saturday...it was....fabulous. You really need to stick to the recipe ingredient by ingredient and you need to cook it long and slow and savor it long...and slow. The meat is so tender and the olives, believe it or not, are not overly strong at all in this dish. I do believe they mellow out with the length of time this dish takes to cook. This is a keeper and it does fall off the bones when serving. Instead of polenta I made orzo and it was perfect. Served it along side a gorgonzola pear salad w/walnuts, warm crusty french bread and two nice bottles of cabernet. I actually caught one of the guests holding up their empty plate and licking the sauce off of it!

I made this over the weekend using 4 1/2 pounds of veal shanks. I made it on Saturday, skimmed off the fat on Sunday morning, and served it Sunday evening. I made all the sauce the recipe called for, and even added an extra can of chicken broth (2 cans of broth instead of 1 cup). I used (and highly recommend) a 28 ounce can of San Marzano tomatoes. It was just wonderful...the meat was so tender that the shanks were hard to keep together. Regarding the olives, I used about 2/3 of a cup mixture of kalamata and nicoise olives. I agree the former olives are generally strong tasting, but the flavor did not permeate the dish as noted by the previous reviewer. Cooking them so long seemed to make them much milder in flavor. I'm not a huge olive fan, but they are just wonderful in this dish. I served with parmesan polenta and a nice bottle of zinfindel - yum! This is very similar to the "Short Ribs Provencale" recipe on this site, also a spectacular recipe as far as comfort-type food goes. Bon Appetit!

I have not made this yet but just happened upon it and wanted to see how similar it was to the recipe I usually use. To Kyle, you are a sweetheart! I never touch, cook, or eat veal for the same reason. I used to use Beef shank but found them too big, so now I use Tri-tip roast cut into a little larger than stew size pieces. I comes out very tender and I serve it over garlic mashed potatoes. I has become one of my husbands favorites! I just call it Stew Osso Bucco style.

To Vancouver and to Kyle - this would be lovely with lamb shanks. I use them often in lieu of beef in slow-cooked dishes such as this. Cedar Springs naturally raised lamb is readily available in most markets. Most beef is raised inhumanely, too, so if veal bothers you, lamb is a safe bet both ethically and gastronomically. To the cook from Greece - polenta is simply the side dish shown in the photograph; it's not part of this recipe.

Delicious - to Kyle - I agree so I have always used small beef shanks for osso bucco - Just make sure the shanks are not too large, and our consciences can remain clear. I have never tried with lamb shanks( which I frequently use for other dishes) but plan to do so as the flavours should meld equally well.
