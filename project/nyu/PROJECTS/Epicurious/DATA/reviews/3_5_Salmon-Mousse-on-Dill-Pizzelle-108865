4 forks is for the pizzelles. They are a favorite every Christmas, but with a different mousse recipe (Gourmet, Nov. 1997). The recipe is in Gourmet 2003, NOT Bon Appetit!

This is a recipe that gets unsolicited kudos every time I make it.I use a variety of toasts for spreading and plenty of dill.

My sister and I have been making this recipe for parties for over 30 years! I think we found it in an old Gourmet. We never made the dill pizzelle - We serve it melba toast.
