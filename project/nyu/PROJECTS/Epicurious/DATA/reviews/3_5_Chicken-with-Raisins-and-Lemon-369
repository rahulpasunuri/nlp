This is good, but if you substitute garnet yams for russet potatoes, it is fantastically more flavorful. I use boneless, skinless thighs, with just one bone-in, skin-on thigh for additional flavor. Imagine chicken broth also adds flavor. I don't add the 2 Tbs lemon juice. One big juicy lemon cooked in the soup is plenty. Have served it for 8 yrs, always a hit.

With one change, this recipe came to life. With two more changes, it became super-easy. Instead of russet potatoes, I use garnet yams. I use 2 lbs boneless, skinless thighs, plus 1 thigh with skin & bone, and 1 half breast (sometimes added a little later so it doesn't dry out). I do not bother thickening it, nor do I use additional lemon juice. I use Imagine organic chicken broth (not low-sodium). This is hands-down the best soup (yes, w/o thickening, it becomes a hearty soup) I've ever made. I get rave reviews from everyone I serve it to.

Just wonderful... I love the thick intense lemony sauce. The raisins especially get a wonderful sweet-sour flavour. I make it completely as written and adore it.

As much as I love the simplicity of a one-pot meal, I don' t know that I'd make this again as written. Although it was tender and jucy, there just isn't enough time for the chicken to absorb the flavors. I might simmer the chicken first in the broth, garlic, tumeric and lemon for a while, and then add the potatoes and raisins at the end, so they don't get too mushy. The potatoes were delicious as written, but the chicken was bland.

Very good weeknight dinner. Had only one lemon, so used that for the slices, and a lime for the juice. Should have held back a bit, as I found it a bit too acidic. Next time will use lemon juice as called for, and see if it makes a difference.

Yes, very very good, but definitely needs some tweaking. We used 6 chicken skinless breasts and one big Meyer lemon. Added extra oil to account for the missing skin, two cloves of garlic, and a pinch of curry. The lemon flavor was delicious but, we felt, too overpowering. Will make it again but will add some things to balance out the acidity: more raisins, more curry, perhaps some hot pepper. Any other suggestions welcomed!

KEEPER! Kicking myself for not finding this recipe sooner. Perfect everyday meal... all ingredients in the fridge/freezer/pantry at all times. Served it up with some simple steamed rapini (brocolli rabe) and I almost cried I was so happy!!! Do you get the idea that I like it.... a lot?

I wish I could give this one 5 forks -- this is the BEST chicken dish I've ever made. I threw in some chopped dates along with the raisins, and added a generous pinch of curry powder in addition to the other spices. It was even better the second day for lunch. Be sure to have some nice crusty bread to soak up the "gravy". Next time I'll omit the potatoes and serve it over rice in soup bowls.

This is my "don't know what to do for dinner" favorite. Quick, easy and tasty. Over the past few months I have modified the recipe by using boneless, skinless chicken thighs rather than a whole chicken, doubling up on the amount of garlic and use bullion cubes and water rather than chicken broth.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I did make a few substitutions I did not have any turmeric on hand so instead I added curry powder and cumin. Very tasty! That did add a bit of a middle eastern flavor to it. I will definately make this again - IT IS SO EASY - to make and clean up.

I agree with Lynnwood WA. Not that much Middle Eastern flavor, but so easy! Using the times suggested above, the chicken came out very tender, but the potatoes were a little too soft. This dish would go well over a bed of rice.

This was not what I was looking for. The flavor was rather UNextraordinary. I would make it again because it was very easy to make and the chicken was nice and tender, but a little short on Middle Eastern flavor.

I put in an additional potato, and extra garlic and raisons-the chicken still came out great. I ended up over cooking the broth. Ended by putting the lemon juice directly on chicken; and still came out great. Only 1 pot to clean, will make this dish again.

I placed all in roaster pan & baked covered 30 minutes at 350 degrees. Then removed cover & baked another 30 minutes. Chicken got a little brown on top. Very good flavor & sooo easy! Family loved it. I only used enough broth to come 1/2 way of chicken pieces. Had plenty of sauce.

This recipe is so easy and delicious. I used drumsticks (without skin) and put everything in a baking dish, covered with foil and cooked for 30 mins in mod oven, then another 15 mins uncovered. Served with steamed veg. Lots of flavour. I've told everyone about the recipe.
