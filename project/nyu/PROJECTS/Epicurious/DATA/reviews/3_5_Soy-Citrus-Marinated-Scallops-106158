A big, fat NO! In fact, it really deserves no stars. This dish is very one note with the citrus in the sauce predominating and masking the scallops. I'm not at all sure what the recommended soba salad adds except a gray color.

I'm no recipe reviewer, but this dish was so bad that I feel compelled to warn future cooks-- Made this a few days ago and eating it is the equivalent of drinking reduced soy sauce. The ginger, citrus, and scallops were entirely overpowered. As written, totally inedible.

I rarely rate recipes but this was one of the poorest recipes I have ever made. The soy sauce was overpowering, none of the other flavors were apparent. I would not reccomend this

Very good and light eating. Make sure you're brave and truly sear the scallops when first cooking.

I used cod because scallops wee too expensive. This recipe is quick easy delicious. Tonight Im making it with shrimp & chicken. The soba salad is very good with this. Nice summer meal!

I made this recipe as presented. It was okay, but not great. Sorry. For a website of this calibre, it shouldn't be necessary to read 40 reviews for tweaks to make the recipe right.

How good? Sooo good! I was really happy with this dish! I too only used a 1/4 cup soy sauce and it was perfect! The sauce would be suitable for a number of other seafoods and salads as well if you have leftover marinade. I combined this with the recommended soba salad and it went very well. I also added a little bit of dungeoness crab. it made a perfect appetizer and looks very elegent! A great one for when you have guests over! A warning though, it does involve a lot of chopping so a mandolin would be handy if you're having a lot of people over.

TOO SALTY! The soy sauce took over the other flavors in this recipe. Next time I will either make a separate sauce to serve on the scallops or reduce the the amount of soy. The scallops themselves were delicious!

After reading all the reviews I incorporated many of the suggestions. I will make this again but only with the changes I've made. First, I bought prawns because the store only had frozen scallops at $19/lb. The prawns were good. I reduced the soy sauce to 1/3 cup and the sugar to tablespoon. When I reduced the sauce I didn't reduce it too much because that intensifies the saltiness. The other changes I made were to the soba salad and I will make them there.

Great recipe. We used whole wheat noodles and they worked fine. Just make sure to keep the vegetable oil to a minimum. Since the scallops give off liquid as they cook, too much oil and all you're doing is poaching the scallops instead of caramelizing them. Overall, great blend of flavors.

I've been making these ever since the recipe was printed. Excellent, fragrant, and nutritious.

Nice recipe! I kind of eyeballed everything and took some advice from previous reviews. I used a bit of cilantro, chile sauce, juice of a whole lemon, juice of a whole lime, lots of fresh grated ginge, cut the soy sauce, cut the sesame oil, and used a bit of simple syrup (which I use for my mojitos!) to make this recipe. I used bay scallops and sauteed with some shoe-string summer squash. Definitely a keeper of a recipe! Nice over soba noodles.

I would give the written recipie a 3 but with a few tweeks this could become a 4. I used 1/4c lite soy sauce, 1/2 c. Orange juice instead of lemon, 1/3c. lime juice, 1tsp of sesame oil, 1tsp asian chilli oil and 2tsp of cilantro. Turned out like a chilli lime sauce which was quite delightful and tasty with the scallops.

Strangely, my kids really enjoyed this. It was simple to prepare and well received. I used the left over marinade for a salad dressing and can be tossed with veggies. It is delicious. Next time, I will double the ginger and cut the soy sauce by 1/3. A thought: It may also be good with a splash of orange juice as a citrus substitute for the sugar(???).

I really liked this way to cook Scallops. It was different from the same old pan seared and buerre blanc sauce. Cut down on the soy and it is a keeper. Good as an app too

I loved this recipe. I cooked the scallops on a grill pan and they were perfectly done. We didn't even add any of the sauce, the marinade was enough.

soy was a bit overwhelming, but the dish was lovely. i doubled the ginger and served with matchstick green squash & rice.

Quite tasty and very easy to make. I had to let my sauce reduce for about 5 - 7 minutes before it was drizzle-able. The sauce really makes a big difference.

definitely too much soy. tried with 1/2c. soy and then ended up adding more juice to dilute it further. it was OK. nothing outstanding.

Served with the soba salad, this goes into the permanent repertoire, especially good for summer. I took the advice of others, and reduced soy sauce down to 1/4 cup, but otherwise stayed with the recipe. Served with a Vouvray, it was a crowd pleaser; light, fresh and delicious.

It was good. Would I RAVE about it, no, but I would make it again. What I would RAVE about is the ease of making this dish; it took minutes to assemble. A great "during the week" recipe.

great lowfat recipe. good combo with with soba salad. used spinach instead of mizuma too. would make again!

I served the scallops over a bed of wilted baby spinach - it was really nice. I would recommend a low sodium soy sauce...it was a bit salty.

One of my all-time favorites!!! Excellent and I wouldn't change a thing.

i would not make this dish again. way too salty (and i used far less soy sauce than was called for). i feel there is nothing that can save this culinary disaster.

Delicious recipe. I substituted the scallops for rainbow trout and it was just as good.I imagine you can use any kind of fish almost.

I've made this dish a few times now, and we love it! To me, it's a 4-fork with the following modifications: only use about 1/4 cup max of soy sauce, add a clove of garlic, add about a tablespoon of fresh cilantro, use only a few drops of the sesame oil, and only use about 2 tsp sugar. We always add shrimp too. Also, we marinate for at least two hours, then grill them on skewers. The extra time marinating doesn't make them mushy, from what I can tell.

I, too, reduced the amt of sot sauce and found that just perfect. This is so easy and yummy

Just had this for dinner and loved it - delicious!. Changed it a bit though.... after reading of all the 'too salty' horrors we substituted about a teaspoon of fish sauce for the 2/3 of a cup of a soya sauce and it was a hit. We had it as a starter and served the scallops over fresh greens, perfect.

Hmm . . . I also used low-sodium soy sauce, but just because that's all I ever buy, just in case. I also thought something was lacking--or too assertive--with this dish. My BF, who'll eat a dirty gym shoe (and hence loves my Epicurious obsession) said the flavor of the sauce/marinade was "too dominating in comparison to the scallops." Although I was delighted to hear such a thing from him, I had to agree. I don't think I'll fix this again.

Gross, gross, gross. The soy was way too strong and ruined the scallops. The sweet was also too intesnse. The receipe was also lacking something else. Maybe garlic. It was just such a disappointment to ruin such good fish.

I found this to be excellent. Be sure to proportion the lime and juice to taste, then add sugar to taste. I added some steamed veggies, and also some shallots while reducing the sauce at the end. I also added some crushed cashews to the sauce before reducing which added additional flavor and texture. We loved it.

I loved this recipe although I would also minimize the amount of soy sauce that is used. I chose lite soy and used 1/4 cup like the lime and lemon juices. My husband enjoyed it as well! I will definitely make it again.

Didn't like it - It was way too salty even with the low-salt soy sauce. I couldn't taste the citrus at all.

This was ok, but I probably won't make it again. My husband didn't like it and he usually likes everything I make. He thought it was too salty and too sweet. Go figure!

Even as a salt lover, next time around I would use low sodium soy sauce. Other than that, this recipe is absoultely wonderful and simple.

Great recipe if you alter it a bit. Reduce the soy sauce to 1/2 cup or less. Use low-sodium soy too...otherwise, it is so salty! But, the flavor of the lemon and lime is excellent with scallops!

Fabulous! Really good scallops make all the difference-so easy and soooooo good! I serve this over great northern beans dressed with creamy mayo/dijon dressing and the combination is out of this world.

Scallops turned out good. I used low-sodium soy sauce also. I didn't see a reason to cook scallops in two batches as my pan was big enough to fit all of them. Next time, I will reduce the marinade recipe by half as that's all you need. If you don't like salty food, reduce the amount of soy sauce. I will try the marinade in some type of fish next time - perhaps red snapper with some added scallions.

loved the recipe. it was easy to make just a little messy. the oil sprayed quite a bit when the scallops were dropped in.

Totally rocked. Since the sauce is basically a ponzu variant, I used 1/3 cup soy sauce & 1/3 cup mirin sake to keep the salt down. Worked like a champ.

This was an easy recipe to put together and my husband absolutely loved it, but I thought it was kind of salty, and I used low sodium soy sauce too. Next time, I'll go easy on drizzling the sauce. I served this over linguine instead of the soba noodles, with green beans on the side that I put the sauce on as well. My 8 yr. old loved the sauce with the beans and pasta! Go figure.

I used low-sodium soy sauce because I don't like salty foods. This had great citrus flavor and was not heavy on the salt. Will definitely make it again.

I enjoyed this, was a real pleasure and simple. However, I would use low-sodium soy sauce next time. We used Kikkoman, and I found that the reduced sauce was a bit salty. That aside, the recipe is terrific and as people here pointed out, lends itself to side dish versatility. thnaks for it!

We also made it with the Soba Salad. The scallops were wonderful but I think I would pair it with something else...even a baby bok choy with soba noodles would have been more interesting. I would make the scallops again but play with the side dish....

This was absolutely fabulous! The scallops were perfect with the fresh citrus flavours. The only changes I made were to add a finely grated clove of garlic and a tsp each of lemon and lime zest to the marinade. I also made the marinade an hour or so in advance so the flavours had time to blend and deepen. Served atop the Soba Salad, drizzled the reduced marinade over all, and garnished with a sprinkle of lemon/lime zest. A lovely presentation with much eye appeal. My husband loved it - said the flavours literally burst on his tongue. This is a real winner!

Wonderful taste combination! I substituted yukon gold wasabi mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach for the soba salad but otherwise followed the recipe verbatim. It was an elegant entree that I didn't have to feel guilty eating.

This dish is very nice. I made it with the 'soba salad' which accompanies the scallop recipe in the Bon Appetit magazine. For the soba salad, I used arugula instead of mustard greens and zucchini instead of cucumber.

Absolutely fantastic to both the mouth and the eye! I also mainated and sauted a Pacific Snapper fillet and added it - too good! I'm sure this marinade would work for any firm fish. The soba salad is a must.
