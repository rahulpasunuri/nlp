This was bit bland. I expected more flavor from the scallions. I felt it was missing something, maybe lemon and some zest? It's not bad but it definitely needs some help.

Delicious dish when made with corn pasta for those people who have a gluten allergy.

If I could give this recipe zero forks, I would. I registered just to alert people how awful this was. The only taste was bitterness with discordant notes of dessicated leaves. Still, I wouldn't feed it to my compost pile. I rate this recipe one half of a tine of a dirty plastic spork.

Crushed red pepper, more salt, less oil. I thought is was tasty. Maybe because my scallions were homegrown? The cheese seemed to mellow it out, I'm not sure if I liked that ingredient. Without the cheese, I'm thinking tossing it with some chunks of halibut, large shrimp, maybe some other shell fish.

I added some crushed red pepper while sauteing the scallions and garlic. I made it with chicken that I marinaded in lemon juice, garlic, chopped scallions, and salt and pepper. It all went together very well and I would make again for a simple week night meal.

This was really tasty! I changed it a tad because I didn't have enough scallions. I added a bit of garlic scapes and young shallot tops to fill in. Also only used the oil to cook the onions in, I didn't add any while blending because people said it was too oily. I just used extra pasta water to get the right consistency. It was really very good. Even my 3 yr old gobbled it all up. I would definitely make it again.

This was really easy to prepare and we loved the finished dish. Made it exactly as written. The flavor of the onions and garlic was mild, and the lemon was a nice complement. Very spring-y and bright.

I really did not like this recipe - I found it bland and a bit too oily.

I loved this pasta. I would definitely make this again.

The only way I will make this again is with modifications. Both me and my husband love green onions and thought this would be really good. However, we found it to be almost bland. If I make this again, I will double the garlic, add more lemon zest, and maybe a touch of red pepper flakes.

I don't understand how you found it tastless. It was very good. I cut everything in half, as there are only two of us, added a little more salt and pepper,a bit more of lemon zest, and kept the two cloves of garlic. We both made clean plate!

I just had it for lunch. Didn't have spaghetti or lemons. used bowtie pasta, added more cheese, and more pasta water. I enjoyed it. The sauce clung to the pasta rather than sit in the bottom of the bowl. Next time I'd chop the scallions finer (when I blended it couldn't get rid of scallion fibers which was just an appearance quibble) and maybe more garlic.

Well it's green. Doesn't offer much in the way of flavor, other than the cheese and a very faint taste of lemon. Could taste very little of the onion or garlic. Maybe it will taste better tomorrow. There's pleny leftover!
