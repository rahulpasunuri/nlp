I have made this recipe several times, always to great reviews. Guests always love the combination of the goat cheese sauce with the glazed shallots. Last Christmas, we served with pyrogy (potato and cheese or potato and cabbage). One word: UNBELEIVABLE! I make the sauces the day before, and roast the meat the day of the event.

Sorry, we just didn't love this goat cheese sauce. It was very thick and pasty, the goat cheese flavor got lost, found the dijon too prominent. Added some parmesan at the end to try to spruce it up a little, just made it thicker. Added a touch of brandy, that helped a little. Would NOT make this again. Fortunately the beef was great anyway.

Made this on a camping trip. Instead of pan frying the steaks, I marinated them in red wine and olive oil and cooked them on the open fire. Since I pre-made the goat-cheese sauce (no electricty while camping) I also added a little more goat cheese to the sauce to make it thicker and tangier. It was wonderful. Served with the shallots. The combination of all flavors was wonderful.

Elegant, beautiful, and delicious! Rave reviews. Must make the shallots. I skipped the spaetzle and instead served with new potatoes w/chive butter. Had potatoes and goat cheese sauce left over, and combined both to make mashed potatoes the next day - outstanding!

This was amazing! I would make the dish again. There was not a clean plate in the house. I agree that the shallots were to die for. I served it with mushroom risotto and asparagus. I didn't bother with the spaetzle...not enough time.

THis is a great recipe for guests. WOnderful presentationand very little time spent in the kitchen. I would make the sauce right before guests arrive and keep it warm then heat it up a bit right before serving. I served mine with roasted red potatoes and asparagus. Both things you can prepare ahead and cook while guests are enjoying a glass of wine.

The sauce was a bit congealed and oily. I would have liked it to be a bit lighter.

The goat cheese sauce was wonderful and so fun to make and taste as I went. I would NOT make the sauce in advance and reheat. I would make it right before you serve because the reheating process hurt the consistency of my sauce, it was "pasty". I served this dish with wild rice with chopped sauted mushrooms which was great. Rave reviews.

Good. Did the whole menu - the shallots were yum, as was the meat. Wouldn't bother with the Spatzle again.

The shallots are a must. This recipe was very good primarily because tenderloin is always very good, but I prefer the tenderloin with roasted shallots, bacon, and port (also on this site). Now that one is AMAZING!! I served this with mushroom wild rice and spinach salad with pears (also on this site). The cheese sauce is really unique - I got a kick out of making it!

Tried to use green onions, but I'm sure it's better with the larger shallots. It was very good.

Make this with the shallots. You will love it.

The best main course I have ever cooked. One of our guests was a very "picky" eater and even he cleaned his plate. I prepared the sauce the day before. I was concerned then that it was too thin, but it thickened up nicely when I reheated it on the night. The shallots were super. Next time I think I will do more. I did not bother about the spaetzle. Definitely a winner.

Excellent dinner party menu; however, I would not make the buttermilk spinach spaetzle again... way too much work and my results did not rise to the impeccable level of sophistication the beef and sauce did. The shallots are a must!!!! rest of the meal. Would instead serve a ready made high quality egg noodle (fresh/frozen).

A total knockout dish!! Very expen$ive dish to make but worth 10 times the cost. This has become a regular holiday guest request in my home. The shallots are just to die for. Careful as wine splatters EVERYWHERE and does not behave like oil. Careful if you make this dish, you may never get rid of your guests as they keep asking for more :-)
