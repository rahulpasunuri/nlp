This is the kind ob basic pasta sauce that's great to have on hand when you want dinner fast. I followed other's suggestions (extra garlic, wine and butter). I also used chili flakes for a kick and fresh spinach to add flavor and nutrition. Will make again!

I really liked the taste that baked tomatoes gave to the pasta, it was a very fresh take on just pasta with marinara sauce. I added extra garlic and used the oil from some marinated artichokes and olives I had. When it was time to combine with the pasta, I added some of the pasta water and a dab of butter. I also cooked in pasta in water seasoned with Chicken Bouillon. I actually can't wait to make this again! All of my guests raved about it!!

I have the book the recipe is from - here's the last paragraph of the directions that was omitted: When the tomatoes are done, add the basil and stir vigorously to mix everything into a sauce. Drain the pasta and immediately transfer it to the baking dish. Add the remaining olive oil and mix well. Alternatively, transfer the pasta to a large heated bowl, then immediately add the hot tomato sauce and the oil. Serve at once.

It's nothing ground-breaking, but was delicious and my husband really liked it. I loved that you just stir in the cooked pasta and serve in the baking dish--so easy. A reviewer below noted the recipe doesn't say what to do with the rest of the olive oil. I drizzled it on top of the tomatoes after putting on the breadcrumb mixture, before baking.

Love this dish...make it all the time. The only thing I do differently is nix the bread crumbs, and add a little white wine and a pat of butter to the baking tomatoes. I don't add the cheese until the very end, tossing about half the cheese with the warm pasta (I use regular thin spaghetti) and then toss in the tomato mixture and top with the remaining cheese. Awesome and soooo easy!

Ok, OK, by the write ups, I will make this tomarrow. I have a ton of tomatoes from the farmers mkt to use, and of course, pasta is always a favorite. I am always looking for easy, flavorful, yet "slow food" to make. This sounds like it fits in that realm. I may even try it with shrimp, or sausage as writers have mentioned.

Rating: 4
Ok, so I made the pasta and added the olive oil to the bread crumbs and sprinkled it on top of the tomatoes and baked them. It was an excellent dish and I will make it many more times. Went to the local farmers market and got a pound of ripe cherry tomatoes for a dollar which made this an inexpensive and great meal.

I am going to make this pasta for dinner this evening however I can't find the use for the other 2/3 of the olive oil. Am I missing something in the recipe? If I don't receive an answer I think I will drizzle it over the tomatoes and bread crumbs. Thanks.

This is a great recipe, but you know what makes it even better? using toasted garlic oil (garilc cloves simmered in 1/3 cup olive oil until golden brown) for baking the tomatoes and drizzling over the pasta, and adding caramelized onions. The garlic and onions add just the right amount of body and sweetness to the sauce--- especially if you don't have access to farm fresh, sugary tomatoes.

I was unsure about this one but it was excellent. I used about 1 1/2 lbs ripe baby romas and cherry tomatoes. 1/2 c homemade breadcrumbs and 3 cloves of garlic. Baked for 30 mins - mashed the tomatoes and served with more parmesian. Used campanelle pasta and it was perfect for scooping up the sauce. My husband (and I) loved it - simple but if you use fresh, top of the line ingredients it's restaurant worthy. Will make again.

Rating: 4
This is one of the best pasta sauces I have ever made. Don't skimp on the fresh bread crumbs, not when it's so easy to pulse old bread in the food processor. I didn't think it needed all of the oil suggested, but that's more of a personal preference.

I thought this recipe sounded odd, I tried it nonetheless. I thought it was fantastic. It was very fresh tasting, the next time I make this however, I will add more cherry tomatoes as well bake a few larger juicy tomatoes because the sauce was somewhat sparing.The kids loved it!

This is a mainstay dish for a quick weeknight dinner. I hate breadcrumbs so I use about 1/2 cup extra large gourmet croutons. I also up the garlic & add about a teaspoon of whatever Italian herbs I feel like tossing in. It comes out fabulous every time. The croutons are nice and soft, but not mushy like breadcrumbs, & they absorb the garlic and herb flavor.

This is a great, quick pasta that requires very little effort and is heaps better than buying jarred pasta sauce. I also like throwing in a carrot and pureeing the whole lot for a smooth sauce. I've also varied the herbs - whatever I have on hand or can reap from my garden - it's a very forgiving recipe.

I'm not a pasta lover -- but my boyfriend is. I make this for him when he's begging for pasta and I feel lazy. His review is it's the best thing on earth -- I think it's pretty good for basically no work (3 forks). I do double the sauce - add a decent amount of salt to it and sometimes put a dash of balsamic when I'm mixing the ingreds together.

Love this recipe, very easy... Some steps missing from the recipe, I followed other reviewers suggestions. I used 1/3 of the oil on bottom of baking dish, 1/3 sprinkled on top of tomatoes and breadcrumb mixture, and 1/3 mixed with pasta before putting mixture on top. I did crush the tomatoes, next time I would only crush half. I sprinkled the basil on the top of the pasta before serving. Make sure you use good quality cheeses!!

Rating: 3
I halved the recipe, but left all the ratios the same. I used 1/3 of the oil in the roasting pan, 1/3 over the top of the tomatoes after they were nearly done, and 1/3 in the drained pasta. My kids loved it! I think the only change I'll make is to bake the tomatoes a little longer next time to intensify the flavors of the roasted tomato with the cheeses. Otherwise, it's perfect.

Rating: 2
An easy enough dish to make but slightly disappointing. Cut back on the bread crumbs and use the juiciest tomatoes you can find, which isn't easy nowadays. Had to leave the tomatoes from the gorcery store out 3 days before even attempting the recipe. And still they weren't ripe.

Rating: 1
This was very, very disappointing. I tried following the advice of other reviews - a bit of balsamic, oil on TOP of the topping, but it still was the least tasty tomato sauce I've ever made. My tomato skins were burnt black underneath (only saw when lifting them out), so I ended up peeling them. The oven had dried them out at the high heat reccomended, and they were slightly acidic, and didn't have a mellow, roasted taste. It is better to roast the tomatoes whole for longer at a lower temperature, stirring frequently. They stay moister that way. You can always toast the garlic and crumbs over the stove, and sprinkle afterwards with the cheese.

Rating: 2
Easy enough to make but not as tasty or exciting as other reviews made me believe. Too much bread crumbs. Would cut back on same.

This tomato sauce is so incredibly easy, and so incredibly delicious. My husband and I enjoy it everytime. Perfect for weeknight dinners when you need something fast- it takes me 15 minutes or less and then it's in the oven. The tomatoes smell delicious when baking and the cheese/garlic/bread crumbs and basil are wonderful together. I serve over angel hair pasta- and don't forget to finish the recipe by adding the remaining 1/3 olive oil to the pasta, then adding the basil to the baking dish and smashing the tomatoes to make the sauce. Pass around the Parmesan and enjoy! I am soooo glad I found this recipe!

Rating: 2
This was ok and fairly easy. However it was not great and I will not make it again. I liked the flavor and followed many suggestions, but as one cook noted, the recipe is not complete. After the tomatoes cook, they need to be mashed up and the basil added. In addition it just needs "something". I'll try a different recipe next time.

Rating: 3
A 3+!! A Really good, quick recipe!! I used a pound and a half of the tomatoes to one pound of pasta and increased all of the other ingredients by 50%. I would probably add another clove of garlic next time to stand up to the basil. This one is a keeper!

I've made pasta at least once a week for years and this is one of the best recipes I've tried. The baking method brings out the sweet flavour of the tomaotes, and the breadcrumbs make such a difference. I served this with hot italian sausage in a homemade tomato sauce on the side.

Would make this again and again, and its so easy. I love that there isn't any sautéing or simmering. All in the oven and its done. Did add a dash of cream and wine in the end to make a bit more saucier. A keeper!

Delicious for quick and simple meal. I also added a zucchini -- just sliced up and layered on top of the tomato breadcrumb mixture. Stir it all up at the end and the zucchini is perfectly cooked.

maybe the easiest tomato sauce recipe around and perfect for the summer. there's a certain freshness in flavour you get with this recipe that you can't get by making it on the stovetop. the riper the tomatoes, the better the sauce. i used vine tomatoes. smashing the tomatoes after it comes out of the oven is a good idea if you like it more "saucy" and less chunky.

Eh. Given the reviews, I expected to like this more. I don't know if my tomatoes weren't ripe enough or what, but the results were not very interesting. There are better simple pastas out there.

Simple yet great pasta dish - comfort food! I have made it several times and it never fails to please - even young/picky children love it. The directions are very vague though and you definitely need to double the sauce if using 1 lb of pasta. Here is my method: I like to use a mix of very ripe (almost mushy) cherry and roma/plum tomatoes; follow directions as stated but drizzle 2nd 1/3 of olive oil over tomato/crumb mixture just before putting dish in the oven. When done, stir well to break up tomatoes and incorporate the crumb/cheese mixture, then add the basil. Drain the cooked pasta and mix in final 1/3 olive oil. Add tomato sauce to pasta and mix well. If sauce seems too thick or not enough, add a little milk/light cream OR chicken/vegetable broth until you like the consistency. Serve with more grated parmesan, sit back, enjoy and revel in the sighs/smiles of your contented fellow diners!

Excellent flavors. I added an assortment of hot peppers to kick it up a bit. One question though, the recipe has a typo or a problem with the olive oil. It tells you to use a 3rd of the 1/3 rd cup but does not have you use the balance. I used only the 3rd of the 3rd. Great summer evening work day meal.

I adore this recipie!!! It is so delish! I just use whatever Italian type cheese I have on hand. Have even made this for company -- and they loved it. I don't use as much pasta as called for and I omit the oil. I've made it w/ Romas too and that was great...it's pretty fail-proof. A staple at our house -- especailly in the summer!

I added a little butter and cream instead of the rest of the olive oil and this seemed to work well. I almost always add a little heavy cream to all my pasta dishes (butter, too). If you don't care about the fat, GO FOR IT!

This was very good. I baked the tomatoes longer - more like 30 to 35 minutes. The amount of time it takes probably depends on the ripeness of the tomatoes. Summer tomatoes would probably cook faster. I used grape tomatoes, and they were very sweet, but a little more firm than good summer ones would be. I used the full recipe for the sauce, but only 1/2 of the pasta. It seemed to be just right.

was good, but not spectacular. This site has yielded better pastas than this. I cut down the amount of pasta used to make it more "saucy" which I think helped. However, I couldn't find a a way to make the pasta look particularly elegant... the tomato skins and torn basil, while tasty and added interesting texture.. made it appear slightly "messy" in a way. good decent reviews, but not ravings...

Excellent and sooooo easy. The recipe doesn't tell you what to do with the remainder of the olive oil so I just mixed it together in the end with the basil. I also made extra topping with the cheeses. This is a great quick dish to make for company. My guests devoured it.

This dish was delicious, but next time I would make only half the pasta called for in the recipe. A full pound of pasta was too much. I would have preferred the emphasis of the dish being on the tomato mixture as opposed to the pasta. It just wasn't "saucy" enough for me. But besides that, it was very tasty and easy to prepare.

I thought this was quite delicious, just not a dish beyond compare. The tomatoes were sweet and tender and the garlicky bread crumbs added great flavor. By the way, the rest of the recipe should read: When the tomatoes are done, add the basil and stir vigorously to mix everything into a sauce. Drain the pasta and immediately transfer it to the baking dish. Add the remaining olive oil and mix well. Alternatively, transfer the pasta to a large heated bowl, then immediately add the hot tomato sauce and the oil. Serve at once. (This comes directly out of the book "The Best American Recipes 2000")

I have done something like this. I take the "grape" tomatoes (sweeter than cherry). Two containers of them. 6 garlic cloves left in their skin. 6 shallots sliced thin. salt, pepper, small amount of balsamic vinegar, spray it all with olive oil. Bake 350 Mix a couple of times during baking. When done take the garlic out of the skins, mash garlic up, stir back in to other mixture. I then mix 3 fresh walnuts which have been grinded up and mix in. Great with Angel hair pasta

Fabulous! And so easy! We loved this. I just drizzled olive oil over the finished dish. I have home-grown roma tomatoes growing out my ears, so I am planning on trying this w/ the romas this week. They might not by saucy enough, but this recipie seems pretty failproof.

I had some trouble with this recipe. Part of it was the gaps in the directions (what about the other 2/3 of the oil? what do you do with the sauce when it comes out of the oven? how do you combine it with the pasta?), and the other part was probably that my tomatoes weren't ripe enough. I thought they were ripe, but they probably need to be on the verge of squishiness for this recipe to work. Also, this looks like a lot of oil but do not try to skimp. I did and the pasta came out so dry, I ended up having to go back and add the extra oil at the end. If I make this again I probably will smush up the tomatoes when they come out of the oven to release some liquid. To use the oil, I would mix some of it into the breadcrumb mixture, drizzle some on top before baking, and/or add it to the finished dish before serving. I'm surprised this was chosen as a best recipe of the year. It's whimsical, but it doesn't work very well as written.

Rating: 4
This is an excellent recipe, and I agree with the other comments. Simple, yet very tasty. I also was unsure what to do with the remaining olive oil, or how to prepare the final presentation. After trying it a couple of different ways, I recommend simply tossing the cut tomatoes in the olive oil and arrange the whole batch in a baking dish. After roasting, mix into the drained fusilli and serve. (Alternately, you can toss the remaining olive oil in with the tomotoes, but I prefer the roasted-mingled flavor. I have even tried mixing the basil into the crumb mixture and it's good. You can't go wrong.

Absolutely top-notch! The recipe gives no indication of how delicious this really is. I find fusilli to be the best kind of pasta for this. The other day, I used a lot of mushrooms (a variety of types) - about 2-3 cups, sliced as I did not have tomatoes. I added 2 jalapenos for heat. The rest of the recipe was identical - and it was delicious too. Add about 1/2 cup of pasta cooking liquid for the mushroom recipe, since it is a little dryer.

This is a SUPERB recipe. I have made it many times with great results. Tonight I prepared it with shallots instead of garlic (I actually ran out of garlic-go figure!?), had to use plain old canned breadcrumbs and had grape (not cherry) tomatoes. It was still amazing. A foolproof recipe to die for.

Magnifico! We saw this on Cucina Amore and made it that same night. It's better than it sounds. Make sure you use cherry or grape tomatoes- they have a sweet, intense tomato flavor (and ripeness) that isn't usually equaled by regular tomatoes. To Libby from CA- she just mixed the pasta in with the tomato mixture at the end on the show. Not pretty, but soooo good.

My new favorite pasta recipe: delicious, subtle and very easy to make, plus it looks so festive and cheerful-an important factor on these long, cold winter nights. I'm looking forward to making it this summer when everything is really fresh and ripe. I drizzled the rest of the olive oil over the crumb mixture before baking and it turned out just fine.

This was incredibly easy and really wonderful. The hardest part was making the cut tomatoes stand on their round end -- which was not hard at all. The test kitchen notes say that the olive oil is being used as a condiment, so I drizzled the remaining 2/3 on the pasta once I had mixed it in with the cooked tomato mixture. It was delicious that way.
