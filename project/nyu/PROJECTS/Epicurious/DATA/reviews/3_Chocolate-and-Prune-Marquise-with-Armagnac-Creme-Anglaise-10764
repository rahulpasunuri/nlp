I didn't 'rate' this recipe because I only made the 'creme anglaise' from it. the creme anglaise was delish & easy to make.

Excellent show stopper of a dessert. I found it fairly simple to make, not too much effort for such spectacular results. I did make one change, my husband loves chocolate with rum so I used Westerhall rum from Grenada instead of the Armangac with terrific results. I will definitely make this again.

Other than chopping the prunes,this dish is so very easy to make and a very successful dinner dessert for company. I have made it twice with no changes other than a substitute in the cholocat. It is so rich that a less expensive chocolate will do. It should be made the day before serving, and I would easily make it again.

If I had lots of time on my hands, I would make this again. However, it is definitely time consuming and I'm not sure it's worth the effort. Went over well at a Christmas party.
