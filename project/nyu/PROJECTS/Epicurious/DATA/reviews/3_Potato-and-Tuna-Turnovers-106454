I made this with puff pastry, which went quite well. But of course I had to bake them in the oven. A delicious filling.

The filling was really tasty. I added garlic to the mixture at the suggestion of previous reviewer. However, I was displeased at the amt of oil left on turnovers after cooking. Any suggestions? Also, would enjoy seeing exact directions on how to bake these instead.

This was pretty good, though I did a few things differently. Didn't bother to cut the phyllo into circles and baked the turnovers instead of frying. Also used extra capers because we love them and mixed some extra virgin olive oil with the light for flavor.

quite an easy one to make, given you have spare time(trying to rush things when working with phylo is a bad idea). the amount of filling this recipe yields makes more than 6, so buy more phylo sheets. melted butter is a much better sealing material than vegetable oil, so use butter to seal the edges. finally, i recommend adding a little garlic to the filling. overall, a nice dish, doesnt require an expert to make.
