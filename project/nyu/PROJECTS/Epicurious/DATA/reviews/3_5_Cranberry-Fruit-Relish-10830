I made this for Thanksgiving this year, and it was a HUGE hit, especially with kids, which surprised me. My guests insisted on taking the recipe home with them.

We have made this every year since it first came out in Gourmet. It is always a hit with our family and guests -- especially those who typically don't like cranberry sauce.

I made this for Christmas dinner, and it was a huge hit. My boyfriend, who doesn't even like cranberries, loved it. I also made it for a New Year's Eve party, and it went over quite well.

I added the zezt of the orange & a tablespoon or so of grand marnier - wonderfully fresh tasting.

Have made this dish every year since I first saw it in Gourmet ... my family demands it. Go easy w/ the food processor, so relish has a crunchy texture. Keep chilled ... a nice light, natural, cool, refreshing dish amidst the typical heavy holiday dishes.

I too was surprised at the reviewers who didn't care for this. My family has been making this recipe every year since it came out. Very light and refreshing - good on a table full of dishes that are generally heavier. Great with any poultry.

I was suprised to read the two previous comments as I made this last Thanksgiving and received WONDERFUL reviews. It's now a MUST!! It's so much better than the typical "cranberry relish".

Surprising considering the reviews, but this was just gross. I used much less pineapple than called for and the taste of the pineapple was over the top. The texture was glop, perhaps due to overenthusiasm with the food processor, but . . . we did salvage this. We put it in the blender with some Ben & Jerrys vanilla ice cream and Stolichnaya. In that way, and with the football game in the background, it became a delicious drink.

Every year I try a new cranberry relish recipe. This was easy but went completely unnoticed by my guests. Perhaps it was the texture.

For the past five years this has been my signature thanksgiving dish. It has a wonderful crunchy texture, and a tart/sweet taste. I will make it again this year, because it is always a hit.

This is an easy and totally refreshing side dish for just about anything! So many people have requested the recipe. I even sometimes make it just for me because it[s so delicious and refreshing!

This is a great cranberry dish! I made it mostly for the rest of the family, not expecting to like it because it calls for uncooked cranberries. It was fantastic, though - light tasting and surprisingly sweet. Also extremely quick and easy, which is important for holiday cooking!

I make this dish every year and we like it so much that I intend to buy several bags of cranberries to put in the freezer so I can make it all winter long. Not only does it go well with poultry but I'm sure it would go well with pork.

Our family makes this recipe every year for Thanksgiving dinner. It is a great and easy alternative to cranberry sauce in a jar (which no one in our family will eat) and always appeals to the more health conscious.
